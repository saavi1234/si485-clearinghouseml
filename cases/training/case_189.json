    "summary": "<p>On June 10, 1982, inmates of the Essex County Jail [ECJ] filed a class action lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging unconstitutional conditions of confinement.  On October 14, 1982, the District Court (Judge Harold A. Ackerman) approved and entered a Consent Decree which specified changes to be taken at the ECJ in the areas of overcrowding, exercise, inmate visits, food service, medical care, fire prevention and other general conditions.  The Court appointed two special masters to evaluate and monitor the jail conditions.  The 1982 Consent Decree was subsequently amended and modified several times. </p><p>On March 9, 1987, inmates in the Essex County Jail Annex  [ECJA] filed a similar ยง1983 suit and eventually the cases were consolidated. </p><p>On November 20, 1989 the District Court (Judge Harold A. Ackerman) issued sanctions against defendants for failing to abide by overall population limits as set by the 1982 Consent Decree as amended and not providing inmates recreation.  Essex County Jail Inmates v. Amato, 726 F.Supp. 539 (D.N.J. 1989).</p><p>Subsequent consent decrees followed, ending with the entry of a Second Consolidated Consent Order and Medical Consent Order on August 8, 1995.  Plaintiffs sought sanctions against defendants for violation of the Second Consolidated Consent Order.  The Court denied the request for contempt sanctions, but issued a fine which was suspended pending defendants immediately taking steps to come into compliance, as outlined by the Court. Essex County Jail Annex Inmates v. Treffinger, 18 F.Supp.2d 445 (D.N.J. 1998).</p><p>On November 24, 2003, the District Court denied the motion to intervene by Patrolmen Benevolent Association</p><p>On March 31, 2004, defendants moved all Essex County inmates held at ECJ and ECJA to the new Essex County Correctional Facility (ECCF).  Following the move, the parties prepared  a Third Consolidated Consent Order to take into account the new structure and facilities of the ECCF. </p><p>On December 2, 2005, the District Court issued an order that the cases would be administratively terminated if written objections to the proposed termination were not received from the parties.  Thereafter, the Special Masters provided the Court with their final Report and Recommendation, along with a copy of the proposed Third Consolidated Consent Order on December 14, 2006,</p><p>The District Court visited the ECCF on January 26, 2007, along with counsel for the parties and one of the Special Masters.  After the tour, on February 5, 2007, the District Court issued an order, denying the approval of  the proposed Third Consolidated Consent Order, and instead, dismissing the case.  In his order, Judge Ackerman noted that the Court no longer needed to be involved in the case and stated \"it is my fervent hope that the legendary Phoenix that is this case will at last find eternal rest.\"</p><p>As of the date of the summary, the case remained closed.</p><p></p>",

The  physical  plant  and  the  number  of  available l \ndormitory  cells  or  bunks  has  resulted  in  over  two  hundred I \n~gned \ninmates  at  times  being  as  โข  to  sleep  on  bunks  and  some \nS \nI,. I \nstretcher-like  cots  in  the  dayroom  areas,  or  corridor  areas  of \nthe  cell  tiers. \nPLAINTIFFS \nI \n4.

ECJA  Inmates  include  persons  confined  in  cells  and \ndormitories  which  are  in  need  of  repair.  Many  of  these  inmates \nare  exposed  to  conditions  such  as  those  listed  above  in  #2. \n7.  ECJA  Inmates  also  include  persons  who  have  not  yet \nbeen  assigned  to  a  cell.  Some  inmates  are  confined  for  periods l \ni \nI \nI \ni \ni \n-2-\n\ni' \nI \nI \nI \nof  time  in  corridor  areas,  where  they  sleep  on  temporary  bunks , \nI \ni \nor,  at  times,  stretchers  placed  on  .the  floor.  Daytime  floor : \ni \nI  space  for  activities  is  limited  and  walkways  between  bunks  or ! \nI  stretcher  like  cots  are  sometimes  narrow. \nI \n8.

Plaintiffs'  attorneys  are  associated  with  the  Office \nof  Inmate  Advocacy  of  the  New  Jersey  Office  of  the  Public I \nDefender.  They  are  familiar  with  the  conduct  of  litigation  of \nthis  kind  and  will  afford  adequate  representation.  By  statutory \nauthority,  N.J.S.A.  52:27E-ll  et  the  Office  is  authorized \n~, \nto  represent  the  interests  of  plaintiffs. \nBUILDING  AND  ITS  DESIGN \n15.  The  present  Essex  County  Jail  Annex  is  located  in \nNorth  Caldwell,  New  Jersey.  It  is  comprised  of  a  number  of \nservice  buildings  and  four  central  housing  buildings.  The  main \nhousing  buildings  include:  the  Men's  Building,  the  Women's \nBuilding,  the  New  Wing,  the  Modules  (also  referred  to  as  the \nR.C.F.  or  relocatable  correctional  facility)  and  the  State \nTrailers.  Other  buildings,  such  as  the  Shoe  Shop,  also  have \nrecently  been  converted  into  housing  units. \n16.  The  ECJA  is  used  as  a  detention  facility  by  22 1 \nI \nmunicipalities  in  Essex  County.  It  is  also  used  to  house l \ninmates  sentenced  to  terms  of  imprisonment  in  the  county  jail' l \nI \n, \n-4-\n\nand  also  some  women  inmates  who  are  sentenced  to  and  awaiting ! \nII  \ntransfer  to  state  prison. \n17.  The  ECJA  is  presently  operating  under  the  jUrisdiction I \nof  the  Essex  County  Executive. \n18.  The  Men's  Building,  including  its  West  and  East \nhousing  wings,  was  constructed  in  1875. \nI \n19.  The  New  Wing  was  constructed  in  1923  and  was  closed  in j \n1982  for  structural  and  health  reasons.  Inmates  have  recently \nbeen  housed  in  portions  of  it. \n20.  Most  of  the  ECJA's  permanent  buildings  are  multistory \nmasonry  buildings.  The  physical  plant  in  general,  is  old  (See \n#2).  Some  pipes  are  insulated with  asbestos. \n21.  The  ventilation  and  exhaust  system  as  they  are \ncurrently  operating  are  not  adequate. \n22.  Three  recreation  periods  are  scheduled  each  day  for \ninmates  housed  in  the  main  building  available  for  one  hour  each \nday  for  recreation  from  5  - 7  times  per  week.  The  auditorium  is \nmade  available  to  all  inmates  from  one  full  wing  at  each  time. \nThe  equipment  available  for  active  exercise  in  the  auditorium \nconsists  of  two  weight  machines,  three  pool  tables,  and  several \nexercise  mats.  The  outside  recreation  facilities  provide  four \nhalf  court  basketball  courts.  A  second  outside  recreation  yard , \nI \nis  available  but  is  not  used  because  the  set  of  stairs  leading \nto  it needs  to  be  replaced. \n-5-\n\nI \n! \nI \nI \nHOUSING  AND  LIVING  SPACE \nI \n23.  The  ECJA  had,  until  19B3,  regularly  housed  between  450 :,  \nI \nto  550  inmates,  most  of  whom  were  sentenced  to  County  ja il \nI \nterms.  Since  19B3  the  jail  began  housing  as  many  as  700 ! \nI \ninmates,  approximately  half  of  whom  were  detainees  awaiting \ndisposition  of  criminal  charges. \n24.  In  September  19B6,  an  additional  75  inmates  were  moved \nto  the  Annex. \n25.  Since  November  19B6,  as  many  as  1000  or  more  inmates \nhave  been  housed  at  the  ECJA,  with  additional  inmates  sometimes \nbeing  assigned  to  areas  such  as  the  vestibules  of  the  New  Wing, \nthe  basement  area  of  the  Women's  Building,  formerly  used  for \ncontact  visitation  with  inmate  children,  and  the  old  Shoe  Shop \nwhich  was  renovated  to  accomodate  inmates.  Over  100  more \ninmates  were  moved  to  the  Annex  at  the  end  of  19B6.  The  jail's \nfacilities  are  taxed  by  this  increase  in  inmate  population. \n26.  Areas  deSigned  and  originally  intended  as  housing  for \ninmates,  include  the  following,  with  the  specific  areas \ndescribed  in  subsequent  paragraphs:  144  male  general  population \nI \ncells  in  the  West  Wing  of  the  main  facH i ty;  IBO  beds  in  the \ndormitories  of  the  East  Wing;  120  beds  for  male  inmates  in  the . \nR.C.F.  Modules  opened  in  late  19B2  and  96  beds  in  R.C.F.  MOdules l \nopened  in  late  19B6;  4B  beds  for  male  inmates  in  the l \nI \ndormitory-style  trailers;  and  102  cells  in  the  Women's  Building. \nI \nSome  of  the  cells  and  beds  cannot  be  used  before  remedial  work ! \ni \nII  \nis  performed. \nI \n-6-\nI \nI, \n\n, \nI \n27.  ECJA  inmates  were  originally  housed  in  both  cells  and \n,i  \n! \nI \ndormitory  units.  As  a  result  of  the  increase  in  population, \nhowever,  many  of  the  inmates  are  now  assigned  to  dormitor ies  and \nI \nor ! \ncorridor  areas,  having  to  sleep  on  single  or  double  bunks, \nI \nsometimes  on  army-type  stretchers. \n, \nMEN'S  BUILDING:  WEST  WING \n28.  The  Men's  Building  is  entered  through  a  large  rotunda, \nwhich  serves  as  access  to  the  west  Wing,  the  East  Wing,  a \nHospi tal  Wing,  the  Administrative  Off ices,  the  Mess  Hall  and \nnow,  the  New  Wing. \n29.  The  West  Wing  is  used  to  house  unsentenced  inmates. \nIt  consists  of  four  levels  with  two  tiers  on  each  level;  each \ntier  contains  18  cells,  for  a  total  of  144  cells.  In  addition, \nthere  are  temporary  bunks  and  sometimes  army-type  stretchers \nI \nlayed  out  in  close  proximity  to  one  another  in  the  outside \ncorridors  of  four  of  the  tiers. \n30.  Thirty-six  inmates  are  usually  housed  in  A  and  B-Tier \nand  E  and  F  Tier  of  th~ West  Wing.  Eighteen  inmates  sleep  on \ntemporary  bunks  or  sometimes  stretchers  in  the  dayroom  area  and \nshare  the  toilet  and  sink  in  one  cell  which  is  left  open  for \ntheir  use. \nI \nI \n31.  Housing  inmates  in  the  corridor  areas  affects  the \nI \nliving  conditions  of  all  West  Wing  inmates.  The  stretcher i \nI \nmattresses  they  sometimes  sleep  on  are  cracked;  some  are  ripped ! \n-7-\n\ni \nand  torn.  ' \nj \n32.  During  the  daytime  hours  when  the  corridor  space  is ! \nI \nI \nshared  by  the  inmates  on  bunks  as  well  as  the  inmates  from  the l \ncells,  there  is  less  space  per  \"corridor\"  inmate.  When  inmates I \nare  housed  in  the  corridor,  those  inmates  confined  to  the ,;  \nI \ncellblocks  are  also  affected,  since  the  space  to  which  they  have \naccess  for  6  to  8  hours  a  day  is  also  reduced. \n33.  The  floors  in  the  corridors  of  West  Wing  are \nfrequently  black  with  dirt,  as  are  the  walk-ways  in  front  of  the \nI \ncells.  Roaches,  ants,  flies  and  fleas  are  present  in \nthe l \nWest-Wing  housing  units. \nI \n34.  A  great  many  of  the  standard  size  mattresses  in  the \ncells  are  cracked,  ripped  or  torn,  or  have  open  seams.  More \nsimilar  mattresses,  to  be  used  when  there  is  a  greater \nl \npopulation  increase,  are  stored  on  the  floor  under  the  stairs  in\nthe  West  Wing. \n35.  The  shower  area  walls  are  rusted  and  dirty.  Water \ndrips  from  the  ceiling  above  the  showers.  Black  sl ime  is \npresent  on  the  floors  of  some  showers  which  are  sometimes \nslippery.  Some  shower  areas  are  poorly  lighted.  35  inmates  on \na  tier  share  three  showers.  Not  all  showers  have  functioned  at \nthe  same  time. \n36.  The  washroom  areas,  particularly  the  slop  sinks,  are I \nI \ndirty.  Some  sinks  do  not  work  at  all.  In  some  areas,  the  walls l \nare  rusted  and  cracked. \nI \n-8- , \n, \ni \n! \n\nI \nI \n37.  The  cell  toilets  in  the  West  .  are  ruste d  and ' \nW~ng \ni \ndirty.  Some  cells  also  have  faulty  plumbing.  Some  tOilet ! \nI \nfixtures  splash  out  water  when  flushed.  Toilet water  has  leaked \nthrough  the  ceiling  in  various  places  from  the  tier  above.  Duel \nto  disrepair  there  is  no  running  water  for  some  cell  lavatories \nand  others  leak  continuously.  Approximately  14  inmates  on  bunks \nor  cots  in  each  of  the  corridors  must  share  one  toilet  and  one \nlavatory  in  a  cell  left  unoccupied  for  their  use.  There  is  no \nhot  running  water  in  the  sinks  in  the  cells. \n~. \n40.  A  number  of  long  term,  unrepaired  leaks  in  the  shower \narea  exist. \n41.  The  Corridor  areas  previously  used  exclusively  for \ndayroom  space  now  house  inmates. \nEAST  WING \n42.  The  East  Wing  consists  of  three  identical  levels  of \ntwo  tiers  each.  Each  tier  houses  30  inmates  in  one  14-man  dorm \nand  one  16-man  dorm.  The  Wing  houses  a  total  of  180  beds.  Low \npartitions  divide  the  dorms  into  two-man  booths.  There  is  no \nseparate  day-room  space. \n43.  The  walls  in  the  shower  area  are  dirty.  Paint  is \npeeling  off  the  walls.  Some  walls  are  rusted  through. \n44.  The  shower  room  floors  are  dirty  and  portions  are \nslime  covered. \n45.  There  are  old  restroom  areas  which  are  not  in  use  and \n-9-\n\nhave  been  boarded  up  in  places  by  cardboard  on  each  tier  in  the \nEast  Wing.  Garbage  thrown  in  by  inmates  and  debris  has \naccumulated  in  these  areas  and  has  not  been  removed.  Other \nrestroom  areas  on  the  tier  are  used  by  inmates. \n46.  Some  fixtures  in  the  central  bathrooms  for  the  Tiers . \nl \nof  the  East  Wing  leak.  The  floor  under  the  toilets  is  dirtyand\nslimey. \nNEW  WING \n47.  The  New  Wing  was  closed  in  1982.  It  was  partially \nreoccupied  in  November  1986  and  some  work  has  been  done  on  the \nwing. \n48.  Inmates  have  been  and  remain  housed  on  double  bunks  in \nthe  vestibule  area  of  each  of  the  first  three  floor s .  The \nremaining  area  of  three  floors  are  not  used  because  of  leakage \nfrom  the  outside  roof.  The  fourth  floor  houses  inmates  in  five \ndormitory  areas. \n49.  Each  of  the  three  vestibule  areas,  where  between  18 \nl \nand  30  inmates  can  be  housed,  is  equipped  with  one  toilet  and\ntwo  sinks.  Each  of  these  vestibule  areas  have  been  used  at  the \nI \nsame  time. \n50.  Inmates  in  the  New  Wing  have  used  three  pre-fabricated, \nI \nshower  units  which  were  installed  in  the  first  floor  vestibule \narea.  These  showers  we re  not  connected  up  to  the  building  s \nI  I \nI \ncentral  plumbing. \nI \nI \nI \nI \n-10-\n! \n\nI' \nI \nI \n51.  There  are  leaks  in  the  heating  and  plumbing  pipes. \nMEN'S  FOOD  SERVING  AREA \n52.  There  are  holes  and  broken  tiles  on  the  floor  of  the \nmen's  food  serving  area.  The  pipes,  insulation  and  areas  of  the ! \nfloor  of  the  food  preparation  area  are  dirty.  There  are  exposed I \nhot  steam  pipes.  The  kitchen  sink  sometimes  leaks  and  pans  have \nbeen  placed  beneath  it to  catch  the  leaking  water. \n53.  Both  steam  tables  in  the  food  se rv ing  area  of  the \ndining  room  had  rags  for  drain  plugs.  The  insulation  on  the \npipe  that  leads  to  the  steam  kettle  in  the  dining  room  is  dirty \nand  has  begun  to  deteriorate.  Old  rags  had  been  wrapped  around I \npart  of  the  pipe. \n54.  The  scrape-table  drain  leaks,  sometimes  causing  dirty \nwater  to  accumulate  on  the  floor.  The  floor  drain  sometimes \nbacks  up  near  the  serving  area.  The  floor  area  is  dirty  and \nsometimes  has  an  odor  of  sewage.  There  are  missing  and  broken \nfloor  tiles. \n55.  There  is  a  black,  sticky  substance  on  the  floor  of  the \nfood  storeroom.  The  black  substance  also  coats  the  wooden \npallets.  In  the  canned  goods  storage  area,  there  is  a  white \nsubstance  on  the  floor  under  and  behind  the  pallets.  water I \nsometimes  seeps  in  through  the  wall  in  the  canned  goods  area. \nI \nThe  cooler  system  has  frosted  up.  The  ice  machines  and  the \nwalk-in  cooler  in  the  kitchen  have  been  dirty,  slimy  and  moldy.  I \nI \n-11-\n\nI \n! \n56.  The  floor  and  slop  sink  in  the  food  service  garbage ! \nI \nroom  are  dirty.  The  ceiling  is  dirty,  slimey  and  damp,  in  some \ni \nspots,  has  patches  of  mold.  Opposite  the  slop  sink,  the  mortar ! \nhas  broken  loose  between  the  file,  and  some  dirty  water  lays  in ! \ni \nthe  cracks.  There  are  uncapped  sewer  pipes  in  the  bathroom ; \nI \nI \nbetween  the  kitchen  and  the  mess  hall  that  is  used  by  the  food \nservice  workers. \n57.  Portions  of  the  dining  area  have  an  offensive  odor. \nRoaches  and  other  insects  are  also  present. \nMEDICAL  UNIT \nc, 1 \n58.  The  medical  unit  consists  of  three  wards,  A,  Band \nI \nand  three  isolation  cells.  These  wards  house  ill inmates. \n59.  Some  of  the  beds  have  broken  springs.  The  walls  are \ndirty  and  there  is  grit  on  the  floor.  One  window  is  broken  and \ndoes  not  have  a  screen. \n60.  A  toilet  fixture  has  been  removed  from  the  restroom\nl \narea  of  Ward  C,  leaving  a  large  open  hole  in  one  wall  resulting \nin  an  uncapped  sewer-pipe.  Sewer  gas  escapes.  The  floor  of  the \ni \ntoilet  area  is  dirty  and  the  lavatory  drain  line  leaks.  There\nis  a  leak  in  the  toilet  facility.  One  of  the  pipes  in  the  pipe \nchase  area  serving  Ward  C  is  uncapped.  The  water  supply  pipe \nI \nI \nfor  the  toilet  in  Ward  C,  Isolation  Cell  3  has  a  leak. \nj \nI \nI \nI \nWOMEN'S  BUILDING \nI \n61.  The  Women's  Building  of  the  ECJA  consists  of  three ; \n-12-\ni \nI, \n\n,I  \nlevels  with  two  tiers  of  17  cells  in  each  tier,  for  a  total  of , \nI \n102  one-woman  cells,  two  of  which  are  not  being  used.  It  has : \ni \nits  own  dining  facility.  The  top  and  bottom  tiers  have  outside ; \n! \ncorridors,  in  addition  to  the  walk-ways  in  front  of  the  cells. \n, \nI \n62.  The  corridors  were  originally  intended  to  be  used  as : \nI \nI \ndaytime  activity  space,  but  are  now  used  to  house  additional \ninmates  sleeping  on  cots  or  double-bunks. \n63.  Towards  the  end  of  1986,  24  male  inmates  were  confined \nin  the  basement  area,  once  used  for  contact  visits with  children \nof  the  women  inmates. \n64.  Housing  inmates  in  the  corridor  area  of  the  Women's \nbuilding  continues.  It  affects  all  women  inmates  including \nthose  not  assigned  to  bunks  in  the  corridors  by  limiting  their \ndaytime  space. \n65.  There  are  no  lockers  for  clothing  and  the  women  hang i, \nclothing  on  the  walls  and  bars  of  their  cells.  Other \npossessions  are  stored  under  the  beds. \n66.  Some  floors  of  the  cells  and  dayroom  areas  are  dirty \nand  sticky. \n67.  The  toilet  bowls  and  toilet  flush-buttons  in  many  of \nthe  cells  leak  and  are  in  need  of  repair.  When  some  of  the \ntoilets  are  flushed,  water  sprays  onto  the  toilet  seat.  The , \nI \nwater  closet  walls  in  most  of  the  cells  are  rusted;  some  have \ni \nholes  and  cracks. \n68.  Many  beds  have  torn  or  cracked  mattresses. \n-13-\n\ni \nII \n69.  Women  on  cots  and  on  double-bunks  in  the  corridors  of \nthe  first  and  third  floors  share  toilets  and  lavatories  in  cells ; \n! \non  each  floor  kept  empty  for  such  use.  At  times,  up  to  30  women ! \nI \ni \nshare  the  lavatory  facilities  in  the  two  empty  cells.  The l \nlavatory  has  been  stopped  up  sometimes  and  drains  slowly.  There i \nI \nis  no  hot  running  water  in  the  sinks  of  the  cells. \n70.  The  shower  areas  in  the  Women's  Building  are \nsometimes '\\ \ndirty.  There  are  leaks  that  have  formed  stalactites.  There  are \nholes  around  the  fixtures  of  the  shower.  When  the  shower  is \nused,  water  accumulates  on  the  ceiling  and  then  drips  down  onto \nthe  heads  of  the  women  using  it.  Some  of  the  showers  have  poor \ndrainage.  The  inmates  cannot  control  the  temperature  of  the \nwater.  The  water  sometimes  becomes  unbearably  hot.  Water I \nsometimes  leaks  down  to  the  floor  below.  ! \n71.  Some  electric  junction  boxes  in  the  shower  areas  are \nwet  and  rusted,  as  are  some  electrical  conduits. \n72.  There  is  an  open  lavatory  drain  leaking  in  the  pipe \nchase  area  of  the  Women's  Building.  60%  to  75%  of  the  toilets \nof  the  Women's  facility  do  not  have  vacuum  breakers. \n73.  There  are  a  number  of  holes  in  the  lavatory  drain  in \nI \nthe  pipe  chase  area.  Some  of  the  vent  pipes  have  been  rusted \nthrough,  leaving  gaps  of  up  to  1  1/2  inches.  Several  of  the i \nplugs  on  top  of  the  \"T's\"  for  some  pipes  in  the  pipe  chase  are \nmissing.  There  is  water  on  the  floor  of  the  pipe  chase  at  the : \nI \nTier  A and  B  level.  I \n! \n! \n-14- j \n, \n\n'I,  \n74.  In  Tier  D  of  the  Women's  Bu ild ing,  stalagmites  are ; \nI \ni \ngrowing  up  from  the  top  of  the  cover  of  the  cell  opening \nmechanisms  located  in  the  corridor.  The  stalagmites  are  caused i \nI \nby  leaking  plumbing  above  the  corridor. \n! \n75.  There  are  many  broken  windows  and  missing  screens  in \nTier  D  of  the  Women's  Building.  Some  of  the  window  panes  on \nTiers  A and  B  are  old  and  lose. \n'.:,., \n76.  The  number  of  inmates  limits  the  ability  of  the  women \ninmates  to  utilize  the  corridors  for  daytime  functions. \n77.  There  is  no  mechanical  ventilation  in  the  women's \nbuilding  except  the  kitchen. \n78.  There  is  no  library,  although  law  books  are  available. \nThe  books  are  located  in  a  room  that  is  used  for  inmate \ninterviews  with  their  lawyers  and  social  workers.  They  are  in \nno  particular  order  and  are  not  indexed  or  otherwise  organized. \nR.C.F.  MODULES \n79.  The  modules  consist  of  a  central  corridor  area,  a \ndining  facility  and  five  living  units.  Tiers  A,  B,  D  and  E  are \naccessible  from  the  central  area  through  locked  doors.  Tiers  AI \nI \nand  E  each  house  24  inmates  and  each  consists  of  four  dorms  and \na  central  dayroom.  Tiers  B,  C  and  D  each  house  24  inmates  and \nI! \neach  have  12  cells. \n80.  Double  bunks  exist  in  each  unit. \n81.  Many  of  the  mattresses  used  by  inmates  in  the  R .. C.F. i \nI \nI \nI \nI \n, \n-15-\nI \nI \n, \n\nare  cracked  and  have  staph  check  type  covering. \n82.  The  showers  in  the  Modules  are  sometimes  dirty  i \nand \nmoldy. \ni \n83.  24  inmates  on  each  tier  share  a  shower.  There  is  a \nI \nwhite  film  on  the  doors  and  walls. \n! \n84.  There  is  one  outside  recreation  yard  for  all  five \nmodules.  It  is not  used  in  cold  or  inclement  weather. \n85.  In  mid-November  1986,  a  new  Module  was  completed  and \nan  additional  96  inmates  are  similarly  confined  there  in \nconditions  similar  to  those  described  in  paragraphs  75  to  80. \nSTATE  TRAILERS \n86.  Inmates  are  also  confined  in  six  dormitory-style \ntrailers  that  house  up  to  10  inmates  each.  One  end  of  each \ntrailer  opens  onto  a  shared  central  area.  Unlike  the  Modules, \nthere  is  no  locked  door  between  the  central  area  and  the \ntrailers. \nOTHER  HOUSING  AREAS \n87.  The  old  Shoe  Shop  has  been  converted  into  a  dormitory \nand  sometimes  is  used  to  house  work  release  inmates.  Up  to  28 \ninmates  there  all  share  a  shower,  two  working  toilets  and  four \nsinks.  Inmates  had  at  one  time  been  housed  in  the  old  Paint I \nShop. \n-16-\n\n, \n, \n'I \n,iI   \n! \nI \nEMERGENCY  PROCEDURES \nI \ni \n88.  Permanent  staff  is  trained  in  emergency  procedures.  Ai \nI \nlarge  majority  of  the  new  employees  are  classified  as  temporary ! \ni \nor  probationary.  These  employees  are  not  given  the  correctional !,  \nofficers  training  course  which  includes  emergency  management. \nThese  employees  receive  on  the  job  training. \n89.  There  is one  exit  for  each  of  the  tiers  in  the  Women's \nBuilding.  as  well  as  each  of  the  tiers  in  the  West  Wing  of  the \nMen's  Building.  All  of  these  tiers  open  onto  a  central \nstairway.  There  is also  one  exit  for  the  hospital  wing.  In  the \nEast  Wing  of  the  Men's  Building  there  is  an  alternate  exit  on \nthe  third  floor.  which  leads  to  the  auditorium.  The  door \nleading  to  the  auditorium  is  adjacent  to  the  central  stairway. \n90.  There  is  no  central  fire  or  smoke  detection  system  in \nthe  main  facility.  There  is  no  fire  alarm  pull  station  located \nin  or  near  the  main  kitchen  area. \nHEALTH  CARE \n91.  When  an  inmate  is  admitted  for  incarceration  at  the \nECJA.  he  or  she  is  asked  his  or  her  medical  history  by  a  nurse l \nor  correction  officer.  The  inmate  is  then  placed  in  general \npopulation. \n92.  Pregnancy  tests  are  not  routinely  given  to  female \ninmates  but  can  be  requested. \nI \n93.  Medical  examinations.  including  blood  tests  for I \n-17-\n\ni \nI \nI \ni \nI \nI  I \ni \ni \ncommunicable  diseases,  contagious  conditions  or  other  serious ! \nI \nhealth  problems  are  given  within  a  few  days  after  an  inmate  s \nI \nadmission  although  sometimes  not  for  several  weeks.  I \ni \nPERSONAL  HYGEINE \n94.  Mattresses  are  not  cleaned  or  sanitized  between  users. \n95.  Each  inmate  on  most  occasions  is  issued  one  towel  upon \nadmission.  Inmates  are  issued  one  uniform  upon  admission. \nTowels  and  jail  uniforms  are  laundered  weekly.  The  practice  is \nto  issue  a  clean  uniform  when  the  soiled  one  is  sent  for \ncleaning  although  sometimes  there  are  not  enough  uniforms  to  go \naround. \n96.  Personal  hygeine  items  such  as  soap,  shampoo, \ntoothpaste,  toothbrushes,  and  razors  are  issued  to  inmates  that \nare  indigent.  Other  inmates  can  buy  these  items  at  the \ncommissary.  Sometimes  these  items  are  in  short  supply  and \ntherefore  not  available  for  both  the  indigents  and  the  other \ninmates  who  buy  at  the  commissary. \n-18-\n\ni \nThe  undersigned  hereby  consent  to  the  form  and  entry  of  the I \nwithin  Stipulation  of  fact. \nI \nAlfred  A.

Gary Mitchell, Dept. of Public Advocate, Trenton, N.J., for plaintiffs.\nJoseph T. Maloney, Deputy Atty. Gen., Trenton, N.J., for Fauver.\nOPINION\nHAROLD A. ACKERMAN, District Judge.\nThis litigation has had a painful and protracted history. This class action has been brought on behalf of the\ninmates of the Essex County jail against various Essex County officials and the New Jersey Commissioner of\nCorrections. Plaintiffs have sought relief from overcrowding and other objectionable conditions of confinement\nwhich have arisen as a result of the over-crowding. The parties come before the Court now on plaintiffs'\napplication for an order to show cause as to why the defendants should not be held in contempt for violating the\nterms of the Third Supplemental Consent Order (\"SCO3\"), which is an order of this Court.\nI note that as an initial matter, the fact that SCO3 is a consent decree does nothing to minimize the obligation of\nthe parties to adhere to the Court's decision. In fact, in stipulating to the terms under which sanctions are to be\nimposed, the county unequivocally acknowledged that conditions at the Essex County jail and annex are\nunconstitutional and that the remedies which plaintiffs seek to have imposed are appropriate ones. In an\nanalogous situation, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that\nThe respect due the federal judgment is not lessened because the judgment was entered by\nconsent. The plaintiff's suit alleged a denial of their constitutional rights. When the defendants\nchose to consent to a judgment, rather than have the district court adjudicate the merits of the\nplaintiffs' claims the result was a fully enforceable federal judgment that overrides any conflicting\n541 state law or state court order. The strong policy encouraging *541 the settlement of cases requires\nthat the terms of a consent judgment, once approved by a federal court, be respected as fully as a\njudgment after trial.\nBadgley v. Santacroce, 800 F.2d 33, 38 (2nd Cir.1986),cert. denied,479 U.S. 1067, 107 S.Ct. 955, 93 L.Ed.2d\n1003 (1987). This Appellate Court observance informs my decision today. Before detailing that decision, it is\nnecessary to restate the action's background and the nature of the current application before me.\nBACKGROUND\nIn 1982, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 53, I appointed two special masters to whom I referred this\nmatter for an evaluation of the conditions at the Essex County Jail. Their reports as well as the parties'\nstipulations reveal a facility that was, and still is, taxed to the breaking point. For nearly every day of 1982 to the\npresent, the County defendants have housed substantially more than the 594-inmate cap. Overcrowding has\ncaused these inmates to be housed in the dayrooms and has cut into the defendants' ability to provide the hour\nof exercise mandated by the terms of the consent order. Smoke detectors and alarms are inoperable. Mattresses\n\nare unsanitary and no longer fire-retardant, they are often cracked and torn. Inmates are not receiving weekend\nvisits of at least 20 minutes in duration. A number of inmates fail to receive a physical examination within 72\nhours of admission, a situation which also leads to housing of these unexamined inmates with the general\npopulation. Reliable logs of housing assignments are not maintained. Consequently, it is often difficult, if not\nimpossible, to find inmates once they have entered the system or for the jail to receive accurate, timely\ninformation as to their bail status.\nThe initial agreement, which was presented to this Court on October 18, 1982 set a maximum inmate capacity of\n594 effective July 1 1983. It is this population cap agreed to over six years ago which has still not been met, and\nwhich is a focus of today's proceeding. In the 1982 accord, the County also agreed to provide certain services\npertaining to the conditions indicated above.\nOn February 4, 1985, the County defendants, admitting that the facilities and services were \"insufficient to meet\nthe terms\" of the original consent judgment, was given until May 1, 1985 to develop and implement a plan to\nprovide additional housing and improve services at the jail.\nAs a result of the County's failure to comply with the terms of these orders, and after several days of hearings,\nthe parties reached an agreement which was ultimately incorporated into a second supplemental consent order,\nentered on April 27, 1987. The County was again given time, until January 1, 1988, to meet the 594-inmate\npopulation cap. Under the agreement, the County agreed that violations of the cap would trigger automatic\nsanctions.\nIn 1987, the plaintiffs asserted that the defendants had yet to comply with the above-described orders. After\nfurther hearings and an on-site inspection of the Essex County facility by the special masters (but prior to the\nCourt's decision regarding the masters' July 26, 1988 recommendation that the County defendants be held in\ncontempt and sanctioned), the parties entered into the Third Supplemental Consent Order which was filed on\nDecember 27, 1988. In that order, as in its two forerunners, the County defendants acknowledged that \"inmate\nhousing and services continue to be insufficient to meet the terms of the previous consent orders.\"\nIn light of this admission, the plaintiffs agreed to defer prosecution of the contempt application to permit the\nCounty to implement measures to finally reduce the population to 594-inmates and to achieve substantial\ncompliance with the other provisions of the prior orders of this Court. SCO3 specifically reserved plaintiffs' right to\npursue a contempt application and seek sanctions if the jail population was not reduced to 700 inmates by\nFebruary 15, 1989, 650 inmates by April 15, 1989 and 594 inmates by June 1, 1989. The precise language is as\nfollows:\n542 *542 Counsel for the plaintiff class agrees to defer prosecution of the application on behalf of\nplaintiffs to have the County defendants held in contempt for a period commencing on December\n1, 1988 and ending on May 31, 1989, in order to permit the County defendants to implement\nmeasures as described above which the County defendants believe will result in a substantial and\nswift reduction of the County Jail population to 594 and which similarly will permit the County\ndefendants to achieve substantial compliance with other provisions of the prior Orders of the\nCourt; provided, however, that within the period referenced above plaintiffs' counsel shall be\npermitted to resume prosecution of the contempt application in the manner provided by this Order\nand to seek sanctions as authorized by this Order if the total population by February 15, 1989, is\nnot reduced to or thereafter exceeds 700 inmates, or if the total jail population by April 15, 1989, is\nnot reduced to or thereafter exceeds 650 inmates, or if the total jail population by June 1, 1989, is\nnot reduced to or thereafter exceeds 594 inmates.\nSCO3 ยถ 1.\nThe County defendants, recognizing that promises to the plaintiff class have been \"long delayed\" and would be\nfurther delayed by SCO3, were \"on notice\" that alternatives to the jail initiative, the County's own program to\nreduce overcrowding, must be contemplated in order to reach and maintain the population cap. See ยถ 2-4 SCO3.\nThe County defendants specifically recognized that \"prompt proceedings to impose and compel payment of\nsanctions\" would ensue if the County's noncompliance was not rectified.\n\nIn fact, SCO3 sets forth a specific agenda regarding fines, and the County defendants waived any right to be\nheard on whether or not sanctions should be imposed, except in situations where the County was faced with an\nemergency such as a fire, a disaster, or a riot. Specifically excluded from SCO3 are any fluctuations in the inmate\npopulation associated with, e.g., criminal justice practices, prosecutional policies, law enforcement activities,\nchanges in sentencing plans, or the reduction or termination of County program concerning pretrial release or\nnoncustodial disposition alternatives. The County defendants also agreed not to contest the specific figures that\nthe masters recommend. See ยถ 20 SCO3.\nAs indicated above, the 594-inmate population cap was to be achieved through a series of interim reductions. In\nApril 1989, the masters filed a report and recommendation addressed to plaintiff's allegations that the County had\nstill not fulfilled the population or recreation requirements00in other words, that the terms of the SCO3 were not\n97\nbeing met. On May 10, 1989, this Court found that \"defendants had failed to meet the timetable for the population\nreduction\" and pursuant to ยถ 20 of SCO3 the Court imposed sanctions. At that time I stated, \"I find that sanctions\nare particularly appropriate in light of defendants' repeated violation of the orders of the court\" (p. 17 Opinion). As\ndefendants and plaintiffs both know, the sanction money has been used to create a bail fund program pursuant to\nthe terms of ยถ 22(b) of SCO3.\nOn May 10, I declined to impose sanctions for the defendants' failure to comply with the recreation requirements\nof the December 1988 order, see ยถ 19b(1) & (2) of the SCO3 which states,\nb. Exercise and recreation\n(1) Schedule00By Feb. 1, 1989, the County shall submit to plaintiffs' counsel and the Special\n97\nMasters a proposed gym schedule that will fulfill its obligations under prior orders to provide each\ninmate at the jail with access to an exercise and recreation area for a minimum of one hour each\nday. The County shall take all steps necessary to implement this schedule so that inmates shall\nreceive the required daily opportunity for exercise by April 15, 1989, including but not limited to\nphysical construction of facilities, acquisition of equipment, and hiring of additional staff.\n(2) Supplemental Exercise Equipment Outside Dayrooms00Within 30 days of the date of this\n97\n543 agreement, the *543 County shall obtain the items of exercise equipment previously required by\nparagraph 12(c)(3) of the SCO1.\nI took judicial notice at that time of the County's failure to comply with the recreation schedule to which both\nparties had agreed. In so doing, I stated that \"failure to obtain the equipment within 30 days may result in\nsanctions.\" I further ordered defendants to begin to comply with the gym schedule immediately and to \"establish\na record-keeping system for monitoring availability and usage of the recreation program\" (see pgs. 19 & 20 of\nOrder May 10). I concluded my discussion of the recreation issue by saying that, \"failure to establish such a\nsystem by June 1, 1989 will result in sanctions\" (p. 20 opinion, emphasis added).\nTHE PENDING APPLICATION\nRegrettably, the matter is once again before this Court upon plaintiffs' Application for an Order to Show Cause as\nto why the most recent report of the masters regarding the population at the facility and the provision of\nrecreational opportunities should not be adopted by the Court. The masters' report, dated September 19, 1989,\nwas filed in response to plaintiff's application to hold the County and State defendants in contempt.\nThe masters found that the County's violations of the Consent Order were \"massive,\" and that defendants have\nconfronted this Court with virtually the same kind of noncompliance with the terms of the SCO3 that necessitated\nmy May 10th decision and the concomitant sanctions.\nIn their report, the masters observed that the County defendants have failed to meet the population reduction,\nboth with regard to the overall inmate population and the population within certain housing units. Further, the\nmasters reported that the defendants have not contended that this failure is due to an emergency situation. In\n\nshort, per the masters, defendants have failed to identify any circumstances that would constitute a defense to\nthis breach.\nAccording to the masters, the parties have stipulated to the fact that the County defendants have violated the\n594-inmate population cap every single day from June 1, 1989 through October 13, 1989 for a total of 14,768\nprisoner days over the cap. See ยถ 6 of SCO3 which states\nfor nearly every day of 1988 to the present, the County defendants have housed substantially\nmore than 594 inmates at the E.C.J.\nAs a result, the masters have recommended that the defendants be held in contempt and fined a total of\n$1,905,300.00. See pages 9 and 10 of the masters' report. The figures in the masters report run only through\nAugust 31, 1989. However, at our October 10, 1989 hearing, the parties stipulated to the figures this Court has\nused today.\nThe parties also stipulated to figures showing that from June 1, 1989 through October 13, 1989 the County\nexceeded the maximum capacity limits fixed for individual housing units in ยถ 10 of the 1982 consent judgment.\nThe County exceeded the individual housing caps for a total of 4,285 prisoner days over cap and the masters\nrecommended sanctions of $428,500.00.\nThe masters further reported that during the June 1, 1989 through September 30, 1989 period, there were 76,069\noccasions when inmates were denied their daily hour-long opportunity for recreation, a direct violation of ยถ 19b(1)\nof SCO3. See excerpt supra. The masters further found that the County had failed to install tier-level recreation\nequipment, which is also mandated by ยถ 19b(2) of SCO3. For these deficiencies, the masters also recommended\nthe imposition of sanctions. The masters suggested a fine of $20.00 per day for every inmate who was denied a\nrecreational hour for a total fine of $1,521,380.00. The plaintiffs have recommended a sanction of $100.00 per\ninmate per recreation hour denied. I will discuss this recommendation infra.\nThe masters suggested that pursuant to ยถ 20(b) the monies from the population fines be placed in the bail fund.\nAt this point, I might add that the masters' calculations regarding population fines was based upon a figure of\n544 $100.00 per day per *544 inmate, which was the sum that the parties agreed upon in the event of a population\nviolation. See Addendum to SCO3 and ยถ 20(d) of SCO3 which provides that\nThe parties to this case having agreed in ยถ 20(d) of SCO3 that the special masters shall set an\namount of a fine as a population sanction in the event of certain violations of said SCO3, and this\nCourt having reviewed and approved said Third Supplemental Consent Order; and the masters\nhaving recommended the Supplemental Consent Order, and the masters having recommended\nthe amount of $100.00 per prisoner per day as the proper sanction;\nIT IS on this 27th day of December 19, 1988,\nORDERED that in the event of violations of the SCO3 as set forth therein in ยถ 20, the sanction to\nbe imposed, is referred to in ยถ 20d, shall be calculated at the rate of $100.00 per prisoner per day.\nThe masters have also suggested that an automatic system whereby the fines are calculated, collected, and paid\ninto the bail fund on a weekly basis is advisable at this juncture.\nThe masters have also recommended that the County defendants' recreational fine of $1,521,380.00 be\ndeposited into an interest bearing account to be known as the Recreation Improvement Fund. Monies from that\nfund would be used to hire an expert who would research and report on recreational opportunities at the jail and\nhow best to effectuate the requirement that every inmate be afforded one hour of recreation per day. The masters\nfurther suggested that any future fines be calculated on a weekly basis and paid automatically into the Recreation\nImprovement Fund.\nFor their part, plaintiffs agree with many of the masters' recommendations. Plaintiffs ask this Court to adopt the\nmasters' contempt findings and population sanctions. With regard to recreation, the plaintiffs seek adoption of the\nmasters' findings that the County has failed to provide an opportunity for one hour of exercise per inmate and that\nthe County has failed to install and maintain the supplemental equipment. Plaintiffs seek some modification in the\n\nrecreational fines00 plaintiffs ask for a $100.00 fine per inmate for the failure to provide the daily hour of\n97\nrecreation, with some small portion of that fine to be designated as compensatory. Plaintiffs further request that a\n$20.00 fine per inmate per day be instituted for defendants' failure to provide and maintain supplemental exercise\nequipment. Again, plaintiffs ask that a small portion of that fine be designated as compensatory. Plaintiffs reiterate\ntheir request that the County maintain records to identify which inmates were provided an opportunity for gym use\nand which inmates were not.\nIn response to these requests, the County defendants have argued that they should not be held in contempt or\nsanctioned in light of the establishment of the bail fund. Defendants further assert that compliance is impossible\ngiven the expansion of the inmate population. With respect to the issue of the exercise equipment and recreation,\nthe County defendants have asserted that they have made a good faith effort to comply with both the consent\njudgment and this Court's order and thus the County can not be held liable.\nDISCUSSION\nRule 53(e)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure states in part that\nIn an action to be tried without a jury the Court shall accept the master's findings of facts unless\nclearly erroneous.... The court after hearing may adopt the report or may modify it or may reject it\nin whole or in part or may receive further evidence or may recommit it with instructions.\nSee Kyriazi v. Western Electric Co., 647 F.2d 388, 396 (3d Cir.1981). I shall review the Masters' report and\nrecommendation that I hold the defendants in contempt and impose sanctions with this standard in mind and in\nlight of the developments since the presentation of their report to this Court.\nMy authority to impose sanctions arises from two separate sources. First, I may impose sanctions as an act of\n545 enforcing the agreement between the plaintiffs *545 and County defendants. See Local 93 v. City of Cleveland,\n478 U.S. 501, 106 S.Ct. 3063, 3076, 92 L.Ed.2d 405 (1986). When viewed as such, the decision to impose\nsanctions is simply a matter of construing and apply the agreement. See, e.g., Sansom Committee by Cook v.\nLynn, 735 F.2d 1535, 1539 (3d Cir.),cert. denied, sub nom., Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania v.\nSansom Committee, 469 U.S. 1017, 105 S.Ct. 431, 83 L.Ed.2d 358 (1984). Second, an imposition of sanctions\ncan be viewed as a penalty for contempt for failure to abide by a judgment, signed by the Court00a judgment\n97\nwhich establish clear norms of conduct for the County defendants and notice of penalties for nonperformance. \nSee Inmates of Allegheny County Jail v. Wecht, 754 F.2d 120, 128-29 (3d Cir.1985),citing, inter alia, Granny\nGoose Foods Inc. v. Local 70, 415 U.S. 423, 94 S.Ct. 1113, 39 L.Ed.2d 435 (1974). In this case, I find that the\nparties have entered into an agreement which provides that the violation of its terms shall result in the imposition\nof sanctions. Moreover, as their agreement is embodied in an order of this Court, violation of the order triggers\nthe Court's authority to impose sanctions for noncompliance.\nIn upholding the imposition of sanctions and, ultimately, the district court's order that a plan for the construction of\na new jail facility be provided, the Third Circuit, in an opinion written by Chief Judge Gibbons observed that, \"we\nmade it clear, however, that the district court had the power to order such a plan.\" Inmates of Allegheny County\nJail v. Wecht, 874 F.2d 147, 152 (3d Cir.1989). In grounding this authority, Chief Judge Gibbons observed that,\norders to responsible public officials to prepare and submit plans for remedying constitutional\nviolations are not uncommon.... [i]n the prisoner context the courts have the authority to order\nlocal officials to take costly measures to cure violations.\nWecht, supra, at 150. Moreover, the Chief Judge opined that \"when the totality of conditions in a jail violates the\nconstitution a district court need not confine itself to the elimination of specific conditions. Rather, the nature of\nthe overall violation determines the permissible scope of an effective remedy.\" Wecht, supra, at 153 and cases\ncited therein. Hence, my authority to impose sanctions and to issue an order to remedy the violations is firmly\nestablished in the law of this Circuit, as well the parties own consensual agreement which was incorporated into\nthe order of this Court.\n\nIn light of their failure to maintain the agreed upon cap, the consent order provides that such noncompliance \"will\nresult in prompt proceedings to impose and compel payment of sanctions ...\" See ยถ 2 of the SCO3. Relatedly, ยถ\n20 provides that\nThe County defendants shall have until the dates set forth ... [above] to reduce the population of\nthe jail to the interim levels therein specified and to reach the ultimate maximum capacity of 594\ninmates.... Any failure to meet those requirements or thereafter maintain the jail population at 594\nor less inmates, or any failure thereafter to adhere to the housing unit capacity limits, shall result in\nthe following:\na. If the population of the jail is not 594 or less, sanctions shall, as previously agreed by the\nCounty defendants in Paragraph 3 of the [second supplemental consent order], attach\nautomatically to any continued noncompliance with the 594 capacity limit....\nc. ... the sanctions authorize[d] ... for violations of the 594 capacity limit ... shall be based on a\ndaily amount for each inmate confined in excess of the overall 594 capacity....\nHence, under the terms of the agreement, automatic daily sanctions are to be imposed for each inmate housed at\nthe facility over the 594-inmate cap in the amount of $100 per inmate per day. See the addendum to the\nsupplemental consent order.\nIn my decision of May 10th I found that,\nSanctions are particularly appropriate in light of defendants' repeated violation of the order of this\ncourt. Thus, for violations of the cap and to deter future disobeyance of orders of this court I shall\n546 sanction the county. *546See p. 17, May 10th Opinion. Defendants continue to repeatedly violate\nthe orders of this Court and the terms of the consent judgment, despite my hope that the May 10th\nsanctions would deter the County from future violations. The County has, by its own admission,\nhoused inmates in excess of the population count and once again violated the law. Thus, for\nviolations of the cap on population both in overall inmate population and in specific housing areas,\nI find the County in violation and I shall sanction them according to the terms of the SCO3. The\nstipulated figures that run through October 13, 1989 result in a total fine of $1,905,300.00 with\n$1,476,800.00 due to the overall population violation and $428,500.00 ascribed to the specific\nhousing violations. (See attached figures, Addendum 1 and 2 to this opinion).\nThe County's defense to their acknowledged violation of the consent judgment of this Court simply cannot stand.\nIn the first place, good faith verbal efforts to rectify the unconstitutional conditions, do not nullify defendants'\npersistent violation of a court order and their continued exposure of the plaintiff class to constitutionally infirm\n[1]\nconditions.  In this regard, courts have found that even commencing construction of a new jail facility which, to\na great degree, will establish compliance with the goals of an overcrowding stipulation does not warrant a\nmodification in the finding that the current facility is inadequate and can no longer accept prisoners. In Morales\nFeliciano v. Hernandez-Colon, 672 F.Supp. 627, 637 (D.P.R.1987), the district court found that\nSincere thorough and effective efforts to comply with court orders are nothing more than what the\nlaw expects. The attempt to transform these efforts into relief from the underlying duty is\nunseemly.\nSee also Inmates of Allegheny County Jail v. Wecht, 573 F.Supp. 454 (W.D.Pa. 1983). At issue in this matter is\nnothing resembling the partially completed construction of a new facility described in Feliciano. Instead,\ndefendants urge that the court's own prior finding of contempt nullifies their continued noncompliance and that\nthe bail fund exempts defendants from the independent need to maintain the population at or below cap.\nThe sanctions out of which the bail fund grew are drawn from a prior contempt finding. As such, they are not\ndirected towards the County's subsequent violation of SCO3. Moreover, this court recognizes that the bail fund is\na stop-gap measure. In this regard, Judge Cohill, in imposing a somewhat similar release program, wrote\n\nSo long as this emergency exists an arbitrary formula for the release of prisoners will have to be\nutilized ... In no way should this opinion and order be construed by the defendants as reason for\nthem to relax their efforts. It is the duty of the County to house prisoners, and any release of\nprisoners should be recognized as a final, albeit temporary, effort to ameliorate the situation, not\nas a solution to the problem.\nInmates v. Wecht, 573 F.Supp. at 57. Here, too the Court will tolerate no relaxation on the County's part.\nDefendants' representation that compliance with the court order and the terms of their own consensual\nagreement is literally impossible fails to satisfy the requirements for impossibility as they are defined in the\nrelevant caselaw and portions of the consent decree. In upholding sanctions against the Allegheny County\ndefendants, the appellate court addressed defendants' contention that they were unable to comply with the terms\nof the order as follows,\n547 *547 The ... defense of inability to comply, however, refers to physical impossibility beyond the\ncontrol of the alleged contention. The orders in question were directed to all the defendants, and\nthe suggestion that it was physically impossible for Allegheny County to obey the order in the\nrespects in which they were held to be in contempt is sophistical. The County officials simply\nchose to take no steps to provide the warden and his staff with the wherewithal to comply. Such\nconduct exposes the party responsible to contempt.\nWecht, supra, at 152, citing Halderman v. Pennhurst State School & Hospital, 673 F.2d 628, 639 (3rd Cir.1982).\nHere, too, defendants are not physically barred from meeting their obligations. Rather, through inactivity they\nhave blatantly chosen to remain in contempt of a court order and to ignore the plain language of their own\nagreement.\nSCO3 explicitly defines what constitutes an emergency and hence a permissible violation of the population caps.\nThere has been no such emergency here, nor any allegation of one on the part of defendants. As the SCO3 set\nforth\nFor an emergency to constitute the basis for mitigation of sanctions under this paragraph, the\nwarden shall provide immediate telephone notice to plaintiffs' counsel of the emergency declared.\nWith 24 hours thereafter, written notice shall be provided, setting forth the reason for the\nemergency, its expected duration, the total number of inmates housed at the E.C.J., the number of\ninmates added by the emergency to the E.C.J., the locations in which these inmates have been\nhoused, and the expected impact on conditions, services or programs available to other inmates.\nยถ 20(f)(2) SCO3. The defendants have not only offered any nonwaived defense to their violation of the population\nrequirements of the consent order, but also have not observed any of the applicable procedures.\nThe record in this case demonstrates that despite all the written, consensual undertakings on the part of the\nCounty defendants, they have not yet spent a single dime towards alleviating the critical housing problem facing\nthe Essex County Jail facility, which defendants themselves recognize unequivocally and which they themselves\nmust seek to correct. There has been considerable posturing on the part of County defendants, but there has\nbeen no meaningful action. County defendants have referred to the proposed construction of a new facility, but\nany new facility is at least 4 or 5 years down the road. No action has been taken regarding the manifest problems\nfacing the county today. As pointed out earlier in this Opinion, the substantial fines that are being levied today can\nand must be laid at the feet of the County defendants00they made the promises; they did not keep them.\n97\nIt is the degree and constancy of the overpopulation violations that have led the special masters to suggest that a\nself-executing system be implemented, whereby any population over cap automatically triggers the appropriate\nfine. At this time, I am reluctant to impose such a system; although past history might indicate that it would be a\nprudent choice. I prefer instead to provide for a weekly tabulation of the population violation (if any) coupled with\nthe amount of the sanction, were such sanction to be imposed00using as a baseline amount the $100.00 figure\n97\nper inmate per day provided for in the addendum to the SCO3. The County should provide this report to the\n\nspecial masters on a weekly basis. The masters may make any appropriate recommendation to the Court upon\nreceipt of this information.\nAs to the question of what to do with the sanction money imposed by the court today, the masters have\nrecommended that, pursuant to ยถ 22 of the consent order and the terms of this court's prior decisions, the fine\nmoney shall be paid into the Bail Fund. Here, however, the plaintiffs have also agreed that the sanction can be\nput to use by \"having a special master or monitor require the County to arrange for the actual provision of\n548 programs or services or of construction necessary to achieve compliance.\" SCO3 p. 18 (emphasis added). The \n*548 Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has approved such remedial measures. See Wecht, 754 F.2d at 120; \nsee also Owens-El v. Robinson, 442 F.Supp. 1368 (W.D.Pa. 1978).\nPursuant to my authority therefore to fashion an appropriate remedy and drawing from the parties' own\nagreement, I recognize that the bail fund is one such use and that, moreover, to facilitate both the operation of\nthe bail fund and bail proceedings in general, certain expenditures may be required. I direct my masters to\nprovide a report of what would further be necessary for an effective bail program.\nMindful of the United States Constitution's requirements that individuals not be housed in unconstitutional\nsurroundings and the legitimate penalogical objectives of the County defendants as well as the protection and\nwell-being of County residents, I am reluctant to order that all of the fine money be placed in a bail fund. I believe\nthat a more constructive, far-sighted plan may be capable of formulation. I, therefore, order the parties to submit\nalternative proposals to the special masters within two weeks time, bearing in mind that ยถ 22(a) warrants that a\nspecial master or monitor may require the County to arrange for the actual provisions of programs or services or\nof construction necessary to achieve compliance.\nIn Morales Feliciano v. Hernandez Colon, Judge Perez-Giminez wrote about the role of the federal judiciary when\nit is called upon to assess prison conditions and ultimately finds itself in the position of imposing sanctions and\nconstructing remedies. His words refer to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and its status vis a vis the federal\ngovernment, but his words hold equal meaning for to the people and the state of New Jersey. He explained:\nFinally, as for the effect of compliance on the sovereignty of the commonwealth and the integrity of\nfederalist relations, there must be no confusion as to the nature of the obligation in this case.\nNothing in this court's actions interferes with the efforts of the commonwealth as to the\nenforcement of the criminal laws of Puerto Rico, or any other policy decisions of that entity. The\nCommonwealth is being required to do only one thing in this action: adhere to the mandates of the\nUnited States Constitution ... The conditions of confinement must meet constitutional standards.\nThe application of this principle of constitutional government to Puerto Rico scarcely interferes\nwith the prerogatives of the commonwealth.\nIbid. at p. 635 (emphasis in original).\nLet me turn now to the alleged violations of the recreation portion of SCO3. Defendants stated that their failure to\ncomply with the recreation requirements is due to at least three factors00the fact that security concerns prevent\n97\nthem from installing the tier level equipment, the need to convert the upstairs gym into a dormitory, and the lack\nof a third elevator in which to transport inmates to and from the gym.\nAs to the security concerns, the County states that it requires the use of a welder before it can install the\nequipment. The County alleges that there is only one welder they can hire and he, unfortunately, has been\nunavailable. Hence, the argument goes, it cannot perform its necessary obligations.\nWith respect to the area of recreation, this Court is quite appreciative of defendants' real security concerns.\nHowever, this Court is also concerned with both the plaintiffs' constitutional rights and with the unwavering duty of\nall parties to obey the law. In my opinion of May 10th, I gave the County, in essence, a grace period to allow them\nto implement an effective recreational program; one which gives inmates their mandated hour of daily exercise\nand included the installation of then newly-purchased equipment. I also gave the County until June 1, 1989 to\nestablish a weekly monitoring system. The grace period has expired. I believe, as the Masters suggest, that had\nthe County been more serious about meeting court-ordered obligations they would have found another welder to\n\n549 perform the work necessary to insure a safe installation of the supplemental equipment and they *549 would\nhave built this sorely-needed third elevator.\nMoreover, the County's suggestion that \"there is ample space for inmates in the common areas for such exercise\nas pushups, sit-ups and even walking\" (p. 22) is, with all due respect, misplaced. Defendants must remember\nthat they are in violation of a consent judgment; the recreational requirements have been agreed upon by the\nparties and ordered by the court. I respectfully suggest that the fact that inmates can \"even walk\" around the\ncommon areas does not supplant the judgment of this Court and the parties that all inmates be provided with one\n[2]\nhour of recreation time per day.\nAs noted earlier, the Masters directed the parties to provide their calculations of the appropriate numbers for\nrecreation violations. The defendants failed to provide any such numbers. Plaintiff has provided this Court with\nfigures. Accordingly, defendants' silence can only be interpreted as acquiescence in plaintiff's numbers or as\ndisregard for the orders of this Court.\nPlaintiffs, who have provided this Court with a figure of 76,069 for the number of inmates denied their daily hour\nof recreation, ask this Court to impose a fine of $100.00 a day per inmate who was so deprived. See attached\nmonthly breakdowns (Addendum 3). At this time, the Court is reluctant to impose a recreation fine that exceeds\nthe population fines. Since it is the first time such a fine has been imposed (despite, however, the fact that the\nCounty has been on clear notice of this aspect of the SCO), the Court will impose a fine of $20.00 per day per\ninmate, which works out to $1,521,380.00.\nPlaintiffs have asked that a portion of the fine be compensatory in nature and thus paid to the plaintiff class. The\nCourt believes that a compensatory fine is unnecessary and that strict compliance with the recreational\nrequirements should be sufficient.\nPlaintiffs also ask that a separate fine be imposed for the failure to install the supplemental equipment. This Court\nprefers to treat defendants' failure to provide the necessary recreational opportunities and facilities as a package.\nThe $20.00 fine shall cover all aspects of defendants' noncompliance, including their failure to provide the weekly\nreports. Special emphasis was placed on the need for those reports in my May 10th opinion. I trust that it is not\nnecessary to repeat the need for such reports here.\nThe Masters suggest a self-executing fine system with regard to the recreation situation. While I will not impose a\nself-triggering fine system, I would ask that the weekly reports of recreational figures that already were to be\nprovided now include a calculation as to what fine would be in order if any violation of the recreation order were\nto occur, based on the Court's figure of $20.00 per day per inmate. Once again, upon receipt of these figures, the\nMasters may make any appropriate recommendation to the Court. Let there be no misunderstanding, the County\nis to provide the Masters with these reports on a weekly basis.\nThe question next arises as to what should be done with the money collected in connection with the County's\nviolation of the recreation provisions of SCO3. The Masters suggest that a Recreation Fund be established and I\nthink that suggestion is a good one. Pursuant to the terms of SCO3, ยถ 22a, any monies paid into the Court may\nbe used \"to arrange for the provision of programs or services or of construction necessary to achieve\ncompliance.\" The Masters have suggested that an expert be designated to study all aspect of the provision of\nrecreation at the jail and prepare a report on how the money can best be spent to bring the jail into compliance.\nThe Special Masters suggest that upon completion of the expert's report, the Masters will hold a hearing and\n550 make recommendations to this Court. I am willing to consider the proposition that the Recreation Fund be *550\nspent on hiring an expert whose recommendations will then be heard by the Masters and, where appropriate,\nimplemented. It seems that were plaintiffs and defendants to stipulate as to what needed to be done, how best to\ndo it and in what time period it should be done, the money could go directly towards the provision of services.\nAt this time, I order that the fine be placed into an interest bearing account entitled the \"Recreation Fund\" and\nthat the parties get back to this Court within 14 days from the entry of the attached order informing the Court as to\nwhether or not an expert shall be necessary. If they answer this question negatively, then I direct that the parties\npresent the Court with a detailed program and timetable for implementing the full recreation system at the jail.\n\nBefore closing, let me recapitulate. The aggregate fine money should be placed in an interest bearing account to\nbe designated by the Court. The recreation fund should be maintained separately and also in an interest bearing\naccount to be designated by the Court. The money that the County is to be fined as a contempt sanction for the\nrepeated population violations is to be utilized for the bail fund both directly and as may be necessary to\nsupplement the effective operation of bail and relevant monitoring systems in the Essex County Jail. The\ncontempt fine money will also be used on such other projects as are in keeping with ยถ 22(a) of the SCO3,\nprojects which deal not only with bailing out individuals, but which are also designed to keep those individuals in\nthe Essex County facilities, something which can only be done if the facilities meet and maintain the requisite\nconstitutional standards. The fine money shall be deposited with the Court no later than 14 days from the date of\nentry of this order and the parties' suggestions as to the utilization of such monies are to be presented to the\nSpecial Masters in two weeks from the entry of the attached order so that the Masters may take whatever steps\nnecessary prior to recommending a course of action to me.\nIn so ruling as I have today, I am cognizant that some may perceive that this Courts' action may represent an\nunwelcome and unwarranted intrusion into the functions that properly belong to the legislative and the executive\nbranches of state and county government. But, in representing to the Court that they are literally unable to bring\nthe jail into compliance with constitutional standards, the County defendants have foisted onto this court the\nnecessary role of insuring that the Constitution is upheld. What the County defendants have done is to blatantly\npass the buck to this court by doing nothing but make empty promises. Perhaps, the County defendants' hope\nthat the taxpayers of Essex County will perceive defendants as clothed in pristine raiment while venting their\nspleen on the judiciary. While this may be viewed by some as good politics, it is sadly an abdication of the County\ndefendants' responsibilities to the citizenry and to the Court. In ruling as I have today, it is my hope that this\ndecision will provoke constructive action rather than rhetoric.\nI believe that concludes the issues between plaintiff and County defendants. I am pleased that a stipulation has\nbeen reached between the State and the plaintiffs and I will order the stipulation filed as of today.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated above, the County defendants are hereby fined $1,476,800.00 for the overall population\nviolations and $428,500 for the violations of specific housing caps.

STANDARDS FOR POPULATION AND HOUSING  \nA.  ECCF Maximum Capacity \n1.  Definition:  The overall maximum capacity of the ECCF shall be defined as the \nOperational Capacity for the facility and shall be based on the number of beds available for \npermanent inmate housing assignments (which shall exclude beds in ECCF segregation and medical \nunits) and the physical facilities in each housing unit as set forth in the chart below. \n \nECCF Housing Units  Cells  Bunks  Operational Capacity \nBuilding 2- Level 1 (Males)  B  64  128  128 \nC  64  128  128 \nD (Detention & PC)  64  64  0 \nE Left   32  64  64 \nE Right  32  64  64 \n \nB Left   32  64  64 \nBuilding 2B Level 3 (Males) \n  B Right  32  64  64 \n  C Left  32  64  64 \nC Right  32  64  64 \nD (Detention & PC)  64  64  0 \nE Left  32  64  64 \nE Right  32  64  64 \n \nB  32  64  64 \nBuilding 3B Level 1 (Males) \n  C  32  64  64 \n \n  D  32  64  64 \n  E  32  64  64 \n \nB  32  64  64 \nBuilding 3B Level 3 (Males) \n  C  32  64  64 \n \n  D  32  64  64 \n  E  32  64  64 \n \nB  32  64  64 \nBuilding 4B Level 1 (Males) \n  C  32  64  64 \n \n  D  32  64  64 \n  E  32  64  64 \n \nB  32  64  64 \nBuilding 4- Level 3  \n  C  32  64  64 \n(Females)  D  32  64  64 \n  E  32  64  64 \nDorms  1  0  50  50 \n2  0  48  48 \n3  0  48  48 \n4  0  50  50 \n5  0  48  48 \n6  0  48  48 \n7  0  48  48 \nMedical (Males and Females)  42  0 \n \n1024  2302  2132 \n \n  2 \n\n \n  2.

Affirmative Steps to be Taken by the County:  If the ECCF population exceeds the \noperational or any housing unit capacity as set forth above, respectively, for male inmates and \nfemale inmates, the County shall  take affirmative steps that shall provide a reasonable likelihood of \nprompt additional housing capacity or the availability of alternatives to incarceration necessary to \naccommodate the number of male and female inmates, respectively, that are reasonably estimated to \nconstitute the plaintiff class for which the County expects to be responsible for five years from the \ndate of this Third Consent Order, to enable the ECCF population not to exceed the ECCF=s \npermissible Operational Capacity. \n \n2.  Temporary Housing at the ECCF.   \na.  Temporary Beds.  Temporary beds or cots appropriate for a detention facility may only be \nused after the County has taken the affirmative steps set forth above for remedial action.

Capacity Notice Requirements\n  When any cells or bunks cannot be used for more than a 30 day period, the County shall \nnotify Plaintiffs= counsel in writing, and shall identify the cells, the reduced capacity of the particular \nunits, and the number of inmates held daily in the ECCF infirmary and detention areas during the \nprevious 30 day period. \n \nE. Contingency and Accreditation Plans  \n  To avoid the need for proceedings for sanctions and to expedite termination of this Order, the \nCounty shall have a contingency plan in place to ensure that the County can comply with the ECCF=s \nmaximum  capacity  and  program  requirements  of  this  Consent  Order  even  if  unforeseen \ncircumstances make compliance more difficult that originally expected.

INTRODUCTION\nThis matter comes before the court on the defendants' motion to disqualify the plaintiffs' counsel, Susan Remis\nSilver, Esq., for alleged violations of the New Jersey Rules of Professional Conduct (\"RPC\"). The plaintiffs in\nthese consolidated class action lawsuits are inmates at the Essex County Jail and Jail Annex. At the heart of this\nmatter are very serious allegations that Ms. Silver, in her capacity as the plaintiffs' principal attorney, provided\nsecurity sensitive information concerning specific staffing deficiencies at the Jail Annex to eight inmate\nrepresentatives. This information was contained in a detailed memorandum which pointed out specific staffing\ndeficiencies for each day over a span of fifty-three days. In addition, after she had assured this court that she\n421 recognized *421 the very important security concerns at the jail facilities, Ms. Silver provided an inmate with\ninformation concerning the date and time of his outside medical appointment. As will be discussed more fully\nbelow, these acts on the part of Ms. Silver were serious breaches of security at the Jail Annex. At best, these acts\nmanifest Ms. Silver's utter lack of awareness and appreciation of the sensitive position she occupies in this\nlitigation as the principal attorney for inmates at the Jail and Jail Annex. This court concludes that Ms. Silver's\ncontinued representation of the plaintiffs in these cases will impugn the integrity of these proceedings, and thus,\nthe defendants' motion to disqualify her is hereby granted.\nThe two underlying class action lawsuits captioned above were filed on behalf of the inmates of the Essex County\nJail and Jail Annex and allege that the conditions of confinement are unconstitutional. Each case was settled, and\nmany aspects of jail operations have been governed by a series of consent orders. Since the initiation of these\n[1]\nlawsuits, the plaintiffs have been represented by the State of New Jersey's Inmate Advocacy Unit.  Ms. Silver is\nthe present Director of the Inmate Advocacy Unit and has been the principal attorney representing the plaintiffs in\nthese cases since 1993.\nOn January 30, 1996, the defendants filed a notice of motion to disqualify Ms. Silver from further representation\nof the plaintiffs based on alleged violations of the New Jersey Rules of Professional Conduct. This court referred\nthe defendants' motion to the Special Masters in this case, Bennet D. Zurofsky, Esq., and Frederic K. Becker,\nEsq. In a Report and Recommendation dated May 14, 1996, the Special Masters found, among other things, that\n\nalthough \"there are facts which could support the argument that RPC 4.1(a)(1) and RPC 8.4(c) were both\nviolated,\" Report and Recommendation, at 22, the defendants had nonetheless failed to demonstrate that Ms.\nSilver should be disqualified in this matter. Therefore, the Special Masters recommended that the defendants'\nmotion be denied.\nSubsequently, the plaintiffs, represented by the Office of the Public Defender, filed papers urging this court to\naffirm the Special Masters' conclusion that the defendants' disqualification motion be denied. The plaintiffs also\nobjected to that portion of the Special Masters' report that concluded, at least implicitly, that Ms. Silver had\nviolated RPC 4.1 and RPC 8.4. The plaintiffs argued that I should affirmatively find that Ms. Silver did not violate\nthose rules.\nThe defendants opposed the plaintiffs' request for an affirmative finding that Ms. Silver did not violate RPC 4.1\nand RPC 8.4. In addition, the defendants renewed their arguments in support of the motion to disqualify Ms.\n[2]\nSilver.  After reviewing the Report and Recommendation, as well as the entire record relied upon by the Special\nMasters in deciding the motion, this court held a hearing on April 17 and 18, 1997 pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 53(e) to determine whether to accept, reverse, accept in part, or reverse in part the Special\n[3]\nMasters' recommendation.  Subsequent to the April, 1997 hearing, the defendants filed supplemental papers, in\nwhich they apprised the court of another incident in which Ms. Silver allegedly breached security measures at the\njail facilities. After another round of briefing was permitted as to whether and in what manner this latest incident\naffected the disqualification motion, this court held another hearing on March 31, 1998 to address the issue.\nThis court has carefully reviewed all of the affidavits, certifications, and briefs submitted on this matter. This court\n422 also held *422 two hearings in which it had an opportunity to hear testimony from various witnesses.\nFurthermore, this court has scrupulously reviewed the Special Masters' Report and Recommendation. Based on\nthis extensive review of the record, and in view of the sensitive nature of this litigation, this court is compelled to\ndisqualify Ms. Silver as the plaintiffs' counsel in this case.\nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 53(e) specifies that in non-jury actions which have been referred to a special\nmaster,\nthe court shall accept the master's findings of fact unless clearly erroneous. Within 10 days after\nbeing served with notice of the filing of the report any party may serve written objections thereto\nupon the other parties. Application to the court for action upon the report and upon objections\nthereto shall be by motion and upon notice as prescribed in Rule 6(d). The court after hearing may\nadopt the report or may modify it or may reject it in whole or in part or may receive further\nevidence or may recommit it with instructions.\nPursuant to this rule, it is well established that a special master's findings of fact will not be disturbed unless they\nare clearly erroneous. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous \"`when although there is evidence to support it, the\nreviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been\ncommitted.'\" Dome Petroleum Ltd. v. Employers Mut. Liab. Ins. Co., 131 F.R.D. 63, 65 (D.N.J.1990) (reviewing\ndecision of United States Magistrate) (quoting United States v. Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92\nL.Ed. 746 (1948)). However, a court must review a special master's conclusions of law under the de novo\nstandard. See Stauble v. Warrob, Inc., 977 F.2d 690, 693 (1st Cir.1992).\nIII. BACKGROUND\nThe approximate inmate population at the Essex County Jail Annex in North Caldwell, New Jersey is between\n1,300 and 1,400. The approximate number of corrections officers on duty at any given time is between 60 and\n80. None of the corrections officers on duty carries a firearm of any sort. Inmates are not restrained by handcuffs\nor the like for significant periods of the day, and they are not separated from corrections officers by any barriers.\nInmates are grouped together and housed in tiers or wings.\n\nThe procedures adopted at the Essex County Jail and the Jail Annex are geared towards maximizing security.\nCorrections officers at the Jail Annex are assigned to either custodial supervision or support operation. Each\nofficer assigned to custodial supervision occupies a fixed post and oversees a group of inmates. Officers\nassigned to support operations do not occupy any fixed position, but rather provide relief to those assigned to\ncustodial supervision and remain available to respond to emergencies which may arise from time to time.\nBecause the support operation officers are not deployed to a fixed post, an inmate is generally incapable of\ndiscerning through personal observation the number of relief officers on duty at any given time. The defendants\nhave described the salient effect of this procedure as a \"carefully-cultivated uncertainty,\" which seeks to deter\ninmate misbehavior 00 attacks on other inmates or officers and escapes 00 by keeping them unsure as to when\n97 97\nand where corrections officers may be in the vicinity. Moreover, while the inmate groups remain together for\nmeals and recreation, intergroup communication is restricted to the greatest extent possible.\nTo maintain this \"carefully-cultivated uncertainty,\" strict confidentiality of corrections officer scheduling information\nis required. Such schedules are prepared in the Central Scheduling Office and distributed only to the warden of\nthe facility and the shift commanders.\nMs. Silver, in her capacity as the inmates' principal attorney in this litigation, authored a memorandum addressed\nostensibly to the Special Masters, Lisa Martinez Wolmart, and all counsel, entitled \"Officer Staffing Shortages that\nResult in the Inadequate Supervision of Inmates,\" which concerned the issue of officer staffing. The first\nparagraph of the memorandum succinctly describes its purpose:\n423 *423 I have prepared a chart based on the Officer Staffing Schedules at the Essex County Jail\nAnnex. This chart demonstrates that there is a continuing problem with officer staffing shortages.\nThe result is that tiers of inmates are left without any officer supervision for periods of time each\nday.\nThe memorandum consists of slightly over twelve single-spaced pages detailing numerous instances of staffing\ndeficiencies. The memorandum provides in some detail the perceived deficiencies of officer staffing at the Jail\nAnnex for each day between August 1, 1995 and September 22, 1995. Even a cursory review of this\n[4]\nmemorandum reveals that it contains quite sensitive information.  Although not indicated in the memorandum\nitself, Ms. Silver sent copies of this memorandum to eight inmate representatives under a cover letter dated\nSeptember 29, 1995.\nIn a letter dated October 11, 1995, Ms. Silver admitted that she obtained the officer staffing schedules, which\nformed the basis of her memorandum, from a corrections officer outside of the normal discovery process. She\nwould not, however, identify the corrections officer, although she did say that the officer had keys to the building\nwhere the schedules were maintained. After receiving the letter, the county retained independent counsel to\ninvestigate the circumstances surrounding Ms. Silver's acquisition of confidential staffing information. Based upon\nthis investigation, the county concluded that Ms. Silver had obtained the staffing schedules from Corrections\nOfficer Michael DeMeo, an employee of the county and the President of the Policeman's Benevolent Association\n(\"PBA\"), Local 157. The PBA office is located in the same administrative building in which the schedules were\nlocated. Corrections Officer DeMeo did not have authorized access to the schedules.\nOn December 6 or 7, 1995, Ms. Silver spoke by telephone to Martin Hellwig, the Essex County Director of Public\nSafety. Although Mr. Hellwig and Ms. Silver agreed that the conversation did take place and that the issue of the\nstaffing schedules was discussed, they provided slightly different versions of other aspects of the telephone\nconversation in their respective certifications submitted to the Special Masters. In his certification, Mr. Hellwig\ndescribed the event as follows in relevant part:\n2. On or around December 7, 1995, I received a telephone call from Ms. Silver who wished to\ndiscuss the handling of inmates' incoming correspondence.\n3. Unbeknownst to Ms. Silver, at the time of our conversation, I had before me a copy of her\nSeptember 29, 1995 cover letter to eight inmates under which she enclosed a copy of a detailed\nmemorandum also dated September 29, 1995 and purporting to highlight alleged custodial\n\ncorrections officers staffing shortages. At the time of my conversation with Ms. Silver, however, I\ndid not have copies of the scheduling memorandum which Ms. Silver provided to the eight\ninmates.\n4. During our conversation, Ms. Silver assured, in response to my direct inquiry, that she had not\nprovided any scheduling information to inmates. From the cover letter to inmates which I had\nbefore me, I knew that Ms. Silver's statements were false.\n5. A day or two after our telephone conversation, Ms. Silver met with some of her clients at the\nEssex County Jail Annex in North Caldwell. Apparently, Ms. Silver learned during her meetings\nthat the County was aware that she had provided scheduling information to inmates. Later that\nday, Ms. Silver visited my office in person and attempted to justify her false statements of the\nprevious day. Ms. Silver took the position that all information set forth in her September 29, 1995\nscheduling memorandum already was in possession of the inmates. She characterized the\nscheduling memorandum as having only the most \"general\" information. At the time of this\nconversation, I still did not have in my possession nor had I reviewed a copy of Ms. Silver's\nscheduling memorandum.\n6. After my second conversation with Ms. Silver, I reviewed a copy of the scheduling\n424 memorandum which she sent to eight inmates. *424 The information is not \"general\" as Ms. Silver\nclaimed. Rather, the information is quite detailed, specifying such things as when and where relief\nofficers are deployed. This most certainly is not the type of information an inmate could glean\nthrough personal observation. I believe Ms. Silver's characterization of the scheduling information\nwas deliberately misleading.\nCertification of Martin Hellwig, January 23, 1996.\nMs. Silver's version of events is as follows in relevant part:\n9. With respect to Martin Hellwig's certification submitted in support of the County's motion, Mr.\nHellwig states that \"[o]n or around December 7, 1995, I received a telephone call from Ms. Silver\nwho wished to discuss the handling of inmates' incoming correspondence.\" (Hellwig Certification,\npara. 2).\n10. Mr. Hellwig and I did not speak with each other on December 7, 1996 [sic]. We did have a\ntelephone conversation on Wednesday, December 6, 1996 [sic], but at no point in time did we\n\"discuss the handling of inmates' incoming correspondence.\"\n11. My call to Mr. Hellwig on December 6, 1995, had absolutely no bearing on the issues before\nthe Court that relate to either the plaintiffs' pending contempt application or to the issues that\nwould later form the basis for the motion that I filed on December 21, 1995 for an order to protect\ninmates' rights to confidential attorney communications.\n12. During my telephone conversation with Mr. Hellwig on December 6, 1995, he asked me the\nfollowing question: \"Did you ever send inmates copies of the Officer Staffing Schedules?\"\n13. I have never sent any Officer Staffing Schedules to inmates, and I answered Mr. Hellwig\ntruthfully when I told him, \"No, I have not.\" I also told Mr. Hellwig that I never would send Officer\nStaffing Schedules to the inmates.\n14. I remember Mr. Hellwig's specific question, because I remember thinking that the way Mr.\nHellwig asked me the question, I could answer the question narrowly but truthfully.\n15. Mr. Hellwig is incorrect when he states that I \"assured [him] in response to [his] direct inquiry,\nthat [I] had not provided any scheduling information to inmates.\" (Hellwig Certification, para. 4).\nMr. Hellwig never asked me any general question about \"scheduling information.\" He only had\nasked me the specific question about whether I had sent Officer Staffing Schedules to the\ninmates.\n\n16. I did not provide information to Mr. Hellwig about the substance of my correspondence with my\nclients on officer staffing since this correspondence is an attorney/client privileged communication\non an issue that is before this Court as part of the plaintiffs' contempt application.\n17. Mr. Hellwig also told me in our telephone conversation on December 6, 1995, that something\nhad just come across his desk that day that he found \"shocking\" and that the information involved\nme. I asked him to explain.\n18. Mr. Hellwig told me that he did not feel comfortable telling me about it over the telephone, but\nhe would be happy to discuss the matter with me in person.\n19. I told Mr. Hellwig that I had plans to see the inmate representative committees at both the\nEssex County Jail and the Essex County Jail Annex on Friday, December 8, 1996 [sic].\n20. Mr. Hellwig told me that after I finished meeting with both Inmate Committees, I should come\nto his office and we would talk again. I again tried to press Mr. Hellwig to tell me what had\nhappened that was causing him concern, but Mr. Hellwig would only tell me that we would talk\nwhen we met on Friday.\n* * * * * *\n22. When I had finished meeting with the Inmate Representatives at the ECJ [on the morning of\nDecember 8, 1995], I saw Mr. Hellwig in the ECJ sally port as he was leaving. Mr. Hellwig came\nover to me and told me that when I went to the ECJA that afternoon, I should make certain that I\n425 spoke to Emma Hunter about an incident *425 that recently happened. He again said that I should\ncome talk with him at his office after I spoke with Ms. Hunter and the other inmate\nrepresentatives....\n23. When Emma Hunter, the Inmate Representative for Satellite 2, arrived at the Inmate\nRepresentative Committee meeting on December 8, 1995, she told me that the day before,\nSergeant Vitiello from the Internal Affairs Unit at the ECJA confiscated all of her correspondence\nfrom me....\n24. When I saw Martin Hellwig in his office immediately after the Inmate Representative's meeting,\nI told him that I was very upset that the jail had confiscated all of my privileged attorney\ncorrespondence from my client, Emma Hunter.\n25. At that point, Mr. Hellwig told me that he had a copy of the September 29, 1995 letter that I\nhad sent to Ms. Hunter and the other inmate representatives at the ECJA. Mr. Hellwig told me that\nhe had read the letter and that it made reference to an officer staffing memorandum that I had\nattached to the letter. Mr. Hellwig again asked me if I had ever sent Officer Staffing Schedules to\nthe inmates.\n26. I again told Mr. Hellwig that I did not send Officer Staffing Schedules to the inmates, but I had\nsent them a memorandum I prepared that summarized the officer staffing problems that occurred\nover a 6 week period of time in the summer. I explained that officer staffing is a legitimate concern\nof the plaintiffs' [sic] because officer shortages endanger the physical safety of inmates.\n27. I told Mr. Hellwig that at the time that I prepared the cover letter and memorandum, I had no\nidea that the County did not want me to discuss officer staffing problems with my clients. I told Mr.\nHellwig that the first time I learned of the County's concern was when we met at the ECJA with the\nSpecial Masters, and Ron Manzella [Director of Corrections for the County of Essex] was very\nupset that I had obtained the officer staffing information and included it in a memo that I had sent\nthe attorneys and the Special Masters. This meeting at the ECJA occurred on October 6, 1995.\n28. I explained to Mr. Hellwig that once I learned of the County's concern, I returned to my office,\nand asked my secretary to remove the officer staffing memorandum from the package of material\n\nthat I was sending the inmate representatives. My secretary told me that she had just sent the\npackages out. The letters were mailed to the inmate representatives either on October 5, 1995 or\nOctober 6, 1995.\n29. I also told Mr. Hellwig that I decided that I would ask the inmate representatives to return the\nofficer staffing memoranda to me, but the ECJA had started a new practice of insisting that officers\nsit in on my inmate representative meetings, and I was unable to meet with my clients\nconfidentially to ask them to return the officer staffing memos.\n30. I told Mr. Hellwig on December 8, 1995, that now that I know what the County's concerns are, I\nhad no problem accommodating the County's request that I not share officer staffing information\nwith inmates. However, I told Mr. Hellwig that the officer staffing information that I sent to the\ninmates was not current information, and the inmates know even more about the officer staffing\nproblems that the information reflected in either my memorandum or in the Officer Staffing\nSchedules themselves.\n31. I told Mr. Hellwig that there was absolutely no indication that the information in the officer\nstaffing memorandum had any adverse effect on security at the ECJA.\n32. Mr. Hellwig agreed. He told me that there was no indication that the information in the officer\nstaffing memorandum was tied in any way to the recent escapes at the ECJA, and his concern\nwas about the potential for security problems.\n33. Mr. Hellwig told me that he actually did not have the officer staffing memorandum that I\nattached to my September 29, 1995 letter to the Inmate Representatives. However, Mr. Hellwig\n426 stated that as long as the information that I put in the officer *426 staffing memorandum was\ngeneral in nature, he was sure there was no harm done.\n34. I did not make any comment on Mr. Hellwig's characterization of my officer staffing\nmemorandum. At no point did I characterize the scheduling memorandum \"as having only the\nmost general information\" as Mr. Hellwig now claims. (Hellwig Certification, paras. 5 and 6). This\nwas Mr. Hellwig's characterization, not mine.\n35. I have no idea what Mr. Hellwig means when he states that during my meeting with him, I tried\nto \"justify\" my false statements of the previous day. (Hellwig Certification, para. 5). I have never\nmade any false statements to Mr. Hellwig.\nCertification of Susan R. Silver, February 26, 1996 (emphasis in original).\nThe Special Masters did not hold a hearing, and thus, they did not resolve which version of events was true. This\ncourt did hold a hearing on April 17 and 18, 1997 in which Mr. Hellwig and Ms. Silver, among others, testified. At\nthe hearing, Mr. Hellwig testified that he was aware of the difference between \"officer staffing schedules\" and\n\"officer staffing information\":\nQ. Now, when, Mr. Hellwig, when you spoke on the telephone with Susan Silver, and I believe the\ndate was December 6th, although in your affidavit or your certification you indicate it was\nDecember 7th, whatever the date was, December 6th or 7th, when you spoke with Miss Silver you\nhad in front of you the letter that she had sent, the two page letter that she had sent to the inmate\nreps. Isn't that correct?\nA. That is correct.\nQ. And that letter indicated that she had provided the inmate reps with the officer staffing analysis\nor the officer staffing memorandum. Isn't that correct?\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. And she specifically referred to it as an officer staffing memorandum and you knew it as an\nofficer staffing memorandum. Isn't that correct?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And isn't that 00 isn't that in your mind, as well as in 00 well, isn't that in your mind, Mr. Hellwig,\n97 97\ndistinct from an officer staffing schedule?\nA. Yes, it is.\nQ. What is the difference?\nA. Well, the schedules themselves are 00 capture a moment in time, an eight hour period, 24 hour\n97\nperiod.... The memorandum that was written captured an extended period of time, I believe in\nexcess of 60 days.\nTestimony of Martin Hellwig, April 17, 1997 at 1.79-80.\nMr. Hellwig's testimony also revealed that he asked specifically about \"officer staffing schedules,\" rather than\ngeneral staffing information:\nQ. But you say that at some point during the conversation you asked her the question did she\nprovide scheduling 00 schedules to her clients. Is that correct?\n97\nA. Yes.\nQ. And her answer was what?\nA. No, she would not do that.\nQ. And that's the truth, isn't it?\n* * * * * *\nA. As far as I know.\nId. at 1.86-87.\nIt appears that at least one inmate planned a successful escape based on information derived from Ms. Silver's\nmemorandum. Billy Pereira, an inmate at the Jail Annex certified that he escaped form the Jail Annex on October\n26, 1995 \"after having read a memorandum ... that highlighted the posts that lacked supervision by corrections\nofficers.\" Certification of Billy Pereira, January 19, 1996 at ยถ 1. He described how he obtained and used the\ninformation contained in Ms. Silver's memorandum:\nOn or about October 24, 1995, I was on the telephone in the west wing of the Jail Annex. Lying\natop a card table within arm's length were some papers along with a brown folder. I was idly\nreviewing the papers when I realized that one contained information about corrections officers and\ntheir posts at the Jail Annex. It was entitled \"Officer Staffing Shortages that Result in the\n427 Inadequate Supervision of *427 Inmates\" .... I also saw a Fire Safety Memorandum ... but it was\nmissing the first page. I had both sets of documents in my possession for about five minutes until\nan inmate trustee took them from me. I learned from the Inadequate Supervision Memorandum\nthat there would be no officer assigned to the gate near Satellite 3.\nId. at ยถ 2. Two days later, Mr. Pereira escaped through Satellite 3.\nAs noted above, the Special Masters issued a report on May 16, 1996, in which they recommended that this\ncourt not disqualify Ms. Silver from continued representation of the plaintiffs in this case. That report focused\nsolely on the disclosure of officer staffing information by Ms. Silver. This court held a hearing on April 17 and 18,\n\n1997. At the hearing, Ms. Silver took the stand and repeatedly assured this court that the disclosure of the officer\nstaffing information was a mistake which would not be repeated:\nTHE WITNESS: ... But Judge, as I said, in that before, I did this one time, October 5th or 6th,\n1995. I told the county I would not do it again, I have not and I am now very careful about what\ninformation I give to the court, because I have no intention of violating any security policy that\nEssex County has in either the Essex County Jail or Annex.\nTestimony of Susan R. Silver, April 17, 1997 at 75-76. Ms. Silver also assured this court that she would never\ndisclose other security sensitive information to her clients:\nQ. Have you been privy to other information that the county considers of a security nature and\nwhich you have treated securely, if you will, and not provided to the inmates?\nA. Yes, I have.\nQ. Could you describe that?\nA. I receive frequently medical information with dates as to when inmates are scheduled to receive\nsurgery in outside hospitals or clinics or outside medical specialists appointments to evaluate their\nmedical problems.\nBack in, I believe early 1994, Mr. Del Plato mentioned to me that the county treats that information\nas being confidential because if inmates knew when they were going to be leaving jail grounds for\na medical appointment, that poses a security threat in terms of making an escape easier.\nEver since Mr. Del Plato made that comment to me, I have been very careful to never tell inmates\nwhen they're going to be leaving the grounds for a medical appointment or surgery.\nTestimony of Susan R. Silver, April 18, 1997 at 113.\nOn May 23, 1997, Quran Johnson, an inmate at the Essex County Jail, was transported to St. Elizabeth Hospital\nin Elizabeth, New Jersey for medical treatment. Upon arriving at the hospital, Mr. Johnson informed Corrections\nOfficer Charles Green, one of the transporting officers, that he knew of the date and time of his appointment at\nthe hospital through a letter he received from Ms. Silver. That letter, dated May 12, 1997, attached a document\nentitled, \"Request for Medical Attention,\" which indicated that Mr. Johnson was scheduled for a podiatry\nexamination on May 23, 1997 at 11:00 a.m. A subsequent investigation by jail officials revealed that Mr. Johnson\nhad communicated several times with Ms. Silver concerning his ailments, culminating in the May 12, 1997 letter\nin which he was informed of the specific date and time of his outside medical appointment.\nThis court must now determine whether Ms. Silver should be disqualified from this case. In doing so, this court\nmust consider the recommendation of the Special Masters, in light of the subsequent events concerning the\ndisclosure of the date and time of Quran Johnson's outside medical appointment.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nBefore the Special Masters, the defendants presented four arguments as to why disqualification was appropriate.\nThese contentions were as follows: (1) Ms. Silver improperly obtained the scheduling information through\nunauthorized ex parte communications with Corrections Officer Michael DeMeo, a county employee and the\nPresident of the PBA Local at the Jail Annex, in violation of RPC 4.2; (2) Ms. Silver had a non-waivable conflict of\n428 interest with her clients, in violation of RPC *428 1.7(b), on grounds that truthful disclosure of her role in acquiring\nand disseminating the officer scheduling information would have revealed that she had violated the Public\nDefender's Code of Ethics and would thereby place her continued employment in jeopardy; (3) Ms. Silver's\nconduct with respect to the disclosure of the officer scheduling information created an appearance of impropriety,\nparticularly because she is a government attorney; and (4) Ms. Silver knowingly made a false statement of\nmaterial fact to Mr. Hellwig, in violation of RPC 4.1(a)(1). In addition to the above arguments, the Special Masters\nperceived that the defendants were also making an implicit argument that Ms. Silver should be disqualified\n\nbecause she exercised extremely bad judgment in divulging the security sensitive information to the inmate\nrepresentatives and then denying that she had done so when the county investigated the allegation.\nAlthough the defendants have raised numerous issues in support of their motion to disqualify Ms. Silver, this\ncourt believes that the core issues in this case concern Ms. Silver's disclosure of security sensitive information to\nboth the inmate representatives and Quran Johnson. This conduct was improper and had the effect of\nunreasonably increasing the risk of inmate misconduct. That the information was obtained by Ms. Silver within\nthe context of this court's continued oversight of the Essex County jail facilities impugns the integrity of these\nproceedings. Under these circumstances, Ms. Silver's conduct cannot be written off as just an isolated instance\nof poor judgment. Rather, these acts manifest an altogether cavalier attitude towards important security concerns\nat the jail facilities, which impugn the very integrity of these proceedings. Before discussing these core issues,\nhowever, this court will address the other arguments raised by the defendants and previously determined by the\nSpecial Masters.\n1. Improper Ex Parte Communications with Corrections Officer DeMeo\nBefore the Special Masters, the defendants contended that Ms. Silver violated RPC 4.2 by communicating on an \nex parte basis with Corrections Officer DeMeo. The defendants contended that Corrections Officer DeMeo came\nwithin the purview of RPC 4.2 because he was an employee of Essex County, and as such, he had \"significant\ninvolvement in establishing [Jail] Annex policy regarding staffing ... [since he] is the correction officers'\nspokesperson regarding staffing issues and, therefore, is involved in staffing decisions.\" Defendants' Reply Brf. at\n3-4. The Special Masters rejected this argument, finding that Corrections Officer DeMeo was not a member of the\ncounty's \"control group\" such that RPC 4.2 would be implicated.\nWhile I agree with the Special Masters' conclusion on the narrow issue of whether RPC 4.2 was violated, this is\nnot to say that this court wholeheartedly endorses Ms. Silver's conduct in this regard. Ms. Silver obtained the\nofficer staffing schedules out of the normal discovery process from Corrections Officer DeMeo, who evidently\nabused his position as the president of the local PBA in gaining unauthorized access to the schedules. Ms. Silver\nthen distilled this raw data into a memorandum detailing specific times and locations of staffing deficiencies, and\ntransmitted this memorandum to inmates at the jail facilities. This conduct on the part of Ms. Silver, on its face,\nwas inappropriate. However, this conduct on the part of Ms. Silver cannot be adequately addressed by reference\n[5]\nto RPC 4.2.\nRPC 4.2 provides as follows:\n429 *429 In representing a client, a lawyer shall not communicate about the subject of the\nrepresentation with a person the lawyer knows, or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should\nknow, to be represented by another lawyer in the matter, including members of an organization's\nlitigation control group as defined by RPC 1.13, unless the lawyer has the consent of the other\nlawyer, or is authorized by law to do so, or unless the sole purpose of the communication is to\nascertain whether the person is in fact represented. Reasonable diligence shall include, but not be\nlimited to, a specific inquiry of the person as to whether that person is represented by counsel.\nNothing in this rule shall, however, preclude a lawyer from counseling or representing a member\nor former member of an organization's litigation control group who seeks independent legal\nadvice.\nRPC 1.13, in turn, provides in relevant part:\nA lawyer employed or retained to represent an organization represents the organization as distinct\nfrom its directors, officers, employees, members, shareholders or other constituents. For the\npurposes of RPC 4.2 and 4.3, however, the organization's lawyer shall be deemed to represent\nnot only the organizational entity but also the members of its litigation control group. Members of\nthe litigation control group shall be deemed to include current agents and employees responsible\nfor, or significantly involved in, the determination of the organization's legal position in the matter\n\nwhether or not in litigation, provided, however, that \"significant involvement\" requires involvement\ngreater, and other than, the supplying of factual information or data respecting the matter.\nRPC 4.2 therefore \"restrains a lawyer for one party from speaking directly to another party who is represented by\ncounsel.\" In re Opinion 668, 134 N.J. 294, 297, 633 A.2d 959 (1993). When the party is a corporation or other\norganization, only certain key employees come within the purview of the rule. RPC 1.13 limits the applicability of\nRPC 4.2 to employees who are \"responsible for, or significantly involved in, the determination of the\norganization's legal position in the matter.\" See also Apple Corps Ltd. v. International Collectors Soc'y, 1998 WL\n345078 at *18-*19 (D.N.J. June 26, 1998). Accordingly, RPC 4.2 is violated, with respect to current employees of\na party, if: (1) the employee is within the \"litigation control group\" as defined by RPC 1.13; or (2) the employee is\notherwise represented by counsel. See Michaels v. Woodland, 988 F.Supp. 468, 472 (D.N.J.1997).\nCorrections Officer DeMeo is not a member of Essex County's \"litigation control group.\" Clearly, he was neither\nresponsible for nor significantly involved in the determination of Essex County's legal position in the matter. See\nRPC 1.13. At best, Corrections Officer DeMeo provided \"factual information or data,\" which is insufficient to\nsupport a finding that an employee is a member of the \"litigation control group.\" With respect to the second prong\nabove, there is no indication that Corrections Officer DeMeo, at the time of his contact with Ms. Silver, was\nrepresented by other counsel.\nThe defendants argued that Corrections Officer DeMeo should be considered part of the \"litigation control group\"\nbecause he had \"significant involvement in establishing [Jail] Annex policy regarding staffing ... [since he] is the\n430 correction officers' spokesperson regarding staffing issues and, therefore, is *430 involved in staffing decisions.\" \nDefendants' Reply Brf. at 3-4. Even if his involvement in developing policies concerning staffing could be equated\nwith significant involvement in the determination of Essex County's legal position 00 which I doubt 00 Corrections\n97 97\nOfficer DeMeo clearly undertook this responsibility in his capacity as the president of the PBA Local, not as an\nemployee of the county. As the Special Masters correctly found:\nWhen he is engaged in this activity ... he is not representing the County or acting on the County's\nbehalf. To the contrary, he is representing a completely separate entity, the PBA, and is acting on\nthe PBA's behalf to advocate for the Corrections Officers that it represents. He sits across the\ntable from the County and does his best to convince the County to agree to the PBA's views of the\nmatter. This hardly makes him a member of the County's \"control group.\" To the contrary, his\ninvolvement in decision-making as PBA President establishes his identity as separate and apart\nfrom the County. The PBA does not control the County, it simply negotiates with it. It may\nsometimes, or even often, convince the County to accept its point of view, but it is always separate\nand apart from the County in terms of its party status.\nReport and Recommendation at 8.\nBecause Corrections Officer DeMeo was not a member of the \"litigation control group,\" Ms. Silver's ex parte\ncontact with him in obtaining the staffing information did not violate RPC 4.2.\n2. Conflict of Interest\nThe defendants also contended that Ms. Silver's actions gave rise to a disqualifying conflict of interest pursuant\nto RPC 1.7(b). Specifically, the defendants contended that Ms. Silver had a conflict of interest with her clients\nbecause her alleged misconduct in acquiring and distributing the scheduling information violated the regulations\nof the Public Defenders Office, and thus, could have lead to her dismissal if the truth were known. The\ndefendants articulated this portion of their motion as follows:\n[I]t is in Ms. Silver's interest to suppress all information concerning her acquisition of the custodial\nofficers staffing schedules because she acquired the schedules in an unethical manner. Her\nunethical conduct is grounds for dismissal from her position pursuant to the Public Defender's\nCode of Ethics. Already by failing to timely disclose that she sent scheduling information to\ninmates, Ms. Silver has increased the danger faced by her clients. Her continued lack of\n\ncooperation in the County's investigation into the breach of security also offends her clients'\ninterests because one of the purposes of the investigation is to prevent a recurrence of the\nbreach.\nDefendants' Reply Brf. at 12-13.\nRPC 1.7(b), the specific provision at issue here, provides as follows:\nA lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that client may be materially limited by\nthe lawyer's responsibilities to another client or to a third person, or by the lawyer's own interests,\nunless:\n(1) the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected; and\n(2) the client consents after a full disclosure of the circumstances and consultation with the client,\nexcept that a public entity cannot consent to any such representation. When representation of\nmultiple clients in a single matter is undertaken, the consultation shall include explanation of the\nimplications of the common representation and the advantages and risks involved.\nAs noted above, the conflict here is between Ms. Silver's own interests in keeping her job as a public defender\nand the interests of her clients in having a safe prison environment.\nAs an initial matter, the plaintiffs contend that the defendants do not have standing to raise the question of a\nconflict of interest because it is the plaintiffs themselves, not the defendants, who have suffered from the alleged\nconflict. The plaintiffs rely specifically on Hovsons, Inc. v. Secretary of Interior, 711 F.2d 1208, 1213 (3d Cir.1983).\nThe plaintiffs have misread Hovsons. In that case, the plaintiffs, owners and users of property located in the\n431 Pinelands area of New Jersey, sued the Secretary of the Interior *431 alleging that they were aggrieved by the\nSecretary's approval of the \"Comprehensive Management Plan\" (\"CMP\") for the Pinelands area. Id. at 1210.\nDuring the course of the litigation, the Secretary moved to disqualify the plaintiffs' counsel, contending that he\nwas representing conflicting interests. Id. at 1211. In determining that disqualification was not appropriate, the\nThird Circuit made the following remarks, which the plaintiffs herein have evidently construed as supporting their\nproposition that a party in litigation has no standing to raise conflicts of interest issues concerning his adversary:\nSecond, we share the district court's concern about \"the questionable nature of plaintiffs' standing\nto raise objection to the Secretary of the Interior's consideration of the national defense\nmission....\" Even assuming that a private plaintiff could suffer some \"distinct and palpable injury to\nhimself,\" ... because of the Secretary's failure to consider whether the CMP adequately provided\nfor the national defense mission, none of the allegations made by these plaintiffs in this case\nsuggests such injury. Thus, with respect to this single, narrow, alleged violation of the statute, the\nplaintiffs have raised only a \"generalized grievance shared in substantially equal measure by all or\na large class of citizens.\" ... In our view, they have not demonstrated their standing to object to the\nSecretary's alleged failure to fulfill his statutory duty.\nId. at 1213 (citations omitted) (emphasis in original).\nThis passage, as well as the Hovsons case as a whole, has nothing at all to do with an adversary's standing to\nraise conflicts of interest issues. Rather, this particular section of the Hovsons case concerned the plaintiffs'\nstanding to contest the Secretary's consideration of the \"national defense mission\" under the relevant statutory\nscheme, not the Secretary's standing to raise a potential conflict of interest between the plaintiffs and their\ncounsel. See id. (\"The reason that we have addressed the plaintiffs' standing is that their absence of standing is\nan important factor in assessing the interests at stake in our consideration of the Secretary's motion to\ndisqualify.\"). Moreover, the plaintiffs' position on this issue is directly contradicted by Schiffli Embroidery Workers\nPension Fund v. Ryan, Beck & Co., 1994 WL 62124 (D.N.J. Feb.23, 1994). In that case, Judge Wolin of this\ndistrict rejected the same argument now forwarded by the plaintiffs. See id. at *2. Accordingly, the plaintiffs'\ncontention that the defendants are without standing to raise a potential conflict of interest between her and her\nclients must be rejected.\n\nTurning to the substantive issue at hand, this court is in agreement with the Special Masters' conclusion that the\ndefendants have failed to prove that a conflict of interest requires Ms. Silver's disqualification. This case, as will\nbe discussed, concerns reckless misconduct on the part of Ms. Silver. Her misconduct, however, cannot be\nsquarely addressed by the conflict of interest rules. In determining this issue, it is important to recognize that\ncases involving a lawyer's self interest are viewed, in an analytical sense, somewhat differently than cases\ninvolving dual representation. Cf. Beets v. Scott, 65 F.3d 1258, 1265-66 (5th Cir.1995) (\"[T]he demands and\nreasoning of legal ethics militate against treating multiple representation cases like those in which the lawyer's\nself-interest is pitted against the duty of loyalty to his client.\"); Garcia v. Bunnell, 33 F.3d 1193, 1198 n. 4 (9th\nCir.1994) (\"It is not logically necessary that the approach of these [multiple representation] cases also apply to\nconflicts between a defendant's and the attorney's own interests.\"). This is due in part to the fact that multiple\nrepresentation cases, in general, present relatively discrete fact patterns, arising only with respect to multiple or\nformer representation. See Beets, 65 F.3d at 1270 (noting that multiple representation cases present \"unique,\nstraightforward danger[s] of conflict....\").\nBy contrast, self-interest cases \"fall along a wide spectrum of ethical sensitivity from merely potential danger to\noutright criminal misdeeds.\" Id. In short, a lawyer's self-interest is, in theory, inherent in every case in which he\nparticipates, and the \"range of possible breaches ... is virtually limitless.\" Id. at 1271. One need not tax the mind\n432 too strenuously to conjure up an entire assortment of instances in which an attorney's selfinterest *432 may\ntheoretically conflict with the interests of his client. Indeed, a private practice attorney's interest in extending\nlitigation to obtain greater fees is surely at odds with a client's interest in a swift and relatively inexpensive\nresolution of his case, to give just one example. See also id. (providing other illustrations of instances where\nattorney's self-interest is arguably implicated). The vast majority of these instances, however, do not present the\nsort of conflict of interest recognized by the law. Id. (\"The `conflict' between the lawyer's self-interest and that of\nhis client is not a real conflict in the eyes of the law.\").\nBecause of the virtually limitless cases in which a \"conflict\" may theoretically arise when a lawyer's self-interest is\nimplicated, there is a very real danger of analyzing these issues not on fact but on speculation and conjecture.\nAccordingly, when a conflict of interest issue arises based on a lawyer's self-interest, a sturdier factual predicate\nmust be evident than when a case concerns multiple representation. Only by requiring a more specific articulation\nof the facts giving rise to a conflict situation can courts refrain from effectively \"straight-jacket[ing] counsel in a\nstifling, redundant federal code of professional conduct.\" Id. at 1272. Supposition and speculation, therefore, will\nsimply not do.\nTurning to the case at hand, the defendants' argument is premised on the notion that Ms. Silver acted unethically\nin obtaining the officer staffing schedules. But as noted above, and as found by the Special Masters, Ms. Silver\ndid not squarely violate RPC 4.2 in her contacts with Corrections Officer DeMeo. Furthermore, the defendants\nhave not adequately shown that Ms. Silver's acquisition of the officer staffing schedules from Corrections Officer\nDeMeo violated any specific ethics provision.\nThe defendants have argued that Ms. Silver's interest in this matter was to keep her job, as the disclosure of her\nconduct would have jeopardized continued employment as a public defender. This fear of losing her job is far too\nspeculative to support a finding of a conflict of interest. While not entirely on point with the facts of this case, \nUnited States v. Horton, 845 F.2d 1414 (7th Cir. 1988), is instructive. In that case, the defendant argued that he\nwas provided ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney had a conflict of interest arising from his\nbecoming a candidate for the United States Attorney position. In rejecting the defendant's claim, the court found\nno conflict of interest:\n[T]his case presents at most a remote possibility of a conflict of the type with which Cuyler was\nconcerned.... Though it is conceivable that an unprincipled defense attorney in line for a job as\nUnited States Attorney might encourage a defendant in some circumstances to plead guilty in\norder for counsel to curry favor with his or her future employer, that is too fanciful upon which to\nbase a per se rule of conflict.\nId. at 1419-20. The Seventh Circuit contrasted the facts of Horton with those of United States v. Ellison, 798 F.2d\n1102, 1106 (7th Cir.1986), in which a conflict of interest arose where defense counsel explicitly advised the\n\ndefendant to plead guilty to avoid \"making waves\" with federal prosecutors with whom counsel would be working\nin the future. In Horton, however, no evidence was presented to substantiate the defendant's claim that his\ncounsel's advice to him to plead guilty was motivated by his desire to become a United States Attorney. 845 F.2d\nat 1420. There was simply no \"active representation of conflicting interests\" on the part of defendant's counsel. \nId. at 1419; see also United States v. Salerno, 868 F.2d 524, 540-41 (2d Cir.1989) (finding no actual conflict of\ninterest where defense attorney was being investigated by government and was allegedly unusually cooperative\nwith government in defendant's case); United States v. Andrews, 790 F.2d 803, 810-11 (10th Cir.1986) (finding no\nconflict of interest when court refused to allow attorney to withdraw from representation to attend premedical\nstudies at college)\nSimilarly, there appears to be no \"active representation of conflicting interests\" in this case. While the defendants\nhave argued that Ms. Silver's conduct put her job in jeopardy, there are no facts to support this proposition. As\nnoted by the Special Masters, the opposite seems to be true:\n433 *433 The Public Defender's Office has fully supported Ms. Silver in opposing this motion. It has\nprovided her with counsel to defend this motion. It has not removed her from this matter or taken\nany other disciplinary action against her based upon its receipt and review of all of the affidavits\nand arguments contained in the County's motion. Most importantly, in its brief in opposition to this\ndisqualification motion, the Public Defender unequivocally states: \"the Office of the Public\nDefender has no grounds, and no intention to, remove or discipline Ms. Silver.\" ... In view of this\nunequivocal statement, there is no reason to believe that Ms. Silver has any reasonable fear of\ndischarge that would give rise to a conflict of interest between her clients and herself.\nReport and Recommendation at 26. This court concludes that Ms. Silver's interest in keeping her job is far too\ntenuous and speculative to justify a finding of a disqualifying conflict of interest.\n3. Appearance of Impropriety\nThe defendants have also argued that even if there was no actual conflict of interest, Ms. Silver's conduct created\nan appearance of impropriety. The substance of the argument on this point, as presented to the Special Masters,\nwas brief:\nThere can be no dispute that Ms. Silver's unethical conduct has tainted her representation of the\nplaintiff inmates. Her actions evince not merely ignorance but deliberate suppression of\ninformation material to her clients' safety. At the very least, Ms. Silver's continued representation\ncreates an appearance of impropriety. Accordingly, she should be disqualified.\nDefendant's Moving Brf. at 14. The appearance of impropriety is all the more significant in this case, the\ndefendants argue, since Ms. Silver is a government attorney \"invested with the public trust.\" In opposition to this\nfacet of the defendants' motion, the plaintiffs have argued that the appearance of impropriety doctrine applies\nonly to multiple misrepresentation cases, which is obviously not the case here.\nThe Special Masters rejected the defendants' contentions on this point and found that there was no appearance\nof impropriety. In doing so, however, they implicitly accepted the defendants' underlying assumption that the\nappearance of impropriety doctrine was not limited to multiple representation cases, as was argued by the\nplaintiffs. Rather, the Special Masters' conclusion that no appearance of impropriety existed in this case was\nbased on their view that Ms. Silver's conduct was not necessarily improper:\nSetting aside her interviews with Mr. Hellwig, what Ms. Silver stands \"accused\" of doing is\nconducting a vigorous investigation of facts relevant to this litigation and of sharing the information\nthat she found with her clients. But for the fact that her clients are inmates in a correctional\ninstitution, no one would think to criticize her for such conduct. To the contrary, such conduct is\ngenerally considered to be in full accord with an attorney's duties.... If Ms. Silver erred in sending\nthe scheduling information to her clients, we believe that she did so innocently, with no intention\nother than to provide proper representation to her clients.\n\nReport and Recommendation at 29, 31.\nAs will be discussed more fully later in this opinion, this court must diverge from the Special Masters' reasoning in\nthis regard. I do not concur in the underlying assumption of their analysis that the disclosure of this security\nsensitive information was simply an innocent oversight on the part of Ms. Silver. This court views Ms. Silver's\nconduct as a clear and obvious breach of security. It was akin to providing the inmates with the keys to their cells.\nHowever, I do concur in the Special Masters' ultimate conclusion that the appearance of impropriety rules do not\napply to this factual scenario.\nAs an initial matter, this court must reject the plaintiffs' argument that the appearance of impropriety standard\napplies only to multiple representation cases. As pointed out by the plaintiffs, the phrase \"appearance of\nimpropriety\" is explicitly used in RPC 1.7(c)(2), which is part of the general conflict of interest rule. RPC 1.7(c)\nprovides as follows:\n434 *434 [RPC 1.7] shall not alter the effect of case law or ethics opinions to the effect that:\n(1) in certain cases or categories of cases involving conflicts or apparent conflicts, consent to\ncontinued representation is immaterial, and\n(2) in certain cases or situations creating an appearance of impropriety rather than an actual\nconflict, multiple representation is not permissible, that is, in those situations in which an ordinary\nknowledgeable citizen acquainted with the facts would conclude that the multiple representation\nposes substantial risk of disservice to either the public interest or the interest of one of the clients.\n(Emphasis supplied).\nWhile the plaintiffs acknowledge that the appearance doctrine is incorporated by reference in RPC 1.9, they\nmaintain that the doctrine's applicability is limited only to multiple representation cases.\nThe plaintiffs have taken an overly restrictive view of the applicability of the appearance of impropriety doctrine. It\nis not, as they have argued, limited only to multiple representation cases. For example, the doctrine is \"indirectly\"\nfound in RPC 1.13(e), concerning an attorney's representation of an organization. See In re Opinion No. 569, 103\nN.J. 325, 330 n. 4, 511 A.2d 119 (1986). In addition, the doctrine is incorporated by reference in RPC 3.7(b),\nwhich concerns the issue of an attorney acting as a witness. See id. While this court does not doubt the plaintiffs'\ncontention that much of the case law concerning the appearance doctrine involves multiple representation, the\ndoctrine is not necessarily limited to those particular factual scenarios. See, e.g., In re Tenure Hearing, 103 N.J.\n548, 511 A.2d 1171 (1986) (involving issue of whether attorney who previously served as administrative law\njudge in Office of Administrative Law and had presided in case involving particular parties should be disqualified\nfrom representing as private attorney one of those parties in another but different contested case before Office of\nAdministrative Law).\nThat being said, the applicability of the appearance of impropriety doctrine is also not quite as broad as the\ndefendants implicitly suggest. It does not apply to conduct which may simply be improper or inappropriate.\nIndeed, if the doctrine were so broadly applied, all other ethical provisions would be entirely superfluous. Rather,\nwhile the doctrine is not limited to multiple representation cases, it is evident that it applies mainly to those cases\nin which the loyalty of the attorney to his client is at stake or where there is not an actual conflict of interest but\nthe policies underpinning the conflict of interest rules are implicated. That is why, for instance, the appearance\ndoctrine applies not only to multiple representation cases 00 which are the clearest example of where an\n97\nattorney's loyalty to his client may be compromised 00 but also to cases in which the attorney may act as a\n97\nwitness. See RPC 3.7. Clearly, the appearance of impropriety is applicable to those cases in which an attorney's\nduty of loyal representation to his client may be unduly influenced by extraneous factors. In addition, the\nappearance doctrine may apply to disqualify an attorney, for example, who hired his adversary's former expert\nwitness after the adversary had divulged confidential information to that expert. Cordy v. Sherwin-Williams Co.,\n156 F.R.D. 575 (D.N.J.1994). Cordy presented a situation where there was no actual conflict of interest, but the\ndanger of the side-switching expert witness divulging confidential information implicated the underlying rationale\nof the conflict of interest rules.\n\nUnder the circumstances of this case, a determination as to whether Ms. Silver's conduct gave rise to an\nappearance of impropriety focuses not on the appropriateness of her conduct in and of itself, but on whether her\nconduct in any way compromised her duty of loyalty to her clients. The defendants' argument then appears to be\nan offshoot of their argument concerning an actual conflict of interest, discussed above. That is, the defendants'\ncontention seems to be that an appearance of impropriety arose in this case because Ms. Silver's alleged\nmisconduct in acquiring and distributing the scheduling information violated the regulations of the Public\nDefenders Office, and thus, could lead to her dismissal if the truth were revealed.\n435 *435 While the appearance doctrine applies where no actual conflict exists, the New Jersey Supreme Court has\nadvised that there \"`must be something more than a fanciful possibility,'\" and there must be \"`a reasonable\nbasis.'\" Dewey v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 109 N.J. 201, 216, 536 A.2d 243 (1988) (quoting Higgins v.\nAdvisory Comm. on Prof'l Ethics, 73 N.J. 123, 129, 373 A.2d 372 (1977)). This court concludes that Ms. Silver's\ninterest in keeping her job is far too tenuous and speculative to support a finding of an appearance of impropriety.\nThere is simply no evidence, apart from the defendants' allegations, that Ms. Silver's employment was ever in\njeopardy and that her conduct in this matter was in some measure dictated by this personal interest. Accordingly,\nthis court finds that there was no appearance of impropriety in this case.\n4. False Statement of Material Fact or Law\nThe defendants have also sought disqualification based on Ms. Silver's alleged breach of RPC 4.1(a)(1) arising\nfrom her conversations with Mr. Hellwig on December 6 and 8, 1995. Specifically, the defendants contended that\nMs. Silver lied to Mr. Hellwig concerning her dissemination of officer staffing information to the inmate\nrepresentatives at the Jail Annex. Ms. Silver has argued that she made no misrepresentation to Mr. Hellwig, and\neven if she did, she owed no duty to Mr. Hellwig and thus could not have misled him in violation of RPC 4.1(a)(1).\nThe Special Masters rejected the plaintiffs' contentions and found that the facts supported the conclusion that she\n[6]\nhad violated RPC 4.1(a)(1).  As the issue was correctly framed by the Special Masters, the question here is\nwhether Ms. Silver was sufficiently forthcoming in her discussions with Mr. Hellwig on the topic of her\ndissemination of officer staffing information. Although I agree that Ms. Silver was not sufficiently candid and\nforthcoming in her discussions with Mr. Hellwig, based upon my review of the entire record in this case and in\nparticular the testimony of Mr. Hellwig at the April 17, 1997 hearing, this court finds that Ms. Silver did not\ntechnically violate RPC 4.1(a)(1).\nRPC 4.1(a)(1) provides that \"[i]n representing a client a lawyer shall not knowingly ... make a false statement of\nmaterial fact or law to a third person.\" As noted by the Special Masters, RPC 4.1 requires scrupulous honesty,\nparticularly in dealing with adversaries and the court.\nAs noted above, Mr. Hellwig and Ms. Silver offered slightly different versions of what transpired on December 6\n436 and 8, 1995. In determining that Ms. Silver was not sufficiently forthcoming in her conversations *436 with Mr.\nHellwig, the Special Masters rejected the plaintiffs' contention that there was a distinction between \"officer staffing\nschedules\" and \"officer staffing information\":\nWe are also troubled by the undue precision of her certification in response to the motion. For\nexample, although she admits that Mr. Hellwig asked her about officer staffing information to the\ninmates, she consistently stresses that he asked whether she had sent \"Officer Staffing\nSchedules\" to the inmates and did not use some more general term. She always capitalizes the\nphrase as though it were a proper noun, necessarily limited in its application to specific group of\ndocuments. We do not generally view the phrase \"officer staffing schedules\" as a proper noun.\nGiven the semiotic difficulties of daily communication, we cannot imagine how she knew, or could\npossibly have known, that Mr. Hellwig was using the phrase with such precision. More likely,\nwhatever the exact phrase employed, Mr. Hellwig was asking about whether she sent detailed\ninformation regarding officer staffing schedules to the inmates.\n\nReport and Recommendation at 18-19. Mr. Hellwig, however, was aware of the difference between \"officer\nstaffing schedules\" and \"officer staffing information,\" although it is also clear that he may not have intended to\nmake such a distinction when he queried Ms. Silver:\nQ. Now, when, Mr. Hellwig, when you spoke on the telephone with Susan Silver, and I believe the\ndate was December 6th, although in your affidavit or your certification you indicate it was\nDecember 7th, whatever the date was, December 6th or 7th, when you spoke with Miss Silver you\nhad in front of you the letter that she had sent, the two page letter that she had sent to the inmate\nreps. Isn't that correct?\nA. That is correct.\nQ. And that letter indicated that she had provided the inmate reps with the officer staffing analysis\nor the officer staffing memorandum. Isn't that correct?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And she specifically referred to it as an officer staffing memorandum and you knew it as an\nofficer staffing memorandum. Isn't that correct?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And isn't that 00 isn't that in your mind, as well as in 00 well, isn't that in your mind, Mr. Hellwig,\n97 97\ndistinct from an officer staffing schedule?\nA. Yes, it is.\nQ. What is the difference?\nA. Well, the schedules themselves are 00 capture a moment in time, an eight hour period, 24 hour\n97\nperiod.... The memorandum that was written captured an extended period of time, I believe in\nexcess of 60 days.\n* * * * * *\nQ. And Susan Silver's memorandum was nothing like that, was it?\nA. No, it was not.\nQ. It was a very different thing than a daily officer staffing schedule. Is that right?\nA. Yes.\nTestimony of Martin Hellwig, April 17, 1997 at 1.79-80; 1.83.\nMr. Hellwig's testimony also revealed that he asked specifically about \"officer staffing schedules,\" rather than\ngeneral staffing information, and that Ms. Silver's response was, technically speaking, not untrue:\nQ. But you say that at some point during the conversation you asked her the question did she\nprovide scheduling 00 schedules to her clients. Is that correct?\n97\nA. Yes.\nQ. And her answer was what?\nA. No, she would not do that.\nQ. And that's the truth, isn't it?\n* * * * * *\n\nA. As far as I know.\nId. at 1.86-87.\nThe Special Masters also found that Ms. Silver misled Mr. Hellwig by remaining silent when he made certain\nstatements concerning the general nature of the information contained in her memorandum. The Special Masters\n437 focused specifically on the following *437 statements made by Ms. Silver in her certification:\n33. Mr. Hellwig told me that he actually did not have the officer staffing memorandum that I\nattached to my September 29, 1995 letter to the Inmate Representatives. However, Mr. Hellwig\nstated that as long as the information that I put in the officer staffing memorandum was general in\nnature, he was sure there was no harm done.\n34. I did not make any comment on Mr. Hellwig's characterization of my officer staffing\nmemorandum. At no point did I characterize the scheduling memorandum \"as having only the\nmost general information\" as Mr. Hellwig now claims. (Hellwig Certification, paras. 5 and 6). This\nwas Mr. Hellwig's characterization, not mine. (Emphasis in original).\nThe Special Masters concluded that, under the circumstances, it was incumbent upon Ms. Silver to correct Mr.\nHellwig's assumption concerning the \"general nature\" of the memorandum she had provided to the inmates:\nWe believe Ms. Silver is attempting to draw too fine a line as to her ethical responsibilities. ... It is\nnot enough that every word spoken may have been truthful. One can misrepresent and mislead by\nsilence as well as by speech. See, e.g., Jewish Ctr. of Sussex County v. Whale, 86 N.J. 619, 432\nA.2d 521 (1981). Ms. Silver certainly knew what she had sent to the inmates, that Mr. Hellwig and\nthe County considered the question of what she had sent to be an important one and that she was\nleaving Mr. Hellwig with a misunderstanding as to the nature of what she had sent.\nReport and Recommendation at 18.\nWhile I agree that silence can have the effect of misleading just as an affirmative representation, I do not believe\nthat Mr. Hellwig could reasonably have been misled in this case. The memorandum in question was already in\nthe hands of defendants' counsel since it was addressed to them. Moreover, while Mr. Hellwig did not have a\ncopy of the memorandum in front of him during the telephone conversation with Ms. Silver, he testified that he\nhad reviewed the memorandum previously:\nQ. Just to clarify, Mr. Hellwig, while you were conversing on the phone with Miss Silver, you had in\nfront of you a copy of the cover letter but not a copy of the memorandum?\nA. That's correct.\nQ. But you had seen the memorandum several weeks earlier and you knew what the contents of\nthe memorandum were?\nA. That is also correct.\nQ. The contents of the memorandum were not the equivalent of an officers staffing schedule?\nA. That's correct.\nTestimony of Martin Hellwig, April 17, 1997 at 1.85. Mr. Hellwig had already reviewed Ms. Silver's memorandum,\nand thus, he was in a position to know whether it contained general information, as he had characterized it, or\nspecific details of staffing deficiencies.\nWhile this court finds that Ms. Silver did not technically violate RPC 4.1(a)(1), I concur with the Special Masters'\noverall assessment that Ms. Silver played far too close to the line of reasonable conduct. As the New Jersey\nSupreme Court has recognized:\n\nIt has been noted that \"the Code of Professional Responsibility is not designed for Holmes'\nproverbial `bad man' who wants to know just how many corners he may cut, how close to the line\nhe may play, without running into trouble with the law.\" General Motors Corp. v. City of New York,\n501 F.2d 639, 649 (2d Cir.1974) (quoting O.W. Holmes, The Path of the Law, in Collected Legal\nPapers 170 (1920)). Rather, \"it is drawn for the `good man' as a beacon to assist him in navigating\nan ethical course through the sometimes murky waters of professional conduct.\" Id.\nReardon v. Marlayne, Inc., 83 N.J. 460, 469, 416 A.2d 852 (1980). In this light, I am extremely troubled by Ms.\nSilver's less than candid statements and non-statements to Mr. Hellwig. Rather than acknowledging that she had\nprovided officer staffing information to prison inmates, she, for reasons which escape this court, was not\n438 forthcoming and at *438 times disingenuous. For instance, Ms. Silver stated in her certification: \"I also told Mr.\nHellwig that I never would send Officer Staffing Schedules to the inmates.\" While she may not have sent the\ninmates the actual schedules themselves, she did send a detailed summary of the schedules. This summary,\nwhich provided specific information concerning staffing shortages, was far more useful that the actual schedules\nthemselves. By stating that she would never send \"Officer Staffing Schedules,\" Ms. Silver created the impression\nthat she recognized the dangers in providing that type of information. That is the only reasonable interpretation of\n[7]\nthat statement within this context.\nUnder the facts presented to this court, however, I am constrained to find that Ms. Silver's statements made to\nMr. Hellwig did not rise to the level of willful dishonesty contemplated by RPC 4.1.\n5. Disqualification\nAlthough this court finds that Ms. Silver did not technically violate a specific RPC provision, disqualification is\nnevertheless required as security breaches of this sort simply cannot be countenanced. Ms. Silver, as the\ninmates principal attorney in this case, certainly had a duty to zealously represent her clients. Having reviewed\nthe record as whole, however, this court gained the distinct impression that at some point during this litigation,\nMs. Silver's representation of the inmates became something more than mere zealous advocacy. In this\ntransformation, Ms. Silver lost the perspective of an advocate, one whose duties run not only to clients but also to\nthe court and the public. The dual responsibilities of an advocate are starkly implicated in this case, which\ninvolves inmates and the conditions of their confinement. As their attorney, Ms. Silver had a duty to zealously\nrepresent their interests; yet at the same time, she had a countervailing duty to the court and to the public to\nensure that that representation did not increase the risk of security breaches at the jail facilities. Admittedly, the\n439 line between zealous advocacy and a breach of security, *439 under the circumstances of this case, may be quite\ndifficult to distinguish at times. This is not one of those times. That one should not provide inmates with detailed\ninformation concerning specific staffing deficiencies is derived not from any subtlety of law, but from common\nsense. Breaching security again, after assuring the court otherwise, is sheer recklessness.\nAlthough many of the reported decisions concerning disqualification of attorneys concern conflicts of interest,\nother forms of attorney misconduct may also justify disqualification. See, e.g., Papanicolaou v. Chase Manhattan\nBank, N.A., 720 F.Supp. 1080 (S.D.N.Y.1989) (holding disqualification of defendant's attorney warranted after\nprivate conversation between him and plaintiff in which he disparaged plaintiff's counsel). Indeed, disqualification\nof an attorney need not be predicated upon a finding that a specific RPC rule has been violated. See United\nStates v. Voigt, 89 F.3d 1050, 1076 n. 12 (3d Cir.),cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 117 S.Ct. 623, 136 L.Ed.2d 546\n(1996); Cordy, 156 F.R.D. at 583. As the Third Circuit explained:\nThe \"fair and proper administration of justice\" side of the equation merely \"include[s] the interests\nunderlying the ethical standards governing the practice of law....;\" it is neither defined nor\ncircumscribed by those standards. On the contrary, a district court has independent interests in\nprotecting its judgments against later collateral attack, preserving the integrity of its proceedings,\nand protecting the truth-seeking function of the proceedings.\n\nVoigt, 89 F.3d at 1076 n. 12 (citations omitted); see also Inorganic Coatings, Inc. v. Falberg, 926 F.Supp. 517,\n519 (E.D.Pa.1995) (\"Courts have vital interests in protecting the integrity of their judgments, maintaining public\nconfidence in the integrity of the bar, eliminating conflicts of interest, and protecting confidential communications\nbetween attorneys and their clients. To protect these vital interests, courts have the power to disqualify an\nattorney from representing a particular client.\").\nThe power to disqualify an attorney from a particular action emanates from the \"inherent powers of any federal\ncourt [over the] admission and discipline of attorneys practicing before it.\" In re Corn Derivatives Antitrust Litig.,\n748 F.2d 157, 160 (3d Cir.1984); see also Fineman v. Armstrong World Indus., Inc., 1993 WL 414752 at *5\n(D.N.J. July 30, 1993) (\"Inherent in this Court's power to manage the cases on its docket is the power to impose\nsanctions where an attorney's misbehavior is prejudicial to an adversary ... or threatens the orderly administration\nof justice....\"); Kleiner v. First Nat'l Bank of Atlanta, 751 F.2d 1193, 1209 (11th Cir.1985) (\"A trial judge possesses\nthe inherent power to discipline counsel for misconduct, short of behavior giving rise to disbarment or criminal\ncensure, without resort to the powers of civil or criminal contempt.\"); United States v. Miller, 624 F.2d 1198, 1201\n(3d Cir.1980) (noting that \"district court's power to disqualify an attorney derives from its inherent authority to\nsupervise the professional conduct of attorneys appearing before it\"). Thus, while as a general matter courts\n\"exist to resolve disputes, and not to discipline lawyers who come before them,\" district courts have a \"`duty to\nsupervise members of its bar.'\" Papanicolaou, 720 F.Supp. at 1082-83 (quoting NCK Org. Ltd. v. Bregman, 542\nF.2d 128, 131 (2d Cir.1976)); see also Kevlik v. Goldstein, 724 F.2d 844, 847 (1st Cir.1984); Meat Price\nInvestigators Ass'n v. Spencer Foods, Inc., 572 F.2d 163, 165 (8th Cir.1978). The exercise of this inherent\nauthority in determining whether an attorney should be disqualified is committed to the sound discretion of this\ncourt. See Miller, 624 F.2d at 1201; Fineman, 1993 WL 414752 at *5.\nAs another member of this court has recognized, \"motions to disqualify are generally viewed with `disfavor' and\ndisqualification is considered a `drastic measure which courts should hesitate to impose except when absolutely\nnecessary.'\" Alexander v. Primerica Holdings, Inc., 822 F.Supp. 1099, 1114 (D.N.J.1993) (quoting Schiessle v.\nStephens, 717 F.2d 417, 420 (7th Cir.1983)). Thus, although doubts are to be resolved in favor of disqualification,\n440 a party seeking disqualification has a \"`heavy burden'\" and *440 must satisfy a \"`high standard of proof.'\" Id.\n(quoting Evans v. Artek Sys. Corp., 715 F.2d 788, 791 (2d Cir.1983)). Stated simply, \"when deciding on a motion\nfor disqualification, a court should proceed with caution.\" Moss v. TACC Int'l Corp., 776 F.Supp. 622, 624\n(D.Mass.1991).\nNumerous courts that have addressed the issue of disqualification of attorneys seem to agree that disqualification\nis justified when an attorney's continued participation will taint the proceedings. See Fineman, 1993 WL 414752\nat *6 (\"The focal point of this Court's decision must be the entry of an order calculated to insure, as much as\npossible, the orderly, appropriate and focused conduct of this litigation during ensuing trial and pretrial\nproceedings.\"). As a general matter, \"a district judge should disqualify the offending counsel when the integrity of\nthe adversarial process is at stake.\" Papanicolaou, 720 F.Supp. at 1083. As noted by the Second Circuit, the\n\"business of the court is to dispose of litigation and not to act as a general overseer of the ethics of those who\npractice here unless the questioned behavior taints the trial of the cause before it.\" W.T. Grant Co. v. Haines, 531\nF.2d 671, 677 (2d Cir.1976); see also World Youth Day, Inc. v. Famous Artists Merchandising Exch., Inc., 866\nF.Supp. 1297, 1303 (D.Colo.1994); Parkinson v. Phonex Corp., 857 F.Supp. 1474, 1476 (D.Utah 1994); Beck v.\nBoard of Regents of State of Kan., 568 F.Supp. 1107 (D.Kan.1983). Put differently, if past improprieties are\nshown to have occurred, disqualification is appropriate where \"the likelihood of public suspicion or obloquy\noutweighs the social interest which will be served by a lawyer's continued participation in a particular case.\" \nKleiner, 751 F.2d at 1210.\nIn the same vein, \"a violation of professional ethics rules does not alone trigger disqualification ...; rather, a trial\njudge should primarily assess the possibility of prejudice at trial that might result form the attorney's unethical\nact.\" Papanicolaou, 720 F.Supp. at 1083. As one court has recognized, however, courts must be ever mindful that\n[t]he preservation of public trust both in the scrupulous administration of justice and in the integrity\nof the bar is paramount. Recognizably important [is the party's] right to counsel of her choice....\n[That] consideration [] must yield, however, to considerations of ethics which run to the very\nintegrity of our judicial process.\n\nHull v. Celanese Corp., 513 F.2d 568, 572 (2d Cir.1975).\nThe Special Masters have recommended that this court deny the defendants' motion to disqualify Ms. Silver,\ndespite their finding that \"Ms. Silver engaged in conduct that was knowingly misleading.\" Report and\nRecommendation at 32. The basis of this determination seems to have been two-fold. First, the Special Masters\nconcluded that Ms. Silver's conduct in misleading Mr. Hellwig was not seriously detrimental to the defendants or\nto the security of the facility. The Special Masters concluded that despite Ms. Silver's conduct in misleading Mr.\nHellwig, there was no prejudice either to the defendants or to the integrity of the litigation before this court.\nThe second basis for the Special Masters' recommendation against disqualification is their conclusion to the\ncontention implicitly raised by the defendants, that Ms. Silver should be disqualified because she exercised\nextremely bad judgment in divulging security sensitive information to the inmate representatives and then\ndenying that she had done so when the county investigated the allegation. The Special Masters concluded that\nwhile evincing bad judgment, Ms. Silver's conduct in disseminating this information was insufficient to disqualify\nher.\nWith all due respect to the Special Masters, I must disagree with their assessment on these points, particularly in\nlight of events which occurred subsequent to the issuance of their report. This court views Ms. Silver's conduct in\ndisseminating the officer staffing information 00 which the Special Masters determined was only implicitly argued\n97\nby the defendants 00 and the disclosure of the time and place of the outside medical appointment to Quran\n97\nJohnson to be at the heart of this matter.\n441 *441 The philosophy behind the security procedures developed at the Jail Annex has been described as one of\n\"carefully-cultivated uncertainty.\" This philosophy seeks to deter inmate misbehavior 00 attacks on other inmates\n97\nor officers and escapes 00 by keeping them unsure as to when and where corrections officers may be in the\n97\nvicinity. By providing detailed information concerning officer staffing at the Jail Annex, Ms. Silver recklessly\nbreached an essential aspect of the security measures at the facility. While Ms. Silver, in her discussions with Mr.\nHellwig, made much of the fact that she had not provided the inmates with the actual officer staffing schedules,\nwhat she did provide was a detailed memorandum summarizing what she viewed as key deficiencies in staffing\nat particular times. This memorandum therefore was considerably more useful than the unanalyzed data\ncontained in the actual officer staffing schedules.\nMs. Silver attempted to minimize the significance of what she had done by pointing out that the \"officer staffing\ninformation ... sent to the inmates was not current information, and the inmates know even more about the officer\nstaffing problems than the information reflected either in the memorandum or in the Officer Staffing Schedules\nthemselves.\" Certification of Susan R. Silver, February 26, 1996 at ยถ 30. Ms. Silver also tried to justify the\ndissemination of this material by contending that the level of officer staffing was an issue in the underlying\nlitigation, and thus, a legitimate area of concern for the inmates. I find these assertions to be quite disingenuous.\nFirst, with respect to her claim that the inmates know more about staffing issues at the Jail Annex, the plaintiffs\nprovided no evidence to support this statement. Moreover, as noted by the Special Masters:\nWhatever knowledge the sizable class of inmates may have as a whole, it cannot be seriously\nmaintained that any individual inmate had as much staffing knowledge as is contained in Ms.\nSilver's memorandum or in the schedules themselves. An individual may know the situation in his\nor her particular area of the Jail Annex, but the nature of jail life does not permit the type of pooling\nof information that is reflected in Ms. Silver's memorandum.\nReport and Recommendation at 20.\nSecond, the plaintiffs' contention that the information contained in the memorandum was dated is unpersuasive.\nThe information was indeed current when it was first sent to the inmates in late September or early October,\n1995. The memorandum is dated September 29, 1995 and analyzed the schedules for the period between\nAugust 1, 1995 and September 22, 1995.\n\nAnd third, while officer staffing may have been an issue in the underlying litigation, Ms. Silver herself testified that\nit was not necessary for the inmates to have the detailed information contained in her memorandum:\nQ. Do you think the inmates needed to know the particular details of 60 days of scheduling in\norder to understand what your position was going to be in the settlement?\nA. Well, it's actually 53 days of scheduling, but no, they don't need to know that level of detail,\nwhich is the reason why I agreed not to give them that level of detail and since September 9, I\nnever have and before September 29, I never did.\nQ. That's right, before September 29, you had never found it necessary to send that level of detail\nto the inmates to comply with your ethical obligation to the client to inform the client about what\nyou do. Is that correct?\nA. I have an ethical obligation to keep them informed.\nI do not have an ethical obligation to keep them informed to that level of detail, which is why I am\nable to agree not to do so, now that I'm aware of the county security concerns\nTestimony of Susan R. Silver, April 18, 1997 at 58-59.\nIn determining that disqualification was not warranted in this case, the Special Masters appear to have concluded\nthat Ms. Silver was only attempting to vigorously represent her clients, and that \"[b]ut for the fact that her clients\n442 are inmates in a correctional institution, no one would think to criticize her for *442 such conduct.\" Report and\nRecommendation at 29. The point, however, is that her clients are indeed inmates in a correctional institution,\nand that fact cannot be simply pushed to the side in assessing the wrongfulness of Ms. Silver's conduct. The\nSpecial Masters stated:\nWhile an attorney, like any other person, may not knowingly aid or abet the commission of a crime\n... we are not at all certain that an attorney representing inmates is expected to presume that her\nclients will use information provided with an innocent purpose for an improper purpose. The\nquestion of whether a lawyer representing a class of this sort has some sort of special duty to\nexpect the worst from her clients is one that has not been decided, or even discussed in any of the\nprecedent cited to us.\nId. (citation omitted). I cannot agree with this assertion. The very real dangers in jails and prisons of escapes and\nattacks on prison staff as well as other inmates are quite evident to any lay person let alone an attorney, such as\nMs. Silver, who has been intimately involved in their operations for many years. Ms. Silver gave inmates detailed\ninformation of when and where officers were not on duty. As Ms. Silver admitted at the April, 1997 hearing, there\nwas absolutely no need on the part of the inmates to have this level of detailed information. Under these\ncircumstances, I do not believe that to \"expect the worst from her clients\" is somehow on the fringes of rational\nthought. The necessity of strict security measures in prisons and jails is based on the reasonable presumption\nthat under certain circumstances prisoners, if left to their own devices, will indeed do their worst.\nIn this case, evidence was presented that at least one inmate did escape on the strength of information obtained\nfrom Ms. Silver's memorandum. In his certification, Billy Pereira stated that he escaped form the Jail Annex on\nOctober 26, 1995 \"after having read a memorandum ... that highlighted the posts that lacked supervision by\ncorrections officers.\" Certification of Billy Pereira, January 19, 1996 at ยถ 1. That memorandum, he stated,\nindicated that there were no guards on duty near Satellite 3. Two days after reading the memorandum, Mr.\nPereira escaped through Satellite 3. The plaintiffs have questioned whether Mr. Pereira could have digested the\nmemorandum in the five minutes he had possession of the document. This court, however, finds Mr. Pereira's\ncertification to have been credible. There appears no reason why he would have lied in the certification, as he\nwas not promised anything in return. See id. at ยถ 4. Moreover, I do not find his testimony to have been inherently\nincredible. Mr. Pereira did not state in his certification that he carefully read through and digested the entire\nmemorandum. Rather, he stated only that he determined from the memorandum that no security personnel was\non duty on Satellite 3. Surely, five minutes was enough time to gain this valuable information.\n\nTo a great extent, however, the wrongfulness of Ms. Silver's conduct does not turn on Mr. Pereira's escape. Nor\ndoes it truly matter that no other escapes were connected to the memorandum. The dissemination of the\ninformation concerning officer staffing at the Jail Annex was wrongful because it unjustifiably increased the risk of\nsecurity breaches. The fact that more escapes did not result or other acts of inmate misbehavior perpetrated was\nsimply fortuitous, and thus, in no way diminishes the very real risk and danger that Ms. Silver created.\nHad this court been confronted only with the dissemination of the officer staffing information, her disqualification\nwould certainly have been a close question. This court may very well have accepted the Special Masters'\nconclusion that \"the experience of this motion will cause Ms. Silver and other counsel from the Public Defender's\noffice to carefully review materials provided to their clients so as to avoid providing detailed information on\nmatters affecting jail security.\" Report and Recommendation at 31. Based on the Quran Johnson affair, however,\nwhich occurred after Ms. Silver had explicitly assured this court that she appreciated the security concerns at the\njail facilities, disqualification appears to be the only reasonable sanction which this court can impose to maintain\n443 safety *443 at the jail facilities as well as the integrity of this case.\nMs. Silver, contrary to direct assurances to this court, clearly did not appreciate the security concerns at the Jail\nAnnex. As noted above, Quran Johnson was informed by a letter from Ms. Silver that he would receive outside\nmedical attention for his ailment, and that such appointment would occur on May 23, 1997 at 11:00 a.m. While\nthere is no indication that Mr. Johnson attempted to escape on the strength of this information, the disclosure of\nthis security sensitive information clearly impacts upon this court's determination of the propriety of Ms. Silver's\ncontinued participation in this case. The plaintiffs do not dispute that this breach occurred, but contend that it was\nmerely an oversight caused by an extremely heavy caseload undertaken by Ms. Silver.\nThis court cannot and will not excuse Ms. Silver's conduct based on her assertions of too much work and\noversight. Before this court, Ms. Silver stated unequivocally that she would never send this type of information to\nher clients:\nA. I receive frequently medical information with dates as to when inmates are scheduled to receive\nsurgery in outside hospitals or clinics or outside medical specialists appointments to evaluate their\nmedical problems.\nBack in, I believe early 1994, Mr. Del Plato mentioned to me that the county treats that information\nas being confidential because if inmates knew when they were going to be leaving jail grounds for\na medical appointment, that poses a security threat in terms of making an escape easier.\nEver since Mr. Del Plato made that comment to me, I have been very careful to never tell inmates\nwhen they're going to be leaving the grounds for a medical appointment or surgery.\nTestimony of Susan R. Silver, April 18, 1997 at 113. Ms. Silver was also reminded of the security protocols\nconcerning outside medical appointments by Ronald Manzella, the Director of Corrections for Essex County. In\nhis Second Certification, Mr. Manzella stated:\nSusan Silver, the attorney for the plaintiff class, has been reminded in my presence that because\nof security concerns, it is essential that when medical appointments are scheduled for the\ninmates, she can provide the inmates only with a general response, but absolutely cannot tell\nthem when and where the care will be provided. I can recall at least three occasions when I\npersonally spoke to Ms. Silver or her substitute, Cindy Salisbury [sic], Esq., about this protocol. I\ncan recall at least one occasion when the protocol was discussed with Ms. Silver in the presence\nof the Special Masters.\nSecond Certification of Ronald H. Manzella, May 30, 1997 at ยถ 7.\nAt the very least, this conduct on the part of Ms. Silver negatively impacts on her repeated assurances that she\nappreciated and understood the security sensitive nature of much of her work. One would have assumed that\nhaving explicitly assured this court that conduct of this type would not occur again, Ms. Silver would have taken\nparticular care in handling security sensitive information. This assumption was evidently not well founded, and in\n\nthis light, it is equally clear that Ms. Silver's assurances that these types of security breaches would not occur\nagain were simply hollow, delivered to appease the concerns of both this court and the defendant jail officials.\nIn response to the Quran Johnson affair, as well as the dissemination of the officer staffing information, the\nplaintiffs appear to have implemented a new protocol which requires that any material sent to inmates be\nreviewed by a supervisor in the Public Defender's Office. Based on the implementation of this new protocol, the\nplaintiffs once again attempt to assure this court that security breaches will not occur again. Based on the history\nof this case, I can no longer accept these assurances. If Ms. Silver were a lower level attorney without significant\ncontact with the inmates, this new procedure may certainly be sufficient to ameliorate this court's anxieties. Ms.\nSilver, however, is not a low level attorney. She is the principal attorney in this case representing the inmates, and\n444 as such, has extensive communication *444 with her clients, both in written correspondence and personal\nmeetings. Under these circumstances, I cannot be assured that having a supervisor review materials sent to the\ninmates for security sensitive material is sufficient.\nThis court finds that the dissemination of the officer staffing information to the inmates and Ms. Silver's disclosure\nof security sensitive information to Quran Johnson compel this court to disqualify Ms. Silver from further\nrepresentation of the plaintiffs. In their Report and Recommendation, the Special Masters determined that a\ncourt's principal concern in resolving a disqualification motion was the integrity of the litigation before it.\nDisqualification is warranted, they found, when there is the \"`possibility of prejudice at trial that might result from\nthe attorney's unethical act.'\" Report and Recommendation at 34 (quoting Papanicolaou, 720 F.Supp. at 1083).\nBased on this standard, the Special Masters concluded that no prejudice existed in this case, reasoning that\n\"[t]rial of the case is an assessment of the proofs and the law ... [and][i]t is not an assessment of the lawyers'\ncredibility.\" Id.\nThis court finds that the Special Masters clearly erred in this assessment and have taken a overly narrow view of\nthe requirement that there must be the possibility of prejudice at trial. While in an ordinary case the appropriate\nstandard may very well be the potential prejudice at trial, this is not an ordinary case. Applying this standard in an\noverly formalistic way to this particular matter would ignore the unique nature of this case. These two class action\nlawsuits filed on behalf of the inmates concern the very significant issue of the conditions of confinement at the\nEssex County Jail and Jail Annex. Each case was settled, and many aspects of jail operations are now governed\nby a series of consent orders. This court has, and has had for quite some time, the responsibility of overseeing\ncompliance with those consent orders. At this stage, this matter will in all likelihood not go to trial. Accordingly, the\nappropriate standard to be applied in this case is whether there will be prejudice to the continued enforcement of\nthe consent decrees. I find that Ms. Silver's conduct has prejudiced the continued enforcement of the consent\ndecrees.\nTo ensure compliance with the consent orders, it is imperative that information concerning jail operations be\nprovided to the plaintiffs' representatives and this court. Much of this information no doubt contains security\nsensitive materials which the defendants would not ordinarily provide to any outside parties. That the defendants\nmust do so to ensure compliance with the consent orders, however, in no way diminishes the sensitive nature of\nthis information. Due to Ms. Silver's conduct, the defendants have a legitimate concern over whether such\ninformation will be treated by Ms. Silver with the appropriate level of security which it requires. This legitimate\nconcern arises from the simple fact that the defendants are ultimately responsible for maintaining the security of\nthe facilities, in order to protect the public, the staff, and the inmates. The concern over maintaining the\nappropriate level of security may lead the defendants, consciously or subconsciously, to limit their disclosure of\ninformation to Ms. Silver. Accordingly, the defendants are faced with the dilemma of freely providing important yet\nsensitive information to Ms. Silver, which may create the risk of a breach of security, on the one hand, and\ncurtailing the disclosure of that information, thereby risking non-compliance with the consent orders.\nThe dilemma faced by the defendants will clearly affect this court's truth-finding function, as well as its efforts to\nensure full and continued compliance with the consent orders. The issues concerning the conditions of\nconfinement raised in these class actions are of great import not only to the inmates themselves but also to the\npublic. Yet these significant issues cannot be properly addressed by this court or the parties in an atmosphere\nwhere the continued security of the facility is jeopardized. Security breaches of the type resulting from Ms.\nSilver's conduct can only undermine this court's duty to oversee compliance with the consent orders on the part\n\nof the defendants. The continued viability of this court's oversight function over the Essex County Jail and Jail\n445 Annex, *445 therefore, can suffer no instances of recklessness as evidenced by Ms. Silver's conduct.\nThis court is cognizant of the policy that in determining whether an attorney should be disqualified, a court should\nbe mindful that although a party has no right to particular counsel, see International Business Machines Corp. v.\nLevin, 579 F.2d 271, 283 (3d Cir.1978), \"`a party's choice of counsel is entitled to substantial deference,'\" \nAlexander, 822 F.Supp. at 1114 (quoting Commonwealth Ins. Co. v. Graphix Hot Line, Inc., 808 F.Supp. 1200,\n1208 (E.D.Pa.1992)). This court is also well aware of the fact that Ms. Silver has represented the plaintiff class for\nquite some time. However, I do not believe that these considerations outweigh the need for disqualification in this\ncase. This is not a case where, for instance, we are on the eve of trial and disqualification of a party's attorney will\nwork an extreme prejudice on that party. Indeed, this court notes that Ms. Silver took an eight month leave of\nabsence in 1996. During that time, her duties were undertaken by Deputy Public Defender Cindy Salsbury, Esq.\nAccordingly, this court finds that the plaintiffs' interest in Ms. Silver's continued participation in this case does not\noutweigh the need for this court to preserve the integrity of these proceedings. The parties have not provided\nsuggestions of lesser sanctions which would assure the orderly, appropriate, and focused conduct of this matter.\n[8]\nThe integrity of these proceedings can be maintained, unfortunately, only by the disqualification of Ms. Silver.\n[1] The Inmate Advocacy Unit was originally part of the New Jersey Office of the Public Advocate, and is now a\npart of the New Jersey Office of the Public Defender.\n[2] The defendants' objections to the Report and Recommendation were filed beyond the ten days permitted by\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 53. However, given the magnitude and sensitivity of the allegations at issue in the\ndefendants' motion, I permitted the parties to file their papers nunc pro tunc.\n[3] This court notes that although the Report and Recommendation was filed in May, 1996, a hearing was not\nheld until approximately one year thereafter to accommodate Ms. Silver's leave of absence from the Public\nDefender's Office.\n[4] By order of this court dated May 16, 1996, Ms. Silver's memorandum was sealed.\n[5] As an initial matter, it must be pointed out that Essex County, of which Corrections Officer DeMeo is an\nemployee, is not a party to this litigation. The Special Masters, after having recognized this fact, surmised that the\ncounty itself was not named in this action to avoid the Eleventh Amendment prohibition of suits against a state\nand to comply with the mandate of Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908). The\nSpecial Masters further noted, however, that as a practical matter, the parties have conducted this case as if the\ncounty was a real party in interest. They found that the defendants have looked to Essex County for the defense\nof this litigation; the county has used its own funds in defending this litigation and implementing the various\nrequirements provided under the consent orders. The Special Masters therefore considered the county to be a\nrepresented party. \nThe question of whether or not Essex County may be considered a \"party\" within the ambit of RPC 4.2 is not, as\nintimated by the Special Masters, entirely clear. There is case law which suggests that, at least in the criminal\ncontext, formal proceedings must first be initiated against a party for RPC 4.2 to be implicated. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Balter, 91 F.3d 427, 436 (3d Cir.) (citing State v. CIBA-GEIGY Corp., 247 N.J.Super. 314, 320, 589 A.2d\n180 (App.Div. 1991),appeal dismissed,130 N.J. 585, 617 A.2d 1213 (1992)), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 117\nS.Ct. 517, 136 L.Ed.2d 406 (1996). The Comment to RPC 4.2, however, states that the rule \"also covers any\nperson, whether or not a party to a formal proceeding, who is represented by counsel concerning the matter in\nquestion.\" Accordingly, whether Essex County can be considered a \"party\" under RPC 4.2 in this case is a close\nquestion. Because this court concludes, in agreement with the Special Masters' finding, that Corrections Officer\nDeMeo was not sufficiently identified with Essex County, even if the county could be considered a \"party,\"\nresolution of this particular issue is rendered unnecessary.\n[6] The Special Masters came to a similar conclusion with respect to RPC 8.4(c), which states in relevant part: \nIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ... engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or\nmisrepresentation.\n\nIt is apparent that the Special Masters relied specifically on the \"misrepresentation\" aspect of this rule. Notably,\nthe defendants originally did not argue that RPC 8.4(c) applied to this case.\nThis court is not at all certain whether RPC 8.4(c) can be equated with RPC 4.1(a)(1), as the Special Masters\nhave seemingly done. In Apple Corps Ltd. v. International Collectors Society, 1998 WL 345078 (D.N.J. June 26,\n1998), Judge Greenaway of this district noted that the \"literal application of the prohibition of RPC 8.4(c) to any\n`misrepresentation' by a lawyer, regardless of its materiality, is not a supportable construction of the rule.\" Id. at\n*20. Judge Greenaway reasoned that to apply RPC 8.4(c) to those situations involving false statements would in\nturn render RPC 4.1 entirely superfluous. Id. This court agrees with Judge Greenaway's reasoning in this regard.\nRPC 8.4(c) is generally limited to those cases involving fraud or deceit, or put another way, to\n\"`misrepresentations that manifest a degree of wrongdoing....'\" Id. at *21 (quoting David B. Isbell & Lucantonia N.\nSalvi, Ethical Responsibility of Lawyers for Deception by Undercover Investigators and Discrimination Testers; An\nAnalysis of the Provisions Prohibiting Misrepresentation Under the Model Rules of Professional Conduct, 8 Geo.\nJ. Legal Ethics 791, 817 (1995)). Accordingly, RPC 8.4(c) has been applied to cases involving, for instance,\nmisappropriation of client trust funds, see, e.g., In re Pomerantz, 1998 WL 396943 (N.J. July 17, 1998), or the\nfraudulent misappropriation of law firm funds for personal use, see, e.g., In re Greenberg, 1998 WL 396557 (N.J.\nJuly 17, 1998).\nThe Special Masters did not determine whether Ms. Silver's conduct rose to the level of fraud or deceit within the\nambit of RPC 8.4(c). Because of this court's determination that RPC 4.1(a)(1) was not violated by Ms. Silver, I do\nnot believe it necessary to determine whether RPC 8.4(c) was also violated.\n[7] I am also troubled by the plaintiffs' contention that Ms. Silver was not obligated to be fully candid with Mr.\nHellwig because she owed no duty to him. Relying on Petrillo v. Bachenberg, 139 N.J. 472, 655 A.2d 1354\n(1995), the plaintiffs maintain that an attorney violates RPC 4.1 only when he or she has a pre-existing duty to\nthat third party. The plaintiffs further contend that under Petrillo, not only must a pre-existing duty be shown, but\nalso that the defendants relied to their detriment on the allegedly misleading information. No such duty exists in\nthis case, the plaintiffs contend, as Ms. Silver \"owed no duty to Mr. Hellwig, rather she owed a duty to her (highly\nunpopular) clients to represent them vigorously.\" Plaintiffs' Opp. Brf, at 15. The plaintiffs misconceive the duty of\nhonesty required under RPC 4.1, and in so doing, misconstrue Petrillo.\nPetrillo specifically concerned the scope of an attorney's duty to a third party non-client for purposes of\ndetermining whether a malpractice action may lie. In finding that such a duty exists under specified\ncircumstances, the New Jersey Supreme Court stated:\nWhether an attorney owes a duty to a non-client third party depends on balancing the attorney's duty to represent\nclients vigorously, Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.3 (1993), with the duty not to provide misleading\ninformation on which third parties foreseeably will rely, Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 4.1 (1993).\nPetrillo, 139 N.J. at 479, 655 A.2d 1354. This statement, properly construed, stands for the general proposition\nthat in determining whether a duty to a third party exists at all, the duty not to provide misleading information is a\nrelevant consideration and must be measured against the attorney's duty to represent his clients vigorously. To\nconclude from this that a violation of RPC 4.1 requires a pre-existing duty tortures the holding and analysis of \nPetrillo. Nowhere in Petrillo does it state or even imply that a pre-existing duty is necessary before a violation of\nRPC 4.1 may be found. Contrary to the plaintiffs' contention that Petrillo \"addressed the scope of RPC 4.1,\" \nPlaintiffs' Opp. Brf. at 15-16, the case did no such thing.\nIn stating that Ms. Silver owed no duty to Mr. Hellwig, and thus, owed no duty to be fully candid with him, the\nplaintiffs ignore the plain fact that Ms. Silver's duty under RPC 4.1, in large measure, is not inextricably\nintertwined with her duty to her clients. Her duty to represent her clients zealously in no way diminishes her duty\nto refrain from making false statements or misleading third parties. RPC 4.1 stands alone, providing a clear,\nunambiguous rule concerning a lawyer's ethical duty to speak truthfully. It does not permit a lawyer to be less\nthan truthful simply because there may not be some sort of \"fiduciary duty\" running to a third party for purposes of\ndetermining whether a tort cause of action may lie. The \"duty\" is provided within the four corners of RPC 4.1\nitself, and reference need not be made to any other pre-existing duty.\n\n[8] The plaintiffs have alleged that the defendants' brought the present disqualification motion simply for strategic\npurposes to rid themselves of a zealous and effective advocate. Courts recognize that disqualification motions\ncan be utilized for strategic purposes. See Alexander, 822 F.Supp. at 1118-19; Kevlik, 724 F.2d at 848. When it\nappears that a motion to disqualify has been made primarily for strategic or tactical purposes, courts \"`have been\nextremely reluctant to disqualify attorneys.'\" Alexander, 822 F.Supp. at 1118 (quoting Nemours Found., v.\nGilbane, Aetna, Federal Ins. Co., 632 F.Supp. 418, 430-31 (D.Del. 1986)). Although this case has been hard\nfought throughout and at times contentious, no credible evidence was presented to this court to support a finding\nthat the defendants' primary purpose in moving for disqualification was for strategic or tactical purposes.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

This  is a  class action brought by inmates  of the Essex County \nJail system,  in facilities located in North Caldwell known  as the Jail Annex \n(hereinafter  \"Jail Annex\"  or ECJA).  The Jail Annex  is a  sprawling complex \n- - ----\n\nof  long-neglected,  decaying buildings,  most  of which house  inmates  in dark \ndungeon-like  units  that  are  over  a  century old.  Numerous  state and \ninspections  repeatedly  have  identified hazardous  conditions  and \nlc-~.l \ni:  ..  ,ute staffing levels,  whici'. conditions remain uncorrected and place \n~ \ninInc.t2  3,  \"ty ard health at serious risk.  While the =rent conditions  and \nprob.1..  in  this  complaint  have  been  caused by  years  of \n'- '~ed \nineffective  'S-\"1t  of applicable  state regulations  and the  reckless \nenI:~ \ninaction  of prior County Administrations,  immediate  remedial action to \ncorrect existing problems  is an absolute necessity. \n2.  The  present  crises,  spawned by  years of ineffective state . .. \nregulation and the County's  inexplicable  inaction,  are evident  in Annex-' \nfacilities  that  are dilapidated beyond repair,  grossly overpopulated,  and \nseverely understaffed.  As  a  result,  ECJA  inmates  are  forced to endure \nhorrifying,  inhumane and utterly intolerable conditions,  including:  toilets, \nsinks  and pipes that  are  rusted and  leaking sewage  and water;  walls  and \nfloors  that  are covered with  filth;  showers that are encrusted with green \nand black  slime;  rampant  infestation by  insects  and  rodents;  exposed \nelectrical wiring;  crumbling ceilings,  falling window panes,  and rusted and \nrotted roofing;  staffing levels  for nursing and medical  care that  have  led \nto  knowing  neglect  of  inmates  with identified serious medical needs  and a \nsystemic inability even to identify,  on  admission  or thereafter,  inmates \nsuffering  from  communicable diseases or other serious medical conditions; \nand other staffing shortages in security officers,  maintenance  workers  and \nsocial service  staff that  have caused ECJA inmates to be denied access  to \nimportant programs  or care essential to their health and well-being. \n3.  The  decaying  physical  plant  and the  inadequate supply of \nbunks  has  forced hundreds of inmates to sleep on  stretchers amid  litter and \n2 \n\npuddles of  water-.  There  is  also a  constant  atmosphere  of  tension,  fear and \nhostility that prevails,  interfering with  supervision  and protect ion  of \ninmates. \n, \n4.  As  a  result  of  the defendants  actions  or  inaction,  ECJA \nInmates  have  been  and  are  deprived of  minimally adequate  shelter,  living \nspace,  sanitary facilities,  necessities  for  personal  hygiene,  security, \nsafety,  exercise,  medical care,  visitation and other essential services. \n5.  The  totality of conditions  resulting  from  the deteriorated \nphysical  plant,  the deprivation of essential services,  and tl1e trerrendous \novercrowding at the ECJA inflicts needless privation,  suffering and hardship. ._  \non  inmates,  creates an environment which threatens the inmates' physical a.m:r-' \nrrental well-being,  and  results  in the  unnecessary  deterioration  of  the \nphysical  and mental  health of those  confined there.  The  conditions and \nother  practices or  policies  maintained at  the  ECJA  violate the plaintiff \nclass'  rights  to due  process  of law and to be  free  from  cruel and unusual \npunis0.rrent . \n6.  Plaint i ffs  seek  an  order directing defendants  to  close \nsections  of  the ECJA  immediately  and to prepare  a  plan  and  timetable  to \nreplace  the  Jail Annex  with  an  adequate  and  appropriate  facility _ \nPlaintiffs also seek an order imnediately reducing the  population  confir.ed \nin  the  ECJA  and  requiring the officials of  Essex County and the New  Jersey \nDepartment  of Corrections  to  provide  additional  appropriate  shelter  for \nthose  who  must  be  confined by  Essex  County.  Plaintiffs further seek an \norder requiring the  defendant  Commissioner  of Corrections  to establish \neffective  procedures  to  protect  plaintiffs'  rights  to  conditions  of \nconfinement that conform to the minimum  mandatory  standards  promulgated by \nthe Commissioner for  jail conditions,  programs  and practices in New  Jersey' s \n3 \n\nAdult County  Facilities.  This  relief  is  sought  to  redress \nC~rrectional \nplaintiffs' rights  under  the First,  Fifth,  Sixth,  Eighth,  Ninth and \nFourteenth  t o the Constitution of  the United States. \n~ts \n, \nJURISDICTION \n7.  This Court has  jurisdiction under 28  U.S.C.  Sections  1343  (3) \nand  1343  (4).  Plaintiffs' request  for declaratory relief is authorized by \n28  U.S.C.  Sections 2201  and 2202. \n8 .  This  suit is authorized by  42  U. S. C.  Section 1983  to redress \nthe deprivation  under  color  of  state  law  of  rights,  pri~ileges and \nimmunities  secured by  the  Fifth,  Sixth,  Eighth,  Ninth  and Fourteent~ \nAmendments. to the Constitution of  the United States. \n9.  This  Court  has  pendent  jurisdiction to determine the state \nclaims,  because the federal claims are sufficient to confer  subject matter \njurisdiction,  the  federal and state claims derive  from  a  corrrnon  nucleus  of \noperative fact,  and  ineffective,  incomplete relief will  result,  unless  all \nclaims  are determined in a  single  judicial proceeding. \n10.  This  i s  a  proceeding  for  a  preliminary  and  permanent \ninjunction enjoining defendants  from housing any  inmates  in certain sections \nof  the  Essex County  Jail Annex  and  enjoining defendants  from  any  and  all \nactions  which  result  in the  confinement  of plaintiffs and their class \ni~ \nsuch conditions  of  overcrowding  and  subject  to  such  practices  or \nrestrictions,  as  to deprive them of the rights secured by the Constitution \nand laws  of  the United States.  This  is also  a  proceedir.:,  :Oor  declaratory \njudgment  as  to  plaintiffs'  rights  to be  free  of  such  deprivations  by \ndefendants  acting  under  color of state law. \n11.  There  are  no  adequate  and  available  state administrative \nremedies  cognizable under  42  u.s.c.  Section 1997e. \n4 \n\nPLAINTIFFS \nEssex County Jail Annex  Inmates \n12.

Thomas Armour  is a  19 year old citizen of the United States, \nadmitted to the  Essex  County Jail Annex  on  APril  22,  1986,  on  charges \npending against him in municipal court. \n6 \n\n24.  -At  the  jail,  he was been assigned to a  dorm  on  S- Tier,  East \nfiling.  He  shares the dormitory with 29  other  inmates. \n25.  There are only two working toilets,  two  working  showers  and \nfou::::  sink  faucets  t o  be shared by all 30  inmates  in the dorm.  The walls  in \nthe  3hower  area are  filthy and  the paint  is peeling off.  The  floors  are \ndangerously slippery. \n26.  When he  was  first  admitted to t he  ECJA,  Thomas  Armour  was \nassigned to B-Tier,  West  Wing.  There,  he slept  for  20  days  on  an army-type \nstretcher on the  floor of the  dayroom area,  an  area he had to share  with up \nto  17  other  inmates.

He  has  tried  t o  get  access  to  a  law  library  since  his \nadmission  to ECJA,  but has  not been successful  and  consequently,  has  been \nunable  1:.0  do  any  research on his criminal case. \n29.  He  has been  a  mess hall worker  for about  two  months  and  found \nthat  the  whole  dining  area  emits a  foul  odor  and  os infested with water \nbugs,  which often walk across  the eating and preparation tables. \nFrederick  W.  Booker \n30.  Frederick W.  Booker  is a  27  year  old citizen  of the  United \nStates.  He  was  admitted to the ECJA  on  April  29,  1986 on criminal charges \n7 \n\npending in Superior Court.

There have been  16 other inmates  in the  cells of F- Tier and \n14  men  sleeping on  stretchers  in the dayroom  area.  He  has  seen  ants \ncrawling on  the  floor and walls  of  his  cell and water bugs  in the  toilet \nbowl.  The  sink in the  cell above overflows  from time to time,  causing water \nto leak through the ceiling into his  cell.  The  toilet  in his  cell  also \nfloods  over.  The  water  in the cell's sink flows  continually and is always \ncold. \n32.  He  must  share  the  one  working  shower  with the  16  other- -' \ninmates  in- cells,  as well as up to 14 men  sleeping on the stretchers  on  the \nfloor.  The  floor of  the shower area is covered with slime.  In August  1986, \nhe  fell while  leaving the shower  area and hit his head  and shoulder  on  the \nfloor. \n33.  When  he  was  first admitted to ECJA,  he  was  assigned to  sleep \non  a  stretcher  on  the  floor  of the dayroom area of F-Tier.  He  shared the \nfloor space  with up to 15  other inmates.  All 16 men  on  the  stretchers  had \nto  use  the  sink  and  t oilet in the  one  cell kept empty  for their use and, \ntogether with the 17  men  assigned to cells,  they all shared the one  working \nshower on the tier. \n34.  Frederick W.  Booker has tried to get access  to  law books  so \nthat  he  can  research issues in his criminal case,  but has not been  able  to \nobtain a  single  book,  He  has not been able to get access to a  typewriter to \ntype  legal  Motions  he  desires  to make.  He  has  been trying since he was \nadmitted in April  to see  a  social worker,  but has been unable to do  so. \n8 \n\n35.  -He  was  not  given  a  medical  examination at the  jail before \nbeing placed into general population and was  not administered a  blood test \nupon admission,  or at any time since. \nJames  Simon \n36.

He  was  held in lieu of a  cash bail of $2,500. \n37.  At the  jail,  he  was  assigned to a  cellon B-Tier of the West \nWing.  There were  17  inmates  sleeping on  stretchers on  the  ยฃloor of  the \ndayroom area of B-Tier.  Three cells on the tier were unoccupied because the. \nplumbing was  in such an extreme state of disrepqir. \n38.  On  or  about October 7,  1986,  a  radiator pipe broke  near the \nstretchers where men  slept and water  flowed out constantly.  The  inmates put \na  bucket on  the  floor to catch the water,  but at night  it flooded onto  the \nfloor. \n39.  Water  often leaked through  the  ceiling of  James  Simon's  cell \nfrom the cell above. \n40.  When  he  was  first admitted to ECJA,  he was  assigned to  sleep \non  one  of the  stretchers  on  B-Tier,  together with  as  many  as  23  other \ninmates.  He  slept on  a  stretcher on  the floor  for  about  3  1/ 2  weeks.  All \n24  men  sleeping on  stretchers  had to share the one  toilet and sink in the \ncell kept open for their use.  That toilet constantly overflowed  and water \nflooded onto the cell  floor.  The  24  men  on stretchers,  together with the  17 \n~~ assigned to cells,  all shared the  one working shower on B-Tier. \n41.  Sometime  in July 1986,  when  his wife  came  to visit him in the \nmess hall area used for contact visits,  she  fell on the floor which  was  wet \nand  slippery. \n9 \n\n42.  -For several  months  after he  was  first  confined,  he  tried \nunsuccessfully to see a  social worker. \n43.

On  or about  June  24,  1986,  while she was  sitting on  a  bench \nin the dayroam area,  a  window pane  fell out  of the large window  area and hit \nher on  the head,  neck and right  shoulder.  She  was  injured and  had  to be \nsent  to the  University Hospital  in Newark  for treatment.  She  has  suffered \nback and headaches  for months  since the  She  had previously  seen \naccida~t. \napproximately 20  window panes  fallout of  the window  into the occupied tier \n10 \n\narea,  onto or near cots where,  because of the overcrowded conditions,  women \nhave to sleep-'. \n5, 0.  The  plumbing in Ms.  Drake's cell is faulty;  the  faucets  leak \nand the  sink  frequently  backs  up  and  floods  the  floor  of the cell.  The \ntoilet flush-button  leaks when  it is pushed. \n51.  There were bugs  inside the toilet bowl. \n52.  She  had  to  share  three  showers  with  the  other  31  women \nconfined on  A-Tier.  The  entire  shower  area  is  filthy and the walls are \ncovered with mildew.  One  shower has  faulty drainage,  so that the water rose \nover  her  feet  when  she  showered.  When  she  used the  shower,  water \naccumulated on the slime and dirt-covered ceiling and dripped down  onto  her\" \nhead and body,  causing sores and rashes. \n53.  She  and the other female  inmates did not have  access to a  gym \nor outside recreation area.  She also did not have  access to a  law library. \n54.  She  was  not given a  medical examination upon her admission to \nECJA  and her placeme..'1t  in general population.  After approximately two  and a \nhalf weeks,  she was  given a  blood test. \nCandace  Johnson \n55.  Candace  Johnson  is  a  34  year  old citizen of  the  United \nStates,  confined  at  the  Essex County  Jail Annex  from  April  18,  1986  to \nSeptember  8,  1986 while serving a  county  jail sentence.  At  the  jail,  she \nwas  assigned to a  cell on\"F-Tier of the Women's  Building. \n56.  Every time she  flushed the toilet in her  cell,  'dater  leaked \nout  of the  toilet  bowl  onto  the floor.  She  has  had to stuff rags betwee.'l \nthe toilet rim and the metal wall  behind  it to  try to prevent  water  from \nflooding  the  floor.  Only  cold water came  out of her sink,  as well as  all \n11 \n\nthe others  in the Women's  facility,  and  in the mornings,  the  water  was \nusually rusty. \n57.  There are no  lights in the cell she occupied or in  any  other \ncell in the Women's  Building;  the light fixtures have never  functioned. \n58.  The  entire shower area is covered with mold  and mildew  and \nhad  a  foul  smell.  The  floor  drainage does  not  function properly,  causing \nwater to  up on the  floor. \nbac~ \n59.  There  are  large holes  around the shower  fixtures,  so  large \nthat when  repair crews worked in the crawl  space behind the  she was \nsho~rs, \nable to see them looking in through the holes at the naked women. \nRosalind Robinson \n60.  Rosalind Robinson  is  a  34  year  old citizen of the United \nStates,  who  was  serving  a  county  jail sentence  at  the Essex County  Jail \nAnnex  from  April  18,  1986  to  September  3,  1986.  At  the  jail,  she  was \nassigned to a  cellon D-Tier. \n61.  The  sink  in  her  cell leaked under  the  basin.  The  toilet \nleaked 'Nhenever  the flush button was  pushed. \n62.  There  are  large holes  around  the  fixtures  of the  three \nshowers  she  shared with  16  other women,  through which  all  sorts  of bugs \nenter.  There  is  no  way  to  control  the  shower  water  temperature,  which \nsometimes becomes  unbearably hot.  There  is  an  odor  of  sewage  coming  from \nthe  drainage area and black slime on the walls.  When  the shower  is used on \nthe  floor above,  water leaks down  from  the  ceiling onto  the  walls  of the \ndayroom  area of D-Tier near the T.V.  Ms.  Robinson often got wet  from  these \nleaks when  she watched TV. \n12 \n\n63.  - There  is  a  general  roach  infestation problem on the tier. \nTwice,  she received coffee from  jail staff with roaches  floating  around  in \nit.  She was  often bitten by  insects. \n64.  She was  not given a  rredical examination before being admitted \ninto  the  jail's general population.  When  she arrived at the  jail,  she had \nan  internal infection and irrmediately requested rredical attention.  She  was \nnot  taken to see  the  jail physician until  she was  in such pain that she \ncould barely  stand up.  Two  to three weeks  later,  she  was  taken  to  the \nhospital,  where  they  found a  cystic mass,  that has to be  remo~.  As  many \nof the other women  inmates,  she  had  frequent  rashes  on  her  face  and body_ \ncaused by the generally unsanitary  living conditions at the  jail. \nDEFENDANTS \n65.  Nicholas Amato  is the Executive of Essex County and is vested \nby  statute with the ultimate  responsibility for the operations of the  Essex \nCounty  Jail Annex  and  overall  planning  for  the  care  and  custody of the \nirnates housed therein.  He  is  required to  receive  and  keep  all persons \napprehended by law enforcement officers. \n66.  Thomas  Thompson  is the Acting Administrator of the  Essex \nCounty  Jail Annex  in North Caldwell,  New  Jersey.  He  is directly in c.;'arge \nof  jail operations and is responsible  for the development  and implementation \nof  jail policy and procedure. \n67.

The  Board  of \n13 \n\nChosen  Freeholders  is  responsible  for  the  funding  of personnel  and \nfacilities  for the proper operation of the Essex County  Jail Annex. \n~ \n68 โข.  Emily  Weber  is the Acting Director of the Department  of \n, \nPublic Safety  for Essex County.  She  is responsible for  the  supervision  of \njail operations. \n69.  William H.  Fauver  is the Commissioner  of the  New  Jersey \nDepartment  of  Corrections.  He  has,  pursuant  to N.J.S.A.  30:1-15,  t he \nauthority to inspect conditions in county  jails and,  pursuant  to N.J .S.A. \n30:8-57,  the  authority to enforce compliance by  a  county  jail with minimum \nstandards  and  constitutional  requirements,  and under  various  Executive -\nOrders  ofยท the Governor  (attached),  the authority to transfer inmates  from \nlocal and county  jail facilities to either state facilities or other county \nor private facilities. \nCLASS  ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n70.  Plaintiffs bring this action as  a  class action maintainable \nunder  Rule  23(a}  and  23(b} (1)  and  (2)  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civi l \nProcedure  on  their own  behalf and  on  behalf of all persons  similarly \nsituated,  that is,  all inmates who  now  are,  or who  in the  future will  be, \nconfined in the  Essex County Jail Annex  as detainees or  as persons  sentenced \nto that  facility.  The  class represented by plaintiffs herein is so numerous \nthat  joinder of all members  is impractical;  there are questions  of law and \nfact  common  to the class;  claims of the representatives  herein are  typical \nof  the  claims  of the  class,  and representative parties herein will  fairly \nand  adequately protect  the  interests of the  class.  The  defendants  have \nacted or  refused to  act  on  grounds  generally applicable  to  the  class, \nthereby making  appropriate  final  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief with \nrespect to the class as a  whole.  The  total members  of  the class number over \n14 \n\n1000  persons at anyone time,  and the  class members  are subject to change  as \npersons are camtitted to and discharged from the  jail. \n71.  A class accion determination  will  avoid the  possibility of \n, \ninconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members  of \nthe class establishing incorrpatible standards of conduct  for the defendants. \nSince  a  majority of the  members  of the  class  are  indigents,  suits by \nindividual members  would most  likely be  brought  pro  se,  with  all  the \nattendant difficulties of such litigation. \n72.  Plaintiffs'  attorneys  are  associated with  the Office  of \nInmate  Advocacy  of the New  Jersey Office of the Public Defender.  They  are \nfamiliar  with the  conduct  of  litigation of this  kind  and  will  affora-\nadequate  representation.  By  statutory authority,  N.J.S.A.  52:27E-11  et \nthe Office is authorized to represent the interests of such persons  as \n~, \na  class. \n15 \n\nFACTUAL  ALLEGATIONS \nBUILDING AND' DESIG'I \n73.  The  present Essex  County  Jail Annex  is  located  in North \n, \nCaldwell,  New  Jersey.  It is comprised of a  number  of service buildings \na~d \nfour central housing buildings.  The  main housing buildings  include:  the \nMen's Building,  the Women's  Building,  the  \"New\"  Wing,  the M::ldules  (also \nreferred to as the R.C.F.  or  relocatable correctional  facility)  and  t he \nState Trailers.  other buildings,  such as the Shoe Shop,  also have  recently \nbeen converted into housing units. \n74.  The  ECJA  is  used  as  a  detention  facility  by  22\" \nmunicipalities in Essex County.  It is also used to house  inmates  sentenced \nto terms  of imprisonrrent  in t.l>e  county  jail,  and also some  women  inmates who \nare sentenced to  state prison. \n75.  The  ECJA  is presently operating under the  jurisdiction of the \nEssex County Executive. \n76.  The  Men's  Building,  including  its West  and East  housing \nwings,  was  constructed in 1875. \n77.  The  \"New\"  Wing  was  constructed in 1923 and was  closed in 1982 \nbecause of its dangerous  and dilapidated condition.  It has,  however,  been \nreopened  recently  and  now  houses  inmates  in areas  not  intended nor \nappropriate for housing,  including the vestibule areas. \n78.  l-bst of the ECJA's  permanent buildings are antiquated,  multi-\nstory  masonry buildings .  The  physical  plant  in  general,  is  old  and \ndeteriorated,  with  crur::...  :ing  ceilings,  slime-covered walls,  open  sewage \nareas,  faulty plumbing,  leaks  in  the  roof  and exposed electrical wiring. \nThe  pipes are insulated with asbestos \n16 \n\n79.  -The  dilapidated condition  of  the  physical  plant poses  a \nsevere danger to the men  and women  inmates housed there.  For example,  the \nventilation system,  is  largely dysfunctional,  which  creates  substantial \nhealth risks and serious discomfort among  inmates  confined there during the \nhigh tenperatures and humidity  levels of sumner. \n80.  The  ECJA  also  suffers  from  its poor  design, \narc~tectural \nwhich  failed to provide adequate  areas  for  recreation,  library,  or  program \nspace.  This problem is greatest in the women's  facility,  which provides  for \nalmost no  recreation or library use. \nHOUSING  AND  LIVING  SPlI.cE \n81.  The  ECJA had,  until 1983,  regularly housed between 4S0  to SSe--ยท \ninmates,  most  of whom  were  sentenced to  county  jail terms.  Since  1983 \ndespite the closing of  approximately 200  beds  in the ECJA's  New  Wing,  the \njail began  housing  as roany  as  700  inmates,  approximately half of whom  were \ndetainees awaiting disposition of  criminal \nc~ges. \n82.  In September  1986,  an additional  7S  inmates were moved to the \nA.rmex. \n83.  Since  Noverober  1986,  as  many  as  1000  or more  inmates  have \nbeen housed at the ECJA,  the additional inmates being assigned to areas  such \nas  the  vestibules  of the  once  closed \"New\"  Wing,  the basement  area of the \nWomen's  Building,  formerly used for contact visitation with inmate children, \nand the old Shoe  Shop.  Over 100  more  inmates were moved to the Annex  at the \nend  of 1986.  The  jail's space and beds are totally inadequate to accornodate \nthis number  of  inmates. \n84 .  Areas  designed and  origina:ly  intended  as  housing  for \ninmates,  but  which  include  units that  are no  longer safe or  suitable  for \nsuch purposes,  include the  following,  with the specific  areas  described  in \n17 \n\nsubsequent  paragraphs:  144  male general population cells in the West  Wing \nof the  main  facility;  180  beds  in the dormitories  of  the East Wing;  120 beds \nfor  male  inmates  in the  R.C.F.  M::x:!ules  opened in late 1982  and  96  beds  in \nR.C.F.  t10dules  opened  in  late  1986;  48  beds  for  male  inmates  i n  t he \ndormitory-style trailers;  and 102  cells in the Women's  Building.  While this \nconfiguration provides  a  theoretical  690  beds,  the ECJA's actual capacity  is \nfar  less because  many  cells  and beds  cannot  be  used without endangering \ninmates'  health,  safety and security. \n85.  ECJA  inmates  were  ordinar ily housed  in botn cells  and \ndormitory units.  As  a  result of overcrowding,  however,  a  majority of the. \ninmates  are now  crowded into dormitories and corridor areas,  having to sleep--ยท \non  single or double bunks,  with little space between them,  or  on  army-type \nstretchers  placed directly on  the  floor,  almost  touching each  other. \nMattresses are neither cleaned nor sanitized between users. \nt1EN'S BUIIDING:  WEST  WING \n86.  The  Men's  Building is entered through a  large rotunda,  which \nserves  as  access  to  the West  Wing,  the  East  Wing,  a  Hospital  Wing,  the \nAdministrative Offices,  the M:ss  Hall  and now,  the once closed \"New\"  Wing. \n87.  The  West  Wing  is used  to  house  unsentenced  inmates.  It \nconsists of  four  levels with two  tiers on  each level;  each tier contains  18 \ncells,  for  a  total of  144  cells.  In addition,  there are approximately  70 \narmy-type stretchers  layed  out  in  close proximity to  one  another  in  che \noutside  corridors  of four  of the tiers.  Housing  inmates  on  stretchers  in \nthis mAnner  is a  constant practice. \n88.  Housing  inmates  in  the  corridor  areas  affect~ ~he living \nconditions  of all West  Wing  inmates.  Those  who  sleep on  stretchers  on  the \nfloor  have  very  little sleeping or living space.  The  stretcher mattresses \n18 \n\nthey sleep on are badly cracked;  some  are  ripped and torn.  Inmates  sleeping \non  stretchers have  no  locker of any  kind  in which  to put their personal \npossessions  and must hang their possessions  on  the walls  and bars  of the \n, \nother inmates'  cells. \n89.  During the daytime hours when  the corridor space  is shared by \nthe  inmates  on  stretchers  as  well as the inmates  from the cells,  there is \neven less  space per  \"corridor\"  inmate.  When  inmates  are  housed  in  the \ncorridor,  those  inmates  confined to the cellblocks are also affected,  since \nthe  space  to which  they  have  access  for  6  to  8  hours  a  day. is greatly \nreduced.  The  clutter of bodies  sleeping  in  corridors adversely affects ยท \nthose  inmates  fortunate  enough  to be  assigned.a cell bunk,  as  it limitS-\ntheir  opportunity  for  daytime  space,  exacerbates  tensions,  creates \nresentments  and fighting over the barest of necessities  and poses  a  health \nhazard to everyone confined there. \n90.  The  floor in the corridors of West  Wing  is black with dirt, \nas  are  the walk-ways  in front  of the cells and the floor inside many  of the \ncells.  The  entire Wing  is infested with roaches,  ants,  flies and fleas. \n91.  A great many  of the  standard size mattresses  in the cells \nare badly cracked,  ripped or torn,  or have  open  seams.  Even  more  badly \ndamaged  mattresses,  to be used when  there is a  greater population increase, \nare stored on the  floor under the stairs in the West  Wing. \n92.  The  shower  area walls  are badly rusted and are covered with \nblack and greenish slime.  Water drips  from  the ceiling  above  the  showers. \nBlack  slime  covers  the  floors.  The  floors  are  dangerously  slippery, \nfrequently causing inmates to fall and sometimes  suffer serious  injury.  The \nentire area is poorly lighted.  As  many  as  48  inmates  on  a  sinsle tier must \nshare a  single working shower. \n19 \n\n93.  ยทAll  the  washroom  areas,  particularly the  slop sinks,  are \nfilthy.  Sane sinks do not work  at all.  In sorre  areas,  the walls are  rusted \nand  cracked.  Water  has  run  down  some  walls  for  so  long that they have \nrusted and one  can see light through the cracks. \n94.  The  cell toilets in the West  Wi.rtg  are rusted and dirty.  Some \ncells also have  faulty plumbing,  causing toilet water  and  sewage  to  leak \nthrough  the ceiling into the  cells below.  Other toilet fixtures  splash out \nwater when  flushed.  There  is no  running  water  for  the  lavatory  in  some \ncells  and  the  water  cannot be shut off in others.  Water  leaks. through the \nceiling in various places  from the tier above.  The  approximately 14  inmates-\non  cots  in_each of  the corridors must  share one toilet and one  lavatory in g---\ncell left unoccupied for  their use. \n95.  There  are  no  indoor  or outdoor  recreation  facilities  or \ndayrooms  for the West  Wing. \n96.  In  the pipe chase area of the  West  Wing,  which separates the \ntwo  cellblock areas on  each floor  and allows  for  repairs  to be  made  to  the \nplumbing without  entering the cells,  there are expcsed live wires to outlet \nboxes  hanging loosely amid  leaking pipes. \n97.  There are no backflow preventers  for either the building as  a \nwhole,  or  for  any  of  the  four  levels of  the pipe chase. \n98.  Toilets and  lavat ories share a  common  water line,  so when  the \ntoilets are flushed,  the amount  of  water  for  the  lavatories  is  reduced. \n99.  Holes  have  been  drilled on both sides of  the  traps  for the \ndrain lines  in the pipe chase,  and those holes between the trap and the vent \npipe could allow sewer gas to escape into the pipe chase. \n100.  Because of major  leaks  in the valves  for the hot water pipes \nfor  the  5hower5  in  two  lยงvยงls  of thยง  pipe  chase,  hot  water runs  down  the \n20 \n\npipe chase  inte the drain,  and steam escapes  into  the chase.  The  water \nsupply lines for a  number of lavatories and toilets leak so badly that water \nsprays out  and eventually nh~S down  the  floor into the drain. \n101.  A  number  of  long-term,  unrepaired leaks  in the showers  have \nresulted in the  formation of stalactites,  some  over  one  foot  long,  on  the \nceilings of the pipe chase. \n102.  The conditions of the physical plant in the West  Wing,  along \nwith  the  inadequate  staffing  for  maintenance,  security  and  program \nactivities,  create such hazards to inmate health,  safety  and  security that \nthe West  Wing must be  closed. \nEAST  WING \n103.  The East Wing consists of three identical levels of two tiers \neach.  Each tier contains one  14-man dorm and one  16-man  dorm,  for  a  total \nof 180  beds.  Low partitions divide the dorms  into two-man booths. \n104.  There  is no  recreational  area,  dayrooms  or  even  corridor \nspace,  for the dorms  in the East Wing. \n105.  On  some  tiers,  there  are  only  two  working  toilets;  other \ntiers  have  only one or two  functioning showers,  which must be shared by all \n30  inmates  confined there. \n106.  The  walls  in  the  shower  area are  all  filthy  and  slirr,e \ncovered.  Paint is peeling off the walls.  Some  walls  are  so  rusted  that \nthey have almost  cracked in two. \n107.  The  shower  room  floors  are covered with brown  and black slime \nand are slippery and dangerous. \n108.  On  one  tier,  there are two  old restroom  areas  which  are  not \nin use  and  have  been boarded up.  They  are  in a  state of extreme disrepair \nand are  full  of old garbage.  All  that  separates  the garbage-strewn  area \n21 \n\nfrom  the  dormitDry  beds  in  some  places  are broken window panes,  boarded up \nwith sheets of cardboard. \n109.  Almost all of  the toilets in the bathroom areas  leak.  There \nis a  gray  slime on  the  floor under  the t oilets. \n110.  The  insides  of many  of the toilets have been coated with a \nvery rough cement,  presumably  to  cover the  cracks,  which  makes  t he  bowls \ndifficult to clean. \n111.  Roaches  and water bugs  infest the living areas and all other \nareas  of  the East Wing. \n112.  The  doors  to the  pipe  chase  area  for  some  t iers have  been . .'  \n_closed  for  so  long that  their locks  have  completely painted over-,- \nbe~n \nindicating that necessary maintenance has been entirely neglected. \n113.  The  conditions of the physical plant in the East Wing,  along \nwith  the  inadequate  staffing  for  maintenance,  security  and  program \nactivities,  create  such hazards to inmate health,  safety and security  that \nthe  East Wing  must  be closed. \nTHE  Scrc:ALLED  \"NEW\"  WING \n114.  The  inappropriately  named  \"New Wing\"  was  closed  in  1982  for \nhealth and structural hazards. \n115.  It was  reopened in Novewber  1986,  without being repaired. \n116.  A total  of  68  inmates  are now  housed on double bunks  in the \nvestibule area of each of the  first three  floors.  The  fourth floor  has  not \nyet been used because of  serious  leakage  from  the outside  roof. \n117.  Each of the three vestibule areas,  where  between  18  and  30 \ninmates  are now  housed,  is equipped with only one  toilet and two  sinks. \n118.  All  of  the inmates in the New  Wing  must use  the three  pre \nfabricated  shower  units which  have  been  installed  in  the  first floor \n22 \n\nvestibule  area. '  These  showers  are  not  connected up  to the  building's \ncentral plumbing. \n119.  There  are  leaks  of  such  long-standing on  the  heating and \nplumbing pipes that major stalactites have  formed. \n120.  The  conditions of the physical plant in the  \"New\"  Wing,  along \nwith  the  inadequate  staffing  for  maintenance,  security and  program \nactivities,  create such hazards  to inmate health,  safety and security  that \nthe  \"New\"  Wing  vestibules areas must  be closed. \nMEN'S  FOOD  SERVING AREA \n121.  There  are  holes  and broken tiles on  the  floor of the men's, \nfood serving area.  The  pipes,  insulation and floor of the  food preparation-' \narea are  all  filthy.  There are exposed hot steam pipes.  The  kitchen sink \nleaks and pans  have  to  be  placed beneath  it to  catch the  leaking dirty \nwater. \n122.  Both steam tables in the  food  serving area of the dining room \nhave  old rags  for  drain plugs.  One  has  been  there  for  so  long  that  a \nstalagmite is growing below  it,  formed  by  the drips  falling  off the  rag. \nThe  insulation on  the pipe that  leads to the steam kettle in the dining room \nis filthy and has begun to deteriorate.  Old rags have  been wrapped  around \npart of the pipe. \n123.  There  is roach and rat infestation in the serving area of  the \ndining room and the kitchen area. \n124.  The  scrape-table  drain  leaks,  causing  dirty  water  to \naccumulate on  the  floor,  which iIl turn erodes the concrete.  The  floor drain \nhas backed-up near the serving area,  giving off a  sewage  odor.  In  the  food \nserving area,  a  floor drain has  broken the floor tile around the \nbacked-u~ \n23 \n\ndrain to the point that the drain is higher than the exposed concrete.  The \nwhole  floor area is dirty and has  an odor of  sewage. \n125.  There is a  heavy  layer of a  black,  sticky  substance  on  the \n, \nfloor  of  the  food  storeroom.  A thinner layer of  the black substance coats \nthe wooden  pallets.  In  the  canned goods  storage  area,  there  is  a  thick \nwhite  scum  on  the  floor  under  and behind the  pallets.  Water  seeps  in \nthrough the wall  in the canned goods  area.  The  cooler system is  frosted up \nand  is  not  cooling properly.  There  is  slime  on  the ice machines  in the \nkitchen.  The  walk-in cooler has  an  accumulation of mold on the \n~lls. \n126.  The  floor and slop sink in the food service garbage room  are .._  \ncovered with  dirt.  The  ceiling is slimy,  sticky and  damp  and,  in \nsom~' \nspots,  is  covered with  spots  of mold.  Opposite the slop sink,  the mortar \nhas broken loose between the tile,  and an inch of stinking dirty water  lays \nin  the  cracks.  There are open  sewer lines by the slop  sink in the garbage \nroom and also by the sink in the  food preparation areas. \n127 .  The  inmate  food  service workers'  restroom has open  sewer \npipes,  where  a  toilet has been removed. \n~1EDICAL ulUT \n128.  The  medical unit  consists  of  three wards,  A,  Band C,  and \nthree isolation cells.  These wards house  seriously ill  inmates. \n129.  During the  Slli~er months,  the  temperature  in  Ward  C  is \nusually  above  80' F  and  the  humidity  is often as high as  85'.  There are a \nnumber  of beds with broken  springs;  some  bunks have even  been  supported  by \nold milk  crates.  The  walls are  ficthy and the  floor  is covered with grit. \nAt  least one window  is broken and does  not have  a  screen. \n130.  A t oilet  fixture has been removed  from the  restroom  area of \nC,  leaving a  large  open  hole  in  one  wall  leading  to  an  open  se'ยท'er. \n~Jard \n24 \n\n-\nAlthough  the hole  is stuffed with paper,  sewer gas escapes through it.  The \nfloor of  thg toilet area  is dirty and the lavatory drain liI1e  leaks.  There \nis  a  major,  long-standiI1g leak in the toilet facility.  One  of the pipes  in \n, \nthe  pipe chase serving Ward  C is  uncapped.  The  water  supply pipe  for  the \ntoilet in Ward C,  Isolation Cell 3  has a  major leak. \n131.  The  conditions  of  the physical  plant  in Ward  C,  along  with \nthe  inadequate  staffing  for  maintenance,  security and program activities, \ncreate such hazards  to  inmate health,  safety and security  t hat Ward C must \nbe closed. \nWOMEN'S  BUIIDING \n.132.  The  Women's  Building  of the  ECJA  consists of three leve]:;j' \nwith two  tiers of 17  cells in each tier,  for  a  total of 102  one-woman  cells, \ntwo  of which  are  not  functional;  it has  its own  diI1ing  facility.  The  top \nand bottom tiers have  outside  corridors,  in  addition to  the  walk-ways  in \nfront of the cells. \n133.  The  corridors were originally intended to be used as  daytime \nact ivity  space,  but  are  now used to  house additional  inmates  sleeping on \nยท=ots  or  double-bunks. \n134.  Since October 1986,  24 men  inmates have been confined in the \nbasement  area,  formerly used for  contact visits with children  of  the  women \ninmates. \n135.  Housing  inmates  in the corridor area of the vlemen's  Building \nis  an unrelenting practice  at  ECJA.  It impacts not only upon  the particular \nwomen  who  must  endure  such conditions  of confinement,  but  inevitably affects \nall  t he  inmates.  The  clut ter  of  bodies  sleeping  in  corridors adversely \naffects those  inmates  fortunate  enough  to be  assigned a  cell bunk,  as  it \nlimits their opportunit y  for  space,  exacerbates  tensions,  creates \ndaytL~ \n25 \n\nresentments and fighting over the barest of necessities and posess  a  health \nhazard to everyone confined there. \n136.  The  roof of the ;:omen's  Building has  leaked for so  long  that \n, \nthere  are  wet,  rusty  spots  on  the attic side of the steel ceiling for the \ncells below. \n137.  There  is a  general insect  infestation problem throughout the \nWomen's  Building.  There  are  bugs  in the  cells and women  are  frequently \nbitten.  Inmates  have  found  insects  in their food and coffee. \n138.  There are no  lights at all in the  individual  c&lls.  There \nare  light  fixtures,  but  they have  never  functioned,  since the electrical-\nwork was  never completed. \n139.  There  are  no  lockers  for  clothing or other  combustible \nmaterial and the women,  therefore,  must hang clothing on the walls  and bars \nof  their  cells,  which  poses  a  health  and  security problem.  Other \npossessions are stored under the beds. \n140.  The  floors  of the  cells  and dayroom  areas  are  filthy and \nsticky. \n141.  The  toilet bowls  and  toilet  flush-buttons  in  many  of \nt~e \ncells leak;  some  leak so badly that rags have to be  stuffed into openings  to \nkeep  the  water  from  flooding onto the floor.  When  some  of the toilets are \nflushed,  water sprays  onto the toilet seat.  The  water closet walls  in \nmos~ \nof the cells are rusted;  some  have holes  and cracks. \n142.  None  of the lavatories  in the Women's  Building are  equipped \nwith hot water.  The  water that comes  out  is often dirty,  especially in the \nmorning.  The  sinks  are  often backed  up  and water  floods  onto  the  cell \nfloor. \n26 \n\nl43.ยทA vast  number of the  beds  have  torn  or  badly  cracked \nmattresses.  A few  inmates  are  forced to sleep on the  floor because the bed \nin their cell is broken. \n144.  Women  on  cots  and  recently  also  on  double-bunks  in the \ncorridors have to share a  single toilet and lavatory in one  cell kept  empty \nfor  such use.  At  times,  up to 21  women  share the lavatory  facilities  in the \none  or  tWO  errpty cells.  Even that  lavatory is often stopped up  and  drains \nslowly,  if at all. \n145.  The  shower areas throughout the Women's  Building ?re  full  of \nfilth and  slime.  There  are  leaks  of such  long-standing that they have, \nformed major stalactites.  The  concrete walls  and ceilings are deterioratingr-' \nand  are  covered with mildew  and  slime.  When  the  shower  is used,  water \naccumulates  on  the slime-covered ceiling and then drips down onto  the  heads \nof  the women  using it causing sores and rashes to develop.  There is no way \nto control the  shower water temperature,  which sometimes becomes  unbearably \nhot.  Some  of the showers  have such poor drainage,  that the water rises over \nthe  feet of  the person taking the  shower.  There  is  a  sewage  odor  coming \nfrom the drainage  areas. \n146.  There  are  large holes  around  all of the  shower  fixtures. \nWhen  t he  plumbing  needs  repair,  men  working  in the crawl  space behind the \nshower walls can be seen  looking  in  through  the  holes  at  women  taking  a \nshower. \n147.  When  the  showers  are  used  on  one  floor,  water  leaks  down \nthrough  the  ceiling to  the  floor  below,  onto the inmates  confined there. \n148.  There  are  three  showers  on  each  floor,  although  only  two \nfunction  on A and B Tiers,  to be  used by up  to 38  women  per  floor. \n27 \n\n149. -S<'lrre  electric  junction boxes  in the shower areas are wet  and \nrusted,  as  are sorre  electrical conduits_ \n150.  There is an open  lavatory  drain  leaking  in the pipe  chase \narea of  the Women's Building.  Between  60%  and 75%  of the vacuum breakers  in \nthe pipe chase  for the toilets of the Women's  facility are missing. \n151.  The  toilets and lavatories  share a  common  water line,  so when \nthe  t oilets are  flushed,  the  flow of  water to the lavatories is reduced. \n152.  The  Women's  Building does not have back flow preventers  for \nthe  building itself or for each of  the levels of the pipe chaser  creating a \nhazardous  situation. \nยท153.  There  are  a  number of holes  in the  lavatory drain,  whiCh ' \nallow  sewer gas to escape  into the pipe chase.  Some  of the vent pipes have \nbeen rusted through,  leaving gaps  of as much  as  1  1/2  inches,  through which \nsewer  gas  can  escape  into  the pipe chase.  Several of the plugs on  top of \nthe tees  for the toilet drain  line vents  in the  pipe  chase  are missing, \npermitting sewer  gas  to escape.  There  is sewage-like fermenting water on \nthe  floor  of  the pipe chase at the Tier A and B level. \n154.  In Tier D of  the Women's  Building,  stalagmites  are growing up \nfrom the top of  the cover of  the  cell  opening  mechanisms  located in  the \ncorridor.  The  stalagmites  are  caused by  leaking plurobing  above  the \ncorridor,  which cannot  be controlled,  due  to the building's  structure. \n155.  There  are many  broken windows  and missing screens  in Tier D \nof  the Women's Buildirlg.  The  window panes  in the  huge  windows  of  A and  B \nTiers are  old and loose.  They  have  fallen out  and have hit  women  sitting or \nlying  on  their cots  below.  At  least one  inmate  has  suffered serious  injury. \n156.  There  is no  mechanical venti lation  at  al l  in the Women 's \nBuilding. \n28 \n\n157. ยทPersistent levels of overcrowding seriously limit the ability \nof the women  inmates to utilize corridors  for  daytime  functions.  At  the \nsame  time,,   there  is neither an  inside gym  nor outside recreation area for \nwornen  inmates. \n158.  There  is no  library;  some  law books  fill shelves  in a  room \nused for  inmate  interviews with lawyers and social workers,  but they  cannot \nbe  used effectively because  they  are  in no  particular order and are not \nindexed or otherwise organized.  Numerous  volumes  essential for basic  legal \nresearch are not  available. \n159.  Since October 1986,  24  male  inmates have been confined in the- --\nbasement area  of the Women's  Building.  Twelve  double  bunks  have  been-\ncrowded into this area.  The  men  all share  two  toilets  and two  showers. \nThere  are  three sinks,  one of which runs  constantly.  Stalagmites grow  from \nthe water pipes. \n160.  The  conditions of the physical plant in the Women's  Building, \nalong with the inadequate staffing  for maintenance,  security and  program \nactivities,  create  such hazards to inmate health,  safety and security that \nthe Women's  Building must  be closed. \nR.C.F.  M)DULES \n161.  The  Modules  consist  of a  central corridor  area,  a  dining \nfacility  and five living units.  Tiers A,  B,  C,  D and E are accessible  from \nthe  central area through locked doors.  Tiers A and E each house  24  inmates \nand each consist of four dorms  and a  central dayroom.  Tiers B,  C and D eac.'l. \nhouse 24  inmates  and each have  12  cells. \n162.  The  number  of inmates  held in each unit has been increased \nbeyond design capacity by adding double bunks. \n29 \n\n163.- The  housing  of  inmates  in these  units beyond their design \ncapacity has led to the rapid deterioration of  the modules  and to conditions \nthat  jeopardize inmates'  health and safety. \n164.  Many  of the mattresses  used by  inmates  in  the  R.C.F.  are \nbadly  cracked and have  staph check  type  covering.  Others  are  made  of \nuncovered and deteriorating foam  pads. \n165.  The  showers  in the  Modules  are  filthy.  There is a  white, \nsoap-like  film on the  inside  of the doors  and  on  the  shower-room walls. \nThere  is mold on  the walls and black moldy  spots on the ceiling, \n166.  All 24  inmates on each tier must  share a  single shower. \n167.  There  is only one  outside recreation yard for all 5 \nmodu1es~ยท \nDue  to its size and the limited staffing for  inmate  programs,  inmates  may \nuse  the  yard  only  infrequently.  It also  cannot  be  used  in cold or \ninclement  weather,  because  the  inmates  are  not  allowed to have  outdoor \nclothing. \n168.  The  Modules  are infested with roaches.  On  some  days,  up  to \n2/3 of  the toilets are backed up. \n169.  In mid-November  1986,  a  new  Module  was  completed and  an \nadditional  96  inmates  are similarly confined there  in overcrowded conditions \nto those described in paragraphs  160  to 167. \nsL~lar \nSTATE  TRAILERS \n170.  Inmates  are also  confined  in  six dormitory-style  trailers \nt hat  house  up  to  10  inmates  each.  One  end of each trailer opens  ont o  a \nshared central area.  Unlike  the Modules,  there  is no  locked  door  between \nthe  central area and the t railers. \n171.  There  i s  no  indoor  or outdoor  recreation  area  for  t he \n30 \n\nOTHER  HOUSINGยท AREAS \n172.  The  old Shoe  Shop  has,  due  to  the  huge  increase  in inmate \npopulation,  recently been  converted  into  a  make-shift  dormitory  and  now \n, \nhouses  28  work  release inmates.  They  all share a  single shower,  two  working \ntoilets and four  sinks.  Inmates  had been hOUSed  in the old Paint Shop,  but, \npursuant to an agreement with North caldwell,  they have been removed. \nEMERGENCY  PRCCEDURES \n173.  There  are  no  uniform plans  for emergency procedures  for the \ndifferent buildings,  or even  for  the different  tiers  in  the  same  wing  or \nbuilding.  Emergency  procedures  are  at  the discretion of the individual-\nofficers-in-charge. \n174.  Only  permanent  staff is trained  in  emergency  procedures. \nAlthough the Jail Annex's  funding problem has hindered hiring of permanent \nemployees  and  a  large majority  of  the  new  employees  are  classified as \n\"terrporary\"  terrporary or  probationary,  probationary employees  are  not  given \nthe  correctional  officers training course,  which  includes emergency \nmanagement. \n175.  There  is  only one exit  for each of the tiers in the Women's \nBuilding,  as  well  as  each of the  tiers  in the  West  Wing  of  the  Men's \nBuilding.  All  of these  tiers only  open  onto  a  central stairway,  making \nemergency evacuation difficult and dangerous.  There  is  also  only  one  exit: \nfor  the  hospital wing.  In  the  East  Wing  of t he  Men's  Building  is  an \nalternate exit on  the third floor,  which  leads to the auditorium.  However, \nthis  is  not  an  effective  second exit because  the door  leading  to  the \nauditorium is adjacent  to the central stairway.  M:Jreover,  the  corrections \nofficers  on  duty do not have keys  to this door,  so in case of an emergency, \n31 \n\nan officer from  another area would  have  to  be  summoned  to bring a  key  to \nunlock the door from the auditorium side. \n176.  There is no  central  fire  or  smoke  detection  system  in  the \nmain  facility.  There is no  fire alarm pull station located in or near the \nmain kitchen area. \nHEALTH  CARE \n177.  When  an  inmate is  admitted  for  incarceration at  the  ECJA, \nhe  or  she  is often immediately placed in general population without medical \nexamination  being performed and,  most  recently,  without  evan  a  medical \nhistory being taken.  Weeks  often pass  before a  nurse has time to take aยท \nmedical history.  There is no medical  screening .dcne  on  female  inmates  who' \nare  admitted to  the  ECJA  and  a  medical  history is taken only if a  female \ninmate reports a  medical problem. \n178.  Pregnancy tests are not given to female  inmates. \n179.  Blood tests for communicable diseases,  contagious  conditions \nor other serious health problems are not  regularly performed upon admission, \nbut,  if performed at all,  are often delayed for days,  if not weeks,  after an \ninmate's admission.  At  least one  inmate with active tuberculosis was  placed \nin general population,  where  he  remained for  months  before he  was  sent  to \nthe University Hospital  for treatment. \n180.  There  is no  intake/holding area. \n181.  Due  to  overcrowding  at  the ECJA,  medical department  is \nL~e \nboth overutilized and  often unable  to perform according  t o  its ordinary \nprocedures:  the  medical  screening of inmates,  has when  done  at all,  been \nlimited to  a  perflli~ctory and  inadequate  medical  history;  physical  and \npsychiatric examinations  are  the exception,  not the rule;  and  have \nth~re \nteen extended delays  in referrals for obs@rvabl@  l!1!โฌ dical  problems.  Only  if \n32 \n\nthe  medical history indicates  an  existing problem,  will  an  inmate  be \nexamined,  often weeks  later,  by  a  physician. \n182.  Despite  the  recent  sudden  increase  in  inmate  population, \n, \nthere have  been no  additions  to the  already  overburdened medical  staff. \nNurses  sometimes must work  two  consecutive shifts to ensure minimal medical \ncoverage.  At  times  when  there  is  only  one  nurse  on  duty,  she  is  often \nunable to get the prescribed medication to all inmates  requiring medication. \nLAW  LIBRARY \n183.  There  is  no  law  library at ECJA.  In order to .obtain a  law \nbook,  an  inmate must  have  a  specific cite to request. \nCLASSIFICATION \n184.  Overcrowding  at ECJA  has  made  a  meaningful  system  of \nclassification virtually impossible.  As  a  rule,  inmates  are assigned to any \narea where  space becomes  available. \nEFFECT  OF  OVERCROWDING  ON  INMATES  AND  OTHER  PRCGRAMS  AND  SERVICES \n185.  Overcrowding,  understaffing,  inadequate program space and the \ncondi tions  in the housing and  living units,  as described in paragraphs  1  to \n184,  have caused pervasive  idleness,  have  severely limited or  eliminated the \nopportunity  for  recreation,  exercise,  and visitation,  have seriously impeded \nsanitation,  safety and the  provision of even  the  most  essential \nmedica~ \nservices,  have  created anxiety and violence,  have threatened the \nin~tes' \nphysical and mental wellbeing,  have  threatened to produce  debilitation  in \nchose  confined,  and  have  inflicted needless  privations and hardships  on \ninmates detained at the ECJA. \n186.  Overcrowding and  its consequences,  as described in paragraphs \n1  to  185,  further  has  prevented the defendants  from providing  needed \nmedical,  dental  and psychologial  screening and  care  for  ECJA  inmates, \n33 \n\nregular programs  for  religious  worship,  fair  procedures  for  inmate \ndiscipline,  and has  contributed to  the development  of an  unsanitary, \nhazardous and. insecure environment  for both inmates  and staff. \n, \nCAUSES  OF ACTION \nCount One \nConditions  and Practices that Amount  to Punishment \n187.  Plaintiffs and members  of the  class  repeat  the  allegations \ncontained in paragraphs 1  through 186 of this Corrplaint as though the same \nwere  set forth at length herein. \n188.

Defendant  Fauver's  failure  and  refusal  to make  adequate \nfindings with regard to the determination of the conditions,  circumstances \nand  surroundings  under  which  inmates  are confined at the  jail arbitrarily \nand unreasonably deprive plaintiffs and members  of the class of their  right \n36 \n\nto due  process ยทof  law,  in violation  of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments \nto the Constitution of the  United  States,  Art.  1  paragraph  1  of the  New \nJersey Constitution,  and constitute a  violation of N.J.S.A.  30:1-14. \n, \nCount  Seven \nDeprivation of Due  Process by State Defendant's \nFailure to Restrict Admissions \n199.

Defendant Fauver's  arbitrary and unreasonable  failure  and \nrefusal  to determine  that the  jail is in wilful and continuous disregard crt.-. \nthe minimum  standards  for county  jails,  and to order the closing of sections \nof the  jailor a  phased restriction of admission  of new  inmates  to the \nfacility,  deprive plaintiffs and members  of the class of  their right  to  due \nprocess  of  law,  in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments  to the \nConstitution of the  States and Art.  1,  paragraph 1  of the New Jersey \nUn~ted \nConstitution,  and constitute a  violation of N.J.S.A.  30:8-57. \nCount  Eight \nDeprivation of Due  Process By  State  Defendant's \nFailure to Take Action  To  Require COmPliance  with Minimum  Jail Standards \n201.

Plaintiffs and members  of the  class  repeat  the  allegations \ncontained in paragraphs  1 through 186  of this Complaint  as though the same \nwere  set forth at length herein. \n206.  The  actions  or  inactions of the county and state defendants \nhave  subjected  plaintiffs  and  members  of  the  class  to  physical, \npsychological  and  emotional distress,  pain,  deterioration and  : co \"\"ry,  as \nwell as  loss of liberty,  and with reckless  and  callous  indifference,  have \nsub jected  plaintiffs  and  member  of  t he  claSS  to  Vn18Wful  and \n38 \n\nunconstitutional conditions and practices  at  the  jail,  thereby  entitling \nplaintiffs and members  of the  class to nominal,  compensatory and punitive \ndamages. \n, \nGROUNDS  FOR  INJUNCTIVE  RELIEF \n207.  The  aforesaid conditions  and practices  are  known  to the \ndefendants,  their agents  and their employees,  but  these  conditions and \npractices have  been  allowed to continue  and to become  worse,  without \nappropriate  and  effective  efforts  being  made  to bring about  their \nelimination or correction,  in a  manner that would provide  relief for \ntimel~ \nthose plaintiffs who  have  suffered and will continue to suffer from these \ncondition& and practices. \n208.  The  aforesaid conditions  of confinement  and  official and \nunofficial practices are allowed to continue and are imposed by defendants \nacting under color of law of the State of New  Jersey. \n209.  There  is an  actual  controversy  between  plaintiffs  and \ndefendants,  in that  the  defendants  impose  or allow the  conditions  and \npractices  above  described  to  exist  and  to  continue  unimpeded  and \nuncorrected. \n210.  Plaintiffs and the  class they  represent  have  no  adequate \nremedy  at law,  thus making  injunctive and declaratory relief appropriate. \n211.  Plaintiffs and members  of the  class  are  suffering and will \ncontinue  to  suffer immediate,  substantial and  irreparable injury in the \nfuture,  unless  a  preliminary  injunction  is  issued,  which  should  remain \npermanent  after a  full evidentiary hearing. \n212.  The  actions and inactions of the defendants  as  alleged,  and \nthe claims of the plaintiffs and the class they represent,  require that this \n39 \n\nCourt declare  rights and legal relationships of the  parties  in  respect \n~e \nto the conditions at the Essex County  Jail Annex. \nAVAILABLE  REMEDIES \n, \n213.  Since the physical plant in certain sections of the Annex  is \nbeyond reasonable  repair,  remedies  to ensure provision of adequate  physical \nconditions  must  include closing  sections  of that  facility,  acquiring \ntemporary housing units  for the population which must  remain  incarcerated, \nand construction of a  new  jail facility. \n214.  Additionally,  several potential methods  of  reducing the \npopulation confined at the  ECJA  are  available  and  should be implemented-\nrapidly: \na.  increased  funding  and  staffing to maximize  use  of \nexisting pretrial release programs  as  an alternative to  low bail  for  minor \noffenders; \nb.  design and implementation of programs  to provide a  system \nof  superviSed pre-trial release or home-based detention for offenders unable \nto secure their release on bail while awaiting trial; \nc .  contracting for  residential half-way house programs  as  a \ntreatment alternative for  inmates  confined on  offenses  related to  drug  or \nalcohol abuse; \nd.  contracting  for  programs  that  provide  non-custodial \ndisposition alternatives emphasizing restitution,  community  service and  job \nt raining for inmates  on  non-violent offenses; \nccnfL~ed \ne.  utilization of other unused  facilities  in  hospitals, \ninstitutions,  schools,  or commercial buildings  for offenders  not \n\"~sidential \nrequiring maximum  security confinement,  such as  those held ob non-indictable \ncharges,  or  on  WOrK  releQse Or  se~ing sentences on weekendB  only; \n40 \n\nL  increased funding to provide more  intensive review of the \nappropriateness of all sentences to evaluate alternatives  to  incarceration \nand shortening of sentences  for non-dangerous  offenders. \n, \nPRAYERS  COR  RELIEF \nWHEREFORE,  plaintiffs pray  on  behalf of themselves  and  all others \nsimilarly situated that  this Court  assume  jurisdiction and provide  the \nfollowing relief: \n1.

Issue  an Order  permanently requiring the defendants,  their agents, \ntheir employees,  and  those  acting  in concert  with  them,  to  reduce  the \npcpulation of the Essex County  Jail Annex  to  constitutional  levels  and  to \nset a  timetable for such reduction; \n5.  Issue an Order permanently  requiring the  defendants  to take  all \nsuch  action  as  may  be necessary to ensure that the pcpulation of the Essex \nCounty  Jail Annex  does  not  exceed  the  numbers  that  may  safely  and \nconstitutionally be confined there; \n42 \n\n6.

The  Complaint  was  filed \nwith  the  Court  on  March  9,  1987. \nThe  suit  seeks  an  injunction  to  prohibit  maintaining \novercrowded  conditions  at  the  Jail  Annex  and  certain  policies \naffecting  conditions  at  the  Jail  Annex. \nThe  lawsuit  is  complex  and  involves  many  issues.  The \nFederal  Court  has  not  yet  determined  whether  or  not  the  charges  are \ntrue,  or  what  final  relief,  if  any,  the  plaintiffs  are  entitled  to. \nThe  plaintiffs  are  represented  by  the  Office  of  Inmate \nAdvocacy  of  the  New  Jersey-Public  Defender,  by  attorneys  T.  Gary \nMitchell  and  Audrey  Bomse,  CN  850,  Trenton,  New  Jersey  08625.  The \ninterests  of  all  inmates  whether  or  not  they  are  named  as  plaintiffs \nwill  be  represented  by  the  present  plaintiffs  and  their  attorneys. \nIf  any  inmate  wishes  to  intervene  personally  in  the  action,  however, \nhe  or  she  (or  an  attorney  on  his  or  her  behalf)  may  file  a  Motion  to \nIntervene  with  the  Clerk  of  the  United  States  District  Court,  United \nStates  Courthouse,  Newark,  New  Jersey  08605. \nIt  is  ORDERED  that  a  copy  of  this  Notice  be  given  to  each \ninmate  now  confined  at  the  Essex  County  Jail  Annex,  and  by  the \nadmitting  officer  to  each  inmate  committed  to  the  Essex  County  Jail \nAnnex  during  the  pendency  of  this  lawsuit.

Rullan, 378 F.3d 42, 45 (1st Cir.\n2004).  But, alas, after more than two decades, this, the oldest open case in the District of New\nJersey, will finally be put to eternal rest.  That is, for the reasons set forth below, I see no reason\nwhy this Court should remain involved in this matter.  As a result, I will not approve the\nproposed Third Consolidated Consent Order, I will dismiss this case, and I will direct the Clerk\nto close the case.\nOn December 14, 2006, my Special Masters, Bennet Zurofsky, Esq. and Fred Becker,\nEsq., filed with this Court their Report and Recommendation (โR&Rโ) along with the proposed\nThird Consolidated Consent Order (โTCCOโ).  The proposed TCCO is intended to supersede the\nSecond Consolidated Consent Order (โSCCOโ), which was approved and entered by me on\nAugust 8, 1995.  \n\nCase 2:87-cv-00871-HAA-ES     Document 124     Filed 02/05/2007     Page 2 of 6(cid:10)\nSince the SCCO was entered, the landscape that initiated this lawsuit has changed\ndramatically, in at least two significant ways.  First, a year after entry of the SCCO, Congress \nenacted the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1996 (the โPLRAโ) in response โto concerns that\nsimilar consent decrees were crippling prison systems throughout the country.โ  Imprisoned\nCitizens Union v. Ridge, 169 F.3d 178, 182 (3d Cir. 1999).  Second, Essex County built a new\ncorrectional facility at a cost of approximately $416 million.  The combination of these two\nsignificant developments, after careful analysis, yields the conclusion that this Court no longer\nneeds to be involved.\nOn March 9, 1987, Plaintiffs filed the Complaint in this case, alleging all manner of\ndeplorable conditions in the Essex County Jail system, which at that time comprised the Essex\nCounty Jail in Newark, the Green Street holding facilities, and the Essex County Jail Annex in\nNorth Caldwell (collectively the โJail Facilitiesโ).1  The Complaint alleged that the Jail Facilitiesโ\nproblems included: โsinks and pipes that are rusted and leaking sewage and water; walls and\nfloors that are covered with filth; showers that are encrusted with green and black slime; rampant\ninfestation by insects and rodents; exposed electrical wiring; crumbling ceilings, falling window\npanes, and rusted and rotted roofing.โ  (Compl. at ยถ 2.)  In addition, the Complaint alleged that\nโthe inadequate supply of bunks has forced hundreds of inmates to sleep on stretchers amid litter\nand puddles of water.โ  (Compl. at ยถ 3.)  As noted above, Essex County opened a new corrections\nfacility in early 2004 on Doremus Avenue in Newark, where all County inmates are housed.  The\nJail Facilities that instigated this litigation are no longer in operation.\n1 I have had litigation involving these facilities going back to 1982, but the earlier cases\nhave since been dismissed, e.g., Essex County Inmates v. Collier, Civ. No. 82-1945 (D.N.J.\n1982).\n2\n\nCase 2:87-cv-00871-HAA-ES     Document 124     Filed 02/05/2007     Page 3 of 6(cid:10)\nOn Friday, January 26, 2007, I visited the new 800,000-square-foot Essex County\nCorrectional Facility (โECCFโ), accompanied by my law clerks.  Also in attendance were\ncounsel for Plaintiffs and Defendants, as well as my Special Masters and Essex County\nExecutive Joseph Divincenzo.  Upon arrival, the Director of the ECCF and his senior level staff\nprovided a formal introduction to the facility and its inner workings.  In our visit to the ECCF, I\nobserved virtually all aspects of the facility, namely those parts related to habitation, medication,\nrecreation, sanitation, food service, and access to the courts, including the law library.  On each\nand every element, I found the ECCF to be eminently adequate to the task at hand and run by\nabsolute professionals with considerable experience in the corrections business.  All told, I was\nhighly impressed with both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the facility.  Gone\ncompletely were the โhorrifying, inhumane and utterly intolerable conditionsโ that plagued the\nJail Facilities as alleged in the Complaint filed in 1987.  (See Compl. at ยถ 2.)\nWith respect to the proposed TCCO, I am cognizant that it suggests, in effect, a six-\nmonth hiatus after which time this case would be formally closed, but would remain subject to\nreopening for an additional six months.  But I believe that the PLRA prevents me from approving\nthe proposed TCCO both in its present constitution and any conceivable future formulation.\nThe PLRA provides a district court guidance in navigating the labyrinth of managing\nprison systems.  Specifically, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3626(c)(1) addresses consent decrees, such as the\nproposed TCCO, by declaring that โ[i]n any civil action with respect to prison conditions, the\ncourt shall not enter or approve a consent decree unless it complies with the limitations on relief\nset forth in subsection (a).โ  18 U.S.C. ยง 3626(c)(1).  Section 3626(a) provides the requirements\nfor granting prospective relief, namely that โ[t]he court shall not grant or approve any prospective\n3\n\nCase 2:87-cv-00871-HAA-ES     Document 124     Filed 02/05/2007     Page 4 of 6(cid:10)\nrelief unless the court finds that such relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary\nto correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct\nthe violation of the Federal right.โ  18 U.S.C. ยง 3626(a).\nThe proposed TCCO only addresses the โoccasionalโ overcrowding problem that has\nrecurred from โtime to time.โ  (R&R at 2.)  The proposed TCCO does not, unlike the SCCO,\naddress anything related to plumbing, bedding, sanitation, recreation, visitation, food service,\nlegal access or safety.  Apparently, the parties are in agreement that such violations have not\noccurred in even an occasional manner sufficient to warrant continued oversight by the Court.  I\nam in full agreement with the parties in this regard.  \nThe proposed TCCO, however, expressly declares that โthe parties agree that this\nmodified Order is appropriate as the least intrusive remedy for currently existing conditions and\npractices affecting the constitutional rights of plaintiffs that warrant continuing injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief, specifically to relieve existing or threatened overcrowding at the ECCF [Essex\nCounty Correctional Facility].โ  (TCCO at 1.)  Although the proposed TCCO never specifically\ncites the PLRA, which unequivocally controls my consideration of the proposed TCCO, the\nquote from the previous sentence appears to be a somewhat oblique reference to the statutory\nlanguage.  Nevertheless, I hasten to note that I have never been provided with any documentation\nregarding what exactly the โexisting or threatened overcrowdingโ currently is at ECCF.  On the\ncontrary, on the day I toured the facility, it was well below its 2,200 person capacity by nearly 90\npersons.  Moreover, the ECCFโs average daily prisoner population for 2006 was 2,081, again\nwell below capacity.\nNotably, Congress enacted the PLRA โto end the federal courtsโ perceived micro-\n4\n\nCase 2:87-cv-00871-HAA-ES     Document 124     Filed 02/05/2007     Page 5 of 6(cid:10)\nmanagement of our nationโs prisons.โ  Para-Profโl Law Clinic at SCI-Graterford v. Beard, 334\nF.3d 301, 303 (3d Cir. 2003).  The PLRA specifically instructs a judge in my position to do only\nwhat is necessary to correct a violation of a federal right.  18 U.S.C. ยง 3626(a).  But I am unable\nto perceive of any violation of a federal right to be corrected here.  As a result, I cannot see how\nany proposed consent decree could pass the tripartite requirements of 18 U.S.C. ยง 3626(a).  That\nis, no consent decree could be sufficiently narrow, extend no further than necessary and be the\nleast intrusive means of correcting a violation of a federal right if there is no federal rights\nviolation in the first place.  Therefore, I will not approve the proposed TCCO in this or any other\nform.\nDespite my decision to close this case today, I note that a suit regarding any future\nviolation of a federal right is not foreclosed by the PLRA, as some would argue.  Instead, as the\nThird Circuit noted in Para-Professional in interpreting the PLRA, โif a prisoner is in imminent\ndanger of a constitutional violation, the prisoner has prompt and complete remedies through a\nnew action filed in State or Federal court and preliminary injunctive relief.โ  Para-Profโl, 334\nF.3d at 304.  I am aware that the practical realitiesโincluding the stateโs abolishment of the\nInmate Advocacy Unit of the New Jersey Office of the Public Defenderโsignificantly curtails any\nchances of successful litigation to protect inmate rights such that aggressive future litigation after\nthe closing of this case is less likely.  Such a reality, however, is a consequence of policy\ndecisions within the state government, and clearly not within my jurisdiction to affect in any\nmanner.  The basis for this Federal Courtโs involvement in a county jail facilityโviolations of a\nFederal Constitutional magnitudeโhas ceased to exist.  Therefore, I must release my grasp\nbecause there is no longer anything within it.\n5\n\nCase 2:87-cv-00871-HAA-ES     Document 124     Filed 02/05/2007     Page 6 of 6(cid:10)\nI recognize that approval of the proposed TCCO, per all partiesโ request, would likely\nresult in the closing of this case in approximately six months.  Nevertheless, whatever common\nsense I have says that I should act now.  It is my earnest hope that the County Executive and his\nstaff will continue with the progress they have made and maintain the ECCF as a model for the\ncorrections industry.  And so it is my fervent hope that the legendary Phoenix that is this case\nwill at last find eternal rest.\nFinally, this Court would be extremely remiss if it did not acknowledge the outstanding\nservice of its two Special Masters, Messrs. Bennet Zurofsky and Fred Becker.  Mr. Zurofsky has\nlived with this case and served this Court well since 1982.  It is impossible to calculate with\nexactitude his outstanding service to the Court.  Mr. Becker came on board in April 1995.  As a\nlawyer with an outstanding reputation in this State, he has given his time and effort in an\nexemplary way.  The Court is grateful to both of these gentleman.\nConclusion and Order\nFor the foregoing reasons, the proposed Third Consolidated Consent Order is hereby\nNOT APPROVED.  In addition, this case is hereby DISMISSED and the Clerk shall mark this\ncase CLOSED.\nNewark, New Jersey\nDated: February 5, 2007 /s/ Harold A. Ackerman\nU.S.D.J.\n6",

Curtis Meanor, Podvey, Sachs, Meanor, Catenacci, Hildner & Cocoziello, PC, Newark, NJ, for Defendants.\nOPINION\nHAROLD A. ACKERMAN, District Judge.\nThis matter comes before the court on plaintiff's civil contempt motion and represents another chapter in the\nongoing Essex County prison litigation. Plaintiffs now request that the court award contempt sanctions for the\ncounty's failure to comply with the most recent consent decree. The Special Masters have filed a Report and a\nSupplemental Report. The parties were also given an opportunity to file objections to the reports.\nI. Background\nIn 1982, inmates of the Essex County Jail (\"ECJ\") brought suit against the county alleging unconstitutional\nconditions of confinement. The Essex County Jail Annex (\"ECJA\") prison litigation followed in 1987 and the cases\nwere eventually consolidated. Throughout the history of this litigation, the parties have resolved each of their\ndisputes through a series of consent decrees, the most recent one being the \"Second Consolidated Consent\nOrder\" (\"2CCO\"). The 2CCO embodies a \"bona fide settlement\" of the legal issues in this case. See Special\nMaster Report (\"Report\") at 7.\nThe 2CCO, which incorporates all of the rights and obligations of nine other consent orders previously filed, is a\nlengthy document which addresses \"virtually every aspect of jail administration ... from dripping faucets to\npopulation caps and medical care.\" Id. When filed, it aimed to ameliorate the deplorable conditions of\nconfinement which existed at the time. The instant contempt application, which was originally filed in December\n1993, requests that this court impose sanctions upon the county for failing to comply with several provisions of\nthe 2CCO. This court referred the contempt application to Special Masters Bennet Zurofsky and John Degnan,\n447 that latter of whom was replaced *447 by Frederic Becker on April 6, 1995. The Special Masters conducted 48\ndays of hearings and participated in an eight day tour of the facilities.\nThere does not seem to be any question that the county was in serious contempt in 1993, but several intervening\ndevelopments have effected a change in climate. Initially, I note that the parties have resolved many matters by\nconsent, e.g. the \"Medical Consent Order.\" On other matters, while the county was recalcitrant at first, it\neventually behaved more responsibly. Within the last three years, it has spent over $25 million in capital\n\nimprovements and has committed itself to building a new $200 million jail. Many hope and believe that the new\njail will eliminate any persisting problems. In light of these developments, the plaintiff submitted to the Special\nMaster its \"Brief to Update the Record\" outlining the areas in which it believes, the county has still not complied.\nThese specific complaints are the focus of the Special Master's Report.\nAccording to the Special Master, the update brief makes the following complaints:\n1. Staffing is inadequate and thus, inmates and staff are exposed to danger and other problems;\n2. The facilities have exceeded the population caps set by the 2CCO which has resulted in\novercrowding and the housing of inmates in dayrooms that has thereby endangered inmates and\ncreated unsanitary conditions;\n3. The institution serves inadequate food;\n4. The Fire Safety equipment and training is inadequate;\n5. There is an insufficient supply of personal hygiene items;\n6. There is an insufficient opportunity to shower;\n7. There are continuing maintenance problems, particularly with regard to water temperature;\n8. There is inadequate opportunity for recreation;\n9. The prison does not provide sufficient access to telephones for legal and family calls;\n10. The prison does not provide adequate visitation;\n11. The prison does not provide adequate access to law libraries which are themselves\ninadequate.\nSee Report at 13-14.\nOn December 18, 1997, the Special Masters submitted to this court their report recommending that with the\nexception of the staffing issue, the court should dismiss plaintiff's contempt application \"without prejudice to any\nnew motions that plaintiffs may wish to file regarding current conditions.\" Report at 8. According to the Special\nMasters, the dismissal should be \"premised upon Essex County's continuing commitment to complete its present\nprojects of building completely new jail facilities and making interim repairs and improvements.\" Id.\nWith respect to the staffing issue, the Special Master recommends that this court order the defendants to comply\nwith ยถ XIV of the 2CCO which would require them to commission an \"independent, professional staffing analysis\"\naddressing the areas of \"staff training, staff coverage, classification, inmate activity, inmate population, and\ncorrections operations.\" Additionally, the defendant must implement a plan based upon the independent analysis.\nSee Report at 34-36. Finally, the Special Master recommended that the court impose a fine of $100,000, the\npayment of which shall be suspended. See Report at 36.\nThe approach taken by the Special Masters is somewhat unique in that they have chosen not to focus on every\ndetail of the consent order. Rather, they acknowledge that the county is definitely not in full compliance in every\narea, but they are impressed by the fact that the county has made an enormous investment into improvements of\ncurrent facilities and the construction of a new jail. It is the Special Master's belief that the county's laudatory\nefforts make contempt sanctions inappropriate. The Special Masters' report focuses upon the following twenty-\nfive improvements:\n448 *448 1. Two new modular facilities have been built at the Annex, known as Satellite 6 and Satellite\n6A. These facilities were completed in 1995 with a combined capacity of 116, to hold male\ninmates. (Estimated cost: $3,444,337).\n2. A new Women's Wing has been built at the Annex, known as Satellite 7. This new building was\ncompleted in June 1996 with a capacity of 252 inmates. (Estimated cost: $15,585,745).\n\n3. A new Processing and Visitor Reception Center has been built at the Annex, completed in June\n1995. This facility improves the hospitality for inmate visitors (for example, there is now an indoor\nwaiting room with lockers for personal belongings rather than an outdoor line awaiting admission)\nand facilitates several steps of the inmate admission process. (Estimated cost: $3,855,956).\n4. A new \"support building\" was completed at the Annex in 1996, along with demolition of several\ndecaying structures and improvements to the perimeter. The support building includes a supply\nwarehouse so that greater stocks of clothing, hygiene items, and maintenance parts can be\nmaintained within the institutions than had been the case in the past. The building also includes\nworkshops for various repair and maintenance staff. This has resulted in improved maintenance at\nthe facilities. (Estimated cost: $4,039,956).\n5. A Central Intake Processing Unit was built on the first floor of the Jail in Newark to\naccommodate initial medical screening and examinations. (Estimated cost: $10,000).\n6. The installation of two additional elevators was completed at the Jail in Newark in April of 1994.\nThis work had been commenced pursuant to earlier consent orders but delays had plagued the\nproject and were a part of what underlay the original contempt motion. Completion of this work\nhas improved all prisoner movements throughout the thirteen-story structure and generally\nimproved safety. The two original elevators have also been rehabilitated. At the time of the original\nmotion filing the old elevators were subject to frequent failures and there had even been some\ninjuries when elevators fell between floors. (Estimated cost: $3,808,730).\n7. Satellites 1 and 2 at the Annex have been completely rehabilitated. Work was completed on\nSatellite 1 in October 1997 and on Satellite 2 in July 1997. Prior to rehabilitation these were two of\nthe worst housing areas. Satellite 2 was the old Women's Wing, which we described at some\nlength above. Satellite 1 consists of a group of modular units that were installed as a temporary\nmeasure during Peter Shapiro's administration in an effort to solve overcrowding problems. They\nbecame permanent and were used well beyond their original anticipated life. Ventilation was\nvirtually non-existent in Satellite 1 and there was no fire-suppression or sprinkler system\nwhatsoever. The rehabilitation brought both Satellites up to code. In addition, one of the housing\npods in Satellite 1 was converted into an indoor recreation area. (Estimated cost: $4,205,386).\n8. The rehabilitation of Satellites 3 and 4 at the Annex is now scheduled to be completed by June\n1998. This work could not get underway before the recent completion of the Satellite 1\nrehabilitation because there was no place to put the prisoners who need to be removed in order\nfor construction to take place. Satellites 3 and 4 are trailer-like facilities originally built as a\ntemporary measure to deal with overpopulation while satellite 5 was being constructed at the\nAnnex during the Nicholas Amato administration. These too have become permanent and have\n449 outlived their predicted lifespan. The rehabilitation *449 will address fire safety, plumbing, HVAC\nand electric. (Estimated cost: $942,000).\n9. The East Gate of the Annex is being rehabilitated and is scheduled for completion this month.\nThis is a staging area for inmate movements in and out of the Annex. (Estimated cost: $205,639).\n10. A consulting fire protection engineer has been retained. This is the County's fire safety expert\nwho has been working with the plaintiffs' expert in designing and then supervising the installation\nof improved fire safety equipment and procedures throughout both institutions. (Estimated cost\n(annually): $52,850).\n11. Smoke detectors and sprinklers have been renovated and installed throughout the Jail in a\nproject completed in October, 1997. Previously, the smoke detectors generally did not function\nand many of the sprinkler installations were inadequate to cover the intended areas. (Estimated\ncost: $440,000).\n\n12. Smoke barriers were built throughout the Jail in a project completed in October 1997. These\nare essentially solid walls that prevent smoke from migrating from tier to tier or floor to floor. In\nother institutions such smoke migration has been a frequent cause of serious injury. (Estimated\ncost: $244,743).\n13. A centralized fire safety reporting center is being built at the Annex, scheduled to be completed\nat about the time of this writing. The Annex consists of many separate buildings. This center will\nprovide a central monitoring location for all fire and smoke alarms and detectors throughout the\nfacility. (Estimated cost: $10,935).\n14. The County has entered into consolidated maintenance and inspection contracts with an\noutside contractor to insure that all fire safety systems remain operable. (Estimated cost (annual):\n$10,000.)\n15. The Jail has contracted for a rehabilitation of its sally port, which is the primary port of entry\nand egress to that facility. Work is expected to be completed in the Spring of 1998. This should\nimprove the accommodation of those who come to bail out prisoners. It does not particularly relate\nto any of plaintiffs' priorities, although it will be helpful. (Estimated cost: $515,000.)\n16. Both institutions are in the midst of a network computer systems upgrade that is intended to\nlink the Jail and Jail Annex computer systems into a single network and is scheduled to be\ncompleted this month. With regard to issues raised in the contempt application, it is expected that\nthe enhanced PC network will include a terminal in each satellite of the Jail Annex that will permit\nlegal research through the use of centralized cd roms and other means, commissary records will\nalso be better kept and medical records will be more accessible and reliably complete when an\ninmate is transferred between the Jail and the Annex. If it all works, this will be a great\nimprovement. (Estimated cost: $143,166).\n17. The County has privatized its medical services, retaining Correctional Health Services, Inc. to\nprovide it with all physicians, nurses, supervisory personnel, medical clerks, and pharmacy and\nlab services. The provision of this service is monitored by Dr. Ronald Shansky, who was appointed\nby this Court and reports on a quarterly basis. According to Dr. Shansky, medical services are\ngreatly improved. (Estimated cost (annual): $4,600,000).\n18. The County has contracted with St. Elizabeth's Hospital for a medical lock unit and specialist\nvisits. Previously there were recurring problems finding bed space and appropriate specialists\n450 when needed for inmate *450 care. Estimated cost (annual): $1,000,000.\n19. The County has added 77 additional corrections officers to its table of organization beyond it\n1994 staffing level. The 1994 level reflected cuts in staff made by the D'Allessio administration.\n20. The County advises that it has now provided Correctional Officer Training Academy training to\nall correctional officers who have been employed for more than one year. Previous to this motion,\nvery few of the officers had received this training despite the fact that it is the minimum training\nrequired by State regulation. We believe the large amount of untrained staff had contributed to\nmany problems. (Estimated cost: $268,000).\n21. Exterminators have been retained for forty hours per week at the Jail and twenty hours per\nweek at the Annex. The need was obvious. The benefits are obvious. (Estimated cost (annual):\n$100,000).\n22. The County has implemented a so-called S.L.A.P. program, which is an early work-release\nprogram for sentenced prisoners under the supervision of the Sheriff's office. There are presently\napproximately 25 prisoners in this program. When fully implemented, the program should\naccommodate 125 prisoners. Those admitted to the program are sentenced prisoners who are\n\nreleased early from the Jail or the Annex to a work program. This is an alternative to incarceration\nof the type sought by plaintiffs.\n23. The County has created an Expeditor position to help insure that prisoners are not held\ninappropriately. In the past, some prisoners seemed to get lost in the system and were not\nreleased although their Essex County criminal court proceedings may have permitted release.\nThis was due to a variety of factors including holds from family court or from other jurisdictions and\nall sorts of bureaucratic malfunctions. The Expeditor has been in place since August of 1995 and\nappears to be effective with, we believe, a beneficial impact on population. (Estimated cost\n(annual): $35,000).\n24. With the assistance of appropriate consultants, the County has written a Jail Master Plan\nwhich, among other things, attempts to predict the number and provide Constitutionally\nappropriate accommodation for Essex County inmates for the next 25 years. It was the\ndevelopment of this plan which directly led the County to conclude that it needed to construct a\nnew jail. (Estimated cost: $202,000).\nSee Report at 16-24.\nFinally, the Special Master looked at the County's commitment to building a new jail which is:\nbeing designed to hold at least 2400 prisoners, and perhaps as many as 3,000. The design will be\nin a star pattern that will permit the addition of more wings if more space becomes necessary. We\nare not experts on Jail design, but we understand that the project is being designed by leading\nexperts in the field and in accordance with current thinking on what is needed for such a facility.\nThe County has designated a site on Doremus Avenue in Newark and it has also retained an\narchitectural and engineering firm and a construction management firm. The County hopes to be\nable to open the facility in the year 2000 and has already begun to make plans for different uses of\nthe present Jail and Jail Annex sites. Two Hundred Million Dollars of bonding has been authorized\nfor this project through the Essex County Improvement Authority. Ground-breaking is scheduled\nfor the spring of 1998. We believe this to be a real project which will be completed in a reasonably\ntimely manner.\nId. at 24-5.\nUntil the new jail is built, a period likely to be \"several years,\" there is no question that the plaintiff class will still\n451 be \"suffering deprivations of some of the rights that they had *451 obtained through the consent orders.\" Id. at 16.\nBut the underlying rationale behind the Special Master's recommendation is that the new jail:\nwill eventually provide fully adequate conditions of confinement, that the closing of the present\nfacilities upon the completion of that construction will render most of the provisions of the [2CCO]\nmoot, and that the present conditions are being greatly ameliorated by the County's efforts.\nId. at 16.\nAs the Special Master perceives the situation, any contempt sanctions would only be counterproductive and\nwould impede the County's efforts in building the new jail. Thereby, the prisoners would be denied the ultimate\nrealization of better prison conditions. If this approach has any vulnerability, it is its demand that the current\nprisoners make some sacrifice for those of the future.\nIt is important to note, however, that in recommending this practical and sensible approach, the Special Masters\nwere keenly aware that their decision did not allow any conditions that might reach unconstitutional levels to be\ncontinued. In other words, they recognized that while the prisoners might be asked to relinquish some of the\nbenefits guaranteed by the 2CCO, their constitutional rights remain intact. Thus, it cannot be said the Special\nMasters have completely ignored the plight of current inmates. Had the Special Masters believed that the\nconditions violated the inmates' constitutional rights, I doubt that they would have made the same\nrecommendations. The performance of the Special Masters throughout the history of this litigation confirms as\n\nmuch. They have never shied away from difficult decisions. Furthermore, in recommending that the court not\nimpose sanctions, the Special Masters expressed their awareness that the defendants' commitment to invest\nover $250 million far exceeds any amount of sanctions requested by the plaintiff.\nIn response to the Special Master Report, the plaintiff initially made several objections. These objections cover\nthe areas of:\n00 Overcrowding;\n95\n00 Visitation;\n95\n00 Showers;\n95\n00 Hygiene Supplies;\n95\n00 Clothing;\n95\n00 Legal Access;\n95\n00 Recreation;\n95\n00 Implementation of Alternatives to Incarceration;\n95\n00 Staffing; and\n95\n00 Classification.\n95\nUpon its review of the Report and plaintiffs' objections, the court expressed concern with some of the report's\nshortcomings and requested that the Special Masters make supplemental findings in six areas: shower\nconditions, clothing, recreation, inmate classification, alternatives to incarceration, and distribution of hygiene\nitems. The Special Masters submitted a Supplemental Report on July 21, 1998. Plaintiff filed additional objections\non July 29, 1998. The supplemental findings will be considered along with the rest of the record. I will consider\neach of plaintiff's objections in turn.\nII. The Contempt Power\nThe court has the \"inherent power to enforce compliance with its lawful orders through civil contempt.\" Carty v.\nSchneider, 986 F.Supp. 933, 939 (D.Vi.1997) (quoting Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1, 78 S.Ct. 1401, 3 L.Ed.2d 5\n(1958)). The power to hold one in contempt is an equitable one, the purpose of which is to make the defendant\ncomply with an order of the court. With the instant application, the court must consider \"the character and\nmagnitude of the harm threatened by continued contumacy and the probable effectiveness of any suggested\nsanction in bringing about the result desired.\" United States v. United Mine Workers of America, 330 U.S. 258,\n304, 67 S.Ct. 677, 91 L.Ed. 884 (1947). There must be a \"balancing of equities.\" See Imprisoned Citizens Union\nv. Shapp, 1998 WL 220957, *17 (E.D.Pa.1998). The court also acknowledges that while the instant case involves\na consent decree as opposed to direct allegations of unconstitutional prison conditions, it is mindful of the\n452 deference courts have exhibited towards state corrections officials in prison litigation. *452See Bell v. Wolfish,\n441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979) (in considering whether conditions are reasonably related to\na legitimate goal, Justice Rehnquist explained that courts must \"heed ... [the] warning that such considerations\nare peculiarly within the province and professional expertise of corrections officials....\")\nIII. Discussion\nA. Overcrowding\nAlmost every problem at the prison is but a symptom of the overcrowding problem. As the Special Master has\nnoted:\n\nWhen there are too many inmates all conditions of confinement deteriorate. People only sleep on\nfloors when there are no beds; people are only housed in dayrooms when there are no more cells\nor dormitories available; people lose recreation opportunities when the gym is being used as a\nbunkhouse or there are more inmates than it is possible to accommodate; medical care is worse\nwhen the doctors and nurses have more patients than they can handle; the more a toilet is used,\nthe more often it breaks.\nReport at 25.\nTo ameliorate its population problem, the 2CCO sets caps for the prison. Under these caps, the ECJ may house\n594 inmates and the ECJA, 909 inmates. Additionally, the order prohibits the use of dayrooms to house inmates.\nAt the present time, there is no dispute that the prison has yet to comply with these provisions, but because the\ncounty has \"embarked\" upon a new program that is expected to ultimately eliminate all population problems, the\nSpecial Masters have recommended that the court not impose sanctions.\nUnder its new program, the county has renovated and reconstructed the ECJA's \"satellites\" and it will soon begin\nconstruction for its new $200 million jail. As I have already noted above, the county has added 368 beds to the\nprison capacity by building two new modular facilities known as Satellite 6 and Satellite 6A and a new Women's\nWing known as Satellite 7. See Discussion, supra. Most importantly, once the new jail is completed in the year\n2000, it will hold at least 2400 prisoners, and perhaps as many as 3,000. Without the new jail, the county will\ncontinue to exceed the population caps set by the 2CCO.\nWhile the county may not have satisfied the population caps set by the 2CCO, sanctions are not warranted in this\ninstance. The purpose of exercising the contempt power is to ensure compliance with an order of the court, in this\ncase the 2CCO, and the court has \"great and sound discretion in fashioning an appropriate sanction for\ncontempt.\" Robin Woods Inc. v. Woods, 28 F.3d 396, 399 (3d Cir.1994). In balancing the equities, the court must\nconsider \"the character and magnitude of the harm threatened by continued contumacy and the probable\neffectiveness of any suggested sanction in bringing about the result desired.\" United States v. United Mine\nWorkers of America, 330 U.S. 258, 304, 67 S.Ct. 677, 91 L.Ed. 884 (1947). Moreover, while good faith is not a\ndefense to civil contempt, it may affect the court's calculation of sanctions. See Robin Woods, supra, at 399; \nHarley-Davidson Inc. v. Morris, 19 F.3d 142, 148 (3d Cir.1994). Here, I do not believe that awarding monetary\nsanctions will serve any purpose.\nThe county is currently engaged in its assiduous effort to solve its inmate population problem by investing over\n$200 million in new facilities and improving existing ones. Because the current facilities suffer from deep-rooted\ninfirmities due to age, size and design which will never be fully remedied, the current arrangement, by itself, will\nnot reach the desired prison population. From that, it follows that there is no type of monetary sanctions which will\ncoerce compliance. But while the population level fails to comply with the 2CCO, the housing situation does not\nimpinge upon constitutional rights. Because the inmates' constitutional rights will not be jeopardized and\nmonetary sanctions can only be counter-productive, the court will not invoke its contempt power.\nMy reasoning resembles that of Judge Brotman in Carty v. Schneider, 986 F.Supp. 933 (D.Vi.1997). In Carty,\n453 pretrial detainees and inmates moved for contempt sanctions against government officials for failing to *453\ncomply with a consent decree addressing conditions of confinement. Parties had entered the consent decree in\nOctober 1994. As with the instant case, the court viewed overcrowding as the \"proverbial `bad seed' that has\nengendered many of the related constitutional violations.\" Id. at 937. In January 1997, the Carty court held the\ndefendants in contempt for not complying with the consent decree, but did not hold a hearing on sanctions until\nApril and did not render its opinion until December 1997. By that time, the defendants had solved the \"immediate\npopulation problem\" addressed by the consent decree and they had begun to effect other necessary changes,\nbut other \"persistent problems\" regarding medical care, nutrition, running water, regular extermination, staff\ntraining, fire prevention, and legal access continued. Nevertheless, the court declined to impose monetary\nsanctions. The court found that the \"remedial measures taken to date [were] the first of many necessary and\nforthcoming steps towards global compliance with the Agreement\" and it concluded that \"monetary contempt\nsanctions would affect drastically the public interest and perhaps more importantly, would impede progress and\nthwart the defendants' continuing efforts to remedy the conditions of confinement.\" Id. at 940. Most importantly,\n\nthe court did not rubber-stamp the defendants' efforts, but admonished them \"to maintain the momentum\ngenerated by ... recent achievements\" and it predicted that a \"failure to achieve compliance with the substantive\nterms of the Agreement in the near future ... w[ould] affect the court's response to prospective motions for relief.\" \nId. Similarly, the court will not order monetary sanctions here.\nB. Visitation\nAdditionally, now is not the time to impose sanctions for the county's failure to comply with the visitation\nprovisions of the consent decree. Plaintiffs allege that the county has not complied with the consent decree\nbecause it only grants inmates visitation rights on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday as opposed to the\nsix days required at the ECJ and the five days required at the ECJA. See Plaintiffs' Opposition at 57. They further\ncomplain that the ECJ only allows noncontact visits and that when it is crowded with visitors, the jail does not\nprovide the twenty minutes mandated by the 2CCO. Id. at 58-9. In their report, the Special Masters acknowledge\nthat when these facilities are overcrowded, there are \"recurring problems with visitation, the principal problem\nbeing that visitors wait too long in uncomfortable surroundings for too short a visit in an uncomfortable visitation\nroom.\" Report at 41-2. But the Special Masters have noted, the county \"has undertaken some construction\nprojects designed, in part, to improve the situation for visitors, especially at the Annex where most of the\nprisoners are held.\" Id. Among these improvements is a new \"Processing and Visitor Reception Center\" at the\nAnnex. Furthermore, the county is making more improvements and it has designed the jail to \"better\naccommodate prisoner visits.\" See Id.\nThe court recognizes that the prison is not in full compliance with the 2CCO at this time, but for the same reasons\nthat it has not imposed sanctions for overcrowding, it agrees with the Special Masters that monetary sanctions\nare not warranted.\nC. Showers\nThe 2CCO requires that the County \"`maintain all showers in working order' ... with particular requirements\nregarding water temperature, ventilation, prevention of mold, mildew and rust, and maintenance.\" See\nSupplemental Report at 2 (citing 2CCO). At the time that the plaintiffs filed this motion, the Special Masters's\nReport notes, the accumulation of maintenance problems 00 those being \"scalding showers\" and \"epidemic leaks\"\n97\n00 had \"amounted to a serious problem that affected the habitability of many housing units.\" Report at 40. The\n97\nplaintiffs have complained about the conditions at both the ECJA and the ECJ.\n1. ECJA\nBased upon the testimony of inmates, plaintiffs contend that there are continuing shower problems. See Plaintiff's\n454 Objections at 38-39. Apparently, access to showers is *454 limited and the showers still have temperature\nproblems. See Plaintiff's Objections at 38-39. As a result, plaintiffs contend, some inmates no longer shower at\nthe ECJA. In contrast, the Special Masters have concluded that the problems were \"largely remedied\" by the\n\"complete rehabilitation of the worst areas, particularly satellites 1,2,3 and 4 at the Annex\" and by \"keeping ...\nmaintenance workers actively employed.\" See Report at 40.\nSince the filing of plaintiff's objections, the County has completed the rehabilitation of Satellite 3 and is in the\nprocess of completing the rehabilitation of Satellite 4. These projects involve the \"replacement of the showers\nwhere necessary and a full overhaul of the plumbing in the trailer-housing area ....\" Supplemental Report at 3; Ex.\nA (copy of June 25, 1998 letter from the County to the court). The County has also committed $50,000 to\n[1]\nperforming the same repairs throughout the ECJA and East Wing by the end of the year.  Finally, in a letter to\nthe court dated June 25, 1998, the county informed the court that it was planning the rehabilitation of Satellite 5\n(estimated cost of $100,000 to $140,000) and anticipated awarding the contract by July.\nThe court acknowledges that showers may not satisfy every inmate, but the court does not believe that sanctions\nare warranted. Based upon the foregoing, the county has demonstrated its dedication to eradicating these\n\nproblems and there is no doubt that the county has taken its responsibilities under the 2CCO seriously. To the\nextent that problems remain, it is expected that they will be fully rectified once current and future projects are\ncompleted. Thus, I do not believe that monetary sanctions for the ECJA will serve any purpose at this time. The\ncounty is already spending a substantial amount of money to respond to the inmates' complaints. However, the\ncourt admonishes the county that it must not falter in its mission.\n2. ECJ\nAt the ECJ, the plaintiffs complain of even greater deficiencies than those at the ECJA. According to the inmates,\nthe showers continue to be \"so scalding hot or ice cold that inmates are frequently unable to use the shower at\nall.\" Plaintiff's Objections at 38. Additionally, leaking from the ceiling of the shower areas into light fixtures\nexposes the prisoners to the possibility of electric shock. See Id. In its initial report, the Special Master made no\nfindings regarding the conditions of the showers in the ECJ. The court was concerned with this error and asked\nfor supplemental findings. Further investigation by the Special Masters has revealed that while the county has not\nbeen so diligent in making improvements at the ECJ, it has now begun \"advertising\" for construction bids to\nrepair or replace all shower units at the jail at an estimated cost of $250,000 00 $500,000. Id. at Ex. A. It has\n97\ninformed the court that it will award a contract at the end of August 1998 and will require that the work be\ncompleted within 120 days. Id.\nFurthermore, the New Jersey Department of Corrections recently inspected the ECJ and concluded that the\ncounty had complied with standards set by New Jersey regulations. This standard requires that there be \"at least\none operable shower with temperature controlled hot and cold water available for every 16 inmates\" and that the\nshower shall \"be accessible to inmate[s] without the necessity of leaving the immediate housing.\" Id. at Ex. B, p.\n1 (copy of inspection report).\nBased upon the foregoing, the court does not believe that contempt sanctions are appropriate at this time. The\npurpose of contempt sanctions is to compel compliance with a court order. Here, the county has committed\n$250,000 00 $500,000 to making repairs and it has complied with New Jersey's regulatory standards. The court\n97\nbelieves and accepts the county's representation that it will award a construction contract by August 1998. The\nimposition of contempt sanctions would only be counterproductive.\n455 D. Hygiene Items\n*455\nNext, the plaintiffs have objected to the Special Master's report regarding \"hygiene items.\" Plaintiffs have focused\nupon the 2CCO's requirement that:\n[e]ach inmate ... be issued adequate amounts of necessary personal hygiene items, including\ntoilet paper, soap, shampoo, toothpaste, toothbrush, comb, mirror, individual razors, and shaving\ncream or powder.\nPlaintiffs' Objections at 31.\nPlaintiffs have not contested the Special Master's finding that the County has \"increased its inventory of ...\nprisoner hygiene items,\" but they believe that the county has failed to properly distribute these items. See\nPlaintiff's Objections at 31. According to the plaintiffs, the ECJA no longer distributes \"hygiene packages,\" which\nnormally include toothpaste, toothbrush, soap, and a comb, to newly admitted inmates. See Plaintiffs' Response\nat 16. Some inmates have also complained about the county's failure to distribute toilet paper, soap, and\n\"personal hygiene packages.\" See Plaintiff's Objections at 31-3. Inmate representatives also \"report that it is\n`next to impossible' for indigent inmates to receive personal hygiene items when their initial amounts of\ntoothpaste and personal hygiene supplies run out\" and generally, inmates \"are unable to purchase personal\nhygiene supplies during the first several weeks they are in the Annex.\" See Plaintiffs' Response at 17. Female\ninmates have complained of the county's failure to distribute sanitary napkins.\nThe Special Master's initial report did not address these objections, but their supplemental report acknowledges\nthat some problems related to distribution may still be present. Nevertheless, they do not recommend sanctions\n\nbecause, among other things, the New Jersey Department of Corrections has recently found that the ECJ and\nECJA comply with the regulatory standard that \"each inmate be provided with ... soap, toothbrush, toothpaste or\npowder, comb, toilet paper, shaving equipment upon request, and products for the special hygiene needs of\nfemale inmates.\" Supplemental Report at Ex. B, p. 7 (copy of ECJ inspection report); Ex. C, p. 7 (copy of ECJA\ninspection report). This alone does not absolutely confirm the county's full compliance, but the court will\nnonetheless decline to order monetary sanctions. Plaintiff do not contest that there is a lack of supply and they\nhave not alleged that the county has affirmatively refused to distribute these items. Instead the court will order the\ncourt to improve distribution within fifteen days and to submit a report to confirming that it has satisfied its\nobligation.\nE. Clothing Requirements\nUnder the 2CCO, the County must provide each inmate with \"2 sets of outer garments, two sets of\nundergarments, and two sets of socks.\" See Plaintiff's Objections at 40. Fresh underwear is to be issued every\ntwo days. See Supplemental Report at 5. The plaintiffs have complained that the county has not complied with\nthe order. See Plaintiff's Objections at 40. According to the plaintiffs, \"[i]nmates are still only provided with one\nuniform and must stay in their cells all day in their underwear when their uniform is turned in for laundering.\" Id.\nThe Special Masters' initial report made no findings on this issue. Their supplemental report remarked upon the\nincrease in supply and that while they have \"no reason to disbelieve the specifics of [the inmate complaints, they]\ndo not believe that there is any longer a general problem in this area.\" Supplemental Report at 7. The\nDepartment of Corrections has concluded that the ECJ and ECJA meet their standard that all inmates be\n\"provided with clothing that is clean, climatically suitable, durable and in good condition.\" Id. at Ex. B, p. 7 (copy\nof ECJ inspection report); Ex. C, p. 7 (copy of ECJA inspection report).\nWhile the Special Masters have not conducted any \"detailed study of clothing that are needed versus the supply\nthat is on hand,\" (id. at 7), the court sees no reason to impose monetary sanctions here. In light of the findings\nmade by the Special Masters and the Department of Corrections, the court believes that monetary would only be\ncounterproductive. The county is well aware of its obligation under the 2CCO.\n456 F. Legal Access\n*456\nOne of the goals of the 2CCO was to improve access to legal materials. Thus, it requires that within the Annex,\nthe county must \"provide access to the law library at least 40 hours per week\" and upon request, each inmate is\nentitled to \"spend at least five two-hour periods a week in the law library.\" Plaintiff's Objections at 43. \"If feasible,\naccess to the law library shall be provided at the next date scheduled for law library.\" Id. Each Essex County Jail\ninmate is entitled to spend at least two hours a week in the law library. Id. at 45. With respect to the contents of its\nlibraries, the order provides that each library shall maintain an inventory with the \"full contents listed in the current\nedition of the New Jersey State Library's Recommended List of Books for Law Libraries in the New Jersey\nCounty Jails.\" Id. at 46. Finally, there must be \"one staff person ... minimally trained in the use of law books ...\nassigned responsibility to update legal materials and assist inmates to find the material they seek.\" Id. at 50. The\nplaintiffs insist that the county is grossly deficient in all areas.\nRegarding the degree of access to the facilities themselves, the plaintiffs claim that:\n00 females receive no access;\n95\n00 other annex inmates must wait two weeks to a month to get to the law library and once they are\n95\nallowed to go, their time is restricted to periods between fifteen minutes and an hour;\n00 whenever the County houses inmates in the ECJ, those inmates are not given access; and\n95\n00 Juvenile inmates are also given extremely limited access to the law library.\n95\nPlaintiff's Objections at 45.\n\nOnce again, while the county may not be in full compliance, I do not believe that monetary sanctions are\nappropriate here. As the Special Master has noted:\nThe County ... is in the midst of completing the installation of a computer-aided legal research\nsystem which will place a terminal with access to a legal CD-Rom library in each satellite of the\nAnnex. If this works as intended, it seems likely to meet the County's commitment.... [T]he new jail\nwill be designed with adequate provision for inmate law library space and usage.\nReport at 38.\nThe prisoner's difficulty in obtaining access to legal materials is directly related to overpopulation which, as I have\nalready noted, the county is making every effort to correct. Thus, for reasons already stated, the court believes\nthat at this time, sanctions would be inappropriate.\nRegarding the contents of the libraries, the Special Master believes that the new computer system will remedy\npresent concerns. However, the plaintiffs still criticize the implementation of the new system because there is only\none computer at the ECJA and only the Ombudsman for the ECJA is permitted to use it. See Plaintiff's Objections\nat 49. In addition, they claim that there is no computerized research at the ECJ. Nevertheless, I believe that it\nmakes the most sense for this court to wait until the system is fully implemented before deciding upon an award\nof sanctions. But I take this opportunity to admonish the defendants to be mindful of their responsibility under the\n2CCO.\nFinally, the inmates complain that there is no staff person to assist the inmates. As I have already noted, the\nconsent order provides that there must be \"one staff person ... minimally trained in the use of law books\" who is\n\"assigned responsibility to update legal materials and assist inmates to find the material they seek.\" Plaintiff's\nObjections at 50. The Special Masters have not addressed this concern, but I believe that in light of my findings\nabove, it is most prudent for the court to wait until the new system is implemented before making any\ndetermination regarding monetary sanctions. Moreover, in Section III(I) of this opinion, the court will order the\ncounty to implement a plan developed through an independent staffing analysis. See discussion, infra. This plan\nwill address the instant legal access issue. Thus, the court will await the independent staffing analysis and the full\nimplementation of the new system. At that time, the inmates may decide to file further motions.\n457 G. Recreation\n*457\nUnder the consent order:\nAll inmates in the ECJ and ECJA shall have the opportunity to use a gymnasium or recreation\noutside their housing units and dayrooms for a minimum of one hour each day, seven days per\nweek.\nPlaintiff's Objections at 52 (citing 2CCO).\nAt the time that it filed its objections to the Special Masters' report, plaintiffs identified a number of violations. See\nId. at 52-57. According to the plaintiffs, the ECJ never provided recreation to inmates housed in dayrooms and\nthose inmates housed on the twelfth floor. Additionally, it permitted juveniles to participate in recreation four days\nper week. In some instances, where the jail offers recreation to a particular floor, only half of that floor would be\naccommodated. At the ECJA, the county never allowed recreation to inmates housed in Satellite 2 and only\nlimited recreation to the following inmates:\n00 inmates housed in Satellite 5 (one day/week);\n95\n00 inmates housed in the Main Building, Satellites 3 and 4 (five to six days / week);\n95\n00 inmates housed in Satellite 4 (everyday but Friday);\n95\n00 inmates housed in Satellite 1 (Monday through Friday);\n95\n\nThe Special Master made no findings on this issue in its initial report, an oversight which troubled the court and\ncreated the need for a supplemental report. From the Special Masters' supplemental report, it now appears that\nthe county has made recreation substantially more accessible to the inmates.\nIn April 1998, an inspection performed by the New Jersey Department of Corrections confirmed that the ECJ\nprovides inmates with the \"opportunity to participate in a minimum of one hour of physical exercise and recreation\neach day outside the living unit.\" See Supplemental Report at Ex. B. at p. 38. The May 1998 inspection of the\nECJA concluded that the ECJA had not fully complied because some satellites only provided five days of\nrecreation. Id. at Ex. C. Notwithstanding the failure to provide access to recreation seven days per week, the\ninspection findings reflect a marked improvement over the conditions alleged by plaintiffs in their objections to the\nSpecial Master report. For instance, one can no longer argue that the county completely denies recreation to\nSatellite 2 inmates or commits some similar abuse.\nThis progress is further evidenced by several improvements to facilities since the plaintiffs filed their objections.\nThe county has \"expanded and improved\" Satellite 2's indoor and outdoor recreation areas. Specifically, the\ndefendant maintain that the new outdoor recreation facility has:\nfour half-court basketball courts and space for outdoor recreation. The indoor recreation area has\nbeen enlarged and includes weight lifting equipment, pool and pingpong tables, punching and\nspeed bags and space for passive indoor recreation.\nId. at Ex. A (copy of county's June 25, 1998 letter).\nAdditionally, Satellites 3,4, and 5 are in various states of rehabilitation. See discussion, supra at 15-16.\nNotwithstanding these improvements, plaintiffs still argue that the defendants are not in compliance with the\n2CCO. In their response to the Special Masters' report, the plaintiffs have submitted a copy of the May 1998 log\nsheets for the \"up and down gyms\" at the ECJ. See Plaintiff's Response at 13; Ex. P-1. The logs indicate that\ninmates in protective custody and inmates on the 12th floor did not use the gym in May 1998. See Id. Additionally,\nas the plaintiff has noted, \"inmates on other floors\" did not use the gym \"often.\" Id. Plaintiffs claim that this means\nthat inmates were denied access to recreation. However, that is not necessarily the case. At most, what the\nreport shows is that certain inmates did not use the gym at the ECJ during the month of May. However, in light of\nthe findings by the New Jersey Department of Corrections that the ECJ provides inmates with the \"opportunity to\nparticipate in a minimum of one hour of physical exercise and recreation each day outside the living unit,\" the\ncourt will not find that the ECJ recreation program violates the 2CCO.\n458 *458 As with the ECJ, plaintiffs still maintain that the ECJA has not complied with the ECJA. According to the\nplaintiffs, inmates representatives have stated that the ECJA continues to provide limited recreation opportunities\nto the following inmates:\n00 two hundred of the inmates in Satellite 2 (no recreation on weekdays);\n95\n00 inmates from the East and West Wing of the Main Building (no recreation on the weekends);\n95\n00 Satellite 5 inmates (no recreation on Saturdays).\n95\nSee Plaintiffs' Response at 14.\nWith the exception of the plaintiff's complaints regarding Satellite 2, plaintiff's findings are consistent with those of\nthe New Jersey Department of Corrections that ECJA only provides five days of recreation to some inmates at\nthe ECJA. With respect to Satellite 2, the court finds it difficult to believe plaintiff's claims in light of the\nDepartment of Corrections inspection and the recent expansions and improvement of Satellite 2's indoor and\noutdoor recreation areas. See discussion, supra. Perhaps there are instances where the level of access falls\nbelow that found by the inspector, but for the most part, the court believes that the Department of Corrections'\nfindings accurately characterize the prison conditions.\n\nThe Special Masters believe that recreation is directly related to the problems of overpopulation and staffing.\nCertainly, overcrowding impedes the county's ability to provide recreation opportunities and for that reason, it\nwould be consistent with this opinion for the court to excuse full compliance. See discussion, supra. That does\nnot mean that the court will ignore the recreation problem and permit the county to abandon the 2CCO. If the\nconditions were the same as those described by the plaintiffs in their objections, monetary sanctions might be\nappropriate, but here, they are unwarranted.\nIn the instant case, the county is approaching full compliance and is making efforts to ultimately satisfy the\ninmate's recreation needs. At worst, some inmates are only provided five days of recreation. Ultimately, with\nimprovements at the current site and the construction of the new jail, it is expected that there will be more than\nsufficient recreation opportunities for all inmates. Additionally, to the extent that staffing inefficiencies contribute to\nthe lack of recreation opportunity, in Section III(I) of this opinion, the court will order that the county implement a\nplan developed through an independent staffing analysis. See discussion, infra. This analysis will cover \"inmate\nactivities,\" a term which includes recreation. For the reasons already stated, the court finds that additional\nsanctions would be counterproductive and unnecessary.\nH. The Implementation of Incarceration Alternatives\nTo alleviate overcrowding, the consent decree mandates that the county investigate and adopt alternatives to\nincarceration. Plaintiffs now argue that the county has violated the consent decree by first, not establishing a\n\"substance abuse program, Turning Point/Second Chance, for pre-trial incarcerated persons detainees at the\nECJ and ECJA\" and second, by not implementing the \"Sentencing Projects' recommendations on incarceration\nalternatives `to the fullest extent necessary to bring the ECJ and the ECJA population below the caps specified\nby [the 2CCO.]'\" See Plaintiff's Objections at 60-61. Additionally, plaintiffs complain that the county has failed to\nsubmit \"a report to the Special Masters and plaintiffs on the status of the Intensive Supervision Probation\nprogram and the County's Community Program.\" Id.\nOn this issue, the Special Master concedes that the requirements of the 2CCO are not being met. See Special\nMasters' Supplemental Report at 13. In the past, the county operated many alternative programs, but currently is\nonly involved in a program called \"Second Choice,\" formerly known as S.L.A.P. S.L.A.P. is:\nan early work-release program for sentenced prisoners under the supervision of the Sheriff's\noffice. There are presently approximately 25 prisoners in this program. When fully implemented,\n459 the program should accommodate 125 prisoners. Those admitted to the program are sentenced \n*459 prisoners who are released early from the Jail or the Annex to a work program. This is an\nalternative to incarceration of the type sought by plaintiffs. Report at 23.\nAccording to the Special Masters, the county's position is that \"it is unwilling, for reasons of public safety and \nrealpolitik, to make more vigorous use of non-custodial programs.\" Supplemental Report at 14. Notwithstanding\nthe county's refusal to operate these programs, the Special Master have not recommended that the court impose\nsanctions because for the reasons related to the underlying theme of its report on the issue of overcrowding,\nthe county's commitment to a new jail changes the previously contemptuous nature of the county's\nconduct regarding alternatives to incarceration.... Habitable conditions of confinement are certainly\nrequired, but equity does not require that alternatives to incarceration, as opposed to new\nconstruction, be employed as the means of permanently achieving that necessary goal.\nSupplemental Report at 15.\nFor the most part, the court adopts the position taken by the Special Masters. Through a number of efforts which\nmostly include construction and rehabilitation of facilities, but also involve the operation of \"Second Choice,\" the\ncounty is employing methods to reduce overcrowding. It is anticipated that through the county's impressive\nefforts, the new jail will eliminate overcrowding. The court is loath to either impose its own notions of enlightened\npolicy upon the county like a \"roving commission\" or to unnecessarily usurp the authority of the county. See \n\nUnion County Jail Inmates v. Di Buono, 713 F.2d 984 (3d Cir.1983). With that in mind, the court finds that it make\nno sense to purposefully thwart the county's initiative.\nI. Staffing and Classification\na. Staffing\nAmongst all of the county's transgressions alleged by the plaintiff, the Special Masters expressed the most\nconcern over staffing. When a prison is confronted with the dual problem of overcrowding and inadequate\nstaffing, the Special Master believes, this \"creates many dangers to both inmates and the staff' such as \"intra-\ninmate violence, sex or intimidation, failures to observe prisoners who are ill or in distress so that appropriate\nmedical attention can be obtained in a timely manner, and increased danger of violence directed at the\ncorrections officers.\" Report at 32. Unquestionably, inadequate staffing of prisons may cause harm that reaches\nconstitutional proportions. For that reason, the Special Master recommended that the court order the defendant\nto:\nobtain and submit to plaintiffs' counsel an independent, professional staffing analysis for three\nareas of [prison] operations: security staffing and training, classification, and inmate activities.\nReport at 34-36.\nThis analysis:\nshall address staff training, staff coverage, classification, inmate activity, intake population, and\ncorrections operations. The staffing analysis shall review current authorized staffing, vacancies,\nposition descriptions, salaries, classification, and workload. The analysis shall try to maximize the\nuse of properly classified and trained inmate workers where appropriate. The analysis shall take\ninto account the requirements of this Agreement with respect to health, safety, and food service as\nit impacts on the work of corrections or civilian staff.\nId.\nThe Special Masters also recommended that the defendants be ordered to \"implement the plan.\" See Report at\n34-36. Finally, the Special Master has recommended that the\ncourt impose a fine of $100,000, but that the collection of the fine should be suspended until June\n30, 1998, and that if the County demonstrates that it has retained the necessary expert by that\ndate and has the study underway that it be further suspended for a reasonable time to permit\ncompletion of the study. Upon full compliance with the requirements, [the Special Master]\nrecommend[ed] that the fine be forgiven.\nReport at 36.\n460 *460 Plaintiffs' only objection to this recommendation is that it believes that the recommendation does not compel\nthe county to implement the independent plan. However, that impression is mistaken because as the foregoing\nindicates, the Special Master did indeed recommend that the court order such a requirement. Thus, I will adopt\nthe Special Master's recommendation with one exception. I will suspend the collection of the fine until October\n[2]\n31, 1998.\nb. Classification\nIn their objections, the plaintiffs have complained that the Special Master has not addressed the classification\nissue. Plaintiffs devote seventeen pages to the county's failure to adopt the classification provisions required by\nthe 2CCO. According to the plaintiff, defendants have not complied with the consent decree by:\n\n00 failing to classify and house inmates in general population and special use housing;\n95\n00 failing to separate violent inmates from vulnerable inmates;\n95\n00 failing to separately house sex offenders and inmates with mental health problems apart from\n95\nother inmates;\n00 failing to establish a separate housing area for the intake and reception of inmates;\n95\n00 failing to separately house newly admitted inmates until the inmates are medically cleared;\n95\n00 improperly using detention cells to house inmates in need of medical attention or inmates in\n95\nneed of psychiatric observation;\n00 failing to maintain a special needs housing unit for inmates in need of observation or close\n95\ncustody, e.g. suicidal inmates.\nSee Plaintiff's Objections at 8-25.\nPlaintiffs allege that these classification problems are \"extremely dangerous\" and may infringe upon the Eight\nAmendment right to be free of cruel and unusual punishment. See Id. at 21 (citing Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S.\n825, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994)).\nIn its initial report, the Special Masters' treatment of the classification issue was scant. It now appears that the\ncounty is implementing a plan known as the \"County Correctional Information System Objective Jail Classification\nSystem.\" See Supplemental Report at 12. Apparently, the New Jersey Correctional Authorities modeled this\nsystem after one developed by the National Institute of Corrections. See Id. The system will:\nstandardize the classification of both pretrial and sentenced inmates and will allow jail\nadministrators of participating counties to take maximum advantage of secure bedspace and\nprogram slots by quickly identifying those offenders best suited for the appropriate security level.\nThrough the use of a standardized and uniform scoring and evaluation process among all the\ncounties, offenders transferred from one jail to another will have the same date collected, with the\nsame definitions, which will facilitate the identification intake and assignment process at the\nreceiving jail.\nId. at Ex. E (copy of letter from County Counsel to plaintiff and Special Masters).\nThe county claims that it has begun operating the program at the ECJ and intends on implementing the program\nsystemwide, including the ECJ, by January 1, 1999. However, the plaintiffs are still not satisfied.\nPlaintiffs complain that the Special Masters have not indicated how the new plan will house inmates and thus,\nthey have renewed the objections raised previously. See discussion, supra. Essentially, they maintain that the\ninmates remain in \"grave danger\" because the new plan does not provide for separate housing of the different\ntypes of inmates. For example, by not separating newly admitted inmates, disciplinary detention inmates,\n461 protective custody inmates, *461 mentally ill inmates, and medically needy inmates as required by the 2CCO, the\ncounty has permitted a dangerous mix of inmates. Plaintiffs cite several violations of the 2CCO. This includes the\nallegation that the county has not complied with state regulations regarding classification and housing of inmates.\nSee Plaintiff's Response at 9.\nThe plaintiffs' allegations are seriousness enough to warrant contempt sanctions. Nevertheless, sanctions are not\nappropriate yet. In Section III(I) of this opinion, the court has ordered an independent staffing analysis to be\nconducted which will address \"staff training, staff coverage, classification, inmate activity, intake population, and\ncorrections operations.\" See, Discussion, supra at 25-27 (emphasis added). This independent analysis must\ninclude practices for classifying and housing inmates throughout the prison system. For that reason, the court\nbelieves it most prudent to wait until the independent analysis is performed before it decides whether to impose\ncontempt sanctions.\n\nThe inmates have raised some genuine concerns regarding the housing of inmates under the new classification\nsystem which the Special Masters have not addressed. The court cannot ignore its obligation to ensure\ncompliance with the 2CCO, but it will await the release of the independent staffing analysis. However, it will order\nthat the independent staffing analysis include an evaluation of the county's \"County Correctional Information\nSystem Objective Jail Classification System.\" Until an independent analysis is conducted which either approves\nor disapproves of the classification plan, the court need not consider whether the plan satisfies the 2CCO.\nIV. The Impact of the PLRA upon Plaintiff's Contempt Application\nIn adopting the Special Master's recommendation and enforcing the 2CCO, the court is mindful of the fact that\nthrough the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\"), Congress has effected a revolution in prison litigation. See 18\nU.S.C. ยง 3626. Congress has expressed its desire to \"end perceived ongoing micromanagement of state and\nlocal prisons systems by federal courts.\" See Taylor v. United States, 143 F.3d 1178, 1998 WL 214578, *3 (9th\nCir.1998). Thus, while the court finds that the PLRA does not affect the instant contempt application, some\nexplanation is necessary.\nSection 3626(a) of the PLRA provides:\nProspective relief in any civil action with respect to prison conditions shall extend no further than\nnecessary to correct the violation of the Federal right of a particular plaintiff or plaintiffs. The court\nshall not grant or approve any prospective relief unless the court finds that such relief is narrowly\ndrawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the\nleast intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right.\n18 U.S.C. ยง 3626(a).\nThe most controversial section of the PLRA, ยง 3626(b), entitles \"any party or intervener\" in this type of prison\nlitigation to seek immediate termination of any \"prospective relief\" which has been previously ordered. The\nsection applies to those orders entered before the enactment of the PLRA. However, such prospective relief:\nshall not terminate if the court makes written findings based on the record that prospective relief\nremains necessary to correct a current and ongoing violation of the Federal right, extends no\nfurther than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and that the prospective relief is\nnarrowly drawn and the least intrusive means to correct the violation.\nId.\nThe PLRA defines \"prospective relief\" as \"all relief other than compensatory monetary damages.\" Id. at ยง 3626(g)\n(7). Relief means \"all relief in any form that my be granted or approved by the court, and includes consent\ndecrees ....\" Id. at ยง 3626(g)(9).\nMost courts have construed 3626(b) to mean that once the defendants, plaintiffs, or intervenor shows their\nentitlement to terminate prospective relief under the act, the court must terminate the actual consent decree\n462 which has been previously entered. See Taylor, supra; but see, Benjamin v. Jacobson,*462 124 F.3d 162, 167\n(2d Cir.1997) (act terminates jurisdiction to enforce past consent decree, but not decree itself). Section 3626(b)\nmay potentially have a dramatic impact upon prison litigation because it will allow prisons to evade terms of the\nconsent decrees which were entered prior to the PLRA. Before the enactment of the PLRA, courts permitted\nparties to settle disputes over constitutional violations by entering into consent decrees that imposed\nrequirements exceeding constitutional levels. See Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County, 502 U.S. 367, 389, 112\nS.Ct. 748, 116 L.Ed.2d 867 (1992) (\"almost any affirmative decree beyond a directive to obey the Constitution\nnecessarily\" exceeds what is compelled by the Constitution); Kindred v. Duckworth, 9 F.3d 638, 641 (7th\nCir.1993) (consent decrees often embody outcomes that reach beyond basic constitutional protections). That is\nwhat occurred here and in numerous other prison litigations.\n\nThrough the PLRA, Congress now prohibits parties from entering enforceable consent decrees which exceed\nconstitutional requirements. The impact of the PLRA is magnified by the fact that, upon a motion by any of the\nparties, the court may terminate consent decrees similar to that in the instant case. That is a marked change.\nHowever, in the instant case, neither a party nor an intervenor has moved to terminate the underlying consent\n[3]\ndecree and thus, the court need not apply ยง 3626(b).\nWhile 3626(b) does not apply here, one might argue, albeit incorrectly, that ยง 3626(a) limits the court's ability to\nenforce the 2CCO. This court does not share that view because the court's inherent contempt power remains\nunaffected by ยง 3626(a). The enforcement of a valid consent decree is not the kind of \"prospective relief\"\nconsidered by ยง 3626(a). As long as the underlying consent order remains valid 00 neither party has made a 3626\n97\n(b) motion to terminate 00 the court must be able to enforce it. See Komyatti v. Bayh, 96 F.3d 955 (7th Cir.1996).\n97\nThe court draws some support for this position from Carty v. Farrelly, 957 F.Supp. 727 (D.V.I.1997).\nNotwithstanding the PLRA, the district court in Carty held the defendant in contempt of the consent decree. The\ndefendants had initially moved to terminate the consent decree, but then withdrew the motion. Because ยง 3626(b)\nhad not been invoked, the court did not need to consider the validity of the underlying consent decree. The court\nthen went ahead and ruled upon the contempt application. While the court does not specifically mention ยง 3626\n(a), there is no question that it was well aware of the statute's existence. Carty implicitly held that the PLRA did\nnot limit its ability to exercise its contempt power. Similarly, I do not believe that this action constitutes\n\"prospective relief\" because it does nothing more than enforce the provision of a prior order of this court which\nremains valid.\nThat ยง 3626(a) has no application here is further confirmed by an examination of the act itself. If ยง 3626(a)\nrendered an underlying consent decree unenforceable, that would make ยง 3626(b) superfluous. If a court\ninterpreted ยง 3626(a) as effectively limiting a previously entered consent decree, there would be no need for a\nparty to file a motion to terminate under ยง 3626(b). Because the Third Circuit has commanded that lower courts\n463 interpret statutes to \"avoid a construction of a statute that renders any provision *463 superfluous,\" I find 3626(a)\ninapplicable here. See United States v. Higgins, 128 F.3d 138, 141 (3d Cir.1997); Pennsylvania Department of\nPublic Welfare v. United States Department of Health and Human Services, 928 F.2d 1378, 1385 (3d Cir.1991).\nV. Plaintiff's Recent Letter\nIn their July 21, 1998 letter, the plaintiff alleges other areas of noncompliance. Specifically, plaintiffs contend that:\n1. inmates do not receive regular fire drills;\n2. some female inmates must sleep on the floor;\n3. the county continues to house inmates in the dayrooms;\n4. many inmates do not receives towels or sheets;\n5. inmates are provided with only one blanket;\n6. inmates are not provided with pillows or pillow cases;\n7. inmates have only one uniform and are not provided with undergarments or socks;\n8. inmates do not receive adequate amounts of toilet paper;\n9. female inmates do not receive adequate amounts of sanitary napkins;\n10. newly-admitted and indigent inmates are unable to get personal hygiene supplies;\n11. inmates in the ECJ and ECJA do not receive visitation on the requisite number of days;\n12. food sometimes runs out, and food portions are too small;\n\n13. shower temperatures at the ECJ are often scalding hot or freezing cold;\n14. inmates are not given adequate amounts of cleaning supplies;\n15. inmates on the third and 8/9 floor of the ECJ do not receive any dayroom time.\nSome of these items have already been addressed. See discussion, supra, (covering items 3,7,8,9,10,11,13).\n[4]\nThe other items were not addressed in the plaintiffs's objections to the Special Master.  To the extent that\nplaintiffs have now raised issues which were not addressed in their objections, it is not appropriate for the court to\nconsider them at this time. Plaintiffs should have made these objections previously.\nVI. Conclusion\nFor reasons detailed above, the court orders the following:\n1. plaintiff's request for monetary contempt sanctions is partially DENIED;\n2. defendants:\na. must obtain and submit to plaintiffs' counsel an independent, professional staffing analysis for\nthree areas of [prison] operations: security staffing and training, classification, and inmate\nactivities;\nb. the analysis shall address staff training, staff coverage, classification, inmate activity, intake\npopulation, and corrections operations.

However, the court has no reason to\ndisbelieve the county's representations that it will perform the work by the end of the year.\n[2] In a recent letter, the plaintiffs have complained that the county has yet to submit a staffing analysis and\ntherefore, have not complied with the Special Master's June 30, 1998 dateline. Because I have now ordered the\ndefendants to comply with its order by October 31, 1998, plaintiff's point is moot.\n\n[3] It is worth noting that there have been several challenges to the validity ยง 3626(b) arguing that it violates the\nseparation of powers doctrine. The majority of circuits have held it to be constitutional. See Hadix v. Johnson, 133\nF.3d 940, 942 (6th Cir .1998); Dougan v. Singletary, 129 F.3d 1424, 1426 (11th Cir.1997); Inmates of Suffolk\nCounty Jail v. Rouse, 129 F.3d 649, 657 (1st Cir.1997); Gavin v. Branstad, 122 F.3d 1081, 1088-89 (8th Cir.1997);\nPlyler v.

Only the Ninth Circuit has found that ยง 3626(b) violates the separation of\npowers doctrine. See Taylor, supra. The Third Circuit has not addressed this issue, but the district courts have\nsplit on this issue. See Imprisoned Citizens Union v. Shapp, 1998 WL 220957 (E.D.Pa.1998) (finding ยง 3626 to\nbe constitutional); Denike v. Fauver, 3 F.Supp.2d 540 (D.N.J. 1998) (finding ยง 3626 unconstitutional under the\nseparation of powers doctrine).\n[4] In their objections to the Special Masters' Report, plaintiffs covered nine areas: classification, staffing, hygiene\nitems, showers, clothing requirements, legal access, recreation, visitation, alternatives to incarceration.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

This  is  a  class  action  brought by  the inm. .: tes of  the  Essex \nCounty  Jail in  Newark,  New  Jersey on  behalf of all persons who  are now  or \nwho  will be committed  to  confinement at that facility,  either in  the  status of \npretrial detainees  awaiting  disposition  of criminal charges  in  the courts of \nEssex  County,  or in  the  status of  those  sentenced  to  terms of imprisonment  in \nthe  jail by the New  Jersey  Superior Court,  or by the municipal courts in  the \nmunicipalities  of Essex  County,  or those  sentenced to imprisonment in  the New \nJersey  State Prisons  or the  New  Jer'sey  State  Youth  Reformatory  Complex, \n\n----- ------\nwho  are  confined  Essex  County  Jail  awaiting  transfer  to  the state  prison \nill \nsystem. \nPlaintiffs  contend that  the  Essex  County Jail is  overpopulated, \nresulting in  an  atmosphere of  tension,  fear  and hostility,  and  interfering with \nsupervision,  protection and provision  of housing,  living  space,  necessities \nand services  to  the members  of  the  plaintiff  class.  Plairltiffs  further contend \nthat the  totality  of  conditions  resulting  from  the overcrowding at  the  Essex \nCounty  Jail,  particularly the inadequate  provision for living space,  sanitary \nfacilities,  classification,  visitation,  exercise and  recreation  inflicts  needless \nprivation,  suffering and  hardship  on  inmates,  creates  an  environment  which \nthreatens  the  inmates'  physical  and mental weil-being,  and  results  in  the \nunnecessary  deterioration  of  the  physical  and mental states of those confined \nthere.  Plaintiffs  further contend  that  these  conditions  and  other practices or \npoliCies  violate  the  plairltiff  class's  right  to  due  process of law,  to  equal \nprotection  of  the  laws,  and  to  be free  from  cruel  and unusual  punishment. \nPlaintiffs  seek  an  order reducing  the  population  confined in  the \nEssex  County  ,Tail  and/or  requiring  the  officials  of  Essex  County  or the New \nJersey  Department of  Corrections  to  afford additional appropriate  housing for \nthose  who must be  confined under their authority,  and  such other relief as \nthe  Court may  deem  appropriate  to  redress plaintiffs  rights  under the Fifth, \nSixth,  Eighth,  Ninth  and Fourteenth  Amendments  to  the  COI'stitution  of  the \nUnited  States. \nJURISDICTION \n2.  This  Court has  jurisdiction under  28  U. S. C _ Sections 1343  (3) \n_ and 1343  (4).  Plaintiffs'  request  for  declaratory  relief is  authorized by  28 \nU. S . C.  Sections  2201  and  2202. \n-2-\n\n3.  This  suit  is  authorized  by  42  U. S . C.  Section  1983  to  redress \nthe  deprivation  under  color  of  state  law  of  rights,  privileges  and  immuniti,ยทs \nsecured  by  the  Fifth,  Sixth,  Eighth,  Ninth  and Fourteenth  Amendments  to  the \nConstitution  of the  United  States. \n4.

These individuals include \npersons  confined for  an  extended period of  time  in  areas of the Essex  County \nJail not designed or equipped for housing  (e. g.,  the  day rooms  on  the  second, \nthird,  fifth,  seventh,  ninth,  eleventh,  and twelfth floors),  persons confined \nfor  an  extended period of  time  in  areas  so  crowded that daytime  floor space \nfor  activities  is  virtually  non-existent and only narrow walkways  between \nbunks,  cots  or mattresses  exist,  persons  compelled for an  extended period of \ntime  to  sleep  in  these  areas  on  cots,  on  cot  frames  withou t  mattresses,  or on \n-3-\n\nmattresses  placed on  the  floor,  or  directly  on  concrete  floors  or tables \nwithout mattresses,  all essentially  because  of  an  insufficiency  of  beds \n0,' \nspace  for  as  many  beds  as. are  needed  to  accomodate  a  population of more \nthan  550  individuals  in  the Jail.  These individuals  also  include  inmates  in \nother areas  of  the  Jail who  have been  or are compelled to endure  the \nconditions  in  the  dayrooms  and  dormitories,  either directly by once having \nbeen  housed  there  or through  the impact of overcrowding on  the  services or \nactivities  available  at  the Jail. \n7.  Samuel Brown  is  a  23  year old  citizen  of the United States \nconfined  at  the  Essex  County  Jail  since December 28,  1981  on  criminal charges \npending  against  him  in  Superior  Court.  He  is  held in lieu of bail of  $1000. \nAt  the  Jail,  he  is  assigned  to  the  Southside Dormitory on  the second floor  of \nthe  Jail,  as  described in  paragraphs  37  to  49  below;  he has  been  confined in \nthis  area for  approximately  five  months.  He  sleeps  on  a  double bunk and hGS \nshares  the  dormitory  with  as many  as  90  to  100  other inmates;  as many  as  25 \nof  these  inmates  are at  times  forced  to  sleep on  the floor,  some  without  a \nmattress  and  with  only  a  blanket.  Virtually  the only remaining floor  space i.'l \nthe  dorm  is  the narrow walkways  between  bunks.  There are only five  toilets \nin  the  dorm  area,  several of  which  are often  inoperable;  there are also only \nfour  urinals,  only  two  of which  work;  there  are only two  showers,  one  of \nwhich is  often  broken;  there  are  ten  Sinks,  of which only fuur  or five  work. ยท \nThese  sanitary f,,!cilities  must be  shared by all  the inmates  in the  dorm.  He  is \nconfined in  the  dorm  area  with  all  the other  inmates  assigned  to  it for \napproximately  20  hours  a  day;  for  the  other four hours  he and  the inmates \nfrom  his  dorm  are  given  access  to  the  dayroom  as  described in paragraphs 42 \nto  43  (for  two  \"activity\"  periods  of 1\\ hours,  one  during the day  and one in \nthe  evening,  and  for  three  20  minute meal periods).  When  moved into  the \n-4-\n\ndayroom,  he  is  locked  in  it  and is  not free  to  move  between  day room  and \ndorm.  With  other  inmates  in  his  dorm,  Brown  is  permitted  access  to  the Jail's \nrecreation  and library  area  only  one  day  a  week,  for  a  scheduled  period  of \napproximately 1\\  hours  either  from  9  a .m.  to  10:30 a.m.  or 1:00 p.m.  to  2:30 \np. m. ,  which  is  the  time  he  otherwise  would  be  locked  in  the  dayroom.  The \nscheduled  recreation  period  is  actually  shortened  considerably  because of time \nnecessary  to move  the large  number  of  inmates  during  each  recreation  or \nlibrary  period,  resulting in  as  little  as  30  to  40  minutes  of actual time \nregularly  available  for  the  activity  during  each  week.  He  is permitted  only \none  visit a  day,  six  days  a  week;  due  to  the  demand  on  visiting time by  the \nnumbers  of inmates  at the  Jail,  his  visits  have been  regularly  as  short as  five \nor  ten minutes.  He  is  only  permitted  use of  the  telephone  twice  a  day  and \nhis  calls  are limited  to  three  minutes .  The  food  he  is  served  is  often \nstarchy,  cold,  only  partly  cooked,  and of  insufficient portions.  His  personal \nclothing  is  never  laundered  by  the Jail. \n8.  John  Sly  is  a  39  year  old  citizen  of the  United  States  confined at \nthe  Essex  Covnty  Jail awaiting  transf-:r  to  state  prison.

He  is  assigned  for  sleeping quarters  to  the  dayroom  on the  second floor \nof  the  Jail;  previously  he  had  been  assigned to  the  Northside  Dormitory on \nthe  second floor.  For  almost  two  weeks  he  had  to  sleep on  the floor without \na  mattress,  after. which  time  he  was  issued  a  cot.  His  cot is  provided about \n11  p. m.  and  removed at  5  a. m. ,  after  which  time  he  is forced  to  sleep with \nonly  a  blanket on  the  concrete floor.  There is  only  one toilet and one  sink \nfor  all the inmates  in  the  second floor day room .  The day room  becomes  so \ncrowded  that there is  no  room  to  walk  around  and he  must climb over a  table \nor over other inmates  to  move  around.  He  has  seen  roaches  crawling on  the \n-5-\n\nwalls  and  floors  of  the  day room.  When  inmates  on  his  floor  take their meals \nthei'e  are  not  enough  seats  in  the  dayroom;  inmates  regularly  must  stand  up \nto  eat,  or sit down  on  the  floors,  placing  their trays on  the floors  as  well.  In \nall other respects,  although  confined  in  another  area of ,the  Jail,  he is  held \nIII \nconc!itons  essentially  the  same  as  those  described in  paragraph  7. \n9.

He  is  locked in  his  cell for  approximately  17  hours  every day.  For three \nhours  he  has  access  to  the tier corridor of his  cellblock which he  shares  with \nthe 12  other inmates  from  his  tier and other  inmates who  at  night are  housed \nin  the  day room  but who  are  confined on  the  tier  corridors  during the  day. \nFor four hours  (two 1':;  hour \"dayroom\"  periods  and  three  approximately  20 \nminute  periods  for meais),  he 1S  permitted  accp.ss  to  a  small  dayroom  as \ndescribed  in  paragraph 58.  With  the  number of inmates  who  share the \nday room ,  it provides even  less  space per inmate  than  does  his  cell;  during \nthe  time  when  he  is  allowed in  the  dayroom,  he is locked in it and is  not free \nto move between  the  dayroom  and either  his  cell or the  tier corridor.  He  is \npermitted access  to  the Jail's  recreation  and library area one  day  a  week,  for \na  scheduled  period of approximately  1':;  hours  either from  9  a.m.  to 10:30 a.m. \nor 1:00 p.m.  to  2:30  p.m. ,  which  is  the  time  he otherwise would be locked in \nthe  day room  or be allowed  on  the  tier corridor.  The scheduled  recreation \nperiod,  however,  is  actually  shortened considerably because of the time \nrequired  to  move  the large  number of inmates  to  the  recreation or library \n-6-\n\nareas,  resulting in  as  little  as  only  30  to  40  minutes  to  a  maximum  of  60  to  70 \nminLltes  of actual  time  available  for  the  activity  during each  week.  He  is \npermitted  only  one  visit  a  day ,  six  days  a  week;  due  to  the  demand 011 \nvisiting'  time  by  the numbers  of inmates  at  the  Jail,  his  visits  have been as \nshort as  seven  or eight minutes.  He  has  requested  to  be placed on  sick call \nfor  several weeks  without  seeing a  doctor.  His  personal clothing items  are \nnever laundered  by the  Jail.  He  receives  a  clean  towel only  once  a  week and \nhis  sheets  are  laundered once  a  week;  his  blanket,  however,  is  not \nlaundered.  He  is  only permitted use  of  the  telephone  twice  a  day  for  calls of \nonly  three minutes.  The  plumbing equipment in  his  cell and on  his  tier is  or \nhas  been faulty,  with  dirty  water often  coming  out of faucets  and with  water \nbacking up  in  drains  and flooding cells  due  to  clogged  drains  or leaking \nshowers  and  sinks.  He  has  seen  infestation  in  the  cells,  tiers,  or dayrooms \nby mice,  nests of  roaches,  and lice. \n10.

The  class  represented by  plaintiffs \nherein is  so  numerous  that  joinder of all members  is  impractical;  there are \nquestions  of law  and fact  common  to  the  class ,  claims of the representatives \nherein  are  typical of the  claims  of the  class,  and  representative  parties herein \n\\\\i-jJl  fairly  and  adequately  protect  the  interests of  the class.  The defendants \nhave  acted  or refused  to  act on  the  grounds  generally applicable  to  the class, \nthereby making appropriate final  declaratory  and injunctive relief with  respect \nto  the class  as  a  whole.

A  class  action  determination  will  avoid the possibility of \ninconsistent  or varying adjudications  with  respect to individual members  of \nthe  class  establishing incompatible  standards of conduct for the  defendants . \n. Since  a  majority  of  the members  of  the  class  are indigents,  mits by individual \nmembers would m.o st likely be brought pro  se with  all the  attendant \n--\ndifficulties of such litigation. \n26.  Plaintiffs'  attorneys  are associated \",i.th  the Office of Inmate \nAdvocacy  of  the New Jersey Office  of  the  Public Defender.

The  jail and  its  commercial  services  (i.e.,  laundry  and \nkitchen)  occupy  the  entire thirteen floor structure.  Secure movement from \nthe  Jail to  the  County  Courthouse is  facilitated  by an underground  tunnel \nwhich  connects  the  two  structures. . \n3D.  Although  the  Jail was  completed in 1970,  it's  physical plant has \ndeteriorated.  with  crumbling  ceilings.  faultly  plumbing.  and leaks  in  the  roof. \nPerhaps  more  important,  the Jail continues  to  suffer from  its  poor \narchitectural design  which  had failed  to  provide  areas for recreation,  program \nspace,  a  library,  administrative offices,  and security  statior.s.  In addition, \nplans for  ventilation were inadequate  to  prevent substantial discomfort  among \ninmates  confined in  the Jail  during the  high  temperatures  and humidity  levels \nduring Newark  summers. \n3!.  As  a  result of  the original poor  design,  areas  which  were \nplanned for  housing and other uses  have  been  renovated to  provide  space  for \nadministrative offices,  security  stations.  attorney  visits,  counseling,  a \ngymnasium,  a  chapel,  and  a  library , \n-14-\n\nHousing  and  Living  Space \n32.  The  ECJ  has  sufficient  living  and  sleeping quarters  to  proviC:;e \nhousing for  a  maximum  of  550  inmates .  For  an  extended  period of  time,  the \nECJ  regularly has  housed  over  700  inmates.  Substantially over 200  of  these \ninmates  have been  sentenced to  state  prison  terms  and are  awaiting  transfer \nto  the  custody  of  Defendant Commissioner Fauver.  The  remaining 400  to  500 \ninmates  are detainees  awaiting  disposition  of  criminal charges. \n33.  At  the ECJ,  inmates  are ordinarily housed in both  cells  and \ndormitory  units.  Under normal housing patterns,  approximately eighty percent \nof  inmates  at the  Jail  are  housed one  each  in  the 456  general population  cells \nat  the  Jail,  with  only  94  inmates  housed  in  multiple occupancy or dormitory \nunits.  As  a  result of  overcrowding,  substantially over two  hundred inmates \nare now  housed in  dormitory  type  living units  by either being crowded  into \nthe regular  dorms  or  by  being housed  in  the  dayrooms  on  the second,  third, \nfifth,  seventh,  ninth,  eleventh,  and  twelfth  floors  of  the ECJ. \n34.  At  normal  population  levels  housing for 550  inmates  is  provided \nas  follOWS,  with  the  specific  areas  desc,ibed  in  subs\"quent pangraphs'  456 \ninmates  in  general population  cells  on  the  third through  eleventh floors;  39 \ninmates  in  each  of  the  two  second floor  dormitory  units;  10  inmates  in  the \ntwelfth  floor  \"civil area\"  unit;  3  inmates  in  the  twelfth floor  \"tiermen\"  dorm \narea;  and one  inmate in  each of  the  three  twelfth floor  \"qui,.,t\"  cells.  This \narrangment  does ,not  contemplate  use  of  the  hospital donn or detention  cells  as \nregular housing units. \n35.  The  456  general population  cells  at  the jail are arranged in \ncellblocks on  the  third  through  eleventh  floors.  Each floor  is  divided  into \ntwo  cellblocks,  one on  the Northside  and  one  on  the  Southside.  Each  of the \ntwo  cellblocks  contain  a  front  and back  tier of cells  separated by  a  plumbing \nchase  at  the  rear of  the  cells  to  allow  for  repairs  to  the plumbing  without \nen tering  the  cells. \n-15-\n\n36.  Each  of  the 456  general population  cells  house  one  inmate.  All \nof  these  cells measure approximately  five  feet  wide  by  seven  feet  deep  by \neight feet  in height,  thereby  providing  approximately  35  square feet  of  cell \nspace.  All  the  cells  are  windowless,  <lre  constructed of metal  or  concrete \nwalls  and  concrete floors  and fronts  of  steel  bars.  Each  cell  contains  a  metal \nbunk  attached to  the wall,  topped with  a  mattress,  and a  lavatory  unit \nprojecting out from  the  rear wall  which  consists  of an open  toilet and  sink. \nThese  furnishings  reduce  available  cell floor  space to  approximately 17~ square \nfeet.  The cells  open on  to  a  narrow  barred corridor approximately  5  feet \nwide  running  the  length  of  the  tier. \nThe  Second Floor \n37.  The  two  general population  dorms  used  for inmate housing  are \nlocated on  the  second floor.  Due  to  overcrowdh,g,  each  second floor \ndormitory  unit is  used  to  house  as many  as  75  or 80  inmates.  As  many  as  30 \nto  40  additional inmates  are  regularly  housed in  the  second  floor  day room  as \ndescribed. in paragraphs  44  to  49.  At  ordinary  population levels  providing \nonly  60  square feet of  space  per inmate  (including space consumed  by \nfurnishings),  the  dormitories  each  could  accomodate only  39  individuals. \n38.  The  dorms  each measure  approximately 35 feet  by  65  feet,  with \na 'small area measuring approximately  five  feet  square being  consumed by  a \nshaft in  the  cent~r of  the  dorm,  resulting in  an  area of  2355  square feet for \neach  dorm.  When  80  inmates  are housed in  each  dorm,  each  inmate has \napproximately  29  square feet of  space  (including space actually  consumed by \nthe  bunks  and other furnishings  in  the  dorm  area). \n39.  For approximately  20  to  21  hours  a  day,  inmates housed in  the \nsecond  floor  dorms  are  locked in  these  dormitory  units. \n-16-\n\n40.  Each  dormitory  contains  the  following  sanitary equipment:  ten \nsinks,  five  toilets)  four  urinals )  and  three  showers .  Many  of  these  s<=-tnitar:/ \nfacilities  are  repeatedly  rendered inoperable  due  to  overuse  resulting from \novercrowding in  the  dormitory  units. \n41.  Due  to  the  sheer numbers of  people  who  are  housed  in  the \nECJ,  defendants  are  unable  to  provide  standard bunks  with  mattresses  to  as \nmany  as  25  to  35  inmates  assigned  to  each  second  floor  dormitory;  these \ninmates must  sleep  on  cots or  on  mattresses  placed on  the floor.  A  substantial \nnumber  of  inmates  for  extended periods  of  times  are  forced  to  sleep  without \nmattresses on  the  cot frames  or  even  directly  on  the floor  with only  a  blanket. \n42.  For approximately  three  to  four  hours  a  day  (two ll;;  hour \n\"activity\"  periods  and  three  20  minute  periods  for  meals),  second  floor inmates \nassigned to  the  dorms  have  access  to  the  second  floor  dayroom;  while in  the \ndayroom  they  are  locked  in;  they  cannot move  freely  between  day room  and \ndorm. \n43.  The  day room  on  the  second  floor  measures  approximately 36 \nfeet  by  33l;;  fe\"t,  providing  ?p1)roximately 1206  square feet.  Tt  contai,.,s  six \nconcrete  tables with  benches  capable of  seating  eight people  per table,  two \nopen unshielded  toilets  without  seats,  and one television  set.  As  many  as  80 \nto  90  inmates may  share the  dayroom  space  during  the  daily  periods  when \neach  dorm  has  access  to  the  dayroom;  in  such circumstances,  inmates  may \nhave as little  as l3  to 15  square feet  per person  (which includes  space consumed \nby  tables  and other items  in  the  dayroom).  There are  always  more inmates \nthan  space at  the  tables,  so  many  inmates  only  can idle on  the  floor.  As  a \nresult,  floor  space  is  virtually  unavailable with  such crowding.  The  two \n- toilets  often  are  rendered inoperable  from overuse.  Due  to  the presence of \nthis many  inmates  in  such  a  small area,  the  noise level  often  is  so loud  as  to \nbe  painful,  and of  such  volume  as  to  render  normal  conversation  difficult  or \nimpossible. \n-17-\n\n44.  Due  to  the  numbers of  people  held  at  the  EC-l,  the  second \nfloor  day room  is  also  used  regularly  for  sleeping quarters  for inmates.  As \nmany  as  30  to  40  inmates  may  be  housed  in  this  area,  which  provides only  the \nlimited  sanitary facilities  (two  often  inoperable  open  toilets)  desct'ibed  m \nparagraph 43. \n45.  Inmates  housed in  the  dayroom  do  not have bunks,  but are \nforced  to  sleep  on  cots,  some  without mattresses;  the cots are issued at II \np.m.  and  removed  at 5  a.m.  With  30  to  40  inmates  sleeping on  cots,  virtually \nno  floor  space  remains.  Inmates  must  walk over one another to  reach  a  table \nor use  the  toilet.  Inmates  desiring to  sleep  beyond  5  a.m.  when  the cots  are \nremoved must  sleep  either directly  on  the concrete floors  or on  the concrete \ntables  on  which  they  and other inmates  also  must  eat.  Most  of  the inmates \nassigned  to  the  dayroom  sleep  in  this  manner from  5  a.m.  to 6  a.m.  and  again \nfrom  7  a.m.  to  9  a.m. \n46.  In  order  to  facilitate  the  feeding  of  dorm inmates  away  from \ntheir housing  area,  inmates  housed in  the  second  floor  dayroom  are split in \ntwo  groups  at f)  a. m.,  wit.h  one  p;'-oup  assigned  to  the Southside  dorm  and  the \nother group  assigned  to  the Northside  dorm.  Dorm  inmates  are  then moved \nfrom  each  dorm  to  the  dayroom  for  approximately  20  minutes  for eating.  At  7 \na. m.  after breakfast is  completed  the  inmates  assigned  to  the dayroom  are \n. locked  back into  the  dayroom  until 9  a.m.  At 9  a.m.  they  .re again  reillrned \nto  their respecti'l:e  daytime  dorm  assignments.  Similar movements  of each \ndorm  occur for lunch  and  dinner.  Thus,  for  the overwhelming portion  of  the \nday  mmates  assigned to  the  day room  for  sleeping quarters  are locked in the \nalready  crowded  dorms  without a  bunk,  cot or even location of their own.  In \nthe  dorm  area  they must  compete  with  other inmates  for what  little floor  space \nmay  exist as  a  place on  which  they  can  place  their blanket or bedding in \norder  to  sit or rest.  At  9:30  p.m.  inmates  assigned  for  sleeping quarter';  to \nthe  dayroom  are  returned  to  the  day room  and locked in  for  the  night. \n-18-\n\n47.  The  crowding in  the  second  floor  d~yroom and  the  two  second \nfloor  dorms  often  is  so  severe  that nearly  all  available  floor  space is  consur:;ed, \nwith  inmates  forced  to  climb  over  tables,  cots,  mattresses,  blankets ,  or  each \nother in  order  to move  eVen  a  few  steps. \n48.  The  noise  level  in  the  day room  and  the  dormitories often \nbecomes  unbearable  and  painful  to  inmates  in  these areas. \n49.  For inmates on  the  second  floor  of  the  ECJ,  there is  no  respite \nat any  point in  the  day  from  the  severe crowding  to  which  they  are  subject \nboth in  the  day room  and  the  dorms. \nThe  Third Floor \n50. .  The  third floor,  which  was  formerly  used  to  house females  who \nare now  housed  at  the  Jail Annex  in  Caldwell,  is  presently  utilized for  males, \nboth  juvenile  and  adult.  Juveniles  are  housed in  the Northside cellblock; \nadults  are  held  in  the  Sou thside  cellblock.  There  are  40  cells  on  the  third \nfloor,  constructed  and  equipped  as  described  in  paragraph 36.  The  back  and \nfron t  tiers  ()f  the  two  cellblยป>:: ks  each  contain  two  tiers of ten  cellsยท open. L, g  0.'1 \nto  a  barred  corridor approximately  five feet  by  50 feet,  ordinarily providing \napproximately  250  square feet  of additional  space for  the  ten inmates  that may \nbe housed on  the  third floor tiers.  The  two  tier corridors in each cellblock \nlead  to  an adjoining small  dayroom,  measuring approximately 15  feet  by  20 \nfeet,  providing approximately  300  square  feet of additional  space  for  the  20 \ninmates  of each  cellblock. \n51.  For essentially 16  to  18  hours  of  the day,  inmates  in  these  20 \ncell units on  the  third floor are  regularly  locked  in  their cells,  wi thou t  access \nto  dayroom  or the  tier corridor. \n52.  For  the  remaining  six  to  eight  hours  a  day  (including three  20 \nto  30  minute  periods  for meals  taken  in  the  dayroom),  they  are permitted \n-19-\n\naccess  to  their  tier  corridor and  the  adjoining  small  dayroom  area.  Th us, \ndefendants  permit  third floor inmates  to  have  access  only  for  six  to  eight \nhours  a  day  to  areas  that  at normal  population  levels  would  provide each \nthird floor  inmate with  approximately  40  square feet of space  (corridor area of \n25  square feet  and  day room  area of 15  square feet)  in  addition  to  their cell. \n53.  Due to  overcrowding  at  the ECJ,  each  of  the small  dayrooms \non  the  third floor also  are used  regularly  for inmate  housing.  As  many  as \neigh t  to  ten  inmates  are  housed on  cots  placed in  these  dayrooms.  Housing \ninmates  in  this manner is  a  constant practice,  particularly on  the  Southside \n(Adult)  cellblock. \n54.  Housing  inmates  in  the  dayrooms  affects  the living  conditions of \nall  third floor  inmates .  When  as  many  as  ten inmates  are housed in  the \ndayrooms,  the  space  available  for  sleeping  quarters  for these inmates \n(hereafter  \"dayroom  inmates\")  amounts  approximately  to  30  square feet of \nfloor space  per inmate  (half of which  space  is  actually  consumed  by  the cots \nand other furnishings);  these  spatial  conditions  exist  for  approximately 16  to \n18  hours  a  day  (this  being  the  time  that other third floor  inmate,;  are locked \nin  their  individual cells).  For  the  6  to  8  hours  a  day when  the  dayroom  is \nshared by 10  \"dayroom  inmates\"  and the inmates  from  the  20 person  cellblock, \nthe  dayroom  can  only  provide approximately  10  square feet  of space per \ninmate  (which  again  even  includes  space consumed by  tables  and other  items). \nThus,  for  the major portion  of  their waking  hours  at  the ECJ,  \"dayroom \ninmates\"  on  the  Third Floor regularly  may  have  as  little as 10  square feet of \nliving  space  to  themselves;  at other  times  they  have a  mere 30  square feel. \nSimilarly,  when inmates  are housed  in  the  dayroom,  the  dayroom  space  to \nwhich  inmates  on  the  tiers  ordinarily  have  access  for 6  to 8  hours  is  reduced \nto  approximately  10  square feet  of  dayroom  area per inmate. \n-20-\n\nThe  Fourth  through  Eleventh  Floors \n55.  Floors  four through  ele'-cn  contain  the  remaining 416  geaecal \npopulation  cells,  constructed  and  equipped  as  described  in paragraph  36. \nInmates  on  these floors  are locked  in  their cells  for  approximately  16  to 171;; \nhours  of  the  day. \n56.  These  floors  are  similarly  arranged  in  Northside  and Southside \ncellblocks ,  but here  the  front and back  tiers of  each  cellblock  contain 13 \ncells .  The  tier  corridors  in  these  cellblocks measure approximately five feet \nby 65  feet,  providing approximately  325  square feet  shared by 13  inmates. \n57.  In  addition,  on  these  floors  the  cellblocks  open  from  one to  the \nother,  thereby  connecting  the  cellblocks  on  floors  4  with  5,  6  with  7,  8  \\vith \n9,  and 10  with  11.  Therefore,  each  Northside  and Southside cellblock  on  these \nadjoining  floors  consists  of  52  cells  arranged  in  a  front and back double  tier \nseparated  by  a  concrete  floor.  Each  double-tiered cellblock  of 52  inmates is \ntreated  as  a  single  unit for  movements  and  activities. \n58.  For approximately  three hours  a  day  (in  two  11;;  hour periods) , \nw. \ninmates  these  52  cell.  units  are  peJ\"Tllitted  access  to  a  small  da1Toom  10C'flted \non  the odd numbered  floors  (5,  7,  9,  and  11)  of  these  two-floor units.  They \nmeasure  approximately  36  feet by 331;;  feet,  thereby providing approximately \n1206  square  feet.  The  dayrooms  are  furnished  with concrete  tables  and \nbenches  and a  television  set .  When  shared  by inmates  from  the 52 cell unit, \nthe day room  allO\\\\(S  approximately  23  square  feet  per  inmate including  area \nconsumed by  the  dayroom  furnishings .  For  the  three hours  a  day  when \ninmates  are  allowed in  the  day room  (other  than  for  meals),  they  are  locked in \nit and  do  not  have  access  either  to  the  tier  corridor or their cells. \n---\nTherefore,  for  this  period  of  time  they  are limited  to  the  23  square feet of \nspace  per  inmate  which  the  day room  provides  for  the  52  inmate  unit. \n-21-\n\n59.  While  the  day room  provides  an  alternate  area  to  which \nthe  inmates  may  go  for  three  hours  a  day,  the  23  square  feet of  space  per \ninmate  does  not  even  at normal  population  levels  relieve  the  crowdi.!1g \nexperienced by inmates. \n60.  For another three  hours  a  day  inmates  in  these 52 cell  double \ntier  units  are permitted  access  to  the  tier corridors  in  their ~ellblocks ,  as \ndescribed in paragraph 53.  These corridors  at normal  population levels \nprovide  approximately  25  square feet  of  space  per inmate in  addition  to  the \napproximately 17\\ square feet  of  available  cell  space for  inmates on  the fourth \nthrough  eleven th floors.  Thus,  for  three  hours  a  day,  and  at normal \npopulation  levels,  inmates  may  have  at most  42\\ square feet  of  space for \nactivity. \n61.  Inmates  held  in  the  general  population  cells  also  take  theil \nmeals  i11  the  dayrooms,  which  allows  them  another period of approximately  I  to \n1\\ hours  a  day  in  which  they  are  permitted  out of  their cells.  For this \nperiod,  however,  the  52  inmate  unit  also  is  locked in  the  day room  area. \n62.  Thus,  even  at  the  normal  population  levels  50  far  desc:nbed \nfor  the  cellblock5,  inmates  spend  the  en tirety  of their day in crowded, \ncramped  quarters:  for 16\\  to 17  hours  a  day,  excepting brief periods  when \nthey may  have a  visit or see  a  doctor or  counselor,  they  are locked  in \nindividual cells  providing approximately  35  square feet  (actually only 17\\ \nsquare feet  of av.ailable  space  when  area consumed by cell furnishings  is \nconsidered);  for  4!z  hours  of  the  remaining  six hours  they  have access \nactually  to  less  living  space  (the  23  square feet  of  space provided by  the \ndayrooms  in  which  they  are locked for  this  period);  and for  the other three \n_ hours  they  have  access  to  the  tier  corridor which  provides  approximately  25 \nsquare feet  of  space  in  addition  to  their cells. \n-22-\n\n63.  As  with  the  inmates  housed  elsewhere in  the ECJ, \novercro-.vding  has  exacerbated  the  paltry  provision  of  housing and living-\nspace  for  inmates.  As  many  as  ten  inmates  are  regularly  housed  in  each  of \nthe  four  dayrooms  on  the  5th,  7th,  9th,  and llth  floors _  When  inmates  are so \nhoused in  the  dayrooms,  cots  are provided for  them  on  which  to  sleep.  The \ncots  are  brought out  at approximately  II  p. m.  and removed from  the  dayroom \nat  5  a.m.;  inmates  wishing to  sleep  for longer  than  5  or 6  hours must  sleep \non  the  floors  or on  the  tables  (on  which  they  and other inmates  also  must \neat).  During  the  day,  half of  the inmates  assigned for  sleeping quarters  to \nthe  day room  are  reassigned  to  one of  the  tiers  in  the cellblock  areas;  while \non  the  tiers  they only  have  the  corridor space  to  use,  which  is  shared with \nthe  inmates  assigned  to  cells  on  the  particular tier;  while  on  the  tier they \nalso must  share the  sanitary  facilities  in  another inmate's  cell. \n64.  Housing inmates  in  the  dayrooms  on  the fifth,  seventh,  ninth \nand eleventh  floors  also  affects  the  living conditions  of inmates  housed in \ncells  on  the  tiers:  for  the  7;\"  hours  that inmates  as singed  to  cells  have \naccess  to  the  areas  other  than  their cells,  the  paltry amount of space \navailable  either on  the  tiers  (ordinarily  25  square feet per inmate)  or in the \ndayroom  (ordinarily  23  square feet of  space per inmate) must be  further \nshared  with inmates  who  are regularly  housed in  the  dayroom. \nThe Twelfth  Floor \n65.  There is  also  an  area on  the  twelth  floor  called  the  \"civil area\" \nordinarily  used for  inmate  housing.  This  area provides  five  cubicles  each \nmeasuring  approximately  eight feet  by  twleve  feet,  providing approximately  96 \nsquare feet.  Each  cubicle is  now  used  to  house four inmates,  providing each \ninmate  only  24  square feet.  The  cubicles  open  on  to  a  small  dayroom  area \n-23-\n\nmeasuring  approximately  40  feet  by  24  fE:et;  due  to  overcrowding  this  are;.,  is \nused  to  house  an  additional nineteen  or twenty  inmates.  Inmates  are  allowed \nto  leave  the  \"civil area\"  only for  approximately  three hours  a  week whe,) \nscheduled for  recreation  or  the  library. \n66.  A  separate housing  area is  provided on the  twelfth  floor  for \ninmates  who  are  \"tiermen\"  in  the  form  of a  small  dormitory  containing  bunks \nfor  six inmates. \n67.  Additionally,  on  the  twelfth  floor  there are nine detention \ncells;  of  these nine  cells,  only  five  cells  contain  toilet  units;  inmates held  in \nthe other four  cells  either must  contact a  guard to  use. a  toilet or  are \nprovided paper cups in  which  to  urinate when  a  guard may  not be available. \n68.  The  twelfth  floor  also  contain  the hospital ward,  with  beds  for \napproxi.mately  13  inmates  crowded  into  a  small  area. \nDuration  of  Confin.ement \n69.  Approximately  sixty  percent  of the ECJ pretrial population  on \nany  given  day  has  been  confined under  the overcrowded  conditions  for  over \n45  days;  approximately  one-half of  the  pretrial population  of the  ECJ on  any \ngiven  day  has  been  confined under  the overcrowded  conditions  at the ECJ  for \nover  60  days;  approximately one-third of  the pretrial population has been \nconfined in  like manner for over 90  days. \n70.  Inmates  sentenced to  terms  in  state correctional institutions \nhave  been  similarly  confined  at  the ECJ for  extended periods of  time. \n-24-\n\nRecreation  and Exercise \n71.  An  opportunity for  indoor  recreation  and exercise  is  only \navailable  to  ECJinmates once  a  week  for  a  scheduled period  of  approximately \nl~ hours. \n72.  The  recreation  area is  located on  the  thirteenth floor of  the \nECJ.  It consists of  a  gymnasium  type  area which  contains  an  area for  basket::'all, \na  ping pong  table,  a  pool  table,  and  a  universal gym.  The gymnasium is open \nfor inmate use only five  days  a  week  during  day hours;  this facility  is  not \nutilized on  evenings or weekends. \n73.  Due  to  overcrowding at  the ECJ and the time  required  to move \nthe large  number of inmates  from  their respective housing  areas ,  inmates \nactually only may  be able  to  obtain  35  to  50  minutes  in  the  recreation area. \n74.  There is  no  program  of outdoor  recreation for ECJ inmates. \nActivities  and Programs \n75.  Other than  recreation  time  as  described in paragraphs  71  to \n74,  inmates  at  the ECJ are  scheduled for  only  another one-and-a-half hours \neach  week  in  an  activity  area  away  from  their housing area or dayroom. \nDuring  this  additional one-and-a-half hour period,  inmates  are  permitted to \nvisit  the  auditorium  and library area located on  the  thirteenth floor.  As  with \nthe  gymnasium,  the  library facility  is  not utilized on  evenings or weekends. \nDue  to  overcrowding at  the ECJ  and  the  time  required to  mcve  the large \nnumber of inmates  from  their  respective  housing areas,  inmates  actually  only \nmay  be  able  to  obtain  35  to  50 minutes in  the  library area. \n76.  Activities  in  the  dayrooms  in which inmates  are locked for \nthree hours  a  day  (as  described  in  paragraphs 43-49,  58-59  and  63-64)  are \nseverely limited,  consisting entirely of one  television  set,  some  broken  board \ngames  and  decks  of cards.  Virtually  no  floor  space is available  to  conduct \nany  active  recreation and  most  inmates  only  can  sit idly on  benches.  tables, \nor the floor. \n-25-\n\nClassification \n77.  There is  no  written  plan  for  classifying iDmates  at the  ECJ, \nnor is  there a  classification  manual. \n78.  Due  to  the overcrowded  conditions in  all housing areas, \nparticularly in  the  second floor  dorms,  all  the  dayrooms,  and the  twelfth  flool' \n\"civil area\",  inmates  are  not  classified for housing assignments based on \neither their status  as  a  detainee,  medical  reasons,  or the  seriousness of  the \noffense with  which  they  are charged or convicted.  Sentenced inmates  are  not \nsegregated from  detainees,  nor  are  new  admissions,  alcoholics,  narcotic \naddicts or inmates  with  medical problems  separated from  the rest of the inmate \npopulation. \n79.  In  the  twenfth floor  \"civil area\",  inmates  held for non-crL'1linal \nmatters  are  regularly  housed with  inmates  committed on criminal charges  with \nclearly  observable  psychological  problems. \nVisitation  and Telephone \n80.  Present visiting hours,  visitation  space,  and telephone policies \nare  inadequate for  the  Jail's  population. \n81.  Visiting at  the  ECJ is  scheduled six days  a  week,  Tuesday \nthrough  Sunday,  but for only  three hours  a  day.  Visits  are conducted in \nbooths with  a  barrier separating inmate from  visitor;  voice  contact is made \nthrough  a  phone., \n82.  Children  are  not permitted to  visit on  Saturdays or Wednesdays_ \n83.  There are 30  visiting booths  at the ECJ  to  accomodate its \nentire population of over  700  inmates.  Six booths  are located on  each  of  the \nthird,  fourth,  sixth,  eighth  and  tenth  floors _  At  the present population, \nthese booths  do  not adequately  provide for  the  volume  of  visitors  nor for \nsufficien t  visiting  time. \n-26-\n\n84.  Inmates  in  the  second  floor  dorms  or  dayroom  must take  their \nvisits  in  the  third floor  visiti.'1g  booths.  As  a  result,  on  any  p3.rticuLl1- day \napproximately  220  inmates  (from  the  second  and  third  floors )  only  have  six \nbooth  available  for  visits. \n85.  The  six visiting  booths  on  each  of  the fourth,  sixth,  and \neighth floors  are  shared  by over  100  inmates.  On  numerous  occasions,  some \nvisiting booths  have  been  inoperable. \n86.  At  normal population  levels,  visits  may  be  as  long  as  30 \nminutes,  with  two  visits  permitted  a  day.  Due  to  overcrowding and the \ndemand placed  on  the  visiting facilities,  visits  are  considerably shorter,  often \nlimited  to  a  mere  five  or  ten minutes,  with  only  six visits  permitted a  week. \n87.  Due  to  the  large  number of inmates  receiving visits and  the \nlimited  hours  available for  that activity,  the  overcrowded  conditions  at  the \nECJ  have  reduced  the opportunity  for  communication  and minimal  contact \nbetween  inmates  and  their families  and friends. \n88.  Inmate  phone  calls  are limited  to  two  calls  of  three minutes  per \nday.  On  the  average  there  are only  two  phones  available  for  every 60  inmates. \nAccess  to  the  Courts \n89.  The  ECJ contains  a  law  library on  the  thirteenth floor  to which \ninmates  have  access  as  described  in  paragraphs  75  to  76.  Due  to  overcrowding \nand  the  presence, of over  two  hundred  sentenced inmates,  the library  is \nheavily  used  and  cannot  accomodate  all who  desire access  to it nor provide \nsufficient  time  for  appropriate  research  and  preparation. \n90.  The  volumes  in  the  law  library  are limited  and  do  not  provide \n-full and  current sets of  materials  necessary  for  the  legal  research needs of \nthe  ECJ  population. \n-27-\n\nHealth,  Sanitation  and  Safety \n91.  Due  to  a  shortage  of  available  bed  space  and \nmatt.ress~s, \ninmates  at  the  ECJ  are  at  times  forced  to  sleep  on  mattresses  placed  on \nconcrete  floors or even  with only  a  blanket  directly  on  the  floor  without  a \nmattress  at  all,  or  without a  mattress  on  a  cot  frame. \n92.  In  the  dayroom  areas,  because  of  the  removal  of cots  and \nmattresses  at  5  a.m.  (which  only  permits inmates  to have less  than  SL,{  hourยทs \nfor  sleep  on  them)  and  the lack  of appropriate  sleeping quarters in  any  other \nareas,  inmates  often must  sleep  on  the  concrete  tables  on which  they  and \nother inmates  also  eat  their meals . \n93.  In  the  dayroom  areas  where  inmates  eat their meals,  some  of \nthe  tables  are only  a  few  feet  from open  toilets ,  inadequately  shielded  either \nto  provide  privacy  for persons  using  the  toilets or to  limit  the  view  by \ninmates  who  are  eating  of  other inmates  urinating or defecating.  Many  of  the \ntoilets  also  emit  foul  and  unpleasant odors,  or ar-e  inoperable. \n94.  Showers  and other  plumbling  fixtures often operate improperly \nor not  at  all  due  to  overuse  or  lack of  repair,  making  personal hYidene \ndifficult  or  impossible . \n95.  Due  to  overcrowding and the  sheer number of people who  are \ncompelled  to  inhabit the  day rooms  and  dorm  areas  of the ECJ,  the noise  level \n. in  these  areas  often  becomes  intolerable  and  painful,  impair,. the ability of \ninmates  to  engag~ in  any  activity requiring  concentration or attention,  and \nproduces  an  environment in  which  idleness  and  tension  predominates.  The \nphysical  limitations  of  the ECJ ,  with  hard surfaces  of concrete,  tile,  and steel \nthroughout these  areas  further  exacerbates  the  noise level produced  by  the \novercrowding. \n-28-\n\n96.  Areas  of  the  ECJ,  including areas  used for  sleeping and  eating \nby  inmates  are infested with  roaches,  mice  and  rats.  While  exterminators \nvisit some  areas  of the ECJ,  there is  no  extermination  for infestations in  the \ncells  or on  the  tiers.  Extermination  undertaken in other areas is  plainly \ninsufficient  to  control the infestation  of  the  areas  where inmates  are housed \nand  take  their meals. \n97.  Inmates  who  sleep  on  mattresses  placed on  the floors  of  the \ndayrooms  or  dorms  have  found  roaches  or mice on  their bedding upon  awaking \nin  the morning or during  the night.  Rats  and roaches have been observed in \nthe  dayrooms  and on  the  tiers. \n98.  Floors  of  the  corridors  and  cells  are often  dirty and wet,  on \nwhich  waste  collects,  due  to  inoperable  drains or otherwise faulty  plumbing, \ncreating hazards  to inmates  in  the living units. \n99.  Areas  01'  the Jail are in  need of extensive  repair to  insure  a \nminimally  safe,  secure,  and healthy  environment for its inhabitants.  For \nexample,  the  ceiling of  the  Third Floor  Southside  (juvenile)  dayroom  has  been \ncrumbli...T1g  and  deteriorating for  an  extendp.d  period  time  without adequate \nrepairs,  threatening  the  safety,  health,  and  security of inmates in  this area. \n100.  A  large number of mattresses  at  the ECJ  are not constructed \nof an  approved fire  retardant material. \n101.  Heat and smoke  detectors  are  not  provided 'n all living units \ndespite  recommendations  by state fire marshalls  that  such  detectors  should  be \ninstalled. \n102.  On  information  and belief,  the ECJ  does  not maintain \nemergency plans  for fire  and evacuation with  which its  staff is familiar.  In \nparticular,  there are  no  written  proceedures for  release of inmates  from \nlocked  areas  and evacuation. \n-29-\n\n!l1edical Care \n103.  When  an  inmate  is  admitted  for  incarceration  at  the  ECJ,  a \nmedical  history  is  taken  by a  nurse and,  ordinarily,  blood  tests  are \nperformed.  Inmates  who  upon  admission  complain of or evidence  some  type of \nmedical  disorder  are  also  ordinarily  referred to  the medical  department fOl \nexamination,  diagnosis  and  treatment. \n104.  Due  to  overcrowding at  the  ECJ,  the medical department is \nboth overutilized and often  unable to  perform  according to its ordinary \nprocedures:  the medical  screening of  inmates  often has been limited  to  a \nperfunctory medical history;  blood tests  have  been overlooked;  physical \nexaminations  are  the  exception  not the  rule;  and there have been  extended \ndelays  in  referrals  for observable medical problems. \n\"'fi'o~' of Overcrowdini', on  Inmates \n105.  Overcrowding and  the  conditions  in  the housing and  living \nunits  as  described in  paragraphs  27  to  70  have caused pervasive idleness, \nhave  severely limited  the opportunity for  recreation,  exercise and visit'ltio'l, \nand have  seriously  impeded classification,  sanitation,  safety  and  the provision \nof medical  services  so as  to  breed anxiety  and  violence,  threaten  the inmates' \nphysical and mental wellbeing,  threaten  to  produce debilitation in  those \nconfined,  and inflict needless  privations  and hardships on  irmates  detained at \nthe  ECJ. \n106.  Overcrowding and its  consequences as  described  in  paragraphs \n27  to 102  further  has  prevented defendants  from  implementing classification \nprocedures  necessary for  the health,  safety  and  security of inmates,  has \nprevented the  development of  activities  and  programs for  inmates,  including \nincreased opportunities for  exercise  and  recreation.  has  severely  limited \n-30-\n\nmaintenance  of  minimally  adequate  visitation  time  capable  of  reducing anxidy \nand  tension  and  insuring continuation  of  family  and  community  contacc,  has \ndamaged  the  ability  of  defendants  to  continue  performing  necessary medical \nscreening for  ECJ inmates,  and has  contributed to  the  development of an \nunsanitary,  hazardous  and  insecure  environment at the ECJ  for its inhabitants \nand  staff. \nCAUSES  OF  ACTION \n107.  The  totality  of  the overcrowded  conditions  at the  ECJ, \nincluding  the  housing of inmates  for  extended periods of time  in  severely \ncrowded  areas  without minimally  adequate living  space,  with  some  inmates \nforced  to  sleep  on  concrete  floors  or  tables,  with  some inmates  forced  to  sleep \neven  without mattresses,  with  inmates  not provided reasonable opportunities \nf\"r ro~rf'3tlon and exercise,  with  severely  shortened visitation,  and with \ninadequate  provision for  classification  of  the inmate  population  sUbjects  those \nmembers  of  the  class  who  are pretrial detainees  to  punishment without  due \nprocess  of law  in  violation  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the United  States \nConstitution  and  subjects members  of  the  plaintiff class  who  are sentenced \ninmates  to  cruel and unusual punishment in violation  of  the Eighth  and \nFourteenth Amendments  to  the  Constitution  of  the United  States.  These \nconditions  also  violate  the plaintiffs'  rights  to  association,  p rivacy,  equal \nprotection  of  the.1aw,  and  due  process of law  granted by  the First, Fourth, \nFifth,  Ninth  and Fourteenth  Amendments  to  the United States  Constitution. \nIRREPARABLE  INJURY \n108.  The aforesaid  conditions  and  practices  are known  to  the \ndefendants,  their agents  and  their employees,  but these  conditions  and \n-31-\n\npractices  have been  allowed  to  continue  and  to  become  worse  without a \nconcerted effort to  bring  about  their  elimination  or correction  in  a  mapner \nthat would  provide  timely  relief  for  those  plaintiffs  who  have  and  will  continue \nto  suffer from  these  conditions  and practices. \n109.  The  aforesaid conditions  of life  and  official practices  are \nallowed  to  continue  and  are  imposed  by  defendants  under color of  law of  the \nState of New Jersey. \n110.  There is  an  actual controversy  between  plaintiffs  and \ndefendants  in  that  the  defendants  allow  the  conditions  and  practices  above \ndescribed to  continue unimpeded and  uncorrected,  and the plaintiffs and  the \nclass  they  represent have no  adequate  remedy  at law,  thus making injunctive \nand  declaratory  relief appropriate. \n111.  Plaintiffs  and  the  class  they  represent  are sufferil'g and  will \ncontinl]'\"  to  suffer in  the  future  irreparable injury  unless  a  preliminary \ninjunction  is  issued,  which  should  remain  permanent after a  full  eVidentiary \nhearing. \n112.  The  actions  and inactions  of  the  defendants as  alleged.  and \nthe  claims  of the  plaintiffs  and  the  class  they  represent require  that this \nCourt  declare  the  rights  and  legal relationships  of  the parties in respect to \nthe  conditions  at  the ECJ. \nAV AILABLE  REMEDIES \n113.  Several potential methods  of  reducing  the population confined \nat the  ECJ are available  and may  be  implemented rapidly: \na)  transfer of  sentenced inmates  from  the ECJ  to  facilities \nunder  the  jurisdiction or control of other county or state correctional \nau thorities; \n-32-\n\nb)  maxi.!I1ization  of  pretrial relief mechanisms  as  an  alternati'.-<C \nto  high  bail; \nc)  acquisition or construction of  additional temporary  housi.\"l~' \nfacilities  through purchase or remodeling  until completion of new  permanent \nfacilities  become  available; \nd)  utilization of other housing facilities  for  offenders not \nrequiring secure confinement  such as  those on  work release  or serving \nsen tences  on  weekends  only; \ne)  careful review of  the  appropriateness of all sentences to \nevaulate  alternatives  to  incarceration and  shortening of sentences  for \nnon-dangerous  offenders. \nPRAYER  FOR  RELIEF \nWHEREFORE,  plaintiffs  pray on  behalf of  themselves  and  all others \nsimilarly  situated for  the  following  relief: \n1.  That this  Court order,  pursuant  to  Rule  23  of  the Federal Rules \nof  Civil Procedure,  that this  action  be maintained as  a  class  action  and  that \nplaintiffs  are proper class  representatives; \n2.  That this  Court adjudge and declare  that the  conditions  at the \nECJ  are unconsti~utional and violate  the  rights  of the plaintiffs and their \nclass,  as  a  result of  the overcrowding of inmates  existing there; \n3.  That this  Court issue an Order permanently enjoining the \ndefendants,  their agents,  their  employees,  and  those acting in concert with \nthem  to  reduce  the population  of  the  ECJ  to  constitutional levels  and set  the \ntimetable  for  such  reduction; \n-33-\n\n4.  That  this  Court  issue  an  Order  pennanently  enjoining  the \ndefendants  to  take  all  such  action  as  may  be  necessary  to  ensure  that  the \npopulation of  the ECJ  does . not  exceed  the  numbers  who may  be  safely  and \nconstitutionally confined  there; \n5.  That  this  Court  specifically  declare: \na)  that  the  totality  of  conditions  under which  plaintiffs  and \nmembers  of  the class  who  are  pretrial detainees  are forced  to  live  at the ECJ \namounts  to punishment in  that these  conditions  subject plaintiffs  to  hardships, \nprivations,  and unhealthful conditions,  as  well as  restrictions on  their \nliberty,  which  are  not justified by  a  legitimate  interest or which  are excessive \nin  relation  to  that interest; \nb)  that  the  totality of  conditions  under which  plaintiffs  and \nmembers  of  the  class  who  have  been  sentenced  to  a  tenn in  the ECJ,  or who \n\"'C''-~  \"',~cor,  sentenced  to  a  tenn  in  a  New  Jersey  state correctional institution \nand  who  are held in  the  ECJ  awaiting  transfer to  state custody,  are forc':!d  to \nlive  subjects  them  to  cruel and unusual punishment; \nc)  that  the  conditions  of ':onfinem<ont  caused by the acts  and \nomissions  of  the  defendants  in  failing  to  provide minimum  levels of  habilitative \nshelter,  living  space,  classification,  recreation,  visitation,  sanitation, \nsecurity,  and opportunities  for  education,  counseling and  other rehabilitative \nprograms  deny  the  plaintiffs  and  the  class  they  represent  of equal  protection \nof the law  as  guaranteed to  them  by  the Fourteenth Amendment. \n6.  That the  Court  specifically  order: \na)  that  under  the  totality  of  conditions  that presently exist, \nwherein  nearly  all  inmates  are  held in  severely cramped living space at \nvirtually all  times,  that  the  ECJ  be prohibited from  housing more  than  one \nperson  in  any of  the 456  general population  cells  at  the jail,  that the  second \n-34-\n\nfloor  dorms  be prohibited  from  housing more  than  39  bmate each,  th:l t  the \ntwelfth  floor  civil area house  no  more  than 10  bmates,  that  the  three  twelfth \nfloor  quiet  cells  house no  more  than one inmate  each,  and that the  twelfth \nfloor  tiermen  dorm  house  no  more  than  3  inmates;  thereby  establishing a \nmaximum  capacity of 550  inmates  for  the ECJ  in order to  provide  minimally \nhabilita live  shelter; \nb)  that the ECJ  and  cells  and living  areas  therein be kept \nill. \nsanitary  condition,  that  use of mattresses placed on  floors  for sleeping be \nprohibited,  that  use of cots  without mattresses  for  sleeping be prohibited; \nc)  that inmates  be allowed and provided a  regular daily \nprogram  of exercise  and recreation  outside  of  their living areas  and \ndayrooms,  in  order to  ensure  their health  and wellbeing; \nd)  that inmates  have prompt  access  to  adequate  professional \nTTlPr1i,,~l .  dental ,  psychiatric  and psychological  services on a  routine basis  and \nin  emergencies  and  that  they  be provided  with  basic preventative medical and \nden tal care; \ne)  that inmates  be medicall.v  screened upon  admission  to  the \njail for  communicable  diseases  and other existing medical conditions ; \nf)  that a  classification  system  be implemented to  assign inmate \nhousing based on  status  as  a  detainee or sentenced inmate,  for medically \nindicated  reasons,  and for  the  safety  and security of those held  in  the  jail; \ng)  that inmates  be provided  adequate  fire retardant \nmattresses  and bedding,  and  that  smoke  and  heat  detectors  be installed in all \nliving areas  of  the  jail; \nh)  that visiting  conditions  afford  decency,  comfort and \nprivacy  and a  length of  visit  sufficiently  long  to  provide meaningful contact \nwith  family  and friends; \n-35-\n\ni)  that  the  two  daily  telephone  calls  allowed  be  suffic;.ently \nlong  to  provide meaningful  contact with  family  and  friends.  and  that  cegulal' \naccess  to  a  telephone for  legal calls  be  allowed  whenever  required; \nJ)  that  the  law library and  legal research  collection  be kept \ncurrent and maintained in  accordance with  the  standards  for  county  jail \nlibraries  established by the  State Library of  the New ,Jersey  Department \nof  Education. \n7.
