The DOJ conducted this investigation under the authority of 42 U.S.C. § 1997, also known as the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA).  On September 11, 2000, the DOJ issued a findings letter containing evidence that NCCC unconstitutionally physically abused inmates and behaved with deliberate indifference to inmates' serious medical needs.  </p><p>In April 2002, the DOJ filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, and the parties' settlement agreement was attached to the complaint. The case was assigned to Arlene Lindsay. The complaint alleged that NCCC violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments by subjecting inmates to improper use of force and failing to provide medical care. Under the settlement, the NCCC agreed to develop and implement appropriate policies regarding inmate medical care and mental health services.  Specifically, the policies were to address issues in the areas of inmate prescreening, staffing levels, sick call, medication distribution, emergency care, dental care, mental health care, substance abuse treatment, disease control, records, training, mortality reviews, inmate education, sanitation, immunization, and medical grievance procedures.  </p><p>The NCCC also agreed to develop and implement new procedures concerning the use of force against inmates.  Specifically, the policies were to address issues in the areas of staff training, reporting and documenting use of force, use of chemical agents, use of restraints, physical contact between staff and inmates. </p><p>On May 7, 2002, the court conditionally dismissed the complaint, provided that the defendant had substantially complied with the agreement over the course of three years. In August 2002, the court reassigned the case to Judge Leonard Wexler. </p><p>On July 15, 2005, the parties jointly stipulated that NCCC was in substantial compliance with the portion of the settlement agreement about improper use of force and the court accordingly dismissed that portion of the case. However, the parties agreed that NCCC was not in substantial compliance with the portion of the settlement agreement relating to the provision of medical care and the court thus retained jurisdiction until NCCC was in substantial compliance. </p><p>On March 14, 2008, the parties stipulated that NCCC was then substantially compliant with settlement agreement related to provision of medical care. Accordingly, Judge Wexler dismissed the case in full. The case is now closed. </p>",

Nassau County Sherriff's Department, Settlement Agreement Page 1of 19\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nEASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Plaintiff,  \n           -against-  \nNASSAU COUNTY, THOMAS GULOTTA, \nNassau County Executive, NASSAU \nCOUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT, and \nEDWARD REILLY, Sheriff of Nassau \nCounty, Defendants.  \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \nI.  Introduction \n     1.    On April 19, 1999, the United States, through the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") notified Nassau \nCounty Executive Thomas Gulotta of its intent to investigate certain conditions at the Nassau County \nCorrectional Center (\"NCCC\") to determine whether those conditions violated inmates' constitutional \nrights. The United States conducted this investigation pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized \nPersons Act (\"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 1997 et seq., and the pattern or practice provision of the Violent \nCrime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. § 14141. \n      2.    On September 11, 2000, DOJ issued its letter of findings (\"Findings Letter\") containing \nevidence that NCCC subjects inmates to unconstitutional conditions that have caused them grievous \nharm: that staff engage in a pattern or practice of physical abuse of inmates, and that NCCC is \ndeliberately indifferent to inmates' serious medical needs.  \n      3.    NCCC cooperated throughout the course of the investigation and indicated a willingness to \nvoluntarily undertake measures to improve conditions at NCCC and to respond to the evidence set forth \nin DOJ's Findings Letter and to address DOJ's concerns regarding treatment of inmates' serious mental \nhealth needs set forth in a letter dated October 4, 2000. Consequently, the parties enter into this \nSettlement Agreement for the purpose of avoiding the risks and burdens of litigation. \n     4.    The parties agree that this settlement does not constitute an admission by the defendants of the \ntruth of the findings contained in the Findings Letter and does not constitute an admission of liability by \nthe defendants. This settlement is not intended to interfere with rights conferred by any applicable \ncollective bargaining agreements or alter any existing collective bargaining agreements. \n     5.    The parties acknowledge that the Nassau University Medical Center (\"NUMC\") provides \nmedical care to inmates at the NCCC and that such care is provided pursuant to a contract with the \nNUMC which sets forth the terms and conditions of the relationship between the County of Nassau and \nits agencies and NUMC. Nassau County shall be responsible for ensuring that NUMC complies with the \nterms of this agreement. Nothing in this paragraph shall abrogate Nassau County's responsibility to \ncomply fully with the terms of this agreement. \n      6.    It is expressly understood and acknowledged that, while this agreement makes no distinctions \nbetween those issues concerning inmate care, custody and control previously modified and or improved \nprior to the issuance of the Findings Letter and those which shall be modified and/or improved by virtue \nof the terms of this agreement, the parties acknowledge that a number of the policies and/or procedures \nwhich this agreement addresses were implemented or in the process of being implemented prior to the \nissuance of the Findings Letter. \nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/Nassa_sher_agreem.htm 9/12/2006\n\nUnited States v. Nassau County Sherriff's Department, Settlement Agreement Page 2of 19\nII.    Medical and Mental Health Care \n     A.   Policies and Procedures \n      7.

NCCC shall cause its medical provider to verify medical credentials for all medical \nprofessionals upon initial hire, and at least every two years thereafter. The verification shall include \ninquiry into any restrictions or sanctions for each health professional who provides medical care to \npatients. NUMC shall maintain copies of current professional credential licensing for all medical and \nmental health professionals, and maintain appropriate records of its credential verifications. NUMC shall \nmake such records available to DOJ upon request.\nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/Nassa_sher_agreem.htm 9/12/2006\n\nUnited States v. Nassau County Sherriff's Department, Settlement Agreement Page 3of 19\n      13.   NCCC shall provide twenty-four (24) hour on site full-time physician or allied health \nprofessional coverage (under the supervision of a physician) seven (7) days per week, fifty-two (52) \nweeks per year.

NCCC shall ensure that NUMC maintains monthly reports setting forth all medical staffing \npositions filled and unfilled on the first day of each reporting period. This report shall include all \npersonnel/professional job classifications, as defined above. \n      C.   Intake Screening \n     16.    NCCC shall perform timely initial health screening for new inmates on the day of arrival in \naccordance with 22 N.Y.C.R.R. § 7010.2 and shall make every good faith effort to record and seek the \ninmates' cooperation to provide (1) medical, surgical, mental health, and dental history; (2) current \ninjuries, illnesses, evidence of trauma, and vital signs; (3) current medications; (4) allergy information; \n(5) personal physician(s), dentist(s), and mental health provider(s); (6) immunization history as follows: \ninfluenza; pneumococcal vaccine for inmates fifty (50) or over or with chronic disease; hepatitis; (7) \nmental health screening to include suicide attempt history, history of mental health including \nhospitalization, suicidal ideation and risk assessment; (8) history of substance abuse and treatment; (9) \npregnancy; (10) history or symptoms of tuberculosis, including the date and result of the last TB test; \n(11) history or symptoms of other communicable diseases. All medical and mental health screening \nforms shall become part of an inmate's medical record or chart. \n      17.    As part of intake screening, NCCC shall routinely perform on all inmates a tuberculin skin test \n(i.e. Mantoux \"PPD\") and shall read the PPD forty-eight (48) to seventy-two (72) hours after placement \nunless such test is unnecessary (i.e. history of prior positive tests) or medically contra-indicated \naccording to Centers for Disease Control (\"CDC\") Guidelines. Within 72 hours of determining that an \ninmate's PPD test is positive, NCCC shall perform and interpret a chest x-ray of the inmate. NCCC shall \nfollow CDC guidelines for management of inmates with TB infection, including prophylactic \nmedication for any patient with an anticipated length of stay of two (2) months or more.

Inmates with Hepatitis C shall be treated in accordance with CDC guidelines, unless NCCC's \nphysician deems such treatment medically inappropriate, in which case, such determination shall be \nrecorded with specificity in the inmate's chart. \nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/Nassa_sher_agreem.htm 9/12/2006\n\nUnited States v. Nassau County Sherriff's Department, Settlement Agreement Page 4of 19\n      22.    In the event an inmate refuses to voluntarily cooperate in the screening and/or test(s) referred \nto in paragraphs 17-21, after being advised of its importance to the inmate's health needs, then such \nrefusal shall be documented by medical center personnel. In such event, NCCC shall take steps \nmedically appropriate for the health of the individual inmate, other inmates and staff.  \n     23.    A physician or allied health professional shall perform full health assessments within seven (7) \ndays of an inmate's arrival at NCCC, unless the intake screening indicates the inmate has a contagious \nillness, is on medication, has immediate medical needs, is intoxicated, is experiencing alcohol or drug \nwithdrawal, or has been participating in a substance abuse or detoxification program, in which case, the \nprovisions of paragraph 24 shall govern. \n      24.    When the initial health screening indicates that the inmate has a contagious illness, is on \nmedication, has immediate health needs, is intoxicated, is experiencing alcohol or drug withdrawal, or \nhas been participating in a substance abuse or detoxification program, NCCC shall conduct a full health \nassessment within thirty-six (36) hours of the inmate's arrival, and shall provide treatment consistent \nwith the terms of this Agreement, except that assessment and treatment shall be provided more \nexpeditiously if necessary for the inmate's health and safety. NCCC shall continue the same or \ncomparable medication within twenty-four (24) hours unless it is deemed not medically indicated by \nNUMC physician staff or not consistent with standard medical practice after diligent efforts are made, \nand documented, to contact the inmate's treating physician.  \n     25.

NCCC shall develop and implement a revised use of force reporting form that (1) requires a \ndetailed and descriptive account of the incident based on the reporter's first hand observation and \nknowledge and (2) includes spaces for relevant standardized information such as the name and badge \nnumber of involved staff, the location of the incident; a description of the inmate's conduct that \nprecipitated the use of force; a description of the actions of all other individuals observed by the \nreporter; a description of the verbal persuasion or warning preceding the use of force and the inmate's \nresponse; whether the Tour Commander was notified prior to the use of force, and if not, an explanation \nfor the failure to do so; whether the use of force was videotaped; whether the inmate was armed, and if \nso, the type of arms; whether injuries were sustained, and by whom; whether control holds were \nemployed; the specific type of force that was used; whether chemical spray or any other force or \nrestraint device was used; the time that medical staff examined the inmate and staff; and the names of all \ninmate and staff witnesses. \n      79.    NCCC shall develop and implement policies and procedures that require the Tour \nCommanders to assign a \"designated sergeant\" to review the use of force reports. The sergeant \nresponsible for supervising the area where the use of force incident occurred shall be so designated \nunless he/she authorized, witnessed, or participated in the use of force incident. In such cases, the Tour \nCommander shall assign another sergeant on duty to review the reports. The designated sergeant shall \nreview the report for completeness and accuracy. If the designated sergeant determines that the report(s) \nis not complete or accurate, the sergeant will direct the writer of the report to submit an addendum to the \nreport. The designated sergeant shall review the use of force report within four (4) hours of receipt and \nshall forward it, and any addendum, to the Tour Commander. \n     80.    The designated sergeant shall conduct an initial investigation of the use of force which shall \ninclude interviews of staff and inmates. During this review, the designated sergeant shall take \nappropriate steps to ensure that physical evidence subject to destruction or loss or medical evidence \nsubject to change is or has been investigated. The NCCC shall develop and implement a reporting form \nto be completed by the designated sergeant. The form shall be provided to DOJ for review and input in \naccordance with the time frames set forth below. The designated sergeant shall complete and forward \nthe report to the Tour Commander. \n      81.    In addition to filing the required reports, participants and witnesses to a use of force who \nbelieve that they observed a violation of institutional policy shall be required to timely report this \ninformation directly to the Sheriff's Bureau of Investigations (\"SBI\"), either orally or by separate \nmemorandum.  \nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/Nassa_sher_agreem.htm 9/12/2006\n\nUnited States v. Nassau County Sherriff's Department, Settlement Agreement Page 13of 19\n     82.   Staff claiming injury shall be provided an opportunity to be examined and treated by NCCC \nmedical staff. The use of force form shall describe such examination and treatment, if any. \n     83.    Immediately after a use of force, staff who neither participated in, nor witnessed the incident \nshall escort the inmate who was the subject of such force to the medical unit (or NUMC) for \nexamination by medical staff and for appropriate medical treatment except in those situations requiring \nemployment of the Sheriff's Emergency Response Team (\"SERT\") where member of the SERT team \nshall escort the inmate to the medical unit (or NUMC).  \n     84.   NCCC shall develop and implement written policies and procedures for investigating and \ntracking injuries to inmates. Such procedures shall include, at a minimum, requirements that designated \ncorrectional personnel: review each such injury report; interview inmates who refuse or are unable to \nsign the section of the form describing the cause of the injury; conduct full investigation where an \ninmate's injuries are inconsistent with the claimed basis for the injury; and conduct full investigation \nwhere the reporting correctional staff member is one whose name is reported on the quarterly report \ndescribed in paragraph 107. \n     85.    NCCC shall require medical personnel to record all injuries and report suspicious injuries (e.g., \nunexplained, serious or multiple injuries to an inmate; injuries resulting in the inmate being hospitalized \nand injuries involving the inmate's head or genital areas; body welts) directly to the Sheriff or his \ndesignee. In such instances, the Sheriff or his designee shall take prompt steps to document the injury \nthrough photographic or recording devices. NCCC shall maintain enough working cameras to record \nsuch injuries, and shall identify and preserve all such evidence as part of the investigative package, i.e., \nall reports and evidence.  \n     86.    Immediately following a use of force, the Tour Commander shall ensure that all relevant \nevidence, including weapons and contraband, is collected, tagged, identified and stored, and that, where \nnecessary, the scene of the incident is photographed. All evidence relating to the incident shall be \nproperly stored and preserved for three (3) years.  \n      87.   The Tour Commander will review all use of force reports, including the videotape, if the \nincident was recorded. The Tour Commander will submit a use of force report to the appropriate captain. \nThe captain will review the use of force reports and record his or her conclusions or recommendations \non a form to be forwarded to the appropriate Deputy Undersheriff and the SBI within seven (7) business \ndays of the incident. \n     88.

The \nDeputy Undersheriff for Investigations shall direct the report's author(s) to promptly complete \nincomplete reports, or shall conduct an interview and note the party's responses where clarification or \nadditional information is needed. SBI shall maintain all versions of the report. During this review, the \nDeputy Undersheriff for Investigations or his designee shall take appropriate steps to ensure that \nphysical evidence subject to destruction or loss or medical evidence subject to change is or has been \ninvestigated and to check the possible discharge dates of inmate witnesses to ensure that such witnesses \nare interviewed timely.  \n      89.    NCCC shall develop and implement policies and procedures for promptly removing staff from \ncontact posts, where appropriate, following a use of force incident which indicates that the use of force \nmay have been excessive or unnecessary. \n      90.

The committee shall (1) write a report of each review; (2) timely refer all \nsuspicious use of force reports to the SBI for investigation including, but not limited to, incidents \ninvolving unexplained, serious or multiple injuries to an inmate; incidents resulting in the inmate being \nhospitalized and incidents involving impact strikes to the inmate's head or genital areas; and (3) for any \nuse of force not compliant with policy, recommend taking appropriate steps to impose discipline, \ntraining, or other remedial measures. \n      F.    Investigations  \n      91.    SBI shall review all use of force investigative packages to determine whether further \ninvestigation by SBI is necessary. NCCC shall develop and implement reasonable criteria by which SBI \nshall make this determination, including, but not limited to, whether the use of force: (1) suggests a \npossible violation of NCCC policy; (2) involved staff who have been disciplined or are or have been the \nsubject of any disciplinary, criminal or civil proceedings based on an alleged use of excessive force or \nfailure to properly report such incidents or, have previously had two or more complaints of unnecessary \nor excessive use of force filed against them; (3) involved an inmate charged with or convicted of a sex \ncrime or crimes against law enforcement personnel or children; (4) involved retaliation against an \ninmate who previously filed a use of force complaint; (5) involved kicks, strikes or blows to the head or \nother vital areas of an inmate's body; and (6) involved injuries to an inmate that are inconsistent with the \nclaimed basis for the injury. Where SBI determines that no further investigation is necessary, it shall set \nforth the reason(s) for that decision in writing. To the extent that SBI determines that any investigation \nreveals issues that should be addressed through additional training or otherwise, it shall make \nappropriate referrals of the matter to NCCC supervisory and/or training staff. Notwithstanding the \nforegoing, SBI shall investigate all allegations of unnecessary or excessive use of force: (1) reported to \nSBI by inmates or third parties that were not previously reported to the facility; (2) found to be \nsubstantiated by the investigating Sergeant or Tour Commander; and (3) referred to SBI by the \ncommittee described in paragraph 90.  \n      92.    SBI shall review all grievances alleging unnecessary or excessive force and transmit such \ngrievances to the appropriate correctional staff, e.g., supervisory sergeant or Tour Commander, for \ninvestigation. The investigation shall be conducted pursuant to the procedure set forth in paragraph 80, \nincluding, but not limited to, the assignment of an uninvolved sergeant to conduct the investigation. SBI \nshall thereafter review the investigatory package generated from the grievance in accordance with the \nprocedure set forth in paragraph 91. \n     93.   All SBI investigations of the use of unnecessary or excessive force shall be completed within \nsixty (60) days. The basis for any delays exceeding sixty (60) days shall be documented. The \nUndersheriff for Investigations shall maintain records tracking the timing of investigations.  \n      94.    SBI shall interview all staff and inmate participants and witnesses. Exceptions to this \nrequirement shall be contained in a detailed written protocol established by the NCCC and the Nassau \nCounty District Attorney's Office. If the matter becomes the subject of a criminal investigation SBI shall \ninterview the correctional staff member(s) within ten (10) working days of notification of the closing of \nthe criminal investigation and shall gather all non-grand jury evidence collected or obtained during the \nDistrict Attorney's investigation. \n     95.    SBI shall produce explicit and comprehensive findings as to each use of force investigation \ninitiated pursuant to paragraph 91, resolving, when possible, disputed matters with reference to \nparticular evidence in the investigative file. \n     96.
