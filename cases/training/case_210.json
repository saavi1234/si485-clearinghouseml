    "summary": "<p>On July 29, 1996, a previous pretrial detainee at the Nassau county Correctional Center (NCCC) filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the County Sheriff, an unnamed assistant district attorney, and a family court judge alleging excessive use of force, unconstitutional strip search, false arrest, abuse of process, and malicious prosecution. He also sought a declaration that New York State Family Court Act &sect; 155(2) which allowed his overnight incarceration without bail, was unconstitutional. On April 16, 1997, the court (Judge Leonard Wexler) entered a stipulated order dismissing all claims against the family court judge who had arraigned the plaintiff and remanded him to the NCCC without bail, but left the judge as a defendant in name only to permit the challenge to &sect;155(2) to proceed. On January 9, 1998, the court (Judge Wexler) sua sponte dismissed the family court judge as a defendant. On December 31, 1998, the defendants moved for summary judgment on all of the plaintiff's claims, and plaintiff made a cross motion for summary judgment. In an oral decision the court (Judge Wexler) granted the motion to dismiss the claims of false arrest, malicious prosecution, and abuse of process claims--reserving the excessive force and strip search claims for trial.</p><p>On June 1, 1999, while trial on the excessive force issue was being held, the court (Judge Wexler) granted summary judgment in plaintiff's favor on the unconstitutional strip search issue. Shain v. Ellison, 53 F.Supp.2d 564 (E.D.N.Y. 1999). The court found that the Fourteenth Amendment unequivocally precludes prison officials from performing strip searches on arrestees charged with minor offenses without a reasonable suspicion that the person is concealing a weapon or contraband. The court also found that the defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity because the unconstitutionality of a blanket strip search policy had been clearly established as far back as 1986.</p><p>A jury rejected the plaintiff's excessive force claim and awarded no damages for the strip search. Plaintiff moved to set aside the verdict and asked for a new trial. On November 12, 1999, the court (Judge Wexler) denied the motion and awarded plaintiff $1 in nominal damages for the strip search claim.</p><p>The defendants and the plaintiff appealed. On October 19, 2001, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals (Judge Rosemary Pooler) found that the strip search policy was unconstitutional and that the law was clearly established, therefore the defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity. Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56 (2nd Cir. 2001). The court also found that the plaintiff had standing, that the district court's denial of a new trial on damages was not error, and that the district court's dismissal of the false arrest, abuse of process, and excessive force claims were proper. As to the &sect; 155(2) claim, the court found that the district court was not in error by dismissing the district judge as a defendant because there was no realistic danger that the plaintiff would face the same harm again. Finally, the court found that although the plaintiff requested an injunction against future enforcement of the blanket strip search policy, the district court had neither granted or denied the request and therefore remanded to the district court to make the necessary findings.</p><p>On September 17, 2002, the district court (Judge Wexler) enjoined the defendants from enforcing a blanket strip search policy. Both the plaintiff and the defendants appealed. On January 20, 2004 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals (Judge Barrington Daniels Parker Jr.) vacated the injunction because the plaintiff lacked standing to seek injunctive relief. Shain v. Ellison, 356 F.3d 211 (2nd Cir. 2004). The case was remanded to the district court with instructions to vacate for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The plaintiffs made a motion for attorney's fees and on December 20, 2004, the district court (Judge Wexler) entered a stipulated order for the settlement of attorney's fees. The PACER docket for the district court ends on December 20, 2004. We have no further proceedings or opinions for this case. </p><p></p>",

      "text": "53 F.Supp.2d 564 (1999)\nRay E. SHAIN, Plaintiff,\nv.\n\"John\" ELLISON (Shield No. 761), et al., Defendants.\nNo. CV 96-3774.\nUnited States District Court, E.D. New York.\nJune 1, 1999.\nHerbst & Greenwald LLP, New York City, by Robert L. Herbst, for plaintiff.\nSnitow & Cunningham, LLP, New York City, by Paul F. Millus, for defendant.\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\nWEXLER, District Judge.\nThis is a civil rights case brought by an individual who was arrested by Nassau County Police Officers and\nthereafter spent a night in the Nassau County Correctional Center (\"NCCC\"). Plaintiff states that he was the\n565 victim of the use of excessive force and that he was subject to an unconstitutional strip search.[1] The excessive \n*565 force issue is presently pending before the court and is scheduled for trial. The court rules herein on\nplaintiff's motion for summary judgment regarding the constitutionality of Nassau County's strip search policy.\nFor the reasons set forth below, the court holds that plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment on the claim that the\nNassau County strip search policy, which requires a strip/visual body cavity search of all prisoners remanded to\ncustody of the NCCC, is unconstitutional. While the court is mindful and, indeed, sympathetic, to the legitimate\nsecurity and safety needs expressed by the Nassau County Sheriff, the court is constrained by clear precedent\nholding that a blanket strip search policy, such as that practiced by Nassau County, violates the Constitution.\nBACKGROUND\nI. Plaintiff's Arrest\nPlaintiff was arrested by Nassau County police officers responding to a call placed by plaintiff's wife concerning a\ndomestic dispute. While some facts are contested, it is clear that at the time of the call plaintiff and his wife were\nembroiled in divorce proceedings. Although plaintiff was living in the same house as his wife, an order of\nprotection, which had expired the day before the police were called to the residence, required, inter alia, plaintiff\nand his wife to occupy separate portions of the home.\nAmong the police officers responding to the domestic dispute call was defendant police officer Ellison. Because it\nis unnecessary, for the purposes of this ruling, to discuss the specific facts surrounding Plaintiff's arrest, the court\nwill state here only that plaintiff was arrested and subsequently remanded by a Nassau County District Court\nJudge to the custody of the Nassau County Sheriff at the NCCC.\nII. Plaintiff's Search at the NCCC\nUpon arrival at the NCCC plaintiff was subject to that facility's procedures regarding all newly admitted prisoners.\nThere are no questions of material fact regarding the policy for admission of new inmates to the NCCC. The\n[2]\nSheriff of Nassau County was deposed and testified that all individuals entering the NCCC are strip searched.\n\nAdditionally, the court has been provided with copies of the written procedure and has considered briefs,\narguments of counsel and has heard testimony regarding the procedure. The procedure at issue is as follows.\nAll prisoners remanded to the NCCC are subject to a strip/visual body cavity search. The procedure makes no\ndistinctions based upon the nature of the crime charged or the circumstances surrounding the particular arrest. It\nmatters not whether a newly admitted prisoner has been remanded after a misdemeanor charge or a violent\nfelony or drug charge. Indeed, while the NCCC is provided with papers indicating the crime with which the inmate\nhas been charged, the officer performing the search has no information regarding the circumstances surrounding\nthe inmate's remand to the NCCC. Nor are officers at the NCCC provided with information indicating whether\nthere is a reasonable suspicion as to whether a particular inmate may be concealing contraband. The provision of\nsuch information is immaterial, however, since all inmates are subject to the search.\nWhile plaintiff takes issue with the privacy with which the search is carried out, there is little question as to the\n566 actual procedures followed. All prisoners are told to disrobe completely. They are told *566 to run their fingers\nthrough their hair. A police officer inspects under the prisoner's arms, behind the prisoner's ears and in the\nprisoner's mouth. The prisoner is told to squat to facilitate a visual inspection of his buttocks. Male inmates are\ninstructed to lift their genitals for a further visual inspection. At no time during this inspection are the prisoners\ntouched 00 the body cavity search is strictly visual.\n97\nThe police officer performing the search of plaintiff testified that the search took approximately one minute.\nAffidavit testimony attached to defendants' papers indicate that the search takes approximately two minutes.\nPlaintiff states that the search took approximately fifteen minutes. The court is confident that the actual inspection\ntime lies somewhere in between these three estimates 00 any factual dispute concerning this issue, however is\n97\nnot material to the present motion.\nDISCUSSION\nI. Summary Judgment Standards\nA motion for summary judgment may not be granted unless the court determines that no genuine issue of\nmaterial fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c); Celotex\nCorp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477\nU.S. 242, 250, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); Donahue v. Windsor Locks Bd. of Fire Comm'rs, 834 F.2d\n54, 57 (2d Cir.1987). Because there is no factual dispute as to the strip search procedure, this case is properly\n[3]\nresolved in the context of a motion for summary judgment.\nII. The Constitutionality of Strip Searches\nThirteen years before this opinion and eleven years before plaintiff was arrested, the Second Circuit held clearly\nand unequivocally that the Fourth Amendment precludes prison officials from performing strip searches of\narrestees charged with misdemeanor or minor offenses absent a reasonable suspicion that the person being\nsearched is concealing weapons or other contraband. The suspicion can be based upon the crime charged or the\ncircumstances surrounding the particular arrest. See Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 802 (2d Cir.1986),cert. denied,\n483 U.S. 1020, 107 S.Ct. 3263, 97 L.Ed.2d 762 (1987). Any policy authorizing blanket strip searching of\narrestees. without the required reasonable suspicion, is unconstitutional. Id. at 802.\nNot only did the Second Circuit hold such blanket search policies unconstitutional in 1986, but the court further\nheld that the constitutional right to be free from such searches was so clearly established, even in 1986, so as to\npreclude the Sheriff who established the county jail policy from invoking the defense of qualified immunity, Weber,\n804 F.2d at 803.\nThe unconstitutionality of a blanket strip search policy was again made clear in 1988 when the Second Circuit\ndecided Walsh v. Franco, 849 F.2d 66 (2d Cir.1988). In Walsh, the Second Circuit affirmed the district court's\n\ndenial of a qualified immunity defense in a case involving the policy of the Chittendon County jail in Vermont. \nWalsh reiterated the holding of Weber and held, again, that the Fourth Amendment prohibits a blanket policy\ncalling for strip searches of all misdemeanor or minor offense arrestees admitted to jail.\nRelying on the fact that the unconstitutionality of a blanket strip search policy was sufficiently established in \n567 Weber so as to preclude a qualified immunity defense, *567 the Second Circuit in Walsh had no trouble holding\nagain in 1988 that defendants were not entitled to claim qualified immunity. Walsh, 849 F.2d at 69-70.\nIII. The Nassau County Policy\nIt is against this backdrop of clear appellate authority that this court has been asked to consider the\nconstitutionality of the Nassau County policy of strip searching all individuals remanded to the custody of the\nNassau County Correctional Center. While the Nassau County defendants have come forward with much\nevidence they wish this court to consider with regard to security concerns allegedly particular to the Nassau\nCounty facility, they do not deny that the strip searching policy is applied without regard to the circumstances\nsurrounding particular arrests or the crime with which the arrestee has been charged.\nIn Weber and Walsh, the Second Circuit made clear that strip searches may be justified only by focusing on the\nparticular arrest 00 whether it be the nature the crime charged or the circumstances surrounding the arrest 00 and\n97 97\nnot on factors relating to the correctional facility. The Second Circuit has specifically rejected the argument that\nthe mixing of arrestees along with the general jail population justifies a blanket strip search policy. Unwilling to\nconsider generalized security concerns as justification for a blanket policy, the Second Circuit held that \"the risk\nof a misdemeanor arrestee's introducing contraband into the general jail population simply did not warrant a strip\nsearch of all arrestees....\" Walsh, 849 F.2d at 69. In light of this precedent, this court is precluded from\nconsidering the institutional concerns of the NCCC. This precedent further requires that this court find that the\nNassau County strip search policy, which exists without the requirement of any suspicion, is unconstitutional.\nIV. County Liability\nNassau County may be liable for civil rights violations if the unconstitutional act resulting in plaintiff's injuries is,\n\"[t]he execution of a government's policy or custom, whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts\nand acts may fairly be said to represent official policy....\" Monell v. Dep't of Social Serv., 436 U.S. 658, 694, 98\nS.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978); Weber, 804 F.2d at 803,Scott v. County of Nassau, 1998 WL 874840\n(E.D.N.Y.1998).\nHere, as in Weber, there is no question but that the act of the Nassau County Sheriff, in establishing and\nmaintaining policies regarding the searching of individuals at the NCCC, amounts to the official policy of Nassau\nCounty. Accordingly, the county may be liable for injuries resulting from the execution of this policy.\nV. Qualified Immunity\nDefendants seek to invoke the defense of qualified immunity on behalf of the Nassau County Sheriff. As noted\nabove, the Second Circuit held, as early as 1986, that the defense of qualified immunity was not available in\ncases involving blanket strip search policies. See Weber, 804 F.2d at 803. The unconstitutionality of a policy such\nas that in effect at the NCCC was clearly established at the time of plaintiff's arrest. Officials such as the Sheriff,\nare held to have \"constructive knowledge of established law.\" Walsh, 849 F.2d at 69 (quoting Salahuddin v.\nCoughlin, 781 F.2d 24, 27 (2d Cir.1986)). Under the circumstances present here, it cannot be established that it\nwas objectively reasonable to believe that a strip search of plaintiff was warranted. Accordingly, the Nassau\nCounty Sheriff is not entitled to the defense of qualified immunity.\n\nVI. Institutional Concerns At The NCCC\nThe court would be remiss if summary judgment were granted and the challenged practice condemned, without\nsetting forth certain facts concerning the NCCC which gave this court great pause in striking down that facility's\n568 procedures. Had this *568 court the latitude to consider these concerns, the outcome of this motion may well\nhave been different.\nApproximately 1,100 individuals are employed at the NCCC, 950 of whom are corrections officers. The facility\nhouses approximately 1,800 inmates on any given day. These inmates arrive at the NCCC, in their street clothes,\nfrom a variety of places throughout Nassau County. Each year, approximately 14,000 inmates are processed for\nintroduction to the NCCC. Upon arrival at the NCCC, the corrections officer has available the history of the\ninmate's offenses (if any) as well as a notation explaining the reason the inmate is being held and commitment\npapers noting the remand from a judge.\nInmates at the NCCC are either awaiting trial or have been sentenced. They include those charged and/or\nconvicted of crimes ranging from murder and rape to non-violent offenders. According to defendants, the NCCC\nalso houses members of identifiable gangs.\nThe court has reviewed defendants' submissions regarding security concerns and notes the difficulty in\nmaintaining a safe facility. According to defendant's submissions (which the court recognizes have not been\nsubject to cross-examination), a random search of inmate files revealed that in the past two years there have\nbeen six occasions when an inmate was found to have various weapons during a strip search and eight\noccasions when the initial strip search revealed concealed drugs. While these numbers are not very high, when\ncompared to the number of inmates coming through the facility, the dangers posed by concealed weapons in a\nfacility such as the NCCC are indeed great.\nCorrections officers at the NCCC are concerned not only with protecting themselves and other employees, but\nwith protecting the safety of other inmates. Indeed, a failure to properly protect inmates may well result in the\nimposition of civil liability.\nWhile the court is clear that the precedent established by Weber, and reiterated in Walsh, precludes this court\nfrom upholding a blanket strip search policy in the absence of reasonable suspicion regarding the arrest, the\ncourt notes that the prison facilities at issue in both Weber and Walsh were undoubtably different, in many\nimportant respects, from the facility at issue here. While the court does not profess to have an intimate\nknowledge of the inner workings of the Monroe County, Rochester jail (at issue in Weber) or the Chittenden\nCounty, Vermont jail (at issue in Walsh), or even of the size of those facilities, the court questions whether the\ninstitutional concerns present at the NCCC can be fairly compared to these facilities.\nIn sum, a full consideration of the facts surrounding the NCCC and its particular concerns may have resulted in a\nfinding that a one or two minute strip search conducted in privacy might well be warranted when balanced against\nthe concerns of this particular institution. The court makes no finding as to the proper outcome of this balance.\nCertainly, it would have been necessary to take additional testimony and have each party present their side of the\nstory. Given the state of the law, however, the court could not properly consider this evidence.\nCONCLUSION\nThe policy of strip searching all misdemeanor and minor offense arrestees remanded to the NCCC, without\nrequiring any suspicion that the remanded individual is concealing weapons or other contraband, violates the\nFourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment with regard to the\nstrip searching policy in effect at the Nassau County Correctional Center is granted.\nSO ORDERED.\n\n[1] Plaintiff's complaint also contained allegations of false arrest, abuse of process and malicious prosecution.\nThese claims have been previously dismissed by prior order of this court.\n[2] The court herein uses the term \"strip search\" interchangeably with \"strip/visual body cavity search.\" Both\nterms refer to searches involving the removal of all clothes and a visual inspection of body cavities. Neither term\nrefers to a search involving any touching of the person being stripped. The searches discussed in the Second\nCircuit cases referred to herein appear to have been the same type of search at issue here.\n[3] Defendant's brief argued that there was reasonable suspicion to carry out a strip search of plaintiff based\nupon the nature of the crime charged and the fact that plaintiff was found carrying a small knife. Defendant's\nconceded, however, that when plaintiff was strip searched at the NCCC, the officers at that facility had no\ninformation whatever regarding the nature of plaintiff's arrest or the crime with which he was charged.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

The court enjoined Nassau County from\n213 strip searching misdemeanor admittees to the Nassau County *213 Correctional Center (\"NCCC\") absent\nindividualized suspicion that they were concealing weapons or contraband. Because we conclude that appellee\nRay E. Shain lacked standing to seek such injunctive relief, we vacate the injunction and remand with instructions\nto dismiss Shain's claim for injunctive relief for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\nI. BACKGROUND\nAs this case comes to us a second time, we offer an abbreviated version of the facts detailed in Shain v. Ellison,\n273 F.3d 56 (2d Cir.2001). Shain was arrested by Nassau County police in July 1995 after his then-wife reported\nthat he had threatened violence during a domestic dispute. He was arraigned in court on misdemeanor charges\n[1]\nand remanded to the NCCC.  Upon his arrival, Shain was subjected to a strip/visual cavity search pursuant to a\npolicy in place at the institution at that time which required all admittees to be stripped and searched regardless\nof the severity of the charge or whether the admittee was suspected of concealing a weapon or contraband.\nShain was strip searched again the next day prior to an appearance in Nassau County Family Court. Eventually,\nthe charges against him were withdrawn or adjourned in contemplation of dismissal.\nIn 1996, Shain sued Nassau County under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 alleging that the blanket strip search policy violated\nthe Fourth Amendment. He also asserted a number of state law tort claims. He sought money damages, a\ndeclaration that the policy was unconstitutional, and \"an order enjoining such blanket strip searches and body\ncavity inspections and regulating the conditions and circumstances under which such searches and inspections\ncan be conducted pursuant to guidelines to be set by the Court.\" At no point in front of the District Court did Shain\naver a likelihood that in the future he might again be exposed to the policy.\nNassau County moved for summary judgment, contending, among other things, that the individual defendants\nwere entitled to qualified immunity. Shain cross-moved for partial summary judgment challenging the\nconstitutionality of the strip search policy. The District Court granted Shain partial summary judgment, concluding\n\nthat under clearly established federal law, the strip search was unconstitutional and that, consequently, the\n[2]\nindividual officers were not entitled to qualified immunity. Shain v. Ellison, 53 F.Supp.2d 564 (S.D.N.Y.1999).\nThe court rejected Nassau County's claim that the reasonableness of a strip search policy had to be judged in\nlight of institutional concerns, concluding that such searches could only be justified by focusing on the nature of\nthe crime or the circumstances surrounding the arrest but not on institutional priorities. Id. at 567. Eventually the\n214 case went to trial *214 where Shain received a nominal monetary damage award and a declaration that the policy\nwas unconstitutional.\nOn appeal, we affirmed in part and remanded in part. Shain, 273 F.3d at 66-67. We held that our clearly\nestablished Fourth Amendment precedent 00 notably Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796 (2d Cir.1986), and Walsh v.\n97\nFranco, 849 F.2d 66 (2d Cir.1988) 00 precluded jails from strip searching misdemeanor arrestees absent a\n97\n[3]\nreasonable suspicion that weapons or other contraband were concealed. Id. at 66. This conclusion meant that\nthe individual defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity. Although we affirmed the District Court's\ndeclaration that the strip search policy was unconstitutional, we noted that the District Court's judgment \"neither\nexplicitly granted nor denied\" Shain's request for injunctive relief and \"the record before us [was] not adequate to\ndetermine whether injunctive relief [was] necessary.\" Id. at 67. Therefore, we remanded \"to allow the district court\nto make the necessary findings and conclusions\" pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). Id.\nOn remand, Shain argued that he possessed adequate standing because the official nature of the policy created\nthe prospect that, were he to be subsequently arrested, he would again be treated in an unconstitutional manner.\nWithout addressing the standing issue, the District Court granted an injunction:\nDefendants Nassau County and all of its employees and agents are hereby enjoined from\neffectuating any blanket policy at the Nassau County Correctional Center whereby all individuals\nremanded to that institution are subject to a strip, visual body cavity, or any more invasive search,\nabsent a reasonable suspicion that such individual is concealing weapons or other contraband.\nNassau County appeals, arguing that: (1) Shain lacks standing to seek injunctive relief, (2) the injunction violates\nthe Prison Litigation Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3626 et seq., and (3) the issue of injunctive relief has become moot\nbecause, in the interim, the County had officially ended its blanket strip search policy. As explained below, we find\nthat since Shain has not met his burden of demonstrating standing to seek injunctive relief, the federal courts lack\nsubject matter jurisdiction over his claim for such relief.\nII. DISCUSSION\nA. Standard of Review\nWe review a district court's grant of a permanent injunction for abuse of discretion. S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc. v.\nClorox Co., 241 F.3d 232, 237 (2d Cir.2001). A district court abuses its discretion when it rests its decision on a\nclearly erroneous finding of fact or makes an error of law. Id. The existence of standing is a question of law that\nwe review de novo. Benjamin v. Fraser, 343 F.3d 35, 43 (2d Cir.2003).\nB. Standing\n215 At this stage of the litigation, neither party contests the fact that Shain suffered an unconstitutional strip search \n*215 and, consequently, had standing to seek appropriate monetary and declaratory relief. Additionally, our\nprevious holding that the strip search policy is unconstitutional was necessarily antecedent to our affirming of the\ndamages award and, therefore, remains the law of the case. But whether Shain has standing to seek injunctive\nrelief is a different matter. If Shain lacks standing, we lack subject matter jurisdiction to entertain a request for\nsuch relief. Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 154-55, 110 S.Ct. 1717, 109 L.Ed.2d 135 (1990). In order to\nmeet the constitutional minimum of standing to seek injunctive relief, Shain must carry the burden of establishing\nthat \"he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as the result of the challenged\nofficial conduct.\" City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 101-102, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983)\n\n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). In doing this, he \"cannot rely on past injury to satisfy the injury\nrequirement but must show a likelihood that he ... will be injured in the future.\" Deshawn E. by Charlotte E. v.\nSafir, 156 F.3d 340, 344 (2d Cir.1998); see also O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 495-96, 94 S.Ct. 669, 38\nL.Ed.2d 674 (1974) (holding that \"[p]ast exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show a present case or\ncontroversy regarding injunctive relief ... if unaccompanied by any continuing, present adverse effects\"). Finally,\nabstract injury is not enough; rather, \"[t]he injury or threat of injury must be both `real and immediate,' not\n`conjectural' or `hypothetical.'\" O'Shea, 414 U.S. at 494, 94 S.Ct. 669; Golden v. Zwickler, 394 U.S. 103, 110, 89\nS.Ct. 956, 22 L.Ed.2d 113 (1969).\nCity of Los Angeles v. Lyons occupies much of this territory. There, the Supreme Court held that Lyons, who was\nplaced in a chokehold by a Los Angeles police officer during a minor traffic stop, did not have standing to seek\nprospective injunctive relief barring police officers from indiscriminately using chokeholds. While past injury\nsupplied a predicate for compensatory damages, it did not, according to the Court, supply one for prospective\nequitable relief since the fact that such practices had been used in the past did not translate into a real and\nimmediate threat of future injury to Lyons. Lyons, 461 U.S. at 105-106, 103 S.Ct. 1660.\nSimilarly, Shain has not established 00 or even alleged before this appeal 00 the likelihood of a future encounter\n97 97\nwith the Nassau County police likely to result in a subsequent unconstitutional strip search. At the time of his\narrest in 1995, Shain was an attorney admitted to the bar. He had no criminal record and, indeed, had never been\narrested outside the context of his contentious divorce proceedings. Although he makes the conclusory claim\nthat, at the time his lawsuit was filed, he was not long removed from acrimonious divorce proceedings, he makes\nno claim of any ongoing marital discord that might give rise to the fear of a repeat encounter with police officers.\nIn fact, in the year between his arrest and his lawsuit, Shain was not rearrested, nor does he allege that he had\nany further encounters with the police. Significantly, at the time of the lawsuit, he was no longer married to or\nliving with his ex-wife. Finally, even if Shain were arrested again on a misdemeanor charge, it is entirely\nconjectural that he would be detained overnight and remanded to the NCCC, as almost all misdemeanor\narrestees are released on their own recognizance or on bail. These facts suggest to us that Shain was no more\nlikely to be subject to misdemeanor arrest and detainment than any other citizen of Nassau County. As the Court\nstated in Lyons:\n216 *216 Absent a sufficient likelihood that he will again be wronged in a similar way, Lyons is no more\nentitled to an injunction that any other citizen of Los Angeles; and a federal court may not entertain\na claim by any or all citizens who no more than assert that certain practices of law enforcement\nare unconstitutional.\nId. at 111, 103 S.Ct. 1660. Under Lyons, to establish a sufficient likelihood of a future unconstitutional strip\nsearch, Shain would have to show that if he is arrested in Nassau County and if the arrest is for a misdemeanor\nand if he is not released on bail and if he is remanded to NCCC and if there is no particularized reasonable\nsuspicion that he is concealing contraband, he will again be strip searched. Such an accumulation of inferences\nis simply too speculative and conjectural to supply a predicate for prospective injunctive relief. O'Shea, 414 U.S.\nat 497, 94 S.Ct. 669.\nShain's reliance on Deshawn E. is misplaced. There, we held that a class of minors had standing to seek\ninjunctive relief barring a squad of detectives from taking such minors into custody in the future and interrogating\nthem without the benefit of counsel. Although we noted in Deshawn E. that appellants were objecting to an official\ngovernmental policy, we did not in any way suggest that the existence of an official policy, on its own, is sufficient\nto confer standing to sue on any individual who had previously been subjected to that policy. To the contrary, we\nexplained that, unlike the plaintiff in Lyons, the class of minors in Deshawn E. had demonstrated a sufficient\nlikelihood of future harm at the hands of New York's police department based on allegations that statements\nmade during unlawful interrogations were used to enhance charges in ongoing proceedings and as leverage in\nplea negotiations. Deshawn E.,156 F.3d at 344-45. Deshawn E. thus suggests 00 and Lyons confirms 00 that a\n97 97\nplaintiff seeking injunctive relief must demonstrate both a likelihood of future harm and the existence of an official\npolicy or its equivalent. See Lyons, 461 U.S. at 105-06, 103 S.Ct. 1660 (stating that \"[i]n order to establish an\nactual controversy in this case, Lyons would have had not only to allege that he would have another encounter\nwith the police but also\" to allege the existence of an official policy or its equivalent). Here, Shain has failed to\n\ndemonstrate a likelihood of future harm and therefore, even if he was subjected to an official policy, he lacks\nstanding to seek injunctive relief.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nFor these reasons, we vacate the injunction and remand to the District Court with instructions to dismiss for lack\nof subject-matter jurisdiction. We therefore do not reach appellant's other claims on appeal.\n[*] The Honorable Jed S. Rakoff, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York, sitting by\ndesignation.\n[1] New York law generally provides that a misdemeanor arrestee, after being arraigned, must be released on his\nown recognizance or allowed to post bail. N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW ยง 170.10(7) (Consol.2003). However, under\nNew York family law, an arraigning magistrate has the discretion to remand the misdemeanor arrestee to the\ncustody of the sheriff when the alleged offense is a family offense. N.Y. FAM. CT. ACT ยง 155 (Consol.2003).\n[2] Shain had also initially filed claims of false arrest and imprisonment, abuse of process, malicious prosecution,\nand excessive force. The first three claims were dismissed by the District Court on Nassau County's summary\njudgment motion while the excessive force claim went to trial. It was ultimately rejected by the jury. The court\ndeclared the strip search policy to be unconstitutional and awarded Shain $1 in nominal damages. Shain, 273\nF.3d at 62.\n[3] We held that even though the Supreme Court, in Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64\n(1987), had established that a reasonable relation to a legitimate penological interest is sufficient to prove the\nconstitutionality of a prison regulation, such a test was not relevant in Shain because the NCCC was a local jail\nand not a prison within the meaning of Turner. Shain, 273 F.3d at 65. But see Shain, 273 F.3d at 70 (Cabranes,\nJ., dissenting) (arguing that Turner's \"reasonably related to legitimate penological interests\" standard should\napply here to assess the NCCC's blanket strip search policy).\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

We hold that after this court's decisions in Wachtler v. County of\nHerkimer, 35 F.3d 77 (2d Cir.1994),Walsh v. Franco, 849 F.2d 66 (2d Cir.1988), and Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796\n(2d Cir.1986), no law enforcement officer reasonably could have believed that it was permissible to perform such\na search absent individualized reasonable suspicion.\nBACKGROUND\n\nI. Shain's Arrest and Strip Search\n60 On July 29, 1995, Nassau County police *60 officers including Peter Ellison[1] responded to a 911 call from Dr.\nDonna Denier, who was then married to plaintiff Ray Shain, at the couple's residence. Denier showed Ellison a\nrecently expired order of protection that required Shain to stay out of her bedroom. When Ellison realized that he\ncould not arrest Shain for violation of the order of protection, he interviewed Denier because\n[He] wanted to get a clearer picture of exactly what [Shain] did, to see if [he] could arrest him, if\nthere was another charge that [he] could arrest him on besides the order of protection [and after\nthe interview, he] determined that [he] could arrest him minus the order of protection, without it.\nEllison testified that Denier told him Shain entered her room and threatened to rape her and that Ellison then\nbelieved he had probable cause to arrest Shain. In his police report, Ellison said:\nCOMP REPORTS AT TIME AND PLACE OF OCCURRENCE LAYING IN HER BED READING\nWHEN HER HUSBAND ENTERED ROOM. SHE TOLD HIM SEVERAL TIMES TO LEAVE AND\nHE STATED AGAIN, \"I'M GOING TO FUCK YOU\". SHE TOLD HIM TO LEAVE AGAIN AND\nFEARING FOR HER SAFETY SHE LEFT THE ROOM AND CALLED THE POLICE\nDenier gave a more expansive account of her conversation with Ellison, claiming that she also told him that Shain\npreviously had threatened her and been out of control and that he had thrown a table at her and swung a lamp at\nher on prior occasions.\nEllison testified that when he arrested Shain for first degree harassment, a Class B misdemeanor, Shain acted in\nan agitated manner. Shain himself admitted that he did not turn over a pocket knife when he was asked to empty\nhis pockets. After retrieving the pocket knife, Ellison transported Shain to the police station and \"rear-cuffed\" him\nto a manacle in a holding cell. Despite Shain's complaints that he had undergone a spinal fusion as an\nadolescent and was in severe pain, Ellison refused to take the cuffs off or to front cuff Shain. Ultimately, Ellison\nand another officer took Shain to the Nassau County Medical Center where a doctor who examined him reported\nthat Shain was experiencing muscle spasms and lumbar sprain and ordered that he not be cuffed behind his\nback. Ellison spent the balance of the night at the central police station.\nThe next day, Shain appeared before Judge James H. Madden, a District Court judge sitting as a Family Court\njudge, who arraigned Shain on Denier's family offense petition. Without holding a hearing, Judge Madden\nremanded Shain to Nassau County Correctional Center (\"NCCC\") without bond.\nUpon Shain's arrival at NCCC, Officer James Dantunono directed him to remove all his clothes and submit to a\nvisual body cavity search. Dantunono looked in Shain's ears, his mouth, his hair and under his arms, and then\nmade him turn around, bend over and spread his buttocks apart with his hands to facilitate a visual inspection of\nhis rectum. Dantunono also directed Shain to hold up his external genitalia for inspection. Shain was again strip\nsearched the next morning before he left to appear in Family Court. When Shain appeared in court, Family Court\nJudge Norman Feiden released him and allowed him to return to his home. Denier withdrew the Family Court\n61 petition on August 7, 1995. However, on or about August 28, *61 1995, the Nassau County District Attorney's\nOffice filed harassment charges against Shain pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law ยง 240.26. Subsequently, these\ncharges were dismissed pursuant to an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal.\nII. NCCC's Strip Search Policy\nAlthough NCCC claims that it does not subject individuals charged with misdemeanors and minor offenses to a\nstrip search unless it has reasonable suspicion that the arrestees are concealing contraband or they have been\nremanded to NCCC's custody by a court, the written policies governing strip searches require corrections officers\nto strip search each newly admitted inmate. In addition, all of the corrections officials who testified conceded that\nall newly admitted inmates were strip searched regardless of whether they were judicially remanded. Thus, while\narrestees held briefly in holding cells may not have been strip-searched, all arrestees admitted to the jail were.\n\nIII. District Court Proceedings\nShain filed his lawsuit in the Eastern District of New York on July 29, 1996. In a second amended complaint dated\nJuly 7, 1997, Shain named Ellison; Judge Madden; \"John Doe,\" an assistant district attorney; Joseph Jablonsky,\nthe Sheriff of Nassau County; the County of Nassau and various anonymous corrections officers as defendants\nand requested damages for false arrest and imprisonment, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, the\nunconstitutional search of his person, assault and battery, and negligent and intentional infliction of emotional\ndistress. He also sought a declaration that New York State Family Court Act ยง 155(2), which allowed his overnight\nincarceration without bail, and NCCC's strip search policy were unconstitutional and an injunction against their\nenforcement.\nOn April 16, 1997, by stipulation and order, the district court dismissed all claims against Judge Madden, leaving\nhim as a defendant in name only to permit Shain to continue his challenge to Section 155(2). On January 9,\n1998, the district court sua sponte dismissed Judge Madden as a defendant, finding that \"[p]laintiff may not\ndiscontinue all claims against Judge Madden yet proceed to use him as a straw man to secure what is, in\nessence, an advisory opinion as to the constitutionality of ยง 155(2) of the Act.\"\nOn December 31, 1998, defendants moved for summary judgment on all of Shain's claims. Shain cross-moved\nfor partial summary judgment establishing the unconstitutionality of NCCC's strip search policy. In an oral\ndecision, Judge Wexler granted defendants' motion to dismiss Shain's false arrest, malicious prosecution, and\nabuse of process claims but reserved the excessive force and strip search claims for trial. In a published opinion\ndated June 1, 1999, Judge Wexler granted Shain partial summary judgment establishing that the strip search\npolicy was unconstitutional and that Jablonsky was not entitled to qualified immunity. See Shain v. Ellison, 53\nF.Supp.2d 564 (E.D.N.Y.1999). More specifically, the court stated:\nThe policy of strip searching all misdemeanor and minor offense arrestees remanded to the\nNCCC, without requiring any suspicion that the remanded individual is concealing weapons or\nother contraband, violates the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\nId. at 568. The court noted that NCCC presented evidence of security problems that might be triggered by an\norder prohibiting it from strip searching all arrestees entering the facility but believed itself prohibited from\n62 considering this evidence *62 by Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796 (2d Cir.1986) and Walsh v. Franco, 849 F.2d 66 (2d\nCir.1988). See id. at 567-68.\nA jury heard Shain's excessive force claim and evidence related to damages on the strip search claim. It rejected\nthe excessive force claim and awarded Shain no damages for the strip search. Shain then moved to set aside the\nverdict and, in the alternative, for a new trial. The court denied Shain's motion and entered a judgment granting\nShain $1.00 in nominal damages, declaring the strip search policy to be unconstitutional, and dismissing the\naction on the merits.\nDefendants County of Nassau and Jablonsky appealed, arguing principally that (1) the district court erred by\nfailing to give proper deference to NCCC's security concerns; (2) Weber and Walsh do not govern this case\nbecause NCCC's policy was limited to arrestees who had been judicially remanded; (3) defendants had\nreasonable suspicion that Shain might be concealing a weapon and thus Shain lacked standing to challenge\nNCCC's general policy; and (4) Jablonsky was entitled to qualified immunity because the law concerning strip\nsearches of misdemeanor pre-trial detainees was unsettled. Shain, who is an attorney, has submitted two briefs\non his cross-appeal. In his counseled brief, Shain defends the district court's strip search holding while arguing\nthat the district court should have granted injunctive relief and a new trial on damages. In his pro se brief, Shain\ncontends that the district court erred by failing to grant him summary judgment on his false arrest claim;\ndismissing the malicious prosecution, abuse of process, and false arrest claims; dismissing his claims against\nJudge Madden and failing to reach the issue of the constitutionality of Section 155(2); and declining to grant a\nnew trial on the excessive force claim.\n\nSeveral Amici Curiae have submitted briefs on the strip search issue. The New York City Department of\nCorrection, which has a strip search policy similar to NCCC's, seeks reversal of the district court's decision. Class\ncounsel for the plaintiffs in Tyson v. City of New York, No. 97 Civ. 3762 (S.D.N.Y.) (JSM), and O'Day v. Nassau\nCounty, 99-CV-2844 (E.D.N.Y.) (DRH)(ARL) primarily request that the court not retreat from Weber and Walsh\ninsofar as these decisions apply to pre-arraignment detainees who are the plaintiffs in these two lawsuits.\nPlaintiff's own counsel, who is also the attorney for the putative class members in Augustin v. Jablonsky,\nCV-00-3126 (E.D.N.Y.) (DRH)(ARL) has submitted a brief on their behalf in opposition to the strip search policy.\nFinally, the Legal Aid Society, which represents incarcerated individuals in New York, also has submitted a brief in\nopposition to NCCC's policy.\nDISCUSSION\nI. Strip Search Policy\nA. Legality and Qualified Immunity\nAlthough it appears likely that NCCC's strip search policy applied to all persons actually admitted to the jail\nwhether they had been arraigned or not, we consider the legality of that policy as it applies to post-arraignment\nadmittees to the jail because Shain himself was a post-arraignment admittee.\nBefore Officer Dantunono searched Shain in July 1995, we had decided three cases relevant to the issue before\nus. In Weber, we considered a Monroe County Jail policy \"calling for strip/body cavity searches of all arrested\npersons other than those placed in `holding cells,' which are the cells in which arrestees are sometimes placed\n63 when their release on bail is imminent.\" Weber, 804 F.2d at 799. The *63 police arrested plaintiff Ann Weber on\nmisdemeanor charges of making a false complaint and resisting arrest. See id. After jail officials booked Weber,\nthey required her to remove her clothing and \"expose her body cavities for visual inspection.\" Id. We held \"that\nthe Fourth Amendment precludes prison officials from performing strip/body cavity searches of arrestees charged\nwith misdemeanors or other minor offenses unless the officials have a reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is\nconcealing weapons or other contraband based on the crime charged, the particular characteristics of the\narrestee, and/or the circumstances of the arrest.\" Id. at 802. Although the defendants argued that their policy\napplied only to arrestees who could not make bail and thus were to be admitted to the general prison population,\nwe found it unnecessary to remand for factual findings because \"even the more narrowly drawn policy would be\nunconstitutional.\" Id. We also rejected defendants' request for qualified immunity because all the circuits that had\naddressed similar policies had found them to be unconstitutional and because we long had stressed the intrusive\nnature of body cavity searches. See id. at 803.\nWalsh reaffirmed the Weber holding, see Walsh, 849 F.2d at 68-69, and Wachtler assumed Weber's applicability\nto the post-arraignment strip search of a person charged only with a misdemeanor. Wachtler, 35 F.3d at 81-82.\nWe also found in Wachtler that the individual defendants were entitled to qualified immunity because the law did\nnot clearly establish whether Wachtler's conduct was sufficient to trigger a reasonable suspicion. Id. at 81-82.\nHowever, we reinstated Wachtler's claims against the County of Herkimer pending a fuller development of the\nrecord. See id at 82. We said with respect to the County:\nIf the standard procedure included routine strip-searches of misdemeanor arrestees, absent\nreasonable suspicion of weapons or contraband, and if no reasonable suspicion concerning\nWachtler's possession of such items existed, then Wachtler would prevail.\nId. (citing Weber, 804 F.2d at 802-03).\nDefendants contend that Wachtler does not indicate clearly that post-arraignment strip searches of persons\ncharged with a misdemeanor are unconstitutional because the parties did not necessarily argue a distinction\nbetween pre- and post-arraignment searches. Be that as it may, we recognized that Wachtler had been arraigned\nand remanded to custody and nevertheless found that a policy that subjected him to a strip search without\n\nindividualized reasonable suspicion would be unconstitutional. See id. at 79, 82. Because the unconstitutionality\nof a post-arraignment strip search absent reasonable cause was necessary to the court's holding in Wachtler, we\nreject defendants' argument.\nDefendants next argue that we must not read Wachtler to prohibit strip searches of persons arrested for a\nmisdemeanor after they have been arraigned because this reading would conflict with two Supreme Court\ndecisions, Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), and Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S.\n576, 104 S.Ct. 3227, 82 L.Ed.2d 438 (1984). In Bell, the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of a\npolicy that subjected pre-trial detainees to strip searches after a contact visit. It reasoned that \"maintaining\ninstitutional security and preserving internal order and discipline are essential goals that may require limitation or\nretraction of the retained constitutional rights of both convicted prisoners and pretrial detainees.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at\n64 546, 99 S.Ct. 1861. Quoting Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. *64 817, 827, 94 S.Ct. 2800, 41 L.Ed.2d 495 (1974), the\nCourt held that \"in the absence of substantial evidence in the record to indicate that the officials have\nexaggerated their response to these considerations, courts should ordinarily defer to their expert judgment in\nsuch matters.\" Id. at 548, 99 S.Ct. 1861. Applying these principles, the Court upheld a visual, no-contact body\ncavity search of detainees after contact visits with persons from outside the institution. It said, \"assuming for\npresent purposes that ... pretrial detainees ... retain some Fourth Amendment rights upon commitment to a\ncorrections facility, we nonetheless conclude that these searches do not violate that Amendment. The Fourth\nAmendment prohibits only unreasonable searches, and under the circumstances, we do not believe that these\nsearches were unreasonable.\" Id. at 558, 94 S.Ct. 2800 (internal citations omitted).\nIn Block, the Supreme Court upheld jail policies prohibiting contact visits by pre-trial detainees and permitting jail\nauthorities to conduct random searches of cells in the absence of their pre-trial detainee occupants. However, its\nholding rests on a due process analysis and thus adds little to the holding of Bell. See Block, 468 U.S. at 590,\n104 S.Ct. 3227; see also Weber, 804 F.2d at 800.\nIn Weber, we said that Bell did not \"read out of the Constitution the provision of general application that a search\nbe justified as reasonable under the circumstances.\" Weber, 804 F.2d at 800. We also described three factors\npotentially supporting the determination that the Bell plaintiffs had no right to be free of a strip search: they\nalready had been arraigned; they had failed to make bail; and they \"had presumably chosen to receive visitors\nand to enjoy physical contact with them.\" Id. In Wachtler, we implicitly held that the mere fact of arraignment did\nnot remove a misdemeanor arrestee from the purview of Weber and place him within the ambit of Bell. See \nWachtler, 35 F.3d at 79, 82. The Wachtler result is not at odds with Bell. First, the Bell court did not address the\nissue of whether persons charged only with misdemeanors must be treated differently from persons charged with\n[2]\nfelonies.  Second, and more important, Bell authorized strip searches after contact visits, where contraband\noften is passed. See Block, 468 U.S. at 586, 104 S.Ct. 3227. It is far less obvious that misdemeanor arrestees\nfrequently or even occasionally hide contraband in their bodily orifices. Unlike persons already in jail who receive\ncontact visits, arrestees do not ordinarily have notice that they are about to be arrested and thus an opportunity to\nhide something. For the exceptions 00 for example, a person who is allowed to visit the bathroom unescorted\n97\nbefore an arrest 00 reasonable suspicion may well exist.\n97\n65 *65 Finally, defendants argue that arraignment represents a crucial step in criminal proceedings that justifies\nheightened security measures. In Block, the Supreme Court said that \"[t]he very fact of nonrelease pending trial\n... is a significant factor bearing on the security measures that are imperative to proper administration of a\ndetention facility\" because of the ease of obtaining bail or release on one's own recognizance. Block, 468 U.S. at\n583, 104 S.Ct. 3227. The same cannot be said of a misdemeanor arrestee in New York because he must be\nreleased on his own recognizance or granted bail. See N.Y.Crim. Proc. L. ยง 170.10(7). It is only because Denier\nproceeded civilly against Shain in Family Court that the judge could hold him without bail and without considering\nthe statutory factors relevant to criminal detainees despite the fact that he was charged only with a misdemeanor.\nCompare N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act ยง 155(2) with N.Y.Crim. Proc. L. ยง 510.30(2)(a). Although a New York felony\ndefendant's post-arraignment detention may well be an indicator of an increased security risk, a person charged\nwith a misdemeanor who remains in jail in New York after arraignment probably does so because (a) he cannot\nafford the bail set; (b) he refuses to post bail; or (c) he was arraigned on a Family Court matter, see N.Y. Fam. Ct.\nAct. ยง 155, Douglas J. Besharov, Practice Commentary (discussing abuse of Section 155). None of these\nscenarios creates a reasonable suspicion that the alleged offender has secreted contraband or a weapon.\n\nThe dissent, albeit not the defendants or the amicus who supports defendants' position, argues that a separate\nline of Supreme Court cases employing a different analytical model controls the outcome of this appeal. These\ncases hold that a reasonable relation to a legitimate penological interest suffices to establish the constitutionality\nof a prison regulation. Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 223, 110 S.Ct. 1028, 108 L.Ed.2d 178 (1990); O'Lone\nv. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U.S. 342, 349, 107 S.Ct. 2400, 96 L.Ed.2d 282 (1987); Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78,\n87, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987). Between Walsh and Wachtler, we employed the Turner model to\nuphold the legality of a strip search that took place in a prison. Covino v. Patrissi, 967 F.2d 73 (2d Cir.1992).\nCovino, who had been charged with kidnapping a child under the age of sixteen, id. at 74 n. 1, was housed in a\nstate correctional facility where he was commingled with sentenced inmates. Id. at 75. We upheld the pertinent\nregulation, which allowed random strip searches of inmates, despite Covino's pretrial detainee status because\nthe regulation was \"reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.\" Id. at 78 and n. 4. Turner, Washington,\nO'Lone and Covino each approved a regulation of a state correctional facility or prison, but NCCC is a local\ncorrectional facility or jail. A prison is \"[a] state or federal facility of confinement for convicted criminals, esp\n[ecially] felons.\" BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 1213 (7th ed.1999). A jail, on the other hand, is \"[a] place where\npersons awaiting trial or those convicted of misdemeanors are confined.\" Id. at 838. This distinction is reflected in\nNew York where state correctional facilities, commonly referred to as prisons, house those convicted of the most\nserious crimes and local correctional facilities or jails house persons convicted of minor crimes and pre-trial\ndetainees. See N.Y.Crim. Proc. L. ยง 430.20(2),(3); N.Y. Penal L. ยงยง 70.00(1), 70.15.\nDespite the limitation of Turner, Washington, O'Lone, and Covino to prison regulations and the substantial\ndifference between jail and prison populations, the dissent contends that Turner implicitly overruled Weber. We\n66 disagree. We *66 start with the proposition that we have \"no authority to depart from Second Circuit precedent,\nunless it has been overruled in banc or by the Supreme Court.\" Leecan v. Lopes, 893 F.2d 1434, 1443 (2d\nCir.1990). Additionally, we should not lightly assume that two prior cases of this court are inconsistent, and we\nmust accept a plausible reading of a case that renders it consistent with other Second Circuit precedent even\nwhere an alternative reading exists. See, e.g., Rocket Jewelry Box v. Noble Gift Packaging, 157 F.3d 174, 176\n(2d Cir.1998). Neither Turner nor Covino purports to address any issue other than prison regulations. Thus, these\ncases can be read consistently with Weber and its progeny by confining them to their facts and actual holdings.\n[3]\n The dissent's arguments for \"assum[ing] that when the Turner Court developed the `reasonably related'\nstandard, it intended for it to apply to facilities like NCCC\" may be relevant to whether the Turner line of cases\nshould be extended to jails by the Supreme Court, but they are not relevant to the question of whether Turner\noverruled Weber. [Dissent, infra, at 74]\nThe district court therefore correctly held that because it was clearly established in 1995 that persons charged\nwith a misdemeanor and remanded to a local correctional facility like NCCC have a right to be free of a strip\nsearch absent reasonable suspicion that they are carrying contraband or weapons, Jablonsky was not entitled to\nqualified immunity. The illegality of the sheriff's policy also provides the necessary basis for affirming the County's\nliability. See Weber, 804 F.2d at 803 (holding Monroe County liable for strip search policy implemented by its\nsheriff).\nB. Standing\nEven assuming the illegality of NCCC's policy, defendants argue that Shain cannot complain because NCCC had\nreasonable suspicion concerning him based on the court remand and on facts known by law enforcement\npersonnel other than Dantunono, the officer who actually performed the strip search. We disagree. Although\nsearching officers may rely on information provided to them by their colleagues, see Velardi v. Walsh, 40 F.3d\n569, 574 (2d Cir.1994), there is no evidence that Ellison, who was employed by the Nassau County Police\nDepartment, or the officers who accompanied Shain to and from court, communicated any information to\nDantunono. Thus, the only information Dantunono knew and the only fact NCCC required for a strip search was\n[4]\nthe fact of the remand.  This remand merely required NCCC to receive and detain Shain until his Family Court\nappearance and indicated that Shain had been charged under Article 8 of the Family Court Act. Because Article 8\ncovers offenses ranging from disorderly conduct to assault, the remand itself could not provide reasonable and\nindividualized suspicion. In fact, Lieutenant John Considine, commanding officer of NCCC's operations unit,\n\n67 conceded that the information in Shain's file would not have *67 provided reasonable suspicion that he\npossessed contraband.\nC. The Injunction\nAlthough plaintiff requested an injunction against future enforcement of the blanket strip search policy, the district\ncourt judgment neither explicitly granted nor denied this request. Plaintiff's attorney objected to the proposed\njudgment, in part, on the basis that it did not address the injunction. Plaintiff now claims that the district court\nerred by failing to grant an injunction once the illegality of the strip search procedure was established. Defendants\nrespond that the district court did not err because NCCC voluntarily suspended its policy pending appeal.\nHowever, the record before us is not adequate to determine whether injunctive relief is necessary, and the district\ncourt did not make findings of fact or conclusions of law relevant to the grant or denial of injunctive relief.\nTherefore, we remand to allow the district court to make the necessary findings and conclusions. See\nFed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).\nD. Refusal of New Trial on Damages\nIn his charge, the district judge instructed the jury that if it found defendants had violated Shain's constitutional\nrights but he had not suffered a compensable injury, it should award nominal damages not to exceed one dollar.\nThe judge also instructed the jury that he previously had found defendants' strip search policy to be\nunconstitutional. When the jury returned its verdict, the court asked what compensatory and punitive damages\nthe jury had awarded on the strip search claim and the foreman responded \"Zero.\" The judge did not ask what\nnominal damages the jury had awarded. Plaintiff then moved to set aside the verdict and for a new trial, and the\ncourt denied both motions. However, the court did enter a nominal damages judgment of one dollar. On appeal,\nShain argues only that the court should have granted him a new trial on damages.\nWe review a district court's decision not to grant a new trial on damages solely for abuse of discretion. See \nAmato v. City of Saratoga Springs, 170 F.3d 311, 314 (2d Cir.1999). The district court should not grant such a\nmotion \"unless [it] is convinced that the jury has reached a seriously erroneous result or that the verdict is a\nmiscarriage of justice.\" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Shain cannot meet this high standard. He produced\nno objective medical or psychological testimony linking a psychological or physical injury to the strip search, and\nalthough he and his former girl friend testified that he was emotionally traumatized by the search, the jury was not\nrequired to credit this testimony. See id. at 314-15. Nor was it error for the court to correct the jury's verdict by\nentering a nominal damages award of one dollar since nominal damages are appropriate for the violation of a\nconstitutional right. See Dawes v. Walker, 239 F.3d 489, 497 (2d Cir.2001) (collecting cases holding that it is error\nnot to award nominal damages where a constitutional violation is established).\nII. False Arrest\nIn order to make out a New York common law or Section 1983 claim for false arrest or imprisonment, plaintiff\nmust demonstrate that defendant intended to confine him, he was conscious of the confinement, he did not\nconsent to the confinement, and the confinement was not otherwise privileged. See Singer v. Fulton County\nSheriff, 63 F.3d 110, 118 (2d Cir.1995). An arrest made on probable cause is privileged, and probable cause\n68 exists \"when the arresting officer has *68 knowledge or reasonably trustworthy information sufficient to warrant a\nperson of reasonable caution in the belief that an offense has been committed by the person to be arrested.\" Id.\nat 119 (internal quotation marks omitted). The officer may rely on the victim's allegations. See Martinez v.\nSimonetti, 202 F.3d 625, 634 (2d Cir.2000).\nNew York Penal Law ยง 240.25, which defines first degree harassment, states in relevant part:\nA person is guilty of harassment in the first degree when he or she intentionally and repeatedly\nharasses another person by following such person in or about a public place or places or by\n\nengaging in a course of conduct or by repeatedly committing acts which places such person in\nreasonable fear of physical injury.\nEllison's report of the incident stated that Denier told him Shain entered her bedroom, refused several requests to\n[5]\nleave, and threatened to rape her.  We find that Shain's alleged refusal to leave the room after repeated\nrequests coupled with his alleged threat to rape Denier constituted a course of conduct that could reasonably\nhave caused Denier to fear for her safety. See People v. Murray, 167 Misc.2d 857, 861, 635 N.Y.S.2d 928\n(N.Y.Crim.Ct.1995) (finding course of conduct within the meaning of the harassment statute where \"[d]efendant\nwalked along side the complainant to her office, barr[ed] her way when she sought to escape inside [and]\ncontinued to stalk her as she retreated up the street [and] forcibly prevent[ed] her from obtaining assistance from\n[a] parked van\" although the conduct only lasted five to eight minutes). Therefore, we affirm the district court's\ndismissal of Shain's false arrest claim.\nIII. Malicious Prosecution\nIn order to sustain a claim for malicious prosecution, Shain must demonstrate, among other things, that the\nprosecution terminated in his favor. See, e.g., Murphy v. Lynn, 118 F.3d 938, 947 (2d Cir.1997). Because an\nadjournment in contemplation of dismissal is not considered to be a favorable termination, Shain cannot sustain\nhis malicious prosecution claim based on the criminal proceeding. See id. at 949. Nor can Shain rely on Denier's\nwithdrawal of her Family Court petition because Denier is not a defendant in this lawsuit. We therefore affirm the\ndistrict court.\nIV. Abuse of Process\n\"[A] malicious abuse of process claim lies against a defendant who (1) employs regularly issued legal process to\ncompel performance or forbearance of some act (2) with intent to do harm without excuse or justification, and (3)\nin order to obtain a collateral objective that is outside the legitimate ends of the process.\" Cook v. Sheldon, 41\nF.3d 73, 80 (2d Cir.1994). Bringing a defendant before a judge for arraignment satisfies the first element. See id.\nTo show improper motive, Shain relies on Ellison's testimony that he knew Denier from the hospital and that after\nhe found the order of protection had expired, he interviewed her further to determine whether there was another\nbasis to arrest Shain. These allegations do not show intent to do harm without excuse or justification. Ellison's\nsuperficial acquaintance with Denier hardly suggests improper motive, and his continuance of the investigation\n69 when he found the order of protection had expired was merely good *69 police work. The district court properly\ndismissed this claim.\nV. Excessive Force\nShain contends that he also is entitled to a new trial on his excessive force claim principally because the court\ninstructed the jury that Ellison could use sufficient force to arrest Shain. As we have found that Ellison did have\nprobable cause to arrest Shain, the charge was not erroneous. See Calamia v. City of New York, 879 F.2d 1025,\n1034-35 (2d Cir.1989). Shain also argues that the court abused its discretion by admitting Denier's testimony\nconcerning his past abuse and her account of this abuse to Ellison. However, what Denier told Ellison was\nrelevant to the jury's determination of whether Ellison used excessive force by rear cuffing Shain. Therefore, the\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion.\nVI. Judge Madden and Section 155(2) Claim\nThe parties stipulated to dismiss all claims against Judge Madden but to keep him as a nominal defendant for the\npurpose of testing the constitutionality of Family Court Act ยง 155(2). The district court initially \"so ordered\" this\nstipulation but later dismissed the claims against Judge Madden in their entirety without directly ruling on\nplaintiff's claim that Section 155(2) is unconstitutional. The district court did not err because (1) at the time the\ncourt issued its sua sponte order (1) there was no realistic danger that Shain would face the same harm again\n\nand (2) there was no defendant against whom Shain could have recovered damages. Denier withdrew her Family\nCourt petition on August 7, 1995, and there is no allegation that she ever filed another one. By the time Judge\nWexler issued his order, the parties had been divorced for over a year. Because Shain could not show \"that these\nsame parties are reasonably likely to find themselves again in dispute over the issues raised in this appeal,\" he\nlacked a legally cognizable stake in seeking an injunction or a declaratory judgment. Muhammad v. City of New\nYork Dep't of Corrections, 126 F.3d 119, 124 (2d Cir.1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). Nor could Shain\nhave obtained damages from any of the defendants because Judge Madden is protected by judicial immunity, \nsee Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349, 364, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978), and the remaining\ndefendants bore no responsibility for Shain's continued incarceration after the judicial remand.\nCONCLUSION\nWe affirm the district court's judgment except as to the failure to rule explicitly on Shain's request for injunctive\nrelief against NCCC's strip search policy. With respect to that policy, we remand to the district court for further\nproceedings in accord with this opinion.\nKATZMANN, concurring:\nI join in Judge Pooler's opinion in this challenging case. Unlike Judge Cabranes in his thoughtful dissent, I believe\nit reaches the result required by the precedent of this Circuit with respect to the standard to be applied to cavity\nsearches in cases such as this one. In short, Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89-90, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64\n(1987), and its progeny deal with prison regulations as they are applied to individuals charged with or convicted\nof felonies, while Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796 (2d Cir.1986),Walsh v. Franco, 849 F.2d 66 (2d Cir.1988), and \nWachtler v. County of Herkimer, 35 F.3d 77 (2d Cir.1994), concern the treatment of misdemeanor arrestees being\n70 held in jails. Because there has been no explicit indication from the *70 Supreme Court that it would apply its\n\"reasonably related to penological interests\" standard (rather than a \"reasonable suspicion\" standard) to cases\ninvolving misdemeanor arrestees being held in jail, I believe we are compelled to follow Circuit precedent, which\ndistinguishes between these two types of cases. As Wachtler was decided well after Turner, it appears to me that\nthis Circuit's approach to such cases is unchanged after Turner. I write separately to emphasize that while this\nCircuit's choice to distinguish for these purposes either between misdemeanors and felonies or between jails and\nprisons is not necessarily persuasive to me 00 and in fact I am not sure either is a distinction I would make if I\n97\nwere considering the question in the first instance 00 I do think that these distinctions are required by our earlier\n97\nprecedents. Because these precedents have not, in my view, been squarely overruled, I believe we have no\nchoice but to apply the \"reasonable suspicion\" standard to the facts of this case.\nJOSร A. CABRANES, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part:\nI respectfully dissent from the majority's decision to evaluate the constitutionality of the cavity search at issue\nhere under the \"reasonable suspicion\" standard we developed in Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 802 (2d Cir.1986),\nrather than under the \"reasonably related to legitimate penological objectives\" standard subsequently articulated\nby the Supreme Court in Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89-90, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987).\nIn reaching this decision, the majority subjects Nassau County to liability for having an assertedly unconstitutional\ncavity-search policy, and subjects an individual defendant to liability for implementing it. Moreover, the majority\nremands the cause for a determination as to whether the District Court should enjoin the Nassau County\nCorrectional Center (\"NCCC\") from continuing to conduct a cavity search of all people admitted to the facility.\nThe majority's decision is based on an artificial, untenable distinction between \"prisons\" and \"jails,\" and creates a\nCircuit split where there was none 00 a Circuit split that calls out for resolution by the Supreme Court. In my view,\n97\nthe majority's decision finds no warrant in the Supreme Court's jurisprudence and, indeed, substantially and\nunnecessarily limits the reach of the leading Supreme Court cases in this area. In resolving the cavity-search\nissue as it does, the majority also requires, by what the majority holds are the dictates of the Constitution, that\ncorrectional facilities such as the NCCC be run in a manner that defies common sense.\n\nAccordingly, I dissent from the holding that the applicable standard to evaluate the constitutionality of a cavity\n[1]\nsearch in a jail is \"reasonable suspicion\" rather than \"reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest.\"  I\nwrite briefly to explain why.\n* * * * * *\nAs the majority notes, in Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796 (2d Cir.1986), we developed a standard for assessing the\nconstitutionality of cavity searches of arrestees: The Constitution, we held, \"precludes prison officials from\nperforming ... cavity searches of arrestees charged with misdemeanors or other minor offenses unless the\n71 officials *71 have a reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is concealing weapons or other contraband based on\nthe crime charged, the particular characteristics of the arrestee, and/or the circumstances of the arrest.\" Id. at\n802 (emphasis added). In Walsh v. Franco, 849 F.2d 66, 68-69 (2d Cir.1988), and Wachtler v. Herkimer County,\n35 F.3d 77, 81 (2d Cir.1994), we evaluated the constitutionality of cavity searches under Weber's \"reasonable\nsuspicion\" standard.\nNearly one year after our decision in Weber, the Supreme Court held that \"when a prison regulation impinges on\ninmates' constitutional rights, the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.\" \nTurner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89-90, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987); see also Washington v. Harper, 494\nU.S. 210, 224, 110 S.Ct. 1028, 108 L.Ed.2d 178 (1990) (holding, inter alia, that \"Turner applies to all\ncircumstances in which the needs of prison administration implicate constitutional rights\"); O'Lone v. Estate of\nShabazz, 482 U.S. 342, 348, 107 S.Ct. 2400, 96 L.Ed.2d 282 (1987) (applying Turner and noting that \"legitimate\npenological interests\" include \"deterrence of crime, rehabilitation of prisoners, and institutional security\"). In \nCovino v. Patrissi, 967 F.2d 73 (2d Cir.1992), we evaluated a cavity search under Turner's \"reasonably related\"\nstandard, and held that an arrestee may, in some circumstances, be subjected to a cavity search \"in the absence\nof a[n] ... individualized suspicion justifying the search,\" id. at 77-78 00 that is, even when there is no \"reasonable\n97\nsuspicion\" of the kind required by Weber.\nThe question here is this: Should we assess the constitutionality of the NCCC's cavity search policy (\"policy\")\nunder Weber's \"reasonable suspicion\" standard (a standard we set forth) or under Turner's \"reasonably related\"\nstandard (a standard the Supreme Court set forth)?\nThe answer to this question, thus posed, seems obvious enough 00 Turner, as a case decided by the Supreme\n97\nCourt, must prevail. But resolving the question is complicated by the fact that, regrettably, our cases decided after\nTurner pull in different directions: Walsh and Wachtler suggest that Weber's \"reasonable suspicion\" standard is\ncontrolling here, and Covino suggests that Turner's \"reasonably related\" standard is governing.\nThe majority sidesteps this difficulty by holding that the \"reasonably related\" standard is controlling where the\nrelevant correctional facility is a \"prison\" (as was assertedly the case in Covino), and that we must apply the\n\"reasonable suspicion\" standard that we enunciated in Weber and its progeny where the relevant correctional\nfacility is a \"jail\" (as was assertedly the case in Weber, Walsh, Wachtler, and, as the majority states, here). See\nMAJORITY OPINION, ante, at 66.\nAt first glance, ordering our cases in this manner is appealing: As a general matter, it is the duty of panels\nreasonably to harmonize our precedents, see, e.g., Rocket Jewelry Box, Inc. v. Noble Gift Packaging, Inc., 157\nF.3d 174, 176 (2d Cir.1998) (\"[E]very panel of this court is bound by the decisions of earlier panels....\"), and the\njail/prison distinction renders our caselaw internally coherent by shoe-horning all-but-contradictory lines of\nprecedent into apparently distinct doctrinal categories.\nHowever, the distinction between these categories is illusory, and I believe that organizing our caselaw along the\njail/prison axis is error.\nAs an initial matter, the distinction drawn by the majority between jails and prisons is wholly unprecedented. The\n72 majority *72 points to no cases that differentiate between jails and prisons in the manner that it suggests, and our\n[2]\nsister Circuits routinely apply Turner's \"reasonably related\" standard to cases involving jails.\n\nThey do so with good reason: There is no basis in the Supreme Court's jurisprudence for limiting Turner's\n\"reasonably related\" standard to cases involving correctional institutions denominated \"prisons.\" It is true, of\ncourse, that the \"reasonably related\" standard nominally applies to \"prison regulations.\" See Turner, 482 U.S. at\n89, 107 S.Ct. 2254 (emphasis added). But the term \"prison\" is most frequently used generically to describe any\ngovernment facility 00 including a \"jail\" 00 that function primarily as a place for the confinement of people involved\n97 97\nin the criminal justice system. See BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 1194 (6th ed.1990) (\"prison,\" first definition: \"A\npublic building or other place for the confinement of persons, whether as a punishment imposed by the law or\n[3]\notherwise in the course of the administration of justice\") (emphasis added).\nThere is no indication that the Turner Court intended to depart from this well-settled, non-technical meaning of the\nword \"prison.\"\nFirst, Turner's \"reasonably related\" standard, which, as noted, concerns \"prison regulations,\" was itself based on\n73 four cases that concerned \"prisoners' rights,\" see Turner, 482 U.S. at 86, 107 S.Ct. 2254: *73 (1) Pell v.\nProcunier, 417 U.S. 817, 94 S.Ct. 2800, 41 L.Ed.2d 495 (1974), (2) Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Union, 433\nU.S. 119, 97 S.Ct. 2532, 53 L.Ed.2d 629 (1977), (3) Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447\n(1979), and (4) Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S. 576, 104 S.Ct. 3227, 82 L.Ed.2d 438 (1984). See Turner, 482 U.S.\nat 86-89, 107 S.Ct. 2254 (discussing these cases). Of these \"prisoner's rights\" cases, one case 00 Procunier 00\n97 97\nconcerned what the majority would call a \"prison\"; but another 00 Jones 00 involved both a prison and a jail, see \n97 97\nJones, 433 U.S. at 122, 97 S.Ct. 2532, and two of them 00 Block and Bell 00 exclusively concerned jails, see \n97 97\nBlock, 468 U.S. at 578-79, 104 S.Ct. 3227,Bell, 441 U.S. at 524, 99 S.Ct. 1861. This suggests that there is no\ndistinction of constitutional magnitude between jails and prisons. If there were such a distinction, the Turner Court\nwould not have elided the difference between \"jail\" cases and \"prison\" case by characterizing certain \"jail\" cases (\nBlock, Bell, and perhaps Jones) as \"prisoners' rights\" case. See Turner, 482 U.S. at 86, 107 S.Ct. 2254. And\nsimilarly, the Turner Court would not have 00 indeed, could not have 00 derived from \"jails\" cases (Block, Bell, and\n97 97\nperhaps Jones) a standard that does not apply to them, but that applies only to what the majority would term a\n\"prison\" case.\nSecond, it is clear from Turner's rationale that the \"reasonably related\" standard was not intended to apply only to\nthose institutions encompassed in the majority's narrow definition of \"prison.\" The Turner Court adopted the\nrelatively deferential \"reasonably related\" standard as a means of accommodating two distinct imperatives 00 first,\n97\nprotecting individual rights; and second, recognizing that \"the problems of prisons in America are complex and\nintractable, and ... are not readily susceptible of resolution by [judicial] decree.\" Id. at 85, 107 S.Ct. 2254. As the \nTurner Court explained:\nRunning a prison is an inordinately difficult undertaking that requires expertise, planning, and the\ncommitment of resources, all of which are peculiarly within the province of the legislative and\nexecutive branches of government. Prison administration is, moreover, a task that has been\ncommitted to the responsibility of those branches, and separation of powers concerns counsel a\npolicy of judicial restraint. Where a state penal system is involved, federal courts have ...\nadditional reason to accord deference to the appropriate prison authorities.\nId. at 84-85, 107 S.Ct. 2254. In other words, a basic purpose of the \"reasonably related\" standard is to prevent\nthe federal courts from becoming overly involved in the administration of corrections-related facilities that have\n[4]\nchronic problems that the judiciary is, comparatively speaking, poorly-positioned to solve.\n74 *74 But facilities that fit this description are as likely to be denominated \"jails\" as \"prisons.\" The NCCC is an apt\nexample. It operates 365 days a year and 24 hours a day. When Mr. Shain was subjected to a cavity search\nthere, the NCCC employed 950 corrections officers and housed, on an average day, 1,800 inmates. Every year,\nmore than 14,000 people are introduced into the NCCC population. Of those who are housed at the NCCC, some\nhave been sentenced to terms of one year or less; some have been sentenced to longer terms of imprisonment\nand are awaiting transfer to state-run correctional facilities in upstate New York; and others have been charged\nwith a range of crimes, including violent felonies.\n\nIn short, the NCCC is a large, complex facility. Running it undoubtedly \"requires expertise, planning, and the\ncommitment of resources, all of which are peculiarly within the province of the legislative and executive branches\nof government,\" and it is therefore reasonable to assume that its problems, whatever they might be, are not\n\"readily susceptible of resolution by [judicial] decree.\" Turner, 482 U.S. at 84-85, 107 S.Ct. 2254.\nAccordingly, the rationale for the \"reasonably related\" standard applies as forcefully to the NCCC as it would to a\nfacility formally called a prison, and we must therefore assume that when the Turner Court developed the\n\"reasonably related\" standard, it intended for it to apply to facilities like the NCCC. But by introducing an artificial\ndistinction between prisons and jails, the majority substantially limits Turner's reach 00 and removes institutions\n97\n[5]\nlike the NCCC from the ambit of the \"reasonably related\" standard.\nThe majority justifies its formalistic cabining of Turner 00 and its concomitant holding that it is Weber's \"reasonable\n97\nsuspicion\" standard that applies in jails 00 by reference to the \"substantial difference between jail and prison\n97\npopulations.\" MAJORITY OPINION, ante, at 65-66. However, factors such as the composition of a facility's\npopulation 00 or, indeed, the composition of the portion of a facility's population subjected to a particular regulation\n97\n00 are fully amenable to analysis under the Turner standard. See, e.g., Covino, 967 F.2d at 79 (stating that \"the\n97\nnature of [the facility's] inmate population\" supported the finding that there was \"a legitimate and rational\n75 connection between the challenged searches ... and [the facility's] security *75 interests\"); Michenfelder v.\nSumner, 860 F.2d 328, 332-33 (9th Cir.1988) (noting, while upholding visual body-cavity searches of inmates\nhoused in a facility's maximum security unit each time a prisoner entered or left his cell, that \"[t]he searches are\nconducted on convicted prisoners in [the facility's] most restrictive unit\" and \"[e]levated security precautions are\njustified for prisoners placed in maximum security settings ...\"). Indeed, because Turner requires that the interest\nidentified by the government be \"legitimate\" and that there be a nexus between the restriction of a prisoner's\nconstitutional rights and the interest, see482 U.S. at 89-90, 107 S.Ct. 2254, facility regulations justified by\npenological goals applicable only to persons convicted of crimes 00 such as punishment 00 could not be imposed\n97 97\non pretrial detainees. In this case, however, the NCCC's asserted interest is facility security, which is a legitimate\nconcern regardless of the status of the facility's population. See Mauro v. Arpaio, 188 F.3d 1054, 1059 & n. 1 (9th\n[6]\nCir.1999)(en banc).\nAnother difficulty with the majority's holding is that it interprets the Constitution as requiring large, complex\nfacilities such as the NCCC to be run less intelligently 00 and less safely 00 than ought to be the case. In deciding\n97 97\nwhether and under what circumstances to permit cavity searches, responsible correctional officials would\npresumably balance the rights of prisoners (which are impinged on by cavity searches) and the safety of staff and\nother prisoners (which is enhanced 00 at least somewhat 00 by cavity searches). In determining how this balance\n97 97\nshould be struck in the context of any particular facility, common sense dictates that a number of factors are\nrelevant, including whether the facility is overcrowded; whether it is equipped with drug-sniffing dogs and metal\ndetectors; whether it has been infiltrated by gangs; and whether prisoners have attempted previously to secrete\ncontraband in a manner detectable only by cavity searches. Because the \"reasonably related\" standard envisions\na flexible, multi-factor inquiry, see Turner, 482 U.S. at 89-91, 107 S.Ct. 2254, it would permit administrators to\ncraft cavity search policies with an eye to each of these concerns.\nBy contrast, the \"reasonable suspicion\" standard requires prison administrators to focus on only one set of\n76 variables 00 those related to reasonable suspicion itself. Accordingly, *76 the majority's application of the\n97\n\"reasonable suspicion\" standard to jails means that administrators who manage facilities such as the NCCC will\nnot be allowed to take into account any of the factors noted above. That makes no sense and, as I have argued,\nis not required by the Constitution.\n* * * * * *\nThe majority holds that we must assess the constitutionality of the cavity search at issue here under Weber's\n\"reasonable suspicion\" standard, not Turner's \"reasonably related\" standard. For the reasons stated above, I\ndissent.\n\n[1] Shain wrongly sued Officer Ellison as John Ellison.\n[2] In fact, the Court saw no basis for distinguishing between pretrial detainees and convicted inmates because \nThere is no basis for concluding that pretrial detainees pose any lesser security risk than convicted inmates.\nIndeed, it may be that in certain circumstances they present a greater risk to jail security and order. In the federal\nsystem, a detainee is committed to the detention facility only because no other less drastic means can\nreasonably assure his presence at trial. As a result, those who are detained prior to trial may in many cases be\nindividuals who are charged with serious crimes or who have prior records. They also may pose a greater risk of\nescape than convicted inmates. This may be particularly true at facilities like the MCC, where the resident\nconvicted inmates have been sentenced to only short terms of incarceration and many of the detainees face the\npossibility of lengthy imprisonment if convicted.\nBell, 441 U.S. at 546 n. 28, 99 S.Ct. 1861 (internal citations omitted).\n[3] A panel of this court recently stated in dicta that \"[p]enological interests are ... arguably not an appropriate\nguide for the pretrial detention of accused persons\" because penological interests relate to convicted persons. \nBenjamin v. Fraser, 264 F.3d 175, 187 n. 10 (2d Cir.2001). Because we applied Turner to the rights of a pretrial\ndetainee who had been charged with a serious crime and who was commingled with sentenced inmates in a\nstate prison in Covino, we do not rely solely on Shain's status as a pretrial detainee.\n[4] As noted previously, we accept for the sake of argument that NCCC did require a judicial remand, although\nthe evidence appears to establish that it did not.\n[5] We adopt Ellison's account rather than Denier's more expansive description because the false arrest claim\nwas dismissed on a motion for summary judgment.\n[1] I agree with the majority as to its disposition of plaintiff-appellee-cross-appellant Ray E. Shain's false arrest,\nmalicious prosecution, abuse of process, and excessive force claims, as well as with its disposition of his\nchallenge to the constitutionality of the Family Court Act ยง 155(2). As to these issues, I concur in the reasoning\nand result of the majority opinion.\n[2]See, e.g., Mauro v. Arpaio, 188 F.3d 1054, 1058-63 (9th Cir.1999); Friend v. Kolodzieczak, 923 F.2d 126,\n127-28 (9th Cir.1991); Siddiqi v. Leak, 880 F.2d 904, 908-10 (7th Cir.1989); see also, e.g., Rogers v. Arbisi, No.\n93 C 20237, 1996 WL 89346, at *5 (N.D.Ill. Feb.28, 1996); Muhammad v. City of N.Y. Dept. of Corrections, 904\nF.Supp. 161, 197 (S.D.N.Y.1995); Shaheed v. Winston, 885 F.Supp. 861, 867-68 (E.D.Va.1995),aff'd on other\ngrounds 161 F.3d 3 (4th Cir.1998) (table); Pippins v. Adams County Jail, 851 F.Supp. 1228, 1234 (C.D.Ill.1994).\n[3] To be sure, \"prison\" is sometimes used in a manner that suggests a contrast with a \"jail.\" See BLACK'S LAW\nDICTIONARY 1194 (6th ed.1990) (\"prison,\" third definition: \"institutions ... distinguished from ... jails\"). But that is\nrelatively rare. It is more common to treat \"jail\" and \"prison\" 00 both of which are non-technical terms to everyone\n97\nother than students of penology 00 as virtual synonyms. See id. (defining \"prison\" in a manner that encompasses\n97\n\"jail\"); id. at 834 (\"jail,\" first non-\"obsolete\" definition: \"prison\"). Consider, for example, Weber. In the majority's\ntypology, Weber concerns jails, not prisons. But we held there that \"prison officials\" may not take certain actions. \nWeber, 804 F.2d at 802 (emphasis added); see also id. at 804 (describing the need \"to defer to the judgment of \nprison officials\") (emphasis added). Any possible distinction between prisons and local jails apparently did not\nmake an impression on the Weber panel, and, as the definitions quoted above suggest, the Weber panel's\nconflation of jail and prison is not merely a matter of linguistic imprecision. Rather, \"jail\" and \"prison\" are all-but\ninterchangeable. \nThis said, to the extent that there is a sharp, commonly agreed-upon distinction between the terms, it is that\nprisons hold people convicted of crimes, and jails hold people merely charged with crimes. See BLACK'S LAW\nDICTIONARY at 834 (defining \"jail\"). But here, prisons and jails cannot be differentiated on this basis. The\nmajority distinguishes Covino, in which we applied Turner's \"reasonably related\" standard, as a case that involved\na prison, not a jail. See MAJORITY OPINION, ante, at 66. But the plaintiff in that case had not been convicted of\na crime when he was searched 00 he had merely been charged with a crime. See Covino, 967 F.2d at 78 n. 4.\n97\n\nAccordingly, if \"prison\" means a correctional facility that houses those convicted of crimes, as the majority\nsuggests, Covino would have been a \"jail\" case, not a \"prison\" case, and we would have applied Weber's\n\"reasonable suspicion\" standard. But we did not do so; instead, we applied Turner's \"reasonably related\"\nstandard. See Covino, 967 F.2d at 77-78; accord United States v. El-Hage, 213 F.3d 74, 81-82 (2d Cir.2000)\n(applying the Turner standard in a \"jail\" setting 00 that is, to assess a pre-trial detainee's constitutional claim).\n97\n[4]See Washington, 494 U.S. at 223-24, 110 S.Ct. 1028 (stating that adoption of the \"reasonably related\"\nstandard in Turner \"was based upon the need to reconcile our longstanding adherence to the principle that\ninmates retain at least some constitutional rights despite incarceration with the recognition that prison authorities\nare best equipped to make difficult decisions regarding prison administration\"); cf. Turner, 482 U.S. at 89, 107\nS.Ct. 2254 (\"Subjecting the day-to-day judgments of prison officials to an inflexible strict scrutiny analysis would\nseriously hamper their ability to anticipate security problems and to adopt innovative solutions to the intractable\nproblems of prison administration. The rule would also distort the decisionmaking process, for every\nadministrative judgment would be subject to the possibility that some court somewhere would conclude that it had\na less restrictive way of solving the problem at hand. Courts inevitably would become the primary arbiters of what\nconstitutes the best solution to every administrative problem, thereby unnecessarily perpetuat[ing] the\ninvolvement of the federal courts in affairs of prison administration.\") (internal citations and quotation marks\nomitted).\n[5] As noted, by distinguishing our cases along a jail/prison axis, the majority hopes to reconcile our precedents\nwith one another. See ante at 66. In this case, however, we need not attempt to do so. As a matter of logic, our\napplication of Weber's \"reasonable suspicion\" standard in Walsh and Wachtler necessarily rested on a sub\nsilentio holding that our decision in Weber survived the Supreme Court's subsequent decision in Turner. (I\ncharacterize this holding as sub silentio because neither Walsh nor Wachtler mention Turner, and there is no\nindication that the parties brought Turner to the attention of the Walsh or Wachtler panels.) But sub silentio\nholdings do not bind subsequent panels. See, e.g., Goldberger v. Integrated Res., Inc., 209 F.3d 43, 49 (2d\nCir.2000); Getty Petroleum Corp. v. Bartco Petroleum Corp., 858 F.2d 103, 113 (2d Cir.1988). See generally \nWebster v. Fall, 266 U.S. 507, 511, 45 S.Ct. 148, 69 L.Ed. 411 (1925) (\"Questions which merely lurk in the\nrecord, neither brought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon, are not to be considered as having been so\ndecided as to constitute precedents.\"). Moreover, when a panel bases a decision entirely on Circuit precedent\nthat has been implicitly overruled by the Supreme Court 00 as I believe Weber was by Turner 00 panels of our\n97 97\nCourt need not hew to the panel decision. See, e.g., Zervos v. Verizon, 252 F.3d 163, 167 (2d Cir.2001)\n(collecting cases).\n[6] In expressing \"doubt\" in dicta over whether the use in Turner of the phrase \"penological interests\" limits its\napplicability to \"persons convicted of crimes,\" the panel in Benjamin v. Fraser, 264 F.3d 175 (2d Cir.2001), cited\nJudge Kleinfeld's dissent from the en banc decision in Mauro.264 F.3d at 187. Judge Kleinfeld, in turn, relied on\na narrow definition of \"penological\" as \"relating to the `theory and practice of prison management and criminal\nrehabilitation'\" and meaning, \"roughly,\" \"penalty or punishment.\" 188 F.3d at 1068. Judge Kleinfeld found support\nfor his belief that the Supreme Court used \"penological\" in this narrow sense in its recognition in Turner that\nrehabilitation is a legitimate penological interest. Id. at 1068 & n. 8 (citing Turner, 482 U.S. at 97-99, 107 S.Ct.\n2254). Judge Kleinfeld's analysis, however, fails to account for the reliance in Turner of facility security as the\n\"penological interest\" justifying a prohibition on inmate correspondence between institutions, see Turner, 482 U.S.\nat 91-92, 107 S.Ct. 2254, which reliance is inconsistent with his theory that \"penological interests\" are interests\napplicable only to prisoners convicted of crimes 00 after all, facilities housing prisoners may have legitimate\n97\nsecurity concerns regardless of whether those prisoners have yet been convicted of a crime. Indeed, the majority\nopinion in Mauro, in which the Ninth Circuit distinguished between penological interests that may be legitimately\napplied to pretrial detainees from those that may be legitimately applied only to those convicted of crimes, see\n188 F.3d at 1059 & n. 1, demonstrates the appropriate use of the Turner multi-factor framework to a regulation\naffecting pretrial detainees.
