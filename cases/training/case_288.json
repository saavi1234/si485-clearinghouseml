Plaintiffs alleged equal protection and due process violations and sought declaratory and injunctive relief.  The U.S. Department of Justice [DOJ] intervened in the action as a party plaintiff on November 11, 1969.</p><p>Following discovery, the parties resolved the case by way of a Consent Decree.  The Decree, entered July 23, 1971 by District Judge Johnson, called for the Alabama Industrial School (formerly known as the Alabama Industrial School for Negro Children) was ordered to accept male juvenile delinquents between the ages of I5 and 18, without regard to race.  The Decree also called for reforms in the areas of education and rehabilitation, vocational programs, staffing levels and qualifications, corporal punishment, discipline and medical and health care.  It also set maximum capacity levels.</p><p>The District Court ordered the file administratively closed on October 5, 1972.</p><p>On December 6, 1975, defendants filed a motion to modify the Court's decree of July 23, 1971.  By order of the District Court dated January 6, 1976, the 1971 Decree was modified, so as to allow defendants to place committed students in training schools on the basis of need and not restrict such placements to sex and age.</p><p>We have no further information on this case.</p><p></p>",

      "text": ".RECEIVED\nIN THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES1\nFOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF ALABAMA\nNORTHERN DIVISION  JUL 1 9 19Zu\nCLERK\nU. S. DISTRICT COURTJ\nMIDDLE DIST. OF ALA,\nCHARLES  JEROME  STOCKTON,  X  MONTGOMERY, ALA,\nETAL.,  X\nX\nPlaintiffs,  X\nI\nand  X\nX\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,  X\nX\nPlaintiff-  X\nIntervenor,  X\nX  CIVIL ACTION NO. 2834-N\nvs.  X\nX\nALABAMA INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL  X\nFOR NEGRO CHILDREN, ET AL.,  X\nX\nDefendants.  X\nUNITED STATES' PROPOSED CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\nDUE PROCESS\n1.  This Court has jurisdiction of this action under Title 28,\nUnited States Code, Sections 1343 and 1345.\n2.  Since the commencement of the juvenile court process in the\nUnited States, the basic policy behind the various statutes enacted for\nthe treatment of juveniles has been \". . . directed to their rehabilitation\nfor useful citizenship through reformation and education, and not to their\npunishment, even when the offense underlying the adjudication of delinquency\nis of a kind which when committed by an older person would merit indictment,\nconviction, and punishment.\"  Opinion of Judge (now Associate Justice of\nthe Supreme Court) William Brennan in In re Lewis, 11 N.J. 217, 224, 94 A.2d\n328, 331 (1953).  See also, Application of Johnson, 178 F.Supp. 155 (D. N.J.\n1957); White v. Reid, 125 F.Supp. 647, 649 (D. D.C. 1954); Thomas v. United\nStates, 121 F.2d 905 (D.C. Cir. 1941).\n3.  The statutory policy of juvenile rehabilitation is an outgrowth\nof the common law doctrine of parens patriae, the equitable notion that the\nState's intervention is justified when there is danger to the health and\nwelfare of children.  Under this doctrine, when a child's need for guidance\nand care is not met by parental attention, the state may undertake to pro-\nvide for the child the kind of environment he should have been receiving\nat home.  Application of Johnson, supra, 175 F.Supp. 155; Creek v. Stone,\n\n379 F.2d 106 (D.C. Cir. 1967).  See discussion in Kent v. United States,\n383 U.S. 541 at 555-56 (1966), and In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1 at 16-17 (1967)\n4.  The legislature of the State of Alabama has incorporated a\npolicy of delinquency rehabilitation into the enabling statute governing\nthe training school at Mt. Meigs.  The relevant statutory language states\nthat \"[t]he intent and purpose of the Alabama Industrial School for Negro\nChildren is the reclamation of delinquent negro (sic) boys and girls in\nthe State of Alabama.\"  Code of Alabama, Title 52, Section 613(4)\n(recomp. 1958).\n5.  Juvenile proceedings in the State of Alabama do not result in\nthe adjudication of guilt or innocence (as in criminal prosecutions), but\nconclude in a determination of delinquency or non-delinquency.  Code of\nAlabama, Title 13, Sections 363 and 378 (recomp. 1953).\n6.  Juvenile courts in Alabama employ different procedures than\nthose used in adult criminal trials.  These procedures do not incorpor-\nate all the procedural guarantees constitutionally afforded to those\naccused of crime.  See Code of Alabama, Title 13, Sections 353 and 354\n(recomp, 1958).\n7.  In sustaining the constitutionality of juvenile court pro-\ncedures which deprive an offender of certain procedural guarantees,\n\". . .the Courts have emphasized that the proceedings are non-criminal,\nbut also that the institution to which the delinquent is committed is\nnot of a penal character.\"  White v. Reid, supra, 125 F.Supp. 647, 649.\n8.  When a state commits a delinquent child to an institution\nthrough a juvenile process which does not incorporate all the due process\nguarantees of an ordinary criminal trial, the state thereby assumes an\naffirmative duty under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amend-\nment to assign the delinquent to a rehabilitative institution, not a\npenal facility.  See White v. Reid, supra, 125 F.Supp. at 649; United\nStates ex rel Stinnett v. Hegstrom, 178 F.Supp. 17, 18 (D. Conn. 1959)\n9.  \"The rehabilitative caretaking offered in exchange for consti-\ntutional protection must be substantive and real, not mere verbiage.\"\nIn re Rich, 125 Vt. 373, 216 A.2d 266, 270 (1966).  The situation of\njuveniles committed to Mt. Meigs is analogous to the condition of\npatients committed to mental institutions through non-criminal proce-\ndures and without the constitutional protections that are afforded\n- 2 -\n- r\n\ndefendants in criminal proceedings.  When persons who have not committed\ncrimes are institutionalized by the state acting as parens patriae, these\npersons have a constitutional right to treatment or rehabilitation.  If\nadequate treatment or care is not provided, the hospital or juvenile train-\ning school is transformed into a penal institution.  Wyatt y. Stickney,\nC.A. No. 3195, Middle District of Alabama (March 12, 1971) Slip Opinion,\npp. 4-5; See also, Rouse v. Cameron, 373 F.2d 451 (D.C. Cir. 1967);\nCovington v. Harris, 419 F.2d 617 (D.C. Cir. 1969); Ragsdale v. Overholser,\n281 F.2d 943, 950 (D.C. Cir. 1960.)  Whatever the reason for depriving a\nchild of his liberty and institutionalizing him, due process of law must\ngive him rights to effective treatment and education.\"  Chester Antineau,\nI Modern Constitutional Law, Note 17 at page 476.\n10.  Although some of the features of penal institutions and\njuvenile rehabilitation facilities resemble each other, there are funda-\nmental legal and practical differences in purpose and technique.  \"Unless\nthe institution is one whose primary concern is the individual's moral\nand physical well-being, unless its facilities are Intended for and\nadapted to guidance, care, education and training rather than punishment,\nunless its supervision is that of a guardian, not that of a prison guard\nor jailer, it seems clear a commitment to such institution is by reason\nof conviction of crime and connot withstand an assault for violation of\nfundamental Constitutional safeguards,. \" White v. Reid, supra, (25 F.Supp.\nat 650).\nCRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT\n11.  The Eighth Amendment's proscription against cruel and unusual\npunishment applies to state, as well as federal authorities.  Robinson v.\nCalifornia, 370 U.S. 660 (1962).  Article I, Section 15 of the Alabama\nConstitution recites the Eighth Amendment's language verbatim.\n12.  With respect to convicts, Alabama law provides that \"[n]o\ncruel or excessive punishment shall be inflicted on any convict and no\ncorporal punishment of any kind shall be inflicted except as it shall have\nbeen previously prescribed by the rules of the department and of which the\nconvict shall have been notified, ...\"  Code of Alabama, Title 45,\nSection 49 (recomp. 1958).  A juvenile offender (who has not been afforded\nthe procedural protection of the criminal process) is entitled to at least\n- 3 -\nT  •\n\nthe standard of punishment applicable to convicted criminals.  See\nChester Antineau, I Modern Constitutional Law, 475 (1969) .\n13.  In determining whether conduct by officials constitutes\ncruel and unusual punishment, several tests are useful.  \"One such\ntest is to ask whether under all the circumstances the punishment\nin question is 'of such character . ..  as to shock general conscience\nor to be intolerable to fundamental fairness.1\"  Lee v. Tahash, 352\nF.2d 970, 972 (8th Cir. 1965), quoted in Hancock v. Avery, 301 F.Supp.\n786, 791 (M.D. Tenn. 1969).  Such a judgment should be made in light\nof developing concepts of elemental decency.  Weems v. United States,\n217 U.S. 349, 370 (1910).  Another test finds punishment to be cruel\nand unusual if it is unnecessarily cruel in view of its aim or pur-\npose.  Id. at 544.  Jordan v. Fitzharris, 257 F.Supp. 674 (N.D. Calif.\n1966).  Further, standards for punishment should be flexible; that\ndisproportion, both among punishments and between punishment and\ncrime, is to be considered; and that broad and idealistic concepts\nof dignity, civilized standards, humanity and decency are useful and\nuseable.  Jackson v. Bishop, 404 F.2d 571, 579 (8th Cir. 1968).\n14.  The word punishment implies a wrong in institutional\nmanagement, in contrast to the casual dereliction of a minor employee.\n\"Thus, if in an Eighth Amendment case there were no conscious purpose\nto inflict suffering, . . .\" it is necessary to \"look next for a\ncallous indifference to it at the management level, in the sustained,\nknowing maintenance of bad practices and customs.\"  Roberts v.\nWilliams, No. 28829, 5th Cir., April 1, 1971, Slip Opinion, p. 19.\nWhere an affirmative constitutional duty to provide rehabi-\nlitative program for juvenile offenders has been established, as\nat the Mt. Meigs school, a default in that responsibility brings\nthe conduct of responsible officials within the scope of the Eighth\nAmendment.\n15.  When officials of a training school have condoned or per-\nmitted the frequent and indiscriminate use of corporal punishment against\n- 4 -\n\njuveniles committed to the school, without defined standards, they have\ndemonstrated the callous indifference to children's safety which provides\nthe basis of Eighth Amendment liability.  Roberts v. Williams, supra,\nat p. 20.\nRespectfully submitted,\nJix\nIRA DE MENT\nUNITED STATES ATTORNEY\nCarlton Stoiber\nCARLTON STOIBER, ATTORNEY\nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\n— 5 —",

This is a class action brought pursuant to\n42 U.S.C. §1983 on behalf of Negro juveniles who are\nconfined to, or may be confined to, the Alabama Industrial\nSchool for Negro children, seeking relief from the denials\nof equal protection of the laws on account of race and\nfrom denials of liberty without due process of law.\n2.  The Attorney General has certified that this\ncase is of general public importance within the mean5.ng\nof Section 902 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 UrS-rSv—\n§2000h-2).  His certificate is attached to this Complaint\nin Intervention.\nr  •\n\n3.  Defendants are the Alabama Industrial .|\n S( K)(\nfor Negro children, an agency of the State of Alabama\n(hereinafter referred to as Mt. Meigs), R. E. Belser,\nChairman of the Board of Trustees, E. B. Holloway,\nSuperintendent  (Warden),, various named employees, and\nvarious unnamed members of the Board of Trustees of\nsaid agency.\n4.  Mt. Meigs is one of three institutions operated\nby the State of Alabama for the confinement of juvenile\n\"delinquents\".  Mt. Meigs has traditionally been maintained\nfor Negro juveniles, and as of August 15, 1969, there\nwere 351 Negro boys, 90 Negro girls and no white boys\nor girls at Mt. Meigs.  The other two institutions, the\nState Training School for Girls at Chalkville, Alabama,\nand the Alabama Boys Industrial School at Birmingham,\nAlabama, have traditionally been maintained for white\njuveniles.  As of August 15, 1969, there were 79 white\ngirls and 1 Negro girl at the School for Girls at\nChalkville, and 202 white boys and no Negro boys at\nthe Boys Industrial School at Birmingham.\n5.  The institutions described in paragraph three\nwere created under Alabama law for the purpose of\nrehabilitating juvenile offenders who have been\ncommitted to these institutions under state juveniles\nv i\nV\nproceedings.  .\nv*.\n- 2 -\nr  •\n\nC> .  While  Che  School  for  G t r ln  nt;  ChalVvlll\nthe Industrial School at Birmingham are administered\nrehabilitative institutions and offer courses and proj'r-u-,\nto meet this end, the defendants administer Mt. Meigs ns\na penal institution, and punish rather than rehabilitate\nthe Negro juvenile offenders committed there.  \\\n7..  The defendants have deprived Negro juveniles\nat Mt. Meigs of a proper rehabilitative program, among  *\nother ways, as follows:  •  j\na)  Corporal punishment is administered  !\ni\nfreely and excessively to the juveniles confined  <\nI\nthere at the unfettered discretion of the  i\nI\nvarious staff members.  j\nb)  The programs, facilities, counseling\nservices, and educational services at Mt.  !\n•«•  •  •  .  i\nMeigs are inferior in every way to the two  '  j\nrehabilitative institutions traditionally  !\ni\nmaintained  for white children by the State  ;\nof Alabama, and to any other institution\nwhich provides an adequate rehabilitative  ''  !\nprogram for juveniles.\nc)  The juveniles confined to Mt. Meigs\nare required to spend large amounts of time\nperforming manual farm labor for the sole\npurpose of producing income for the institution;\nthis labor is not reasonably calculated to\nserve any rehabilitative function.\n-• 3  -\n\nd)  There are no uniform standards and\nprocedures for taking disciplinary action.  y,\n8.  The juveniles who are in custody at Mt. Meigs  II\nhave been committed there pursuant to juvenile court  ||\ni l.'l\nproceedings which do not incorporate the constitutional  *  W\n'  SI\nsafeguards of criminal trials, and it is constitutionally  >  M\nimpermissible to commit or to confine such juveniles  |  ||\nthrough these procedures to institutions which are not  ••?!•\ni  i\nadequate to serve as rehabilitative institutions for  ;  i<5|\njuveniles.  '  '  ^|\n9.  The conditions and practices described  ||\nherein deprive plaintiffs and members of their class\nof the equal protection of the laws on account of race,\nand of their liberty without -due process of law as\nguaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution\nof the United States.\nWHEREFORE, the United States p*rays this Court to\nenter an Order enjoining the defendants, their agents,\nemployees, successors in interest and all others in\nactive concert with them from:  ^\na)  Failing to immediately establish and implement\na program designed to serve the rehabilitative needs of  f\nthe juveniles confined to Mt.

OF ALA.\nPlaintiffs, MONTGOMERY, ALA,\nand\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nPlaintiff-\nIntervenor,\nvs. CIVIL ACTION NO. 2834-N\nALABAMA INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL\nFOR NEGRO CHILDREN, ET AL.,\nDefendants.\nVERIFIED PROPOSED FINDING OF FACTS OF THE UNITED STATES\nThe parties to this action, by and through their respective attorneys\nof record, stipulate to the following:\nI.  Mt. Meigs Under Alabama Law\nMt.  Meigs is one of three separate juvenile \"training\" schools\nestablished by Alabama statutes:\n1.  State Training School for Girls, for delinquent white girls,\n(Title 52, Sections 570-84, Code of Alabama of 1940, as amended.  (Re-\ncompiled 1958.))\n2.  Alabama Boys Industrial School, for delinquent white boys,\n(Title 52, Sections 585-602, Code of Alabama of 1940, as amended.\n(Recompiled 1958.))\n3.  The Alabama Industrial School for Negro Children, for delinquent\nNegro boys and girls, (Title 52, Sections 613(1)-613(15), Code of Alabama\nof 1940, as amended.  (Recompiled 1958.))\nThere is no central governmental authority having specific re-\nsponsibility for the administration of Alabama's three training schools.\nEach school is governed by an independent board of trustees or directors\nappointed by the Governor.\nThe State Department of Pensions and Security has the duty to visit\neach facility from time to time and to advise the school's officers in\nregard to approved methods of child care, best types of housing, school\nequipment, and adequate records.\n\nThe State Superintendent of Education is mandated to prepare\nsuitable courses in vocational education that conform to the minimum\nstandards of other public schools of the State.\nThe statutes requiring racial segregation in Alabama's training\nschools have been declared unconstitutional by the United States Dis-\ntrict Court for the Northern District of Alabama and by the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.  Crum v. State\nTraining School for Girls, 413 F.2d 1348  (1969).\nThe statutes establishing and governing the three training\nschools reflect a clear legislative intent that the schools were\nestablished for the purpose of rehabilitation and training; not\nfor punishment, as ordinarily contemplated upon criminal conviction.\nThe statute for Mt. Meigs states:\n\"The intent and purpose of the Alabama\nIndustrial School for Negro Children is\nthe reclamation and training of delinquent\nnegro (sic) boys and girls in the State of\nAlabama. _1/\nBefore admission to Mt. Meigs, a child must be declared \"delinquent\"\naccording to Alabama's juvenile court law, and also declared a ward of the\nState.  2J  In Alabama, juveniles are tried in a non-criminal procedure,\nwhich is mandatory for all children between the ages of twelve and sixteen\nand who have been accused of acts which would be crimes if committed by\nadults.  The procedure may also be used for minors between the ages of six-\nteen and eighteen, at the option of the Circuit Court Judge having jurisdic-\ntion over the accused minor. 3j  Correspondingly, no child may be committed\nto Mt. Meigs who is under the age of twelve, or over eighteen.  4/  When\nproperly committed to Mt. Meigs, juveniles may be kept by the authorities\n1/  Title 52, Section 613(4), Code of Alabama of 1940, as amended.  (Recom-\npiled 1958); see also, Section 573, where a similar intent and purpose\nis expressed for the State Training School for Girls.  No provision on\nintent and purpose is contained in the statute establishing the Alabama\nBoys Industrial School.\n2J  Title 52, Section 613(4), Code of Alabama of 1940.  (Recompiled 1958).\n3/  Title 13, Section 363, Code of Alabama of 1940.  (Recompiled 1958).\n4/  Title 52, Section 613(5), Code of Alabama of 1940.  (Recompiled 1958).\nThe Alabama Boys Industrial School is restricted to students between\nages twelve and sixteen; and the State Training School for Girls ac-\ncepts girls between twelve and eighteen.  Title 52, Section 574 and\n590, Code of Alabama of 1940.  (Recompiled  1958).\n- 2 -\n\nuntil they are twenty-one years of age,  5/  but, in practice, most\nchildren are released after eighteen months to two years.\nMt. Meigs1 authorities, consistent with the rehabilitative theory\nof juvenile confinement, are under several statutory mandates.  With\nrespect to administrative personnel, the statute governing Mt. Meigs\nstates:\n\"It shall be the duty of the board of the\nAlabama Industrial School for Negro Children\nto appoint a superintendent who shall serve\nat its pleasure.  Such superintendent shall\nbe a man peculiarly fitted by education,\ntraining and experience in social case work\nto fill suitably the position.  No person\nshall be employed as superintendent unless\nsuch person has had training and experience in\nsocial case work and institution management. . .\" bj\nThe statute also sets forth the duty of the superintendent to chronicle\nthe progress of individual children committed to Mt. Meigs.  The super-\nintendent is directed to:\n\"...  Keep a case record concerning the\nname, age, circumstances connected with the\nprevious history of each child admitted to\nthe Alabama Industrial School for Negro\nChildren and shall add facts concerning the\ncharacter, conduct, training, and education\nof such child while at the institution and\nafter leaving it if the child goes on parole.\" ]_/\nThe statute also establishes certain minimum standards which must\nbe complied with in the disciplining of children committed to Mt. Meigs:\n\"Only such punishment shall be prescribed\nunder the rules and regulations adopted in\nconferences of the superintendent with the\nboard of the Alabama Industrial School for\nNegro Children.  Any employee who inflicts\nor permits to be inflicted inhumane treat-\nment or punishment shall be removed by the\nappointing authority.  Strict discipline\nmust be maintained, but emphasis shall not\nbe placed upon punishment as such, but\nrather upon a reclamation through estab-\nlishing the child's self-respect, self-\ndiscipline, and self-control.\" 8_/•\nII.  Mt. Meigs Prior To January, 1970\nDuring the five years prior to the appointment of Mr. J. B. Hill\nin January, 1970, as a Special Consultant to recommend changes in the\nadministration and operation of Mt. Meigs, monthly population reports\n5/  Title 52, Section 613(6), Code of Alabama of 1940.  (Recompiled  1958).\n6/  Title 52, Section 613(3)(1) Code of Alabama of 1940.  (Recompiled 1958)\n7/  Title 52, Section 613(3)(8) Code of Alabama of 1940.  (Recompiled 1958)\n8/  Title 52, Section 613(8) Code of Alabama of 1940.  (Recompiled  1958).\n\nsubmitted by the Supreintendent of Mt. Meigs reflect the following figures\nfor maximum and minimum number of committed children at the school:\nYEAR  MAXIMUM  MINIMUM\n1965  557  446\n1966  452  364\n1967  472  425\n1968  490  431\n1969  490  367\nWhen Mr. Hill arrived at Mt. Meigs he found some 224 children enrolled at\nthe institution (186 boys and 38 girls).  9/\nBefore his retirement, as of June 1, 1970, the Superintendent of\nMt. Meigs was E. B. Holloway.  Mr. Holloway studied agriculture at Tuskegee\nInstitute, possessed no college degree, and had further formal training\nonly in summer school in \"family relations, extension methods, and things\nof that nature.\"  Prior to becoming superintendent, he was Assistant Super-\nintendent and supervisor of the school's farm.  10/\nMrs. Fannie Mathews, who was primarily responsible for the care and\ntraining of all girls at Mt. Meigs, had only a high school diploma.  Prior\nto coming to the school she was employed in a garment factory.  11/\nMr. Tom Glover, who supervised the boys in the fields, finished the fourth\ngrade.  \\2J  There were three or four additional farm supervisors who\ncould not write.  L3_/  The supervisors in the boys dormitories were\ncollege students.  VkJ\nIn most cases prior to January, 1970, the statutory requirement\nof keeping an individual record of the progress of each child involved\nlittle beyond having a counselor prepare a one-page evaluation of the\njuvenile at the time of his or her release from Mt. Meigs.  These\nevaluations exhibit a striking similarity.  Almost no records of dis-\ncipline administered were kept; and the paucity of discipline reports\nin the Mt. Meigs files contrasts markedly with the complete quarterly\n9/  Letter from Mr. J. B. Hill, Consultant, to Governor Albert P. Brewer,\ndated March 24, 1970, (hereinafter referred to as the March letter) p. 1.\n10/  Deposition of Holloway, P. 7.\n11/  Deposition of Mathews, p. 40.\n12/  Deposition of Glover, p. 7.\n13/  Deposition of Holloway, p. 14.\n14/  Deposition of McNear, p. 9. .\n- 4 -\n\nreports on each boy which are maintained as a part of the permanent\nrecords at the Alabama Boys Industrial School.  15/\nPrior to January, 1970, corporal punishment was routinely admin-\nistered at Mt. Meigs without defined standards.  Written rules in effect\nbefore Mr. Kenneth O'Dea came to Mt. Meigs as Title I coordinator, made\nno mention of corporal punishment.  L6/  Notwithstanding the absence of\ndefinite rules, corporal punishment was permitted, and condoned,  17/\nwith the result that Mr. O'Dea apparently felt it necessary to estab-\nlish some restrictions on the use of such punishment.  ]J3/  On December\n19, 1969, Superintendent Holloway testified that he formed a \"discipline\ncommittee\" some six months earlier by which he \"stopped letting anyone\ngive corporal punishment for every little thing.\"  19J  However, Mrs.\nMathews, who was on the discipline committee, stated that the committee\nhad done nothing.  ^0/  Further, statements by at least fourteen persons,\nmost of whom had been confined at Mt. Meigs, indicate that corporal punish-\nment was promiscuously employed by the school's personnel, using a wide\nrange of techniques.  2\\J  One school employee, in fact, stated that he\nhad to punish children \"sometimes\" by striking them up to five times with\na paddle.  22/\nPrior to January, 1970, juveniles assigned to Mt. Meigs engaged\nin an extensive farming operation, involving the cultivation of some\nfifteen hundred acres of land.  ^3/  Major crops were cotton, cucumbers,\n15/  Deposition of McNear, pp. 8-9; Deposition of Carr, pp. 35-36.\n16/  Deposition of O'Dea, pp. 17-18.\n17/  Depositions of Holloway and Glover.\n18/  Deposition of O'Dea, pp. 19-20.\n19/  Deposition of Holloway, pp. 11, 17-18.\n20/  Deposition of Mathews, pp. 11-12.\n21/  Depositions of Arleathia Anderson Walker, pp. 8-14; Mary Jane Martin,\npp. 8-13, 16-18; Larry Williamson, pp. 6-10, 13-17; Lillie McCullough,\npp. 7-9; Herbert Hoover Thomas, Sr., pp. 15-16; Calvin Leon Foxhall\npp. 8, 10-15; Shelia King, pp. 8-9; Robert E.

Meigs also possessed a herd of cattle comprising 35 dairy cows and\napproximately 150 beef cattle.  These animals furnished all of the meat\nconsumed at the school, and much of the milk used for cooking.  25/\nSheep and hogs were also raised on the school's farm.  26/\nThe vocational program at the institution was quite limited\nuntil 1970.  Only four offerings were available for boys:  printing,\nbarbering, shoe repairing, and auto mechanics.  27J  Except for cosme-\ntology, girls were limited to fields related to home economics, such\nas sewing, laundry, and cooking.  ^8/\nPrior to 1970, juveniles at Mt. Meigs engaged in academic course\nwork every other day, for nine months of the year.  29J  Remedial reading\nclasses were held during the summers of 1967, 1968, and 1969, for some\nstudents, under a program funded under Title I of the Elementary and\nSecondary Education Act.  30/\nIII.  Mt. Meigs at Present\nSince the appointment of Mr. J. B. Hill as Special Consultant to\ncorrect deficiencies at Mt. Meigs, three reports have been issued which\noutline the changes accomplished in recent months.  3^/  Mr. Hill has\ncontinued his participation in the administration of Mt. Meigs; currently\nserving as Vice Chairman of the Board of Trustees.  Since October, 1970,\nthe Superintendent of the school has been Mr. Joe G. Morrison.  Mr. Morrison\npossesses a Bachelor of Arts degree in Business Administration, and a Masters\nDegree in Rehabilitation and Counseling.\nId. at 6-7.\nZ5/  JEd. at 7-10.\n\"2JoJ  Id. at 10.\n27/  March Letter, p. 3.\n28/  Deposition of E.

Brewer dated March 24, 1971 (hereinafter referred\nto as the March Letter); (2) Letter from J. B. Hill to Governor Albert\nP. Brewer dated April 24, 1971, (hereinafter referred to as the April\nLetter); and (3) A report to the Board of Directors of the Alabama\nIndustrial School by J. B. Hill dated September 8, 1970, (hereinafter\nreferred to as the September Report.)\n- 6 -\n\nOne of the first actions taken was to organize a Social Services\nDepartment, and with social workers drawn from the other two state train-\ning schools and the Alabama Department of Pensions and Security, to inter-\nview the 186 boys and 38 girls assigned to Mt. Meigs.  32j  After these\ninterviews, the number of juveniles at the facility was reduced by more\nthan half to a population of 110 boys.  The school is now operating solely\nas a male institution, accepting only boys between the ages of sixteen and\neighteen.  _33/  Currently there are between 140 and 150 youths at Mt. Meigs.\nThe Social Services Department at Mt. Meigs is currently headed by a\npermanent director,  J34/  with a staff of four full-time social workers.  On\nJune 1, 1971, a Social Work Counselor's Aide will also be employed.\nWith respect to physical facilities, several steps have been taken.\nFour boys' dormitories (Cottages A, B, C, and D) were found to be unsuitable\nfor occupancy without substantial renovation, and were therefore permanently\nclosed.  J35/  An outside bathroom described as \"atrocious\" was razed.  36/\nConstruction on a new dining hall was commenced in May, 1970.  ^7_/ The dining\nhall will be occupied by May 1, 1971.  Also, all heating systems at the school\nwere replaced or remodeled,  J38/  and a new telephone system installed.  39/\nA portion of one of the cottages was also remodeled to serve as a canteen,\nwhich students are allowed to visit twice a week.  kOj  The current capacity\nof the institution was estimated at 120 boys in September of 1970.  41/\n32/  March Letter, p. 1.\n33/  April Letter, p. 1.\n34/  The present Director, Mr. Tom Robinson, possesses a Bachelor's Degree\nin Social Work.\n35/  March Letter, p. 2; September Report, p. 1.\n36/  September Report, p. 1.\n37/  September Report, p. 2.\n_38/  1±.\n39/  September Report, p. 3.\n40/  April Letter, p. 1; September Report, p. 2.\n41/  September Report, p. 1.\n- 7 -\n\nThe remodeling of several buildings has brought the current capacity to\nover 200, with the following facilities in use:\nBUILDING  CAPACITY\nHolloway I  52\nHolloway II  51\nWashington Hall Annex  40\nWashington Hall II  40\nOrientation Wing  30\nTOTAL  213\nThe extensive fanning operation at Mt. Meigs has been entirely\nabandoned,  hi/  Not only has the dairy operation been discontinued be-\ncause of the lack of sanitation facilities,  ji3_/ but all livestock has\nbeen sold (including the carcasses of a large number of dead animals found\nby J. B. Hill on his arrival,)  4j4/  and the farm land has been leased to\nprivate tenants.  45/\nA Medical and Diagnostic Center, built on land owned by the school,\nnow provides medical care and hospitalization to boys confined at Mt.\nMeigs.  hbj  A full-time Registered Nurse is employed, with a Doctor and\nMedical Technician on 24-hour call.  The Doctor visits the school three\ntimes each week.\nAdditional personnel have been hired, including permanent full-time\ncottage parents,  _47/  a part-time chaplain,  4_8/  and a full-time recrea-\ntional director.  497  An Administrative Assistant and permanent yard\nsupervisors have also been hired.  50/  In addition, a nine-page written\nstatement of Personnel Policies has been written and distributed to the\nemployees at the school.  51/\n42/  March Letter, p. 4.\n43/  September Report, p. 2.\n44/  Id.\n45/  March Letter, p. 4.\n46/  March Letter, p. 3; September Report, p. 3.\n47/  March Letter, p. 2; September Report, p. 1.

The school also employs full-time football\nand basketball coaches.\n50/  March Letter, p. 2; September Report, p. 2.\n51/  March Letter, Exhibit \"D\".\n- 8 -\n\nA new approach to discipline has been inaugurated, particularly\nwith respect to corporal punishment.  A memorandum to all staff members\nwas issued on February 13, 1970, setting forth the manner in which\ncorporal punishment is to be administered.  Now, a boy may receive\nsuch punishment only with a paddle specifically designed for the pur-\npose.  Punishment may only be administered by a staff member in the\npresence of another staff member; and a corporal punishment report on\nthe incident must be prepared on a special form and delivered to the\nSuperintendent's office within twelve hours after such punishment has\nbeen administered.  52/\nAn incentive program has been devised, and its specifics set\nforth in a ten-page document entitled \"Individual Conduct, Effort and\nInitiative Rating System.\"  5_3_/  In general, this program is based upon\nthe principle of positive reinforcement and establishes five levels of\nconduct, with increased privileges granted to boys as their conduct\nimproves from unacceptable to good.  The lowest ranking boys, desig-\nnated \"Zeros\" are allowed fewer privileges than the next highest rank,\n\"Climbers.\"  _54/  The heirarchy ascends through \"Builders\" and \"Aces\"\nto \"Citizens,\" who have much more liberal privileges than other boys.  55/\nThe ranks are based upon weekly grading report forms submitted by each\ndepartment at the school.  56/\nThe vocational program at Mt. Meigs has also been expanded.  In\nJanuary, 1970, only the following four programs for boys were offered:\n1.  Printing\n2.  Barbering\n3.  Shoe Repairing\n4.  Auto Mechanics.\nAt present, the following vocational units are being offered through the\nState of Alabama's Vocational Education Division:\n1.  Trowel Trades\n2.  Welding\n3.  Small Engine Repair\n4.  Service Station Trade (Minor Auto Repair)\n5.  Basic Electricity\n6.  Ornamental Horticulture\n7.  Vocational Counseling Unit.\n52/  March Letter, p. 2.\n53/  March Letter, Appendix \"C\".\n54/  For example, \"Zeros\" are not permitted to smoke.\n55/  \"Citizens\" and \"Aces\" are allowed to visit their families at\nhome for three days each month.\n56/  March Letter, Appendix \"C\".\n- 9 -\n\nFive additional units are operated with the school's general fund revenues:\n1.  Plumbing\n2.  Carpentry\n3.  Shoe Repair\n4.  General Electricity\n5.  Laundry.\nUnder Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the following\nfour units are offered:\n1.  Barbering\n2.  Offset Printing\n3.  Industrial Arts  (woodworking)\n4.  Ceramics (largely used for recreational purposes.)\nThe training school's Academic Department now consists of ten\nteachers and two teachers' aides.  The principal is Mr. Parse Billop, who\npossesses a Master's Degree in Administration.  The following courses are\noffered, with emphasis on basic skills:  English, History, Mathematics, and\nArithmetic, Remedial Reading, Science, Music, and Physical Education.\nAn orientation program, including the establishment of a separate\n\"Orientation Wing\" in Washington Hall, has been developed to help\njuveniles committed to Mt. Meigs in the process of adjusting to institutional\nlife.  A permanent Director of Orientation, Mr. Anderson Jones (Bachelor's\nDegree) will assume employment on June 1, 1971.  Approximately ten recent-\nly committed juveniles participate in the orientation program at one time;\nwith fifteen boys of the \"Citizen\" rank assigned to the new arrivals as\n\"big brothers,\" to advise and guide them during their first days at Mt.\nMeigs.  Funds for this project were obtained from the Alabama State Law\nEnforcement Planning Agency. 57/\nIRA DE MENT\nUNITED STATES ATTORNEY\nCARLTON R.
