The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona.</p><p>The plaintiffs, who were represented by the National Center for Youth Law and private counsel, filed a Sixth Amended Complaint on April 9, 1990, and asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging the defendants' treatment and policies violated the juveniles' constitutional rights.  The plaintiffs sought to change confinement practices and to require adequate procedural protections prior to inflicting harsh and cruel punishments.  They also sought to require medical care and adequate educational programs, and to evaluate juveniles for handicapping conditions in accordance with the Education for the Handicapped Act.  Finally, the plaintiffs sought to change the defendants' interference with the juveniles' access to legal counsel and their restrictive visitation policies.  In addition, certain plaintiffs asked certain defendants for damages.  </p><p>The parties entered into a Consent Decree on May 6, 1993, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona.  The court (Judge Richard M. Bilby) issued an injunction to last four years.  It required the defendants to house juveniles in the least restrictive environment and instituted population limitations.  It further required defendants to form an individual treatment plan for each inmate, and to provide medical, dental, and psychiatric care.  It provided guidelines for educational assessments, progress monitoring, and work programs.  Finally, it prohibited arbitrary punishments.  The Consent Decree provided for monitoring through a committee, which would conduct inspections and issue written reports on the progress.</p><p>On April 15, 1996, the court (Judge Bilby) issued an order finding the Arizona Department of Juvenile Corrections out of compliance with the Consent Decree, in that the Department failed to adhere to the Decree's requirements limiting the population in juvenile facilities to designated levels and demanding the approval of the monitoring committee before increasing the total number of beds.  The court ordered the Department to resolve this matter within 30 days.  Compliance reports continued to be filed with the court and the docket continues through June 2000.</p><p></p>",

Defendant CAROL MOORE HURTT has been Assistant\n27\nDirector for Juvenile and Community Services in the Arizona\n28\n\nDepartment of Corrections continuously since April, 1985. In that\ncapacity she is responsible for the general supervision and\nmanagement of juvenile institutions in Arizona, including CMJI,\nand for implementing Arizona Department of Corrections\n4\nregulations, rules, and policies affecting juveniles confined at\nCMJI. Defendant CAROL MOORE HURTT was the immediate supervisor of\n6\nDefendant JAMES UPCHURCH from April, 1985 to November, 1986, and\nhas been the immediate supervisor of Defendant THOMAS KORFF since\n8\nMay, 1987. She is sued in her personal capacity.\n9\n19.  Defendant C. DIANE BISHOP, is the Superintendent of\n10\nPublic Instruction and Director of the Arizona Department of\n11\nEducation.  She also is the Executive Officer of the Arizona State\n12\nBoard of Education.  Under Arizona law, she is primarily\n13\nresponsible for state supervision and enforcement of all laws,\n14\nrules and regulations concerning elementary and secondary\n15\neducation in Arizona and, pursuant to federal and state laws and\n16\nregulations, she is primarily responsible for the provision of\n17\nspecial education and related services to all eligible\n18\n''handicapped children,\" as that term is defined in the Education\n19\nfor all Handicapped Children Act and Arizona Revised Statutes 15-\n20\n761, including such children confined at CMJI.  She is sued in her\n21\nofficial capacity.\n22\n20.  Defendant, the ARIZONA BOARD OF EDUCATION, is the\n23\nstatutorily created entity responsible for setting and enforcing\n24\neducational policy in the State.  It has the authority to and has\n25\nadopted rules and regulations regarding elementary and secondary\n26\neducation, including the provision of special education services\n27\nto \"educationally handicapped\" children as that term is defined in\n28\n\nf  f\n,  the Education for all Handicapped Children Act and Arizona Revised\nโ  Statutes 15-761, including such children confined at CMJI.\nโ  21.  In doing the acts described herein, each of the\ndefendants has acted under color of state law and by virtue of the\nauthority vested in each of them as employees of the State of\nArizona.\n6\nCLASS ACTION\n22.  Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf and\n8\non behalf of all others similarly situated pursuant to Rule 23(a)\n9\nand  (b)2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  tHe class\n10\nconsists of all juveniles who are now or who in the future will be\n11\nconfined at CMJI.\n12\n23.  The.members of the class are so numerous that joinder\n13\nof all members is impracticable.  On information and belief, there\n14\nare approximately 175 juveniles presently confined at CMJI and\n15\nother juveniles are brought into the institution with regularity.\n16\nIn addition, there are questions of law and fact common to the\n17\nmembers of the plaintiff class regarding practices of the\n18\ndefendants, and the claims of the named plaintiffs are typical of\n19\nthe claims of the members of the plaintiff class.  The named\n20\nplaintiffs and plaintiffs' counsel will fairly and adequately\n21\nprotect the interests of the members of the class.f\n22\n24.  By their policies, the defendants have acted and\n23\ncontinue to act on grounds and in a manner generally applicable to\n24\nthe class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or\n25\ncorresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a\n26\nwhole.\n27\n25.  The injuries suffered by the named plaintiffs and the\n28\n\nmembers of the plaintiff class as a result of the policies and\npractices of defendants are capable of repetition, yet may  evade\nreview, thereby making class relief  appropriate.\nFACTUAL  ALLEGATIONS\n4\nA.  FACTS IN SUPPORT OF CLAIMS FOR DECLARATORY. INJUNCTIVE. AND\n5  OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF\n6  I.  DISCIPLINARY  PRACTICES\n'  A.  Solitary  Confinement\n26.  Defendants maintain a punishment cottage at CMJI known\nยฐ  as Yucca Cottage which contains 16 cells.  These cells are\n10  approximately  9' x 9' and are of concrete block construction  with\n11  bare cement floors and heavy barred doors.  Except in two of the\n12  cells which contain uncovered  institutional-style  toilets and\n13  sinks, there are no furnishings  in the cells except a heavy metal\n14  bed  frame stationed on metal  legs.\n15  27.  Defendants have failed to maintain these cells in a\n16  safe condition.  The cells are inadequately heated  in winter and\n17  inadequately cooled in summer; they are inadequately  lighted, and\n18  they are unclean and  unsanitary.\n19  28.  Defendants have confined plaintiffs  in these cells  for\n2Q  periods ranging from several hours to weeks or even months.  For\nexample, defendants confined plaintiff JOHNSON  in Yucca  Cottage\n22  for over 50 consecutive days.  Defendants confined plaintiff  D.A.\n23  in Yucca Cottage on at least seven occasions  for periods as long\nas thirteen days.  Defendants confined plaintiff O.S. in Yucca\nCottage on at least 3 0 occasions for periods as long as  seven\ndays.  Defendants have confined  each of the plaintiffs  in Yucca\n27  Cottage.\n29.  Defendants have confined plaintiffs  in cells in Yucca\n8\n\n(  f\nCottage twenty-four hours a day except  for brief periods to use\nthe bathroom  or shower or for periods  of forced  exercise.\nDefendants permit plaintiffs to shower only every  other day and to\n3\nleave their cells to exercise only after they have been  in\n4\nsolitary  confinement  for five consecutive  days.  On  occasion,\n5\ndefendants have denied plaintiffs  confined  in Yucca  Cottage\n6\npermission to leave their cells to go to the bathroom  and, as a\n7\nresult, plaintiffs have urinated  or defecated  on the floor  of\n8\ntheir  cells.\n9\n30.  Defendants have failed to provide  adequate  clothing\n10\nfor plaintiffs  in Yucca Cottage cells.  Before being placed  in\n11\nthese cells, defendants strip-search plaintiffs  and give them  only\n12\na jumpsuit to wear.  On occasion, defendants have  denied\n13\nplaintiffs  jumpsuits and have confined  plaintiffs  in Yucca  Cottage\n14\ncells with no clothing but underwear.  For example,  defendants\n15\nconfined  plaintiff  D.A.  in a cell  in Yucca  Cottage overnight  with\n16\nno clothing but underwear.  Defendants do not permit plaintiffs  to\n17\nwear  shoes while confined  in Yucca Cottage and defendants  often do\n18\nnot permit plaintiffs to wear  socks.\n19\n31.  Defendants have failed to provide  adequate bedding  to\n20\nplaintiffs while  in Yucca Cottage cells.  Defendants  give\n21\nplaintiffs  a mattress and one small blanket  each night and  then\n22\nremove the mattress  and blanket  from the cell each morning.  On\n23\noccasion, defendants withhold mattresses  and blankets at night  as\n24\nadditional  punishment.\n25\n32.  Defendants have failed to take sufficient  precautions\n26\nin the event of fire to adequately  protect plaintiffs  in  Yucca\n27\nCottage  cells.  For example, defendants  lock cells  in  Yucca\n28\n\nr\nCottage individually with padlocks and have failed to provide an\nadequate plan for evacuation in the event of fire.\n33.  Defendants have confined depressed, agitated and\nemotionally disturbed children in solitary confinement in Yucca\n4\nCottage and defendants have taken inadequate measures to protect\nthem from self-injury.  As a result plaintiffs have cut, hanged\n6\nand otherwise injured themselves.\n34.  Defendants have failed to provide adequate psychiatric\n8\nand psychological counseling and other mental health services to\nplaintiffs held in solitary confinement in Yucca Cottage,\n10\nincluding those plaintiffs who have injured or attempted to injure\n11\nthemselves.  As a result, plaintiffs have suffered serious\n12\npsychological stress, including the effects of sensory\n13\ndeprivation, while in Yucca Cottage.\n14\n35.  Defendants have failed to provide educational programs\n15\nfor plaintiffs in Yucca Cottage and they have failed to provide\n16\nappropriate reading materials.  In addition, defendants have\n17\nprevented plaintiffs from participating in educational programs\n18\nwhich they have tried to pursue on their own initiative.  For\n19\nexample, defendants intentionally and deliberately denied\n20\nplaintiff JOHNSON the opportunity to take the Graduate Equivalency\n21\nDegree Examination  (GED) because he was in Yucca Cottage.\n22\n36.  Defendants have failed to provide rehabilitative\n23\ntreatment or counseling programs for plaintiffs in Yucca Cottage.\n24\n37.  Plaintiffs have suffered and continue to suffer\n25\nserious emotional and physical injury as a result of defendants'\n26\npractices regarding confinement in Yucca Cottage.\n27\n28\n10\n\nf  c\n.  B.  Punitive Segregation\n38.  Defendants confine plaintiffs in Yucca Cottage cells\nfor indefinite periods of time in a program known as \"motivational\nhold\" or \"structured management.\"  Defendants permit plaintiffs in\n4\npunitive segregation to leave Yucca Cottage only to perform hard\nlabor or to attend school.  Defendants sometimes deny plaintiffs\n6\nin punitive segregation the opportunity to attend school or to\notherwise participate in any educational program.\n8\n39.  Defendants permit plaintiffs in punitive segregation\nto visit only with their parents and only for one-half hour on\n10\nSaturdays and one-half hour on Sundays.  Defendants deny\n11\nplaintiffs in punitive segregation the opportunity to communicate\n12\nby telephone with family members.\n13\n40.  Defendants fail to provide plaintiffs in punitive\n14\nsegregation with appropriate counseling, recreation, and other\n15\nrehabilitative treatment.\n16\nC.  Handcuffing and Shackling\n17\n41.  Defendants use metal, police-style handcuffs and leg\n18\nshackles to punish plaintiffs for violations of institutional\n19\nrules.  For example, defendants placed plaintiff D.A. in handcuffs\n20\nand leg shackles for refusing to shovel dirt and required him to\n21\nstand in the sun for two hours.\n22\n42.  Defendants also use metal handcuffs to restrain\n23\nplaintiffs whenever they are taken to Yucca Cottage or moved from\n24\nYucca Cottage.  Defendants have restrained all of the plaintiffs\n25\nin metal handcuffs before* taking them to Yucca Cottage even though\n26\nthey offered no resistance and posed no threat to the security of\n27\nthe institution.\n28\n11\n\n43.  Defendants have also used handcuffs to punish\nplaintiffs for violations of institutional  rules by restraining\ntheir arms and legs to the corners of bed frames in what is known\n3\nas \"four-pointing.\"  For example, defendants  \"four-pointed\"\n4\nplaintiff M.G. and left him on a metal bed frame for several  hours\n5\nbecause he was involved in a fight.\n6\n44.  Plaintiffs have suffered and continue to. suffer\n7\nserious physical and emotional  injury as a result of defendants'\n8\nuse of handcuffs and shackles.\n9\nD.  Disciplinary Due Process\n10\n45.  Defendants  subject plaintiffs to cruel,  excessive,\n11\nharsh, and brutal punishments for violations of petty, vague, and\n12\nambiguous  institutional  rules.  For example, defendants  punish\n13\nplaintiffs by placing them in handcuffs and leg shackles, by\n14\nlocking them in solitary confinement  cells, by placing them in\n15\npunitive  segregation, and by extending  their period of confinement\n16\nin the institution for such rule violations as smoking,  swearing,\n17\n\"staff disrespect,\" \"excessive horseplay,\" and \"rumor of AWOL.\"\n18\n46.  Defendants have failed to adequately  train and\n19\nsupervise  institutional  staff and have permitted  institutional\n20\nstaff to impose cruel and harsh punishments  in an arbitrary and\n21\ncapricious manner.  For example, defendants have  authorized\n22\ninstitutional  staff, as well as volunteer  \"counselors\" who are not\n23\nemployees of the institution, to punish plaintiffs by having  them\n24\nplaced in handcuffs, shackles, solitary confinement, and punitive\n25\nsegregation.\n26\n47.  Prior to the imposition of such harsh and brutal\n27\npunishments, defendants fail to provide plaintiffs with written\n28\n12\n\nf  (\nnotice of any alleged rule infractions and an opportunity to\nโ  adequately defend.  Defendants fail to provide hearings which are\nadequate to determine whether a rule violation has occurred,\nwhether the child charged committed the violation, and to\ndetermine the most appropriate disciplinary sanction for a child\n5\nwho has violated an institutional rule.\n6\n48.  Defendants have failed to establish any effective\ngrievance or appeal process for plaintiffs who have been subjected\n8\nto arbitrary, cruel, excessive, and illegal punishments.\nII.  MEDICAL CARE\n10\n49.  Defendants have failed to adequately screen and\n11\nevaluate plaintiffs prior to or at the time of placement in CMJI\n12\nto determine their medical, dental, and mental health needs.\n13\n50.  Defendants have failed to provide adequate and\n14\nappropriate medical, counseling and mental health services to\n15\nplaintiffs who have cut, hanged or otherwise injured themselves.\n16\n51.  Defendants have failed to design and implement an\n17\nadequate and appropriate treatment procedure for plaintiffs who\n18\nare injured or ill or to provide an appropriate facility to\n19\nprovide for their needs.  As a result, plaintiffs who are injured\n20\nor ill are confined in Yucca Cottage.\n21\n52.  Defendants have failed to protect the plaintiffs and\n22\nmembers of their class from the excessive or inappropriate use of\n23\npsychotropic and anti-depressant drugs.  Defendants administer\n24\nsuch drugs to plaintiffs and members of their class for purposes\n25\nof punishment and control.\n26\nIII.  EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING\n27\n53.  Defendants are recipients of federal funds within the\n28\n13\n\nr\n1  meaning of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, 20\nโ  U.S.C. Section 1401, et seq.\nโ  54.  Defendants have failed to adequately evaluate\nplaintiffs to determine whether they have special education needs\n_  and how such special needs can be met.  Defendants also have\n,  failed to develop appropriate individualized education plans for\n6\n  plaintiffs who require special education.  For example, plaintiff\n7\nP.M. has a stuttering problem and plaintiff M.G. has speech and\no\nlanguage disorders and has been determined to be seriously\nemotionally disturbed.  Despite knowledge of the handicapping\nconditions, defendants have failed to provide plaintiffs with an\n11\neducational program which addresses these special needs.\n12\n55.  Defendants have failed to hire, adequately train and\n13\nsupervise sufficient numbers of qualified personnel to meet the\n14\nspecial education and releited needs of juveniles confined at CMJI.\n15\nFor example, there currently are no special education classes at\n16\nCMJI because the special education teacher position is vacant.\n17\nThis vacancy has existed since at least January 1988.  As a\n18\nresult, juveniles at CMJI who are eligible for and/or in need of\n19\nspecial education services are not assigned to special education\n20\nclasses or otherwise provided special education or related\n21\nservices.\n22\n57.  Contrary to the mandates of 20 U.S.C. Section 1415\n23\n(b)(1)(B), and regulations promulgated thereunder, specifically 34\n24\nC.F.R. 300.514, defendants have failed to recruit, tram or assign\n25\n\"surrogate parents\" to juveniles confined at CMJI who are eligible\n26\nfor and/or in need of special education services.\n27\n58.  Defendants C. DIANE BISHOP, the ARIZONA BOARD OF\n28\n14\n\nEDUCATION, CAROL MOORE, and SAM LEWIS have failed to adequately\nmonitor CMJI to insure that all eligible handicapped juveniles\nconfined at the institution are identified, evaluated, and\nprovided appropriate and necessary special education and related\n4\nservices in a manner that complies with the requirements of\nfederal and state statutes and regulations.\n59.  Defendants have failed to provide an educational\nprogram for plaintiffs which complies with the requirements of\n8\nArizona law.\n9\nIV.  REHABILITATIVE  CARE  AND  TREATMENT\n10 60.  Defendants have failed to provide rehabilitative\n11 services and treatment to plaintiffs in the least restrictive\n12 environment appropriate to their needs.\n13 V.  INAPPROPRIATE PLACEMENT, EVALUATION, AND CLASSIFICATION\n14 61.  Defendants have failed to design and implement an\n15 appropriate classification system for plaintiffs.  As a result,\n16 plaintiffs are arbitrarily confined in the institution, and\n17 assigned to cottages within the institution, without regard to\n18 their treatment needs.\n62.  Defendants have failed to adequately evaluate\n19\nplaintiffs as to their educational, vocational, psychological, and\n20\ntreatment needs.\n21\n63.  Defendants have failed to prepare adequate individual\n22\ntreatment plans for plaintiffs.\n23\n64.  Defendants have failed to evaluate plaintiffs in order\n24\nto determine whether CMJI is the least restrictive placement\n25\nappropriate to their needs.  For example, plaintiff D.F. is\n26\nincarcerated at CMJI for running away from a group home and\n27\n28\n15\n\nf  f\nplaintiff P.M.  is incarcerated at CMJI for a probation violation\nโ  involving  loitering.  Plaintiff B.L. is incarcerated  at CMJI while\nhe is awaiting a hearing on a charge of joy riding.\n65.  Defendants have failed to develop and implement  less\n,.  secure, community-based alternative placements for plaintiffs and\nmembers of their class who are inappropriately confined at CMJI.\nVI.  VISITATION. CORRESPONDENCE, AND ACCESS TO  COUNSEL\n66.  Defendants have prohibited and otherwise  restricted\n8\ncontact between plaintiffs and members of their families.  For\nexample, defendants permit plaintiffs in solitary confinement and\n10\npunitive segregation to visit only with their parents and only for\n11\none-half hour on Saturday, and one-half hour on Sunday.\n12\nDefendants also restrict and prohibit plaintiffs  from talking with\n13\nparents and other family members by telephone.  For example,\n14\ndefendants denied plaintiff JOHNSON the opportunity to visit with\n15\nhis father or to receive telephone calls from his father for three\n16\nmonths.\n17\n67.  Defendants have unlawfully confiscated, read, and\n18\nwithheld plaintiffs' legal documents and communications with their\n19\nattorneys.  For example, defendants searched plaintiff  JOHNSON'S\n20\ncell and confiscated, read, and withheld his legal papers and\n21\ncorrespondence despite his objections and repeated requests that\n22\nthey be returned.\n23\nVII  PAROLE REVOCATION\n24\n68.  Defendants have knowingly and deliberately  failed to\n25\nestablish parole revocation procedures which are adequate to\n26\nprotect the rights of plaintiffs and the class they represent.\n27\n69.  Defendants have subjected plaintiffs to parole\n28\n16\n\nf\nrevocation procedures which violate their rights guaranteed by the\nโ  United States Constitution and the Arizona Constitution.\nB.  FACTS IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFF MATTHEW DAVEY JOHNSON'S\nCLAIMS FOR DAMAGES AGAINST DEFENDANT UPCHURCH\n4\n70.  As a direct and proximate result of the failure of\ndefendant UPCHURCH to properly train and supervise volunteer\n6\ncounselors at CMJI, on August 4, 1986, plaintiff JOHNSON was\nsummarily handcuffed and confined in a solitary confinement cell\n6\nin Yucca Cottage.  This cell was approximately 9' x 9' and of\nconcrete block construction with a bare cement floor and a heavy\n10\nbarred door.  A heavy metal bed frame stationed on metal legs and\n11\nan uncovered, institutional-style toilet and sink were the only\n12\nfurnishings in the cell.  The cell was not maintained at an\n13\nappropriate, and comfortable temperature, it was not adequately\n14\nlighted, and it was not clean.\n15\n71.  As a direct and proximate result of the failure of\n16\ndefendant UPCHURCH to establish an adequate hearing procedure and\n17\nother safeguards, plaintiff JOHNSON was denied the opportunity to\n18\npresent testimony of witnesses who had first-hand knowledge of\n19\nevents which led to his solitary confinement and to otherwise\n20\npresent an adequate defense.  On August 5, 1986, defendant\n21\nUPCHURCH approved five deiys solitary confinement for plaintiff\n22\nJOHNSON.\n23\n72.  On August 9, 1986, after plaintiff JOHNSON had been in\n24\nsolitary confinement for five days, defendant UPCHURCH ordered\n25\nthat he remain in Yucca Cottage in punitive segregation\n26\nindefinitely on \"motivational hold.\"  Under this program,\n27\nplaintiff JOHNSON could be released from Yucca Cottage only at the\n28\n17\n\ndiscretion  of defendant UPCHURCH.  Defendant UPCHURCH  kept\nplaintiff JOHNSON  in punitive segregation on \"motivational  hold'\n2\nin Yucca Cottage  for a period  in excess of  50 days.\n73.  Defendant UPCHURCH did not provide plaintiff  JOHNSON\n4\nwith notice of an offense or violation of an institutional  rule\nbefore placing him  in punitive segregation  or provide him with a\n6\nhearing.  Nor did defendant UPCHURCH advise plaintiff JOHNSON  when\nhe would be released  from punitive segregation or what he  was\n8\nrequired to do to be released  from punitive  segregation.\n74.  Defendant UPCHURCH subjected plaintiff JOHNSON  to\n10\nunnecessarily harsh and cruel practices, conditions, and\n11\npunishments while  in punitive segregation.  Defendant  UPCHURCH\n12\npermitted plaintiff JOHNSON to leave his cell to shower, brush  his\n13\nteeth, and comb his hair only every other day; he restricted  his\n14\nvisits with his father to one-half hour on Saturdays and Sundays;\n15\nhe did not permit him to receive telephone  calls from his  father;\n16\nand he did not permit him to make telephone  calls to his  father.\n17\n75.  Defendant UPCHURCH  failed to provide plaintiff  JOHNSON\n18\nwith any educational program while he was  in punitive  segregation\n19\nand defendant UPCHURCH prohibited plaintiff JOHNSON  from  taking\n20\nhis Graduate Equivalency Examination  (GED) while he was  in\n21\npunitive  segregation.\n22\n76.  Defendant UPCHURCH directed that plaintiff  JOHNSON'S\n23\nlegal papers be confiscated,  read, and  withheld.\n24\nC  FACTS IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFF M.G.'S  CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES,\n25\nAGAINST DEFENDANTS HURTT AND  KORFF\n26\n77.  M.G. was  first committed  to the custody of the  ADOC\n27\nfor probation violation, running away, and  indecent exposure  on\n28\n18\n\nf f\nSeptember 24, 1986 when he was 14 years old.\n1\n78.  While M.G. was under the care, custody, and control of\n2\nthe ADOC, he was confined at AMJI from September 26, 1986 to\n3\nOctober 29, 1986; at CMJI from October 29, 1986 to February 12,\n4\n1987; at CMJI from March 25, 1987 to August 8, 1987; at CMJI from\n5\nSeptember 4, 1987 to December 9, 1987; at AMJI from December  9,\n6\n1987 to May 18, 1987; at CMJI from May 18, 1988 to June 7, 1988;\n7\nat Sonora Desert Hospital from June 7, 1988 to June 17, 1988; at\n8\nArizona State Hospital from June 17, 1988 to July 8, 1988; at CMJI\n9\nfrom September 2, 1988 to March 2, 1989; at Jane Wayland\n10\nResidential Treatment Center from July 17, 1989 to August 28,\n11\n1989; at CMJI from August 28, 1989 to August 30, 1989; and at\n12\nAlamo Juvenile Institution  from August 30, 1989 to December 22,\n13\n1989.\n14\n79.  At the time M.G. was first committed to the custody of\n15\nthe ADOC, Defendant CAROL MOORE HURTT knew or should have known\n16\nthat M.G. was seriously emotionally handicapped and  learning\n17\ndisabled. Defendant CAROL MOORE HURTT failed to establish\n18\npolicies, procedures and regulations within the ADOC to insure\n19\nthat M.G. was properly evaluated and to insure that a treatment\n20\nplan was prepared and implemented which addressed his treatment\n21\nneeds. Instead, Defendant CAROL MOORE HURTT approved the transfer\n22\nof M.G. to CMJI which she knew or should have known was unable to\n23\nadequately meet his treatment and educational needs.\n24\n80.  Defendant CAROL MOORE HURTT knowingly and  deliberately\n25\nfailed to develop and implement regulations, rules, and policies\n26\nof the ADOC so as to insure that M.G. received treatment and\n27\neducation appropriate to his needs. Defendant CAROL MOORE HURT\n28\n19\n\nf  f.\nknowingly and deliberately failed to employ, train, and supervise\nstaff to identify and address M.G.'s treatment and educational\nneeds.\n81.  Defendant CAROL MOORE HURTT knowingly and deliberately\n4\nfailed to provide academic and special education programs for M.G.\nwhich meet the reguirements of state and federal law.\n82.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendant CAROL\nMOORE HURTT's failure to address M.G.'s treatment and educational\nneeds within the ADOC, or to place M.G. in an alternate program or\n10 setting which could identify and address his treatment and\neducational needs, M. G.'s condition progressively deteriorated\n11\nwhile he was in the custody of ADOC.\n12\n83.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendant THOMAS\n13\nKORFF's failure to develop and implement institutional policies,\n14\nrules, and regulations and as a direct and proximate result of\n15\nDefendant KORFF's failure to employ, train, and supervise staff to\n16\nprovide care and supervision for M.G., CMJI staff under the direct\n17\nsupervision and control of Defendant KORFF, and with his knowledge\n18\nand consent, repeatedly subjected M.G. to arbitrary and cruel\n19\npunishments, including placing him in handcuffs, belly-chains, and\n20\nfour-point restraints and confining him in solitary confinement\n21\nfor extended periods of time, as punishment for behavior which was\n22\nthe result of his handicapping conditions.\n23\n84.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendant THOMAS\n24\nKORFF's failure to address M.G.'s treatment and educational needs\n25\nwhile at CMJI, M. G.'s condition progressively deteriorated while\n26\nhe was at CMJI.\n27\n85.  Defendant THOMAS KORFF knowingly and deliberately\n28\n20\n\nf\n  r\nfailed to provide academic and special education programs for M.G.\nwhich meet the requirements of state and federal law.\n8 6.  At the direction of Defendants CAROL MOORE HURTT and\nTHOMAS KORFF, CMJI staff repeatedly subjected M.G. to cruel and\n4\narbitrary punishments, including confining him in solitary\nconfinement for extended periods and placing him in handcuffs,\n6\nbelly chains, and four-point restraints, as punishment for\nbehavior which was the result of his handicapping conditions.\n8\n87.  In addition to failing to provide appropriate\ntreatment for M.G. while he was in their care and custody,\n10\ndefendants CAROL MOORE HURTT and THOMAS KORFF obstructed efforts\n11\nto identify M.G.'s treatment needs by others acting on his behalf.\n12\nFor example, defendants CAROL MOORE HURTT and THOMAS KORFF\n13\nattempted to prevent plaintiffs' expert consultant from evaluating\n14\nM.G. which resulted in delays in responding to M.G.'s treatment\n15\nneeds.\n16\n88. Defendants CAROL MOORE HURTT and THOMAS KORFF knowingly\n17\nand deliberately failed to develop and implement an appropriate\n18\nrelease plan for M.G. Although they knew or should have known that\n19\nM.G. did not possess the social, academic, or vocational skills\n20\nnecessary to function successfully in a non-institutional setting\n21\nand although they knew or should have known that M.G.'s home was\n22\nan inappropriate placement, defendants CAROL MOORE HURTT and\n23\nTHOMAS KORFF nevertheless released M.G. on his eighteenth birthday\n24\nwithout transition funds or services.\n25\n89.

UPCHURCH,  in his personal\n8 | capacity,  et al.\n9\nDefendants.\n10\n11 I.  Introduction\n12 1.  This case was filed  on April 6, 1986, on behalf of Matthew  Davey Johnson,  a\n13\nresident  of Catalina  Mountain  Juvenile  Institution  (CMJI)  near Tucson.  (The\n14\ninstitution has since been renamed Catalina Mountain School.)  The Complaint\n15\nalleged  general  civil  rights  violations  stemming  from  Matthew  Johnson's\n16\nconfinement  in a punishment  cottage pursuant to the \"Motivational  Hold\" pro-\n17\ngram.  He  alleged  that  he  was  being  held  in  Yucca  Cottage  arbitrarily,  in\n18\n19 violation of his constitutionail  rights.\n20 2.  On June 27, 1986, this Court appointed counsel to represent the plaintiff,  who\nP amended his Complaint and moved for preliminary  relief.  Soon thereafter,  the\nparties  reached  an  agreement  whereby  Matthew  Johnson  was  released  from\n23\nYucca Cottage and provided  additional  services.\n3.  On April 8, 1987, the Court granted plaintiffs  motion to file a Fourth Amended\n26 Complaint  on  behalf  of  seven  residents  of  CMJI  whose  identities  were  not\n\\O 72\nRev.8/82)\n\ndisclosed  pursuant  to the terms of a protective  order.  These plaintiffs  alleged\n1 that officials responsible for the administration and operation of CMJI had failed\n2 to provide  them  with  rehabilitative  treatment,  and  had  confined  them  under\n3\nconditions amounting to punishment in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n4\nThese plaintiffs  also moved to proceed on behalf of a class of plaintiffs,  and on\n5\nJuly 29,  1987, the Court certified  a class consisting  of all residents  of CMJI,\n6\nthen and in the future.\n7\n8 4.  On May 26, 1988, the Court granted plaintiffs'  motion to file a Fifth Amended\n9 Complaint.  This complaint added as defendants the Arizona Board of Education\n10\nand  officials  responsible  for  education  at  CMJI  and  alleged  that  special\n11\neducation  programs  did  not meet  the  requirements  of  state  and  federal  law.\n12\nPlaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction requiring defendants to provide special\n13\neducation services at CMJI.\n14\n15 5.  On June  10, 1988, with the agreement  of the parties, the Court appointed  Dr.\n16\nPeter Leone, Professor of Special Education, University of Maryland, as special\n17\nmaster  for  special  education.  On  July  19,  1989,  the  Court  denied  without\n18\nprejudice  plaintiffs'  motion for preliminary  injunction  as moot.\n19\n6.  After  observing  educational  programs  at CMJI  and Adobe  Mountain  Juvenile\n20\nInstitution  (AMJI)  near  Phoenix,  and  conferring  with  state  officials  and\n21\n22 institutional personnel, Dr. Leone filed a report with the Court on November 10,\n23\n1988, which identified deficiencies  in the Department's  institutional  educational\n24\nprograms.\n25\n26\nAO 72\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nOn April 27, 1990, the Court granted plaintiffs'  motion to file a Sixth Amended\n1 Complaint  alleging  that defendants'  parole revocation procedures  are arbitrary,\n2 in  violation  of  plaintiffs'  rights  guaranteed  by  the  Fourteenth  Amendment.\n3\nPlaintiffs'  moved  for  summary judgment  and  on August  20,  1990, the  Court\n4 !\ndenied this motion on the grounds that there are genuine issues of material  fact.\n5\nOn May  17, 1989, Governor Rose Mofford  advised the Court that the state was\n6\nmoving  toward  a comprehensive  reform  of its juvenile justice  system  and, on\n7\nMay 25, 1989, Governor Mofford  signed an executive order recognizing a right\n9 to treatment in the least restrictive environment consistent with public safety  for\n10\nall youth in juvenile institutions  operated by the state.\n11\nOn September  22, 1989, the Governor signed an Executive  Order  establishing\n12\na Select Commission on Juvenile Corrections to study the state's juvenile justice\n13\nsystem and recommend  reforms.  The Commission  conducted  research  on state\n14\n15 and national programs for delinquent youth and consulted with juvenile justice\n16 professionals.  The Commission  also held public hearings and heard testimony\n17\nfrom juvenile  court judges,  childrens'  advocates,  private  providers,  probation\n18\nofficers,  and others.\n19\n10. The Commission reported specific recommendations  for reform to the Governor\n20\non  May  17,  1990.  The  Commission  also  recommended  that  the  Governor\n21\n22 appoint a Task Force on Juvenile Corrections to implement its recommendations.\n23 Governor  Mofford  signed an executive order on June 5, 1990, creating  a Task\n24\nForce on Juvenile  Corrections  and the Court continued  the trial to provide  an\n25\n26\n.O 72\n^ev.8/82)\n\nopportunity  for  the  defendants  to  implement  the  recommendations  of  the\n1 Commission.  On May  15, 1991, Governor Fife Symington signed an executive\n2 | order extending  the Task Force's term of operation.\n3 i!\n11.  On October  16, 1990, the parties  reached  agreement  on individual  claims  for\ndamages by Matthew Johnson and M. G., a named plaintiff and class representa-\n5 i\ntive.\n6\n12.  On October 22, 1991, the Court awarded interim attorneys fees for plaintiffs and\n7\n8 on June  28,  1992, the  parties  finally  resolved  all pending  issues  concerning\n9\nattorneys  fees.\n10\n13.

Orientation/Youth  Handbook\n14\n15 1.  The  Department  shall  provide  each  committed  youth  with  a copy  of a youth\n16 handbook.  The purpose of this handbook  is to advise youth of their rights and\n17\ninform  them  about the institutional  program,  applicable  rules  of conduct,  and\n18\npotential  sanctions  for  violations  of  rules.  The  Department  shall  make  the\n19\nhandbook  available in Spanish.\n20\n2.  The Department  shall  also provide an orientation  for  every  committed  youth.\n21\n22 The  orientation  shall  include  information  on  the  rights  of  youth  in  the\n23\ninstitutional  program, responsibilities  of youth in secure confinement,  rules of\n24\nconduct,  and potential  sanctions.\n25\n26\n17\nAO 72\n(Rev 8/82)\n\nXI.  Staff\n1.  The Department  shall employ qualified  casework,  recreation,  direct child-care,\n1\nj\n23 j and other staff  in sufficient  numbers and with sufficient  training.\ni\n2.  A sufficient  number of direct child-care  workers means not less than  1 worker\n4 !! to 8 youth during the afternoon  shift,  and not less than  1 worker to 16 youth\n5\nduring normal sleeping hours.\n6\n3.  Qualifications  for direct-care  staff  shall include, at a minimum,  six months of\n7\nexperience working with youth in organized activities or programs.  Successful\n8\ncompletion  of fifteen  (15) semester  hours  of studies  in social  or  behavioral\n9\n10 sciences  applicable  to  a  bachelors  degree  may  substitute  for  the  required\n11\nexperience.\n12 '!'!\n4.  The  Department  shall  provide  adequate  training  appropriate  to  the  job\n13\nassignment  for administrative  staff,  youth  caseworkers,  specialist  employees,\n14\nsupport staff, and part-time  staff.\n15\nXII.  Protection  from Arbitrary  Punishments\n16\n17 1.  Exclusion\n18\nA.  Exclusion  is removal  of a youth  from  regular programming  or contact\n19\nwith other youth by confinement  in a locked room, except during normal\n20\nsleeping  hours.  The room may or may not be the youth's  own room.\n21\nExclusion  may  be  used  only  for  a  \"cooling  off  period,  not  for\n22\npunishment  or the convenience  of staff,  and shall  not exceed  2 hours.\n23\n24 Staff shall explain the reasons for exclusion and provide an opportunity\n25\n26\nAO 72\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nfor the youth  to explain  his/her  behavior.  The Department's  goal  is to\n1 limit the use of exclusion and, when youth must be excluded, to limit the\n2 time  in exclusion.  Staff  shall  interact  with  youth  in exclusion  at least\n3\nevery  30 minutes  to attempt  to return the youth  to the regular  cottage\n4\nprogram.\n5\n2.  Separation\n6\nA.  Separation is confinement  in a designated security unit to segregate youth\n7\n8 from  the  general  population.  Separation  is  a  serious  and  extreme\n9 measure  which  staff  shall  not  impose  unless  necessary  to protect  the\n10\nyouth or others from  imminent risk of injury,  to prevent  imminent  and\n11\nsubstantial  destruction  of property,  to prevent  imminent  and substantial\n12\ndisruption  of  the  facility,  or  where  there  are  reasonable  grounds  to\n13\nbelieve that a youth is a serious and continuing  escape  risk.  It may not\n14\nbe imposed as punishment for infractions of institutional  rules, or for the\n15\n16 convenience  of  staff.  The  Department  may  separate  a  youth  who\n17\nrequests  separation  and  does not meet  these  criteria,  but  must  release\n18\nsuch youth upon request unless they meet these criteria.  [Note:  Medical\n19\nisolation is not separation and is not governed  by this section.]\n20\nB.  The Department shall designate Crisis Management  Teams composed  of\n21\n22 staff specially trained in crisis intervention techniques.  These teams shall\n23 attempt to avoid the use of separation  by mediating  conflicts  involving\n24\nyouth.  If less restrictive  efforts  to resolve conflicts  are unsuccessful  or\n25\n26\n19\nAO 72\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nimpractical, the Crisis Management Team may escort youth to separation.\nYouth may be admitted to separation with the approval of the responsible\n1\n2 supervisor  or responsible  caseworker  present  at the youth's  institution.\n3\nStaff shall not routinely apply restraint devices to youth while escorting\n4\nthem to separation.\n5  J\nC.  When a youth  is admitted  to a separation  unit, staff  shall  immediately\n6\ndevelop  an  action  plan  to  resolve  the  conflict  so that  the  youth  may\n7\nreturn  to  the  cottage  program.  The  action  plan  shall  include  release\n8\n9 criteria.  The action plan shall also identify  the behaviors which must be\n10\naddressed  for the youth to be released  from  separation  and the way in\n11\nwhich  the Department  will  encourage  these  behaviors,  including  goals\n12\nand timetables leading to release.  Staff shall release youth from separa-\n13\ntion  when they  have  met the  release  criteria  as outlined  in the  action\n14\nplan,  and shall  not  impose  by policy  or practice  minimum  periods  of\n15\n16 time  in  separation  for  designated  behaviors  or  offenses.  Stable,\n17\ncooperative behavior and meeting the release criteria indicate that separa-\n18\ntion is unnecessary.\n19\nD.  The Department shall not confine any youth in separation for longer than\n20\n24  hours  without  providing  a  hearing  within  24  hours  to  determine\n21\nwhether continued  separation  is necessary to protect the youth or others\n22\n23 from  imminent  risk  of  injury,  to  prevent  imminent  and  substantial\n24 property damage, to prevent substantial disruption of the facility, or there\n25\n26\n20\nAO 72\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nare  reasonable  grounds  to  believe  that  the  youth  is  a  serious  and\ncontinuing escape risk.  In making that determination,  the hearing  officer\n1\n2 shall review the action plan for reasonableness  and the youth's  progress\n3\ntoward meeting the release criteria.  The Department  shall provide youth\n4\nwith  written  and  verbal  notification  of its reasons  for  continued  sepa-\n5\nration,  and  shall  make  available  an  advocate  to  assist  the  youth  in\n6\npresenting  information  at the hearing.  The youth has a right to contact\n7\na parent  or  guardian,  to speak  on his own  behalf  or  remain  silent,  to\n8\n9 present evidence, and to question  witnesses.  The Department  shall not\n10\nconfine  a youth  in separation  longer than 24 hours unless an  impartial\n11\nhearing  officer  makes  written  findings  supporting  specific  separation\n12\ncriteria  based  upon  information  presented  at the hearing.  The  Depart-\n13\nment shall provide an opportunity  for prompt review of the decision of\n14\nthe hearing officer  and shall provide the youth with written  notification\n15\n16 of the outcome of the review and the reasons.\n17\nThe youth's  caseworker  shall review the action plans, and the  youth's\n18\nprogress towards release, at least daily for  all youth held in separation\n19\nlonger than 48 hours.  The Deputy  Director  or designee  must  approve\n20\ncontinued confinement  of a youth daily after the fifth day.  The Director,\n21\nor  in  the  Director's  absence,  the  Deputy  Director,  must  approve\n22\n23 continued  confinement  daily after the tenth day.\n24\nThe  size,  furnishings,  lighting,  heat  and  ventilation  of  the  separation\n25\n26\n21\nAO 72\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nrooms  shall  approximate  the  conditions  in  the  regular  living  cottages.\nAbsent  a documented  need  to remove  an  item  to protect  a youth,  the\n1\n2 Department  shall  provide  youth  in  separation  with  a  bed,  mattress,\n3\npillow,  sheets,  blankets,  regular  clothing,  and  reading  materials.  The\n4\nDepartment  shall also allow a youth  in separation  to send  and  receive\n5\nmail, to visit with parents, guardians and attorneys, and to participate in\n6\neducational  and  recreational  programs,  except  in  those  unusual\n7\ncircumstances  when doing so would jeopardize  safety and security.\n8\n9 G.  The Department  shall maintain  a log which  records  the name of every\nyouth  confined  in  separation,  the  date  and  time  of  confinement,  the\n11  ii\nreasons  for confinement,  including  specific  descriptions  of the  youth's\n12 i!\nbehavior,  the name of the individual  who has approved  separation,  and\n13\nthe date and time of release.  The signatures  of the persons  who  have\n14\n15 approved separation and its extension shall be maintained  in the youth's\n16 security  file.\n17\n3. Mechanical  Restraints\n18\nA.  The use of restraint devices is an extreme and exceptional measure which\n19\nshall  be  used  only  when  a  youth  is  out  of  control  and  other  less\n20\nrestrictive means to bring the youth under control have failed.  Members\n21\n22 of the Crisis Management  Team or other staff who are specially  trained\n23 in the  use  of restraint  devices  and  crisis  intervention  techniques  may\n24\nrestrain a youth to protect the youth or others from imminent harm or to\n25\n26\n22\nAO 72\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nL\nprevent  substantial  property  damage.  Staff  shall  remove  the  restraint\ndevices when they are no longer necessary  to protect the youth or others\n1\n2 from  imminent harm or to prevent substantial  property damage.\n3\nB.  Staff must continuously observe youth in restraint devices and a licensed\n4\nmedical  staff  person must check  the youth  immediately  after  restraints\n5  |\nare  applied  and  at  least  every  30  minutes  thereafter.  A  licensed\nยซ!\nii\npsychologist  must authorize  the use of restraints after  two hours, and a\n7 I!\npsychiatrist  must  authorize  the  use  of continued  restraints  after  three\n9 hours.\n10\nC.  Youth shall not be restrained to each other or to fixed objects, except that\n11\na youth's  arms  and  legs  may  be secured  to a bed  frame  with  soft  re-\n12\nstraints  if  authorized  by  the  psychologist  or  on-call  Central  Office\n13\nAdministrator.  Staff  may  contact  the  psychologist  or  on-call  Central\n14\n15 Office  Administrator  for  authorization  immediately  subsequent  to\n16 restraining  the youth,  if the youth's  behavior  actively  poses  immediate\n17\nphysical harm to self or others.\n18\nD.  The Department shall maintain a log containing the names of each youth\n19\nplaced in restraint devices, the time the youth was restrained, the time the\n20\nrestraints were removed, a description of the events leading to the use of\n21\n22 restraints,  and the name of the individual  who has approved  restraints.\n23\nThe signatures of the persons approving the use of mechanical  restraints\n24\nand its extension  shall be maintained  in the youth's security  file.\n25\n26\n23\nAO 72\n(Rev 8/82)\n\nE.  The Department  shall not routinely  restrain youth during  transportation\nto or from secure facilities, but may restrain youth during  transportation\n1\n2 when  staff  have  reasonable  grounds  to  believe  that  use  of  restraint\n3\ndevices is necessary  to protect the safety of the youth or others.  Youth\n4\nrestrained during transportation may not be restrained to one another, but\n5\nare not subject to the other provisions of subsections  A, B, C and D of\n6\nthis section.\n7\n8 XIII.  Parole Revocation\n9 When the Department  believes that a youth has violated  a term of conditional\n10\nliberty, it may initiate revocation proceedings pursuant to A.R.S. ยง41-2819.  The\n11\nDepartment may take a youth into custody pursuant to A.R.S. ยง41-2819 or may\n12\nserve  the  youth  with  a citation  to  appear  at a probable  cause  hearing.  The\n13\nDepartment  shall  inform  any  youth  served  with  a  warrant  or  citation  of  the\n14\nreasons  for the initiation  of the revocation  proceedings  and the youth's  rights\n15\n16 related to the proceedings.\n17\nWithin 72 hours of a youth's  return to a secure  facility,  the Department  shall\n18\nprovide  or ensure  a hearing  to determine  whether  there  is probable  cause  to\n19\nbelieve that the youth has violated a term of conditional liberty and whether or\n20\nnot  the  youth  shall  remain  in  a  secure  facility  to  assure  attendance  at  a\n21\nrevocation  hearing and/or for community  safety, or the safety  of the youth.\n22\n23 The Department  shall provide or ensure a hearing for youth within  10 business\n24\ndays of detention  to determine  whether conditional  liberty should  be revoked.\n25\n26\n24\nAO 72\n(Rev .8/82)\n\nThe  Department  shall  provide  specially  trained,  impartial  hearing  examiners,\n1 acting  under  the direct  supervision  of an attorney,  to hear  parole  revocations.\n2 The Department  shall make available  an attorney, or an advocate  acting  under\n3\nthe  direct  supervision  of  an  attorney,  to  assist  youth  at  parole  revocation\n4\nhearings.  Hearing examiners and advocates shall not be supervised  by the same\n5\nattorney.  Youth shall have a right to written notice of the charges,  to remain\n6\nsilent,  to  call  witnesses,  and  to  question  adverse  witnesses.  The  hearing\n7\n8 examiner  shall make written findings of fact.\n9 XIV.  Implementation  and Monitoring\n10\n1.  The Department  shall prepare a plan or plans within 90 days to implement  this\n11  i\nConsent Decree.  The implementation  plan(s) shall include a description  of the\n12\ntasks to be accomplished, personnel (individuals or job titles) responsible for the\n13\ntasks, and timetables  for completion  of the tasks.\n14\n15 2.  A Committee  of Consultants  (Committee)  composed  of one person  designated\n16\nby  the  plaintiffs,  one  person  designated  by the  Department,  and  one  person\n17\njointly  designated  by the  parties  whose  designation  will  be  subject  to  Court\n18\napproval, shall review the adequacy of the plan(s) implementing  all sections  of\n19\nthis Consent Decree and shall monitor for the Department's compliance with the\n20\nplan(s).

CIV 86-195 TUC  RMB\n6\nPlaintiff,\n7\nvs.\n8\nJAMES R. UPCHURCH,  et al.,\n9\nDefendants.\n10\n11\n12\nORDER RE: CONSENT DECREE POPULATION  LIMITATIONS\n13\n14\nOn May 6,1993, the Court approved a Consent Decree which placed population\n15\nlimitations on the number of youths who could be confined at the Arizona Department\n16\nof  Juvenile  Corrections  (\"ADJC\").  Specifically,  the  Consent  Decree  provided  in\n17\nrelevant part:\n18\nThe  Department  shall not  average  more than  110 youth  at CMS  each\n19 month,  240  youth  at  AMS  each  month,  and  30  youth  in  the  BCS\nresidential program each month, unless additional physical facilities  are\n20 constructed to house such youtns  in accordance with the standards set\nforth  in paragraph 2{B).\n21\nSee Consent Decree, IIL2.A. at 7.  The Decree further  requires that ADJC obtain  the\n22\nconsent of the Committee of Consultants before increasing the total number of secure\n23\nbeds.  Id., III.2.C. at 8.\n24\nAt no time has ADJC been in compliance with the Consent Decree population\n25\nlimitations.\n26\nSubsequent to the Decree, A.R.S. ยง 8-241 was enacted.  That statute confers upon\nthe juvenile courts the authority to not only commit youth to the Department, but to\nโข\\\n\nalso designate minimum lengths of stay in secure confinement.  A.R.S. ยง 8-241 in effect,\neliminates the discretion previously held by the Department to regulate its population.\nTo  address  an  increasing  population,  ADJC  sought  the  approval  of  the\nCommittee  of  Consultants  and  the  Court  to  increase  the  number  of  its  secure\nresidential beds.  Based on the recommendations from the Committee of Consultants,\nthe Court  authorized  increasing the capacity of AMS from  240 to 312 beds and BCS\n7  from 30 residential beds to 120 beds.  See Order of November 27, 1995.  Approval was\nalso given for new construction: a 24-bed boot camp and two 24-bed cottages, subject\nto  design  approval  and  meeting  Consent  Decree  standards.  Id.  That  Order\n10  immediately  increased  the  bed  capacity  at  the  three  institutions  to  542  with  an\n11  additional 72 beds made available upon completion.  Despite this increased  capacity,\n12  demographic factors and significant changes in Arizona law have prevented ADJC from\n13  satisfying  the population limits.\n14  The Committee of Consultants submitted their Fifth Semi-Annual Report on the\n15  Implementation  of  the  Consent  Decree  (the  \"Report\")  on January  30,  1996.  The\n16  Report  found  that  ADJC  was violating  the population  limits  by  51 youths.  The\n17  Report  recommended  that  ADJC  be  held  accountable  to  the  Consent  Decree\n18  population  provisions.\n19  At hearing held February 9. 1996, ADJC assured the Court that by applying a\n20  variety  of program  options, it would  be at, or under, the population  caps within 60\n21  days.  Based on those assurances, the Court  ordered:\n22  that  Director  Eugene Moore  and the Arizona  Department  of Juvenile\nCorrections shall be in compliance with the Consent Decree on or before\n23  5:00 P.M., APRIL 9, 1996.  Director Moore shall submit  a compliance\nreport  to the Court  If this report does not satisfy  the Court,  the\n24  Court shall issue an Order at 5:01 PJvl., April 9, 1996 which will ensure\nDJC complies with the terms of the Consent Decree.\n25\nSee Order of February 21, 1996.\n26\nThe  Department  asserts  today  that  it  made  its  assurances  to  the  Court  on\n27\n28\n\nFebruary 9, 1996 based on juvenile court commitment  practices during the period of\nOctober 1995 through December 1995. Unanticipated at the time, was.that the number\nof  youth  committed  to  ADJC  with  determinate  lengths  of  stay  would  increase  by\n14.5%.  According to ADJC, despite the Administrative Office of the Courts' promise\nthat  the juvenile courts would endeavor to limit commitments  to those youths  who\nsatisfy  the commitment  guidelines, this has not occurred.  Instead, since February 9,\n1996, the  secure  care population  has exceeded  the requirements  set by the  Consent\nDecree  by an average of 78 youths.  As of April 9, 1996, ADJC's secure  population\nexceeded the capacity by 72 youth.\n10  As required by the Court's February 9, 1996 Order, Defendants submitted  on\n11  March  20,  1996 their  Plan  for  Complying with  the population  requirements  of  the\n12  Decree.  After reviewing the Plan, the Court finds: (1) the Plan gives no estimate as to\n13  the projected  population  reductions which  would  occur  as a result  of the  proposed\n14  programs;  (2) the overcrowding has actually increased since the Court's February  9,\n15  1996 Order; and (3) Defendants' proposal that the capacity of Adobe Mountain School\n16  be  temporarily  increased  until  the  new  construction  at  Black  Canyon  School  is\n17  completed  is  contrary  to  Decree  requirements.  Accordingly,  the  Court  rejects\n18  Defendants'  Plan as inadequate and in violation of Decree requirements.\n19  This dilemma is the direct result of the Department's ongoing failure to provide\n20  adequate physical facilities and personnel to staff those facilities.  The juvenile judges\n21  of this State have been forced into an untenable position:  Do they commit youths to\n22  overcrowded  state institutions, keep them in overcrowded  local institutions  (if such\n23  even exists), or release them back to the community?  This was to be solved by the\n24  State when it agreed to the Consent Decree.  The State has defaulted on its agreement\n25  and this Court has no recourse but to force Defendants  to live up to their agreement.\n26\n27\n28\nโขT\n\n1  Having  considered  these  issues,  relevant  documents,  ADJC  March  20,  1996\n2  Population  Plan,  the Committee  of  Consultants'  recommendations,  and good  cause\n3  appearing  therefor,\n4  IT IS ORDERED  that:\n5  (1)  The  Arizona  Department  of  Juvenile  Corrections  is  in  violation  of\n6  Paragraph  III.2.A. of the Consent Decree;\n7  (2)  ADJC  is hereby  enjoined  as of  this date  from  accepting  any youth  in\n8  excess of 110 at Catalina Mountain School; 312 at Adobe Mountain School and 120 at\n9  Black Canyon School;\n10  (3)  Those youth  received by the Department  must meet one of the criteria\n11  set forth  in the Consent Decree at Section III.l.A.(l).\n12  (4)  Each youth in the custody of ADJC shall be provided equal access to the\n13  full continuum  of services offered  by ADJC as prescribed  by Section IV.2.D. of  the\n14  Consent Decree;\n15  (5)  Nothing herein alters or amends this Court's November 27, 1996 Order\n16  provided that the yet-to-be-constructed two 24-beds units and the 24-boot camp comply\n17  with the full continuum of services;\n18  (6)  In the event that there is limited bed space for committed youth waiting\n19  transportation to the physical custody of ADJC, it shall contact the respective juvenile\n20  courts to give the committing courts the opportunity to meet and confer in order to\n21  designate which committed youth shall be placed in ADJC's secure care.  In the event\n22  that the committing courts cannot agree among themselves within two working days,\n23  the decision  of which youth shall be placed in ADJC custody shall be made by the\n24  Chief Justice of the Arizona Supreme Court or his designee;\n25  (7)  No youth for whom a revocation proceeding pursuant to A.R.S. ยง 41-2819\n26  has been or will be instituted, shall be held in a secure facility operated by the ADJC\n27\n28  4\n\nif such placement  will exceed the population provisions approved  by this  Court;\n(8)  No youth who has been assigned to conditional liberty by ADJC who is\narrested for a new offense shall be placed in a secure facility operated by ADJC pending\na probable cause hearing;\n(9)  If, following a probable cause hearing, it is determined to prosecute on the\nnew offense(s)  such youth  will not  be placed in a secure facility  operated  by  ADJC\n7  prior to sentencing;\n8  (10)  Nothing shall prohibit the Department from petitioning the Committee\nof Consultants for additional beds in accordance with the Consent Decree;\n10  (11)  ADJC shall continue to submit reports to the Committee of Consultants\n11  in accordance with the Court's February 21, 1996 Order;\n12  (12)  If ADJC is not in compliance with this Order by 5:00 P.M., May 9, 1996,\n13  Defendants  shall be held in contempt of court.\n14\n15  DATED  this J_  day of  fTf/n  I  ^  1996,\n16\n17 ^ โข < 3 u^\nRichard M.
