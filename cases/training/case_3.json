    "summary": "<p>On April 25, 1979, a class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, on behalf of a class of children in Cook County, Illinois, who were either wards of the juvenile court or had petitions for wardship pending, and had emotional, physical, or mental disabilities.  The plaintiffs represented by the Cook County Public Guardian alleged that the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCSF), the Illinois Department of Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities (DMHDD), and the State Board of Education (SBE) refused to provide them with necessary services because of their disabilities, in violation of their equal protection rights under 29 U.S.C. § 794 (the Rehabilitation Act of 1973).  In late 1981, the case was settled by consent decree. The three Illinois agencies promised to provide appropriate services to children 17 or under who were in need of special services.  In 1995 the Illinois legislature enacted a law curtailing the DCSF's authority to provide services to children over 13 who had been adjudicated delinquent, but not abused or neglected and were not dependent on the state. The DCSF asked the court to modify the consent decree so that it would be relieved of any duty to care for delinquents over the age of 13.  On September 27, 1996, the court (Chief Judge Marvin Aspen) denied DCSF's motion to vacate or modify, reasoning that DCSF had not demonstrated that that the plaintiff's claim--that they had been discriminated against because of the severity of their disabilities--falls outside the Rehabilitation Act.  David B. v. Patla, 950 F.Supp. 841 (N.D. Ill. 1996). The District Court also found that state law did not prohibit the agency from providing services to delinquent minors, but only prohibited these minors from being taken into custody by DCSF or committed to DCSF by a Juvenile Court.The plaintiffs appealed and on June 16, 1997, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals (Judge Frank Easterbrook), vacated the judgment and remanded the case. David B. v. McDonald, 116 F.3d 1146 (7th Cir. 1997). The Court of Appeals instructed the District Court to determine whether a substantial federal claim supported the decree as a whole, and if not, to lift the decree.</p><p>On December 2, 1997, the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois vacated the consent decree.  The plaintiffs appealed claiming that the consent decree was substantially based on federal law. On March 12, 1998, the court (Judge Aspen) in an unpublished opinion, found that the Rehabilitation Act did not support the plaintiff's claim, but that the substantive Due Process claim could support at least some of the plaintiffs' claims.  David B. v. McDonald, No. 98-1796, 1998 WL 111705 (N.D. Ill. March 12, 1998).  The court ordered that the decree be modified to permit Illinois to reallocate tasks among its agencies and to reduce the services to persons adjudicated delinquents, and that the decree only applied to minors who had been declared wards of the state, whose guardians are state agencies, or who are in the physical custody of the state.  </p><p>On September 28, 1998, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals (Judge Easterbrook), found that the plaintiffs' new theory of the case under the 14th Amendment required that the defendants be the juveniles' custodians, because only custody created the corresponding duty to assume some responsibility for the ward's safety and well being.  David B. v. McDonald, 156 F.3d 780 (7th Cir. 1998).  The court also found that the real party in interest was the state itself, and therefore the 11th Amendment deprives the District Court of jurisdiction.

Murphy (argued), Office of the Cook County Public Guardian, Chicago, IL, for plaintiff-appellee.\nBarbara L. Greenspan (argued), A. Benjamin Goldgar, Office of the Attorney General, Chicago, IL, for defendant-\nappellant.\nBefore COFFEY, EASTERBROOK, and KANNE, Circuit Judges.\nEASTERBROOK, Circuit Judge.\nNow almost 20 years old, this case has reached the end of the line. It was filed in 1979 by the Cook County\n[1]\nPublic Guardian on behalf of delinquent children with emotional or mental problems.  The Public Guardian\n782 asked the court to require the defendants to provide for class members the same suite of *782 social services\nthey supplied to other emotionally or mentally handicapped youngsters who had not engaged in misconduct. The\nsuit was settled when the defendants promised to continue operating a new program called the Governor's Youth\nServices Initiative:\nIn 1981 the heads of three Illinois agencies 00 the Department of Mental Health and\n97\nDevelopmental Disabilities, the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS), and the\nState Board of Education 00 signed a consent decree promising to provide \"appropriate\" services\n97\nto children, 17 years of age or less, who \"[a]re in need of specialized services including, but not\nlimited to child welfare, mental health and education.\" A program called the Governor's Youth\nServices Initiative (GYSI) coordinates the way these agencies deal with teenagers. In 1995 the\nlegislature of Illinois enacted a statute curtailing the DCFS'S authority to provide services to\nchildren over the age of 13 who have been adjudicated \"delinquent\" but have not been found to be\nabused, neglected, or dependent. 20 ILCS 505/5(l). \"Delinquency\" in Illinois means crime. 705\nILCS 405/53(1). Acts that lead to this designation run the gamut from vehicular hijacking to sexual\nassault to murder. Confronted with potentially inconsistent obligations under the statute and the\nconsent decree, the DCFS asked ... to be relieved of any duty to provide services to delinquents\nover the age of 13.\nDavid B. v. McDonald, 116 F.3d 1146, 1147 (7th Cir.1997). After the district judge denied the agency's request,\nwe remanded so that the court could determine whether the case is within federal jurisdiction and, if it is, whether\n\"a substantial federal claim supports the decree as a whole\" today. Id. at 1150. The district court concluded that\nthe eleventh amendment deprives the court of jurisdiction and vacated the consent decree. 1997 U.S. Dist.\nLEXIS 19529. On a motion for reconsideration, however, the judge changed his mind and held that the court has\njurisdiction and that a substantial federal claim continues to exist 00 although the judge did relieve the defendants\n97\nof several obligations under the decree. 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2982. According to the district court, the\nsubstantial federal claim rests on the proposition that when a state \"takes a person into its custody and holds him\nthere against his will, the Constitution imposes upon it a corresponding duty to assume some responsibility for his\nsafety and general well-being.\" DeShaney v. Winnebago County Department of Social Services, 489 U.S. 189,\n199-200, 109 S.Ct. 998, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (1989).\n\nThe principle that custodians must protect their wards supplies a \"substantial federal claim\" only if there is reason\nto believe that Illinois is violating its constitutional obligations (or would be doing so, but for the consent decree).\nBut the district court did not say that the Constitution requires a state to provide youths with \"specialized services\nincluding, but not limited to child welfare, mental health and education.\" Illinois endeavors to provide safety, food,\nmedical attention, education and other social services to youngsters in its custody, so to the extent some services\nmay be constitutionally essential, see Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982);\nD.W. v. Rogers, 113 F.3d 1214 (11th Cir.1997), there is still no substantial federal claim that Illinois has failed to\nmeet its obligations. The district judge did not identify any constitutionally required service that Illinois withholds.\nCounsel for the plaintiff class contends that the end of the consent decree or the GYSI program would itself be\nthe violation of due process. That's untenable, for reasons we articulated in one of DeShaney's precursors. \nArchie v. Racine, 847 F.2d 1211, 1215-18 (7th Cir.1988) (en banc). Consent decrees are vacated all the time 00\n97\nthey have been vacated wholesale under 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b), part of the Prison Litigation Reform Act 00 and it\n97\nwould be absurd to say that consent decrees (or related state legislation, in this case 20 ILCS 505/17a-11\nestablishing the GYSI) establish the meaning of the Constitution, so that vacatur is impossible. See Hadix v.\nJohnson, 133 F.3d 940 (6th Cir. 1998).\nA thorough search for a \"substantial federal claim\" that might support this consent decree is unnecessary,\n783 however, because *783 the district judge was right the first time: the eleventh amendment, extended in Hans v.\nLouisiana, 134 U.S. 1, 10 S.Ct. 504, 33 L.Ed. 842 (1890), to federal-question cases, deprives the court of\njurisdiction. Plaintiffs can't sue the state in its own name, see Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44,\n116 S.Ct. 1114, 134 L.Ed.2d 252 (1996), and used the standard end-run: they sued named officeholders. Ex\nparte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908). Young treats public officials who violate federal\nlaw as renegades, acting ultra vires, who therefore may be enjoined without enjoining the state itself. But a suit\nagainst a public official as representative of the state (rather than as a renegade) is a suit against the state. Will v.\nMichigan Department of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989); Kentucky v. Graham,\n473 U.S. 159, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 87 L.Ed.2d 114 (1985). So if the Director of the Department of Corrections violated\nthe due process clause by failing to educate confined juveniles, the juveniles could not sue the state's\nSuperintendent of Education and demand that he supply an education on behalf of the state; that would be at war\nwith the foundation of Young because it would treat the state and its agents as fungible. To take advantage of \nYoung the plaintiffs must sue the particular public official whose acts violate federal law.\nBack in 1979, the three defendants were appropriate to the theory of the case. Plaintiffs contended that § 504 of\nthe Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), required these defendants' agencies to provide delinquent\nyouths with the same services they provided to other teenagers with similar emotional or mental problems, but no\nhistory of criminal activity. Any difference, the complaint alleged, is disability discrimination. Last time the case\nwas here we concluded that this contention, if it had ever supplied a federal claim substantial enough to impose\non the state a long-term obligation that its legislature is powerless to alter, does so no longer. 116 F.3d at 1149.\nPlaintiffs' new theory, based on the due process clause, requires new defendants: the juveniles' custodians, for it\nis only custody that creates the \"corresponding duty to assume some responsibility for [the ward's] safety and\ngeneral well-being.\" The district judge wrote:\nWhen a delinquent minor becomes a ward of the court, the court assumes enormous control over\nhis or her life: to pick a few examples, the court may appoint a new guardian or custodian, order\nthe minor committed to the Department of Corrections or DCFS (depending on his or her age),\ndeclare the minor to be emancipated, or place the minor on probation. See 705 ILCS 405/5-23. In\na sense, the court becomes a \"super-guardian\" with the power to select (and, when necessary, to\nchange) the minor's actual guardians and custodians, and once the court assumes this power it\nmay retain it until the child attains the age of 19 years, see 705 ILCS 405/5-34; In re W.C., 167\nIll.2d 307, 657 N.E.2d 908, 918, 212 Ill.Dec. 563 (Ill.1995).\nAlthough the rationale of DeShaney could support relief against custodians such as the supervisors of the\n\"residential treatment\" centers where class members may be detained, or even perhaps that \"super-guardian\" the\nJuvenile Court, it cannot support relief against the defendants in this case 00 not unless all senior public officials\n97\n\nare treated as alter egos of the real party in interest, the state itself. That is how the district court treated them,\nwhich brings the case within Hans.\nPlaintiffs are free to initiate proceedings against any state official who today has custody of class members and is\nviolating federal statutory or constitutional law. Our three defendants and their agencies, however, do not\n784 exercise the control that could support a claim under DeShaney.[2] The Juvenile *784 Court, which may exercise\ncustody (or determine who else does), is not an appropriate defendant; instead of haling the court and its judges\ninto a federal forum, the plaintiffs must make their argument to the state judges in the delinquency or\nguardianship litigation, and appeal any adverse decisions through the usual hierarchy. See Younger v. Harris,\n401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971); Nelson v. Murphy, 44 F.3d 497 (7th Cir.1995). Inferior federal\ncourts are not authorized to review the decisions of the Juvenile Court. Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413,\n44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923); District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct.\n1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); T.W. v. Brophy, 124 F.3d 893 (7th Cir.1997). State courts may compel the\ndefendants to implement 20 ILCS 505/17a-11, if that statute survives the termination of the consent decree and\nmore recent state laws, such as 20 ILCS 505/5(l). Enforcement of state law against a state is not a task that the\neleventh amendment permits a federal court to perform. Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman, 465\nU.S. 89, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984). Young leaves the door of the federal court-house ajar for claims\nbased on federal law, but only if Young's premises obtain. When the theory behind this litigation moved from the\nRehabilitation Act to the due process clause, the identity of the appropriate defendants changed, and the case\nagainst these three defendants therefore moved from the domain of Young to that of Hans.\nThe judgment of the district court is vacated, and the case is remanded with instructions to set aside the consent\ndecree and dismiss the proceeding for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n[1] The district court certified a class of \"[a]ll children residing or found in Cook County, Illinois who: \nA. Are seventeen years of age or less, or, if the person is a ward of the Juvenile Court, twenty years of age or\nless; and\nB. Are referred to Juvenile Court; and\nC. Are alleged to have engaged in conduct or whose parents are alleged to have engaged in conduct in violation\nof the Illinois Juvenile Court Act; and\nD. Are in need of specialized services including but not limited to child welfare, mental health and education; and\nE. Have been denied appropriate services by one or more of the defendants, their agents and employees, after\nhaving made the necessary applications for such services.\"\nNeither the class definition nor the consent decree defines \"appropriate services\" or identifies which children are\n\"in need\" of them.\n[2] Judge Dempsey of the Juvenile Justice Division of the Circuit Court of Cook County described the status of\nemotionally or mentally handicapped juvenile delinquents in the plaintiff class who are held for \"residential\ntreatment\" but are not sent to the Department of Corrections for incarceration: \"The juvenile court does not place\nthe child in the custody of DCFS or GYSI or commit the child to DCFS or GYSI as guardian. The court does not\nappoint any custodian or guardian for the children. The parent retains all parental rights except the right to\ndetermine where the child will reside during the period of probation. The child is a ward of the court and not of\nany of the agencies that participate in GYSI.\"\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Steimel, Office of the Attorney General,\nChicago, IL, for Defendant-Appellant.\nBefore COFFEY, EASTERBROOK and KANNE, Circuit Judges.\n[*]\nRehearing and Suggestion for Rehearing En Banc Denied August 5, 1997.\nEASTERBROOK, Circuit Judge.\nIn 1981 the heads of three Illinois agencies 00 the Department of Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities,\n97\nthe Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS), and the State Board of Education 00 signed a consent\n97\ndecree promising to provide \"appropriate\" services to children, 17 years of age or less, who \"[a]re in need of\nspecialized services including, but not limited to child welfare, mental health and education.\" A program called the\nGovernor's Youth Services Initiative (GYSI) coordinates the way these agencies deal with teenagers. In 1995 the\nlegislature of Illinois enacted a statute curtailing the DCFS's authority to provide services to children over the age\nof 13 who have been adjudicated \"delinquent\" but have not been found to be abused, neglected, or dependent.\n20 ILCS 505/5(l). \"Delinquency\" in Illinois means crime. 705 ILCS 405/53(1). Acts that lead to this designation run\nthe gamut from vehicular hijacking to sexual assault to murder. Confronted with potentially inconsistent\nobligations under the statute and the consent decree, the DCFS asked the district court to be relieved of any duty\nto provide services to delinquents over the age of 13. A change of law may justify, or even require, a modification\nof a consent decree, see Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 112 S.Ct. 748, 116 L.Ed.2d 867\n(1992); Evans v. Chicago, 10 F.3d 474 (7th Cir.1993) (en banc), unless a federal law independent of the decree\nrequires the parties to continue as before. The only federal law that supports the decree is § 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act 00 according to the plaintiffs, before 1981 the agencies, all of which receive federal funds,\n97\ndenied assistance to some persons on account of their disabilities 00 and the DCFS argued that the Rehabilitation\n97\nAct does not require it (or, indeed, any other agency of Illinois) to render special services to criminals.\nWithout addressing the agency's argument that federal law permits it to desist from providing services to\ndelinquents over the age of 13, the district court denied the DCFS's motion to modify the decree. 950 F.Supp.\n841 (1996). The district judge understood Rufo to permit modification of a consent decree only when \"the\nsubstantive law ... has so clearly and dramatically changed as to render continued enforcement of the Consent\nDecree inequitable.\" 950 F.Supp. at 846. Federal law has not changed since 1981 in a sufficiently dramatic\nfashion to permit modification of the decree, the judge wrote. Id. at 846-51. As for Evans, which concluded that to\nprevent a state or local government from exercising its normal legislative powers, \"there [must be] a substantial\nfederal claim, not only when the decree is entered but also when it is enforced, [so] that the obligations imposed\nby the decree rest on this rule of federal law rather than the bare consent of the [former] officeholder\" (10 F.3d at\n479), the district judge concluded that Evans need not be followed. 950 F.Supp. at 845-46. The passage just\n\nquoted appears in the lead opinion, to which only five of the eleven participating judges subscribed. Judge\n1148 Ripple, who cast the sixth vote supporting the judgment in Evans, did not approve (or disapprove) this *1148 part\nof the plurality opinion, see 10 F.3d at 483, and the district judge concluded that as a result Evans does not\nrepresent the law.\nThere is substantial doubt that the decree complies with either Article III or the Eleventh Amendment to the\nConstitution. The fifth paragraph in the decree's preamble recites that \"[t]he defendants have, unrelated to the\ncourse of this litigation, established a program to provide services to plaintiffs, which, plaintiffs have agreed,\nmeets their needs.\" This implies that, at the time the decree was entered, the parties were not adverse, and that\nthe district court therefore lacked the case or controversy essential to federal jurisdiction. When a suit sets in\nmotion a change of policy, a prospective judgment may be apt under the approach of Chicago Teachers Union v.\nHudson, 475 U.S. 292, 305 n. 14, 106 S.Ct. 1066, 1075 n. 14, 89 L.Ed.2d 232 (1986), and United States v. W.T.\nGrant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 632, 73 S.Ct. 894, 897, 97 L.Ed. 1303 (1953): the decree prevents the defendants from\nreverting to their old ways as soon as the case ends. But a new policy unrelated to the litigation implies that the\nsuit was unnecessary, and that the controversy is moot. What is more, because all three defendants are state\nofficers, even a conclusion that the suit played some role in instigating a change of policy may not justify relief. Ex\nparte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908), permits a court to enter an injunction against state\nofficials, but the court must use the minimum coercive force essential to achieve compliance with federal law. If\nthe state brings itself into conformity with national law, then the court should terminate the litigation, for at that\npoint the legal fiction of Young 00 that the state officers are acting outside the scope of their authority, therefore\n97\nare not the alter egos of the state, and therefore may be enjoined without violating the Eleventh Amendment 00 no\n97\nlonger applies. See Green v. Mansour, 474 U.S. 64, 106 S.Ct. 423, 88 L.Ed.2d 371 (1985); Mercer v. Magnant,\n40 F.3d 893 (7th Cir.1994).\nIf the decree is consistent with Article III and the Eleventh Amendment, then the district court must grant the\nDCFS the relief it requests 00 if only because the decree has never had the effect the district court attributed to it.\n97\nThe DCFS asked the district court for relief because judges of the Circuit Court of Cook County recently directed\nthe DCFS to take custody of some children, over 13 years of age, who had been adjudicated delinquent. These\njudges thought that the consent decree overrides 20 ILCS 505/5(l). Yet although the decree requires the three\nagencies to provide services to the defined class of children, it does not say which agency will provide which\nservices. Indeed, it does not require the provision of any particular service to any child. Instead it provides that\nwhen the Juvenile Court of Cook County refers a youngster to the GYSI, there must be a meeting including\nrepresentatives of the three agencies within nine working days, following which \"[i]nterim and long term service\nrecommendations will be formulated; a comprehensive service plan is then developed.\" The GYSI's \"Coordinator\nwill be responsible for fully implementing [the plan's] goals and objectives.\" That's it. There are no details about\nwhich agency does which things, or what a plan must contain. Perhaps the whole decree is ineffectual for lack of\nspecificity under Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(d), which provides that an injunction \"shall describe in reasonable detail ... the\nact or acts sought to be restrained\". See also Schmidt v. Lessard, 414 U.S. 473, 94 S.Ct. 713, 38 L.Ed.2d 661\n(1974). But whatever the decree may do, it does not explicitly direct the DCFS to provide services to persons\nover the age of 13 who have been adjudicated delinquent. It says that the State of Illinois must provide some\nassistance under a \"comprehensive service plan\" (whatever that may be), but when services of any kind are\nappropriate, what services those may be, how they are to be rendered, and by which agency, are things Illinois\nmay work out for itself. Whatever ambiguity lurks in this decree 00 and there must be some, for why else did the\n97\nstate judges direct the DCFS to disregard 20 ILCS 505/5(l) on the decree's authority? 00 could and should have\n97\nbeen dispelled by the district court.\nLet us suppose, however, that we have not read between the lines correctly, and that the decree imposes on the\n1149 DCFS an obligation to take custody of some persons over the age of *1149 13 who have been adjudicated\ndelinquent. Then the decree should be modified to eliminate the conflict between its requirements and the new\nstate statute. The district court believed that modification is proper only when \"the substantive law ... has so\nclearly and dramatically changed as to render continued enforcement of the Consent Decree inequitable.\" 950\nF.Supp. at 846. Moreover, the court thought, only a change in federal substantive law matters. That is not what \nRufo holds; indeed, the district court's approach is redolent of the losing side's contentions in Rufo. According to\nthe Supreme Court, \"a party seeking modification of a consent decree bears the burden of establishing that a\nsignificant change in circumstances warrants revision of the decree. If the moving party meets this standard, the\n\ncourt should consider whether the proposed modification is suitably tailored to the changed circumstance.\" 502\nU.S. at 383, 112 S.Ct. at 759 (footnote omitted). The Court did not distinguish between legal and factual\ncircumstances, or between state and federal law; change in any of these things may justify modification under\nFed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(5).\nThe Rehabilitation Act was reworded in 1990 when Congress enacted the Americans With Disabilities Act, but the\namendment does not change anything substantive. The statute now reads: \"No otherwise qualified individual with\na disability ... shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the\nbenefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.\"\n29 U.S.C. § 794(a). The qualifier \"solely by reason of her or his disability\" makes it essential to determine the\nground on which exclusion from a program is based. That directs attention to the 1995 change in Illinois law:\ncertain youths now are excluded from certain services provided by the DCFS, not by reason of disability (as\nmight have been true before 1981) but by reason of criminal conviction. Such a change is \"significant\" in Rufo's\nterminology, and modification of the decree so that the DCFS may conform its activities to both state and federal\nlaw would be \"suitably tailored to the changed circumstance.\"\nPlaintiffs do not contend that the crimes of those class members who have been adjudicated delinquent can be\nattributed to their disabilities. Cf. Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 108 S.Ct. 592, 98 L.Ed.2d 686 (1988). For\nexample, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which some class members display, may cause difficulties in\nlearning and social interactions, but it does not \"cause\" murder or sexual assault 00 not in the legal sense,\n97\nanyway, even if those with the disorder are statistically more likely to commit crimes. See Despears v. Milwaukee\nCounty, 63 F.3d 635 (7th Cir.1995); cf. Doe v. Board of Education of Oak Park, 115 F.3d 1273, 1279-81 (7th\nCir.1997). Nothing in the Rehabilitation Act requires states to disregard a person's criminal activity when deciding\nwhat social-welfare services to provide, and through which agency 00 even if a particular condition of eligibility\n97\nhappens to bear more heavily on those who have disabilities. See Bryant v. Madigan, 84 F.3d 246 (7th Cir. 1996);\ncf. Traynor v. Turnage, 485 U.S. 535, 108 S.Ct. 1372, 99 L.Ed.2d 618 (1988); Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287,\n105 S.Ct. 712, 83 L.Ed.2d 661 (1985); Vaughn v. Sullivan, 83 F.3d 907, 912-13 (7th Cir.1996). Plaintiffs do not\ndisagree with this view of the Rehabilitation Act so much as they disagree with the DCFS's reading of its options\nunder state law. Response requires nothing more than a citation to Pennhurst State School & Hospital v.\nHalderman, 465 U.S. 89, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984): given the Eleventh Amendment, a federal court\nmay not use disagreement with a state official's understanding of state law as the basis of relief.\nSome of the district court's analysis implies that a state is stuck with its bargain if plaintiffs never had much of a\ncase to begin with. If this class could not have prevailed on the merits in 1981, then adjustments in state and\nfederal law that weaken its claims cannot be a \"significant\" change in the law. On this approach, the weaker the\nclaim under federal law, the more enduring the rights under a consent decree. A state will be bound forever\nbecause it cannot demonstrate that the law has changed in its favor. Evans cuts off arguments of this kind by\n1150 making a *1150 substantial federal claim essential to both entry and enforcement of a consent decree. Although,\nas the district judge observed, the critical language appears in an opinion joined by only five of the eleven\nmembers of the en banc court, the judge erred in supposing that if Evans does not by itself establish the point,\nthen the proposition is not the law. Disagreement within the court in Evans had more to do with application of the\nprinciples to the problem at hand than with the identification of the rules that govern the entry, modification, and\ndissolution of consent decrees. See 10 F.3d at 485 (Flaum & Kanne, JJ., dissenting, because they believed that a\ncolorable constitutional theory supported the decree when entered and at the time of the decision en banc).\nThe plurality in Evans did not draw its legal analysis from thin air. The opinion discusses decisions of the\nSupreme Court, of this court, and of other circuits, as well as some powerful considerations of political legitimacy\n00 such as the fact that in a democracy the people may vote out politicians whose acts displease them, and elect\n97\nnew representatives who promise change. See 10 F.3d at 477-80. The Rehabilitation Act does not authorize\npoliticians who hold office in one year to prevent their successors from charting a different course. See Michael\nW. McConnell, Why Hold Elections? Using Consent Decrees to Insulate Policies from Political Change, 1987 U.\nChi. Legal Forum 295. Cases predating Evans accordingly hold that it takes more than the consent of public\nofficials to support a federal court's entry and enforcement of an injunction; it takes a substantial claim based on\nfederal law. Alliance to End Repression v. Chicago, 742 F.2d 1007 (7th Cir.1984) (en banc); People Who Care v.\nRockford Board of Education, 961 F.2d 1335 (7th Cir.1992); Kasper v. Board of Election Commissioners, 814\n\nF.2d 332, 340 (7th Cir.1987); White v. Roughton, 689 F.2d 118 (7th Cir.1982). See also Larry Kramer, Consent\nDecrees and the Rights of Third Parties, 87 Mich. L.Rev. 321 (1988). The message has been reiterated in this\ncircuit since Evans. E.g., Komyatti v. Bayh, 96 F.3d 955, 962-63 (7th Cir. 1996). As Komyatti observed, the\nsubstantial-claim requirement does not permit a party to disregard the decree, but it does justify modification or\nvacatur. See also Sweeton v. Brown, 27 F.3d 1162 (6th Cir.1994) (en banc). The district court should have\nimplemented, rather than disdained, this element of the plurality opinion in Evans.\nTo sum up: on remand the district court must first determine whether a case or controversy existed when the\ndecree was entered. If yes, then the court has two additional responsibilities. It must either construe or modify the\ndecree forthwith to permit Illinois to reallocate tasks among its agencies and to reduce the services offered to\npersons adjudicated delinquent. Then it must determine whether a substantial federal claim supports the decree\nas a whole; if not, the entire decree must be lifted and the task of shaping public policy be restored to persons\ntoday holding political office 00 subject only to whatever limitations federal law and the Supremacy Clause now\n97\nplace on the operation of the state's social-welfare system. See B.H. v. McDonald, 49 F.3d 294, 301-03 (7th\nCir.1995). Plaintiffs would be free at this stage to argue, for example, that the way in which the DCFS proposes to\nconduct itself would violate the Americans With Disabilities Act, which supplements the Rehabilitation Act. But\narguments based on the ADA are new claims, which must be made and proved; they do not breathe life into a\ndecree entered under a different legal regime. Relief under a statute enacted in 1990 cannot be justified on the\nbasis of the agencies' consent in 1981. Cf. Daniels v. Pipe Fitters Ass'n, 113 F.3d 685, 687 (7th Cir. 1997). The\njudgment is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n[*] Judge Rovner took no part in the decision for rehearing en banc.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

App.3d 787 (1980)\n408 N.E.2d 275\nDAVID B. et al., Plaintiffs-Appellees,\nv.\nROBERT DeVITO, Director, Illinois Department of Mental Health and Developmental\nDisabilities et al., Defendants-Appellants.\nNo. 79-975.\nIllinois Appellate Court 00 First District (5th Division).\n97\nOpinion filed July 11, 1980.\n788 *788 William J. Scott, Attorney General, of Chicago (Alan E. Grischke and Richard L. Ryan, Assistant Attorneys\nGeneral, of counsel), for appellants.\nPatrick T. Murphy, of Chicago, for appellees.\nDismissed in part and reversed in part.\nMr. PRESIDING JUSTICE SULLIVAN delivered the opinion of the court:\nDefendants Robert DeVito (Director, Illinois Department of Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities (DMH))\nand Gregory Coler (Director, Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS)) appeal the grant of summary\njudgment requiring the said agencies to coordinate their efforts to provide individualized treatment for members of\nthe plaintiff class. On appeal, defendants contend that (1) it was error to permit the suit to proceed as a class\naction; (2) summary judgment should not have been granted; (3) the agencies were improperly required to render\nservices not mandated by the relevant statutes; and (4) it was error to deny defendants' motion for a change of\nvenue.\nAlthough the record is unclear in some respects, it appears that 16-year-old David B., one of the two named\nplaintiffs, was originally a patient in the Tinley Park Mental Health Center, a facility of DMH. After he was\nreleased, he allegedly stole a weapon from his father's house and then set the house on fire, following which a\ndelinquency petition was filed in juvenile court charging him with theft and arson. While awaiting trial, David was\ndetained for a time in the Audy Home and then transferred to DMH for hospital care. It was subsequently\n789 determined by *789 DMH that David was no longer in need of hospitalization and thus was not entitled to receive\ncare from DMH. Before being released, David was referred to a \"court coordinator\" who sought services in\nDavid's behalf from DCFS; however, that agency refused to accept David because of his emotional problems.\nSimilarly, 14-year-old Daniel C., the other named plaintiff, was originally a patient at DMH's Chicago Read\nHospital. While on unauthorized leave, he allegedly threatened a police officer with an unloaded shotgun and was\ncharged with assault in a delinquency petition. While awaiting trial, he was again hospitalized at Chicago Read,\nand once more it was determined that he was neither in need of hospitalization nor entitled to services from\nDMH. A request of Daniel's probation officer for placement services from DCFS was denied on the basis that he\nwas emotionally disturbed. Thus, it appears that David and Daniel were both patients at DMH hospitals and were\nabout to be released because DMH felt they were no longer in need of hospitalization; that DCFS would accept\nneither of them, on the grounds that they were too emotionally disturbed to be handled by that agency; and that\nthe only place they could be sent was the Audy Home 00 which is operated by the Department of Corrections.\n97\nIn August of 1978, apparently while both boys were still in the care of DMH, the instant suit was filed. The\nsubsequent amended complaint listed David and Daniel as plaintiffs, by their next friend Patrick T. Murphy, \"[o]n\nbehalf of themselves and a class of persons similarly situated but too numerous and transitory to mention.\" The\ncomplaint essentially alleged the facts set forth above and asserted that both agencies were under a statutory\nduty to provide services to plaintiffs. In the prayer for relief, plaintiffs requested an order declaring that plaintiffs\nand the members of the class \"are entitled to benefits from DCFS and/or DMHDD once their problems have been\n\nidentified and diagnosed as * * * having to do with a mental disorder and who may intentionally or unintentionally\nphysically harm themselves or others and who are unable to care for themselves so as to guard themselves from\nphysical injury or to provide for their physical needs.\" The complaint alluded to the class twice, stating:\n\"The children in the class whom the two named Plaintiffs represent are those who are in need of\nmental treatment because they are afflicted with a mental disorder and who from time to time may\nunintentionally physically harm themselves or others and who are unable to care for themselves\nso as to guard themselves from physical injury or to provide for their own physical needs\";\nand stating also that:\n\"These children either are compelled to remain at the Audy Home or placed in mental health\n790 facilities and although they need *790 placement which only the Department of Children and\nFamily Services can provide and there are no proceedures [sic] wherein the Department in\nkeeping with due process guidelines will accept such youngsters for placement. The result in the\npast has been that frequently children who should not be committed to the Department of\nCorrections, Juvenile Division are so committed by Juvenile Court Judges, after findings of\ndelinquency, because there simply is no alternative placement.\"\nAfter both defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings, plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction which\nwas subsequently withdrawn after an agreement was apparently reached whereby DMH would attempt to obtain\nplacement for Daniel and DCFS would attempt to place David. Plaintiffs then filed a \"motion for rule to show\ncause and for summary judgment,\" wherein they alleged essentially that the agencies had not honored that\nagreement. Thereafter, the trial court entered an order and memorandum opinion finding that the requisites for\nmaintaining a class action as set forth in section 57.2 of the Civil Practice Act (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1977, ch. 110, par.\n57.2) were satisfied; that DMH has \"a statutory duty to provide further care as needed by these named plaintiffs\nand other members of the class who are under the jurisdiction of the Juvenile Division of the Circuit court, and to\nassist Cook County Juvenile authorities and DCFS in planning for and making available such services\"; that\nDCFS is likewise statutorily mandated to provide services to \"those persons whose claims are being pressed in\nthis action\"; and that \"[t]he practicalities of properly caring for this class of juveniles further support the Court's\nconclusion that the General Assembly intended the responsibility to be joint.\" The order which granted plaintiffs'\nmotion for summary judgment and denied defendants' motions for judgment on the pleadings, stated also:\n\"[T]hat the plaintiffs, individually and as a class, are entitled to receive appropriate services from\nboth DMH and DCFS. The exact nature of these services must be determined on an individual\nbasis. It is further ordered that the defendants, DMH and DCFS shall coordinate their efforts in\norder to prepare an individualized treatment plan which shall provide, inter alia, for counseling and\ntreatment of emotional problems, appropriate residential placement and other services.\"\nImmediately after judgment was entered, defendants moved to stay the order pending appeal. A hearing was held\non the motion at which plaintiffs' counsel stated he would call two witnesses \"to present evidence about the\nnumber of people involved at the present and the immediacy of harm to anyone as well as plaintiffs in general.\"\n791 He then called Mary Donahue-Patoff, a juvenile court probation officer to whom Daniel was *791 referred for\nsocial investigation in 1977, who testified that the hospitalization history of Daniel was as set forth above; that in\nDecember of 1978, Chicago Read notified her that Daniel was no longer in need of hospitalization; that DCFS\nrefused replacement assistance; and that because DMH has indicated Daniel should not return home to live, he\nremains at Chicago Read. Irene Nelson, also a juvenile court probation officer, testified that children are referred\nto her by probation officers, guardians ad litem, the state's attorney's office, the public defender's office, and other\nagencies; that it is her responsibility to assure that these children receive needed mental health services; that\nfrom January of 1978 through May of 1979, 110 children were referred to her; that 86 of the 110 children sought\nresidential placement, but only two were actually so placed; and that the remaining 84 children were either\nreleased from hospitals, returned to their homes, placed in interim placements, or sent to foster homes.\nDMH then called Patricia Barger, a DMH psychologist and director, who testified that she is responsible for\noverseeing the functions of the office and its professional staff; and that, in her opinion, DMH could not practically\nimplement the trial court's order at that time. On the next day of the hearing, the trial court informed the attorneys\n\nthat it had received a telephone call from someone in the Governor's office who wished to arrange a meeting with\ndefendants DeVito and Coler, the Department of Corrections director, and the presiding judge of the juvenile\ncourt to discuss a possible solution of the problem presented in the case. Subsequently, defendant's motion to\nstay was denied, and this appeal followed.\nAt the oral arguments in this court, it was represented that, after this matter was concluded in the trial court, a\nmeeting such as that proposed by the Governor's office was held and a \"Governor's Review\" committee was\nestablished by DMH and DCFS jointly for the purpose of placing children who were previously regarded as being\nnot sufficiently emotionally disturbed to be accepted by DMH but too disturbed to be handled by DCFS; and that\npursuant to this \"Governor's Review,\" placement had in fact been made for the named plaintiffs herein. In\naddition, plaintiff's counsel expressed satisfaction with the voluntary establishment and operations of the review\ncommittee as well as the placement of the named plaintiffs.\nOPINION\nDefendants first contend that the trial court erred in allowing the instant suit to proceed to judgment as a class\naction. The maintenance of class actions is governed by section 57.2 of the Civil Practice Act (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1977,\nch. 110, par. 57.2), which provides:\n792 *792 \"(a) An action may be maintained as a class action in any court of this State and a party may\nsue or be sued as a representative party of the class only if the court finds:\n(1) The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.\n(2) There are questions of fact or law common to the class, which common questions predominate\nover any questions affecting only individual members.\n(3) The representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interest of the class.\n(4) The class action is an appropriate method for the fair and efficient adjudication of the\ncontroversy.\"\nFurther, section 57.3(a) provides:\n\"(a) Determination of Class. As soon as practicable after the commencement of an action brought\nas a class action, the court shall determine by order whether it may be so maintained and\ndescribe those whom the court finds to be members of the class. This order may be conditional\nand may be amended before a decision on the merits.\" (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1977, ch. 110, par. 57.3(a).)\nWe note further that \"the proponent of the class action has the burden of establishing these prerequisites and the\ncourt must find them present before it can sanction the maintenance of the action as a class action.\" (McCabe v.\nBurgess (1979), 75 Ill.2d 457, 464, 389 N.E.2d 565, 567,cert. denied(1979), 444 U.S. 916, 62 L.Ed.2d 170, 100\nS.Ct. 230.) Also, we are mindful that a trial court's determination as to the propriety of a class action may be\nreversed only if it is found that the trial court abused its discretion. McCabe v. Burgess.\n00 1 In the case at bar, the trial court described the class in its memorandum opinion as follows:\n95\n\"The class whose rights the representatives herein seek to assert is composed of those minors\nwho are under the jurisdiction of the Court and who require some type of residential placement\nsuch as that which DCFS is empowered to provide, and some type of psychiatric or psychological\ntreatment such as that which DMH is empowered to provide, but who are not accepted for such\nplacement or treatment by the state agencies involved.\"\nDefendants argue that the trial court's certification of the class was improper in that there was no evidence\nindicating that the class was so numerous as to render joinder impracticable, as required by section 57.2(a)(1).\nWe agree. There is no allegation in the complaint as to the number of individuals who would fall within the class\nas described by the court, and there was no evidence adduced prior to the entry of the judgment order which\n\n793 indicated the size of the class. Plaintiffs assert that a *793 class of at least 84 children was established by the\ntestimony of Irene Nelson that from January of 1978 through May of 1979, 110 children were referred to her for\nplacement; that 86 of the 110 children sought residential placement, with only two actually placed; and that the\nremaining 84 were either released from hospitals, returned home, placed in interim placements, or sent to foster\nhomes. It is our view, however, that this testimony is not supportive for several reasons. First, we note that\nNelson testified after the entry of the judgment order; therefore, the testimony could not have served as a basis\nfor the certification of the class. Second, Nelson did not testify that these 84 children \"required some type of\npsychiatric or psychological treatment such as that which DMH is empowered to provide,\" as did the class\ndescribed by the trial court in its order. Third, there was no testimony indicating that the plight of any of these 84\nchildren was due to inaction by DMH and DCFS, which was the essence of plaintiff's complaint. In light thereof,\nwe find no basis in the record upon which the trial court properly could have determined that the class was so\nnumerous as to render joinder impracticable or even that a class of persons as described in the order existed.\nWe conclude that the determination of a class finds no support in the record.\n00 2, 3 Since this conclusion does not in itself nullify the judgment order as it pertains to the named\n95\nrepresentatives of the class (see Ditland Plumbing, Inc. v. Milwaukee Electric Tool Corp. (1977), 55 Ill. App.3d\n332, 371 N.E.2d 15), we would ordinarily be required to consider the merits of defendants' remaining allegations\nof error and determine whether they affect the judgment in favor of the representatives. However, we need not do\nso here inasmuch as it appears that the controversy concerning the placement of the named representatives, if\nnot the entire class (assuming, of course, that it exists), is now moot. This is apparent from the representations of\nthe parties at oral argument that DMH and DCFS voluntarily participated in a \"Governor's Review\" committee\nestablished for the purpose of securing placement for children whom neither of those agencies previously would\naccept, and that the named plaintiffs were in fact placed by this committee. It was also represented to us that, in\nthe future, children who were previously regarded as too emotionally disturbed to be accepted by DCFS and not\nsufficiently disturbed to warrant hospitalization under DMH would be given individual consideration by the said\ncommittee and that it would attempt to obtain placement for them. It was plaintiffs' position on oral argument that\nthis matter is now moot and, in view of the action of the \"Governor's Review\" committee, we agree that there is\nno longer an actual controversy as to the interests or rights of the parties and that this case is therefore moot. (\nChicago City Bank & Trust Co. v. Board of Education (1944), 386 Ill. 508, 54 N.E.2d 498; Harney v. Cahill (1965),\n794 57 Ill. App.2d 1, *794 206 N.E.2d 500.) Accordingly, the portion of the appeal regarding the named\nrepresentatives is dismissed. City Bank & Trust Co. v. Board of Education; National Jockey Club v. Illinois Racing\nCom. (1936), 364 Ill. 630, 5 N.E.2d 224.\nFor the reasons stated above, that portion of the judgment order allowing this suit to stand as a class action is\nreversed, and the appeal from the order insofar as it grants relief by summary judgment to the named\nrepresentatives is dismissed.\nReversed in part.\nDismissed in part.\nLORENZ and WILSON, JJ., concur.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Christine B., Germaine M., Through their Guardian Ad Litem, Patrick T. \nMurphy, on behalf of themselves and a class of individuals too numerous and transitory to mention, Plaintiffs, \nv. \nJess McDONALD, Director of the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, et al., Defendants. \nNo. 79 C 1662. | March 12, 1998. \nOpinion \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER \nASPEN, J. \n*1 Presently before us is the plaintiffs’ Rule 59(e) motion for reconsideration of this court’s order dated December 2, 1997. \nThat order vacated a consent decree that had bound the parties since October 2, 1981. In light of developments since the entry \nof our order, we believe that reconsideration is warranted. \n  \n \nI. Eleventh Amendment \nAs discussed in our earlier opinion, the Eleventh Amendment bars the plaintiffs’ claims unless they qualify for the narrow \nexception carved out by Ex Parte Young, which permits suits that seek only prospective injunctive relief to prevent a state \nfrom continuing to violate federal law. Young has its limits, however. If a state brings itself into conformity with federal law, \na federal court may not continue to intrude into the operations of state government. See David B. v. McDonald, 116 F.3d \n1146, 1148 (7th Cir.1997). This deferential approach is mandated not only by the Eleventh Amendment, but by the very \nstructure of our federal system, under which state sovereignty cannot lightly be disregarded. Accordingly, states are entitled \nto the benefit of the doubt: when a state provides a federal court with good reason to believe that it will desist from conduct \nthat violates federal law, it should be given the chance to do so free from interference by federal courts. \n  \nOn October 10, 1986, Illinois gave us good reason to believe that it would provide the plaintiffs with the services to which \nthey claimed they were entitled under federal law by passing a statute that permitted the relevant state agencies to provide \nthose services. See 20 ILCS 505/17a–11. The plaintiffs are undoubtedly correct when they observe that this statute does not \nabsolutely guarantee that the services will be provided: it is merely an enabling statute, and it indicates that provision of the \nservices is contingent on the availability of funds. See id.1 But as the plaintiffs also acknowledge, an absolute guarantee is \npractically impossible since state legislators and directors of state agencies have little power to bind their successors, and \nevery legislatively authorized endeavor is (at least implicitly) contingent on the availability of funds. See Pls.’ Br. at 5–6. \nGiven this reality, the passage of 20 ILCS 505/17a–11 was the clearest possible indication that Illinois intended to provide \nservices to the plaintiffs in the future. Thus, as we held in our earlier opinion, as of October 10, 1986, Illinois was entitled to \nthe benefit of the doubt that it would thereafter provide those services, and the consent decree should have been lifted on that \ndate. \n  \nAlmost as soon as our opinion to this effect was issued, however, DCFS made it quite clear that Illinois did not deserve or \ndesire the benefit of the doubt. Rather, DCFS forthrightly indicated that it has no intention of continuing to provide the \nservices formerly required by the consent decree. See Defs.’ Resp. Br. Ex. A (letter dated December 19, 1997, from Cheryl \nCesario, DCFS’ General Counsel, indicating that in light of our order GYSI would not accept any future referrals, though the \nparticipating state agencies would continue to provide funding for adolescents already placed by GYSI). DCFS insists that \nfederal law does not require it to provide those services, see id. at 4–7, and that the consent decree was the only reason it ever \ndid so, see id. at 2. \n  1 \n \n\nDavid B. v. McDonald, Not Reported in F.Supp. (1998)   \n \n  \n*2 With this development, the rationale for vacating the consent decree articulated in our earlier opinion has disappeared. A \ndeferential posture is inappropriate when a state has expressed its intent to engage in conduct that may conflict with federal \nlaw. Hence, we will withdraw our earlier order vacating the consent decree, and turn to the question of whether DCFS’ \nrefusal to provide services to the plaintiffs deprives them of their rights under federal law. \n  \n \nII. Substantial Federal Question \nAs  indicated  in  its  preamble,  the  original  Consent  Decree  between  the  parties  rested  on  two  kinds  of  claims:  (1) \nRehabilitation Act claims under 29 U.S.C. § 794, and (2) constitutional claims presented via 42 U.S.C. § 1983.2 The Court of \nAppeals has asked us to determine if either of these claims remain “substantial” enough—in light of developments in the law \nsince 1981—to justify the continued existence of the Decree. See David B., 116 F.3d at 1150. To determine if a substantial \nclaim remains, we must decide whether “the statutory or decisional law has changed to make legal what the decree was \ndesigned to prevent.” Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 388, 112 S.Ct. 748, 116 L.Ed.2d 867 (1992). The \nDecree was designed to prevent the defendants from denying appropriate services to the plaintiffs “because of” their \nhandicaps. Decree at 2, 4–5. \n  \n \nA. Rehabilitation Act \nTo understand the nature of the plaintiffs’ claims under the Rehabilitation Act it is first necessary to understand their \ndistinctive characteristics. The plaintiff class consists of: \nAll children residing or found in Cook County, Illinois who: \nA. Are seventeen years of age or less, or, if the person is a ward of the Juvenile Court, twenty years of age or less; and \nB. Are referred to Juvenile Court; and \nC. Are alleged to have engaged in conduct or whose parents are alleged to have engaged in conduct in violation of the \nIllinois Juvenile Court Act; and \nD. Are in need of specialized services including but not limited to child welfare, mental health and education; and \nE. Have been denied appropriate services by one or more of the defendants, their agents and employees, after having made \nthe necessary applications for such services. \nConsent Decree at 4. Thus, in simplest terms, the class consists of mentally or emotionally disabled children who have (at \nleast allegedly) engaged in delinquent behavior. Their claim is that the defendant agencies discriminated against them \n“because of their disablement in direct violation of 29 U.S.C. § 794.” Second Am. Compl. ¶ 32. That provision states that \n“[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability ... shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal \nfinancial assistance....” 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n  \nIn 1980, the defendants moved to dismiss the Rehabilitation Act claims on several different theories, one of which was that \nthe plaintiffs were not excluded from services “because of” their disabilities but rather because of their delinquent behavior. \nNeither the Second Amended Complaint nor the Consent Decree asserts that the plaintiffs’ delinquent behavior is “caused” \nby their disabilities. Judge Crowley rejected the defendants’ argument with little discussion, stating: “[The plaintiffs] claim \nthat they are deprived [of] existing services and that, whereas those services are provided for persons with similar mental or \nemotional disabilities, they are not provided to the plaintiffs. The Act outlaws this type of selective enforcement.” David B. v. \nDeVito, No. 79 C 1662 (N.D.Ill., Sept. 4, 1980) (unpublished order granting in part and denying in part defendants’ motion to \ndismiss). Thus, Judge Crowley believed that the plaintiffs had stated a claim merely by asserting that they were disabled and \nhad been denied services; he did not consider whether the denial was “solely” by reason of disability. \n  \n  2 \n \n\nDavid B. v. McDonald, Not Reported in F.Supp. (1998)   \n \n*3 This issue resurfaced in 1996, when the Illinois legislature directed the defendants to cease taking custody of children over \nthe age of the 13 who had been adjudicated delinquent. See 20 ILCS 505/5(/). In order to permit compliance with this new \nstate law, the defendants requested that this court either modify the Consent Decree or vacate it entirely. As part of this \nrequest, the defendants suggested that the plaintiffs had no substantial claim under the Rehabilitation Act because they were \nnot deprived of services “solely by reason” of their disability. See Def.s’ Br. at 16–19. They directed our attention to a \nnumber of opinions issued since 1980 emphasizing that to establish a violation of the Rehabilitation Act plaintiffs must show \nthat their disabilities are the “sole” cause of their inability to obtain services. See, e.g ., Traynor v. Turnage, 485 U.S. 535, \n549–50, 108 S.Ct. 1372, 99 L.Ed.2d 618 (1988); Maddox v. University of Tennessee, 62 F.3d 843, 846–47 (6th Cir.1995); \nJohnson v. Thompson, 971 F.2d 1487, 1493 (10th Cir.1992). We addressed this issue in our opinion, but did not offer a \ndefinitive opinion on it. Instead we ruled that although it was “far from conclusive” whether the plaintiffs were discriminated \nagainst “solely” by reason of their disability, the uncertainty was enough to justify the continuing operation of the Consent \nDecree because it implied that the plaintiffs’ claim was substantial, even if it was not meritorious. David B., 950 F.Supp. 841, \n848 (N.D.Ill.1996). \n  \nOn appeal, the Seventh Circuit resolved the causation question. It emphasized that the language of the Rehabilitation Act \nprohibits the denial of services to a disabled person only if the denial is “ ‘solely’ “ by reason of his or her disability. See \nDavid B., 116 F.3d at 1149 (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 794(a)). The court then reasoned: \n[C]ertain youths now are excluded from certain services provided by the DCFS, not by reason of disability (as might have \nbeen true before 1981) but by reason of criminal conviction.... \nPlaintiffs do not contend that the crimes of those class members who have been adjudicated delinquent can be attributed to \ntheir disabilities. For example, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which some class members display, may cause \ndifficulties in learning and social interactions, but it does not “cause” murder or sexual assault—not in the legal sense, \nanyway, even if those with the disorder are statistically more likely to commit crimes. Nothing in the Rehabilitation Act \nrequires states to disregard a person’s criminal activity when deciding what social welfare services to provide, and through \nwhich agency—even if a particular condition of eligibility happens to bear more heavily on those who have disabilities. \nId. (citations omitted). It follows that children whose delinquency is the reason (or one of several reasons) that they were \ndenied services have no substantial claim under the Rehabilitation Act—they were not denied services “solely” because of \ntheir disabilities.3 \n  \n*4 Although the Seventh Circuit’s opinion considered the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act only with respect to a \nparticular sub-group of the plaintiff class, namely children over the age of 13 who have been adjudicated delinquent, see \nDavid B., 116 F.3d at 1146, 1148–49, the reasoning is applicable to the class as a whole. If the state chooses to deny services \nto a child because of his or her delinquent behavior—even if such behavior is only alleged rather than proven—then the \ndenial cannot be said to have occurred “solely” by reason of his or her disabilities, and therefore does not violate the \nRehabilitation Act.4 \n  \n \nB. Substantive Due Process \nThe plaintiffs’ second claim is based on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.5 The plaintiffs argue that \nIllinois violated this provision by assuming a special relationship with them and then denying them adequate care. See \nSecond Am. Compl. ¶ 34; Pl.’s Mem. in Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. to Vacate or Modify at 45. This theory derives from language \nin DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 109 S.Ct. 998, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (1989), which \nprovides: \n  \n[W]hen the State takes a person into its custody and holds him there against his will, the Constitution imposes upon it a \ncorresponding duty to assume some responsibility for his safety and general well-being. The rationale for this principle is \nsimple enough: when the State by the affirmative exercise of its power so restrains an individual’s liberty that it renders \nhim unable to care for himself, and at the same time fails to provide for his basic human needs—e.g., food, clothing, \nshelter, medical care, and reasonable safety—it transgresses the substantive limits on state action set by the Eighth \nAmendment and the Due Process Clause. The affirmative duty to protect arises not from the State’s knowledge of the \nindividual’s predicament or from its expressions of intent to help him, but from the limitation which it has imposed on his \n  3 \n \n\nDavid B. v. McDonald, Not Reported in F.Supp. (1998)   \n \nfreedom to act on his own behalf. In the substantive due process analysis, it is the State’s affirmative act of restraining the \nindividual’s freedom to act on his own behalf—through incarceration, institutionalization, or other similar restraint of \npersonal liberty—which is the “deprivation of liberty” triggering the protections of the Due Process Clause, not its failure \nto act to protect his liberty interests against harms inflicted by other means. \nId. at 199–200 (citations omitted). Absent some initial “deprivation of liberty,” however, the general rule is that the “ \n‘State is under no constitutional duty to provide substantive services for those within its border.’ “ Id. at 196 (quoting \nYoungberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 317, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982)). \nThus, the threshold question is whether the plaintiffs in this case suffered a deprivation of liberty sufficient to impose \naffirmative duties on the defendant state agencies. The plaintiffs point out that Illinois has affirmatively acted to restrain their \nliberty by declaring them to be wards of the Juvenile Court, see Consent Decree at 4,6 a status which renders them “subject to \nthe dispositional powers of the court,” 705 ILCS 405/1–3(16). When a delinquent minor becomes a ward of the court, the \ncourt assumes enormous control over his or her life: to pick a few examples, the court may appoint a new guardian or \ncustodian, order the minor committed to the Department of Corrections or DCFS (depending on his or her age), declare the \nminor to be emancipated, or place the minor on probation. See 705 ILCS 405/5–23. In a sense, the court becomes a \n“super-guardian” with the power to select (and, when necessary, to change) the minor’s actual guardians and custodians, and \nonce the court assumes this power it may retain it until the child attains the age of 19 years, see 705 ILCS 405/5–34; In re \nW.C., 167 Ill.2d 307, 212 Ill.Dec. 563, 657 N.E.2d 908, 918 (Ill.1995).7 \n  \n*5 We believe that the dispositional power exercised by the Juvenile Court over its wards is sufficient to entitle those wards \nto the protections of the Due Process Clause. Even citizens who are not literally in the “custody” of the state may \nnevertheless have a right to Due Process Clause protection if they are in a “special relationship” with the state such as \nguardian-ward. See Stevens v.. Umsted, 131 F.3d 697, 702–04 (7th Cir.1997); Camp v. Gregory, 67 F.3d 1286, 1292 (7th \nCir.1995). In Camp, the court considered a substantive due process claim against DCFS, which the Juvenile Court had \nappointed as guardian of 16–year–old Anthony Young. DCFS declined to remove Anthony from the custody of his \ngrandmother even after she informed DCFS that she was unable to provide the boy with suitable care and supervision \nbecause of her own poor health. See id. at 1288. Anthony was subsequently killed outside of his grandmother’s home, \napparently in a gang-related episode, and his grandmother sued on behalf of his estate. DCFS argued that the due process \nclaim was barred by DeShaney, since the state had no affirmative duty to protect children from dangers that it played no role \nin creating. See id. at 1292. The Seventh Circuit disagreed, stating: \n[T]he fact that the DCFS had been made Anthony’s guardian represents a key point of distinction from \nDeShaney.... With the agreement of both Camp and the state ... the court made the DCFS Anthony’s \nguardian. At that juncture, whether the DCFS had a duty to intervene on Anthony’s behalf was moot; it \nhad already assumed a role that made it constitutionally liable (at least to some extent) for Anthony’s \nwell-being. \nSee id. at 1292; see also id. at 1295 (emphasizing that an “affirmative duty to intervene on Anthony’s behalf ... sprang from \nthe DCFS being made his guardian”). The same reasoning applies to our case: once the plaintiffs became wards of the \nJuvenile Court, the state “assumed a role that made it constitutionally liable” for their well-being. \n  \nConcluding that the plaintiffs are entitled to the protections of the Due Process Clause only gets them part of the way to their \ngoal, however. It remains to be considered whether the state would violate their rights under that Clause if it denies them the \nservices they demand. As indicated in DeShaney, a person whose liberty has been restrained has a right to have the state \nsatisfy his or her “basic human needs—e.g., food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and reasonable safety.” DeShaney, 489 U.S. \nat 200. Neither the Second Amended Complaint nor the Consent Decree purports to enumerate all the services the plaintiffs \ndemand, but it is obvious that they are at least demanding that the state provide them with shelter. See Second Am.Compl. ¶ \n13 (stating that all of the plaintiffs “require placement outside the home. Eventually some could live at home but only with \nadequate back-up services.”); id . ¶ 33 (“Plaintiffs are homeless and dependent with no family to care for them.”). Since the \nsubstantive Due Process Clause clearly confers a right to adequate shelter, this aspect of the plaintiffs’ claims is viable. \n  \n*6 It is less certain whether the plaintiffs can state a valid constitutional claim for “appropriate care and treatment” of their \nmental and emotional disabilities. The defendants correctly observe that the obligations imposed by the substantive Due \nProcess Clause “are limited to the provision of ‘basic human needs.’ “ Def.’s Reply Mem. in Support of Mot. to Vacate or \nModify at 18 (quoting DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 200). But some kinds of psychiatric or therapeutic services undoubtedly fall \nwithin the category of basic human needs: for instance, the due process right to “reasonable safety” requires the state to \nprovide appropriate counseling or therapy to those members of the plaintiff class who, as a result of their mental or emotional \ndisabilities, pose a danger to themselves. See Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 318–19, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 \n  4 \n \n\nDavid B. v. McDonald, Not Reported in F.Supp. (1998)   \n \n(1982) (finding that the state had a constitutional duty “to provide minimally adequate or reasonable training to ensure \nsafety”). Also, the due process right to adequate “medical care” would seem to encompass certain kinds of psychiatric \ntreatment, especially since “emotional well being” is an interest protected by the Due Process Clause, see White v. Rochford, \n592 F.2d 381, 385 (7th Cir.1979); B.H. v. Johnson, 715 F.Supp. 1387, 1394–95 (N.D.Ill.1989). One court has even endorsed \nthe broad proposition that mentally ill or mentally disabled persons in state custody have a “ ‘constitutional right to receive \nsuch individual treatment as will give [them] a reasonable opportunity to be cured or to improve [their] mental condition.’ “ \nD.W. v. Rogers, 113 F.3d 1214, 1217 (11th Cir.1997) (quoting Donaldson v. O’Connor, 493 F.2d 507, 520 (5th Cir.1974), \nvacated on other grounds, 422 U.S. 563, 95 S.Ct. 2486, 45 L.Ed.2d 396 (1975)). On the other hand, the Supreme Court has \nexpressly declined to take a position on whether mentally ill or disabled persons in state custody possess a “general \nconstitutional right” to training or treatment unrelated to their physical safety. See Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 318. \n  \nIn the end, however, it is immaterial whether the plaintiffs have a constitutional right to the full scope of “appropriate care \nand treatment” to which the Consent Decree entitles them. So long as the Decree is designed to cure a constitutional \nviolation, we may enforce an agreement between the parties that provides for more relief than the Constitution itself requires. \nAs the Supreme Court explained: \n[W]e have no doubt that, to “save themselves the time, expense, and inevitable risk of litigation,” petitioners could settle \nthe dispute over the proper remedy for the constitutional violations that had been found by undertaking to do more than the \nConstitution itself requires (almost any affirmative decree beyond a directive to obey the Constitution necessarily does \nthat), but also more than what a court would have ordered absent the settlement. \nRufo, 502 U.S. at 389 (citation omitted). Since the Consent Decree in this case is rationally “related to the conditions found to \noffend the Constitution,” id., we decline to vacate it. \n  \n \nIII. Modification of the Decree \n*7 Even though the Consent Decree survives the defendants’ motion to vacate, it must nevertheless be modified in two ways. \nThe first is that we shall henceforth construe the decree “to permit Illinois to reallocate tasks among its agencies and to \nreduce the services to persons adjudicated delinquent.” David B., 116 F.3d at 1149. In other words, the defendants are free to \ncomply with the state law provisions that forbid DCFS from taking custody of any delinquent minors over the age of 13. This \nmodification does not relieve the state from its constitutional duty to provide the plaintiffs with shelter, but if the Illinois \nlegislature wishes to shift the burden of sheltering delinquent teenagers from DCFS to other agencies we see no reason why it \nshould not be able to do so. \n  \nWe do not believe that the amendments adopted in Public Act 89–21 bar DCFS from providing services to the plaintiffs aside \nfrom taking them into custody. The parties briefs responding to our order of June 17, 1996, contain lengthy arguments on this \nissue, but in the end we find most persuasive the fact that the plain text of the affected statutes does not indicate any such \nprohibition. The pertinent part of 20 ILCS 505/5(/) merely states that “[a] minor charged with a criminal offense ... or \nadjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of or committed to [DCFS] by any court....” Similarly, the amended \nsection 705 ILCS 405/5–23(1)(a) of the Juvenile Court Act indicates that “a minor found to be a delinquent under section 5–3 \nmay be ... (4) committed to [DCFS], but only if the delinquent minor is under 13 years of age.” These provisions say nothing \nabout services, and we do not think that they impliedly repeal other provisions of Illinois law that permit DCFS to assist \ndelinquent teens. See, e.g ., 20 ILCS 505/17a–10, 17a–11; see also ILL.ADMIN CODE. tit. 89, § 310.12 (1997). Obviously \nDCFS may continue to differ with us on the proper interpretation of these statutes, and if it can convince its fellow defendants \nthat its interpretation is correct, perhaps those agencies will agree to shoulder DCFS’s share of the burden of providing the \nplaintiffs with appropriate services. But as far as we can tell DCFS is permitted under state law to continue to participate in \nthe provision of services to the plaintiffs (except that it cannot take them into its custody), so we decline to modify the Decree \nto relieve it of this responsibility.8 \n  \nOur second modification is that henceforth the Decree shall only apply to minors who have been declared wards of the state, \nwhose guardians are state agencies, or who are in the physical custody of the state. This limitation is necessary because the \nonly federal claim underlying the Decree is the substantive due process claim, and this is only viable if the plaintiffs are in \nthe custody of, or in a special relationship with, the state. \n  \n \n  5 \n \n\nDavid B. v. McDonald, Not Reported in F.Supp. (1998)   \n \nII. Conclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, the plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration is granted. The Consent Decree entered into by the \nparties on October 2, 1981, shall remain in effect, with modifications as indicated in this opinion. It is so ordered. \n  \nParallel Citations \n12 NDLR P 190 \nFootnotes \n \n1  The statute provides in pertinent part: \n  In cooperation with the Department of Corrections, the Department of Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities and \n[the] Illinois State Board of Education, the Department of Children and Family Services shall establish the Governor’s Youth \nService  Initiative.  This  program  shall  offer  assistance  to  multi-problem  youth  whose  difficulties  are  not  the  clear \nresponsibility of any one state agency, and who are referred to the program by the juvenile court. The decision to establish and \nto maintain an initiative program shall be based upon the availability of program funds and the overall needs of the service \narea. \n20 ILCS 505/17a–11. \n \n2  The Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint also purported to state claims under 42 U.S.C. §§ 622, 625, but these statutes were not \n  mentioned in the Consent Decree, nor did the plaintiffs refer to them in their Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants’ Motion to \nVacate or Modify Consent Decree. Thus, we need not consider whether claims under these statutes support the Decree. \n \n3  In attempting to show that they have a substantial Rehabilitation Act claim, the plaintiffs rely on a line of cases epitomized by \n  Wagner v. Fair Acres Geriatric Ctr., 49 F.3d 1002 (3d Cir.1995). In Wagner, the plaintiff was denied admission to a nursing home \nbecause she “experience[d] episodes of combativeness, agitation and assaultiveness on a daily basis.” Id . at 1006. It was \nundisputed that this conduct was caused by Alzheimer’s disease. See id. at 1015 & n. 13. Wagner argued her disability was “the \nbehavioral aspects of her dementia,” not merely the dementia itself. See id. at 1006. The Third Circuit held that Wagner had stated \na viable Rehabilitation Act claim because the nursing home was discriminating between groups of disabled persons based on \n“behavioral aspects” of their disabilities. See id. at 1015. \nOur case is distinguishable. As Judge Easterbrook observed, the delinquent behavior of the plaintiffs is not “caused” by their \ndisabilities. Hence, a decision to deny services to the plaintiffs on the basis of their delinquency cannot be viewed as a decision \nmade on the basis of disability as it was in Wagner. \n \n4  The plaintiffs would undoubtedly have a stronger claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), than they do under the \n  Rehabilitation Act, if for no other reason than the difference in causation standards. Whereas the Rehabilitation Act requires that \nplaintiffs’ disabilities be the “sole reason” for their adverse treatment, the ADA provides a remedy so long as disability was a \n“motivating factor.” See Foster v. Arthur Andersen L.L.P., No. 96 C 5961, 1997 WL 802106, at *4–7 & n. 6 (N.D.Ill.Dec.29, \n1997). But “arguments based on the ADA are new claims, which must be made and proved; they do not breathe life into a decree \nentered under a different legal regime. Relief under a statute enacted in 1990 cannot be justified on the basis of the agencies’ \nconsent in 1981.” David B., 116 F.3d at 1150. \n \n5  The Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint also asserts that the plaintiffs have claims under the Equal Protection Clause. In their \n  briefs to this court, however, the plaintiffs make only the most cursory possible reference to this theory in a one-sentence footnote. \nSee Pl.’s Mem. in Opp’n to Def.s’ Mot. to Vacate or Modify at 48 n. 24. It is not the role of the court to construct constitutional \narguments on behalf of parties; the equal protection theory has been waived. Even were it not, however, we think it has little merit. \nCf. In re A.A., Nos. 81711, 81800, 1998 WL 21708 (Ill. Jan 23, 1998) (rejecting an equal protection challenge to the Illinois \nstatutes that prohibit DCFS from taking custody of delinquent teens). \n \n6  The plaintiff class is not limited to wards of the Juvenile Court: the class also includes children who have merely been “referred” to \n  the Juvenile Court, which may or may not result in an adjudication of wardship. See Consent Decree at 2–3. The court has \njurisdiction to declare wardship if it finds that a minor is “delinquent,” meaning that the court has found that the minor violated or \nattempted to violate federal, state, or municipal law. See 705 ILCS 405/5–1, 5–3. If the jurisdictional requirement is met, the court \nmay enter a declaration of wardship if it finds that doing so would be “in the best interests of the minor and the public.” 705 ILCS \n405/5–22(1). As discussed infra in Part III, we will modify the class covered by the Decree so that only wards of the state (or \nothers in a similar special relationship with the state) will be covered by it. \n \n7  Moreover, although we lack precise information on this point, it seems clear that a large majority of the plaintiffs have DCFS or \n  another state agency appointed as their guardian by the Juvenile Court. A smaller subset of the class is actually placed in the \ncustody of the state. \n  6 \n \n\nDavid B. v. McDonald, Not Reported in F.Supp. (1998)   \n \n \n8  At one point in its opinion, the Seventh Circuit suggested that the Decree suffers from a “lack of specificity” since it merely \n  requires the provision of “appropriate” care and treatment, leaving it to GYSI to determine what that might mean in each particular \ncase. See David B., 116 F.3d at 1148. Although the Decree is phrased in general terms, its history shows that this is unlikely to be a \nproblem. For 15 years the parties lived under the Decree and determined the scope of “appropriate” care and treatment by \nthemselves; not once did they require the assistance of this court to determine what services were required. Given the variety of \nservices needed by the plaintiffs, it seems expedient to give the defendants the flexibility to formulate treatment plans on a \ncase-by-case basis rather than to try and articulate general rules about who is entitled to what. \n \n \n \n \n  7 \n ",

Greenspan, Attorney General's Office, Chicago, IL, for Jess McDonald.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\nASPEN, Chief Judge:\nThe parties settled this dispute almost fifteen years ago with the entry of a Consent Decree. One of the\n[1]\ndefendants, Jess McDonald, Director of the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (\"DCFS\"),  no\nlonger wishes his agency to be bound by that agreement. The plaintiffs, a class of adolescent wards and potential\nwards of the Juvenile Court of Cook County who suffer from severe emotional, physical, or mental impairments,\nand who previously were denied necessary services by the defendant agencies, oppose any attempt to vacate or\nmodify the Consent Decree. After careful consideration of the memoranda and supplemental memoranda\nsubmitted by the parties, we conclude that vacatur or modification of the Consent Decree is not warranted, and\ntherefore deny the defendant's motion.\nI. Background\nThe original complaint in this action was filed on April 25, 1979, but the relevant pleading for purposes of the\n843 instant motion is the Second Amended Complaint (\"Complaint\") filed on March 1, 1980.[2] The named *843\nplaintiffs 00 David B., James S., Richard D., Christine B., and Germaine M. 00 brought suit on behalf of a class of\n97 97\nchildren in Cook County who (1) were either wards of the Juvenile Court or who had petitions for wardship\npending against them in Juvenile Court, and (2) who suffered from emotional, physical, or mental disabilities.\nCompl. ¶ 3. The Complaint alleges that the plaintiffs' disabilities caused them to commit delinquent and criminal\nacts, leading the Illinois State's Attorney's Office or other entities to petition for orders adjudicating them wards of\nthe Juvenile Court. See 705 ILCS 405/2-13 (abused, neglected, dependent minors), 405/5-13 (delinquent\nminors). In most cases, however, the State's Attorney's Office did not consider the offenses serious enough, or\nthe children culpable enough, to prosecute the delinquency petitions or seek commitment of the children to the\nIllinois Department of Corrections (\"DOC\"). Compl. ¶ 11. While children in this situation would usually be released\nto the custody of their parents or guardians, the children in the plaintiff class demonstrated such severe mental\nand emotional disabilities that their families were unable to adequately treat and care for them. Id. ¶¶ 10, 13.\nInstead of incarcerating these children at the DOC, where treatment options were severely limited, judges of the\nJuvenile Court sought to place these youngsters with various state agencies that could provide treatment and\ncare for them.\n\nHowever, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants 00 the heads of DCFS, the Illinois Department of Mental Health\n97\nand Developmental Disabilities (\"DMHDD\"), and the State Board of Education (\"SBE\") 00 refused to provide them\n97\nwith necessary services and treatment because of their disabilities. All of the defendant agencies took the\nposition that the children were either too disabled or not disabled enough to receive public services or public\nfunds for private care. Thus, despite the fact that these children had mental and emotional disabilities, DMHDD\ndecided that they were not entitled to treatment from DMHDD because they did not require extended\nhospitalization. Complaint ¶ 12. DCFS conceded that many of these individuals were neglected and abused, and\nthus would normally be entitled to assistance, but the agency maintained that the plaintiffs were not entitled to\nDCFS services because either they were not so abused as to require placement outside the family, or they were\ntoo disruptive to be placed with other DCFS children. Id. ¶¶ 13, 29-30. SBE acknowledged that these children\nhad special educational needs, but considered them the problem of DMHDD and DCFS because they required\nplacement in residential treatment programs. As a result, these children \"fell between the placement cracks,\" and\nwere left to fend for themselves at the DOC or on the streets. Id. ¶¶ 11-23.\nThe putative class action Complaint alleged that the defendants denied the plaintiffs necessary services because\nof their disabilities, and that this conduct violated Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29\nU.S.C. § 794, and the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. On September\n4, 1980, Judge John Powers Crowley denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the Complaint in an unpublished\nopinion. The court concluded it could not dismiss the plaintiffs' equal protection claims because, based on the\nallegations in the Complaint, not even a rational basis had been proffered for the refusal to treat these children.\nThe court also rejected the defendants' attack on the Rehabilitation Act claims, finding that the Complaint\nsufficiently alleged (1) that the plaintiffs were disabled, (2) that they were \"otherwise qualified\" for the defendants'\n[3]\nservices, and (3) that they were being excluded from these services \"solely by reason\" of their disability.\n844 The action was reassigned to this court on June 30, 1981, and in late 1981 the parties *844 proposed to resolve\nthe matter through the entry of a Consent Decree. Under the Consent Decree, those children under the age of\nseventeen (or twenty if already wards of the Juvenile Court) who are referred to the Juvenile Court and alleged to\nhave violated the Illinois Juvenile Court Act, and are in need of \"specialized services\" such as welfare, mental\nhealth treatment, and education, but who have been refused such treatment by the defendant agencies, shall be\nreferred to the Governor's Youth Services Initiative (\"GYSI\"). Decree at 4-5. The GYSI, a unit staffed by members\nof DCFS, DMHDD, and SBE, would be entrusted with the obligation of \"ensur[ing] that this population of children\nreceive appropriate care and treatment under the least restrictive conditions as may be required in each\nindividual case.\" Id. at 5. Although the Consent Decree does not obligate GYSI or any of its members to take\nwardship of the plaintiffs, it does require the unit to promptly review referrals, formulate \"interim and long term\nservice recommendations\" for each child, and develop a \"comprehensive service plan\" to carry out these\nrecommendations. Id. On October 2, 1981, we approved this Consent Decree, entered final judgment on all\nclaims, and retained jurisdiction over the cause to enforce the terms of the decree.\nThere is no real dispute that since the entry of the Consent Decree, GYSI has operated rather smoothly in its\nevaluation and placement of children in the plaintiff class. After hearing a delinquency petition against a child with\nmental or emotional disabilities, a juvenile court judge will refer that child to GYSI if the judge concludes that\ncommitment of the child to DOC would be inappropriate. After receiving a report on each child from the probation\ndepartment, a GYSI panel comprised of representatives from the defendant agencies evaluates each referral and\nproposes recommendations. For most of the children, GYSI recommends residential placement in a facility that\ncan provide adequate supervision and treatment. Since none of the defendant agencies operates this type of\nfacility, the children are usually placed with private treatment providers that bill the defendants for the cost.\nAlthough the Consent Decree does not explicitly apportion the costs of such treatment among the defendants, in\npractice DCFS has borne approximately one-third of the cost of treating these individuals. Since the entry of the\nConsent Decree, none of the parties has come before this court to request enforcement or modification of the\nagreement.\nHowever, DCFS now contends that because of changes in federal and state law since 1980, the plaintiffs no\n[4]\nlonger have a substantial federal claim supporting enforcement of the Consent Decree.  Specifically, the\ndefendant maintains that its rejection of the plaintiffs does not violate the Rehabilitation Act because this decision\n\nis not made \"solely\" by reason of the plaintiffs' disabilities. Alternatively, DCFS maintains that recent amendments\nto both its enabling statute and the Juvenile Court Act prevent the agency from paying for services provided to\nminors above the age of thirteen who are charged with criminal conduct or adjudged delinquent. Therefore,\nDCFS argues, this substantial change in Illinois law removes any valid federal claim for many of the plaintiffs\nsince these persons are no longer \"otherwise qualified\" for DCFS services. The agency contends it should no\nlonger be obligated by the Consent Decree, or at a minimum, DCFS should not be required to pay for the\n[5]\nresidential treatment of those over age thirteen who have been charged with a crime or adjudicated delinquent.\nII. Standard for Vacating or Modifying a Consent Decree\n845 Despite the fact that all the parties to this dispute voluntarily agreed to abide by the *845 terms of the Consent\nDecree, this does not preclude DCFS from arguing that its obligations under the decree should be lifted. In Rufo\nv. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 378, 112 S.Ct. 748, 757, 116 L.Ed.2d 867 (1992), the Supreme\nCourt held that although consent decrees are contractual in nature, they are essentially judicial decrees that may\nbe modified according to the rules applicable to other judgments and decrees. Specifically, consent decrees may\nbe modified or vacated pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5):\nOn motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or a party's legal\nrepresentative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: ... (5) the\njudgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based\nhas been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have\nprospective application....\n\"A party seeking modification of a consent decree bears the burden of establishing that a significant change in\ncircumstances warrants revision of the decree.\" Rufo, 502 U.S. at 383, 112 S.Ct. at 759. Although district courts\nmust be flexible in their application of Rule 60(b)(5), in general, modification or vacatur of a consent decree will\nbe justifiable only if the movant shows \"a significant change either in factual conditions or the law.\" Id. at 384,\n393, 112 S.Ct. at 760, 764. The former sort of change must be a significant factual variation that the parties did\nnot anticipate at the time they entered into the decree. Id. at 384-85, 112 S.Ct. at 760-61. The latter type of\nchange may include alterations in federal law that now prohibit a party from performing its obligations under the\ndecree, or changes that \"make legal what the decree was designed to prevent.\" Id. at 388, 112 S.Ct. at 762. The\nCourt in Rufo further explained that \"[w]hile a decision that clarifies the law will not, in and of itself, provide a\nbasis for modifying a decree, it could constitute a change in circumstances that would support modification if the\nparties had based their agreement on a misunderstanding of the governing law.\" Id. at 390, 112 S.Ct. at 763.\nThus, after considering whether the district court properly exercised its discretion in refusing to modify a consent\ndecree covering a county jail, the Court remanded for the district court to determine whether (1) the increase in\nthe population of pretrial detainees was unexpected at the time of the decree, or (2) the parties misunderstood\nthe law regarding \"double-celling\" of inmates at the time they signed the decree. If either of these conditions\nexisted, the administrators of the county jail were entitled to argue that modification of the consent decree was\n[6]\nwarranted.\nIn Evans v. City of Chicago, 10 F.3d 474 (7th Cir.1993) (Evans III), cert. denied,511 U.S. 1082, 114 S.Ct. 1831,\n128 L.Ed.2d 460 (1994), the Seventh Circuit sitting en banc addressed the impact of Rufo on consent decrees\nentered against municipalities. The plaintiffs in Evans III had based their claims on the Due Process and Equal\nProtection Clauses, and originally a portion of these claims had been upheld by a panel of the Seventh Circuit. \nEvans v. Chicago, 689 F.2d 1286, 1299-1300 (7th Cir.1982) (Evans I). However, a subsequent panel reversed\nthis decision, Evans v. City of Chicago, 873 F.2d 1007, 1015-18 (7th Cir.1989) (Evans II), and on the third\nconsideration by the Seventh Circuit a plurality of the court vacated the consent decree that had been entered\ninto by the parties during the years between Evans I and Evans II. The plurality in Evans III reasoned that the\nconsent decree did not actually settle the issues between the parties, id. at 476-77, and that even if it did,\nconcerns of federalism and democracy prevented the district court from enforcing the decree after the federal\nclaims had been rejected in Evans II, id. at 477-481. The plurality concluded that the City of Chicago could no\nlonger be held to the terms of a consent decree previously entered into by the parties, because the \"entry and\n846 continued enforcement of a consent decree regulating the operation *846 of a governmental body depend on the\n\nexistence of a substantial claim under federal law.\" Id. at 480. Judge Ripple concurred in the judgment of the\ncourt, but refused to adopt the broad tenets advocated by the plurality for dealing with federal consent decrees\nentered into by municipalities. Evans III, 10 F.3d at 483 (Ripple, J., concurring). Rather, he simply concluded that\n00 under the unique procedural posture of the case 00 the prevailing law had changed to such a degree as to\n97 97\nrender continued enforcement of the decree against the City of Chicago \"inappropriate.\" Id.\nAlthough DCFS argues that we are bound to accept the reasoning of the plurality opinion in Evans III, and\ntherefore must vacate the instant decree if we find no substantial federal claim underlying the plaintiffs'\nComplaint, we do not believe Evans III so constrains us. At least with regard to interpreting Supreme Court\nopinions:\nWhen a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the\nassent of [a majority of] Justices, \"the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken\nby those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds....\"\nMarks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 193, 97 S.Ct. 990, 993, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977) (quoting Gregg v. Georgia,\n428 U.S. 153, 169 n. 15, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 2923 n. 15, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976) (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and\nStevens, JJ.)); accord Romano v. Oklahoma, 512 U.S. 1, 8-9, 114 S.Ct. 2004, 2010, 129 L.Ed.2d 1 (1994). No\nopinion in Evans III commanded a majority of judges on the Court of Appeals, and thus the holding of the case is\nthe narrower grounds adopted by Judge Ripple. That is, vacatur of a consent decree must be granted to a\ndefendant when a prior decision upholding the plaintiff's legal theory is subsequently overruled by the same (or\nhigher) court.\nOutside of unusual cases where the federal law basis permitting a federal court to enforce a consent decree has\ndisappeared, however, we believe the Supreme Court's more general analysis in Rufo controls our resolution of\nmotions to vacate or modify consent decrees. Thus, to prevail on its motion, DCFS must demonstrate that the\nsubstantive law underlying the plaintiffs' Complaint has so clearly and dramatically changed as to render\ncontinued enforcement of the Consent Decree inequitable. See Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b)(5); Rufo, 502 U.S. at 388-90,\n112 S.Ct. at 762-63.\nIII. Discussion\nThe defendant's motion springs from recently enacted Illinois legislation that alters the mandate of DCFS with\nregard to children accused or adjudicated of delinquent offenses. Prior to June 1995, the enabling statute for\nDCFS allowed the agency, at its discretion, to \"accept for care and training any child [aged 13 or older] who has\nbeen adjudicated delinquent, addicted, as a truant minor in need of supervision[,] or as a minor requiring\nauthoritative intervention,\" and required the agency to accept those delinquents under the age of thirteen. 20\nILCS 505/5(l) (West 1993). However, in 1995 the State of Illinois amended this statute to read, in pertinent part:\nThe Department may, at its discretion except for those children also adjudicated neglected or\ndependent, accept for care and training any child who has been adjudicated addicted, as a truant\nminor in need of supervision or as a minor requiring authoritative intervention, under the Juvenile\nCourt Act or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, but no such child shall be committed to the\nDepartment by any court without the approval of the Department. A minor charged with a criminal\noffense under the Criminal Code of 1961 or adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the\ncustody of or committed to the Department by any court, except a minor less than 13 years of age\ncommitted to the Department under Section 5-23 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987....\n[7]\n20 ILCS 505/(l) (West Supp.1996) (as amended by P.A. 89-21). Based on the new language in this statute,\n847 DCFS has taken *847 the position that it can no longer \"serve\" members of the plaintiff class aged thirteen and\n[8]\nover through GYSI, and has sought to effectuate this reading in various Juvenile Court proceedings.  Both the\nPublic Guardian and the Juvenile Court have prevented DCFS from backing out of GYSI, relying on their reading\nof the Consent Decree in this case. DCFS now seeks to vacate or modify the Consent Decree so that its\nobligations under the decree conform to the agency's interpretation of 505/5(l).\n\nThe agency's primary contention is that the plaintiffs no longer have a viable claim under Section 504 the\nRehabilitation Act to support their complaint. Section 504 currently reads:\nNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States, as defined in section 706(8)\nof this title, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be\ndenied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving\nFederal financial assistance or under any program or activity conducted by any Executive agency\nor by the United States Postal Service.\n29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (emphasis added). DCFS first argues, based on federal case law decided after entry of the\nConsent Decree, that its exclusion of the plaintiffs from GYSI is not undertaken \"solely by reason\" of the plaintiffs'\ndisabilities, and therefore not actionable under Section 504. Specifically, the defendant points to Traynor v.\nTurnage, 485 U.S. 535, 549-51, 108 S.Ct. 1372, 1382-84, 99 L.Ed.2d 618 (1988), in which the Supreme Court\nconsidered whether Congress' prohibition against extending the time for receiving veterans' benefits to those who\nwere disabled because of their own \"willful misconduct,\" 38 U.S.C. § 3462(a)(1) (previously 38 U.S.C. § 1662(a)\n(1)), along with the Veterans Administration regulation interpreting that provision as applying to alcoholics,\nviolated the Rehabilitation Act. The Court observed that in enacting later amendments to the Rehabilitation Act,\nCongress did not repeal or amend this \"willful misconduct\" provision in the VA statute, nor did it \"expressly\ndisavow its [prior] determination that primary alcoholism is not the sort of disability that warrants an exemption\nfrom the time constraints of § [3462(a)(1)].\" Id. at 547, 108 S.Ct. at 1381. Thus, the Court concluded that the\nbroad language of Section 504 did not repeal the more specific prohibition against extending certain benefits to\nthose whose disabilities are caused by \"willful misconduct.\" Id. 547-48, 108 S.Ct. at 1381-82. In discussing why\nthis reading of these statutes was not implausible, the Court stated:\n[T]here is nothing in the Rehabilitation Act that requires that any benefit extended to one category\nof handicapped persons also be extended to all other categories of handicapped persons....\nCongress is entitled to establish priorities for the allocation of limited resources available for\nveterans' benefits, and thereby to conclude that veterans who bear some responsibility for their\ndisabilities have no stronger claim to an extended eligibility period than do able-bodied veterans.\nThose veterans are not, in the words of § 504, denied benefits \"solely by reason of [their]\nhandicap,\" but because they engaged with some degree of willfulness in the conduct that caused\nthem to become disabled.\n485 U.S. at 549-50, 108 S.Ct. at 1382-83 (citations omitted). Using similar reasoning, the defendant argues that\nSection 504 is inapplicable to DCFS's decision to exclude the plaintiffs from GYSI because of their delinquent\nbehavior.\nWe do not think the matter is as free from doubt as DCFS would have us believe. The above quoted language\nfrom Traynor does not directly bear on the issue presented in the instant case, since the actual question in \nTraynor was whether Congress had created an exception to the scope of Section 504, not whether a state\n848 legislature may do so.[9] In *848 addition, the rule of law extrapolated by DCFS from Traynor 00 that Section 504\n97\nis not concerned about discrimination between groups of disabled persons, or about discrimination based on the\nseverity of one's disability 00 is directly contradicted by a Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\")\n97\n[10]\nregulation interpreting the Rehabilitation Act. 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(1)(iv) ; see also 28 C.F.R. § 35.130\n(Department of Justice regulation for ADA that mirrors § 84.4). Indeed, Judge Crowley relied upon this same HHS\nregulation when he rejected a similar argument raised by DCFS in 1980, and neither HHS nor Congress has\nseen fit to alter the language of this provision since that time.\nMoreover, the lower courts have not uniformly adopted the defendant's interpretation of Section 504. To be sure,\nsome courts have suggested that discriminating between groups of handicapped persons does not violate\nSection 504. E.g., Colin K. by John K. v. Schmidt, 715 F.2d 1, 9 (1st Cir.1983). However, several others have\nconcluded that the severity of one's disability can itself be disability, and that the denial of services based on the\nseverity of a handicap would contravene Section 504. Wagner by Wagner v. Fair Acres Geriatric Ctr., 49 F.3d\n1002, 1016 n. 15 (3d Cir.1995) (\"While section 504 does not apply to programs choosing among similarly\n\nhandicapped people, an action under section 504 exists if a program is found to discriminate between distinct\nclasses of handicapped persons.\"); Plummer v. Branstad, 731 F.2d 574, 578 (8th Cir.1984); Messier v. Southbury\nTraining Sch., 916 F.Supp. 133, 141 (D.Conn.1996) (collecting cases); McGuire v. Switzer, 734 F.Supp. 99,\n114-15 (S.D.N.Y.1990) (permitting paraplegic's § 504 claim of discrimination vis-a-vis blind persons); Clark v.\nCohen, 613 F.Supp. 684, 692 n. 6, 693-94 (E.D.Pa.1985) (recognizing possibility of such a claim under § 504), \naff'd,794 F.2d 79 (3d Cir.),cert. denied,479 U.S. 962, 107 S.Ct. 459, 93 L.Ed.2d 404 (1986). Indeed, at least two\ndistrict courts have explicitly rejected the argument that Traynor precludes the application of Section 504 to\ndiscriminatory actions undertaken because of the severity of a disability. Messier, 916 F.Supp. at 142 n. 7; Martin\nv. Voinovich, 840 F.Supp. 1175, 1191-92 (S.D.Ohio 1993).\nWe need not weigh in on this debate. For purposes of deciding the instant motion, it is sufficient to state that the\nplaintiffs allege they have been discriminated against because of the severity of their disabilities, and that DCFS\nhas not demonstrated this sort of a claim to clearly fall outside the purview of Section 504. The cases and\nregulations supporting the plaintiffs' claim that they were discriminated against \"solely by reason\" of their disability\nhave not been overruled, cf. Evans III, 10 F.3d at 480-81 (plurality); Id. at 483 (Ripple, J., concurring), and it is far\nfrom conclusive that the law is to the contrary, cf. Sweeton v. Brown, 27 F.3d 1162, 1166 (6th Cir.1994) (vacating\nconsent decree based on clear and indisputable change in decisional law underlying the plaintiffs' complaint), \ncert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 115 S.Ct. 1118, 130 L.Ed.2d 1082 (1995). In sum, the defendant has not carried its\n[11]\nburden of showing a significant change in the law on this point to justify modification or vacatur.\n849 *849 DCFS's second argument is based on the \"otherwise qualified\" requirement of Section 504. \"An otherwise\nqualified person is one who is able to meet all of the program's requirements in spite of his handicap.\" \nSoutheastern Community College v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397, 406, 99 S.Ct. 2361, 2367, 60 L.Ed.2d 980 (1979). To\ndetermine whether an individual is \"otherwise qualified,\" reference must be made to the state statute or regulation\noutlining the eligibility requirements of the program receiving federal funding. Dempsey by Dempsey v. Ladd, 840\nF.2d 638, 640 (9th Cir.1987). Under the defendant's reading of 20 ILCS 505/5(l), DCFS is prohibited from\nproviding the plaintiffs with any services to treat their mental and emotional disabilities because they have been\nbrought before the Juvenile Court on delinquency petitions. Therefore, DCFS argues, the plaintiffs are no longer\n\"otherwise qualified\" for DCFS services, and their exclusion from the GYSI program does not subvert Section\n504.\nAlthough DCFS repeatedly insists that 505/5(l) now prohibits the provision of \"services\" to delinquent youths,\nDef.'s Mem. at 10, 11, 23; Def.'s Reply Mem. at 12, we do not believe this interpretation is supported by the text\nof the statute. Initially, the defendant relies on the following portion of the revised 505/5(l) to support its argument:\nA minor charged with a criminal offense under the Criminal Code of 1961 or adjudicated\ndelinquent shall not be placed in the custody of or committed to the Department by any court....\n(emphasis added). The statute does not say that DCFS is prohibited from providing \"services\" to delinquent\nindividuals, but rather, that these persons cannot be thrust into the \"custody\" of DCFS or \"committed to\" DCFS by\na Juvenile Court. The Juvenile Court Act defines \"legal custody\" as a relationship created by court order whereby\na custodian is responsible for physical possession, protection, training, and sustenance of the minor. 705 ILCS\n405/1-3(9) (West 1996). Similarly, the Juvenile Court Act uses the terms \"commitment\" and \"placement\" to\nindicate the transfer of legal custody of a minor child, along with the concomitant responsibilities of such custody,\nto another individual or agency pursuant to court order. See 705 ILCS 405/2-23, 405/2-27, 405/5-23, 405/5-29\n[12]\n(West 1996).  This interpretation is supported by In re C.T., 281 Ill.App.3d 189, 217 Ill.Dec. 219, 221-22, 666\nN.E.2d 888, 890-91 (1996), in which the Illinois Appellate Court for the Second District reversed a Juvenile Court\norder appointing DCFS the legal guardian of a minor who had been adjudicated delinquent. The court stated that\nthe statutes at issue \"set[] forth a clear prohibition on the commitment of such minors to the custody of DCFS,\nexcepting only those minors less than 13 years of age,\" and concluded that the minor's \"commitment to the\ncustody of DCFS was improper.\" Id.217 Ill.Dec. at 222, 666 N.E.2d at 891 (emphasis added).\nIn contrast, referral to GYSI does not equate to \"commitment to the custody of DCFS,\" since it does not entail the\ntransfer of \"legal custody\" to DCFS, and the agency is not saddled with the \"responsibility of physical protection\"\nof the minors referred by the Juvenile Court. Although the parties disagree on which agency or entity performs\n\nwhich functions in the course of a GYSI placement, the essential operations of the GYSI scheme are not\ndisputed. Initially, the Juvenile Court refers a minor to GYSI after concluding that treatment services are more\nappropriate than commitment to the DOC, and all alternative avenues of obtaining treatment have been\nexhausted. The GYSI representatives determine whether the minor requires residential treatment or other\nassistance, and present their treatment recommendations to the court. If the court approves the plan, GYSI\nrepresentatives from the participating agencies prepare the necessary documentation and arrangements. Where\n850 the minor is to be sent for residential treatment outside Illinois, the Juvenile Court *850 makes a finding of\ndelinquency and adjudges the child a ward of the court, leaving the parents as legal guardians of the minor. If the\nfacility outside Illinois accepts the child, the court orders the minor placed on probation with the condition that he\nfully cooperate with the staff at the facility chosen by GYSI. None of the GYSI agencies become the minor's\nguardian or legal custodian, nor do they indicate that they have such authority when arranging the child's\ntreatment. In sum, nothing in the GYSI process leads to the placement of minors into the \"custody of or commit\n[13]\n[ment] to\" DCFS.  Rather, participation in GYSI and the Consent Decree is consistent with the agency's\ncharge to \"establish and maintain tax-supported child welfare services ... to the end that services and care shall\nbe available on an equal basis throughout the State to children requiring such services,\" 20 ILCS 505/5(c), and\n[14]\nits obligation to provide \"child welfare services,\" 20 ILCS 505/5(a)(3).\nPerhaps realizing these problems with its argument, DCFS has changed course in its supplemental briefing and\nnow relies on a different portion of 505/5(l) to support its contention that the plaintiffs are not \"otherwise eligible\"\nfor DCFS services. DCFS maintains that because P.A. 89-21 removed the word \"delinquent\" from the portion of\nthe statute authorizing the agency to \"accept for care and training any child who has been adjudicated addicted,\nas a truant minor in need of supervision or as a minor requiring authoritative intervention,\" the legislature must\nhave intended to remove DCFS's authority to provide services to delinquent minors through any program,\nincluding GYSI.\nAs with the defendant's initial attack, we find this view of the law unsupported by the text of 505/5(l). In pertinent\npart, the relevant provision of the statute reads:\n[DCFS] may, at its discretion except for those children also adjudicated neglected or dependent,\naccept for care and training any child who has been adjudicated addicted, as a truant minor in\nneed of supervision or as a minor requiring authoritative intervention, ... but no such child shall be\ncommitted to [DCFS] by any court without the approval of [DCFS].\n20 ILCS 505/5(l). When read in context, it is apparent that the phrase \"accept for care and training\" refers to the\naction taken by DCFS when the Juvenile Court commits a minor to the custody of the agency. This interpretation\nis further supported by the immediately preceding subsection, which states that DCFS \"shall accept for care and\ntraining any child who had been adjudicated neglected or abused, or dependent committed to it pursuant to the\nJuvenile Court Act or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.\" 20 ILCS 505/5(k) (West 1996) (emphasis added). Under\nthis view of the statute, the purpose of deleting the term \"delinquent\" from the list of those who may be accepted\nfor \"care and training\" is obvious: given that the paragraph goes on to prohibit the Juvenile Court from \"plac[ing]\n851 in the custody of or committ[ing] to the Department\" any minor *851 charged with a criminal offense or adjudged\ndelinquent, it would make no sense if the same subsection required DCFS to nonetheless accept such children\nfor \"care and training.\"\nAt bottom, DCFS asks this court to interpret the amendments contained in P.A. 89-21 to say that the agency\ncannot be made to pay for any services for abused and neglected children who have been charged with a crime\nor deemed delinquent. However, given that the Illinois legislature could easily have included such language in\nDCFS's enabling statute, but instead chose only to restrict the ability of the Juvenile Court to \"commit\"\ndelinquents to DCFS or place them in the agency's \"custody,\" DCFS's interpretation cannot be accepted.\nBecause Illinois law does not preclude the plaintiffs from receiving DCFS services based on their delinquency,\nDCFS has failed to demonstrate that these children are not \"otherwise qualified\" for such services. Accordingly,\nwe conclude that the defendant has not satisfied its burden of showing the substantial change in law needed to\n[15]\njustify modification or vacatur of the Consent Decree, and its motion must be denied.\n\nIV. Conclusion\nWe are cognizant of the federalism concerns implicated any time a federal court requires a state agency to\nconform its conduct to a judicial decree. Nonetheless, DCFS freely agreed to settle this dispute over a decade\nago on the terms outlined in the Consent Decree. There is no indication that performance under the decree has\nbeen rendered terribly impracticable due to unexpected changes in the factual circumstances, or that the parties\nentered into the decree while laboring under a misconception of the law. See Rufo, 502 U.S. at 385, 390, 112\nS.Ct. at 760, 763. Nor is it apparent that the federal claims raised by the plaintiffs in their Complaint are\ninsubstantial. Thus, we see no grounds for relieving DCFS from the obligations it voluntarily undertook in 1981.\nFor these reasons, the defendant's motion to vacate or modify the Consent Decree is denied. It is so ordered.\n[1] All of the original defendants in this action, who were sued in their official capacities, have been succeeded\nsince the entry of the Consent Decree. Accordingly, we have automatically substituted the current heads of the\ndefendant agencies as the named defendants. Fed.R.Civ.P. 25(d)(1).\n[2] A similar action was filed in August 1978 in the Circuit Court of Cook County, and was resolved pursuant to\nessentially the same settlement agreement reached in this case. David B. v. DeVito, 86 Ill.App.3d 787, 41 Ill.Dec.\n853, 408 N.E.2d 275 (1980).\n[3] The Court also rejected SBE's argument that it owed no duty to provide education services to disabled\nchildren. However, the Court did dismiss the claims of three Juvenile Court probation officers for lack of standing,\nas well as all claims against the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services.\n[4] DCFS also argues that many of the children referred to GYSI are charged with a wide range of rather violent\noffenses, and that the treatments proposed by GYSI have become more expensive because of the dangerous\npropensities these children possess. However, DCFS does not argue that these changes are so unexpected and\nsignificant in themselves to justify vacatur or modification of the decree. Thus, we need only consider this\nargument to the extent it illuminates our understanding of the operation of GYSI and the recent enactments of the\nIllinois legislature.\n[5] The heads of the other defendant agencies have not objected to DCFS's motion.\n[6] Although the Supreme Court spoke only of modification in Rufo, the defendant's primary argument for vacatur\nis based on subsequent changes in the law. We see no reason why Rufo would not apply to DCFS's request to\nvacate the Consent Decree, and therefore analyze the issue according to the standards outlined in that case.\n[7] P.A. 89-21 also amended several provisions of the Juvenile Court Act to include similar language. See 705\nILCS 405/2-10, 405/2-27, 405/5-23. However, DCFS does not contend that these additional amendments raise\nseparate grounds for vacating or modifying the decree.\n[8] DCFS does not dispute that it must provide services to those under the age of thirteen who are adjudicated\ndelinquent.\n[9] Indeed, a Department of Health and Human Services regulation interpreting § 504 states that the\nRehabilitation Act does not prohibit \"exclusion of a specific class of handicapped persons from a program limited\nby Federal statute or executive order to a different class of handicapped persons.\" 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(c) (emphasis\nadded).\n[10] \"A recipient [of federal funds], in providing any aid, benefit, or service, may not, directly or through\ncontractual, licensing, or other arrangements, on the basis of handicap: ... Provide different or separate aid,\nbenefits, or services to handicapped persons or to any class of handicapped persons unless such action is\nnecessary to provide qualified handicapped persons with aid, benefits, or services that are as effective as those\nprovided to others....\" 45 C.F.R. 84.4(b)(1)(iv) (emphasis added). Because these regulations \"were drafted with\nthe oversight and approval of Congress,\" they are considered \"an important source of guidance on the meaning\nof § 504.\" Traynor, 485 U.S. at 549, 108 S.Ct. at 1382 (quotations and citations omitted).\n\n[11] The additional cases cited by DCFS do not show otherwise. The plaintiff in Talley v. Lane, 13 F.3d 1031,\n1034 (7th Cir.1994), only alleged that he had been denied public housing because of his past criminal record, not\nbecause of any disability. Id. at 1034. Moreover, the Court of Appeals analyzed the issue according to whether\nthe plaintiff was \"otherwise qualified\" for the benefit, not whether his exclusion was \"solely by reason\" of a\ndisability. Id. Similarly, Anderson v. University of Wisconsin, 841 F.2d 737, 740 (7th Cir.1988), dealt with the\nquestion of whether an alcoholic who failed to meet a university's academic requirements was \"otherwise\nqualified\" to remain at the institution's law school. The issue presented in these cases 00 the applicability of the\n97\n\"otherwise qualified\" prong of Section 504 00 is discussed more fully below.\n97\n[12]See also 705 ILCS 405/5-33(3) (requiring appointment of Assistant Director of Corrections as legal custodian\nfor any minor \"commit[ted]\" to the DOC).\n[13] Indeed, the enabling statute for GYSI does not even mention the terms \"custody,\" \"commitment,\" or\n\"placement.\" See 20 ILCS 505/17a-11.\n[14] \"Child welfare services\" means public social services which are directed toward the accomplishment of the\nfollowing purposes: \n(A) protecting and promoting the welfare of children, including homeless, dependent or neglected children;\n(B) preventing or remedying, or assisting in the solution of problems which may result in, the neglect, abuse,\nexploitation or delinquency of children;\n(C) preventing the unnecessary separation of children from their families by identifying family problems, assisting\nfamilies in resolving their problems, and preventing the breakup of the family where the prevention of child\nremoval is desirable and possible;\n(D) restoring to their families children who have been removed, by the provision of services to the child and the\nfamilies;\n(E) placing children in suitable adoptive homes, in cases where restoration to the biological family is not possible\nor appropriate;\n(F) assuring adequate care of children away from their homes, in cases where the child cannot be returned home\nor cannot be placed for adoption;\n(G) providing supportive services and living maintenance which contribute to the physical, emotional and social\nwell-being of children who are pregnant and unmarried;\n(H) providing shelter and independent living services for homeless youth....\n20 ILCS 505/5(a)(3).\n[15] As we have rejected the defendant's attack on the Rehabilitation Act claim in the Complaint, we need not\naddress the other arguments raised by DCFS against the due process and equal protection claims.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
