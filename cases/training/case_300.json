The class consisted of all current and future residents of the NRCC who are educationally handicapped and who are in need of special education and related services.  At least 25% of the population at NRCC fell into this class.  The class, represented by the Youth Law Center and private counsel, specifically alleged that defendants routinely failed to identify and assess special education needs and develop individual educational plans for youth confined at their facilities.  Plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief.</p><p>On February 15, 1990, the parties filed a stipulation and order with the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California.  Defendants agreed to provide class members with free public education that included special education and related services.  Related services included speech and hearing services, physical and occupational therapy, and psychological and counseling services.  Defendants also agreed to implement policies and procedures to promptly identify and assess the educational needs of the youth confined at the NRCC facility and to develop and individual education program for all class members.  The parties agreed that the settlement would be in effect for three years, and that monitors would evaluate defendants' compliance with the agreement.</p><p>On May 7, 1990, the district court (Judge Samuel P. King) entered a final judgment incorporating the terms of the stipulation and agreement.  The court maintained jurisdiction to award attorneys fees and costs and to monitor and enforce the terms of the stipulation and order.  The agreement continued to be extended until July 11, 2000, and the docket continued to May 21, 2001 with the settlement of attorneys' fees and costs approved and the case dismissed.</p><p></p>",

The bill provides   \n          that the pilot program will be funded with federal funds   \n          and will report annually to the CYA and SDE.  A final   \n          report shall be submitted to the Legislature not later than   \n          11/1/06 regarding the effectiveness of the program. \n                              Fiscal Impact (in thousands) \n           Major Provisions            2001-02             2002-03               \n           2003-04            Fund   \n          Pilot program     $250 to $500, potentially more dependingGeneral \n                            on funding and mission of program \n \n          STAFF COMMENTS: This bill meets the criteria to be placed   \n          on the Suspense File. \n           \n          In Nick O .v. Terhune, the Youth Law Center brought a   \n          federal class action challenging the failure of the CYA to   \n          provide appropriate special education and related services   \n          to youth confined in CYA institutions.  Judgement was   \n          entered on 5/7/90, in which the CYA agreed to ensure that   \n          wards would be provided with a free appropriate public   \n          education including special education and related services,   \n          in the least restrictive environment consistent with their   \n          unique needs in compliance with federal and state law. \n \n          The CYA subsequently hired approximately 100 new teachers   \n          and educational administrators, and greatly improved   \n          screening procedures for incoming wards.  Because of   \n          ongoing concerns about compliance with the terms of the   \n          settlement, particularly the provision of special education   \n          services to youth in lockdown units, the Youth Law Center   \n          continued to monitor the terms of the settlement with   \n          respect to certain institutions.  That monitoring period   \n          expired in January 2001. \n \n          Regarding this issue, Senate Subcommittee #1 took the   \n \n \n \n \n \n(cid:31) \n \n \n \n \n          following action: \n          Approve $250,000 (federal funds) pending enactment of   \n          legislation in accordance with the provisions of SB 505.    \n          Should the legislation fail to be enacted, the $250,000 is   \n          be used for the purposes of the SDE/CYA Interagency   \nhttp://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/01-02/bill/sen/sb_0501-0550/sb_505_cfa_20010514_154832_sen_comm.html 11/13/2006\n\nSB 505 Senate Bill - Bill Analysis Page 2of 2\n          Agreement.

Maj.  op.  at lyze, the  possible  broader  implications  of  the judge's  order.\n10797. Because the INS's statement of reasons for the limited This issue needs to be  clarified.\ndetention  policy  are  concerns  that  the  Supreme  Court  has\nalready  found  legitimate,  this  is additional  evidence  that  the The  district  judge  held  that  \"la]ny  minor  taken  into\nchallenged  regulation  is reasonable. custody\" shall  be given  \"an administrative  hearing  to deter-\nmine probable cause for his arrest.\" Under current INS proce-\nIll dures, minors arrested  without a warrant  are entitled to have\nprobable cause reviewed  by an immigration official  \"without\nIn the final section of the opinion, the majority  upholds the unnecessary  delay.\" See 8 U.S.C. ยง 1357(a)(2). Because  this\nprocedure existed prior to the Flares  litigation, the panel spec-\ndistrict judge's ruling that a minor taken into custody must be\n\n10842 v.\nulated that the district judge intended to impose an additional\nrequirement that the probable cause hearing take place  before\nan  immigration  judge.  Otherwise,  the  majority  pointed  out\nthat \"the  injunction  [would  be] deprive[d] of  much  practical\neffect.\"  Flares,  slip op. at  10798.\nBy holding that the judge's order will not materially  affect\nINS  procedures,  the  majority  implicitly  rejects  the  panel's\noriginal  assumption  and  holds instead  that  the current  arrest\nand  probable  cause  requirements  satisfy  the  judge's  order.\nAny other interpretation  of the order is inconsistent  with  the\nmajority's  refusal  to  engage  in  any  due  process  analysis.\nTherefore, despite the broad language of the judge's order, the\nmajority's  affirmance  of  that  order  should  not  be  read  to\nrequire any change  in these  procedures.\nI also do not read  the majority's  opinion  as imposing  any\nadditional  requirements  on  the  INS  in  terms  of  timing  and\nexecution  of the detention  hearings. The  majority  references\nthe current  hearing  procedures  as  adequate  to safeguard  the\ninterests of the minors. See maj. op. at 10K02. Therefore, with\nthe exception  of the  new  requirement  that  such  hearings  be\nheld  automatically,  the  majority  opinion  does  not entail  any\nalteration  in current  INS  procedure.\nThe  procedural  component  of  the district judge's  order  is\npotentially  quite  sweeping.  For  this  reason,  1 adhere  to  my\noriginal position, as stated  in the panel majority  opinion, that\nwe should remand the case tor a determination of what proce-\ndures  are  constitutionally  required  under  Muthews  v.\nEldridne.  424 U.S. 319 (1976). .SV<- h'lores. slip op. at  10797-\nK02 (discussing  appropriate  lest  lor  procedural  due  process\nanalysis).",

The lawsuit was brought by a\nyouth confined at CYA on behalf of himself and all other youth at\n15\nCYA in similar situations.  The lawsuit claims that CYA fails to\n16 jj\nidentify youth who need special education. It also claims that\n17! CYA does not give these youth adequate programs to meet their\n18 jj\nneeds.  CYA denied that these claims were true.\nOn \\ \\  , 1990 a proposed settlement of this lawsuit\n20  โข\nwas filed with the federal court.  The court is going to decide\n21  jj\nwhether this proposed settlement should become a final order of\nthe court.  The settlement will not become final until wards at\nji\n23  j\nCYA have a chance to object in writing.  The purpose of this\nil\n24  !!\nnotice is to summarize the proposed settlement and to explain how\n25\nresidents of CYA may let the court know if they have any\n26\nobjections.\n1\n\n'โข I.  Summary of the Settlement\n;l\n2 i[  A full copy of the proposed settlement is availab:  at each\nii\n2 'โข'โข CYA institution.  Generally, the proposed  settlement  includes the\nij\n ;j following terms:\n4\n5 i; ii โข โข\n. ij  1. The settlement  applies to all residents  (we rds) of CYA\n ij who are \"educationally  handicapped\" or who are \"individuals  with\n7\n jj exceptional  needs\".  These aire legal terms with  specific\n8\n jj meanings.  In general, if you are a resident of CYA and you have\n9\na  learning  disability, a serious emotional problem, a speech or\n10\nvision problem, a health  impairment, a physical or mental\n11\nhandicap, or some  other similar problem  that hinders  your  ability\n12\ni!\n ij to learn, then you are probably  part of the group of youth  this\n13\nji\n ! lawsuit will affect.  This group of CYA residents is called a\n14\n,r ! \"class\" in the settlement.  The word \"class\" will be used in the\ni\n  jj rest  of  this  notice.\n16\n17 ii\n jj  2. CYA agrees that all class members have a right to\n18\nII\n I! special education and related services.\n19 i!\n20 :;\n jj  3. CYA agrees to promptly identify all wards who may need\n?1\nspecial education services.\n22\ni\n23 i\n4.  CYA agrees to fully assess the educational needs of\n24\neveryone who is or may be a class member.\n25\n26\n\n5.  For all class members, CYA agrees to*develop an\n1  ii\n,1 Individual Education Program (an IEP) that will explain what\n2  :\nprograms or services the ward needs.\n3  i\n4  ','\n6.  CYA agrees to provide each class member with the special\n5  ;;\neducation and related services described in the IEP.  \"Related\n6  ;\nservices\" include such things as speech and hearing services,\n  Ii\n7\nphysical and occupational therapy, psychological and counseling\n8  I\ni\nservices, and other supportive services needed to help class\n9\nmembers benefit from special education.\n10\n111\n7.  CYA agrees that it will hire or contract with as many\n12 ii\nteachers or other people as needed so that all class members get\n13\nthe special education and related services that they need.\n14  ;|\nii\n15\n!\n8.  CYA agrees to follow all procedural requirements to\n16 ii\n17ii protect the legal rights of class members and their parents.\n  I\n18  i:\n\"I\n9.  The settlement sets up a system to make sure that CYA\ndoes everything that they agreed to.\n20  j!\n21 jj\n22 I 10.  The settlement will be in effect for three years.  It\ni\nmay be extended if CYA does not do what it agreed to.\n23  i\n24\n11.  The Court can give the lawyers for the boy who sued CYA\n25\nattorneys' fees for the work that they did on this lawsuit.\n26\n\nIf you have any questions about this settlement you may ask to\nsee a copy of the full settlement at CYA.

Maj. op. at  10796.\nAs stated earlier, I do not agree that the  INS regulation  at\nissue here violates substantive due process. 1 therefore cannot\nThus, 1 believe that the Supreme Court's rulings regarding\nthe diminished  liberty interests of minors should  be  factored join  in  the  majority's  imposition  of  these  new  procedural\ninto our constitutional analysis.

However, the majority's analysis is problematic\nasserting that there is \"no legal bijsis\" for the INS's  professed for a second reason โ it fails to acknowledge, much less ana-\nconcern  for  the  best  interests  of .alien  minors.

Because the INS's statement of reasons for the limited This issue needs to be  clarified.\ndetention  policy  are  concerns  that  the  Supreme  Court  has\nalready  found  legitimate,  this  is additional  evidence  that  the The  district  judge  held  that  \"la]ny  minor  taken  into\nchallenged  regulation  is reasonable. custody\" shall  be given  \"an administrative  hearing  to deter-\nmine probable cause for his arrest.\" Under current INS proce-\nIll dures, minors arrested  without a warrant  are entitled to have\nprobable cause reviewed  by an immigration official  \"without\nIn the final section of the opinion, the majority  upholds the unnecessary  delay.\" See 8 U.S.C. ยง 1357(a)(2). Because  this\nprocedure existed prior to the Flares  litigation, the panel spec-\ndistrict judge's ruling that a minor taken into custody must be\n\n10842 v.\nulated that the district judge intended to impose an additional\nrequirement that the probable cause hearing take place  before\nan  immigration  judge.  Otherwise,  the  majority  pointed  out\nthat \"the  injunction  [would  be] deprive[d] of  much  practical\neffect.\"  Flares,  slip op. at  10798.\nBy holding that the judge's order will not materially  affect\nINS  procedures,  the  majority  implicitly  rejects  the  panel's\noriginal  assumption  and  holds instead  that  the current  arrest\nand  probable  cause  requirements  satisfy  the  judge's  order.\nAny other interpretation  of the order is inconsistent  with  the\nmajority's  refusal  to  engage  in  any  due  process  analysis.\nTherefore, despite the broad language of the judge's order, the\nmajority's  affirmance  of  that  order  should  not  be  read  to\nrequire any change  in these  procedures.\nI also do not read  the majority's  opinion  as imposing  any\nadditional  requirements  on  the  INS  in  terms  of  timing  and\nexecution  of the detention  hearings. The  majority  references\nthe current  hearing  procedures  as  adequate  to safeguard  the\ninterests of the minors. See maj. op. at 10K02.

INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT\n24\n1.  This is a civil rights class action challenging the\nfailure of the defendants to provide appropriate special\n\neducation and related services to youth confined at the Northern\nReception Center - Clinic (NRCC) of the California Youth\nAuthority  (CYA).  Plaintiff brings this action for declaratory,\n  injunctive, and other equitable relief on behalf of himself and\n4\nc ' all other handicapped youth confined at NRCC.\n2.  This action is brought to redress defendants'\nviolations of federal constitutional and statutory rights.  This\naction is brought pursuant to the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.\nยง1983, the Education of the Handicapped Act  (ERA), 20 U.S.C.\nin  ยงยง1401 et seq. and its implementing regulations at 34 C.F.R.\nยงยง300 et sea.. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973\n.ยป  (ยง504), 29 U.S.C. ยง794 and its implementing regulations at 34\nC.F.R. ยงยง104 et seq.; and the due process and equal protection\nclauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\n14\nConstitution.\n16\nII.  JURISDICTION\n17\n3.  This court has jurisdiction of this action under 28\n18\nU.S.C. ยง1343(3), this being an action to redress the deprivation,\n19\nunder color of state law, of rights secured by the Constitution\n20\nof the United States; the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง1983,\n21\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation of 1973, 29 U.S.C. ยง794; and\nthe Education of the Handicapped Act, 20 U.S.C. ยงยง1401 et seq.\n22\n23\n4.  This court also has jurisdiction of this action under\n24\n28 U.S.C. ยง1343(4), this being an action to secure declaratory,\n25\ninjunctive, and other equitable relief under acts of Congress\n26\n\n2  providing for the protection of civil rights, specifically the\n  Civil Rights Act, ยง504, and the EHA.\n2\n3  5.  This court also has jurisdiction of this action under\n  28 U.S.C. ยง1331, this being a civil action arising under the\n4\nConstitution and laws of the United States.\n6\n  III.  PLAINTIFF\n7\n6.  Plaintiff NICK 0. is 15 years old and a citizen of the\n  United States.  Since April 3, 1989, he has been confined at the\n9\nNorthern Reception Center - Clinic of the California Youth\n10\nAuthority in Sacramento, California.  Prior to his incarceration,\n11\nhe resided in San Mateo County, California.\n12\n7.  Plaintiff brings this action by and through his mother\n13\nand Next Friend, JANE O.  At all relevant times, JANE O. has\n14\nresided in San Mateo County, California.\n15\n8.  Plaintiff brings this action under a pseudonym in order\n16\nto preserve confidentiality and protect himself from harassment\n17\nand humiliation.\n18\n19\nIV.  DEFENDANTS\n20\n9.  Defendant C.A. TERHUNE is the Director of the CYA.  As\n21\nsuch, he is responsible for the care and treatment of wards\n22\nconfined in institutions and facilities operated by the CYA.  As\n23\nDirector, defendant Terhune is responsible for ensuring that\n24\nhandicapped children in the custody of the CYA receive special\n25\neducation and related services as mandated by law.  He is sued in\n26\n\nhis official capacity.\n1\n10. Defendant RICHARD TILLSON is the Superintendent of NRCC.\n2\nIn that capacity, he has direct supervisory responsibility for\n3\nthe operation, management and administration of NRCC.  He is\nA\nresponsible for assuring that handicapped minors at NRCC receive\n5\nj special education and related services mandated by law.  He is\n6\n!sued in his official capacity.\n7\n11.  At all relevant times, the defendants have acted, and\n8\ncontinue to act, under color of state law.\n9\n10\nV.  CLASS ACTION\n11\n12.  Plaintiff brings this action on behalf of himself and\n12\nall other persons similarly situated.  The class consists of all\n13\ncurrent and future residents of NRCC who are educationally\n14\nhandicapped and in need of special education and related\n15\nservices.\n16\n13.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is\n17\nimpracticable.  Each year more than 1,000 youth are admitted to\n18\nNRCC.  The average daily population of NRCC is approximately 350.\n19\nUpon information and belief, at least 25% of the population at\n20\nNRCC is handicapped and entitled to special education and related\n21\nservices.\n22\n14.  In addition, there are questions of law and fact common\n23\nto members of the plaintiff class regarding defendants' policies\n24\nand practices.  These include (a) whether defendants' failure to\n25\nidentify, evaluate, and assess the special educational needs of\n26\n\n1  all handicapped children in a timely manner, and in accord with\n2  procedural safeguards, violates plaintiffs'legal rights, and (b)\n3  whether the defendants' failure to provide handicapped minors at\n4  NRCC with free appropriate special education and related\n5  services, in accord with properly developed individualized\neducation programs  (IEP's), violates plaintiffs' legal rights.\nThe claims of the named plaintiff are typical of the claims of\nthe members of the plaintiff class.\n15.  The named plaintiff and plaintiff's attorneys will\nfairly and adequately protect the interests of the members of the\n,,  class.  Plaintiff knows of no conflict of interest among class\nmembers.  Plaintiff is represented by counsel experienced in\ncivil rights class action litigation.\n13\n16.  By their policies and practices, the defendants have\n14\nacted, and continue to act, on grounds and in a manner generally\n15\napplicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final\n16\ninjunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with\n17\nrespect to the class as a whole.\n18\n17.  The injuries suffered by the named plaintiffs and the\n19\nmembers of the plaintiff class as a result of the policies and\n20\npractices of the defendants are capable of repetition, yet may\n21\nevade review, thereby making class relief appropriate.\n22\n23\nVI.  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\n24\n18.  The CYA operates 11 institutions and 6 camps throughout\n25\nCalifornia.  Youth are committed to the custody of CYA by\n26\n\n1 Juvenile and Superior Courts in the counties.\n2 19.  Two of the 11 institutions operated by the CYA (NRCC\n3 and the Southern Reception Center - Clinic) are diagnostic and\n4 assessment units for youth prior to their placement in CYA\n5 institutions or camps.  All youth committed to CYA for the first\n6 time are initially sent to one of the two Reception Centers.\n7 20.  At the present time, all of the CYA institutions and\n8 camps are significantly overcrowded.  There are between 8,500 and\n9 9,000 youth currently confined in CYA facilities designed to hold\n5,840.\n10\n21.  In previous years, the length of stay for testing and\n11\nassessment at NRCC was approximately 22 to 28 days.  At the\n12\npresent time, due to the overcrowding at the CYA institutions,\n13\nyouth are routinely confined at NRCC in excess of 3 0 days.  Some\n14\nyouth are confined at NRCC for up to six months.\n15\n22.  There is no special education program or related\n16\nservices available for youth confined for evaluation and\n17\nassessment at NRCC.\n18\n23.  The defendants routinely fail to identify and assess\n19\nspecial educational needs, properly develop individualized\n20\neducation plans.\n21\n24.  Defendents fail to properly implement individualized\n22\neducation plans and provide special education and related\n23\nservices to handicapped youth in a timely fashion.\n24\n25 25.  Since April 3, 1989, NICK. O. has been confined at\n26 NRCC\n\n1  26.  NICK O. has a long history of placement in special\n2  education programs.  In 1981, when he was eight years old and in\n3  the third grade, NICK 0. was certified as eligible for special\n  education by the San Francisco Unified School District.  He was\n4\n  classified as seriously emotionally disturbed  (SED).  An IEP\n5\n  : describing his special educational needs was developed.  For the\n6\n  next several years NICK 0. was continually identified as eligible\n7\nfor special education.  In 1987, his family moved to San Mateo\n  County and NICK 0. began receiving special education services\n9\n  there.  In 1988, NICK 0. was confined in Hillcrest Juvenile Hall\n10\nand Camp Glenwood in San Mateo, and a new IEP was developed on\n  March 21, 1988.\n12\n27.  NICK 0.'s academic functioning is severely delayed.\n  Also, his emotional problems interfere with his ability to\n14\nbenefit from an education.  He has been classified as seriously\n.,  emotionally disturbed since 1981.  NICK 0. is handicapped within\nthe meaning of the EHA and ยง504.\n  28.  Since his confinement at NRCC, the defendants have\n1O\nid\nfailed to provide NICK O. any special education and related\nservices designed to meet his needs.  The defendants have not\ndeveloped an IEP for NICK O.  Upon information and belief, no IEP\nplanning conference for NICK O. has been scheduled or held.  NICK\nO. 's mother has not been notified about any IEP planning\nconference at NRCC and has not attended any such conference.\n24\n29.  NRCC personnel have not implemented any IEP's or other\neducational plans for NICK O. from any of his prior schools of\n\n2  attendance.  As a result, NICK O. has not had continuity in his\n2 ij special educational program.\n3  30.  Since NICK 0. has been at NRCC, neither NICK O. nor his\n  mother have been informed about the rights of handicapped\nA\n^  children to procedural safeguards and a free appropriate public\n  education.\n6\n  31.  Defendants know or should know that their actions,\n7\n  omissions, policies and practices fail to comply with the\n8\n  requirements of federal law.  Pursuant to Cal. Educ. Code ยง56475,\n9\nJQ  the CYA has a longstanding interagency agreement with the\n,,  California Superintendent of Public Instruction to provide\n,_  special education and related services to individuals with\n  exceptional needs as mandated by federal and state law.  The CYA\n13\nis a \"local education agency\" as that term is used in 2 0 U.S.C.\nยง1401(8) and a \"public agency\" as that term is used in 34 C.F.R.\nยงยง300.2 and 300.11.\nlo\n32.  In October, 1986, in response to an administrative\ncomplaint, the Office for Civil Rights of the United States\nDepartment of Education found the CYA in violation of federal law\nfor its failure to properly identify educationally handicapped\nyouth or to provide special education and related services at the\nSouthern Reception Center - Clinic.  The California State\n22\nDepartment of Education made a similar finding in May, 1986.  In\n23\nresponse to these findings, the CYA agreed to take remedial\n24\naction at both the Southern Reception Center - Clinic and NRCC.\n33.  In November, 1988, the California State Department of\n8\n\nEducation conducted a compliance review of NRCC and cited the\n1\ndefendants for multiple violations of their legal obligation to\n2\nprovide special educational services, including failure to\n3\ndevelop and write assessment plans in a timely manner, in\n4\nviolation of 34 C.F.R. ยงยง300.530-534, 543; failure to develop\n5\n! proper IEP's in a timely manner, in violation of 34 C.F.R. ยงยง343,\n6\n346; and failure to provide appropriate special education and\n7\nrelated services to eligible youth at NRCC, in violation of 34\n8\nC.F.R. ยงยง300.1 et seq.\n9\n34.  Exhaustion of any administrative remedies would be\n10\nfutile in this matter.  Plaintiffs allege that defendants\n11\nroutinely fail to provide required procedural safeguards in a\n12\ntimely manner and fail to provide any special education program\n13\nor related services at NRCC.\n14\nVII.  LEGAL CLAIMS\n15\n35.  For plaintiff's legal claims, they reallege paragraphs\n16\n1 through 34 above, as is fully set forth herein, and further\n17\nallege:\n18\nFIRST CLAIM\n19\n36.
