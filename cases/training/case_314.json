      "title": "Correspondence re: Broward Regional Juvenile Detention Center (Data Evaluation",
      "text": "G.C. v. Coler\nIlllllI\nJI-FL-004-00\nApril  19,  1991\nIra Schwartz\nProfessor and Director .\nCenter For The Study of Youth Policy\nSocial Work Center Building\n1015 East Huron Street\nAnn Arbor, Michigan 48104-1689\nDear Ira:\nIn my attempt to collect data for this topic, I was amazed\nat the limited amount of evaluation data collected by HRS.\nNot only is limited information kept but any request for\ninformation over five years old is impossible to retrieve,\nif kept at all.\nThe thrust of this project was to determine if there was any\nincrease or reduction in the operating cost of the Broward\nRegional Juvenile Detention Center as a result of the\nlawsuit, and has the reduction in population resulted in a\nreduction in operating expenses.  Over the past five years,\nwe have seen significant reduction in population of the\ndetention and improvements in the quality of life at the\nfacility.  The most notable cost related improvement is the\nupgrading of the staff.  In 1987, we had six facility\nsupervisors, 16 DCWII, and 48 DCWI positions.  Today we have\nseven facility supervisors, 26 DCWII and 54 DCWI positions\nin addition to two new human services program specialists\n(detention review specialists).  There have been significant\nimprovements in the physical plant.  We have painted the\nentire facility, inside and out, expanded the outside\nrecreation area, improved the number of recreation\nactivities inside the facility, upgraded the nursing\nservices, bought more chairs, new tables for the dining\nhall, installed stainless steel suicide \"proof\" toilets,\ncameras in the holding cells, and many other improvements in\nthe quality of life within the facility.\nIn terms of cost, while we have not seen or just now are\nseeing a reduction in operating expenses, there has not been\na significant increase in the operating cost at the facility\n\nin comparison to other detention centers in the state. (See\nTable I).  In fact, this table shows that District Ten's\ndetention expenditures rose 42% over the FY 86/87 - FY 89/90\nperiod.  Five other districts - without lawsuits - had\ngreater percentage increases in detention expenditures than\nDistrict Ten.  District Five which has one detention center\nwithin the district, experienced a 70% increase in\nexpenditures, and District Nine, which has two centers had a\n105% increase in their expenditures!.  Statewide there was a\n37% increase in detention expenditures.  In 1986/87 District\nTen's cost per resident day was $44, the lowest in the state\nand 11% below the state means of $55, even though we were\nfifth in admissions, and sixth in resident day.  In 1989/90,\nwe were seventh in admissions, eighth in resident day, and\nour cost per resident day was $74.54, 11% above the state's\naverage cost of $67.08; yet two other districts had higher\ncost per day and another district was very close to our\ncost.  Any way you look at it, the expenditures at the\nBroward Regional Juvenile Detention Center were not\nexcessive or out of line with other centers in the state.\n(See Table II)\nWhile improvements in the center's physical plant were\nimportant, the total quality of life issues as well as\npopulation was the principle factor in the lawsuit.\nExamination of the time period during the height of the\nlawsuit (January 1, 1987 through January 31, 1989) shows a\ndaily average population of 168.5 and an average of 318\nadmissions per month.  With the development of detention\nalternatives, a risk screening instrument as well as the\ndevelopment of a facility expeditor's position, we have seen\nthe population decrease to 108.6, during the period\nJanuary 1, 1990 through January 31, 1991.  Admissions were\nreduced from an average of 318 per month to 209 per month.\n(See Table III)  The most significant reduction was in\nbehavior confinements, from 493 during the 87/88 period to\n111 during the 90/91 period.  Only two districts, Dade and\nBroward, had experienced detention population reduction\nduring the 1986/87 - 1989/90 period.  (See Table II)  Dade's\npopulation was reduced by 2.6% from 1986/87, Broward's by\n14%  The reductions we now see in our detention population\nis further evidence of the impact of risk screening\ninstruments and the availability of detention's\nalternatives.  District Ten's home detention program served\nmore clients than any other in the state and certainly\ncontributed to our success.\nData available shows that for the first time in five years,\npossibly longer, the detention center expenditures have\ndecreased, and even if the 90/91 projections are not exact,\n\nat the very least, detention center expenditures have for\nthe first time remained consistant.  (See Table IV)  That in\nfact, is for the first year in three (only period\ninformation is available) detention center allocations had\nbeen reduced.\nToday we have significantly increased the staff at the\ncenter, made substantial improvements in the physical plant,\ndeveloped our programs and enhanced existing programs with\nno disproportionate increase in expenditures, and a\nsignificant reduction in population.\nI would be interested in your comments and look forward to\nhearing from you.\n/Sincerely,\nCarl Sanniti\nDelinquency Program Administrator\nCS/sd\nAttachments\nE-EVALDATA\n\nDETENTION CENTER\nCOST/EXPENDITURES  STATEWIDE\n$50\n$39,904,806\n$40  -\n$37,608,986\n$34,084,0\n0}\n$29,097,\n$30  -\n5-\n$20  -\n$10\n$2,414,895  $2,805,957  $3,309,881  $3.511.504  $3.441.000\n$0\n1986/87  1987/88  1988/89  1989/90  1990/91\nโข  STATEWIDE EXP +  BRO WARD EXP\nTABLE  I\n\nCOST COMPARISON BY DISTRICT\nFY 1986/87  (First Figure)  FY 1989/90  (Second Figure)\nNo. of Clients Resident Cost Per Percentage\nDistrict Centers Expenditures Serviced Davs Resident Davs Increase\n1 1 939,199.33 941 13,745 68.33 22\n1,153,362.14 1199 19,814 58.20\n2 2 1,135,158.18 1534 18,288 62.00 77\n2,010,658.04 2688 21,545 93.32\n3 2 2,467,369.04 2170 38,052 64.00 41\n- 3,476,799.85  - 2650 52,500\n4 2 3,326,733.93 4769 63,573 52.00 46\n4,845,650.96 4843 81,085 59.76\n5 1 1,741,178.04 3031 37,793 46.00 70\n2,965,820.21 3773 49,272 60.19\n6 3 4,043,944.39 5891 80,164 50.00 21\n4,959,965.50 5512 81,671 60.73\n7 3 3,239,184.22 4370 57,816 56.00 42\n4,539,790.21 6603 81,142 56.56\n8 1 1,178,004.23 1267 19,026 61.00 20\n1,422,185.06 1592 22,163 64.17\n9 2 2,024,197.57 4011 55,355 54.00 105\n4068 58,339 71.59\n10 1 2,414,895.30 3644 53,737 44.00 42\n3,511,504.48 2938 47,106 74.54\n11 1 5,554,428.79 5800 82,383 67.00 22\n6,792,285.96 5889 80,232 84.66\nStatewide 20 29,097,293.02 37,057 520,397 55.00 37\n39,904,806.42 41,756 594,869 67.00\nOnly District 10 and 11 show a decrease in the number of clients serviced and residents\ndays.

The School Board's Motion to Dismiss is\naddressed to plaintiff's claims regarding the lack of special education programs for handicapped children as\nrequired by ยง 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. ยง 794 and Public Law No. 94-142, the Education\nfor All Handicapped Children Act, 20 U.S.C. ยง 1401 et seq. (\"EHA\").\n1. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973\nThe School Board moves to dismiss plaintiff's claims under ยง 504 of the Rehabilitation Act on the ground that the\nEHA provides all of the remedies, rights, and procedures which Congress intended to apply to a handicapped\nchild's claim to a free and appropriate public education. The Board argues that under Smith v. Robinson, 468\nU.S. 992, 104 S.Ct. 3457, 82 L.Ed. 2d 746 (1984), a plaintiff who asserts a valid claim under the EHA is barred\nfrom also proceeding under ยง 504. This argument must fail in light of a recent congressional amendment to the\nEHA.\n\n\"The Robinson Court held only that a plaintiff who had prevailed under state law and alleged substantial claims\nunder section 504 and the EAHCA could not recover attorney's fees under the Rehabilitation Act.\" Georgia State\nConference of Branches of NAACP v. State of Georgia, 775 F.2d 1403, 1425 (11th Cir.1985). The Court\nexpressed fear that where ยง 504 added nothing to the substantive rights provided by the EHA, plaintiffs might\ncircumvent the state administrative procedures required under the EHA, be awarded damages where none would\nbe available under the EHA, and, if successful, be awarded attorney's fees. Smith, 468 U.S. 992, 104 S.Ct. 3457,\n82 L.Ed.2d 746.\nThe Smith decision prompted the dismissal of claims brought under ยง 504 when those claims were co-extensive\nwith claims under the EHA. See Georgia Association of Retarded Citizens v. McDaniel, 740 F.2d 902 (11th\nCir.1984)cert. denied469 U.S. 1228, 105 S.Ct. 1228, 84 L.Ed.2d 365 (1985). In response to the courts'\ntreatment of ยง 504, Congress overruled Smith by amending the EHA to provide that\nNothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict or limit the rights, procedures, and remedies\navailable under the Constitution, title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C.A. ยง 790, et\nseq.], or other Federal statutes protecting the rights of handicapped children and youth....\nThe Education for all Handicapped Children Act, as amended Pub.L. No. 99-372 ยงยง 2, 3, August 5, 1986, 100\nStat. 796, 797 [20 U.S.C.A. ยง 1415(f) (West Supp.1987)]. The EHA was also amended to provide for reasonable\nattorney's fees to be awarded to prevailing plaintiffs. 20 U.S.C. ยง 1415(e). Under ยง 1415(f), the administrative\nprocedures set forth in the EHA are to be \"exhausted to the same extent had the action been brought under [the\nEHA].\" Id.\n1095 *1095 The amendment was \"clearly intended to correct Smith's erroneous construction of the original\ncongressional intent.\" Board of Education of East Windsor Regional School v. Diamond, 808 F.2d 987, 994 n. 4\n(3d Cir.1986). \"The House Committee Report specifically states:\nIn sum, since 1978, it has been Congress' intent to permit parents or guardians to pursue the\nrights of handicapped children through EHA, section 504 and section 1983. Attorneys' fees could\nbe awarded under section 504 (by virtue of section 505) and under section 1983 (by virtue of\nsection 1988). Further, Congress by establishing a comprehensive scheme of procedural\nprotections under EHA (see above) expected that in appropriate situtations these procedures\nwould be used before a parent or guardian filed a law suit.\nCongressional intent was ignored by the U.S. Supreme Court when, on July 5, 1984, it handed\ndown its decision in Smith v. Robinson, 468 U.S. 992, 104 S.Ct. 3457, 82 L.Ed.2d 746 (1984).\nH.R.Rep. No. 296, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 4 (1985).\" Diamond, 808 F.2d at 994 n. 4.\nIt is clear then that plaintiff may assert claims under both ยง 504 and the EHA. Contra Association for Retarded\nCitizens of Alabama v. Teague, 830 F.2d 158, 159 n. 1 (11th Cir.1987) (following Smith v. Robinson, plaintiff may\nnot circumvent EHA remedies by resort to ยง 504 of the Rehabilitation Act). The Eleventh Circuit gave no\nindication that it had considered the amendment to ยง 1415(f) when it decided Teague. This court is bound by the\nCongress' intent and must hold that plaintiffs can proceed under both the EHA and ยง 504. The remaining question\nis whether plaintiff's claims are barred for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.\n2. Exhaustion Requirement\nThe Education of All Handicapped Children Act, 20 U.S.C. ยง 1401 et seq. sets forth a detailed set of procedural\nsafeguards to be followed by the child's parents or guardian and the local or state educational authorities. See 20\nU.S.C. ยง 1415(a), (b). \"A number of courts have characterized the failure of a plaintiff to complete the\nadministrative process as a jurisdictional defect\" which bars suit in the district court. Georgia State Conferences,\n775 F.2d at 1425 n. 36.\n\nThe School Board argues that plaintiff's complaint must be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative\nremedies. Plaintiff contends that the exhaustion requirement may be excused where exhaustion of administrative\nremedies would be futile. The Eleventh Circuit has noted \"that futility of exhaustion has been accepted as a valid\nground for pursuing EACHA claims directly in the district court....\" Id. (citations omitted). The Eleventh Circuit\nrecently re-considered the exhaustion doctrine in an action under the EHA. Association for Retarded Citizens of\nAlabama Inc. v. Teague, 830 F.2d 158 (11th Cir.1987).\nIn Teague, plaintiffs filed suit on behalf of not less than 6000 handicapped children who had been students in the\nAlabama public school system from 1979 to 1986. The complaint alleged that the defendant violated the EHA by\nfailing to provide handicapped children with the \"free appropriate public education\" called for by the EHA.\nPlaintiffs had not exhausted available administrative remedies and alleged that to do so would have been futile.\nThe district court granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment on the ground that plaintiffs failed to\npresent a good reason for not exhausting the available state administrative procedures.\nThe Eleventh Circuit affirmed the summary judgment. In doing so, the court rejected plaintiff's argument that the\nstate was \"unprepared to handle thousands of individual administrative hearings.\" The court noted that there was\n\"no indication that the disposition of a few representative claims would not satisfactorily resolve plaintiffs'\ncomplaint.\" Id. at 161-62. The court went on to say that \"[i]f after a few such individualized state hearings it\n1096 becomes clear that the state processes are overloaded or ineffectual, a federal court *1096 action seeking relief\nunder the EHA would then be appropriate.\" Id.\nUnder Teague, plaintiff must also show that the state procedures are inadequate or that resort to administrative\nprocedures would cause irreparable harm. Id. at 161. Plaintiff's complaint as it stands fails to allege that the state\nprocedures are inadequate or that resort to the procedures would cause irreparable harm. Accordingly, it is\nhereby\nORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the Motion to Dismiss of the defendant Broward County School Board be and\nthe same is GRANTED. Plaintiff shall have ten (10) days from the date of this Order to file a Second Amended\nComplaint which properly alleges either compliance with the procedures set forth in the EHA or the futility of such\ncompliance.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
