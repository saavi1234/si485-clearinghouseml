Plaintiff, along with 3 others, brought suit in forma paupris on behalf of themselves and all those similarly situated, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the Department of Education and the Department of Corrections for failure to provide special education and related services to all eligible youths confined in Maryland's ten adult correctional facilities. The class was later represented by the Public Justice Center, Inc. Specifically the suit alleges a violation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1401 et seq., (\"IDEA\"), which provides for special education for all mentally disabled or impaired children, ages three to twenty-one. </p><p>On August 2, 1991, the Court (Judge John R. Hargrove) referred the case to Magistrate Judge Catherine C. Blake for hearing and determination of all non-dispositive pretrial matters. On September 18, 1991 the case was temporarily reassigned to Judge Benson E. Legg, and then back to Judge Hargrove on October 23, 1991. On December 9, 1991, the Court (Judge Hargrove) again referred the case to Magistrate Judge Blake for other proceeding, specifically protective orders.</p><p>On June 9, 1993 the United States District Court for the District of Maryland issued a Stipulation of Dismissal Without Prejudice on Conditions. The Stipulation named Dr. Osa D. Coffey as the Implementation Coordinator (monitor) and George L. Russell, Jr., Esq., as the Arbitrator. The Court awarded fees and costs to plaintiffs' counsel. A jointly written Action Plan was attached to the Stipulation, and the court retained jurisdiction over the case for further enforcement until the plan had been fully implemented.</p><p>The Action Plan called for mandatory, timely screening of all age-eligible prisoners for possible special education needs, through intake interviews and educational and medical tests. After parents have been notified, and their input sought, Individual Education Programs are to be developed for all eligible prisoners. Prisoners in special units are to receive a minimum of six hours per week of educational services. Finally, the Action Plan called for in-service training of all state employees connected with the special education of inmates to apprise them of the changes.</p><p>On June 6, 1995, the Court (Judge Hargrove) Dismissed the case without prejudice.</p><p></p>",

Copies  of  any  identification of  privileged \ndocuments  provided  to the  Implementation  Coordinator \npursuant  to Paragraph  8. \nThe  parties  recognize  that the process  of  providing documents  to \nthe  Implementation Coordinator  and  the  Plaintiffs'  counsel  pursuant \nto Paragraphs  8  and  9  will proceed  informally.  The  parties will \nwork  in good  faith to provide  Plaintiffs'  counsel with reasonable  โข \naccess  to the documentary  support  for  the  Implementation \nCoordinator's conclusions  and  recommendations  while avoiding \nplacing undue  burdens  to produce documents  on  the Defendants.  The \nparties will  seek to resolve  informally  any  disputes  over  access  to \ndocuments  before submitting  any  such disputes  to the Court. \n10.  The  Implementation  Coordinator  shall monitor Defendants' \nimplementation  of  each term  of  the Action  Plan  and  shall conduct \nfour  (4)  quarterly reviews  of  Defendants'  compliance with  those \nterms.

If Defendants  state in writing that they \nintend  to cure,  then,  in  the quarter  following  such \nstatement,  the  Implementation Coordinator  shall make  a \nspecific written  finding  as  to whether  Defendants  have \n- 7  -\n\ntaken  sUbstantial  steps  to do  so.  If  the \nImplementation Coordinator  finds  that Defendants  have \nnot  taken  sUbstantial  steps to cure,  then Plaintiffs \nmay,  within  fifteen  (15)  days  of  receipt of  the \nImplementation  Coordinator's written finding,  file a \nstatement of  Position with,  and  submit  the dispute to, \nthe Arbitrator  as  set forth  in Paragraphs  18  through \n21. \n15.

Nothing  in \nthis Dismissal  shall preclude the parties from  negotiating a \nsettlement to any  dispute  in good  faith,  without resort to \narbitration. \nARBITRATION \n17.  ~he parties agree  that George  L.

As  part of  his/her decision,  the Arbitrator  shall \ndetermine  which  party has  prevailed on  each  issue and  shall  assess \nthe  costs  of  arbitration against  the  non-prevailing party.  The \nArbitrator shall apportion the costs  if he/she  determines  that a \nparty has  prevailed on  some  issues  and  not  others.' \n18.  The  parties agree that the Arbitrator's authority  is \nlimited  strictly to determining whether  Defendants  have  implemented \nthe Action  Plan.  The  Arbitrator shall  not construe  or  interpret \nfederal  or state law,  including but not  limited to the Individuals \nwith  Disabilities Education Act,  20  U.S.C.  SS  1401  et seq.,  as  a \nbasis  for  decision.

The  Arbitrator should consider the  testimony  and  reports \nof  the  Implementation  Coordinator,  but  the Arbitrator  shall  not  be \nbound  to accept  any  finding,  conclusion or recommendation  of  the \nImplementation  Coordinator.  In  rendering  a  decision,  the \nArbitrator also may  take  into account  the  state's fiscal \nconstraints,  although  the parties agree  that such  constraints  alone \nwill  not  justify a  failure to  implement  the Action  Plan. \n21.  The  Arbitrator will  issue  a  written decision within thirty \n(30)  days  after the conclusion of  the hearing.  The  decision of  the \nArbitrator  shall be  binding upon  the parties. \n22.

Hargrove \nUnited  states District Judge \nLFH9217 \n- 13  -\n\nMARYLAND  CORRECTIONAL  SPECIAL  EDUCATION  ACTION  PLAN \nA.  Introduction and Definitions \n1.  This Action  Plan prescribes the  steps the Maryland  State \nDepartment  of  Education,  Correctional  Education  Off ice  and  the \nMaryland  Department  of  Public  Safety  and  Correctional  Services \nhave  taken  or  will  take  to  enhance  the  programs  and  services \nprovided  to  prisoners  with  educational  disabilities  confined  in \nMaryland's  Adult  correctional  Facilities.  Except  where \nspecified,  the  specific  terms  of  this  Action  Plan  are  not \nnecessarily  required  by  the  Individuals  with  Disabilities \nEducation  Act,  20  U.S.C.  ยงยง  1401  et seq.  (\"IDEA\")  or  by  Maryland \nState  law.  Nothing  in  this  Action  Plan  is  intended  to  abrogate \nor  restrict  any  rights,  remedies  or  obligations  such  prisoners \n/ \n\\ \nhave  under  federal  or state law. \n2.  This  Action  Plan  is  adopted  in  conjunction  with  the \nstipulated  Dismissal  on  Conditions  filed  in Melvin  C.,  et  al.  v. \nShilling,  et  al.,  C.A.  No.  HAR-91-497  (United  states  District \nCourt  f,or  the  District  of  Maryland),  to  resolve  the  issues \npresented  in that  lawsuit without  further  litigation.  Nothing  in \nthis  Action  Plan  shall  be  construed  as  an  admission  of  liability \nby  any  party to  that suit. \n3.  Maryland's  correctional  special  education  programs \ncurrently  .are  operated  by  the  Maryland  state  Department  of \nEducation,  correctional  Education  Office  (\"MSDE\")  with  the \ncooperation  and  assistance  of  the  Maryland  state  Department  of \n\nPublic  Safety  and  Correctional  Services  (\"DPSCS\").  In  the  event \n( \nthat  MSDE  transfers  part  or  all  of  its  responsibility  for  the \ncorrectional  special  education  programs  to  DPSCS,  DPSCS  shall  be \nbound  by  this  Action  Plan  to  the  same  extent  as  MSDE  would  have \nbeen  bound  had  MSDE  retained responsibility  for ยทthe  programs. \n4.  The  terms  \"Maryland  Adult  Correctional  Facilities\"  and \n\"Adult  Correctional  Facility\" as used  throughout  this Action  Plan \nrefer  to  all  correctional  facilities  and  institutions  for \nsentenced  individuals  operated  by  the  Maryland  Department  of \nPublic  Safety  and  Correctional  Services,  including,  but  not \nlimited  to,  the  Patuxent  Institution  and  all  Division  of \nCorrection  facilities,  including  Pre-Release  units  and  the \nReception,  Diagnostic  and  Classification Center  (\"RDCC\"). \n5.  The  term  \"Maryland  Adult  Correctional  Intake  Facility\" \n( \nas  used  throughout  this Action  Plan  refers  to'all  facilities  and \ninstitutions used  for  the  intake or screening of  prisoners  by  the \nMaryland  Department  of  Public  Safety  and  Correctional  Services, \nincluding,  but  not  limited  to  RDCC,  the  Maryland  Correctional \nInstitution  for  Women,  and  any  other  intake  facility  that may  be \nestablished  in the  future. \n6.  The  term  \"prisoner\"  or \"student\"  as  used  throughout  this \nAction  Plan  will  mean  any  individual  who  is  not  a  high  school \ngraduate  and  does  not  possess  the  equivalent  of  a  high  school \ndiploma,  wh.o  is  under  the  age  of  twenty-oneยท (21)  years,  and  who \nis  incarcerated  in a  Maryland  Adult Correctional  Facility. \n- 2  -\n\nB.  Identification,  Screening,  Referral and Assessment \n1.  All  prisoners  will  be  screened  for  possible  special \neducation  eligibility through  an  intake  interview and  educational \nand  medical  tests  which  will  be  administered  upon  a  prison~r's \nentry to the system.  Absent  extraordinary circumstances  relating \nto  individual  inmates,  within  twenty-one  (21)  days  after  each \nprisoner's  arrival  at  a  Maryland  Adult  Correctional  Intake \nFacility,  MSDE  and/or  DPSCS  will  conduct  the  intake  interview, \nadminister  educational  screeningยทtests,  and  review the results of \nthe  interview  and  educational  tests  to  identify  those  prisoners \nwith  a  history  of  special  education  services  and/or  with \nindicators  of  special  education  eligibility.  The  interview  and \neducational  screening  tests  will  be  administered  and  reviewed  by \nstaff  with  specific  training  designed  to  enable  them  to  perform \nthose  functions.  DPSCS  also will  conduct medical  screening  tests \n(hearing,  vision  and  general  physical  condition)  upon  a \nprisoner's entry into the  system. \n2.  with  respect  to  any  prisoner  for  whom  the  intake \ninterview  indicates that the prisoner previously received  special \neducation  and/or  related  services,  within  five  (5)  working  days \nof  receipt  of  that  information,  MSDE  will request the  prisoner's \nprior  special  education  records,  including  but  not  limited  to \nprior  IEPs,  evaluations  and  assessments,  and  any  reports \nindicating.Qr  regarding  stUdent  progress  in  fulfilling  the  goals \nand  obj ectiv  es  of  the  IEPs.  When  received,  MSDE  will  forward \nthose  records  to  the  MSDE  staff  at  the  prisoner's  maintaining \n- 3  -\n\ninstitution.  In  implementing  this  provision,  MSDE  will  use  the \nfollowing  procedures: \na.  In  every  instance  in  which  the  intake \ninterview  reveals  an  indication  of  prior  special \neducation  eligibility,  MSDE  will  make  both'a  telephone \nand  a  written request  for  records to the  school  system; \nb.  In  every  instance  in  which  MSDE  does  not \nreceive  a  def init iv e  response  to  the  initial  requests \nwithin  fifteen  (15)  days,  MSDE  will  make  appropriate \nfollow-up  contact(s)  by  telephone  or  in  writing  to \nobtain,  if possible,  a  definitive response; \nc.  For  students  whose  last  known  school  was \nwithin  a  Maryland  school  system,  MSDE  will  make  the \ninitial request  to the specific  individual whom  MSDE  has \nidentified  as  the  contact  person  for  the  particular \nschool  system; \nd.  For  students  from  school  systems, \nout-of~state \nthe  same  initial and,  if needed,  follow-up  requests will \nbe  m,ade  to  the out-of-state school  system; \ne.  If  MSDE  is  not  able  to  obtain  the  student's \nY \nprior  educational  records  but  is  able  to  obtain  other \nrelevant  information  about  the  prisoner's  prior  special \neducational  placement,  that  information  will  be \ncommunicated  promptly  to  the  MSDE  staff  at  the \nprisoner's  maintaining  institution  and  will  be  recorded \nin the prisoner's education  file;  and \n- 4  -\n\nf.  MSDE  will  maintain  records  of  all  ,contacts \nmade  in  an  attempt  to  obtain prior  educational  records, \nand  that  information  will  be  transferred  to  the \nprisoner's  educational  file  once  all  efforts  to  obtain \nthe prior records  are  completed. \n3.  MSDE  will  develop  and  implement  a  tracking  protocol (s) \nor  formes)  designed  to  ensure  that  the  procedures  set  out  in \n11  B.1  and  B.2  of this Action  Plan are  implemented. \n4.  If  the  information  gathered  under!  B.2  above  indicates \nthat  the  prisoner  was  previously  placed  in  a  special  education \nprogram,  then  upon  transfer  to  the  prisoner's  maintaining \nfacility,  that  prisoner  (A)  will  be  referred  promptly  to  the \nAdmission-Review-Dismissal  (ARO)  Committee  for  appropriate  action \nand  (B)  will  be  placed,  within  ten  (10)  working  days  after \narrival at the maintaining  institution,  in an  interim educational \nprogram  as  follows: \na.  Each  prisoner  who  was  the  subject  of  an \nindividualized  education  program  (IEP)  developed  by  a \nschool,  local education agency  (LEA),  or  other qualified \nagency  within  one  (1)  year  prior  to  the  prisoner's most \nrecent  arrest  will  be  placed  in  a  comparable  special \neducation  program  for  a  period  up  to  sixty  (60)  days \nwhile  the  ARD  Committee  assesses  the  prisoner,  and,  if \nappropz:i,ate,  develops  a  new  IEP  for  the  prisoner.  The \nprisoner's  exisitng  IEP  will  be  implemented  on  an \ninterim  basis  by  the  school  officials  to  the  extent \n- 5  -\n\nfeasible  and  appropriate,  without  referral  to  the  ARD \nCommittee,  unless  (a)  there  is  specific  information  or \nreason(s)  which  would  make  such  placement  infeasible \nand/or  inappropriate,  or  (b)  MSDE  has  been  unable  after \ndiligent  effort  to  obtain  the  IEP  from  the  education \nagency  that  developed  it.  In  a  case  in  which  interim \nimplementation  is  determined  not  to  be  feasible  and/or \nappropriate,  the  specific  information  or  reason(s)  will \nbe  documented  in  the  prisoner's  education  file  and  the \nprisoner will  be  placed  in a  regular education program. \nb.  Each  prisoner  who  was  the  subject  of  an  IEP \ndeveloped  by  a  school,  LEA,  or  other  qualified  agency \nmore  than  one  (1)  year  prior  to  the  prisoner's  most \nrecent  arrest  will  be  placed  in  a  regular  education \nprogram  for  a  period up  to sixty  (60)  days  while  the ARD \ncommittee  assesses  the  prisoner  and,  if  appropriate, \ndevelops  a  new  IEP  for  the prisoner. \n5.  Each  month,  DPSCS  will  provide  to  the  principal  or \neducati.onal  supervisor  at  each  Maryland  Adult  correctional \nFacโข1  l1โข  t'yf    a  list  of  all  prisoners  under  twenty-one  (21)  years  of \nage  then  incarcerated  in  that  Facility.  MSDE  will  ensure  that \nthese  lists  are  reviewed  to  identify  any  prisoner  who  has  not \npreviously  been  screened  for  special  education  eligibility  and \nwho  may  be.  .eligible.  Any  prisoner so  identified will  be  screened \nfor  eligibility using  techniques  consistent with this Action  Plan \nwithin  thirty  (30)  days  following  such  identification. \n- 6  -\n\n,., \n6.  within  six  months  after  the  effective  date  of  this \nAction  Plan,  MSDE  will  ensure  that  any  prisoner  who  entered  the \nMaryland  Adult  Correctional  System  before  June  1,  1991,  who \ncurrently  is under  twenty-one  (21)  years  of  age,  and  who  is not  a \nhigh  school  graduate  and  does  not  possess  the  equivalent  of  a \nhigh  school  diploma  has  been  screened  for  special  education \neligibility using techniques  consistent with this Action  Plan. \n7.  Upon  assignment  or  transfer  to  a  special  mental  health \nunit,  any  prisoner who  is under  twenty-one  (21)  years  of age,  who \nis not  a  high  school  graduate  and  does  not  possess the  equivalent \nof  a  high  school  diploma,  and  who  is  not  currently  receiving \nspecial  education  or  related  services  shall  be  referred \nautomatically  to  the  ARD  Committee  for  consideration  of  whether \nthe  prisoner  should  be  assessed  for  special  education \neligibility,  unless  the  prisoner  already  has  been  screened  and \nhis/her  educational  condition  has  not  changed  since  that \nscreening. \n8.  within  six  (6)  months  after  the  effective  date  of  this \nAction  .;Plan,  MSDE  will  develop. and  provide  to  all ARD  Committees \na  list\" of  assessment  tools  available  to  such  Committees  for \nassessing  the  existence  and  extent  of  the  various  educational \ndisabilities enumerated  in  the  IDEA  and  state  law. \nC.  Deve10pment and Imp1ementation of Individua1ized \nEducation Programs \n1.  In  developing  individualized  education  programs  (IEPs) \nfor  prisoners  with  educational  disabilities,  MSDE  will  ensure \n- 7  -\n\n\" \nthat  the  ARD  committee  will  assess  each  prisoner's  individual \neducational  needs  and  will  develop  IEPs  consistent  with  those \nneeds. \n2.  IEPs  will  include  a  statement  of  the  prisoner's  present \nlevel  of  educational  performance,  a  statement  of  specific  short \nterm  measurable  instructional objectives within  the  capability of \nthe  prisoner,  and  a  statement  of  the  special  education  and \nrelated services to be  provided to the  student. \n3.  If  the  ARD  committee  determines  that  a  prisoner  needs \ncounseling  services,  MSDE  will  ensure  that  the  prisoner  will  be \nprovided  with  counseling  services  that  relate  to  the  prisoner's \nindividual  education  needs  and  that  the  prisoner's  IEP  will \ninclude  a  statement  of  the  type  and  frequency  of  counseling \nservices  to be  provided. \n4.  MSDE  will  include,  in  each  IEP,  a  transition  plan  which \nwill  include  vocational  or  training  services,  where  such \nvocational  or training services are deemed  appropriate by  the ARD \ncommittee. \n5.  MSDE  will  ensure  that  the  goals  and  short-term \ninstruc~ional objectives  of  each  IEP  will  be  reviewed  by  the  ARD \ncommittee  sixty  (60)  days  after  implementation  of  the  IEP  and  at \nleast  annually  thereafter  to  determine  whether  the  goals  and \nobjectives  are  being  met,  whether  specific  services  are  being \nprovided,  and  whether modifications  are  necessary. \n- 8  -\n\nD.  Provision  of  Specia1  Education  Services,  continuum  of \nServices and Re1ated Services \n1.  MSDE  currently  provide's  special  education  and  related \nservices  at most Maryland  Adult  Correctional  Facilities.  Nothing \nin  this  Action  Plan  shall  prevent  MSDE  and  DPSCS  from  modifying \nthe  manner  in  which  services  are  distributed  by  making  certain \nservices  available  to  eligible  prisoners,  specifically  including \nbut  not ,limited  to  modifications  consolidating'services  at  fewer \nlocations  and  transferring  prisoners  eligible  for  those  services \nto  those  locations,  provided  that  such  modifications  do  not \nrelieve  MSDE  or  DPSCS  of  any  obligation  to  locate  eligible \ninmates  and  to  prepare  IEPs  for  eligible  inmates  under  this \nAction  Plan,  including  but  not  limited  to  Parts  Band  C  of  this \nAction  Plan,  and  provided  that  such  modifications  do  not  affect \ninmate  probation,  parole  or  release  dates.  Until  this  Action \nPlan  has  been  implemented  fully,  as  provided  in  the  stipulated \nDismissal  on  Conditions  described  in  ~ A.2  above,  MSDE  and  DPSCS \nshall  not  implement  any  fundamental  change  in  the manner  in which \nspecial  education services  are distributed, without describing  the \nproposed  changes  to  and  consulting  with  plaintiffs'  counsel \n,. \nbefore  the  changes  are to  be  implemented. \n2.  MSDE  will  not  place  any  generalized  maximum  or  limit  on \nthe  amount,  type  or  intensity  of  special  education  and  related \nservices  provided  to  prisoners  with  educational  disabilities. \nMSDE  will  provide  such  services  to prisoners  in  the  amount,  type \nor  intensity specified  in their  rEPs. \n- 9  -\n\n3.  Prisoners  who  are  eligible  to  receive  special  education \nand  related  services  and  who  are  housed  in  a  mental  health  or \nmedical  unit  will  be  provided  adjusted  services  to  account  for \nthe  prisoner's  particular  situation  and  condition.  A  prisoner \nplaced  in  one  of  these  special  units  need  not  receive  special \neducation  and  related  services  if the prisoner  is not  expected  to \nremain  in the  unit  for-more  than ten  (10)  days.  If a  prisoner  is \nexpected  to  remain  in  the  special  unit  for  more  than  ten  (10) \ndays,  MSDE  will  consult  with  the  prisoner's  physician  or  other \nappropriate  health  professional  to  initiate  the  delivery  of \neducational  services.  A  prisoner  in  one  of  these  special  units \nshall  receive  a  minimum  of  six  (6)  hours  per  week  of  educational \nservices,  provided  that  the  prisoner's  physician  or  other  health \nprofessional  agrees  that  the  prisoner's  condition  does  not \nrequire  further  limitations  on  the  quantity  or  type  of \nservices.  If  a  prisoner  is  expected  to  remain  in  the  special \nunit  for  more  than  sixty  (60)  days,  the  ARD  committee  must  meet \nto  review  the  services  being  provided  no  later than  the  sixtieth \nday  of  the  inmate's assignment  to the special unit. \n4. ~  Prisoners  who  are  eligible  for  special  education  and \nrelated  services  and  who  are  placed  in  disciplinary  segregation \nwill  receive  services  as  follows: \na.  A  prisoner  may  spend  up  to  ten  (10)  days  in \nsegregation  without  receiving  any  special  education  or \nrelated services; \n- 10  -\n\nb.  A  prisoner  in  segregation  for  more  than  ten \n(10)  and  up  to  thirty  (30)  days  will  receive  modified \nspecial  education  services,  generally  consisting  of  two \nhours  per  week  of direct  instructional  time  and,  if such \nare  provided  in  the  prisoner's  IEP,  related  services  to \nthe  fullest extent practicable; \nc.  If  a  prisoner  is  expected  to  remain  in \nsegregation  for  more  than  thirty  {3~)  days,  the prisoner \nwill  be  referred  for  scheduling  of  an  ARD  Committee \nmeeting,  to  be  held  no  later  than  forty-five  (45)  days \nafter  the  prisoner's  entry  into  segregation,  to \ndetermine  the  appropriate  services  to be  provided to the \nprisoner while  in segregation; \nd.  MSDE  will  not  impose  any  generalized  maximum \nor  limit  on  the  quantity  of  services  provided  to \nprisoners  who  are  in  segregation  for  more  than  thirty \ndays,  although  security and  other  issues associated \n{3~) \nwith  disciplinary  segregation  will  be  considered  by  the \nARD  Committee  as  factors  in  determining  the  adjustment \nof  quantity  and  type  of  services  provided  to  a \n~the \nprisoner  in segregation  for- more  than thirty  (30)  days. \ne.  In  addi tion  to  the  procedures  set  forth  in \nthis  paragraph,  MSDE  is  currently  exploring  the  use  of \ncomputer  and  other  technology  to  supplement  the  special \neducation  services  offered  to  prisoners  confined  in \nsegregation.  Although  MSDE  will  make  all  efforts  to  do \n- 11  -\n\nso,  it  is  explicitly  agreed  that  a  failure  by  MSDE  to \nidentify  and  utilize  such  technology  in  this  context \nshall  not  constitute  a  failure  to  implement  this  Action \nPlan,  for  which  the  parties  may  invoke  arbitration  as \nprovided  by  Paragraphs  18  through  21  of  the  stipulated \nDismissal  Without  Prejudice on  Conditions. \n5.  Prisoners  classified  to  the  Maryland  Correctional \nAdjustment  Center  (\"Supermax\")  will  be  subject to the  procedures \nconcerning  disciplinary  segregation  above,  including  the \ncircumstances  in which  an  ARD  Committee meeting  is required. \n6.  MSDE  will  ensure  that  all  prisoners  who  are  in  need  of \nIntensity  IV  and  V  special  education  and/or  related  services,  as \ndetermined  by  the  ARD  Committee,  will  receive  those  services, \nsubject to the provisions  of this Action  Plan. \nE.  Procedural Safeguards \n1.  For  each  prisoner  referred  for  assessment  to  the  ARD \nCommittee,  MSDE  will  seek  the  participation  and  involvement  of \nthe  pr isoner ' s  parent ( s)  or  guardian.  or,  where  appropr iate under \napplica15le  law,  a  surrogate  parent.  MSDE  will  establish  the \nfollowing  timetable  for  contacting  parents  or  guardians,  or, \nwhere  appropriate,  appointing  a  surrogate parent: \na.  Within  ten  (10)  days  of  a  referral  to  the ARD \nCommittee,  MSDE  will  prepare  and  mail  to  the prisoner's \nparent(s)  or  guardian  notice  of  the  ARD  Committee \nmeeting.  This  notice  will  include  a  summary  of  the \n- 12  -\n\nparent's  or guardian's  procedural  rights,  instruction on \nhow  to  contact  school  officials  to  arrange  a  mutually \nconvenient  time  and  place  for  the ARD  committee meeting, \nand  information concerning  resources  available to assist \nthe parent or guardian  in the ARD  process; \nb.  If,  within ten  (10)  days  of  the mailing  of  the \nnotice  to the prisoner's parent(s)  or guardian,  MSDE  has \nnot  received  a  response  from  the  parent(s)  or  guardian, \nMSDE  will  attempt  alternative  means  of  contacting  the \nparent(s)  or guardian;  and \nc.  If  a  prisoner's  parent(s)  or  guardian  cannot \nbe  identified or  located or  if the  prisoner  is a  ward  of \nthe  state,  MSDE  will  appoint  a  surrogate  parent  for  the \nprisoner. \n2.  MSDE  will  ensure  that  the  prisoner's  parent(s), \nguardian,  or  surrogate  parent  is  afforded  a  reasonable \nopportunity to be  present  for  each ARD  committee meeting. \n3.  Within  three  months  after  the  effective  date  of  this \nAction  Plan,  MSDE,  with  the  assistance  of  plaintiffs'  cou~sel, \nwill  de~elop a  listing of  resources  available  to provide  parents, \nguardians,  and/or  prisoners  with  information  and  assistance \nconcerning  the  ARD  process.  This  listing  will  include  Parent \nInformation  and  Training centers as  such  are  available  throughout \nthe  state and  legal  and  other advocacy  groups  offering assistance \nto  educationally  disabled  individuals.  MSDE  will  update  this \nlisting  annually.  In  addition  to  notifying  prisoners  and  their \n- 13  -\n\nparents  or  guardians  of  the  availability  of  this  listing  in  the \ninitial notices  of  the ARD  Committee meetings,  MSDE  will maintain \nthe  listing at each  institution school  and  make  it available upon \nrequest. \n4.  Within  thirty  (30)  days  of  the  effective  date  of  this \nAction  Plan,  MSDE,  with  the  assistance  of  Plaintiffs'  counsel, \nwill  develop  a  Notice  that  contains  a  concise  summary  of  inmate \nrights,  remedies  and  responsibilities for  special  education.  The \nNotice  will  be  posted  in  each  correctional  facility  (a)  in  the \nlibrary;  (b)  in the  institution school;  and  (c)  on  the  facility's \ninmate  bulletin  board (s) โข  The  Notice  also  will  be  provided  to \nall  inmates  under  the  age  of  twenty-one  (21)  years  upon  entry \ninto the corrections  system. \n5.  MSDE  will  assign  one  (1)  or  more  persons  to  serve  as \nParent  Coordinator(s).  The  Parent  coordinator(s)  will  ensure \nthat  the  procedural  safeguards  described  in  this Action  Plan  are \nprovided. \nF.  In-Service Training \n1.  within six  (6)  months  before or  six  (6)  months  after the \nT \neffective  date  of  this  Action  Plan,  all employees  in  each  of  the \ngroups  described below  will  have  attended at  least  one  in-service \ntraining program: \na.  All  employees  of MSDE  or DPSCS  who  participate \nin ARD  committee  meetings; \nb.  All  school  principals and  assistant principals \nat Maryland's  Adult  Correctional  Facilities; \n- 14  -\n\nc.  All  special  education  teachers  and  special \nteachers'  aides  at  Maryland's  Adult  Correctional \nFacilities; \nd.  All  non-special  education  teachers  and \nteachers'  aides  at  Maryland's  Adul t  Correctional \nFacilities; \ne.  The  Parent Coordinator; \nf.  All  Classification Counselors;  and \ng.  All  employees  responsible  for  conducting \nintake  interviews. \n2.  MSDE's  in-service training will  emphasize  the  importance \nof  notifying  the  appropriate  personnel  if a  prisoner  is believed \nto  be  educationally  disabled  and  properly  assessing  and  placing \nthe  prisoner  in a  timely manner. \n3.  MSDE's  in-service  training  for  ARD  committee  members \nwill  include  specific  training  concerning  the  identification  of \neach  educational  disabling  condition  enumerated  in  the  IDEA  and \nstate  law  and  instruction  on  any  revised  IEP  procedures.  MSDE's \nin-service  training  will  emphasize  the  importance  of  identifying \neach  prisoner's  individual  educational  needs  as  well  as  the \nimportance  of  developing  IEPs  that are tailored to and  consistent \nwith  those  needs. \n4.  MSDE  will  ensure  that  the  MSDE  Correctional  Education \nHandbook  is  available  to  every  individual  who  performs \npsychological  or  educational  evaluations  in  connection  with  a \nprisoner's confinement  in  a  Maryland  Adult  Correctional  Facility. \n- 15  -\n\nSIGNATORIES: \nPUBLIC  JUSTICE  CENTER,  INC โข \nโข  CHAP  NANCY  GRASMICK \nArnold  & Porter  State Superintendent of  Schools \n1200  New  Hampshire Avenue,  N.W.

INTRODUCTORY  STATEMENT \n1.  This  is  a  civil  rights  class  action  challenging  the \nfailure  of  the  Defendants  to  provide  legally  required  special \neducation  and  related services  to  youth  confined  at_Maryland's  ten \nadult correctional  facilities  and  pre-release  units,  including  the \nMaryland  Correctional  Training  Center  (\"MCTC\"),  the  Maryland \nCorrectional  Institution  at  Hagerstown  (\"MCI-H\"),  Roxbury \nCorrectional  Institution  (\"Roxbury\"),  Eastern  Correctional \nInstitution  (\"ECI\"),  Maryland  Correctional  Institution  at  Jessup \n(\"MCI-J\"'),  the  Maryland  House  of  Corrections  (\"MHC\"),  the  Maryland \nCorrectional  Institution  for  Women  (\"MCI-W\"),  the  Maryland  State \nPenitentiary,  the  Maryland  Correctional  Adjustment  Center,  and \n3 \n\n---_._----- ------- -----.----\n(  ( \nPatuxent  Institution  (\"Patuxent\")  (hereinafter  c'ollect i vely \nreferred  to  as  \"Maryland  Adult  Correctional  Facilities\"  or \n\"Maryland  Adult  Correctional  Systemll\n). \n2.  Under  federal  law,  every disabled  child  up  to  the  age  of \ntwenty-two  (22)  has  the  right  to  a  free  appropriate  public \neducation.  That  right  is  not  ext inguished  by  conf inement  in  a \nMaryland  Adult  Correctional  Facility.  In  fact,  imprisonment  in  a \nMaryland Adult Correctional Facility only  increases the  urgency and \nimportance  of  ensuring  the  delivery  of  that  education.  For  many \nyoung  disabled  inmates,  special  education will  mean  the  difference \nbetween  a  life  marred  by  a  cycle  of  failure  and  a  life  of \nproductive  employment. \n3.  Both  the  Maryland  state  Department  of  Education, \nCorrectional Education Office  (\"MSDE\"),  and  the Maryland Department \nof  Public  Safety and  Correctional Services  (\"PSCS\"),  which  jointly \nadminister  the  legally  required  special  education  within \nprogram~ \nMaryland's Adult Correct ional Facil i ties,  fai 1  to  implement federal \nspecial  education  laws  by:  .(1)  unlawfully  failing  to  screen \ndisabled  or  potentially  disabled  students  for  special  education \nneeds;  (2)  unlawfully  operating special  education  programs  without \nparental,  or  surrogate  parental  part1cipation;  (3)  unlawfully \nfailing  to  develop  Individualized  Educat10n  Plans  (\"IEP's\");  (4) \nunlawfully  failing  to  train personnel  chiefly  responsible. for  the \nscreening,  referral and  implementation of  special  education  within \nthe  Maryland  Adult  Correctional  System;  (5)  unlawfully  failing  to \nhave  an  administrative  appeals  processi  (6)  unlawfully  failing  to \n4 \n\n( \nprovide related  services to disabled  youth  legally entitled to such \n~ervicesi and  (7)  unlawfully operating under  policies which,  during \nthe  student  assessment  and  classification  process,  exclude  nearly \nseventy-five  (75'.\\)  percent  of  eligible  prisoners  from  special \neducation  and  related  services.

Plaintiffs  bring  this  action on  behalf  of  themselves  and \nall  other  persons  similarly  situated.  The  class  consists  of  all \ncurrent  and  future  inmates  of  Maryland's  Adult  Correctional  System \nwho  are  educationally  disabled  and  are  or  will  be  eligible  for \nspecial  education  and  related  services  pursuant  to  federal  law. \n25.  The  class  is  so  numerous  that  joinder  of  all  members  is \n10 \n\n( \n( \nimpracticable.  The  average  daily  population  of  inmates  under  the \nage  of  twenty-two  (22)  confined  in  Maryland's  Adult  Correctional \nFacilities  is  in  excess  of  one  thousand  seven  hundred  (l,700). \nUpon  information and  belief,  at least  twenty-five  (25%)  percent  of \nthis  population  has  a  disabling  condition  and  is  entitled  to \nspecial  education  and  related  services. \n26.  In  addition,  there  are  questions  of  law  and  fact  common \nto  members  of  the  Plaintiff  class  regarding  the  D.efendants' \npolicies  and  practices.  These  include:  (a)  whether  Defendants' \nfailure  to  identify and  assess  the  special  education  needs  of  all \nincarcerated  disabled  youth  in  a  timely  manner  and  in  accordance \nwith  procedural  safeguards,  violates Plaintiffs'  legal  rights,  (b) \n( \nwhether  the  Defendants'  failure  to  provide  incarcerated  disabled \nyouth  with  properly  developed  IEPs  violates  Plaintiffs'  legal \nrights,  (c)  whether  the  Defendants'  failure  to  include  parents, \nguardians or surrogate parents,  in the special education screening, \nassessment  and  monitoring  process  violates  Plaintiffs'  legal \nrights,  (d)  whether  the  Defendants'  failure  to  tra i n  personne 1 \nchiefly responsible for  the referral, assessment and  implementation \nof  special  education  in  Maryland's  Adult  Correctional  Facilities, \nviolates  Plaintiffs'  legal  rights,  and,  (e)  whether  Defendants' \nfailure to provide related services to  incarcerated disabled youth, \nviolates  Plaintiffs'  legal  rights.  The  claims  of  the  named \nPlaintiffs  are  typical  of  the  claims  of  the  members  of  the \nPlaintiff  class. \n27.  The  named  Plaintiffs  and  Plaintiffs'  attorneys  will \n11 \n\n.'  (  (' \nfairly and  adequately  represent  the  interest of  the  members  of  the \nclass.  Plaintiffs know  of  no  conflict  of  interest among  the  class \nmembers.  Plaintiffs  are  represented  by  counsel  exper ienced  in \ncivil  rights  class  action  litigation. \n28.  By  their  policies  and  practices,  the  Defendants  have \nacted  and  continued  to  act  on  grounds  and  in  a  manner  generally \napplicable  to  the  class,  thereby  making  appropriate  final \ninjunctive relief  or  corresponding declaratory relief  with  respect \nto  the  class  as  a  whole.  The  injur les  suf fered  by  the  named \nPlaintiffs  and  the  members  of  the  Plaintiff  class  as  a  result  of \nthe  policies  and  practices  of  the  Defendants,  are  capable  of \nrepetition,  yet  may  evade  review,  thereby  making  class  relief \nappropriate. \nVI.  FACTS  RELEVANT  TO  THE  INDIVIDUAL  PLAINTIFFS \nA.  Melvin  C. \n29.  Plaintiff Melvin C.  has  been  incarcerated  in  the Maryland \nAdult  Correctional  System since  December  22,  1988.  He  has  a  three \n(3)  year  sentence  and  has  been  confined  at  var ious  correct ional \nfacilities,  includlng  MCTC,  Mel-H,  Baltimore  City  Correctional \nCenter,  MHC,  and  MCl-J. \n30.  Melvin C.  has  three  (3)  disabling condltions  that qualify \nhim  as  eligible  for  special  education:  he  is  severely  emotionally \ndisturbed  (\"SED\"),  specific  learning  disabled  (\"SLD\"),  and  has \nchronic  and  severe  asthma,  a  qualifying  health  impairment  that \nprecludes  him  from  attending  regular  education  classes.  These \ndisabling  conditions  limit  Melvin  C.  ability  to  learn  in  a \nI S \n12 \n\n( \n( \nregular  educational  environment. \n31.  Melvin  C.  has  a  long  history  of  placements  in  special \neducation programs.  While  he was  in elementary school  in Baltimore \nCity,  Melvin  C.  was  certified  as  eligible  for  special  education. \nHe  was  classified as  SLD.  An  IEP  describing  his special  education \nneeds  was  developed.  For  the  next  several  years,  Melvin  C.  was \ncontinually  identified  as  eligible  for  special  education. \n32.  On  or  about  February,  1982,  through  December,  1988, \nMelvin  C.  was  confined  in  various  facilities  administered  by  the \nMaryland  Department  of  Juvenile  Services  (\"JSA\"),  including  the \nMontrose  School  and  the  Charles  H.  Hickey,  Jr.  School  (the  \"Hickey \nSchool\").  At  the  JSA  facilities,  he  was  certified as  eligible  for \nspecial  education,  and  IEP's  were developed.  At  the  Hickey School, \nin  1986,  Melvin  C.,  who  was  then  fourteen  (14)  years  old,  was \ntested  to  determine  his  academic  level.  His  grade  level  was  2.5 \nin  reading  and  3.2  in  mathematics. \n33.  Melvin  C.' s  academic  functioning  is  severely  delayed. \nHis  severe  learning  problems  interfere with  his  ability to  benefit \nfrom  an  education.  He  has  been  classified  as  SLD  since elementary \nschool  and,  until  his  confin.ement  in  December,  1988,  has  been  in \nspecial  classes  geared  towards  SED  and  SLD  youth. \n34.  Melvin  C.  also  has  severe  asthma.  When  Melvin  C.  was \nfirst  confined  in  the  Maryland  Adult  Correctional  System,  he  was \nplaced  in a  regular  education class.  When  the  teacher  and  students \nbegan  to  smoke  outs ide  of  the  classroom,  Melvin  C.  suffered  a \nsevere  asthmatic  attack.  He  was  forced  to  miss  four  (4)  days  of \n13 \n\n(' \nclasses.  Because  of  this  absence,  he  was  expelled  from  school. \nFrom  the  time  that  he  was  expelled  from  school  until  January  31, \n1991,  Melvin  C.  was  not  given  any  educational  training  in \nMaryland's  Adult  Correctional  System.  Since  January  31,  1991,  he \nhas  received  only  two  (2)  hours  per  week  of  regular  education. \n35.  Melvin  C. 's asthma  is  a  severe  physical  impairment  which \ninterferes  with  his  ability  to  benefit  from  an  education  in  a \nregular  classroom  setting. \n36.  Since  his  confinement,  Melvin  C.  has  also  been  suicidal. \nOn  or  about  December  25,  1988,  Melvin  C.  attempted  suicide  by \nswallowing  glass.  Since  that  time,  he  has  attempted  suicide,  or \nmade  serious  suicidal  gestures,  on  at  least  five  (5)  other \noccasions,  with  the  last occasion being on  or  about  April  26,  1990. \nHis  severe  emotional  disturbance  interferes  with  his  ability  to \nbenefit  from  an  education  in  a  regular  classroom  environment. \n37.  Despite  these  multiple  educational  disabilities,  the \nDefendants  have  failed  to  provide  Melvin  C.  any  special  education \nand  related  services  des igned  to  meet  his  unique  needs.  The \nDefendants  have  not  developed  an  IEP  for  Melvin  C.;  upon \ninformation  and  belief,  no  Admission-Review-Dismissal  (liARD\") \nPlanning  Conference  for  Melvin  C.  has  been  scheduled  or  held;  the \nDefendants  have  not  notified  Melvin  C. 's  mother  about  an  ARD \nPlanning  Conference,  nor  has  she  attended  a'ny  such  conference. \n3 8 .  Sinc  e  Mel vi n  C.' sinc ar c era t ion  i n  Mar y 1 and's  Ad u 1 t \nCorrectional  System,  neither  Melvin  C.,  nor  his  mother,  nor  a \nparent  surrogate,  have  been  informed  about  the  rights  of  disabled \n14 \n\nyouth  to  procedural  safeguards  and  a  free  appropr iate  publ ic \neducation. \n39.  As  a  r esul t  0 f  his  severe  emot lonal  and  phys lcal \nproblems,  Melvin  C.  has  been  confined  in  administrative  or \ndisciplinary  segregation  (collectively  \"segregation\")  for  the \nmajor i ty  of  his  time  served  in  Maryland' s  Adult  Correctional \nFacilities. \n40.  Upon  information  and  belief,  while  confined  in \nsegregation  Melvin  C.  has  informed  the  Defendants  of  his  right  to \nspecial education and  related services  pursuant to  federal  law,  and \nhas  requested  that the  Defendants  assess  him  for  special  education \nneed,  or alternatively,  place him in a  special educational program. \nDespite  these  requests  for  assessment  and/or  placement,  the \nDefendants  have  continually  denied  Melvin  C.'s  right  to  special \neducation.  In  fact,  on  at  least  one  occasion  Melvin  C.  was  told \nthat  MSDE  and  PSCS  do  not  provide  special  education  to  prisoners \nconfined  in  segregation. \n41.  Melvin  C.  is  disabled  within  the  meaning  of  P.L.  94-142 \nand  Section  504.  Since  his  confinement,  Defendants  have  denied \nMelvin  C.  a  free  appropriate  education  as  mandated  by  federal  law \nand  the  due  process  and  equal  protection clauses  of  the  fourteenth \namendment  to  the  United  states  Constitution. \nB.  'Arthur  W. \n42.  Plaintiff  Arthur  W.  has  been  incarcerated  in  Maryland's \nAdult  Correctional  System since September  24,  1988.  He  has  a  forty \n(40)  year  sentence  and  has  been  confined  at  various  adult \n15 \n\n( \ncorrectional  facilities,  including  MCTC,  MCI-H  and  Patuxent. \n43.  Arthur  W.  has  two  disabling  conditions  that  qualify  him \nas  eligible  for  special  education:  severe  emotional  disturbance \nand  specific  learning  disability. \n44.  Prior  to  his  incarceration,  Arthur  W.  had  a  long  history \nof  placements  in  special  education  programs.  While  he  was  in \nelementary  school  in  Baltimore  City  Arthur  W.  was  certi f ied  as \nI \neligible  for  special  education.  He  was  classified as  SLD.  An  IEP \ndescribing his special education needs  was  developed.  For  the next \nseveral years,  Arthur W.  was  continually identified as  eligible for \nspecial  education.  Arthur  W.  last  attended  public  school  at  the \nJoseph C.  BI:iscoe  School  (\"Briscoe\")  which  is  located  in Baltimore, \nMaryland.  Briscoe  is  a  special  education  school. \n45.  Arthur  W.  was  also  confined  in  various  JSA  facilities, \nincluding the Hickey School.  At  these  facilities,  he  was  ceI:tified \nas  eligible  for.special  education  and  IEP's  were  developed. \n46.  Arthur  W.' s  academic  functioning  is  severely  delayed. \nHis  severe  leaI:ning  problems  interfere with  his  ability to  benefit \nfrom  an  education.  He  has  beep  classified  as  learning  disabled \nsince  elementary  school  and,  .until  his  confinement  in  September, \n1988,  has  participated  in  special education  classes geared  towards \nSED  and  SLD  youth.  Upon  information and  belief,  Arthur  W.  was  last \ngiven  academic  testing in January,  1990.  At  that time,  his  reading \nlevel  was  6.7  and  his  mathematics  level  was  5.3. \n47.  In  an  evaluation  conducted  by  Fred  S.  Berlin,  M.D., \nPh.D.,  Associate  Professor,  The  Johns  Hopkins  University School  of \n16 \n\n( \nMedicine,  on  or  about  March  25,  1988,  it  was  observed  that  \"the \nbest  type  of  psychiatric  facility,  in  terms  of  the  evaluation \nrecommended  for  this  young  man,  would  be  one  which  specializes  in \nthe  assessment  and  treatment  of  emotionally disturbed  youth.\" \n48.  Despite  Arthur  W. 's  educational  disabilities/  the \nDefendants  have  failed  to  provide  Arthur  W.  any  special  education \nand  related  services  designed  to  meet  his  unique  needs.  The \nDefendants  have  not  developed  an  IEP  for  Arthur  W.;  upon \ninformation  and  belief,  no  ARD  Planning  Conference  for  Arthur  W. \nhas  been  scheduled  and  held;  and  Defendants  have  not  notified \nArthur  W.'s  mother  about  an  ARD  Planning  Conference,  nor  has  she \nattended  any  such  conference. \n(  49.  Upon  information  and  belief/  Arthur  W.  was  denied  S!.ll. \naccess  to  education  in  the  Maryland  Adult  Correctional  Facilities \nuntil  or  about  January 14,  1991,  and  then  he  was  merely  placed  into \na  regular  education  program. \n50.  Since  Arthur  W. 's  incarceration  in  the  Maryland  Adult \nCorrectional  System,  neither  Arthur  W.,  nor  his  mother,  nor  a \nparent  surrogate,  have  been  in~ormed about  the  rights  of  disabled \nyouth  to  procedural  safeguards  and  a  free  appropr iate  publ ic \neducation. \n51.  Arthur  W.  is  disabled  within  the  meaning  of  the  P.L.  94-\n142  and  Section  504.  The  Defendants  have  denied  Arthur  W.  a  free \nappropr iate  education  as  mandated  by  federal  law,  and  the  due \nprocess  and  equal  protection  clauses  of  the  fourteenth  amendment \nto  the  United  states  Constitution. \n17 \n\n( \n( \nC.  Billy  D. \n52.  Plaintiff  Billy  D.  has  been  incarcerated  in  Maryland's \nAdult  Correctional  System since  December  13,  1988.  He  has  a  seven \n(7)  year  sentence  and  is  confined  at  Roxbury. \n53.  Billy  D.  has  at  least  one  disabling  conditions  that \nqualifies  him  as  eligible  for  special  education:  severe  emotional \ndisturbance. \n54.  Prior  to  his  incarceration,  Billy  D.  had  a  long  history \nof  placements  in  special  education  programs.  In  1980,  when  Billy \nD.  was  eight  (8)  years  old,  he  was  certified  as  eligible  for \nspecial  education  by  the  Pimlico  Elementary  School,  which  is \nlocated  in  Baltimore  City.  He  was  classified  as  SED.  An  IEP \n( \ndescribing his special  education  needs was  developed.  For  the  next \nseveral  years,  Billy D.  was  continually  identified as  eligible  for \nspecial  education.  Billy  D.  last  attended  public  school  at  the \nGarrison Middle  School  (\"Garrison\"),  which  is  located  in  Baltimore \nCity.  At  the  time  of  his  arrest  he  was  attending  Garrison  and  was \nin  a  special  education  program. \n55.  Billy  D.  was  also  confined  in  various  JSA  facilities, \nincluding  the  Maryland  Youth  Resident  Center,  the  Montrose  School \nand  the  Hickey  School.  On  information  and  belief,  at  these \nfacilities,  he  was  certified as  eligible  for  special  education  and \nIEP's  were  developed. \n56.  Bi lly  D.' s  academic  funct ioni ng  is  severe ly  de layed . \nHis  severe  emotional  problems  interfere with his ability to benefit \nfrom  an  education.  Upon  information and  belief,  Billy D.  was  given \n18 \n\n( \n( \nacademic  testing  in  1990.  At  that  time,  his  reading  level  was  4.1 \nand  his  mathematics  level  was  6.6. \n57.  Despite  Billy  D.'s  educational  disabilities,  the \nDefendants  have  failed  to  provide  Billy  D.  any  special  education \nand  related  services  designed  to  meet  his  unique  needs.  Upon \ninformation  and  belief,  in  May,  1990  Billy  D.  was  referred  for \nspecial  education  assessment  to  the  ARD  Planning  Conference. \nAlthough  the  assessment  was  completed  and  special  education \nprograming  was  recommended  for  Billy  D.,  the  ARD  Committee \ndetermined  that  Billy  D.  is  ineligible  for  special  education  and \nrelated  services. \n58.  Upon  informat ion  and  bel i ef,  Bi lly  D.  spoke  wi th  the \nPrincipal  of  Roxbury  to  find  out  why  the  ARD  Committee  determined \nthat  he  was  ineligible  for  special education  and  related services. \nThe  Principal  explained  the  reasons  to  Billy D.  but  failed  to  take \nany  further  action  and  failed  to  inform  him  of  any  other  means  to \nappeal  the  decision  of  the  ARD  Committee. \n59.  Upon  information and  belief,  Billy D.  also spoke with  the \nspecial  education  teacher  at  Roxbury  to  find  out  why  the  ARD \nCommittee  determined  that  he  was  ineligible  for  special  education \nand  related  services.  The  special  education  teacher  explained  the \nreasons  to  Bi lly  D.  but  fal led  to  take  any  further  act ion.  The \nspecial education teacher  also expressly told  Billy D.  that  the ARD \nCommittee  would  not  allow him  to be  retested  for  special  education \neligibility. \n60.  Upon  information  and  belief,  the  Deยฃendi'mts  have  not \n19 \n\n(  ( \ndeveloped  an  rEP  for  Billy  D.;  the  Defendants  have  not  notified \nBilly  D. 's  mother  about  the  ARD  Planning  Conference,  nor  has  she \nattended  any  such  conference. \n61.  Since  Billy  D. 's  incarceration  in  the  Maryland  Adult \nCorrectional  System,  neither  his  mother,  nor  a  parent  surrogate, \nhave  been  informed  about  the rights of disabled youth  to procedural \nsafeguards  and  a  free  appropriate  public  education. \n62.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Billy  D.  was  placed  in  a \nregular  educational  program.  On  or  about  October,  1990,  Billy  D. \nwas  confined  in segregation and since that date  the  Defendants  have \nnot  allowed  him  to  attend  school. \n63.  Billy D.  is  disabled  within  the  meaning  of  the  P.L.  94-\n( \n142  and  Section  504.  The  Defendants  have  denied  Billy  D.  a  free \nappropr iate  educat ion  as  mandated  by  federal  law,  and  the  due \nprocess  and  equal  protection  clauses  of  the  fourteenth  amendment \nto  the  United  States  Constitution. \nD.  Scott  C. \n64.  Plaintiff  Scott  C.  has  been  incarcerated  in  Maryland's \nAdult  Correctional  System  since  September  18,  1989.  He  has  a \nthirty  (30)  year  sentence  and  has  been  confined  at  various \ncorrectional  facilities,  including  Patuxent,  MCTC,  MCI-H  and \nRoxbury. \n65.  Scott  C.  has  at  least  one  disabling  condition  that \nqualifies  him  as  eligible  for  special  education:  severe  emotional \ndisturbance. \n66.  Prior  to  his  incarceration,  Scott  C.  had  a  long  history \n20 \n\n(  ( \nof  placements  in  special  education  programs.  While  he  was  in \nelementa;-y  school  (2nd  grade)  in  Baltimore  county  Scott  C.  was \ncertified as  eligible  for  special  education.  Upon  information  and \nbelief,  he  was  classified  as  SED  and  was  placed  in  a  special \neducation  program.  An  IEP  describing  his  special  education  needs \nwas  developed.  For  the  next  several  years,  Scott  C.  was \ncontinually  identified  as  eligible  for  special  education.  Scott \nC. 's  last school  of  attendance  was  the  Woodlawn  Middle  School.  At \nthe  time  of  his  arrest  he  had  an  existing  and  then  current  IEP. \nHe  was  classified  as  severely  emotionally disturbed. \n67.  Scott  C. 's  academic  functioning  is  severely delayed  and \nhis  severe  emotional  problems  continue  to  interfere  with  his \nability to benefit  from an education.  Upon  information  and  belief, \nthe  last  known  academic  test  administered  to  Scott  C.  in  the \nMaryland  Adult  Correctional  Facilities was  tne  Test  of  Adult  Basic \nEducation  on  August  27,  1990.  At  that  time,  his  reading  level  was \n5.3  and  his  mathematics  level  was  4.4. \n68.  Upon  information  and  belief,  while  incarcerated  Scott \nC.'s  severe  emotional  disturba~ce has  continued  to  interfere  with \nhis  ability  to  benefit  from  an  education  in  a  regular  classroom \nenvironment.  Scott  C.  was  enrolled  in  an  Adult  Basic  Education  -\n- i.e.  regular  education  -- class,  beginning  about  July  2,  1990. \nUpon  information  and  belief,  on  or  before  January  8,  1991,  Scott \nC.  told  his  teacher  that  the  class  was  \"too  hard\"  and  \"went  too \nfast.\"  In  response,  Scott  C.  was  removed  from  the  class  and  has \nnot  attended  class  since. \n21 \n\n( \n\" \n69.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Scott  C.  has  inquired  as  to \nthe  possibility  of  placement  in  an  easier  class,  or  a  class  that \nis  suited  to  his  unique  needs.  The  Defendants  have  not  responded \nto  this  inquiry. \n70.  Despite  Scott  C. 's  educational  disabilities,  the \nDefendants  have  failed  to  provide  him  any  special  education  and \nrelated  services  designed  to  meet  his  unique  needs.  Upon \ninformation  and  belief,  the  Defendants  have  not  developed  an  IEP \nfor  Scott  C.;  no  ARD  Planning  Conference  for  Scott  C.  has  been \nscheduled  or  held;  the  Def endan ts  have  not  not if i ed  Scott  C.' s \nmother,  Denise  P.,  about  an  ARD  Planning  Conference,  nor  has  she \nattended  any  such  conference. \n71.  Since  Scott  C. 's  incarceration  in  Maryland's  Adult \nCorrectional  System,  neither  Scott  C.  nor  his  mother,  Denise  P., \nhave  been  informed  about  the rights  of disabled  youth  to procedural \nsafeguards  and  a  free  appropriate  public  education. \n72.  Scott  c.  is  disabled  within  the  meaning  of  P.L.  94-142 \nand  Section  504.  Since  his  confinement,  Defendants  have  denied \nScott  C.  a  free  appropriate  ed~cation as  mandated  by  federal  law \nand  the  due  process  and  equal  protection  clauses  of  the  fourteenth \namendment  to  the  United  states  Constitution. \nVI I โข  FACTS  RELEVANT  TO  THE  CLASS \n73.  The  Maryland  State  Department  of  Publ ic  Safety  and \nCorrect i onal  Services  operates  ten  (10)  adult  institutions  and \neight  (8)  pre-release  centers  throughout  Maryland.  -Youth  are \ncommi tt ed  to  the  cus tody  0 f  PSCS  either:  (1)  be for e  the  age  0 f \n22 \n\ncยท \n( \neighteen  (18),  by  the  determination  of  a  juvenile  court  that \n\"waiver\"  into  the  adult  system  is  warranted  or  as  a  result  of \nautomatic  waivers;  or,  (2)  upon  reaching  the  age  of  eighteen  (18), \nby  Maryland  District  and  Circuit  Courts  in  Baltimore  City  and  the \ncounties  of  Maryland.  All  of  the  facilities  operated  by  PSCS  are \n\"state  correctional  facilities\"  as  that  term  is  used  in  34  C.F.R. \nS300.2. \n74.  P.L.  94-142  designates  a  state's  educational  agency  as \nthe  agency  that  administers  special  educational  programs  for \ndisabled  youth.  MSDE  is  a  \"local  education  agency\"  as  that  term \nis  used  in  20  U.S.C.  81401(8)  and  a  \"public  agency\"  as  that  term \nin  used  in  34  C.F.R.  SS300.2  and  300.11. \n75.  The  purpose  of  P.L.  94-142  is  \"to  assure  that  all \ndisabled  chi ldren  have  avai lable  to  them ... a  free  appropr iate \npublic  education  which  emphasizes  special  education  and  related \nservices  designed  to  meet  their  unique, needs  to  assure  that  the \nrights  of  disabled  children  and  their  parents  or  guardian  are \nprotected.\"  20  U.S.C.  S1400(c). \n76.  P.L.  94-142  require?  that  each  state  provide  a  free \nappropriate public  education  for  all disabled  children between  the \nages  of  three  (3)  and  twenty-one  (21),  unless  this  requirement  is \ninconsistent  with  state  law  or  practice. \n77.  Upon  information  and  belief,  the  state  of  Maryland, \nthrough  both  MSDE  and  PSCS,  receives  federal  funds  under  P.L.  94-\n142,  including  funds  to  provide  special  education  and  related \nservices  to  inmates  through  the  age  of  twenty-one  (21). \n23 \n\n( \n78.  MSDE  and  PSCS  jointly administer  and  are  responsible  for \nthe  implementation  of  P.L.  94-142  in  Maryland's  Adult  Correctional \nFacilities. \n79.  As  part  of  MSDE  and  PSCS's  established  procedure  within \nMaryland's  Adult  Correctional  Facilities,  all  prisoners  are \ninitially evaluated  to determine  their  educational  abilities at  an \nintake  facility  (\"Maryland  Adult  Correctional  Intake  Facility\"). \nEligible  prisoners  are  given  the  Test  of  Adult  Basic  Education, \nwhich  is  group  administered,  and  determines  academic  performance \nin  mathematics  and  reading.  It  does  not  determine  special \neducation  needs.  Upon  information  and  belief,  only  prisoners  who \nare  under  twenty-one  (2l)  years  of  age  aru1  score  below  a  seventh \ngrade  academic  level are  \"tagged\" at this time  for  further  testing, \neven  though  P.L.  94-142  requires  that  all  disabled  students  under \ntwenty-two  ( 22)  years  of  age  (hereafter  \"Age  EI ig i ble  Disabled \nStudents\")  be  provided  'special  education  and  related  services. \nFollowing  this  assessment,  inmates  are  sent  to  their  \"home \ninstitution.\" \n80.  Upon  information  and  belief,  at  the  home  institution, \n\"tagged\"  prisoners  are  divided  into  two  groups:  those  with  short \nprison sentences and those with \"significant\" sentences.  Prisoners \nwith  short  sentences  are  \"screened  out\"  of  the  special  education \nprocess.  On  information'and  belief,  these  youth  are  excluded  from \nplacement  under  the  provisions  of  P.L.  94-142  in  furtherance  of \nDefendants'  policy  of  excluding  youth  from  special  education. \n81.  Upon  information  and  belief,  MSDE  and  PSCS  continue  to \n24 \n\nevaluate  \"tagged\"  youth  with  \"significant\"  sentences  (hereafter \n\"student\"  or  \"prisoner\").  At  this  time,  however,  these  tagged, \nprisoners  are  neither  placed  in  special  education  or  related \nservices  programs  nor  referred  for  special  education  assessment. \nRather,  as  part  of  the  screening  process,  they  are  merely  given \npr ior i ty  for  !;>lacement  in  avai lable  regular  education  programs. \nOften,  however,  regular  educational  space  is  not  available,  and \nstudents  who  would  otherwise  be  eligible  for  special  education  or \nrelated services  programs  are not  placed  in any  educational  program \nfor  long  periods  of  time.  This  time  lapse  violates  federal  law. \n82.  Upon  information  and  belief,  students  placed  in  regular \neducational  programs 'within  the  prison  are  not  taught  by  certified \nspecial  educational  teachers. \n83.  Upon  information  and  belief,  after  tagged  students  have \nbeen  in  the  regular  educational  program  for  some  time,  the  regular \neducation  t~acher evaluates  each  student  to  determine  whether  the \nstudent  seems  to  have  a  disabling condition.  Upon  information  and \nbelief,  a  regular  education  teacher's  determination  that  the \nstudent  does  not  have  a  disabling  condition  -- that  is  a  condition \nthat  indicates  a  need  or  potential  need  for  special  education  and \nrelated  services  -- is  conclusive,  even  though  Defendants  know  or \nshould know that such  a  determination requires specialized training \nand  certification. \n84.  Students  identified  as  possibly  having  a  disabling \ncondition are scheduled  to  attend an  ARD  Planning Conference.  Upon \ninformation  and  belief,  MSDE  and  PSCS  fail  to  provide  training  and \n25 \n\n.'  ( \ninstruction  on  the  requirements  and  procedures  of  P.L.  94-142,  to \nthe  members  of  the  ARD  Committee,  even  though  federal  law  requires \nthat  every member  of  the evaluation and  monitoring  team  -- i.e.  the \nARD  Committee  -- receive  such  training  and  instructions. \n85.  Upon  information  and  belief,  MSDE  and  PSCS  send  a  form \nletter  to  the  student's  parent  or  guardian  informing  the  student's \nparent  or  guardian  that  an  ARD  Planning  Conference  is  sCheduled. \nIn  applying  this  poli,cy  and  practice,  however,  MSDE  and  PSCS \nviolate  federal  law  in  at  least  two  respects:  (1)  MSDE  and  PSCS \nsend  the  letter  only  to  the  parents  of  students  under  the  age  of \neighteen  (18),  even  though  MSDE  and  PSCS  are  required  to  include \nthe  parents  of  all  Age  Eligible  Disabled  or  potentially  Disabled \nStudents i  and  (2}  parents  who  are  contacted  are  not  given  any \nalternative  dates  or  times  for  attending  the  ARD  Planning \nConference  if  the  Conference  is  inconvenient  for  their  schedule, \neven  though  federal  law  requires  that  the  ARD  Planning  Conference \nbe  held  at a  mutually  convenient  time.  On  information  and  belief, \nall or  almost  all  ARD  Planning Conferences  are  held  during  regular \nbusiness  hours,  even  though  theยท Defendants  know  that  many  of  the \nparents  live  and  work  more  than  one  hundred  (100)  miles  from  the \nrespective  prisons,  or  are  unable  to  take  off  from  work. \n86.  When  inmates'  parents  are  either  \"unavailable\"  or \n\"inaccessible,\"  upon  information  and  belief,  MSDE  and  PSCS  will \nappoint  parent  surrogates,  but  only  if  the  inmate  is  under  the  age \nof  eighteen  (18),  even  though  federal  law  requires  that  parent \nsurrogates  be  appointed  for  all  Age  Eligible  Disabled  or \n26 \n\n( \npotentially  Disabled  students  whose  parents  are  either \n\"unavailable\"  or  \"inaccessible.\"  Upon  information  and  belief,  in \nthe  rare  instances  where  a  parent  surrogate  is  appointed  for  the \ndisabled  or  potentially  disabled  student,  MSDE  and  PSCS  fail  to \nprovide  any  training  and  instruction  in  special  education  to  the \nparent  surrogate  in  violation  of  federal  law. \n87.  Upon  information and  belief,  MSDE  and  PSCS's  pollcies and \npractices with  respect to parents and  parent surrogates  effectively \nexclude  them  from  participation  in  special  education  referral, \nassessment  and  monitoring,  even  though  federal  law  requires  that \nthe  parent,  guardian  or  parent  surrogate  participate  in  all \nevaluation and  monitoring conferences  for  all students  who  qualify \nas  e I ig i ble  or  potent ially  el igible  for  spec ial  educat ion  and \nrelated  services  under  P.L.  94-142. \n88.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Defendants  operate  under \npolicies  and  practices  that  routlnely fail  to  provide  students  and \ntheir  parents,  guardians  or  parent  surrogates  with  written \nsummaries  of  ARD  Planning  Conferences,  even  though  the  Defendants \nk.now  or  should  know  that  such.  practices  and  policies  violate \nfederal  law. \n89.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Defendants  fail  to  inform \nstudents,  including students excluded from  participation in special \neducation  programs,  and  their  parents,  guardians  or  parent \nsurrogates  of  the  legally  guaranteed  right  to  special  education, \nincluding  the  right  to  an  administrative  appeal  and  due  process \nhearing,  even  though  such  notice  is  legally  required. \n27 \n\n( \n90.  Upon  information  and  belief,  following  the  ARD  Planning \nConference,  specific special  education  testing  is  conducted.  The \nstudent  is  also  assigned  to  another  regular  education  classroom, \nif  available,  for  further  observation. \n91.  Upon  information  and  belief,  a  second  ARD  Planning \nConference  (\"second  ARD\")  is  convened  to  review  the  results  of  the \ntests and  classroom observation.  The second ARD  determines whether \nthe  student  needs  special  education  and  related  services. \n92.  Upon  information  and  belief,  during  the  second  ARD,  MSDE \nand  PSCS  knowingly employ assessment criteria for  special education \neligibility that,  as  a  matter  of  policy and  practice,  excludes  all \nor  virtually all  SED  youth,  including  youth  who  were  eligible  for \nspecial  education  and  related  services  as  SED  before  they  were \nincarcerated.  On  information  and  belief,  MSDE  and  PSCS  currently \nprovide  services  to  few  SLD  youth  who  are  legally  entitled  to \nspecial  education  and  related services;  on  information  and  belief, \nMSDE  and  PSCS  also  currently  provide  services  to  few,  if  any, \nmentally  retarded  students,  who  are  legally  entitled  to  special \neducat ion  and  related  services.  Contrary  to  Defendants \nI \ndeterminations  of  eligibility,  these  students  SED,  SLD  and \nmentally retarded  - compose  a  vast majority  (approximately  75%)  of \nany  eligible  special  education  prisoner  population.  Thus, \nDefendants  routinely  fail  to  identify and  assess  close  to seventy \nfive  (75%)  percent  of  all  youth  who  are  eligible  for  special \neducation  and  related  services,  and  are  legally  entitled  to  such \nservices,  in  direct  contravention  of  the  requirements  of  P.L.  94-\n28 \n\n(  ( \n142  and  its  implement ing  regulat ions.  These  \"mi ssed\"  students \noften  are  not  even  placed  in  a  regular  educational  program. \n93.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Defendants  fail  to  assess \nstudents  needs  and  implement  student rEP's  in a  timely manner,  fail \nto  include  in  IEP's  short-term  instructional  objectives  and  fail \nto  utilize  existing  and  current  rEP's  in  implementing  special \neducation  programs,  thus  denying  Plaintiffs  and  the  class  they \nrepresent  the  legally guaranteed right to an  appropriate education. \n94.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Defendants  deliberately \nallow  regular  education  teachers  to  instruct  special  education \nstudents  in  classes  that  mandate  the  expertise  of  trained  special \neducation  instructors. \n95.  Upon  information and belief,  the  identification,  referral \nand  assessment  process  from  the  student's  arrival  at  a  Maryland \nAdult  Correctional  Intake  Facility,  until  the  student  is  placed \ninto  a  special  education  program,  routinely  takes  up  to  a  year, \neven  though  this  time  lapse  is  excessive  and  violates  Plaintiffs' \nrights  under  federal  law,  inclCl6ing  the  right  to  have  the  IEP \nimplemented  in  a  timely  fashion; \n96.  Upon  information  and  belief,  there  has  never  been  an \nadministrative  appeal  or  due  process  hearing  conducted  in \nMaryland's  Adult  Correctional  Facilities  for  a  prisoner contesting \nany  issue regarding special education eligibility or  services,  even \nthough  students  have  requested  such  an  appeal  or  hearing,  and  an \nadministrative appeal  or due  process  hearing  is  required by  federal \nlaw. \n29 \n\n( \n97.  Upon  i nformat ion  and  be lie f,  the  De f endan ts  do  not \nprovide  for  an  independent  asse~sment or  evaluation,  even  though \nthe  student,  or  their  parent(s)  have  requested  such  an  assessment, \nand  the  assessment  is  required  by  federal  law. \n98.  Upon  information and  belief,  when  IEP's  are developed and \nstudents  are  placed  in  special  education  classes,  Defendants \nroutinely fail  to  monitor  student  progress  by conducting  follow-up \nARD  Planning  Conferences  in  a  timely  fashion  as  required  by  P.L. \n94-142  and  its  implement  of  regulations. \n99.  Defendants  know  or  should  have  known  that  their  actions, \nomissions,  policies  and  practices  fail  to  comply  with  the \nrequirements  of  federal  law. \n100.  In  this  action,  exhaustion  of  administrative  remedies \nis  not  required  because:  (1)  the  Defendants  have  failed  to  provide \nrequired  special  education  services;  (2)  the  Defendants  have \nabridged  the  procedural  rights  of  special  education  eligible \nprisoners  and  their  parents;  (3)  the  Defendants  have  adhered  to \npo 1i c i es  or  pract ices  whi ch  ar e  contrary  to  law;  (4)  it  is \nimprobable  that  adequate  relief  can  be  obtained  through  an \nadministrative  process;  (5)  an  emergency  situation  r~quiring \nimmediate  action  exists;  and,  (6)  it would  otherwise  be  futile  or \ninadequate  to  use  the  administrative  due  process  procedures. \nVIII.  vEGAL  CLAIHS \nFIRST  CAUSE  OF  ACTION \n101.
