    "summary": "<p>On November 15, 1989, a juvenile detainee at the Jackson County, Missouri,  Juvenile Justice Center filed a class action lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1983, 1988 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri against various administrators and an officer of the juvenile detention center. The class consisted of the named juvenile detainee and others similarly-situated. The plaintiff, who was represented by private counsel and the National Center for Youth Law, sought injunctive relief and damages, alleging that the conditions in the detention center violated due process. More specifically, the plaintiff alleged that the overcrowding at the center, the use of floor mattresses, and injurious health and safety conditions constituted punishment during pretrial detention. </p><p>On April 30, 1990, the District Court (Judge Dean Whipple) certified the class, denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the case, and denied the plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction, on the grounds that there was no risk of immediate and irreparable harm, because the named plaintiff had already been released from the detention center. </p><p>On April 26, 1994, a jury verdict and judgment by the court was reached. The jury awarded the named plaintiff damages for the forty-two minutes he spent in isolation where there was urine on the floor. In its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, also filed on April 26, 1994, the court (Judge Whipple) found for the defendants, on the grounds that there was no constitutional violation, and did not grant the injunctive relief sought. The juvenile detention center was responsive to the complaints about health and safety conditions, and took action to reasonably remedy the problems. The plaintiff appealed the District Court decision, which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part. We have no information regarding the details of the Eighth Circuit's decision. The plaintiffs' attorneys were awarded reasonable fees and expenses.</p><p></p>",

MYERS, et al., )\nDefendants.\nORDER\nIn  this  civil  rights  action,  plaintiffs  seek  declaratory\njudgment,  injunctive  and  other  equitable  relief  and  damages.\nPlaintiffs  complain  about  the conditions  and  operations  of  the\nJackson County (Missouri) Juvenile Justice Center (\"center\") .  Five\nmotions are pending:\n1.  Plaintiffs filed a motion on November 15, 1989, seeking\nan order determining that this matter should be maintained as\na class action.  In a motion to dismiss, filed on December 6,\n1989,  three  defendants  alternatively  moved  to  deny  class\ncertification.  Plaintiffs  filed  on  January  16,  1990,  a\nresponse to defendants' motion.  The motion requesting class\ncertification will be granted.\n2.  Plaintiffs filed a motion on November 15, 1989, seeking\na  preliminary  injunction.  Defendants'  December  6,  1989,\nmotion  to  dismiss  alternatively  moved  to  deny  injunction\nrelief.  Plaintiffs responded on January 16, 1990.  The motion\nwill be denied.\n3.  The motion  to dismiss was  filed  December  6,  1989, by\ndefendants Lawrence G. Myers, David A. Jackson, and Forestal\nLawton.  Plaintiffs' response on January 16, 1990, included\nreply  suggestions  supporting  their  motions  for  class\ncertification  and  injunction.  Defendants  filed  reply\nsuggestions on February 5, 1990, in support of their motion\nto dismiss.  The motion to dismiss will be denied.\n4.  Defendants  filed  a motion  on February  5,  1990, for a\nprotective order to stay further discovery.  Plaintiffs filed\n3\n\ntheir opposition on February 20, 1990.  The motion will be\ndenied.\n5.  Plaintiffs filed on February 14, 1990, a request to enter\nthe center for inspection and other purposes.  No opposition\nwas  filed within  the allotted  time.  The motion will be\ngranted.\nI.  Statement of the Case\nPlaintiff  A.J.,  a  16-year-old  minor,  filed  this  action\nNovember 15, 1989, by his mother and next friend, L.B., on behalf\nof himself and others similarly situated.  Pseudonyms are used to\nprotect the juvenile plaintiff's identity.  He was detained at the\ncenter  for  15 days,  and was  released  about  an hour  after  this\nlawsuit was filed.  The defendants are Lawrence G. Myers, center\nadministrator; David A. Jackson, assistant administrator; Forestal\nLawton, juvenile officer, and unidentified administrative persons\ndesignated  only  as various John  Does.  They  are  sued  in their\nofficial and individual capacities.\nPursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1983 and 1988, plaintiffs complain\nthat  plaintiff  A.J.  and  others  similarly  situated  have  been\ndeprived  of  due  process  of  law.  Specifically,  they  allege\novercrowding  at the center, use of floor mattresses on which to\nsleep, and  injurious health and safety conditions.  They allege\nthe conditions constitute punishment during pretrial detention, in\nviolation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nII. Facts\nThe center is a three-story facility at 625 East 26th Street,\nKansas City, Missouri.  It is owned and operated by Jackson County\nas the official detention site for children under Jackson County\n2\n\njuvenile court jurisdiction.  In the autumn of 1988, the center\nexperienced  an  unexpected  population  increase.  Administrative\nofficials took numerous steps to accommodate the larger population.\nA year later, on October 30, 1989, plaintiff A.J. was charged\nwith carrying a concealed weapon.  Throughout the 15-day detention\nhis sleeping area was a one-person room which he shared with either\none or two other persons while occupying a mattress on the floor.\nIII. The Motions\nA. Class Action\n1. Arguments\nPlaintiffs seek class certification pursuant to Rule 23 (b) (2) ,\nFed.R.Civ.P.  The  class  would  include  all  present  and  future\ndetainees of the center who have been detained between November 15,\n1984, and November 15, 1989.  Plaintiffs claim to have met the four\nclass  characteristics.  Rule  23(a)  requires  numerosity,\ncommonality,  typicality,  and  fair  and  adequate  representation.\nAdditionally,  plaintiffs  assert  that  a  class  action  under  Rule\n23(a) should be maintained because the action falls within one of\nthe categories  in Rule 23 (b).  That is, \"the party opposing the\nclass has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable\nto the class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief\nwith respect to the class as a whole.\"  Rule 23(b)(2), Fed.R.Civ.P.\nDefendants argue that a class cannot be certified because the\nnamed  plaintiff,  A.J.,  was  released  from  detention  before\ncertification occurred.  His release made the certification issue\nmoot, they contend.  They cite Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 402\n\nn.ll,  (1975),  in which the Supreme Court indicated there may be\ncircumstances  in which  the  issues will  become  moot  before  the\ndistrict court reasonably could rule on a certification motion.\nNoting  that  named  plaintiff  A.J. has been  released,  defendants\nchallenge the adequacy of that party  to represent the class of\npersons who have been detained.\n2. Discussion\na. Mootness\nIn class action suits, the plaintiff presents two  separate\nissues  for  judicial  resolution  โ  the  individual  claim  on  its\nmerits and the claim that the plaintiff is entitled to represent\na class of similarly situated persons.  United States Parole Comm'n\nv. Geraghty. 445 U.S. 388, 402 (1980).  Once a class is certified,\nof course, mootness regarding an individual party will not affect\nthe continuing claim of the class because it has acquired a legal\nstatus separate from that of the plaintiff.  Sosna v. Iowa, supra.\n419  U.S.  at  399-400.  On  the  other  hand,  if  certification  is\ndenied,  the plaintiffs'  individual  claim  for damages  would  not\nbecome moot.\nEven though the named plaintiff A.J. here was released from\nthe  center  before  class  certification  reasonably  could  be\nconsidered, neither his claim nor the putative class's claim has\nbecome moot.  In Gerstein v. Puqh. 420 U.S. 103 (1975), the Supreme\nCourt  held  that  release  of  named  plaintiffs  from  a  pretrial\ndetention center before consideration of class certification did\nnot make the class action moot.  The Supreme Court said, at 111\n\nn.ll:\nAt  oral  argument  counsel  informed  us  that  the  named\nrespondents have been convicted.  Their pretrial detention\ntherefore  has  ended.  This case belongs, however, to  that\nnarrow class of cases  in which the termination  of a class\nrepresentative's claim does not moot the claims of the unnamed\nmembers of the class.  See Sosna v[.] Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 42\nL[.] Ed[ยท] 2d, 532 S[.] Ct[.] 553 (1975).  Pretrial detention\nis by nature temporary, and it is most unlikely that any given\nindividual  could  have  his  constitutional  claim  decided  on\nappeal  before  he  is  either  released  or  convicted.  The\nindividual  could  nonetheless  suffer  repeated  deprivations,\nand it is certain that other persons similarly situated will\nbe detained under the allegedly unconstitutional procedures.\nThe claim, in short, is one that is distinctly  \"capable of\nrepetition, yet evading review.\"\nAs noted by defendants, persons seldom are kept at the center\nlonger than three months.  Therefore, an individual plaintiff would\nbe unlikely to have his constitutional claim decided before leaving\nthe center.  Furthermore, a constitutional deprivation, if any, is\ncapable of repetition with each new detainee.  In fact, it easily\ncould be repeated with the named plaintiff, A.J., who is currently\non probation.  The  facts here  easily put this  case within  the\nnarrow class of cases described by the Supreme Court in Gerstein.\nThe release of A.J. is not sufficient to make his claims or the\nclass's claims moot.\nb. Rule 23 fa) Qualifications\n(1) Numerosity\nThe number of persons in the proposed class would be large by\nany  estimate  and  make  joinder  of  parties  difficult  if  not\nprohibitive.  The  fluid  nature  of  the  class  โ  with  juvenile\ndetainees arriving and leaving with irregularity โ  also makes this\n5\n\ngroup of plaintiffs particularly suitable for class certification.\nDefendants have set forth no reasons why the numerosity requirement\nis not satisfied.\n(2) Commonality\nThe same source of alleged harm against the named plaintiffs\nalso applies to all putative class members, and arises from the\nsame alleged constitutional deprivations.  Each class member will\nhave been detained in the center, where he will have been exposed\nto the same alleged constitutional deprivations as all other class\nmembers.  Even though  some persons will have been detained  for\nlonger periods than others, the distinction is only one of degree\nrather  than  substance.  The  crux  of the  complaint  is that  the\ndetained juveniles are subjected to punishment before the charges\nagainst them are litigated.  Variations in the amount of pretrial\npunishment,  if  any,  are  not  sufficiently  relevant  to  defeat\ncertification.\n(3) Typicality\nLikewise,  the  named  plaintiffs1  grievances  are  typical  of\nthose of the other potential class members.  The factual proof and\nlegal theories to be applied by the named plaintiffs is precisely\nthe  same  as  would  be  used  by  the  potential  class  members.\nSimilarly,  a  judgment  in  favor  of  the  named  plaintiffs  would\nbenefit the proposed  class.  A  judgment  in favor of  defendants\nwould, and  should, be binding upon  all members  of the proposed\nclass as well as the named plaintiffs.\n\n(4) Representation Adequacy\nThere is no reason to believe that the named plaintiffs and\nthe potential class members would have a conflict of interest.  The\nnamed plaintiffs appear to be ready, willing and able to represent\nthe  other  class members  fairly, adequately  and vigorously.  As\ndiscussed  above, the release of the named plaintiff A.J. has no\neffect on his ability to represent the class.\nc. Rule 23fb) (2)\nUnder Rule 23(b)(2) the proposed class first must satisfy the\nrequirements of Rule 23 (a) which, as discussed above, have been met\nin this instance.  Second, the opposing party must have acted or\nrefused to act on grounds generally applicable to a class, thereby\nmaking  final  relief  appropriate.  Defendants  make  no  separate\nargument regarding Rule 23(b)(2) class certification requirements.\nAs discussed above, the alleged actions or inactions attributed to\nthe  defendants  are  the  same with  regard  to  all  plaintiffs  and\npotential  class members.  The most  appropriate  remedy,  if any,\nunder the circumstances would be injunctive and declaratory relief.\nThis is, in part, what the named plaintiffs seek.  It also is what\nwould benefit all members of the proposed class.\n3. Conclusion\nThe  requirements  of  Rule  23 (a)  have  been  met.  The\nappropriateness of injunctive relief, if any, demonstrates that a\nclass  should  be  certified  under  Rule  23(b)(2).  The  motion  to\ncertify a class will be granted.  Plaintiffs request that the class\nconsist of all present and future detainees of the Jackson County,\n\nMissouri,  Juvenile  Justice  Center,  and  all  persons  who  were\ndetained at the center between November 15, 1984 and November 15,\n1989, who have been, or will be subjected to overcrowding, use of\nfloor mattresses, and/or other conditions of confinement injurious\nto their health and safety.\nThat description, however, begs a question:  To be eligible\nfor class membership, must a person first prove the injury which\nhe would  hope  to prove  if admitted  to the class?  Rather  than\nconditioning membership upon proof of the claim which the class\nseeks to prove, a simpler description must apply.  The class will\nconsist of persons who have been or will have been detained at the\ncenter at some time since November 15, 1984.\nIt should be noted that this class will be permitted to seek\nonly equitable  relief, e.g.,  declaratory  and  injunctive relief.\nIn the complaint, at page 9, plaintiffs pray for the court to:\nB.  Issue an order certifying this action to proceed as\na class action pursuant to Rule 23(a) and  [(]b[)](2) of the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure;\nC.  Award damages against defendants to plaintiff A.J.\nand members of the class in amounts which the jury and Court\ndeem proper;\nD.  Issue preliminary and permanent injunctions  . . ..\nBy requesting damages as well as class certification under Rule\n23(b)(2), plaintiffs apparently are seeking alternative types of\nrelief.  This  conclusion  is  compelled  by  examining  various\n8\n\nprovisions  of  Rule  23, and  the  manner  in  which  plaintiff  has\nproceeded  so  far in this case.  For instance, the text of Rule\n23(b)(2) shows it is intended to apply to equitable relief:\n(b) Class Actions Maintainable.  An action may be maintained\nas a class action of the prerequisites of subdivision (a) are\nsatisfied  , and in addition:\n(2)  the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act\non grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making\nappropriate final injunctive relief with respect to the class\nas a whole; . . .\nThe Advisory Committee Notes for the 1966 amendment to the rule\nfurther  support  the  intent  to  use  Rule  23(b)(2)  for  equitable\nrelief:\nThe subdivision  [Rule 23(b)(2)] does not extend to cases in\nwhich  the  appropriate  final  relief  relates  exclusively  or\npredominantly to money damages.\nThis interpretation is even more apparent when one considers that\nRule 23 provides for notice to class members only if the class is\nmaintained under Rule 23(b)(3).  See Rule 23(c)(2) and  (3).  If\ndamages were awarded  to a class pursuant  to Rule  23(b)(2),  for\nwhich no notice is required, disbursement of the award among the\nclass  members  would  be  a  practical  impossibility  for  lack  of\nprecise identification of the individual members.  The difficulty\nhere is particularly  obvious where, as here, the class  includes\npeople whose qualification  for the class will occur only  in the\n\nfuture, i.e., juveniles whose detention begins in the future.\nIf for some reason plaintiffs believe their prayers for relief\nshould not be viewed as alternative requests, they certainly have\nthe option to apply for leave to amend their complaint.  Now that\nplaintiffs have had the benefit of some discovery, their amended\ncomplaint, if any, could include more specific allegations than the\noriginal  complaint.  A more precise complaint, of course, could\nfacilitate a speedier disposition of this lawsuit.\nB. Preliminary Injunction\n1.  Argument\nIn the motion for preliminary injunction, plaintiffs seek an\n\"order enjoining  the defendants  from continuing  their course of\nunlawful behavior.\"  The unlawful behavior described by plaintiffs\nconsists of deprivation of Fourteenth Amendment due-process rights\nby imposing punishment on juvenile detainees.  Specifically, they\nallege punishment by way of overcrowding, use of floor mattresses,\nand confinement conditions injurious to health and safety.\n2. Applicable Law\nInjunctive relief is an equitable remedy issued as fundamental\nfairness requires to prevent irremediable harm to the movant, that\nis, \"to prevent the judicial process from being rendered futile by\nthe defendant's action or refusal to act.\"  See Wright and Miller,\n11 Federal Practice and Procedure. ยง 2947 at 423-425  (1973) and\n141-142  (1990).  See also. Rule 65(b), Fed.R.Civ.P.  Accordingly,\nthe primary function of a preliminary  injunction is \"to preserve\nthe status quo until, upon final hearing, a court may grant full,\n10\n\neffective relief.\"  Ferry-Morse Seed Co. v. Food Corn, Inc., 729\nF.2d 589, 593  (8th Cir. 1984).\nWhether preliminary injunctive relief should be granted is\ndetermined  in the Eighth Circuit by a four-factor test which was\napplied in Dataphase Systems. Inc. v. C L Systems. Inc.. 640 F.2d\n109  (8th Cir. 1981) (en bane) .  The factors are  (1) the threat of\nirreparable harm to the movant, (2) the balance between this harm\nand injury to other parties, (3) the probability that the movant\nwill succeed on the merits, and (4) the public interest involved.\nOf  these  factors,  the  threat  of  \"irreparable  harm\"  is\nparamount  in  determining  whether  a preliminary  injunction  will\nissue.  See Rathmann Group v. Tanenbaum.  889 F.2d  787, 790  (8th\nCir.  1989) ;  Nordin v. Nutri-System.  Inc.. No. 89-5243  slip op.\n(8th  Cir.  1990).  Absence  of  irreparable  injury  is,  alone,\nsufficient to deny such relief.  Dataphase. supra. 640 F.2d at 114.\nOf course, a plaintiff's failure to satisfy the other factors also\ncan defeat an injunction request.\nIn Elrod  v.  Burns. 427 U.S. 347  (1976),  the Supreme  Court\nfound that deprivation of a constitutionally protected right, even\nfor  a minimal  amount  of  time,  is an  irreparable  injury.  The\nSupreme  Court  noted  that  the  danger  of  allowing  this  ongoing\ninfringement while awaiting the determination of the merits of the\ncase was sufficiently great to uphold an injunction.  Elrod, supra,\nat 373.  In Lareau v. Manson, 651 F.2d 96, 104-105 (2nd Cir. 1981),\nthe court described conditions under which overcrowding of pretrial\ndetainees  would  constitute  punishment  and,  thus,  an\n11\n\nunconstitutional  deprivation  of  due-process  rights.  The  court\napplied a standard set forth in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 538\n(1979)  for determining when confinement conditions  for pretrial\ndetainees exceeded constitutional boundaries.\n3. Discussion\nAs  the  movants,  of  course, plaintiffs  have  the  burden  to\nestablish specific and substantial evidence supporting the request\nfor injunction.  Although the plaintiffs and the class may have\nviable claims, they have not carried their burden sufficiently to\nobtain an injunction.\nFirst, the irreparable harm has not been demonstrated.  If\nplaintiffs have been deprived of constitutional rights, of course\nthat would be irreparable harm.  However, upon A.J.'s release, the\ncontinuing deprivation  (if any) would have ceased because he no\nlonger was subjected to the center's conditions.  Absent a threat\nof continuing deprivation, the named plaintiffs' claim does not\nlend  itself  to  injunctive  relief.  Certainly  the  class may  be\nexposed  to  a  continuing  threat  of  rights  deprivation,  but  no\nsubstantial evidence of that has been established yet.  The best,\nand virtually only, showing of evidence of conditions concerns the\nconditions to which the named plaintiffs were exposed.\nThe defendants suggest that the conditions have been improved,\npermitting the possibility that the named plaintiffs' experience\nwas isolated.  That perception may seem naive.  However, the class\n(by  way  of  the  named  plaintiffs)  assumed  the  duty  to  show  a\ncontinuing threat of irreparable harm, and substantial evidence of\n12\n\nthat has not been established yet.\nThe second factor is the balance between this harm and injury\nto  others.  Deprivation  of  a  child's  constitutional  rights\nnecessarily defies quantification.  Equally difficult to quantify\nis  other  persons'  justifiable  expectation  that  they  will  be\nprotected from unruly juveniles who are believed to have committed\ncrimes.  Plaintiffs do not challenge the means by which juveniles\nare put into detention.  Without contrary evidence, the reasons for\ndetaining  juveniles  can  be  presumed  to  be  proper.  If  the\nalternative to depriving children of constitutional rights is to\nrefrain  from detaining them, then the balance does not weigh in\nfavor of the plaintiffs.\nIf the alternative to depriving  children  of  constitutional\nrights is to change the detention conditions, then plaintiffs still\nhave not carried their burden.  The injury to the operators of the\ncenter  would  arise  from  the  court's  sudden  and  unplanned\ninterruption  of the  center's  operations.  Such  an  interruption\nwould  be  the  means  by  which  conditions  would  be  changed  to\neradicate  the  alleged  constitutional  deprivations.  Even  if an\nadequate  and  viable  approach  to  changing  conditions  can  be\ndeveloped,  such  a  plan  has  not  yet  been  proposed.  Without  a\nworkable  alternative  to  the  present  conditions,  the  operators\ncannot be directed  at whim simply to cease depriving persons of\nconstitutional rights.\nThe  third  factor  is the  probability  that  the  movant  will\nsucceed on the merits.  As will be discussed below, plaintiffs'\n13\n\nclaim  cannot  be  said,  as  a  matter  of  law,  to  be  deficient.\nNevertheless, having a claim meritorious enough to pursue is a far\ncry from having a claim that probably will succeed on the merits.\nPlaintiffs have not produced sufficiently persuasive evidence to\ndemonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits.\nFinally,  the  public  interest  is  to  be  considered.  The\nexistence of detention centers is due, in part, to the need  to\nseparate  allegedly  dangerous  youths  from  the  public  pending  a\ndecision  on  what  to  do  with  them.  The  surest  way  to  avoid\nconstitutional deprivations due to the center's conditions would\nbe simply to release the detained children.  Obviously that cannot\nhappen.  The alternative must be less drastic.  Here lies the most\ntroubling aspect of plaintiffs' request for injunction.\nThe request seeks a highly laudable intermediate remedy, i.e.,\nimmediate cessation of behavior which deprives children of their\nrights.  In  the  real  world,  however,  a  preliminary  injunction\ncannot  work  unless  some  plan  can  be  devised  with  reasonable\nassurance of success.  Plaintiffs have offered no clue about how\nan injunction would achieve the relief which is sought.  The court\nis loathe to impose an injunction upon a well-established juvenile\ncenter operation without a clearly defined mission and a precise\nplan for accomplishing it.  To do anything less would undercut the\npublic  interest  which  compelled  establishment  of  the  juvenile\ncenter.\n4.  Conclusion\nPlaintiffs  have  not  shown  by  sufficient  evidence  that  a\n14\n\ncontinuing  threat  of  irreparable  harm  exists  for  either  the\nplaintiffs or the class.  Nor has a sufficient showing been made\nthat the harm to plaintiffs and the class outweighs the potential\ninjury to others.  The probability that movant would prevail on the\nmerits  has  not  been  demonstrated.  Finally,  there  has been  no\ndemonstration  of how  a preliminary  injunction  would  obtain  the\nrequested relief (even if the need for it had been shown) and still\nbe consistent with the public interest.\nC.  Dismissal\n1. Arguments\nDefendants essentially make four arguments.  First, they argue\nthat plaintiffs have no justiciable claim as required by Article\nIII  of  the  Constitution.  They  contend  that  improvements  and\nremedial measures at the center occurred before the lawsuit was\nfiled, so no claim remains to be litigated.  Second, defendants\nchallenge  the  specificity  of  the  allegations,  saying  the\nallegations  are  vague,  unsupported  and  fail  to  show  a  causal\nconnection to defendants' acts or omissions.  Third,  defendants\nargue  that  they  are  not  the  proper  parties  because  plaintiffs\ncannot prove constitutional violations directly resulting from the\ndefendants' administrative policies.  Finally, defendants contend\nthat overcrowding which results in using floor mattresses is not\na constitutional deprivation.\nPlaintiffs  begin  by  noting  correctly  that  the  motion  to\ndismiss  must  be  examined  as  a  motion  for  summary  judgment.\nDefendants  submitted  evidence  (an affidavit)  in  support  of  the\n15\n\nmotion,  rather  than  attacking  only  the  face  of  the  complaint.\nThus, defendants are challenging plaintiffs1 ability to prove their\nclaim, rather than the sufficiency of the complaint itself.  See\nRule l2(b), Fed.R.Civ.P.\nPlaintiffs first respond that defendants' corrective actions\ndo not dispose of the claims.  Plaintiffs urge that there  is a\nreasonable expectation that the wrongs would be repeated, and there\nis no assurance that these measures have eradicated the problems\ncompletely  and  finally.  Second,  plaintiffs  argue  that  the\npleadings  sufficiently  notify  defendants  that  their  actions  or\nomissions have resulted in overcrowding and other injuries which\nare  deprivations  of  constitutional  rights.  Third,  plaintiffs\nassert  that the defendants  are the proper  \"persons\" within  the\nscope  of  42  U.S.C.  ยง  1983.  Finally,  plaintiffs  argue  that\novercrowding  and  an  increased  risk  of  health  and  safety  at  a\npretrial  juvenile  detention  facility  is  a  deprivation  of\nconstitutional rights.\n2. Discussion\na. Standard for Summary Judgment\nA movant  is entitled  to summary  judgment pursuant  to Rule\n56(c),  if  the  pleadings  and  other  materials  show  there  is  no\ngenuine  issue  of  material  fact  and  that  the  moving  party  is\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.  The movant bears the\nburden of proof.  See, Aetna Life Insurance Co. v. Great National\nCorp.. 818 F.2d 19, 20 (8th Cir. 1987).  When considering a motion\nfor summary judgment, the court must scrutinize the evidence in the\n16\n\nlight most favorable to the nonmoving party, according that party\nthe benefit of every factual inference and resolving all doubts as\nto the facts or existence of any material fact against the moving\nparty.  United States v. Conservation Chemical  Co. . 619 F.Supp.\n162,  179-180  (W.D.Mo. 1985); Pierce v. Marsh, 859 F.2d  601, 603\n(8th Cir. 1988).\nIn Anderson v. Liberty Lobby. Inc.. 477 U.S. 242, 248  (1986),\nthe Supreme Court discussed the twin requirements of Rule  56(c),\ni.e.,  (1) no genuine issue of (2) material fact:\n*  *  *  As to materiality, the substantive law will identify\nwhich facts are material.  Only disputes over facts that might\naffect the outcome of this suit under the governing law will\nproperly  preclude  the  entry  of  summary  judgment.  Factual\ndisputes  that  are  irrelevant  or  unnecessary  will  not  be\ncounted.\nWhen ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the court is not to\n\"weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matters, but to\ndetermine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.\"  Id. at 249.\nWhere, as here, the party moving for summary judgment does not bear\nthe burden of proof at trial, that party must show \"that there is\nan absence of evidence to support the non-moving party's case.\"\nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett. 477 U.S. 317, 325  (1986).  This burden\nis met  when  the moving  party  identifies  those  portions  of  the\nrecord demonstrating an absence of a genuine issue of fact.  Id.\nat 423.\nIn  the  instant  case,  the  movants  have  not  carried  their\nburden.  The affidavit and pleadings do not dispel the likelihood\nthat  deprivations  of  constitutional  rights  have  occurred,  are\n17\n\noccurring, and/or will continue to occur.  Plaintiffs have alleged\nspecific  conditions  which  they  claim  entitle  them  to  relief.\nDefendants have not shown that plaintiffs will be unable to prove\nsuch conditions.  The affidavit does not show that those conditions\ndo  not  or  never  have  existed.  Furthermore,  the  defendants'\naffidavit  and  pleadings  are  directed  only  at  the  matter  of\novercrowding,  and do not address the allegations  of health  and\nsafety  problems  (such  as  fire  code  violations).  As  mentioned\nabove, courts have found that overcrowding at a pretrial detention\nfacility  can  be,  under  some  circumstances,  a  deprivation  of\nconstitutional  rights.  Defendants  have  made  an  insufficient\nshowing  to  support  a finding that plaintiffs  failed  to  state a\nclaim or that they could prove a cognizable claim.\nb. Justiciable Case or Controversy\nDefendants  contend  that  the  remedial  actions  they  took  to\nrelieve  overcrowding  have  rendered  the  plaintiffs'  claim  moot.\nThis  argument  must  fail  for two  reasons.  First,  it  does  not\naddress the alleged deprivation of rights which already would have\noccurred.  Past  wrongs,  if  any,  are  not  eliminated  merely  by\npreventing their recurrence in the future.  If plaintiffs have a\ncognizable claim arising from past conduct by defendants, they are\nnot divested of such a claim merely because the defendants manifest\nan intent to refrain from such conduct henceforth.\nSecond, the claim concerning the center conditions generally\nwould not be moot unless  (1) there is no reasonable  expectation\nthat the wrong will recur and (2) the interim relief has completely\n18\n\nand irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation.\nCounty  of Los Angeles v.  Davis. 440 U.S. 625, 631  (1979).  In\nsatisfying  these  requirements,  the  defendant  carries  a  heavy\nburden.  United  States  v.  W.T. Grant  Co..  345  U.S.  629, 633\n(1953).  The defendants' own description of the circumstances at\nthe center reveal that they have not carried that burden.\nDefendants  note  that  they  have  no  control  over  whether\njuveniles are sent to them for detention, and that an unexpected\ninflux  of  juveniles  had  created  an  overcrowding  problem.\nDefendants  described  their  efforts  to  resolve  that  problem.\nHowever, there is no reasonable assurance that they will be able\nto avoid the same problem if another unexpected influx of juveniles\narrives.  (Also, for any reason or no reason the defendants easily\ncould reverse or discontinue what they have done.)  Furthermore,\neven  if  their  laudable  efforts  would  prevent  recurrence,  they\ncannot be said to eradicate the effects of the past violations, if\nany.\nc. Notice Pleading\nDefendants argue that the factual allegations in the complaint\nare insufficiently specific.  This argument is without merit.  The\nplain language of the complaint reveals to any reader the nature\nand  substance  of the complaint, and the  factual  allegations  to\nsupport it.  The complaint alleges deprivation of constitutional\nrights by denial of due process in punishing pretrial detainees.\nThe  alleged  punishment  consists  of  exposure  to  overcrowded  and\nunsafe conditions.  The alleged overcrowding is illustrated by the\n19\n\nallegations that floor mattresses are used, and rooms are filled\nbeyond their capacity (specifically, three persons are put in rooms\ndesigned  for one  or two persons).  The unsafe conditions are\nsupported by allegations that the facility does not meet fire code\nrequirements.\nCertainly more specific  information will be needed  for the\ndefendants to assemble a defense.  However, that is a purpose of\ndiscovery.  In the meantime, the defendants have been sufficiently\napprised  of  the  facts  alleged  to  support  the  claims  in  the\ncomplaint.  Rule  8(a),  Fed.R.Civ.P.,  does  not  require  what\ndefendants would demand of a complaint.\nd.  Proper Parties\nDefendants assert that the incorrect parties were named by\nplaintiffs.  Defendants contend that they merely execute policy\ndecisions,  rather  than  formulating  policies,  and  thus  are  not\n\"persons\" within the ambit of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.  Defendants1 motion\npresented  almost  no  discussion  of  the  frequently  complicated\nbusiness of ascertaining which persons may be held liable under\nSection 1983.  Such analysis need not be presented here, either,\nunder the circumstances.  Suffice it to say that the defendants\nhave been sued in both their official and individual capacities.\nOfficials of local government  are \"persons\" under Section 1983.\nMonell v. Department of Social Services. 436 U.S. 658, 690 (1978).\nThese  officials  of  local  government  claim  they  have  taken\nsufficient  actions  to  correct  overcrowding  problems.  That\nrepresentation completely undercuts their contention that they are\n20\n\nnot the proper parties to sue.  If they are able to take actions\nto  prevent  deprivations  of  constitutional  rights,  then  they\nobviously were able to cause or permit such deprivations, if any.\nAs  such, they  would  be the proper parties  from whom  to  obtain\nrelief.\ne. Overcrowding\nDefendants  argue  that  overcrowding  is  not  per  se  a\nconstitutional violation.  They rely upon cases where  convicted\nadults were in prison.  In those situations, the standard of review\nis \"wanton and unnecessary  infliction of pain\" as guided by the\nEighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.\nCody  v.  Hillard.  830  F.2d  912  (8th Cir.  1987) (en  bane),  cert.\ndenied.  U.S.  , 108 S.Ct.  1078  (1988).  In adult prison\nfacilities  for  convicted  inmates,  overcrowding  would  not  be  a\nconstitutional  violation  because,  without  more,  it  does  not\nconstitute wanton and unnecessary  infliction of pain.  See also\nRhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337  (1981).\nA critical distinction between those cases and this case is\nthat this involves persons who have not been convicted of crimes.\nIn  Lareau  v.  Manson.  supra.  651  F.2d  at  104-105,  the  court\ndiscussed  at  length  the  circumstances  under  which  overcrowding\ncould  be  a deprivation  of Fourteenth  Amendment  due process  for\ndetained persons who have not been convicted.  The court applied\nthe standard set forth in Bell v. Wolfish, supra, 441 U.S. at 53 8.\nThe Lareau court also discussed the different standard applicable\nto overcrowding of sentenced prisoners, i.e., the Eighth Amendment\n21\n\nguarantee against cruel and unusual punishment.  The majority of\nthe court found, in the peculiar overcrowding circumstances in that\ncase, a deprivation of constitutional rights had occurred.\nAnother distinction which may be significant is that this case\nconcerns children, rather than adults.  In criminal law and in the\npenal system, the standard historically has been far different for\nadults than for children.  Conditions which are constitutionally\nacceptable for adults may well be too harsh to be constitutionally\nacceptable for children.  Thus, overcrowding conditions which pass\nconstitutional  muster  for  adults  may  be  unconstitutional  for\nchildren.\nAll of this is not to say that the conditions at the center\nnecessarily are unconstitutional.  The merits of the case remain\nto be litigated.  The particular conditions need to be identified\nand  proved  precisely  as  unconstitutional  deprivations  before\nplaintiffs  can  prevail.  In  the  meantime, plaintiffs  have  not\nfailed to state a claim, and defendants have not shown they are\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.\nD.  Protective Order\nDefendants  premise  their motion  for a protective  order  on\ntheir belief that plaintiffs do not have, or are unable to prove,\na  cognizable  claim.  First,  defendants  have  not  met  the\nrequirements of Rule 26(c), Fed.R.Civ.P., for a protective order.\nSecond, Local Rule 15(d) specifically provides that the filing of\na  motion  will  not,  by  itself,  stay  discovery.  Third,  the\ndispositive  motion  upon  which  defendants  rely  for  seeking  a\n22\n\nprotective order is being denied here, so there is no remaining\nbasis for the protection (even if such basis could be sufficient).\nThe protective order must be denied.\nIt is\nORDERED  that  plaintiffs1  motion,  filed  November  15, 1989,\nrequesting an order certifying a class is granted.  It is further\nORDERED that a class hereby is certified but only for seeking\nequitable relief and not damages, and the class shall consist of\nall persons who have been or will have been detained at the Jackson\nCounty,  Missouri,  Juvenile  Justice  Center  at  some  time  since\nNovember 15, 1984.  It is further\nORDERED that plaintiffs' motion, filed November 15, 1989, for\npreliminary injunction is denied.  It is further\nORDERED that defendants' motion, filed December 6, 1989, to\ndismiss  (considered as a motion for summary judgment) is denied.\nIt is further\nORDERED that defendants' motion, filed February 5, 1990, for\nprotective order is denied.\nDEAN WHIPPLE  //\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT ร\nDATED:  April T 1990\nKansas City, Missouri\n23",

MYERS, et. al., )\nDefendants )\nFINDING OF FACTS AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\nThe history of this case is stated  in the Court's June 10,\n1992 Order.  The Court will repeat a portion of that history for\nthe readers' convenience.\nI. Background\nOn November  15, 1989, plaintiff A.J., a 16-year-old minor,\nfiled this class action on behalf of himself and others similarly\nsituated,1 to challenge the constitutionality of certain policies,\npractices  and conditions at the Jackson County Juvenile Justice\n*The attorneys for plaintiffs repeatedly requested the Court\nto  allow  them  to  obtain  the  names of  previous  detainees.  The\nattorneys also wanted to interview previous detainees.  The Court\nrefused these requests because each youth who has been detained was\nrepresented  by  an attorney  and the youth's  attorney  could  have\nraised any concerns or complaints about the treatment of his or her\nclient with the Juvenile Court, Juvenile Officers, any members of\nthe  detention  center  staff  and  any  attorneys  representing  the\nJuvenile Officers.  To allow plaintiffs' attorneys to contact prior\njuvenile detainees could violate the attorney-client relationship\nthat existed between the youth and the attorney who represented the\nyouth at the time the youth was in detention.\n\nCenter (\"JCJJC\").2  Plaintiffs list sixty-two policies, practices\nand  conditions  which  they  allege  constitute  punishment,  in\nviolation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of\nthe United States Constitution and Article I, ยง 10 of the Missouri\nConstitution. Plaintiffs submit that these policies and conditions\ngive rise to a claim under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.  A.J. and the class\nseek permanent injunctive relief from the policies and conditions\nof the JCJJC.  Additionally, A.J. seeks monetary damages for the\ninjuries he incurred as a consequence of the JCJJCs  allegedly\nunconstitutional practices.\nThe JCJJC is a juvenile detention facility built in 1972 with\na capacity of fifty-six youths.  Each room is designed to hold one\nindividual and is approximately sixty-nine square feet in size.\nPrior to July 1990, the JCJJC was forced to house as many as three\nyouths in a room because of an unprecedented increase in the number\nof detained youths.  To accommodate the additional youths, the\nJCJJC provided them with floor mattresses.  After July 1990, the\nJCJJC terminated its practice of placing two and three youths in a\nroom.  Instead, during times of overcrowding, the additional youths\nsleep on floor mattresses in the dormitory.  At the time of the\ntrial, the JCJJC operated at less than full capacity.\nA.J. was detained at the JCJJC for a period of fifteen days,\nfrom October 31, 1989 to November 15, 1989, after he was arrested\nfor  carrying  a  concealed  weapon  at  school.  He  formally  was\n2The Court will refer to all defendants collectively as the\nJCJJC.\n\nadjudicated on the charge on November 15, 1S89.  During the period\nof A.J.'s detention, he shared a single occupancy room with at\nleast one and sometimes two other individuals.  He slept on a floor\nmattress throughout his stay because the room was only equipped\nwith one bed.  Sometime during his detention, A.J. caught a cold.\nThere was also an outbreak of pubic lice among the youths during\nA.J.'s period of detention, but he did not become infested with\nthem.  On  November  8,  1989, the  JCJJC  staff  placed  A.J.  in\nisolation for a period of forty-two minutes.  While in isolation,\nA.J. found urine on the floor of the isolation cell.\nA jury determined that a staff worker should not have placed\nA.J. in isolation and required the staff worker to pay A.J. forty-\ntwo dollars or one dollar for each minute in isolation.  The jury\nfound  the  other  defendants, including  the  JCJJC, free  of  any\nwrongdoing.\nA. Issues Ruled on by the Court\nThe Court  entered  summary  judgment on June  10, 1992, for\ndefendants on some of plaintiffs' claims and set the remainder of\nthe claims for trial.  The Court held in the June 10, 1992 Order:\n1.  The overcrowded conditions at the JCJJC did not give rise\nto a constitutional violation and did not entitle A.J. to\nmonetary damages.\n2.  The JCJJCs use of floor mattresses did not violate the\nConstitution  and  did  not  entitle  A.J.  to  monetary\ndamages.\n3.  Neither the ceilings in the JCJJC's physical plant, nor\nthe condition of the recreational facilities nor the roof\nwere  such  that  they  violated  the  plaintiffs'\nconstitutional rights.\n4.  The JCJJC did riot violate A.J.'s constitutional rights\n3\n\nbecause he caught a cold while in detention at the JCJJC.\n5.  The  JCJJC  did  not  violate  plaintiffs'  constitutional\nrights for not having an emergence generator.\nThe June 10, 1992 Order also initially granted summary judgment for\nthe JCJJC on plaintiffs' health and safety claims but in the June\n17,  1992  pretrial  conference,  the  Court  set  aside  the  summary\njudgment on the health and safety issues and told counsel the Court\nwould hear evidence on those claims.\nB. Issues at Trial\nAt  trial,  the  Court  heard  evidence  on  the  remaining  four\ncategories of issues:\n1. Health and safety claims\na. no procedures for disease detection\nb. inadequate health evaluation upon admittance\nc. unclean floors, kitchen and bathrooms\nd. insects in some of rooms\ne. inadequate and improper trash disposal\nf. inadequate lighting\ng. improper heat\nh. inadequate water temperature in showers\ni. improper storage and cleaning of floor mattresses\nj. unsafe stairwells\nk. fire code violations\n1. inadequate disaster preparedness\n2. Staff Problems\n3. Adequacy of educational services\n4. Detention of status offenders with delinquent offenders.\nII. Finding of Facts\nFrom  the  evidence  presented  at trial, the  Court  finds  the\nfollowing facts:\n1. The JCJJC was built in 1972 and has been in constant use\n4\n\nsince that time.\n2.  Residents of the detention center include both pre-trial\ndetainees and youths awaiting placement in a facility to serve\ntheir sentence.\n3. Youths charged with delinquent offenses are housed in the\nJCJJC.  Delinquent offenses are criminal offenses that~would be a\ncrime if they were committed by an adult.\n4. All offenses which do not constitute a delinquent offense\nare status offense violations.  The JCJJC does not admit a youth\nwho has only  status offense violations.  While admission  logs\nindicate that the JCJJC admits some youths who are charged only\nwith status offense violations, further examination reveals the\nyouths actually were admitted because of delinquent offenses.\n5. The JCJJC  is laid  out on three floors: the top floor\ncontains the sleeping rooms, bathrooms, shower facilities and a\ncontrol room;  the main floor contains administrative offices, a\ndayroom,  bathrooms, classrooms, isolation  rooms, holding  rooms\nadjacent  to  the  nurse's  office, visitation  room,  kitchen  and\nstorage  facilities;  the bottom  floor of the JCJJC  includes a\ngymnasium, bathrooms, laundry facilities, wood work shop and access\nto an outside courtyard.\n6. The dayroom is large and lined with windows which allow\nnatural light into the room.  It is equipped with tables, chairs,\nbooks and televisions.  The youths eat meals in the dayroom.\n7. The gymnasium is large and has outside windows allowing\nnatural light to enter.  It is equipped with a basketball court and\n\nweight equipment.  Other activities and games are available for\nrecreation.\n8. The laundry facilities are clean.  The JCJJC gives each\nresident a clean change of clothes daily and cleans all bedding\nonce a week.  Upon admission, the JCJJC gives each youth clean\nbedding, clothing, a toothbrush, a comb and other personal hygiene\nitems.\n9. All bathrooms are equipped with hot and cold running water.\n10.  Operational  water  drinking  fountains  are  found  at\ndifferent locations in the facility.\n11. All parts of the JCJJC are heated and air conditioned.\n12/ The ventilation system works properly.\n13.  One hot water heater  supplies  all  the hot water  for\nbathing, washing dishes and washing clothes.\n14.  The  JCJJC  provides  and  properly  maintains  adequate\nlighting.\n15.  A  full-time  maintenance  worker  is  assigned  to  the\nfacility.  Maintenance personnel who do not work for the JCJJC help\nwhen necessary.\n16. The JCJJC serves the youths three nutritionally balanced\nmeals a day.  The JCJJC also provides the youths with sufficient\nquantities of food.\n17. The Kansas City Missouri School District provides the\nyouths with educational programs which meet state requirements.\n18. The youths participate in school activities five days a\nweek during the school year.  The Kansas City Missouri School\n\nDistrict holds classes on the bottom floor and the main floor of\nthe facility.\n19. The JCJJC provides the youths with a regimented program to\noccupy their hours.  The JCJJC staff assign the youths with tasks\nsuch as working in the kitchen, cleaning their sleeping areas and\ncleaning the common areas in the detention center.  The 3rcJJC staff\nsupervise and assist the youths in these tasks.\n20. The youths have the opportunity to shower everyday*\n21. The youths have the opportunity to clean their sleeping\nquarters everyday.\n22. The youths remain in their sleeping rooms during normal\nsleeping hours and during the distribution of clean clothing.  The\nonly other time when the youths must remain in their sleeping rooms\nis when institutional security has been threatened and the JCJJC\nneeds to restore order.\n23. There is one bed in each of the 56 sleeping rooms.  The\npopulation of the JCJJC exceeded the 56 bed capacity starting on\nNovember  15, 1989.  The  additional youths  slept  on mattresses\nplaced on the floor of the single occupancy sleeping rooms.  In\nJuly 1990, the JCJJC moved the additional youths out of the single\noccupancy sleeping rooms and placed them in the gymnasium.  At all\ntimes,  the youths  stored  the  floor mattresses  on a metal  rack\neighteen inches off the floor in a dormitory closet when the youths\nwere not sleeping on them.\n24. The JCJJC employs a full-time nurse.  The nurse is present\nat the facility during working hours and remains on call twenty-\n\nfour hours per day.  When the nursing position is vacant, the JCJJC\ncontracts with a private nursing firm for temporary, on-site help\nuntil it can fill the position.\n25. The JCJJC is located within a few blocks of Children Mercy\nHospital and is near Truman Medical Center.  When a youth complains\nof or the JCJJC staff suspects a youth of having a serious medical\nneed, the JCJJC takes the youth to one of these medical centers.\n26. At least one doctor and usually two, visit the JCJJC once\nor twice a week.\n27. The JCJJC nurse gives each youth a medical check-up upon\nadmission to the JCJJC or as soon as the nurse can see them.\n28. The JCJJC questions a youth immediately  upon  admission\nabout  the  youth's  current  health  and  medical  history.  Also\nimmediately upon admission, the JCJJC visually inspects each youth\nfor signs of injury or illness and screens each youth for suicidal\nthoughts or tendencies.\n29. A commercial contractor adequately handles the daily trash\ndisposal at the JCJJC.  The trash dumpster is located outside the\nbuilding and has a cover to contain the trash.  The trash dumpster\nis not regularly  overfilled  and  its location does not cause  an\ninfestation of vermin which might then enter the JCJJC.\n30.  The  State  Health  Department  and  the  Kansas  City  Fire\nDepartment  inspect the JCJJC regarding  its procedures  for trash\ndisposal.  The JCJJC procedure for trash disposal complies with all\nlocal and state code requirements.\n31.  The  JCJJC  substantially  complies  with  all  local  fire\n\ncodes.  When the JCJJC discovers a violation  of the  local fire\ncode, it timely corrects the problem.  At no time did the JCJJC\ndisplay  deliberate  indifference to the safety of the juveniles.\nThe JCJJC does not expose the youths to fire dangers.  Sufficient\npolicies exist to ensure continued compliance.\n32.  The  JCJJC  regularly  conducts  fire  and  other  disaster\ndrills.\n33. The Kansas City Fire Department has never cited the JCJJC\nfor  inadequate emergency exit markings.  Since the beginning of\nthis lawsuit, the JCJJC has installed five additional exit markings\nfor fire exits in response to the opinion of plaintiffs' experts\nthat theยฏ existing fire exits markings were inadequate.\n34. The JCJJC routinely trains and tests its staff on various\npolicies and procedures regarding fire and other disaster response,\nsafety,  suicide  prevention,  use  of  isolation  and  restraint\ntechniques.\nIII. Conclusions of Law\nPlaintiffs' complaints concerning the conditions, practices\nand  procedures  of  the  JCJJC,  considered  individually  or  in\ncombination, do not raise any constitutional violations.  The Court\nwill use the same analysis as it used in its June 10, 1992 Order in\ndetermining whether the JCJJC violated plaintiffs' constitutional\nrights.  The Court will not repeat its explanation of that analysis\nhere.\nThe  Court  will  first  analyze  each  of  plaintiffs'  specific\n\ncomplaints.  Neither  one of  the  specific  complaints  raises a\nconstitutional violation.  The Court will then analyze plaintiffs'\ncomplaints considered as a whole.  Plaintiffs' complaints, even\nconsidered as a whole also do not raise a constitutional violation.\nA. Health and Safety Claims  ยฏยฏ\n1. Health Evaluation and Disease Detection\nThe Court rejects plaintiffs' complaint that the examination\nof the youths' medical conditions and needs upon admission is\ninadequate.  The JCJJC employs a full-time nurse who works at the\nJCJJC five days a week during the day shift.  In the event the\nposition' is vacant, the JCJJC contracts for the services of a\nregistered nurse to work at the JCJJC until it can hire a new\nnurse.  If  the  nurse  is present  during  admission,  the  nurse\nconducts the screening examination. When youths are admitted while\nthe nurse is not on duty, the staff at the JCJJC screen the youths\nwith the assistance of specific screening forms and charts.  The\nnurse will  later examine the newly admitted youths as soon as\npracticable. Any youth with an obvious, significant health problem\nat the time of admission is taken to one of the nearby hospitals\nfor care.  Thus, although the Constitution may not even require the\nJCJJC to provide the youths with medical  screening, Boston v.\nLafayette County. 744 F. Supp. 746, 754  (N.D. Miss.  1990), the\nJCJJC does provide the screening and does so reasonably well.\nThe evidence does not support plaintiffs' argument that the\nstaff  fails  to  identify  youths with  communicable  diseases  and\n10\n\nallows youths with communicable diseases to interact freely with\nthe  other  youths  at the JCJJC.  Plaintiffs' evidence  about  an\noutbreak of chicken pox shows, at the most, that between May 29,\n1990 and June 17, 1990, five youths suffered from chicken pox and\nthree of those cases occurred in the JCJJC at one time.  In all\nfive cases, the staff isolated the youths and the infection did not\ncontinue.  The JCJJC reasonably handled the situation.\nPlaintiffs  complain  about  other  incidents  of  measles,\nhepatitis, staph infections, head or pubic lice and ring worm at\nthe facility.  Each incident proved nothing more than an isolated\nincident  which  did  not  lead  to  wholesale  infection  of  the\npopulation of the JCJJC.  It would be unrealistic for this Court to\nrequire the staff to maintain the JCJJC disease-free.  Plaintiffs\ncite no authority for the proposition the Constitution requires as\nmuch.  Only  if  the  staff  show  deliberate  disregard  for  such\noutbreaks and the treatment of the youths will the Court find a\nconstitutional violation.  Estelle v. Gamble. 429 U.S. 97, 105-06,\n97 S. Ct. 285, 50 L. Ed. 2d 251  (1976).\nThe  incidence  of  youths  becoming  infected  with  childhood\ndiseases or head lice is no greater in the JCJJC than is faced by\nthe teachers and staff of public schools.  The Court finds that the\nJCJJC  provides  a  reasonable  level  of  medical  screening  and\ntreatment.  Plaintiffs  fail  to  demonstrate  the  JCJJC  staff  is\nindifferent to the medical needs of the youths.\n2. Bathrooms\nThe evidence demonstrates that the staff acts reasonably to\n11\n\nkeep the bathrooms clean and working properly.  While the bathrooms\nare not kept absolutely clean at all times, this Court cannot\nrequire the JCJJC to keep the bathrooms clean at all times.  The\nJCJJC admitted nearly 3 000 youths in 1989 and over 2,000 in 1990\nฦ\nand 1991.  Where bathroom facilities are used by a sizeable number\nof people, toilets will stop up, one may occasionally find urine or\nwater on the floor. However, the evidence does not demonstrate the\nconditions in the bathrooms were substandard or that the conditions\ninjure the health of the youth.  Cf. Fambro v. Fulton County. 713\nF. Supp. 1426, 1431 (N.D. Ga. 1989) (\"When sanitary conditions are\nin question, the court must concern itself with whether substandard\nsanitation endangers the health of the jail occupants.11).  When\nproblems with conditions in the bathrooms occur, the staff at the\nJCJJC  take  appropriate  action  to  correct  and  alleviate  the\nproblems.\nYouths help to clean the bathrooms under the supervision of\nthe custodial or staff employees.  Giving the youths these chores\nis a valid manner of handling the cleaning duties if for no other\nreason than to teach the youths discipline and responsibility.  The\nyouths may not clean the bathrooms as well as professionals, but if\nthe staff finished the work that the youths failed to do, the staff\nwould undermine the purpose for having the youths help clean.\nPlaintiffs  state  the JCJJC  does not have  enough  sanitary\nfixtures.  Although plaintiffs' argument is not clear, the Court\nassumes plaintiffs are complaining about the ratio of toilets,\nshowers and bathroom sinks to the number of youths at the JCJJC.\n12\n\nPlaintiffs  do  not  tell  the  Court what  ratio  the  Constitution\nrequires only that in March and again in August of 1990, the number\nof bathroom fixtures was \"inadequate.\"  The Court will not find a\nconstitutional violation based on an expert's testimony that during\na  two-month  period  the  number  of  bathroom  fixtures  was\n\"inadequate.\"  See, Bell v. Wolfish. 441 U.S. 520, 543, 99 S.Ct.\n1861, 60 L. Ed. 2d 447  (1979)  (\"We  simply do not believe that\nrequiring a detainee to share toilet facilities and this admittedly\nrather small sleeping place with another person for generally a\nmaximum period of 60 days violates the Constitution.\").\n3. Food Preparation\nAn ยฏ expert for plaintiffs reported a leak in a pipe under a\nvegetable preparation sink, a leak in the valves for the pipes\nunder the dishwasher, missing or stained ceiling tiles and lint on\nor behind air registers.  At the time of the trial, the JCJJC was\nin the process of replacing the missing or stained ceiling tiles.\nIn 1992, the JCJJC thoroughly cleaned the entire ductwork and the\nmaintenance worker periodically cleans the ductwork. The local and\nstate health departments evaluated the JCJJC s food preparation and\nfound only minor problems.  The JCJJC corrected the problems the\nlocal  and  state  health  departments  found.  No  evidence  was\npresented to show that the JCJJC failed to comply with local health\nstandards in operating the kitchen area in the center.  The Court\nfinds the conditions during food preparation do not violate the\nConstitution.\n13\n\n4. Floors\nLogs of the JCJJC indicate that the floors were dirty.  Once\nagain,  the  Court  is  more  interested  in  what  is  done  when  a\nunsatisfactory condition is found.  With the JCJJC being used close\nto or over capacity, one can anticipate that the floors would need\nconstant attention.  The evidence demonstrates the JCJJC and the\nyouths clean the floors under the supervision of the JCJJC staff.\nPlaintiffs' evidence from the logs of the JCJJC that the floors\nwere  repeatedly  found  dirty  does  not  adequately  show  that  the\nfloors  were  left  in  that  condition.  Instead,  the  evidence\nindicates the JCJJC corrected the condition when so found.  The\nevidence does not support an argument that the condition of the\nfloors violated the constitutional rights of the youths.\n5. Insects\nThe  JCJJC  suffers  from  persistent  problems  with  mice  and\ninsects, however, the staff have worked continuously to alleviate\nthe problems by contracting with exterminators to treat the JCJJC\non a monthly basis.  While the problem exists, mice and insects are\nnot running around the JCJJC unchecked.  An investigator for the\nMissouri  Division  of  Family  Services  spent  forty  hours\ninvestigating the JCJJC and did not testify to seeing any mice or\ninsects.  Further, the staff  at the JCJJC take  active  steps at\neliminating the problem.  When the staff discovered an exterminator\nwas performing poorly, they fired the exterminator.  The staff have\nnot shown deliberate  indifference to the problems with mice and\ninsects.  Green  v.  Baron,  879  F.2d  305,  309  (8th  Cir.  1989)\n14\n\n(minimum deprivation does not violate the Constitution)  (citing\nBell. 414 U.S. at 539).\n6. Garbage\nThe JCJJC deposits its garbage in a trash dumpster provided by\na trash hauling company.  Plaintiffs argue the JCJJC permits mice\nto enter the trash dumpster because the lid does not~completely\nshut  when  the  trash  dumpster  is  occasionally  overfilled.\nPlaintiffs argue that the mice might then find their way into the\nJCJJC itself.  However, plaintiffs only point to a single day when\nthe trash dumpster was overfilled.  The trash hauling  company\nempties the trash dumpster daily.  The manner in which the JCJJC\ndisposes of its garbage is satisfactory and does not violate the\nConstitution.\n7. Lighting\nPlaintiffs cite five standards for support that the lighting\nin the JCJJC  is inadequate: the Missouri Rules, Food and Drug\nAdministration guidelines, Missouri state food service regulations,\nAmerican Correctional Association Standards and American Public\nHealth Association standards.  National or industry standards can\nprovide a court with some degree of guidance but do not have the\nforce of law.  Johnson v. Busby. 953 F.2d 349, 351 (8th Cir. 1991);\nPatchette v. Nix. 952 F.2d  158, 163  (8th Cir. 1991).  Further,\nstandards Missouri  may  set, do not prescribe  a  constitutional\nminimum. Shelby County Jail. 798 F.2d at 1088 n.3.  A court may\nconsider  the  standards  along  with  other  forms  of  evidence  in\nassessing the constitutionality of certain institutional practices.\n15\n\nGary H. v. Heqstrom. 831 F.2d 1430, 1432-33  (9th Cir. 1987).\nIn  attempting  to  demonstrate  that  the  lighting  and  other\nconditions violate the Constitution, plaintiffs point out that the\nJCJJC  violates  various  standards  and  codes  such  as:  Missouri\nDepartment  of  Health,  Consumers  Product  Safety  Commission\n(regulations as to water temperature); American Society ยฏรตf Heating,\nRefrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers (standards for heating\nand  air  conditioning)  and  American  Correctional  Associations.\nPlaintiffs did not present any evidence the JCJJC must conform its\nconduct to any of these standards.  As the United States Supreme\nCourt explains:\nRespondents' reliance  . ..  on correctional  standards\nissued  by  various  groups  is  misplaced  [citation  to\nnumerous  professional  codes,  including  American\nCorrectional Association Manual of Standards for Adult\nCorrectional  Institutions]  . . ..  And  while  the\nrecommendations  of  these  various  groups  may  be\ninstructive  in  certain  cases,  they  simply  do  not\nestablish  the  constitutional  minima;  rather,  they\nestablish  goals  recommended  by  the  organization  in\nquestion.  For  this  same  reason,  the  draft\nrecommendations of the Federal Corrections Policy Task\nForce of the Department of Justice regarding conditions\nof  confinement  for  pretrial  detainees  are  not\ndeterminative of the requirement of the Constitution.\nBell.  441  U.S.  at  543  n.27.  In  upholding  a  district  court's\nexclusion of jail standards, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals\nheld  that  the  jail  standards  \"do  not  represent  minimum\nconstitutional standards.\"  Johnson v. Busbv. 953 F. 2d 349, 352\n(8th Cir. 1991) .  The court in Johnson also held that \"experts'\nopinions  as  to  desirable  prison  conditions  do  not  establish\nconstitutional standards.\" Id. at 351  (citing Rhodes v. Chapman,\n452 U.S. 337, 348-49 n.13, 101 S.Ct. 2392, 69 L. Ed. 2d 59 (1981)).\n16\n\nSee also. Gary H., 831 F.2d at 1433 (9th Cir. 1987) (The \"wholesale\nadoption of various professional associations' concepts for model\ninstitutions  as  if  they  were  constitutionally  mandated  was\nunwarranted.\").\nThe evidence at trial was that the JCJJC had never received\nany complaint about inadequate lighting.  The JCJJC mounted steel\nplates on the windows in the dormitory hallways after drive-by\nshootings occurred  in the area.  Plaintiffs complain the steel\nplates  reduce the amount  of natural  light that  can enter  the\nsleeping rooms, but the youths rarely use the sleeping areas for\nanything other than sleep.  The youths spend the rest of their days\nin other areas of the JCJJC where plaintiffs agree are adequately\nilluminated.\nPlaintiffs' expert testified at trial that the lighting in the\nwalk-in freezer did not meet national or industry standards.  The\nJCJJC improved the lighting in the walk-in freezer and throughout\nthe kitchen in response to plaintiffs' complaints.  Plaintiffs'\nexpert agreed that the lighting where the JCJJC staff prepared the\nfood was adequate.\n8. Room Temperatures\nPlaintiffs cite repeated entries from the supervisors' log\nstating that the dorm areas were cold in the winter and also in the\nsummer.  The Court has no evidence as to what the temperatures\nwere.  Log entries also state the JCJJC staff gave the youths\nadditional blankets.  To fix the problem, the JCJJC installed a new\nenergy management system in late 1990 or early 1991 which controls\n17\n\ntemperatures  throughout  the  JCJJC.  Once  again,  defendants\nrecognized a problem and acted to correct the problem by installing\na new control system.  Plaintiffs failed to show that the JCJJC\nignored or failed to timely correct the problem.  Instead, until\nthe JCJJC could install a new temperature control system, the JCJJC\nissued  additional  blankets to the youths.  The JCJJC did not\nviolate  the youths' constitutional  rights with  regards to the\ntemperature in the JCJJC.\n9. Water Temperatures\nPlaintiffs' constitutional claim about water temperature puts\nthe JCJJC in an untenable position.  Plaintiffs' expert testified\nthat the water in one of the bathroom sinks was 139 degrees which\nexceeded the Consumer Products Safety Commission, the Underwriters'\nLab  and  the  American  Public  Health  Association  recommended\ntemperature setting of 120 degrees. The same water heater supplies\nhot water for the laundry and kitchen.  When the JCJJC reduced the\ntemperature setting, plaintiffs' same expert complained that the\nwater temperature was not hot enough for the laundry and kitchen.\nThe difficulty the JCJJC experiences because it only has a\nsingle water heater is a far cry from Fambro v. Fulton County. 713\nF. Supp. 1426 (N.D. Ga. 1989) which plaintiffs rely on.  In Fambro.\nthe court found that when the showers do work, \"they often blast\nextremely hot or cold water.\"  .Id. at 1427.  While the JCJJC's\nshowers  and  bathroom  sinks may  be hotter  or  colder  than  some\norganizations advise, the water is not extremely hot or extremely\ncold.\n18\n\nDefendants testified that they requested funds to install two\nmore water heaters with one dedicated to the kitchen and the other\nto be used only for the laundry.  This would allow the JCJJC to use\nthe present water heater only for the showers and the bathroom\nsinks.  The final approval had not been made at the conclusion of\nthe trial.\nRegardless of the approval of the additional water heaters,\nthe JCJJC is not violating the constitutional rights of the youths\nwith the present water temperatures. While the single water heater\nis not ideal, it does not violate state or federal law.  The JCJJC\nis acting reasonably to try and correct the problem.\n10. Storage and Cleaning of Floor Mattresses\nPlaintiffs' expert testified that when he inspected the JCJJC\nin March  1990, he found mattresses stored on the floor in the\njanitor's storage closet. The expert then testified that janitors'\nclosets  can  frequently  be  dirty  and  if  moisture  is present,\ncockroaches and mice can be present.  Plaintiffs' expert failed to\nproduce evidence as to the actual condition of the closet where the\nmattresses are stored.\nThe  evidence  is contrary  to the testimony  of plaintiffs'\nexpert.  The  evidence  indicates  the JCJJC does not  store  the\nmattresses on the floor in the janitors' closet rather, the JCJJC\nstores the mattresses on a metal rack eighteen  inches off the\nground in a dormitory closet.  Each mattress has a protective cover\nand is cleaned daily.  The JCJJC is storing the mattresses in a\nsatisfactory manner and there is no constitutional violation.\n19\n\n11. Stairwells\nPlaintiffs argue the stairwells are too narrow and are not\nequipped to prevent one of the youths from pushing others over the\nrailings.  In short, plaintiffs argue the stairwells at the JCJJC\npose a significant safety and security hazard.\nHowever, plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Vince Carbone, testified that\nthe width of the stairwells in question is adequate and that he did\nnot know the height of the guard  rail.  None of the evidence\npresented even suggests the design of the stairwells caused any\ninjuries to the youths or that the design of the stairwells is\npunitive  or  that  the  staff  of  the  JCJJC  are  deliberately\nindifferent to the youths' rights.  The design of the stairwells\ndoes not violate the youths' constitutional rights.\n12. compliance with Fire Codes\nPlaintiffs' expert testified that the fire safety procedures\nat the JCJJC were inadequate as they were not in compliance with\nthe National Fire Protection Association Life Safety Code 101.\nThe National Fire Protection Association Life Safety Code advises\ninstitutions to mount lighted exit signs over all emergency exits.\nPlaintiffs' expert testified that the JCJJC did not mount\nlighted exit signs over the emergency exits.  Despite the National\nFire Protection Association Life Safety Code, the JCJJC's exit sign\nmarkings meet local fire codes.  Plaintiffs do not allege the lack\nof  lighted  exit signs violates state or local  fire and safety\nrequirements.  Even if the JCJJC's practices do not comply with a\nstandard plaintiffs' expert prefers, the Court will not hold the\n20\n\nJCJJC's  fire  and  safety  practices  unconstitutional  when  the\npractices comply with state and local requirements and when the\nstate  and  local  requirements  themselves  are  adequate.  The\nConstitution does not require ideally safe conditions.  Bell. 441\nU.S. at 543 n.27.  The JCJJC is not deliberately indifferent to\nplaintiffs' safety.\nPlaintiffs' expert contends the JCJJC does not request routine\nfire inspections.  The Kansas City Fire Marshall conducts regular\nfire  inspections  at  the JCJJC.  The  Court will  not  impose a\nspecific schedule on the JCJJC or the Kansas City Fire Marshall.\nThe only fire inspection the JCJJC failed occurred in March 1992.\nThe JCJJC promptly remedied the problems discovered in the fire\ninspection and passed the May 1992 fire inspection.\nPlaintiffs point out the JCJJC places its smoke detectors\nabove the ceiling.  The smoke must pass through a ceiling register\nbefore  it  reaches  the  smoke  detector.  The  short  answer  to\nplaintiffs'  concern  is  the  placement  meets  state  and  local\nrequirements because fire inspections do not complain about the\nplacement.  Plaintiffs' expert found plywood blocking a register\nleading to the smoke detector.  The JCJJC does not explain why the\nplywood was necessary, however, the JCJJC removed the plywood.\nOnce again, the JCJJC demonstrated that when a problem was pointed\nout, the JCJJC corrected the problem.\n13. Inadequate Disaster Preparedness\nThe National Fire Protection Association Life Safety Code also\nadvises institutions to conduct fire drills on each shift every\n21\n\nthree months.  Plaintiffs note that at one point, the second shift\ndid not conduct a fire drill in over seven months.\nThe JCJJC presented testimony that each shift held a fire\ndrill once a month.  The daily schedules which begin in April 1990\nsupport this testimony.  Plaintiffs do not dispute that since April\n1990,  the  JCJJC  held  an  adequate  number  of  fife  drills.\nPlaintiffs' expert, however, stated at trial that he talked to a\nJCJJC  employee  who works  on  the  second  shift.  According  to\nplaintiffs' expert, the employee told him that the second shift had\nnot had a fire drill in over seven months.\nPlaintiffs' argument that one shift, on one occasion failed to\nconduct ยฏ a  fire  drill  in over  seven months  lacks  credibility.\nAgain, plaintiffs admit that since April 1990, the JCJJC held an\nadequate number of fire drills.  Plaintiffs did not present the\nemployee who allegedly made the remarks to plaintiffs' expert;\nplaintiffs did not provide any additional support that the second\nshift  failed  to  conduct  a  fire  drill  in  over  seven  months.\nFinally, plaintiffs do not provide any authority for the Court to\nhold  that  a  single  failure to hold  a  fire drill  in the past\nviolates the youths' constitutional rights.  In short, plaintiffs\nquite  simply  fail  to provide  the  Court  with  any  evidence  or\nauthority to determine that the JCJJC violated the constitutional\nrights of the youths who resided at the JCJJC.\n22\n\nC. Adequacy and Training of Staff\n1. staffing Levels\nPlaintiffs  complain  that the staffing  level at the JCJJC\nviolate the NAC Standards, the ACA Standards and the eight to one\nyouth-to-staff  ratio  prescribed  in ยง  11.2  of the Appendix  to\nMissouri Rule 111.03.  As the Court already explained, \"\"reliance .\n. . on correctional standards issued by various groups is misplaced\n. . . and while the recommendations of these various groups may be\ninstructive in certain cases, they simply do not establish the\nconstitutional minima.\"  Bell. 441 U.S. at 543 n.27.  While the\nAppendix to Missouri Rule 111.03 does prescribe a ratio, the rule\nitself does not. Also, a violation of Missouri's Appendix does not\nequal a violation of either the state or federal constitutions.\nShelby  County  Jail.  798  F.2d  at  1088 n.3.  More  importantly,\nhowever, the JCJJC generally does meet the eight to one ratio.\nThroughout most of 1991 and 1992, the youth to staff ratio was near\nor better than eight to one.  Most days on which a shortage of\nstaff was noted, the JCJJC found a backup person.3\nAt times when admissions rose, the JCJJC did not meet the\n3Some difficulty also exists in computing the ratio.  If the\nnumber of staff used in calculating the ratio includes all help at\nthe JCJJC, not just staff whose sole responsibility is to maintain\ncontact with the youths, the ratio improves even more than as\nreported.  As  calculated,  the  ratio  does  not  include  cooks,\nteachers  from  the Kansas  City  Public  Schools, and  maintenance\nworkers.  All these individuals are necessary to comply with the\nstatutory  requirement  of  \"continued  availability  of  adequate\npersonnel  capable  .  ยท  ยท of  maintaining  the  purposes  of  the\nfacility.\"  Rule lll.O3(d) (2).  While not necessary to this Court's\ndecision, if the ratio includes the entire staff, the JCJJC would\nmeet the advised eight to one ratio without difficulty.\n23\n\nratio, but it timely took steps to hire additional staff.  The\nJCJJC acknowledges 1989 staffing levels were lower than desired,\nbut when the staff became aware that the increase in population\nwould continue, they took immediate action to obtain additional\nstaff.  The Juvenile Court Judge and Juvenile Court Administrator\nworked from late 1988 through early 1989 to get county approval to\nhire  additional  staff  for  the  JCJJC  and  for  other  county\nresidential services.  This was the proper way for the JCJJC to\nproceed and the Court is at a loss as to what else plaintiffs feel\nthe JCJJC should have done.4\nThe JCJJC took steps to remedy the staffing shortage.  At the\ntime of trial, the JCJJC generally meets the advised ratio of one\nstaff member for every eight youths.. Regardless, plaintiffs do not\n4The parties presented evidence and extensively discussed in\ntheir post-trial briefs the continuing problem of obtaining enough\nfunding to operate and staff the JCJJC.  The JCJJC constantly must\nlobby the county and state legislatures to obtain adequate funding.\nAll too often federal courts have entered into the legislators'\nrealm of allocating public funds.  A problem some federal courts\nexperience is they erroneously believe the only way to remedy the\nproblem  is through  spending  all the money  the  experts  say  is\nnecessary to correct the problem.  While additional spending is\noften necessary to remedy a violation of a constitutional right,\nuncontrolled spending may ultimately reduce the amount a state or\ncounty can spend on other individuals similarly situated thereby\ndepriving others of their constitutional rights.  The Court is\nmindful that a state or county cannot prevent a federal court from\nfashioning a remedy, but federal courts should be wary of entering\na role best left to legislators. Compare. Missouri v. Jenkins. 495\nU.S. 33, 68, 110 S.Ct. 1651, 109 L. Ed.2d 31 (1990) (Kennedy, J.,\nconcurring  in part)  (Giving the power to tax to the state and\nfederal legislative branches was to make sure that the power to tax\nwas \"under the control of those who are taxed.\") with Marbury v.\nMadison. 5 U.S. (I Cranch) 137, 163 (1803) (The Chief Justice John\nMarshall declared, the \"government of the United States has been\nemphatically termed a government of laws and not of men.  It will\ncertainly  cease to deserve  this high  appellation,  if the laws\nfurnish no remedy for the violation of a vested legal right.\")\n24\n\npresent any evidence that the staffing levels have ever approached\na level that would violate the constitutional rights of the youths\nin the JCJJC.\n2. Staff Training\nPlaintiffs complain the JCJJC fails to maintain an adequately\nqualified, trained and supervised staff.  These failure's allegedly\nviolate Missouri's statutory requirement that \"adequate personnel\ncapable, by training or experience, of maintaining the purposes of\nthe facility\" be available.  Missouri Supreme Court Rule  111.03\n(d)(2).\nPlaintiffs specifically complain about the JCJJCs  practice\nconcerning  isolation,  mechanical  and  physical  restraints.\nPlaintiffs argue that the problem with these practices stem from\nthe training manual.  The training manual in effect at the time of\nthis suit was adopted  in 1984 and the staff  operated  under  the\nmanual until the JCJJC revised the manual in 1991.  The manual sets\nforth policies on the operation of the JCJJC and it specifically\naddresses the use of isolation, physical restraints and mechanical\nrestraints.  All new employees receive forty hours of orientation\nregarding the operation of the JCJJC within the first six months of\nemployment.  All employees have periodic discussions with their\nshift supervisors regarding the policies and procedures of the use\nof isolation and restraints.\nIn determining the adequacy  of training, the Court must be\nmindful of the United States Supreme Court's pronouncement:\n[T]he problems that arise in the day-to-day operation of\na  corrections  facility  are  not  susceptible  of  easy\n25\n\nsolutions.  Prison  administrators  therefore  should  be\naccorded  wide-ranging  deference  in  the  adoption  and\nexecution  of  policies  and  practices  that  in  their\njudgment  are  needed  to  preserve  internal  order  and\ndiscipline and to maintain institutional security\n.  . . .  'Such considerations are peculiarly within the\nprovince and professional expertise of the correctional\nofficials, and, in the absence of substantial evidence in\nthe  record  to  indicate  that  the  officials  have\nexaggerated their response to these considerations, the\nCourt should ordinarily defer to their expert judgment in\nsuch matters.\nBell.  441 U.S. at 547-48  (citations omitted).  The  Constitution\nrequires only minimally adequate training and a reasonable balance\nbetween liberty interests and the institution's operational needs.\nGary H. . 831 F.2d at 1432.  The staff receives adequate training\nbefore  they  begin  work  at  the  JCJJC  and  continue  to  receive\ntraining .while working at JCJJC.\nAlthough  the manual  does  not  specifically  discuss  how  the\nstaff  should  handle  different  situations  that  might  arise,\ntestimony at trial notes that the JCJJC never intended the manual\nto set forth detailed rules for every conceivable contingency which\nmight occur.  To provide such a manual would make it so large that\nno one would read it.\nPlaintiffs presented evidence through their expert witnesses,\nfrom supervisors' logs, isolation logs and incident reports which\nthey  claim  demonstrate  juveniles  were  placed  in  detention,\nisolation or restrained in violation of the manual.  The  Court\nstarts with the premise that it is \"not the duty of the district\njudge to fashion operating manuals for . . . institutions.  It is,\nhowever,  the  duty  of  the  federal  courts  to  make  certain  that\nminimal constitutional rights are preserved.\"  Gary H. . 831 F.2d at\n26\n\n1432.  This Court only needs to find that the manuals were and are\nadequate to meet  constitutional  requirements  and  the  Court so\nfinds.\nThe appropriateness of placing a juvenile in isolation is best\ndetermined by the officer who is present at the time the situation\noccurs.  When an incident occurs, the staff person off the scene\noften must  act promptly  to gain control  of the  situation  and\nmaintain order in the JCJJC.  Reading about the incident in a\nreport can only give any reader a sterilized version as to what the\nsituation was and what occurred.  The Court also finds that the\nsupervising staff have acted to correct any incidence of incorrect\napplication of the manual and have not shown careless indifference\nto the right of the juveniles.\nThis Court will not evaluate every staff worker's application\nof the manual.  The Court finds that the supervising staff has\nacted properly in correcting any staff workers who did not follow\nthe manual correctly.  Plaintiffs never show the staff has ever\nshown deliberate indifference with regard to the rights of the\nyouths.\nC. Educational Services\n1. Adequacy of Education\nPlaintiffs  complain  the  JCJJC  failed  to  provide  adequate\neducational programming as required under Missouri law:\n\"[t]he school districts . ..  in which county- or court-operated\nfacilities for the care and protection of juveniles are located\n27\n\nshall provide appropriate educational programs for those juveniles\nof school age who have not been graduated for the twelfth grade and\nwho are placed in such facilities.\"  Mo. Rev. Stat. ยง 178.296.\nSection 4.3 of the Appendix to Missouri Rule 111.03 provides in\npart, that โข'[e]very attempt should be made to maintain continuity\nwith the juvenile's local/home educational program.\" ยฏยฏ\nPlaintiffs claim the educational program at the JCJJC does not\nmeet the standards of those in public  schools.  Specifically,\nplaintiffs argue the youths do not participate in class five hours\na day and at times, the JCJJC staff workers instruct the youths,\nnot teachers from the Kansas City School District.\nTheยฏ parties stipulated that the Kansas City, Missouri School\nDistrict provides the educational services for the JCJJC.  When\nteachers from the Kansas City School District fail to show up to\nteach, the JCJJC staff workers substitute as teachers.\nIn  1989,  at  the  same  time  the  population  at  the  JCJJC\nincreased  substantially,  a  Division  of  Family  Services\ninvestigation questioned the adequacy of the educational program at\nthe JCJJC.  When the JCJJC was advised of the problem it corrected\nthe problem.  No problems with the educational program occurred\nsince 1989.\nThe  Kansas  City  School  District  provides  the  educational\nprogram and the JCJJC does not control how the Kansas City School\nDistrict administers the program.  If plaintiffs wish to challenge\nwhether the youths are receiving an education that meets ยง 178.296,\ntheir fight is with the Kansas City Public School District and not\n28\n\nwith any of the parties in the present case.\nPlaintiffs  challenge  to  the  adequacy  of  the  educational\nservices is also based on the directive in ยง 4.3 of the Appendix to\nMissouri Supreme Court Rule 111.03 which recommends that every\nattempt should be made to maintain continuity with the juvenile's\nlocal/home educational program.  The evidence demonstrates the\nJCJJC made reasonable efforts to maintain continuity in the youths'\neducational program.\nOnce again, the Court recognizes that the administrators and\nstaff of the JCJJC constantly operate under frustrating staff and\nbudget restraints and when a problem arises, they promptly set\nabout toยฏ resolve the problem.  Plaintiffs presented no evidence\nshowing at any time the JCJJC was deliberately indifferent to the\nconditions or status of the youths.\nB. Access to Education\nPlaintiffs  claim  that  many  youths  are  denied  sufficient\nclassroom time.  The specific complaint again concerns 1989 when\nthe JCJJC experienced a rapid population increase.  To handle the\nincreased  population, the  JCJJC divided  the youths  into three\ngroups and taught each group on a rotating basis.  While not an\noptimal situation, the short period of difficulty during 1989 did\nnot  violate  the  youths'  constitutional  rights.  Despite  the\ndifficulty, each youth had  access to and received  an adequate\neducation.  The JCJJC worked with the Kansas City Public Schools to\ncorrect the problems it had with the increased population and the\n29\n\nproblems with providing each youth with access to education has not\npresented a problem since the 1989 difficulty.\nD. Confinement of Status Offenders\nPlaintiffs allege the JCJJC houses status offenders in the\nJCJJC together with delinquent offenders.  Evidence presented at\ntrial  established  that  status  offenders  are  youths  who  have\ncommitted  offenses  other  than  crimes.  Status  offenders  are\ngenerally  considered  to  be  in  need  of  the  assistance  of  the\njuvenile court because they have been abused or neglected and are\nwithout proper care, custody or support.  Status offenders usually\nneed immediate protective custody to prevent personal harm to the\nyouth.  Delinquent  offenders  are those  individuals  accused  of\ncommitting an act that would violate a criminal law if they were an\nadult.\nMissouri law permits the detention of status offenders and\ndelinquent offenders for up to twenty-four hours without a court\norder.  To hold a status offender for more that twenty-four hours,\nthe authorities must obtain a court order.  The JCJJC cannot house\nstatus  offenders  with  delinquent  offenders.  42  รผ.S.C.  ยง\n5633(a)(12)(A).\nPlaintiffs  point  to  a  monthly  report  which  notes  status\noffenders held with delinquent offenders.  Testimony from Juvenile\nOfficer Geoffrey Allen established that the monthly report only\nlists one offense that an admitted youth is charged with.  If the\nfirst offense a youth is charged with is a status offense, then the\n30\n\nmonthly report will note only that the youth is charged with a\nstatus offense.  The State of Missouri conducts an annual audit of\nthe JCJJC to monitor performance with regard to detention of status\noffenders.  None of the parties could tell the Court of a single\ninstance when  the Missouri  audit  found  a status  offender  was\ndetained in violation of the law.  Plaintiffs failed to produce any\ncredible  evidence that the JCJJC housed  status  offenders with\ndelinquent offenders.\nE. Summary of Individual Constitutional Claims\nPlaintiffs failed to show that considered individually, any of\nthe alleged violations amounted to violating the constitutional\nrights of the youths at the JCJJC.  The evidence does not support\nplaintiffs' arguments that the staff was deliberately indifferent\nto the rights and welfare of the youths.  On the contrary, the\nevidence  consistently  supports  the  JCJJC's  position  that  when\nproblems occurred, it took timely steps to resolve them.  While the\ncounty and state legislatures are not as responsive to the needs of\nthe youths as the Court would like them to be, the Court cannot say\nthat either the conditions or the practices of the JCJJC violate\nthe youths' constitutional rights.\nF. The Complaints Viewed Collectively\nPlaintiffs rely on three cases to support their position that\nthe  health  and  sanitary  conditions  at  the  JCJJC  violate  the\nConstitution.  Tillery v. Owens. 907 F.2d 418 (3rd Cir. 1990); D.B.\n31\n\nv. Tewksburv, 545 F. Supp. 896 (D. Ore. 1982); Ahrens v. Thomas\nf\n434 F. Supp. 873  (W.D. Mo 1977).  Plaintiffs' reliance on these\ncases is not well placed.  A reading of those cases reveals severe\nconditions which would shock a courts' sense of decency.  Such\nshocking conditions do not exist at JCJJC either individually or\nconsidered as a whole.  A review of those cases will show that the\nconditions in those cases differ dramatically from the conditions\nin the present case.\nIn Tillery. inmates at a state correctional institution sued\nover the conditions existing at the institution.  Inmates could not\nexercise during the average two-year stay because their cells were\nso small- that \"when the district judge entered one of the small\ndouble cells during his inspection tour, he 'was unable to turn\naround  once  inside  it and had  to back  out'11  and because many\ninmates understandably refused to leave their cells for fear of\nphysical assault.  The institution did not provide the inmates with\nclothing.  Instead,  inmates often borrowed underwear, jackets,\ntowels and bedding from other inmates for either money or sexual\nfavors.  The institution could best be characterized as filthy:  a\n\"sizable  bird  population\"  dropped  \"feces  on  the  floors  and\nrailings\";  most toilets in the cells were old and cracked and\nunusable during repairs \"resulting in the accumulation of human\nwaste for as long as two days\" and in the showers, the smell was\nsuch that the district court judge \"wondered how any inmate could\ntolerate the physical conditions of the shower long enough to wash\nhimself.\"  Tillerv. 907 F.2d at 422-424.\n32\n\nThe conditions at the JCJJC do not resemble those in Tillery.\nThe sleeping rooms at the JCJJC are larger than those in Tillery\nand the JCJJC no longer places two or three youths to a sleeping\nrooms during times of overcrowding.  The JCJJC provides exercise\nand recreational areas which the youths can use without significant\nfear of physical assault and also provides the youths with cloths\nand  bedding.  The  full-time  maintenance  worker  together  with\ncustodians  and  the youths themselves keep the JCJJC generally\nclean.\nThe  second  case plaintiffs  rely  on, Tewksburv.  concerned\nyouths held in an adult county jail which did not have a twenty-\nfour-hour screening process or any guidelines whatsoever regarding\nadmission.  Tewksburv. 545 F. Supp. at 899.  The county jail did\nnot allow the youths to wear underwear under their prison clothing.\nPrivacy screening did not exist for the toilet and shower stalls  โ\nrevealing the youths to corrections officers.  Youths in isolation\nslept on concrete floors and had only a sewer hole in the cell\nfloor as a toilet which, when flushed, gushed water and sewage onto\nthe floor.  Id.  The youths did not receive regular, nutritional\nmeals.  Jd. 900.  Finally, the jail did not screen the youths for\nmedical problems upon admission, did not provide for regular doctor\nor nurse visits to identify or attend to the medical needs of the\nyouths and also did not provide emergency medical care.  Id.\nIn contrast, the JCJJC provides each youth with clothing,\nincluding underwear, upon admission.  The toilet and shower stalls\nare generally  clean and private.  Each youth  in isolation has\n33\n\nadequate toilet facilities.  The JCJJC provides three nutritional\nmeals a day to each youth.  Finally, the JCJJC screens each youth\nupon admission for medical problems, a nurse is always available,\neither at the JCJJC itself or on call.  A doctor also regularly\nvisits the JCJJC to examine youths with medical problems.\nIn  Ahrens.  a  pretrial  detainee  challenged  the\nconstitutionality of the conditions at the one hundred year old\nPlatte County Jail.  Ahrens. 434 F. Supp. at 876 & 890.  The\naverage stay of a pretrial detainee was three to four months.  The\njailers confined the detainees to their jail cell areas at all\ntimes and did not give the detainees an area  for exercise or\nrecreation.  The  jailers  did  not  provide  clean  bedding  or\nmattresses; the jailers did not give detainees clothing or items\nfor basic hygiene  and  the  lack of a regular  cleaning  program\nresulted in an extremely dirty jail.  An emergency evacuation plan\nfor  fire or other disasters did not exist and  doctors do not\nregularly visit the facility.  Some toilets lacked seats, some did\nnot flush with sufficient force to remove human feces;  women and\nyouths did not have any privacy in their cell's toilet areas.  The\nlack of a mechanical ventilation system resulted in damp, still air\nand  increased  the  likelihood  that  the  inmates  would  suffer\nasphyxiation in the event of a fire.  Id. at 890-895.\nThe facts in the present case differ greatly from those in\nAhrens.  Unlike  Ahrens.  the  JCJJC  provides  recreational  and\nexercise areas.  While the bathrooms are not spotless, they are\ngenerally clean and the toilets are screened for privacy.  Each\n34\n\nyouth receives clean bedding and at a minimum, a clean mattress;\nthe JCJJC provides each youth with clean clothing and items to\nmaintain  personal hygiene.  The staff  at  the JCJJC  regularly\nconduct disaster drills and a full-time nurse as well as regular\ndoctor  visits  meet  the  medical  needs  of  the  youths.  The\nventilation system at the JCJJC works well.\nThe conditions described in these cases are in sharp contrast\nto the conditions plaintiffs presented  to this Court as being\nsevere enough to be considered constitutional violations requiring\nthis Court to issue an injunction.  The conditions in the present\ncase do not begin to approach the conditions described in the above\ncases.  ยฏ Instead, considering the conditions at the JCJJC as a\nwhole, the plaintiffs' cases indicate this Court must find the\nconditions at the JCJJC are constitutional because they pale in\ncomparison to cases in which other courts found the conditions\nunconstitutional.\nIV. Conclusion\nPlaintiffs present exhaustive evidence on the operation of the\nJCJJC to attempt to prove that the constitutional rights of the\nresident  youths  have  been violated.  Plaintiffs  place  special\nemphasis throughout their arguments on the notion that the JCJJC\ndoes not meet the standards of some professional organizations.\nWhile the JCJJC may not meet the standards of plaintiffs' selected\nprofessional  organizations,  none  of  the  standards  of  the\norganizations  prescribe  the  constitutionally  mandated  minimum\n35\n\nstandards that the JCJJC must meet.  If the Court did find that the\nJCJJC violated the constitutional rights of the youths, the Court\nwould grant injunctive relief and direct what corrections the JCJJC\nwould  need  to make..  However, the JCJJC  did  not violate  the\nconstitutional rights of the resident youths.\nThe Court remains vigilant in protecting the constitutional\nrights of adults and youths alike, whatever their situation.  The\nsituation of the youths is often grim.  The youths in the JCJJC\ncome from an array of backgrounds which make them hard to manage\nwhen placed in a restricted environment of a detention center.  The\naverage youth detained in the JCJJC is not a young person raised in\na stable home and community environment.  The vast majority of the\nyouths in the JCJJC raised themselves on the streets of Kansas City\nwith  minimal  parental  or  adult  guidance.  The  youths  are\nstreetwise, accustomed to surviving by their own instincts and\nreach adult behavior patterns at an early age.  Many of the youths\nin the JCJJC know that until they turn seventeen years old, they\nmay engage in criminal activity without much fear of being required\nto answer to an adult court for their criminal activity.  For too\nmany of these youths, their detention in the JCJJC is the first\ntime  anyone  subjected  them  to  discipline  of  any  consequence.\nUnfortunately, for many of the youths, their stay in the JCJJC is\nonly one of many encounters they will have with law enforcement\npersonal and is a prelude to their graduation to the adult criminal\njustice system.  A trier of fact cannot approach this case with the\nidea that the youths in the JCJJC are \"children\" that have been\n36\n\nmisunderstood by their parents.  Instead, the majority are harden\njuvenile  offenders mature  far  beyond  their  age.  Despite  the\nyouths' grim situation and no matter how vigilant this Court is in\nprotecting their constitutional rights, this Court cannot find that\nthe JCJJC violated the constitutional rights of the youths.\nThe  Court  therefore  finds  for  defendants  and  against\nplaintiffs on all issues.\nDEAN WHIPPI\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n$Pร  2fi  fรฐfli\nDATED:\n37",
