The class consisted of all juveniles who were confined in the detention centers. Private counsel represented the class. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief and damages, alleging that the conditions at the juvenile detention centers violated the constitutional guarantees of due process and freedom from unreasonable seizure, punishment, and to cruel and unusual punishment. </p><p>According to the complaint, the detention centers were overcrowded and inadequately staffed. The overcrowding and understaffing increased the risk of inmate-on-inmate violence. The health care, classification system, recreation, and educational programs were all inadequate. </p><p>On September 30, 1994, the case was consolidated with Simpson v. Britt (Docket No. 94-00581).</p><p>After discovery and negotiation, the parties reached a settlement agreement. On February 22, 1995, the District Court (Magistrate Judge Denson) approved a settlement agreement. The agreement provided for a reduction in the number of juveniles confined in the detention center, a good faith effort to provide additional staff, the development and implementation of a medical care plan, a mental health care plan, and the development and implementation of an educational plan. Additionally, a behavior management system was specifically outlined. The defendant was required to standardize intake procedures, develop and implement a classification system, provide recreation and programming, and develop and implement a policy regarding visitation, telephone use, and mail. </p><p>The case was dismissed with prejudice on January 20, 1998. </p><p></p>",

ROBIN BRITT, Secretary of Human\nResources,  etal,\nDefendants.\nSUBSTITUTE\nSECOND AMENDED\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\nPursuant to Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, with permission of the court,\nplaintiffs amend their complaint to state, as follows:\n\nr  r\nPreliminary Statement\n1.  This is a suit in equity for injunctive relief by juveniles detained by the New\nHanover, Pitt, Cumberland, Leonard, Gaston, Buncombe and Wilkes Juvenile Detention Centers\nbased on overcrowding, understaffing, inadequate medical care, lack of legally required\nprograms and other conditions of confinement which deprive plaintiffs of their constitutional\nrights.  It is brought by the named individuals as a class action on behalf of all persons confined\nat the detention centers.\nJurisdiction\n2.  This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. Sections 1331 and 1343 for a cause of\naction under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983.\nParties\n3.  Antwan Simpson, Shaune Kimbrough and Stephanie Hall are United States\ncitizens under the age of sixteen who, as of the date when the original complaint was filed, were\ndetained at detention centers operated by the Division of Youth Services (DYS) of the North\nCarolina Department of Human Resources (DHR).\n4.  Jaime Patterson is a United States citizen under the age of sixteen who is being\ndetained at the Cumberland Regional Juvenile Detention Center, operated by the Division of\nYouth Services of the North Carolina Department of Human Resources.\n5.  Kris Shontee Davis is a United States citizen under the age of sixteen who is\nbeing detained at the Buncombe Regional Juvenile Detention Center, operated by the Division of\nYouth Services of the North Carolina Department of Human Resources.\n\nr  r\n6.  Edward Williams is a United States citizen under the age of sixteen who is being\ndetained at the New Hanover Regional Juvenile Detention Center, operated by the Division of\nYouth Services of the North Carolina Department of Human Resources.\n7.  Alphons Mitchell is a United States citizen under the age of sixteen who is being\ndetained at the New Hanover Regional Juvenile Detention Center, operated by the Division of\nYouth Services of the North Carolina Department of Human Resources.\n8.  C. Robin Britt is Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Human\nResources and is responsible for the activities of the Department, including the detention of\njuveniles.  He is sued in his official capacity only.\n9.  Gwendolyn C. Chunn is Director of the Division of Youth Services and is\nresponsible for the care of juveniles committed to her custody by the courts.  She is sued in her\nofficial capacity only.\n10.  Tommie Clark is the Manager of Detention with supervisory responsibility over\nthe DYS detention centers. He is sued in his official capacity only.\nFacts Supporting Claim\n11.  These six detention centers operated by D YS are designed to house no more than\n103 children.  Within the past year these centers have often had a population in excess of\ncapacity, at times more than double their capacity.  Although the detention centers are designed\nto house each child in an individual room, due to overcrowding many children have to sleep on\nmattresses on the floor of rooms.  Confinement of more than one child to a room leads to\nconflicts and fights which are contrary to the goals and purposes of the detention centers and\ncreate a danger of serious injury to detained children.\n3\n\nr  r\n12.  Staffing is inadequate for the number of children detained.  Inadequate staffing\ncauses a reduction in services, such as curtailment of exercise periods and the educational\nprograms, and causes children to be locked in their rooms for longer periods of time to facilitate\nsecurity and control, all of which are contrary to the goals and purposes of the detention centers.\n13.  Because of the vast overcrowding and understaffing, the medical care provided to\nplaintiffs is inadequate, posing a serious and substantial health hazard.\n14.  The detention centers are used to house juveniles with a variety of different\nbackgrounds and problems, from undisciplined children who have merely run away from home,\nto juveniles accused of serious or deadly felonies, both those who will be adjudicated by the\njuvenile court and some who may be bound over for trial as adults. The mixture of these groups\nin one facility, in combination with understaffing and overcrowding, creates a danger of assaults\nand other victimization of some juveniles by others. Although DYS officials have attempted to\nalleviate this problem by creating the Leonard Center especially for bound-over youth, the\nLeonard facilities are insufficient to house all bound-over youth.\n15.  The lack of spaces in state training schools and other youth facilities and an\noverload of cases in the juvenile courts means that juveniles are often detained at the detention\ncenters for longer periods of time than is consistent with purposes for which the juveniles are\ndetained.\nClass Action Allegations\n16.  Although the impact of conditions on different children may vary, all juveniles at\nthese detention centers suffer from the same conditions creating common questions of law and\n\nr\nfact for all putative class members.  The population and identity of the detained children is\nconstantly changing, and it would be impracticable to join each child in the lawsuit.  The claims\nof the named plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the class, and the named plaintiffs will\nadequately protect the interests of the class. The defendants have acted or refused to act on\ngrounds generally applicable to the class, and prosecution of separate actions would create a risk\nof inconsistent adjudications or of individual adjudications which would as a practical matter be\ndispositive of other class member claims.\nClaims\n17.  Plaintiffs and the plaintiff class are being deprived of liberty without due process\nof law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  The\npurposes of incarceration of juveniles are to provide for their welfare and protection.  Where\nthose purposes are not served, the state has no justification for detaining juveniles, and their\ndetention thus violates due process guarantees.\n18.  Plaintiffs and the plaintiff class are subjected to unreasonable seizure, punishment,\nand to cruel and unusual punishment, in violation of their rights under the Fourth, Eighth, and\nFourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.\nRelief\nWHEREFORE, plaintiffs request:\na)  That the court enjoin defendants from detaining any greater number of juveniles at\neach Detention Center than it is designed to house;\nb)  That the court enjoin defendants to employ adequate staff to provide a safe and\nsecure environment for members of the class;\n\nr\nc)  That the court enjoin defendants from detaining any juveniles unless and until\ndefendants provide all legally required services, such as education, which provide the\njustification for detention of juveniles;\nd)  That the court award costs and attorneys fees to plaintiffs, and provide such other\nrelief as is just and proper.\nMarvin  SparrowU\nN.C.

Until these consolidated actions are dismissed, Defendants will document the daily\npopulations for each named center.  Each Tuesday, by 11:00 am, Defendants will\nmake available to counsel for the Plaintiffs-the daily population count for each named\ncenter for the preceding week.  For the purposes of this agreement, daily populations\nare those taken at 8:00 am.  Average weekly population for each named center is the\nseven-day total daily populations beginning each Tuesday, divided by 7 and rounded\ndown to a whole number.\n3.
