There is an insufficient number of toilet\nfacilities, including showers, sinks,\nand commodes,  to meet  the needs of the\naverage daily population of males.  Since\na plan for the short-term  overpopulation\nproblem haa not yet been developed, the\nDepartment will reserve any decisions re-\ngarding the necessity  to expand toilet\nfacilities at  the present time.\n03. The boys1 wing  Is acutely  overcrowded.\nEven though additional quarters in a\nseparate building  for approximately ten\n(10) boys arc currently  utilized,many\nboys are regularly  required to sleep on\ncots or mattresses Bet out in the day-\nrooms in the evening due to an inauffi-\ncient number of sleeping rooms. Since the\nfacility has been housing twenty-five to\nthirty (25-30) boys in the main building\nand an additional eight to ten (8-10) boys\nin the other building on a regular basis,\na more acceptable arrangement must be de-\nveloped to meet  the housing needs of\nthese juveniles.\n94.

L8669-78\nSTATE OF NEW JERSEY\n/  (Office of the Public Defender,\nDepartment of the Public Advocate)\nIN THE INTEREST OF P.H., et. al., Civil Action\nPlaintiffs, AFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT OF LITIGANT'S\nRIGHTS\n-v-\nPASSAIC COUNTY BOARD OF CHOSEN\nFREEHOLDERS, et. al.,\nDefendants\nSTATE OF NEW JERSEY:\n: SS\nCOUNTY OF MERCER  :\nJoseph DeJames, of full age, being duly sworn according to law, on his oath says:\n1.  I am the Director of the Juvenile Detention and Monitoring Unit\nfor the New Jersey Department of Corrections.\n2.  Pursuant to NJSA 2A;4-57 & 3O;1B-1 et. seq., the New Jersey Department\nof Corrections is required to specify, or approve, all secure facilities\nfor the detention of juveniles in New Jersey.\n3.  In accordance with statutory responsibility and applicable provisions\nof the New Jersey Administrative Procedure Act, the Department of\nCorrections has promulgated a Manual of Standards for Juvenile Detention\nFacilities  (NJAC lOA:32).\n4.  The Juvenile Detention and Monitoring Unit conducts periodic inspections\nof all juvenile detention facilities in New Jersey to ensure compliance\nwith the Manual of Standards for Juvenile Detention Facilities.\n5.  In accordance with the provisions of the Manual of Standards for Juvenile\nDetention Facilities regarding bathing and toilet facilities, sleeping\nquarter space, activity space, and staffing requirements, the Department\nassigned a maximum capacity of 22 juveniles to the Passaic County\njuvenile detention facility.  Because of severe overcrowding, the Depart-\nment increased the maximum approved capacity to 35 juveniles by granting\na variance to Passaic County in 1981 to renovate a portion of a trgiler\n\nïge 2\nin the rear of the main detention building for use as dormitory sleeping\nquarters for 13 juveniles.  This variance, which represents the first\ntime that the Department granted a variance for a dormitory in a juvenile\ndetention facility, was granted because of an immediate need to ease the\novercrowding problems, including the sleeping of juveniles on mattresses\non the floor, and because the County was in the process of developing\narchitectural plans for the construction of a new juvenile detention\nfacility.\n6.  On June 4, 8, and 9, 1982 the Juvenile Detention and Monitoring Unit\nconducted an inspection of the Passaìc County juvenile detention facility.\nAttached to this affadavit is a true copy of a report issued by the Depart-\nment on June 16, 1982 which delineates the conditions which were noted\nduring the three day inspection (Attachment I). The major problem areas\ndue to extreme overcrowding identified in the report include:  insufficient\nphysical space for sleeping, dining, and activities; insufficient bathing\nand toilet facilities; fire safety problems; educational program deficiencies;\nrecreation and visiting limitations; laundry and linen problems; and\nincreased maintenance and sanitation problems.  During the 155 days\nbetween January 1 and June 4, 1982, the facility exceeded capacity on\n147 days.  Within the month preceeding the inspection juveniles were\nrequired to sleep on mattresses on the floor on a number of occasions\nbecause of the lack of beds and space.\n7.  Pursuant to a December 11, 1978 court order (Superior Court of New Jersey,\nLaw Division-Passaic County, Docket No. 8669-78), the County of Passaic\nwas prohibited from housing more than the approved number of juveniles\nestablished by the Department of Corrections unless the Department was\nnotified by the Office of the Passaic County Prosecutor and a court hearing\nwas held.  The Department of Corrections has not received any notice in\nthis regard  (Attachment II).\n8.  In accordance with the abovementioned December 11, 1978 order, Passaic\nCounty was directed to forthwith provide for the long-range juvenile\n\nkge 3\ndetention needs of the County either through new construction or renovation\nand expansion of current facilities.  Subsequently, the Juvenile Detention\nand Monitoring Unit worked with Carlton Lee, AIA, of the architectural firm\nof Lee & Lee, through April 1980 in the development of architectural plans\nfor the construction of a new juvenile detention facility.  The final plans\nwere approved by the Department of Corrections in correspondence of April 18,\n1980 (Attahcment III).\n9.  Because the Passaic County Board of Freeholders failed to act on the construc-\ntion project, further court action was taken by the Office of the Public\nDefender and an additional order was made by the court on March 17, 1981.\nA detailed construction schedule was established in this order which called\nfor the commencement of construction no later than Novermber 16, 1981\n(Attachment IV).\n10.  The Juvenile Detention and Monitoring Unit received a copy of correspondence\ndated November 6, 1981 from Passaic County Counsel, Martin Verp, to\nWilliam J. Bizub, Esq., of the Office of the Public Defender, requesting\nan extension of time to complete the required construction project.  The\nproposed revised schedule indicated that the County would award bids for\nconstruction of a new juvenile detention facility on March 10, 1982\n(Attachment V).  The Department agreed to acquiesce to the request.\n11.  The Juvenile Detention and Monitoring Unit worked with the architectural\nfirms of Flatt and Poole and Gruzen and Partners through March 1982 in\nthe development of entirely new architectural plans.  The final plans\nfor the project were approved by the Department of Corrections in correspon-\ndence to the Passaic County Board of Freeholders dated March 5, 1982\n(Attachment VI).\n12.  The County has not acted on these construction plans.  The Juvenile\nDetention and Monitoring Unit was informed in a telephone communication\non June 22, 1982 with Paul Rusiniak, Construction Official for the Township\nof Wayne, that the construction plans and documents had not yet been\nreceived by his office for review and approval of the BOCA Code standards\n\nage 4\nas required by the New Jersey Uniform Construction Code Act (P.L. 1975,\nC. 217).\nJoseph DeJames, Dir¾p4:or\nJuvenile Detention & Monitoring Unit\nNew Jersey Department of Corrections\nSÍ.\nDate:\nSworn and subscribed to\nbefore me this 24th day\nof June, 1982\nElaine.W.
