We have concluded our investigation and we are\nwriting to inform you of our fin¢!lnqs.\nOur investigation consisted of a thorough tour of the\nYouth House by an outside consultant, as w«ll as intorviowa\nwith administrators, staff, and residents. We analyzed\nrelevant documents, including the policy and proc·sdur·?3 manual,\npopulation statistics, fira drill procedures, intak? procedures,\nincident rsçorts? rules and regulations, tha New Jersey\nManual of Standards for Juvenile Detention Facilities, and\nthe most recently available report prapar·*d by the K¾w Jersey\nJuvenile Detention and Mcnitorin<j unit o? the Department of\nCorrections-  Cur consultant revíow»d s<?v=rai ferns utilized\nby the Youth SOUSÍÎ and examined records maintained at the\nfacility.  At all tim·?>s, sta/:f, adr>inistration and county\nofficials were courteous and cooperative to Dtìpartînent of\nJustice-; r^presontativ»s.  PI •ease express wy appreciation to then.\nIt was apparent throughout our investigation that\nimprovements hav^? b#»en ma<îo at the £ssex County Youth House\nin r¾c*înt months.  Howevor.. we have concluded that in scvaral\ndiscrete ar·3as.· juveniles ars suhject^cí to flagrant or ecjr¾çiou3\nconditions which deprive thsm of certain ot their constitutional\nrights.  Thc?s«^ conditions include:\n1.  Inadequate  fire  saf·=>ty\n2.  Abu¾n,  víoîonc¯¯!  and  arbitrary  administration o?.\nounishwont;\n3.  Unsanitary  and  unsafe  environmental  conditions;  and\n4.  O`/ercrowding.\n\n-2-\nIr. making these findings, we wera cognizant that many juveniles\nheld at th* facility ha'^ not be-an convicted of any crime;\nrather, they are pra-adjudication detainees or only have been\nadjudged delinquent.  The appropriate legal standard that\nmust be applied to the treatment of these juveniles is whether\nrestrictions on liberty beyond initial incarceration are\nrsasonably relatsd to some legitimate government objective  —\nrehabilitation, safety, or internal order and security.  Bell\nv. Wolfish, 441 D.S. 520 (1979); see also Santana v. Collazo,\"\n714 F.2d 1172, 1130 (1st Cir. 1983).  For those juveniles\nwho have been convicted of crimes, the broad standard to be\napplied is the Eighth Amendment's proscription against cruel\nand unusual punishment.\n1.  Fire Safety\nPervasive firs hazards exist at the Essox County Youth\nHouse.  Flammable liquids aro located in many of the living\nareas, often surrounded by rags, discarded paper and other\ncombustible materials.  Our consultant concluded that these\nitems could easily become ignited.  Some mattre-sses appear to\ncontain polyurethane or other toxic materials.  Exposed\nelectrical wiring and exposed light sockets are present\nthroughout the facility, most alarmingly in several shower\nareas.  Considering that there has been a fire at the Youth\nBousa within the past year, these hazards pose an obvious and\nreal threat.\nIn view of the considerable fire hazards throughout the\nYouth House, the facility's lack of adequate moans to respond\nto fire3 represents a serious problem.  Most staff and all\nresidents interviewed were unaware of tho proper procedures\nto be followed in the event of fire.  Most staff had not\nreceived adequate training or instruction as to the procedures\nto be followed in event of a fire emergency.  Additionally,\nthe facility lacks an adequate, operable smoke and fire\ndetection system.  Many firs* alarms and most smoke detectors\nare nonfunctional.  Even when operable, our consultant concluded\nthat smoke detectors are inadequate for this type of facility\nsince they are residential-type datsctors.  Many emergency\nlights and fire doors are broken.  Finally, most fire\nextinguishers are in need cc  recharging and ar=? incorrectly\npositioned.  These conditions pose unreasonable risks to the\nsafety and lives of youths confined in th^ facility.\n2.  Abuse, Violence and Arbitrary Administration of\nPunishment\nSerious incidents of violence occur with uncommon\nfrequency in the Youth House.  Moreover, many sarious incidents\n\n~3 —\napparent] y qo unr^ported.  While many reports reviewed  indicated\nonly minor incidents, the nurabor of serious incidents represents\na significant problem at the facility.  Furthermore, our\nconsultant concluded that many incidents of abuse are inaccurately\nreported or not reported at all.  These facts indicate a\nbreakdown in the facility's ability to ascertain, control or\ncorrect abusive ataff behavior.  Indeed, the recent arrests\nof seme staff from the Youth Houss highlights serious problems\nat the facility with respect to detecting abuse and taking\nsufficient stsns to eliminate offensive conduct by staff.\nThe Youth House also lacks adequate security measures\nin many respects•  The entrance to the facility is not adequately\nsecured.  Law enforcement officials are permitted to bring\nweapons into the facility, as an obvious breach of security.\nSecurity is further broached by the facility's inability to\nconsistently conduct accurate counts of youths held ther?.\nFurthermore/ the use of handcuffs and other restraints aro\ninadequately monitor3d.  Additionally, cur consultant concluded\nthat physical restraints are used absent adequate iustification.\nOther measures imposed on juveniles are tantamount to\npunishment without any reasonable governmental objective.\nFor example, although the Essex County Youth Rouse has an\nextensive set of rules, these are never provided to the\nresident youths.  In most units, rules are learned only when\nbroken.  This creates an arbitrary system for disciplining\nresidents.  Moreover, the actual punishments imposed by staff\nare arbitrary and capricious.  The arbitrary imposition of\npunishment by staff is inconsistent with the proper legal\nstandard which requires that such acts be justified by some\nreasonable governmental objective and be undertaken in a\nnon-capricious manner.\n3.  Snvironnental Conditions\nThe Esssx County Youth House is unsanitary and unsafe.\nConditions subject residents to serious risk to their health.\nDuring our tour, our consultant noted mice droppings and roach\ninfestation throughout the facility.  While the facility has\napparently made an offort to exterminate these pests, such\nefforts have boen unavailing due- to the absence of adequate\nhousekseping policies, reasonable sanitation practices,\nan adequate waste disposal system, and other measures designed\nto maintain the facility in a sanitary condition.\nDuring our tour, some living areas and nearly -^vary\nbathroom rseksd of an overwhelming smell of urine.  This\nproblem is caused/  in part, by inadequate maintenance and\n\n-4-\nhousekoeping practices and the lack of access by residents\nto toilets during evening hours.  Moreover, many youths\nsleep on torn mattresses, ripped sheets or no sheets at\nall.  Frequently, essential supplies, including toilet\npaper, are lacking at the facility.  The facility does not\nprovide basic personal hygiene materials to youths held at\nthe facility for as long as several months.  These deficiencies,\ntaken together, represent serious threats to the health of\nresidents-\n4.  Overcrowding\nMany of the unconstitutional conditions of confinement\ndescribed above stem directly from or are exacerbated by\nsevere overcrowding at the Youth House.  The county has been\nconsistently confining youths at the Youth House at over 200%\nof its capacity.  This crowding has strained the facility's\nability to provide adequate sanitation and permit essential\npersonal hygiene.  The overcrowded conditions contribute to\nthe high incidence of violence, make safe emergency evacuation\nless probable, and place considerable stress on an already\nA-  rapidly deteriorating physical plant.  Finally, during severe\n;i:  periods of crowding, youths are forced to sleep on the floor\n/  without mattresses, and basic linens and blankets have been\n^•'  unavailable.  The impact of crowding on the facility's ability\n\"•'.,.  to protect youths from undue risks to their safety and health\n;*V  is so severe as to constitute a constitutional deficiency.\nf  Minimally Required Remedies\nf  '  The conditions described above have been present at the\n;  Youth House for some time and at least since September 199 4.\nThey are flagrant as well as egregious, and deprive the\nyouths confined at the Essex County Youth House of their\n;:^;  constitutional rights.  The conditions require the immediate\n£  remedial action by county officials.\nV-\nRemedial measures must be taken to ensure that the\nv  youths are not deprived of the rights guaranteed them under\nthe Constitution of the United States.  We propose to entsr\ninto a legally binding and judicially enforceable agreement\nwith Essex County designed to eliminate violations of the\nyouths' rights, achieve constitutionally adequate conditions,\nand provide a means by which compliance may be verified.  The\nT  following minimum measures are necessary to remedy the\n;'••  violations described above:\n!*. •  1.  Adequate fire safety practices and procedures,\n[?•:  including those for emergency evacuation, must be implemented\ni£ '  as soon as practicable.  Sufficient and functional fire\n\n-5-\nsafety equipment mu3t be provided and staff must be trained\nin their use.  Fira hazards must be removed immediately;\n2.  Rules governing punishable offanses and the administration\nof punishment must be made available to all staff and youths..\n3.  Measures must be taken, including the promulgation\nand implementation of security procedures and tho development\nof an accurate incident raportinq system, to protect th«\nyouths from unreasonable risks of harm;\n4.  Sanitation and hygieno measures must be improved;\n5.  Policies and procedures designed to prevent\nunconstitutional overcrowding must bo developed and implemented.\nDuring periods of crowded conditions/ the Youth House must\nimplement procedures designed to raduca the affects of\novercrowding.\nTo the extent possible and in the spirit contemplated by\nthe Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, we wish to\ncooperate with the government of Essex County to seek adequate\nremedies which do not compromise the legitimate security and\nadministrative needs of the Youth House.  We stand prepared\nto make our expert consultant's report available to assist\nyou in devising remedies necessary to eliminate the\nunconstitutional conditions at the Essex County Youth House.\nOur attorneys will contact the Office of the County\nCounsel within the next two weeks to discuss this matter\nfurther.  I look forward to working with you to resolve these\nmatters in an amicable and reasonable manner-\nSincerely.\nWm» Bradford  Reynolds\nAssistant  Attorney  General\nCivil  Riahts  Division\ncc:  David  Ben-Asher\nCounty  Counsel\nJessica  DeKoninck\nAssistant  County  Counsel\nRonald  Mansella\nDirector,  Youth  Services  Division\nJames  Oliphant\nYouth  House  Unit  Managar",

      "text": "U.S. Department of Justice\nU.S. v. Essex County\nIIIIIIIII\nJ -NJ-0002-0003\nWBR:AEP:MHN:RJS:j ac\nDJ  168-14-14  Washington. D.C 20S30\n3UN 1 5 1988\nMr.  Henry Del Plato\nSection Chief\nHealth and Public Functions\nOffice of County Counsel\nHall of Records\nNewark, New Jersey  07102\nRe:  United States v. Essex County\n(Essex County Youth House)\nDear Mr. Del Plato:\nI am writing to inform you and your client of the findings\nof our tour of the Youth House, May 13-14, 1988.  At the outset,\nboth Jack Greene and I would like to express our appreciation to\nall staff who spoke with us.  The purpose of the compliance tours\nand the resulting comments are to assist you in your progress\ntowards full compliance with the negotiated consent decree.\nEmergency Evacuation\nIt is apparent that the Youth House has implemented the fire\nevacuation plans.  Nearly all youths interviewed testified about\ntheir knowledge of the emergency evacuation procedures.  However,\nin its efforts to formulate plans and conduct regular fire\ndrills, the facility has failed to provide an emergency mechanism\nto release youths from their locked rooms. —^¿J^»c /*d`/**- *¿s»^- *Jf\nWe observed that a significant percentage of the doors to\nthe youths' rooms are old wooden doors with old undependable <£·*\nlocks.  Staff interviewed attested to this problem.  Under the\npresent procedure should a key break in a lock the unit staff\nmust either await arrival of maintenance personnel who could\nextricate a youth or attempt to remove the youth using homemade\nself-help techniques.  In a crisis this practice would lead to an\nincreased risk of harm to staff and youth alike.  Thus, in order\nto implement an adequate means of emergency evacuation, the Youth\nHouse should take immediate steps to assure unit staff have\naccess to the necessary tools  (i.e. axes, crowbars, lock cylinder\ncores, etc.) to release residents from their rooms.\n\n- 2 -\nStorage of Flammable/Combustible Materials\nWhile the facility has improved in its handling and storage\nof flammable and combustible materials, problems still exist.\nProblems noted during the tour and visit include, but are not\nUMitea to:  ^\nPoisonous cleaning fluids stored in containers labeled\n\"Grape Juice\";\nPoisonous and flammable photo development chemicals/\nfound in garbage cans in unit mop rooms; _ urt¿t> AA/****^\nCleaning fluids found in plastic bottles in all unit\nstorage closets.  Some storage areas were locked, others\nwere not; _^ unM ¡^ ^ JL\n4.  Lack of inventory control of cleaning fluids in units;\n5.  Paint thinners, stains, etc. not properly supervised in\nthe wood shop areas of the vocation school; *¿,· t¿  rf\n6.  Chemicals stored in non-ventilated closets.\nThe facility must insure that unit staff conduct both the\nperiodic checks of the living units in accordance with the\nstated policy and remove-all flammable and combustible materials.\nAll cleaning fluids must be properly labeled, secured and\nregularly inventoried.  It may be helpful to develop a reporting\nand inventory mechanism which would provide better management\nand accountability.\nFire Extinguishers\nDuring the course of the tour the following deficiencies\nwere identified:\n1.  Several extinguishers were without inspection tags;\n2.  Several extinguishers had expired inspection tags;\n3.  Foam suppression system in the kitchen had expired;\n4.  Poor placement of extinguishers (i.e. in the rear\nof dark closets, on the floor not properly hung, etc.)\nIt is imperative that the facility have all extinguishers\nproperly inspected and tagged to reflect that they have been\ninspected.  While the facility fire marshal produced an invoice\nfrom a recharging company, there must exist an accurate\naccounting mechanism which unquestionably reflects the current\nstatus of all fire safety devices.\n\n- 3 -\nPersonal Hygiene Items and Clothing\nWhile the facility has more than enough underwear (49\ndozen), bras (14 dozen), polo shirts (510), socks  (62 dozen) and\npants (547 pairs) its distribution of clean clothing to the\nyouths is nothing short of being unsanitary and a possible form\nof abuse.\nYouths interviewed stated that socks, underwear and towels\nare exchanged once per week.  Pants, polo shirts, etc., are\nexchanged weekly.  In order to wear clean clothing many youths\nhave their parents bring clean underwear for them.\nThe youths should have their socks, underwear, towels, etc.\nexchanged daily rather than weekly.  Other clothing items should\nbe exchanged twice per week rather than weekly.\nThe youths should also be issued suitable clean bedding and\nlinens, to include two sheets, pillow and pillowcase, mattress\nand sufficient blankets to provide comfort under existing\ntemperature controls.  Presently, youths are not provided pillow\nand pillowcases.  Many rooms were also absent blankets.\nAdditionally, the youths must be provided articles necessary\nfor maintaining proper personal hygiene.  At the time of the\nvisit there were on inventory 45,000 bars of soap, 144 5 02.\ntubes of toothpaste, 720 toothbrushes, 96 containers of\ndeodorant, and 1,264 combs.  Many youths reported that,\nnotwithstanding the large amount of supplies on hand, they were\nforced to have parents supply them with toothpaste, deodorant and\ncombs.\nSurely shortages will exist from time to time; however, a\nmore responsive policy and procedure must be developed to\neffectively distribute the supplies on hand.  Taking the\naccountability and control away from the nursing staff may be a\npossible remedy to create a more efficient requisition system.\nPlan to Protect Youths From Harm From Other Youths\nAlthough all residents interviewed seemed content and had\nlittle worry about their safety, evidence of hourly reviews of\nall housing units was not evident.  Additionally,  implementation\nprocedures, actual steps used to implement policies regarding\nthis provision, have not yet been supplied.\nThe facility needs to develop a procedure  (i.e. steps to be\nfollowed by staff) to insure hourly reviews of all housing areas,\nto include a form of written documentation, and procedures to\naccompany the facility policy in the area of assuring that\nresidents are protected from unreasonable risks of bodily harm.\n\n- 4 -\nRestraint Procedures\nAs a verification of the policies provided, several\nresidents were interviewed regarding the restraint practices at\nthe facility.  Except for the disciplinary units, no youths had\nbeen placed in restraints.\nNo procedures have been supplied for review and evaluation;\nthus, the facility needs to develop a detailed procedure for\nimplementing the stated policy.\nSanitation Procedures\nThere are basically two sources of information in the area\nof assuring that sanitary conditions exist.  One is the specific\nOfficer's\" Post Order and the other is the Housekeeping Schedule.\nNeither of these documents specifically outline methods that\nassure the facility is clean and orderly.\nIn all fairness, the facility is much cleaner than it was\nduring the last visit.  In general, floors were swept, rooms were\nneat and most of the shower and bathrooms were free of urine\nodor.\nDuring the tour several problems were identified.  Problems\ninclude, but are not limited to:\n1.  Unflushed commodes.  Additional problems in slow flush\nfrom lack of water pressure on the upper floor is cause\nfor concern;\n2.  Clogged drains in sinks;\n3.  Broken soap dishes and other porcelain fixtures.  These\ncreate not only an eyesore, but are potentially\ndangerous and should be repaired, replaced or removed;\n4.  Most unit's closets were cluttered and dirty;\n5.  Large holes are evident in many resident rooms.  Most\nof these holes contain loose mortar, exposed  framing\nwires and are dangerous.  Resident rooms containing\nholes, etc. should be closed until repaired;\n6.  Lack of ventilation in unit closets containing\ncleaning supplies;\n7.  Roach and rodent infestation throughout the building;\n8.  Dirty clothes left in piles on the floor in units;\n\n- 5 -\n9.  Garbage bags in units containing food crumbs.  (Since\nresidents do not have access to McDonald's, the\nMcDonald's french fries apparently belonged to staff.)?\n10.  Bathrooms in units do not contain paper towels nor\nsoap for residents to wash after using the facilities.\nWhile improvement has been achieved over the last year, much\nimprovement still needs to occur.  The Housekeeping Schedule and\nPost Orders should spell out duties and responsibilities in\ndetail and not in general statements.  Administration must take a\npro-active stance in monitoring cleanliness and sanitary\nconditions in this aging building.  Continued bug and rodent\ntreatment is mandatory.\nprocedures for Fire Safety and Risk to Health\nWhile the facility has adequate fire and fire evacuation\nprocedures, except for that already mentioned, there is no\nprocedure for review and evaluation in the area of surveying the\nfacility to assure a fire safety status.\nThe facility should require a qualified fire and safety\nofficer to inspect the institution on a periodic basis.  In\naddition, the facility should arrange for the local jurisdiction\nto periodically inspect the institution to insure compliance with\nlocal requirements.\nOvercrowding\nWhile the facility calls the Population Control Plan its\nprocedure for handling temporary and long-term crowding\nconditions, in actuality the Control Plan is policy and not a\nprocedure.  Therefore, no procedure was supplied for review and\nevaluation.\n\n- 6 -\nThe facility needs to forward the detailed procedures to be\nimplemented in order to carry out the stated policy regarding\npopulation control and overcrowding.\nSincerely,\nWin.
