    "summary": "<p>On July 20, 1976, children placed at the Children's Center in New York City filed a class action lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the director of the Children's Center, along with administrators and the assistant commissioner of the Department of Social Services. The class consisted of children who were placed at or were subject to placement at the Children's Center. The Legal Aid Society of the City of New York, Juvenile Rights Division represented the class. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the conditions at the Children's Center constituted cruel and unusual punishment, violated the right to be free from harm, violated the guarantee of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, and violated various state statutes. </p><p>Children placed at the Children's Center were subjected to violent assaults, forced homosexual behavior, rapes, fights and beatings with knives, sticks, chains, glass and other weapons. The staff was inadequate to meet the needs of the children. The general opinion was that the Children's Center needed to be closed; several of the defendants had made public statements to the effect that the facility should be closed.</p><p>An interim consent order was entered by the District Court (Judge William C. Conner) on July 30, 1976. The consent order provided that the defendants were required to close the Children's Center on or before July 31, 1977, to use their best efforts to place the children who were or would be residents of the Children's Center in their own homes or in suitable alternative facilities and homes, and to place any residents with intellectual disabilities in suitable \"off-city-bill\" facilities within two weeks of the order, or two weeks of their placement in the Children's Center. Furthermore, the consent order provided that the Children's Center not exceed a population of 50, that at least one staff member be present in all spaces when more than one resident is present, that all staff members be awake at all times while they are on duty, that doors be affixed on toilet stalls and curtains on bath and shower stalls, and that no more than six children be placed in a room. The Legal Aid Society was to be given access to the facility, and to the records for children residing at the Children's Center. </p><p>The only information we have on this case is the complaint and the interim consent order.</p><p></p>",

This is a class action instituted under the Civil\njiRights Act for declaratory and injunc'.ive relief.  The named\nV\n!;plaintiffs herein and members of the class they represent are\npresidents at Children's Center, a shelter operated by the Dspart-\ni'ment of Social Services of the City of New York.  Plaintiffs\ni\n••allege that  the conditions  to which they are  subjected  while in\ni\nj residence  at  the  shelter  are  unconstitutional  and violate  their\n|-\nj;rights under New York State Law.\n\nw\n2.  Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of children\nwho are in placement at or rerr.anded to or are subject to placement\nat or remand to Children's Center as \"Neglected children,\"\n\"Abused children,\" \"Voluntarily Placed children,\" or \"persons In\nNeed of Supervision\" (\"PINS\") as defined by the Family Court Act\nI of the State of New York.\n:  3. Plaintiffs and ir.err.bers of their class allege that\n;their placement at Children's Center violates their right to be\n!;free from harm under the United States Constitution and consti-\nitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and\ni  ,\nTourteenth Amendments to  the  United  States  Constitution.  Further-\nmore,  they  allege  that  Children's  Center  is  a  facility  which  is\ni\ndncapable of providing the care, supervision and treatment to which\niplaintiffs and their class are entitled under the due process\niclause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n•  4. plaintiffs and members of their class are repeatedly\nsubjected to violent assaults, rapes, fights and beatings with\n;knives, sticks, chains, glass and other weapons at Children's\nit\nijcenter.  The facility lacks adequate recreation, including sports\nrand social activities, on-going psychiatric care for those re- .\n..quiring therapy and skilled child counseling for those needing\nI.\n|;responsbile  adult  advice  and guidance.  In addition,  the  facility\ni\n'.does not provide adeguate personal privacy and protection for\ni.\ni.\ni-personal  property.\n;  5.  No society which professes  that  all  its  children\ni\ndeceive both decent care and a fair opportunity to develop into\n-2-\n\nII\nj\n|\n(responsible adults can tolerate the debilitating and brutal\n•conditions common to life at Children's Center.\n6.  Plaintiffs seek to have the aforementioned acts and\nomissions declared unconstitutional,  plaintiffs demand that de-\ni.fendants ba enjoined from continuing the placement or remand of\ni!\n^.children in Children's Center and to transfer each and every\ni.\nchild to placements where he or she can  receive adequate and\n•appropriate care, supervision and treatment.\nJURISDICTION AND VBSUE  '\n7.  This is a civil rights action for injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief authorized by Title 42 U.S.C. 1983, to redress\nithe deprivation under color of state law of rights, privileges\nand immunities guaranteed to plaintiffs by the Eighth, Ninth\n'and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\nThe jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\nJ1343 (3) and (4) .\n8.  plaintiffs' action for declaratory relief is author-\nized by 28 U.S.C. 2201 and 2202 and Rule 57 of the Federal Rules\ni;\niof Civil procedure.  Injunctive relief is authorized by 48 U.S.C.\ni\n1983 and Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n9.  Venue in this District is proper under 28 U.S.C.\n:1391 (b) and 1392 (a) .  •\nPLAINTIFFS\n10.  Plaintiffs are all boys and girls who are alleged to\n-3-\n\nbe or have been adjudicated Abused  or Neglected children and\nparsons In Need of Supervision (\"PINS\") pursuant to Articles 7\nand 10 of the Family Court Act of the State of New York, or are\ndetermined by the Family Court to be Voluntarily Placed children\npursuant to Sections 358-a and 384 of the Social Services Law of\nthe State of New York.\n11.  Section 1012 of the Family Court Act defines an\n: abused child as\nj\nj,  a child less than sixteen years of age\n\\'  whose parent or other person legally\nI  responsible for his care\nI  (i) inflicts or allows to be in-\nflicted upon such child physical\ninjury by other than accidental\nmeans which causes or creates a\nsubstantial risk of death, or ser-\nious or protracted disfigurement,\nor protracted impairment of physical\nor emotional health or protracted\nloss or impairment of the function\nof any bodily organ, or\n(ii) creates or allows to be\ncreated a substantial risk of physical\ninjury to such child by other than\naccidental means which would be likely\nto cause death or serious or protracted\ndisfigurement, or protracted impair-\n|-  mant of physical or emotional health\n)\\  or protracted loss or impairment of the\ni;  function of any bodily organ, or\nj  (iii) commits, or allows to be\n[-.  committed, a sex offense against such\n!  child, as defined in the penal law,\ni  provided, however, that the corrobora-\nji  tion requirements contained therein\nj:  shall not apply to proceedings under\nj  this article.\ni:\nI  12.  The same section defines a Neglected Child as a\n\\ child less than eighteen years of age\n(i) whose physical, mental or emotional\n-4-\n\nw\nI;\n!:\nj;  condition has been impaired or is in\nimminent danger of becoming impaired as\na result of tha failure of his parent\nor other person legally responsible for\nhis care to exercise a minimum degree\nof care\n(A) in supplying the child with adequate\nfood, clothing, shelter or education in\naccordance with the provisions of part\none of article sixty-five of the educa-\nte  tion law, or medical, dental, opto-\nj  metrical or surgical care, though finan-\n;i  cially able to do so or offered financial\nj:  or other reasonable means to do so; or\nh  (B) in providing the child with proper\nj;  supervision or guardianship, by un-\nreasonably inflicting or allowing to\nbe inflicted harm, or a substantial\nj  risk thereof, including the infliction\nof excessive corporal punishment; or\nby using a drug or drugs; or by using\nalcoholic beverages to the extent that\nhe loses self-control of his actions;\nor by any other acts of a similarly\nserious nature requiring the aid of the\ncourt; or\n(ii) who has been abandoned by his\nparents or other person legally re-\nsponsible for his care.\n|  13. Section 712(b) of the Family Court Act of the\ni\n' State of New York defines a PINS as \"... a male less than\ni\n• sixteen years of age and a female less than eighteen yaars of\nj age who does not attend school in accord with the provisions\nJ\n; of part one of article sixty-five of the education law or who\ni\nis incorrigible, ungovernable, or habitually disobedient and\n• beyond the lawful control of parent or other lawful authority.\"\nl'However, in A, v. City of New York, 31 N.Y.2d 83 (1972), the\nIS\nJ; New  York  State  Court  of  Appeals  held  that  the  portion of  section\n'. 712 relating  to  PINS which provides  for  a maximum age of  16\n' for  males  and 18 for  females  for  PINS jurisdiction  unconstitu-\n—5—\n\nW\nI.\nI  •,  i\nj tionally discriminates against females, and in following the\ndecision, the Family Court no longer subjects anyone 16 years of\nage or older to PINS proceedings.\n14.  A Voluntarily Placed Child is defined by Sections\n358-a and 334 of the Social Services Law as a destitute or\nj: dependent child whose care and custody as a public charge has\nI been transferred to.a social services official, by means of an\n| instrument executed by the child's parents pursuant to section\nj 384 of the Social Services Law and approved by a judge of the\nFamily Court.\n15.  Plaintiff JOAN DARATSAKIS is a fourteen year old\nj girl, voluntarily placed with the Comnissioner of Social Services\nwho has resided at Children's Center since October 27, 1975,\ni although on two occasions she was hospitalized at Bellevue Hos-\ni pital and on July 14, 1976, was remanded by the Family Court\nj to Hegeman Diagnostic Center for testing.\n16.  Plaintiff PAULETTE CLECKLEY is a fifteen year old\n; girl who has been remanded to the Commissioner of Social Services\n! and has resided at Children's Center since April 1, 1976, pursuant\nto a PINS petition filed against her by St. Mary's of the Field,\nan agency with which she had been in voluntary placement.\n17.  Plaintiff THERESA HORTON is a seventeen year old\ngirl who was voluntarily placed with the Consnissioner of Social\nServices by her mother and who has resided at Children's Center\n-6-\n\nV\nj:\ni:\nsince approximately May 3, 1976.\nI\n18.  Plaintiff VIRGIL REGIS is a fifteen year old boy  ;\nI\nWho has been remanded to the Commissioner of Social Services and\nhas resided at Children's Center since June 4, 1976, pursuant to\na PINS petition filed against him by his father-\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS\n19.  Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves\nand all others similarly situated as a class pursuant to Rule 23\nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  They are members of a\nclass of children who are in placement at or remanded to or are\nsubject to placement at or remand to Children's Center as \"Neglect-\ned Children,\" \"Abused Children,\" \"Voluntarily Placed Children,\" or\n\"Persons In Need of Supervision,\" (\"PINS\") as defined by the\nFamily Court Act of the State of New York.\n20.  This class action is properly brought because the\nabove class:\na) is so numerous that joinder of all members is\ni impracticable.  Upon information and belief, there are approxintate-\n• ly 70 boys and girls presently in Children's Center.  During the\ncourse of any given 24 hour period, many children are subject to\nplacement or remand and over the course of a year several hundred\nare so placed or remanded.\nb) there are common questions of law and fact,\nnamely whether defendants' action of placing or remanding plain-\ntiffs' class or subjecting plaintiffs' class to placement or re-\nmand in Children's Center violates the rights of these young per—\n-7-\n\n'. sons under the constitution of the United States, the Family\nCourt Act and the social Services Law of the state of New York.\n•  c) the questions of law and fact common to the\nclass predominate over any questions affecting only individual\n: members/ and a class action is superior to other available methods\n; for a fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.  This\n Court is a desirable forum in which to concentrate the litigation\n:\n; of the claims of the class, since it has the power to hear all\n!  .\ni the claims and to grant appropriate relief.\ni\n!i  d) the claims of the representative plaintiffs\nare typical of the claims of the members of the class, and it can !\nreasonably be expected that defendants will interpose identical  (\ndefenses to such claims.\ne) The Legal Aid Society of the City of New York,  !\njuvenile Rights Division, attorneys for plaintiffs, will fairly\nand adequately protect the interest of the class; and\nj  f) furthermore, the prosecution of separate actions\n{ by or against individual members of the class would create a\nl\nj' risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to\n' individual members of the class which would establish incompatible\n'• standards of conduct for defendants.  In addition, the defendants\nj\nI have acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to\n; the class, thereby making appropriate injunctive and corresponding\nj:\n', declaratory relief with respect to the. class as a whole.\n1:  .\ni,\nI*\n-8-\n\nW\nI\nI\nDEFENDANTS  '  i\ni\n21.  Defendant J. HENRY SMITH is the duly appointed  j\ni\nAdministrator  of  the  Naw York  city  Human Resources  Administration  i\ni\nand Commissioner of the Department of Social Services and as such\nis responsible for the administration of ths New York City Welfare\nDistrict. He is vested with direction and control over all De-\npartment of Social Services facilities and programs including shel-\n;ters such as Children's Center. He is being sued individually and\nin his official capacity.  He maintains offices at 250 Church\nt\nI\nStreet, New York City.\n22.  Defendant CAROL PARRY is the Assistant Commissioner\nof Special Services for Children and as such is responsible for\nprovision of services to all children in need of care in New York\nCity, pursuant to § 395 of the New York Social Services Law. She\nis being sued individually and in her official capacity, she\nmaintains offices at 250 Church Street, New York City.\n23.  Defendant ROBERT DAVIS is the Director of the Bureau\nof Institutions and Facilities for the Department of Social Ser-\nvices of the City of New York and as such is responsible for the\noperation of public facilities for the shelter care of children in\nNew York City. He is being sued individually and in his official\ncapacity.  He maintains offices at 80 Lafayeete Street, New York\nCity.\n24.  Defendant PAULINE PHILLIPS is the Director of\nChildren's Center, an institution operated by the Department of\nSocial Services of the City of New York. As such she is responsi-\n-9-\n\nj: ble  for  the care,  supervision  and treatment  of  children  residing\nji at  this  shelter  facility.  She is being  sued  individually  and in\nj her  official  capacity,  she maintains  offices  at  Children's  Center\ni\n••\nI 1 East  104th  Street,  New York  city.\ni\n?'  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\n|  25. In doing all the acts herein alleged, all of the\ni\nj defendants, and each of them, were and are acting under color of\nstate law, custom and usage and by virtue of the authority vested\nin each of them by the Constitution and the laws of New York\nState in the capacities as heretofore and hereinafter stated.\n26.  At all times relevant herein, Defendants and each\nof them knew or should have known, of the acts, omissions and\nconditions alleged herein.\n27.  Built in 1921, and operated by the City of New York\nunder the Bureau of Child Welfare of the Department of Social Ser-\nvices since 1947, Children's Center is located at Fifth Avenue and\n104th Street in New York City.  Its population, upon information\nand belief consists of approximately 70 boys and girls ranging in\nage from 7 to 18.  It can house in excess of 300 children although\nthe City has limited the capacity to 186.  It is a seven-story\nbrick building which contains a school, an infirmary, a cafeteria\nand recreational and administrative facilities and a series of\ndormitories for eight children each located on several floors\nwith living arragements made upon the basis of age and sex. The\nchildren have access from one floor to another.\n28.  The Center contains a gymnasium, swimming pool and\n-10-\n\nbilliard tables which are rarely used because the recreation staff\nhas been assigned to other duties.  These facilities have all been\nclosed since approximately June 21st, because of lack of staff.\nThere are no organized sports and few social activities.\n29.  The widely divergent pathologies manifested by the i\nyoung people remanded to and placed at children's Center are re-\ninforced and intensified, at the institution.  This is due to the\nparticular combination of features inherent in the operation of\nChildren's Center.  These include a transient population having\ndiverse physical, mental and emotional needs, a staff which is un-\ncoordinated and in part incompetent, a critical lack of therapeutic\nservices, and a building which is too large and impersonal.\n30.  The Center has a long and notorious history as an\ninstitution where young residents have been subjected to serious\ninjury.  No reforms or alterations can rescue this institution\nfrom the brutality and maltreatment which have plagued and con-\ntinue to plague it.  No relief short of its complete abandonment\nwill end these practices.\n31.  Upon information and belief, the current cost for\nhousing children at Children's Center is abcu t $200 per day per\nchild.\n32.  At various, times in response to public outcry and\nmedia investigations, defendants and others have issued reports\nanalyzing the conditions at the Center and suggesting ways to\namelioriate the situation.  In December, 1974, the Child Task\nForce of the Resources Review Board of the Human Resources Admin-\n•' istration reported to then Commissioner of Social Services, James\n\nw\n, R- Durapson, that Children's Center \"[s]hould be [c]losed as [s]oon\n'• as [p]ossible.\"  Defendant PARRY has publicly stated that she\n: favors closing Children's Center but has not taken any affirmative\n: steps to do so.\n:  33.  Upon information and bslief, on May 26, 1976, a\npreviously constituted ad hoc public group entitled the \"shelter\nTask Force\" met at the offices of the Department of Social Serviced\nto discuss and plan what could bs done to hasten the closing of\nChildren's Center.  This group also had met in the past to respond\nto earlier crisis situations at Children's Center.  Impetus for\nthis particular meeting cams in part from the Citizen's Committee\nfor Children which had visited Children's Center and was outraged\niby the conditions found there.\n34.  At present the conditions to which plaintiffs and\ntheir class are subjected at Children's Center are barbarous, crueJ\nand inhuman as evidenced by repeated forced homosexual behavior,\nrapes, violent assaults, fights, beatings and attacks with a vari-\nety of weapons including knives, sticks, chairs, pipes, razor\nblades and glass.  On one occasion a gun was found on the premises.\nHomosexual Attacks\n35.  Upon information and belief, a number of the ado-\nlescent girls view themselves as \"butches\" and \"ferns\" and seek out\nnew arrivals to force into homosexual liaisons.  Several girls\nhave been taken from the facility after very short stays by their\nparents who had originally brought them to Family Court as PINS\ni after the girls telephoned home begging to leave because they had\n\"been threatened with homosexual advances.\n-12-\n\n36.  Upon information and belief, during the past six\n!\nmonths gangs have formed and children have been assaulted and  I\nsubject to homosexual advances by other residents including a\nrapa of one young girl on the roof of the facility on New Years'\nEve.\n37.  After she had been at Children's Center for approx-\nimately six weeks, plaintiff JOAN DARATSAKIS was approached by\nanother resident who wanted plaintiff to enter a homosexual re-\nlationship.  When plaintiff refused, the other resident tried to\nremove plaintiff's clothes.\n38.  On one evening in March, plaintiff DARATSAKIS was\naccosted while in bed by another resident who ripped plaintiff's\nshirt off.  Several other girls came over and held her down while\nthe first resident hit plaintiff with an ironing cord and a belt.\nAt the point where the first resident began calling for someone to\nget a broom stick, plaintiff broke away and ran from the room.\nShe was taken by staff to Flower and Fifth Avenue Hospital where\nshe was treated for bruises and swelling.\n39.  Plaintiff VIRGIL REGIS has encountered homosexual\nactivities among female residents on several occasions in the\nhallways at Children's Center and in one case observed a fight in\nthe school in which several \"hutches\" were seeking revenge for\ninjuries sustained by a \"fern.\"  Both plaintiffs CLECKLEY and •\".\nHORTON have also seen homosexual acts, and CLECKLEY has been asked\nto and has refused to have a homosexual relationship.\n40.  Recently a guard dragged a young boy down a hallway\n-13-\n\nin which plaintiff REGIS was sitting while bsating the child be-  \\\n. cause he had allegedly performed a homosexual act upon a younger  I\nretarded boy-  The guard drev>r the boy up in front of plaintiff and;\n\" demanded whether the boy would like to \"try that faggot stuff\"\nwith plaintiff.\nRiots and Fights:\n41.  Upon information and belief, there are riots of\nvarying degrees of intensity virtually every night.  In the morn-\ning after each riot numerous residents are regularly sent: to near-\nby hospitals for examinations.  Others are seen in nearby hospital\nemergency rooms immediately after the incidents.\n42.  Upon information and belief, fights among residentsj\nand with staff occur regularly each day at the Center.  Often\nresidents will appear \"greased,\" which means covering their face\nand arms with vaseline or other substances as a defense against\nbeing grabbed, scratched or hit with a galncing blow.  Although  j\nthis is understood at the Center to be an indication that a fight\nis planned, the staff frequently does not respond appropriately\nto prevent the fight.\n43.  Upon information and belief, as a result of these\noccurances and others, a number of children have received severe\ninjuries including broken bonss.  One girl broke her arm while\ntrying to escape by using bedsheets to'lower herself from an upper\nstory dormitory window.  Numerous children have received lacera-\ntions including head wounds, many of which required suturing.  A\nboy was recently severely bitten on the chest by a female resident'.\n-14-\n\nI\nA girl was recently cut with a razor blade.\n44.  When plaintiff DARATSAKIS first arrived at Child-  |\nren's Center, she was assaulted regularly.  Recently sha has been j\nmore able to avoid assaults by threatening to retaliate, although\n; she was involved in an altercation with two other residents on or\ni' about June 10, 1976.  After being taunted and pushed, plaintiff\nj! swung a fish bowl stand at the two girls cutting both of them.\nPlaintiff then went into her dormitory room and put her fist\nthrough four windows before a counselor stopped her.  The next\nafternoon she was taken to Bellevue Hospital where she spent a\nweek under psychiatric observation and was then returned to\nChildren's Center.\n45.  When plaintiff DARATSAKIS arrived at Bellevue,\nseveral youngsters on the ward referred to Children's Center as\n\"the gay place\" where \"butches\" and \"ferns\" live and asked her if\nshe was a butch or fern.  The assumption that she was homosexual\nwas extremely upsetting.\n46.  Plaintiff dislikes Children's Center intensely.\nShe has been constantly afraid.  She has been struck with a pipe\nand with a chair and has had her head banged against a wall.  She\nhas also seen many fights and homosexual \"parties\" in the\ndormitories.\n47.  Plaintiff REGIS lives in a dormitory with five\nother adolescent boys and since his arrival at Children's Center\nhas observed numerous fights.  Recently he was personally involved\nin two altercations.  There have also been fights with counselors\n-15-\n\nw\n; In his  dormitory  in which counselors  have struck  residents  and  in\nwhich  chairs  were  thrown.\nji\nIj Fires and Drugs:\n;•  48. Upon  information and belief, there have been a\ni •\ni number of fires at the facility, and false alarms have occured\nhrepeatedly, often in the middle of the night.  Defendants have\nI1 allowed alcoholic beverages and marijuana to be commonly used by\nresidents in the Center.  Occasionally they are sold to residents\nby outsiders who pass them in by tying the items to ropes which\njare then hoisted into the dormitories.\n|\nIDelinquency Petitions:\n49.  Upon information and belief, defendants maintain\n|a policy and practice of filing juvenile delinquency petitions in\n[Family Court on behalf of one child and against another or even on\ni\nibehalf of staff members based upon incidents which take place-at\n[Children's Center and over which defendants have authority and\ni  '  •  •\nIcontrol.\nI\n|  50. Upon information and belief, during the last five\ni\n'months defendants have filed numerous juvenile delinquency peti-\nItions against more than 30 residents alleging, among other charges,\n'rape and assault,\ni\n!  51. Upon information and belief, defendants maintain a\n'similar policy regarding residents of Children's Center who are\njpver the age of sixteen wherein criminal complaints are filed at\n!•\nCriminal Court.\nI\ni!   52. This policy constitutes an admission that defendants.\ni\nare unable to adequately care for, supervise and treat children\n\nj;placed at or remanded to Children's Center.\n!'\nj. Staff:\nj'  53.  Upon information and belief, the staff at Children's\nI Canter is comprised of approximately fifteen case workers of whom\niionly two have master's degrees in social work and a large staff of\n!  '\ni\n! poorly trained, and in some cases untrained, child care workers,\nj known as \"Home Life Staff.\"  The caseworkers, whose director is\ni.  •\n(not clinically trained, are primarily responsible for finding place-\nij\njments for the children.  In addition, there are approximately\ntwelve uniformed guards assigned to Children's Center.\n54.  Upon information and belief, staff members are\nlunable to control the children.\n55.  Upon information and belief, staff members and guards\n'have bean physically and verbally abusive to residents and some\nistaff members also have sexually abused residents.\ni\ni\n!  56.  Upon informationand belief, a group of security\niguards dressed in state trooper-like attire and carrying guns and\nInightsticks, control the entrance to the building arid maintain a\nlfiirno ofmi gohnt st haen df iwrhsot  afrleo owra iwthienrge  tcoh ibled rteank eanr et oh etlhde  wlhooc ahla vpeo leincgea gperde-\nI;\nj.cinct for booking.  These children are often required to remain\nI;\n!• stand ing with legs spread apart and hands and fingers extended and\n(touching a wall for up to two hours.\ni  57.  plaintiff DARATSAKIS is afraid of the guards who\ni\njhit her on one occasion because she wouldn't remain in her dorrai-\n•\ni\n.'tory after a fight and who have made her stand with her legs\n-17-\n\n• w\n: spread and hands touching a wall for extended periods,  she has al4\nj:  •\ni; so had her hair pulled and has been hit by a counselor.\ni.\nj;\nj:  58. On one occasion when plaintiff CLECKLEY returned\nj. from a movie outside the Center at approximately 11:30 p.m., she\nwas refused entry by the guards who finally allowed her to enter\n, the building at approximately 3:30 a.m.  She was told by the guard\nI\ni; that she was late and as punishment would have to wait outside.\nr\nji  59. Upon information and belief, as a result of defen-\ni!\n, dants' failure to prevent repeated physical abuses from occuring\niat Children's Center, the teachers at P.S. 35-M, the public school\n!located at children's Center, recently stopped work for an after-\nj noon and sent telegrams to the defendant Commissioner as well as\ni\n! to  Irving  Anker,  Chancellor  of  the Board of  Education  among others\nj\nj expressing their alarm at the situation and fear for their own\n!sPasfyechtiya.tric Care:\n60.  Upon information and belief, initial psychiatric\n! diagnoses are available to residents, but there is no program of\ni  •  •\njon-going therapy.  Requests for psychiatric crisis intervention,\nI but not on-going therapy for the many residents who have serious\nI\n• emotional problems, are sometimes made by a caseworker to Metro-\n1\n;politan Hospital.\ni\n}  61. Plaintiff DARATSAKIS was sent to Bellevue Hospital\ni\ni from Children's Center on a second occasion when she cut her wrist\ni\ni\njwith  a razor blade after  a particularly  upsetting telephone con-\nj\n!versation with her mother.\n|  62. Plaintiff DARATSAKIS, who has resided at Children's\n\nCenter for eight months, has received no psychiatric, therapy at\nChildren's Center nor has she received any professional counseling.\n63.  Plaintiffs and members of their class are forced to;\nI\nreside in a. facility which manifests other degrading and danger-  !\nous conditions including vermin in food, lack of doors on toilets\nin dormitory bathrooms and repeated theft of personal belongings\nand an almost total lack of privacy.\n64.  Plaintiffs and the class they represent have\nsuffered and will continue to suffer irreparable harm from the\nconditions set forth above unless and until the declaratory and\ninjunctive relief sought herein is granted by the Court,\nLEGAL CLAIMS\n65.  For plaintiffs' claims, each enumerated below,\nthey re-allege paragraphs \"1\" through \"64\" above, as are fully\n1 set forth herein in each statement of claim and further allege:\nFIRST CLAIM\n66.  The- confinement of plaintiffs in Children's Center\nunder the conditions complained of herein constitutes cruel and\nunusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the United States Constitution.\nSECOND CLAIM\n67.  The confinement of plaintiffs in Children's Center\nunder the conditions complained of herein violates their right to\nbe free from harm under the Eighth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amend-\ni. ments to the United States Constitution.  !\ni  '  I\nI  -19-\n!  !\n\nTHIRD CLAIM\n68.  Plaintiffs and their class have been or shall be\ndeprived of their liberty by defendants and placed at or remanded\nto Children's Center ostensibly for the purpose of providing\nthem with the care, supervision and treatment which they had not\notherwise hsen receiving in the natural homes.  Pursuant to the\ndue process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, such deprivation\nof liberty is justified only if plaintiffs and their class in\nfact receive adequate and appropriate care, supervision and\ntreatment.  Children's Center does not provide and cannot provide\nadequate and appropriate care, supervision and treatment, and\ntherefore the residence of plaintiffs and their class at Children's\nCenter violates the Due Process Clause.\nFOURTH CLAIM  .\n69-  Defendants' failure and inability to provide\nadequate and appropriate care, supervision and treatment to plain-\ntiffs violates the Social Services Law of the State of New York,\n§§ 358-a, 384, 395 .and 398 and the Family Court Act of the State\nof New York, Articles 7 and 10, which require that such services\nbe provided.\n70.  Plaintiffs have no plain, adequate or complete\ni\nremedy at law to redress these wrongs.\ni\nRELIEF REQUESTED  .  •'\nWHEREFORE, plaintiffs respectfully demand:\n-20- •\n\n'•  A.  That an order issue permitting this action to pro-\ni caed as a class action.\nB.

That plaintiffs and their class be granted prelim-\ni\nI\ni. inary and permanent injunctions sufficient to rectify the unconsti-•\nI tutional acts and omissions and statutory violations alleged\nj; herein.\ni\nD.  That the Court issue an order enjoining and restrain-\n-21-\n\n:. ing defendants from placing or remanding or continuing remand or\n; placement of plaintiffs and their class at Children's Center.\n;  E,  That defendants be further enjoined to transfer.\ni place or remand plaintiffs and their class to adequate and suitable\nj.\n| homes and facilities which can provide suitable and adequate care.\nI-  F.
