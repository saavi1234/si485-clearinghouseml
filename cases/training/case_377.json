    "summary": "<p>In October of 1974, juvenile inmates at the Philadelphia Youth Study Center (YSC) filed a class action lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1983, 1985(3), 2000d against the City of Philadelphia and local Family Court judges in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The plaintiffs, represented by Community Legal Services, Inc. of Philadelphia, and private attorneys, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, and punitive damages for those members of the class that suffered injury, alleging that conditions at the YSC violated juveniles' First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  Specifically, the plaintiffs contended: use of excessive force, including severe physical beatings and prolonged isolation; overcrowding; physical deterioration of the building coupled with rat and roach infestations; poor heating and ventilation leading to extreme temperatures; restricted movement of inmates due to excessive security measures; no outdoor, and limited indoor recreation; heavily restricted visitation rights; censored and undelivered mail; effective prohibition of phone use; inadequate sanitation and hygiene; inadequate medical, mental and dental health provision; unnecessary pelvic examinations for girls, bordering on sexual abuse; inadequate caloric intake for detainees; no written disciplinary code; forced and coerced labor without pay; no library access; substandard education, with no supervision; no social services provided for females, very limited services for males; inadequate staff-child ratios, and poor staff training; no proper classification for offenders at intake; and practices of racial segregation and discrimination. The alleged practices were also in violation of a direct command within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, that the YSC immediately cease the use of any corporal punishment or isolation tactics.</p><p>In February 1975 a new Board of Managers was appointed to YSC and in September 1975 a new Executive Director was selected. Many changes began to take place at YSC.</p><p>On November 24, 1976, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Judge Joseph Simon Lord, III) certified the class as all juveniles who were or would become subject to incarceration at the YSC for declaratory and injunctive relief, but not for damages. Santiago v. City of Philadelphia, 72 F.R.D. 619 (E.D. Penn. 1976). The Court (Judge Lord) also recognized two sub-classes: all non-white juveniles, and all non-adjudicated juveniles within the greater class.</p><p>On July 20, 1977, the Court (Judge Lord) denied defendants' motion to dismiss.  Santiago v. City of Philadelphia, 435 F. Supp. 136 (E.D. Penn. 1977).  The Court determined that plaintiffs had made a prima facie case on all claims except the 42 U.S.C. 2000d racial discrimination claim, because the plaintiffs had not exhausted their administrative remedies.  </p><p>On November 1, 1977, the parties began collaboration on a Working Agreement.</p><p>On October 24, 1978, the parties signed a Stipulation of Settlement addressing all of the allegations from the 1974 lawsuit. However, on December 29, 1978 the Court (Judge Lord) ordered the \"Stipulation in Partial Settlement of This Action,\" which was much more limited in scope. This contained a number of provisions with the primary purposes of: enhancing the mandatory education policy and its implementation on an individual level, taking account of age, education level, and disciplinary status; eliminating corporal punishment within YSC; making sure that the classrooms had adequate supplies and staff for the education of all students; hiring a librarian and maintaining a library; and creating a monitoring scheme. Plaintiffs' counsel had free and open access to all records and admission information. Pennsylvania was to designate an evaluation team to inspect YSC 3 months after the Stipulation went into effect and every 4 months after.</p><p>On July 15, 1980 the parties submitted an Amended Stipulation in Partial Settlement to the court. As amended the Stipulation contained several provisions from the initial out-of-court agreement of October 1978. Specifically it required that: requested privacy be allowed, and not construed as isolation; isolation was never to be used as a punishment or for the convenience of the staff, but could be used to protect a resident from the themselves or others; prolonged isolation of up to 4 hours required a doctor's approval; during isolation, detainees must have access to clean, dry, well-lit rooms, dressed beds, hygiene supplies, access to education supplies, medical care, bathrooms, and correspondence; and recreation and creative activity periods were created and enforced. Also there were modifications to the visitation hours.</p><p>In February 1983, the YSC Board of Managers was dissolved, and supervision was assumed directly by the City of Philadelphia. Accordingly the parties reevaluated the Stipulation Agreement and reissued it in its entirety with some small changes on December 12, 1984. On January 15, 1985, the Court (Judge Lord) entered the Second Amended Stipulation in Partial Settlement of This Action. The new amendments added more complex protocol for admission and discharge from YSC, to deal with overcrowding.</p><p>On January 21, 1988, the Court (Judge Lord) entered the Third Amended Stipulation in Partial Settlement, to go into effect January 31, 1988. In addition to being a comprehensive document containing all provisions binding the parties, it provided for a two-phase population cap, where the YSC would reduce its maximum population to 120 residents by January 31, 1988, and then 105 residents by February 15, 1988. Together with the requirements listed above, the final Stipulation specifically required: handbooks for the residents, which explained proscribed behavior and punishments; grievance procedures; beds for each resident and fresh bedding; adequate heating, air conditioning, and ventilation; freedom of movement for residents; non-bedroom private space for residents; phone access for residents unless abused; access to psychiatric counseling for residents; hygiene products and clean clothes for all residents; meals and health in accordance with law and dietary recommendations; bathrooms cleaned daily; regular supervision to prevent fights; no discrimination based on race, gender, or sexual orientation; and training for all employees.</p><p>\t</p><p>On January 25, 1988, the Court (Judge Lord) entered an order appointing \"Offender Aid and Restoration\" as the monitor for the case.</p><p>Because PACER has no docket, we have no more information on this file.</p><p></p>",

Jurisdiction and Remedies  31\n\nPREAMBLE\nThe following factual background is agreed to by the parties and is incor-\nporated as preamble to this Third Amended Stipulation of Settlement.\nA reorganization of the Youth Study Center (YSC) commenced in 1975 and\nvarious educational, recreational and other programs were introduced.  Shortly\nthereafter, through the joint efforts of the Family Court and the Youth Study\nCenter, the Detention Alternative Program came into being.  This Program, which\nevolved into the Community Based Emergency Shelter program  (CBES), releases\njuveniles to other facilities when YSC detention is inappropriate.  In addition,\nthe YSC employed social workers and requests were made to City authorities for\ncapital funds with which the Center could improve the building and the con-\nditions under which the residents lived.\nIn 1978, the parties entered into a Stipulation of Settlement.  The Stipula-\ntion established standards for conditions at the Youth Study Center.  It also\nestablished intake standards aimed at controlling overcrov/ding at the YSC.  The\nparties entered into an Amended Stipulation in 1979 in order to comply with\nnewly promulgated state DPW detention regulations.\nIn February, 1983, pursuant to an Act of the Pennsylvania General Assembly,\nthe YSC Board of Managers was dissolved and management was assumed by the City\nof Philadelphia.  The parties then amended the Stipulation again in December,\n1984, to better control overcrowding at the YSC.  Now, the parties have agreed\nto re-examine the 1978 stipulation, as amended, in light of continuing,\novercrowding.  This Third Amended Stipulation is made as a result of that\ninquiry and incorporates those changes that the parties believe to be con-\nsistent with the demands of public safety and to be minimally necessary for the\n\nsafe operation of the vSC.  It is the express intent of the parties that the\nitems contained  in this Third Amended  Stipulation  shall be maintained  in the\nfuture.\nAlthough the parties intend that this Stipulation be enforceable  in this\nCourt, the parties agree it gives rise to enforceable  rights only in the event\nof a material  breach in its observance or pursuant to Section XXVI.  Upon execu-\ntion of the Third Amended Stipulation, prior stipulations will be replaced; the\noriginal  complaint  shall  remain withdrawn and its allegations will  not be the\nsubject of future proceedings, legal  or equitable.\nThe parties enter into this Stipulation  in order to improve conditions at\nYSC.  Nor do the parties intend, by this Stipulation, to make any admission or\nconcession with respect to any other litigation pending  in this jurisdiction or\nelsewhere.\nThis revised Stipulation  recognizes that it is essential  for the YSC to\nremain at or below licensed capacity.  In the first six months of 1987, the\naverage daily population of the YSC v/as over 150 residents, which  is more than\n45 above the capacity as licensed by the Commonwealth  of Pennsylvania.  Severe\novercrowding has posed a significant  risk to the safety, welfare and security of\nresidents and staff.  In recognition of this problem, this Stipulation  sets a\ntime frame by which defendants must  reach and maintain a population that is no\nhigher than 105.\nI.  Alternative Detention  Placement:\nThe parties recognize that one of the primary goals of juvenile detention is\n\"to provide temporary  secure care, while minimizing  the negative effects of con-\nfinement, for alleged delinquents  or adjudicated  delinquent juveniles awaiting\ndisposition  of the court, when there is a clear and convincing  need to protect\n\nthe community and when remaining with parents or placement 1n their care is\ninappropriate.\"  55 Pa. Code § 3760 etseg,  Social Services Manual, The Office\nof Children, Youth and Families, Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare,\nSeptember 1, 1979 (hereinafter \"DPW Detention Regulations\").  Because at .present\nthe Youth Study Center provides only the most restrictive form of custody --\nsecure custody -- the City and the Family Court shall continue to implement the\nplan for less restrictive detention placements,'such as CBES, small community-\nbased group homes, foster placements, home detention, and mentor homes.  The YSC\nclient population shall be in conformity with the standards set forth in\nParagraph XXII, infra.\nII.  Discipline of Children at the YSC;\nA.  Corporal  Punishment:\n1.  Subsequent to any use of physical force by a staff member, a \"Use\nof Force\" report (86-141) shall be filed immediately by the staff member with\nhis supervisor, describing specifically the reason for the use of force, the\namount and type of force used, the resident involved, and the names of all resi-\ndent and staff witnesses.  The supervisor shall investigate the incident and\nreport his findings to the Executive Director of the YSC within 24 hours of the\nincident.  In all «cases where there is evidence uncovered that force was used or\na \"Use of Force\" report was filed, the Executive Director shall interview the\nstaff member, resident involved, and any witnesses, a) to determine whether or\nnot force was necessary, b) to counsel all parties about the confrontation, and\nc) to decide if further action should be taken, including, where appropriate,\nsuspension and/or dismissal of staff who violate this policy.\n2.  Whenever any YSC resident believes that he has been the victim of\nunwarranted use of force by a staff member, the resident may, if desired,\nproceed in accordance with the grievance procedure outlined in Paragraph III B.\n\nB.  Crisis Intervention/Disciplinary  Isolation Procedures:\n1.  \"Isolation\"  (also known as \"segregation\") 1s the placement of a\nresident 1n a locked room to control behavior.  The resident's  request to spend\ntime 1n a private, unlocked room or room which unlocks from the inside 1s not to\nbe considered  Isolation and should be granted, If feasible.  Quarantine or other\npreventive health measures are not considered  Isolation but can only be ordered\nby a licensed physician.  Locking residents In rooms during a normal  eight-hour\nsleeping period  1s not considered  Isolation if the rationale and procedures are\ndocumented 1n the current program description.\n2.  Use of Isolation\na.  The parties recognize the potential  for aggressive, disrup-\ntive or threatening behavior on the part of the residents of a detention faci-\nlity.  Children  1n detention are often 1n a tense or unsettled emotional  state\nwhich may lead to displays of anger, tension, loss of self-control, frustration,\nor violence, directed  toward staff or other residents.  Staff shall attempt to\nprevent such behavior by recognizing  Indications of impending behavior and\nintervening  1n a positive, constructive manner to neutralize or prevent such\nacting out or assaultiveness.  Isolation or handcuffs shall be used only to\ncontrol behavior which  1s a clear and present danger to the resident, to other\nresidents, or to staff.\nb.  Residents requiring Isolation or handcuffs shall not be\ndenied food, or subjected  to corporal  punishment, or abusive or degrading treat-\nment.\nc.  Isolation and handcuffs shall not be used as punishment, for\nthe convenience of staff, or as a substitute for program.  They shall not be\nused unless all other available techniques or resources have  failed.\nd.  When  Isolation or handcuffs are used, an Incident  report\nIncluding the fallowing  shall be entered 1n the residents' record:  the method\n- , : ' .'  8  - • - - • ••\n\nV .*\nused, the conduct necessitating  the isolation or handcuffs, alternative method:\nwhich were unsuccessful  in controlling  the behavior, the period of time the\nresident spent  isolated or handcuffed, the monitoring  report, and the physical\nand emotional  condition of the .resident during and after release from isolation\nor handcuffs.\ne.  A log recording all  incidents where isolation and handcuffs\nwere used shall be established.  For each incident the name of the resident,\nwhether isolated or handcuffed, the date and time period over which the isola-\ntion or handcuffs were used, the staff who used it and the staff who authorized\nits use shall  be noted.  This log shall be submitted quarterly to the\nDepartment, the President Judge  (Administrative Judge, Family Court  Division),\nand the County Executive Officers .(Commissioner of the Department of Human\nServices).\nf.  The Executive Director is responsible for insuring that staff\nknow specific procedures, methods and steps relating to the use of handcuffs and\nisolation and that the staff is familiar with these regulations and the criteria\nfor their application.\ng.  Authority for isolation rests with the Executive Director, or\nin the Executive Director's absence the staff person designated  by the Executive\nDirector.  The Executive Director shall  see the resident, assess the resident's\nneeds, and seek professional  consultation  if indicated.  Normally, written\nauthorization with date and time shall precede the placement of a resident in\nisolation.  In emergencies, telephone authorization may be accepted, to be\nfollowed promptly by a written authorization, dated and signed by the Executive\nDirector or his/her designee not later than four hours after the telephone\nauthorization.\nh.  Authorization  for isolation  is good for only four hours.  For\nevery  four hour period  the procedure  in paragraph  (a) through  (g) shall be\n\n'*•'•\nfollowed.  The time the authorization is received will be recorded.  Isolation\nshall not exceed  16 hours in any 48 hour period withoui: a written court order.\nWhen requesting a court order for continuing isolation beyond 16 hours in a 4P>\nhour period, the facility shall give prior notice to the child, and the child's\nattorney of record or the County Public Defender's Office.  Court authorization\nand any other documentation shall be included in the child's record.\ni.  In the absence of a written or telephone authorization, a\nresident may be placed in isolation as a protective measure for no more than one\nhour when such action is immediately necessary.  At such times, the Executive\nDirector or designee shall be notified immediately and approve such act.  If,\nafter visiting the resident, the Executive Director or designee deems isolation\nnecessary, they shall document their observations fully on the incident report.\n3.  The following procedure shall be followed when a resident is in\nisolation:\n—  potentially dangerous articles shall be removed from the resi-\ndent.  This include-s articles of clothing, such as belts, if there\nare reasonable grounds to believe such clothing constitutes a\nsubstantial  threat to the health or safety of the resident.  In no\ncase shall all clothing be removed.\n—  a staff person shall be assigned to sit in the room with the\nresident or immediately outside the room.

In every case that the YSC Court Intake Personnel\norders detention, the YSC Court Intake Personnel  is responsible for confirming\nthe existence of documentation  that permits detention under these standards.\n21\n\n2.  Mandatory Release\na.  The YSC court intake personnel  shall not order detention at\nthe YSC of any juvenile 12 years of age or younger, regardless of the nature of\nthe offense and/or the charges against the juvenile.

If no such measure will suffice, the YSC court\nintake personnel  shall state explicitly in writing the reasons for rejecting\nalternatives to detention.  When YSC court intake personnel determine that a\nform of detention is a permissible interim status under subsections 2. or 3.,\nabove, secure detention at the YSC may be selected only if there 1s evidence\nthat it is likely that release will  result in an identifiable danger to others\n23\n\n(  (  <••  v<\nor a significant  risk of flight to avoid appearance  in court.

Effective  Date 30\n\nPREAMBLE\nThe following  factual background  is agreed  to by the\nparties and  is incorporated  as preamble to this second\namended stipulation of settlement.\nA reorganization of the Youth Study Center  (YSC)\ncommenced  in 1975 and various educational, recreational and\nother programs were introduced.  Shortly  thereafter, through\nthe joint efforts of the Family Court and  the Youth Study\nCenter, the Detention Alternative Program came into being.\nThis Program, which became the Community Based  Emergency\nShelter program  (CBES), releases to other  facilities\noffenders not involved  in violent crime.  Social workers were\nengaged  (subject to budget limitations), and requests were\nmade to city authorities for capital funds with which the\nCenter could  improve the building and the conditions under\nwhich the residents lived.\nIn 1978 the parties entered  into a stipulation of\nsettlement.  The stipulation established  standards for\nconditions at the Youth Study Center  (hereinafter  \"YSC\").. It\nalso established  intake standards aimed at controlling the\nYSC population.  The parties entered  into an Amended\nStipulation  in 1979  in order  to comply with newly promulgated\nstate DPW detention regulations.\nIn February, 1983, pursuant to an Act of the General\nAssembly, the YSC Board of Managers was dissolved and\nmanagement was assumed by the City of Philadelphia.  The\nparties have since agreed  to re-examine  the 1978 stipulation,\n\nas amended, in light of changed circumstances.  This second\namended stipulation  is made as a result of that inquiry, and\nincorporates those changes which the parties believe to be\nconsistent with the demands of public safety and to be\nminimally necessary  for the safe operation of the YSC.  It is\nthe express intent of the parties that the items contained in\nthis second amended stipulation shall be maintained  in the\nfuture .\nAlthough the parties intend that this stipulation be\nenforceable  in this court, the parties agree it gives rise to\nenforceable rights only in the event of a material breach in\nits observance.  Upon execution of the second amended stipu-\nlation, the 1978 stipulation as amended will be replaced; the\noriginal complaint shall remain withdrawn and  its allegations\nwill not be the subject of future proceedings, legal or\nequitable.\nThe parties enter  into this stipulation  in order to\nimprove conditions at the Youth Study Center.  The terms of\nthis stipulation apply only to the conditions and population\nat the Youth Study Center.  Nor do the parties intend, by\nthis stipulation, to make any admission or concession with\nrespect to any other  litigation pending  in this jurisdiction\nor elsewhere.\nI.  Alternative Detention Placement:  The parties  recognize\nthat one o£ the primary goals of juvenile detention is \"to\nprovide temporary secure care, while minimizing  the negative\neffects of confinement, for alleged delinquents or\n\nadjudicated delinquent juveniles awaiting disposition of the\ncourt, when there is a clear and convincing need to protect\nthe community and when remaining with parents or placement in\ntheir care is inappropriate.\"  Regulation 2-28-6 Social\nServices Manual, The Office of Children  , Youth and Families,\nPennsylvania Department of Public Welfare, September  1, 1979\n(hereinafter  \"DPW Detention Regulations\").  Because at\npresent the Youth Study Center provides only the most\nrestrictive form of custody—  secure custody—  the City and\nthe Family Court shall continue to implement the plan for\nless restrictive detention placements, such as CBES,  small\ncommunity-based  group homes, foster placements, and mentor\nhomes.  The YSC client population shall be in conformity with\nthe standards set forth in Paragraph XXII, infra.\nII.  Discipline of Children at the YSC:\nA.  Corporal Punishment:\n(1)  Subsequent  to any use of physical  force by a\nstaff member, a \"Use of Force\" report  (86-141) shall be filed\nimmediately by the staff member with his'supervisor ,\ndescribing specifically  the reason for the use of force, the\namount and type of force used, the resident  involved, and the\nnames of all resident and staff witnesses.  The supervisor\nshall investigate  the incident and report his findings to the\nExecutive Director of the YSC within 24 hours of the\nincident.  In all cases where there is evidence uncovered\nthat force was used or a \"Use of Force\" report was filed, the\nExecutive Director  shall interview the staff member, resident\n\ninvolved, and any witnesses, a) to determine whether or not\nforce was necessary, b) to counsel all parties about the\nconfrontation and c) to decide if further action should be\ntaken, including, where appropriate, suspension and/or\ndismissal of staff  in violation of this policy.\n(2)  Whenever any YSC resident believes that he\nhas been the victim of unwarranted use of force by a staff\nmember, the resident may, if desired, proceed  in accordance\nwith the grievance procedure outlined  in Par. Ill B.\nB.  Crisis Intervention/Disciplinary  Isolation\nProcedures;\n(1)  \"Isolation\"  (also known as \"segregation\") is\nthe placement of a resident in a locked room to control\nbehavior.  The resident's request to spend  time in a private,\nunlocked room or room which unlocks from the inside is not to\nbe considered  isolation and should be granted, if feasible.\nQuarantine or other preventive health measures are not\nconsidered  isolation but can only be ordered by a licensed\nphysician.  Locking  residents in rooms during a normal eight-\nhour sleeping period  is not considered  isolation  if the\nrationale and procedures are documented  in the current\nprogram description.\n(2)  Use of Isolation\n(a)  The parties recognize the potential for\naggressive, disruptive or threatening behavior on the part\n\nof the residents of a detention facility.  Children in\ndetention are often  in a tense or unsettled emotional state\nwhich may lead  to displays of anger, tension, loss of self-\ncontrol, frustration, or violence, directed  toward staff or\nother  residents.  Staff shall attempt to prevent such\nbehavior by recognizing  indications of  impending behavior and\nintervening  in a positive, constructive manner  to neutralize\nor prevent such acting out or assaultiveness.  Isolation or\nhandcuffs shall be used only to control behavior which  is a\nclear and present danger  to the resident, to other residents,\nor to staff.\n(b)  Residents requiring  isolation or handcuffs\nshall not be denied  food, or subjected  to corporal\npunishment, or abusive or degrading  treatment.\n(c)  Isolation and handcuffs shall not be used\nas punishment, for  the convenience of staff, or as a sub-\nstitute for program.  They, shall not be used unless all other\navailable  techniques or resources have  failed.\n(d)  When  isolation or handcuffs are used, an\nincident report  including  the following  shall be entered  in\nthe residents' record:  the method used, the conduct\nnecessitating  the  isolation or handcuffs, alternative methods\nwhich were unsuccessful  in controlling  the behavior, the\nperiod of  time the resident spent isolated or  handcuffed,\nthe monitoring  report, and  the physical and  emotional\ncondition of the resident during and after  release  from\n\nisolation or  handcuffs.\n(e)  A log  recording  all  incidents where  isolation\nand handcuffs  were used  shall be established.  For  each\nincident  the name of  the resident, whether  isolated  or\nhandcuffed,  the date and  time period over  which  the  isolation\nor handcuffs were  used, the staff who used  it and  the  staff\nwho authorized  its use shall be noted.  This  log  shall be\nsubmitted  quarterly  to the Department, the President  Judge\n(Administrative  Judge, Family Court Division), and  the County\nExecutive  Officers  (Commissioner  of  the Department  of  Public\nWelfare).\n(f)  The Executive Director  is responsible  for\ninsuring  that staff  know specific procedures, methods and\nsteps relating  to the use of handcuffs and  isolation  and  that\nthe staff  is familiar  with  these regulations  and  the criteria\nfor  their  application.\n(g)  Authority  for  isolation  rests with  the\nExecutive  Director, or  in the Executive  Director's  absence\nthe staff  person designated  by the Executive  Director.  The\nExecutive  Director  shall see the resident, assess  the\nresident's needs, and  seek professional consultation  if\nindicated.  Normally, written authorization  with date and\ntime shall precede  the placement of a resident  in  isolation.\nIn emergencies, telephone  authorization  may  be accepted, to\nbe followed  promptly  by a written  authorization, dated  and\nsigned  by  the  Executive  Director  or his/her  designee  not\n\nlater than four hours after the telephone authorization.\n(h)  Authorization  for isolation is good  for only\nfour hours.  For every four hour period the procedure in\nparagraph  (a) through  (g) shall be followed.  The time the\nauthorization  is received will be recorded.  Isolation shall\nnot exceed 16 hours in any 48 hour period without a written\ncourt order.  When requesting a court order  for continuing\nisolalation beyond 16 hours in a 48 hour period, the\nfacility shall give prior notice to the child, and the\nchild's attorney of record or the County Public Defender's\nOffice.  Court authorization and any other documentation\nshall be included  in the child's record.\n(i)  In the absence of a written or telephone\nauthorization, a resident may be placed  in isolation as a\nprotective measure for no more than one hour when such action\nis immediately necessary.  At such times, the Executive\nDirector or designee shall be notified  immediately and\napprove such act.  If, after visiting  the resident, the\nExecutive Director or designee deems isolation necessary,\nthey shall document their observations fully on the incident\nreport.\n(3)  The following procedure shall be followed when a\nresident is in isolation:\n—  potentially dangerous articles shall be re-\nmoved  from the resident.  This includes articles of\nclothing, such as belts, if there are reasonable\n\ngrounds to believe such clothing constitutes a sub-\nstantial threat to the health or safety of the re-\nsident.  In no case shall all clothing be removed.\na staff person shall be assigned to sit in the\nroom with the resident or immediately outside the\nroom.  The staff member shall have no other duties\nor responsibilities other than supervision of the\nresident.  At all times the staff and resident\nshall have visual and audio contact, and not rely\non intercoms, closed circuit television or other\nsuch devices.\n—  the physical needs of the resident shall be\ngiven prompt response.\n(4)  The following shall be available  for a child  in iso-\nlation, unless staff determine that possession presents an\nimmediate danger  to the child or others:\na clean dry room of moderate  temperature,\nequipped with light sufficient  for reading\nbetween the hours of 7 a.m.  to 10 p.m.;\nsufficient clothing  to meet seasonal needs;\n—  a bed, including blankets, sheets, pillow\nand pillow cases, and mattress;\n—  personal hygiene supplies including soap,\ntoothpaste, toothbrush, hairbrush, comb, towels\nand toilet paper;\n\nminimum writing materials  including pen,\npencils, paper and envelopes;\n—  prescription eyeglasses, if needed;\naccess  to books, periodicals and other  reading\nmaterials;\n—  adequate  toilet facilities and bathing  facili-\nties;\n—  correspondence privileges applicable  to all\njuveniles  in the facility; and\n--  access to medical care.\n(5)  If any of the above are denied  to, or removed  from\nthe child, the reasons shall be documented  in the  incident\nreport.\n(6)  A monitoring  report with observations entered  at no\nless than  15 minute  intervals shall be maintained  as part of\nthe incident report described  in paragraph  (2) (d) .\nIII. A.  Handbook  for Residents:\n(1)  Within  30 days of the effective date of  this second\namended  stipulation each new resident of  the YSC shall\nreceive a handbook which, in clear and simple  language, shall\ndescribe  the services and  facilities provided  at the Center,\nexplain  the rules regarding discipline and outline  the\nprocedures of the Family Court.  The handbook  shall describe\nthe YSC grievance procedure.\n(2)  Within  24 hours of admission, each new  resident's\nsocial worker  shall go over  the handbook with him  to be sure\n\nthat he understands  it fully.  Copies of  the handbook  in\nSpanish  shall be available  for  those who speak  that  language.\nIII.B.  Grievance  Procedure;\n(1)  Residents may make complaints  to YDC supervisory or\nsocial work  staff  about any matter  covered  in this\nstipulation, including  but not limited  to intake, incidents\nor conditions  at  the YSC.\n(2)  Said  staff  shall reduce  the complaint  to writing.\nOne copy  of  the complaint  shall be placed  in the  resident's\nfile, and one copy  in a central  file maintained  by the YSC\nExecutive  Director  or his designee.\n(3)  The Executive  Director  shall ensure  that each\ncomplaint  is investigated  thoroughly  and  resolved, if\npossible.\n(4)  (a) The  resident may complain  about  disciplinary\nisolation, either  verbally  or  in writing, to any paid\nemployee  or  volunteer  in the YSC, or  to the  resident's\nattorney, parent, or  legal guardian.  The complaint must be\npresented  by any YSC  staff person  receiving  it to the YDC\nSupervisor  within  two hours of  initial  request.  The YDC\nSupervisor, upon  receipt of  such  request will  form a\nhear ing/investi-gative  board  consisting  of  the YDC\nSupervisor, one  YDC  II  (not assigned  to the resident's  unit),\nand one  YDC I  (not assigned  to the resident's  unit).  The\nhearing/investigative  board  shall convene  no more  than  two\nhours  from  the  time  the request  is made  to the YDC\nSupervisor, and  shall review  the  incident and  the\n10\n\ndisciplinary  action  taken.

B. Crisis Intervention/Disciplinary  Isolation Procedures  j\nSections  (l)-(10) are hereby amended so as to be consistent •\nand comply with Section 28, \"Detention Center Service,\" of  ;\ni\nChapter 11 of the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare  i\nSocial Services Manual, as revised September 1, 1979.  These\nsections are specifically amended as follows:  I\n(1) \"Isolation\" is the placement of a resident in a\n(1)\n\nlocked room to control behavior.  The resident's\nrequest to spend time in a private, unlocked room\nor room which unlocks from the inside is not to\nbe considered isolation and should be granted if\nfeasible.  Quarantine or other preventive health\nmeasures are not considered isolation but can only\nbe ordered by a licensed physician.  Locking resi-\ndents in rooms during a normal eight-hour sleeping\nperiod in not considered isolation if the rationale\nand procedures are documented in the current program\ndescription.  (Section 2-28-12, DPV7 Social Services\nManual, hereinafter referred to by Section only.)\n(2)  Use of Isolation\n(a)  The Department recognized the potential for\naggressive, disruptive or theatening behavior on\nthe part of the residents of a detention facility.\nChildren in detention are often in a tense or un-\nsettled emotional state which may lead to displays\nof anger, tension, loss of self-control, frustration,\nor violence, directed toward staff or other residents.\nStaff shall attempt to prevent such behavior by recog-\nnizing indications of impending behavior and interven-\ning in a positive, constructive manner to neutralize\n(2)\n\nor prevent such action out or assaultiveness.  Isola-  '\ntion or handcuffs shall be used only to control behavior  '\nwhich is a clear and present danger to the resident,  i\nto other residents, or to staff.  (2-28-154)  j\ni\n|\nb)  Residents requiring isolation or handcuffs shall  i\nnot be denied food, or subjected to corporal punishment,  j\nor abusive or degrading treatment.  (2-28-155)\nc)  Isolation and handcuffs shall not be used as  j\npunishment, for the convenience of staff, or as a  ;\nsubstitute for program.  They shall not be used unless\nall other available techniques or resources have\ni\nfailed.  (2-28-156)  '\nd)  When isolation or handcuffs are used, an incident  I\nreport including the following shall be entered in the\nresidents' record:  the method used, the conduct\nnecessitating the isolation or handcuffs, alternative  !\nmethods which were unsuccessful in controlling the\nj\nbehavior, the period of time the resident spent isolated  !\nor handcuffed, the monitoring report, and the physical\nand emotional condition of the resident during and  ]\ni\nafter release from isolation or handcuffs.  (2-28-157)  |\ne)  A log recording all incidents where isolation and  ,\n(3)\n\nhandcuffs were used shall be established.  For each\nincident the name of the resident, whether  isolated\nor handcuffed, the date and time period over which\nthe isolation or handcuffs were used, the staff who\nused it and the staff who authorized its use shall\nbe noted.  This log shall be submitted quarterly to\nthe Department, the President Judge, and the County\nExecutive Officers.  (2-28-158)\nf)  The administrator is responsible for insuring\nthat staff know specific procedures, methods and\nsteps relating to the use of handcuffs and isolation\nand that the staff is familiar with these regulations\nand the criteria for their application.  (2-28-159)\ng)  Authority for isolation rests with the admini-\nstrator, or in the administrator's absence the staff\nperson designated by the administrator.  The admini-\nstrator shall see the resident, assess the resident's\nneeds, and seek professional consultation if indicated.\nNormally, written authorization with date and time shall\nprecede the placement of a resident in isolation.  In\nemergencies, telephone authorization may be accepted,\nto be followed promptly by a written authorization,\ndated and signed by the administrator or his/her\n(4)\n\ni  designee not later than four hours after the telephone\nauthorization.  (2-28-160)\n1\n1  h)  Authorization for isolation is good for only four\nj  hours.  For every four hour period the procedure in\nji  paragraph 2-28-153 shall be followed.  The time the\nr  authorization is received will be recorded.  Isolation\nI'\nj  shall not exceed 16 hours in any 4 8 hour period without\n!  a written court order.  When requesting a court order\nh\n\\  for continuing isolation beyond 16 hours in a 48 hour\nperiod, the facility shall give prior notice to the\nchild, and the child's attorney of record or the County\n\\\\  Public Defender's Office.  Court authorization and any\n:  other documentation shall be included in the child's\n;;  record.  (2-28-161)\ni)  In the absence of a written or telephone authori-\nzation, a resident may be placed in isolation as a\nprotective measure for no more than one hour when such\naction is immediately necessary.  At such times, the\nadministrator or designee shall be notified  immediately\nand approve such act.  If, after visiting the resident,\nthe administrator or designee deems isolation necessary,\nthey shall document their observations fully on the\nincident report.  (2-28-162)\n(5)\n\n(3)  The  following procedure shall be followed when a\nresident  is in isolation:\npotentially  dangerous articles shall be  removed\nfrom the resident.  This includes articles of  clothing,\nsuch as belts, if there are reasonable grounds to be-\nlieve such clothing constitutes a substantial  threat\nto the health or safety of the resident.  In no\ncase shall all clothing be removed.\na staff person shall be assigned  to sit in the\nroom with  the resident or immediately  outside  the\nroom.  The staff member shall have no other duties or\nresponsibilities  other than supervision of the resi-\ndent.  At all times the staff and resident  shall  have\nvisual and audio contact, and not rely on intercoms,\nclosed circuit television or other  such devices.\n--  the physical needs of the resident  shall be  given\nprompt response.  (2-28-163)\n(4)  The  following  shall be available  for child  in isola-\ntion, unless staff determine that possession  presents\nan immediate danger to the child or others:\n(6)\n\na clean dry room of moderate  temperature,\nequipped with  light sufficient for reading  between\nthe hours of 7 a.m.  to 10 p.m. ;\nsufficient clothing to meet seasonal needs;\na bed, including blankets, sheets, pillow  and\npillow cases, and mattress;\n—  personal hygiene supplies including  soap,\ntoothpaste,toothbrush, hairbrush, comb, towels\nand toilet paper;\n—  minimum writing materials  including pen, pencils,\npaper and envelopes;\n--  prescription  eyeglasses, if needed;\naccess  to books, periodicals and other  reading\nmaterials;\n—  adequate toilet facilities and bathing  facilities;\n—  correspondence privileges applicable  to  all\njuveniles  in the facility;  and\naccess  to medical care.  (2-28-164)\n(5)  If any of the above are denied to, or removed  from the\nchild, the reasons shall be documented  in the  incident\nreport.  (2-28-165)\n!  (7)\n\n(6)  A monitoring report with observations entered at no\nless than 15 minute intervals shall be maintained as\npart of the incident report described in paragraph\n!1  (2)(d).

The child may\nappeal the restriction through the grievance procedure\noutlined in the YSC's handbook.  If parental\nrights are involved, the parents shall have prior notice\nand the opportunity to challenge the YSC's decision\nto restrict visiting.

Dale\nProfessor of Law Santiago v. Philadelphia\nShepard Broad Law Center\n3100 S.W. 9th Avenue\nFt. Lauderdale,  FL  33315\nJI-PA-005-011\nDear  Mike:\nYour article is excellent.  I made a few annotations\nthroughout, including in the notes.  A couple of additional\npoints:\n—  Brunner also dealt with restraints, which you might want\nto note in connection with your Hollinqsworth observation on page\n13;\n—  the Education for Handicapped Act has been recodified as\nIDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act);\n—  the first three versions of our Santiago decree had\ndetailed admission criteria, most (but not all) of which were\nreplaced by the population cap;\n—  Santiago had a major education component that was handled\nby the Education Law Center (sorry about forgetting to include\nthe education decree, which is now enclosed);\n—  Pennsylvania education regulations deem juvenile\ndetainees to be \"exceptional children\" within the meaning of our\nspecial education laws (an anomaly that is, I believe, extremely\nrare in state education statutes), which therefore gives added\nweight to children's rights to education while in detention.  22\nPa.Code §14.1 (Definitions: \"Exceptional student— A student who\nmeets one of the following criteria: *** (iv) A school age child\nin a detention home.\")\nOne of the conclusions that Jim Anderson and I reached was\nthe importance of judicial \"ownership\" to successful\nimplementation.  Judges have to want to reduce detention for\nlitigation to succeed in the long run.  Judges were defendants in\nStaff: Robert G Schwartz. Esq Board of Pamela Grace Model Germaine Ingram.

Soler, Esq.\n\nboth Santiago and Coleman. but the intervention of JCJC in\nColeman (through Paul DeMuro's mediation) turned Coleman into a\nfar more successful decree.  (In addition, that judicial\nownership, built because of JCJC's strong values, began in\nadvance of the consent decree.  The population dropped and\nleveled off before the consent decree became effective.  This\nsuggests to me that the filing of the suit and the evidence,\ngained through discovery, of enormous disparities in detention\npractices across the state, gave ammunition to judicial leaders\nwho agreed with plaintiffs1 position.)  I've struggled to find a\nway to give similar ownership to judges in Santiago, but have\nbeen only mildly successful.  (See the enclosed copy of\n\"Overcrowded Times.\")\nThere is another lesson from the Pennsylvania litigation.\nOvercrowding is the hardest issue to address, because its\nsolution is extrinsic to the detention center itself.  It is\ncaused by extended stays in the state system, causing backup into\nthe detention population; turnover in decision-makers; a tendency\nto use detention criteria as though everyone eligible should be\nheld; absence of aftercare probation, resulting in extended stays\non the corrections side, etc.  Brunner was a conditions suit that\nhad no overcrowding component (like Hollingsworth), so it was\neasy to settle and implement.  Coleman dealt with admissions, and\nis therefor easily monitored, but it was not an overcrowding\nsuit.  Santiago has had the longest life, and is much like prison\nand jail overcrowding litigation, subject to trends and other\nfactors such as those suggested above.  It may be useful to more\nclearly distinguish what these cases tried to accomplish, and\ntheir different levels of success.\nSincerely,\nRobert G. Schwartz\nExecutive Director\nRGS/hs\nenc.",

In fact, \n \non July 27, 1989, plaintiffs withdrew their motion to close admissions. However, throughout the fall of 1989, the number of \njuveniles detained at YSC was continuously well over the maximum allowable population. On November 27, 1989, plaintiffs \nmoved for enforcement of the stipulation of settlement, which means that the District Attorney’s motion must now be decided. \n \n2  18 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 1108 provides that a district attorney “shall have automatic standing and a legal interest in, any proceeding \nwhich may involve the release or nonadmission of county prisoners, delinquents or detainees due to the fact, duration or other \n \nconditions of custody.” It also entitles a district attorney to “seek any equitable relief necessary to protect the district attorney’s \ninterest in the continued institutional custody and admission of county prisoners, delinquents or detainees.” \n \n3  The legislative history of section 1108 supports this conclusion. In proposing the statute in the House of Representatives, \nRepresentative Wogan stated: “[T]his is a commonsense amendment. It is reasonable to assume that D.A.’s who, it is already \n  3 \n \n\nSantiago v.

As Harris establishes, however, a public official who seeks to intervene in an \n \naction as of right must have more than “a general interest in the litigation;” the subject of the suit must come within the scope of \nhis official duties. 820 F.2d at 602. To satisfy this requirement, Pennsylvania could make the District Attorney rather than the City \nof Philadelphia responsible for managing YSC.

Pennsylvania.\nJuly 20, 1977.\n111111333444789012 *137*138*139*140*141*142 Jonathan M. Stein, Jack J. Levine, Alex J. Palamarchuk, Ellen Josephson, Janet\nF. Stotland, Philadelphia, Pa., for plaintiffs.\nJoseph R. Lally, Agostino Cammisa, Alan H. Gilbert, M. Faith Angell, Philadelphia, Pa., for defendants.\nOPINION\nJOSEPH S. LORD, III, Chief Judge.\nThis civil rights action is brought by juvenile-residents of the Youth Study Center (\"YSC\"), Philadelphia,\nPennsylvania, who challenge the conditions of confinement and treatment at YSC and seek injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief and damages. In a previous opinion, Santiago v. City of Philadelphia, 72 F.R.D. 619\n(E.D.Pa.1976) [hereinafter Santiago I], we granted plaintiffs' motion for class action certification as it applies to\n[1]\ninjunctive and declaratory relief.  Defendants have moved to dismiss the action on several grounds. We will\ngrant their motion in part and deny it in part.\nPlaintiffs' allegations of constitutional deprivations and state statutory violations can be divided into six\ncategories: (1) unconstitutional corporal punishment and solitary confinement; (2) general institutional conditions\nwhich violate constitutional and statutory standards (e. g., inadequate living space, heating, lighting); (3) improper\ninstitutional restraints and suppression of liberties (e. g., limitations concerning mail, visitation, recreation, clothing\nand medical care); (4) denial of adequate educational and rehabilitative services; (5) racial segregation at YSC\n143 resulting from discriminatory placement of juveniles; and (6) failure to utilize the least restrictive alternative in \n*143 confining juveniles. Plaintiffs maintain these practices are actionable under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1983, 1985\n(3), 1986, 1988, 1994 and 2000d; the first, fourth, fifth, eighth, thirteenth and fourteenth amendments of the\nUnited States Constitution; and the statutory and common law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\nNamed as defendants are: the City of Philadelphia, Mayor Frank Rizzo, Hillel Levinson (Managing Director of\nPhiladelphia), judges of the Family Court Division of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, administrators and\npersonnel of YSC, the Philadelphia School District and officials of both the Philadelphia School District and\nPennsylvania State Department of Education. Defendants are sued for overt acts committed in furtherance of the\naforementioned practices and/or their acquiescence in and toleration of the same. In addition, liability for some\ndefendants has been based upon a respondeat superior theory.\n[2]\nThe defendants'  motion to dismiss alleges that: (a) the complaint fails to meet the requirements of case or\ncontroversy; (b) this court should abstain from a decision on the merits; (c) the Family Court judges and Judge\nMontemuro are immune from suit; (d) certain defendants should be granted \"quasi-judicial\" immunity; (e) the City\nof Philadelphia is immune; (f) respondeat superior is not applicable to any defendant; (g) plaintiffs have not\nalleged facts which could constitute a violation of the eighth amendment; (h) the complaint fails to state a cause\nof action under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1985(3), 1986, 1994 and 2000d against all and/or some of the defendants; (i)\nplaintiffs have no right of privacy; and (j) this court should not exercise pendent jurisdiction over the state law\nclaims. We will deal with each of these arguments seriatim.\n\nI. CASE OR CONTROVERSY:\nDefendants claim that this action fails to meet the requirements of the case or controversy clause of Article III\nbecause plaintiffs have not alleged any \"real and immediate\" injury and thus lack the requisite \"personal stake in\nthe outcome.\" Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362, 372, 96 S.Ct. 598, 46 L.Ed.2d 561 (1976); O'Shea v. Littleton, 414\nU.S. 488, 493-94, 94 S.Ct. 669, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974). Defendants argue that it is speculative to assume that\nthe named plaintiffs will again be subjected to the conditions at YSC of which they complain and that the\nallegations of past wrongs are insufficient to raise the prospect of future harm which is needed to justify a claim\n[3]\nfor injunctive relief.  We reject this argument.\nDefendants' objection is based upon the Court's analysis in O'Shea and Goode. In O'Shea the Court concluded\nthat allegations concerning practices of racially discriminatory bond setting, sentencing and assessing of fees did\nnot meet the requirements of Article III because the complaint lacked allegations of specific instances of such\nabuse by defendants and there was no support for the assertion that there were \"continuing, present adverse\neffects\" upon plaintiffs. O'Shea, supra, 414 U.S. at 496, 94 S.Ct. 669. The Court held that before the named\nplaintiffs could seek relief for a class, they must establish the requisite case or controversy with the defendants.\nIn Goode the plaintiffs claimed that there was a pervasive pattern of illegal and unconstitutional mistreatment of\ncitizens of Philadelphia by police officers. The plaintiffs only sued supervisory officials of the City, including the\nMayor, City Managing Director, Police Commissioner and two police officials, and sought injunctive relief against\nthese officials in the form of, inter alia, a disciplinary program to discourage police misconduct. The proof at trial\n144 failed to establish either a pervasive pattern of *144 misconduct by the police or an \"affirmative link between the\noccurrence of the various incidents of police misconduct and the adoption of any plan or policy by [defendants] 00\n97\nexpress or otherwise 00 showing their authorization or approval of such misconduct.\" Goode, supra, 423 U.S. at\n97\n371, 96 S.Ct. at 604.\nThe Court concluded that plaintiffs did not demonstrate a case or controversy between themselves and\ndefendants because plaintiffs' claim to injury \"rests not upon what the named [defendants] might do to them in the\nfuture . . . but upon what one of a small, unnamed minority of policemen might do to them in the future because\nof that unknown policeman's perception of departmental disciplinary procedures.\" Id. at 372, 96 S.Ct. at 605.\nThe facts alleged in this action are significantly different from those described in O'Shea and Goode. We find that\nthere is a case or controversy between the named plaintiffs and defendants. Each named plaintiff allegedly has\nsuffered an injury due to the conditions at YSC or conduct by YSC personnel. In particular, numerous incidents of\nallegedly excessive use of corporal punishment and solitary confinement are described in the complaint. The\nsupervisory defendants (e. g., Mayor, City Managing Director, YSC Board of Managers) are linked to these\nconditions at YSC and misconduct by YSC employees because the complaint avers that this mistreatment is a\ndirect consequence of policies and practices which have been authorized or acquiesced in by these defendants.\nThis nexus is supported by the statutory duty these defendants have to maintain and supervise the facility. We\nconclude that the complaint demonstrates both injury to the named plaintiffs and defendants' connection to those\ninjuries.\nConcerning the prospect of future harm, defendants incorrectly posit the question in terms of the likelihood of the\nnamed plaintiffs' being confined again at YSC. Rather, the issue is whether the plaintiffs' class, consisting of\ncurrent and future YSC residents, is likely to suffer injury due to defendants' conduct. The complaint alleges that\nthe conditions of confinement and treatment at YSC, which apply to all YSC residents, violate the eighth\namendment. Defendants have not demonstrated that these conditions have substantially changed since the\ncomplaint was filed, and thus if violations are proven, future residents will likely suffer injuries similar to those\nallegedly inflicted on the named plaintiffs. The supervisory defendants are sufficiently linked to these conditions\nand practices because they are administratively responsible for the maintenance of YSC and allegedly have\ninitiated or acquiesced in policies and practices which have resulted in constitutional violations.\n\nII. ABSTENTION:\nDefendants suggest that we should abstain from deciding the issues involved in the suit. Without pointing to an\nexplicit legal theory of abstention, defendants emphasize that the juvenile justice system is one \"fraught with local\nconcern\" and \"permeated by state law.\" We agree but conclude that these factors are insufficient to justify federal\ncourt abstention when federal constitutional rights are involved.\nAbstention \"is an extraordinary and narrow exception to the duty of a District Court to adjudicate a controversy\nproperly before it.\" Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 813, 96 S.Ct. 1236,\n1244, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976),quoting from, County of Allegheny v. Frank Mashuda Co., 360 U.S. 185, 188-89, 79\nS.Ct. 1060, 3 L.Ed.2d 1163 (1959). There are three defined areas where abstention is appropriate. The first is \nPullman abstention. This theory requires a federal court to defer a decision in a case where a federal\nconstitutional issue is raised which is premised on an unsettled question of state law and which may be mooted\nor avoided by a resolution of the state law issue. Railroad Comm'n v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496, 500-01, 61\nS.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941). In this action there is no unclear question of state law.\n145 *145 The second circumstance where abstention is appropriate is \"where there have been presented difficult\nquestions of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial public import whose importance transcends the\nresult in the case then at bar.\" Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, supra, 424 U.S. at 814,\n96 S.Ct. at 1244; Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315, 63 S.Ct. 1098, 87 L.Ed. 1424 (1943). This type of\nabstention is only applicable when there is an extended state regulatory system or body of law that would be\nsubstantially disturbed by the resolution of a federal case. State law is not the primary question in this action.\nAdditionally, the challenge raised by plaintiffs is neither insignificant nor disruptive of otherwise valid components\nof the juvenile justice system of Pennsylvania. If constitutional violations are found, the conditions at YSC must\nbe altered to conform to constitutional proscriptions.\nThe third category which must be considered is Younger equitable restraint. In Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 91\nS.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), the Court held that a federal court could not intervene in a pending state\ncriminal proceeding absent a showing of bad faith or harassment by the officials responsible for the prosecution\nor a patently invalid state statute. Younger is premised upon notions of comity and the rule that equity ordinarily\nshould not enjoin the prosecution of a crime. The Younger principle has been applied by the Court in three cases\ninvolving state civil proceedings. Trainor v. Hernandez, ___ U.S. ___, 97 S.Ct. 1911, 52 L.Ed.2d 486 (1977); \nJuidice v. Vail, 430 U.S. 327, 97 S.Ct. 1211, 51 L.Ed.2d 376 (1977); Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U.S. 592, 95\nS.Ct. 1200, 43 L.Ed.2d 482 (1975). In each decision the Court carefully noted that it was not holding that the \nYounger doctrine applied to all civil litigation. Rather the Court has mandated Younger equitable restraint only in\ncases where the federal plaintiffs have attempted to invalidate a state statute and thereby enjoin a pending state\ncivil proceeding which was initiated by the state against these individuals and was intended to enforce or\nvindicate an important state policy. Trainor v. Hernandez, ___ U.S. at ___, 97 S.Ct. 1911. In our case there is no\npending state proceeding initiated by the state which could be disrupted by federal adjudication of this action.\nTherefore, we conclude that the Younger doctrine does not bar our consideration of plaintiffs' challenge of the\nconditions of confinement and treatment at YSC.\nThe principles underlying the Younger doctrine do have application to one claim in this suit. It would appear that a\ncomponent of plaintiffs' allegation of racial segregation is that the Family Court judges have discriminated in\ndetermining the disposition for juveniles adjudicated to be delinquent. 11 P.S. § 50-320. We believe that federal\nintervention in this decision would be inappropriate.\nIn O'Shea v. Littleton, supra, 414 U.S. at 500-01, 94 S.Ct. 669, the Court held that federal equitable relief was not\navailable in a suit claiming racial discrimination in the sentencing of black offenders by Illinois judges. The Court\nconcluded that the enforcement of a federal decision in such an action would entail \"continuous supervision by\nthe federal court over the conduct of the [judges] in the course of future criminal trial proceedings involving any of\nthe members of the . . . broadly defined class.\" Id. at 501, 94 S.Ct. at 679. This, the Court determined, would\nviolate established principles of comity as expressed in Younger. See also Bonner v. Circuit Court of the City of\nSt. Louis, 526 F.2d 1331, 1335-37 (8th Cir. 1975),cert. denied,424 U.S. 946, 96 S.Ct. 1418, 47 L.Ed.2d 353,reh.\n\ndenied,425 U.S. 926, 96 S.Ct. 1525, 47 L.Ed.2d 773 (1976); Wallace v. Kern, 520 F.2d 400, 404-08 (2d Cir.\n1975),cert. denied,424 U.S. 912, 96 S.Ct. 1109, 47 L.Ed.2d 316 (1976); Gardner v. Luckey, 500 F.2d 712, 715\n(5th Cir. 1974),cert. denied,423 U.S. 841, 96 S.Ct. 73, 46 L.Ed.2d 61 (1975).\nWe conclude that the principle stated in O'Shea requires this court to refrain from reviewing the decisional\n146 process of Family Court judges used in placing juveniles at *146 YSC following a dispositional hearing. However,\nwe conclude that the O'Shea doctrine is limited to the judicial process and that plaintiffs, therefore, may challenge\nthe criteria used to send juveniles to YSC where such confinement is not the result of a judicial proceeding.\nSimilarly, if there are institutional policies or practices at YSC which have resulted in racial segregation, these\npractices may be challenged.\nIII. IMMUNITY OF FAMILY COURT JUDGES:\nDefendants seek to have the complaint dismissed against all Family Court judges and Judge Frank Montemuro\non the ground that judges are immune from suit, regardless of the relief sought. We reject this argument.\nThe Supreme Court clearly held in Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1967), that state\njudges are immune from suits seeking damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for actions done in the performance of\ntheir judicial functions. Since plaintiffs do not request damages against the judges, this is not an issue in this\naction. However, there are two limitations placed upon judicial immunity which require us to reject the immunity\nclaim of these defendants.\nFirst, we hold that state judges are not immune from suits seeking injunctive and declaratory relief. Although the\nThird Circuit has not ruled upon this question, Conover v. Montemuro, 477 F.2d 1073, 1093 (3d Cir. 1973) (en\nbanc), the majority of courts which have explicitly considered the issue have held that no immunity exists. See \nBoyd v. Adams, 513 F.2d 83, 86-87 (7th Cir. 1975); Fowler v. Alexander, 478 F.2d 694, 696 (4th Cir. 1973); \nErdmann v. Stevens, 458 F.2d 1205, 1208 (2nd Cir.),cert. denied,409 U.S. 889, 93 S.Ct. 126, 34 L.Ed.2d 147\n(1972); United States v. McLeod, 385 F.2d 734, 738 n. 3 (5th Cir. 1967). We are convinced by these decisions\nand Judge Gibbons' well-reasoned concurrence in Conover, supra at 1096-1104, that the principles concerning\njudicial immunity analyzed in Pierson v. Ray, supra, do not apply to equitable relief.\nAccepting as true plaintiffs' allegation that the judges of the Family Court in Philadelphia, and particularly Judge\nMontemuro as Administrative Judge, have some authority over the operation of YSC pursuant to\nPa.Const.Sched. Art. 5 §§ 16(c) and (q)(ii), 11 P.S. § 442 and 17 P.S. §§ 700 and 705, they can be enjoined by a\nfederal court from continuing the allegedly unconstitutional conditions at YSC.\nThe second exception to the doctrine of judicial immunity is that judges are not immune for their non-judicial\nactivities, i. e., activities which are ministerial or administrative in nature. Lynch v. Johnson, 420 F.2d 818, 820\n(6th Cir. 1970); Doe v. County of Lake, Indiana, 399 F.Supp. 553 (N.D.Ind.1975). In County of Lake the court was\nfaced with a suit nearly identical to this action. The plaintiffs there had challenged the adequacy of a juvenile\ndetention center and the quality of treatment received while confined. The court held that the defendant-judges\nhad administrative responsibilities concerning the facility and its residents. The court concluded that the judges\nwere not immune from suit because their activities were not judicial, and any remedy implemented would \"in no\nway impair, interfere or otherwise affect the discretion required by these defendants in making case-by-case\ndecision on the merits of individual juvenile situations.\" Id. at 557-58.\nThe activities of Judge Montemuro and other Family Court judges concerning the operation of YSC are not\njudicial in that these defendants have only general jurisdiction over the detention center, 17 P.S. § 700, and must\nappoint the Board of Managers. Judge Montemuro allegedly has other administrative responsibility concerning\nprograms at YSC. We conclude that these functions are not of the type for which judicial immunity is required.\n\nIV. QUASI-JUDICIAL IMMUNITY OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND\nBOARD OF MANAGERS:\n147 The members of the Board of Managers and Executive Director of YSC seek *147 immunity from suit on the\ntheory of absolute \"quasi-judicial\" immunity. As the Supreme Court recently reiterated in Imbler v. Pachtman, 424\nU.S. 409, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976) (prosecutors given absolute immunity), governmental officials may\nbe afforded absolute immunity for functions which are a part of, or related to, the judicial process. On the other\nhand, not all supervisory officials are absolutely immune. In Wood v. Strickland, 420 U.S. 308, 95 S.Ct. 992, 43\nL.Ed.2d 214 (1975), the Court rejected a claim of absolute immunity for school board officials, even for activities\nwhich could be characterized as adjudicatory in nature. Instead, the Court permitted only a good faith defense.\nWe believe that the extension of an absolute immunity to governmental officials other than judges is narrow and\ndoes not include officials performing the functions of these defendants.\nIt is beyond question that prison officials are subject to civil suit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The management\nof YSC, like prison administration, does not involve the adjudicatory process associated with a juvenile\ndelinquency proceeding. The YSC Board of Managers and Executive Director are responsible for determining the\nconditions of confinement and the care which will be provided to YSC residents. Such decisions can only be\ncharacterized as administrative.\nIn Thompson v. Montemuro, 383 F.Supp. 1200, 1206-07 (E.D.Pa.1974), a claim of absolute immunity for YSC\nofficials was rejected. We concur with the Thompson decision and hold that these defendants are not sufficiently\ninvolved in the judicial process of the Family Court to warrant an absolute immunity for their conduct.\nTo the extent that these defendants are attempting to raise the qualified immunity extended to other public\nofficials by Wood v. Strickland, supra, we find that we cannot rule upon that issue. At this stage of the\nproceedings there is insufficient evidence in the record to determine the merits of defendants' good faith defense.\nImbler v. Pachtman, supra, 424 U.S. at 419, 96 S.Ct. 984 n. 13; Fidtler v. Rundle, 497 F.2d 794, 801 (3d Cir.\n1974).\nV. IMMUNITY OF THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA:\nIt is clear that the City of Philadelphia cannot be sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 because it is not a \"person\" within\nthe meaning of that statute. City of Kenosha v. Bruno, 412 U.S. 507, 93 S.Ct. 2222, 37 L.Ed.2d 109 (1973); \nMonroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961). However, jurisdiction is alleged pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. § 1331 since the amount in controversy is alleged to be in excess of ten thousand dollars ($10,000),\nand plaintiffs assert a claim against the City directly under the fourteenth amendment.\nSeveral courts in this district have held that there can be a cause of action against the City via the fourteenth\namendment under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. See, e. g., Drennon v. Philadelphia General Hospital, 428 F.Supp. 809\n(E.D.Pa.1977) (Higginbotham, J.); Santore v. City of Philadelphia, C.A. No. 76-904 (E.D.Pa. September 28, 1976)\n(Newcomer, J.); Rice v. City of Philadelphia, C.A. No. 73-895 (E.D.Pa. January 21, 1976) (Fullam, J.); Maybanks\nv. Ingraham, 378 F.Supp. 913 (E.D.Pa.1974) (Lord, C. J.). But other courts in the district have rejected this claim. \nSee, e. g., Jones v. McElroy, 429 F.Supp. 848 (E.D.Pa.1977) (Luongo, J.); Crosley v. Davis, 426 F.Supp. 389\n(E.D.Pa. 1977) (Becker, J.); Pitrone v. Mercadante, 420 F.Supp. 1384 (E.D.Pa.1976) (Ditter, J.).\nWe concur with the analysis of Judge Higginbotham in Drennon v. Philadelphia General Hospital, supra, and\ntherefore reaffirm our holding in Maybanks v. Ingraham, supra, that a cause of action directly under the fourteenth\namendment can exist against a governmental entity. Given the extensive discussion of this issue by other district\ncourt opinions and the pendency of a Third Circuit decision on this subject, we believe further elaboration at this\ntime would not be useful. We therefore will deny the City's motion without prejudice.\n\nVI. RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR:\n148 Plaintiffs have sought to impose liability upon several of the defendants not only for *148 their direct or indirect\nparticipation in the alleged constitutional deprivations, but also based upon a theory of respondeat superior.\nDefendants challenge this theory of liability arguing that respondeat superior is never available in a § 1983 claim.\nWe agree with defendants that city and state officials, including the Mayor, City Managing Director, judges of the\nFamily Court, members of the Board of Managers, and Executive Director of YSC cannot be held vicariously\nliable for acts of subordinates; but we conclude that respondeat superior can be applied to the City of\nPhiladelphia in a direct cause of action under the fourteenth amendment.\nA. 42 U.S.C. § 1983\nThe viability of respondeat superior in civil rights litigation has a confused and often misunderstood evolution. The\napparent majority position is that vicarious liability has no place in a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action. See, e. g., Johnson\nv. Glick, 481 F.2d 1028, 1033-34 (2d Cir.),cert. denied,414 U.S. 1033, 94 S.Ct. 462, 38 L.Ed.2d 32 (1973); \nJennings v. Davis, 476 F.2d 1271, 1274-75 (8th Cir. 1973); Adams v. Pate, 445 F.2d 105, 107 n. 2 (7th Cir. 1971).\nHowever, careful scrutiny of these cases reveals that the plaintiffs were attempting to impose vicarious liability\nagainst supervisory officials for acts by their subordinates. As several courts have recognized, this is\ninappropriate because supervisors and their subordinates are fellow servants of the same master-employer (e.\ng., the City) and thus the master-servant relationship, a prerequisite for vicarious liability, is lacking between\nthese individuals. Goode v. Rizzo, 506 F.2d 542, 550 (3d Cir. 1974),rev'd on other grounds,423 U.S. 362, 96\nS.Ct. 598, 46 L.Ed.2d 561 (1976); Jennings v. Davis, supra at 1275; Carter v. Carlson, 144 U.S. App.D.C. 388,\n447 F.2d 358, 370 n. 39 (1971),rev'd on other grounds sub nom., District of Columbia v. Carter, 409 U.S. 418, 93\nS.Ct. 602, 34 L.Ed.2d 613 (1973); Delaney v. Dias, 415 F.Supp. 1351, 1354-55 (D.Mass.1976).\nSubsequent decisions have erroneously cited these earlier opinions for the broader proposition that respondeat\nsuperior is never available in a § 1983 action, seemingly because of something inherent, albeit invisible, in §\n1983 itself. The cases so holding uniformly do so without any reasoning to support their conclusion. We disagree\nwith this latter approach. We hold that the supervisory officials named as defendants here cannot be held\nviciously liable because, and only because, there is no relationship of master and servant between these\ndefendants and the YSC employees for whose acts liability is sought to be imposed. They are simply fellow\nservants of the same master.\nB. FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT\nThe remaining challenge of the application of respondeat superior has been made by the City of Philadelphia.\nThe City is the master of its employees, and thus the defect noted in the § 1983 claim against supervisors is not\npresent in this claim. See Carter v. Carlson, supra, 447 F.2d at 367 n.24. Since the only cause of action against\nthe City must be based directly upon the fourteenth amendment, the issue is whether vicarious liability is\navailable in that cause of action.\nWe conclude that the policy justifying respondeat superior in tort law has equal force in an action under the\nfourteenth amendment. As Professor Prosser has noted, respondeat superior is a deliberate allocation of risk by\nwhich the costs, arising from anticipated harm to innocent individuals caused by actions of employees, are borne\nby the employer. This is reasonable since the employer, rather than the injured party, is in a better position to\nabsorb the costs, insure against them and distribute the cost to society. W. Prosser, The Law of Torts 459 (4th ed.\n1971). A governmental entity can only act through its employees and therefore the official acts of such employees\nare rightfully attributed to that employer-entity.\nThe need for respondeat superior in a fourteenth amendment claim is particularly compelling because that\n149 provision is intended by its terms to protect individual rights from abuse by municipalities and *149 other\n[4]\nrepositories of state power.  This reasoning has uniformly been accepted; those courts which have held that\n\none can assert a § 1331 claim against a municipality, also have approved the inclusion of respondeat superior in\nthat cause of action. Culp v. Devlin, C.A. No. 77-44, 437 F.Supp. 20 at 23-24 (E.D.Pa. May 25, 1977); Shifrin v.\nWilson, 412 F.Supp. 1282, 1306-08 (D.D.C. 1976); Croy v. Skinner, 410 F.Supp. 117, 123-24 (N.D.Ga.1976); \nCollum v. Yurkovich, 409 F.Supp. 557, 559 (N.D.Ill.1975); Williams v. Brown, 398 F.Supp. 155, 160-61\n(N.D.Ill.1975).\nVII. CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT:\nDefendants argue that plaintiffs' amended complaint fails to allege facts which could constitute a violation of the\neighth amendment. In particular, the defendants suggest that the scope of review by a federal court concerning\nthe conditions of institutional confinement is severely limited and that the alleged facts do not amount to a\nsituation which is \"barbarous\" or \"shocks the conscience\", justifying federal intervention. We disagree.\nNotions of comity and the limitations placed upon the use of federal equitable power restrain federal courts from\nintruding into daily operation of state agencies. But federal courts also have the clear obligation to terminate\nconditions and actions which violate constitutional rights, particularly for those who are powerless to end such\nabuse. We find that the eighth amendment applies to the confinement of juveniles and prohibits conditions which\nare so inhumane and degrading to human dignity that they shock the conscience. The Court has held that this\namendment \"must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing\nsociety,\" Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101, 78 S.Ct. 590, 598, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958), and therefore review of\ninstitutional treatment mandates detailed scrutiny of the conditions of such confinement.\nPlaintiffs have challenged almost all aspects of the conditions of confinement and treatment at YSC. We note that\nconditions analogous to those challenged here have been declared unconstitutional by other federal courts. See \nPena v. N.Y. State Division for Youth, 419 F.Supp. 203 (S.D.N. Y.1976); Morales v. Turman, 364 F.Supp. 166\n(E.D.Tex.1973),rev'd. on other grounds,535 F.2d 864 (5th Cir. 1976),rev'd.430 U.S. 322, 97 S.Ct. 1189, 51\nL.Ed.2d 368 (1977); Martarella v. Kelley, 349 F.Supp. 575 (S.D. N.Y.1972); Inmates of Boys' Training School v.\nAffleck, 346 F.Supp. 1354 (D.R.I. 1972). Use of excessive corporal punishment, solitary confinement, restraint of\nliberties, and inadequate treatment have been proscribed in these cases. Only after a factual hearing, will we be\nable to determine whether or to what extent the conditions at YSC violate the eighth amendment. We cannot\nconclude that plaintiffs will be able to prove no set of facts which would amount to a constitutional violation and\ntherefore we must deny defendants' motion.\nVIII. 42 U.S.C. § 1983:\nSeveral defendants, including the Mayor, City Managing Director, judges of the Family Court and Executive\nDirector and Board of Managers of YSC, seek to have the suit dismissed against them on the ground that\nplaintiffs have failed to allege sufficient facts to demonstrate that these defendants participated in alleged\nconstitutional deprivations. Relying on Rizzo v. Goode, supra, these supervisory defendants assert that absent a\nshowing of a plan or \"deliberate, affirmative actions\" by them which have deprived plaintiffs of their federal rights,\nthese defendants cannot be held liable. In addition, certain YSC personnel, those who have not been identified in\n150 the complaint as having participated in a specific incident of *150 mistreatment, seek dismissal of the suit against\nthem because they have not been linked to constitutional deprivations.\nBefore analyzing the specific allegations concerning each of these defendants, it is first necessary to establish\nthe principles which control liability in a § 1983 action. There are two essential components to a § 1983 claim;\nplaintiffs must demonstrate, first, that they have been or will be deprived of a federally protected right and\nsecond, that culpable conduct or inaction by defendants has \"caused\" that deprivation. Since we have found that\nplaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to plead an eighth amendment claim, we are only concerned here with the\nsecond element, which analyzes defendants' participation in and responsibility for deprivation of a federal right.\nCourts have struggled with this issue. In developing a legal standard they have encountered two questions: first,\nin analyzing defendants' conduct, what degree of culpability must be established to justify liability, i. e., is it\nsufficient to show that defendants were negligent or must their conduct be intentional; and second, to what extent\n\nmust defendants' conduct \"cause\" the alleged constitutional deprivation, i. e., must defendant directly participate\nin the violation or can a failure to act or to supervise others justify liability.\nIn analyzing these questions one must begin with the Court's statement in Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 81\nS.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961), that § 1983 \"should be read against the background of tort liability that makes a\nman responsible for the natural consequences of his actions.\" Id. at 187, 81 S.Ct. at 484. This language suggests\nthat negligent conduct which proximately causes the deprivation of a federal right can justify liability. However,\nsome courts have ignored or deviated from this tort analogy. In part this deviation is required because in certain\ncases the constitutional deprivation itself, i. e., the first element of a § 1983 claim, requires that the defendant\nexhibit intentional conduct. For example, in Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976),\nthe Court held that plaintiffs must demonstrate a \"deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners\" in\norder to establish a violation of the eighth amendment on the basis of a denial of adequate medical care in\nprison. 429 U.S. at 104, 97 S.Ct. at 291,id. at 260 (emphasis added). Courts have also varied the tort analogy\naccording to the relief requested, usually requiring less connection with the constitutional violation when only\nequitable relief is sought in contrast to damages. To the extent that courts have rejected the tort analogy for other\nreasons, we disagree.\nWe conclude that a § 1983 claim may be founded upon negligent conduct by a defendant unless the specific\nconstitutional violation alleged requires a greater degree of culpability. See, e. g., Navarette v. Enomoto, 536 F.2d\n277, 281-82 (9th Cir. 1976); Howell v. Cataldi, 464 F.2d 272, 279 (3d Cir. 1972); Culp v. Devlin, 437 F.Supp. 20\n(E.D.Pa.1977) (Newcomer, J.). Cf. Shifrin v. Wilson, supra at 1301-02. We find no limiting language in § 1983 or\nits legislative history which would suggest that Congress intended any greater degree of culpability than\nnegligence on the part of defendants. Rather, § 1983 states that any person who \"subjects, or causes to be\nsubjected\" another to a deprivation of a right \"shall be liable\". 42 U.S.C. § 1983. It does not state that the\ndefendant must wilfully or intentionally cause that deprivation. In the development of official immunity under §\n1983, a concept related to the issue of culpability, the Court has held that an official has no immunity if he or she \"\nreasonably should have known that the action he took\" violated a clearly established constitutional right. Wood v.\nStrickland, supra, 420 U.S. at 322, 95 S.Ct. at 1001 (emphasis added). We conclude that the statute and case\nlaw, see Navarette v. Enomoto, supra at 281 n.4 (cases cited therein), concerning § 1983 support the conclusion\nthat only negligent conduct on the part of a defendant must be proven to justify liability under § 1983, unless the\n151 Court has specifically held that greater culpability is required because *151 of the constitutional violation under\nreview.\nDefendants' argument that plaintiffs must demonstrate that the supervisory defendants took \"deliberate\" actions\nin depriving plaintiffs' rights, appears to rely upon Rizzo v. Goode, supra. We disagree that Goode stands for the\nproposition that intentional conduct is mandated in a § 1983 claim. A careful reading of the opinion reveals that\nthe defendants could not be held liable for constitutional violations caused by subordinate policemen because the\nCourt concluded that no action by defendants, be it intentional or negligent, was linked causally to any\nconstitutional deprivation. The lack of causation rather than culpable conduct was the deficiency in that suit.\nAs previously noted, in certain cases a greater degree of culpability is required in a § 1983 claim because the\nspecific constitutional deprivation necessitates intentional conduct. Two claims in this action are affected by this\nrule. The Court has held that purposeful discrimination is an element of a violation of the Equal Protection Clause\nof the fourteenth amendment. Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S.\n252, 97 S.Ct. 555, 50 L.Ed.2d 450, 464 (1977); Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239-41, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 48\nL.Ed.2d 597 (1976). Similarly in Estelle v. Gamble, supra, the Court required \"deliberate indifference to serious\nmedical needs\" to plead an eighth amendment violation. See also Hampton v. Holmesburg Prison Officials, 546\nF.2d 1077, 1080-81 (3d Cir. 1976). In contrast, the Ninth Circuit has held that negligent denial of first amendment\nrights of prisoners is actionable under § 1983. Navarette v. Enomoto, supra at 281-82.\nTo the extent that racial segregation at YSC is challenged, intentional action must be alleged in order to plead a\nconstitutional deprivation. Similarly, intentional conduct must be shown in the denial of adequate medical\ntreatment by the defendants. But we also concur with the Ninth Circuit and hold that negligent denial of first\namendment rights may be actionable. As to the other claims of constitutional violations we conclude that it would\nbe inappropriate at this time to rule upon the degree of culpability required of defendants for each alleged\n\nviolation. Instead, this element of the cause of action should be analyzed after the record has been developed\nconcerning the conditions and treatment at YSC. We hold that the complaint is sufficient to meet the culpability\nrequirement of § 1983 because plaintiffs have pleaded alternative theories of intentional and negligent conduct\non the part of each defendant; it is alleged that these officials implemented unconstitutional policies at YSC and\nfailed to remedy unconstitutional conditions and practices which they knew, or should have known, existed at\nYSC.\nThe second aspect of the participation element of a § 1983 claim is the causation question. Courts have\nstruggled with this question in the context of determining the liability of a supervisor where the plaintiff has\nsuffered a constitutional deprivation due to the misconduct of subordinates. The cases suggest that relief may not\nbe obtained against supervisors unless they have participated in the offending conduct or have knowledge of and\nacquiesced in the constitutional deprivation. See, e. g., Hampton v. Holmesburg Prison Officials, supra at 1082; \nBlack v. Brown, 513 F.2d 652, 654 n.3 (5th Cir. 1975); United States ex rel. Bennett v. Prasse, 408 F.Supp. 988,\n991 (E.D.Pa.1976); Fialkowski v. Shapp, 405 F.Supp. 946, 950 (E.D.Pa.1975). But in applying the \"knowledge\nand acquiescence\" standard, courts have had difficulty in specifying precise criteria for judging liability. They have\nconsidered the following factors: the knowledge a defendant-supervisor has, or should have, of the conduct of\nsubordinates; the degree of authority and control the supervisor has over the conduct of subordinates; the\nexistence vel non of policies or practices within the supervisor's governmental department which relate to the\noffending conduct; and the extent to which the supervisor has encouraged or acquiesced in these practices and/\nor subordinates' misconduct.\n152 *152 Three principles must be applied in analyzing these factors. First, the greater the duty a supervisor has to\ncontrol those employees who actually committed the violation, the less specific knowledge of the offending\nconduct the supervisor will be required to have. For example, in Fialkowski v. Shapp, supra, the court stated:\n\"The cases do suggest, however, that in situations where an official has direct supervisory control\nover persons committing the alleged violations, the supervisor's general knowledge of the\nsituation triggers an affirmative duty to investigate further. Assuming that a valid constitutional\nclaim has been raised, the official's failure to take any disciplinary action against his subordinates\nconstitutes a breach of the duty owed to those persons injured and a direct cause of their\ncontinuing deprivations.\"\nId. at 950. See also Holland v. Connors, 491 F.2d 539 (5th Cir. 1974); Wright v. McMann, 460 F.2d 126 (2nd Cir.),\ncert. denied,409 U.S. 885, 93 S.Ct. 115, 34 L.Ed.2d 141 (1972); Moon v. Winfield, 368 F.Supp. 843 (N.D.Ill.1973)\n. Once a duty is established, failure to act is actionable under § 1983. Hupart v. Board of Higher Education of City\nof N. Y., 420 F.Supp. 1087, 1109 (S.D.N.Y.1976); McKee v. Breier, 417 F.Supp. 189, 190 (E.D.Wis.1976).\nIn contrast, when liability is sought against higher officials who have less direct supervisory control, general\nknowledge of misconduct and a failure to act will not suffice to prove that these superiors were responsible for the\ndeprivation of rights by subordinates. In these situations in order to justify relief against these defendants, the\nplaintiff must show specific knowledge of the misdeeds and specific evidence of approval or acquiescence by the\nofficial in the constitutional deprivation. See, e. g., Fialkowski v. Shapp, supra at 952-54; Pinon v. State of Wis.,\n368 F.Supp. 608, 611 (E.D.Wis.1973); Downs v. Dept. of Public Welfare, 368 F.Supp. 454, 464-65 (E.D.Pa. 1973)\n.\nThe second principle which we derive from the application of these various factors is that the existence of general\npolicies and practices within the supervisor's department can create a constructive knowledge on his or her part\nof the alleged constitutional deprivation. In addition, acceptance or support of these policies and practices can\nsubstitute for proof that the supervisor acquiesced in the particular misdeed of subordinates. In Holland v.\nConnors, supra, the Fifth Circuit held a complaint by a prisoner was sufficient to state a cause of action against a\nprison superintendent where the prisoner alleged that the superintendent was legally responsible for an\nunconstitutional interrogation by prison guards because \"such practices were so widespread and had been\nstandard procedure at the institution for so long that he was or must have been aware of them\" even though the\nsuperintendent was not present during the specific questioning involved in the case. Id. at 541. See also Black v.\nBrown, supra at 654 n.3; Tucker v. City of Montgomery Board of Comm'r, 410 F.Supp. 494, 508 (M.D.Ala.1976).\n\nCausation is established here from the fact that the subordinate's action is an implementation of the policies or\npractices endorsed by the supervisor.\nWe conclude that the decision in Rizzo v. Goode, supra, does not conflict with the principles of causation\npreviously described. The plaintiffs in Goode sought injunctive relief against supervisory officials of Philadelphia\nto halt an allegedly pervasive pattern of misconduct by city policemen directed against the plaintiff class. The trial\ncourt did not find a pervasive pattern but did describe approximately 20 incidents of illegal action and concluded\nthat \"violations of constitutional rights by police do occur in an unacceptably high number of instances.\" COPPAR\nv. Rizzo, 357 F.Supp. 1289, 1321 (E.D.Pa.1973). The Supreme Court reversed the grant of injunctive relief\nbecause the facts established at trial failed to show any link between the misconduct by policemen and a plan or\npolicy of defendants 00\"express or otherwise 00 showing their authorization or approval\" of the misconduct. Rizzo\n97 97\n153 v. Goode, supra, 423 U.S. at *153 371, 96 S.Ct. at 604. Instead, the Court emphasized the trial court's findings\nthat the constitutional violations were due to the actions of a minority of policemen and that the problems existing\nin the police department were similar to those encountered in any major urban area. The Court concluded that a\nfailure to act by these officials in light of the limited statistical pattern of misconduct shown at trial would not justify\nfederal court intervention into the operation of the city's police department.\nThe Third Circuit has followed Goode in Lewis v. Hyland, 554 F.2d 93 (3d Cir. 1977), in which it upheld the trial\ncourt's denial of injunctive relief sought by travelers on New Jersey roads against New Jersey officials, including\nthe Attorney General and Superintendent of State Police, for alleged violations of fourth amendment rights by\nstate police. The Third Circuit concluded that there was no causal link between the defendants and the proven\nmisdeeds because the trial court found no pattern or practice of violation of constitutional rights by the officials\nand \"[t]hose instances of illegality were no more than willful and random acts on the part of a minority of the\nTroopers.\" Id. at 100.\nIn Goode and Lewis the causation requirement of § 1983 was not satisfied because the courts concluded that\nany failure to act by these defendant-officials was not responsible for the limited number of violations perpetrated\nby a small percentage of subordinate employees. In addition, there was no affirmative conduct taken by the\ndefendants to encourage such activity; plaintiffs failed to show any department-wide plan, policies or practices\nwhich could be linked to the instances of police misconduct. Implicit in Goode, though, is the notion that a \npervasive pattern of abuse may justify federal intervention into the operation of a police department. Rizzo v.\nGoode, supra, 423 U.S. at 373-75, 96 S.Ct. 598.\nWe conclude that these decisions are dependent upon the specific factual setting developed at trial and that the\nCourt was not holding that a failure to act or supervise may never be causally linked to subsequent abuse by\nsubordinates. Several circuits have approved relief where supervisory officials have failed to act in the face of\n[5]\nconstitutional violations,  and decisions since Goode have continued to recognize this theory of liability. See, e.\ng., Sims v. Adams, 537 F.2d 829, 831-32 (5th Cir. 1976); Hupart v. Bd. of Higher Ed. of City of New York, supra at\n1109; McKee v. Breier, supra at 191. Cf. Shifrin v. Wilson, supra at 1301 n.22.\nThe final principle which we will apply is that the degree of participation required of a particular defendant is less\nwhen only injunctive relief is requested if the court determines that some equitable relief is necessary to prevent\nconstitutional violations. Downs v. Dept. of Public Welfare, 368 F.Supp. 454 (E.D.Pa.1973). In such cases the\ninclusion of additional defendants does not substantially increase the scope of the remedy imposed by the court\nbut does improve the effectiveness of such relief. We distinguish this situation from Goode because, in that case,\nthere was no causal link to any departmental official and therefore the need for injunctive relief directed toward\nthe entire police force was not justified.\nApplying these principles to this case, we conclude that plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to establish the\ndefendants' participation in constitutional violations concerning the class claim for equitable relief, but we find the\ncomplaint inadequate against the Mayor and City Managing Director for the claim of damages on behalf of the\nnamed plaintiffs.\n\nA. BOARD OF MANAGERS and EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF YSC\n154 These defendants argue that they cannot be held liable for alleged constitutional *154 violations because\nplaintiffs have failed to allege that these defendants have directly or indirectly participated in the circumstances\ngiving rise to plaintiffs' claims or have taken any deliberate affirmative action to deprive plaintiffs of their rights.\nWe disagree with this summarization of the complaint and find that plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to link\nthese defendants to constitutional violations.\nIn the class action claim plaintiffs assert that there are institutional policies and practices established or accepted\nby these defendants concerning the physical environment, disciplinary practices, restraints on liberties and denial\nof treatment and rehabilitative services which offend constitutional mandates. Given these allegations and the\n[6]\nstatutory duty of the Board to manage and supervise YSC pursuant to 11 P.S. § 443,  we conclude that the\nparticipation requirement of § 1983 has been satisfactorily alleged. The Executive Director, as the immediate\nsupervisor of YSC, a fortiori is sufficiently connected to and responsible for the environment at YSC to be\nincluded in the claim for injunctive relief.\nIn terms of the damage claims by the individual named plaintiffs, we believe that the complaint is likewise\nsufficient to include these defendants, given the allegation that excessive use of corporal punishment and solitary\nconfinement is a primary method of enforcing discipline and that routinely children are subjected to violence by\nstaff personnel. Here we have both an allegation of a policy implemented by these defendants and an allegation\nof a pervasive pattern of abuse which links these defendants to the violations.\nB. ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE MONTEMURO and JUDGES OF THE\nFAMILY COURT\nThe involvement of the judges of the Family Court in the operation of YSC is more attenuated than that of the\nprevious defendants, but since only equitable relief has been requested against them, we find that the complaint\nis sufficient. The allegations concerning Judge Montemuro suggest that he has substantial input into the\nmanagement of YSC due to his position as Administrative Judge and his alleged participation in the planning of\nYSC programs. The remaining Family Court judges are less involved but do exert some authority over the\ninstitution, including the appointment of the Board of Managers and the \"exclusive jurisdiction over all houses of\ndetention,\" pursuant to Pa.Const. Sched. Art. 5 §§ 16(c) and (q)(ii), 11 P.S. § 442 and 17 P.S. §§ 700 and 705.\nAlthough minimal, this participation in YSC management is adequate to justify their inclusion in the suit based\nupon the allegation that the policies and practices of the Board of Managers have resulted in constitutional\ndeprivations.\nC. MAYOR FRANK RIZZO and MANAGING DIRECTOR HILLEL\nLEVINSON\nWe find that the allegation concerning defendants Rizzo and Levinson are inadequate to justify a damage claim\nby the named plaintiffs, but that the complaint is minimally sufficient to include them in the claims for equitable\nrelief relating to the overall conditions and practices at YSC. Plaintiffs maintain that defendants Rizzo and\nLevinson knew of the allegedly unconstitutional conditions and practices at YSC. The inclusion of these\ndefendants in the suit by the class is justified because of the allegations of defendants' knowledge of abuses,\ntheir statutory authority over the funding of YSC, 11 P.S. § 447 and their administrative duties pursuant to\nPhiladelphia Home Rule Charter §§ 4.4-100 to -106 and 5.5-100 to -102.\n155 As to the damage claim of the individual plaintiffs, we find that the allegations *155 against Rizzo and Levinson\nare too conclusory and nonspecific to justify liability. The plaintiffs have not alleged facts to demonstrate the\nknowledge and acquiescence of these defendants in the particular incidents of violence or the alleged practice of\nexcessive force and restraints by YSC personnel used against the named plaintiffs. Since these defendants have\n\nlimited authority to control such activity, an allegation of general knowledge is insufficient to plead liability for\ndamages. In light of Goode, we find that it would be inappropriate to infer some causal connection between these\ndefendants' conduct and the specific abuses based upon the pattern of violence described in the complaint.\nTherefore, the named plaintiffs' claim against these defendants will be dismissed without prejudice.\nD. YSC STAFF\nDefendants also move to dismiss the suit against those employees at YSC who have not been named in any\nspecific allegation of violence by staff toward YSC residents. We find that the claim for equitable relief on behalf\nof the class is sufficient to include all YSC personnel because there is an allegation of a practice by these\ndefendants of using excessive corporal punishment and solitary confinement for discipline. As to the claim for\ndamages by the named plaintiffs, we believe that at this point in the proceeding, the claims against the staff are\nminimally adequate because of the alleged pattern of staff violence and that plaintiffs should be given the\nopportunity to continue discovery to identify all those involved in staff misconduct.\nIX. 42 U.S.C. §§ 1985(3) AND 1986:\nPlaintiffs claim that Judge Montemuro, members of the Board of Managers, YSC Executive Director and YSC\nstaff have violated 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) by agreeing \"either expressly or impliedly, to impose, perpetrate or fail to\nremedy the allegedly unconstitutional conditions and practices at YSC.\" Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint ¶ 70(d).\nThese defendants challenge this claim on the ground that plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged facts to justify\neither an accusation of a conspiracy among these defendants or an accusation of overt acts in furtherance of that\nconspiracy. We find that plaintiffs have adequately pleaded a § 1985(3) claim against these defendants.\nSection 1985(3) creates a cause of action whenever an individual has been injured due to a conspiracy motivated\nby invidious discrimination which has resulted in a deprivation of rights secured by the Constitution or federal\nstatute. See Griffin v. Breckenridge, 403 U.S. 88, 91 S.Ct. 1790, 29 L.Ed.2d 338 (1971); Local No. 1 (ACA) v.\nI.B.T., C., W. & H., 419 F.Supp. 263, 275 (E.D.Pa.1976). Since we have found that plaintiffs have alleged a\ndeprivation of their rights by these defendants in our analysis of § 1983, we must decide in this claim whether\nplaintiffs have averred sufficient facts to support an allegation that: (1) defendants conspired to deprive plaintiffs\nof their rights; (2) defendants were motivated by \"class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus\", Griffin v.\nBreckenridge, supra, 403 U.S. at 102, 91 S.Ct. 1790; and (3) overt acts have been committed in furtherance of\n[7]\nthe conspiracy.\nPlaintiffs' complaint satisfies the conspiracy element of § 1985(3). Conspiracy in this context means that the co-\nconspirators must have agreed, at least tacitly, to commit acts which will deprive plaintiff of equal protection of the\n156 law. *156 The complaint requires that we infer an agreement based upon the allegations that the unconstitutional\nconditions and practices at YSC were due to policies and practices approved or accepted by the Board of\nManagers, Judge Montemuro and YSC Executive Director and implemented by YSC staff. We conclude that at\nthis stage of the proceedings such an inference is reasonable. We find that it is likely that decisions, applicable to\nthe entire institution, control the allegedly unconstitutional physical conditions at YSC, limitations placed upon\nliberties, lack of educational and rehabilitative services, use of abusive disciplinary techniques and the admission\ncriteria at YSC. Since the supervisory defendants are allegedly responsible for such decisions and the YSC staff\nhave allegedly enforced them, it is reasonable to infer that a tacit agreement among these defendants exists\nconcerning conditions at YSC.\nWe also find that plaintiffs' complaint satisfies the requirement that defendants' actions must be motivated by\ndiscriminatory animus. There has been extensive discussion in the courts concerning whether and to what extent\nthe term \"class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus\" can be applied beyond racial discrimination. See, e. g., \nMcLellan v. Miss. Power & Light Co., 545 F.2d 919, 928 (5th Cir. 1977) (en banc); Phillips v. Trello, 502 F.2d\n1000, 1005 (3d Cir. 1974). We hold that this element is met if the plaintiff can allege that there is discrimination\nagainst a well-defined class, Cameron v. Brock, 473 F.2d 608, 610 (6th Cir. 1973), and that such discrimination:\n\n(1) affects a traditionally disadvantaged group (e. g., \"suspect\" classification); (2) is irrational; or (3) unnecessarily\nburdens plaintiff's exercise of a \"fundamental\" right. Local No. 1 (ACA) v. I.B.T., C., W. & H., supra at 277.\nIn terms of plaintiffs' claim of racial segregation this prerequisite is clearly satisfied because such discrimination\ninvolves a suspect class. As to plaintiffs' claims that the conditions and practices at YSC violate the first, fourth,\nfifth and eighth amendments, we conclude that the plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged a well-defined class whose\n\"fundamental\" rights have been affected to meet this element of a § 1985(3) claim.\nThe final prerequisite of § 1985(3) is the existence of an overt act by a co-conspirator in furtherance of the\nconspiracy. As to the claim of excessive corporal punishment and solitary confinement, we find that this element\nis satisfied by the actions of the staff who allegedly are enforcing practices and procedures approved by YSC\nmanagement. Defendants' placement of juveniles at YSC satisfies the requirement of overt acts for claims of\nunconstitutional conditions, racial segregation and lack of care at YSC.\nIn addition to the § 1985(3) claim, plaintiffs assert that defendants Rizzo and Levinson have violated 42 U.S.C. §\n1986 because they knew of the conspiracy previously described, had an opportunity to prevent the resultant\ndeprivation of rights and neglected or failed to prevent such violations. This cause of action requires that a\ndefendant know of a § 1985(3) conspiracy and \"having power to prevent or aid in preventing the commission of\nthe same, neglects or refuses so to do . . ..\" 42 U.S.C. § 1986. It can only be pleaded once plaintiffs have\nsufficiently alleged a § 1985(3) violation. Hahn v. Sargent, 523 F.2d 461, 470 (1st Cir. 1975),cert. denied,425\nU.S. 904, 96 S.Ct. 1495, 47 L.Ed.2d 754 (1976).\nWe find that the complaint is minimally adequate to plead a § 1986 cause of action on behalf of the class based\nupon unconstitutional overall conditions at YSC because: (1) we accept the allegation of a § 1985 conspiracy; (2)\nplaintiffs have alleged that through reports by state and city officials these defendants were aware of the\npractices at YSC for which the co-conspirators are allegedly responsible; and (3) these defendants have some\nauthority, although limited, to control policies and practices at YSC pursuant to the Philadelphia Home Rule\nCharter and 11 P.S. § 447.\nX. 42 U.S.C. § 1994:\n157 Plaintiffs assert that some YSC residents have been forced to work without *157 compensation and thereby have\nbeen subjected to involuntary servitude in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1994 and the thirteenth amendment.\nDefendants argue that these provisions are not applicable to these plaintiffs. We disagree.\nSection 1994 is intended to implement the thirteenth amendment and as such the boundaries of its application\nmust be derived from that amendment. Although we are not certain as to the full scope of § 1994, at this point in\nthe proceedings we cannot conclude that plaintiffs will be able to prove no set of facts that would amount to a\nthirteenth amendment violation.\nThe Supreme Court stated in Pollock v. Williams, 322 U.S. 4, 64 S.Ct. 792, 88 L.Ed. 1095 (1944), \"[t]he\nundoubted aim of the Thirteenth Amendment . . . was not merely to end slavery but to maintain a system of\ncompletely free and voluntary labor throughout the United States.\" Id. at 17, 64 S.Ct. at 799. Defendants argue\nthat the thirteenth amendment's prohibition was intended to abolish peonage and is not available to these\nplaintiffs because it does not apply to persons convicted of a crime. See Kent v. Prosse, 265 F.Supp. 673, 674\n(W.D.Pa.),aff'd,385 F.2d 406 (3d Cir. 1967). Assuming, without deciding, that defendants' statement of the law\nwith respect to prisoners is correct, we do not believe that the same rule should apply to these plaintiffs. Several\ncourts have recognized a claim under the thirteenth amendment in cases of civil commitment to mental health\ninstitutions. Jobson v. Henne, 355 F.2d 129 (2d Cir. 1966); Downs v. Dept. of Public Welfare, 368 F.Supp. 454\n(E.D.Pa.1973); Wyatt v. Stickney, 344 F.Supp. 373 (M.D. Ala.1972). In addition, the court in King v. Carey, 405\nF.Supp. 41 (W.D.N.Y.1975), held that juvenile delinquents committed to two camps of the New York State Division\nfor Youth could raise a claim of involuntary servitude in a situation substantially similar to this action.\nDeclaring that juveniles confined at YSC are prisoners or civilly committed persons should not control the\noutcome of this constitutional claim. Rather, the justification for confining juveniles should determine the\n\nappropriateness of work assignments for YSC residents. We find that a full record is necessary to make this\ncomplex analysis; therefore defendants' motion to dismiss § 1994 and thirteenth amendment claims must be\ndenied.\nXI. 42 U.S.C. § 2000d:\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d et seq., prohibits racial discrimination in any program\nfunded by federal financing. Plaintiffs assert that there is racial discrimination in the placement of juveniles at\nYSC, that YSC is partially financed by federal funds, and that such segregation can therefore be challenged as a\nviolation of 42 U.S.C. § 2000d.\nDefendants object to this cause of action, claiming that plaintiffs must exhaust their administrative remedies as a\nprerequisite to suit in federal court. Plaintiffs respond that they are not required to exhaust administrative\n[8]\nremedies because the exhaustion requirement arises from 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-2  which is intended for review of\n158 federal agency action taken pursuant to § 2000d-1[9]. Plaintiffs argue that since *158 they are not objecting to\nany federal agency action, the exhaustion requirement of § 2000d-2 is inapplicable to them. In addition plaintiffs\nargue that the issues involved in this action are legal and are not addressed to a particular area of administrative\nexpertise and that exhaustion, therefore, is not necessary.\nWe conclude that plaintiffs' theory of exhaustion under 42 U.S.C. § 2000d is too restrictive. Although an\nexhaustion requirement arises directly from § 2000d-2, we find that exhaustion may be implied as a prerequisite\nto any action pursuant to § 2000d et seq. because of the enforcement policies implicit in Title VI. As the court\nstated in Johnson v. County of Chester, 413 F.Supp. 1299, 1310 (E.D.Pa.1976), \"[t]he scheme of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964 [42 U.S.C. § 2000d et seq.] is essentially administrative.\" The statute intends that the federal agency\ninvolved in the allocation of funds \"attempt at the outset to secure compliance by voluntary means, if such\nmethod is reasonably possible.\" Adams v. Richardson, 351 F.Supp. 636, 641 (D.D.C.1972),aff'd,156\nU.S.App.D.C. 267, 480 F.2d 1159 (1973).\nThe Department of Health, Education and Welfare controls the distribution of federal funds to YSC. In\naccordance with 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1, HEW has promulgated an extensive regulatory scheme to ensure\ncompliance with Title VI for any federal financing for which it is responsible. 45 C.F.R. § 80. In particular, 45\nC.F.R. §§ 80.7-80.10 establish procedures for filing a complaint by any person or class who believes that they\nhave been discriminated against, for investigating such complaint and for ensuring compliance with § 2000d.\nIn light of this administrative procedure, we conclude that plaintiffs have a duty to exhaust their administrative\nremedies or plead sufficient facts to support the contention that such exhaustion would be ineffective or futile.\nPlaintiffs apparently have not contacted the federal agency involved and have not sufficiently alleged facts to\njustify an exception to the exhaustion requirement. Therefore, plaintiffs' § 2000d claim will be dismissed without\nprejudice.\nXII. RIGHT OF PRIVACY:\nDefendants maintain that residents of YSC have no right of privacy. In particular, defendants argue that plaintiffs\nhave no fourth amendment rights once confined at YSC. Without specifying the limits of plaintiffs' fourth\namendment protection, we must disagree with defendants' assertion.\nIn Bonner v. Coughlin, 517 F.2d 1311, 1315, 1317 (7th Cir. 1975), now Justice Stevens, speaking for the Seventh\nCircuit, held that prisoners do retain some measure of fourth amendment protection. Juveniles, some of whom\nhave not even been adjudicated delinquent, a fortiori retain certain fourth amendment protections. Defendants\nhave not presented any justification for terminating all fourth amendment protections for YSC residents and\ntherefore we reject the proposition that these juveniles must lose all expectations of privacy once confined.\n\nXIII. PENDENT STATE LAW CLAIMS:\nDefendants argue that this court should not exercise pendent jurisdiction over the state law claims of plaintiffs.\nGiven our decision to retain the federal constitutional claims, we find that the federal and state law claims arise\n\"from [a common] nucleus of operative fact\" so that they may be tried conveniently and economically in one\nforum. See United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966). Therefore we will\nretain jurisdiction over the state law claims.\n[1] In Santiago I we approved the following class and two subclasses: \nAll juvenile citizens who are or will become subject to incarceration at YSC; and\n(a) All non-white juvenile citizens who are or will become subject to incarceration at YSC; and\n(b) All non-adjudicated delinquent juvenile citizens who are or will become subject to incarceration at YSC.\nAs to plaintiffs' class action claim for damages, we deferred a ruling on the appropriateness of certification.\nIndividual damage claims by the named plaintiffs still remain in the case.\n[2] The motion to dismiss has been submitted on behalf of all defendants except the Philadelphia School District\nand officials of the Philadelphia School District and Pennsylvania State Department of Education and therefore\nthese defendants are not considered in any of the analysis of the grounds for dismissal. The term \"defendants\" is\nused to refer to those represented in the motion to dismiss.\n[3] In Santiago I we rejected defendants' claim that this action is moot because the named plaintiffs no longer\nreside at YSC.\n[4] We also conclude that even if respondeat superior were held inapplicable in a § 1983 claim, such a holding\nwould not dictate a similar conclusion in an action pursuant to the fourteenth amendment. See Note, Damage\nRemedies Against Municipalities for Constitutional Violations, 89 Harv.L.Rev. 922 (1976). Section 1983 is a\nstatutory right and its interpretation does not control the boundaries of a judicially created constitutional remedy.\n[5]See, e. g., Inmates of Suffolk County Jail v. Eisenstadt, 494 F.2d 1196, 1199 (1st Cir.),cert. denied,419 U.S.\n977, 95 S.Ct. 239, 42 L.Ed.2d 189 (1974); Dewell v. Lawson, 489 F.2d 877, 881 (10th Cir. 1974); Smith v. Ross,\n482 F.2d 33, 36-37 (6th Cir. 1973); Jennings v. Davis, supra at 1275; Wright v. McMann, supra at 134-35; Carter\nv. Carlson, supra at 365.\n[6] Section 443 provides in pertinent part: \n\"The duties of the board of managers shall be to provide a house . . . for the reception of children . . . to keep the\n[house] in repair, and generally to fit and furnish said house so that the same may be suitable for the care of the\nchildren intended to be received, . . . and generally to supervise and oversee the management of said house.\"\n[7] We note that both damages and injunctive relief can be sought under § 1985. Action v. Gannon, 450 F.2d\n1227, 1237-38 (8th Cir. 1971) (en banc); Pennsylvania v. Local 542, Int'l Union of Operating Engineers, 347\nF.Supp. 268, 290-91, 301-02 (E.D.Pa.1972). Because all defendants act under color of state law, we do not have\nto be concerned with the problem of finding constitutional authority for applying § 1985 in this situation; the\nfourteenth amendment clearly supports the statute. We also note that the immunity defense and personal\ninvolvement of defendants discussed supra\napply as well to a § 1985 action, and therefore, defendants Rizzo and Levinson must be dismissed without\nprejudice from the damage claim by the named plaintiffs.\n[8] Section 2000d-2 provides: \n\"Any department or agency action taken pursuant to section 2000d-1 of this title shall be subject to such judicial\nreview as may otherwise be provided by law for similar action taken by such department or agency on other\n\ngrounds. In the case of action, not otherwise subject to judicial review, terminating or refusing to grant or to\ncontinue financial assistance upon a finding of failure to comply with any requirement imposed pursuant to\nsection 2000d-1 of this title, any person aggrieved . . . may obtain judicial review of such action in accordance\nwith [Administrative Procedure Act] and such action shall not be deemed committed to unreviewable agency\ndiscretion within the meaning of that section.\"\n[9] Section 2000d-1 provides in part: \n\"Each Federal department and agency which is empowered to extend Federal financial assistance to any\nprogram or activity, . . . is authorized and directed to effectuate the provisions of section 2000d of this title with\nrespect to such program or activity by issuing rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability which shall be\nconsistent with achievement of the objectives of the statute authorizing the financial assistance in connection with\nwhich the action is taken. . . .\"\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

This amended complaint is filed on behalf of past,\npresent and future residents of the Philadelphia Youth Study\nCenter.;  Its purpose is to eliminate a pattern and practice of\nracial segregation and disregard for the legal rights and preroga-\ntives of Youth Study Center residents, many of whom have committed\nno delinquent acts and all of whom are entitled by lav; to a\nprogram which guarantees to them the respect and fair treatment\nnecessary for their emergence as independent, responsible adults.\nThis class action is intended to secure for these children non-\ndiscriminatory treatment and the due process protections accorded\nadults as a matter of course as well as the solicitous care and\nr\nregenerative treatment to which they are entitled as children.\nThe acts and omissions set forth reflect an ingrained and virtual-\nly ineradicable pattern and practice at the institution.  For thi\nreason plaintiffs seek appropriate interim relief followed ulti-\nmately by a closing of the institution in its present form.\nII\nJURISDICTION\n2.  This is an action for injunctive and declaratory relief\nto redress deprivation of federally secured rights by individuals\nacting pursuant to and under color of the laws of the Cormonv.-e-nlt\nof l'cnnsylvania and the City of Philadelphia.  The jurisdiction of\nthis Court exists pursuant to 28 U.S.C. SS1331, 1343(3), 1343(4)\n2201, and 2202.

The above named plaintiffs bring this action pursuant\nto Rule 23(a) and (b) (2) on behalf of all past, present and future\nresidents of the Youth Study Center.  All plaintiffs, except\nplaintiffs P.O. and M.O., are representative members of both the\nabove mentioned class and a sub-class of non-white past, present\nand future residents of the institution.  Plaintiffs Santiago,\nSheared, P.O. and M.O. are also representative members of a sub-\nclass of non-delinquent residents whose status is that of runaway\n-8-\n\nor other neglected and dependent child.  In the absence of the\nrelief requested, each member of the class or sub-classes has, is\nor will be made subject to the practices and conditions which are\nalleged in this complaint.\n30.  The members of the class and sub-class are so numerous\nthat joinder of all members would be impractical.\n31.  There are questions of fact and law common to all\nmembers of the class and sub-classes, namely the practices and\npolicies of defendants that have constituted the' wholesale\ndeprivation of constitutional and legal rights of children at\nthe Center.\n32.  The defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds\ngenerally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief for the protection of all\"\nmembers of the class and sub-classes.\nV\nFACTS GIVING RISE TO CLAIMS\nA.  Isolation and Use of Corporal Punishment\n33.  The factual allegations of Paragraphs 4-23 are re-\nalleged and incorporated by reference herein.\n34.  Plaintiff Neida Santiago was committed to the Youth\nStudy Center on Wednesday, October 2, 1974.  The reason for her\ncommitment was that she had run away from home.\n35.  Following breakfast on the morning of October 3, 1974,\nplaintiff Santiago was taken by a staff member for an internal\npelvic examination by institution health personnel.\n36.  Plaintiff Santiago did not want to undergo a pelvic\n-9-\n\nexamination, and v;hen she refused to be examined she was locked\nin a room.\n37.  The room in which she was placed had no toilet.\n38.  Approximately one half hour after being placed in the\nroom, plaintiff knocked on the door window so as to inform a\nstaff member that she wanted to urinate.  Her knock wau ignored\nby defendant Maple, who looked at her but then turned away.\n39.  Plaintiff started to bang on the door, and defendant\nPowell came to the door and asked her what was wrong.  She told\ndefendant Powell through the door, that she wanted to go to the\nbathroom.  Defendant Powell ignored her.\n40.  Plaintiff then started once again to bang on the door,\nand defendant Powell returned and an argument ensued.\n41.  Without provocation, defendant Powell began repeatedly\nto strike plaintiff with a large keychain approxitnately one foot\nlong containing approximately 10 keys.  In addition to being\nstruck with the keychain, plaintiff was also punched and had her\nhair pulled.  In addition, during the course of. the beating,\nplaintiff was repeatedly referred to by defendant Powell as a\n\"bitch,\" \"little rat,\" and \"motherfucker.\"  Finally, plaintiff\nwas threatened by defendant Powell that if plaintiff remained\nin the institution after her court hearing later that day,\ndefendant Powell would \"get the girls to beat you up.\"\n42.  Plaintiff Denise Sheared was committed to the Youth\nStudy Center on August 30, 1974, to be held pending her transfer\nto the Youth Development Center at Waynesburg, Pa.  She was\ntransferred to V7aynesburg, Pa. on or about October 6, 1974,\n;iavii;g been held at the Youth Study Center, under conditions\nescribed below, because no transportation could be arranged for\nler.\n-10-\n\n43.  During the course of her stay at the Youth Study Center,\nplaintiff Sheared was locked in her room for periods whose total\nlength exceeded ten days.  This forced isolated confinement took\nplace during extremely hot weather, and plaintiff Sheared's room\nhad no ventilation 'whatsoever.  Temperatures in the room exceeded\n100 degrees.\n441  On October 2, 1974, plaintiff Sharon Oliver was first\nbrought to the Center and locked in a very cold room with no\nblanket and no water.  Even after a medical exam the next day she\nwas put into a locked room with no explanation given and no oppor-\ntunity offered to question or contest confinement.\n45. * At the end of August, 1974, following a v;eek and a half\nof hospitalization at Philadelphia General Hospital (see infra,\nParagraph 43), Darlene Lattimore was forced to sleep on the floor\nof a locked room..\n46.  In addition to her own solitary confinement, plaintiff\nSheared witnessed numerous beatings and corporal punishment inci-\ndents involving other residents and staff members, and lived in  i\nfear of suffering similar treatment.  '\n47.  On October 4, 1974, plaintiff Nicholson was the victim  I\nof one such beating, having been struck across the back and thighs '.\nby defendant Emma Clark for a minor infraction of institutional\nrules.\n48.  Darlene Lattimore, in August 1974, was repeatedly\npunched and bloodied by Center staff including defendants Baylor,\nPowell and McClendon, and was hit: with an object resembling a\nblackjack causing her to lose consciousness.  She was spitting\n-11-\n\nlip blood on the floor of her unit with a counselor physically\nstanding on top of her at which time she was revived v;ith smel-\nling salts, to be transferred to Philadelphia General Hospital.\nShe required a week and a half of hospitalization.\n49.  In addition, Center staff occasionally delegate to chil-\ndren the job of inflicting corporal punishment; on other children.\nThus Lloyd.Stokes, after being struck with a paddle by defendant\nLawhon in late August, 1974, was struck with a sneaker by fellow\nchildren on his unit.\n50.  Physical and degrading punishment at the Center by Cen-\nter staff continues to this day, notwithstanding\n(a)  This Court.'s order of October 4, 1974 prohibiting\nsuch practices; and,\n(b)  A September 12, 1974, written order from Comraori-\nI\nwealth Welfare Secretary Helene Wohlgerauth directed to defendant\nBoard Chairman Quinn, his Board colleagues, and Center staff to\n\"immediately cease\" the use of \"corporal, degrading and vindictive\npunishment of children.\"  A copy of this order is attached hereto\nas Appendix A.\n51.  For example, on Thursday, October 24, 1974, plaintiff\nRivera was brutally assaulted by defendant Vicks causing bruises\nto his face, which required hospital attention.  In addition,\nduring the week following this Court's order; defendant Montone\npersonally slapped plaintiff Martin in the face.  Other violations\nof the order have been undertaken by other named defendants and\nwill be raore fully set forth in a Civil Contempt Petition to be\nfiled with the Court.\n52.  Members of Center staff h.-vc nctivc)y oncour.-.^c-d\nchildren to fight other children.  For example, in late May, 1974,\n-12-\n\ndefendant Mitchell encouraged aa unknown youth to fight plaintiff\nBeales.  The same youth not only assaulted Beales -- in full view\nof the laughing defendant Mitchell -- but also raped Beales later\nthat evening.\nB.  General Institutional Conditions\n53.  The foregoing factual allegations are re-allcged and in-\ncorporated by reference.\n54.  All residents of the Youth Study Center live subject to\nthe following physical conditions:\n(a)  Room furnishings.  Children live in exceedingly\nsmall, cramped rooms without closets, desks, bureaus, chairs, or\nindividual nightstands.  Room lighting is inadequate for reading.\nIn many cases beds are not provided and children sleep on the\nfloor.  Pillows and pillowcases are not provided.\n(b)  Physical plant.  The walls and ceiling contain nu-\nmerous water holes and rat holes, and the premises, including the\nkitchen and dining areas, are infested with vermin and roaches.\nRain leaks are common, with water often seeping from the fifth\nfloor rooftop down to the second floor.  Plumbing malfunctions ami!\nj\nelectrical wiring is exposed.  The physical premises are in non-\ncompliance with every applicable city, state, and federal life\nsafety, building, health, sanitation and fire prevention code,\nand institution personnel have repeatedly been advised of this by-\nappropriate city and state agencies.  j\n(c)  Ventilation.  The premises are inadequately heated\nin winter and unyentilated in summer, with summertime temperatures\noften reaching 110 degrees Fahrenheit.  The automatic temperature\n-13-\n\ncontrol system for the heating system is inoperative.  The insti-\ntution is infested with mosquitoes in the surnuier.\nC.  Institutional Restraints and Suppression of Liberties\n55.  All residents of the Youth Study Center live subject to\nthe following program limitations:\n(a)  Movement.  The institution is run like a raediurn-\nraaxiinum security prison, with various housing units segregated  •.\nfrom one another by locked doors and corridors.  This is the case\nnotwithstanding that the overwhelming majority of institution\nresidents have been convicted of-.ru> delinquent acts, and many\nhave not been alleged to have even participated in such acts. .\n(b)  Recreation.  Residents are permitted virtually no\noutdoor recreation, and indoor physical recreation averaging less\nthan several hours per seven day period.  There is little\norganized physical activity whatsoever and some residents are\ngiven no opportunity to exercise at all.  There is no provision\nin the budget for provision of recreation equipment and supplies.\nRecreation often consists solely of watching TV and playing cards\non living units where that is permitted or possible.\n(c)  Visitation-.  No visitors other than parents or sur-\nrogate parents are permitted.  Visits from friends under age 21 or\nnon-parents are routinely not allowed.  j\n(d)  Mail and telephone corrciunication.  Nail is routine- |\nly opened and read by institution personnel regardless of it  |\ncharacter or content.  Youths have informed close friends not to  j\nwrite because of the censorship.  Other youths have found that .\nwail sent out via Center stnff never rradie;' intended ;!c:dr:<::: ••. ••-:; .\nThe restrictions and barriers to telephone use are so severe as\nto virtually prohibit it.\n-lit-\n\n(c)  Clothing, and hy;;lcncc.  The: following condition:;\nexist as to clothing:\n(1)  Changes of clothing and bedding are irregular\nat best;\n(2)  Bedding and mattresses are constantly filthy\nand are not changed or replaced in an adequate manner;\n(3)  Children continue to sleep on mats on the\nfloor despite a recent directive by the CoTunonwealth Secretary of\nWelfare prohibiting this:\n(4)  Female residents are not permitted to wear\nsweaters and long pants notwithstanding cold winter temperatures,\ni\nand many residents are permitted clothing changes only prior to\ncourt appearances;\n(5)  Children are not provided with a clean wash\ncloth and towel twice a week as required by state law;\n(6)  Bedroom areas in the center section of the\nbuilding do not provide the mininuni required sanitary facilities\nof one washboard toilet and one bathtub or shower for each four\nchildren.\n(f)  Medical and dental.\n(1)  The involuntary and medically improper\nadministration of dangerous drugs, including Thorazine, is\nroutinely used to control the behavior of children.  For example,\nplaintiffs Martin, llayman and Lattiaore were forced to ingest\nThorazine, with the drug being physically forced dov.Ti the throat\nof plaintiff llayman.  Plaintiff Lattin'.ore was on one occasion  !\nlocked in her room for her refusal to ingest the drug.  The use ol!\nThoranine at the Center is nor. accoL.paaicJ by the proper ;::ocic:al  .\nprecautions, is often not properly prescribed, and is often used\n-15-\n\nfor no medically desirable purpose;\n(2)  Youths with medical.problems or injuries re-\nsulting from beatings and physical blows do not obtain proper ac-\ncess to medical services, or to the proper services of a doctor;\n(3)  Medical equipment is antiquated, examining\nrooms are unclean, and sterile techniques are not practiced;\n(4)  Youths are not afforded privacy during their\nexaminations;\n(5)  Dental services of one half day per week for\nthe entire Center, inadequate dental facilities and a total\nabsence of preventive dental care demonstrate the failure to\nprovide adequate dental services, particularly to a class of\nchildren with great needs for proper dental care;\n(6)  In addition, medical personnel are not present\nor accessible at-the institution in such numbers and for suffi-\ncient 'time to provide adequate health care for the children;\n(7)  Pelvic examinations, routinely given to female\nresidents, are of questionable necessity.  These examinations have\noften included a digital examination of the vagina where the hymen\nis absent to ascertain past sexual experience, a technique which\nis of itself of questionable efficacy.  Eelvic examinations on\nyoung and middle adolescents can be psychologically traumatic, yet\nsuch examinations are coerced if permission is not granted.  (See\nParagraph 36, supra.) Mo parental consent is sought for these or\nany other examinations, and girls are locked in rooms until they\nconsent to these examinations.\nchildren at t:ho ' inr.ti'rnti on receive\nthree daily meals and an evening snack.  The caloric and nutri-\nI\ntional content of the meals is inadequate for growing children,\n-16-  '\n\nboth in terms of quality of the food and quantity of the amounts\nserved.  Food is often so poorly prepared, spoiled or stale as. to\nbe inedible.  The kitchen and cafeteria are infested with rodents\nand roaches.\nD.  Institutional Denial of Right to Treatment\n56.  In addition to the program limitations set forth above,\nthe actual treatment of the children constitutes a total denial\nof their right to adequate humane and rehabilitative treatment and\nis characterized by the following:\n(a)  Discipline.  There exists at the institution no\nwritten code of conduct or guidelines to advise children how they\nare expected to behave and what sanctions, if any, they can expect\nin the event they misbehave.  Institutional staff make up rules\nand issue orders on an arbitrary and capricious basis.\n(b)  Corporal punishment and isolation.'  The social, sys-\ntem at the Center is characterized by the following:\n(1)  Boys and girls at the institution are social-\nized by the staff into a disciplinary system in which corporal\npunishment and solitary confinement are the primary treatment\nnethods.  Children are routinely struck by staff with keychains,\narushes, sneakers, and painted wooden'paddles.  The paddles are\nreferred to colloquially by staff as \"red hots,\" \"AO pound\nsnapper,\" etc., and institutional staff routinely run \"soul\ntrains\" in which male residents are required to stand in line or\nnove in a line and submit to beatings with shoes or paddles.\nDifferent staff members have preferred varying methods and\nweapons, and staff have used other children as their agents to\nacte out corporal punishment to others.\n(2)  Forced solitary confinement for period?;\n-17-\n\nranging from.one to four days is routinely used, particularly for\nfemale residents.  Confinement is often in rooms with no beds or\ntoilets and children arc thus forced to urinate and defecate\nwithout proper plumbing facilities.  Children arc denied access to\nmedical services, personal clothing, bedding, toilet and personal\narticles.  Girls often set fires in their rooms as a protest\nagainst the outrageous conditions of their forced confinement.  In\naddition, this confinement is often imposed not only for minor\nbreaches of decorum but also for refusal to submit to medical or\nother \"treatment,\" such as ingesting tranquilizers or submitting\nto pelvic examinations.\n(3)  No hearings or other internal administrative\nprocedures are used prior to imposition of confinement, which,\nduring the summer months, involves being locked in unventilated\nrooms with temperatures in excess of 100 degrees Fahrenheit. -\n«  (c)  Involuntary servitude.  Females residents have been\nforced to work in the laundry, and are told that if they refuse to\nwork they will not be issued clean clothing.  On at least one oc-\ncasion, female residents were involuntarily required to work as  i\nmaids at the Riverview Home for the Aged maintained by the City of I\nPhiladelphia.  Occasionally female residents who refuse to do as- \\\nsigned work or clean up tasks are locked in their rooms in the\nnanner described earlier.  No child is ever paid for work\nperformed.\n(d)  Denial of adequate and equal education.  Defendants,\nparticularly the School District of Philadelphia and the Pennsyl-\nvania Department of Education, have a duty under SS13V1 and 1372(4)1\n>f the Pennsylvania Public School C;;Je, ?.•'•. i\\ S. •S313-1371,\n13-1372(4), to provide children at the Center with an adequate and\n2qual public school education, statutorily defined as \"proper\neducation and training.\"  This right to education is being denied\n-16-\n\nin Chat:\n(1)  Pennsylvania Department of Education and\nSchool District defendants give such a low priority to instruc-\ntion at the Center as to virtually ignore the quality and adequacy\nof instruction there;\n(2)  Instructional time is greatly diminished, of-\nten amounting to less than half a day;\n(3)  The quality of teachers and instruction is\ngrossly inferior to that offered other public school children;\n(4)  The subjects are limited and are not up to the\nintellectual abilities and potential of children, e.g. ,- 9th grade\ntudents have been given 4th and 5th grade reading books and were\ndenied algebra and fractions;\n(5)  Reading instruction, history, geography and\nscience are absent;\n,  (6)  Tests and homev.'ork are not given;\n(7)  Corporal punishment has been employed  through\nthe striking of students with a stick;.  —\n(S)  Instructional supervision is totally lacking;\nand\n(9)  There is no adequate library for students.\n(e)  Availability of social services and counseling;.  So-\ncial services and counseling is grossly inadequate in that:\n(1)  .No social service or counseling services are\nafforded to female residents.  Upon information and belief, at the\ntime of the filing of this amended complaint only one institution\nsocial worker is available to the boys.  (During the period July\n1973-June 1974 the average monthly population of the institution\n-19-\n\nwas approximately 119 boyy and 47 girls.  Upon information and be-\nlief the population as of the date of filing the original coraplairi\nin this matter (October 3, 197A) v??.s approximately the same.)\n(2)  In addition to the lack of social service per-\nsonnel for these children, there are no full-time, and inadequate\npart-time, psychiatric and psychological counseling services\noffered.  A psychologist and psychiatrist assigned to the Canter\nai-e not involved in treatment and staff training, in violation of\nstate welfare law.  Mo psychiatric care is provided even when\nrecommended by professionals and although some children are\ndetained for extensive periods of time.  Many of the children are\nin need of intensive and deliberate counseling and guidance, none\nof which is afforded them.  Aberrant behavior which reflects\ndisturbed personality growth is often treated as a routine dis-\nciplinary matter for which corporal punishment and the involuntary\nadministration of drugs are accepted, indeed preferred, modes of\ntreatment.\n(f)  Child care staff-child ratio.  The ratio of staff\nto girls of 1:12 and to boys of 1:25 during working hours is in\n!\nnoncompliance with state requirements of 1:6 during working hours !\ni\nand 1:12 during sleeping hours.\n(g)  Staff attitudes and lack of training.  The general\natmosphere of the institution resembles that of a maximum security\nprison rather than that of a detention and treatment facility for\nwayward and disturbed youth.  Non-delinquent children (e.g.,  |\n!\nrunaways, neglected and dependent youth) are routinely mixed and  !\ni\nhoused with alleged delinquent or adjudicated delinquent children,|\nin violation of r,t.U.<: lav;.  i'iio ; i;; j or: :.y <>;' stv. ff arc iv.'s t; •.'.\".\ni\nvindictive, and punitive towards the children, attitudes which are\ningrained and have existed for a long period of tin1.a.  As a result.\n-20-\n\nchildren live in fear of retaliation, for such innocent acts as\ncomplaining about the conditions set forth in this amended\ncomplaint.  .\nStaff have actively encouraged children to assault other\nchildren.. They have also been grossly and recklessly negligent\nin supervision.  For example, plaintiff Beales was raped in May,\n1974, arid on October 22, 1974 was assaulted in the eye, losing\n80-90% of his sight when two supervisors, defendants Oliver and\nSlate, recklessly absented themselves from their duties.  Staff\ntraining is totally lacking -- despite Commonwealth Secretary of\nWelfare Wohlgemuth's written directive of September 12, 1974 to\ndefendant Quinn, the Board and staff to establish \"imniediately\" a\nstaff development program which would \"provide staff with basic\nchild care skills including on-the-job training and supervision in\n[alternatives tc the staff's-present methods of punishment.\"\nE. Official Acquiescence In and Toleration of the Above\ni Conditions\n57.  Each and every one of the defendants in this case lias\nbeen repeatedly informed by appropriate city and state officials\nthat violations of local, state, and federal child welfare,\nbuilding, housing, health, sanitation, and fire safety laws and\nregulations continue to exist at the institution.  Additionally,\nall defendants have been apprised of constitutional and common law\nviolations at the Center.\n58.  No action has been taken to remedy these conditions, in-\ncluding compliance with a Temporary Restraining Order of this\nCourt dated October 4, 1974.\n59.  Each an:! every oi:c of the defendants in thi.; cas,: h; s\n;\nbeen aware, or with due diligence should have been aware, that the\n-21-\n\ncomplained-of living and progra:aaal:ic conditions continue to cxi.si\nat the institution.\nCO.  No action has been taken to remedy these conditions.\nF.  Availability of Less Restrictive Alternatives\n61.  Involuntary incarceration at the Youth Study Center is\nnot the least restrictive method available to the defendants for\nsecuririg the appearance at court or otherwise of juveniles who\nhave ndt been adjudicated delinquent and are awaiting trial or\nother court or administrative disposition.  Upon information and\nbelief, there presently exists in the city sufficient state and\ncity-related treatment and foster care facilities which can b^\nused to significantly reduce the need for forced confinement at\nthe Youth Study Center.\n. 62.  The failure to utilize least restrictive alternative\ntreatment facilities results in the following:\n(a)  Mixing of delinquent with non-delinquent children;\n(b)  Subjecting children to a prison-like regime in the\nabsence of any necessity for so doing;  '  \\\n(c)  Increasing the financial and administrative demandi\nnecessary to remedy the abuses to which institution residents, re-\ngardless of tha reason for their custody, are subject.  i\n63.  The failure of defendants to utilize the least restric- j\ntive alternative consistent with the purpose of the custody result:\nin a grossly disproportionate number of non-white children being  !\nimprisoned at the. Youth Study Center, and has the effect o£\nperpetuating the racially segregated character of the institution.\nG.  Racial Segregation\n64.  The Youth Study Ot>n':er is ;:i>. rJ.r.os!: ;:otally r. c: L.:•.!!y\n-22-\n\nsegregated institution due to the discriminatory routing and chan-\nneling of almost exclusively black children to the Center at\nvarious stages of intake and admission procedures.  See Thornberryj\n\"Race, Socioeconomic Status and Sentencing in the Juvenile Justice\nSystem,\" 64 J. of Crim. Law and Crim. 90 (1973).\n65. . The Center has been racially segregated during its\nentire history and no remedial steps have been taken by any of the\ndefendants or their agents to cease this discrimination.  Because.\nthe Center is not the least restrictive alternative insofar as\ncustody is concerned, large numbers of the non-white children who\nare currently sent there need not be.  White children, on the\nother hand, are normally and as a matter of course afforded less\nrestrictive disposition v;hile awaiting court or other action.\n66.  The only feasible means of ceasing the discriminatory\neffect of this racially segregated facility and the racially\ndiscriminatory routing of minority children there is the effective!\nuse of these least restrictive alternatives and the consequent  |\ni\nphasing out of the facility in its present form.  j\ni\nvi  •  ;\nCAUSES OF ACTION\n67.

      "text": "f/7 ^_  ^\nW\nPREAMBLE\nThe following factual background is agreed to by the\nparties and is incorporated as preamble to the stipulation\nof settlement.\nIn February, 1975, the C-JiirL of Common Pleas of\nPhiladelphia appointed a new Board of Managers to the\nYouth Study Center.  Thereafter, in September of 1975,\nMalcolm Amos was appointed by the Board of Managers as\nExecutive Director and he has occupied that position\nto the present day.\nA reorganization of the Youth Study Center commenced\nin 1975 and various educational, recreational and other\nprograms were introduced.  Shortly thereafter, through the\njoint efforts of the Family Court and the Youth Study\nCenter, the Detention Alternative Program came into being.\nThis Program releases to other facilities status offenders\nand first offenders not involved in violent crime.  Social\nworkers were engaged (subject to budget limitations) and\nrequests were made of city authorities for capital funds\nwith which the Center could improve the building and the\nconditionr, under which the residents lived.\nCertain changes in personnel were made, subject to\nCivil Service Commission restrictions as to improper\ndismissal.\nCenter programs planned and implemented since 1975\nhave bettered conditions for residents, and have covered\nthe items now contained in the present stipulation.  In\nmost instances the programs and operations of the Youth\nStudy Center set forth in this stipulation reflect current\npractice and in all instances are intended to be maintained\nin the future.\nAlthough the parties intend that this stipulation be\nenforceable in this court, the parties agree it gives rise\n-1-\nSantiago v. Philadelphia\n•••  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 11\n\nto enforceable rights only in the ev:nt of a material\nbreach in its observance.  Upon execution of the stipulation,\nthe original complaint will be withdrawn and its allegations\nwill not be the subject of future proceedings, legal or\nequitable.\n-2-\n\nI  Alternative Detention Placement:  The parties recognize\nthat one of the primary goals of juvenile detention is \"to\nprovide custody which minimizes the damaging effects of confine-\nment, and physical care which fosters growth.\"  Regulation 6403,\nC & Y Manual, The Office of Family Services, Pennsylvania\nDepartment of Public Welfare, October, 1968.  Because at\npresent the Youth Study Center (hereinafter \"YSC\") provides only\nthe most severe form of custody, secure custody, the YSC\nshall continue to implement the plan for less restrictive\ndetention placements.  (The YSC has already taken steps to\nincrease beds in off-site locations by obtaining a LEAA grant\nof $212,195 to expand community placements from 40 to 52.)\nThis Plan shall consider models similar in kind to those\nutilized in the Detention Alternative Program (hereinafter\n\"DAP\"), including but not limited to, small community-based\ngroup homes, foster placements, and mentor homes.  Intake\nat the YSC shall be in conformity with the standards set\nforth in Paragraph XXI, infra.\nII  Discipline of Children at the YSC:\nA.  Corporal Punishment:\n(1)  Subsequent to any use of physical force by a\nstaff member, a \"Use of Force\" report (66-141) shall be filed\nimmediately by the staff member with his supervisor, describing\nspecifically the reason for the use of force, the amount and\ntype of force used, the resident involved, and the names of all\nresident and staff witnesses.  The supervisor shall investigate\nthe incident and report his findings to the Executive Director\nof the YSC within 24 hours of the incident.  In all cases where\nthere is evidence uncovered that force was used or a \"Use of\nForce\" report was filed, the Executive Director shall interview\nthe staff member, resident involved, and any witnesses, a) to\ndetermine whether or not force was necessary, b) to counsel all\nparties about the confrontation and c) to decide if further\n-3-\n\naction should be taken, including, win^e appropriate, suspension\nand/or dismissal of staff in violation of this policy.\n(2)  Whenever a \"Use of Force\" report is filed, the\nExecutive Director or his deputy  (the Program Coordinator or\nAdministrator-on-Duty) shall also notify the resident's parent\nor guardian by letter, documenting the incident and the results\nof the investigation.  A copy of this letter shall also be sent\nby the resident's social worker to the resident's attorney of\nrecord, and another copy shall be included in the resident's\nFamily Court juvenile file.\n(3)  Whenever any YSC resident believes that he has\nbeen the victim of unwarranted use of force by a staff member,\nthe resident may, if desired, file a report with his social\nworker setting out the allegations.  The YSC shall provide\nforms for this purpose.  This report shall be forwarded\nimmediately to the Executive Director or his deputy and\ninvestigated and processed in the manner provided for \"Use\nof Force\" reports, including notification of parent, attorney\nof record, and Family Court, as outlined above.\n*\nB.  Crisis Intervention/Disciplinary  Isolation Procedures:\n(1)  \"Isolation\" is placing a resident in a room by\nhimself for a period of time.  The room may be the resident's\nown room or a room used specifically  for isolation;  it may be\nlocked or unlocked.  The use of isolation as a method of control\nis a constantly debated subject.  Because it is controversial,\nproper safeguards must be implemented.\n(2)  Isolation may only be used in the following\nsituations:\n(a)  When a resident is so out of control that\nThe following procedures are subject to modification in\norder to conform with DPW regulations on the subject of isolation.\n-4-\n\nhir; Lfhavioi. jicscnl.s  i .ii.. . -<l >. .i to u,ir.> >-r uf jhysic.il 'iara\\ to\nhimself or to those around him.  (\"Crisis Intervention\")\n(b)  To discipline a resident for the  following\nwilful infractions of the facility rules:\n(i)  Use of controlled substances within the\nfacility;\n(ii)  Repeated harassment or threats to othc;r\nresidents after other disciplinary measures have failed to control\nthe behavior;\n(iii)  Causing major damage to facility property;\n(iv)  Escaping from the facility;\n(v)  Inflicting physical harm upon another\nresident or staff;\n(vi)  Taking money or possessions of other\nresidents;\n(vii)  Repeated refusal to adhere to Center\nregulations, where this results in substantial interference with\ndiscipline on the unit;\n(c)  Court-ordered  isolation.\n(3)  Isolation is not mandatory in any situation, and\nother  measures should be used wherever possible.\nStaff and counselors shall bear in mind constantly  that\nany of the behavior for which isolation can be imposed may be caused\nby severe psychological conditions requiring psychiatric counseling.\nBe alert for this and seek such counseling whenever it seems\nadvisable, especially where a resident is unfamiliar to the staff.\nAs an added precaution the resident's social worker shall speak\nto each resident within an hour of the commencement of isolation and\nevaluate his condition.  (If the social worker is not on duty, then\nanother social worker or the Social Work Supervisor should see the\nresident.  At night, and on weekends, the Program Coordinator shall\nfulfill this function.)  The social worker or Counsel.or Supervisor\nmay advise that the resident be seen immediately by a psychiatrist,\nor that the child be released as soon as he has calmed down, and\nnot be subject to any disciplinary isolation, if that initially had\n-5-\n\nbeen  ! ;ji\"jsod.  The  ctiinivui  <<r  Pup  i--'  ,ir  shall  reuui.v.t  that  1  he\nsocial worker re-evaluate the situation whenever necessary.  At\nthe end of the isolation period, the social worker shall prepare\na report and submit it to the Executive Director.\n(4)  Whenever a child is isolated  because of uncontrollable\nbehavior requiring crisis intervention pursuant to B(2)(a) above,\nthe child must be released as soon as he calms down, unless a\npsychiatrist advises otherwise.  This should be explained to\nthe child at the time of isolation.\n(5)  Whenever a child is isolated for discipline pursuant\nto B(2)(b) above, the maximum time for which a resident can be\nisolated is 24 hours, unless the procedures  in  (10) below are\nfollowed.\nIt is stressed that this is a maximum period.  A 24 hour\nperiod of isolation should rarely be necessary.\nWhen a child is isolated for disciplinary reasons, the maximum\nperiod should only be imposed in an extreme case.  Normally a\nfar lesser period shall suffice as a disciplinary measure.  The\ncounselor shall explain to the child that he will be released as soon\nas he calms down and/or his attitude improves significantly.  The\ncounselor, social worker or Counselor Supervisor shall recommend to\nthe Program Coordinator that a child be released as soon as his\nattitude has shown significant improvement.
