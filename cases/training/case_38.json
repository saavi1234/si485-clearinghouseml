    "summary": "<p>On April 23, 2003, nine plaintiffs, acting through private attorneys, filed a 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, challenging the strip search policy of the City and County of San Francisco (\"CCSF\"). Specifically, Plaintiffs alleged that, under CCSF policy, all prisoners who were placed in the general jail population at the CCSF's jails were subjected to strip and visual body cavity searches, with those refusing to consent being placed naked in \"cold rooms.\" Plaintiffs complained that this policy violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution as well as several provisions of California state law.</p>\r\n<p>Although Defendants generally denied the allegations, the policy at issue was discontinued by the Sheriff on January 21, 2004.</p>\r\n<p>On June 10, 2004, the District Court certified a plaintiff class consisting of all persons who were arrested \"on any charge not involving weapons, controlled substances, or a charge of violence, and not involving a violation of parole or a violation of probation (where consent to search is a condition of such probation), and who were subjected to a blanket visual body cavity strip search by defendants before arraignment at a San Francisco County jail facility without any individualized reasonable suspicion that they were concealing contraband.\"</p>\r\n<p>Discovery followed and the Court was called upon to resolve several discovery disputes. See Bull v. City and County of San Francisco, 2003 WL 23857823 (N.D.Cal. Oct 27, 2003); Bull v. City and County of San Francisco, 2005 WL 40072 (N.D.Cal. Jan 05, 2005).</p>\r\n<p>On June 24, 2005, Plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment with respect to the issue of whether the Sheriff's blanket policy of subjecting certain categories of plaintiff-arrestees to pre-arraignment strip searches, violated the Fourth Amendment. Defendants opposed Plaintiffs' motion and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing, in part, that the Sheriff was entitled to the defense of qualified immunity. The District Court issued a September 22, 2005 Memorandum and Order, which it subsequently amended on February 23, 2006, in order to grant in part and deny in part both parties' motions for summary judgment.</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, the Court found that Defendants' former blanket policy of conducting strip searches without regard to individualized suspicion was unconstitutional as applied to members of the plaintiff-class who were (a) classified for housing in the general jail population; (b) probation violators for whom consent to search was not a condition of probation; or (c) certain categories of safety-cell detainees. With regard to the Defendants' former policy of strip searching (a) arrestees with a criminal history relating to drugs, weapons or violence; (b) arrestees who were transferred to or from other jurisdictions; or (c) certain other types of safety-cell detainees, however, the Court granted summary judgment for Defendants, concluding that such searches were justified under the reasonable suspicion standard. The court also granted the Sheriff's motion for qualified immunity with regard to safety cell searches, criminal history searches, and consent searches but denied the motion with regard to classification searches. The Court also dismissed the claims of named plaintiffs Jonah Zern and Marcie Corneau, because it determined that the violent nature of their crimes provided reasonable suspicion for their strip searches. Bull v. City &amp; County of San Francisco, 2006 WL 449148 (N.D.Cal. Feb 23, 2006).</p>\r\n<p>The defendants filed an appeal, but lost in the 9th Circuit in an opinion by Circuit Judge Sydney Thomas. 539 F.3d 1193 (9th Cir. 2008). Judge Tallman dissented; Judge Ikuta concurred, noting his \"grave concern\" that the holding, though compelled by prior 9th Circuit case law, stood in tension with Supreme Court precedent and might endanger the safety of people in the jail system subject to harm by jail contraband.</p>\r\n<p>On a petition for rehearing, the Court vacated the panel's decision and set the case for reargument before 11 judges. 558 F.3d 887 (9th Cir. 2009). Argument occurred in March 2009.</p>\r\n<p>On February 9, 2010, the 9th Circuit issued its opinion en banc, holding that the San Francisco strip search policy was reasonable and did not violate the class members' Fourth Amendment rights. The case was held in abeyance, pending the United States Supreme Court's decision in <a href=\"../../../../case/11854/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Florence v. County of Burlington.</a></p>\r\n<p>On April 2, 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court in Florence held that a blanket policy of strip searching detainees does not violate the Fourth or Fourteenth Amendments, whether or not there is reasonable suspicion that the detainee is concealing contraband, and regardless of the severity of the charges under which he or she is being held. Florence v. Burlington County, 566 U.S. 318 (2012). In their April 19th Joint Case Management Statement, the parties debated the scope of this decision's impact on the present case.</p>\r\n<p>After a status conference, the case was referred to Magistrate Judge Joseph C. Spero for settlement on April 20, 2012. On June 14, 2012, the Court approved a stipulation to extend the plaintiff's deadline for filing a motion to redefine the class until September 15, 2012. After deciding that the Supreme Court's decision in Florence was not applicable to this case, the parties settled, and on June 28, 2013, the Court dismissed the case and approved the settlement agreement. The agreement required defendants to pay $450,000 to plaintiffs and to pay for the cost of notifying the class of the dismissal. Though one member of the class objected to the settlement, as of January 31, 2018, there has been no other activity after the dismissal. The case is now closed.</p>",

In February 2010, the 9th Circuit, in an en banc decision, upheld the strip search policy. The case was held in abeyance, pending the United States Supreme Court's decision in Florence v.

USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB\niii\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840     Document 214-1     Filed 08/12/2005     Page 5 of 22(cid:10)\n1 INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n2 Defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment argues that it was not clearly established\n3 in 2003 that it was unlawful to strip search minor offenders brought to the jail after their arrests and\n4 therefore the Sheriff is immune from liability for the blanket policies that required such strip\n5 searches. In ruling on the motion, the court faces an unusual situation. This is the rare case in which\n6 the law in question is not only clearly established, but has been held to be clearly established.  In\n7 1992, the Ninth Circuit observed, “At the time Appellees were searched, it was clearly established\n8 in this circuit that it was unlawful to search an arrestee brought to the jail on the charge of\n9 committing a minor offense unless the officer directing the search possesses ‘a reasonable suspicion\n10 that the individual arrestee is carrying or concealing contraband’.  (Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d\n11 614,617, (9th Cir. 1984) cert denied, 471 U.S. 1053…” ACT UP!/Portland v. Bagley 917 F.2d\n12 298,301 (9th Cir. 1992) [emphasis added].)\n13 According to defendants, Sheriff Hennessey is entitled to qualified immunity because he\n14 could not be reasonably expected to apply this holding.  Ninth Circuit precedent is inapplicable\n15 because the San Francisco jail is different from other jails: they claim there is more smuggling\n16 activity in San Francisco, and more contraband has been found in the cells where prisoners await\n17 disposition of their cases or serve their sentences after conviction.  Moreover, the defendants argue,\n18 the Ninth Circuit’s holding is of limited scope: it extends only to the booking area of the jail where\n19 such minor offense arrestees are initially held – once these arrestees are moved out of this area, at\n20 the jail’s sole discretion, into the housing area or into solitary “safety” cells, they no longer are\n21 protected from strip searches even though they could still bail out, even though they could be\n22 released on OR, or be released at or before arraignment1 because the charges are dismissed.\n23 Moreover, the defendants contend that they could lawfully strip search arrestees who were brought\n24 \\\\\\\n25\n26\n1\n  California Penal Code § 1270 provides the misdemeanants the right to OR release at arraignment “unless the\n27 court makes a finding on the record . . . that an own recognizance release will compromise public safety . . ..”  All the\nrepresentative plaintiffs in this case were released before or at arraignment and most were never charged at all – clearly\n28\nnot a group properly subject to a blanket strip search.\nPLTS’ OPPOSITION TO DEF SHERIFF HENNESSEY’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT RE: QUALIFIED IMMUNITY\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB\n1\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840     Document 214-1     Filed 08/12/2005     Page 6 of 22(cid:10)\n1 to the jail on offenses which might or might not involve “violent” conduct, even if the arrestees were\n2 not otherwise suspicious.\n3 In short, because of these limitations and distinctions, defendants take the position that the\n4 Sheriff was free to promulgate a policy that required the strip searching of all arrestees who were\n5 assigned to jail housing (“classified”) before arraignment. He was also free to promulgate a policy\n6 of strip searching all persons who were placed in “safety” or solitary cells.  The Sheriff further\n7 argues that the jail was free to strip search arrestees who are not otherwise suspicious on the basis\n8 of the charged offense alone -- even in those cases where “violence” was not an element of the\n9 offense, and the arrest could be effected without probable cause to believe a “violent” act had been\n10 committed.  \n11 The bulk of the evidence and the legal arguments which the Court will consider in deciding\n12 whether qualified immunity protects the Sheriff are already before the Court.  Plaintiffs’ motion for\n13 partial summary judgment details the strip-search policies which Plaintiffs assert violated class\n14 members’ constitutional and statutory rights, and both the plaintiffs and defendants develop their\n15 respective views of the law.2 In this cross motion, however, defendants counter attack with a\n16 dramatic rejection of all Ninth Circuit precedent, asserting, as noted above, it is distinguishable on\n17 the facts because the San Francisco is a big, busy jail full of drug addicts and (apparently) hardened\n18 criminals who are intent upon smuggling drugs and weapons into the jail any way they can, including\n19 the use of every imaginable body cavity.\n20 This attempt to distinguish and limit Ninth Circuit law requires the court to consider the\n21 salient fact which brought the Ninth Circuit to rule that it is unlawful to strip search arrestees brought\n22 to the jail for minor offenses:  namely, that in the prior cases, defendants were unable to show that\n23 minor offense arrestees posed a threat to jail security. As a class, there was no evidence they had a\n24\n25 2  The Sheriff’s qualified immunity motion does not address or defend the following categories of individuals\nsubject to a strip-search: (1) detainees convicted of a crime involving drugs, weapons or violence within the past five\n26 years or arrested on multiple occasions for such crimes during the same period; (2) detainees arrested for a probation\nviolation; (3) detainees arrested based on federal charge; (4) detainees in transit from one part of the state to another;\n27 (5) detainees arrested outside of San Francisco pursuant to a San Francisco warrant; (6) detainees who “consented” to\na strip search following initial booking; and (7) detainees who refused to consent to custodial searches and therefore were\n28\nimmediately classified for housing. \nPLTS’ OPPOSITION TO DEF SHERIFF HENNESSEY’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT RE: QUALIFIED IMMUNITY\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB\n2\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840     Document 214-1     Filed 08/12/2005     Page 7 of 22(cid:10)\n1 propensity to smuggle contraband into the jail after they were arrested.  If the defendants can show\n2 that this factual circumstance was different in San Francisco, if there is an appreciable risk, a\n3 reasonably suspected danger here, then they may be able successfully to distinguish the prior cases\n4 and Sheriff Hennessey might be able to escape liability.   The question for the court, then, is whether\n5 defendants have introduced any evidence to show that San Francisco, unlike other communities, is\n6 a place where minor offenders do pose a threat to the jail.  \n7 Defendants have provided no evidence that would allow the court to answer this question in\n8 the affirmative. There is no evidence that the San Francisco jail faced a situation any different from\n9 any other jail.  Minor offenders do not pose a threat to the jail here, just as they do not pose a threat\n10 to jail security  in other cities and towns.\n11 In considering the question of qualified immunity, the Ninth Circuit has required a defendant\n12 to show that there is some salient fact that justifies the defendants’ failure to apply clearly\n13 established law to the situation at hand. The situation need not be identical, for the obvious reason\n14 that this would mean that the very notion of “clearly established” law would disappear in a welter\n15 of case-specific circumstances. In San Jose Charter of Hells Angels Motorcycle Club v. City of San\n16 Jose, 402 F.3d 962, 974-975 (9th Cir. 2005), the court stated, “[Defendant] is not entitled to qualified\n17 immunity ‘simply because there [is] no case on all fours prohibiting [this] particular manifestation\n18 of unconstitutional conduct.’  There need not be prior authority dealing with this precise factual\n19 situation in order to deny [defendant] qualified immunity for his actions.”  (See, e.g., Hope v. Pelzer,\n20 536 U.S. 730, 739 (2002).)  \n21 In the present case, defendants have failed to show that the San Francisco jail faced any risk\n22 from minor offender arrestees – including those charged with offenses that do not necessarily involve\n23 violence.  Therefore, the Ninth Circuit’s ruling that it is unlawful to conduct strip searches of\n24 arrestees before arraignment under blanket policies is fully applicable.  Therefore, the Sheriff can\n25 be held responsible for failing to conform his policies to this clearly established law.\n26 \\\\\\\n27 \\\\\\\n28 \\\\\\\nPLTS’ OPPOSITION TO DEF SHERIFF HENNESSEY’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT RE: QUALIFIED IMMUNITY\nMARY BULL, et al. v.

INTRODUCTION\n3 On April 4, 2005, in San Jose Charter of Hells Angels Motorcycle Club v. City of San Jose\n4 402 F.3d 962 (9th Cir. 2005), the Ninth Circuit reiterated a court’s inquiry in deciding whether an\n5 official is entitled to qualified immunity:\n6 The Supreme Court has set forth a two-pronged inquiry to resolve all\nqualified immunity claims. First, \"taken in the light most favorable to\n7 the party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged show the officers'\nconduct violated a constitutional right?\" Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201.\n8 Second, if so, was that right clearly established? Id. \"The relevant,\ndispositive  inquiry  in  determining  whether  a  right  is  clearly\n9 established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his\nconduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.\" Id. at 202. This\n10 inquiry is wholly objective and is undertaken in light of the specific\nfactual circumstances of the case.\n11\n12 (402 F.3d at 971, quoting Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, at 201, 202 (2001).)  Accordingly, plaintiffs\n13 will set forth their argument in accordance with the parameters of this two pronged inquiry.\n14 II. DEFENDANTS VIOLATED THE FOURTH AMENDMENT BY IMPLEMENTING\nBLANKET POLICIES FOR THE STRIP SEARCHING OF MINOR OFFENSE\n15 ARRESTEES BROUGHT TO THE JAIL BEFORE ARRAIGNMENT\n16 A. Temporary Detainees – Those Arrested for Minor Offenses and Held at the Jail\nuntil Arraignment – Are Protected from Strip Searches under the Fourth\n17 Amendment\n18 Courts addressing the constitutionality of strip searches begin their analyses with Bell v.\n19 Wolfish (1979) 441 U.S. 520.  The Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of a strip search\n20 policy applied to pretrial detainees at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC), a short term\n21 federally operated custodial facility in New York City.  Plaintiff challenged the strip-searching of\n22 detainees following their contact visits with persons from outside the facility.  (441 U.S. at 537.)\n23 The Court tested the constitutionality of the strip searches against the Fourth Amendment\n24 proscription of unreasonable searches.  While the practice of strip searching “instinctively [gave the\n25 Court] the most pause,” (441 U.S. at 558), the Court “[b]alanc[ed] the significant and legitimate\n26 security interests of the institution against the privacy interests of the inmates, the Court concluded\n27 that the “visual body-cavity inspections as contemplated by the MCC rules” may be conducted\n28 absent probable cause.  (441 U.S. at 560.)\nPLTS’ OPPOSITION TO DEF SHERIFF HENNESSEY’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT RE: QUALIFIED IMMUNITY\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB\n4\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840     Document 214-1     Filed 08/12/2005     Page 9 of 22(cid:10)\n1 In 1984, the Ninth Circuit decided Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614 (9th Cir. 1984).  Plaintiff\n2 had been strip searched at a local Idaho jail following her arrest for a traffic violation.  The parties\n3 “[did] not dispute the nature of the intrusion. They agree that Giles' privacy was invaded in a\n4 frightening and humiliating manner.”  (746 F.2d at 617.)  Unequivocally holding that strip searches\n5 of arrestees for minor offenses must be predicated on reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is\n6 carrying contraband, the Court stated: \n7 We hold that arrestees for minor offenses may be subjected to a strip\nsearch only if jail officials have a reasonable suspicion that the\n8 particular arrestee is carrying or concealing contraband or suffering\nfrom a communicable disease. Because no such suspicion existed in\n9 Giles's case, the officer who searched Giles violated her rights under\nthe fourth amendment.   . . . \n10\nWe conclude, however, that strip searching of every arrestee booked\n11 into the Bonneville County Jail is not necessary to protect the\ninstitution's security interest. Balancing that interest against  the\n12 privacy interests of arrestees, we hold that arrestees charged with\nminor offenses may be subjected to a strip search only if jail officials\n13 possess a reasonable suspicion that the individual arrestee is carrying\nor concealing contraband. Reasonable suspicion may be based on\n14 such factors as the nature of the offense, the arrestee's appearance and\nconduct, and the prior arrest record.  (Emphasis added.)\n15\n16 (746 F.2d at  615, 617.)  Rejecting the argument that those arrested for such offenses likely would\n17 be carrying contraband, the court noted, “[A]rrest and confinement in the Bonneville County Jail are\n18 unplanned events, so the policy could not possibly deter arrestees from carrying contraband.”  (746\n19 F.2d at 617.)\n20 Giles followed the Fourth Circuit decision in Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007, 1013 (4th Cir.\n21 1981) which held that a strip search which required county jail personnel to strip search an individual\n22 arrested for drunk driving ” ‘conclusively’ ” violated the Fourth Amendment  and “ ‘bore no such\n23 discernible relationship to security needs at the Detention Center that, when balanced against the\n24 ultimate invasion of personal rights involved, it could reasonably be thought justified.’ ” (Giles, 746\n25 F.2d at 618.)  \n26 Most relevant to the Sheriff’s qualified immunity plea, Giles explained that the placing of\n27 “temporary detainees” in the general population did not justify the County’s policy.  (746 F.2d at\n28 619.)  As plaintiffs have pointed out in the reply filed in support of their motion for partial summary\nPLTS’ OPPOSITION TO DEF SHERIFF HENNESSEY’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT RE: QUALIFIED IMMUNITY\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB\n5\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840     Document 214-1     Filed 08/12/2005     Page 10 of 22(cid:10)\n1 judgment, “temporary detainees” are those who are ‘arrested and held overnight or for another short\n2 period before appearing before a judicial officer and those waiting to be released while a bond is\n3 posted, a relative comes, or the like.” (See, Reply Memorandum, pp.8-11;  Smith v. Montgomery,\n4 547 F.Supp.592, 593 (D.Md.1982), cited with approval by Giles, 746 F.2d at 617.)  In other words,\n5 the term “temporary detainees” refers to the arrestees who are in the class before the court in the\n6 present case:  arrestees who are held in the jail prior to arraignment.\n7 The Ninth Circuit revisited the issue in Ward v. San Diego County, 791 F.2d 1329 (9th Cir.\n8 1986).  Following plaintiff’s 1981 arrest for the misdemeanor offense of “failing to appear,” plaintiff\n9 was stripped and searched prior to a determination of whether she was eligible for an own\n10 recognizance release.  Rejecting the sheriff’s claim of qualified immunity, the Ninth Circuit\n11 concluded “that the law was sufficiently clear in early 1981 so as to expose a public official who\n12 unreasonably authorized blanket strip searches of minor offense arrestees to civil liability under 42\n13 U.S.C. § 1983.”  (791 F.2d at 1332.)  The court relied on cases which held that the strip search of\n14 an individual arrested on a misdemeanor traffic violation who was unable to post bond violated the\n15 constitution where no reasonable suspicion existed the arrestee would possess a weapon or\n16 contraband.  (Ward, 791 F.2d at 1333.)  \n17 In Act Up!/Portland v. Bagley, 988 F.2d 868, 871-872 (9th Cir. 1992), as noted above, the\n18 Ninth Circuit recognized that by 1989 “it was clearly established in this circuit that it is unlawful to\n19 strip search an arrestee brought to a jail facility on charges of committing a minor offense, unless the\n20 officer directing the search possesses ‘a reasonable suspicion that the individual arrestee is carrying\n21 or concealing contraband.’ ” \n22 Thompson v. City of Los Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439 (9th Cir. 1989) held that strip searches may\n23 be constitutional where the crime for which the detainee has been arrested  -- in Thompson, grand\n24 theft auto -- provides the individualized reasonable suspicion necessary to justify the search.  The\n25 court, however, citing numerous decisions from sister circuits, reiterated that: \n26 [T]his court and several other courts have invalidated blanket visual\nstrip search policies as applied to arrestees detained for minor traffic\n27 offenses  and  other  misdemeanors  not  normally  associated  with\nweapons or other contraband.

Crouch, 872\n9 F.2d 1248, 1253, 1254-1255 (6th Cir. 1990), where the court stated \"the fact of intermingling alone\n10 has never been found to justify [a strip search of a minor offense arrestee] without consideration\n11 of the nature of the offense and the question of whether there is any reasonable basis for concern\n12 that the particular detainee will attempt to introduce weapons or other contraband into the\n13 institution\".  (885 F.2d at 1447 (emphasis added).)\n14 Within a month after deciding Thompson, the Ninth Circuit delivered its opinion in Kennedy\n15 v. Los Angeles Police Department, 901 F.2d 702 (9th Cir. 1989), which held that classification of an\n16 offense as a felony, standing alone, did not justify a strip-search.  A dispute between roommates had\n17 led to the arrest of one roommate for felony grand theft after her roommate accused her of stealing\n18 a television and other property which the officers values at more than $400.00, the threshold for\n19 grand theft.  Following her arrest, Kennedy was a forced to submit to a body cavity search.  (901\n20 F.2d at 704.)  \n21 The Court placed a heavy burden on those defending blanket strip searches of all incoming\n22 suspected felons, emphasizing, at the outset, that “The intrusiveness of a body-cavity search cannot\n23 be overstated.  Strip searches involving the visual exploration of body cavities is dehumanizing and\n24 humiliating.”  (901 F.2d at 711.)  The LAPD subjected all felony arrestees to a body-cavity search\n25 as a matter of course, whereas only those misdemeanor arrestees charged with offenses relating to\n26 narcotics or suspected of concealing contraband or weapons were forced to undergo such a search.\n27 (901 F.2d at 713.)  \n28 \\\\\\\nPLTS’ OPPOSITION TO DEF SHERIFF HENNESSEY’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT RE: QUALIFIED IMMUNITY\nMARY BULL, et al. v.

A ham-handed\n3 approach to policy making runs the serious risk of infringing upon detainees' constitutional rights.\n4 (901 F.2d at 713 (Citations omitted).)\n5 The court held that the Department’s policy was unsupported by any “serious justification.”\n6 (901 F.2d at 716.)  It held that while the nature of an offense may be a factor in determining the\n7 existence of that reasonable suspicion sufficient to justify a strip search, the classification of\n8 particular conduct as a felony rather than a misdemeanor did not, standing alone, justify a strip\n9 search.  (901 F.2d 716.)\n10 The Ninth Circuit applied the foregoing precedents in Fuller v. M.G. Jewelry, 950 F.2d 1437\n11 (9th Cir. 1991).  Plaintiffs were arrested on suspicion of taking a ring valued at $800 from a jewelry\n12 store.  (950 F.2d at 1439-1440.)  Officers conducted a field pat-down search of plaintiffs and\n13 searched plaintiffs’ purses, but found nothing.  Plaintiffs were arrested on suspicion of grand theft\n14 and, while detained, were subjected to two strip and visual body and cavity searches, one at the\n15 central station and a second at the women’s jail; neither search uncovered any crime.  (950 F.2d at\n16 1439, 1440.)\n17 The  court  reiterated  that  classification  of  the  alleged  crime  as  a  felony  “is  of  no\n18 consequence.”  (950 F.2d at 1446.)  The court restated the rationale for its decisions in Giles  and\n19 Kennedy:\n20 The clearly-stated rationale underlying those decisions, which allow\nbody cavity searches of prisoners and detainees on less than probable\n21 cause, is to protect prisons and jails from smuggled weapons, drugs\nor other contraband which pose a threat to the safety and security of\n22 penal institutions. \n23 These  decisions  suggest  that  strip  and  body  cavity  searches  of\ndetainees may be conducted based on reasonable suspicion only\n24 where such searches are necessary to protect the overriding security\nneeds of the institution--that is, where officials have a reasonable\n25 suspicion that a particular detainee harbors weapons or dangerous\ncontraband.\n26\n27 (950 F.2d at 1447.)  \n28 \\\\\\\nPLTS’ OPPOSITION TO DEF SHERIFF HENNESSEY’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT RE: QUALIFIED IMMUNITY\nMARY BULL, et al. v.

Santa Clara Valley Transportation\n2 Agency, 261 F.3d 912, 922 (9th Cir. 2001) (“[S]trip searches of persons arrested for minor offenses\n3 are prohibited by the Fourth Amendment, unless reasonable suspicion exists that the arrestee is\n4 carrying or concealing contraband or suffering from a communicable disease.”)  District courts in\n5 this circuit have followed the foregoing precedents.  (See, e.g., Adnan v. Santa Clara County Dept.\n6 of Corrections (2002 WL 32058464, (N.D.Cal. 2002) [Even if the searches are visual rather than\n7 physical, the degree of intrusion is significant and does not appear to be justified by a legitimate\n8 penological interest. Therefore, Plaintiff asserts a cognizable claim that the strip searches violated\n9 his Fourth Amendment rights.].) \n10 B. Sheriff Hennessey Has Made No Showing That the Jail’s Policy of Strip\nSearching Minor Offense Arrestees Is Justified by Security Concerns\n11\n12 Sheriff Hennessey states that he authorized the former strip-search policy to combat a major\n13 safety problem arising from the smuggling of drugs and weapons into the jails.  He relies primarily\n14 on a declaration by Undersheriff Jan Dempsey which lists contraband found in jail cells from April\n15 2000-December 2003 and on exhibits attached to the Declaration of Captain Ellen Brin.  As\n16 Plaintiffs have already pointed out in the reply filed in support of their own motion for partial\n17 summary judgment, this “evidence” does not support the policies Plaintiffs challenge here. \n18 The contraband Undersheriff Jan Dempsey lists in her declaration was uncovered during\n19 searches in cells.  No evidence exists that these cells housed individuals following their arrest for\n20 offenses not involving weapons, drugs or violence; indeed, this contraband was discovered during\n21 the period that defendants strip searched all arrestees who were placed in the “general population”\n22 (which was itself segregated through the “classification” process on the basis of age, criminal\n23 sophistication, prior record and the like). The Dempsey material makes no claim that deputies\n24 discovered the catalogued contraband during strip searches of class members -- detainees arrested\n25 for offenses not involving drugs, weapons or violence.  The Brin declaration, to which Plaintiffs have\n26 objected, provides no relevant information.  Captain Brin fails to offer evidence that the contraband\n27 she lists was uncovered during strip-searches of detainees arrested for offenses not involving drugs,\n28 \\\\\\\nPLTS’ OPPOSITION TO DEF SHERIFF HENNESSEY’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT RE: QUALIFIED IMMUNITY\nMARY BULL, et al. v.

Indeed, the exhibits do not list the charges for which the individuals were\n2 arrested. \n3 Sheriff Hennessey’s own testimony provides the coup de grace to his argument.  Plaintiffs’\n4 counsel asked the Sheriff at his deposition if the Sheriff believed that “the incorporation into the\n5 general population in and of itself is sufficient reason to strip search all persons held prearraignment\n6 at the San Francisco Jail.”  Sheriff Hennessey answered, “No,” although admitting that such was his\n7 policy prior to January 2004.  (Deposition of Sheriff Michael Hennessey, at 83:10-19,  Ex. 2 to the\n8 Declaration of Thom Seaton.)\n9 Consistent with that belief, the Sheriff changed his policy in January 2004; no longer would\n10 classification for housing be an independent basis for strip-searching pre-arraignment detainees\n11 arrested for offenses not involving weapons, drugs or violence.  Undersheriff Dempsey explains that\n12 “The new ‘Searches’ policy is intended to better address the balance between institutional safety and\n13 current legal developments.”  (Dempsey Declaration, ¶ 8.)  She fails to state, however, to what new\n14 legal developments she refers.  The law has been stable on the question of strip-searching minor\n15 offenders for twenty years or more. If the policies were changed because arrestees were finally taking\n16 the Sheriff to court to enforce their rights, this circumstance can hardly be cited in support of\n17 qualified immunity: rather, the change is an admission that the law was clearly established and the\n18 unlawful practices were indefensible and unnecessary as a security matter. (See, Federal Rule of\n19 Evidence 407; Eng v. Skully, 146 F.R.D. 74 (S.D.N.Y.1993) [Evidence of policy changes is\n20 admissible to prove feasibility of alternative measures or for impeachment purposes].)\n21 C. All  “Temporary  Detainees”  Brought  to  the  Jail  on  Minor  Offenses  Are\nProtected Against Strip Search, Even If They Are Moved out of the Booking\n22 Area into the Housing Area of the Jail\n23 In Giles and Thompson, the Ninth Circuit made clear that a policy of strip-searching minor\n24 offense arrestees before arraignment was not justified simply because some of these detainees were\n25 placed in housing with the general jail population.  Thompson’s language should have been quite\n26 clear to Sheriff Hennessey:\n27 Although Thompson, like the arrestees in Dobrowolskyj and Dufrin,\nwas placed into contact with the general jail population, such a factor\n28 by itself cannot justify a strip search.

District courts in the Ninth Circuit recognized that this was controlling\n7 circuit precedent.  (Wong v. Beebe, 2002 WL 31548486 (D. Or. 2002), (rev’d. on other grounds\n8 Wong v.

Los Angeles\n16 Police Department, supra, and Thompson, supra].)\n17 D. Temporary Detainees Placed in “Safety” Cells (Solitary Confinement) Are\nProtected from Strip Searches by the Fourth Amendment \n18\n19 Sheriff Hennessey seeks an exception from the Fourth Amendment which would allow the\n20 strip searching of all those placed in safety cells prior to arraignment.3  However, placement in safety\n21 cells under the Sheriff’s prior policy was not tied to a perception that the detainee possessed\n22 contraband such as weapons or drugs.  The criteria for such placement were indefinable  -- for\n23 example, placement could be made without medical authorization if a supervisor deemed that the\n24 arrestee displayed “bizarre behavior” or seemed “gravely disabled”. Some of the criteria were\n25\n26\n3  Plaintiffs’ papers supporting their motion for partial summary judgment address the unconstitutionality of this\n27 overbroad blanket policy.  See, Plaintiffs Memorandum Of Points And Authorities In Support Of Partial Summary\nJudgment, at pp. 17-19; Plaintiffs’ Reply To Defendants’ Opposition To Plaintiffs’ Motion For Partial Summary\n28\nJudgment, pp. 14-16.\nPLTS’ OPPOSITION TO DEF SHERIFF HENNESSEY’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT RE: QUALIFIED IMMUNITY\nMARY BULL, et al. v.

Some of the criteria were catchalls for a broad range of behavior – for\n3 example, “danger to self/others” – a criteria so broad that the underlying behavior might or might\n4 not be related to security of the person or the jail. In the case of Miki Mangosing, for example, an\n5 arrestee brought in for “drunk in public” was classified as appropriate for safety cell placement\n6 because she was so drunk she was “out of control”.  (See, plaintiff’s reply in support of their motion\n7 for summary judgment, ¶ 14.)  Arrestees were placed in these cells naked. \n8 These policies were unconstitutional because they did not require a scintilla of suspicion that\n9 the arrestee, as an individual, posed a risk of smuggling contraband in a body cavity. By 1989, “it\n10 was clearly established in this circuit that it is unlawful to strip search an arrestee brought to a jail\n11 facility on charges of committing a minor offense, unless the officer directing the search possesses\n12 ‘a reasonable suspicion that the individual arrestee is carrying or concealing contraband.’ ” (Act\n13 Up!/Portland v. Bagley, 988 F.2d 868, 871-872 (9th Cir. 1992) [emphasis added].  See, e.g., Fuller\n14 v. M.G. Jewelry, supra, 950 F.2d at 1437, 1447 (“[S]trip and body cavity searches of detainees may\n15 be conducted based on reasonable suspicion only where such searches are necessary to protect the\n16 overriding security needs of the institution--that is, where officials have a reasonable suspicion that\n17 a particular detainee harbors weapons or dangerous contraband.”[emphasis added]).)  The Sheriff\n18 does not argue that a reasonable suspicion existed that all individuals placed in safety cells posed a\n19 risk of smuggling contraband, regardless of the arrest, the charge, the history and mental status.\n20 Therefore he has failed to show the strip search on a blanket basis of all safety cell placements can\n21 be justified under the Bell v. Wolfish balancing test and the Ninth Circuit cases that charge jails to\n22 limit the strip search of minor offense arrestees to those instances where there is some security basis\n23 of the search.\n24 E. Arrestees Brought to the Jail on Offenses Which Do Not Require Violent\nConduct as an Element of the Offense or as the Basis of the Arrest Are\n25 Protected  by  the  Fourth  Amendment  from  Strip  Searches  Without\nIndividualized Suspicion\n26\n27 Sheriff Hennessey contends that because Zern was arrested for resisting arrest causing serious\n28 bodily injury to a police officer and Corneau was arrested for battery of a spouse or someone in a\nPLTS’ OPPOSITION TO DEF SHERIFF HENNESSEY’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT RE: QUALIFIED IMMUNITY\nMARY BULL, et al. v.

MG.  Jewelry,\n6 supra, 950 F.2d at 1447.)  In this circuit, there is a clear limitation on blanket searches of arrestees\n7 charged with offenses which may not involve violence and a clear requirement for a security\n8 justification for any blanket search at the stage before arraignment.  The Sheriff has failed to show\n9 any security justification for such blanket searches that would differentiate this case from the clear\n10 limitations imposed by the Ninth Circuit. \n11 III. IT  SHOULD  HAVE  BEEN  CLEAR  TO  SHERIFF  HENNESSEY  THAT  THE\nCHALLENGED POLICIES WERE UNLAWFUL AND THEREFORE HE IS NOT\n12 ENTITLED TO IMMUNITY FROM LIABILITY\n13 A. Sheriff Hennessey Should Have Known, and in Fact, Did Know, That the Jail’s\nPolicies of Strip Searching Minor Offense Arrestees Before Arraignment,\n14 Simply Because They Were “Classified’ for Jail Housing, Was Unlawful\n15 Sheriff Hennessey seeks to avoid the effect of language in Giles v. Ackerman, supra, that\n16 explained that the placing of temporary detainees in the general population did not justify the\n17 County’s policy.5  Giles noted \" ‘[d]efendants' heavy reliance on the intermingling of its temporary\n18 detainees with the general [jail] population is misplaced’ because such intermingling is both limited\n19 and avoidable.”  (746 F.2d at 619.)  Sheriff Hennessey takes great pains to note that Giles addressed\n20 the policy of the small Bonneville County Jail and not an urban facility --rife with smuggling --\n21 which the Sheriff administers.  \n22\n23\n4  Plaintiffs’ papers supporting their motion for partial summary judgment address the constitutionality of the\nstrip-searches of these Plaintiffs.  See, Plaintiffs Memorandum Of Points And Authorities In Support Of Partial Summary\n24 Judgment, at pp. 19-23; Plaintiffs’ Reply To Defendants’ Opposition To Plaintiffs’ Motion For Partial Summary\nJudgment, pp. 12-13.\n25\n5   The Sheriff protests Plaintiffs’ use of the term, “blanket strip-search policy.” This term simply refers to the\n26 uniform and indiscriminate strip searches of classes of people.  Plaintiffs do not contend that deputies categorically strip\nsearched other arrestees, including those arrested for drunkenness and those cited and released. Also, some, but not all,\n27 inmates able to post bail avoided strip search; this depended on whether they were coerced to sign consent forms (in\nwhich case they were strip searched upon booking) and the amount of time the jail, in its sole discretion, held them in\n28\nthe booking area (they might be able to post bail before being moved out into housing). \nPLTS’ OPPOSITION TO DEF SHERIFF HENNESSEY’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT RE: QUALIFIED IMMUNITY\nMARY BULL, et al. v.

City of Los Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439 (9th Cir.\n4 1989) which focused on policies of an urban jail system.  Citing Giles, Thompson reiterated that the\n5 placing of a newly arrested detainee “into contact with the general jail population . . . by itself cannot\n6 justify a strip search.”  (885 F.2d at 1447.)  Thus, even assuming that Giles was distinguishable to\n7 a jail administrator, Thompson provided fair warning that automatically strip-searching all detainees\n8 placed in housing with the general jail population, regardless of the crimes the detainees committed,\n9 violated the Fourth Amendment. 6\n10 Among the factors a court considers in determining a defendant’s entitlement to qualified\n11 immunity is “information the searching officers possessed.”   (Anderson v. Creighton,  483 U.S. 635,\n12 641 (1987).  See, e.g., Hammond v. Kunard, 148 F.3d 692, 697 (7th Cir. 1998) (Because “Information\n13 possessed by an officer may be relevant to the inquiry . . . It is therefore appropriate for the court to\n14 look at what the defendants knew at the time of the alleged constitutional deprivation to see if they\n15 acted ‘reasonably.’”); Act Up!/Portland v. Bagley, 988 F.2d 868, 873, (9th Cir. 1993) (Facts and\n16 circumstances within officer’s knowledge considered); Fuller v. M.G. Jewelry, 950 F.2d 1437, 1443\n17 (9th Cir. 1991) (Examine established law and information officer possessed).)\n18 Here, the Sheriff’s contention that he believed Fourth Amendment protection extended only\n19 to those arrestees who were held in the booking area while awaiting bail is not supported by the jail’s\n20 actual practice.  There was no special, defined “sanctuary” period during which arrestees were\n21 protected from strip search.  Captain Arata’s memorandum dated February 23, 2000, states that\n22 “Prisoners should be strip searched before the conclusion of the watch.”  (Arata Memorandum, Ex.\n23 1 to Declaration of Thom Seaton.)  If the end of the watch occurred shortly after the arrestee arrived,\n24 that person was then subject to a strip search.  Indeed, Sheriff Hennessey has failed to identify any\n25\n26 6  Defendants’ reliance on authority from other circuits, is of no moment. See, Rivero v. City and County of San\nFrancisco, 316 F.3d 857, 865 (9th Cir. 2002) (“The issue is not what the law was or might have been in other circuits\n27 in 1993. It is, rather, what the \"controlling authority in [the defendants'] jurisdiction [was] at the time of the incident.\").\nBut see, Plaintiffs’ Reply To Defendants’ Opposition To Plaintiffs’ Motion For Partial Summary Judgment which\n28\naddresses Defendants’ cited authorities at some length at pp. 10-12, n.4; see also,\nPLTS’ OPPOSITION TO DEF SHERIFF HENNESSEY’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT RE: QUALIFIED IMMUNITY\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB\n15\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840     Document 214-1     Filed 08/12/2005     Page 20 of 22(cid:10)\n1 written policy whatever protecting those able to post bail from a strip search.  Even Dyer’s\n2 deposition testimony cited in the Sheriff’s papers states that the time permitted to obtain bail\n3 depended upon the amount of activity in the intake facility.  (Dyer Depo, 25:23-26:2.)  Thus,\n4 avoiding strip-searches was happenstance, a matter of jail convenience and the need to relieve\n5 congestion, rather than a result of a recognized, legally protected status.\n6 Finally, here Sheriff Hennessey admitted in his deposition that he knew that incorporation\n7 of detainees into the general population in and of itself was not a sufficient reason to strip search all\n8 persons held pre-arraignment at the jail.  An official who admits that the challenged policy is\n9 unlawful and unnecessary cannot have made the type of “reasonable mistake” that qualified\n10 immunity protects.  (See, Parkes v. County of San Diego 345 F. Supp.2d 1071,1088 (S.D. CA 2004)\n11 [where social worker did not believe mother presented threat to children but nevertheless authorized\n12 taking of the children from the mother, qualified immunity denied].)\n13 B. Sheriff Hennessey Should Have Known the Jail’s Policy for Strip Searching All\nSafety Cell Placements Was Unlawful\n14\n15 The Sheriff asserts that because the Ninth Circuit did not specifically condemn the strip-\n16 searching of all detainees placed in safety cells prior to arraignment, Ninth Circuit precedent failed\n17 to provide fair warning that his safety cell strip-search policy might result in his liability.  Plaintiffs\n18 already have noted, per Hope v. Pelzer 536 U.S. 730, 739 (2002), that the Supreme Court has\n19 rejected the view that “the facts of previous cases be 'materially similar' to the case at hand, or that\n20 “an official action is protected by qualified immunity unless the very action in question has\n21 previously been held unlawful.”   (See, e.g., San Jose Charter of Hells Angels Motorcycle Club v.\n22 City of San Jose, supra, 402 F.3d at 974-975.)\n23 The Ninth Circuit had provided Sheriff Hennessey with notice that it considered strip-\n24 searches “dehumanizing and humiliating”  (Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Department, supra, 901\n25 F.2d at 711), and that such searches only could proceed on the basis of individualized reasonable\n26 suspicion that those searched would yield contraband.  While in some instances the blanket strip\n27 search of a class of detainees before arraignment, such as those arrested for crimes involving\n28 weapons, drugs or violence, may be sanctioned (no case has yet tested the limits of this proposition),\nPLTS’ OPPOSITION TO DEF SHERIFF HENNESSEY’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT RE: QUALIFIED IMMUNITY\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB\n16\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840     Document 214-1     Filed 08/12/2005     Page 21 of 22(cid:10)\n1 the law has been well-established for years that strip-searches of categories of minor offense\n2 arrestees must have a discernible relation to the risk that the class of arrestees will smuggle\n3 contraband.  \n4 The Sheriff, therefore, should reasonably have known that blanket strip searches of safety-cell\n5 placements before arraignment would leave him vulnerable to suit absent a showing that all of these\n6 temporary detainees were reasonably suspected as a class to carry hidden weapons or drugs.  Yet\n7 Sheriff Hennessey has provided no evidence that he formulated this particular strip-search policy due\n8 to evidence that those placed in safety cells were prone to hide weapons or drugs on their persons,\n9 or that the blanket strip searches were necessary or even advisable for reasons of jail security.  The\n10 Sheriff, who should have been well aware that strip-searches of minor offense arrestees must be\n11 justified by particularized reasonable suspicion, may not escape liability because he was allegedly\n12 waiting for a Ninth Circuit decision condemning strip-searches of this particular category, when he\n13 knew that these safety cell placements, who were confined in solitary cells without medical\n14 authorization, included the very minor offense arrestees protected from strip search when brought\n15 to the jail. \n16 C. Sheriff Hennessey Should Have Known That the Ninth Circuit Has Limited the\nStrip Search of Arrestees Prior to Arraignment to Those Who Are Charged\n17 with Offenses Involving Violence in the Absence of Particularized Reasonable\nSuspicion\n18\n19 It need hardly be re-emphasized that the Ninth Circuit has repeatedly declared that the Fourth\n20 Amendment protects arrestees charged with minor offenses from strip searches when brought to the\n21 jail, unless there is individualized suspicion, and has defined “minor offenses” as those not involving\n22 drugs, weapons or violence. Plaintiffs Corneau and Zern were searched pursuant to a policy broadly\n23 defining “violent” crimes. The overbroad policy obviated the need for individualized reasonable\n24 suspicion.  Ninth Circuit precedent applying Bell v. Wolfish and requiring a security justification for\n25 an indiscriminate search of arrestees prior to arraignment – precisely because at this stage the\n26 arrestees have not been charged with any crime – was clearly established when Corneau and Zern\n27 were brought to the jail.  It was also clearly established that individualized suspicion was required\n28 to strip search those charged with minor offenses.  Sheriff Hennessey should have known that his\nPLTS’ OPPOSITION TO DEF SHERIFF HENNESSEY’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT RE: QUALIFIED IMMUNITY\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB\n17\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840     Document 214-1     Filed 08/12/2005     Page 22 of 22(cid:10)\n1 policies must be tailored to conform to this precedent, and that he could not implement a blanket\n2 policy that directed strip searches on the basis of the charge alone when the charge did not\n3 necessarily or reliably indicate the offense involved violence and therefore the arrestee so charged\n4 posed a threat of smuggling contraband into the jail. \n5 CONCLUSION\n6 Clearly established law forbade strip-searching detainees solely because of their classification\n7 for housing in the general population or safety cell placement – whether such housing occurred in\n8 a rural or urban setting.  (Thompson v. City of Los Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439 (9th Cir. 1989).)\n9 Moreover, Sheriff Hennessey has conceded that, without more, the placement in the general jail\n10 population of detainees not arrested for crimes involving weapons, drugs or violence is not justified.\n11 Therefore he is not entitled to qualified immunity with respect to these policies.\n12 The Court must also reject his qualified immunity from liability for strip searching arrestees\n13 who were brought to the jail with charges that might or might not involve violence.  This was an\n14 unconstitutionally overbroad “blanket” policy, the defects of which should have been clear to the\n15 Sheriff.  The Court therefore must reject Sheriff Hennessey’s motion in its entirety.\n16 DATED: August 9, 2005 Respectfully submitted,\n17 LAW OFFICE OF MARK E.

Plaintiffs seek an\n9 order declaring illegal defendants’ policy of subjecting detainees in their custody to strip and visual\n10 body cavity searches before they are arraigned and without having any reasonable suspicion that the\n11 searches will be productive of contraband. \n12 Plaintiffs also seek declaratory and injunctive relief, damages, and punitive damages against\n13 the defendants for the policy, practice, and custom of placing detainees, naked, in rooms referred to as\n14 “cold rooms,” without any legitimate purpose, but in order to compel consent to illegal strip searches,\n15 to punish persons who question illegal practices, or for other illegal purposes.  These cold rooms are\n16 kept bone chillingly cold, lack access to natural light and are devoid of furniture and running water. \n17 The cold rooms are constantly illuminated by flourescent lighting and persons confined in them can\n18 only sit or lie on the bare floor.  Defendants’ use of the “cold rooms” violates Sections 1055 and 1083\n19 of Title 15 of the California Code of Regulations which specify that isolation or “safe rooms” which\n20 may have legitimate psychological uses cannot be used for punishment and that persons confined\n21 therein must be provided with adequate bedding and clothing. \n22 Defendants’ strip search, visual body cavity search, and cold room policies, practices, and\n23 customs violate plaintiffs’ rights secured to them by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the\n24 U.S. Constitution and entitle plaintiffs to recover damages under the Federal Civil Rights Act (42\n25 U.S.C. § 1983).  \n26\nPage 2 of 20\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 55      Filed 01/12/2004     Page 3 of 20\n1 Additionally, plaintiffs include supplemental claims under California state law against\n2 defendants: 1) for violation of California Penal Code § 4030 which prohibits pre-arraignment strip\n3 searches of most misdemeanents and provides for minimum damages of $1,000 for each illegal search;\n4 2) for wholesale violation of Sections 1055 and 1083 of Section 15 of the California Code of\n5 Regulations (promulgated under the authority of California Penal Code § 6030) which describes the\n6 very narrow conditions under which a cold room can be used; and, 3) for violation of the Unruh Civil\n7 Rights Act (California Civil Code §§ 52 and 52.1(b)) pursuant to which each plaintiff denied a\n8 statutory or state or federal Constitutional right is entitled to recover a minimum of $4,000 for each\n9 violation.  \n10 JURISDICTION\n11 1. This action is brought pursuant to 42 USC § 1983 and 1988, and the Fourth and\n12 Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  Jurisdiction is founded upon 28 USC §\n13 1331 and 1341(3) and (4) and the aforementioned statutory and constitutional provisions.  \n14 2. The court has supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ state claims under 28 USC §\n15 1367(a).\n16 3. The amount in controversy exceeds $10,000, excluding interest and costs.\n17 PARTIES\n18 4. Plaintiffs, including MARY BULL, JONAH ZERN, LISA GIAMPAOLI, MARCY\n19 CORNEAU, ALEXIS BRONSON, MICKY MANGOSING, CHARLI JOHNSON, LEIGH\n20 FLEMING, and LAURA TIMBROOK, and all those similarly situated, are, and at all material times\n21 herein, were citizens of the United States and residents of the state of California who were arrested\n22 within the period beginning three (3) years before February 10, 2003, and continuing to this date, and\n23 who were subjected to strip and/or visual body cavity searches at a San Francisco County Jail\n24 (hereinafter referred to as the “San Francisco Jail”), prior to being arraigned and/or without the\n25 defendants first having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be\n26 productive of contraband or weapons.\nPage 3 of 20\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 55      Filed 01/12/2004     Page 4 of 20\n1 5. Some plaintiffs, including MARY BULL, LISA GIAMPAOLI, ALEXIS BRONSON,\n2 MICKY MANGOSING, CHARLI JOHNSON and LEIGH FLEMING,  were confined by defendants\n3 in “cold rooms” at the San Francisco Jail to coerce compliance with illegal orders or for punishment in\n4 violation of their state and federal statutory and constitutional rights. \n5 6. Defendant CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO SHERIFF MICHAEL\n6 HENNESSEY is, and at all material times referred to herein, was the duly elected Sheriff of the city\n7 and county of San Francisco, responsible for administering the Jail facilities and for making,\n8 overseeing, and implementing the policies, practices, and customs challenged herein relating to the\n9 operation of the San Francisco Jail.  He is sued in his individual and official capacities.\n10 7. Defendants SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY SHERIFF DEPUTIES sued herein by their\n11 fictitious names (Does 1 through 150) are all deputies who, as part of their duties at the San Francisco\n12 Jails, subjected plaintiffs to pre-arraignment strip and/or visual body cavity searches without first\n13 having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of\n14 contraband or weapons.   Furthermore, Defendants SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY SHERIFF\n15 DEPUTIES sued herein by their fictitious names (Does 1 through 150) are all deputies who, as part of\n16 their duties at the San Francisco Jail, confined plaintiffs in “cold rooms” to gain compliance with\n17 illegal order or to punish plaintiffs.  \n18 8. At all material times mentioned herein, each of the defendants was acting under the\n19 color of law, to wit, under color of statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies, customs and usages of\n20 the State of California, the CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO and/or the SAN\n21 FRANCISCO COUNTY SHERIFF . \n22 9. Defendant CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO is, and at all material times\n23 referred to herein, was, a division of the state of California, that maintained or permitted an official\n24 policy or custom or practice causing or permitting the occurrence of the types of wrongs complained\n25 of herein, which wrongs damaged plaintiffs as herein alleged.  Plaintiffs’ allegations against the\n26 COUNTY are based on acts and omissions of the SHERIFF and his deputies and on acts and\nPage 4 of 20\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 55      Filed 01/12/2004     Page 5 of 20\n1 omissions of persons who are COUNTY employees, and on the COUNTY’s breach of its duty to\n2 protect plaintiffs from the wrongful conduct of said persons and employees.\n3 10. Defendants SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT and SAN\n4 FRANCISCO COUNTY SHERIFF MICHAEL HENNESSEY, in his individual and official capacity,\n5 also maintained or permitted an official policy or custom or practice causing or permitting the\n6 occurrence of the types of wrongs complained of herein, which wrongs damaged plaintiffs as herein\n7 alleged.\n8 11. Class action plaintiffs are those similarly situated who, during the period beginning\n9 three (3) years before February 10, 2003, and continuing to this date, were subjected by defendants to\n10 pre-arraignment strip and/or visual body cavity searches without defendants having, and recording in\n11 writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or weapons. \n12 Some of the similarly situated plaintiffs were placed by defendants in “cold rooms,” in order to\n13 compel compliance with illegal orders or as punishment and without defendants meeting the\n14 requirements governing the use of such rooms.\n15 FACTS\n16 A.   MARY BULL\n17 12. On or about November 18, 2002, plaintiff MARY BULL, along with many others, was\n18 arrested at a demonstration on Market Street, in San Francisco and charged with vandalism.  Ms.\n19 BULL was taken to the San Francisco Jail, arriving in mid-afternoon.  At approximately 6:00 p.m.,\n20 Ms. BULL was taken to an area to be “dressed-in.” A Sheriff’s deputy (Doe 1) prepared an inventory\n21 of Ms. BULL’s clothing and directed Ms. BULL to sign three documents, one of which was a consent\n22 to strip search which Ms. BULL refused to sign.  Her “dress-in” was terminated, and she was returned\n23 to a holding cell and held for a “classification” interview.  \n24 13. Three hours later, Ms. BULL  was returned to a dress-in room and again directed to\n25 consent to a visual body cavity search. Upon her refusal to consent to the visual body cavity search,\n26 Ms. BULL was taken from the “dress-in” area, to the center of the “bull pen” where she was\nPage 5 of 20\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 55      Filed 01/12/2004     Page 6 of 20\n1 confronted by several officers, male and female, one of whom told her that if she did not voluntarily\n2 submit to a visual body cavity search she would be thrown into a cold room, naked, for 24 hours. \n3 When Ms. BULL again declined to submit to the visual body cavity search, defendants moved her into\n4 the “cold room,” where she was subjected to a forcible visual body cavity search by Does 2 through 5. \n5 14. During the search, a male deputy (Doe 2) entered the room and watched as Ms.\n6 BULL’s clothes were pulled off, three deputies (Does 3 through 5) forced her to lie on her back,\n7 naked, bent her legs towards her chest, and visually inspected her genital and rectal areas.  Ms. BULL\n8 was then left naked in the “cold room” and the metal door shut.\n9 15. While Ms. BULL was in the “cold room,” she was shocked every few minutes by a\n10 sheriff’s deputies (Does 6 through 10) smashing a baton repeatedly against the door. The smashing of\n11 the baton on the unfurnished “cold room’s” metal door caused an unbearably loud, nerve-shattering\n12 noise, that prevented Ms. BULL from sleeping or resting and caused her to suffer extreme anxiety and\n13 emotional distress.\n14 16. During her time in the “cold room,” Ms. BULL was provided with neither clothing for\n15 her personal privacy nor with blankets or bedding as for a modicum of comfort.  Ms. BULL is\n16 informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Defendants have a policy, practice, and custom of\n17 utilizing confinement in the “cold room” as punishment for non-violent, non-suicidal, and non-\n18 destructive detainees who are dubbed “non-compliant” and that such a policy, practice, and custom\n19 violates the Constitution and laws of the State of California and the United States of America. \n20 17. At approximately 9:00 a.m. on November 19, 2002, Ms. BULL was removed from the\n21 “cold room,” issued some prison clothing, and placed in a holding cell with other detainees.  She was\n22 interviewed for release on her own recognizance and taken upstairs where she was again directed to\n23 consent to a visual body cavity search by Doe 11.  Again, Ms. BULL is informed and believes, and\n24 thereon alleges, that defendants had no reasonable suspicion that a visual body cavity search would\n25 result in the discovery of contraband or weapons.\n26\nPage 6 of 20\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 55      Filed 01/12/2004     Page 7 of 20\n1 18.  Ms. BULL explained to Doe 11 that the California and United States’ Constitutions\n2 and the state penal code preclude such strip searches and declined to cooperate.  Ms. BULL was taken\n3 into another “cold room,” and again subjected to a forcible visual body cavity search by Does 11\n4 through 15.  Ms. BULL was left naked in the “cold room” and later assigned to a cell with\n5 approximately eight bunkbeds.   At about 10:00 p.m., more than 30 hours after she was arrested, Ms.\n6 BULL was released on her own recognizance having never been arraigned.  Defendants had no\n7 reasonable suspicion that a visual body cavity search would result in the discovery of contraband or\n8 weapons.\n9 B.   JONAH ZERN\n10 19. On or about January 18, 2003, plaintiff JONAH ZERN was arrested along with others\n11 at a peace rally in San Francisco.  Mr. ZERN was taken to the San Francisco Jail where he held for\n12 two days before being released on his own recognizance without being arraigned.  Shortly after his\n13 arrival at the San Francisco Jail, Mr. ZERN was taken to a curtained off area where a Sheriff’s deputy,\n14 Doe 16, directed him to remove all his clothes.  The Sheriff’s deputy, Doe 16, then conducted a visual\n15 body cavity search of Mr. ZERN wherein Mr. ZERN had to bend over, spread his buttocks, and cough. \n16 Mr. ZERN is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that defendants had no reasonable suspicion\n17 that a visual body cavity search would result in the discovery of contraband or weapons. On or about\n18 January 23, 2003, the charges filed against Mr. ZERN were dismissed.  Defendants had no reasonable\n19 suspicion that a visual body cavity search would result in the discovery of contraband or weapons.\n20 C.   LISA GIAMPAOLI\n21 20. On or about July 19, 2002, plaintiff LISA GIAMPAOLI was arrested because her dog\n22 allegedly bit one of the young males harassing her outside of a computer/video cafe.  Ms.\n23 GIAMPAOLI was taken to the San Francisco County Jail where she was booked, placed in a holding\n24 cell and directed to disrobe in front of a male officer.  When Ms. GIAMPAOLI stated she believed she\n25 had the right to have some privacy and should not be required to remove her clothes in front of a male\n26 officer, she was grabbed and dragged into the cold room where male and female officers, Does 17, 18\nPage 7 of 20\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 55      Filed 01/12/2004     Page 8 of 20\n1 & 19,  pinned her to the ground and forcibly removed her pants, shirt and underwear.  Her bra was cut\n2 off of her body and she was left naked in the cold room for approximately 12 hours.  \n3 21. During the time Ms. GIAMPAOLI was kept in the cold room, approximately every 20\n4 minutes someone pounded on the door and a male officer would look in and see her naked.  She had\n5 only a hole in the ground to use as a toilet.  \n6 22. Ms. GIAMPAOLI was released the following day and no charges were ever filed\n7 against her.  Defendants had no reasonable suspicion that a visual body cavity search would result in\n8 the discovery of contraband or weapons.\n9 D.   MARCY CORNEAU\n10 23. On or about September 5, 2003, plaintiff MARCY CORNEAU was arrested for\n11 allegedly fighting with her boyfriend.  At the San Francisco County Jail where she was taken, she was\n12 stripped and subjected to a visual body cavity search by Sheriff’s Deputy, Doe 20, who required her to\n13 bend over and spread her buttocks for visual examination of her anus and vaginal canal. Ms.\n14 CORNEAU was released two days later and all charges against her were dismissed.  Defendants had\n15 no reasonable suspicion that a visual body cavity search would result in the discovery of contraband or\n16 weapons.\n17 E.   ALEXIS BRONSON\n18 24. On or about August 5, 2002, plaintiff ALEXIS BRONSON was arrested in San\n19 Francisco for allegedly being drunk in public and transported to San Francisco County Jail where he\n20 complied with Sheriff Deputy, Doe 21's directions to strip and submit to a visual body cavity search. \n21 Because he was allegedly not coughing loudly enough during the cavity search, five deputies, Does 22\n22 through 26, physically dragged him to a cold room where he was placed and kept naked for 12 hours\n23 with no food or water offered.   Defendants had no reasonable suspicion that a visual body cavity\n24 search would result in the discovery of contraband or weapons.  No charges were ever filed against\n25 plaintiff BRONSON.\n26\nPage 8 of 20\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.

On or about December 12, 2002, plaintiff MICKY MANGOSING was arrested for\n3 allegedly being drunk in public and transported to the San Francisco County Jail and placed in a\n4 holding cell.  Because she attempted to communicate with her friend who was also arrested about the\n5 whereabouts of her car keys, she was told to “shut up” by deputy Doe 27 and then forcibly removed\n6 from the holding cell, thrown down onto the ground and dragged to a cold room by three deputies,\n7 Does 28, 29 & 30, one of whom, defendant Doe 28, told her “take your clothes off bitch.”  Her\n8 clothes, including her bra and panties, were then torn off by defendants Does 28, 29 & 30 and she was\n9 left in the cold room for 12 hours, naked, without food, water or toilet paper, and regularly observed\n10 by a male deputy who kept looking in at her during her confinement.  Defendants had no reasonable\n11 suspicion that a visual body cavity search would result in the discovery of contraband or weapons.\n12 26. Ms. MANGOSING was released the following day and no charges were ever filed\n13 against her.\n14 G.   CHARLI JOHNSON\n15 27. On or about August 30, 2001, plaintiff CHARLI JOHNSON was arrested allegedly for\n16 public intoxication and transported to the San Francisco County Jail where she was stripped and\n17 subjected to a visual body cavity search by two male deputies, Does 31 and 32.  A full cavity search\n18 was conducted and her tampon was removed by defendant Deputies Does 31 an 32.  Ms. JOHNSON\n19 was confined in a cold room, naked, for approximately 12 hours and regularly viewed by male officers\n20 who looked in on her repeatedly.  She was released the next day at approximately noon and no charges\n21 were ever filed against her.  Defendants had no reasonable suspicion that a visual body cavity search\n22 would result in the discovery of contraband or weapons.\n23 H.   LEIGH FLEMING\n24 28. On or about April 11, 2003, plaintiff LEIGH FLEMING was arrested in San Francisco\n25 for allegedly disturbing the peace.  She was transported to the San Francisco County Jail, subjected to\n26 a visual body cavity search by deputy, defendant Doe 33, and then confined in a cold room for over\nPage 9 of 20\nMARY BULL, et al. v.

No charges were ever filed against Ms. FLEMING.  Defendants had no reasonable suspicion\n3 that a visual body cavity search would result in the discovery of contraband or weapons.\n4 I.   LAURA TIMBROOK\n5 29. On or about January 6, 2003, plaintiff LAURA TIMBROOK was arrested in San\n6 Francisco on an old warrant for writing checks with insufficient funds, and transported to the San\n7 Francisco County Jail where she was subjected to visual body cavity searches, twice, by deputies Does\n8 34 and 35, without reasonable suspicion that such searches would be productive of contraband or\n9 weapons.  Defendants had no reasonable suspicion that a visual body cavity search would result in the\n10 discovery of contraband or weapons.\n11 30. Within six months of her arrest, plaintiff MARY BULL filed a group government tort\n12 claim for herself and for all persons similarly situated (a copy of said claim is attached hereto as\n13 Exhibit A, and incorporated herein to the extent relevant by this reference).  Plaintiff BULL’s group\n14 claim was denied on or about April 7, 2003, allowing the filing of this Complaint.  \n15 31. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that defendants routinely follow\n16 their policy, practice, and custom of subjecting pre-arraignment detainees, including plaintiffs, to strip\n17 and visual body cavity searches without having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that\n18 the search will be productive of contraband or weapons.  \n19 32. Plaintiffs are further informed and believe, and thereon allege, that defendants routinely\n20 follow their policy, practice and custom of confining detainees, including plaintiffs, in “cold rooms” in\n21 order to compel compliance with illegal orders or as punishment.\n22 33. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that defendants have the ability\n23 to identify all such similarly situated plaintiffs, specifically those who, while in defendants’ custody, at\n24 the San Francisco Jail since February 10, 2000, were subjected to strip searches and/or visual body\n25 cavity searches prior to arraignment without defendants first having, and recording, a reasonable\n26 suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or weapons.\nPage 10 of 20\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 55      Filed 01/12/2004     Page 11 of 20\n1 34. Plaintiffs are further informed and believe, and thereon allege, that defendants have the\n2 ability to identify all such similarly situated plaintiffs whom defendants confined in “cold rooms”\n3 since February 10, 2000, as means to compel compliance with directives or as a punishment. \n4 35. Defendant SHERIFF MICHAEL HENNESSEY is personally responsible for the\n5 promulgation and continuation of the strip search policy, practice, and custom pursuant to which some\n6 of the plaintiffs herein were subjected to the searches complained of herein. \n7 36. Defendant SHERIFF MICHAEL HENNESSEY is also personally responsible for the\n8 promulgation and continuation of the cold room policy, practice, and custom pursuant to which some\n9 of the plaintiffs herein were confined in “cold rooms” as complained of herein.\n10 37. As a result of being subjected to the searches complained of herein, each of the\n11 plaintiffs suffered physical, mental, and emotional distress, invasion of privacy, and violation of due\n12 process of law and state and federal statutory and constitutional rights, and is entitled to recover\n13 damages according to proof, but, at a minimum, $1,000 as specified in California Penal Code §\n14 4030(p) and $4,000 as specified in California Civil Code § 52 and § 52.1(b).\n15 38.  As a result of being placed in a “cold room” as complained of herein, each of the\n16 plaintiffs suffered physical, mental, and emotional distress and violation of due process of law and\n17 state and federal statutory and constitutional rights, and is entitled to recover damages according to\n18 proof, but, a minimum, $4,000 as specified in California Civil Code § 52 and § 52.1(b).\n19 CLASS CLAIMS\n20 39. The strip and visual body cavity searches to which plaintiffs were subjected were\n21 performed pursuant to policies, practices, and customs of defendants SHERIFF HENNESSEY, CITY\n22 AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT, CITY AND COUNTY OF\n23 SAN FRANCISCO, and the individual deputies sued herein by the fictitious names 1 through 150 \n24 The searches complained of herein were performed without regard to the nature of the alleged offense\n25 for which plaintiffs had been arrested, without regard to whether or not plaintiffs were eligible for cite\n26 and release under Penal Code § 853.6, without regard to whether or not plaintiffs were eligible for\nPage 11 of 20\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 55      Filed 01/12/2004     Page 12 of 20\n1 and/or were released on their own recognizance.  Furthermore, the searches complained of herein were\n2 performed without defendants having a reasonable belief that the plaintiffs so searched possessed\n3 weapons or contraband, or that there existed facts supporting a reasonable belief that the searches\n4 would produce contraband, and those facts being articulated and recorded in a supervisor-approved\n5 document. \n6 40. Defendants’ use of the “cold room” to compel compliance from, and/or to punish\n7 plaintiffs is in violation of Sections 1055 and 1083 of Title 15 of the California Code of Regulations\n8 (promulgated under the authority of California Penal Code section 6030) and the State and Federal\n9 Constitutions, in that defendants confine people to “cold rooms” to punish them and/or to compel\n10 compliance with directives.  Furthermore, defendants’ practice of placing people in the cold room\n11 naked is a violation of Section 1055, supra, and of plaintiffs’ rights to due process of law.\n12 41. Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf and on behalf of all persons similarly\n13 situated pursuant to Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and California Code of Civil Procedure\n14 § 382.  \n15 42. The class is defined to include all persons who, in the period from and including\n16 February 10, 2000, to the present and continuing until this matter is adjudicated and the practices\n17 complained of herein cease, were arrested and subjected to a pre-arraignment strip and/or visual body\n18 cavity search at the San Francisco Jail without defendants having, and recording, a reasonable\n19 suspicion that the search would be productive of contraband or weapons.\n20 43. The class also includes all persons during the period from and including February 10,\n21 2000, to the present and continuing until this matter is adjudicated and/or the practices complained of\n22 herein cease, whom defendants improperly and unjustifiably confined in a cold room at the San\n23 Francisco Jail as a punishment and/or to compel compliance with a directive. \n24 44. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the members of the\n25 class are so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical.  Plaintiffs do not know the exact\n26 number of class members.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that there are\nPage 12 of 20\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 55      Filed 01/12/2004     Page 13 of 20\n1 more than 100 persons per day who are arrested by defendants and/or in the custody of defendants and\n2 subjected to the searches complained of herein as a result of defendants’ policy, practice, and custom\n3 relating to said searches.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants\n4 improperly and unjustifiably confine more than 10 persons per day in cold rooms as punishment or to\n5 compel compliance with directives.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and therefore allege, that\n6 there are tens of thousands of persons in the proposed class.\n7 45. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiffs are\n8 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that there are many questions of fact common to the class\n9 including, but not limited to: (1) whether defendants routinely subject all persons arrested to visual\n10 body cavity searches prior to arraignment if they intend such persons to be housed in a San Francisco\n11 County Jail; (2) whether persons are subjected to visual body cavity searches prior to arraignment\n12 without there being any reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to believe any\n13 particular arrestee has concealed drugs, weapons, and/or contraband in bodily cavities which could be\n14 detected by means of a visual body cavity search; (3) whether the visual body cavity searches are\n15 conducted in an area of privacy so that the searches cannot be observed by persons not participating in\n16 the searches, or whether the visual body cavity searches are conducted in groups and/or in open areas\n17 where they may be observed by persons not participating in the searches; and, (4) whether the visual\n18 body cavity searches are reasonably related to defendants’ penological interest to maintain the security\n19 of the jail and whether or not there are less intrusive methods for protecting any such interest. \n20 46.  Plaintiffs are also informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that other common\n21 questions of fact concern the design, temperature,  upkeep, and use of the “cold rooms,” including, but\n22 not limited to: (1) whether the “cold rooms” are used to punish persons in defendants’ custody; (2)\n23 whether defendants properly monitor people placed in the “cold rooms”; (3) whether defendants\n24 routinely fail to provide people placed in the “cold rooms” with sufficient clothing to protect those\n25 persons’ privacy; and, (4) whether defendants routinely fail to provide people confined in the “cold\n26 rooms” with bedding.\nPage 13 of 20\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 55      Filed 01/12/2004     Page 14 of 20\n1 47. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiffs are\n2 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that there are many questions of law common to the class\n3 including, but are not limited to: (1) whether defendants may perform visual body cavity searches on\n4 persons prior to their arraignment without reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts,\n5 to believe any particular inmate has concealed drugs, weapons and/or contraband which would likely\n6 be discovered by a visual body cavity search; (2) whether defendants may perform visual body cavity\n7 searches on persons without first reasonably relating the use of the visual body cavity search to\n8 defendants’ penological interest to maintain the security of the jail and determining if there is a less\n9 intrusive method to protect that interest; (3) whether visual body cavity searches may be conducted in\n10 areas where the search can be observed by people not participating in the search without violating\n11 plaintiffs’ State and Federal constitutional rights and the protections afforded to plaintiffs under\n12 California Penal Code section 4030; and, (4) whether or not defendants’ strip search policy and\n13 procedure is in accordance with the State and/or Federal Constitution.\n14 48. Plaintiffs are also informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that other common\n15 questions of law concern the nature, conditions, and temperature of the “cold rooms,” including, but\n16 not limited to: (1) whether defendants may use the cold rooms in the San Francisco County Jails for\n17 any reasons other than those stated in the Section 1055 of Title 15 of the California Code of\n18 Regulations without violating plaintiffs’ State and Federal constitutional rights protected by the Fourth\n19 and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and 42 U.S.C. § 1983; (2) whether or\n20 not defendants’ “cold room” policies, practices, and customs are in accordance with the Constitution\n21 and laws of the State of California and/or the United States of America; and (3) whether or not\n22 defendants have established and implemented written plans as directed by Section 1050 of Title 15 of\n23 the California Code of Regulations (promulgated in under the authority of California Penal Code\n24 section 6030).\n25 49. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the claims of the\n26 representative plaintiffs are typical of the class.  Plaintiffs were searched, prior to arraignment, without\nPage 14 of 20\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 55      Filed 01/12/2004     Page 15 of 20\n1 reasonable suspicion that a strip or visual body cavity search would produce drugs, weapons or\n2 contraband (and without the facts supporting any such suspicion being articulated in a supervisor-\n3 approved writing), and plaintiff BULL was placed in a “cold room,” without sufficient clothing to\n4 protect her privacy, as punishment for her refusal to consent to a visual body cavity search. \n5 Representative plaintiffs have the same interests and suffered the same type of injuries as all of the\n6 class members.  Plaintiffs’ claims arose because of defendants’ policy, practice, and custom of\n7 subjecting arrestees to strip and/or visual body cavity searches before arraignment without having, and\n8 recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the search would be productive of contraband or\n9 weapons.  Additionally, plaintiff BULL, in accordance with defendants’ policy, practice, and custom\n10 was improperly and unjustifiably confined in a “cold room” as punishment after defendants used the\n11 threat of such confinement unsuccessfully to coerce plaintiff to comply with their directives. \n12 Plaintiffs’ claims are based upon the same legal theories as the claims of the class members.  Each\n13 class member suffered actual damages either as a result of being subjected to a visual body cavity\n14 search and/or as a result of being improperly and unjustifiably placed and confined in a “cold room.” \n15 The actual damages suffered by representative plaintiffs are similar in type and amount to the actual\n16 damages suffered by each class member.  \n17 50. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the representative\n18 plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the class interests.  Plaintiffs’ interests are consistent with\n19 and not antagonistic to the interests of the class.  \n20 51. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(A), prosecutions of\n21 separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk that inconsistent or varying\n22 adjudications with respect to individual members of the class would establish incompatible standards\n23 of conduct for the parties opposing the class.  \n24 52. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(B), prosecutions of\n25 separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk of inconsistent adjudications\n26\nPage 15 of 20\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 55      Filed 01/12/2004     Page 16 of 20\n1 with respect to individual members of the class which would, as a practical matter, substantially\n2 impair or impede the interests of the other members of the class to protect their interests.\n3 53. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(2), plaintiffs are\n4 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants have acted on grounds generally\n5 applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate the final injunctive or declaratory relief with\n6 respect to the class as a whole.  \n7 54. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), this class action is\n8 superior to other available methods for the fair and equitable adjudication of the controversy between\n9 the parties.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the interests of members of\n10 the class in individually controlling the prosecution of a separate action is low, in that most class\n11 members would be unable individually to prosecute any action at all.  Plaintiffs are informed and\n12 believe, and thereupon allege, that the amounts at stake for individuals are so small that separate suits\n13 would be impracticable.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that most members\n14 of the class will not be able to find counsel to represent them.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and\n15 thereupon allege, that it is desirable to concentrate all litigation in one forum because all of the claims\n16 arise in the same location; i.e., the CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO.  It will promote\n17 judicial efficiency to resolve the common questions of law and fact in one forum, rather than in\n18 multiple courts.  \n19 55. Plaintiffs do not know the identities of all of the class members.  Plaintiffs are informed\n20 and believe, and thereupon allege, that the identities of the class members may be ascertained from\n21 records maintained by the CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO and defendant SHERIFF\n22 MICHAEL HENNESSEY and defendant CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO SHERIFF’S\n23 DEPARTMENT.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants’ records\n24 reflect the identities, including addresses and telephone numbers, of the persons who have been held in\n25 custody in the San Francisco Jails.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that\n26 records of, and maintained by defendants reflect who was subject to a strip and/or visual body cavity\nPage 16 of 20\nMARY BULL, et al. v.

Plaintiffs are\n7 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that all of the foregoing information is contained in\n8 defendants’ computer system and that the information necessary to identify the class members, by last\n9 known addresses, and the dates and reasons for their arrests and/or release from custody, is readily\n10 available from said computer system.  \n11 56. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), class members\n12 must be furnished with the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including individual notice\n13 to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe,\n14 and thereupon allege, that defendants’ computer records contain a last known address for class\n15 members.  Plaintiffs contemplate that individual notice will be given to class members at such last\n16 known address by first class mail.  Plaintiffs contemplate that the notice will inform class members of\n17 the following:\n18 i. The pendency of the class action and the issues common to the class;\n19 ii. The nature of the action;\n20 iii. Their right to “opt out” of the action within a given time, in which event they\n21 will not be bound by a decision rendered in the class action;\n22 iv.

Plaintiffs seek to enjoin polices that are no longer in effect.  On January 21, 2004, the\n4 Sheriff enacted new search and safety cell policies that supercede the policies challenged by\n5 plaintiffs in their complaint.  Plaintiffs were informed weeks in advance that the Sheriff intended\n6 to enact new policies.  They declined the opportunity to review the new policies before they were\n7 promulgated and instead rushed to file their preliminary injunction motion on the very day the\n8 new policies took effect.  Then, even though they had over a month to file an amended motion\n9 for preliminary injunction that could have been heard on April 8 and would have addressed the\n10 new policies, they did nothing.  A fair inference is that plaintiffs have no objection to the new\n11 search and safety cell policies and concede that they comply with federal and state law.\n12 Plaintiffs may have tactical reasons for doggedly continuing to pursue their motion for\n13 preliminary injunction.  But the motion is not reasonably directed toward protecting them from\n14 future harm.  Plaintiffs are not currently in custody in the San Francisco jails and, if at some\n15 point one of them is rearrested, she or he will be subject to the new search and safety cell\n16 policies.  Plaintiffs' motion therefore should be denied.  It is moot and plaintiffs cannot show any\n17 threat of irreparable injury.  Plaintiffs also cannot demonstrate a likelihood of success on the\n18 merits.  The new search and safety cell policies comply with the law and plaintiffs do not\n19 challenge the new policies.  Finally, plaintiffs' proposed expansions of the policies are simply an\n20 effort to substitute their personal, and unsupported, policy preferences for the Sheriff's\n21 discretionary judgment.  But the Sheriff, not plaintiffs, is authorized by law to set policy in the\n22 jails.\n23  STATEMENT OF FACTS\n24\nI.  THE SHERIFF HAS ABANDONED THE OLD POLICIES GOVERNING\nSEARCHES AND THE USE OF SAFETY CELLS AND ENACTED NEW\n25\nPOLLICIES THAT MOOT THE ISSUES RAISED IN PLAINTIFFS'\nCOMPLAINT\n26\n27 On January 21, 2004, Sheriff Hennessey issued revised polices governing \"Searches\"\n28 (See Exhibit A to the Declaration of Sheriff Hennessey (\"Hennessey Decl.\") and \"Safety Cell\nOPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIM. INJ. 1 N:\\LIT\\LI2004\\031697\\00230684.DOC\nCASE NO.

These new policies supersede and replace the old\n2 policies on the same subjects.  (See Hennessey Decl., ¶¶1-4.)\n3 The new Search and Safety Cell policies were the result of many weeks of work by the\n4 Sheriff and his staff.  (Declaration of Undersheriff Jan Dempsey (\"Dempsey Decl.\"), ¶4-19.)\n5 Plaintiffs' counsel was informed in writing on January 7, 9 and 16, 2004, and orally in mid-\n6 December 2003, at least four weeks before the new policies were issued, that the Sheriff\n7 intended to issue new policies that would address plaintiffs' concerns.  (See Exhibits J, K and L\n8 to the Declaration of Ingrid Evans (\"Evans Decl.\"), ¶2.)  Plaintiffs' counsel was offered an\n9 opportunity to review the policies prior to enactment.  (Id.)  Counsel declined to take advantage\n10 of this opportunity.  (Id.¸¶3.)  Instead, they rushed to file this motion on the very day that they\n11 knew the Sheriff would be issuing the new policies.  (Id.)\n12 The following is a summary of the relevant sections of the new “Searches” and “Safety\n13 Cell Use” policies:\n14 A.  The New Search Policy\n15 A. Prior to Intake/Booking\n16 1. A prisoner may be strip searched prior to booking only if:\n17 a. There is reasonable suspicion and supervisor approval on the Strip Search\n18 Authorization Form prior to the search; or\n19 b. Supervisor approval is not required if the prisoner:\n20 1. Is charged with a crime of drugs (except when arrested for violation of Health and\n21 Safety Code 11550 only), weapons and/or violence; or\n22 2. Has been convicted or arrested within the last 5 years for drugs, (except when\n23 arrested for violation of Health and Safety Code 11550 only), weapons and/or violence, as\n24 documented in the criminal history information system.\n25 3. Is charged under California Penal Code Section 3056 or booked with a State\n26 Parole Hold; or\n27 4. Is charged under California Penal Code Section 1203.2; or\n28\nOPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIM.

Is in the custody of another agency and is booked into the jail for safekeeping,\n2 including a prisoner booked on a U.S. Marshall hold.\n3 B. At Intake/Booking\n4 1. Prisoners may be strip searched at the time of booking only if:\n5 a. There is articulable reasonable suspicion and supervisor approval on the Strip\n6 Search Authorization Form prior to the search; or\n7 b. The prisoner is:\n8 1. Is charged with a crime of drugs (except when arrested for violation of Health and\n9 Safety Code 11550 only), weapons and/or violence; or\n10 2. Has been convicted or arrested within the last 5 years for drugs (except when\n11 arrested for violation of Health and Safety Code 11550 only), weapons and/or violence, as\n12 documented in the criminal history information system; or\n13 3. Is charged under California Penal Code Section 3056 or booked with a State\n14 Parole hold; or\n15 4. Is charged under California Penal Code Section 1203.2; or\n16 5. Is in the custody of another agency and is booked into the jail for safekeeping,\n17 including a prisoner booked on a U.S. Marshall hold.\n18 After intake and booking and before sentencing, the new policy permits strip searches\n19 only if: (1) there is reasonable suspicion; (2) the inmate was initially eligible for strip search at\n20 intake and there is a legitimate reason (such as a security search of the inmates housing unit) to\n21 conduct another search; (3) the inmate has been found to possess contraband during a prior\n22 search; or (4) the inmate is returning from a work detail, a court-ordered pass, a hospital visit,\n23 court appearance, or has had contact visits.  There is no longer a policy of strip searching all\n24 detainees who are classified, dressed in orange jail clothes, and transferred from intake to a\n25 housing facility in the San Francisco County Jail system.\n26 B.  The New Safety Cell Policy\n27 The \"General\" portion of the new Safety Cell policy limits the use of safety cells to\n28 specific situations:\nOPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIM. INJ. 3 N:\\LIT\\LI2004\\031697\\00230684.DOC\nCASE NO. C03-1480 CRB\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 125     Filed 03/19/2004     Page 8 of 27(cid:10)\n1 B. Safety cells may be used only under the following circumstances:\n2 1. When a prisoner is physically combative or otherwise presents an imminent\n3 danger to others.\n4 2. When a prisoner is a danger to self, as determined by actions or words, including,\n5 but not limited to, physical or mental impairment to the point of falling down, banging his/her\n6 head against the wall, making suicidal gestures or threatening to commit suicide.\n7 C. The safety cell shall not be used for prisoners who only refuse to be strip-searched\n8 or refuse other orders and do not otherwise meet the criteria for safety cell placement above.\n9 D. Only Jail Psychiatric Services may determine a prisoner to be gravely disabled.\n10 E. In no case shall the safety cell be used for punishment or as a substitute for\n11 treatment.\n12 The new policy for searching inmates who are to be placed is safety cells, or taking their\n13 clothing, states, in relevant part:\n14 F. The reason for the safety cell placement will determine whether the prisoner is\n15 stripped of clothing.\n16 1. In safety cell placements that result because the prisoner is a danger to self or at\n17 his/her request, the prisoner will be required to remove all clothing and a strip search will be\n18 conducted to ensure the prisoner does not have contraband that poses a threat to his/her safety.\n19 The prisoner will immediately be given a safety cell garment and/or safety cell blanket.\n20 2. In safety cell placements that result because a prisoner is a danger to others, the\n21 prisoner will be pat searched before being placed in the safety cell.  Clothing will not be removed\n22 nor will a strip search be conducted unless the supervisor approving the placement can articulate\n23 reasonable suspicion that the prisoner has contraband hidden that poses a risk to prisoners, staff,\n24 or self.\n25 II.  THE NEW POLICIES REFLECT CAREFUL AND APPROPRIATE BALANCE\nBETWEEN THE RIGHTS OF PRISONERS AND THE SECURITY NEEDS OF\n26 THE JAILS\n27 The new policies are the product of an extensive review of the former policies and are\n28 intended to better address the balance between institutional security and current legal\nOPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIM.

Setting policies for the county jails is a complex task\n2 that requires the expertise and experience of persons knowledgeable about jail administration and\n3 the specific needs of the San Francisco County jails as well as the current state of the law. (Id.)\n4 Both the old and new policies balance concerns with protecting the individual rights of the\n5 inmates with the critical need to prevent the introduction of drugs, weapons, and other\n6 contraband into the jail. (Id., ¶¶8-10.)\n7 Drugs and weapons are regularly found on inmates during routine strip searches.  (See\n8 Id., 11-12 and Exhibits 3 and 4 to Dempsey Decl.) The new search policy provides more\n9 restrictive authority to search inmates and will lead to a higher incidence of illegal contraband in\n10 the jails. (See Dempsey Decl., ¶12.)  Therefore, in order to implement the new policy,\n11 Undersheriff Dempsey was required to participate in lengthy meet and confer sessions with the\n12 Deputy Sheriff’s Association1 to obtain its acceptance of the new policy.  (Id.)  The DSA is\n13 concerned about the safety issues involved in the new policy.  Their concerns are not speculative\n14 and are documented  in the summary of four years of contraband recovered by the Sheriff’s K-9\n15 dog unit.  (See Id., and Exhibit 7 to Dempsey Decl.)\n16 In addition to the problem of contraband in the jails, the new safety cell policy was also\n17 discussed with the DSA.  The Department maintains safety cells in the county jails for the\n18 temporary housing of inmates who pose a risk of harm to themselves or others. (Id.. ¶ 14.)  These\n19 are small locked rooms that have built-in toilets and are otherwise without furnishings. (Id.)\n20 Under the old safety cell policy, all inmates placed in a safety cell had their clothing\n21 removed for safety purposes.  (See Exhibit 3 to Dempsey Decl.)  The new policy allows inmates\n22 that are determined to be a danger to others to keep their clothing.  However, inmates that are\n23 determined to be a danger to themselves will have their clothing removed.  (See Exhibit 2 to\n24 Hennessey Decl.)  As a safety precaution it is very important that clothing be taken from persons\n25 placed in a safety cell because they are deemed to be a danger to self. (See Dempsey Decl., ¶17.)\n26\n                                                \n1 The DSA represents approximately 850 members who have a vested interest in the\n27\nsafety and security of the jail environment.\n28\nOPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIM.

(See Id. and Exhibit 6 to Dempsey Decl.)  Undersheriff Dempsey provided four\n3 examples in her declaration to demonstrate the need to remove an inmate’s clothing who is\n4 placed in a safety cell.  In summary, inmates in safety cells have used their underwear to attempt\n5 to hang themselves, used feminine hygiene products to attempt to kill themselves, and have\n6 hidden sharp objects and drug paraphernalia in their underwear.  (See Id.).\n7 III.  IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW POLICIES\n8 Sheriff Hennessey states under oath that he has abandoned the old search and safety cell\n9 policies and has no intention of reverting to the old policies.  (See Hennessey Decl., ¶¶ 1-4 and\n10 Dempsey Decl., ¶¶ 4-25.)  There are very significant costs and burdens associated with creating\n11 and implementing a new policy and ensuring that the deputies receive training in the new policy.\n12 (Dempsey Decl., ¶4-19.)  It is very time-consuming to review the old policies and draft proposed\n13 changes.  (Id., ¶ 8.)  As Undersheriff Dempsey explained in her declaration and as discussed\n14 above, drafts of the policies were circulated widely to jail supervisory staff and were the subject\n15 of numerous meetings and meet and confer sessions. (Id., ¶ 8.)  There is also a very significant\n16 expenditure of time to train the supervisory and line staff. (Id., ¶¶ 18-19.)  At the Sheriff’s\n17 direction, Undersheriff Dempsey ensured that 122 supervisors received three hours of training2\n18 on the new search and safety cell housing policies on January 27 and 29, 2004. (Id.)  Roughly\n19 450 deputy sheriffs received daily training notification on these same policies for approximately\n20 eight days. (Id.)  As a follow-up to instructional training, on February 13, a summary of the\n21 search and safety cell use policy revisions as a reference guide for all personnel.  (See Id. and\n22 Exhibit 7 to Dempsey Decl.)  In addition, a directive that summarized the new policies was also\n23 issued on December 24, 2003, before the new policies were finalized, in order to implement the\n24 policies before the holiday season.  (See Dempsey Decl., ¶ 9 and Exh. 8 to Dempsey Decl.)  The\n25\n                                                \n26\n2 The training of supervisors included a three-hour instruction block conducted by the\nCustody Division Chief.  The Chief went through the new policies line by line and the session\n27\nincluded time for questions and answers. (See Dempsey Decl., ¶¶18-19)\n28\nOPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIM.

PLAINTIFFS FAIL TO MEET THE TWO REQUISITES FOR PRELIMINARY\nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n5\n6 A party seeking preliminary injunction relief must show it is entitled to this extraordinary\n7 remedy.   Matthews v. National Collegiate Athletic Association, 79 F.Supp.2d 1199, 1202-03\n8 (E.D. WA 1999).  Plaintiffs are not entitled to an injunction unless they demonstrate: (1) the\n9 combination of probable success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable injury; or (2) the\n10 existence of  serious questions regarding the merits and the balance of hardships tip sharply in\n11 their favor.  Fund for Animals, Inc. v. Lujan, 962 F.2d 1391, 1400 (9th Cir. 1992)  The court must\n12 “identify the harms which a preliminary injunction might cause to defendants and…weigh these\n13 against plaintiff’s threatened injury.”  L.A. Memorial Coliseum v. National Football League, 634\n14 F.2d 1197, 1203 (9th Cir. 1980).  Plaintiffs cannot meet their burden.\n15 A.  Plaintiffs Have Not and Cannot Show Irreparable Injury\n16 Plaintiffs have failed to show that they will suffer irreparable injury.  Sheriff Hennessey\n17 has changed the policies about which plaintiffs complain.  Plaintiffs cannot be irreparably injured\n18 by conduct that is no longer occurring.  Moreover, none of the plaintiffs are currently in the\n19 custody of the San Francisco Sheriff's Department.  Even if plaintiffs are taken into custody in\n20 the future, they will be subject to the Sheriff's new policies, policies that are not at issue in this\n21 motion and that plaintiffs have not challenged.\n22\n1.  Plaintiffs Cannot Show Irreparable Injury Because The Sheriff Has\nAbandoned The Policies Challenged By Plaintiffs.\n23\n24 Where a plaintiff seeks an injunction against the allegedly indifferent actions of prison\n25 officials despite developments that postdate the pleadings, “the defendants may rely on such\n26 developments to establish that the inmate is not entitled to an injunction.” Farmer v. Brennan,\n27 511 U.S. 825, 846 (1994).   Similarly, the Prison Litigation Reform Act (18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(3))\n28 does not provide for relief beyond that “necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right of\nOPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIM. INJ. 7 N:\\LIT\\LI2004\\031697\\00230684.DOC\nCASE NO.

Soranno v. Clark County, 345 F.3d\n3 1117, 1119 (9th Cir. 2003) (claim moot because county amended ordinance at issue); Doty v.\n4 County of Lassen, 37 F.3d 540, 544 (9th Cir. 1994) (injunction improper where county was no\n5 longer using challenged jail); see also Tyler v. Black, 865 F.2d 181, 183 (8th Cir. 1989) (en banc)\n6 (issue of double-bunking of inmates moot where practice was ended after the lower court trial\n7 and before the rehearing en banc).  Additionally, in Buckhannon Board & Care Home, Inc. v.\n8 West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human Resources, 532 U.S. 598, 600-601 (2001), the\n9 Supreme Court dismissed Petitioner’s class action was mooted by a change in objectionable\n10 statutory requirements during the pendency of the case.  See also McClelland v. Gronwaldt, 155\n11 F.3d 507, 514 (5th Cir. 1998) (“it is axiomatic that ‘a request for injunctive relief remains live\n12 only so long as there is some present harm left to enjoin’”).\n13 Plaintiffs argue that the Court should not consider the changes in policy because the\n14 changes were made during the current litigation.  These voluntary changes, however, cannot\n15 simply be ignored.  The voluntary cessation of allegedly illegal conduct, whether or not in\n16 response to a lawsuit, renders a controversy moot.  White v. Lee, 227 F.3 1214, 1243 (9th Cir.\n17 2000); see also Lindquist v. Idaho State Board of Corrections, 776 F.2d 851, 854 (9th Cir. 1985)\n18 (good faith change in conditions of prison library facilities made after lawsuit began rendered\n19 issues moot); Ragsdale v. Turnock, 841 F.2d 1358, 1365 (7th Cir. 1988) (self-corrective action\n20 taken in a genuine effort to comply with current case law provides foundation for dismissal\n21 based on mootness); McCrary v. Poythress, 638 F.2d 1308, 1310 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 454\n22 U.S. 865 (1981) (defendants' abandonment of prior purportedly unauthorized conduct rendered\n23 case moot).\n24 The issue is not when or why defendants changed their policies.  The issue is whether the\n25 change is permanent and whether the challenged conduct will recur.  White, 227 F.3d  at 1243.\n26 In White, the Ninth Circuit held that a memorandum that changed the way HUD did\n27 investigations was permanent and therefore mooted plaintiff’s claims.  The fact that plaintiff's\n28 lawsuit was the catalyst for the change was irrelevant.  Id. at 1243.  Plaintiffs rely on Friends of\nOPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIM.

Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC) Inc., 528 U.S. 167 (2000), but that case\n2 is clearly distinguishable.  In that case, the Supreme Court addressed whether a government\n3 agency’s moratorium would moot an otherwise valid claim for injunctive relief.  It held that a\n4 moratorium, “by its terms was not permanent” and therefore did not moot a claim for injunctive\n5 relief.  Id. at 709.  The facts of this case are similar to those in White, not Friends of the Earth.\n6 The Sheriff has not simply suspended the application of the challenged policies.  He rescinded\n7 them entirely, unequivocally stated that he has no intention of reverting to the old policies, and\n8 incurred considerable time and expense to implement the new policies.  (Hennessey Decl., ¶¶ 2-\n9 4; see also Dempsey Decl., ¶¶ 4-25.)  There is no realistic possibility that the challenged conduct\n10 will recur.  This permanent change in policy is precisely the type of change that was at issue in\n11 White and defeats plaintiffs’ motion for injunction.\n12\n2.  Plaintiffs Lack Standing To Seek Injunctive Relief Because They Face\nNo Imminent Harm.\n13\n14 In lawsuits to force governmental compliance, plaintiffs bear the burden of establishing\n15 standing. Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 190.  Named plaintiffs asserting claims on behalf of a\n16 class must have either personally sustained or be in an immediate danger of sustaining a direct\n17 injury as a result of the challenged statute or official conduct. O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488,\n18 494 and 497 (1974) (injunctive relief would not be granted for future harm that resided on\n19 speculation and conjecture that the plaintiffs may repeat the actions which resulted in the harm).\n20 A plaintiff seeking injunctive relief must show he is \"'immediately in danger of sustaining some\n21 direct injury' as [a] result\" of the challenged conduct.  McConnell v. FEC, 124 S.Ct. 619, 708\n22 (2003) (quoting Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 US 95, 102 (1983)); Preiser v. Newkirk, 422 U.S.\n23 395, 403 (1975); Booth v. Churner, 532 U. S. 731, 735 (2001).  Most important, while a plaintiff\n24 may have a claim for damages based on the injury he already sustained, that plaintiff cannot\n25 obtain injunctive relief absent a showing of any real or immediate threat that the plaintiff will be\n26 wronged again.  Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 111 (1983).\n27 Here, the present harm is not only speculative but it also cannot be applied to plaintiffs,\n28 as they are not currently incarcerated.  The plaintiffs here may proceed with their individual\nOPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIM. INJ. 9 N:\\LIT\\LI2004\\031697\\00230684.DOC\nCASE NO.

See Smith v.\n2 Montgomery County, 573 F. Supp. 604, 608-09 (D.Md. 1983) (dissolving preliminary injunction\n3 prohibiting strip searches because class representative unlikely to be detained again).\n4 Named Plaintiff Mary Bull's threat to commit future acts of unlawful civil disobedience\n5 cannot create standing to seek injunctive relief.  Even if arrested again, she and the other named\n6 plaintiffs will not be subject to the policies that existed at the time of their initial arrests and that\n7 gave rise to this lawsuit.  Plaintiff Mary Bull’s vague claims that she plans to participate in non-\n8 specific, “future” protests in San Francisco do not meet the requirement of proving that it is\n9 sufficiently likely that she will be re-arrested.  (Bull Declaration, ¶¶ 19-20.)  As such, Plaintiff's\n10 \"some day\" plans to participate in additional protests in San Francisco are speculative, and do not\n11 meet the standards required for injunctive relief.  See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S.\n12 555, 564 (1992) (\"some day\" intentions did not meet the actual or imminent requirements for\n13 injunctive relief).\n14\nB.  Plaintiffs' Request Also Fails Because They Cannot Demonstrate a\nLikelihood of Success on the Merits.\n15\n16 Plaintiffs' motion independently fails because they are not likely to prevail on the merits.\n17 The Sheriff's new policies comply with state and federal law.  Moreover, plaintiffs do not limit\n18 their injunction to the requirements of applicable law.  Rather, plaintiffs also seek to impose\n19 additional obligations on the Sheriff that are unsupported by either the law or by expert opinion\n20 and that impermissibly tread on the Sheriff's discretion to set the policies in the jails.\n21 1.  Plaintiffs Have Not Challenged the New Policies\n22 The Sheriff enacted his new policies on January 21, 2004.  Plaintiffs had more than a\n23 month, until February 28, to file an amended motion for preliminary injunction that would be\n24 heard on April 9 and that addressed the new search and safety cell policies.  Plaintiffs did not file\n25 such a motion.  A fair inference is that plaintiffs have no objections to the new policies and that\n26 they concede that the policies comport with federal and state law.\n27\n28\nOPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIM.

The Sheriff's New Policies Comply With Federal and State Law.\n2\nDefendants have separately moved for a declaration that the new search and safety\n3 policies comply with federal and state law.  The discussion below (sections 2.3 through 3)3\n4\nrepeats the arguments in support of that motion, as the lawfulness of the new policies\n5\nindependently defeats plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction.\n6\nDefendants cannot be held liable for violations of the fourteenth amendment absent a\n7\nshowing that they were deliberately indifferent to the rights of inmates.  Redman v. County of\n8\nSan Diego, 942 F.2d 1435, 1443 (9th Cir. 1991) (en banc), cert. denied. 502 U.S. 1074, 112 S.Ct.\n9\n972 (1992); Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 1979 (1994).  This is a high\n10\nstandard -- plaintiffs must show that defendants were “so wanton or reckless with respect to the\n11\n‘unjustified infliction of harm,’” so as to have knowingly and willfully allowed the harm to\n12\noccur.  Redman v. County of San Diego, 942 F.2d at 1443.  Because inmates are in the Jail for\n13\nrelatively short periods of time while awaiting trial and sentencing, the constitutional\n14\nrequirements are less stringent than if it were a long-term facility.  Campbell v. Cauthron, 623\n15\nF.2d 503, 507 (8th Cir. 1980); see Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 686, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 2572\n16\n(1978).\n17 a.  The New Search Policy Is Valid Under Federal and State Law.\n18\nConditions for pre-trial detainees in the jail satisfy the Fourteenth Amendment unless\n19\nthey are intended as punishment.  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535.  If a particular condition is\n20\nreasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective, it does not, without more, amount to\n21\n“punishment.”  Id. at 539.  As the Supreme Court explained, “the effective management of the\n22\ndetention facility . . . is a valid objective that may justify imposition of conditions and\n23\nrestrictions of pretrial detention and dispel any inference that such restrictions are intended as\n24\npunishment.” Id. at 540.\n25\n26                                                 \n3 Sections 4 & 5 separately responds to the factual arguments plaintiffs make in support\n27\nof their motion.\n28\nOPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIM.

Id. at 547.\n3 “[T]he operation of our correctional facilities is peculiarly the province of the Legislative and\n4 Executive Branches of our Government, not the Judicial.”  Id. at 548 (citations omitted).\n5 Consistent with this deference, the Court has provided broad discretion to law enforcement\n6 agencies in determining the security needs of penal institutions.  See Bell, 441 U.S. 520.  The\n7 Bell Court found that “maintaining institutional security and preserving internal order and\n8 discipline are essential goals that may require limitation or retraction of the retained\n9 constitutional rights of both convicted prisoners and pretrial detainees.”  441 U.S. at 546\n10 (emphasis added).  To determine the Fourth Amendment reasonableness of an institution’s\n11 search policy, the Court balanced the need for the particular search against the attendant invasion\n12 of personal privacy.  Id. at 559.  The Court found that a blanket strip search policy in which pre-\n13 trial detainees were subjected to visual cavity searches after every contact visit with a person\n14 from outside the institution, even in the absence of suspicion that an individual inmate had\n15 received contraband from a visitor, was reasonable as “a detention facility is a unique place\n16 fraught with serious security dangers.  Smuggling of money, drugs, weapons, and other\n17 contraband is all too common an occurrence.”  Id.\n18 Since Bell, the Ninth Circuit has consistently held that the nature of the arrestee’s offense\n19 and his or her prior arrest record are critical to determining whether a strip search is\n20 constitutionally permissible.  In Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 617 (9th Cir. 1984), the Court\n21 held that, prior to a strip search of minor offenders, jail authorities must possess “reasonable\n22 suspicion that the individual arrestee is carrying or concealing contraband.”  The Court further\n23 held that this “reasonable suspicion may be based on such factors as the nature of the offense, the\n24 arrestee’s appearance and conduct, and the prior arrest record.”  Id. at 617.  In Thompson v. City\n25 of Los Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439 (9th Cir. 1989), the Court once again declared that the nature of\n26 the crime was critical in determining whether a strip search was permissible.  There the Court\n27 found that grand theft auto was sufficiently related to violence to justify a strip search prior to\n28 housing the plaintiff with other inmates.  Id. at 1447.

Los Angeles Police Department, 901 F.2d.\n2 702 (9th Cir. 1990), reiterated the reasonable suspicion standard for strip searches, noting that it\n3 “prudently invites the consideration of the nature of the crime charged in determining the\n4 constitutionality of an individual search” and emphasizing the holding in Giles that reasonable\n5 suspicion “may be based on such factors as the nature of the offense, the arrestee’s appearance\n6 and conduct, and the prior arrest record.”  Id. at 716.\n7 Giles, Thompson and Kennedy are consistent with out-of-circuit authority permitting strip\n8 searches of persons charged with violent crimes.  Following Bell v. Wolfish, the Sixth Circuit\n9 upheld the constitutionality of a strip search of an arrestee charged with felonious assault because\n10 it is a “class of crime of which violence is an element” and noted that the search was further\n11 justified by the fact that the inmate “would ultimately come into contact with the general jail\n12 population.”  Dufrin v. Spreen, 712 F.2d 1084, 1087 (6th Cir. 1983).  Similarly, that Court held\n13 that county jail officials had a legitimate security interest in strip searching an arrestee charged\n14 with “misdemeanor menacing” because that is a violent crime involving a person who\n15 “intentionally places another person in reasonable apprehension of imminent physical injury.”\n16 Further, menacing is associated with weapons and may well raise reasonable suspicion on part of\n17 jail officials that someone arrested on that charge may be concealing weapons or other\n18 contraband.  Dobrowolsky v. Jefferson County, 823 F.2d 955, 958-59 (6th Cir. 1987).\n19 Consistent with the controlling Ninth Circuit cases of Giles, Thompson, and Kennedy, the\n20 current search policy permits strip searches of detainees upon a finding of reasonable suspicion\n21 or when they have been arrested within the past five years for crimes involving drugs, weapons\n22 or violence.\n23 Under these cases the new search policy is valid.  The search policy enacted on\n24 January 21, 2004, allows strip searches to be conducted only for inmates charged with drugs,\n25 weapons or violence, with a criminal history of drugs, weapons or violence, on active parole or\n26 probation, being held at the behest of another agency or where there is documented reasonable\n27 suspicion that contraband may be present.\n28\nOPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIM.

These\n3 prisoners have, by definition, already been arraigned, convicted and sentenced and are being\n4 returned to jail because they have violated the conditions of their release.  Several factors make\n5 strip searches of these prisoners constitutional.  Probation and parole violators are ineligible for\n6 citation and release, release on their own recognizance, or bail.  They know that they are facing\n7 more likely and longer periods of incarceration and therefore would have a greater incentive to\n8 attempt to introduce contraband into the jail. Giles, 746 F.2d at 617 (noting that the strip search\n9 policy in Wolfish was justified in part because inmates were “detained for substantial pretrial\n10 periods”).\n11 Further, parolee and probationers must agree as a condition of release to submit to certain\n12 law enforcement searches.  They therefore have a diminished expectation of privacy.  They are\n13 also “more likely than the ordinary citizen to violate the law.”  United States v. Knights, 534 U.S.\n14 112, 122 S.Ct. 587, 590 (2001).  The reasonableness of a search under the Fourth Amendment is\n15 determined by assessing, on the one hand, the degree to which it intrudes upon an individual’s\n16 privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed to promote legitimate governmental\n17 interests.  An arrestee’s “status as a probationer subject to a search condition informs both sides\n18 of that balance.”  Id., 122 S. Ct. at 588.  Such convicted and sentenced prisoners who have\n19 violated their conditions of release may permissibly be strip searched when they are returned to\n20 jail, just as other inmates who are returning from outside the facility.\n21 The Sheriff’s Department policy permits a strip search of inmates after intake only with\n22 reasonable suspicion or in three narrowly defined circumstances.  In most cases, reasonable\n23 suspicion and a supervisor’s prior approval is required.  But a pre-sentenced inmate may also be\n24 strip searched without reasonable suspicion: (1) during a security search, but only if that prisoner\n25 met the requirement for being strip searched at intake; (2) if the prisoner has been found with\n26 contraband during prior searches; or (3) is returning from a work detail, court ordered pass, a\n27 hospital appointment, court appearance, contact visits, interviews, or other activities outside their\n28\nOPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIM.

A security search for contraband is one that is focused on one part or area\n2 of the jail (e.g., a cell, a dormitory or a pod).  See Search Policy II.C.2.a.\n3 These searches are permissible based on the security needs of the prison.  Deterrence of\n4 smuggling requires the ability to conduct security searches of housing units – either on a random\n5 basis or on the basis of information that weapons or drugs have been secreted in a particular cell\n6 or area of the jail. (See Exhibits 6,7 and 10 to Dempsey Decl., ¶¶ 4-22.)     Pre-sentenced\n7 prisoners will only be subject to a strip search during a security search if they were eligible for a\n8 strip search at intake – i.e., they were arrested for or had a history of drugs, weapons or violence\n9 offenses.  Jail officials also need to deter known smugglers of contraband – i.e., those who have\n10 previously been found with drugs or weapons – with the ability to conduct a search in the\n11 absence of reasonable suspicion.  Finally, as stated above, Bell v. Wolfish permits searches of\n12 pre-trial detainees following their contacts with outsiders, as when returning from work details or\n13 hospital visits.\n14 b.  The New Search Policy Comports With California Law.\n15 California Penal Code § 4030 provides additional state-law guidance regarding strip\n16 searches of detainees held for infraction or misdemeanor offenses before being placed in the\n17 general jail population.  Before a prisoner is classified and transferred to a housing unit, section\n18 4030(f) allows the Sheriff’s Department to strip search misdemeanor and infraction arrestees\n19 only when reasonable suspicion exists that the inmate is concealing a weapon or contraband or\n20 when the detainee was arrested for a crime involving drugs, weapons or violence.  The Sheriff’s\n21 Department’s revised strip search policy complies with Section 4030 because it does not provide\n22 for intake strip searches under any other circumstances. 4\n                                                \n23\n4 Plaintiff's reliance on the holding of a Massachusetts district court case is unpersuasive.\nThe facts in Mack v. Suffolk County, 191 F.R.D. 16 (D. Mass 2000) refer to a blanket strip search\n24\npolicy where \"every single female pre-arraignment detainee was required to be strip-searched\"\nregardless if the crime was for a felony or misdemeanor. Id. at 17 (emphasis added).  The old\n25\npolicy adopted August 20, 1999 which is at controversy, did not rise to this level of a \"blanket\npolicy\", and represented the Defendant's good faith efforts to comply with the legal requirements\n26\nknown to the Department at that time.  (See Dempsey Decl., ¶¶ 4-12).  In addition, the San\nFrancisco Sheriff's Department abandoned this policy on January 21, 2004.  (See Hennessey\n27\nDecl.,¶¶ 1-4).\n28\nOPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIM. INJ. 15 N:\\LIT\\LI2004\\031697\\00230684.DOC\nCASE NO.

The New Safety Cell Policy Satisfies Federal and State  Law.\n2 Safety cells are used to confine inmates who pose a danger to themselves or others.  As\n3 the Ninth Circuit noted, “[p]rison officials have to have some means of controlling violent or\n4 self-destructive inmates temporarily until the episode passes … it is difficult to distinguish\n5 between violent, mentally healthy inmates and violent, mentally disturbed ones.”  Anderson v.\n6 County of Kern, 45 F.3d at 1310, 1315 (9th Cir. 1995).  Accordingly, although Sheriff’s\n7 Department staff rely on the assistance of medical and psychiatric professionals in evaluating\n8 safety cell placements, the state regulatory law grants the Sheriff the authority to determine when\n9 safety cell placements are necessary to control violent or self-destructive inmates.    (See\n10 Dempsey Decl., ¶¶13-17, 20-25).\n11 The Department’s revised safety cell policy also complies with Section 1055 of Title 15\n12 of the California Code of Regulations, entitled “Use of Safety Cell,” which permits the use of a\n13 safety cell for inmates who destroy property or who pose a danger to themselves or others.  Cal.\n14 Code Regs. Title 15, § 1055 (2003).  Section 1055 sets forth specific guiding principles that jails\n15 must follow, but leaves the development of specific written policies governing safety cell use to\n16 jail administrators.5  Not only does the Sheriff’s Department’s current safety cell policy comply\n17 with the restrictions set forth in section 1055, but it restricts the use of safety cells in the San\n18 Francisco County Jails more than state law mandates.\n19 With the exception of when a prisoner requests a safety cell placement or Jail Health\n20 Services recommends such placement, the Sheriff’s Department’s safety cell policy allows the\n21 safety cell to be used only when an inmate imminently threatens to cause physical injury to\n22 himself or others.  Although Section 1055 allows the safety cell to be used to hold those inmates\n23 who display behavior which results in the destruction of property, current San Francisco policy is\n24 more limited.  It only allows the safety cell to be used for behavior resulting in property\n25 destruction that could result in harm to the inmate or another.  In conformance with Section\n                                                \n26\n5 “The facility administrator, in cooperation with the responsible physician, shall develop\nwritten policies and procedures governing safety cell use and may delegate authority to place an\n27\ninmate in a safety cell to a physician.”  Cal. Code Regs. Title. 15, § 1055 (2003).\n28\nOPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIM. INJ. 16 N:\\LIT\\LI2004\\031697\\00230684.DOC\nCASE NO.

Federal law demonstrates the need for jail\n6 administrators to ensure the safety of the inmate as well as others in the jail.  To be sure, cases\n7 abound in which jail officials have been sued for failing to prevent detainees from harming\n8 themselves when in custody.  Sibley v. Lemaire, 184 F.3d 481, 483-86 (5th Cir. 1999) (plaintiff\n9 sued institution for failure to take actions to prevent plaintiff from suffering psychotic episode\n10 and injuring himself by removing his eyeballs); Yellow Horse v. Pennington County, 225 F.3d\n11 923, 925-26 (8th Cir. 2000) (plaintiff’s estate sued jail for failure to prevent suicide of decedent\n12 after he was taken off suicide watch); Frake v. City of Chicago, 210 F.3d 779, 780-81 (7th Cir.\n13 2000) (plaintiff filed a lawsuit against defendant city after his son, a pretrial detainee in\n14 defendant’s detention facility, hung himself in his cell).  In view of this case law, the Sheriff’s\n15 Department’s current safety cell policy allows limited strip searches, but only out of the need to\n16 prevent an inmate from inflicting harm upon himself.6\n17 The current safety cell policy further requires that:  (1) a prisoner shall be placed in a\n18 safety cell only with the approval of the facility commander, the facility watch commander, or\n19 the designated physician (Section I.A.); (2) staff must observe an inmate at least twice every\n20 thirty minutes and document this observation (Section III.C.1-3); (3) a medical assessment must\n21 be provided within thirty minutes after placement (although Section 1055 only requires that this\n22 be done within twelve hours) (Section II.K); (4) a Watch Commander must review the inmate’s\n23 retention in the housing cell every eight hours (Section IV.A); (5) medical and psychiatric\n24 clearance must be secured for continued retention within twenty-four hours of placement\n25 (Section IV.B&C); (6) necessary food and water be provided (Section III.D & E); (7) an inmate\n                                                \n26\n6 When an inmate poses an imminent threat to others, including staff, other inmates or\ncivilians, he will be placed in the safety cell but will not be strip searched unless there is a\n27\nreasonable suspicion that the prisoner has concealed contraband.\n28\nOPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIM. INJ. 17 N:\\LIT\\LI2004\\031697\\00230684.DOC\nCASE NO. C03-1480 CRB\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 125     Filed 03/19/2004     Page 22 of 27(cid:10)\n1 may not stay in the safety cell beyond twenty-four hours (although Section 1055 allows it,\n2 simply requiring medical clearance “for continued retention every twenty four hours” after the\n3 first medical assessment); (8) staff must maintain the safety cell’s cleanliness and provide\n4 inmates with basic sanitary needs (Sections III.F & G and Section V); and (9) detainees who are\n5 placed in safety cells must be provided a safety cell garment and/or blanket immediately after\n6 placement (Section G.1-2).\n7 These provisions demonstrate that the current safety cell policy fully complies with\n8 federal law and exceeds the requirements of state law set forth in Section 1055.  In addition,\n9 because safety cells may not be used for punishment, the safety cell policy does not violate\n10 federal protections and fully complies with Title 15, Section 1083(d) (stating “In no case shall a\n11 safety cell, as specified in title 24, section 2- 470A.2.5, or any restraint device be used for\n12 disciplinary purposes”).\n13 a.  Plaintiffs untimely effort to inject new claimants into this\nlawsuit must be rejected and the allegations of these new\n14 claimants cannot be considered in this motion.\n15 After plaintiffs filed their motion for preliminary injunction and the court set the briefing\n16 schedule, plaintiffs belatedly sought to file a second amended complaint adding six new named\n17 plaintiffs and adding new Roe class plaintiffs with new and different factual allegations.  The\n18 court has denied plaintiffs’ request to hear their motion to file a second amended complaint on\n19 shortened time.  Defendants obviously have had no opportunity to depose these new claimants or\n20 conduct other discovery related to their claims.  Fairness dictates that the Court should not\n21 consider these new claimants or their allegations.   Defendants hereby move to strike the\n22 declaration of Steve Noh, Michael Marron, and Michele De Ranleau.\n23 b.  Plaintiffs’ factual arguments in support of their motion are\nmisplaced – the Sheriff never had a policy of placing inmates in\n24 safety cells for punishment.\n25 Neither the old policy nor the new one has ever authorized the placement of an inmate in\n26 a safety cell for punishment or to force someone to comply with a strip search.  (See Dempsey\n27 Decl., ¶¶14-17, 20-25.)  The new safety cell policy complies with the requirements set forth in\n28 Title 15 §1055 et seq. and is constitutional.\nOPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIM.

For instance, plaintiffs cite the deposition of Mitch Marquez and imply that he has\n5 seen inmates naked in a safety cell in violation of their rights.  In actuality, Mr. Marquez testified\n6 that it was his understanding that only persons that were suicidal were not allowed to retain their\n7 clothes and he has seen such (suicidal) persons naked in a safety cell.  (Exh. A to Evans Decl. at\n8 page 31, lines 3-9, 11-18)  Further, Undersheriff Dempsey testified that when she learned that\n9 there had been isolated instances in the past where prisoners were not given safety garments, she\n10 immediately reminded facility commanders at their next meeting that inmates were to be given\n11 safety cell garments in a timely manner and, in no event, longer than 30 minutes.  (Exh. B to\n12 Evans Decl. at page 73, lines 17-23, page 74, lines 13-20). 7\n13 Lastly, the report prepared by Prison Legal Services analyzed all complaints that were\n14 made about the jail, regardless of whether or not they were true. While the report did state that on\n15 occasion persons had been placed in a safety cell for refusing to cooperate in a strip search, it did\n16 not state that this was the sole basis for safety cell placement of any one individual.  (Exh. D to\n17 Evans Decl. at page 26, lines 12-25.)   Deputy Humphrey corroborated that it was neither the\n18 policy nor practice to place inmates in a safety cell based only on the fact that they refused to\n19 consent to be strip searched.  (Exh. F to Evans Decl. at page 116, lines 10-15.)  In fact, in the\n20 case of named plaintiff Mary Bull, she was placed in a safety cell because she was determined to\n21 be gravely disabled, appeared to be a danger to others, refused to be searched, became\n                                                \n22\n7 Plaintiffs also misrepresent the testimony of Jail Psychiatric Services counselors Cotton\nand Chow and Sheriff Deputies Carson, Palencia and Humphrey.  Therapist Karen Cotton\n23\ntestified that in her opinion refusing to consent to a strip search could be considered “bizarre”\nbehavior.   (Exh. H to Evans Decl. at page 56, line 1 -  page 57, line 10.)  Deputy Carson\n24\nexplained the difference between a search for a safety cell placement and a strip search in her\ndeposition.  In no way did Deputy Carson’s testimony indicate, as plaintiffs attempt to imply,\n25\nthat every person placed in a safety cell has refused to consent to a strip search.  (Exh. C to\nEvans Decl. at page 17, lines 7- page 18, line 12).  Deputy Palencia testified that the prior policy\n26\nrequired the removal of inmates’ clothing before placement in a safety cell. He did not testify\nthat inmate’s body cavities are inspected.  (Exh. E to Evans Decl. at page 45, line 15 – 46,\n27\nline 4).\n28\nOPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIM.

(Exh. I to Evans Decl. (Safety Cell Housing Forms); and Exh. G to Evans Decl.\n3 at page 45, lines 12-25.)8  Likewise, the other plaintiffs9 that were placed in a safety cell were put\n4 there for proper reasons.   Plaintiff Alexis Bronson was placed in a safety cell because he was\n5 deemed to be a danger to others and had swung his arms at one of the Sheriff deputies.  (See\n6 Exhibit M to Evans Decl., ¶14.)   Plaintiff Leigh Fleming was arrested for resisting arrest and\n7 disturbing the peace.  Plaintiff Fleming was placed in a safety cell because she appeared to be a\n8 danger to others, for bizarre behavior that resulted in the destruction of property and she “was\n9 kicking and banging on door and window - refused to cooperate with ID processor.”  (See\n10 Exh. N to Evans Decl., ¶15.)  Plaintiff Deborah Flick was arrested because she was extremely\n11 intoxicated and attempting to drive her car.  Plaintiff Flick was placed in a safety cell because\n12 she was found to be gravely disabled and extremely intoxicated. (See Evans Decl., ¶19.)\n13 Plaintiff Miki Mangosing was arrested because she  was extremely intoxicated, fighting with bar\n14 patrons, screaming and yelling.  (See Evans Decl., ¶20.)\n15 II.  PLAINTIFFS' CANNOT SHOW THAT THEIR POLICY PREFERENCES\nSHOULD OVERRIDE THE SHERIFF'S LAWFUL EXERCISE OF\n16 DISCRETION.\n17 In addition to seeking to enjoin the old, superseded search and safety cell policies,\n18 plaintiffs' proposed injunction seeks to go much farther and impose additional limitations on the\n19 Sheriff's use of safety cells.  Specifically , plaintiffs ask this court to require that: (1) any safety\n20                                                 \n8 Steve Noh claims he was arrested and strip searched in County Jail 9 in San Francisco,\n21 San Francisco has no record of his arrest.  Further, Steve Noh is not a named plaintiff in the\nlawsuit, has not been deposed and plaintiffs have not produced any documents or proof of his\n22 arrest. The court should not consider his declaration or the declarations of Michael Marron or\nMichele De Ranleau, neither of whom are currently named plaintiffs in this lawsuit and no\n23 discovery has been provided related to these individuals. This motion is the first time that\ndefendants have heard mention of Steve Noh, Michael Marron, or Michele De Ranleau.\n24 Defendants object and move to strike their declarations, and ask the court not to consider them.\n25 9 Plaintiff Charli Johnson was arrested for outstanding warrants.  There is no record of\nher being placed in a safety cell at the San Francisco County Jail. (See Evans Decl., ¶17.)\n26 Plaintiff Laura Timbrook was arrested for outstanding arrest warrants and charged with burglary,\nforgery and intent to defraud.  There is no record of her being placed in a safety cell at the San\n27 Francisco County Jail.  (See Evans Decl., ¶18.)\n28\nOPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIM.

See Plaintiffs' Motion at 1.\n5 There are two fatal problems with plaintiffs' expanded injunction.  First, plaintiffs\n6 impermissibly seek to substitute their policy preferences for those of the Sheriff.  The Supreme\n7 Court grants broad discretion to law enforcement agencies in addressing the security needs of\n8 penal institutions. See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520.  The Prison Litigation Reform Act, also\n9 limits this Court’s jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief:\n10 Prospective relief in any civil action with respect to prison conditions shall\nextend no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal\n11 right of a particular plaintiff or plaintiffs.  The court shall not grant or\napprove any prospective relief unless the court finds that such relief is\n12 narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation\nof the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct\n13 the violation of the Federal right.  The court shall give substantial weight\nto any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of the criminal\n14 justice system caused by the relief.\n15 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A), (C).  The Act specifically covers local detention facilities such as\n16 jails, including those that house pretrial detainees.  18 U.S.C. § 3626(g) (3), (5).  It also applies\n17 specifically to class actions.  18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1).  The Act limits the authority of the Court to\n18 involve itself in municipal decision-making functions regarding the Jail.  See also Doty v. County\n19 of Lassen, 37 F.3d 540 (9th Cir. 1994), citing Hoptowit v. Ray, 682 F.2d 1237, 1246 (9th Cir.\n20 1982) (federal court's role is limited to correcting constitutional violations; courts have no role in\n21 formulation of prison policy).\n22 Together, these authorities require that this Court defer to the Sheriff in setting jail policy\n23 unless a policy clearly violates the law.\n24 Second, plaintiffs utterly fail to demonstrate that their proposed changes to jail policy are\n25 necessary to correct unlawful practices.  In fact, plaintiffs provide no legal or factual support at\n26 all for their position.  For example, they cite to no authority for the proposition that safety cell\n27 placements should only be made at the direction of a \"licensed professional\" and state\n28 regulations are to the contrary.  See California Code of Regulations Title 15, § 1055 (safety cell\nOPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIM. INJ. 21 N:\\LIT\\LI2004\\031697\\00230684.DOC\nCASE NO.

They also cite to no expert opinion or other evidence that would\n3 tend to support their demand that all safety cell placements be made by a \"licensed\n4 professional.\"10  Likewise, they cite no legal or evidentiary support for their assertion that\n5 inmates should not be strip searched before being placed in safety cells or that they should be\n6 permitted to keep their clothing.\n7 Plaintiffs' unsupported position is nothing more than a policy preference.  They are in\n8 effect asking this court to substitute their personal preferences for the carefully crafted policies\n9 that the Sheriff has developed and implemented.  This is exactly what Bell and the Prison\n10 Litigation Reform Act forbid.  Even more important, plaintiffs' proposed new policies are ill-\n11 conceived and dangerous.  As Undersheriff Dempsey explains in her unrefuted declaration, jails\n12 have safety cells in order to provide temporary housing for inmates who may harm themselves or\n13 others.  (Dempsey Decl., ¶ 14.)  It would expose inmates to unnecessary and inappropriate risk if\n14 they could not be placed into a safe environment until evaluated by a \"licensed professional.\"\n15 (Id., ¶ 22.)  And the policies that govern the searching of inmates before they are placed in safety\n16 cells, and whether inmates can keep their clothing, are essential to protect the inmates and others.\n17 (Id., ¶ 25.)  The Sheriff's first duty is to protect the safety of the inmates and the deputies. (Id.,\n18 ¶ 4, 10.)  Inmates who are bent on suicide must be carefully searched and monitored.  Even\n19 innocuous articles such as a tampon have been used by inmates to try to harm themselves. (Id.,\n20 ¶ 17.)  There is no room for error.  Plaintiffs' proposed policy revisions may be well intentioned,\n21 but they could result in unnecessary and preventable death and injury.\n22\n23\n24\n25 / / /\n26\n                                                \n10 Plaintiffs should not be permitted to introduce such evidence after the fact, in their\n27\nreply, and any such evidence should be disregarded as untimely.\n28\nOPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR PRELIM.

BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS  \nOF COUNTY OF BURLINGTON ET  AL.  \nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR \nTHE THIRD CIRCUIT  \nNo. 10–945.  Argued October 12, 2011—Decided April 2, 2012  \nPetitioner was arrested during a traffic  stop by a New Jersey state \ntrooper who checked a statewide computer database and found a \nbench warrant issued for petitioner’s arrest  after he failed to  appear \nat a hearing to enforce a fine.  He was initially detained in the Bur-\nlington County Detention Center and later in the Essex County Cor-\nrectional Facility, but was released once it was determined that the \nfine had been paid.  At the first jail, petitioner, like every incoming \ndetainee, had to shower with a delousing agent and was checked for \nscars, marks, gang tattoos, and contraband as he disrobed.  Petition-\ner claims  that  he also had to open his mouth, lift his tongue, hold out \nhis arms, turn around, and lift his genitals.  At the second jail, peti-\ntioner, like other arriving detainees, had to remove his clothing while \nan officer looked for body markings, wounds, and contraband; had an \nofficer look at his ears, nose, mouth, hair, scalp, fingers, hands, arm-\npits, and other body openings; had a mandatory shower; and had his \nclothes examined.  Petitioner claims that he was also required to lift \nhis genitals, turn around, and cough while squatting.  He filed a 42 \nU. S. C. §1983 action in the Federal District Court against the gov-\nernment entities that ran the jails and other defendants, alleging \nFourth and Fourteenth Amendment violations, and arguing that per-\nsons arrested for minor offenses cannot be subjected to invasive \nsearches unless prison officials have reason to suspect concealment of \nweapons, drugs, or other contraband.  The court granted him sum-\nmary judgment, ruling that “strip-searching” nonindictable offenders \nwithout reasonable suspicion violates the Fourth Amendment.  The \nThird Circuit  reversed.  \nHeld: The judgment is affirmed. \n \n\n2  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON   \nSyllabus   \n621 F. 3d 296, affirmed. \nJUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to \nPart IV, concluding that the search procedures at the county jails \nstruck a reasonable balance between  inmate privacy and the needs of \nthe institutions, and thus  the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments \ndo not require adoption of the framework and rules petitioner pro- \nposes.  Pp. 5−18, 19.  \n  (a) Maintaining safety and order at detention centers  requires the \nexpertise of correctional officials, who must have substantial discre-\ntion to devise reasonable solutions to problems.  A regulation imping-\ning on an inmate’s constitutional rights must be upheld “if it is rea-\nsonably related to legitimate penological interests.”  Turner v. Safley, \n482 U. S. 78, 89.  This Court, in  Bell v.  Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 558,  \nupheld a rule requiring pretrial detainees in federal correctional fa-\ncilities “to expose their body cavities for visual inspection as a part of \na strip search conducted after every contact visit with a  person from \noutside the institution[s],” deferring to the judgment of correctional \nofficials that the inspections served not only to discover but also to \ndeter the smuggling of weapons, drugs, and other prohibited items.  \nIn Block v. Rutherford, 468 U. S. 576, 586−587, the Court upheld a \ngeneral ban on contact visits in a county jail, noting the smuggling \nthreat posed by such visits and the difficulty of carving out exceptions \nfor certain detainees.  The Court, in Hudson  v. Palmer, 468 U. S. 517,  \n522−523, also recognized that deterring the possession of contraband \ndepends in part on the ability to conduct searches without predictable \nexceptions when it upheld the constitutionality of random searches of \ninmate lockers and cells even without suspicion that an inmate is \nconcealing a prohibited item.  These cases  establish that  correctional \nofficials must  be permitted to devise reasonable search policies to de-\ntect and deter the possession of contraband in their facilities, and \nthat “in the absence of substantial evidence in the record to indicate  \nthat the officials have exaggerated their response to these considera-\ntions courts should ordinarily defer to their expert judgment in such \nmatters,” Block, supra,  at 584–585.  \n  Persons arrested for minor offenses may be among the detainees to \nbe processed at jails.  See Atwater v.  Lago Vista, 532 U. S. 318, 354.   \nPp. 5−9. \n  (b) The question here is whether undoubted security imperatives \ninvolved in jail supervision override the assertion that some detain-\nees must be exempt from the invasive search procedures at issue ab-\nsent reasonable suspicion of a concealed weapon or other contraband.  \nCorrectional officials have a significant interest in conducting  a thor-\nough search as a standard part of the intake process.  The admission  \nof new inmates creates risks for staff, the existing detainee popula-\n \n\n  Cite as:  566 U. S. ____ (2012)  3 \n \nSyllabus  \ntion, and the new detainees themselves.  Officials therefore must \nscreen for contagious infections and for wounds or injuries requiring \nimmediate medical attention.  It may be difficult to identify and treat \nmedical problems until detainees remove their clothes for a visual in-\nspection.  Jails and prisons also face potential gang violence, giving \nthem reasonable justification for a visual inspection of detainees for \nsigns of gang affiliation as  part of the intake process.  Additionally, \ncorrectional  officials  have  to  detect  weapons,  drugs,  alcohol,  and \nother prohibited items new detainees may possess.  Drugs can make \ninmates aggressive  toward officers  or each other, and drug trading \ncan lead to violent confrontations.  Contraband has value in a jail’s  \nculture and underground economy, and competition for scarce goods \ncan lead to violence, extortion, and disorder.  Pp. 9−13. \n(c) Petitioner’s proposal―that new detainees not arrested for seri-\nous crimes or for offenses involving weapons or drugs be exempt from \ninvasive searches unless they give officers a particular reason to sus-\npect them of hiding contraband―is unworkable.  The seriousness of  \nan offense is a poor predictor of who has contraband, and it would be \ndifficult to determine whether individual detainees fall within the \nproposed exemption.  Even persons arrested for a minor offense may \nbe coerced by others into concealing contraband.  Exempting people \narrested for minor offenses from a  standard search protocol thus may \nput  them  at  greater   risk  and  result  in  more   contraband  being  \nbrought into the detention facility. \n  It also  may be difficult to classify inmates  by their current and pri-\nor offenses before the intake search.  Jail officials know little at the  \noutset about an arrestee, who may be carrying a false ID or lie about \nhis identity.  The officers conducting an initial search often do not \nhave access to criminal history records.  And those records can be in-\naccurate or incomplete.  Even with accurate information, officers \nwould encounter serious implementation difficulties.  They would be \nrequired to determine quickly whether any underlying offenses were \nserious enough to authorize the more invasive  search protocol.  Other \npossible classifications based on characteristics of individual detain-\nees also might prove to be unworkable or even give rise to charges of \ndiscriminatory application.  To avoid liability, officers might be in-\nclined not to conduct a thorough search in any close case, thus creat-\ning unnecessary risk for the entire jail population.  While the re-\nstrictions petitioner suggests would limit the intrusion on the privacy \nof some detainees, it would be at the risk of increased danger to eve-\nryone in the facility, including the less serious offenders.  The Fourth \nand Fourteenth Amendments do not require adoption of the proposed \nframework. Pp. 13−18, 19.  \n \n\n4  FLORENCE v.

FLORENCE, PETITIONER  v. BOARD OF   \nCHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF THE COUNTY OF   \nBURLINGTON ET  AL.  \nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF   \nAPPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT   \n[April 2, 2012] \n JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court, \nexcept as to Part IV.*  \n  Correctional officials have a legitimate interest, indeed \na responsibility, to ensure that  jails are not made less \nsecure by reason of what new detainees may carry in on \ntheir bodies.  Facility personnel, other inmates, and the \nnew detainee himself or herself may be in danger if these \nthreats are introduced into the jail population.  This case  \npresents the question of what rules, or limitations, the \nConstitution imposes on searches of arrested persons who \nare to be held in jail while their cases are being processed.  \nThe term “jail” is used here in a broad sense to include\nprisons  and  other  detention  facilities.  The  specific \nmeasures  being  challenged  will  be  described  in  more \ndetail;  but,  in  broad  terms,  the  controversy  concerns \nwhether every detainee who will  be admitted to the gen-\neral population may be required to undergo a close visual \ninspection while undressed.\n  The case turns in part on the extent to which this Court  \n—————— \n*  JUSTICE THOMAS joins all but Part IV of this opinion. \n\n2  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON   \nOpinion of the Court  \nhas sufficient expertise and information in the record to \nmandate, under the Constitution, the specific restrictions\nand limitations sought by those who challenge the visual \nsearch procedures at issue.  In addressing this type of \nconstitutional claim courts must  defer to the judgment  of \ncorrectional officials unless the record contains substantial \nevidence showing their policies are an unnecessary or un-\njustified  response  to  problems  of  jail  security.  That  \nnecessary showing has not been made in this case. \nI \n  In 1998, seven years before the incidents at issue, peti-\ntioner  Albert  Florence  was  arrested  after  fleeing  from \npolice  officers  in  Essex  County,  New  Jersey.    He  was  \ncharged with obstruction of justice and use of a deadly  \nweapon.  Petitioner entered a plea of guilty to two lesser \noffenses and was sentenced to pay a fine in monthly in-\nstallments.  In 2003, after he fell behind on his payments \nand failed to appear at an enforcement hearing, a bench \nwarrant was issued for his arrest.  He paid the outstand-\ning balance less than a week later; but, for some unex-\nplained  reason,  the  warrant  remained  in  a  statewide \ncomputer database.\n  Two  years  later,  in  Burlington  County,  New  Jersey, \npetitioner and his wife were stopped in their automobile \nby a state trooper.  Based on the outstanding warrant in \nthe computer system, the officer arrested petitioner and \ntook him to the Burlington County Detention Center.  He  \nwas held there for six days and then was transferred to \nthe Essex County Correctional Facility.  It is not the ar-\nrest or confinement but the search process at each jail that \ngives rise to the claims before the Court. \n  Burlington  County  jail  procedures  required  every  ar-\nrestee to shower with a delousing agent.  Officers would \ncheck arrestees for scars, marks, gang tattoos, and contra-\nband as they disrobed.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 53a–56a.   \n\n  Cite as:  566 U. S. ____ (2012)  3 \n \nOpinion of the Court \nPetitioner  claims  he  was  also  instructed  to  open  his\nmouth, lift his tongue, hold out his arms, turn around, and \nlift his genitals.  (It is not clear whether this last step was\npart of the normal practice.  See ibid.)   Petitioner shared a \ncell with at least one other person and interacted with \nother inmates following his admission to the jail.  Tr. of \nOral Arg. 17. \n  The  Essex  County  Correctional  Facility,  where  peti- \ntioner was taken after six days, is the largest county jail \nin New Jersey.  App. 70a.  It admits more than 25,000 in- \nmates each year and houses about 1,000 gang members at \nany given time.  When petitioner was transferred there, \nall arriving detainees passed through a metal detector and \nwaited in a group holding cell for a more thorough search.  \nWhen they left the holding cell, they were instructed to \nremove  their  clothing  while  an  officer  looked  for  body \nmarkings, wounds, and contraband.  Apparently without \ntouching  the  detainees,  an  officer  looked  at  their  ears, \nnose, mouth, hair, scalp, fingers, hands, arms, armpits, \nand other body openings.  Id., at  57a–59a; App. to Pet.  \nfor Cert. 137a–144a.  This policy applied regardless of the \ncircumstances of the arrest, the suspected offense, or the \ndetainee’s behavior, demeanor, or criminal history.  Peti-\ntioner alleges he was required to lift his genitals, turn \naround, and cough in a squatting position as part of the  \nprocess.  After  a  mandatory  shower,  during  which  his \nclothes  were  inspected,  petitioner  was  admitted  to  the \nfacility.  App. 3a–4a, 52a, 258a.  He was released the next \nday, when the charges against him were dismissed.\n  Petitioner sued the governmental entities that operated\nthe jails, one of the wardens, and certain other defendants.\nThe  suit  was  commenced  in  the  United  States  District \nCourt for the District of New Jersey.  Seeking relief under\n42 U. S. C. §1983 for violations of his Fourth and Four-\nteenth Amendment rights, petitioner maintained that per- \nsons arrested for a minor offense could not be required  \n\n4  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON   \nOpinion of the Court  \nto remove their clothing and expose the most private areas \nof their bodies to close visual inspection as a routine part \nof the intake process.  Rather, he contended, officials could \nconduct  this  kind  of  search  only  if  they  had  reason  to \nsuspect a particular inmate of concealing a weapon, drugs, \nor other contraband.  The District Court certified a class of \nindividuals who were charged with a nonindictable offense \nunder New Jersey law, processed at either the Burlington \nCounty or Essex County jail, and directed to strip naked \neven though an officer had not articulated any reasonable\nsuspicion they were concealing contraband.\n  After  discovery,  the  court  granted  petitioner’s  motion \nfor summary judgment  on the unlawful search claim.  It \nconcluded that any policy of “strip searching” nonindict- \nable offenders without reasonable suspicion violated the \nFourth Amendment.  A divided panel of the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, holding \nthat the procedures described by the District Court struck \na  reasonable  balance  between  inmate  privacy  and  the \nsecurity needs of the two jails.  621 F. 3d 296 (2010).  The \ncase  proceeds  on  the  understanding  that  the  officers\nsearched detainees prior to their admission to the general \npopulation,  as  the  Court  of  Appeals  seems  to  have  as-\nsumed.  See id., at 298, 311.  Petitioner has not argued \nthis factual premise is incorrect. \n  The opinions in earlier proceedings, the briefs on file, \nand some cases of this Court refer to a “strip search.”  The \nterm is imprecise.  It may refer simply to the instruction \nto remove clothing while an officer observes from a dis-\ntance of, say, five feet or more; it may mean a visual in-\nspection  from  a  closer,  more  uncomfortable  distance;  it\nmay include directing detainees to shake their heads or to \nrun their hands through their hair to dislodge what might \nbe hidden there; or it may involve instructions to raise \narms, to display foot insteps, to expose the back of the \nears, to move or spread the buttocks or genital areas, or to  \n\n  Cite as:  566 U. S. ____ (2012)  5 \n \nOpinion of the Court \ncough in a squatting position.  In the instant case, the \nterm  does  not  include  any  touching  of  unclothed  areas \nby the inspecting officer.  There are no allegations that \nthe detainees here were touched in any way as part of the \nsearches. \n  The Federal Courts of Appeals have come to differing \nconclusions as to whether the Fourth Amendment requires \ncorrectional officials to exempt some detainees who will be \nadmitted to a jail’s general population from the searches \nhere at issue.  This Court granted certiorari to address the \nquestion.  563 U. S. ___ (2011). \nII  \n  The difficulties of operating a detention center must not \nbe underestimated by the courts.   Turner v.  Safley, 482 \nU. S.  78,  84–85  (1987).  Jails  (in  the  stricter  sense  of\nthe term, excluding prison facilities) admit more than 13 \nmillion inmates a year.  See, e.g.,  Dept. of Justice, Bureau\nof Justice Statistics, T. Minton, Jail Inmates at Midyear \n2010—Statistical Tables 2 (2011).  The largest facilities \nprocess hundreds of people every day; smaller jails may be \ncrowded on weekend nights, after a large police operation, \nor because of detainees arriving from other jurisdictions.  \nMaintaining  safety  and  order  at  these  institutions  re-\nquires  the  expertise  of  correctional  officials,  who  must \nhave substantial discretion to devise reasonable solutions \nto the problems they face.  The Court has confirmed the \nimportance of deference to correctional officials and ex-\nplained that a regulation impinging on an inmate’s consti-\ntutional rights must be upheld “if it is reasonably related \nto legitimate penological interests.”  Turner, supra, at 89;  \nsee Overton v. Bazzetta, 539 U. S. 126, 131–132 (2003).   \nBut  see  Johnson  v.  California,  543  U. S.  499,  510–511 \n(2005) (applying strict scrutiny to racial classifications). \n  The Court’s opinion in  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520  \n(1979), is the starting point for understanding how this  \n\n6  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON   \nOpinion of the Court  \nframework  applies  to  Fourth  Amendment  challenges.  \nThat case addressed a rule requiring pretrial detainees \nin any correctional facility run by the Federal Bureau of \nPrisons “to expose their body cavities for visual inspection \nas a part of a strip search conducted after every contact \nvisit with a person from outside the institution.”  Id., at  \n558.  Inmates  at  the  federal  Metropolitan  Correctional \nCenter in New York City argued there was no security \njustification for these searches.  Officers searched guests \nbefore they entered the visiting room, and the inmates \nwere under constant surveillance during the visit.  Id., at  \n577–578 (Marshall, J., dissenting).  There had been but \none instance in which an inmate attempted to sneak con-\ntraband back into the facility.  See id., at 559 (majority\nopinion).  The Court nonetheless upheld the search policy.  \nIt deferred to the judgment of correctional officials that \nthe  inspections  served  not  only  to  discover  but  also  to \ndeter the smuggling of weapons, drugs, and other prohib-\nited items inside.  Id., at 558.  The Court explained that\nthere is no mechanical way to determine whether intru-\nsions on an inmate’s privacy are reasonable.  Id., at 559.  \nThe need for a particular search must be balanced against \nthe resulting invasion of personal rights.  Ibid.  \n  Policies designed to keep contraband out of jails and\nprisons have been upheld in cases decided since Bell.  In  \nBlock v. Rutherford, 468 U. S. 576 (1984), for example, the \nCourt concluded that the Los Angeles County Jail could \nban all contact visits because of the threat they posed: \n“They  open  the  institution  to  the  introduction  of \ndrugs, weapons, and other contraband.  Visitors can  \neasily conceal guns, knives, drugs, or other contra-\nband in countless ways and pass them to an inmate \nunnoticed by even the most vigilant observers.  And \nthese items can readily be slipped from the clothing of \nan  innocent  child,  or  transferred  by  other  visitors \n\n  Cite as:  566 U. S. ____ (2012)  7 \n \nOpinion of the Court \npermitted close contact with inmates.”  Id., at 586. \nThere were “many justifications” for imposing a general \nban rather than trying to carve out exceptions for certain \ndetainees.  Id., at 587.  Among other problems, it would be \n“a difficult if not impossible task” to identify “inmates who \nhave propensities for violence, escape, or drug smuggling.”  \nIbid.  This was made “even more difficult by the brevity of \ndetention and the constantly changing nature of the in-\nmate population.”  Ibid. \n  The Court has also recognized that deterring the posses-\nsion of contraband depends in part on the ability to con-\nduct searches without predictable exceptions.  In Hudson  \nv. Palmer, 468 U. S. 517 (1984), it addressed the question \nof whether prison officials could perform random searches \nof inmate lockers and cells even without reason to suspect \na  particular  individual  of  concealing  a  prohibited  item.  \nId., at 522–523.  The Court upheld the constitutionality of \nthe practice, recognizing that “‘[f]or one to advocate that \n \nprison searches must be conducted only pursuant to an\nenunciated general policy or when suspicion is directed at \na  particular  inmate  is  to  ignore  the  realities  of  prison \noperation.’”    Id.,  at  529  (quoting  Marrero  v.  Common-\n \nwealth, 222 Va. 754, 757, 284 S. E. 2d 809, 811 (1981)).  \nInmates  would  adapt  to  any  pattern  or  loopholes  they \ndiscovered in the search protocol and then undermine the \nsecurity of the institution.  468 U. S., at 529. \n  These cases establish that correctional officials must be \npermitted to devise reasonable search policies to detect \nand deter the possession of contraband in their facilities.  \nSee Bell, 441 U. S., at 546 (“[M]aintaining institutional \nsecurity and preserving internal order and discipline are \nessential goals that may require limitation or retraction of\nretained constitutional rights of both convicted prisoners \nand pretrial detainees”).  The task of determining whether \na policy is reasonably related to legitimate security inter-\n\n8  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON   \nOpinion of the Court  \nests  is  “peculiarly  within  the  province  and  professional \nexpertise of corrections officials.”  Id., at 548.  This Court \nhas  repeated  the  admonition  that,  “‘in  the  absence  of \n \nsubstantial  evidence  in  the  record  to  indicate  that  the \nofficials have exaggerated their response to these consid-\nerations  courts  should  ordinarily  defer  to  their  expert \njudgment in such matters.’”  Block, supra, at 584–585;  \n \nBell, supra, at 548. \n  In many jails officials seek to improve security by re-\nquiring some kind of strip search of everyone who is to be \ndetained.  These procedures have been used in different \nplaces  throughout  the  country,  from  Cranston,  Rhode\nIsland, to Sapulpa, Oklahoma, to Idaho Falls, Idaho.  See \nRoberts  v.  Rhode  Island,  239  F. 3d  107,  108–109  (CA1  \n2001);  Chapman  v.  Nichols,  989  F. 2d  393,  394  (CA10  \n1993); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F. 2d 614, 615 (CA9 1984) \n(per curiam); see also,  e.g., Bull v. City and Cty. of San  \nFrancisco, 595 F. 3d 964 (CA9 2010) (en banc) (San Fran-\ncisco, California); Powell v. Barrett, 541 F. 3d 1298 (CA11  \n2008) (en banc) (Fulton Cty., Ga.); Masters v.  Crouch, 872 \nF. 2d 1248, 1251 (CA6 1989) (Jefferson Cty., Ky.); Weber v.  \nDell, 804 F. 2d 796, 797–798 (CA2 1986) (Monroe Cty., \nN. Y.); Stewart v. Lubbock Cty., 767 F. 2d 153, 154 (CA5  \n1985) (Lubbock Cty., Tex.). \n  Persons arrested for minor offenses may be among the \ndetainees processed at these facilities.  This is, in part, a \nconsequence of the exercise of state authority that was the \nsubject of  Atwater  v.  Lago Vista, 532 U. S. 318 (2001).   \nAtwater addressed the perhaps more fundamental ques-\ntion of who may be deprived of liberty and taken to jail in \nthe first place.  The case involved a woman who was ar-\nrested after a police officer noticed neither she nor her \nchildren were wearing their seatbelts.  The arrestee ar-\ngued  the  Fourth  Amendment  prohibited  her  custodial \narrest without a warrant when an offense could not result \nin jail time and there was no compelling need for immedi-\n\n  Cite as:  566 U. S. ____ (2012)  9 \n \nOpinion of the Court \nate detention.  Id., at 346.  The Court held that a Fourth  \nAmendment restriction on this power would put officers in \nan “almost impossible spot.”  Id., at 350.  Their ability to\narrest a suspect would depend in some cases on the pre-\ncise weight of drugs in his pocket, whether he was a repeat \noffender, and the scope of what counted as a compelling \nneed to detain someone.  Id., at 348–349.  The Court re-\njected the proposition that the Fourth Amendment barred \ncustodial arrests in a set of these cases as a matter of \nconstitutional law.  It  ruled, based on established princi-\nples, that officers may make an arrest based upon proba-\nble cause to believe the person has committed a criminal \noffense in their presence.  See id., at 354.  The  Court \nstated that “a responsible Fourth Amendment balance is \nnot well served by standards requiring sensitive, case-by-\ncase determinations of government need, lest every discre-\ntionary judgment in the field  be converted into an occasion \nfor constitutional review.”  Id., at 347. \n  Atwater did not address whether the Constitution im-\nposes  special  restrictions  on  the  searches  of  offenders \nsuspected  of  committing  minor  offenses  once  they  are \ntaken to jail.  Some Federal Courts of Appeals have held \nthat corrections officials may not conduct a strip search of \nthese detainees, even  if no touching is involved, absent \nreasonable suspicion of concealed contraband.  621 F. 3d,  \nat 303–304, and n. 4.  The Courts of Appeals to address \nthis issue in the last decade, however, have come to the \nopposite conclusion.  See 621 F. 3d 296 (case below); Bame  \nv.  Dillard,  637  F. 3d  380  (CADC  2011);  Powell,  supra;  \nBull, supra.  The current case is set against this precedent \nand governed by the principles announced in Turner and  \nBell. \nIII  \n  The question here is whether undoubted security im-\nperatives involved in jail supervision override the asser-\n\n10  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON   \nOpinion of the Court  \ntion that some detainees must be exempt from the more \ninvasive  search  procedures  at  issue  absent  reasonable \nsuspicion of a concealed weapon or other contraband.  The \nCourt has held that deference must be given to the offi-\ncials  in  charge  of  the  jail  unless  there  is  “substantial \nevidence” demonstrating their response to the situation is \nexaggerated.  Block, 468 U. S., at 584–585 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).  Petitioner has not met this standard,  \nand the record provides full justifications for the proce-\ndures used. \nA \n  Correctional officials have a significant interest in con-\nducting a thorough search as a standard part of the intake  \nprocess.  The admission of inmates  creates numerous risks \nfor facility staff, for the existing detainee population, and \nfor a new detainee himself or herself.  The danger of intro-\nducing lice or contagious infections, for example, is well \ndocumented.  See,  e.g.,  Deger  &  Quick,  The  Enduring \nMenace of MRSA: Incidence, Treatment, and Prevention \nin a County Jail, 15 J. Correctional Health Care 174, 174–\n175, 177–178 (2009); Bick, Infection Control in Jails and \nPrisons, 45 Healthcare Epidemiology 1047, 1049 (2007).  \nThe  Federal  Bureau  of  Prisons  recommends  that  staff  \nscreen new detainees for these conditions.  See Clinical  \nPractice Guidelines, Management of Methicillin-Resistant \nStaphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Infections 2 (2011); Clini-\ncal Practice Guidelines, Lice and Scabies Protocol 1 (2011).  \nPersons just arrested may have wounds or other injuries \nrequiring immediate medical attention.  It may be difficult \nto identify and treat these problems until detainees re-\nmove their clothes for a visual inspection.  See Prison and \nJail Administration: Practice and Theory 142 (P. Carlson \n& G. Garrett eds., 2d ed. 2008) (hereinafter Carlson & \nGarrett). \n  Jails and prisons also  face grave threats posed by the  \n\n  Cite as:  566 U.

The groups recruit new members by \nforce,  engage  in  assaults  against  staff,  and  give  other \ninmates a reason to arm themselves.  Ibid.  Fights among \nfeuding gangs can be deadly, and the officers who must \nmaintain order are put in harm’s way.  PBA Brief 17.  \nThese considerations provide a reasonable basis to justify \na visual inspection for certain tattoos and other signs of \ngang affiliation as part of the intake process.  The identi- \nfication and isolation of gang  members before they are \nadmitted protects everyone in the facility.  Cf. Fraise v.  \nTerhune, 283 F. 3d 506, 509–510 (CA3 2002) (Alito, J.) \n(describing a statewide policy authorizing the identifica-\ntion and isolation of gang members in prison). \n  Detecting contraband concealed by new detainees, fur-\nthermore,  is  a  most  serious  responsibility.    Weapons, \ndrugs, and alcohol all disrupt the safe operation of a jail.  \nCf. Hudson, 468 U. S., at 528 (recognizing “the constant \nfight against the proliferation of knives and guns, illicit \ndrugs, and other contraband”).  Correctional officers have  \nhad to confront arrestees concealing knives, scissors, razor \nblades, glass shards, and other prohibited items on their \nperson, including in their body cavities.  See Bull, 595 \nF. 3d, at 967, 969; Brief for New Jersey County Jail War-\ndens  Association  as   Amicus  Curiae  17–18  (hereinafter \nNew Jersey Wardens Brief).  They have also found crack, \nheroin, and marijuana.  Brief for City and County of San \nFrancisco  et  al.  as  Amici  Curiae  9–11  (hereinafter  San  \nFrancisco Brief).  The use of drugs can embolden inmates  \n\n12  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON   \nOpinion of the Court  \nin  aggression  toward   officers  or  each  other;  and,  even \napart from their use, the trade in these substances can \nlead to violent confrontations.  See PBA Brief 11. \n  There are many other kinds of contraband.  The text-\nbook definition of the term covers any unauthorized item.  \nSee  Prisons:  Today  and  Tomorrow  237  (J.  Pollock  ed. \n1997) (“Contraband is any item that is possessed in viola-\ntion of prison rules.  Contraband obviously includes drugs \nor weapons, but it can also be money, cigarettes, or even \nsome types of clothing”).  Everyday items can undermine\nsecurity if introduced into a detention facility: \n“Lighters and matches are fire and arson risks or po-\ntential weapons.  Cell phones are used to orchestrate \nviolence and criminality both within and without jail-\nhouse walls.  Pills and medications enhance suicide \nrisks.  Chewing gum can block locking devices; hair-\npins can open handcuffs; wigs can conceal drugs and \nweapons.”  New Jersey Wardens Brief 8–9. \nSomething  as  simple  as  an  overlooked  pen  can  pose  a \nsignificant  danger.  Inmates  commit  more  than  10,000  \nassaults on correctional staff every year and many more \namong themselves.  See Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice \nStatistics, J. Stephan & J. Karberg, Census of State and \nFederal Correctional Facilities, 2000, p. v (2003). \n  Contraband creates additional problems because scarce \nitems, including currency, have value in a jail’s culture \nand underground economy.  Correctional officials inform  \nus “[t]he competition . . . for such goods begets violence, \nextortion, and disorder.”  New Jersey Wardens Brief 2.  \nGangs exacerbate the problem.  They “orchestrate thefts, \ncommit assaults, and approach inmates in packs to take \nthe contraband from the weak.”  Id., at 9–10.  This puts \nthe  entire facility,  including  detainees  being  held  for  a \nbrief term for a minor offense, at risk.  Gangs do coerce \ninmates who have access to the outside world, such as  \n\n  Cite as:  566 U. S. ____ (2012)  13  \n \nOpinion of the Court \npeople serving their time on the weekends, to sneak things \ninto the jail.  Id., at 10; see,  e.g., Pugmire, Vegas Suspect \nHas Term to Serve, Los Angeles Times, Sept. 23, 2005, \np.  B1 (“Weekend-only  jail sentences are a common punish-\nment for people convicted of nonviolent drug crimes . . .”).  \nThese inmates, who might be thought to pose the least \nrisk, have been caught smuggling prohibited items into \njail.  See New Jersey Wardens Brief 10.  Concealing con-\ntraband often takes little time and effort.  It might be done \nas an officer approaches a suspect’s car or during a brief \ncommotion  in  a  group  holding  cell.    Something  small \nmight be tucked or taped under an armpit, behind an ear, \nbetween the buttocks, in the instep of a foot, or inside the \nmouth or some other body cavity. \n  It  is  not  surprising  that  correctional  officials  have \nsought to perform thorough searches at intake for disease,\ngang affiliation, and contraband.  Jails are often crowded, \nunsanitary, and dangerous places.  There is a substantial \ninterest in preventing any new inmate, either of his own \nwill or as a result of coercion, from putting all who live or \nwork at these institutions at even greater risk when he is \nadmitted to the general population. \nB \n  Petitioner acknowledges that  correctional officials must \nbe allowed to conduct an effective search during the intake \nprocess and that this will require at least some detainees \nto  lift  their  genitals  or  cough  in  a  squatting  position.  \nThese procedures, similar to the ones upheld in Bell, are  \ndesigned to uncover contraband that can go undetected by \na  patdown,  metal  detector,  and  other  less  invasive \nsearches.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23  \n(hereinafter  United  States  Brief);  New  Jersey  Wardens \nBrief 19, n. 6.  Petitioner maintains there is little benefit \nto conducting these more invasive steps on a new detainee \nwho has not been arrested for a serious crime or for any  \n\n14  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON   \nOpinion of the Court  \noffense involving a weapon or drugs.  In his view these de-\ntainees should be exempt from this process unless they \ngive officers a particular reason to suspect them of hiding \ncontraband.    It  is  reasonable,  however,  for  correctional  \nofficials to conclude this standard would be unworkable.   \nThe record provides evidence that the seriousness of an \noffense  is  a  poor  predictor  of  who  has  contraband  and \nthat it would be difficult in practice to determine whether \nindividual detainees fall within the proposed exemption. \n1 \n  People detained for minor offenses can turn out to be \nthe most devious and dangerous criminals. Cf.  Clements v. \nLogan,  454  U. S.  1304,  1305  (1981)  (Rehnquist,  J.,  in \nchambers) (deputy at a detention center shot by misde-\nmeanant who had not been strip searched).

Reasonable \ncorrectional  officials  could  conclude  these  uncertainties \nmean  they  must  conduct  the  same  thorough  search  of \neveryone who will be admitted to their facilities. \n  Experience  shows  that  people  arrested  for  minor  of- \nfenses have tried to smuggle prohibited items into jail, \nsometimes by using their rectal cavities or genitals for the \nconcealment.  They may have some of the same incentives\nas  a  serious  criminal  to  hide  contraband.  A  detainee \nmight  risk  carrying  cash,  cigarettes,  or  a  penknife  to \n\n  Cite as:  566 U. S. ____ (2012)  15  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nsurvive in jail.  Others may make a quick decision to hide \nunlawful substances to avoid getting in more trouble at \nthe time of their arrest.  This record has concrete exam-\nples.  Officers at the Atlantic County Correctional Facility, \nfor example, discovered that a man arrested for driving\nunder the influence had “2 dime bags of weed, 1 pack of \nrolling  papers,  20  matches,  and  5  sleeping  pills”  taped \nunder  his  scrotum.    Brief  for  Atlantic  County  et al.  as  \nAmici Curiae 36 (internal quotation marks omitted).  A \nperson  booked  on  a  misdemeanor  charge  of  disorderly \nconduct in Washington State managed to hide a lighter, \ntobacco, tattoo needles, and other prohibited items in his \nrectal  cavity.  See  United  States  Brief  25,  n. 15.    San \nFrancisco officials have discovered contraband hidden in \nbody  cavities  of  people  arrested  for  trespassing,  public \nnuisance, and shoplifting.  San Francisco Brief 3.  There \nhave been similar incidents at jails throughout the coun-\ntry.  See United States Brief 25, n. 15. \n  Even if people arrested for a minor offense do not them-\nselves wish to introduce contraband into a jail, they may \nbe coerced into doing so by others.  See New Jersey War-\ndens Brief 16; cf. Block, 468 U. S., at 587 (“It is not unrea-\nsonable  to  assume,  for  instance,  that  low  security  risk \ndetainees would be enlisted to help obtain contraband or \nweapons by their fellow inmates who are denied contact \nvisits”).  This could happen any time detainees are held in \nthe same area, including in a van on the way to the station \nor in the holding cell of the jail.  If, for example, a person\narrested and detained for unpaid traffic citations is not \nsubject  to  the  same search  as  others,  this will  be  well \nknown to other detainees with jail experience.  A hardened \ncriminal or gang member can, in just a few minutes, ap-\nproach the person and coerce him into hiding the fruits of \na crime, a weapon, or some other contraband.  As an ex-\npert in this case explained, “the interaction and mingling \nbetween misdemeanants and felons will only increase the  \n\n16  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON   \nOpinion of the Court  \namount of contraband in the facility if the jail can only \nconduct admission searches on felons.”  App. 381a.   Ex-\nempting people arrested for minor offenses from a stand-\nard search  protocol thus may put them at greater risk and \nresult in more contraband being brought into the deten-\ntion facility.  This is a substantial reason not to mandate \nthe exception petitioner seeks as a matter of constitutional \nlaw. \n2 \n  It also may be difficult, as a practical matter, to classify \ninmates  by  their  current  and  prior  offenses  before  the \nintake search.  Jails can be even more dangerous than \nprisons  because  officials  there  know  so  little  about  the \npeople they admit at the outset.  See New Jersey Wardens \nBrief 11–14.  An arrestee may be carrying a false ID or lie \nabout his identity.  The officers who conduct an initial \nsearch often do not have access to criminal history records.  \nSee, e.g., App. 235a; New Jersey Wardens Brief 13.  And \nthose records can be inaccurate or incomplete.  See De-\npartment of Justice v. Reporters  Comm. for Freedom of  \nPress, 489 U. S. 749, 752 (1989).  Petitioner’s rap sheet is \nan example.  It did not reflect his previous arrest for pos-\nsession of a deadly weapon.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 18–19.  In \nthe absence of reliable information it would be illogical to \nrequire officers to assume the arrestees in front of them do \nnot pose a risk of smuggling something into the facility.\n  The laborious administration of prisons would become \nless effective, and likely less fair and evenhanded, were \nthe practical problems inevitable from the rules suggested \nby petitioner to be imposed as a constitutional mandate.  \nEven if they had accurate information about a detainee’s \ncurrent and prior arrests, officers, under petitioner’s pro-\nposed  regime,  would  encounter  serious  implementation \ndifficulties.  They would be required, in a few minutes, to \ndetermine whether any of the underlying offenses were  \n\n  Cite as:  566 U. S. ____ (2012)  17  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nserious  enough  to  authorize  the  more  invasive  search \nprotocol.  Other possible classifications based on charac-\nteristics  of  individual  detainees  also  might  prove  to  be \nunworkable or even give rise to charges of discriminatory \napplication.  Most officers would not be well equipped to \nmake any of these legal determinations during the pres-\nsures of the intake process.  Bull, 595 F. 3d, at 985–987  \n(Kozinski, C. J., concurring); see also Welsh v. Wisconsin, \n466  U. S.  740,  761–762  (1984)  (White,  J.,  dissenting) \n(“[T]he  Court’s  approach  will  necessitate  a  case-by-case \nevaluation of the seriousness of particular crimes, a dif- \nficult  task  for  which  officers  and  courts  are  poorly \nequipped”).  To avoid liability, officers might be inclined \nnot to conduct a thorough search in any close case, thus \ncreating unnecessary risk for the entire jail population.  \nCf. Atwater, 532 U. S., at 351, and n. 22. \n  The Court addressed an analogous problem in Atwater. \nThe petitioner in that case argued the Fourth Amendment \nprohibited a warrantless arrest when being convicted of \nthe suspected crime “could not ultimately carry any jail \ntime” and there was “no compelling need for immediate\ndetention.”  Id., at 346.  That rule “promise[d] very little in \nthe way of administrability.”  Id., at 350.  Officers could \nnot be expected to draw the proposed lines on a moment’s \nnotice, and the risk of violating the Constitution would \nhave discouraged them from arresting criminals in any \nquestionable circumstances.  Id.,  at 350–351 (“An officer\nnot quite sure the drugs weighed enough to warrant jail \ntime or not quite certain about a suspect’s risk of flight \nwould not arrest, even though it could perfectly well turn \nout that, in fact, the offense called for incarceration and \nthe defendant was long gone on the day of trial”).  The \nFourth Amendment did not compel this result in Atwater. \nThe Court held that officers who have probable cause to \nbelieve even a minor criminal offense has been committed \nin their presence may arrest the offender.  See id., at 354.   \n\n18  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON   \nOOpipninioinon o fo fK tEhNeN CEoDuYr,  tJ .  \nIndividual jurisdictions can of course choose “to impose \nmore  restrictive  safeguards  through  statutes  limiting \nwarrantless arrests for minor offenders.”  Id., at 352. \n  One of the central principles in Atwater applies with\nequal force here.  Officers who interact with those sus-\npected of violating the law have an “essential interest in \nreadily administrable rules.”  Id., at 347; accord, New York  \nv. Belton, 453 U. S. 454, 458 (1981).  The officials in charge \nof the jails in this case urge the Court to reject any compli-\ncated constitutional scheme requiring them to conduct less \nthorough  inspections  of  some  detainees  based  on  their \nbehavior, suspected offense, criminal history, and other \nfactors.  They offer significant reasons why the Constitu-\ntion  must  not  prevent  them  from  conducting  the  same \nsearch on any suspected offender who will be admitted to\nthe general population in their facilities.  The restrictions  \nsuggested by petitioner would limit the intrusion on the \nprivacy  of  some  detainees  but  at  the  risk   of  increased \ndanger to everyone in the facility, including the less seri-\nous offenders themselves.  \nIV \n  This case does not require the Court to rule on the types \nof searches that would be reasonable in instances where, \nfor example, a detainee will be held without assignment to \nthe general jail population and without substantial contact\nwith other detainees.  This describes the circumstances in  \nAtwater.  See 532 U. S., at 324 (“Officers took Atwater’s \n‘mug shot’ and placed her, alone, in a jail cell for about one \nhour, after which she was taken before a magistrate and \nreleased on $310 bond”).  The accommodations provided in \nthese situations may diminish the need to conduct some\naspects of the searches at issue.  Cf. United States Brief 30 \n(discussing the segregation, and less invasive searches, of \nindividuals  held  by  the  Federal  Bureau  of  Prisons  for\nmisdemeanors  or  civil  contempt).    The  circumstances  \n\n  Cite as:  566 U. S. ____ (2012)  19  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nbefore the Court, however, do not present the opportunity \nto consider a narrow exception of the sort JUSTICE  ALITO  \ndescribes, post, at 2–3 (concurring opinion), which might \nrestrict whether an arrestee whose detention has not yet \nbeen reviewed by a magistrate or other judicial officer, \nand who can be held in available facilities removed from \nthe general population, may be subjected to the types of \nsearches at issue here. \n  Petitioner’s  amici   raise  concerns  about  instances  of \nofficers  engaging  in  intentional  humiliation  and  other \nabusive practices.  See Brief for Sister Bernie Galvin et al.  \nas  Amici  Curiae;  see  also  Hudson,  468  U. S.,  at  528  \n(“[I]ntentional  harassment  of  even  the  most  hardened\ncriminals cannot be tolerated by a civilized society”); Bell, \n441 U. S., at 560.  There also may be legitimate concerns \nabout the invasiveness of searches that involve the touch-\ning of detainees.  These issues are not implicated on the \nfacts of this case, however, and it is unnecessary to con- \nsider them here. \nV \n  Even assuming all the facts in favor of petitioner, the \nsearch  procedures  at  the  Burlington  County  Detention\nCenter and the Essex County Correctional Facility struck \na  reasonable  balance  between  inmate  privacy  and  the \nneeds  of  the  institutions.  The  Fourth  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments do not require adoption of the framework of \nrules petitioner proposes. \n  The  judgment  of  the  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Third\nCircuit is affirmed. \nIt is so ordered.  \n\n  Cite as:  566 U.

As with JUSTICE ALITO, \nhowever, it is important for me that the Court does not \nforeclose the possibility of an exception to the rule it an-\nnounces.

Those  circumstances  \ninclude  the  facts  that  Florence  was  detained  not  for  a  \nminor traffic offense but instead pursuant to a warrant for \nhis arrest, and that there was apparently no alternative, if \nFlorence were to be detained, to holding him in the gen-\neral jail population. \n  Factual nuances have not played a significant role as \nthis case has been presented to the Court.

The  Court  holds  that  jail  adminis- \ntrators may require all arrestees who are committed to \nthe general population of a jail to undergo visual strip\nsearches  not  involving  physical  contact  by  corrections \nofficers.  To perform the searches, officers may direct the \narrestees to disrobe, shower, and submit to a visual in-\nspection.  As part of the inspection, the arrestees may be \nrequired to manipulate their bodies.\n  Undergoing such an inspection is undoubtedly humiliat-\ning and deeply offensive to many, but there are reason- \nable grounds for strip searching arrestees before they are \nadmitted to the general population of a jail.  As the Court  \nexplains, there is a serious danger that some detainees \nwill attempt to smuggle weapons, drugs, or other contra-\nband into the jail.  Some detainees may have lice, which \ncan easily spread to others in the facility, and some de-\ntainees may have diseases or injuries for which the jail \nis required to provide medical treatment.  In addition, if a \ndetainee with gang-related tattoos is inadvertently housed \nwith detainees from a rival gang, violence may ensue. \n  Petitioner  and  the  dissent  would  permit  corrections \nofficers to conduct the visual strip search at issue here  \n\n2  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON   \nALITO,  J., concurring   \nonly if the officers have a reasonable basis  for thinking \nthat a particular arrestee may present a danger to other \ndetainees or members of the jail staff.  But as the Court \nexplains, corrections officers are often in a very poor posi-\ntion to make such a determination, and the threat to the \nhealth and safety of detainees and staff, should the offic-\ners miscalculate, is simply too great. \n  It is important to note, however, that the Court does not \nhold that it is always reasonable to conduct a full strip \nsearch of an arrestee whose detention has not been re-\nviewed by a judicial officer and who could be held in avail-\nable facilities apart from the general population.  Most of  \nthose arrested for minor offenses  are not dangerous, and \nmost are released from custody prior to or at the time of \ntheir  initial  appearance  before  a  magistrate.  In  some  \ncases, the charges are dropped.  In others, arrestees are \nreleased either on their own recognizance or on minimal \nbail.  In the end, few are sentenced to incarceration.  For  \nthese persons, admission to the general jail population, \nwith the concomitant humiliation of a strip search, may \nnot be reasonable, particularly if an alternative procedure \nis feasible.  For example, the Federal Bureau of Prisons\n(BOP) and possibly even some local jails appear to segre-\ngate temporary detainees who are minor offenders from \nthe general population.  See, e.g., Brief for United States \nas Amicus Curiae 30; Bull v.

BOARD OF  \nCHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF THE COUNTY OF  \nBURLINGTON ET  AL.  \nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF  \nAPPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT   \n[April 2, 2012]  \n JUSTICE   BREYER,  with  whom  JUSTICE  GINSBURG, \nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR,  and JUSTICE  KAGAN join, dissenting. \n  The  petition  for  certiorari  asks  us  to  decide \n“[w]hether the Fourth Amendment permits a . . . suspi-\ncionless  strip  search  of  every  individual  arrested  for \nany minor offense . . .  .”  Pet. for Cert. i.  This question \nis phrased more broadly than what is at issue.  The \ncase  is  limited  to  strip  searches  of  those  arrestees \nentering a jail’s general population, see 621 F. 3d 296, \n298 (CA3 2010).  And the kind of strip search in ques-\ntion  involves  more  than  undressing  and  taking  a  \nshower  (even  if  guards  monitor  the  shower  area  for \nthreatened  disorder).  Rather,  the  searches  here  in-\nvolve close observation of the private areas of a per-\nson’s body and for that reason constitute a far more \nserious invasion of that person’s privacy. \n  The visually invasive kind of strip search at issue \nhere is not unique.  A similar practice is well described  \nin  Dodge  v.  County  of   Orange,  282  F.  Supp.  2d  41 \n(SDNY  2003).    In  that  New  York  case,  the  “strip \nsearch”  (as  described  in  a  relevant  prison  manual) \ninvolved: \n“‘a visual inspection of the inmate’s naked body.  This \n \nshould  include  the  inmate  opening  his  mouth  and \n\n2  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF  \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON   \nBREYER,  J., dissenting  \nmoving his tongue up and down and from side to side, \nremoving any dentures, running his hands through \nhis hair, allowing his ears to be visually examined, \nlifting his arms to expose his arm pits, lifting his feet \nto examine the sole, spreading and/or lifting his testi-\ncles to expose the area behind them and bending over\nand/or spreading the cheeks of his buttocks to expose \nhis anus.  For females, the procedures are similar ex-\ncept females must in addition, squat to expose the \nvagina.’”  Id., at 46. \n \nBecause the Dodge court obtained considerable empirical \ninformation about the need for such a search in respect \nto minor offenders, and because the searches alleged in \nthis case do not differ significantly, I shall use the succinct  \nDodge  description  as  a  template  for  the  kind  of  strip \nsearch to which the Question Presented refers.  See, e.g., \nApp.  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  3a–4a  (alleging  that  officers  in-\nspected his genitals from an arm’s length away, required \nhim to lift his genitals, and examined his anal cavity). \n  In my view, such a search of an individual arrested for a \nminor offense that does not involve drugs or violence—say \na traffic offense, a regulatory offense, an essentially civil \nmatter, or any other such misdemeanor—is an “unreason-\nable searc[h]” forbidden by the Fourth Amendment, unless \nprison  authorities  have  reasonable  suspicion  to  believe\nthat the individual possesses drugs or other contraband.  \nAnd I dissent from the Court’s contrary determination. \nI \n  Those  confined  in  prison  retain  basic  constitutional \nrights.  Bell  v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 545 (1979); Turner  \nv. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, 84 (1987) (“Prison walls do not \nform a barrier separating prison inmates from the protec-\ntions of the Constitution”).  The constitutional right at \nissue here is the Fourth Amendment right to be free of \n“unreasonable searches and seizures.”  And, as the Court \n\n  Cite as:  566 U. S. ____ (2012)  3 \n \nBREYER,  J., dissenting \nnotes, the applicable standard is the Fourth Amendment \nbalancing inquiry announced regarding prison inmates  in \nBell v.  Wolfish, supra.  The Court said: \n“The  test  of  reasonableness  under  the  Fourth  \nAmendment is not capable of precise definition or me-\nchanical application.  In each case it requires a bal-\nancing of the need for the particular search against \nthe invasion of personal rights that the search entails.  \nCourts must consider the scope of the particular in-\ntrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justi-\nfication for initiating it, and the place in which it is \nconducted.”   Id., at 559.  \nI have described in general terms, see supra, at 1–2, the \nplace,  scope  and  manner  of  “the  particular  intrusion.”  \nBell, 441 U. S., at 559.  I now explain why I believe that \nthe “invasion of personal rights” here is very serious and \nlacks need or justification, ibid.—at least as to the cate-\ngory of minor offenders at issue.  \nII  \n  A strip search that involves a stranger peering without \nconsent at a naked individual, and in particular at the \nmost private portions of that person’s body, is a serious in-\nvasion of privacy.  We have recently said, in respect to a \nschoolchild (and a less intrusive search), that the “mean-\ning of such a search, and the degradation its subject may \nreasonably feel, place a search that intrusive in a category \nof its own demanding its own specific suspicions.”  Safford \nUnified  School  Dist.  #1  v.  Redding,  557  U. S.  ___,  ___  \n(2009) (slip op., at 11).  The Courts of Appeals have more \ndirectly described the privacy interests at stake, writing, \nfor example, that practices similar to those at issue here \nare “demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified, humiliating, \nterrifying,  unpleasant,  embarrassing,  [and]  repulsive, \nsignifying degradation and submission.”  Mary Beth G. v. \n\n4  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF  \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON   \nBREYER,  J., dissenting  \nChicago, 723 F. 2d 1263, 1272 (CA7 1984) (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted); see also, e.g., Blackburn v. Snow, 771 \nF. 2d 556, 564 (CA1 1985) (“‘[A]ll courts’” have recognized \n   \nthe “‘severe if not gross interference with a person’s pri-\n  \nvacy’” that accompany visual body cavity searches (quoting  \n \nArruda v. Fair, 710 F. 2d 886, 887 (CA1 1983))).  These  \nkinds of searches also gave this Court the “most pause” in \nBell, supra, at 558  (guards strip searched prisoners after \nthey received outside visits).  Even when carried out in a \nrespectful manner, and even absent any physical touching,  \nsee ante at 4–5, 19, such searches are inherently harmful, \nhumiliating,  and  degrading.  And  the  harm  to  privacy\ninterests would seem particularly acute where the person \nsearched may well have no expectation of being subject\nto such a search, say, because she had simply received a \ntraffic ticket for failing to buckle a seatbelt, because he \nhad not previously paid a civil fine, or because she had \nbeen arrested for a minor trespass.\nIn Atwater v. Lago Vista,  532 U. S. 318, 323–324 (2001), \nfor example, police arrested a mother driving with her two \nchildren because their seat belts were not buckled.  This  \nCourt held that the Constitution did not forbid an arrest  \nfor a minor seatbelt offense.  Id., at 323.  But, in doing so, \nit pointed out that the woman was held for only an hour \n(before being taken to a magistrate and released on bond) \nand that the search—she had to remove her shoes, jew-\nelry, and the contents of her pockets, id., at 355—was not \n“‘unusually harmful to [her] privacy or . . . physical inter-\n \nests.’”  Id., at 354 (quoting Whren v. United States, 517 \n \nU. S. 806, 818 (1996)).  Would this Court have upheld the \narrest had the magistrate not been immediately available, \nhad the police housed her overnight in the jail, and had \nthey subjected her to a search of the kind at issue here?  \nCf. County of Riverside v.  McLaughlin, 500 U. S. 44, 56  \n(1991) (presentment must be within 48 hours after arrest).\n  The petitioner, Albert W. Florence, states that his pre-\n\n  Cite as:  566 U. S. ____ (2012)  5 \n \nBREYER,  J., dissenting \nsent arrest grew out of an (erroneous) report that he had \nfailed to pay a minor civil fine previously assessed because \nhe had hindered a prosecution (by fleeing police officers \nin his automobile).  App. 25a–26a.  He alleges that he was \nheld for six days in jail before being taken to a magistrate \nand that he was subjected to two strip searches of the kind \nin question.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a. \n  Amicus briefs present other instances in which individ-\nuals arrested for minor offenses have been subjected to \nthe humiliations of a visual strip search.  They include a\nnun, a Sister of Divine Providence for 50 years, who was ar-\nrested for trespassing during an antiwar demonstration.  \nBrief for Sister Bernie Galvin et al. as Amici Curiae 6.   \nThey  include  women  who  were  strip-searched  during \nperiods of lactation or menstruation.  Id., at 11–12 (de-\nscribing humiliating experience of  female student who was \nstrip searched while menstruating); Archuleta v. Wagner, \n523 F. 3d 1278, 1282 (CA10 2008) (same for woman lac-\ntating).  They include victims of sexual violence.  Brief \nfor Domestic Violence Legal Empowerment and Appeals \nProject et al. as Amici Curiae.  They include individuals \ndetained for such infractions as driving with a noisy muf-\nfler, driving with an inoperable headlight, failing to use a \nturn signal, or riding a bicycle without an audible bell.  \nBrief for Petitioner 11, 25; see also Mary Beth G., supra, at  \n1267, n. 2 (considering strip search of a person arrested for \nhaving outstanding parking tickets and a person arrested \nfor making an improper left turn);  Jones v. Edwards, 770 \nF. 2d 739, 741 (CA8 1985) (same for violation of dog leash \nlaw).  They  include  persons  who  perhaps  should  never\nhave been placed in the general jail population in the first \nplace.  See ante, at 2  (ALITO,  J. concurring) (“admission to \ngeneral jail population, with the concomitant humiliation\nof a strip search, may not be reasonable” for those “whose \ndetention has not been reviewed by a judicial officer and \nwho could not be held in available facilities apart from the \n\n6  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF  \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON   \nBREYER,  J., dissenting  \ngeneral population”).\n  I need not go on.  I doubt that we seriously disagree \nabout the nature of the strip search or about the serious \naffront to human dignity and to individual privacy that it  \npresents.  The basic question before us is  whether such \na search is nonetheless justified when an individual ar-\nrested for a minor offense is involuntarily placed in the \ngeneral jail or prison population. \nIII  \n  The  majority,  like  the  respondents,  argues  that  strip \nsearches are needed (1) to detect injuries or diseases, such \nas lice, that might spread in confinement, (2) to identify \ngang tattoos, which might reflect a need for special hous-\ning to avoid violence, and (3) to detect contraband, includ-\ning drugs, guns, knives, and even pens or chewing gum, \nwhich might prove harmful or dangerous in prison.  In \nevaluating this argument, I, like the majority, recognize: \nthat managing a jail or prison is an “inordinately difficult \nundertaking,” Turner,  482 U. S., at 85;  that prison regula-\ntions that interfere with important constitutional interests \nare generally valid as long as they are “reasonably related \nto legitimate penological interests,” id., at 89; that finding \ninjuries and preventing the spread of disease, minimizing \nthe threat of gang violence, and detecting contraband are \n“legitimate penological interests,” ibid.; and that we nor-\nmally defer to the expertise of jail and prison administra-\ntors in such matters, id., at 85. \n  Nonetheless, the “particular” invasion of interests, Bell, \n441 U. S., at 559, must be “‘reasonably related’” to the jus-\n   \ntifying “penological interest” and the need must not be \n“‘exaggerated.’”  Turner, supra, at 87.  It is at this point \n   \nthat I must part company with the majority.  I have found \nno convincing reason indicating that, in the absence of \nreasonable suspicion, involuntary strip searches of those \narrested for minor offenses are necessary in order to fur-\n\n  Cite as:  566 U. S. ____ (2012)  7 \n \nBREYER,  J., dissenting \nther the penal interests mentioned.  And there are strong \nreasons to believe they are not justified. \n  The lack of justification is fairly obvious with respect to \nthe first two penological interests advanced.  The searches \nalready  employed  at  Essex  and  Burlington  include:  (a) \npat-frisking all inmates; (b) making inmates go through\nmetal  detectors  (including  the  Body  Orifice  Screening \nSystem (BOSS) chair used at Essex County Correctional \nFacility that identifies metal hidden within the body); (c) \nmaking  inmates  shower  and  use  particular  delousing \nagents  or  bathing  supplies;  and  (d)  searching  inmates’ \nclothing.  In addition, petitioner concedes that detainees\ncould be lawfully subject to being viewed in their under-\ngarments by jail officers or during showering (for security \npurposes).  Brief for  Petitioner 9; Tr. of  Oral Arg. 7–8 \n(“Showering in the presence of officers is not something \nthat  requires  reasonable  suspicion”).    No  one  here  has  \noffered any reason, example, or empirical evidence sug-\ngesting  the  inadequacy  of  such  practices  for  detecting \ninjuries, diseases, or tattoos.  In particular, there is no \nconnection  between  the  genital  lift  and  the  “squat  and\ncough” that Florence was allegedly subjected to and health  \nor gang concerns.  See Brief for Academics on Gang Be-\nhavior as Amici Curiae; Brief for Medical Society of New \nJersey et al. as Amici Curiae. \n  The lack of justification for such a strip search is less \nobvious but no less real in respect to the third interest, \nnamely  that  of  detecting  contraband.  The  information \ndemonstrating the lack of justification is of three kinds. \nFirst, there are empirically based conclusions reached in \nspecific cases.  The New York Federal District Court, to  \nwhich I have referred, conducted a study of 23,000 persons \nadmitted to the Orange County correctional facility be-\ntween 1999 and 2003.  Dodge, 282 F. Supp. 2d, at 69.  \nThese 23,000 persons underwent a  strip search of the kind \ndescribed, supra, at 1.  Of these 23,000 persons, the court \n\n8  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF  \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON   \nBREYER,  J., dissenting  \nwrote, “the County encountered three incidents of drugs \nrecovered from an inmate’s anal cavity and two incidents \nof drugs falling from an inmate’s underwear during the \ncourse of a strip search.”  282 F.  Supp. 2d, at 69.  The \ncourt added that in four of these five instances there may \nhave been “reasonable suspicion” to search, leaving only \none instance in 23,000 in which the strip search policy \n“arguably” detected additional contraband.  Id., at 70.   The  \nstudy is imperfect, for search standards changed during \nthe time it was conducted.  Id., at 50–51.  But the large\nnumber of inmates, the small number of “incidents,” and \nthe District Court’s own conclusions make the study pro-\nbative though not conclusive.\n  Similarly, in Shain v.  Ellison, 273 F. 3d 56, 60 (CA2  \n2001),  the court received data produced by the county \njail showing that authorities conducted body-cavity strip \nsearches, similar to those at issue here, of 75,000 new \ninmates over a period of five years.  Brief for Plaintiff-\nAppellee-Cross-Appellant in No. 00–7061 etc. (CA2), p. 16 \n(citing  to  its  App.  343a–493a).    In  16  instances  the \nsearches led to the discovery of contraband.  The record  \nfurther showed that 13 of these 16 pieces of contraband \nwould have been detected in a patdown or a search of shoes \nand outer-clothing.  In the three instances in  which contra-\nband was found on the detainee’s body or in a body cavity, \nthere was a drug or felony history that would have justi-\nfied a strip search on individualized reasonable suspicion.   \nIbid.; Brief for National Police Accountability Project as  \nAmicus Curiae 10. \n  Second,  there  is  the  plethora  of  recommendations  of \nprofessional bodies, such as correctional associations, that \nhave studied and thoughtfully considered the matter.  The  \nAmerican Correctional Association (ACA)—an association \nthat informs our view of “what is obtainable and what is  \nacceptable in corrections philosophy,” Brown v. Plata, 563 \nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 43)—has promulgated a \n\n  Cite as:  566 U. S. ____ (2012)  9 \n \nBREYER,  J., dissenting \nstandard that forbids suspicionless strip searches.  And \nit has done so after consultation with the American Jail \nAssociation,  National  Sheriff’s  Association,  National  In- \nstitute of Corrections of the Department of Justice, and \nFederal  Bureau  of  Prisons.

Katsampes, Sheriff’s Guide to Effective Jail \nOperations 50 (2007).\n  Moreover, many correctional facilities apply a reason-\nable  suspicion  standard  before  strip  searching  inmates \nentering the general jail population, including the U. S. \nMarshals Service, the Immigration and Customs Service, \nand the Bureau of Indian Affairs.   See U.  S.

The Federal Bureau \n\n10  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON  \nBREYER,  J., dissenting \nof Prisons (BOP) itself forbids suspicionless strip searches \nfor minor offenders, though it houses separately (and does \nnot admit to the general jail population) a person who does \nnot consent to such a search.  See Dept. of Justice, BOP \nProgram  Statement  5140.38,  p. 5.  (2004),  http://www. \nbop.gov/policy/progstat/5140_038.pdf. \n  Third, there is general experience in areas where the \nlaw  has  forbidden  here-relevant  suspicionless  searches.  \nLaws  in  at  least  10  States  prohibit  suspicionless  strip \nsearches.  See, e.g., Mo. Stat. Ann. §544.193.2 (2002) (“No \nperson  arrested  or  detained  for  a  traffic  offense  or  an \noffense which does not constitute a felony may be subject \nto a strip search or a body cavity search . . . unless there is \nprobable cause to believe that such person is concealing a \nweapon . . . or contraband”); Kan. Stat. Ann. §22–2521(a) \n(2007) (similar); Iowa Code §804.30 (2009) (similar); 725 \nIll. Comp. Stat., ch. 725, §5/103–1(c) (2011) (similar but \nrequiring  “reasonable  belief ”);  501  Ky.  Admin.  Regs. \n3:120, §3(1)(b) (2011) (similar); Tenn. Code Ann. §40–7–\n119 (2006) (similar); Colo. Rev. Stat.

Code §10.79.130(1) (2010) (similar). \n  At the same time at least seven Courts of Appeals have \nconsidered  the  question  and  have  required  reasonable\nsuspicion that an arrestee is concealing weapons or con-\ntraband before a strip search of one arrested for a minor \noffense can take place.  See, e.g., Roberts v. Rhode Island, \n239 F. 3d 107, 112–113 (CA1 2001); Weber v.  Dell, 804 \nF. 2d  796,  802  (CA2  1986);  Logan  v.  Shealy,  660  F. 2d \n1007, 1013 (CA4 1981);  Stewart v.

Respondents \nhave  not  presented  convincing  grounds  to  believe  that\nadministration of these legal standards has increased the \nsmuggling of contraband into prison. \n  Indeed, neither the majority’s opinion nor the briefs set \nforth any clear example of an instance in which contra-\nband was smuggled into the general jail population during \nintake that could not have been discovered if the jail was \nemploying a reasonable suspicion standard.  The majority\ndoes  cite  general  examples  from  Atlantic  County  and \nWashington State where contraband has been recovered \nin correctional facilities from inmates arrested for driving \nunder the influence and disorderly conduct.  Ante, at 15.   \nSimilarly, the majority refers to information, provided by \nSan  Francisco  jail  authorities,  stating  that  they  have \nfound  handcuff  keys,  syringes,  crack  pipes,  drugs,  and \nknives  during  body-cavity  searches,  including  during \nsearches of minor offenders, including a man arrested for \nillegally lodging (drugs), and a woman arrested for prosti-\ntution  and  public  nuisance  (“bindles  of  crack  cocaine”).  \nBrief for City and County of San  Francisco et  al. as Amici \nCuriae 7–13; Bull, supra, at  969; ante, at 15.  And associ-\nated statistics indicate that the policy of conducting visual \ncavity searches of all those admitted to the general popu-\nlation in San Francisco may account for the discovery of \ncontraband in approximately 15 instances per year.  Bull, \nsupra, at 969. \n  But neither San Francisco nor the respondents tell us  \nwhether reasonable suspicion was  present or absent in any \nof  the  15  instances.    Nor  is  there  any  showing  by  the \nmajority  that  the  few  unclear  examples  of  contraband \nrecovered in Atlantic County, Washington State, or any-\nwhere else could not have been discovered through a policy \n\n12  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON  \nBREYER,  J., dissenting \nthat required reasonable suspicion for strip searches.  And \nwithout some such indication, I am left without an exam-\nple of any instance in which contraband was found on an \nindividual through an inspection of their private parts or \nbody cavities which could not have been found under a \npolicy requiring reasonable suspicion.  Hence, at a mini-\nmum these examples, including San Francisco’s statistics, \ndo not provide a significant counterweight to those pre-\nsented in Dodge and Shain.  \n  Nor do I find the majority’s lack of examples surprising.  \nAfter  all,  those  arrested  for  minor  offenses  are  often  \nstopped  and  arrested  unexpectedly.  And  they  conse-\nquently will have had little opportunity to hide things in \ntheir body cavities.  Thus, the widespread advocacy by \nprison experts and the widespread application in many \nStates and federal circuits of “reasonable suspicion” re-\nquirements indicates an ability to apply such standards in \npractice without unduly interfering with the legitimate penal \ninterest in preventing the smuggling of contraband. \n  The majority is left with the word of prison officials in\nsupport of its contrary proposition.  And though that word \nis important, it cannot be sufficient.  Cf. Dept. of Justice, \nNational Institute of Corrections, W. Collins,  Jails and the \nConstitution: An Overview 28–29 (2d ed. 2007) (Though \nprison  officials  often  “passionately  believed”  similar  re-\nquirements  would  lead  to  contraband-related  security \nproblems,  once  those  requirements  were  imposed  those \n“problems did not develop”).\n  The majority also relies upon Bell, 441 U. S.  520, itself.  \nAnte, at 5–6.  In that case, the Court considered a prison \npolicy requiring a strip search of all detainees after “con-\ntact visits” with unimprisoned visitors.  441 U. S., at 558.  \nThe Court found that policy justified.  Id., at 560.  Con-\ntrary to the  majority’s suggestion, that case does not pro-\nvide precedent for the proposition that the word of prison \nofficials (accompanied by a “single instance” of empirical  \n\n  Cite as:  566 U. S. ____ (2012)  13  \n \nBREYER,  J., dissenting \nexample)  is  sufficient  to  support  a  strip  search  policy.   \nAnte, at 6.  The majority correctly points out that there \nwas but “one instance” in which the policy had led to the \ndiscovery of an effort to smuggle contraband.  Bell, 441 \nU. S.,  at 558.  But the Court understood that the prison \nhad been open only four months.  Id., at 526.  And the \nCourt  was  also  presented  with  other  examples  where \ninmates attempted to smuggle contraband during contact \nvisits.  Id., at 559. \n  It is true that in Bell the Court found the prison jus-\ntified in conducting postcontact searches even as to pre-\ntrial detainees who had been brought before a magistrate, \ndenied bail, and “committed to the detention facility only \nbecause  no  other  less  drastic  means  [could]  reasonably \nassure [their] presence at trial.”  441 U. S., at 546, n. 28.  \nThe Court recognized that those ordered detained by a\nmagistrate were often those “charged with serious crimes, \nor who have prior records.”  Ibid.  For that reason, those  \ndetainees posed at least the same security risk as con-\nvicted inmates, if not “a greater risk to jail security and \norder,”  and  a  “greater  risk  of  escape.”    Ibid.  And,  of  \ncourse, in Bell, both the inmates at issue and their visitors \nhad the time to plan to smuggle contraband in that case, \nunlike those persons at issue here (imprisoned soon after \nan unexpected arrest). \n  The  Bell  Court  had  no  occasion  to  focus  upon  those \narrested for minor crimes, prior to a judicial officer’s de-\ntermination that they should be committed to prison.  I \nshare JUSTICE ALITO’s intuition that the calculus may be \ndifferent in such cases, given that “[m]ost of those arrested \nfor minor offenses are not dangerous, and most are re-\nleased from custody prior to or at the time of their initial \nappearance before a magistrate.”   Ante, at 2 (concurring \nopinion).  As he notes, this case does not address, and \n“reserves judgment on,” whether it is always reasonable\n“to strip search an arrestee before the arrestee’s detention  \n\n14  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON  \nBREYER,  J., dissenting \nhas been reviewed by a judicial officer.”  Ante, at 3.  In my \nview,  it  is  highly  questionable  that  officials  would  be \njustified, for instance, in admitting to the dangerous world \nof the general jail population and subjecting to a strip \nsearch someone with no criminal background arrested for \njaywalking or another similarly minor crime, supra, at 5.   \nIndeed, that consideration likely underlies why the Fed-\neral Government and many States segregate such individ-\nuals even when admitted to jail, and several jurisdictions \nprovide that such individuals be released without deten-\ntion in the ordinary case.  See,  e.g., Cal. Penal Code Ann. \n§853.6 (West Supp. 2012). \n  In an appropriate case, therefore, it remains open for \nthe Court to consider whether it would be reasonable to  \nadmit an arrestee for a minor offense to the general jail \npopulation, and to subject her to the “humiliation of a strip \nsearch,” prior to any review by a judicial officer.  Ante, at 2 \n(ALITO,  J.,  concurring).  \n*    *    * \n  For the reasons set forth, I cannot find justification for \nthe strip search policy at issue here—a policy that would \nsubject those arrested for minor offenses to serious inva-\nsions of their personal privacy.  I consequently dissent. ",

INTRODUCTION \nThe issue of violence and drug use in this State's jails and prisons is \none of critical importance to Amici Curiae California State Association of \nCounties (\"CSAC\") and the League of California Cities (\"League\").  Local \nI \nlaw enforcement is on the front line in dealing with arrestees.  Pretrial \ndetainees begin their journey through the criminal justice system in our jails. \nThough Amici Curiae are not aware of any comprehensive study involving \ncounty jails and other local detention centers, the State prison system \nillustrates the serious problem of inmates obtaining contraband while \nincarcerated in the general population.  In the latest data available, covering \n2006, there were 14,490 incidents in our State prisons, which is a rate of9.2 \n2 \nincidents per 100 inmates. This is the highest incident rate in more than \ntwenty years.  Of these reported incidents, 1,869 involved assault with a \nweapon, 1,238 involved possession ofa weapon, and 1,005 involved a \ncontrolled substance.  This averages to more than 11 incidents per day in our \nState's prisons involving contraband. \nThe interests of amici curiae are set forth the motion for leave to file \nthis brief. \n2 \nThe statistics in this paragraph are found in: California Prisoners and \nParolees, California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, p. 34 \n(2006) [available at: \nhttp:www.cdcr.ca.goviReports_Research/Offender_Information_ Services _ B \nranch/AnnuallCaIPris/CALPRlSd2006.pdf. \n1 \n\nThe dangers facing our local jail personnel, as well as our residents \nboth visiting and incarcerated in our jails, is apparent from these facts.  To \naddress the documented problem in its jails, the City and County of San \nFrancisco adopted a policy that intruded as minimally as possible.  Detainees \nwere subject to visual searches only when they were to be moved into the \ngeneral population.  The searches involved no touching, occurred in private, \nand were conducted by officers of the same gender. \nIn Bell v.  Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979), the United States Supreme \nCourt held that visual strip searches can be conducted without \nindividualized, reasonable suspicion.  Since then, this Court has reviewed on \nseveral occasions Fourth Amendment challenges to a variety of strip \npolicies, creating a string of cases in which the Court has attempted to \ndistinguish Bell based on a variety of factors.  The result is binding \nprecedent that led the panel in this case to conclude that a strip search \nsimilar in every critical aspect to the one upheld by the Supreme Court in \nBell is unconstitutional. \nJudge Ilcuta, in her concurring opinion, felt compelled by Circuit \nprecedent to reach this result, but urged reconsideration of the Ninth Circuit \ncase law.  (Bull v.  City and County o/San Francisco, 539 F.3d 1193, 1202 \n(2008).)  An en banc Eleventh Circuit recently undertook a similar exercise. \n2 \n\nIt revisited its case law on this subject and concluded \"a policy or practice of \nstrip searching [arrestees] as part of the booking process\" does not violate \nthe Fourth Amendment, \"provided that the searches are no more intrusive on \nprivacy interests than those upheld in the Bell case.\"  (Powell v. Barrett, \n2008 U.S.App.LEXIS 18907 (lIth Cir. Sept. 4, 2008).)3 \nAmici CSAC and the League urge this Court to undertake a similar \nreview.  Rehearing is necessary for two reasons.  First, the panel's holding \ntakes this Court further away from the Supreme Court's ruling in Bell that \nblanket strip searches can be conducted on less than probable cause. \nSecond, the panel's decision is squarely at odds with the Eleventh Circuit's \nrecent holding that a policy or practice of searching all arrestees as part of \nthe process of booking them into the general population of a detention \nfacility is constitutionally permissible.  (Id.) \n/1/ \n3  In Powell v. Barrett, the Eleventh Circuit upheld a policy of the \nFulton County, Georgia jail that required a visual strip search of inmates \nentering or re-entering the general population at that facility.  (Powell, \nsupra, 2008 U.S.App.LEXIS 18907 at *2-3.)  Unlike the policy at issue in \nthis case, the Fulton County policy required inmates to be searched in a \ngroup setting.  (Id. at *5.)  By comparison, San Francisco's policy of private \nsearches is even less intrusive than the policy upheld by the Eleventh Circuit \nin Powell. \n3 \n\nII.  ARGUMENT \nA.  United States Supreme Court Precedent Dictates That Arrestees \nCan Be Subjected To Strip Searches Before Entering the General \nPopulation Without Reasonable Suspicion \nBetween 1974 and 1977, the United States Supreme Court \ndecided three important cases brought by prisoners raising constitutional \nclaims challenging prison regulations or policies.  In Procunier v. Martinez, \n416 U.S. 396 (1974), the Court described the principles that frame an \nanalysis of prisoners' constitutional claims.  First, the regulation or practice \nin question must further \"one or more of the substantial governmental \ninterest of security, order, and rehabilitation.\"  (Id. at 413.)  Second, the \nlimitation of the constitutional freedom \"must be no greater than is necessary \nor essential to the protection ofthe particular governmental interest \ninvolved.\"  (Id. at 413-14.)  The decision was followed by Pell v. Procunier, \n417 U.S. 817 (1974) and Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, \nInc., 433 U.S. 119 (1977), which built upon Martinez in holding that that \nexamination of prisoners' constitutional claims must occur with wide-\nranging deference to prison administrators and authorities.  (Jones, supra, \n417 U.S. at 126-28.)  Taken together, these decisions establish that ajail \nregulation or policy need only further the security interests of the jail to the \n4 \n\nextent necessary, and that the judgment of jail administrators should be \naccorded great deference. \n1.  The Supreme Court Upheld A Policy Strikingly Similar To \nThe Policy At Issue Here \nIn 1979, the Supreme Court decided the seminal case of Bell v. \nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979).  Bell specifically addressed \"the constitutional \nrights of pretrial detainees - those persons who have been charged with a \ncrime but who have not yet been tried on the charge.\" 4  (Id.  at 523.)  Among \nthe complaints brought by the plaintiffs was the institution's practice of \nconducting visual body-cavity searches after contact visits.  (Id. at 527.) \nThe Court followed the holdings in Martinez, Pell and Jones and \nupheld the constitutionality of visual body-cavity searches very similar to \nthe searches involved in the present case.  The Court noted that \n\"[c ] orrections officials testified that visual cavity searches were necessary \nnot only to discovery but also to deter the smuggling of weapons, drugs, and \nother contraband into the institution.\"  (Id.  at 558.)  The Court went on to \nuse standard Fourth Amendment analysis and applied a balancing test in \n4  The facility at issue in Bell included, in addition to pretrial detainees, \n\"inmates ... who are serving generally relatively short sentences in a service \ncapacity, ... witnesses in protective custody, and persons incarcerated for \ncontempt.\"  (Bell, 441 U.S. at 524.)  The policy applied to all of these \ncategories of person.  (Jd.) \n5 \n\nwhich it considered the \"scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in \nwhich it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which \nit is conducted.\"  (Id. at 559.)  This \"balancing test\" examination resulted in \nthe Court's conclusion that blanket strip searches can be conducted on less \nthan probable cause.  (Bell, 441 U.S. at 560.) \n2.  A \"Balancing Test\" Analysis Under Bell v.  Wolfish \nJail detainees may constitutionally be subject to visual strip searches \nwithout individualized, reasonable suspicion.  (Bell v.  Wolfish, supra; \nArruda v Fair, 710 F.2d 886 (1st Cir. 1983)(upholding the constitutionality \nof subjecting inmates to strip search after they receive visitors); Goff v. Nix, \n803 F.2d 358 (8th Cir. 1986)(same).)  The common thread and security \nconcern in cases that have upheld such searches is a detainee's physical \naccess to and contact with the \"outside world.\"  Such contact presents the \nopportunity for contraband to be introduced into the general jail population \nwhere it may result in physical harm to the detainees or jail personnel. \nLikewise, any pretrial detainee who has just been arrested and booked has \nbeen brought into the jail from the \"outside world\" and, presumably, has \nbeen under no supervision prior to arrest and detainment. \n6 \n\nIn Bell, it was noted that it would be extremely hard for a detainee to \nconceal contraband or weapons because the visits took place under \nobservation.  (Bell, 441 US. at 504 (J. Stevens, dissenting).)  Yet the strip \nsearches were constitutional.  The potential for a new arrestee to have \nobtained and secreted illicit contraband is immeasurably greater than that of \nan incarcerated prisoner.  (See Bell v.  Wolfish, 441 US. at 546, n. 28 \n(\"Indeed, it may be that in certain circumstances [pretrial detainees] present \na greater risk to jail security and order\"); Block v. Rutherford, 468 US. 576, \n587 (1984)(\"It is not unreasonable to assume ... that low security risk \ndetainees would be enlisted to help obtain contraband or weapons by their \nfellow irunates\").) \nObviously, every pretrial detainee does not require a strip search \nbecause many are never booked into the general population. However, a \ndetainee who will be introduced into the general jail population is a unique \n]Jroblem, as numerous courts have recognized.  (See Dufrin v. Spreen, 712 \nF.2d 1084, 1087 (6th Cir. 1983)(strip search upheld where a pretrial detainee \nwould ultimately come into contact with the general jail population); \nDobrowolskyj v. Jefferson County, Kentucky, 823 F.2d 955 \n(1987)(upholding a strip search where detainee was not strip searched until \nhis movement into the general population of the jail was imminent). \n7 \n\nCompare Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007,1014 (4th Cir. 1981)(strip search \nunconstitutional where, inter alia, \"[a]t no time would [the plaintiff] or \nsimilar detainees be intermingled with the general jail population\"); Swain v. \nSpinney, 117 F.3d 1, 8 (lst Cir. 1997)(\"There was no risk that [the detainee] \nwould come into contact with other prisoners, or be able to smuggle \ncontraband or weapons into a secure environment\"); Savard v. Rhode Island, \n338 F.3d 23, 29 (1st Cir. 2003)(\"There are important differences between \ndetaining an arrestee in virtual isolation and introducing an arrestee into the \ngeneral population of a maximum security prison.\").) \nB.  Strip Searches Of Pre-Trial Detainees Before Entering The \nGeneral Population Are Consistent With The Balancing Test \nEstablished In Bell. \n1.  There Is A Valid, Rational Connection Between The \nDisputed Policy And The Legitimate Governmental Interest \nOf Preventing Introduction Of Contraband Into The \nGeneral Population. \nPrison administrators are responsible for maintaining internal order \nand discipline, and for securing the safety, security and, to the extent \npossible given realistic constraints, the rehabilitation ofthe imnates \ncommitted to it.  It cannot be disputed that a detention facility has a \nlegitimate penological interest in preventing the introduction of weapons, \ndrugs, money, and other contraband into the general inmate population. \n8 \n\nSuch paraphernalia can present a danger to inmates, guards, staff and \nvisitors, can result in discipline problems, and can inhibit the rehabilitation \nof detainees (particularly with regard to drug use).  The use of strip search is \nboth exceptionally effective and directly related to the goal of keeping the \ngeneral jail population free from dangerous and/or disruptive paraphernalia. \n2.  There Are No Alternative Means Of Exercising The Right \nTo Privacy That Is Implicated By The Disputed Policy. \nA policy such as the one at issue in this case is designed to be as \nunobtrusive as possible.  It is only visual.  There is no touching.  It is \nconducted in private by an officer of the same gender.  The point of a strip \nsearch is to search the subject's private areas for contraband and illicit \nmaterial; any alternative to this invasion would render the policy pointless.5 \nThe intrusion of an individual inmate, though highly personal, is \nsubstantially outweighed by the institutional interest in protecting its staff, \nguards, visitors, and the prison population at large. \nThe policy at issue here goes no farther than is necessary to \naccomplish its stated goals.  There is no evidence in the record that the need \nfor the policy has been exaggerated by corrections officials.  And as \n5 \n\"Where an arrestee is wearing blue jeans or another heavy material, \neven the most thorough patdown search will not necessarily turn up small \nitems such as several hits of LSD on postage stamps, a small rock of crack \ncocaine, or a razor blade.\"  (Kraushaar v. Flanigan, 45 F.3d 1040, 1046 (7th \nCir. 1995). \n9 \n\nestablished above, the judgment of such officials demands judicial \ndeference. \n3.  The Panel's Interpretation Of Detainee's Right to Privacy \nWould Have A Significant Negative Impact On The \nFacility's Guards, Staff, Visitors, and Other Inmates, And \nOn The Allocation Of Prison Resources Generally. \nAs noted above, the latest statistics available from the State prison \nsystem show that incidents involving contraband are shockingly common \nand on the rise.  This situation is a real and dangerous reality in our local \nj ails as well. As the dissent noted, the record in this case is \"replete with \nincidents of jail officials finding contraband during strip searches,\" including \nthose arrested for minor offenses.  (Bull, supra,  539 F.3d at 1206.)  An \namicus brief was also filed by San Mateo County detailing its similar \nexperience with the problem of smuggling contraband.  It is a significant \nissue that jail administrators must address. \nThe purpose of the strip search policy is to prevent the introduction of \nweapons, drugs, money and other illicit material into the general jail \npopulation.  By virtue of this goal, and the nature of the strip search itself, \nthe only possible accommodation would be to limit strip searches to \nsuspicious cases.  This would defeat the goal of the policy.  It is clear, and \nreadily acknowledged by the Supreme Court, that \"inmate attempts to \n10 \n\nsecrete [contraband] into the [detention facilities] by concealing them in \nbody cavities are [well] documented.\"  (Bell, 441 U.S. at 559.) \nAlternative methods of search and detention, such as metal detectors, \nare inherently incapable of revealing the myriad of objects and materials that \na visual search would tum Up.6  Not all weapons are made of metal. \nCertainly paper money, drugs, stamps, cigarettes, and a host of other \nmaterials could pass through such a device undetected.  Ultraviolet and \ninfrared detection devices are similarly unreliable.  Further, said devices are \ncostly, and requiring their purchase would further strain the resources of an \nalready under-funded operation. \nIll.  CONCLUSION \nThe panel's decision has moved the Ninth Circuit beyond the United \nStates Supreme Court's rulings on the issue of pretrial detainee strip \nsearches.  It directly conflicts with case law of another circuit.  And it \ndangerously underestimates the seriousness of the problems faced by local \njails in booking pretrial detainees into the general population.  As such, \n6  It should be noted, however, that \"[g]ovemmental action does not \nhave to be the only alternative or even the best alternative for it to be \nreasonable, to say nothing of constitutional.\"  Bell, 441 U.S. at 542, n. 25. \n11 \n\nAmici Curiae urge this Court to grant San Francisco's petition and affirm the \ncity's strip search policy. \n1.5 \nDated: October  ,2008  Respectfully Submitted, \niii  B.

Plaintiffs seek to enjoin Defendants' search and safety cell \n14  use policies as applied to them.  On January 21, 2004 Plaintiffs filed a Motion for \n15  Preliminary Injunction. \n16  14.  Defendants and Cross-complainants contend that injunctive relief is moot at this time \n17  as the policies applied to Plaintiffs no longer govern search or safety cell procedures \n18  in the San Francisco County Jail.  On January 21, 2004, San Francisco Sheriff \n19  Michael Hennessey adopted two new policies entitled \"Searches\" and \"Safety Cell \n20  Use,\" true copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibits A and B, respeotively. \n21  Plaintiffs were on written notice that defendants intended to adopt these new policies \n22  on January 21,2004 and plaintiffs were invited to review and comment on the draft \n23  policies prior to their implementation.  Plaintiffs nevertheless elected to file a Motion \n24  for Preliminary Injunction on the very day that the new policies were adopted. \n25  15.  Defendants and Cross-complainants further contend that the Sheriff's Department's \n26  \"Searches\" policy adopted on January 21, 2004 satisfies the requirements of \n27  California Penal Code § 4030 and is constitutional under California and federal law. \n28 \nCCSF'S & SHERIFF's Cross-complaint for  4 \nDeclaratory Relief \nUSDC CASE NO.

Defendants and Cross-complainants contend that the Sheriff's Department's \"Safety \n2  Cell Use\" policy satisfies the requirements of the California Code of Regulations \n3  Title 15 and is constitutional under California and federal law. \n4  17.  An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between Defendants and Cross-\n5  complainants and Cross-defendants in that San Francisco asserts that Plaintiffs' \n6  claims for injunctive relief are moot and that the new \"Searches\" and \"Safety Cell \n7  Use\" policies comply with state and federal law . \n8  DECLARATION SOUGHT \n9  18.  In order to resolve this controversy, Defendants and Cross-compiainants request that, \n10  pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §2201, this Court declare the respective rights and duties of the \n11  parties in this matter and, in particular, that the Court declare that:  1) Plaintiffs' and \n12  Cross-defendants' claim for injunctive relief is moot; and 2) the Sheriff's policies \n13  entitled \"Searches\" and \"Safety Cell Use,\" adopted January 21, 2004 and attached \n14  hereto as Exhibits A and B, respectively, comply with state and federal law. \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \nCCSF'S & SHERIFF's Cross-complaint for  5 \nDeclaratory Relief \nUSDC CASE NO.

Under no \ncircumstances shall searches be conducted as a punitive measure. \nPURPOSE:  To comply with state and federal laws and case decisions while maintaining the \nsafety of prisoners, staff and jail facilities. \nDEFINITIONS: \nContraband:  Weapons, drugs, or other items that pose a threat to the safety and security \nof the jail or persons in the jail.  In the jail, contraband also includes any item or article \nnot issued by ajail facility, purchased from the commissary, purchased through other \napproved channels, or approved by the Custody Division Commander or designee.  Any \nauthorized items found altered in any way, except for sharpened pencils, will also be \nconsidered contraband. \nNon-intrusive Sensor and Scanning Device Search:  A search conducted on a clothed \nperson using either a hand-held or walk-through mechanical device or metal detector or \nother non-intrusive detection device. \nPat Search:  A search consisting of a pat down or body frisk of a clothed person, \nincluding examination of pockets, shoes and socks.  A pat search may include the \nremoval and examination of outer clothing including, but not limited to, hats, wigs, coats, \njackets, and multiple layers of bulky clothing. \nPhysical Body Cavity Search:  A physical intrusion into a body cavity, such as the mouth, \nstomach, rectum, or vagina, for the purpose of discovering any object concealed in the \nbody cavity.  This type of search always requires a valid search warrant and must be \nconducted by medical personnel. \nCustody Operations : E-16  Page 1 of8 \n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 63     Filed 01/22/2004     Page 9 of 21(cid:10)\nReasonable Suspicion:  A degree of knowledge based on specific and articulable facts \nsufficient to induce a cautious and reasonable officer to believe that an individual is in \npossession of a weapon or other items of contraband.  A \"hunch\", without more, is \ninsufficient.  A fact or observation, giving rise to a reasonable inference, is necessary. \nReasonable suspicion includes, but is not limited to: \n1.  Physical observations or information received from a reliable source that \nindicate that a person is concealing contraband on their person. \nSecurity Search:  A search focused on certain areas of the jail facility, including the bunk, \nclothing, locker, cell, tank, dormitory, or pod, or any other area within the jail facility or \non the jail grounds.  Prisoners located in, leaving, or returning to an area where a security \nsearch is being conducted may also be subject to search. \nStrip Search:  A search that requires a person to remove or arrange some or all of his or \nher clothing so as to permit a visual inspection of the breasts, buttocks or genitalia of \nsuch person.  A strip search may also include a visual inspection of the person's body \ncavities. \nPROCEDURE \nI.  Pat Searches and Non-Intrusive Sensor and Scanning Device Searches \nA.  Personal Privacy: \n1.

Pat searches of transgender persons should be conducted by a deputy \nwith the same genitalia. \nB.  When Such Searches Are Conducted: \n1.  At intake, the transporting officer will conduct a pat search and a non \nintrusive sensor and scanning device search prior to the booking process. \n2.  Once the booking has been completed, any person not qualifying for a \nstrip searched will be pat searched and scanned with a non-intrusive \nsensor and/or a scanning device as part of the dressing in process prior to \nhousing in a jail facility. \n3.  Pat searches or searches by non-intrusive sensor and/or scanning devices \nmay be conducted on prisoners at any time. \nC.  Searches of Civilians \n1.

The Watch Commander will make every effort to avoid having to order \nthe forcible removal of clothing from a non-compliant prisoner. \n3.  If a prisoner continues to be non-compliant with the order for a strip \nsearch and is nearing 16 hours in the intake jail, the Facility Commander \nshould consult with the Custody Division Commander to determine at \nwhat point the strip search will be conducted with or without compliance \nfrom the prisoner. \n4.

General \nA.  A prisoner will be placed in a safety cell only with the approval of the Facility \nCommander, the Facility Watch Commander or a designated physician as \ndelegated by the Sheriff. \nB.  Safety cells may be used only under the following circumstances: \nPage 1 of5 \n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 63     Filed 01/22/2004     Page 18 of 21(cid:10)\nSafety Cell Use \n1.  When a prisoner is physically combative or otherwise presents an \nimminent danger to others. \n2.  When a prisoner is a danger to self, as determined by actions or words, \nincluding, but not limited to, physical or mental impairment to the point \nof falling down, banging hislher head against the wall, making suicidal \ngestures or threatening to commit suicide. \n3.  When there is reasonable suspicion the prisoner has ingested an injury \ncausing item. \n4.  When a prisoner requests such a placement. \n5.  When Jail Health Services staff recommends a safety cell placement and \nthe Watch Commander concurs after reviewing the basis for the Jail \nHealth Service recommendation. \nC.  The safety cell shall not be used for prisoners who only refuse to be strip searched \nor refuse other orders and do not otherwise meet the criteria for safety cell \nplacement above. \nD.  Only Jail Psychiatric Services staffmay determine a prisoner to be gravely \ndisabled. \nE.  In no case shall the safety cell be used for punishment or as a substitute for \ntreatment. \nII.  Safety Cell Placement \nA.  A supervisor must be present during the placement of a prisoner into the safety \ncell. \nB.  If a prisoner is cooperative, the prisoner should be allowed to walk to the safety \ncell. \nC.  If the prisoner refuses to walk, the restraint chair or some other mobile means, \nsuch as a gurney or wheelchair, should be considered and used, if appropriate. \nD.  Deputies may carry the prisoner as a last resort and in a manner that minimizes \ninjury to staff and prisoner. \nE.  If it is necessary to use force, the degree of force will be within the parameters set \nby the Department's \"Use of Force\" policy. \nF.  The reason for the safety cell placement will determine whether the prisoner is \nstripped of clothing. \n1.  In safety cell placements that result because the prisoner is a danger to \nself or at hislher request, the prisoner will be required to remove all \nclothing and a strip search will be conducted to ensure the prisoner does \nnot have contraband that poses a threat to hislher safety.  The prisoner \nwill immediately be given a safety cell garment and/or safety cell \nblanket. \n2.  Prisoners placed in a safety cell after being determined to be gravely \ndisabled by Jail Psychiatric staff will not be strip searched unless Jail \nPsychiatric staff believe the person may be a danger to self.  Jail \nPage 2 of 5 \n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 63     Filed 01/22/2004     Page 19 of 21(cid:10)\nSafety Cell Use \nPsychiatric staffwill document the reason for the strip search on the \nStrip Search Authorization form and in their psychiatric records. \n3.  In safety cell placements that result because a prisoner is a danger to \nothers, the prisoner will be pat searched before being placed in the safety \ncell.  Clothing will not be removed nor will a strip search be conducted \nunless the supervisor approving the placement can articulate reasonable \nsuspicion that the prisoner has contraband hidden that poses a risk to \nprisoners, staff, or self. \n4.  The approving supervisor must document the reasonable suspicion \njustifying the strip search and complete the Strip Search Authorization \nform.  The form shall be kept on file at the jail facility for one year. \nAfter one year, the records should be put into storage and retained in \naccordance with the department records storage policy. \n5.  Any contraband found must also be documented in an Incident Report to \nbe attached to the Safety Cell Observation form. \nG.  Once the prisoner is in the safety cell, the deputy responsible for the placement \nwill provide the prisoner with the following: \n1.  If in the safety cell as a danger to self or at hislher own request, the \nprisoner will be given a safety cell garment and/or safety cell blanket \nimmediately following the search for contraband. \n2.  For all other safety cell placements, the prisoner may be given an \nexchange of jail clothing or a safety cell garment and/or a safety blanket \nimmediately following the placement, if necessary. \n3.

Subsequently, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which\n8 seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, damages, and punitive damages. \n9 Plaintiffs allege that they were victims of two unconstitutional policies and practices\n10 of the San Francisco County jail system.  First, plaintiffs allege that the County’s policy of\n11 conducting strip searches and body cavity searches1 of arrestees held prior to arraignment\nt\nr\nu 12 without reasonable suspicion that the individual possesses contraband or presents a security\no\nC\n  13 threat violates the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, as\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 well as California law.  Second, plaintiffs allege that the County’s policy of placing pretrial\ns D ct of 15 detainees in “safety cells” as punishment and the blanket policy of strip searching all\nte stri\na Di16 individuals placed in safety cells violate the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 United States Constitution, as well as California law.\nUnit or the 18 The strip search policy in place at the time of plaintiffs’ arrests and searches permitted\nF\n19 the Sheriff’s Department to conduct a strip search of arrestees charged with a crime\n20 involving drugs, weapons or violence and arrestees with a criminal history involving drugs,\n21 weapons or violence (as well as other categories of arrestees not relevant here).  Arrestees\n22 not in those categories could be strip searched if they signed a form consenting to be strip\n23 searched.  Seaton Decl. Ex. 3-5.  \n24 The safety cell policy in place at the time of plaintiffs’ arrests and searches permitted\n25 arrestees to be placed in safety cells in any of the following situations: \n26\n27 1 The Court recognizes that there is a spectrum of possible search practices alleged in this\naction, including strip searches and visual body cavity searches.  However, for simplicity’s sake, the\n28 Court will use “strip search” in this decision to generally cover all of the alleged conduct unless\notherwise specified.  \n2\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 162     Filed 06/10/2004     Page 3 of 20(cid:10)\n1\n1.

Under the policy, any arrestee that is placed in a safety cell, for any\n7 reason, shall be strip searched prior to placement.  Id.\n8 On January 21, 2004, the Sheriff enacted new search and safety cell policies.  Under\n9 the new strip search policy an arrestee may be strip searched at the time of booking only if\n10 “There is articulable reasonable suspicion and supervisor approval on the Strip Search\n11 Authorization Form prior to the strip search”; or the arrestee is charged with a crime of\nt\nr\nu 12 drugs, weapons or violence; or has been convicted or arrested within the last 5 years for\no\nC\n  13 drugs, weapons or violence.

On January\n9 22, 2004, defendants filed a cross-complaint seeking declaratory relief in which this Court\n10 would declare that plaintiffs’ case is moot, and that the Sheriff’s new policies regarding\n11 searches and safety cell use comply with state and federal law. \nt\nr\nu 12 II.

Subsequently, this Court determined that Lazaneo v.\ns D ct of 15 City and County of San Francisco, Case No. 03-46922, Flick v. City and County of San\nte stri\na Di16 Francisco, Case No. 03-4022, and Yourke v. City and County of San Francisco, Case No. 03-\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 3105, are related to Bull.  \nUnit or the 18 The first hearing on the four motions currently before the Court was held on April 9,\nF\n19 2004.  The Court, determining that further oral argument was necessary, also held hearings\n20 on these motions on April 12 and April 13, and then requested supplemental briefing on the\n21 class certification issue.  The motions were then submitted.  \n22 DISCUSSION\n23 I. Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\n24 Plaintiffs have moved for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin several of\n25 defendants’ policies with respect to strip searches, body cavity searches, and the use of safety\n26 cells.  In particular, plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction that does the following:\n27\n28\n2Lazaneo settled on May 11, 2003.\n4\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 162     Filed 06/10/2004     Page 5 of 20(cid:10)\n1 1)  Enjoins pre-arraignment strip searches at any of the San Francisco County\nJails of arrestees charged with crimes not involving drugs, violence or weapons\n2 unless a) there is particularized reasonable suspicion that a search willbe\nproductive of contraband or a weapon, b) the basis for that reasonable\n3 suspicion is recorded in writing and c) the search is approved by a supervisor\nprior to the search being conducted;\n4\n2)  Enjoins pre-arraignment placement into safety cells of arrestees unless there\n5 has been a prior determination by a licensed professional that the arrestee has\ndemonstrated behavior which reveals an intent to cause physical harm to\n6 himself/herself or others;\n7 3)  Enjoins strip searches of persons placed in safety cells;\n8 4)  Enjoins removal of the clothing of persons placed in safety cells unless a\nlicensed professional has determined that the arrestee is likely to use the\n9 clothing to harm himself.\n10 Plaintiffs’ Memorandum in Support of Preliminary Injunction (“Plaintiff’s P.I. Memo.”) at 1.\n11 As stated in open court, this Court denies plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary\nt\nr\nu 12 injunction because plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that they will be exposed to a\no\nC\n  13 significant risk of irreparable injury or immediate threatened injury under the new policy\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 enacted by the Sheriff on January 21, 2004.  On a motion for a preliminary injunction, the\ns D ct of 15 Court is looking at whether an extraordinary remedy shall be put in place based on a threat of\nte stri\na Di16 irreparable injury to the plaintiffs.  There must be some imminence involved, otherwise the\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 litigation can proceed through its normal course.  While plaintiffs argue that defendants’\nUnit or the 18 history of ignoring its written policies demonstrates that even though there is a new policy in\nF\n19 place there is a likelihood that defendants will not follow the new policy, the Court does not\n20 agree that there is an immediate threat of harm.  \n21 Given the new policy enacted by defendants, this Court finds no imminent threat of\n22 injury, and concludes that a preliminary injunction is not needed to preserve the status quo\n23 and prevent irreparable loss of rights before judgment.\n24 II. Defendants’ Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings\n25 Defendants’ cross-complaint seeks an order from this Court declaring that the San\n26 Francisco Sheriff’s Department’s policies entitled “Searches” and “Safety Cell Use,” adopted\n27 January 21, 2004, do not violate the United States Constitution or California state law. \n28 Defendants have moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\n5\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 162     Filed 06/10/2004     Page 6 of 20(cid:10)\n1 Procedure 12(c) of their cross complaint.  Plaintiffs offer two arguments why this motion\n2 should be denied.  First, they argue that defendants’ cross-complaint is not ripe for\n3 adjudication, thus stripping the Court of jurisdiction over the cross-complaint.  Second, they\n4 argue that the Court should deny the motion because defendants have failed to provide an\n5 adequate factual basis to establish the legality of the new policies.\n6 As stated in open court, the Court agrees with plaintiffs that judgment on the\n7 pleadings is not warranted.  The Court declines to issue an advisory opinion as to the legality\n8 of the new strip search policy.  Additionally, in order to adjudicate this matter, the Court\n9 must consider numerous factual issues, including the scope of the particular intrusion, the\n10 manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is\n11 conducted.  The Court is unable to make such factual determination on the pleadings alone;\nt\nr\nu 12 thus, defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c) is denied. \no\nC\n  13 III. Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 Summary judgment is proper when “the pleadings, depositions, answers to\ns D ct of 15 interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is\nte stri\na Di16 no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  An issue is “genuine” only if there is a sufficient\nUnit or the 18 evidentiary basis on which a reasonable fact finder could find for the nonmoving party, and a\nF\n19 dispute is “material” only if it could affect the outcome of the suit under governing law.  See\n20 Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248-49 (1986).  A principal purpose of the\n21 summary judgment procedure “is to isolate and dispose of factually unsupported claims.” \n22 Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323-24 (1986).  “Where the record taken as a whole\n23 could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no ‘genuine\n24 issue for trial.’”  Matsushita Elec. Ind. Co. v. Zenith Radio, 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986).\n25 There are presently nine named plaintiffs in this suit.  Defendants have moved for\n26 partial summary judgment as follows: (1) on all state and federal stip search claims brought\n27 by plaintiffs Zern, Corneau, Bronson, and Giampaoli (Counts One, Three, and Four); (2) on\n28 //\n6\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 162     Filed 06/10/2004     Page 7 of 20(cid:10)\n1 all state law strip search claims by plaintiffs Bull and Timbrook (Counts Three and Four);\n2 and (3) on all claims by plaintiff Johnson (Counts One through Five).  \n3 Plaintiffs do not oppose the grant of partial summary judgment in favor of defendants\n4 and against plaintiffs Bull, Timbrook, and Giampaoli on their claims under California Penal\n5 Code section 4030 (Count Four), nor do they oppose a grant of partial summary judgment in\n6 favor of defendants and against plaintiff Johnson on all claims.  Accordingly, the Court\n7 GRANTS IN PART defendants’ motion as to those issues not opposed by plaintiffs.\n8 The parties continue to dispute defendants’ motion with respect to plaintiff\n9 Giampaoli’s federal and remaining state strip search claims (Counts One and Three),\n10 plaintiffs Zern, Corneau, and Bronson’s state and federal claims (Counts, One, Three, and\n11 Four), and plaintiffs Bull and Timbrook’s remaining state claims (Counts Three and Five).3 \nt\nr\nu 12 As stated in open court, the Court concludes that summary judgment is not appropriate\no\nC\n  13 at this time because there are still numerous material factual, as well as legal, issues that are\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 in dispute.  Accordingly, the Court DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE the remaining portions\ns D ct of 15 of defendants’ motion for summary judgment.  Such issues will be addressed in further\nte stri\na Di16 proceedings.  \nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 IV. Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification\nUnit or the 18 A. Legal Standard for Class Certification\nF\n19 Class certification is governed by Rule 23, which sets forth a two-step procedure. \n20 First, the following four requirements of Rule 23(a) must be satisfied: (1) numerosity, (2)\n21 common questions of law or fact are present, (3) typicality, and (4) adequate representation. \n22 Once those four requirements are met, the plaintiffs must show that the lawsuit qualifies for\n23 class action status under one of the four possibilities found in Rule 23(b).  \n24 Plaintiffs seek to certify a class under Rule 23(b)(3), which is appropriate where the\n25 court “finds that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class\n26 predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is\n27\n28 3Defendants have not moved for summary judgment with respect to plaintiffs Mangosing and\nFleming.  \n7\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 162     Filed 06/10/2004     Page 8 of 20(cid:10)\n1 superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.”\n2 Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 23(b)(3).  \n3 Plaintiffs bear the burden of proving that certification is appropriate.  See Hawkins v.\n4 Comparet-Cassani, 251 F.3d 1230, 1238 (9th Cir. 2001).  The court must rigorously analyze\n5 whether the class action allegations meet the requirements of Rule 23.  General Telephone\n6 Co. of the Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 161 (1982).  “Because the early resolution of\n7 the class certification question requires some degree of speculation, however, all that is\n8 required is that the Court form a ‘reasonable judgment’ on each certification requirement.  In\n9 formulating this judgment, the Court may properly consider both the allegations of the class\n10 action complaint and the supplemental evidentiary submissions of the parties.”  In re Citric\n11 Acid Antitrust Litigation, 1996 WL 655791 *2 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 2, 1996).  \nt\nr\nu 12 B. Analysis\no\nC\n  13 Plaintiffs propose that the following class of persons be certified as a class under Rule\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 23(b)(3):\ns D ct of 15\nte stri For the claims brought under 42 USC § 1983 (Count One of the First\na Di16 Amended Complaint); the California Constitution, Article I §1 (Count Three of\nSt ern  the First Amended Complaint); and California Penal Code § 4030(f) (Count\n  h\nUnited or the Nort1178 Fcstloaautiemrd os  hfi enthrceeliu nFd;i ert shbte oA tPhme fneeanllod Cneydo  daCeno d§m  m4p0ils3adi0ne tcm)l;ae tiahmneo  isrnt acatlreure dasentsed em fse iwsddeietrham lt ehcaoen neosxrt ciateurprteitoisontneassls\nF only:\n19\nAll persons who, during the applicable period of limitations, and\n20 continuing to date, were arrested on any charge not involving weapons,\ncontrolled substances, or a felony charge of violence, and not involving a\n21 violation of parole or a violation of probation (where consent to search is a\ncondition of such probation), and who were subjected to a blanket visual body\n22 cavity strip search by defendants before arraignment at a San Francisco County\nJail facility without any individualized reasonable suspicion that they were\n23 concealing contraband.  This class also includes 1) all arrestees who were\nsubjected to subsequent blanket strip search(es) before arraignment after the\n24 initial strip search, without any reasonable individualized suspicion that they\nhad subsequently acquired and hidden contraband on their persons; and 2) all\n25 persons who, prior to arraignment, were subjected to blanket visual body cavity\nsearch(es) incident to placement in a “safety cell” at any of the San Francisco\n26 County Jails.\n27 Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification at 1. \n28 //\n8\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 162     Filed 06/10/2004     Page 9 of 20(cid:10)\n1 Defendants argue that plaintiffs have not met the requirements of Rule 23(a) and Rule\n2 23(b)(3).  In particular, defendants argue that plaintiffs’ claims are not typical of the class\n3 and that the individual fact questions far outnumber the common questions such that the\n4 predominance and superiority elements of Rule 23(b)(3) are not met.  Additionally,\n5 defendants argue that plaintiffs’ state law claims cannot be certified as a class.  \n6 “The Rule 23(b)(3) predominance inquiry tests whether proposed classes are\n7 sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.”  Amchem Products Inc. v.\n8 Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 623 (1997).  \n9 The crux of defendants argument against class certification is that the issues involved\n10 in this litigation entail detailed individualized determinations.  They argue that the individual\n11 background of the plaintiffs make it difficult to determine whether someone is a member of\nt\nr\nu 12 the class, in addition to the more pressing question of whether that person’s rights have been\no\nC\n  13 violated.  The determination of whether the plaintiffs suffered an illegal strip search involves\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 a determination of whether the institutional strip search policy in place was unlawful. \ns D ct of 15 However, even if the policy is unconstitutional, defendants argue that the individual\nte stri\na Di16 plaintiff’s rights may not have been violated if the search was done based on reasonable\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 suspicion.  Thus, according to defendants, plaintiffs have not met the predominance element\nUnit or the 18 of Rule 23(b)(3) because even if the constitutionality of the institutional policy is the same\nF\n19 for all plaintiffs, whether there was reasonable suspicion for each search will depend on the\n20 individual circumstances involved.  \n21 Defendants argument does not defeat class certification.  The arguments presented by\n22 defendants are virtually the same arguments that were presented by the defendants in Tardiff\n23 v. Knox County, 365 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2004), where the First Circuit affirmed the\n24 certification of class actions in similar challenges to county strip search policies.  Tardiff was\n25 a consolidation of two district court cases in which several arrestees brought separate section\n26 1983 suits against two different counties alleging that the policies of conducting routine,\n27 suspicionless strip searches of all pre-arraignment jail detainees was unconstitutional.  Id. at\n28 2.  Both district courts granted the plaintiffs’ motions for class certification.  Id.  On appeal,\n9\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 162     Filed 06/10/2004     Page 10 of 20(cid:10)\n1 the First Circuit determined that while some individualized evaluations may be necessary,\n2 overall it could be assumed that the plaintiffs were searched based on the county’s custom or\n3 policy, and any individual questions did not defeat certification.  Id. at 5-6.  Defendants argue\n4 that Tardiff is not applicable to this case because, unlike Tardiff, the nature of the strip\n5 search policy is not at issue here.  The Court disagrees and finds the reasoning in Tardiff to\n6 be persuasive.\n7 Similar to Tardiff, what really is at issue here is the constitutionality of the policies\n8 and practices of the Sheriff’s Department, which were applied to all class members.  While\n9 the “nature” of the department’s policy and practices is not at issue, the legality of those\n10 policy and practices is.  The common legal question presented by the members of the\n11 proposed class of whether the Sheriff’s strip search policy is unconstitutional predominates\nt\nr\nu 12 this action, and the allegations of the named plaintiffs closely track the claims of the class\no\nC\n  13 and share a common legal theory.  Given the alleged uniform and indiscriminate nature of the\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 strip search policy and practice at issue, including the practice of strip searching all those\ns D ct of 15 placed in safety cells, it appears that liability can be determined on a class-wide rather than\nte stri\na Di16 an individual basis. \nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 However, the Court agrees with defendants that the class definition must specifically\nUnit or the 18 exclude all persons arrested on a charge of violence, regardless of whether it is a felony or\nF\n19 misdemeanor charge of violence.  The class definition should be amended accordingly.  \n20 As such, the class definition itself will address some of defendants’ concerns because\n21 it does not include those plaintiffs arrested on charges involving weapons, controlled\n22 substances, or a felony charge of violence.  As the Tardiff court noted, the legality of the\n23 strip search policy presents complicated issues because it might be lawful as to some groups\n24 of arrestees and not others, but that issue is somewhat addressed by limiting the class\n25 definition to certain arrestees.  365 F.3d at 5.  Moreover, although it may still be determined\n26 that it was permissible to strip search some within the group of arrestees that remain in the\n27 class, that determination presents a common set of issues that is proper for resolution on a\n28 class-wide basis.  Id.    \n10\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 162     Filed 06/10/2004     Page 11 of 20(cid:10)\n1 The class includes only those subjected to a blanket visual body cavity strip search\n2 without any individualized reasonable suspicion that they were concealing contraband. \n3 Thus, those that were subjected to searches based on individualized reasonable suspicion are\n4 not included in the class.  The issue of whether a post hoc determination of reasonable\n5 suspicion is sufficient to avoid a constitutional violation will not be addressed at this time. \n6 Nonetheless, even if there is a post hoc determination of reasonable suspicion, that does not\n7 mean that an individual was not searched pursuant to a blanket visual body cavity strip\n8 search, the constitutionality of which will be determined in this litigation.   \n9 As stated in Tardiff:\n10\nWithout prejudging disputable issues, we think that such threats of undue\n11 complications as to liability are limited in this case.  If there was in fact a rule, custom\nt or policy of strip searching every arrestee or a substantially overlarge category, then it\nr\nu 12 is a fair guess that most arrestees so classed were strip searched on this basis.  There\no\nC might yet be some number as to who defensible individual judgments to strip search\n  13 were actually made or could have been made--two different situations with different\nt\nic nia legal implications; but whoever has the burden of identifying such person, they may\nistr Califor14 well not be numerous.  \ns D ct of 15 Id. at 6.  \nte stri\na Di16 The situation in this case is even more appropriate for class certification because\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 defendants acknowledge that there was a rule, custom, or policy in place regarding strip\nUnit or the 18 searches, and it is this policy that plaintiffs challenge.  Thus, it is a fair guess that most\nF\n19 arrestees were searched on that basis.  Nonetheless, this Court agrees with the reasoning of\n20 the Tardiff court that any potential individualized issues can be addressed later in the\n21 litigation and do not defeat class certification. \n22 This Court also agrees with the Tardiff court that the “individualized damage\n23 decisions [do] not ordinarily defeat predominance where there are still disputed common\n24 issues as to liability.”  Id.  \n25 There are still numerous questions that need to be resolved, such as whether it is\n26 constitutional to have a blanket policy that allows the Sheriff’s Department to search all\n27 those charged with crimes of violence to visual body cavity searches; how to define crimes of\n28 violence that would warrant such searches; and whether it is constitutional to have a blanket\n11\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 162     Filed 06/10/2004     Page 12 of 20(cid:10)\n1 policy to search all those placed in safety cells.  Regardless, whatever is decided on those\n2 issues, would seemingly affect all class members.\n3 As to superiority, at this stage it is apparent that the resolution of the liability and\n4 damages issues within the context of a class action is likely to be a far more efficient method\n5 of adjudication than the individual assertion of lawsuits grounded on similar sets of facts.   \n6 Based on the information that is currently before the Court, the Court finds that\n7 individualized issues will arise only in a limited number of cases.  Accordingly, the Court\n8 concludes that all of the requirements of Rule 23 have been met and certification of a class is\n9 warranted.  \n10 Importantly, however, “Determinations to certify a class depend on initial predication\n11 and are always subject to revision.”  Tardiff, 365 F.3d at 6 (citing General Telephone Co.,\nt\nr\nu 12 457 U.S. at 160).  This Court can always decertify the class should that become necessary.  \no\nC\n  13 CONCLUSION\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 For the foregoing reasons, the Court hereby DENIES plaintiffs’ motion for a\ns D ct of 15 preliminary injunction, DENIES defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings,\nte stri\na Di16 GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE IN PART defendants’ motion\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 for partial summary judgment, and GRANTS plaintiffs’ motion for class certification.\nUnit or the 18 Accordingly, the Court certifies the following class:\nF\n19 All persons who, during the applicable period of limitations, and continuing to date,\n20 were arrested on any charge not involving weapons, controlled substances, or a charge of\n21 violence, and not involving a violation of parole or a violation of probation (where consent to\n22 search is a condition of such probation), and who were subjected to a blanket visual body\n23 cavity strip search by defendants before arraignment at a San Francisco County jail facility\n24 without any individualized reasonable suspicion that they were concealing contraband.

Safety Cell Policy Issued January 21, 2004\n23 POLICY: It is the policy of the San Francisco Sheriff’s Department to use safety\ncells only when necessary to hold those prisoners who display behavior\n24 which reveals an intent to cause physical harm to self or others.\n25 DEFINITIONS:\nCombative: A prisoner whose behavior requires physical restraint by one or\n26 more deputies to prevent harm to himself or herself, to staff and/or to other\nprisoners.\n27\nDanger to Self: A prisoner making overt gestures to harm himself or herself or\n28 who articulates a strong desire to harm himself or herself.\n18\nG:\\CRBALL\\2003\\1840\\Order 2 class cert etc.wpd\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 162     Filed 06/10/2004     Page 19 of 20(cid:10)\n1 Danger to Others: A prisoner whose behavior is likely to cause harm to staff or\nother prisoners.\n2\n* * * \n3\nSafety Cell: A padded single cell[.]\n4\nPROCEDURE:\n5\nI. General\n6\nA. A prisoner will be placed in a safety cell only with the approval of the\n7 Facility Commander, the Facility Watch Commander or a designated\nphysician as delegated by the Sheriff.\n8\nB. Safety cells may be used only under the following circumstances:\n9\n1. When a prisoner is physically combative or otherwise presents an\n10 imminent danger to others.  \n11 2. When a prisoner is a danger to self, as determined by actions or\nt words,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  physical  or  mental\nr\nu 12 impairment to the point of falling down, banging his/her head\no\nC against  the  wall,  making  suicidal  gestures  or  threatening  to\n  13 commit suicide.\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 3.

The safety cell shall not be used for prisoners who only refuse to be strip\n19 searched or refuse other orders and do not otherwise meet the criteria for\nsafety cell placement above.  \n20\nD. Only Jail Psychiatric Services staff may determine a prisoner to be\n21 gravely disabled.\n22 E. In no case shall the safety cell be used for punishment or as a substitute\nfor treatment. \n23\nII. Safety Cell Placement\n24\n* * *\n25\nF. The reason for the safety cell placement will determine whether the\n26 prisoner is stripped of clothing.\n27 1. In safety cell placements that result because the prisoner is a\ndanger to self or at his/her request, the prisoner will be required\n28 to remove all clothing and a stip search will be conducted to\nensure the prisoner does not have contraband that poses a threat\n19\nG:\\CRBALL\\2003\\1840\\Order 2 class cert etc.wpd\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 162     Filed 06/10/2004     Page 20 of 20(cid:10)\n1 to his/her safety.  The prisoner will immediately be given a\nsafety cell garment and/or safety cell blanket.\n2\n2. Prisoners placed in a safety cell after being determined to be\n3 gravely  disabled  by  Jail  Psychiatric  staff  will  not  be  strip\nsearched unless Jail Psychiatric staff believe the person may be\n4 a danger to self.  Jail Psychiatric staff will document the reason\nfor the strip search on the Strip Search Authorization form and in\n5 their psychiatric records.\n6 3. In safety cell placements that result because a prisoner is a\ndanger to others, the prisoner will be pat searched before being\n7 placed in the safety cell. Clothing will not be removed nor will\na strip search be conducted unless the supervisor approving the\n8 placement can articulate reasonable suspicion that the prisoner\nhas contraband hidden that poses a risk to prisoners, staff, or self.\n9\n4. The  approving  supervisor  must  document  the  reasonable\n10 suspicion  justifying  the  strip  search  and  complete  the  Strip\nSearch Authorization form.  The form shall be kept on file at the\n11 jail facility for one year.  After one year, the records should be\nt put into storage and retained in accordance with the department\nr\nu 12 records storage policy.\no\nC\n  13 5.

Plaintiffs seek an\n26\nPage 1 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\n1 order declaring illegal defendants’ policy of subjecting detainees in their custody to strip and visual\n2 body cavity searches before they are arraigned and without having any reasonable suspicion that the\n3 searches will be productive of contraband. \n4 Plaintiffs also seek declaratory and injunctive relief, damages, and punitive damages against\n5 the defendants for the policy, practice, and custom of placing detainees, naked, in rooms referred to as\n6 “cold rooms,” without any legitimate purpose, but in order to compel consent to illegal strip searches,\n7 to punish persons who question illegal practices, or for other illegal purposes.  These cold rooms are\n8 kept bone chillingly cold, lack access to natural light and are devoid of furniture and running water. \n9 The cold rooms are constantly illuminated by flourescent lighting and persons confined in them can\n10 only sit or lie on the bare floor.  Defendants’ use of the “cold rooms” violates Sections 1055 and 1083\n11 of Title 15 of the California Code of Regulations which specify that isolation or “safe rooms” which\n12 may have legitimate psychological uses cannot be used for punishment and that persons confined\n13 therein must be provided with adequate bedding and clothing. \n14 Defendants’ strip search, visual body cavity search, and cold room policies, practices, and\n15 customs violate plaintiffs’ rights secured to them by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the\n16 U.S. Constitution and entitle plaintiffs to recover damages under the Federal Civil Rights Act (42\n17 U.S.C. § 1983).  \n18 Additionally, plaintiffs include supplemental claims under California state law against\n19 defendants: 1) for violation of California Penal Code § 4030 which prohibits pre-arraignment strip\n20 searches of most misdemeanents and provides for minimum damages of $1,000 for each illegal search;\n21 2) for wholesale violation of Sections 1055 and 1083 of Section 15 of the California Code of\n22 Regulations (promulgated under the authority of California Penal Code § 6030) which describes the\n23 very narrow conditions under which a cold room can be used; and, 3) for violation of the Unruh Civil\n24 Rights Act (California Civil Code §§ 52 and 52.1(b)) pursuant to which each plaintiff denied a\n25 statutory or state or federal Constitutional right is entitled to recover a minimum of $4,000 for each\n26 violation.  \nPage 2 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\n1 JURISDICTION\n2 1. This action is brought pursuant to 42 USC § 1983 and 1988, and the Fourth and\n3 Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  Jurisdiction is founded upon 28 USC §\n4 1331 and 1341(3) and (4) and the aforementioned statutory and constitutional provisions.  \n5 2. The court has supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ state claims under 28 USC §\n6 1367(a).\n7 3. The amount in controversy exceeds $10,000, excluding interest and costs.\n8 PARTIES\n9 4. Plaintiffs, including MARY BULL and JONAH ZERN, and all those similarly situated,\n10 are, and at all material times herein, were citizens of the United States and residents of the state of\n11 California who were arrested within the period beginning three (3) years before February 10, 2003,\n12 and continuing to this date, and who were subjected to strip and/or visual body cavity searches at a\n13 San Francisco County Jail (hereinafter referred to as the “San Francisco Jail”), prior to being arraigned\n14 and/or without the defendants first having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the\n15 searches would be productive of contraband or weapons.\n16 5. Some plaintiffs, including MARY BULL, were confined by defendants in “cold rooms”\n17 at the San Francisco Jail to coerce compliance with illegal orders or for punishment in violation of\n18 their state and federal statutory and constitutional rights. \n19 6. Defendant CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO SHERIFF MICHAEL\n20 HENNESSEY is, and at all material times referred to herein, was the duly elected Sheriff of the city\n21 and county of San Francisco, responsible for administering the Jail facilities and for making,\n22 overseeing, and implementing the policies, practices, and customs challenged herein relating to the\n23 operation of the San Francisco Jail.  He is sued in his individual and official capacities.\n24 7. Defendants SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY SHERIFF DEPUTIES sued herein by their\n25 fictitious names (Does 1 through 150) are all deputies who, as part of their duties at the San Francisco\n26 Jails, subjected plaintiffs to pre-arraignment strip and/or visual body cavity searches without first\nPage 3 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\n1 having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of\n2 contraband or weapons.   Furthermore, Defendants SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY SHERIFF\n3 DEPUTIES sued herein by their fictitious names (Does 101 through 150) are all deputies who, as part\n4 of their duties at the San Francisco Jail, confined plaintiffs in “cold rooms” to gain compliance with\n5 illegal order or to punish plaintiffs.  \n6 8. At all material times mentioned herein, each of the defendants was acting under the\n7 color of law, to wit, under color of statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies, customs and usages of\n8 the State of California, the CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO and/or the SAN\n9 FRANCISCO COUNTY SHERIFF . \n10 9. Defendant CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO is, and at all material times\n11 referred to herein, was, a division of the state of California, that maintained or permitted an official\n12 policy or custom or practice causing or permitting the occurrence of the types of wrongs complained\n13 of herein, which wrongs damaged plaintiffs as herein alleged.  Plaintiffs’ allegations against the\n14 COUNTY are based on acts and omissions of the SHERIFF and his deputies and on acts and\n15 omissions of persons who are COUNTY employees, and on the COUNTY’s breach of its duty to\n16 protect plaintiffs from the wrongful conduct of said persons and employees.\n17 10. Defendants SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT and SAN\n18 FRANCISCO COUNTY SHERIFF MICHAEL HENNESSEY, in his individual and official capacity,\n19 also maintained or permitted an official policy or custom or practice causing or permitting the\n20 occurrence of the types of wrongs complained of herein, which wrongs damaged plaintiffs as herein\n21 alleged.\n22 11. Class action plaintiffs are those similarly situated who, during the period beginning\n23 three (3) years before February 10, 2003, and continuing to this date, were subjected by defendants to\n24 pre-arraignment strip and/or visual body cavity searches without defendants having, and recording in\n25 writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or weapons. \n26 Some of the similarly situated plaintiffs were placed by defendants in “cold rooms,” in order to\nPage 4 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\n1 compel compliance with illegal orders or as punishment and without defendants meeting the\n2 requirements governing the use of such rooms.\n3 FACTS\n4 12. On or about November 18, 2002, plaintiff MARY BULL, along with many others, was\n5 arrested at a demonstration on Market Street, in San Francisco and charged with vandalism.  Ms.\n6 BULL was taken to the San Francisco Jail, arriving in mid-afternoon.  At approximately 6:00 p.m.,\n7 Ms. BULL was taken to an area to be “dressed-in.” A Sheriff’s deputy (Doe 1) prepared an inventory\n8 of Ms. BULL’s clothing and directed Ms. BULL to sign three documents, one of which was a consent\n9 to strip search which Ms. BULL refused to sign.  Her “dress-in” was terminated, and she was returned\n10 to a holding cell and held for a “classification” interview.  \n11 13. Three hours later, Ms. BULL  was returned to a dress-in room and again directed to\n12 consent to a visual body cavity search. Upon her refusal to consent to the visual body cavity search,\n13 Ms. BULL was taken from the “dress-in” area, to the center of the “bull pen” where she was\n14 confronted by several officers, male and female, one of whom told her that if she did not voluntarily\n15 submit to a visual body cavity search she would be thrown into a cold room, naked, for 24 hours. \n16 When Ms. BULL again declined to submit to the visual body cavity search, defendants moved her into\n17 the “cold room,” where she was subjected to a forcible visual body cavity search by Does 2 through 5. \n18 14. During the search, a male deputy (Doe 2) entered the room and watched as Ms.\n19 BULL’s clothes were pulled off, three deputies (Does 3 through 5) forced her to lie on her back,\n20 naked, bent her legs towards her chest, and visually inspected her genital and rectal areas.  Ms. BULL\n21 was then left naked in the “cold room” and the metal door shut.\n22 15. While Ms. BULL was in the “cold room,” she was shocked every few minutes by a\n23 sheriff’s deputy (Does 6 through 10) smashing a baton repeatedly against the door. The smashing of\n24 the baton on the unfurnished “cold room’s” metal door caused an unbearably loud, nerve-shattering\n25 noise, that prevented Ms. BULL from sleeping or resting and caused her to suffer extreme anxiety and\n26 emotional distress.\nPage 5 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\n1 16. During her time in the “cold room,” Ms. BULL was provided with neither clothing for\n2 her personal privacy nor with blankets or bedding as for a modicum of comfort.  Ms. BULL is\n3 informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Defendants have a policy, practice, and custom of\n4 utilizing confinement in the “cold room” as punishment for non-violent, non-suicidal, and non-\n5 destructive detainees who are dubbed “non-compliant” and that such a policy, practice, and custom\n6 violates the Constitution and laws of the State of California and the United States of America. \n7 17. At approximately 9:00 a.m. on November 19, 2002, Ms. BULL was removed from the\n8 “cold room,” issued some prison clothing, and placed in a holding cell with other detainees.  She was\n9 interviewed for release on her own recognizance and taken upstairs where she was again directed to\n10 consent to a visual body cavity search by Doe 11.  Again, Ms. BULL is informed and believes, and\n11 thereon alleges, that defendants had no reasonable suspicion that a visual body cavity search would\n12 result in the discovery of contraband or weapons.\n13 18.  Ms. BULL explained to Doe 11 that the California and United States’ Constitutions\n14 and the state penal code preclude such strip searches and declined to cooperate.  Ms. BULL was taken\n15 into another “cold room,” and again subjected to a forcible visual body cavity search by Does 11\n16 through 15.  Ms. BULL was left naked in the “cold room” and later assigned to a cell with\n17 approximately eight bunkbeds.   At about 10:00 p.m., more than 30 hours after she was arrested, Ms.\n18 BULL was released on her own recognizance having never been arraigned.\n19 19. On or about January 18, 2003, plaintiff JONAH ZERN was arrested along with others\n20 at a peace rally in San Francisco.  Mr. ZERN was taken to the San Francisco Jail where he held for\n21 two days before being released on his own recognizance without being arraigned.  Shortly after his\n22 arrival at the San Francisco Jail, Mr. ZERN was taken to a curtained off area where a Sheriff’s deputy,\n23 Doe 16, directed him to remove all his clothes.  The Sheriff’s deputy, Doe 16, then conducted a visual\n24 body cavity search of Mr. ZERN wherein Mr. ZERN had to bend over, spread his buttocks, and cough. \n25 Mr. ZERN is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that defendants had no reasonable suspicion\n26\nPage 6 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\n1 that a visual body cavity search would result in the discovery of contraband or weapons. On or about\n2 January 23, 2003, the charges filed against Mr. ZERN were dismissed.  \n3 20. Within six months of her arrest, plaintiff MARY BULL filed a group government tort\n4 claim for herself and for all persons similarly situated (a copy of said claim is attached hereto as\n5 Exhibit A, and incorporated herein to the extent relevant by this reference).  Plaintiff BULL’s group\n6 claim was denied on or about April 7, 2003, allowing the filing of this Complaint.  \n7 21. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that defendants routinely follow\n8 their policy, practice, and custom of subjecting pre-arraignment detainees, including plaintiffs, to strip\n9 and visual body cavity searches without having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that\n10 the search will be productive of contraband or weapons.  \n11 22. Plaintiffs are further informed and believe, and thereon allege, that defendants routinely\n12 follow their policy, practice and custom of confining detainees, including plaintiffs, in “cold rooms” in\n13 order to compel compliance with illegal orders or as punishment.\n14 23. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that defendants have the ability\n15 to identify all such similarly situated plaintiffs, specifically those who, while in defendants’ custody, at\n16 the San Francisco Jail since February 10, 2000, were subjected to strip searches and/or visual body\n17 cavity searches prior to arraignment without defendants first having, and recording, a reasonable\n18 suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or weapons.\n19 24. Plaintiffs are further informed and believe, and thereon allege, that defendants have the\n20 ability to identify all such similarly situated plaintiffs whom defendants confined in “cold rooms”\n21 since February 10, 2000, as means to compel compliance with directives or as a punishment. \n22 25. Defendant SHERIFF MICHAEL HENNESSEY is personally responsible for the\n23 promulgation and continuation of the strip search policy, practice, and custom pursuant to which some\n24 of the plaintiffs herein were subjected to the searches complained of herein. \n25 \\\\\\\n26 \\\\\\\nPage 7 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\n1 26. Defendant SHERIFF MICHAEL HENNESSEY is also personally responsible for the\n2 promulgation and continuation of the cold room policy, practice, and custom pursuant to which some\n3 of the plaintiffs herein were confined in “cold rooms” as complained of herein.\n4 27. As a result of being subjected to the searches complained of herein, each of the\n5 plaintiffs suffered physical, mental, and emotional distress, invasion of privacy, and violation of due\n6 process of law and state and federal statutory and constitutional rights, and is entitled to recover\n7 damages according to proof, but, at a minimum, $1,000 as specified in California Penal Code §\n8 4030(p) and $4,000 as specified in California Civil Code § 52 and § 52.1(b).\n9 28.  As a result of being placed in a “cold room” as complained of herein, each of the\n10 plaintiffs suffered physical, mental, and emotional distress and violation of due process of law and\n11 state and federal statutory and constitutional rights, and is entitled to recover damages according to\n12 proof, but, a minimum, $4,000 as specified in California Civil Code § 52 and § 52.1(b).\n13 CLASS CLAIMS\n14 29. The strip and visual body cavity searches to which plaintiffs were subjected were\n15 performed pursuant to policies, practices, and customs of defendants SHERIFF HENNESSEY, CITY\n16 AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT, CITY AND COUNTY OF\n17 SAN FRANCISCO, and the individual deputies sued herein by the fictitious names 1 through 150 \n18 The searches complained of herein were performed without regard to the nature of the alleged offense\n19 for which plaintiffs had been arrested, without regard to whether or not plaintiffs were eligible for cite\n20 and release under Penal Code § 853.6, without regard to whether or not plaintiffs were eligible for\n21 and/or were released on their own recognizance.  Furthermore, the searches complained of herein were\n22 performed without defendants having a reasonable belief that the plaintiffs so searched possessed\n23 weapons or contraband, or that there existed facts supporting a reasonable belief that the searches\n24 would produce contraband, and those facts being articulated and recorded in a supervisor-approved\n25 document. \n26 \\\\\\\nPage 8 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\n1 30. Defendants’ use of the “cold room” to compel compliance from, and/or to punish\n2 plaintiffs is in violation of Sections 1055 and 1083 of Title 15 of the California Code of Regulations\n3 (promulgated under the authority of California Penal Code section 6030) and the State and Federal\n4 Constitutions, in that defendants confine people to “cold rooms” to punish them and/or to compel\n5 compliance with directives.  Furthermore, defendants’ practice of placing people in the cold room\n6 naked is a violation of Section 1055, supra, and of plaintiffs’ rights to due process of law.\n7 31. Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf and on behalf of all persons similarly\n8 situated pursuant to Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and California Code of Civil Procedure\n9 § 382.  \n10 32. The class is defined to include all persons who, in the period from and including\n11 February 10, 2000, to the present and continuing until this matter is adjudicated and the practices\n12 complained of herein cease, were arrested and subjected to a pre-arraignment strip and/or visual body\n13 cavity search at the San Francisco Jail without defendants having, and recording, a reasonable\n14 suspicion that the search would be productive of contraband or weapons.\n15 33. The class also includes all persons during the period from and including February 10,\n16 2000, to the present and continuing until this matter is adjudicated and/or the practices complained of\n17 herein cease, whom defendants improperly and unjustifiably confined in a cold room at the San\n18 Francisco Jail as a punishment and/or to compel compliance with a directive. \n19 34. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the members of the\n20 class are so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical.  Plaintiffs do not know the exact\n21 number of class members.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that there are\n22 more than 100 persons per day who are arrested by defendants and/or in the custody of defendants and\n23 subjected to the searches complained of herein as a result of defendants’ policy, practice, and custom\n24 relating to said searches.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants\n25 improperly and unjustifiably confine more than 10 persons per day in cold rooms as punishment or to\n26\nPage 9 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\n1 compel compliance with directives.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and therefore allege, that\n2 there are tens of thousands of persons in the proposed class.\n3 35. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiffs are\n4 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that there are many questions of fact common to the class\n5 including, but not limited to: (1) whether defendants routinely subject all persons arrested to visual\n6 body cavity searches prior to arraignment if they intend such persons to be housed in a San Francisco\n7 County Jail; (2) whether persons are subjected to visual body cavity searches prior to arraignment\n8 without there being any reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to believe any\n9 particular arrestee has concealed drugs, weapons, and/or contraband in bodily cavities which could be\n10 detected by means of a visual body cavity search; (3) whether the visual body cavity searches are\n11 conducted in an area of privacy so that the searches cannot be observed by persons not participating in\n12 the searches, or whether the visual body cavity searches are conducted in groups and/or in open areas\n13 where they may be observed by persons not participating in the searches; and, (4) whether the visual\n14 body cavity searches are reasonably related to defendants’ penological interest to maintain the security\n15 of the jail and whether or not there are less intrusive methods for protecting any such interest. \n16 36.  Plaintiffs are also informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that other common\n17 questions of fact concern the design, temperature,  upkeep, and use of the “cold rooms,” including, but\n18 not limited to: (1) whether the “cold rooms” are used to punish persons in defendants’ custody; (2)\n19 whether defendants properly monitor people placed in the “cold rooms”; (3) whether defendants\n20 routinely fail to provide people placed in the “cold rooms” with sufficient clothing to protect those\n21 persons’ privacy; and, (4) whether defendants routinely fail to provide people confined in the “cold\n22 rooms” with bedding.\n23 37. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiffs are\n24 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that there are many questions of law common to the class\n25 including, but are not limited to: (1) whether defendants may perform visual body cavity searches on\n26 persons prior to their arraignment without reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts,\nPage 10 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\n1 to believe any particular inmate has concealed drugs, weapons and/or contraband which would likely\n2 be discovered by a visual body cavity search; (2) whether defendants may perform visual body cavity\n3 searches on persons without first reasonably relating the use of the visual body cavity search to\n4 defendants’ penological interest to maintain the security of the jail and determining if there is a less\n5 intrusive method to protect that interest; (3) whether visual body cavity searches may be conducted in\n6 areas where the search can be observed by people not participating in the search without violating\n7 plaintiffs’ State and Federal constitutional rights and the protections afforded to plaintiffs under\n8 California Penal Code section 4030; and, (4) whether or not defendants’ strip search policy and\n9 procedure is in accordance with the State and/or Federal Constitution.\n10 38. Plaintiffs are also informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that other common\n11 questions of law concern the nature, conditions, and temperature of the “cold rooms,” including, but\n12 not limited to: (1) whether defendants may use the cold rooms in the San Francisco County Jails for\n13 any reasons other than those stated in the Section 1055 of Title 15 of the California Code of\n14 Regulations without violating plaintiffs’ State and Federal constitutional rights protected by the Fourth\n15 and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and 42 U.S.C. § 1983; (2) whether or\n16 not defendants’ “cold room” policies, practices, and customs are in accordance with the Constitution\n17 and laws of the State of California and/or the United States of America; and (3) whether or not\n18 defendants have established and implemented written plans as directed by Section 1050 of Title 15 of\n19 the California Code of Regulations (promulgated in under the authority of California Penal Code\n20 section 6030).\n21 39. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the claims of the\n22 representative plaintiffs are typical of the class.  Plaintiffs were searched, prior to arraignment, without\n23 reasonable suspicion that a strip or visual body cavity search would produce drugs, weapons or\n24 contraband (and without the facts supporting any such suspicion being articulated in a supervisor-\n25 approved writing), and plaintiff BULL was placed in a “cold room,” without sufficient clothing to\n26 protect her privacy, as punishment for her refusal to consent to a visual body cavity search. \nPage 11 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\n1 Representative plaintiffs have the same interests and suffered the same type of injuries as all of the\n2 class members.  Plaintiffs’ claims arose because of defendants’ policy, practice, and custom of\n3 subjecting arrestees to strip and/or visual body cavity searches before arraignment without having, and\n4 recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the search would be productive of contraband or\n5 weapons.  Additionally, plaintiff BULL, in accordance with defendants’ policy, practice, and custom\n6 was improperly and unjustifiably confined in a “cold room” as punishment after defendants used the\n7 threat of such confinement unsuccessfully to coerce plaintiff to comply with their directives. \n8 Plaintiffs’ claims are based upon the same legal theories as the claims of the class members.  Each\n9 class member suffered actual damages either as a result of being subjected to a visual body cavity\n10 search and/or as a result of being improperly and unjustifiably placed and confined in a “cold room.” \n11 The actual damages suffered by representative plaintiffs are similar in type and amount to the actual\n12 damages suffered by each class member.  \n13 40. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the representative\n14 plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the class interests.  Plaintiffs’ interests are consistent with\n15 and not antagonistic to the interests of the class.  \n16 41. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(A), prosecutions of\n17 separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk that inconsistent or varying\n18 adjudications with respect to individual members of the class would establish incompatible standards\n19 of conduct for the parties opposing the class.  \n20 42. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(B), prosecutions of\n21 separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk of inconsistent adjudications\n22 with respect to individual members of the class which would, as a practical matter, substantially\n23 impair or impede the interests of the other members of the class to protect their interests.\n24 43. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(2), plaintiffs are\n25 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants have acted on grounds generally\n26\nPage 12 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\n1 applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate the final injunctive or declaratory relief with\n2 respect to the class as a whole.  \n3 44. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), this class action is\n4 superior to other available methods for the fair and equitable adjudication of the controversy between\n5 the parties.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the interests of members of\n6 the class in individually controlling the prosecution of a separate action is low, in that most class\n7 members would be unable individually to prosecute any action at all.  Plaintiffs are informed and\n8 believe, and thereupon allege, that the amounts at stake for individuals are so small that separate suits\n9 would be impracticable.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that most members\n10 of the class will not be able to find counsel to represent them.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and\n11 thereupon allege, that it is desirable to concentrate all litigation in one forum because all of the claims\n12 arise in the same location; i.e., the CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO.  It will promote\n13 judicial efficiency to resolve the common questions of law and fact in one forum, rather than in\n14 multiple courts.  \n15 45. Plaintiffs do not know the identities of all of the class members.  Plaintiffs are informed\n16 and believe, and thereupon allege, that the identities of the class members may be ascertained from\n17 records maintained by the CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO and defendant SHERIFF\n18 MICHAEL HENNESSEY and defendant CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO SHERIFF’S\n19 DEPARTMENT.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants’ records\n20 reflect the identities, including addresses and telephone numbers, of the persons who have been held in\n21 custody in the San Francisco Jails.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that\n22 records of, and maintained by defendants reflect who was subject to a strip and/or visual body cavity\n23 search, when the search occurred, where the search occurred, whether any reasonable suspicion for the\n24 search existed and was recorded in a supervisor-approved writing, when persons searched were\n25 arraigned, the charges on which such persons were arrested, whether persons were confined in a “cold\n26 room,” the justification recorded for placing individuals in a “cold room,” what articles of clothing\nPage 13 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\n1 and/or bedding, if any, were provided to people placed in “cold rooms,” how long individuals\n2 remained in a “cold room,” and what treatment they received while so confined.  Plaintiffs are\n3 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that all of the foregoing information is contained in\n4 defendants’ computer system and that the information necessary to identify the class members, by last\n5 known addresses, and the dates and reasons for their arrests and/or release from custody, is readily\n6 available from said computer system.  \n7 46. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), class members\n8 must be furnished with the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including individual notice\n9 to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe,\n10 and thereupon allege, that defendants’ computer records contain a last known address for class\n11 members.  Plaintiffs contemplate that individual notice will be given to class members at such last\n12 known address by first class mail.  Plaintiffs contemplate that the notice will inform class members of\n13 the following:\n14 i. The pendency of the class action and the issues common to the class;\n15 ii. The nature of the action;\n16 iii. Their right to “opt out” of the action within a given time, in which event they\n17 will not be bound by a decision rendered in the class action;\n18 iv. Their right, if they do not “opt out,” to be represented by their own counsel and\n19 to enter an appearance in the case; otherwise they will be represented by the\n20 named class plaintiffs and their counsel; and \n21 v. Their right, if they do not “opt out,” to share in any recovery in favor of the\n22 class, and conversely to be bound by any judgment on the common issues\n23 adverse to the class.  \n24 \\\\\\\n25 \\\\\\\n26 \\\\\\\nPage 14 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v.

For \n2  at least 15 years the Ninth Circuit has consistently held that strip search of pre-arraignment \n3  detainees violates the Fourth Amendment absent particularized reasonable suspicion that the \n4  search will produce a weapon or contraband.  See, e.g., Act Up!/Portland v. Bagley, 988 F.2d \n5  868, 871-872 (9th Cir. 1992); Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Dept., 901 F.2d 702, 711 (9th Cir. \n6  1989), Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 714, 617 (9th Cir. 1984).  Such strip searches also violate \n7  California Penal Code § 4030 which only permits strip searches of those arrested for minor \n8  offenses supported by particularized reasonable suspicion that the search will disclose a weapon \n9  or contraband.  Indeed violation of § 4030 is a misdemeanor.  This Court may enjoin violations \n10  of § 4030 under its supplemental jurisdiction.  Little doubt exists that the County employs an \n11  illegitimate blanket strip search policy violating the Fourth Amendment and § 4030.  \n12  Plaintiffs also seek to enjoin the County from continuing to implement its policy of \n13  placing pretrial detainees in “safety cells” as punishment in violation of the Due Process Clause \n14  of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Bell v. Wolfish 441 U.S. 520 (1979); Henry v. County of Shasta, \n15  132 F.3d 512 (9th Cir. 1997), Anderson v. County of Kern, 45 F.3d 1310 (9th Cir. 1995).  The \n16  County places naked pretrial detainees in safety cells for, among other things, refusal to submit \n17  to a strip search or for a perceived lack of cooperation with the strip search.  Arrestees placed in \n18  safety cells often are denied food and water, are observed by deputies of the opposite sex, and \n19  go for hours without interviews by mental health professionals.  \n20  STATEMENT OF FACTS \n \n21 \nThe  Narratives  Of  Plaintiffs  And  Other  Former  Pre-Arraignment  Detainees \nDescribe The County’s Blanket Strip Search Policy And The County’s Use Of \n22 \nSafety Cells As Punishment.  \n23  Mary Bull: On November 18, 2002, Bull was arrested at a political demonstration and \n24  taken to the Bryant Street jail (County Jail 9).

A strip search shall be conducted by an officer of the same sex, and may be conducted on a person \n12 \nreceived at the Intake and Release facility, without written authorization, when any of the following \nconditions apply: \n13 \n \n1. An arrestee charged with a crime involving drugs, weapons or violence. \n14 \n2. An arrestee with a criminal history involving drugs, weapons or violence.  \n10. A person assigned a custody level by Classification arid scheduled for custodial housing. \n15 \n \nPrisoners should be strip searched before the conclusion of the watch. . . .  \n16 \n \nB.  Authorization to Perform a Strip Search of Arrestees Who Do Not Fall Within Criteria Listed \n17 \nIn IIA \nIf any arrestee or person accepted at intake does not fall within Section II above, permission to conduct \n18 \na strip search may be requested by the arresting, transporting or booking officer when he/she has a \nreasonable  suspicion  based  on  articulable  facts  that  the  arrestee  or  person  may  possess  contraband. \n19 \nPermission to conduct a strip search. may be requested by completing Part A, Request for Strip Search, of \nthe San Francisco Sheriff’s Department STRIP SEARCH AUTHORIZATION form. \n20 \n \nPart III of Procedure E-O3 also details the manner in which deputies must conduct the search.  \n21 \n \nBooking Search, Procedure E-03, As Revised, August 20, 1999, at Bates No. BULL CCSF 00022-00025, and as \n22 \nsupplemented by the Arata Clarification and Dyer Insert To The County Jail 9 Manual, at Bates No. BULL \nCCSF 00143-00144. \n23 \n \n24  2 For some years prior to February 2003, deputies altered the E-03 Procedure “Strip Search Authorization” form to \nadd an improvised “consent to search” line for searches of arrestees whose charges did not involve weapons, \n25  violence or drugs.

McConnell, 29:3-13, 30:23-31:1.  All arrestees who have been assigned to housing \n5  in a San Francisco County jail are strip searched, regardless of the charges against them and \n6  even if they have not met the criteria for a booking search.  Id., 29:9-13, 30:23-25;  Dyer, 51:12-\n7  17.  This policy was in effect in November 2002, when Bull was brought to County Jail 9.  \n8  Deposition of Jan Dempsey, Ex. 12 to Seaton Decl., at 23:3-8.   \n9  Deputies Suzette Humphrey and Julio Palencia highlight the breadth of San Francisco’s \n10  strip search policy.  They testified that deputies strip search all arrestees except those who post \n11  bail or who are cited and released.  Humphrey, 66:22-25, 67:1-11; Palencia, 32:9-12, 38:21-22, \n12  38:24-39:1.  Arrestees who qualify for own recognizance release are strip-searched prior to the \n13  determination of whether they qualify for inclusion in the “OR” program.  Humphrey, 66:9-21. \n14  Strip Searches Of All Arrestees On Their Arrival At New Facility From Jail 9 \n15  The  Sheriff’s  Department’s  Procedure  E-07,  “Contraband  Control,  as  revised  in \n16  September,  1997,  states,  in  part,  that  “When  a  prisoner  enters  the  facility  upon  initial \n17  assignment . . . the appropriate search of their person or property will be conducted.”  Procedure \n18  E-07, “Contraband Control,” Ex. 13 to Seaton Decl., Bates No. Bull CCSF 00030-00036, at \n19  00032.  That Procedure further states that a “Strip Search [2.] will be conducted on every \n20  prisoner  processed  into  any  facility.    Does  not  include  searches  performed  as  part  of  the \n21  booking process.”  “Contraband Control,” supra, at 00034.   \n22  Captain Butler, who ran County Jail 1 at the time of Bull’s arrest, testified that deputies \n23  strip searched all arrestees processed into County Jail 1. Captain Butler understood the term \n24  “appropriate search” to mean a “strip search.”  Deposition of Sabrina Butler, Ex. 14 to Seaton \n25  Decl., at 24:10-15.  Procedure E-07 is a blanket strip search policy; it does not differentiate \n26  among inmates based on the nature of their alleged crimes. Id., 24:16-20, 26:23-25, 27:1-3.  \n27  Deputies strip search each arrestee newly admitted to County Jail 1, regardless of whether that \n28  individual has been strip searched at County Jail 9.

The Department, however, \n13  has not changed its written policies requiring that deputies must strip search everyone newly admitted to a facility \nfrom County Jail 9.  Captain Dyer testified that arrestees are strip searched upon their arrival at new facilities from \n14  County Jail 9.   Dyer,  65:3-7.  Deputy Valerie Carson testified on December 2, 2003, that “anyone entering \nCounty Jail 1 is to be strip searched.”  Deposition of Valerie Carson, Ex. 17 to Seaton Decl., at 24:18-19.   \n15   \n4   POLICY: \n16 \nThe San Francisco Sheriff’s Department permits the use of a safety cell to house a prisoner in conformity \nwith California Code of Regulations, Title 15, Sections 1052, 1055 and 1083. Confinement to a safety cell is \n17 \nonly justified for a minimum period of time necessary, until the prisoner can be removed for medical or \npsychiatric attention. A safety cell shall not be used as disciplinary housing. \n18 \n \nA.  A prisoner may be placed in a safety cell when: \n19 \n1.  She/he displays bizarre behavior which results in the destruction of property. \n2.  She/he displays bizarre behavior which reveals an intent to cause self-inflicted harm. \n20 \n3.  She/he appears gravely disabled and less restrictive housing is unavailable. \n4.  She/he appears to be a danger to self or others. \n21 \n5.  She/he requests to use the safety cell.. \n6.  For OBSERVATION ONLY, if it is determined by direct observation that the prisoner has ingested \n22 \nitems that may cause injury. \n \n23 \nB.  A safety cell SHALL NOT be used under any circumstances for disciplinary or punitive purposes. A \nprisoner SHALL NOT be placed in a safety cell for merely being uncooperative with. staff or being verbally \n24 \nabusive to staff \n \n25 \nII.  Procedure for Use of the Safety Cell \nC.  1.  When a prisoner is placed in a safety cell for any reason, that prisoner shall be strip searched prior to \n26 \nplacement. \na.  In the event the prisoner is not cooperative during a strip search, she/he will remain in restraints while \n27 \nher/his clothing is cut off in a manner that prevents injury to the prisoner. \nb.  Unless placement is made because the prisoner has been determined to be suicidal, substitute clothing \n28 \nwill be immediately provided. \nCASPER, MEADOWS  MARY BULL, et al., v.

The Procedure states, in part, “The \n2  San Francisco Sheriff’s Department permits the use of a safety cell to house a prisoner in \n3  conformity with California Code of Regulations, Title 15, Sections 1052, 1055 and 1083.”  Id., \n4  at 00009.  Safety cells are padded cells housing a single individual.  The dimensions are \n5  dictated by Cal. Code of Regs. Title 24, § 2-470A.2.5.  See,  Excerpt from Title 24,  Ex. 19 to \n6  Seaton Decl.   \n7    California Code of Regulations, Title 15, §§ 1055 and 1083 limit the permissible uses \n8  of a safety cell.  They describe who may be placed in a safety cell and reiterate that placement \n9  in the safety cells may not be for disciplinary reasons, but only to protect the arrestee from \n10  harming himself or others.  Title 15, § 1055, in effect as of February 10, 2001, states, in part: \n \n11 \nThe safety cell described in Title 24, Section 2-470A.2.5, shall be used to hold \n12  only  those  inmates  who  display  behavior  which  results  in  the  destruction  of \nproperty or reveals an intent to cause physical harm to self or others.  . . . \n13 \nIn no case shall the safety cell be used for punishment or as a substitute for \n14  treatment. \nAn inmate shall be placed in a safety cell only with the approval of the facility \n15 \nmanager, the facility watch commander, or the designated physician. Continued \nretention in a safety cell shall be reviewed a minimum of every eight hours. A \n16 \nmedical assessment shall be completed within a maximum of 12 hours of placement \n17  in the safety cell or at the next daily sick call, whichever is earliest.

When a prisoner is placed in a safety cell because of bizarre behavior resulting in destruction of \n20  property or revealing an intent to cause self inflicted harm, JMS will ensure that a medical assessment is \ncompleted within 12 hours or at the next daily sick call, whichever is earlier. \n21   \nIIl. Standards for Treatment of Prisoners in Safety Cells \n22   \nC.  Prisoners shall be deprived ‘of clothing, mattress or blankets ONLY when it has been demonstrated \n23  that: \n1. The prisoner will use them to harm her/himself. \n24  2. The prisoner will destroy them. \n3. The prisoner will use them to clog the plumbing or block observation windows. \n25   \nD.  3.

Additionally, there shall be the following limitations: \n9 \n(d) In no case shall a safety cell, as specified in title 24, section 2- 470A.2.5, or \nany restraint device be used for disciplinary purposes. \n10 \n  Procedure  E-05  authorizes  placement  in  a  safety  cell  of  arrestees  who  exhibited \n11 \n“bizarre” behavior or were “gravely disabled,” categories not included in the Regulation § \n12 \n1055.  Procedure E-05 also requires that detainees be strip searched prior to placement in a \n13 \nsafety cell.   \n14 \n \nNotwithstanding  Written  Procedures  Preventing  Use  Of  Safety  Cells  For \n15 \nDisciplinary  Purposes,  Sheriff’s  Department  Personnel  Regularly  Place  Pre-\nArraignment Detainees In Safety Cells As Punishment For Refusing To Submit To \n16 \nStrip Searches And For Other Perceived Uncooperative Behavior. \n17 \n  Procedure E-05 in effect since 1994 appears clear: “A safety cell SHALL NOT be used \n18 \nunder any circumstances for disciplinary or punitive purposes [and] A prisoner SHALL NOT \n19 \nbe placed in a safety cell for merely being uncooperative with staff or being verbally abusive to \n20 \nstaff.”  Yet, notwithstanding this pellucid prohibition, safety cells have routinely been used to \n21 \ndiscipline uncooperative detainees, including detainees who refuse to assent to a strip search.  \n22 \nPlaintiffs’ narratives are not aberrations but accurately reflect County policies.   \n23 \nConfirming plaintiffs’ accounts, Suzette Humphrey, a deputy at County Jail 9 who \n24 \nparticipated in Bull’s placement in a safety cell, testified that at least since 1992, deputies have \n25 \nplaced arrestees who refuse to be strip searched in a safety cell.  Humphrey, 6:24-7:1, 82:14-20, \n26 \n77:11-16.  Senior Deputy McConnell completed a safety cell form for Bull which noted that she \n27 \nwas placed in the safety cell for refusing to strip in.

Deposition of \n10  Cathleen Beltz, Ex. 22 to Seaton Decl., at 26:5-14. \n11  Valerie Carson, the Senior Deputy who placed plaintiff Mary Bull in a safety cell after \n12  Bull’s  transfer  to  County  Jail  1,  testified  that  “If  they  are  being  placed  in  a  safety  cell, \n13  obviously, something happened where they weren’t going along with the strip search.”  Carson, \n14  18:10-12.  By December 2003, Carson had not learned of any policy changes.

Cotton had made determinations that the \n19  detainees in safety cells were not to receive any clothing.  Cotton, 82:1-4.   \n20  Undersheriff Jan Dempsey confirmed that all detainees “are stripped when they are in \n21  the safety cell,” a policy which has remained unchanged since 1994.

The report analyzed safety cells in Jails 1, 2, 3 and 8 during the \n5  month of September 2001 and on March 14, 2002.  Id., 00101.  The report observed that: \n6  •  While Procedure E-05 included “gravely disabled” and “bizarre behavior” as \n7  bases for placing arrestees in a safety cell, the term “gravely disabled” is not \n8  included in CCR Title 15 § 1055 and the term “bizarre” was removed from the \n9  regulation in 1998.  Id. 00107    \n10  •  Jail personnel relied on “Bizarre behavior” as the basis for 25 percent of the \n11  placements.  Id., 00109-00110.   \n12  •   “In all but one of 19 observed placements, deprivation of at least one item (jail \n13  clothing, garment, blanket, or mattress) occurred without approval.”   Id., 00124.  \n14  Id., 00124-00125.   \n15  •  Prisoners were observed without safety garment (1) overnight until the following \n16  day; (2) for two hours; (3) for 6 ½ hours and (4) for 28 hours.  Id., 00125. \n17  •  A “more universal concern is the failure to provide clothing to placed prisoners.  . \n18  .

Id., 00134.   \n8    On June 19, 2003, Teresa Nelson submitted a follow-up report entitled Safety Cell \n9  Report II to Sheriff Hennessey, based on Nelson’s analysis of placements occurring between \n10  January 9 and January 24, 2003 in County Jails 1 and 2.  Safety Cell Report II, Ex. 25 to Seaton \n11  Decl., Bates No. Bull CCSF 00091-00097, at 00092.  The Report noted that the Department \n12  continued to use the terms “gravely disabled” and “bizarre behavior” among the criteria for \n13  safety cell placement.  Id., 00093.  Failure to offer or provide food and water persisted.  26 of \n14  forty prisoners placed in safety cells had not been offered or provided with water.

Dempsey December Memo, Ex. 27 to \n19 \nSeaton Declaration.  The changes included the following: (1) only Jail Medical Services or Jail \n20 \nPsychiatric  Services  can  determine  whether  someone  is  “gravely  disabled,  reiterating \n21 \nDempsey’s June 2003 memorandum; (2) only an individual who is a danger to self, who \n22 \n23 \n                                            \n24  5   On June 26, 2003, two months after plaintiffs filed suit challenging the safety cell practices, Chief Deputy \nDempsey sent a memorandum to all Custody Division personnel revising the safety cell policy.  Memorandum, \n25  Bates No. Bull CCSF 00039, Ex.  26 to Seaton Decl.  The memorandum first noted that “The Use of the Safety \nCell policy is currently being reviewed.”  The memorandum directed jail personnel that deputies will no longer \n26  make the determination of whether a prisoner is exhibiting behavior classified as “gravely disabled.”  Jail \nPsychiatric Services will make that determination.  Whether the Department effectively communicated this “new” \n27  policy change is an open question.

Id.6 \n7  LEGAL ARGUMENT \n8  PLAINTIFFS ARE ENTITLED TO A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n9  A.  The Test For Injunctive Relief. \n10  Established Ninth Circuit precedent requires the applicant for a preliminary injunction to \n11  demonstrate: “(1) a likelihood of success on the merits; (2) a significant threat of irreparable \n12  injury; (3) that the balance of hardships favors the applicant; and (4) whether any public interest \n13  favors granting an injunction.”   Raich v. Ashcroft, 325 F.3d 1222, (9th Cir. 2003).  The Ninth \n14  Circuit  “also  uses  an  alternative  test  that  requires  the  applicant  to  demonstrate  either:  a \n15  combination of probable success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable injury; or \n16  serious questions going to the merits and that the balance of hardships tips sharply in the \n17  applicant's favor.  These two tests are not inconsistent. Rather, they represent a continuum of \n18  equitable discretion, whereby  ‘the greater the relative hardship to the moving party, the less \n19  probability of success must be shown.’ \"  Id.   (citations omitted).  Plaintiffs’ will prevail on the \n20  merits, irreparable harm exists and the burden imposed on defendants by requiring them to \n21  comply with Constitutional norms and State law is minimal. \n \n22 \nB.  Plaintiffs Will Succeed On The Merits  \n23   \n1.

Strip searches involving the visual exploration of body cavities is dehumanizing \n4  and humiliating.”  Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Dept., 901 F.2d 702, 711 (9th Cir. 1989).  See, \n5  e.g., Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 714, 617 (9th Cir. 1984) (strip search caused the “detainee’s \n6  privacy [to be] invaded in a frightening and humiliating manner.”).   \n7  The Ninth Circuit has enunciated clear guidelines governing strip searches of pretrial \n8  detainees.  In Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614 (9th Cir. 1984), plaintiff had been strip searched \n9  at a local Idaho jail following her arrest for a traffic violation.  Holding that strip searches must \n10  be predicated on reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is carrying contraband, the Court stated:  \n [W]e hold that arrestees charged with minor offenses may be subjected \n11 \nto a strip search only if jail officials possess a reasonable suspicion that the \n12  individual  arrestee  is  carrying  or  concealing  contraband.  Reasonable \nsuspicion may be based on such factors as the nature of the offense, the \n13 \narrestee's appearance and conduct, and the prior arrest record.  \n14 \n746 F.2d at 617.  Rejecting the argument that those arrested for minor offenses likely would be \n15 \ncarrying contraband, the court noted, “[A]rrest and confinement in the Bonneville County Jail \n16 \nare  unplanned  events,  so  the  policy  could  not  possibly  deter  arrestees  from  carrying \n17 \ncontraband.”  746 F.2d at 617.  Giles further held that the placing of temporary detainees in the \n18 \ngeneral  population  did  not  justify  the  County’s  policy,  explaining  \"  ‘[d]efendants'  heavy \n19 \nreliance on the intermingling of its temporary detainees with the general [jail] population is \n20 \nmisplaced ...’ because such intermingling is both limited and avoidable.”  746 F.2d at 619.   \n21 \n  The Ninth Circuit revisited the issue in Ward v. San Diego County, 791 F.2d 1329 (9th \n22 \nCir. 1986).  Following plaintiff’s 1981 arrest for the misdemeanor offense of “failing to appear” \n23 \nshe was stripped and searched.  Rejecting qualified immunity, the court concluded that “that the \n24 \nlaw was sufficiently clear in early 1981 so as to expose a public official who unreasonably \n25 \nauthorized blanket strip searches of minor offense arrestees to civil liability under 42 U.S.C. § \n26 \n1983.”  791 F.2d at 1332-1333.  \n27 \n  Thompson v. City of Los Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439 (9th Cir. 1989) held that strip searches \n28 \nCASPER, MEADOWS  MARY BULL, et al., v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al  Page 16 \n& SCHWARTZ \n2121 N.

The court, \n3  however, reiterated that: “[T]his court and several other courts have invalidated blanket visual \n4  strip  search  policies  as  applied  to  arrestees  detained  for  minor  traffic  offenses  and  other \n5  misdemeanors not normally associated with weapons or other contraband.”  885 F.2d at 1446. \n6    Thompson also reiterated that the placing of a newly arrested detainee “into contact with \n7  the general jail population . . . by itself  cannot justify a strip search,” 885 F.2d at 1447, citing \n8  Giles (746 F.2d at 618) and Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1253, 1254-1255 (6th Cir. 1990) \n9  (\"the  fact  of  intermingling  alone  has  never  been  found  to  justify  [a  strip  search]  without \n10  consideration of the nature of the offense and the question of whether there is any reasonable \n11  basis  for  concern  that  the  particular  detainee  will  attempt  to  introduce  weapons  or  other \n12  contraband into the institution\").  885 F.2d at 1147. \n13    A month after Thompson, the Ninth Circuit decided Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police \n14  Dept., 901 F.2d 702 (9th Cir. 1989), this circuit’s leading opinion on the constitutional limits \n15  placed on strip searches.  Following plaintiff’s arrest for felony grand theft (her roommates \n16  television set) she was a forced to submit to a body cavity search.  901 F.2d at 704.  The LAPD \n17  subjected all felony arrestees to a body-cavity search as a matter of course, whereas only those \n18  misdemeanor arrestees charged with offenses relating to narcotics or suspected of concealing \n19  contraband or weapons are forced to undergo such a search.  901 F.2d at 713.  The court held \n20  the classification of particular conduct as a felony rather than a misdemeanor did not, standing \n21  alone,  justify  a  strip  search.    901  F.2d  716.7    See,  e.g.  Arpin  v.  Santa  Clara  Valley \n22  Transportation Agency, 261 F.3d 912, 922 (9th Cir. 2001) (“[S]trip searches of persons arrested \n23 \n24                                              \n7 In Act Up!/Portland v. Bagley, 988 F.2d 868, 871-872 (9th Cir. 1992), the Ninth Circuit held that by 1989 “it was \n25  clearly established in this circuit that it is unlawful to strip search an arrestee brought to a jail facility on charges of \ncommitting a minor offense, unless the officer directing the search possesses ‘a reasonable suspicion that the \n26  individual arrestee is carrying or concealing contraband.’ “ See, Wong v. Beebe, 2002 WL 31548486 (D. Or. 2002) \n(“[W]ell before Wong's strip and cavity search [in 1999], it was clear that blanket strip search policies are \n27  unconstitutional if justified by nothing more than an arrest on suspicion of the commission of a felony or a planned \nconfinement in the general jail population”) \n28   \nCASPER, MEADOWS  MARY BULL, et al., v.

The  County’s  Strip  Search  Policies  And  Practices  Must \nConform To State Law Which Places Strict Limits on Strip \n8 \nSearchers Of Misdemeanants. \n9    Defendants’ conduct also is governed by California Penal Code § 4030 which forbids \n10  strip searches of arrestees prior to placement in the general population absent “reasonable \n11  suspicion based on specific and articulable facts to believe such person is concealing a weapon \n12  or contraband, and a strip search will result in the discovery of the weapon or contraband.”  § \n13  4030(f).  Such searches must be authorized in writing by a supervisor who has documented the \n14  basis for the search.  Section 4030 forbids placing those arrested for minor offenses in the \n15  general jail population unless the arrestee is not cited or released, or released on his or her own \n16  recognizance or unable to post bail.  The arrestee must have at least three hours to post bail.  \n17  Exceptions to such placement may only occur in a documented emergency.  § 4030(g).    \n \n18 \n3.

After Henry refused to \n2  cooperate with the jail nurse, he was placed naked in a padded safety cell, later given a blanket \n3  and released after nine hours in the cell.  132 F.3d at 515-516.  The court described defendants’ \n4  conduct  “a  blatantly  unconstitutional  course  of  treatment  --  stripping  persons  who  have \n5  committed minor traffic infractions, throwing them naked into a \"rubber room\" and holding \n6  them there for ten hours or more for failing to sign a traffic ticket or asserting their legal right to \n7  be brought before a magistrate.”  132 F.3d at 520.   \n \n8 \n5.  The County’s Practice And Policy Of Using A “Safety Cell” \n9  To Confine An Unclothed Or Partially Clothed Arrestee (1) \nWho Has Done No More Than Refuse To Submit To A Strip \n10 \nSearch  And/Or  (2)  An  Unclothed  Or  Partially  Clothed \n11 \nArrestee Who Pose No Threat To Themselves, To Others Or \nTo The Security Of The Jails Violates Pretrial Detainees’ \n12 \nRight  To  Due  Process  Guaranteed  By  The  Fourteenth \n13 \nAmendment.  \n14  The  record  describes  the  Department’s  regular practice of placing into safety cells \n15  recalcitrant arrestees who refuse to submit to strip searches.  It is as if San Francisco’s jailers \n16  and their wards were governed by policies foreign to us.  Under these policies, Bull and Noh \n17  were placed in safety cells after asserting their constitutional rights.  Giampaoli was placed in a \n18  safety cell after refusing to disrobe before a male officer and de Ranleau was placed there for \n19  asking to use a phone book.  Bronson was punished for not coughing properly during a strip \n20  search and Mangosing was placed in a safety cell to teach her a lesson.  Flick, Fleming and \n21  Johnson were placed in safety cells for no apparent reason.  Several were observed by deputies \n22  of the opposite sex.  None posed a danger to themselves or others.  Most were left unclothed for \n23  hours, some without water.  These practices also ran afoul of State regulations, prohibiting use \n24  of safety cells for disciplinary purposes.  They also violated Procedure E-05, violations which \n25  were apparently of no concern to anyone in the Department. \n26  This use of safety cells goes well beyond the rationale for safety cells condoned in \n27  Anderson – to remedy “very severe safety concerns” by “depri[ving] the prisoners of all means \n28  of harming themselves.  45 F.3d at 1314.

The  Proposed  Injunction  Furthers  The  Public  Interest  While \nPlacing Only A Minimal Burden On Defendants. \n4 \nNo cognizable burden, much less an intolerable one, will be placed on the County by \n5 \nrequiring it to enforce a strip search policy requiring particularized suspicion of violence or \n6 \ncontraband before conducting a strip search.  Similarly, enjoining the County from violating the \n7 \nDue Process Clause and regulations in its safety cell policy will cause no untoward burden.  At \n8 \nthe same time, the public interest will be greatly enhanced by enforcement of policies and \n9 \npractices which adhere to the Constitution, the California Penal Code and state regulations. \n10 \n \nD.  Unless  Restrained  By  This  Court,  Defendants’  Unconstitutional \n11 \nConduct Will Irreparably Harm Plaintiffs. \n12  The Ninth Circuit, in Kennedy and Giles, underscored the dehumanizing, humiliating \n13  effect of strip searches.  “‘[A]n alleged constitutional infringement will often alone constitute \n14  irreparable  harm.’”    Associated  General  Contractors  of  California,  Inc.  v.  Coalition  for \n15  Economic Equity, 950 F.2d 1401, 1412 (9th Cir. 1991).  Longstanding precedent, preexisting \n16  California law and regulations, and the County’s own procedures have failed to alter these \n17  debasing practices, including blanket strip searches and placing detainees naked in safety cells \n18  to punish refusal to cooperate, with, among other things, unconstitutional strip searches.  Absent \n19  injunctive relief, no guarantee exists that defendants will abandon their illegal practices.  \n \n20 \nE.   Plaintiffs Have Standing To Seek Injunctive Relief. \n21  Whether a plaintiff has standing is determined by the situation which exists at the \n22  commencement of the suit.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife (1992) 504 U.S. 555, 571; Bernhardt \n23  v. County of Los Angeles 279 F.3d 862, 868 ( 9th Cir. 2001) (“We examine whether Bernhardt \n24  had standing at the time the lawsuit was filed.”) See, e.g., Paradise Creations, Inc. v. UV Sales, \n25  Inc., 315 F.3d 1304, 1309 (11th Cir. 2003).  The County cannot dispute that when plaintiffs’ \n26  filed their action, they had allegedly suffered from having been strip searched and, in some \n27  cases, placed in safety cells.  No dispute exists that plaintiffs sufficiently alleged that when they \n28  sustained this harm, the County had a blanket strip search policy in force and was using safety \nCASPER, MEADOWS  MARY BULL, et al., v.

Lyons, 461 U.S. 95 (1983).  Lyons \n3  alleged he had been injured by the LAPD when its officers had illegally placed him in a \n4  chokehold following a traffic stop.  Lyons could not show that all police officers always apply \n5  chokeholds or that the city authorized its officers to always apply chokeholds and that Lyons \n6  therefore would face harm from officers acting within  “the strictures of the City’s policy.” 461 \n7  U.S. at 106.  The majority faulted the dissent for failing to point to “any written or oral \n8  pronouncement by the LAPD or any evidence showing a pattern of police behavior” that would \n9  indicate that the official policy” authorizing the challenged conduct.  461 U.S. at 110, n.9. \n10    Armstrong  v.  Davis,  275  F.3d  849  (9th  Cir.  2001)  held  that  where,  as  here,  the \n11  constitutional violation arose from official policy or practices sanctioned by the government, \n12  plaintiffs have standing to seek an injunction.  See, LaDuke v. Nelson 762 F.2d 1318, 1324 (9th \n13  Cir.  1985)  (“[D]efendants  engaged  in  a  standard  pattern  of  officially  sanctioned  officer \n14  behavior.”).  The harm which plaintiffs sustained was directly traceable to a written blanket \n15  strip search policy and to strip search and safety cell practices which the County officially \n16  sanctioned.   \n17  Mary Bull has sufficiently established the likelihood that she will again be subject to the \n18  County’s unconstitutional conduct.  Mary Bull plans to participate lawfully and nonviolently in \n19  future protests in San Francisco.  Bull Declaration, ¶¶ 19-20.  She anticipates that even though \n20  she plans to commit no crime, she will be arrested and transported to County Jail 9 where she \n21  will again refuse to be strip searched and will again be placed in a safety cell.   Id., ¶ 22.   \n22  In Maneely v. City of Newburgh, 208 F.R.D. 69, 73 (S.D.N.Y. 2002), standing was \n23  found where plaintiff alleged “that at the time that the department was given notice of this suit, \n24  there was an official policy of strip searching all arrestees who were detained in a cell.  Maneely \n25  thus ha[d] standing to seek injunctive relief.”  Mack v. Suffolk County, 191 F.R.D. 16 (D. Mass. \n26  2000), recognized that plaintiffs, who had been arrested on prior occasions, were more likely to \n27  be arrested than those with no criminal history.  191 F.R.D. at 20.  “Under the circumstances,” \n28  said the court, “it is not unreasonable to conclude that future arrests are likely.”  Id.

Id., at 21.  As here, the blanket strip searches \n3  challenged  in  Mack  were  not  simply  the  result  of  officially  condoned  “practice[s];”  they \n4  resulted from an “iron clad policy” in place at the time plaintiffs “were arrested and at the time \n5  Mack filed her complaint.”  Id.  In San Francisco those iron clad policies required deputies to \n6  strip search all classified pre-arraignment detainees; to strip search detainees prior to placement \n7  in safety cells; and strip search pre-arraignment detainees be strip searched again upon transfer \n8  to another facility, such as County Jail 1.  Mack applies equally well to plaintiffs here:  “As \n9  [plaintiffs] have demonstrated that, at the time the complaint was filed, a real and immediate \n10  threat of future injury existed, they have standing to seek injunctive relief.”  Id.    \n \n11 \nF.  The  Recent  Change  In  Procedures  Does  Not  Moot  Plaintiffs’ \nMotion: The County Has Not Materially Altered Its Blanket Strip \n12 \nSearch Policy And Cannot Meet Its Heavy Burden Of Showing That \nIts Personnel Will Now Adhere To Constitutional Norms.  \n13 \nPlaintiffs’ motion is not moot because the County has not altered its blanket strip search \n14 \npolicy requiring deputies to strip search all arrestees at County Jail 9 who are being classified \n15 \nfor housing, a policy exacerbated by requiring deputies to strip search those remaining in \n16 \nholding cells near the end of a shift.  Arata Insert, Ex. 4,to Seaton Declaration, supra.  \n17 \nMoreover, even though defendants have modified their written safety cell policies, such \n18 \nmodification, in the midst of litigation, offers no guarantee that safety cell practices will adhere \n19 \nto he constitution.  Indeed, the County has taken no steps whatsoever to ensure that safety cell \n20 \nplacements  will  not  be  used  as  punishment  for  those  unwilling  to  comply  with  jailers’ \n21 \ndirectives, such as submitting to a strip search.  \n22 \nIn Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. \n23 \n167, 189 (2000) the Court noted, “It is well settled that “a defendant's voluntary cessation of a \n24 \nchallenged practice does not deprive a federal court of its power to determine the legality of the \n25 \npractice” . The Court set forth this “stringent” test: “A case might become moot if subsequent \n26 \nevents made it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be \n27 \nexpected to recur.”  The “ ‘heavy burden of persua[ding]’ the court that the challenged conduct \n28 \nCASPER, MEADOWS  MARY BULL, et al., v.

Since Giles in 1984 and certainly after Thompson \n4  and Kennedy in 1989, the Ninth Circuit made clear that the blanket strip search policies which \n5  plaintiffs seek to enjoin here violated the Fourth Amendment.  County policy requires that once \n6  arrestees are classified, all are strip searched.  Moreover, deputies’ actual practices deviate even \n7  further  from  constitutional  standards.    Arrestees  are  often  strip  searched,  regardless  of \n8  reasonable suspicion, almost immediately after entering the facility.  And, notwithstanding \n9  contrary  written  procedures,  male  deputies  participated  in  the  strip  searching  of  several \n10  plaintiffs, including Mary Bull, Lisa Giampaoli, and Charli Johnson.   \n11  The Ninth Circuit also set clear limits on the use of safety cells in Anderson  in 1995 and \n12  in Henry, decided two years later.  Since at least 2001, the State of California’s regulations have \n13  prohibited use of safety cells for discipline and limited the criteria for safety cell placement.  \n14  Yet nothing was done.  Even after the 2002 Safety Cell Report, the County waited over a year \n15  after the Safety Cell Report, -- until the eve of the filing of this motion -- to change part of its \n16  written policy.  In any event, deputies have regularly violated written procedures governing \n17  safety cell placements.  For years, Procedure E-05, the written policy, has prohibited use of the \n18  safety cells for disciplinary purposes to punish uncooperative arrestees.  Yet, on two occasions, \n19  deputies placed Mary Bull in a safety cell for refusing to submit to a strip search.  Several \n20  deputies pulled Miki Mangosing from the holding cell for attempting to talk to her friend in the \n21  next cell, placed her in a safety cell, forcibly strip searched her, and left her naked in the cell \n22  without food or water for 12 hours.  Lisa Giampaoli was booked and instructed to disrobe in the \n23  presence of a male officer. When she refused, male and female deputies dragged her into a \n24  safety cell, forcibly removed her clothing and left her naked in the cell for approximately 12 \n25  hours.  Alexis Bronson was told that he was not coughing loudly enough and was dragged to a \n26  safety cell by five deputies where he was kept naked for 12 hours without food or water.  The \n27  existence of written policies availed these plaintiffs nothing.   \n28  Delays between clearly established court-authored constitutional guidelines and the \nCASPER, MEADOWS  MARY BULL, et al., v.

In Maneely v. City of Newburgh, 208 F.R.D. 69 (S.D.N.Y.2002), plaintiff \n3  “sought: a declaratory judgment declaring that a strip search of a pre-arraignment arrestee \n4  undertaken  absent  reasonable  suspicion  that  the  arrestee  is  concealing  weapons  or  other \n5  contraband is unconstitutional; [and] an order enjoining defendants from implementing or \n6  enforcing such a policy.” Id., at 71.  Following submission of plaintiff’s claim, but seven \n7  months  prior  to  filing  suit,  the  City  changed  its  policy  to  conform  to  the  constitution.  \n8  Rejecting defendants’ mootness claim, the court pointed to the five years which had elapsed \n9  since the unconstitutionality of defendants’ strip search policies had become clear: “Given that \n10  it took the defendants well over five years to conform Newburgh's strip search policy with the \n11  law, it is not “absolutely clear” that defendants will not “return to their old ways.”  Id., at 73-\n12  74. \n13  Plaintiff  in  Mack  v.  Suffolk  County,  191  F.R.D.  16  (D.  Mass.  2000)  also  sought \n14  injunctive  relief  to  enjoin  defendant’s  unlawful  strip  search  policies.    The  County \n15  unsuccessfully argued mootness, noting the change in its policy.  Defendant’s change, however, \n16  did not “eliminate the possibility” that plaintiffs would be unlawfully stripped searched in the \n17  future since, “Absent the imperative imposed by an injunction, these Defendants are free to \n18  reinstate the objectionable practice at any time.”  Id., at 21.  The court emphasized that the \n19  County had maintained its procedures years after the Circuit Court of Appeals had deemed such \n20  practices unconstitutional.  The court concluded that “Defendant changed its policy to avoid \n21  liability in this case at bar rather than to comport with constitutional standards.”  Id., at 22.   \n22    The  County  cannot  meet  its  “heavy  burden”  of  convincing  this  Court  that  it  is \n23  “absolutely clear” that its personnel will adhere to constitutional norms.  The County cannot lift \n24  this  weighty  burden.    The  County  may  not  take  solace  in  the  preparation  of  some  new \n25  procedures in the midst of litigation occurring years after controlling Ninth Circuit precedent.  \n26  The County’s dismal track record in enforcing its own written policies further defeats its \n27  mootness claim.  The County’s mootness claim fails. \n28  CONCLUSION \nCASPER, MEADOWS  MARY BULL, et al., v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al  Page 25 \n& SCHWARTZ \n2121 N.

Plaintiffs seek an\n26\nPage 1 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 1     Filed 04/23/2003     Page 2 of 17(cid:10)\n1 order declaring illegal defendants’ policy of subjecting detainees in their custody to strip and visual\n2 body cavity searches before they are arraigned and without having any reasonable suspicion that the\n3 searches will be productive of contraband. \n4 Plaintiffs also seek declaratory and injunctive relief, damages, and punitive damages against\n5 the defendants for the policy, practice, and custom of placing detainees, naked, in rooms referred to as\n6 “cold rooms,” without any legitimate purpose, but in order to compel consent to illegal strip searches,\n7 to punish persons who question illegal practices, or for other illegal purposes.  These cold rooms are\n8 kept bone chillingly cold, lack access to natural light and are devoid of furniture and running water. \n9 The cold rooms are constantly illuminated by flourescent lighting and persons confined in them can\n10 only sit or lie on the bare floor.  Defendants’ use of the “cold rooms” violates Sections 1055 and 1083\n11 of Title 15 of the California Code of Regulations which specify that isolation or “safe rooms” which\n12 may have legitimate psychological uses cannot be used for punishment and that persons confined\n13 therein must be provided with adequate bedding and clothing. \n14 Defendants’ strip search, visual body cavity search, and cold room policies, practices, and\n15 customs violate plaintiffs’ rights secured to them by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the\n16 U.S. Constitution and entitle plaintiffs to recover damages under the Federal Civil Rights Act (42\n17 U.S.C. § 1983).  \n18 Additionally, plaintiffs include supplemental claims under California state law against\n19 defendants: 1) for violation of California Penal Code § 4030 which prohibits pre-arraignment strip\n20 searches of most misdemeanents and provides for minimum damages of $1,000 for each illegal search;\n21 2) for wholesale violation of Sections 1055 and 1083 of Section 15 of the California Code of\n22 Regulations (promulgated under the authority of California Penal Code § 6030) which describes the\n23 very narrow conditions under which a cold room can be used; and, 3) for violation of the Unruh Civil\n24 Rights Act (California Civil Code §§ 52 and 52.1(b)) pursuant to which each plaintiff denied a\n25 statutory or state or federal Constitutional right is entitled to recover a minimum of $4,000 for each\n26 violation.  \nPage 2 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 1     Filed 04/23/2003     Page 3 of 17(cid:10)\n1 JURISDICTION\n2 1. This action is brought pursuant to 42 USC § 1983 and 1988, and the Fourth and\n3 Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  Jurisdiction is founded upon 28 USC §\n4 1331 and 1341(3) and (4) and the aforementioned statutory and constitutional provisions.  \n5 2. The court has supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ state claims under 28 USC §\n6 1367(a).\n7 3. The amount in controversy exceeds $10,000, excluding interest and costs.\n8 PARTIES\n9 4. Plaintiffs, including MARY BULL and JONAH ZERN, and all those similarly situated,\n10 are, and at all material times herein, were citizens of the United States and residents of the state of\n11 California who were arrested within the period beginning three (3) years before February 10, 2003,\n12 and continuing to this date, and who were subjected to strip and/or visual body cavity searches at a\n13 San Francisco County Jail (hereinafter referred to as the “San Francisco Jail”), prior to being arraigned\n14 and/or without the defendants first having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the\n15 searches would be productive of contraband or weapons.\n16 5. Some plaintiffs, including MARY BULL, were confined by defendants in “cold rooms”\n17 at the San Francisco Jail to coerce compliance with illegal orders or for punishment in violation of\n18 their state and federal statutory and constitutional rights. \n19 6. Defendant CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO SHERIFF MICHAEL\n20 HENNESSEY is, and at all material times referred to herein, was the duly elected Sheriff of the city\n21 and county of San Francisco, responsible for administering the Jail facilities and for making,\n22 overseeing, and implementing the policies, practices, and customs challenged herein relating to the\n23 operation of the San Francisco Jail.  He is sued in his individual and official capacities.\n24 7. Defendants SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY SHERIFF DEPUTIES sued herein by their\n25 fictitious names (Does 1 through 150) are all deputies who, as part of their duties at the San Francisco\n26 Jails, subjected plaintiffs to pre-arraignment strip and/or visual body cavity searches without first\nPage 3 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 1     Filed 04/23/2003     Page 4 of 17(cid:10)\n1 having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of\n2 contraband or weapons.   Furthermore, Defendants SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY SHERIFF\n3 DEPUTIES sued herein by their fictitious names (Does 101 through 150) are all deputies who, as part\n4 of their duties at the San Francisco Jail, confined plaintiffs in “cold rooms” to gain compliance with\n5 illegal order or to punish plaintiffs.  \n6 8. At all material times mentioned herein, each of the defendants was acting under the\n7 color of law, to wit, under color of statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies, customs and usages of\n8 the State of California, the CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO and/or the SAN\n9 FRANCISCO COUNTY SHERIFF . \n10 9. Defendant CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO is, and at all material times\n11 referred to herein, was, a division of the state of California, that maintained or permitted an official\n12 policy or custom or practice causing or permitting the occurrence of the types of wrongs complained\n13 of herein, which wrongs damaged plaintiffs as herein alleged.  Plaintiffs’ allegations against the\n14 COUNTY are based on acts and omissions of the SHERIFF and his deputies and on acts and\n15 omissions of persons who are COUNTY employees, and on the COUNTY’s breach of its duty to\n16 protect plaintiffs from the wrongful conduct of said persons and employees.\n17 10. Defendants SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT and SAN\n18 FRANCISCO COUNTY SHERIFF MICHAEL HENNESSEY, in his individual and official capacity,\n19 also maintained or permitted an official policy or custom or practice causing or permitting the\n20 occurrence of the types of wrongs complained of herein, which wrongs damaged plaintiffs as herein\n21 alleged.\n22 11. Class action plaintiffs are those similarly situated who, during the period beginning\n23 three (3) years before February 10, 2003, and continuing to this date, were subjected by defendants to\n24 pre-arraignment strip and/or visual body cavity searches without defendants having, and recording in\n25 writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or weapons. \n26 Some of the similarly situated plaintiffs were placed by defendants in “cold rooms,” in order to\nPage 4 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 1     Filed 04/23/2003     Page 5 of 17(cid:10)\n1 compel compliance with illegal orders or as punishment and without defendants meeting the\n2 requirements governing the use of such rooms.\n3 FACTS\n4 12. On or about November 18, 2002, plaintiff MARY BULL, along with many others, was\n5 arrested at a demonstration on Market Street, in San Francisco and charged with vandalism.  Ms.\n6 BULL was taken to the San Francisco Jail, arriving in mid-afternoon.  At approximately 6:00 p.m.,\n7 Ms. BULL was taken to an area to be “dressed-in.” A Sheriff’s deputy (Doe 1) prepared an inventory\n8 of Ms. BULL’s clothing and directed Ms. BULL to sign three documents, one of which was a consent\n9 to strip search which Ms. BULL refused to sign.  Her “dress-in” was terminated, and she was returned\n10 to a holding cell and held for a “classification” interview.  \n11 13. Three hours later, Ms. BULL  was returned to a dress-in room and again directed to\n12 consent to a visual body cavity search. Upon her refusal to consent to the visual body cavity search,\n13 Ms. BULL was taken from the “dress-in” area, to the center of the “bull pen” where she was\n14 confronted by several officers, male and female, one of whom told her that if she did not voluntarily\n15 submit to a visual body cavity search she would be thrown into a cold room, naked, for 24 hours. \n16 When Ms. BULL again declined to submit to the visual body cavity search, defendants moved her into\n17 the “cold room,” where she was subjected to a forcible visual body cavity search by Does 2 through 5. \n18 14. During the search, a male deputy (Doe 2) entered the room and watched as Ms.\n19 BULL’s clothes were pulled off, three deputies (Does 3 through 5) forced her to lie on her back,\n20 naked, bent her legs towards her chest, and visually inspected her genital and rectal areas.  Ms. BULL\n21 was then left naked in the “cold room” and the metal door shut.\n22 15. While Ms. BULL was in the “cold room,” she was shocked every few minutes by a\n23 sheriff’s deputy (Does 6 through 10) smashing a baton repeatedly against the door. The smashing of\n24 the baton on the unfurnished “cold room’s” metal door caused an unbearably loud, nerve-shattering\n25 noise, that prevented Ms. BULL from sleeping or resting and caused her to suffer extreme anxiety and\n26 emotional distress.\nPage 5 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 1     Filed 04/23/2003     Page 6 of 17(cid:10)\n1 16. During her time in the “cold room,” Ms. BULL was provided with neither clothing for\n2 her personal privacy nor with blankets or bedding as for a modicum of comfort.  Ms. BULL is\n3 informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Defendants have a policy, practice, and custom of\n4 utilizing confinement in the “cold room” as punishment for non-violent, non-suicidal, and non-\n5 destructive detainees who are dubbed “non-compliant” and that such a policy, practice, and custom\n6 violates the Constitution and laws of the State of California and the United States of America. \n7 17. At approximately 9:00 a.m. on November 19, 2002, Ms. BULL was removed from the\n8 “cold room,” issued some prison clothing, and placed in a holding cell with other detainees.  She was\n9 interviewed for release on her own recognizance and taken upstairs where she was again directed to\n10 consent to a visual body cavity search by Doe 11.  Again, Ms. BULL is informed and believes, and\n11 thereon alleges, that defendants had no reasonable suspicion that a visual body cavity search would\n12 result in the discovery of contraband or weapons.\n13 18.  Ms. BULL explained to Doe 11 that the California and United States’ Constitutions\n14 and the state penal code preclude such strip searches and declined to cooperate.  Ms. BULL was taken\n15 into another “cold room,” and again subjected to a forcible visual body cavity search by Does 11\n16 through 15.  Ms. BULL was left naked in the “cold room” and later assigned to a cell with\n17 approximately eight bunkbeds.   At about 10:00 p.m., more than 30 hours after she was arrested, Ms.\n18 BULL was released on her own recognizance having never been arraigned.\n19 19. On or about January 18, 2003, plaintiff JONAH ZERN was arrested along with others\n20 at a peace rally in San Francisco.  Mr. ZERN was taken to the San Francisco Jail where he held for\n21 two days before being released on his own recognizance without being arraigned.  Shortly after his\n22 arrival at the San Francisco Jail, Mr. ZERN was taken to a curtained off area where a Sheriff’s deputy,\n23 Doe 16, directed him to remove all his clothes.  The Sheriff’s deputy, Doe 16, then conducted a visual\n24 body cavity search of Mr. ZERN wherein Mr. ZERN had to bend over, spread his buttocks, and cough. \n25 Mr. ZERN is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that defendants had no reasonable suspicion\n26\nPage 6 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 1     Filed 04/23/2003     Page 7 of 17(cid:10)\n1 that a visual body cavity search would result in the discovery of contraband or weapons. On or about\n2 January 23, 2003, the charges filed against Mr. ZERN were dismissed.  \n3 20. Within six months of her arrest, plaintiff MARY BULL filed a group government tort\n4 claim for herself and for all persons similarly situated (a copy of said claim is attached hereto as\n5 Exhibit A, and incorporated herein to the extent relevant by this reference).  Plaintiff BULL’s group\n6 claim was denied on or about April 7, 2003, allowing the filing of this Complaint.  \n7 21. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that defendants routinely follow\n8 their policy, practice, and custom of subjecting pre-arraignment detainees, including plaintiffs, to strip\n9 and visual body cavity searches without having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that\n10 the search will be productive of contraband or weapons.  \n11 22. Plaintiffs are further informed and believe, and thereon allege, that defendants routinely\n12 follow their policy, practice and custom of confining detainees, including plaintiffs, in “cold rooms” in\n13 order to compel compliance with illegal orders or as punishment.\n14 23. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that defendants have the ability\n15 to identify all such similarly situated plaintiffs, specifically those who, while in defendants’ custody, at\n16 the San Francisco Jail since February 10, 2000, were subjected to strip searches and/or visual body\n17 cavity searches prior to arraignment without defendants first having, and recording, a reasonable\n18 suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or weapons.\n19 24. Plaintiffs are further informed and believe, and thereon allege, that defendants have the\n20 ability to identify all such similarly situated plaintiffs whom defendants confined in “cold rooms”\n21 since February 10, 2000, as means to compel compliance with directives or as a punishment. \n22 25. Defendant SHERIFF MICHAEL HENNESSEY is personally responsible for the\n23 promulgation and continuation of the strip search policy, practice, and custom pursuant to which some\n24 of the plaintiffs herein were subjected to the searches complained of herein. \n25 \\\\\\\n26 \\\\\\\nPage 7 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 1     Filed 04/23/2003     Page 8 of 17(cid:10)\n1 26. Defendant SHERIFF MICHAEL HENNESSEY is also personally responsible for the\n2 promulgation and continuation of the cold room policy, practice, and custom pursuant to which some\n3 of the plaintiffs herein were confined in “cold rooms” as complained of herein.\n4 27. As a result of being subjected to the searches complained of herein, each of the\n5 plaintiffs suffered physical, mental, and emotional distress, invasion of privacy, and violation of due\n6 process of law and state and federal statutory and constitutional rights, and is entitled to recover\n7 damages according to proof, but, at a minimum, $1,000 as specified in California Penal Code §\n8 4030(p) and $4,000 as specified in California Civil Code § 52 and § 52.1(b).\n9 28.  As a result of being placed in a “cold room” as complained of herein, each of the\n10 plaintiffs suffered physical, mental, and emotional distress and violation of due process of law and\n11 state and federal statutory and constitutional rights, and is entitled to recover damages according to\n12 proof, but, a minimum, $4,000 as specified in California Civil Code § 52 and § 52.1(b).\n13 CLASS CLAIMS\n14 29. The strip and visual body cavity searches to which plaintiffs were subjected were\n15 performed pursuant to policies, practices, and customs of defendants SHERIFF HENNESSEY, CITY\n16 AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT, CITY AND COUNTY OF\n17 SAN FRANCISCO, and the individual deputies sued herein by the fictitious names 1 through 150 \n18 The searches complained of herein were performed without regard to the nature of the alleged offense\n19 for which plaintiffs had been arrested, without regard to whether or not plaintiffs were eligible for cite\n20 and release under Penal Code § 853.6, without regard to whether or not plaintiffs were eligible for\n21 and/or were released on their own recognizance.  Furthermore, the searches complained of herein were\n22 performed without defendants having a reasonable belief that the plaintiffs so searched possessed\n23 weapons or contraband, or that there existed facts supporting a reasonable belief that the searches\n24 would produce contraband, and those facts being articulated and recorded in a supervisor-approved\n25 document. \n26 \\\\\\\nPage 8 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 1     Filed 04/23/2003     Page 9 of 17(cid:10)\n1 30. Defendants’ use of the “cold room” to compel compliance from, and/or to punish\n2 plaintiffs is in violation of Sections 1055 and 1083 of Title 15 of the California Code of Regulations\n3 (promulgated under the authority of California Penal Code section 6030) and the State and Federal\n4 Constitutions, in that defendants confine people to “cold rooms” to punish them and/or to compel\n5 compliance with directives.  Furthermore, defendants’ practice of placing people in the cold room\n6 naked is a violation of Section 1055, supra, and of plaintiffs’ rights to due process of law.\n7 31. Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf and on behalf of all persons similarly\n8 situated pursuant to Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and California Code of Civil Procedure\n9 § 382.  \n10 32. The class is defined to include all persons who, in the period from and including\n11 February 10, 2000, to the present and continuing until this matter is adjudicated and the practices\n12 complained of herein cease, were arrested and subjected to a pre-arraignment strip and/or visual body\n13 cavity search at the San Francisco Jail without defendants having, and recording, a reasonable\n14 suspicion that the search would be productive of contraband or weapons.\n15 33. The class also includes all persons during the period from and including February 10,\n16 2000, to the present and continuing until this matter is adjudicated and/or the practices complained of\n17 herein cease, whom defendants improperly and unjustifiably confined in a cold room at the San\n18 Francisco Jail as a punishment and/or to compel compliance with a directive. \n19 34. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the members of the\n20 class are so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical.  Plaintiffs do not know the exact\n21 number of class members.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that there are\n22 more than 100 persons per day who are arrested by defendants and/or in the custody of defendants and\n23 subjected to the searches complained of herein as a result of defendants’ policy, practice, and custom\n24 relating to said searches.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants\n25 improperly and unjustifiably confine more than 10 persons per day in cold rooms as punishment or to\n26\nPage 9 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v.

Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and therefore allege, that\n2 there are tens of thousands of persons in the proposed class.\n3 35. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiffs are\n4 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that there are many questions of fact common to the class\n5 including, but not limited to: (1) whether defendants routinely subject all persons arrested to visual\n6 body cavity searches prior to arraignment if they intend such persons to be housed in a San Francisco\n7 County Jail; (2) whether persons are subjected to visual body cavity searches prior to arraignment\n8 without there being any reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to believe any\n9 particular arrestee has concealed drugs, weapons, and/or contraband in bodily cavities which could be\n10 detected by means of a visual body cavity search; (3) whether the visual body cavity searches are\n11 conducted in an area of privacy so that the searches cannot be observed by persons not participating in\n12 the searches, or whether the visual body cavity searches are conducted in groups and/or in open areas\n13 where they may be observed by persons not participating in the searches; and, (4) whether the visual\n14 body cavity searches are reasonably related to defendants’ penological interest to maintain the security\n15 of the jail and whether or not there are less intrusive methods for protecting any such interest. \n16 36.  Plaintiffs are also informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that other common\n17 questions of fact concern the design, temperature,  upkeep, and use of the “cold rooms,” including, but\n18 not limited to: (1) whether the “cold rooms” are used to punish persons in defendants’ custody; (2)\n19 whether defendants properly monitor people placed in the “cold rooms”; (3) whether defendants\n20 routinely fail to provide people placed in the “cold rooms” with sufficient clothing to protect those\n21 persons’ privacy; and, (4) whether defendants routinely fail to provide people confined in the “cold\n22 rooms” with bedding.\n23 37. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiffs are\n24 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that there are many questions of law common to the class\n25 including, but are not limited to: (1) whether defendants may perform visual body cavity searches on\n26 persons prior to their arraignment without reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts,\nPage 10 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 1     Filed 04/23/2003     Page 11 of 17(cid:10)\n1 to believe any particular inmate has concealed drugs, weapons and/or contraband which would likely\n2 be discovered by a visual body cavity search; (2) whether defendants may perform visual body cavity\n3 searches on persons without first reasonably relating the use of the visual body cavity search to\n4 defendants’ penological interest to maintain the security of the jail and determining if there is a less\n5 intrusive method to protect that interest; (3) whether visual body cavity searches may be conducted in\n6 areas where the search can be observed by people not participating in the search without violating\n7 plaintiffs’ State and Federal constitutional rights and the protections afforded to plaintiffs under\n8 California Penal Code section 4030; and, (4) whether or not defendants’ strip search policy and\n9 procedure is in accordance with the State and/or Federal Constitution.\n10 38. Plaintiffs are also informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that other common\n11 questions of law concern the nature, conditions, and temperature of the “cold rooms,” including, but\n12 not limited to: (1) whether defendants may use the cold rooms in the San Francisco County Jails for\n13 any reasons other than those stated in the Section 1055 of Title 15 of the California Code of\n14 Regulations without violating plaintiffs’ State and Federal constitutional rights protected by the Fourth\n15 and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and 42 U.S.C. § 1983; (2) whether or\n16 not defendants’ “cold room” policies, practices, and customs are in accordance with the Constitution\n17 and laws of the State of California and/or the United States of America; and (3) whether or not\n18 defendants have established and implemented written plans as directed by Section 1050 of Title 15 of\n19 the California Code of Regulations (promulgated in under the authority of California Penal Code\n20 section 6030).\n21 39. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the claims of the\n22 representative plaintiffs are typical of the class.  Plaintiffs were searched, prior to arraignment, without\n23 reasonable suspicion that a strip or visual body cavity search would produce drugs, weapons or\n24 contraband (and without the facts supporting any such suspicion being articulated in a supervisor-\n25 approved writing), and plaintiff BULL was placed in a “cold room,” without sufficient clothing to\n26 protect her privacy, as punishment for her refusal to consent to a visual body cavity search. \nPage 11 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 1     Filed 04/23/2003     Page 12 of 17(cid:10)\n1 Representative plaintiffs have the same interests and suffered the same type of injuries as all of the\n2 class members.  Plaintiffs’ claims arose because of defendants’ policy, practice, and custom of\n3 subjecting arrestees to strip and/or visual body cavity searches before arraignment without having, and\n4 recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the search would be productive of contraband or\n5 weapons.  Additionally, plaintiff BULL, in accordance with defendants’ policy, practice, and custom\n6 was improperly and unjustifiably confined in a “cold room” as punishment after defendants used the\n7 threat of such confinement unsuccessfully to coerce plaintiff to comply with their directives. \n8 Plaintiffs’ claims are based upon the same legal theories as the claims of the class members.  Each\n9 class member suffered actual damages either as a result of being subjected to a visual body cavity\n10 search and/or as a result of being improperly and unjustifiably placed and confined in a “cold room.” \n11 The actual damages suffered by representative plaintiffs are similar in type and amount to the actual\n12 damages suffered by each class member.  \n13 40. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the representative\n14 plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the class interests.  Plaintiffs’ interests are consistent with\n15 and not antagonistic to the interests of the class.  \n16 41. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(A), prosecutions of\n17 separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk that inconsistent or varying\n18 adjudications with respect to individual members of the class would establish incompatible standards\n19 of conduct for the parties opposing the class.  \n20 42. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(B), prosecutions of\n21 separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk of inconsistent adjudications\n22 with respect to individual members of the class which would, as a practical matter, substantially\n23 impair or impede the interests of the other members of the class to protect their interests.\n24 43. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(2), plaintiffs are\n25 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants have acted on grounds generally\n26\nPage 12 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 1     Filed 04/23/2003     Page 13 of 17(cid:10)\n1 applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate the final injunctive or declaratory relief with\n2 respect to the class as a whole.  \n3 44. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), this class action is\n4 superior to other available methods for the fair and equitable adjudication of the controversy between\n5 the parties.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the interests of members of\n6 the class in individually controlling the prosecution of a separate action is low, in that most class\n7 members would be unable individually to prosecute any action at all.  Plaintiffs are informed and\n8 believe, and thereupon allege, that the amounts at stake for individuals are so small that separate suits\n9 would be impracticable.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that most members\n10 of the class will not be able to find counsel to represent them.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and\n11 thereupon allege, that it is desirable to concentrate all litigation in one forum because all of the claims\n12 arise in the same location; i.e., the CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO.  It will promote\n13 judicial efficiency to resolve the common questions of law and fact in one forum, rather than in\n14 multiple courts.  \n15 45. Plaintiffs do not know the identities of all of the class members.  Plaintiffs are informed\n16 and believe, and thereupon allege, that the identities of the class members may be ascertained from\n17 records maintained by the CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO and defendant SHERIFF\n18 MICHAEL HENNESSEY and defendant CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO SHERIFF’S\n19 DEPARTMENT.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants’ records\n20 reflect the identities, including addresses and telephone numbers, of the persons who have been held in\n21 custody in the San Francisco Jails.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that\n22 records of, and maintained by defendants reflect who was subject to a strip and/or visual body cavity\n23 search, when the search occurred, where the search occurred, whether any reasonable suspicion for the\n24 search existed and was recorded in a supervisor-approved writing, when persons searched were\n25 arraigned, the charges on which such persons were arrested, whether persons were confined in a “cold\n26 room,” the justification recorded for placing individuals in a “cold room,” what articles of clothing\nPage 13 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.  USDC, Northern District, Case No. ________________\nCOMPLAINT\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 1     Filed 04/23/2003     Page 14 of 17(cid:10)\n1 and/or bedding, if any, were provided to people placed in “cold rooms,” how long individuals\n2 remained in a “cold room,” and what treatment they received while so confined.  Plaintiffs are\n3 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that all of the foregoing information is contained in\n4 defendants’ computer system and that the information necessary to identify the class members, by last\n5 known addresses, and the dates and reasons for their arrests and/or release from custody, is readily\n6 available from said computer system.  \n7 46. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), class members\n8 must be furnished with the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including individual notice\n9 to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe,\n10 and thereupon allege, that defendants’ computer records contain a last known address for class\n11 members.  Plaintiffs contemplate that individual notice will be given to class members at such last\n12 known address by first class mail.  Plaintiffs contemplate that the notice will inform class members of\n13 the following:\n14 i. The pendency of the class action and the issues common to the class;\n15 ii. The nature of the action;\n16 iii. Their right to “opt out” of the action within a given time, in which event they\n17 will not be bound by a decision rendered in the class action;\n18 iv. Their right, if they do not “opt out,” to be represented by their own counsel and\n19 to enter an appearance in the case; otherwise they will be represented by the\n20 named class plaintiffs and their counsel; and \n21 v. Their right, if they do not “opt out,” to share in any recovery in favor of the\n22 class, and conversely to be bound by any judgment on the common issues\n23 adverse to the class.  \n24 \\\\\\\n25 \\\\\\\n26 \\\\\\\nPage 14 of 17\nMARY BULL, et al. v.

Factual History\n3 The San Francisco Sheriff’s Department (“the Department”) oversees six county jails. \n4 After arrest, all arrestees are brought to County Jail 9 where within twenty-four hours of\n5 arriving they are booked and a determination is made as to whether the detainee will be\n6 released or housed pending arraignment.  County Jail 9 is a temporary detention facility and\n7 does not contain accommodations for extended stays.  Thus, all detainees who are classified\n8 for housing are transferred to another one of the CCSF’s jails.  According to defendant,\n9 approximately 50,000 individuals are booked and processed through this system each year.\n10 Under Department policy in effect until January 21 2004,1 all arrestees entering\n11 County Jail 9 were subjected to a pat search and screened by a metal detector.  The policy\nt\nr\nu 12 also provided for strip searches2 of detainees who fell into several categories, including:\no\nC\n  13 arrestees charged with crimes involving narcotics, weapons or violence; arrestees with a\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 criminal history of that type; individuals arrested for a probation violation; individuals\ns D ct of 15 arrested outside of San Francisco; arrestees in transit to another jail; arrestees classified for\nte stri\na Di16 housing in the general jail population; and individuals placed in “safety cells.”  Safety cells\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 are single-occupant, padded cells used to house inmates who were considered a danger to\nUnit or the 18 themselves or others, to be behaving in a “bizarre” manner or to be “gravely disabled.” \nF\n19 Although not provided for in the Department’s written policy, plaintiffs also contend that\n20 defendants maintained a practice of performing strip searches on all detainees who signed a\n21 form indicating that they consented to such searches.\n22 According to defendants, the Department’s strip search policy was applied as follows:\n23 upon arrival at County Jail 9 all inmates who were deemed searchable based on their charge\n24\n1The Department’s new policy, which went into effect in January 2004 and currently\n25 remains in effect, is not at issue in these motions.\n26 2As noted in the Court’s prior order, the Court recognizes that there is a spectrum of\npossible search practices, including strip searches and visual body cavity searches, that fall\n27 within the general rubric of “strip searches.”  The Court and the parties have used this label to\ncover all such practices.  As it has before, the Court will adhere to the understanding that the\n28 distinctions within this category of searches make no difference in the analysis performed for\nthe purposes of this motion. \n2\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220     Filed 09/22/2005     Page 3 of 25(cid:10)\n1 or criminal history were automatically strip searched.  Other arrestees were generally not\n2 strip searched unless they were identified for placement in a safety cell or, through the\n3 booking process, it was determined that the detainee would not be released within twenty-\n4 four hours and therefore would need to be housed in another jail facility.  For example,\n5 individuals who were cited and released, individuals who were temporarily detained because\n6 they were intoxicated, and individuals who said they would be able to post bail would be\n7 classified for release and therefore not be strip searched.  In summary, the Department\n8 adopted a policy of strip searching all individuals who were classified for housing in the\n9 general jail population. \n10 Strip searches at County Jail 9 have led to the discovery of weapons and other\n11 contraband on the persons of arrestees.  Defendant produced evidence that from April 2000\nt\nr\nu 12 through April 2005 strip searches at County Jail 9 resulted in the discovery of 73 cases of\no\nC\n  13 illegal drugs or drug paraphernalia hidden in body cavities.  In that same time period, six\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 weapons were also discovered as a result of strip searches.  In addition, safety cell searches\ns D ct of 15 resulted in the discovery of weapons on three other detainees.3  \nte stri\na Di16 II.  Procedural History\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 Plaintiffs filed this action on April 23, 2003 alleging causes of action based on the\nUnit or the 18 Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, 42 U.S.C. section\nF\n19 1983, and several provisions of state law.  In an order issued June 10, 2004, this Court\n20 granted plaintiffs’ motion to certify a class under Rule 23(b)(3).  The class was defined as:\n21 All persons who, during the applicable period of limitations, and\ncontinuing to date, were arrested on any charge not involving\n22 weapons, controlled substances, or a charge of violence, and not\ninvolving a violation of parole or a violation of probation (where\n23 consent to search is a condition of such probation), and who were\nsubjected to a blanket visual body cavity strip search by\n24 defendants before arraignment at a San Francisco County jail\nfacility without any individualized reasonable suspicion that they\n25\n26 3Notably, defendants provided contraband reports for a period that includes searches\nconducted under both the prior policy and the newer policy.  If these reports are divided into the\n27 two policy periods, the result is that 49 instances of drug-related contraband were discovered\nduring the old regime and 14 instances were discovered after the change.  As for weapons, three\n28 were found in non-safety cell searches prior to enactment of the new policy and three were found\nafterwards.  All safety cell discoveries were made prior to the policy change.\n3\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220     Filed 09/22/2005     Page 4 of 25(cid:10)\n1 were concealing contraband.  This class also includes 1) all\narrestees who were subjected to subsequent blanket strip\n2 search(es) before arraignment after the initial strip search,\nwithout any reasonable individualized suspicion that they had\n3 subsequently acquired and hidden contraband on their persons;\nand 2) all persons who, prior to arraignment, were subjected to\n4 blanket visual body cavity search(es) incident to placement in a\n“safety cell” at any of the San Francisco County jails.\n5\n(emphasis in original).\n6\n   Plaintiffs now move for partial summary judgment with respect to several of their\n7\nclaims and regarding several affirmative defenses.  Defendant Sheriff Hennessey moves for\n8\nsummary judgment that he is protected by qualified immunity.\n9\nDISCUSSION\n10\nI.  Summary Judgment Standard\n11\nt Summary judgment is appropriate when the “pleadings, depositions, answers to\nr\nu 12\no\nC interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is\n  13\nt\nic nia no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a\nistr Califor14 matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  “In considering a motion for summary judgment, the\ns D ct of 15\nte stri court may not weigh the evidence or make credibility determinations, and is required to draw\na Di16\nSt ern  all inferences in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.”  Freeman v. Arpaio, 125\n  h\nUnited or the Nort1178 F.3d 732, 735 (9th Cir. 1997).  A principal purpose of the summary judgment procedure is to\nF identify and dispose of factually unsupported claims.  See Celotex Corp. v. Cattrett, 477 U.S.\n19\n317, 323-24 (1986).\n20\nThe party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of identifying those\n21\nportions of the pleadings, discovery, and affidavits which demonstrate the absence of a\n22\ngenuine issue of material fact.  See id. at 323.  Where the moving party will have the burden\n23\nof proof on an issue at trial, it must affirmatively demonstrate that no reasonable trier of fact\n24\ncould find other than for the moving party.  See id.  Once the moving party meets this initial\n25\nburden, the non-moving party must go beyond the pleadings and by its own evidence “set\n26\nforth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).  The\n27\nnon-moving party must “identify with reasonable particularity the evidence that precludes\n28\nsummary judgment.”  Keenan v. Allan, 91 F.3d 1275, 1279 (9th Cir. 1996) (quoting Richards\n4\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220     Filed 09/22/2005     Page 5 of 25(cid:10)\n1 v. Combined Ins. Co., 55 F.3d 247, 251 (7th Cir. 1995)).  If the non-moving party fails to\n2 make this showing, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  See Celotex,\n3 477 U.S. at 323.\n4 II.  Federal Claims\n5 Plaintiffs move for summary judgment on several issues that underlie their claim that\n6 defendants’ prior strip search policy was unconstitutional pursuant to the Fourth and\n7 Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and therefore is actionable under\n8 42 U.S.C. section 1983.  \n9 The claim that a strip search was performed in violation of the Fourth Amendment is\n10 neither new nor unfamiliar.  In 1979 the Supreme Court reviewed the constitutionality of the\n11 practice of conducting visual body-cavity searches on prison inmates following contact visits\nt\nr\nu 12 by individuals from outside of the prison population.  See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 558\no\nC\n  13 (1979).  The Court remarked that “[t]he test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application.”  Id. at 559.  Instead, “[i]n\ns D ct of 15 each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of\nte stri\na Di16 personal rights that the search entails.”  Id.  The Court concluded that the search practice\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 there at issue was not unconstitutional given the significant interest in preserving safety\nUnit or the 18 within the detention facility and preventing the smuggling of contraband.  Id.  \nF\n19 Since Bell, the Ninth Circuit has taken up the question of the lawfulness of strip\n20 searches in cases like this one involving pre-arraignment arrestees.  In the first case to\n21 consider the subject, Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614 (9th Cir. 1984) (per curiam)\n22 (overruled on other grounds by Hodgers-Durgin v. de la Vina, 199 F.3d 1037, 1041 (9th Cir.\n23 1999) (en banc)), the court announced the governing standard that “arrestees for minor\n24 offenses may be subjected to a strip search only if jail officials have a reasonable suspicion\n25 that the particular arrestee is carrying or concealing contraband or suffering from a\n26 communicable disease.”  746 F.2d at 615.  Such reasonable suspicion may be based on\n27 factors such as “the nature of the offense, the arrestee’s appearance and conduct, and the\n28 prior arrest record.”  Id. at 617.  Applying this standard, the court concluded that the policy\n5\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220     Filed 09/22/2005     Page 6 of 25(cid:10)\n1 of the Bonneville County Jail in Idaho Falls, Idaho, to strip search all arrestees booked there\n2 was unconstitutional.  Id. at 617.  The court found that there was no reasonable suspicion to\n3 support the search of the plaintiff because of the minor nature of the offense (failure to pay\n4 parking tickets), the fact she had no prior record and because she had been cooperative\n5 during the search.  Id. at 618.  \n6 The court has revisited pre-arraignment searches several times, on each occasion\n7 reaffirming the standard laid out by Giles.  Ward v. County of San Diego, 791 F.2d 1329 (9th\n8 Cir. 1986) found no qualified immunity for a San Diego County Sheriff that had enacted a\n9 blanket strip search policy which resulted in the visual body cavity search of a misdemeanor\n10 arrestee prior to a determination regarding the arrestee’s eligibility for an own recognizance\n11 (“O.R.”) release.  See id. at 1333.  In Thompson v. City of Los Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439 (9th\nt\nr\nu 12 Cir. 1989) the court found valid the strip search of a felony grand theft auto arrestee at the\no\nC\n  13 Los Angeles County Jail, stating that the offense in question was “sufficiently associated\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 with violence to justify a visual strip search.”  Id. at 1447.  In a later case, however, the court\ns D ct of 15 found fault with the City of Los Angeles’s blanket policy subjecting all felony arrestees to a\nte stri\na Di16 visual body cavity search and the Los Angeles Police Department’s (“LAPD”) application of\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 that policy to a woman arrested for a grand theft that did not involve drugs or violence.  See\nUnit or the 18 Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Dept., 901 F.2d 702, 710-16 (9th Cir. 1990).  Then, in Fuller\nF\n19 v. M.G. Jewelry, 950 F.2d 1437 (9th Cir. 1991), the court clarified that strip searches in\n20 detention facilities are justified on less than probable cause solely by the need “to protect\n21 prisons and jails from smuggled weapons, drugs or other contraband which pose a threat to\n22 the safety and security of penal institutions.”  Id. at 1447.  The court refused to extend the\n23 reasonable suspicion standard to body cavity searches for ordinary stolen property, id. at\n24 1448, and thus ruled invalid the strip search by the LAPD of two women suspected of having\n25 stolen a ring.  Id. at 1450.  \n26 A.  Facial Attacks\n27 Against this backdrop, plaintiffs move for summary judgment that defendants’ former\n28 strip search policy and custom was facially unconstitutional with respect to several blanket\n6\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220     Filed 09/22/2005     Page 7 of 25(cid:10)\n1 search categories: (1) arrestees with one or more prior convictions or two or more prior\n2 arrests for crimes involving drugs, weapons or violence; (2) arrestees charged with a\n3 probation violation; (3) individuals arrested on a San Francisco warrant outside of San\n4 Francisco County; (4) individuals arrested on a federal charge; (5) individuals held at a San\n5 Francisco jail while in transit to another part of the state; (6) arrestees classified for housing\n6 in a county jail; (7) individuals placed in safety cells; and (8) individuals strip searched\n7 because they signed a consent form.\n8 Defendants do not oppose summary judgment on classifications (1) - (5).  The Court\n9 therefore grants summary judgment with respect to those portions of the policy.  Defendants\n10 do, however, contest that strip searches of arrestees within categories (6) - (8) violate the\n11 Fourth Amendment.  \nt\nr\nu 12 1.  “Classification” Searches\no\nC\n  13 Defendants claim that the jail system’s interest in strip searching pre-trial detainees is\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 at its zenith when arrestees are “classified” for housing in the general jail population.  This is\ns D ct of 15 true because the introduction of outsiders into the jail system--as opposed to the temporary\nte stri\na Di16 detention facilities at County Jail 9--poses heightened safety risks to prisoners and guards\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 alike, given the large number of detainees in the jail system and the extended period of\nUnit or the 18 detention.  Under defendants’ vision of the governing law, these concerns allow for blanket\nF\n19 strip searches without individualized suspicion.  This position, however, fails in the face of\n20 Ninth Circuit precedent to the contrary.\n21 Although defendants are correct that the government’s penological interests are\n22 heightened when temporary detainees are introduced into the general jail population, such\n23 intermingling on its own does not create reasonable suspicion to perform a strip search.  As\n24 stated by the Ninth Circuit, although the fact an arrestee is to be “placed into contact with the\n25 general jail population” is one important factor among many that may be considered in\n26 / / /\n27 / / /\n28 / / /\n7\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220     Filed 09/22/2005     Page 8 of 25(cid:10)\n1  gauging the reasonableness of a search, “such a factor by itself cannot justify a strip\n2 search.”4  Thompson, 885 F.2d at 1447; see also Giles, 746 F.2d at 618-19 (rejecting the\n3 notion that placement in the general jail population was enough to validate a strip search\n4 because “intermingling is both limited and avoidable” (citation and internal quotation\n5 omitted)).  Rather than relying on intermingling, the Ninth Circuit has instead found that “the\n6 reasonableness determination . . . hinges upon the nature of the . . . offense with which [the\n7 arrestee] was charged.”  Thompson, 885 F.2d at 1447.  \n8 Acknowledging this precedent, defendants insist that the intermingling of temporary\n9 detainees with the general population is not the sole basis for strip searches in this case;\n10 instead they claim that this factor combined with the documented record of serious and\n11 widespread contraband smuggling at San Francisco’s jails together provide justification for\nt\nr\nu 12 the blanket policy.  They claim that a threat of these proportions was not present in the\no\nC\n  13 Bonneville jail considered in Giles, and thus the individualized suspicion limitation\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 articulated there does not extend to this case.\ns D ct of 15 / / /\nte stri\na Di16\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 4Defendants claim that Fuller is to the contrary.   There the Ninth Circuit cited with\nUnit or the 18 aCpirp.r 1o9v8al7 t)h. e T Shiaxtt hc aCseir fcouuitn’sd  dtheacti sai ocno uinn tDy ohbardo wnootl srukny ja vfo. uJel foffe rtshoen F Couorutnht ya,m 8e2n3d mF.e2ndt  9w5h5e (r6e tiht\nF had initially conducted a pat down search and did not perform a strip search until the plaintiff\n19 “was about to be moved into contact with the general jail population.”  Fuller, 950 F.2d at 1448\n(quoting Dobrowolskyj, 823 F.2d at 958).  \n20\nHowever, Fuller also approvingly cited a later Sixth Circuit case,  Masters v. Crouch, 872\n21 F.2d 1248 (6th Cir. 1989), for the proposition that the “fact that [the] detainee was intermingled\nwith other inmates has never alone been found to justify a strip search without considering the\n22 nature of the offense and whether the detainee might attempt to introduce weapons or contraband\ninto the institution.”  Fuller, 950 F.2d at 1448 (emphasis added) (quoting Masters, 872 F.2d at\n23 1254).  Master relied in part on Hill v. Bogans, 735 F.2d 391 (10th Cir. 1984), which found that\n“intermingling [with the prison population] is only one factor to consider in judging the\n24 constitutionality of a strip search,” id. at 394, and that where, as were the circumstances there,\n“[n]o other conceivable justification exists for the strip search,” id., the search is invalid.  See\n25 id. (considering the nature of the offense at issue and finding that it was “not commonly\nassociated by its very nature with the possession of weapons or contraband”).  \n26\nA fair reading of Fuller leads to the conclusion that the court there, consistent with\n27 Thompson and the governing law in the Ninth Circuit, treated the intermingling of an arrestee\nwith the general jail population as only one factor among many that might justify a search.\n28 Notably, Thompson cited both Dobrowolskyj and Masters in arriving at its conclusion that\nintermingling alone does not justify a strip search.  See Thompson, 885 F.2d at 1447.\n8\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220     Filed 09/22/2005     Page 9 of 25(cid:10)\n1 As has the Ninth Circuit on several occasions, this Court recognizes the pressing need\n2 to maintain security in jails and prisons and the real and profound threats posed by the\n3 introduction of weapons and drugs into that environment.  See, e.g., Thompson, 885 F.2d at\n4 1446 (“the prevention of the introduction of weapons and other contraband into the jail . . . is\n5 indeed an extremely weighty interest”);  Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 713 (“These concerns and this\n6 interest no doubt are weighty.”).  However, defendants claim that the Giles test does not\n7 extend to urban jails is belied by subsequent cases.  Thompson specifically rejected the\n8 notion that intermingling alone--without consideration of some individualized basis for\n9 suspicion--was enough to justify a strip search and did so in the context of the Los Angeles\n10 County Jail system.  \n11 To adopt defendants’ view that the severity of the smuggling problem can justify a\nt\nr\nu 12 blanket strip search policy would be to ignore the consistent holdings of the Ninth Circuit\no\nC\n  13 that reasonable suspicion may only be founded upon facts that are particular to the individual\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 arrestee.  See Giles, 746 F.2d at 615 (holding that there must be reasonable suspicion that\ns D ct of 15 “the particular arrestee” is concealing contraband); Ward, 791 F.2d at 1333 (summing up\nte stri\na Di16 Giles’ holding as requiring “individualized suspicion”); Thompson, 885 F.2d at 1446 (“the\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 arresting officers must have reasonable individualized suspicion”).  Such individualized\nUnit or the 18 suspicion may arise from knowledge of specific facts about the individual defendant,\nF\n19 including “the nature of the offense, the arrestee’s appearance and conduct, and the prior\n20 arrest record.”  Giles 746 F.2d at 617.  It is not enough, as defendants would have it, for the\n21 government to demonstrate that contraband smuggling is a significant problem.  Instead,\n22 there must be some reasonable relationship between the criteria used to identify individuals\n23 as eligible for a strip search and the interest in preventing the introduction of contraband. \n24 See Giles, 746 F.2d at 618 (reasonableness requirement under the Fourth Amendment\n25 requires that the strip search bear some “discernible relationship to security needs” (quoting\n26 Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007, 1013 (4th Cir. 1981)).  \n27 Defendants’ policy of strip searching all arrestees classified for housing in the general\n28 jail population, coupled with their knowledge of a widespread problem with contraband\n9\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220     Filed 09/22/2005     Page 10 of 25(cid:10)\n1 smuggling in the jail system, is an invalid basis for the blanket policy because these two facts\n2 say nothing about whether an individual arrestee classified pursuant to this policy may be\n3 concealing weapons or drugs.  Individuals destined for housing in the jail may have been\n4 classified as such solely because they are not able to post bail or because they have not yet\n5 received an O.R. review.5  Yet the Ninth Circuit has rejected the view that these reasons\n6 alone can justify a strip search.  See Ward, 791 F.2d at 1333 (citing with approval Tinetti v.\n7 Wittke, 479 F.Supp. 486, 490 (E.D. Wis. 1979) in which the court found unconstitutional the\n8 strip search without reasonable suspicion of an individual who was unable to post bond); id.\n9 (“In most instances the unreasonableness of a strip search conducted prior to an O.R. release\n10 determination is plain.”).\n11 Had defendants been able to proffer evidence demonstrating a high level of smuggling\nt\nr\nu 12 by individuals classified for housing who were not charged with crimes involving weapons,\no\nC\n  13 drugs or violence (or within another valid strip search category) then an issue of fact may\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 have been created.  See Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 713 (stressing the importance of\ns D ct of 15 documentation supporting the assertion that arrestees within the strip search category\nte stri\na Di16 smuggle contraband into the jail in greater frequency than arrestees outside of the category). \nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 Such a showing may have demonstrated that the charge alone was not enough to identify\nUnit or the 18 potential smugglers and supported a reasonable suspicion that other classes of individuals\nF\n19 destined for the jail were likely to be carrying contraband.  The evidence produced by\n20 defendants does not support such a theory.  While defendants did produce dozens of reports\n21 regarding the discovery of contraband during strip searches, the reports fail to provide any\n22 indication of the charges of the searched individuals or the reason why they were searched. \n23 Absent such evidence there is no reasonable relationship between the criteria triggering a\n24 search (classification for housing) and the interest in conducting the search (eliminating the\n25 introduction of contraband).  See id. (finding the policy at issue unconstitutional because it\n26\n27\n5Indeed one witness testified that the O.R. staff at County Jail 9 is only available to\n28 perform interviews for eight hours a day.  Individuals who were not given an O.R. interview\nduring the booking process were nonetheless sent for a housing classification.\n10\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220     Filed 09/22/2005     Page 11 of 25(cid:10)\n1 rested on assumptions and societal judgments, rather than on careful deliberation and\n2 documentary evidence). \n3 Accordingly, the Court concludes that the Department’s former policy requiring strip\n4 searches of all detainees classified for housing in the general jail population without any\n5 consideration of the crime charged or any other individualized factors was unconstitutional. \n6 This, however, does not end the inquiry:\n7 [A] search, although not supportable under an institutional\npolicy, is not per se unconstitutional. [After determining the\n8 policy is invalid, the court] must . . . examine the particular\ncircumstances surrounding [the detainee’s] arrest to determine\n9 whether there was reasonable suspicion to conduct a visual body-\ncavity search\n10\nKennedy, 901 F.2d at 715; see also Tardiff v. Knox County, 364 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2004). \n11\nt Except with regard to the individual plaintiffs discussed below, the Court does not today\nr\nu 12\no\nC reach the question of whether searches performed on individual members of the class were\n  13\nt\nic nia justified based on facts particular to the individual search.  See Bull v. City & County of San\nistr Califor14 Francisco, No. 03-1840, Memorandum & Order (Doc. # 162), slip op. at 11 (N.D. Cal. June\ns D ct of 15\nte stri 10, 2004) (stating that where the policy cannot by itself justify a search “it is a fair guess that\na Di16\nSt ern  most arrestees were searched” on the basis of the policy although “any potential\n  h\nUnited or the Nort1178 individualized issues can be addressed later in the litigation and do not defeat class\nF certification”).\n19\n2.  Safety Cell Searches\n20\nPlaintiffs also challenge the Department’s policy of automatically strip searching\n21\ndetainees on the sole basis that they have been designated for placement in a safety cell. \n22\nDetainees were placed in a safety cell if they fit into one of six categories:  “1.  She/he\n23\ndisplays bizarre behavior which results in the destruction of property.  2.  She/he displays\n24\nbizarre behavior which reveals an intent to cause self-inflicted harm.  3.  She/he appears\n25\ngravely disabled and less restrictive housing is unavailable.  4.  She/he appears to be a danger\n26\nto self or others.  5.  She/he requests to use the safety cell.  6.  For observation only, if it is\n27\ndetermined by direct observation that the prisoner has ingested items that may cause injury.” \n28\n“Safety Cell Use” I.A.  From these classifications it appears that individuals were generally\n11\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220     Filed 09/22/2005     Page 12 of 25(cid:10)\n1 placed in a safety cell, and therefore strip searched, if prison officials determined that the\n2 individual appeared to be suffering from mental illness or was otherwise mentally unstable\n3 such that there was a perceived risk that the detainee might engage in violent or self-\n4 destructive conduct.  Plaintiffs contend that the chosen categories are vague and overbroad,\n5 and therefore seek a ruling that the policy is unconstitutional on its face.\n6 The Court first notes that the law on this subject is not clearly established.  Neither\n7 party has found any case that discusses strip searches of pre-arraignment detainees based on\n8 the determination that the individual is psychologically unstable.  Of course, such detainees\n9 present unique and substantial safety concerns that prison officials should be free to address,\n10 in part, by ensuring that the detainees are not hiding weapons or other contraband that may be\n11 used to harm themselves or others.  Defendants here have presented evidence that mentally\nt\nr\nu 12 unstable detainees in San Francisco’s jail system have hidden contraband and have used such\no\nC\n  13 contraband in attempts to harm themselves or others.  These findings are even more serious\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 in light of the Eighth Amendment obligations of jail mangers to prevent prisoner suicide. \ns D ct of 15 See Woodward v. Correctional Medical Services, 368 F.3d 917, 929 (7th Cir. 2004).  \nte stri\na Di16 Standing against these valid safety concerns are the fundamental privacy interests that\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 are infringed by the extreme intrusiveness of a strip search.  These interests are no less\nUnit or the 18 profound when the subject of the search is mentally disturbed.  See Aiken v. Nixon, 236\nF\n19 F.Supp.2d 211, 233 (N.D.N.Y. 2002) (discussing privacy interests in the context of strip\n20 searches of individuals held in a psychiatric hospital).  \n21 The interests at stake in safety cell searches (prison safety and prisoner privacy) are\n22 therefore identical to those considered in Giles and its progeny.  The Court therefore finds\n23 that the Giles requirement of reasonable individualized suspicion is the appropriate test for\n24 strip searches of pre-arraignment detainees believed to be a danger to themselves or others\n25 due to mental instability.  See Aiken, 236 F.Supp.2d at 233-34 (adopting “reasonable\n26 suspicion” standard for strip searches of individuals who voluntarily admitted themselves\n27 into a psychiatric hospital).  As articulated by Giles, important factors include “the nature of\n28 the offense, the arrestee’s appearance and conduct, and the prior arrest record.”  746 F.2d at\n12\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220     Filed 09/22/2005     Page 13 of 25(cid:10)\n1 617.  Of course, in this context different conduct and charges may justify a search than in the\n2 ordinary case.  For example conduct indicating a detainee may be mentally disturbed in a\n3 manner that may lead to unpredictable and potentially harmful conduct could serve as a valid\n4 justification for a search.  In addition, the searches may be based on a suspicion that types of\n5 “contraband” not ordinarily believed to be dangerous, such as shoelaces and other items used\n6 for self-strangulation, may be hidden.  Nonetheless, the basic framework articulated in Giles\n7 remains the appropriate analytical procedure to evaluate these claims.  \n8 Turning to the policy at issue, the constitutionality of a policy that requires that all\n9 individuals placed in a safety cell be strip searched depends on the reasons for the safety cell\n10 placement.  Under Giles, if the policy requires a reasonable individualized suspicion that the\n11 detainee may be concealing drugs or other dangerous contraband, then the policy should be\nt\nr\nu 12 upheld.  In the context of mentally unstable detainees, this Court finds that individualized\no\nC\n  13 suspicion can be founded upon behavior or circumstances indicating that the detainee may be\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 a danger to herself or others.  Such behavior gives rise to legitimately heightened concerns\ns D ct of 15 that the detainee could be concealing “contraband” that might be used for harmful purposes,\nte stri\na Di16 and thus serves as a reasonable basis for a strip search.\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 Here, some criteria identified by the policy at issue are reasonably related to this\nUnit or the 18 security interest.  These are categories 2 (“bizarre behavior” and “intent to cause self-\nF\n19 inflicted harm”); 4 (“danger to self or others”); and 6 (“ingested items that may cause\n20 injury”).  However, the other categories do not reveal a similar level of relatedness to the\n21 interest in safety.  Category 1 (“bizarre behavior” and “destruction of property”), for\n22 example, could be applied to an individual who has done nothing more than acted in a\n23 “bizarre” fashion and committed vandalism.  Category 3 (“gravely disabled” and “housing\n24 unavailable”) could easily be applied to a physically disabled person who for safety reasons\n25 should not be placed in an ordinary cell.  Similarly, there is no requirement in category 5\n26 (“requests to use the safety cell”) that an officer make an individualized determination that\n27 the detainee raises safety concerns.  See Aiken, 236 F.Supp.2d at 233-34 (concluding that\n28 individuals who voluntarily admit themselves to a psychiatric ward do not surrender all\n13\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220     Filed 09/22/2005     Page 14 of 25(cid:10)\n1 privacy protections and that strip searches of such admittees must be based on reasonable\n2 suspicion of concealed drugs or weapons, but not other concealed items).\n3 Plaintiffs would have this Court go further and declare all of the safety cell categories\n4 to be so overbroad and vague as to be unconstitutional on their face.  Admittedly, none of the\n5 categories are defined with objective terms that substantially constrain the individual\n6 officer’s discretion.  However, the process of identifying particular conduct that is indicative\n7 of psychiatric disturbance which in turn signals a propensity for violent or self-destructive\n8 conduct is inherently subjective and cannot be easily reduced to objective terms.  For this\n9 reason, officers must be given considerable latitude in making this kind of determination. \n10 Thus it was reasonable for the Department to craft a policy that leaves broad discretion with\n11 the individual officer.  \nt\nr\nu 12 However, since such discretion is to be exercised by the individual officers, the Fourth\no\nC\n  13 Amendment analysis must focus on the factors considered by those officers.  An individual\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 officer’s subjective finding that a detainee was a danger to self or others, without any facts\ns D ct of 15 articulated in support, is not enough to end the inquiry into whether a particular search was\nte stri\na Di16 constitutional.  Thus, although the Department’s policy of allowing individual officers broad\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 discretion to determine which detainees pose a danger to themselves or others is not\nUnit or the 18 unconstitutional on its face, plaintiffs may still prevail on their section 1983 claims by\nF\n19 showing that the individual officers exercised such discretion in an unconstitutional manner. \n20 For example, plaintiff Miki Mangosing was placed in a safety cell and strip searched\n21 pursuant to the determination that she was a danger to herself.  Records indicate that she was\n22 perceived to be under the influence, out of control and unable to remain in a sobering cell. \n23 Whether these and other facts support the responsible officers’ conclusion that Mangosing\n24 was a risk to herself is a question to be resolved by the appropriate factfinder.\n25 In summary, the Court finds that the Department’s policy of strip searching all\n26 individuals placed in a safety cell, without regard for the reasons for the particular placement,\n27 is unconstitutional on its face.  Further, even with respect to searches conducted under the\n28 policy pursuant to the determination that a detainee is a danger to self or others, that\n14\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220     Filed 09/22/2005     Page 15 of 25(cid:10)\n1 determination is not enough by itself to justify a search.  In such cases, where a plaintiff can\n2 show that the individual officer had not conducted the search based on reasonable suspicion\n3 (i.e. where the officer was unreasonable in finding that the detainee was a danger to self or\n4 others) there may be liability pursuant to section 1983.\n5 3.  Consent Searches\n6 Plaintiffs assert that the Department’s alleged practice of searching all individuals that\n7 provided consent to be strip searched is unconstitutional.  However, the Court need not reach\n8 this issue because, as defendants point out, none of the named plaintiffs have claimed that\n9 they were strip searched because they signed a consent form.    \n10 B.  Reasonable Suspicion as to Individual Plaintiffs \n11 1.  Plaintiffs Zern and Corneau\nt\nr\nu 12 In addition to their facial attack on the Department’s policy as a whole, plaintiffs ask\no\nC\n  13 in their motion for summary judgment that plaintiffs Jonah Zern and Marcie Corneau are\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 members of the class.  Specifically, plaintiffs challenge the claim that these two individuals\ns D ct of 15 were arrested on charges of violence.  \nte stri\na Di16 Zern was charged with a violation of California Penal Code section 148.10, which\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 describes the crime of: \nUnit or the 18 resist[ing] a peace officer in the discharge or attempt to discharge\nF any duty of his or her office or employment and [where the]\n19 willful resistance proximately causes death or serious bodily\ninjury to a peace officer \n20\nSee Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 705 (referring to statutory definition in the process of determining\n21\nwhether a particular charge is a charge of violence).  Plaintiffs claim that this charge is not\n22\nsufficient to provide reasonable suspicion because the statute does not require that the\n23\ninjuries to the officer result from force or violence.  \n24\nThe Ninth Circuit has held that “in some cases, the charge itself may give rise to\n25\nreasonable suspicion” Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 716 (citing Thompson 885 F.2d at 1447).  In\n26\nThompson the Court held that the charge of grand theft auto provided reasonable suspicion\n27\nbecause that crime is “sufficiently associated with violence.”  Thompson, 885 F.2d at 1447. \n28\nSimilarly, although a violation of Penal Code section 148.10 does not necessarily involve\n15\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220     Filed 09/22/2005     Page 16 of 25(cid:10)\n1 force or violence, the crime is sufficiently related to violent conduct that the charge by itself\n2 justifies a strip search.\n3 The same is true with respect to plaintiff Corneau.  She was arrested and charged\n4 pursuant to California Penal Code section 243(e), which criminalizes a battery “committed\n5 against a spouse. . . .”  Battery is defined under California law as “any willful and unlawful\n6 use of force or violence upon the person of another.”  Cal. Penal Code § 242.  Once again,\n7 although plaintiffs may be correct that a violation of section 243(e) does not necessarily\n8 involve violence, the crime is sufficiently associated with violent criminal conduct to justify\n9 a strip search.\n10 Therefore, plaintiffs Zern and Corneau are not members of the class.  Defendants have\n11 renewed their earlier motion for summary judgment as to these plaintiffs.  Because the Court\nt\nr\nu 12 finds that the searches conducted on these individuals was based on reasonable suspicion, the\no\nC\n  13 motion is granted.\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 2.  Plaintiffs Bull, Mangosing and Timbrook\ns D ct of 15 As discussed above, even where the strip search policy was invalid a particular search\nte stri\na Di16 may still be found valid if the circumstances of the individual case created a reasonable\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 suspicion.  Plaintiffs contend that there is no basis for concluding that there was a reasonable\nUnit or the 18 suspicion as to plaintiffs Mary Bull, Miki Mangosing, and Laura Timbrook.  However,\nF\n19 plaintiffs Bull and Mangosing were each searched pursuant to the Department’s safety cell\n20 policy.  The Court previously noted that these types of searches are deeply grounded in the\n21 particular circumstances of the search and do not lend themselves easily to a broad brush\n22 approach.  Moreover, there is substantial evidence in the record from which a reasonable\n23 factfinder could conclude that both Bull and Mangosing were searched based on a reasonable\n24 suspicion that they might harm themselves or others.  For example an initial psychological\n25 report regarding Bull states that she was “completely out of touch with reality,” that “[s]he\n26 murmurs and smiles to herself very inappropriately,” that “she is not responding to contact,”\n27 and that she “[a]t times seems to be talking to someone invisible.”  A housing report\n28 regarding Mangosing states that she was “out of control.”  Accepting these accounts as true\n16\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220     Filed 09/22/2005     Page 17 of 25(cid:10)\n1 and viewing them in the light most favorable to defendants, it is clear that summary judgment\n2 should not be granted as to whether reasonable suspicion existed to strip search these\n3 plaintiffs.\n4 However, the Court reaches a different conclusion with respect to plaintiff Timbrook. \n5 The record reveals that Timbrook was arrested pursuant to warrants for displaying a false\n6 identification, possession of a forged check with intent to defraud and burglary.  After arrest,\n7 Timbrook was classified for housing in the general jail population.  Defendant has not\n8 opposed the motion for summary judgment in Timbrook’s favor and the Court finds nothing\n9 in the record that would support the conclusion that there was reasonable individualized\n10 suspicion which supported the decision to strip search her.  As such, the motion is granted\n11 with respect to plaintiff Timbrook. \nt\nr\nu 12 C.  Qualified Immunity\no\nC\n  13 Sheriff Michael Hennessey moves for partial summary judgment on his defense of\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 qualified immunity, claiming that the law discussed above was not sufficiently clearly\ns D ct of 15 established at the time the policy was in effect and that he was reasonable in crafting it as he\nte stri\na Di16 did.  \nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 Qualified immunity protects “government officials . . . from liability for civil damages\nUnit or the 18 insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights\nF\n19 of which a reasonable person would have known.”  Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818\n20 (1982).  Qualified immunity operates “to ensure that before they are subjected to suit,\n21 officers are on notice their conduct is unlawful.”  Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 206 (2001). \n22 In considering a claim of qualified immunity, a court must first determine whether the\n23 plaintiffs have alleged the deprivation of an actual constitutional right.  See id. at 201.  If\n24 they have, the court must then determine whether that right was clearly established at the\n25 time of the violation.  See id.   The relevant inquiry is whether it would be clear to a\n26 reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.  Id. at 202. \n27 The clearly established test is met if “‘in light of the pre-existing law the unlawfulness [is]\n28 apparent.’”  Galvin v. Hay, 361 F.3d 1134, 1139 (9th Cir. 2004) (quoting Hope v. Pelzer, 536\n17\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220     Filed 09/22/2005     Page 18 of 25(cid:10)\n1 U.S. 730, 739 (2002)).  Even if an officer’s actions violate a constitutional right, a reasonable\n2 but mistaken belief that his conduct was lawful would result in the grant of qualified\n3 immunity.  Wilkins v. City of Oakland, 350 F.3d 949, 955 (9th Cir. 2003).\n4 Here, Sheriff Hennessey is not protected by qualified immunity from a suit based on\n5 his decision to create a blanket policy of strip searching all individuals classified for housing\n6 in the general jail population.  As discussed above, the policy did violate plaintiffs’\n7 constitutional rights.  Moreover, the right was clearly established: in an unbroken line of\n8 precedent tracing back to 1984 the Ninth Circuit has reaffirmed the fundamental holding of\n9 Giles that a strip search of a pre-arraignment detainee must be supported by reasonable\n10 individualized suspicion.  It was also abundantly clear after Thompson that placement in the\n11 general jail population cannot “by itself cannot justify a strip search.”  Thompson, 885 F.2d\nt\nr\nu 12 at 1447.  Given this clear precedent, the Court finds that reasonable minds could not differ as\no\nC\n  13 to what the law required. \nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 The legal landscape was far different as to safety cell strip searches.  At the time the\ns D ct of 15 policy was made there was little if any authority regarding searches of mentally ill or\nte stri\na Di16 intoxicated detainees in a jail setting.  Although this Court finds that Giles provides\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 substantial guidance regarding how this question should be addressed, that precedent does\nUnit or the 18 not necessarily compel the result reached here.  Accordingly, the law regarding safety cell\nF\n19 searches was not clearly established and therefore Sheriff Hennessey’s motion is granted on\n20 this issue.\n21 D.  Monell Claims\n22 In their answer, defendants assert the affirmative defense that “[t]he complaint fails to\n23 state a federal civil rights claim against the defendants under the doctrine announced in\n24 Monell v. Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978).”  Plaintiffs move for\n25 summary judgment that this defense is inapplicable.  \n26 In Monell, the Supreme Court held that if the “execution of a government’s policy or\n27 custom, whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to\n28 represent official policy, inflicts the injury [then] the government as an entity is responsible\n18\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220     Filed 09/22/2005     Page 19 of 25(cid:10)\n1 under § 1983.”  Id. at 694.  To establish such municipal liability, a plaintiff must satisfy four\n2 conditions: “(1) that [the plaintiff] possessed a constitutional right of which he was deprived; \n3 (2) that the municipality had a policy;  (3) that this policy ‘amounts to deliberate\n4 indifference’ to the plaintiff's constitutional right;  and (4) that the policy is the ‘moving\n5 force behind the constitutional violation.’”  Van Ort v. Estate of Stanewich, 92 F.3d 831, 835\n6 (9th Cir. 1996) (quoting Oviatt v. Pearce, 954 F.2d 1470, 1474 (9th Cir.1992) (citation\n7 omitted)).  \n8 It is clear that the Department’s policy requiring strip searches of all individuals\n9 classified for housing creates municipal liability under Monell.  Defendant has not contested\n10 this was an official written policy of the City and County of San Francisco.  Nor is there any\n11 dispute that the policy was the “moving force” behind the constitutional violations.  The\nt\nr\nu 12 policy clearly required individual officers to search all detainees classified for housing,\no\nC\n  13 without consideration of individualized suspicion.  The City and County of San Francisco is\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 therefore liable under Monell.  As such, plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment on that\ns D ct of 15 issue is granted.\nte stri\na Di16 However, a closer analysis is necessary when considering whether CCSF is liable for\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 the safety cell strip search policy.  Plaintiffs have not presented evidence that the failure of\nUnit or the 18 the department to provide more specific restrictions on safety cell strip searches was the\nF\n19 “moving force” behind the alleged violations of the detainees’ constitutional rights.  Instead,\n20 plaintiffs claim that plaintiff Mary Bull was subjected to a safety cell strip search because she\n21 refused to submit to a “classification” strip search.  However, even accepting these\n22 allegations as true, such conduct would amount to a violation of the Department’s safety cell\n23 strip search policy and therefore would not create municipal liability.  See Henry v. County\n24 of Shasta, 132 F.3d 512, 521 (9th Cir. 1997) (suggesting that there is no Monell claim where\n25 the officers acted “in violation of the orders or policies that governed their conduct”). \n26 Plaintiffs also contend that Miki Mangosing was unconstitutionally strip searched after she\n27 was placed in a safety cell pursuant to a finding that she was a danger to herself.  However,\n28 the constitutionality of such a search would depend on whether the individual officers who\n19\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220     Filed 09/22/2005     Page 20 of 25(cid:10)\n1 chose to place her in a safety cell had reasonable suspicion to believe that she was carrying\n2 concealed contraband.  It is therefore clear that in each of these cases if the search involved\n3 was unconstitutional, the proper defendant would be the individual officers who decided that\n4 the search should be conducted.  Under these circumstances, it is not enough that the\n5 Department left substantial discretion in the hands of the individual officers making safety\n6 cell placement determinations.  In order for there to be municipal liability, plaintiffs must\n7 show that the policy was a moving force behind the constitutional violations and that the\n8 Department’s decision not to further restrict officers’ discretion to order safety cell searches\n9 amounted to deliberate indifference on the part of the policymakers.  Plaintiffs’ have not\n10 made such a showing and therefore their motion for summary judgment on this issue is\n11 denied.\nt\nr\nu 12 E.  Other Affirmative Defenses\no\nC\n  13 Plaintiffs have also moved for summary judgment on defendants’ affirmative defenses\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 that the Sheriff is not a “person” liable under section 1983 and that the Sheriff is immune\ns D ct of 15 from exemplary and punitive damages.  Plaintiffs also ask for summary judgment with\nte stri\na Di16 respect to the affirmative defenses of estoppel, assumption of risk, and comparative\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 negligence.  Defendants have not opposed any of these motions and they are therefore\nUnit or the 18 granted.\nF\n19 III.  State Claims\n20 Plaintiffs also move for summary judgment on their strip search claims under\n21 California Penal Code section 4030 and the California Constitution.   \n22 A.  Penal Code Section 4030\n23 California Penal Code Section 4030 makes unlawful and provides civil liability for\n24 certain classes of strip searches of pre-arraignment misdemeanor detainees. Defendants claim\n25 that insofar as some members of the class were strip searched after they were declared\n26 eligible for housing in the general jail population, such plaintiffs cannot state a claim for\n27 relief under section 4030.  The parties’ dispute in this regard centers on two portions of\n28 section 4030.  Subdivision (f) of the statute provides in pertinent part:\n20\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220     Filed 09/22/2005     Page 21 of 25(cid:10)\n1 No person arrested and held in custody on a misdemeanor or\ninfraction offense, except those involving weapons, controlled\n2 substances or violence . . . shall be subjected to a strip search or\nvisual body cavity search prior to placement in the general jail\n3 population, unless a peace officer has determined there is\nreasonable suspicion based on specific and articulable facts to\n4 believe such person is concealing a weapon or contraband, and a\nstrip search will result in the discovery of the weapon or\n5 contraband. \n6 (emphasis added).\n7 Subdivision (g) of section 4030 next provides that:\n8 [N]o person arrested and held in custody on a misdemeanor or\ninfraction offense not involving weapons, controlled substances\n9 or violence, shall be confined in the general jail population unless\nall of the following are true: (i) The person is not cited and\n10 released[;] (ii) The person is not released on his or her own\nrecognizance pursuant to Article 9 (commencing with Section\n11 1318) of Chapter 1 of Title 10 of Part 2[;] (iii) The person is not\nt able to post bail within a reasonable time not less than three\nr\nu 12 hours.\no\nC\n  13 Relying on several statements in the legislative history, defendants take the position\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 that these two sections, when read together, allow a strip search to be performed either if\ns D ct of 15 there is reasonable suspicion or if the three conditions of subdivision (g) are met.  For\nte stri\na Di16 example, prior to the passage of the bill that became section 4030, the legislative counsel\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 concluded that\nUnit or the 18 [u]nder the proposed Section 4030 of the Penal Code, a person\nF may be strip searched prior to the actual placement of the person\n19 in the general jail population, after the requirements of\nsubdivision (g) for that placement have been met, without the\n20 need for compliance with the requirements of subdivision (f).\n21 “Strip Searches--#5001” Letter to Honorable Marian Bergeson from Ben E. Dale (Feb. 27,\n22 1984) available at 6 Cal. Assembly Journal 11304 (1983-84 Reg. Sess.).  Statements in the\n23 legislative history by the Senate, Assembly and the Governor at the time of passage adopt the\n24 view of the legislative counsel, thus lending further support to defendants’ interpretation.  \n25 Plaintiffs respond with a citation to the later opinion of the California Attorney\n26 General, which concludes that section 4030 prohibits warrantless pre-arraignment strip\n27 searches absent reasonable suspicion “prior to the placement of [the detainee] in the general\n28 population.”  See Cal. Att’y Gen. Opinion No. 88-1201 (July 6, 1989).  \n21\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220     Filed 09/22/2005     Page 22 of 25(cid:10)\n1 The parties dispute arises out of the ambiguity of the phrase “prior to placement in the\n2 general jail population” that is used in subdivision (f) and repeated by the Attorney General’s\n3 opinion.  The term “placement” in this phrase could reasonably be interpreted to refer either\n4 to the physical delivery of a detainee to the “general jail” structure, or any number of points\n5 in time before then, although after the subdivision (g) requirements are met.  It is an accepted\n6 principle of statutory interpretation that given such ambiguity reference to the legislative\n7 history is allowed.  See Day v. City of Fontana, 25 Cal.4th 268, 272 (Cal. 2001); see\n8 generally Stephen Breyer, On the Uses of Legislative History in Interpreting Statutes, 65 S.\n9 Cal. L. Rev. 845 (1992).  Here, the legislative history confirms that “placement” under the\n10 statute occurs at some time “prior to the actual placement of the person in the general jail\n11 population” (emphasis added), but at some point after the three prerequisites for jail\nt\nr\nu 12 confinement contained in subdivision (g) are met.  Thus the Court finds that section 4030 is\no\nC\n  13 not violated where a warrantless pre-arraignment strip search is performed without\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 reasonable suspicion prior to a detainee physically arriving in the general jail population.\ns D ct of 15 This, however, does not end the inquiry.  Some ambiguity remains regarding whether\nte stri\na Di16 a search may be performed on any prearraignment detainee who satisfies the three conditions\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 described in subdivision (g).  Defendant claims that these three factors are sufficient to\nUnit or the 18 justify a search under the statute.  The Court rejects this view.  If defendants were correct, the\nF\n19 statute would be reduced to nothing more than a three-hour waiting period for strip searches\n20 of any arrestee who is not able to post bail.  This is true because the nonoccurrence of the\n21 events described in subdivisions (g)(1) and (g)(2) is entirely within the control of the\n22 detaining officials.  Nothing in the legislative history requires such a sweeping result, and the\n23 clear text of the statute counsels against it.  The legislative counsel’s opinion states only that\n24 searches may be conducted “prior to . . . actual placement.”  This reasonable statement\n25 cannot be converted into the sweeping conclusion that satisfaction of the subdivision (g)\n26 factors alone is both necessary and sufficient to justify a search without reasonable suspicion. \n27 That view is contrary to the express intent of the statute to protect detainees’ civil rights by\n28 limiting strip searches.  See Cal. Penal Code § 4030(a) (“It is the intent of the Legislature in\n22\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220     Filed 09/22/2005     Page 23 of 25(cid:10)\n1 enacting this section to protect the state and federal constitutional rights of the people of\n2 California . . . by strictly limiting strip and body cavity searches.”).  Rather than adopting this\n3 radical view,6 the Court instead finds that a search without reasonable suspicion may take\n4 place consistent with section 4030 after: (1) the three subdivision (g) conditions are met; and\n5 (2) the circumstances demonstrate that the individual detainee is actually destined for the\n6 general jail population absent some unexpected reason for release. \n7 Here, defendants have asserted that detainees assigned for housing were not strip\n8 searched until detainees were to be “dressed in” to attire appropriate for the general jail\n9 population.  Confirming this fact, after removing their own clothes and being strip searched,\n10 inmates were instructed to put on prison uniforms.  Assuming these facts are true, searches\n11 under these circumstances did not run afoul of section 4030.  \nt\nr\nu 12 B.  State Law Immunities\no\nC\n  13 Defendants next claim that the city is immune from liability under section 4030\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 because California Government Code section 844.67 provides immunity for public entities\ns D ct of 15 from suits brought by prisoners.  However, section 4030 was enacted several years after\nte stri\na Di16 section 844.6 and explicitly provides a private right of action for any detainee aggrieved by a\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 violation of the state.  See Cal. Penal Code § 4030(p).  Of course, there are only two classes\nUnit or the 18 of conceivable defendants in the civil suits contemplated by this private right of action:\nF\n19 public entities making strip search policies and individual officers executing such policies.   \n20 Thus to find that the earlier-enacted immunity prevails over the later-enacted cause of action\n21 would be to nullify at least half of the potential scope of the private cause of action. \n22\n23 6The Court also rejects plaintiffs’ view that subdivision (g) prohibits incorporation of an\ninmate into the general jail population prior to an O.R. hearing.  The clear text of the statute is\n24 to  the  contrary  and  requires  only  that  the  detainee  “is  not  released  on  his  or  her  own\nrecognizance pursuant to” Penal Code section 1318 et seq., which governs O.R. releases.  This\n25 language clearly requires only the nonoccurrence of an O.R. release, and creates no substantive\nrights to a hearing prior to housing in the general jail population.   \n26\n7The statute states: “(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, except as\n27 provided  in  this  section  and  in  Sections  814,  814.2,  845.4,  and  845.6,  or  in  Title  2.1\n(commencing with Section 3500) of Part 3 of the Penal Code, a public entity is not liable for:\n28 . . .  (2) An injury to any prisoner.”  Cal. Gov’t Code § 844.6.\n23\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220     Filed 09/22/2005     Page 24 of 25(cid:10)\n1 However, the later statute is more specific and does not limit the suits to either of these\n2 classes of defendants.  The Court therefore concludes that immunity on these grounds does\n3 not apply.\n4 Defendants’ similar claim that Sheriff Hennessey is immune from liability under\n5 California Government Code section 820.28 also fails.  That statute opens with the\n6 qualification that it applies “[e]xcept as otherwise provided by statute.”  Cal. Gov’t Code §\n7 820.2.  As before, the more recent authorization of suit in section 4030 falls squarely within\n8 the statutory exception in section 820.2.  Therefore no immunity applies.\n9 C.  State Constitutional Claims\n10 Defendants claim that plaintiffs’ cause of action brought under the California\n11 Constitution’s privacy clause also fail.  Defendants state that in this context the California\nt\nr\nu 12 constitution’s privacy protection should be interpreted consistent with federal interpretations\no\nC\n  13 of Fourth Amendment protection.  See In re York, 9 Cal. 4th 1133, 1149 (1995).  Since the\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 Court has rejected the claim that blanket strip searches of all detainees entering the general\ns D ct of 15 jail population may be strip searched consistent with the Fourth Amendment, the same\nte stri\na Di16 argument must also be rejected here.  Further, defendant has cited no case in which the\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 statutory immunity created by Government Code section 844.6 was interpreted to be an\nUnit or the 18 available defense against a claim brought under the California Constitution’s privacy clause.\nF\n19 D.  Other Defenses\n20 Plaintiffs also moved for summary judgment with regard to several other of plaintiffs’\n21 affirmative defenses: that plaintiffs failed to satisfy claim presentment requirements; that\n22 defendants are immune as public employees engaged in the execution and enforcement of\n23 law under Government Code section 820.4; and that defendants are immune as third parties\n24 under Government Code section 820.8.  Defendants have not opposed these motions and they\n25 are therefore granted.\n26\n27 8The statute states: “Except as otherwise provided by statute, a public employee is not\nliable for an injury resulting from his act or omission where the act or omission was the result\n28 of the exercise of the discretion vested in him, whether or not such discretion be abused.”  Cal.\nGov’t Code § 820.2.\n24\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 220     Filed 09/22/2005     Page 25 of 25(cid:10)\n1 CONCLUSION\n2 For the foregoing reasons, the Court rules as follows:\n3 1.

RELEASORS acknowledge that they intend these consequences even as to \nclaims for personal injury or property damage that may exist as of the date of this Full \nand Final Release but which RELEASORS do not know exist, and which, if known, \nwould materially affect RELEASORS' decision to execute this Full and Final Release, \nregardless of whether RELEASORS' lack of knowledge is the result of ignorance, \noversight, error, negligence, or any other cause. \nRELEASORS acknowledge that, in executing this Full and Final Release, they \nare acting on their own, independent judgment informed by their legal counsel.  \nRELEASORS acknowledge having read this Full and Final Release and having been \nadvised by their attorneys as to its meaning and effect.

      "text": "Case3:03-cv-01840-CRB   Document391-3   Filed03/20/13   Page1 of 2\nNOTICE OF DISMISSAL WITHOUT PREJUDICE OF CLASS ACTION AGAINST THE \nCITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, THE SAN FRANCISCO SHERIFF'S \nDEPARTMENT, SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY SHERIFF MICHAEL HENNESSEY, IN HIS \nINDIVIDUAL AND OFFICIAL CAPACITY, AND SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY \nSHERIFF'S DEPUTIES DOES 1 THROUGH 150. \n \nPLEASE READ THIS COURT-ORDERED CLASS-ACTION NOTICE \nThis is Not A Lawsuit Against You. You Are Not Being Sued \n \n  Were you strip searched at any San Francisco County Jail on or after April 22, 2002 and \non or before January 23, 2004, following your arrest on any charge not involving weapons, \ncontrolled substances, or a charge of violence, and not involving a violation of parole or a \nviolation of probation (where consent to search is a condition of such probation), and/or \nsubjected to a subsequent strip search(es) before arraignment after the initial strip search, \nand/or subjected to a strip search(es) prior to your placement in a 'safety cell.'? \n \n  If any of these things happened to you and you did not already timely choose to be \nexcluded from the class action (opt out) by giving notice of your decision in accordance with \ndirections provided in a prior class notice, specifically, by mailing a letter which had to have \nbeen postmarked on or before January 16, 2005 requesting exclusion from the class, then you \nwere previously included as a plaintiff in a class action to recover damages. \n \n  The class action that you were a part of is now being dismissed in its entirety without \nprejudice.  The statute of limitations on your claims, if any, based on your strip search as \ndescribed above that was tolled—or put on hold—during the pendency of this lawsuit will start \nrunning again and may bar any claims you may wish to pursue unless you bring your own \nindividual lawsuit in a timely manner.  If you wish to pursue any of those claims, you should \nconsult an attorney. \n \nWHAT IS THIS CASE ABOUT?  Eight plaintiffs brought an action in Federal Court against the \nCity and County of San Francisco, the San Francisco Sheriff’s Department, San Francisco \nCounty Sheriff Michael Hennessey and others and alleged that Sheriff’s Deputies, pursuant to \npolicies, customs and practices of the Sheriff’s Department and the Sheriff illegally strip \nsearched individuals arrested on charges not involving weapons, controlled substances, or a \ncharge of violence, and not involving a violation of parole or a violation of probation (where \nconsent to search is a condition of such probation), even when those Deputies lacked the \nindividualized suspicion that such arrestees were carrying contraband that would be discovered \nduring a strip search.  Plaintiffs also alleged that some arrestees were subjected to additional strip \nsearches prior to arraignment even though no individualized suspicion existed that such arrestees \nwere carrying contraband.  Plaintiffs also alleged that all arrestees placed in “safety cells” were \nstrip searched also without individualized suspicion that they possessed contraband.  Plaintiffs \nalleged that these searches violated the rights of the individual plaintiffs and class members \nprotected by the United States Constitution and by California law.  Defendants deny that the strip \nsearches violated the constitutional or statutory rights of the plaintiffs or members of the class.  \nAfter a hearing on June 10, 2004, the Federal District Court issued an order certifying this case \nas a class action.  On February 9, 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit \nruled that San Francisco’s policy of strip searching arrestees at the point in time that they were \nclassified for housing in the general jail population was constitutional.  Bull v. San Francisco, \n595 F.3d 964 (2009).  Thus class members whose only claim was that they were stripped \nsearched once before being introduced into the general jail population do not have any viable \nclaims against San Francisco.  The District Court entered a partial summary judgment in \nSan Francisco’s favor on those claims on September 8, 2010.   \n \n   \n\nCase3:03-cv-01840-CRB   Document391-3   Filed03/20/13   Page2 of 2\nWho is in the Class That Is Being Dismissed Without Prejudice?  Plaintiffs filed this action on \nbehalf of themselves and all other similarly situated individuals.  The Court has certified a class \nconsisting of all persons who were arrested after April 22, 2002 and on or before January 23, \n2004 on any charge not involving weapons, controlled substances, or a charge of violence, and \nnot involving a violation of parole or a violation of probation (where consent to search is a \ncondition of such probation) and who were subjected to a blanket visual body cavity search by \ndefendants before arraignment at a San Francisco County jail facility without any individualized \nreasonable suspicion that they were concealing contraband.  The certified class also includes 1) \nall arrestees who were subjected to subsequent blanket strip search(es) before arraignment after \nthe initial strip search, without any reasonable individualized suspicion that they had \nsubsequently acquired and hidden contraband in their persons, and 2) all persons who, prior to \narraignment, were subjected to a blanket visual body cavity search(es) incident to placement in a \n“safety cell” in any of the San Francisco County Jails.   \n \nAm I in the Class?  You are a member of the class if you were subject to a visual body cavity \nsearch without any individualized reasonable suspicion that you were concealing contraband \nwhile in the custody of the San Francisco County Jail after April 22, 2002 and on or before \nJanuary 23, 2004 following your arrest on any charge not involving weapons, controlled \nsubstances, or violence, and not involving a violation of parole or a violation of probation (where \nconsent to search is a condition of such probation), and/or you were subjected to subsequent \nvisual body cavity search(es) before arraignment after the initial strip search, or subjected to a \nvisual body cavity search prior or incident to placement in a “safety cell.”   \n \nWhat is the Legal Effect of the Dismissal of the Class Without Prejudice: \n \nIf you are in the class and you do nothing, then you will no longer be able to pursue a legal claim \nfor any strip search that occurred at any San Francisco County Jail on or after April 22, 2002 and \non or before January 23, 2004.  If you wish, however, you have the right to hire your own \nattorney and pursue your claim.  Please note that the statute of limitations that was tolled—or put \non hold—during the pendency of this class action lawsuit will start running again and may bar \nany claims you may wish to pursue unless you timely commence your own individual lawsuit.   \n   ",

AUTHORITY TO FILE AND INTERESTS OF AMICUS \nCSSA represents each of the 58 California Sheriffs.  This Association is \ninterested in this case because the issues presented have profound impact on the \nmembers of this Association as well as every jail employee and inmate under the \ncommand of the state's sheriffs. The decision of this Court in this matter will \nprofoundly affect not only Appellants, but also the 57 other Sheriffs' Departments \ntlu'oughout the State of California, which also face varying degrees of drugs or \nweapons smuggling within their jail facilities.  In fact, this Court's decision even \nimpacts other jail facilities not represented by CSSA, such as the multiple \nmunicipal jails that house inmates on an on-going basis. \nThe undersigned serves as legal counsel to CSSA and has been given \nspecific autllOrity to make tlus Application. \nn. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nAmicus accepts the facts as set forth in the Petition, without  restatement. \nIII.  REHEARING EN BANC IS NECESSARY FOR UNIFORMITY OF \nDECISION AND TO SETTLE CRITICAL ISSUES OF LAW. \nA rehearing en banc is appropriate when \"(1) en banc consideration is \nnecessary to secure or maintain unifonnity of the court's decisions; or (2) the \nproceeding involves a question of exceptional importance.\"  Fed. Rules App. \n1 \n\nProced., Rule 35 (a).  In particular, \"a proceeding presents a question of \nexceptional importance if it involves an issue on which the panel decision \nconflicts with the authoritative decisions of other United States Courts of Appeals \nthat have addressed the issue.\"  Fed. Rules App. Proced., Rule 35 (b)(1)(B). \nAs stated in the Petition, there are sufficient and appropriate grounds for \nthis Court to grant rehearing or rehearing en bane.  Appellants have specifically \nnoted that this Court's decision conflicts with United States Supreme Court \nprecedent, Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979), as well as the recent decision of \nanother Comt of Appeal, Powell v. Barrett, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 18907 (11th \nCir. 2008), and it involves critical issues of statewide importance to all Sheriffs. \nA.  Appellants' Strip Search Policy is Necessary, Justified and \nConstitutional. \nThe Court's opinion in this matter omits consideration of a very impOltant \naspect ofthe Sheriffs constitutional obligations.  As the Court in Thompson v. \nCity of Los Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439 (9th Cir. 1989), noted, \"jail officials have a \nconstitutional obligation to provide inmates with adequate medical care and \npersonal safety.\"  Id. at 1447 (citing Wright v. Rushen, 642 F .2d 1129, 1132-33 \n(9th Cir. 1981 )).  The constitutional obligations of Sheriffs are not limited to the \nFourth Amendment constitutional rights of an individual inmate with respect to \n2 \n\nstrip searches, or even the lesser administrative interests of penological efficiency \nand safety in running ajail facility, as to both inmates, employees and \nadministration generally.  An additional constitutional legal obligation exists as to \na Sheriffs having to provide for the health and safety of his or her inmates.  As the \nThompson Cowi found, this obligation is of such paramount importance that \"the \nCounty's interest of diagnosing severe medical problems to prevent transmission \nof serious disease among the general jail population is sufficiently compelling to \npreclude a finding that such searches [in the fmID of blood samples and x-rays] are \nunreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\"  Id.  It is hard to \nimagine that the forced \"extraction of blood\" or \"forced submission to radioactive \nrays,\" which the Thompson Court found to be more intrusive than strip searches in \nceliain respects, is constitutional in order to maintain the health and safety of \ninmates, but strip searches are not. \nThis conclusion is particularly troublesome when tlle specific strip search \npolicy of Appellants and Appellants' specific justification for such policy are \nconsidered.  As noted by Appellants, the strip searches at issue in this matter are \n\"visual only; they involved no touching, occlIn\"ed in private, and were conducted \nby a deputy ofthe same gender as the arrestee.\"  (Pet., at p. 6).  In addition, unlike \nother cases decided previously by this Court on the issue of strip searches, there is \n3 \n\na significant problem with contraband, including dangerous weapons, being \nsmuggled into San Francisco County jails; jail administrators have specifically \ndetermined in their discretion that visual strip searches are an effective tool for \ncombating such smuggling, even among those who were not an·ested in \nconnection with drugs, weapons or violence; and such searches have actually \nresulted in the confiscation of a significant number of contraband items.  (Pet., at \npp. 6-7).  As Appellants aptly point out, the Supreme Court has held that \"'in the \nabsence of substantial evidence in the record to indicate that the officials have \nexaggerated their response to these considerations [prison administration and \nsafeguarding institutional security], cOUlis should ordinarily defer to their expert \njudgment in such matters.'\"  (Pet., at 8 (citing Bell, at 548) (emphasis added)). \nThe constitutional rights of an individual imnate caml0t trump ilie \nconstitutional rights of all imnates to safety and security in the jail setting, when \nthey are put into the general jail population by the govermnent.  If this Court \nrequires all Sheriffs to forego one ofthe only and best tools to discover dangerous \ncontraband being smuggled into the general jail population, the Court is also \nrequiring Sheriffs throughout the State to relinquish ilieir duty to adequately and \nfully satisfy the constitutional obligation to insure the safety of all imnates.  The \npractical reality ofthe Court's decision in this regard is all Sheriffs' Depmiments \n4 \n\nwill be subject to liability for the injury to or death of inmates that will result from \nthe failure to find and deter contraband smuggled into the general jail populations, \nparticularly since such efforts could have been easily thwarted by a reasonable \nvisual strip search policy such as Appellants. \nThis Court must realize that the facts in Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614 \n(9th Cir. 1984), are distinguishable from the set of circumstances faced by \nAppellants.  As the dissent stated, in the opinion in the present matter and in \nconstruing Giles, \"the Idaho county failed to demonstrate that its security interests \njustified the serious invasion of privacy created by its policy.\"  Bull v. City and \n* \nCounty of San Francisco, 539 F.3d 1193,2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 18026,  41 (9th \nCir. 2008) (emphasis added) (citing Bell, at 617).  The dissent further noted that \n'''[t]he record [in Giles] reveals that the incidence of smuggling activity at the \nBonneville County Jail is minimal.'\"  Id. (emphasis added) (quoting Bell, at 617). \nThis is in direct contrast to the detailed and specific evidence submitted by \nAppellants that smuggling of contraband into the jail system in the County of San \nFrancisco is a \"pervasive\" problem.  (Pet., at 9). \nThe Supreme Court's standard of deference set out in Bell, is not a call for \nthis Court to require that jail administrators such as Appellants utilize the least \nrestrictive method of combating the serious health and safety issues facing its \n5 \n\nimnates and guards.  This Court's opinion in this matter essentially analyzes \nAppellants' strip search policy under this type of rubric.  Rather than truly \ndeferring to Appellants' determination of how to address a demonstratably grave \nepidemic, this COUli has required that Appellants show that their policy is in \nresponse to a particular problem associated with the particular class in this matter. \nHowever, the Supreme Court in Bell did not require this and the Eleventh Circuit \nin Powell specifically noted the absence of such a requirement. Powell v. Barrett, \n2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 18907, *20-21 (llth Cir. 2008) (\"[T]he Supreme Court \nwas not ready to concede that lesser alternative analysis has any place in the \nFourth Amendment area.\") (quoting Bell, at 559 n.40 (\"[T]he logic of such \nelaborate less-restrictive-alternative arguments could raise insuperable barriers to \nthe exercise of virtually all search-and-seizure powers.\") (internal quotations and \ncitations omitted) (alteration in original)). \nAs the Powell Court recognized, \"[t]he policy the COUli upheld [in Bell] \nrequired that searches be conducted on every imnate after each contact visit, even \nwithout the slightest cause to suspect that the inmate was concealing contraband.\" \nPowell v. Barrett, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 18907, *20 (llth Cir. 2008) (emphasis \nadded).  This holding permits jail administrators to do what is necessary to satisfy \ntheir constitutional obligation to protect health and safety of all prisoners, as well \n6 \n\nas protecting to rights of inmates to be subject only to reasonable strip searches, \ni.e. those searches that are conducted in a reasonable manner given the particular \ndemonstrated need of the jail facility. \nEven the District Court in Bell had found certain strip searches valid \nwithout any finding of cause to search a particular individual.  The District Court \nfound unconstitutional only those searches of genital and anal areas; \"full body \nvisual strip searches, which did not require the imnates to take any action to more \nfully expose their anal or genital areas to inspection, [were permitted] to continue \nwithout any showing of cause.\"  Id. (citing United States ex rei. Wolfish v. Levi, \n439 F. Supp. 114,48 (S.D.N.Y. 1977); Bell at 558).  And the Second Circuit's \naffinnation of the District Court's decision prohibited, without probable cause, \nonly \"forcing inmates to assume postures or take other actions that would more \nfully expose their anal and genital areas to visual inspection\"; it did not prohibit \nstrip searches entirely, or require reasonable suspicion as to particular individuals. \nIn addition, the justification for the strip searches was but one factor that the \nSupreme Court indicated should be evaluated in detennining the reasonableness of \na policy.  Bell at 559.  The other factors referenced in Bell related to the manner in \nwhich the search was conducted.  All of these factors here weigh in favor of this \nComt finding the strip search policy of Appellants to be reasonable and \n7 \n\nconstitutional under the circumstances.  As noted above, the justification for \nAppellants' policy is based on specific evidence of pervasive smuggling problems. \nMoreover, Bell did not require that the justification be specifically tailored to any \nspecific class of persons or propensity to smuggle contraband.  In addition, the \nsearches are conducted in private and are minimally intrusive. \nIn fact, the Eleventh Circuit's analysis in Powell goes even further and \nwould not seem to require any evidence of particular need, based on Bell.  The \nCourt generally states as follows: \nThe difference between felonies and misdemeanors or other lesser \noffenses is without constitutional significance when it comes to \ndetention facility strip searches. It finds no basis in the Bell decision, \nin the reasoning of that decision, or in the real world of detention \nfacilities. The Supreme Court made no distinction in Bell between \ndetainees based on whether they had been charged with \nmisdemeanors or felonies or even with no crime at all. Instead, the \npolicy that the Court treated categorically, and upheld categorically, \nwas one under which all \"[i]nmates at all Bureau of Prison facilities, \nincluding the MCC, are required to expose their body cavities for \nvisual inspection as a part of a strip search conducted after every \ncontact visit with a person from outside the institution.\" Bell, 441 \nU.S. at 558, 99 S. Ct. at 1884. It was a blanket policy applicable to \nall. \nAmong the \"[i]nmates at all Bureau of Prison facilities, including the \nMCC,\" were detainees facing only lesser charges, people incarcerated \nfor contempt of court, and witnesses in protective custody who had \nnot been accused of doing anything wrong. See id. at 524 & n.3, 558, \n99 S. Ct. at 1866 & n. 3, 1884. \nPowell v. Banett, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 18907, *23-24 (11th Cir. 2008).  The \n8 \n\nfacility at issue in Bell was not \"some special sort of seething cauldron of \ncriminality,\" yet the Supreme Court pennitted strip searches as a reasonable means \nto address the identified penological interests.  Powell, at *33 n.3.  As noted  in the \nPetition and by the Court in Powell, there is a significant risk of contraband \nsmuggling even among those for whom there might not otherwise be reasonable \nsuspicion, particularly due to the influence of gangs.  Powell, at *34-36 (citing, \ne.g. Johannes v. Alameda County Sheriffs Dep't, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63378, \n2006 WL 2504400, at *4-6 (N.D. Cal. 2006); Dodge v. County of Orange, 282 F. \nSupp. 2d 41,46-49 (S.D.N.Y. 2003)). \nGiven the precise holding in Bell and its particular facts, this Court is \nrequested to reconsider its position in this matter, taking into account the opinion \nand rationale in Powell, as well as the specific facts and evidence in this case. \nSpecifically, this Court is respectfully requested to rehear this matter en banc and \nto determine that the strip search policy of Appellants is necessary, reasonable and \nconstitutional.  Appellants cannot be expected to satisfy their constitutional \nobligation to all inmates when this Court has effectively taken away the only and \nmost effective method for maintaining the safety of its jail facilities.  This is a \nmatter of statewide importance and critical to the daily operations of Amicus and \nits members, all of the Sheriffs tlu·oughout the State of California.  This issue is of \n9 \n\nsuch magnitude that it is at least deserving ofthis Court's reconsideration en banc \nas well as this COUlt's specific evaluation of the Eleventh Circuit's recent opinion \non the very same issue as are presented in this matter. \nB.  The SheriffIs Entitled to Qualified Immunity. \nThis COUlt has concluded that it was clearly established in the Ninth Circuit \nthat blanket pre-an-aignment strip searches were unconstitutional.  Bull, 539 F.3d \n* \n1193,2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 18026,  18 (2008).  This COUlt has indicated that its \nprecedent, including the opinions in Giles and Thompson required reasonable \nindividualized suspicion for strip searches to be conducted.  However, this issue \nwas not really settled and, until this Court's cun-ent opinion, was subject to the \ninterpretation of multiple COUlt decisions, involving vastly different types of \nsearches and inmates, as well as varying degrees of evidence to support \npenological policies. \nIn Giles there was no evidence that the strip search perfonned on the imnate \nwas related to any documented security lisle.  In fact the Giles Court indicated that \nthe county had \"not demonstrated that its security interests wan-ant the serious \ninvasion of privacy inflicted by its policy. The record reveals that the incidence of \nsmuggling activity at the Bonneville County Jail is minimal.\"  Giles, at 617 \n(emphasis added).  It was entirely reasonable to interpret this case to stand for the \n10 \n\nproposition that a blanket, per se policy of strip searching might be permissible \nand constitutional where there 'was a demonstratable and serious risk.  In \nparticular, the Giles Court pointed out that only eleven instances of concealment \nhad occurred in an eighteen-month period, with only one of significance, a \nweapon.  Id.  In contrast, Appellants here have demonstrated the significant need \nand the success of such a strip search policy, namely 1,500 items confiscated \nduring more than three-year period.  Indeed, they have even shown the effects of \nnot having such a strip search policy, namely the death of an inmate from an \noverdose.  (Pet. at 5-6). \nIn Thompson, the Comt generally stated that reasonable suspicion of a \nparticular individual was required for strip searches, but also went on to find that \nthe taking of a blood sample and an x-ray, which were found to be more intrusive \nin certain respects than a strip search, were justified solely by \"the County's \ninterest of diagnosing severe medical problems to prevent transmission of serious \ndisease among the general jail population.\"  Thompson, at 1447.  In fact, the \nThompson Court specifically recognized the constitutional obligation of jail \nofficials to provide for the \"personal safety\" of imnates.  Id. (citing Wright v. \nRushen, 642 F.2d 1129, 1132-33 (9th Cir. 1981)).  Therefore, the magnitude of the \npenological interests of a jail facility and the significance of the justification for a \n11 \n\nblanket strip search policy could reasonably be seen as constitutional, since the \nbalance would tip in favor of jail administration and the constitutional rights of all \nimnates to safety and security while in custody. \nBased on these authorities, it cannot be said to be beyond a reasonable \nofficer's belief that he or she can balance the rights of all imnates to safety with \nthe rights of individual imnates in being reasonably searched.  An officer must \nsatisfy both requirements and is not unreasonable in not being able to fully satisfy \nboth where they are clearly conflicting. \nMoreover, Thompson CalIDOt reasonably be said to be support for the \nproposition that individuals held on minor offenses cannot be subject to a blanket \nrule of strip seal'ches; Thompson was not arrested for a minor offense, but grand \ntheft auto, which the Court found to be an offense sufficiently associated with \nviolence to justify reasonable suspicion.  Id. at 1447.  In addition, it is not clear \nwhether the search policy in this matter is of the same type as in Thompson, which \ninvolved a body cavity search.  Id. at 1446 n.5. \nSimilarly, Ward v. County of San Diego, 791 F.2d 1329 (9th Cir. 1986), \ninvolved a strip search, pursuant to a blanket policy, which was done prior to a \ndetennination of the alTestee's eligibility for an own recognizance release and \nwhich involved a body cavity search.  It is not clear that they SaIlle type of policy \n12 \n\nis at issue here and that there would not be a reasonable basis for finding that \ndifferences in policies would justify a different analysis of constitutionality. \nFinally, qualified immunity should normally be afforded where there is any \nreasonable basis for disagreeing about the meaning and scope of precedent, as \nhere.  In Brewster v. Board ofEduc., 149 F.3d 971,977 (9th Cir., 1998), the Ninth \nCircuit pointed out that the \"Supreme Court has made clear that qualified \nimmunity provides a protection to government officers that is quite far-reaching. \nIndeed, it safeguards 'all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly \nviolate the law .... If officers of reasonable competence could disagree on the \nissue whether a chosen course of action is constitutional, immunity should be \nrecognized.'\"  Id. (emphasis added) (quoting Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341 \n(1986); Knox v. Southwest Airlines, 124 F.3d 1103, 1107 (9th Cir. 1997) ('The \ntest allows ample room for reasonable error on the part ofthe [government \nofficial]. ')). \nApplied in the context of the facts and circumstances presented to \nAppellants, there was a reasonable basis for concluding that there was sufficient \njustification for a blanket policy of strip searches, where there may not have been \nin other factual scenarios in prior court opinions.  Brewster, at 977 (qualified \nimmunity defense requires consideration \"not [of] a general constitutional \n13 \n\nguarantee ... but its application in a particular context\") (quoting Todd v.

INTEREST OF AMICI CURIAE \nThe California State Association of Counties (CSAC) is a non-profit \ncorporation.  The membership consists of the 58 California counties.  CSAC \nsponsors a Litigation Coordination Program, which is administered by the County \nCounsels' Association of California and is overseen by the Association's Litigation \nOverview Committee, comprised of county counsels throughout the state.  The \nLitigation Overview Committee monitors litigation of concern to counties \nstatewide and has determined that this case is a matter affecting all counties. \nThe League of California Cities (\"League\") is an association of 480 \nCalifornia cities dedicated to protecting and restoring local control to provide for \nthe public health, safety, and welfare of their residents, and to enhance the quality \nof life for all Californians.  The League is advised by its Legal Advocacy \nCommittee, which is comprised of 24 city attorneys from all regions of the State. \n\nThe Committee monitors litigation of concern to municipalities, and identifies \nthose cases that are of statewide - or nationwide - significance.  The Committee \nhas identified this case as being of such significance. \nThe issue of violence and drug use in this State's jails and prisons is one of \ncritical importance to CSAC and the League.  Local law enforcement is on the \nfront line for dealing with arrestees.  Pretrial detainees begin their process through \nthe criminal justice system in our jails.  Though Amici Curiae are not aware of any \ncomprehensive study involving county jails and other local detention centers, the \nState prison system illustrates the serious problem of inmates obtaining contraband \nwhile incarcerated in the general population.  In the latest data available, covering \n2006, there were 14,490 incidents in our State prisons, which is a rate of9.2 \nincidents per 100 inmates.'  This is the highest incident rate in more than twenty \nyeats.  Of these reported incidents, 1,869 involved assault with a weapon, 1,238 \ninvolved possession of a weapon, and 1,005 involved a controlled substance.  This \naverages to more than 11 incidents per day in our State's prisons involving \ncontraband.  The dangers facing our local jail personnel, as well as our residents \nboth visiting and incarcerated in our jails, is apparent from these facts. \nThe statistics in this paragraph are found in: California Prisoners and \nParolees, California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, p. 34 (2006) \n[available at: \nhttp:www.cdcr.ca.govlReports_ResearchiOffender_Infonnation_  Services_   Branchl \nAnnuallCaIPris/CALPRlSd2006.pdf]. \n\nIII.  Conclusion \nAmici Curiae respectfully move that this Court grant leave to file the Brief \nof Amici Curiae submitted with this motion. \niL, \nDATED:  October  2008 \nRespectfully submitted, \nCALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES, \nand LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES \n, SBN 193915 \nCalifornia State Association of Counties \n\nFmther, the general liability exposure of cities and counties, particularly of \nour various police departments and law enforcement agencies, will be significantly \naffected by this Court's ruling regarding the Fourth Amendment constitutionality \nof blanket strip search policies in detention facilities.  As such, Amici Curiae have \na significant interest in the decision of this Court with regard to a possible en banc \nhearing. \nII.  Amici Curiae's Brief \nAmici Curiae desire to file this brief in order to articulate and clarifY the \nissues and law surrounding this Court's deliberations and the potential burden it \npresents to the law enforcement operations of cities and counties.  Amici's counsel \nis familiar with the briefs filed in this case and has reviewed the Petition for \nRehearing and Rehearing En Banc.  The amicus brief enclosed herewith does \nrepeat these arguments, but instead refers this Court to some cases not otherwise \ncited by the Petitioner and provides the Court with the public policy concerns that \nare of particular interest to CSAC's and the League's member cities and counties.

SAN FRANCISCO 2243\neach year. To address a serious problem of contraband smug-\ngling in the jail system, Sheriff Michael Hennessey instituted\na policy requiring the strip search of all arrestees who were\nto be introduced into San Francisco’s general jail population\nfor custodial housing. In a class action lawsuit challenging\nthis policy on its face, a district court held that it violated the\nFourth Amendment rights of the persons searched, and denied\nSheriff Hennessey qualified immunity. Hennessey, the San\nFrancisco Sheriff’s Department, and the City and County of\nSan Francisco brought this interlocutory appeal, challenging\nthe denial of qualified immunity.1 A divided panel of this\ncourt  affirmed  the  district  court’s  denial,  Bull  v.  City  &\nCounty of San Francisco, 539 F.3d 1193 (9th Cir. 2008), and\nwe granted rehearing en banc. Because we conclude that San\nFrancisco’s  policy  did  not  violate  plaintiffs’  constitutional\nrights, we reverse the district court’s denial of Sheriff Hen-\nnessey’s motion for summary judgment based on qualified\nimmunity,  and  in  doing  so  necessarily  reverse  the  district\ncourt’s grant of plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judg-\nment as to Fourth Amendment liability.\nI\n“A detention facility is a unique place fraught with serious\nsecurity dangers. Smuggling of money, drugs, weapons, and\nother contraband is all too common an occurrence.” Bell v.\nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979). Indeed, “attempts to intro-\nduce drugs and other contraband into [prison] premises . . . is\none of the most perplexing problems of prisons.” Hudson v.\nPalmer, 468 U.S. 517, 527 (1984); see Overton v. Bazzetta,\n539 U.S. 126, 134 (2003) (“Drug smuggling and drug use in\nprison are intractable problems.”); Block v. Rutherford, 468\nU.S. 576, 588-89 (1984) (“We can take judicial notice that the\nunauthorized use of narcotics is a problem that plagues virtu-\n1We refer to Sheriff Hennessey, the Sheriff’s Department, and the City\nand County of San Francisco by name when appropriate, and otherwise\nrefer to defendants collectively as “San Francisco.” \n\n2244 BULL v. SAN FRANCISCO\nally every penal and detention center in the country.”). San\nFrancisco’s six county jails are no exception: They struggle\nwith a serious, ongoing problem of drugs, weapons, and other\ncontraband being smuggled into jail facilities. The record con-\ntains hundreds of pages of incident reports, indicating that\nbetween April 2000 and December 2003, searches of the San\nFrancisco general jail population resulted in the discovery of\n1,574 items of contraband, including 662 assorted controlled\nsubstance pills, 106 shanks and other weapons, 1 screwdriver,\n17 jail-made handcuff keys, 42.88 grams of rock cocaine,\n2.75 grams of powder cocaine, 6.70 grams of methamphet-\namine, 6.24 grams of tar heroine, 71.93 grams of marijuana,\n4 ecstasy pills, 32 assorted pipes, 1 hypodermic needle, and\n24 gallons of homemade alcohol known as “Pruno.” The pres-\nence of such contraband threatens the health and safety of\ninmates, corrections officers, and jail employees. The record\ncontains reports of the death of an inmate housed in the gen-\neral population from drugs obtained within the prison, and of\none detainee who set her clothes on fire with a lighter smug-\ngled into the cell, of another who mutilated himself with sta-\nples  similarly  secreted  into  the  jail,  and  of  a  third  who\nattempted suicide with razor-blades smuggled into the jail in\nhis rectal cavity. The jail administrators have concluded that,\nbased on their experience, “the greatest opportunity for the\nintroduction of drugs and weapons into the jail occurs at the\npoint when an arrestee is received into the jail for booking\nand, thereafter, housing.” In light of this conclusion, Sheriff\nHennessey developed and implemented a “Booking Searches”\npolicy.  This  policy  authorized  officers  to  strip  search  an\narrestee when any one of eleven conditions applied, including\nthe condition at issue here, namely, when “[a] person [was]\nassigned a custody level by Classification and scheduled for\ncustodial housing.” \nPlaintiffs’ facial challenge to the Booking Searches policy\nis the only issue before us in this interlocutory appeal. This is\nan important point, because the dissent draws upon unproven\nallegations to give a shocking and inflammatory account of\n\nBULL v. SAN FRANCISCO 2245\nmistreatment by jail officials, including forcible strip searches\nconducted in an abusive and violent manner. The dissent’s\nsensationalist  account  of  individual  factual  allegations  is\nworse than irrelevant, as it invites us to decide this case on the\nbasis of disputed factual issues not yet presented by the par-\nties,  not  yet  considered  by  the  district  court,  and  not  yet\nweighed by a jury. San Francisco has vigorously denied the\nallegations the dissent recites. Nevertheless, if true, these alle-\ngations are quite serious, even absent the dissent’s embellish-\nments.2  Such  abuses  would  contravene  San  Francisco’s\nwritten policy, which required that searches be conducted in\na “professional manner,” and prohibited officers of the oppo-\nsite sex to be present. If these allegations were found to be\ntrue, the victims of those abuses would have strong claims\nagainst San Francisco. \nBut the plaintiffs are not making such claims. Plaintiffs\nemphasized throughout their briefing that they “brought this\naction to challenge the blanket policy and practice of search-\ning prearraignment arrestees . . . ,” not the individual cases.\nThus,  plaintiffs  relied  “almost  exclusively  on  defendants’\ndepositions and written policies as the basis of the material\nfacts” in order to avoid disputed issues of fact that would\ndefeat summary judgment. \nFor purposes of this narrow appeal, we are called upon to\nassess the constitutionality of the policy itself, not violations\nof that policy; thus, as did the district court, we must assume\nthe challenged policy was followed scrupulously. \nAlthough the dissent’s dramatic accounts stir the emotions,\nthey  are  misleading  and  ultimately  irrelevant  to  the  case\nbefore us. Not a single one of the long parade of victims\ndescribed by the dissent—Mary Bull, Charli Johnson, Bernie\n2There is no doubt, as the Court stated in Bell, that “on occasion a secur-\nity guard may conduct the search in an abusive fashion,” and “[s]uch an\nabuse cannot be condoned.” 441 U.S. at 560. \n\n2246 BULL v. SAN FRANCISCO\nGalvin, Michael Marron, Laura Timbrook, Salome Mangos-\ning, Leigh Fleming, Michelle De Ranleau, or Deborah Flick\n—have claims at issue in this appeal.3 Rather than highlight\nthe dramatic individual anecdotes that can be mined from the\nrecord, we limit our discussion to the issue actually before us:\nplaintiffs’ challenge to the jail’s written strip-search policy.\nWe leave other, factual questions to be addressed by the dis-\ntrict court in the first instance.\nA\nDuring the period at issue, new arrestees entering the San\nFrancisco County jail system were transported to County Jail\nNo. 9, a temporary intake and release facility, where they\nwere pat-searched, scanned with a metal detector, booked into\nthe system, and fingerprinted. The arrestees were then placed\nin holding cells. Those eligible to post bail were given access\nto a telephone and afforded up to 12 hours to secure their\nrelease on bond. Individuals arrested because of intoxication\nwere released when they became sober. Arrestees who were\nstatutorily eligible were cited and released. See Cal. Penal\n3The claims of each of these individuals have been judicially resolved\nin some manner, and are not on appeal here. For example, the district court\nrecognized that “substantial evidence in the record” supported a finding\nthat “reasonable suspicion existed to strip search” Bull and Mangosing,\nand thus denied summary judgment to them on their individual claims.\nPlaintiffs conceded that all of Johnson’s claims were time-barred, and did\nnot oppose summary judgment in San Francisco’s favor. San Francisco\ndid not oppose summary judgment in favor of Timbrook. The district court\ngranted summary judgment in favor of Sheriff Hennessey on the claims\nof Fleming and Flick, who were searched, like Bull and Mangosing, only\npursuant to the “safety cell” policy. Under this policy, inmates or arrestees\n“were subjected to blanket visual body cavity search(es) incident to place-\nment in a ‘safety cell’ at any of the San Francisco County jails.” The dis-\ntrict  court  held  that  Sheriff  Hennessey  had  qualified  immunity  from\nchallenges to that policy. Galvin, Marron, and De Ranleau are not even\nplaintiffs in this action, and, accordingly, are never mentioned in plain-\ntiffs’  summary-judgment  papers;  they  appear  in  a  proposed  Second\nAmended Complaint, which was rejected by the district court. \n\nBULL v. SAN FRANCISCO 2247\nCode  § 853.6.  None  of  these  arrestees  was  strip  searched\nunder the challenged policy.\nBecause County Jail No. 9 is a temporary intake facility\nequipped with holding cells but no beds, those arrestees not\neligible for release were transported to a jail with housing\nfacilities. Arrestees were then transferred into the facility’s\ngeneral jail population, which included pretrial detainees and\nconvicted inmates. Pursuant to the Booking Searches policy,\nthese individuals were strip searched prior to admission into\nthe general population in order to prevent the smuggling of\ncontraband into the facilities.\nUnder the policy, a strip search was to be performed “in a\nprofessional manner in an area of privacy” by an officer of the\nsame  sex  as  the  arrestee.  The  arrestee  was  required  “to\nremove or arrange some or all of his or her clothing so as to\npermit a visual inspection of the underclothing, breasts, but-\ntocks or genitalia of such person.” The search included “a\nvisual inspection of the mouth, ears, hair, hands, skin folds,\n[and] armpits as well as a thorough search of all clothing\nitems.” San Francisco Sheriff’s Dep’t Proc. No. E-03, E-03(III).4\n4The written policy instructions for conducting strip searches stated: \n1.  Strip searches include a visual body cavity search. A strip\nsearch does not include a physical body cavity search. \n2.  The search will be conducted in a professional manner in an\narea of privacy so that the search cannot be observed by per-\nsons not participating in the search. \n3.  The searching officer will instruct the arrestee to: \na.  Remove his/her clothing. \nb.  Raise  his/her  arms  above  their  head  and  rotate  360\ndegrees. \nc.  To bend forward and run his/her hands through his/her\nhair. \nd.  To turn his/her head first to the left and then to the right\nso the searching officer can inspect the arrestee’s ear ori-\nfices. \n\n2248 BULL v. SAN FRANCISCO\nThe policy authorized a visual search only; officers were not\nallowed to physically touch inmates’ body cavities.\nStrip searches conducted under the Booking Searches pol-\nicy uncovered significant amounts of contraband hidden in\nand on arrestees’ bodies. For example, as noted by the district\ncourt, San Francisco “produced evidence that from April 2000\nthrough  April  2005  strip  searches  at  County  Jail  No.  9\nresulted in the discovery of 73 cases of illegal drugs or drug\nparaphernalia hidden in body cavities.” Contraband discov-\nered  in  arrestees’  body  cavities  included  handcuff  keys,\nsyringes, crack pipes, heroin, crack-cocaine, rock cocaine, and\nmarijuana. In the same time period, strip searches uncovered\nvarious concealed weapons, including a seven-inch folding\nknife, a double-bladed folding knife, a pair of 8-inch scissors,\na jackknife, a double-edged dagger, a nail, and glass shards.\nJail officials found contraband on arrestees charged with a\nrange of offenses, including non-violent offenses such as pub-\nlic  drunkenness,  public  nuisance,  and  violation  of  a  court\norder. For example, a man arrested on a warrant for public\nnuisance  was  found  smuggling  a  plastic  bag  of  suspected\ncocaine powder. The parties dispute whether any discovery of\ncontraband can be conclusively tied to class members, but, as\ne.  To open his/her mouth and run his/her finger over the\nupper and lower gum areas; then raise his/her tongue so\nthe  officer  can  inspect  the  interior  of  the  arrestee’s\nmouth. Remove dentures if applicable. \nf.  To turn around and raise first one foot, then the other so\nthe officer can check the bottom of each foot. \n4.  The  searching  officer  will  visually  inspect  the  arrestee’s\nbreasts, buttocks, and genitalia. \n5.  The searching officer will thoroughly search the arrestee’s\nclothing, underclothing, shoes, and socks. \n6.  At the completion of the search, the searching officer will\ninstruct the arrestee to dress. \n\nBULL v. SAN FRANCISCO 2249\ndiscussed below, a resolution of this dispute is not material to\nour holding today.\nB\nIn April 2003, Mary Bull and a class of similarly situated\nplaintiffs  filed  a  class  action  complaint  under  42  U.S.C.\n§ 1983 in district court against the City and County of San\nFrancisco, the Sheriff’s Department, Sheriff Hennessey in his\nindividual and official capacities, and certain unnamed Sher-\niff’s  deputies.  Plaintiffs  alleged  that  San  Francisco’s  strip\nsearch policy violated their Fourth Amendment right to be\nfree from unreasonable searches and their Fourteenth Amend-\nment rights to due process and privacy.5 \nIn an order issued June 10, 2004, the district court granted\nplaintiffs’ motion to certify a class under Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 23(b)(3) and defined the class as including all\npersons  who  “were  arrested  on  any  charge  not  involving\nweapons, controlled substances, or a charge of violence, and\nnot involving a violation of parole or a violation of probation\n(where consent to search is a condition of such probation),\nand who were subjected to a blanket visual body cavity strip\nsearch by defendants before arraignment at a San Francisco\nCounty jail facility without any individualized reasonable sus-\npicion that they were concealing contraband.”6 \nIn June 2005, plaintiffs moved for partial summary judg-\nment on their claims that San Francisco’s former strip search\npolicy was facially unconstitutional with respect to members\n5Plaintiffs also alleged violations of certain provisions of California law\nthat are not at issue in this appeal. \n6The class also included arrestees who “were subjected to blanket visual\nbody cavity search(es) incident to placement in a ‘safety cell’ at any of the\nSan Francisco County jails.” The validity of the “safety-cell search” policy\nis not at issue in this appeal. Indeed, as noted supra, the district court held\nthat Sheriff Hennessey had qualified immunity from challenges to that\npolicy. \n\n2250 BULL v. SAN FRANCISCO\nof the class in eight different categories, including arrestees\nclassified for housing in the general jail population. Sheriff\nHennessey also moved for partial summary judgment, arguing\nthat he was entitled to qualified immunity with respect to the\nclaim that the strip search policy applicable to persons classi-\nfied for housing was unconstitutional.\nOn September 22, 2005, the district court issued an order\ndisposing  of  the  summary  judgment  motions,  but  subse-\nquently granted San Francisco’s motion for reconsideration.\nOn February 23, 2006, the district court issued an unpublished\namended  order,  granting  in  part  and  denying  in  part  each\nparty’s motions. Bull v. City & County of San Francisco, No.\nC 03-01840, 2006 WL 449148 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 23, 2006).\nThis order is the subject of our review.7\nThe district court granted plaintiffs’ motion for partial sum-\nmary judgment with respect to the policy of strip searching\nclass members classified for housing, holding that the policy\nviolated those individuals’ Fourth Amendment rights. Id. at\n*6. On this issue, the court determined that San Francisco’s\nblanket strip search policy ran afoul of our cases holding that\nsuch a search can be conducted only if there is individualized\nreasonable suspicion that a particular arrestee is concealing\ncontraband, even if the arrestee will be introduced into the\ngeneral population of a detention facility. Id.; see Thompson\n7Specifically, on October 21, 2005, San Francisco moved for reconsid-\neration of portions of the district court’s September 22, 2005 order that\nwere unrelated to the court’s denial of qualified immunity for Sheriff Hen-\nnessey. San Francisco simultaneously appealed the denial of qualified\nimmunity to this court, and the appeal was assigned Docket No. 05-17080.\nOn February 23, 2006, the district court issued its amended order. San\nFrancisco again appealed the denial of qualified immunity to this court.\nThis second appeal was assigned Docket No. 06-15566. On April 26,\n2006, this court issued an order consolidating appeal Nos. 05-17080 and\n06-15566. Because the district court ruled that the February 23, 2006 order\nsuperseded its September 22, 2005 order, we dismiss appeal No. 05-17080\nas moot. \n\nBULL v. SAN FRANCISCO 2251\nv. City of Los Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439, 1446 (9th Cir. 1989);\nGiles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 615 (9th Cir. 1984) (per\ncuriam), overruled on other grounds by Hodgers-Durgin v. de\nla Vina, 199 F.3d 1037, 1040 n.1 (9th Cir. 1999) (en banc).\nAccordingly, with regards to that policy, the district court\ndenied Sheriff Hennessey’s motion for summary judgment on\nthe ground of qualified immunity. Bull, 2006 WL 449148, at\n*16. The court stated that “[i]t was . . . abundantly clear after\nThompson that placement in the general jail population ‘by\nitself cannot justify a strip search.’ ” Id. (quoting Thompson,\n885 F.2d at 1447).8 Sheriff Hennessey appealed, raising the\nsingle issue of this qualified-immunity ruling. \nII\n“We review de novo the district court’s decision regarding\nqualified immunity.” Motley v. Parks, 383 F.3d 1058, 1062\n(9th Cir. 2004). “Qualified immunity is ‘an entitlement not to\nstand trial or face the other burdens of litigation.’ ” Saucier v.\nKatz, 533 U.S. 194, 200 (2001) (quoting Mitchell v. Forsyth,\n472 U.S. 511, 526 (1985), overruled on other grounds by\nPearson v. Callahan, 129 S. Ct. 808, 818 (2009)). In applying\nthe two-part qualified immunity analysis, “[w]e must deter-\nmine whether, taken in the light most favorable to [Plaintiffs],\nDefendants’ conduct amounted to a constitutional violation,\nand . . . we must determine whether or not the right was\nclearly established at the time of the violation.” McSherry v.\nCity of Long Beach, 560 F.3d 1125, 1129-30 (9th Cir. 2009).\nIt is within our “sound discretion [to] decid[e] which of the\ntwo  prongs  of  the  qualified  immunity  analysis  should  be\naddressed first in light of the circumstances in the particular\ncase at hand.” Pearson, 129 S. Ct. at 818. \n8The court made several other rulings on the parties’ cross motions for\nsummary judgment that are not at issue here. \n\n2252 BULL v. SAN FRANCISCO\nUnder the circumstances of this case, we also have jurisdic-\ntion to review the district court’s grant of partial summary\njudgment to plaintiffs on the issue of Fourth Amendment lia-\nbility, because the district court’s holding on liability is “inex-\ntricably intertwined with,” as well as “dependent on both the\nreasoning and results of,” its decision to deny qualified immu-\nnity to Sheriff Hennessey. Marks v. Clarke, 102 F.3d 1012,\n1018 (9th Cir. 1996).\nIII\n[1] The reasonableness of a search is determined by refer-\nence to its context. Michenfelder v. Sumner, 860 F.2d 328,\n332 (9th Cir. 1988). The search policy before us applied to\narrestees transferred out of holding cells and introduced into\nthe general jail population for custodial housing. According to\nSan Francisco’s unrebutted testimony, the purpose of the strip\nsearch policy was to prevent the smuggling of drugs, weap-\nons, and other contraband into the general jail population.\nBecause the purpose of the search policy at issue was to fur-\nther institutional security goals within a detention facility, the\nprinciples articulated in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979),\nand Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987), govern our analysis.\nCases that address searches of arrestees at the place of arrest,\nsearches at the stationhouse prior to booking or placement in\na holding cell, or searches pursuant to an evidentiary criminal\ninvestigation do not control our review, because housing in\nthe general jail population and the issues attendant to effective\ndetention facility administration are not factors in those cases.\nAccordingly, we begin our analysis of San Francisco’s strip\nsearch policy by reviewing the principles established in Bell\nand Turner.\nA\nIn Bell, the Supreme Court upheld a policy of conducting\nvisual body cavity searches of individuals housed at Metro-\npolitan  Correctional  Center  (MCC),  a  federally  operated\n\nBULL v. SAN FRANCISCO 2253\nshort-term custodial facility in New York, against Fourth and\nFifth  Amendment  challenges.  MCC  housed  convicted\ninmates, pretrial detainees, witnesses in protective custody,\nand persons incarcerated for contempt of court. Bell, 441 U.S.\nat 524. The plaintiff class, consisting of all persons housed at\nMCC, challenged a number of different “restrictions and prac-\ntices that were designed to promote security and order at the\nfacility on the ground that these restrictions violated the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and certain other\nconstitutional  guarantees,  such  as  the  First  and  Fourth\nAmendments.”  Id.  at  544.  One  of  these  practices  was  the\nrequirement  that  detainees  undergo  a  visual  body  cavity\ninspection as part of a strip search “after every contact visit\nwith a person from outside the institution.” Id. at 558. As in\nthis case, the plaintiffs argued the search policy violated their\nFourth  Amendment  right  to  be  free  from  unreasonable\nsearches.\nBefore addressing the merits, the Court reviewed several\ngeneral principles that informed its analysis, and which bear\nrepeating. First, the Court reaffirmed that prisoners “do not\nforfeit all constitutional protections” by virtue of incarcera-\ntion, and stated that pretrial detainees “retain at least those\nconstitutional rights that [the Court] ha[s] held are enjoyed by\nconvicted prisoners.” Id. at 545. Second, the Court empha-\nsized that the retained constitutional rights of prisoners and\ndetainees  alike  were  subject  to  restrictions  and  limitations\nbased on “institutional needs and objectives,” explaining that\n“[t]he fact of confinement as well as the legitimate goals and\npolicies of the penal institution limits these retained constitu-\ntional rights.” Id. at 546. Third, the Court explained that a\ncentral justification for this permissible restriction of constitu-\ntional rights is a detention facility’s need to accomplish the\n“essential  goals”  of  “maintaining  institutional  security  and\npreserving  internal  order  and  discipline.”  Id.  Because\n“[p]rison officials must be free to take appropriate action to\nensure the safety of inmates and corrections personnel,” even\nthose restrictions that infringe upon “a specific constitutional\n\n2254 BULL v. SAN FRANCISCO\nguarantee”  must  be  “evaluated  in  the  light  of  the  central\nobjective of prison administration, safeguarding institutional\nsecurity.”  Id.  at  547  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).\nFinally, the Court directed lower courts to accord corrections\nofficials “wide-ranging deference in the adoption and execu-\ntion of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed\nto preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain insti-\ntutional security.” Id. (citing Jones v. N.C. Prisoners’ Labor\nUnion, Inc., 433 U.S. 119, 128 (1977); Procunier v. Martinez,\n416 U.S. 396, 404-05 (1974), overruled on other grounds by\nThornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401, 413-14 (1989); Cruz v.\nBeto, 405 U.S. 319, 321 (1972) (per curiam); Meachum v.\nFano, 427 U.S. 215, 228-29 (1976)). \nThe Court specifically rejected the argument that deference\nto corrections facility officials is necessary only when the per-\nsons being housed have been convicted of a crime. Id. at 547\nn.29. The Court explained that “the principle of deference” to\nofficials’ discretion in running corrections institutions is not\ndependent on the “happenstance” of whether the inmates are\npretrial detainees or convicted prisoners. Id. Rather, courts\nowe corrections officials deference on the grounds that “the\nrealities of running a corrections institution are complex and\ndifficult, courts are ill equipped to deal with these problems,\nand  the  management  of  these  facilities  is  confided  to  the\nExecutive  and  Legislative  Branches,  not  to  the  Judicial\nBranch.” Id.; see id. at 547-48. \nTurning to the merits, the Court assumed, without deciding,\nthat detainees and inmates “retain some Fourth Amendment\nrights upon commitment to a corrections facility” and noted\nthat “[t]he Fourth Amendment prohibits only unreasonable\nsearches.” Id. at 558. The “test of reasonableness . . . requires\na balancing of the need for the particular search against the\ninvasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must\nconsider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in\nwhich it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the\nplace in which it is conducted.” Id. at 559.\n\nBULL v. SAN FRANCISCO 2255\nThe  Court  acknowledged  that  the  scope  of  the  strip\nsearches at MCC was invasive: “If the inmate is a male, he\nmust lift his genitals and bend over to spread his buttocks for\nvisual  inspection.  The  vaginal  and  anal  cavities  of  female\ninmates also are visually inspected.” Id. at 558 n.39. Indeed,\nthe circuit court in Bell had invalidated the body cavity search\npolicy, concluding that the “ ‘gross violation of personal pri-\nvacy inherent in such a search cannot be outweighed by the\ngovernment’s security interest in maintaining a practice of so\nlittle actual utility.’ ” Id. at 558 (quoting Wolfish v. Levi, 573\nF.2d 118, 131 (2d Cir. 1978)). \nThe Court rejected this reasoning, however, and held that\nthe strip search policy at MCC was reasonable given the insti-\ntutional needs and objectives, particularly the security con-\ncerns,  of  the  corrections  facility.  The  Court  noted  that\n“[c]orrections  officials  testified  that  visual  cavity  searches\nwere  necessary  not  only  to  discover  but  also  to  deter  the\nsmuggling of weapons, drugs, and other contraband into the\ninstitution.”  Id.  Recognizing  that  a  “detention  facility  is  a\nunique place fraught with serious security dangers,” and that\n“[s]muggling of money, drugs, weapons, and other contra-\nband is all too common an occurrence,” the Court upheld the\npolicy even though there had been no long or pervasive his-\ntory of smuggling at MCC, nor had corrections officials pre-\nsented substantial evidence that persons who participated in\ncontact visits were sources of contraband. Id. at 559. Indeed,\nalthough officials could show only one instance in which con-\ntraband was found during a body cavity inspection, the Court\nfound it sufficient that “attempts to secrete these items into\nthe facility by concealing them in body cavities are docu-\nmented in this record and in other cases.” Id. (citing cases).\nWhile  recognizing  that  the  institution  might  have  adopted\nalternatives less intrusive than a blanket policy of performing\nstrip searches, the Court nevertheless deferred to MCC offi-\ncials, explaining that the officials’ decision to adopt the strip\nsearch  procedure  “has  not  been  shown  to  be  irrational  or\nunreasonable.” Id. at 559 n.40. Accordingly, the Court con-\n\n2256 BULL v. SAN FRANCISCO\ncluded the strip search at issue did not violate the detainees’\nFourth Amendment rights. Id. at 560.\nAlthough Bell continues to provide definitive guidance for\nanalyzing detention-facility strip searches under the Fourth\nAmendment, Turner v. Safley is also relevant to our analysis.\nWhen reviewing a detention facility’s restrictions of constitu-\ntional rights that are inconsistent with incarceration, Turner\ndirects courts to consider whether the challenged restriction\nwas “reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.”\n482 U.S. at 89. By considering the reasonableness of a search\npolicy in a detention facility context, we must consider the\nexistence of a “valid, rational connection between the prison\nregulation and the legitimate governmental interest put for-\nward to justify it”; “the impact accommodation of the asserted\nconstitutional right will have on guards and other inmates, and\non  the  allocation  of  prison  resources  generally”;  and  “the\nexistence of obvious, easy alternatives” as evidence that the\nregulation “is an ‘exaggerated response’ to prison concerns.”\nId. at 89-91.9 With respect to these factors, the Court reiter-\nated the need to defer to “the informed discretion of correc-\ntions officials.” Id. at 90.\nWe break no new ground in applying Turner and Bell in\nthis context. See Thompson v. Souza, 111 F.3d 694, 699-700\n(9th  Cir.  1997)  (applying  Turner  and  Bell  to  a  prisoner’s\nFourth Amendment claim related to visual body cavity and\nstrip searches); Michenfelder, 860 F.2d at 332-33 (same); see\nalso, e.g., Pierce v. County of Orange, 526 F.3d 1190, 1209\n(9th Cir. 2008) (applying Turner to pretrial detainees’ claims),\ncert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 597 (2008); Frost v. Agnos, 152 F.3d\n1124, 1130 (9th Cir. 1998) (same).10 Indeed, Turner applies\n9The second Turner factor, “whether there are alternative means of\nexercising the right that remain open to prison inmates,” 482 U.S. at 90,\nis not applicable to the search policy, because the right to be free from\nunreasonable searches is not a right susceptible to exercise by alternative\nmeans. See Michenfelder, 860 F.2d at 331 n.1. \n10The dissent attempts to distinguish Thompson and Michenfelder on the\nground that they involved “claims brought by prisoners already serving\n\nBULL v. SAN FRANCISCO 2257\n“to  rights  that  are  inconsistent  with  proper  incarceration,”\nJohnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499, 510 (2005) (internal\nquotation marks omitted), and Bell made clear that the Fourth\nAmendment rights of incarcerated persons are subject to “lim-\nitation or retraction” in order to maintain institutional secur-\nity, 441 U.S. at 546; see also Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S.\n210, 224 (1990) (explaining that Turner “made quite clear\nthat the standard of review we adopted . . . applies to all cir-\ncumstances in which the needs of prison administration impli-\ncate constitutional rights”).11\nsentences,” and thus “involve[d] legitimate penological interests,” while\nsuch “penological interests” do not apply to pre-trial detainees. This dis-\ntinction  is  unavailing.  We  have  never  distinguished  between  pretrial\ndetainees and prisoners in applying the Turner test, but have identified the\ninterests of correction facility officials responsible for pretrial detainees as\nbeing “penological” in nature. See, e.g., Simmons v. Sacramento County\nSuperior Court, 318 F.3d 1156, 1161 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that a sher-\niff’s refusal to transport a pretrial detainee from jail to court for a personal\ninjury trial “serves a legitimate penological interest” in that it “goes to the\nvery heart of that interest—to keep detainees detained unless absolutely\nnecessary.”); Valdez v. Rosenbaum, 302 F.3d 1039, 1048 (9th Cir. 2002)\n(holding that restrictions on telephone access in a state jail does not violate\na pretrial detainee’s constitutional rights if “it is reasonably related to\nlegitimate penological interests.”). While penological interests in punish-\nment or rehabilitation may not be applicable outside of a prison setting,\nthe penological interest in security and safety is applicable in all correction\nfacilities. Indeed, Bell declined to “distinguish[ ] between pretrial detain-\nees and convicted inmates in reviewing the challenged security practices,”\nnoting that “[t]here is no basis for concluding that pretrial detainees pose\nany lesser security risk than convicted inmates. Indeed, it may be that in\ncertain circumstances they present a greater risk to jail security and order.”\nBell, 441 U.S. at 547 n.28. \n11The dissent argues that we should not apply the Turner standard,\nbecause “Bell directly controls here.”  While we agree that Bell is directly\napplicable to pretrial detainees, Bell is consistent with Turner, see Turner,\n482 U.S. at 87-90; Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 410 n.9 (pointing out that Tur-\nner “expressly relied” on Bell “when it announced the reasonableness\nstandard for ‘inmates’ constitutional rights’ cases”), and thus there is no\nreason to depart from our prior cases holding that Turner is applicable in\nthis context. \n\n2258 BULL v. SAN FRANCISCO\nB\n[2] Turning to the San Francisco strip search policy, we\nbegin by applying Bell’s general principles. Bell held that a\nmandatory, routine strip search policy applied to prisoners\n“after every contact visit with a person from outside the insti-\ntution,” without individualized suspicion, was facially consti-\ntutional.  The  dissent’s  characterization  of  the  case  to  the\ncontrary is counterfactual. See Bell, 441 U.S. at 558. In reach-\ning this conclusion Bell assumed, without deciding, that incar-\ncerated persons retain some Fourth Amendment rights. We\nhave gone further, and recognized that the Fourth Amendment\ndoes apply to the invasion of bodily privacy in prisons. See,\ne.g., Michenfelder, 860 F.2d at 332. Because San Francisco’s\npolicy applied to arrestees introduced into the general jail\npopulation for custodial housing, we are required to evaluate\nthe plaintiffs’ constitutional claims “in the light of the central\nobjective of prison administration, safeguarding institutional\nsecurity.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 547. The principle that confine-\nment “brings about the necessary withdrawal or limitation of\nmany privileges and rights . . . applies equally to pretrial\ndetainees and prisoners.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 545-46 (internal\nquotation  marks  omitted);  see  also  United  States  v.  Van\nPoyck, 77 F.3d 285, 291 & n.10 (9th Cir. 1996). Finally, even\nif we “disagree[ ] with the judgment of [corrections] officials\nabout  the  extent  of  the  security  interests  affected  and  the\nmeans required to further those interests,” Bell, 441 U.S. at\n554, we may not engage in “an impermissible substitution of\n[our] view on the proper administration of [a corrections facil-\nity] for that of the experienced administrators of that facility.”\nBlock, 468 U.S. at 589.\n[3] Applying the principles reviewed above, it is apparent\nthat the scope, manner, and justification for San Francisco’s\nstrip search policy was not meaningfully different from the\nscope, manner, and justification for the strip search policy in\nBell.12 Similar to the challenged policy in Bell, the San Fran-\n12Bell did not analyze the place in which the strip searches occurred, but\nas explained below, the San Francisco policy’s requirement that officers\n\nBULL v. SAN FRANCISCO 2259\ncisco strip search procedures governing the scope and manner\nof the searches, as detailed in the Sheriff’s Booking Searches\npolicy, limited the searches to visual inspection and expressly\nprohibited tactile strip searches. See 441 U.S. at 558 n.39,\n560. Moreover, the San Francisco procedures required offi-\ncials to conduct strip searches in a professional manner and in\na place that afforded privacy. Furthermore, the circumstances\njustifying the San Francisco strip search policy are weightier\nin this case than they were in Bell. The record reveals a perva-\nsive and serious problem with contraband inside San Francis-\nco’s jails, as well as numerous instances in which contraband\nwas found during a search, indicating that arrestees’ use of\nbody cavities as a method of smuggling drugs, weapons, and\nitems used to escape custody is an immediate and troubling\nproblem for San Francisco jail administrators. The record of\nsmuggling in this case far exceeds the showing in Bell, where\ndefendants “proved only one instance in the MCC’s short his-\ntory  where  contraband  was  found  during  a  body-cavity\nsearch.” Id. at 558.\n[4] In sum, because the circumstances before us are not\nmeaningfully distinguishable from those presented in Bell, the\nbalance between the need for the San Francisco strip search\npolicy and “the invasion of personal rights that the search\nentails” must be resolved in favor of the jail system’s institu-\ntional concerns. Id. at 559. While strip searches are invasive\nand embarrassing, and while this type of security measure “in-\nstinctively gives us the most pause,” id. at 558, we must con-\nclude that under Bell, San Francisco’s strip search policy was\nreasonable and therefore did not violate the class members’\nFourth Amendment rights.\n[5] Because the Turner factors require us to give more def-\nerence to detention officials’ determinations than does the bal-\nconduct strip searches in a private place supports a conclusion that the pol-\nicy was reasonable. \n\n2260 BULL v. SAN FRANCISCO\nancing test in Bell, it is not surprising that our consideration\nof the Turner factors leads to the same conclusion. San Fran-\ncisco presented a well-documented record of the contraband\nproblem in its jails, of individuals attempting to smuggle con-\ntraband into the jails via body cavities, and of the health and\nsafety issues such smuggling raised. The record includes a jail\nadministrator’s testimony that “it is of utmost importance in\nthe operation of a jail system to prevent the introduction of\ndrugs, weapons, and other contraband” and that “[t]he safety\nand well being of all inmates, staff and the public demands no\nless.” Further, Sheriff Hennessey testified that, in creating jail\npolicies, he considers “the needs of institutional security and\nsafety of staff, inmates, and visitors[,] . . . the privacy and dig-\nnity of inmates[,] . . . [and] the cost and practicality of jail\npolicies.”  Finally,  the  record  includes  testimony  that  “the\ngreatest opportunity for the introduction of drugs and weap-\nons  into  the  jail  occurs  at  the  point  when  an  arrestee  is\nreceived into the jail for booking and, thereafter, housing,”\nand that detainees “are searched before they are transferred to\nthe general jail population in order to prevent the introduction\nof  drugs,  weapons  or  other  contraband  into  the  jails  and\nthereby to protect inmates and staff.” In light of this evidence,\nwe  must  conclude  there  was  a  “valid,  rational  connection\nbetween the prison regulation and the legitimate governmen-\ntal interest put forward to justify it.” Turner, 482 U.S. at 89\n(internal quotation marks omitted); see Beard v. Banks, 548\nU.S. 521, 531 (2006) (holding that detention facility superin-\ntendent’s  testimony  articulating  identified  problem  and  his\nviews on how challenged policy addressed them was suffi-\ncient to show “that the regulations do, in fact, serve the func-\ntion identified”).\n[6] With respect to Turner’s concern for prison resources,\nSan Francisco produced undisputed evidence that the elimina-\ntion of the strip search policy would “lead to a higher inci-\ndence  of  illegal  contraband  in  the  jails,”  and  that\nimplementation of more targeted policies “requires supervi-\nsory and line staff training” that “takes time away from other\n\nBULL v. SAN FRANCISCO 2261\ntasks and necessarily uses resources in scarce supply.” When\nthe allocation of resources and the ability of administrators to\nprotect staff and detainees at the facility are at issue, “courts\nshould be particularly deferential to the informed discretion of\ncorrections  officials.”  Turner,  482  U.S.  at  90.13  Moreover,\nbecause Bell determined that a strip search policy is reason-\nable in a facility with only a single confirmed smuggling inci-\ndent, 441 U.S. at 559, we cannot say that plaintiffs have met\ntheir burden of showing that San Francisco’s strip search pol-\nicy was “an exaggerated response to prison concerns,“ Tur-\nner,  482  U.S.  at  90  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).\nFurthermore, eligible arrestees who were released following\ncitation, upon reaching sobriety, or after posting bond were\nnot subject to strip searches, and San Francisco gave arrestees\na reasonable time in which to post bond. Finally, in light of\nthe documented evidence of the ongoing, dangerous, and per-\nplexing contraband-smuggling problem, and given the defer-\nence  we  owe  to  jail  officials’  professional  judgment,  we\ncannot conclude that there are “obvious, easy alternatives” to\npreventing contraband from entering the jails. Turner, 482\n13The dissent claims San Francisco instituted its policy merely because\nit would require more time to train its officers and because “it is admin-\nistratively inconvenient to comply with the Constitution.” It cites Fron-\ntiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 690 (1973), for the proposition that\n“mere bureaucratic discomfort does not justify constitutional violations.”\nFrontiero is not on point. In Frontiero, the Court struck down a statute\nthat discriminated on the basis of gender and held that the government’s\njustification for the statute, that it would be “cheaper and easier” to dis-\ncriminate, did not pass strict scrutiny review. Frontiero, 411 U.S. at 691.\nIn the corrections facility context, by contrast, the Supreme Court requires\ncourts to inquire into “the impact accommodation of the asserted constitu-\ntional right will have on . . . the allocation of prison resources generally”\nin order to determine whether there is a “ ‘valid, rational connection’\nbetween the prison regulation and the legitimate governmental interest put\nforward to justify it.” Turner, 482 U.S. at 89-90. San Francisco’s state-\nments regarding the effect that the implementation of a targeted strip\nsearch policy would have on jail resources is relevant to this inquiry, and\nthe dissent’s claim that such statements represent San Francisco’s view\nthat it would be “administratively inconvenient to comply with the Consti-\ntution” misrepresents the record. \n\n2262 BULL v. SAN FRANCISCO\nU.S. at 90. Accordingly, a straightforward application of Tur-\nner likewise leads to the conclusion that San Francisco’s strip\nsearch  policy  did  not  violate  the  class  members’  Fourth\nAmendment rights because it was “reasonably related to [the]\nlegitimate  penological  interests”  of  the  jail  in  maintaining\nsecurity for inmates and employees by preventing contraband\nsmuggling. Id. at 89.\nC\n[7] Plaintiffs argue this conclusion is inconsistent with our\nearlier decisions in Thompson v. City of Los Angeles, 885\nF.2d 1439 (9th Cir. 1989), and Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d\n614 (9th Cir. 1984) (per curiam), which held that a blanket\npolicy of strip searching arrestees was per se unconstitutional,\neven if the arrestees were to be transferred into the general\npopulation. In revisiting these opinions today, we conclude\nthey failed to give due weight to the principles emphasized in\nBell and reiterated in Turner.\nIn Giles, a woman arrested for a minor traffic offense was\nstrip searched in accordance with county policy before being\nbooked  at  the  county  jail.  We  concluded  that  “arrestees\ncharged  with  minor  offenses  may  be  subjected  to  a  strip\nsearch only if jail officials possess a reasonable suspicion that\nthe individual arrestee is carrying or concealing contraband.”\n746 F.2d at 617. Because the county lacked such a reasonable\nsuspicion in Giles’s case, we held the strip search violated her\nconstitutional  rights.  We  distinguished  the  facts  of  Giles’s\ncase from the situation in Bell on several grounds. First, we\ndetermined that a strip search of every arrestee booked into a\ncounty  jail  was  “not  necessary  to  protect  the  institution’s\nsecurity interest,” in part because arrestees could be segre-\ngated from more dangerous inmates. Id. We refused to accord\nweight to the fact Giles had been placed in the general jail\npopulation, reasoning that “such intermingling is both limited\nand  avoidable.”  Id.  at  618-19.  Second,  we  stated  that  the\ndetainees in Bell “were charged with offenses more serious\n\nBULL v. SAN FRANCISCO 2263\nthan minor traffic violations, and . . . they were therefore\ndetained for substantial pretrial periods.” Id. at 617. Third, we\nnoted the county had not demonstrated that the jail had a seri-\nous  smuggling  problem,  because  only  eleven  incidents  of\nsmuggling had been detected in the preceding eighteen-month\nperiod. Id. Finally, we determined the county had not demon-\nstrated that its strip search policy had a deterrent effect, rea-\nsoning “[v]isitors to the detention facility in Bell could plan\ntheir visits and organize their smuggling activities,” whereas\nconfinement in the county jail was an unplanned event, “so\nthe policy could not possibly deter arrestees from carrying\ncontraband.” Id. \nIn Thompson, we upheld the constitutionality of the coun-\nty’s strip search of a man arrested for grand theft auto because\nhis offense was “sufficiently associated with violence to jus-\ntify a visual strip search.” 885 F.2d at 1447. Following Giles,\nwe confirmed that strip searches must be based on individual-\nized reasonable suspicion that an arrestee is carrying contra-\nband, and cannot be justified on the ground that an arrestee is\nbeing placed in contact with the general jail population. Id. \nThompson and Giles failed to comply with the Supreme\nCourt’s direction that we not substitute our judgment for that\nof corrections facility officials. Bell, 441 U.S. at 540 n.23.\nFirst, our conclusion in Giles that strip searches of arrestees\nheading into the general jail population must be based on indi-\nvidualized suspicion is inconsistent with the approach adopted\nin Bell. The Supreme Court did not require MCC officials to\nconsider the individual characteristics of the persons subject\nto the strip search policy. Nor did the Court require MCC offi-\ncials to articulate their suspicions that a particular person sub-\nject  to  the  policy  was  smuggling  contraband.  Rather,  the\nSupreme Court upheld a policy of strip searching all persons\nwho had contact visits as categorically reasonable under the\ncircumstances in the detention facility. Id. at 559-60; see Hud-\nson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. at 538 (O’Connor, J., concurring)\n(stating that in certain contexts, such as the one considered in\n\n2264 BULL v. SAN FRANCISCO\nBell, “the Court has rejected the case-by-case approach to the\n‘reasonableness’ inquiry in favor of an approach that deter-\nmines the reasonableness of contested practices in a categori-\ncal  fashion”  (citing  Bell,  441  U.S.  at  555-60));  see  also\nSkinner v. Ry. Labor Executives’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 619-20\n(1989) (describing special needs cases and citing Bell). More-\nover, the question whether strip searches could be justified\neven in the absence of individualized suspicion was squarely\nraised in Bell. See 441 U.S. at 563 (Powell, J., concurring in\npart and dissenting in part) (dissenting on the sole ground that\n“at least some level of cause, such as a reasonable suspicion,\nshould be required to justify the anal and genital searches\ndescribed in this case”); id. at 578 (Marshall, J., dissenting)\n(disagreeing with the majority in part on the ground that “the\nsearches are employed absent any suspicion of wrongdoing”).\nYet the Court declined to impose an individualized suspicion\nrequirement, notwithstanding criticism from Justices Powell\nand Marshall.\nSecond, we erred in concluding that arrestees charged with\nminor offenses “pose no security threat to the facility.” Giles,\n746 F.2d at 618.14 Bell did not require MCC officials to mod-\nify the strip search policy based on whether a detainee had\nbeen charged with a serious or minor offense. Indeed, the\ndetention facility in Bell housed witnesses in protective cus-\ntody and persons detained pursuant to contempt orders, and\nthose persons were included in the class of plaintiffs. 441 U.S.\nat 524, 526 n.5; see also United States ex rel. Wolfish v. Levi,\n439 F. Supp. 114, 119 (S.D.N.Y. 1977) (defining the class of\nplaintiffs as “pre-trial detainees for whom the facility was pri-\nmarily designed, sentenced prisoners either awaiting assign-\n14The dissent repeats this error in asserting that “persons with no crimi-\nnal history arrested for trivial offenses pose no credible risk of smuggling\ncontraband into jails.” As in Giles, this appellate fact finding constitutes\nthe “sort of unguided substitution of judicial judgment for that of the\nexpert prison administrators” the Supreme Court has forbidden. Bell, 441\nU.S. at 554. \n\nBULL v. SAN FRANCISCO 2265\nment  to  a  prison  facility  or  assigned  here  to  serve  their\n(usually relatively short) terms, prisoners here on writs to tes-\ntify or to stand trial, witnesses in protective custody, and per-\nsons incarcerated for contempt”). “The MCC was hardly a\nfacility where all of the detainees were ‘awaiting trial on seri-\nous federal charges,’ as some of the opinions of other circuits\nseem to indicate.” Evans v. Stephens, 407 F.3d 1272, 1291\n(11th Cir. 2005) (en banc) (Carnes, J., concurring specially).\nThird,  Giles  erred  in  deciding  that  a  record  of  eleven\ninstances  of  smuggling  was  insufficient  to  demonstrate  a\nsmuggling problem. 746 F.2d at 617-18. Bell did not require\nofficials to demonstrate a lengthy history of multiple incidents\nof smuggling. Rather, in Bell, MCC officials had determined\nthat, in their professional judgment, strip and visual cavity\nsearches after contact visits were necessary for deterrence as\nwell as detection of contraband. 441 U.S. at 558. In light of\nthis decision, which was not “irrational or unreasonable,” id.\nat 559 n.40, the Supreme Court held MCC’s strip search pol-\nicy was constitutional even though MCC had detected just a\nsingle incident of contraband smuggling, id. at 559; see also\nNat’l Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab, 489 U.S. 656,\n675  n.3  (1989)  (“When  the  Government’s  interest  lies  in\ndeterring highly hazardous conduct, a low incidence of such\nconduct, far from impugning the validity of the scheme for\nimplementing this interest, is more logically viewed as a hall-\nmark of success.” (citing Bell, 441 U.S. at 559)).15\n15Thus, the dissent’s argument that Bell requires a “factbound, data-\ndriven inquiry into the categorical reasonableness of the search” mis-\ncharacterizes the Court’s holding. In overruling the district court and the\nSecond Circuit, Bell rejected the empirical evidence requirement adopted\nby those courts, see Wolfish, 439 F. Supp. at 147; Wolfish, 573 F.2d at\n131, and upheld MCC’s strip search policy even though there had been\nonly one incident of prior contraband smuggling. Indeed, Bell suggested\nthat the strip search policy would have been valid in the absence of any\nproof of incidents of contraband smuggling, because the absence of con-\ntraband may indicate that the policy is an effective deterrent. Bell, 441\nU.S. at 559 (“That there has been only one instance where an MCC inmate\nwas discovered attempting to smuggle contraband into the institution on\nhis person may be more a testament to the effectiveness of this search\ntechnique as a deterrent than to any lack of interest on the part of the\ninmates to secrete and import such items when the opportunity arises.”).\n\n2266 BULL v. SAN FRANCISCO\nFinally, Giles erred in assuming that a strip search policy\ncould not have a deterrent effect on persons who have been\narrested and are being introduced into the general jail popula-\ntion for the first time, 746 F.2d at 617, as opposed to detain-\nees who are already in the general jail population and are\nengaging in contact visits. In both scenarios, the individuals\nhave access to contraband and can conceal dangerous items\non their person. “There is no denying that arrestees entering\na detention facility usually have had plenty of contact with\noutsiders, most having been outsiders themselves until they\nwere arrested.” Powell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298, 1313 (11th\nCir. 2008) (en banc). Thus, the effort to distinguish Bell on\nthe ground that “arrestees do not ordinarily have notice that\nthey are about to be arrested and thus an opportunity to hide\nsomething,” Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56, 64 (2d Cir. 2001),\nand therefore are less likely to hide contraband on their person\nthan persons already in jail who engage in contact visits, is\nunpersuasive.16 As the Eleventh Circuit noted, “[n]ot everyone\nwho is arrested is surprised, seized, and slapped into hand-\ncuffs  without  a  moment’s  notice.  Some  people  surrender\nwhen they are notified that a warrant for them is outstanding.\n. . . [Some] have notice that officers are coming to arrest\nthem,” and those persons arrested after a vehicle stop “may\nhave time to hide items on their person before the officer\nreaches the car door. Then there are those who deliberately\nget themselves arrested.” Powell, 541 F.3d at 1313. \nGiles’s  hypothesis  that  arrestees  lack  the  opportunity  to\nhide contraband on their person is also belied by the evidence\nin  this  case.  The  record  establishes  that  San  Francisco\ndetected  a  substantial  amount  of  contraband  during  strip\n16Although the dissent argues that “[a]s a matter of common sense, con-\ntact visits are far more likely to lead to smuggling than initial arrests,” it\noffers no support for this factual finding. But see Bell, 441 U.S. at 547\n(holding that courts should accord “wide-ranging deference” to prison\nadministrators’ judgment of the practices and policies needed to “preserve\ninternal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security”). \n\nBULL v. SAN FRANCISCO 2267\nsearches of arrestees at the San Francisco jail, and also indi-\ncates that arrestees facing a strip search have jettisoned con-\ntraband in the holding cell. This evidence shows that arrestees\ndo, in fact, have both the opportunity and inclination to con-\nceal contraband in private bodily areas before being trans-\nported to County Jail No. 9, and that a strip search policy may\nhave a deterrent effect. Because we see no meaningful differ-\nence between the institutional concerns raised by contact vis-\nits in Bell and those raised by introducing arrestees into the\ngeneral jail population in this case, we must reject this pur-\nported distinction of Bell. \nFor the same reasons, we disagree with those other circuits\nthat have held strip searches of arrestees entering the general\njail population per se unreasonable unless the officials have\nindividualized  reasonable  suspicion  that  the  arrestees  are\nsmuggling contraband. See, e.g., Roberts v. Rhode Island, 239\nF.3d 107, 112 (1st Cir. 2001); Shain, 273 F.3d at 65; Masters\nv. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1255 (6th Cir. 1989). These courts\nhave purported to distinguish Bell on several grounds: that\npersons arrested on certain minor offenses do not represent a\nsecurity concern, see, e.g., Roberts, 239 F.3d at 111, Masters,\n872 F.2d at 1255; that persons who are arrested are less likely\nto smuggle contraband than detainees already in the general\njail population who engage in contact visits, see, e.g., Roberts,\n239 F.3d at 112; and that a blanket strip search policy for all\narrestees entering the general jail population is unreasonable\nunless officials have demonstrated the existence of a signifi-\ncant smuggling problem and that a blanket policy has a signif-\nicant deterrent effect, see, e.g., id. As explained above, this\nreasoning  is  inconsistent  with  both  the  general  principles\nenunciated in Bell and Turner, and with the specific applica-\ntion of those principles to the strip search at issue in Bell.\nMoreover, these decisions are inconsistent with the Supreme\nCourt’s warning that federal courts must avoid substituting\ntheir judgment for the “professional expertise of corrections\nofficials” in “determining whether restrictions or conditions\nare reasonably related to the Government’s interest in main-\n\n2268 BULL v. SAN FRANCISCO\ntaining security and order and operating the institution in a\nmanageable fashion.” 441 U.S. at 540 n.23. While federal\ncourts may “disagree[ ] with the judgment of [corrections]\nofficials about the extent of the security interests affected and\nthe means required to further those interests,” the Supreme\nCourt’s “decisions have time and again emphasized that this\nsort of unguided substitution of judicial judgment for that of\nthe expert prison administrators on matters such as this is\ninappropriate.” Id. at 554. \n[8] We agree with the reasoning of the Eleventh Circuit\nthat the rights of arrestees placed in custodial housing with the\ngeneral jail population “are not violated by a policy or prac-\ntice of strip searching each one of them as part of the booking\nprocess, provided that the searches are no more intrusive on\nprivacy interests than those upheld in the Bell case,” and the\nsearches are “not conducted in an abusive manner.” Powell,\n541 F.3d at 1314; cf. Archuleta v. Wagner, 523 F.3d 1278,\n1284 (10th Cir. 2008) (upholding searches of arrestees inter-\nmingled with general population of a corrections facility, but\nnot those awaiting bail, and stating that when an arrestee is\nkept in a holding cell the “obvious security concerns inherent\nin a situation where the detainee will be placed in the general\nprison  population  are  simply  not  apparent”).  We  therefore\noverrule our own panel opinions in Thompson and Giles.\n[9] We do not, however, disturb our prior opinions consid-\nering searches of arrestees who were not classified for hous-\ning in the general jail or prison population.17 See, e.g., Way v.\n17Thus the dissent misrepresents the reach of the San Francisco policy\nand our holding in claiming that we are “sweep[ing] away twenty-five\nyears of jurisprudence,” and “giving jailors the unfettered right” to search\n“any citizen who may be arrested for minor offenses.” The strip search\npolicy at issue in this case, and our holding today, applies only to detain-\nees classified to enter the general corrections facility population. The dis-\nsent fails to differentiate between cases considering the constitutionality of\nstrip searches of arrestees who were classified for housing in the general\npopulation, and strip searches of arrestees in other contexts. \n\nBULL v. SAN FRANCISCO 2269\nCounty of Ventura, 445 F.3d 1157, 1160 (9th Cir. 2006) (con-\nsidering the strip search of an intoxicated arrestee who was\ndetained until sober and never housed with the general jail\npopulation); Act Up!/Portland v. Bagley, 988 F.2d 868, 871\n(9th Cir. 1993) (considering the strip search of arrestees who\nwere cited and released); Fuller v. M.G. Jewelry, 950 F.2d\n1437,  1445-46  (9th  Cir.  1991)  (considering  the  search  of\narrestees without considering whether they would be held in\nthe general jail population); Kennedy v. L.A. Police Dep’t,\n901  F.2d  702,  712  (9th  Cir.  1990)  (considering  the  strip\nsearch of an arrestee who was placed in a holding cell until\nposting bond); Ward v. County of San Diego, 791 F.2d 1329,\n1333  (9th  Cir.  1986)  (considering  the  strip  search  of  an\narrestee who was searched before the determination was made\nas to whether she was eligible for release on her own recogni-\nzance). The constitutionality of searches of arrestees at the\nplace of arrest, searches at the stationhouse prior to booking,\nand searches pursuant to an evidentiary investigation must be\nanalyzed under different principles than those at issue today.\nSee, e.g., Winston v. Lee, 470 U.S. 753, 762-63 (1985) (ana-\nlyzing a physically invasive search of an arrestee intended to\nuncover vital evidence in criminal investigation); Illinois v.\nLafayette, 462 U.S. 640, 646 (1983) (addressing inventory\nsearches at the stationhouse intended to avoid theft, ascertain\nidentity, and maintain security in a police station); United\nStates  v.  Robinson,  414  U.S.  218,  235  (1973)  (discussing\nsearches incident to lawful arrest, which are “based upon the\nneed to disarm and to discover evidence”); see also Evans,\n407 F.3d at 1279.\nD\nIn rejecting our analysis, the dissent devises its own test for\ndetermining whether the strip search of an arrestee is constitu-\ntional. First, the dissent contends that “strip searches must be\njustified by individualized reasonable suspicion” or, at the\nvery  least,  “categorical  reasonableness  based  on  empirical\nevidence  that  the  policy  is  necessary.”  The  categorical\n\n2270 BULL v. SAN FRANCISCO\napproach must be “narrowly tailored” because “the most inva-\nsive search is justified only by the most compelling need.”18\nUltimately, the dissent’s analysis and proposed test amount\nto a disagreement with Bell. Under Bell, as explained above,\na strip search policy in these circumstances need not be based\non individualized reasonable suspicion or empirical evidence\nthat the policy is necessary. In fact, the MCC’s strip search\npolicy would probably not pass muster under the dissent’s\ntest. The MCC’s policy was not supported by empirical data:\nThe MCC proved “only one instance . . . where contraband\nwas found during a body-cavity search.” Bell, 441 U.S. at\n558. Nor was there evidence that the contraband was found on\na person who might meet the dissent’s standard for raising\nreasonable suspicion to justify a search. Id. at 559. Under\nBell, the question (disputed by the parties) whether there is an\n“example of anyone from the class defined by the district\ncourt who was found to possess contraband upon being strip\nsearched” is not dispositive, or even relevant. As the dissent\nacknowledges, “Bell directly controls here.” Bell is inconsis-\n18The dissent attempts to support this test by pointing to Supreme Court\ndecisions that are considerably far afield from the situation here. For\nexample, it cites Safford Unified School District #1 v. Redding, 129 S. Ct.\n2633 (2009), to support its theory that “a strip search policy violates the\nFourth Amendment when there is little evidence that the searches will\nresult in the discovery of contraband.” As the dissent acknowledges, this\ndecision  arose  in  a  “slightly  different  context.”  Specifically,  Safford\naddressed the rights of school children, and “it goes almost without saying\nthat the prisoner and the schoolchild stand in wholly different circum-\nstances.” New Jersey v. T.L.O., 469 U.S. 325, 338 (1985) (internal quota-\ntion marks and alteration omitted). As the Court remarked, “[w]e are not\nyet ready to hold that the schools and the prisons need be equated for pur-\nposes of the Fourth Amendment.” Id. at 338-39. The considerations that\ninformed the Court’s analysis in Safford are not applicable here. The dis-\nsent also cites the Supreme Court’s standard for demonstrating the exis-\ntence of probable cause when applying to a magistrate for a warrant. Of\ncourse, corrections officials do not need probable cause and a warrant in\norder to conduct searches related to institutional security. See, e.g., Hud-\nson, 468 U.S. at 538 (O’Connor, J., concurring); Bell, 441 U.S. at 560. \n\nBULL v. SAN FRANCISCO 2271\ntent with the dissent’s analysis, and compels the conclusion\nwe reach in this case. We must therefore reject the dissent’s\napproach  for  determining  the  constitutionality  of  strip\nsearches of detainees entering the general population of a cor-\nrections facility.\nIV\n[10] In light of governing Supreme Court precedent, and\ngiven the circumstances presented here, we conclude that San\nFrancisco’s  policy  requiring  strip  searches  of  all  arrestees\nclassified for custodial housing in the general population was\nfacially reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, notwith-\nstanding the lack of individualized reasonable suspicion as to\nthe individuals searched. Because the policy did not violate\nplaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment rights, we reverse the district\ncourt’s denial of Sheriff Hennessey’s motion for summary\njudgment based on qualified immunity, and in doing so neces-\nsarily reverse the district court’s grant of plaintiffs’ motion for\npartial summary judgment as to Fourth Amendment liability.\nREVERSED.\nKOZINSKI, Chief Judge, with whom Judge GOULD joins,\nconcurring:\nThe interesting and difficult question at the heart of this\ncase is whether federal judges can force government officials\nto  subdivide  classes  of  people  subject  to  a  valid  Fourth\nAmendment search into sub-classes that present a materially\ndifferent Fourth Amendment calculus. That question can arise\nin many contexts, and the answer will have far-reaching con-\nsequences.\nThere was a time in our constitutional history when one\nmight have argued that the Fourth Amendment requires indi-\n\n2272 BULL v. SAN FRANCISCO\nvidualized suspicion for every search and an appropriate con-\nstitutional balance as to each individual. If that was ever the\ncase, it’s not so now: The government is entitled to search\nclasses of individuals based on a balance struck for the class\nas a whole, regardless of whether there’s reasonable suspicion\n—or any suspicion at all—as to any particular member. Bell\nv. Wolfish tells us that everyone in prison who participates in\na contact visit may be strip searched. 411 U.S. 520, 558-60\n(1979).  We’ve  known  for  some  time  that  everyone  who\nboards a commercial airplane may be subject to a fairly intru-\nsive search, United States v. Edwards, 498 F.2d 496, 500 (2d\nCir. 1974) (Friendly, J.), as may everyone who enters a public\nbuilding, McMorris v. Alioto, 567 F.2d 897, 900-01 (9th Cir.\n1978) (Kennedy, J.). We’ve said that truck drivers can be\nsearched without individual suspicion. Int’l Brotherhood of\nTeamsters v. Dep’t of Transp., 932 F.2d 1292, 1300 (9th Cir.\n1991). And the Supreme Court has approved such suspicion-\nless searches for railroad workers, Skinner v. Ry. Labor Exec-\nutives  Ass’n,  489  U.S.  602,  624  (1989),  student  athletes,\nVernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 665 (1995),\nstudents participating in other extracurricular activities, Bd. of\nEduc. of Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 92 of Pottawatomie County v.\nEarls, 536 U.S. 822, 838 (2002), customs agents, Nat’l Trea-\nsury  Employees  Union  v.  Von  Raab,  489  U.S.  656,  677\n(1989), prisoners released on parole, Samson v. California,\n547 U.S. 843, 846 (2006), and people crossing the border,\nUnited States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543, 545 (1976).\nThe class to be searched is generally defined by the activity\nin question: In Bell, it was the class of all inmates who had\ncontact visits; in other situations it’s all those who seek to\nboard an aircraft, enter a building, drive a truck, perform cer-\ntain law enforcement functions or engage in particular extra-\ncurricular  activities.  In  a  very  important  sense,  such\nclassifications trade the protection afforded by individualized\nsuspicion for protection derived from the fact that the govern-\nment treats all similarly situated people in precisely the same\nway.\n\nBULL v. SAN FRANCISCO 2273\nWhich brings us to the hard question: Do individuals sub-\nject to class-wide search based on risks attributable to the\nclass as a whole have a constitutional right to get themselves\ncertified as a sub-class as to which a lesser search, or no\nsearch at all, is reasonable? For example, should some people\nbe  exempt  from  the  inconvenience  and  delay  of  airport\nsearches because they belong to a sub-class that has a materi-\nally lower likelihood of hijacking a plane—e.g. the class of\nfederal judges nominated by the President and confirmed by\nthe Senate? Or should certain individuals who enter public\nbuildings be exempt from search because they belong to a\nlearned profession and therefore present a lower risk? Com-\npare Klarfeld v. United States, 944 F.2d 583, 588 (9th Cir.\n1991) (Pregerson, J., concurring in the result), with Klarfeld,\n962 F.2d 866, 870 (9th Cir. 1992) (Kozinski, J., dissenting\nfrom denial of rehearing en banc). This question could be\nposed  multiple  times  for  any  regime  where  searches  are\nauthorized based on suspicion applicable to a class—by truck\ndrivers with exemplary driving records; customs agents who\nhave never been subject to discipline; high school football\nplayers who maintain a B+ average (few); prison inmates con-\nvicted of genteel crimes; the list is endless.\nThe Supreme Court has held that individuals are sometimes\nentitled to an individualized Fourth Amendment calculus, and\nat other times they’re entitled to a class-wide calculus. See,\ne.g., Skinner, 489 U.S. at 624. But it has never held that\nthey’re entitled to carve out a sub-class as to which a different\nFourth Amendment balance must be struck. In the absence of\nSupreme Court guidance, I am reluctant to take that step. I\ncan think of at least three reasons, all illustrated by this case,\nwhy it might not be such a swell idea.\nFirst, there’s a degree of subjectivity that attends any classi-\nfication, and that subjectivity can easily transform into elit-\nism. It’s no coincidence, I believe, that the class of people\nselected for favorable treatment by the district court in this\ncase are those who have been arrested for the kinds of crimes\n\n2274 BULL v. SAN FRANCISCO\nthat any of us, or at least our friends and neighbors, might be\narrested for: those who violate traffic laws, leash laws, or\ninsurance requirements, or maybe the Martha Stewarts and\nBernie Ebbers of the world. Plaintiff Michael Marron was\narrested for “credit card fraud at the Hotel Nikka [sic],” where\nany  of  us  might  stay  when  visiting  San  Francisco.  Mary\nBull’s  story  might  seem  less  compelling  if  she  had  been\narrested  for  vandalism  ordinaire,  e.g.  throwing  bricks  at  a\nstore  window,  rather  than  vandalism  chic,  throwing  fake\nblood at a political protest. Steve Noh was arrested for battery\n“while celebrating Gay-Pride Week in the Castro,” and Jonah\nZern was arrested for resisting a police officer at a “peace”\nrally. We can imagine one of our close relatives, perhaps a\nchild  or  grandchild,  being  put  in  jail  under  such  circum-\nstances. It’s much harder to empathize when a strip search is\nsuffered by those less like us, such as those who are suspected\nof engaging in robberies or street fights. \nBut  in  a  democracy  there  is  a  very  important  value,\nenshrined in the Equal Protection Clause, in treating everyone\nwho stands on the same footing alike. See Vernonia Sch. Dist.\n47J, 515 U.S. at 663-64. If the government treats you badly,\nthere’s comfort in knowing that no one in the same situation\nis spared because of status, income or class. Not only does\nmisery love company, but equal treatment for everyone—the\nrich and poor, the powerful and weak, blue collar as well as\nwhite—creates a strong political check against making the\ntreatment worse. I’m convinced that airport searches would be\nfar more intrusive if upper and middle-class Americans were\nexempt. Not only would the unexempt suffer the indignity of\nunequal treatment, but those conducting the searches would\nfind good reason, and little political opposition, to ratchet up\nthe duration and scope. The best protection for plaintiff de\nRanleau, who is homeless, is to make sure that Marron, Bull,\nNoh and Zern are treated no better. \nSecond, lines drawn by courts rather than dictated by the\nfunctional requirements of an activity tend to be ambiguous,\n\nBULL v. SAN FRANCISCO 2275\nsubject to manipulation and difficult to administer. Treating\neveryone who gets on a commercial plane the same is simple:\nIf you want to get on a plane, you take off your shoes, leave\nbehind any liquids over three ounces, remove your laptop\nfrom its carrying case and pass through the metal detector—\nno exceptions. If we were to order an exemption for the least\nrisky segments of the population, we’d have to worry about\nhow to identify those people—that is, what kind of screening\nwe’d have to set up to make sure no fakers get into the system\n—and then, at the point of entry, we’d have to confirm that\nthe people presenting themselves for boarding were, in fact,\nthe ones cleared in advance. The operation, and recent failure,\nof the Clear system (which let you cut to the front of the line\nbut  otherwise  didn’t  exempt  you  from  much  of  anything)\nshowed  that  kind  of  exemption  is  difficult  and  costly  to\nadminister, and results in a lot of dirty looks from those you\ncut in front of.\nOur case makes the point: The district court carved out a\nclass of people to exempt from the strip-search policy consist-\ning of all those arrested on a charge not involving (a) weap-\nons, (b) controlled substances, or (c) violence, and (d) as to\nwhom  there  was  not  individualized  reasonable  suspicion.\nSounds easy to separate the sheep from the goats, but it’s not.\nKeep in mind that a member of the class must satisfy (nega-\ntively) all four of the criteria—in other words, failure as to\nany one will take someone out of the class and make him sub-\nject to the strip-search policy. Each criterion is porous and\nsubjective; there can be endless quarrels (and lawsuits) as to\nwhether someone did or did not fall into any of the categories.\nLet’s start with the first one, weapons. If you’re arrested for\ncarrying a Gatling gun or Carl Gustav you would surely fall\ninto the category, but what about a butterfly knife? How about\na baseball bat or golf club? Or how about Lisa Giampaoli, one\nof the named plaintiffs, who was arrested because her dog bit\na young man who was allegedly harassing her. Was that a\nleash law violation or an attack with a deadly canine? See\n\n2276 BULL v. SAN FRANCISCO\nPeople v. Nealis, 283 Cal.Rptr. 376 (Cal. Ct. App. 1991).\nWhat about reckless driving: Traffic violation or attack with\na ton of steel? Earlier this year, an en banc panel split 6-5 as\nto whether a shank made from melted-down Styrofoam and\nused by an inmate to wound another was a dangerous weapon.\nUnited  States  v.  Smith,  561  F.3d  934  (9th  Cir.  2009)  (en\nbanc).  If  federal  judges  can’t  agree,  how  are  the  deputies\ngoing to sort out such cases? \nNext, controlled substances. Anyone caught with Smack or\nCrack falls into the category, but what about Valium or Oxy-\nContin?  What  about  unauthorized  possession  of  steroids?\nNon-prescription  drugs  that  contain  pseudoephedrine?  See,\ne.g., United States v. Jae Gab Kim, 449 F.3d 933 (9th Cir.\n2006). Alcohol and tobacco are highly controlled substances.\nDo plaintiffs Mangosing, Johnson and Bronson, arrested for\npublic intoxication, fall into this category? Could the jail treat\na  merchant  who  sold  cigarettes  to  a  minor  as  someone\ncharged with a controlled substance offense?\nNow let’s take the third category of offenses for which strip\nsearches are permitted under the district court’s order, namely\npeople arrested for crimes of violence. We have a whole body\nof caselaw dealing with what constitutes a crime of violence\nfor purposes of federal criminal and immigration law; among\nthe activities we’ve considered are burglary, statutory rape,\ninvoluntary  manslaughter,  possession  of  an  unregistered\nshort-barreled shotgun, reckless vehicular assault, vehicular\nmanslaughter while intoxicated, kidnapping, stalking, arson,\nescape, conspiracy to interfere with interstate commerce by\nrobbery, grand theft, mayhem, recklessly setting fire to forest\nland, indecent liberties with a minor, carrying a gun while\ncommitting a drug offense and being an accessory after the\nfact to commission of murder for hire. And we often disagree.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Chambers, 473 F.3d 724, 726 (7th\nCir. 2007) (escape is a crime of violence); United States v.\nPiccolo, 441 F.3d 1084, 1088 (9th Cir. 2006) (no it’s not);\nUnited  States  v.  Asberry,  394  F.3d  712,  715-16  (9th  Cir.\n\nBULL v. SAN FRANCISCO 2277\n2005) (statutory rape is a crime of violence); id. at 722 (Bea,\nJ., concurring) (no way); United States v. Wenner, 351 F.3d\n969, 974 (9th Cir. 2003) (burglary is not a crime of violence);\nid. at 977 (Wallace, J., dissenting) (is too); United States v.\nJohnson, 448 F.3d 1017, 1018 (8th Cir. 2006) (grand theft\nauto is); Von Don Nguyen v. Holder, 571 F.3d 524, 525 (6th\nCir. 2009) (au contraire); Malta-Espinoza v. Gonzales, 478\nF.3d 1080, 1084 (9th Cir. 2007) (stalking isn’t); id. at 1088\n(Duffy,  J.,  dissenting)  (“I  respectfully  dissent.”);  United\nStates v. Saavedra-Velazquez, 578 F.3d 1103, 1110 (9th Cir.\n2009) (Reinhardt, J.) (attempted robbery is); id. (Reinhardt, J.,\nspecially concurring) (or is it?); United States v. Trinidad-\nAquino,  259  F.3d  1140,  1146  (drunk-driving-resulting-in-\nbodily-injury is a gentle crime); id. at 1147 (Kozinski, J., dis-\nsenting) (Bull!). How is a Deputy Sheriff confronted with a\nsuspect arrested on possible charges of vandalism (like plain-\ntiff  Bull),  burglary  (like  plaintiff  Timbrook)  or  interfering\nwith a police officer (like plaintiff Galvin) going to know\nwhether such individuals are subject to search?\nFinally, we get to the most troublesome category: cases\nwhere the deputies determine there’s individualized suspicion\nfor a search. The district court found this includes anyone\nwith a prior involving weapons, controlled substances or vio-\nlence, thereby importing all the ambiguities discussed above.\nBut even arrestees without relevant priors may be searched if\ntheir conduct raises suspicion that they’re smuggling contra-\nband. So what exactly does that encompass? While struggling\nto prove that no member of the protected class has ever been\nfound with contraband in their private spaces (a point the dis-\nsent takes up with some zest, Dissent at 2288, 2299, 2300-01,\n2301-02, 2302, 2305), plaintiffs classify an arrestee who was\n“nodding off,” and another who was “nervous,” as inmates as\nto whom there was individualized suspicion. If “nodding off”\nand “nervous” are sufficient for individualized suspicion, can\n“gave me a dirty look,” “was hyperactive” or “had poor pos-\nture” be far behind? \n\n2278 BULL v. SAN FRANCISCO\nHow, exactly, are deputies to know what does and does not\namount  to  individualized  suspicion,  and  who  ultimately\ndecides?  Administering  this  category,  like  the  others  dis-\ncussed above, will require a fair amount of trial and error, and\na substantial degree of judicial involvement. No need to guess\nhow  much:  A  case  pending  before  the  same  judge  in  the\nNorthern District, Yourke v. City and County of San Fran-\ncisco, No. 03-CV-03105-CRB, gives a foretaste. Yourke was\narrested  on  a  warrant  for  a  traffic  offense  after  police\nobserved him engaged in what looked a lot like a drug deal.\nBut Yourke claims it looked like an innocent chat between\nfriends. Who’s to say who’s right? Not only will courts have\nto draw these difficult lines; jails will have to guess how\ncourts will draw them. Being the subject of a court order and\nrisking personal liability, deputies will probably err on the\nside of caution, to the detriment of prisoners faced with an\nincreased risk of harm from smuggled contraband.\nAnd when a search ends up in court, how will officers\nprove they had individualized suspicion? The record contains\nthe report of a prisoner who told a guard, “wait to [sic] you\nsee what I have up my ass.” Was this a joke that the deputies\nwere required to ignore or did it give them grounds for a strip\nsearch? And what if the inmate denies making the statement?\nOr disputes that he was “nodding off” or “nervous”? By its\nnature, individualized suspicion will rely on observations and\ndiagnoses that will be hard (if not impossible) to record and\nrelay to judges and juries months or years after the event. \nWhich brings me to my third objection to the judicial cre-\nation of sub-classes exempt from a search regime, namely that\nit will likely, perhaps inevitably, require far too much judicial\ninvolvement in the administration of the sub-class. It’s easy\nenough to say who is and is not going to enter the general\npopulation of a jail, just as it’s easy to say who is going to\nengage in a contact visit, board a commercial aircraft, enter a\npublic building, drive a railroad or play high school football.\nThe activity in question defines the class. But once courts\n\nBULL v. SAN FRANCISCO 2279\nstart carving out constitutionally favored sub-classes because\nthe members belong to some imaginary group with a lower\nrisk-rating than the class as a whole, courts cannot avoid get-\nting intimately involved in the conduct of the activity. This\none case has generated a substantial record, countless lower\ncourt pleadings and no less than seven appellate opinions—so\nfar. And Yourke, a case involving just a single strip search,\nhas been ongoing over six years. If plaintiffs here succeed,\nevery strip search will become a potential federal case. Fed-\neral judges will start running the jails, along with pretty much\neverything else. \nThe intervention won’t be limited to a single class action,\neither, as future litigants won’t be bound by the lines drawn\nin earlier cases. If these plaintiffs were to prevail, nothing\nwould prevent a future plaintiff from trying to show that wife-\nbeaters aren’t hardened criminals, generally act out of anger\nand frustration and not with premeditation and, though they\nmight use a golf club or meat cleaver to threaten their mates,\naren’t likely to be packing such implements up their wazoos\nwhen police come to arrest them. Could that claim be dis-\nmissed out of hand? Not according to plaintiffs (including\nMarcy Corneau, arrested for “fighting with her boyfriend”)\nand the dissent, who would put the onus on the jail to prove\nsome past instance where a strip search of someone arrested\nfor domestic violence yielded at least a dirk.\nAs this case illustrates, institutions aren’t equipped to deal\nwith such challenges, which generally call for justifications\nfor past conduct that no one knew would be required. Thus,\nplaintiffs and the dissent try to get mileage out of the fact that\ndefendants have been unable to point to a single member of\nthe class found carrying contraband. Dissent at 2288, 2299,\n2300-01, 2301-02, 2302, 2305. But at the time the searches\nwere conducted, there was no class as defined by plaintiffs\nand the district court, so no one knew such justification would\nbe required. The reports prepared by the jail to record the\nfinding of contraband are accordingly ambiguous; very few\n\n2280 BULL v. SAN FRANCISCO\nconclusively show that the individual found with contraband\nwas not a member of the class, and about half are entirely\nsilent as to why the individual was searched. Plaintiffs want\nus to infer that no contraband was ever found among the class,\nbut that’s hardly fair. The truth is that, on this record, we\ndon’t know. Moreover, as Judge Tallman’s dissent from the\npanel opinion points out, plaintiffs’ central claim that mem-\nbers of the class never, ever conceal contraband is almost cer-\ntainly wrong as a matter of fact. Bull v. City and County of\nSan Francisco, 539 F.3d 1193, 1210 (9th Cir. 2008) (Tallman,\nJ., dissenting). \nThe reason past contraband reports don’t disclose the crime\nfor which the individual was arrested is that it’s not germane\nto the purpose of the report, which is to account for a piece\nof property, possibly illegal or evidence of a crime, that has\ncome into possession of the authorities. But if such reports are\nused in litigation, with omissions held against the institution,\nthen a rational response will be to lengthen the reports to\ninclude any information that might be relevant to any case\nthat any future plaintiff might bring. And it won’t be just\nreports:  There  will  be  constant  tweaking  of  policies  to\nrespond to the next class action, endless training as to what\nconstitutes a “weapon” or a “controlled substance” and count-\nless hours spent giving depositions and testifying in court.\nPretty soon, those involved in operating the institution will be\ndevoting most of their time and energy to averting liability\nrather than running the institution effectively.\nThe dissent shrugs this off as no big problem because, sup-\nposedly, the San Francisco jail system operates better than\never under a policy enacted in 2004 that, in effect, adopts the\ndistrict court’s order for the duration of the lawsuit. Dissent\nat 2299. But our dissenting colleague misreads the record.\nBoth Sheriff Hennessey and Under-Sheriff Dempsey express\ngrave doubts about the new policy; they make it quite clear\nthat they are putting up with it in order to limit their liability,\nbut that they believe it “increases the danger to staff and\n\nBULL v. SAN FRANCISCO 2281\ninmates” and “will lead to a higher incidence of illegal contra-\nband in the jails.” The snippet of quotation excerpted in the\ndissent, to the effect that the new policy “strikes the right bal-\nance between safety and the rights of inmates,” id., comes\nfrom a portion of the Dempsey affidavit dealing with a differ-\nent search policy that is not at issue in this appeal. The dissent\nis simply mistaken in suggesting that the interim intake policy\nworks as well as the challenged policy.\nI have a difficult time justifying this kind of judicial inter-\nference in what are quintessentially executive functions. In\nthe absence of guidance from the Supreme Court—which is\nentirely  absent—I  don’t  believe  we  have  the  authority  to\ncarve out sub-classes of individuals under the Fourth Amend-\nment who must be given preferred treatment by the govern-\nment. Indeed, the Court’s opinion in Bell v. Wolfish suggests\notherwise. See 441 U.S. at 558-60. Some prisoners pose a\nmuch lower risk of accepting contraband on contact visits,\nand some visitors are far less likely to bring contraband than\nothers.  But  nothing  in  Bell  suggests  that  Ivan  Boesky,\nMichael Milken or Martha Stewart must be treated better than\nother prisoners after a contact visit with their white-shoe law-\nyers. The possibility of these kinds of distinctions is markedly\nabsent from the Court’s discussion. \nThus, while I join Judge Ikuta’s excellent opinion in full,\nI concur on the separate ground that I do not believe we, as\ninferior federal judges, have the authority to grant plaintiffs\nthe relief they seek.\nGRABER, Circuit Judge, specially concurring:\nI concur specially in the result because, although I agree\nwith Parts I and II of the dissent, I part company with its con-\nclusion in Part III that the unconstitutionality of San Francis-\n\n2282 BULL v. SAN FRANCISCO\nco’s strip-search policy was clearly established at the time of\nthe events in question.\nThe most relevant Supreme Court case, Bell v. Wolfish, 441\nU.S. 520 (1979), approved an across-the-board policy to strip-\nsearch inmates following every contact visit with an outsider.\nBy definition, a newly arrested person, similarly, has just been\nan outsider.\nMoreover, as the dissent acknowledges, some categories of\npretrial detainees (such as those with a criminal record and\nthose arrested for violent offenses and drug offenses) do pose\na significant risk of bringing contraband into the jail. Those\ncategories of people may, constitutionally, be strip-searched\nbefore entering the general jail population. That procedure, in\nfact, protects people like the named plaintiffs who unwillingly\nfind themselves in the same facility as more dangerous detain-\nees.\nFinally, none of our prior cases was sufficiently similar to\nthis one to signal unequivocally that the San Francisco policy\nwas improper.\nAlthough  I  agree  fully  with  the  dissent’s  constitutional\nanalysis  and  with  the  distinctions  that  the  dissent  draws\nbetween Bell and this situation, I cannot say that the unconsti-\ntutionality of this policy was clearly established before Janu-\nary 2004.\nAccordingly, I concur in the result, but not the reasoning,\nof the majority opinion. \n\nBULL v. SAN FRANCISCO 2283\nVolume 2 of 2\n\nBULL v. SAN FRANCISCO 2285\nTHOMAS, Circuit Judge, with whom Judges WARDLAW,\nBERZON, and RAWLINSON, join, dissenting:\nMary Bull was arrested at a political protest for pouring red\ndye mixed with corn syrup on the ground. At the police sta-\ntion, according to her testimony, she was pushed to the floor\nand  her  clothes  forcibly  removed.  Her  face  was  smashed\nagainst the concrete cell floor while jailors performed a body\ncavity search. She was left naked in the cell for eleven hours,\nthen subjected to a second body cavity search. After another\ntwelve hours in the jail, she was released on her own recogni-\nzance. She was never charged with a crime. \nCharli Johnson was arrested for operating a motor vehicle\nwith a suspended license. She alleges she was forcibly strip\nsearched by male officers in a hallway, and that she was kept\nin a cold room, naked for twelve hours with male officers reg-\nularly  viewing  her.  No  contraband  was  found.  She  was\nreleased the next day. No charges were ever filed.\nSister Bernie Galvin, a Catholic nun and a member of the\nSisters of Divine Providence, was arrested at an anti-war dem-\nonstration for trespassing. She was strip searched at the jail.\nNo contraband was found. \nMichael Marron was arrested for alleged credit card fraud\nat the Hotel Nikko, strip searched, and allegedly beaten and\nleft naked in a cell for over ten hours. No contraband was\nfound. All charges were eventually dismissed.\nLaura  Timbrook,  who  was  arrested  for  bouncing  small\nchecks, was body cavity searched twice. No contraband was\nfound.  Deborah  Flick  alleges  she  was  arrested  for  public\nintoxication, forcibly strip searched and left naked and bleed-\ning in a cell overnight. Salome Mangosing, arrested for public\ndrunkenness, was strip searched and forced to remain naked\nfor  twelve  hours.  Again,  no  contraband  was  found.  Leigh\nFleming was arrested for disturbing the peace. She was body\n\n2286 BULL v. SAN FRANCISCO\ncavity searched and confined naked in a cold room for five\nhours. No contraband was found, and she was never charged\nwith a crime.1 \nNo officer testified that anyone suspected any of these indi-\nviduals were hiding contraband in body orifices and, to no\none’s surprise, no contraband was found. Rather, they were\nforcibly stripped and searched under a policy that mandated\nroutine  body  cavity  searches  of  everyone  arrested  in  San\nFrancisco classified for the general jail population, regardless\nof how petty the offense. \nIn holding that such searches were unconstitutional, the dis-\ntrict court faithfully applied a quarter century of Ninth Circuit\nlaw, which was consistent with the law of all but one of our\nsister  circuits.  Under  that  nearly  uniform  interpretation  of\nconstitutional law, a body cavity strip search of a detainee is\nonly justified by individualized reasonable suspicion that the\nsearch will bear fruit. If jailors have no reasonable suspicion,\nthe search must be categorically reasonable based on empiri-\ncal evidence that the policy is necessary. Jailors are entitled\n1These allegations, of course, remain to be proven at trial. That being\nsaid, many of the accounts of the searches are undisputed in the record,\nand there is no dispute about whether charges were filed or contraband\ndiscovered. The majority, while relying entirely on non-class data as the\nbasis of its argument, suggests that the plaintiffs are precluded from citing\nprobative evidence from non-class members. However, in analyzing a\ngrant of summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity, we con-\nstrue the entire factual record in the light most favorable to the non-\nmoving party in order to determine whether there has been a constitutional\nviolation. Brosseau v. Haugen, 543 U.S. 194, 197 (2004). This analysis\nincludes drawing all permissible inferences from the record in the light\nmost favorable to the non-moving party. Dias v. Elique, 436 F.3d 1125,\n1131 (9th Cir. 2006). The majority also suggests that these particular facts\ncannot be examined because the plaintiffs have asserted facial invalidity\nof the regulations. To be sure, a portion of the complaint, which is not at\nissue in the appeal, sought injunctive relief. However, the claims at issue\non this appeal are § 1983 damage claims challenging the constitutionality\nof the actual, not theoretical, searches. \n\nBULL v. SAN FRANCISCO 2287\nto strip search those whose arrest charges, criminal history,\nprobation status, or suspicious behavior create a reasonable\njustification for believing the person arrested might be con-\ncealing contraband in a body cavity. That interpretation was\nconsistent with the leading Supreme Court case on the topic,\nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979), which required\n“balancing of the need for the particular search against the\ninvasion of personal rights that the search entails.”\nThe majority sweeps away twenty-five years of jurispru-\ndence, giving jailors the unfettered right to conduct manda-\ntory,  routine,  suspicionless  body  cavity  searches  on  any\ncitizen who may be arrested for minor offenses, such as vio-\nlating a leash law or a traffic code, and who pose no credible\nrisk for smuggling contraband into the jail. Under its reconfig-\nured regime, the majority discards Bell’s requirement to bal-\nance  the  need  for  a  search  against  individual  privacy  and\ninstead blesses a uniform policy of performing body cavity\nsearches on everyone arrested and designated for the general\njail population, regardless of the triviality of the charge or the\nlikelihood that the arrestee is hiding contraband.\nThe  rationale  for  this  abrupt  precedential  departure  is\nfounded on quicksand. Indeed, the government’s entire argu-\nment is based on the logical fallacy cum hoc ergo propter hoc\n— happenstance implies causation. The government argues\nthat contraband has been found in the San Francisco jails.\nThus, the government reasons, individuals who are arrested\nmust be smuggling contraband into the jail. Therefore, the\ngovernment concludes it must body cavity search everyone\nwho is arrested, even those who pose no risk of concealing\ncontraband, much less of trying to smuggle contraband into\nthe jail. \nThis reasoning finds no support from the record in this\ncase. Although there is evidence of some arrestees attempting\nto conceal contraband during their arrest, there is not a single\ndocumented example of anyone doing so with the intent of\n\n2288 BULL v. SAN FRANCISCO\nsmuggling contraband into the jail. More importantly, for our\npurposes, there is not a single example of anyone from the\nclass defined by the district court who was found to possess\ncontraband upon being strip searched. Not one.\nIndeed, and ironically, the record shows that most of the\nindividual  plaintiffs  who  were  body  cavity  searched  were\nnever  actually  placed  in  the  general  jail  population  at  all.\nBecause they were never housed with other detainees, these\nindividuals posed absolutely no risk of “smuggling” contra-\nband into the general jail population. They were body cavity\nsearched  anyway,  simply  because  they  were  classified  for\npotential placement in the general jail population. \nMost of the individual plaintiffs were either never charged\nwith any crime, or had the charges dismissed. There is no evi-\ndence in the record of a successful prosecution against any of\nthe individual plaintiffs. \nThe district court carefully defined the class of plaintiffs,\nexcluding all those whose objective characteristics bestowed\nsufficient reasonable suspicion to justify a body cavity search.\nNot only is there not a single example of any class member\nsearched who possessed contraband, there is no statistical evi-\ndence in the record that the amount of contraband found in the\njails decreased during the period when all arrestees were body\ncavity searched. And what has happened to the amount of\ncontraband found inside cells since the jailors adopted a more\nconstitutionally  sound  approach?  The  government  cannot\nshow there has been any increase at all.\nEven though it has no record evidence to support its theory,\nthe government nevertheless presses us to abandon all consti-\ntutional protections and to bless mandatory routine body cav-\nity searches of those who, as a group, pose no reasonable risk\nof secreting contraband. All but one circuit has rejected this\napproach, with good reason. Suspicionless, routine, manda-\ntory strip search policies flatly contradict the balancing of\n\nBULL v. SAN FRANCISCO 2289\ninterests that the Supreme Court has instructed us to under-\ntake. And, as the record in this case and others demonstrates,\nsuch  policies  result  in  abusive,  unnecessary  body  cavity\nsearches of those who pose no security risk. This record pro-\nvides no evidentiary reason to justify the abandonment of our\nlong-standing constitutional precedent, and every reason to\nuphold it. I respectfully dissent.\nI\nUntil January 2004, San Francisco had a policy of strip\nsearching all pre-arraignment arrestees entering County Jail\nNo. 9 who fell into certain categories. Some arrestees were\nsearched because of the crime they were charged with or their\ncriminal histories; some were searched solely because they\nwere classified for housing in the general jail population. The\npolicy applied to all arrestees classified for housing in the\ngeneral  jail  population,  even  those  arrested  for  violating\nminor traffic laws — like failure to carry insurance or driving\nwith  a  suspended  license.  The  strip  search  procedure  was\ninvasive: it involved inspection of the naked body, including\nthe arrestee’s breasts, buttocks, and genitalia, as well as a\nvisual  inspection  of  the  arrestee’s  body  cavities.  In  2003,\nMary Bull and a class of similarly-situated plaintiffs brought\nsuit against the City for violations of their Fourth and Four-\nteenth Amendment rights.\nJudge Breyer, presiding over the district court, tailored the\nclass of plaintiffs extremely narrowly. In an order issued June\n10, 2004, the district court defined the class as:\nAll persons who, during the applicable period of lim-\nitations, and continuing to date, were arrested on any\ncharge  not  involving  weapons,  controlled  sub-\nstances,  or  a  felony  charge  of  violence,  and  not\ninvolving a violation of parole or a violation of pro-\nbation (where consent to search is a condition of\nsuch probation), and who were subjected to a blan-\n\n2290 BULL v. SAN FRANCISCO\nket  visual  body  cavity  strip  search  by  defendants\nbefore arraignment at a San Francisco County Jail\nfacility without any individualized reasonable suspi-\ncion  that  they  were  concealing  contraband.  This\nclass also includes 1) all arrestees who were sub-\njected to subsequent blanket strip search(es) before\narraignment after the initial strip search, without any\nreasonable  individualized  suspicion  that  they  had\nsubsequently  acquired  and  hidden  contraband  on\ntheir  persons;  and  2)  all  persons  who,  prior  to\narraignment, were subjected to blanket visual body\ncavity search(es) incident to placement in a “safety\ncell” at any of the San Francisco County Jails.\nBull  v.  City  and  County  of  San  Francisco,  No.  03-01840\n(N.D. Cal. June 10, 2004) (order denying preliminary injunc-\ntion). The class was further limited by the district court’s Feb-\nruary 23, 2006 order, which held that San Francisco’s policy\nof strip searching arrestees on the basis of their criminal his-\ntory was lawful. Bull v. City and County of San Francisco,\nNo. 03-01840 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 23, 2006) (amended order re\nmotions for summary judgment). The class before this Court\nare thus arrestees who were strip searched prior to arraign-\nment solely because they were classified for housing in the\ngeneral jail population and posed no other objective risk that\nthey would smuggle contraband.\nII\nSupreme Court precedent and common sense compel the\nconclusion  that  San  Francisco’s  mandatory,  routine,  suspi-\ncionless body cavity search policy violated the Constitution.\nA\nWe  begin  with  first  principles.  The  Fourth  Amendment\nrequires that we evaluate “a search or seizure in light of tradi-\ntional standards of reasonableness ‘by assessing, on the one\n\nBULL v. SAN FRANCISCO 2291\nhand, the degree to which it intrudes upon an individual’s pri-\nvacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed for the\npromotion of legitimate governmental interests.’ ” Virginia v.\nMoore, 553 U.S. ___, 128 S. Ct. 1598, 1604 (2008) (quoting\nWyoming v. Houghton, 526 U.S. 295, 300 (1999)). \nFourth Amendment inquiries are driven by the specific con-\ntext in which searches arise. Our “reasonableness” analysis is\nbound by the facts of the individual case before us. Scott v.\nHarris, 550 U.S. 372, 383 (2007) (describing the inquiry as\na “factbound morass”). The Supreme Court has long recog-\nnized that although the constitutional rights of prisoners and\narrestees  are  relaxed,  “[t]here  is  no  iron  curtain  drawn\nbetween the Constitution and the prisons of this country.”\nWolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 555-56 (1974); see also\nTurner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 84 (1987) (“Prison walls do not\nform a barrier separating prison inmates from the protections\nof the Constitution.”).\nSpecific security concerns affect the constitutionality of a\nsearch. Friedman v. Boucher, 580 F.3d 847, 857 (9th Cir.\n2009)  (“We  have  .  .  .  carefully  confined  administrative\nsearches at detention facilities to those reasonably related to\nsecurity concerns.”). Searches performed on arrestees that do\nnot contribute to prison security are unconstitutional. Id. at\n853-57 (holding unconstitutional a search to obtain a buccal\nswab from a detainee for the purpose of gathering information\nfor a DNA bank designed to solve cold cases).\nNot all searches are created equal. The Fourth Amendment\ndifferentiates between more and less intrusive searches, and\nrequires varying levels of need to justify different kinds of\nsearches. “[T]he scope of the particular intrusion, in light of\nall the exigencies of the case, [is] a central element in the\nanalysis of reasonableness.” Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 18\nn.15 (1968). Because the Fourth Amendment “requires a bal-\nancing of the need for the particular search against the inva-\nsion of personal rights that the search entails,” Bell, 441 U.S.\n\n2292 BULL v. SAN FRANCISCO\nat 559, the most invasive search is justified only by the most\ncompelling need. See Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723\nF.2d 1263, 1273 (7th Cir. 1983) (“The more intrusive the\nsearch,  the  closer  governmental  authorities  must  come  to\ndemonstrating probable cause for believing that the search\nwill uncover the objects for which the search is being con-\nducted.” (citing Terry, 392 U.S. at 18 n.15)).\nThe strip searches in this case are the most serious of per-\nsonal invasions. “The intrusiveness of a body-cavity search\ncannot  be  overstated.  Strip  searches  involving  the  visual\nexploration of body cavities [are] dehumanizing and humiliat-\ning.” Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Dep’t, 901 F.2d 702, 711\n(9th Cir. 1990), abrogated on other grounds by Hunter v. Bry-\nant, 502 U.S. 224 (1991) (per curiam); see also Bell, 441 U.S.\nat 576-77 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (“In my view, the body-\ncavity  searches  .  .  .  represent  one  of  the  most  grievous\noffenses  against  personal  dignity  and  common  decency.”).\nOnly  a  truly  compelling  need  justifies  such  an  invasive\nsearch.\nIn Bell, the Supreme Court case that governs our inquiry,\nthe  Court  considered  the  constitutionality  of  prison  strip\nsearches after contact visits. The policy in that case required\nall inmates in New York’s Bureau of Prisons facilities “to\nexpose their body cavities for visual inspection as a part of a\nstrip search conducted after every contact visit with a person\nfrom outside the institution.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 558; see also\nid. at 558 n.39 (describing the search procedure).\nAlthough the policy gave the Court “pause,” id. at 558, the\nCourt  ultimately  upheld  the  policy’s  constitutionality.  The\nCourt considered “whether visual body-cavity inspections as\ncontemplated by the [detention facility] rules can ever be con-\nducted on less than probable cause. Balancing the significant\nand legitimate security interests of the institution against the\nprivacy interests of the inmates, we conclude that they can.”\nId.  at  560.  The  Court  thus  set  the  justification  for  strip\n\nBULL v. SAN FRANCISCO 2293\nsearches at something less than probable cause, but declined\nto explicitly specify the level of suspicion.\nIn its analysis, the Court reiterated the case-by-case nature\nof Fourth Amendment inquiries: \nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amend-\nment is not capable of precise definition or mechani-\ncal application. In each case it requires a balancing\nof the need for the particular search against the inva-\nsion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts\nmust consider the scope of the particular intrusion,\nthe manner in which it is conducted, the justification\nfor initiating it, and the place in which it is con-\nducted.\nBell,  441  U.S.  at  559.  The  case-by-case,  search-by-search\nmethod described by this passage suggests that a mandatory,\nroutine, strip search policy, absent any individualized or cate-\ngorical suspicion, would be unconstitutional.\nIn Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614 (9th Cir. 1984) (per\ncuriam), overruled on other grounds by Hodgers-Durgin v. de\nla Vina, 199 F.3d 1037, 1040 n.1 (9th Cir. 1999) (en banc),\nwe interpreted Bell to require a prison administrator to have\nreasonable  suspicion  before  strip  searching  an  arrestee\ncharged with a minor offense. Id. at 617 (“[A]rrestees charged\nwith minor offenses may be subjected to a strip search only\nif jail officials possess a reasonable suspicion that the individ-\nual  arrestee  is  carrying  or  concealing  contraband.”).  In  so\nholding, we relied not only on the language in Bell but also\non the existing interpretations of other circuits. See, e.g., Mary\nBeth G., 723 F.2d at 1273 (“[E]nsuring the security needs of\nthe City by strip searching plaintiffs-appellees was unreason-\nable without a reasonable suspicion by the authorities that\neither of the twin dangers of concealing weapons or contra-\nband existed.”); Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007, 1013 (4th\nCir. 1981) (“An indiscriminate strip search policy routinely\n\n2294 BULL v. SAN FRANCISCO\napplied to detainees . . . cannot be constitutionally justified\nsimply on the basis of administrative ease in attending to\nsecurity considerations.”).\nWe’ve revisited Giles on a number of occasions, each time\nreaffirming the individualized reasonable suspicion standard.\nIn Ward v. County of San Diego, 791 F.2d 1329, 1331-33 (9th\nCir. 1986), cert. denied, 483 U.S. 1020 (1987), we held that\nabsent reasonable suspicion of possession of a weapon or con-\ntraband, a mandatory, routine, body cavity strip search policy\nof a misdemeanor arrestee prior to a determination regarding\nthe arrestee’s eligibility for an own recognizance release was\nunconstitutional. \nIn Thompson v. City of Los Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439 (9th\nCir. 1989), we held that the strip search of a person arrested\nfor felony grand theft auto was valid because the charge was\n“sufficiently associated with violence to justify a visual strip\nsearch,” but also noted that intermingling with the general jail\npopulation by itself did not justify the search. Id. at 1447. \nThe next year, we held unconstitutional the City of Los\nAngeles’s mandatory, routine, strip search policy that sub-\njected all felony arrestees to a visual body cavity search. Ken-\nnedy, 901 F.2d at 713-14 (holding that the mere fact of a\nfelony charge bears no reasonable relationship to institutional\nsecurity concerns). \nWe reaffirmed our holding in Giles as recently as 2006.\nWay v. County of Ventura, 445 F.3d 1157, 1161 (9th Cir.\n2006), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1052 (2006) (recognizing “the\ndifficulty of operating a detention facility safely, the serious-\nness of the risk of smuggled weapons and contraband, and the\ndeference  we  owe  jail  officials’  exercise  of  judgment  in\nadopting and executing policies necessary to maintain institu-\ntional security,” but concluding that “a blanket policy is [not]\n\nBULL v. SAN FRANCISCO 2295\nconstitutionally acceptable simply by virtue of jail officials’\ninvocation of security concerns”).2\nThe overwhelming majority of circuits believe that Bell\nmandates a reasonable suspicion standard. However, even if\nwe assume that it does not, Bell at the very least mandates a\nfactbound, data-driven inquiry into the categorical reasonable-\nness of the search.3 Categorical reasonableness must rely on\nsituational suspicion. It is informed by the probability that the\nsearch will bear fruit. See Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238\n(1983) (noting that only “a fair probability that contraband or\nevidence of a crime will be found in a particular place” justi-\nfies the need for a search).\n2The Supreme Court, in a slightly different context, recently reaffirmed\nthe idea that a strip search policy violates the Fourth Amendment when\nthere is little evidence that the searches will result in the discovery of con-\ntraband. In Safford Unified Sch. Dist. #1 v. Redding, 129 S. Ct. 2633\n(2009), the Court held that a strip search of a schoolgirl was unconstitu-\ntional in part because the school could not show any evidence that the\nsearch would bear fruit. See id. at 2642 (holding that “the content of the\nsuspicion” must match “the degree of intrusion” and that “the categori-\ncally extreme intrusiveness of a search” requires “some justification in\nsuspected facts” beyond “general background possibilities”); id. at 2642-\n43 (“[W]hat was missing from the suspected facts . . . was any indication\nof danger to the students . . . and any reason to suppose that [the searchee]\nwas carrying pills in her underwear. We think that the combination of\nthese deficiencies was fatal to finding the search reasonable.”). \n3The categorical approach of strip searching everyone that the majority\nproposes is novel in practice. No other circuit has employed such an\napproach. The only circuit to mention a similar categorical approach is the\nFifth, which explicitly rejected it as a broad brush technique for avoiding\nthe reasonable suspicion requirement. See Stewart v. Lubbock County, 767\nF.2d  153,  156-57  (5th  Cir.  1985)  (“Because  Lubbock  County’s  strip\nsearch policy was applied to minor offenders awaiting bond when no rea-\nsonable suspicion existed that they as a category of offenders or individu-\nally might possess weapons or contraband, under the balancing test of\nWolfish we find such searches unreasonable and the policy to be in viola-\ntion of the Fourth Amendment.” (emphasis added)). For any categorical\napproach to strip search policy to adhere to the Constitution, it must be\nnarrowly tailored and grounded in empirical evidence that the policy is\nnecessary as applied to the category of detainees in question. \n\n2296 BULL v. SAN FRANCISCO\nThe district court clearly understood and applied this long\nstanding precedent. As Judge Breyer put it:\nThe indignity of the strip search is great. And is not\na minor or incidental humiliation. It’s a serious intru-\nsion [on] a person’s personal right to privacy, in my\nview. And I don’t think there’s a large amount of\nargument over that point.\nTherefore, there has to be a countervailing safety\nconcern that would warrant that type of intrusion.\nThat is what this is about. It is not any more compli-\ncated than that, I think.\nThe district court understood that, under Bell and our prece-\ndent, strip searches must be justified by individualized reason-\nable  suspicion  or  categorical  reasonableness  based  on\nempirical evidence that the policy is necessary. On a careful\napplication  of  precedent  as  to  those  arrested  for  minor\noffenses, the district court concluded that San Francisco’s pol-\nicy could not be justified by either reasonable suspicion or\ncategorical reasonableness. The district court was entirely cor-\nrect.\nB\nThe majority suggests that Turner might apply as well to\nsupplant the traditional Bell analysis. Turner considered the\nconstitutionality of restrictions on inmate marriage and corre-\nspondence. In so doing, Turner set a new standard—one more\ndeferential to prison administrators than the standard set by\nBell—by which to judge prison regulations that impinge on\ninmates’ constitutional rights. See Turner, 482 U.S. at 89-91.\nTurner never overturned Bell, however, and Bell directly con-\ntrols here. Thus, it is Bell’s standard that we must apply, not\nTurner’s. See Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/Am. Express,\nInc., 490 U.S. 477, 484 (1989) (“If a precedent of this Court\nhas direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons\n\nBULL v. SAN FRANCISCO 2297\nrejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of Appeals\nshould follow the case which directly controls, leaving to this\nCourt the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.”); Pow-\nell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298, 1302 (11th Cir. 2008) (en banc)\n(declining  to  apply  the  Turner  standard  and  stating  that\n“[u]ntil the Supreme Court tells us that the Bell approach no\nlonger applies where that Court applied it, we are inclined to\ncontinue using it”); Watt v. City of Richardson Police Dep’t,\n849 F.2d 195, 196 (5th Cir. 1988) (“Analysis of the city’s\nstrip search policy and of the actual search conducted on Watt\nbegins, and practically ends, with the Supreme Court’s deci-\nsion in Bell.”).\nFurther, the underpinnings of Turner are significantly dif-\nferent from those considered in Bell. Turner involved incar-\nceration of convicted criminals. Thus, the test developed in\nTurner  involved  the  application  of  “legitimate  penological\ninterests.” 482 U.S. at 89. “Penological interests are interests\nthat relate to the treatment (including punishment, deterrence,\nrehabilitation, etc.) of persons convicted of crimes.” Benjamin\nv. Fraser, 264 F.3d 175, 187 n.10 (2d Cir. 2001). “ ‘Penologi-\ncal’ means relating to the theory and practice of prison man-\nagement and criminal rehabilitation.” Mauro v. Arpaio, 188\nF.3d 1054, 1068 (9th Cir. 1999) (en banc) (Kleinfeld, J., dis-\nsenting).  “The  word  is  derived  from  the  Greek  and  Latin\nwords  meaning  penalty  or  punishment,  and  still  means\nroughly  the  same  thing.”  Id.  Penological  considerations—\npunishment, deterrence, rehabilitation—have no relevance to\ndetainees who have not been convicted of any crime. These\ndetainees  still  enjoy  the  presumption  of  innocence.  To  be\nsure, management of jails (which may house both pretrial\ndetainees and convicts) and prisons (which house convicts)\nshare  many  common  management  considerations,  but  the\nanalysis of the rights of pre-trial detainees and convicts must\ndiffer because penological interests do not apply to pre-trial\ndetainees. Thus, the “balancing of the need for the particular\nsearch against the invasion of personal rights that the search\nentails,” Bell, 441 U.S. at 559, in the pre-trial detainee context\n\n2298 BULL v. SAN FRANCISCO\nis quite different from the analysis of whether a particular\nprison  regulation  that  impinges  on  inmates’  constitutional\nrights is “reasonably related to legitimate penological inter-\nests.” Turner, 482 U.S. at 89. The distinctions between the\nBell and Turner analyses are particularly important in this\ncontext, which involves some detainees who were never even\ncharged with a crime. The Supreme Court has never conflated\nthe analyses of Bell and Turner. Neither have we in a case\ninvolving a pre-trial detainee.4 Bell governs our inquiry here.\nC\nBecause the Fourth Amendment reasonableness inquiry is\nfactbound, we must consider whether the specific facts of this\ncase justify San Francisco’s blanket strip search policy. View-\ning the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs—as\nwe must on summary judgment for qualified immunity, Olsen\nv. Idaho State Bd. of Med., 363 F.3d 916, 922 (9th Cir. 2004)\n—the facts fail to justify the policy.\nSan Francisco could have satisfied the standard set out in\nBell had it been able to either produce reasonable suspicion\nfor its searches or justify its policy categorically by presenting\nspecific evidence of smuggling among the class of plaintiffs\nin this case. The challenged portion of San Francisco’s policy\ndid  not  consider  such  individualized  factors  and  instead\nrequired strip searches of arrestees based solely on their clas-\nsification for housing in the general population. Thus, San\n4The majority cites Ninth Circuit cases for the proposition that the Tur-\nner standard already has been incorporated into Bell cases: Thompson v.\nSouza, 111 F.3d 694, 699-700 (9th Cir. 1997); and Michenfelder v. Sum-\nner, 860 F.2d 328, 332-33 (9th Cir. 1988). Both are distinguishable. Both\nThompson and Michenfelder involve claims brought by prisoners already\nserving sentences, and Michenfelder was in a maximum security unit.\nConsequently, these cases actually involve legitimate penological inter-\nests, and therefore Turner. They do not provide any support for applying\nTurner’s rationale to cases involving pre-trial detainees in the circum-\nstance described in Bell and the instant case. \n\nBULL v. SAN FRANCISCO 2299\nFrancisco was required to demonstrate at least categorical rea-\nsonableness.\nThe  City’s  burden  was  not  great:  the  district  court  had\nalready done much of the City’s work by excluding most\narrestees from the class. In essence, the district court found,\nas a matter of law, that the City satisfied Bell’s reasonableness\nrequirement for all detainees arrested on weapons, violence,\nor controlled substance charges or for violation of parole or\nprobation, or who have a criminal history. The small set of\nplaintiffs that the district court allowed to proceed were only\nthose whose backgrounds did not give rise to the categorical\nsuspicion necessary to justify a strip search. It was thus the\nCity’s burden to prove that the narrow class of plaintiffs war-\nranted strip searching. \nSan Francisco could not meet its burden. Of all the inci-\ndents of discovered contraband documented by Defendants\nand presented to the district court, not one documents a single\nuncontroverted instance of a class member possessing contra-\nband when arrested and searched. In some instances where\ncontraband was found, charging documents are missing and\nwe are unable to determine whether the arrestee would have\nqualified as a member of the class. In other instances, the\ncriminal history of the arrestee is missing, again making it\nimpossible to determine whether the arrestee could be a class\nmember. As an appellate court, “[i]n general, we consider\nonly the record that was before the district court.” United\nStates v. W. R. Grace, 504 F.3d 745, 766 (9th Cir. 2007).\nAbsent more information, the record provides no evidence\nthat anyone who would qualify for membership in the certi-\nfied  class  possessed  concealed  contraband.  That  result  is\nunsurprising. People with no criminal history who violate dog\nleash or mandatory insurance laws, as a class, pose fewer\nsecurity risks than those arrested for acts of violence or drug\noffenses. \nGiven this lack of evidence, one might wonder why the\nCity is pressing its argument so strongly. After all, it has\n\n2300 BULL v. SAN FRANCISCO\nchanged  its  policy  to  conform  to  the  Constitution.  It  now\nrequires individualized suspicion based on objective factors\nbefore body cavity searching an arrestee. According to the\naffidavits filed by the government, the new policy works well\nand “strikes the right balance between safety and the rights of\ninmates.” Nothing in the record suggests a sudden surge of\ncontraband accompanying the policy change. \nThe real answer lies in the government’s affidavits. In the\ntestimony submitted by the government, officials complain\nthat it is administratively inconvenient to comply with the\nConstitution: that it requires additional training for its officers\nand that it could save time if it did not have to conduct indi-\nvidualized assessments. Indeed, the large record in this case\nshows beyond a doubt that administrative inconvenience is\nSan  Francisco’s  sole  justification  for  strip  searching  class\nmembers. But mere bureaucratic discomfort does not justify\nconstitutional violations, and the Supreme Court has repeat-\nedly told us so. See Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677,\n690 (1973) (“[A]lthough efficacious administration of govern-\nmental programs is not without some importance, ‘the Consti-\ntution recognizes higher values than speed and efficiency.’ ”\n(quoting  Stanley  v.  Illinois,  405  U.S.  645,  656  (1972)));\nUnited States v. U.S. Dist. Court, 407 U.S. 297, 321 (1972)\n(“Although  some  added  burden  will  be  imposed  upon  the\nAttorney  General,  this  inconvenience  is  justified  in  a  free\nsociety to protect constitutional values.”). Further, the record\nshows  that  the  administrative  inconveniences  of  the  new\npolicy—requiring an official to have individualized suspicion\nbefore inspecting an arrestee’s body cavities—did not pose a\nparticularly heavy burden. \nBecause there is absolutely no evidence that contraband\nwas smuggled into the prison by eligible class members, San\nFrancisco had no reason—categorical or otherwise—to sus-\npect that arrestees falling into the class of plaintiffs certified\nin this case were smuggling contraband. Thus, San Francis-\n\nBULL v. SAN FRANCISCO 2301\nco’s strip search policy was unreasonable and violates the\nFourth Amendment. \nThis conclusion is consistent with the Court’s decision in\nBell.  In  Bell,  the  strip  search  policy  was  constitutional\nbecause the Supreme Court had before it both a record of\nsmuggling and a categorically reasonable justification for the\npolicy. First, the Court had before it a record showing that\ninmates often attempted to smuggle contraband into prisons\nafter contact visits. Although “petitioners proved only one\ninstance in the [prison facility’s] short history where contra-\nband was found during a body-cavity search,” Bell, 441 U.S.\nat 558, “inmate attempts to secrete these items into the facility\nby concealing them in body cavities are documented in this\nrecord and in other cases,” id. at 559 (internal record citation\nomitted). Here, not even that showing could be made. There\nis simply no evidence that detainees falling into the extremely\nnarrow class of plaintiffs certified by Judge Breyer attempted\nto smuggle contraband. Nor, for that matter, is there any evi-\ndence at all of any attempts by anyone to smuggle contraband\nvia arrest. Certainly, concealed contraband was discovered\nduring strip-searches of non-class members; however, nothing\nin the record indicates that these incidents involved anything\nmore than an arrestee attempting to conceal possessed contra-\nband upon arrest.\nSecond, contact visits are planned. As a matter of common\nsense, contact visits are far more likely to lead to smuggling\nthan initial arrests. Indeed, contrary to the evidence in this\ncase, the record in other cases has shown that “despite thor-\nough searches, contact visits result in the smuggling of contra-\nband, particularly drugs.” Toussaint v. McCarthy, 801 F.2d\n1080,  1114  (9th  Cir.  1986),  abrogated  in  part  on  other\ngrounds  by  Sandin  v.  Connor,  515  U.S.  472  (1995).  The\nrecord in this case supports the conclusion that contraband\nfinds its way into the City’s jails through means other than\nsmuggling during arrest. The City has documented the pres-\nence of contraband in its cells. However, of approximately\n\n2302 BULL v. SAN FRANCISCO\n150,000 searches over a three-year period in the intake facil-\nity, the City could only produce evidence to the district court\nof 78 incidents where contraband was discovered during an\nintake strip search. None of those, of course, involved class\nmembers. \nAbsent individualized reasonable suspicion or any evidence\nat all that the class of plaintiffs here presented a risk of smug-\ngling, the City is left to speculate that detainees are attempting\nto smuggle contraband into detention centers by concealing\ncontraband during arrest. Indeed, the City has suggested that\nsome detainees get arrested just to smuggle contraband into\nprisons. There is not even anecdotal support for this notion,\nwhich  is  impermissibly  founded  only  “on  the  gossamer\nthreads  of  whimsey,  speculation  and  conjecture.”  Hahn  v.\nSargent, 523 F.2d 461, 467 (1st Cir. 1975) (quoting Manga-\nnaro v. Delaval Separator Co., 309 F.2d 389, 393 (1st Cir.\n1962)). There is just no evidence at all in the record that class\nmembers pose any risk to the security of San Francisco jails.\nWe are asked to ignore this stark record on the theory that\nwe  ought  always  defer  to  jailors  on  matters  of  security,\nwhether or not the government can make a plausible showing\nthat a security risk exists at all. Of course, deference to prison\nadministrators is instrumental in maintaining prison security.\nSee Bell, 441 U.S. at 547. Such deference is ingrained into our\nsystem of judicial review. See generally Pell v. Procunier,\n417 U.S. 817, 827 (1974). However, “blind deference to cor-\nrectional officials does no real service to them.” Wolff, 418\nU.S. at 588 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (quoting Palmigiano v.\nBaxter, 487 F.2d 1280, 1283 (1st Cir. 1973)). The Supreme\nCourt has instructed that deference has its limits. A policy of\njudicial restraint cannot encompass any failure to take cogni-\nzance of valid constitutional claims whether arising in a fed-\neral  or  state  institution.  “[I]f  the  prison  authorities  do  not\nconform to constitutional minima, the courts are under an\nobligation to take steps to remedy the violations.” Rhodes v.\n\nBULL v. SAN FRANCISCO 2303\nChapman, 452 U.S. 337, 362 (1981) (Brennan, J., concur-\nring). Our deference reaches its limits here.\nD\nThe realities of the constitutional issues here at stake are far\nfrom trivial. The Seventh Circuit has described strip searches\nas “demeaning,” “dehumanizing,” and “repulsive.” Mary Beth\nG., 723 F.2d at 1272. The Tenth Circuit has called them “ter-\nrifying.” Chapman v. Nichols, 989 F.2d 393, 396 (10th Cir.\n1993).  The  Eighth  Circuit  has  called  them  “humiliating.”\nHunter v. Auger, 672 F.2d 668, 674 (8th Cir. 1982). \nMany  reports  document  the  unfortunate  connection\nbetween  strip  searches  and  sexual  abuse  of  prisoners.  See\nCheryl Bell et al., Rape and Sexual Misconduct in the Prison\nSystem: Analyzing America’s Most “Open” Secret, 18 YALE\nL. & POL’Y REV. 195, 203 (1999) (“Female inmates have also\nreported that guards improperly touch them while performing\nbody searches.”).5\nOne need only look to the record before us to find troubling\ninstances of abuse during the strip search process. The named\nplaintiff,  Mary  Bull,  was  arrested  for  vandalism  during  a\npolitical protest. She claims that after she declined to consent\nto a body cavity search, she was told that unless she con-\nsented, she would be forcibly strip searched. She alleges that\nan officer told her that if she did not consent, she would be\n“thrown into a cold room, naked, for 24 hours.” She declined\nto consent, and describes what happened next: \nI was then forcibly strip searched in an area visible\n5See also Amnesty International, “Not part of my sentence”: Violations\nof the Human Rights of Women in Custody, http://www.amnestyusa.org/\ndocument.php?id=D0F5C2222D1AABEA8025690000692FC4&lang=e\n(last visited October 1, 2009) (detailing instances of sexual abuse occur-\nring during strip searches). \n\n2304 BULL v. SAN FRANCISCO\nto persons not participating, my clothes were pulled\noff, my legs were thrown into a squatting position\nwhile I was lying on the floor in front of male offi-\ncers. My genital and rectal areas were inspected.\nDuring the search, Bull’s “face was smashed against the con-\ncrete” by the prison officials. She was then left naked in a\ncold room for twelve hours. In the morning, she was removed\nfrom the cell and again informed that she was required to con-\nsent to a strip search. She declined. She was forcibly strip\nsearched  again,  and  again  left  naked  in  a  cold  room  for\nanother  twelve  hours.  She  was  then  released  on  her  own\nrecognizance. She has never been charged with any offense.6\nSalome  Mangosing,  arrested  for  public  drunkenness,\n6The majority characterizes the lead plaintiff Bull’s complaint solely as\na challenge to the jail’s safety cell policy. The objection of the majority\nto a reference to a plaintiff who also challenges the safety cell policy is\nsomewhat puzzling, given that the majority’s entire argument rests on the\ncontraband found during strip searches of out-of-class members. Never-\ntheless, Bull’s actual allegations are much broader than a challenge to the\nsafety cell policy. She was placed in a safety cell for a portion of her incar-\nceration, and the district court denied her summary judgment because of\ngenuine issues of material fact concerning the particular circumstances of\nher search. However, the reason Bull was placed in a safety cell was\nbecause she refused to consent to be strip searched. At that time, all\narrestees were asked to sign a form consenting to a strip search. However,\nif the detained person declined to sign it, he or she was strip searched any-\nway. According to an officer involved in Bull’s detention, refusal to sign\na consent form constituted “bizarre” behavior fitting the criterion of place-\nment in a safety cell because “it impeded the intake process.” In her affi-\ndavit, Bull claims that an officer told her that if she did not submit to a\nbody cavity search she “would be thrown into a cold room, naked, for 24\nhours.” Bull did not consent and was forcibly strip-searched in the safety\ncell. She testified that she was left in the cell, naked, overnight. In the\nmorning, she was removed from her cell and informed that she had to con-\nsent to a second body cavity search. She objected, and was forcibly body-\ncavity searched a second time. She testified that she was again left naked\nin a cell, but later assigned to a room with eight bunk beds, where she\nstayed until her release. \n\nBULL v. SAN FRANCISCO 2305\nalleges that she was kicked repeatedly during her search while\nshe lay prostrate on the ground. According to Mangosing, one\nprison official placed her foot on Mangosing’s neck while\nanother  twisted  her  arm  behind  her  back.  Mangosing  was\nforced to remain naked for twelve hours. \nMichael Marron, who was arrested for alleged credit card\nfraud at a local hotel, was strip searched, and allegedly beaten\nand left naked in a cell for over ten hours. Michele De Ran-\nleau who was arrested for illegal lodging, allegedly was strip\nsearched twice, and left in a cell naked for twelve hours. All\ncharges were dropped. \nLaura  Timbrook  was  arrested  for  writing  checks  on  an\naccount  with  insufficient  funds  and  body  cavity  searched\ntwice.  Deborah  Flick  alleges  she  was  arrested  for  public\nintoxication, forcibly strip searched and left naked and bleed-\ning  in  a  cell  overnight.  The  record  contains  other  similar\nexamples. Many of the persons who testified to this treatment\nwere never charged with any crime and never actually housed\nin the general jail population.\nThat  abuse  often  accompanies  mandatory  body  cavity\nsearches should not surprise us. Body cavity searches dehu-\nmanize those who are subject to them, and those performing\nroutine searches in volume become desensitized to the inva-\nsion of body privacy. Enforcing the minimal constitutional\nright of individualized consideration of risk forces officers to\nview  those  arrested  as  individual  humans,  rather  than  as\nbooking-numbered objects to be processed.7 \nA  policy  that  so  severely  erodes  human  dignity  and\nintrudes upon constitutional rights requires strong justifica-\ntion. We have, in the past, afforded proper deference when\n7See generally PHILIP ZIMBARDO, THE LUCIFER EFFECT: UNDERSTANDING\nHOW GOOD PEOPLE TURN EVIL (2007) (describing the effect of the Stanford\nprison experiments on guard and inmate interaction). \n\n2306 BULL v. SAN FRANCISCO\npresented with evidence of legitimate security concerns. How-\never, San Francisco not only fails to offer any evidence that\narrestees belonging to the class of plaintiffs smuggled contra-\nband into the jail, it does not even offer a plausible, hypotheti-\ncal justification for its policy, aside from minor bureaucratic\ninconvenience. Proper deference cannot be founded on a com-\nplete absence of proof. Judicial review cannot be halted when\nthe  government’s  rationale  is  simply  “because  I  said  so.”\nUnder proper, deferential judicial review, San Francisco’s for-\nmer mandatory body cavity search policy cannot pass consti-\ntutional muster.\nE\nConcluding that the policy at issue violates the arrestees’\nFourth Amendment rights falls squarely in line with the law\nof the vast majority of our sister circuits. In justifying the strip\nsearch  policy,  the  majority  overrules  two  bedrock  Fourth\nAmendment cases: Giles v. Ackerman and Thompson v. City\nof Los Angeles. These cases are not just widely-cited by our\ncircuit, they are accepted throughout the circuits. The majority\nexiles us from the legal mainstream. \nThe circuits are near-unanimous in rejecting the majority’s\ncontention  that  Bell  eliminated  the  reasonable  suspicion\nrequirement for conducting a strip search. The Second Circuit,\nfor  example,  in  holding  a  policy  of  strip  searching  all\narrestees unconstitutional, determined that Bell “did not . . .\nread out of the Constitution the provision of general applica-\ntion that a search be justified as reasonable under the circum-\nstances. The imposition of a standard short of probable cause\nin determining the balance of interests at stake in [Bell] in no\nway dispensed with that requirement.” Weber v. Dell, 804\nF.2d 796, 800 (2d Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 483 U.S. 1020\n(1987). \nThe First Circuit has also found that Bell did not eliminate\nthe reasonable suspicion requirement. Swain v. Spinney, 117\n\nBULL v. SAN FRANCISCO 2307\nF.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1997). The Swain court found unconstitu-\ntional a strip search of a woman arrested on suspicion of theft\nand possession of marijuana. The court held that “it is clear\nthat at least the reasonable suspicion standard governs strip\nand visual body cavity searches in the arrestee context” and\nthat “courts have concluded that, to be reasonable under Wolf-\nish, strip and visual body cavity searches must be justified by\nat least a reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is concealing\ncontraband  or  weapons.”  Id.;  see  also  Wood  v.  Hancock\nCounty Sheriff’s Dep’t, 354 F.3d 57, 62 (1st Cir. 2003) (“Our\ncase law holds that an individual detained on a misdemeanor\ncharge may be strip searched as part of the booking process\nonly if officers have reasonable suspicion that he is either\narmed  or  carrying  contraband.”).  Notably,  the  arrestee  in\nSwain would not have been eligible for class membership in\nthe case before us because she was arrested for possession of\na controlled substance.\nOther circuits have similarly found policies like the one\nbefore us unconstitutional. See Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d\n1248, 1253-54 (6th Cir. 1989) (“Bell v. Wolfish does not vali-\ndate a blanket policy of strip searching pretrial detainees. Bell\nv. Wolfish authorizes particularized searches where objective\ncircumstances indicate such searches are needed to maintain\ninstitutional security.”), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 977 (1989);\nJones v. Edwards, 770 F.2d 739, 740, 742 (8th Cir. 1985)\n(holding  unconstitutional  the  strip  search  of  a  detainee\narrested for allowing his dog to run wild and stating that “se-\ncurity cannot justify the blanket deprivation of rights of the\nkind incurred here”); Stewart v. Lubbock County, 767 F.2d\n153,  156  (5th  Cir.  1985)  (holding  unconstitutional  under\nBell’s balancing test a strip search policy applied to minor\noffenders “when no reasonable suspicion existed that they as\na category of offenders or individually might possess weapons\nor contraband”), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1066 (1986); Hill v.\nBogans, 735 F.2d 391, 394 (10th Cir. 1984) (holding that\nintermingling  with  prison  population  absent  any  circum-\nstances or prior offenses suggesting the possibility of conceal-\n\n2308 BULL v. SAN FRANCISCO\ning weapons or contraband was insufficient to warrant a strip\nsearch); Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007, 1013 (4th Cir. 1981)\n(“An indiscriminate strip search policy routinely applied to\ndetainees such as Logan along with all other detainees cannot\nbe constitutionally justified simply on the basis of administra-\ntive  ease  in  attending  to  security  considerations.”),  cert.\ndenied, 455 U.S. 942 (1982).\nThe majority cites with approval the recent Eleventh Cir-\ncuit case Powell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298 (11th Cir. 2008)\n(en banc). Powell is alone among the circuits. Id. at 1315-16\n(Barkett,  J.,  dissenting)  (“For  almost  thirty  years,  circuit\ncourts have followed the Bell Court’s instructions and, until\ntoday, universally held that reasonable suspicion is necessary\nto constitutionally justify the types of searches before us.”).\nPowell is also inapposite because the policy in that case man-\ndated searches far less intrusive than the ones here. Under the\npolicy in Powell, arrestees were required to undress and pro-\nceed to a large room with thirty to forty other arrestees to\nshower. After showering, the arrestees were “inspected” front\nand back by deputies. Id. at 1301. The policy did not mandate\nthe far more degrading and invasive body cavity searches\nrequired by the San Francisco policy. As we have seen, the\nFourth Amendment requires a “balancing of the need for the\nparticular search against the invasion of personal rights that\nthe search entails.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 559. The searches in\nPowell were far less intrusive than the searches here, requir-\ning less justification for those searches. If Powell has any per-\nsuasive power, it is that the justification for the body cavity\nsearches in the case before us must be much more compelling\nthan the justification for the tamer searches in Powell.\nThe  above-described  opinions  from  the  First,  Second,\nFourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits—and the fact\nthat for twenty-eight years the Supreme Court has repeatedly\ndeclined to comment—clearly show that the majority’s inter-\npretation of Bell falls far outside the existing jurisprudence.\n\nBULL v. SAN FRANCISCO 2309\nThe conclusion is clear: the City’s policy of routine, man-\ndatory, suspicionless body cavity searches of those arrested\nfor minor offenses who pose no credible risk of concealing\ncontraband is unconstitutional.\nIII\nIn a qualified immunity analysis, we must also consider\nwhether the constitutional right violated by Defendants was\nclearly established at the time of the search. See Pearson v.\nCallahan, 129 S. Ct. 808, 816 (2009); Saucier v. Katz, 533\nU.S. 194, 201 (2001). “The relevant, dispositive inquiry in\ndetermining whether a right is clearly established is whether\nit would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was\nunlawful in the situation he confronted.” Saucier, 533 U.S. at\n202. The key inquiry is whether a reasonable person could\nhave  believed  his  actions  lawful  at  the  time  they  were\nundertaken. Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 646 (1987).\nThe City’s challenged strip search policy was in place until\nJanuary 2004. It was clearly established by that time that con-\nducting  strip  searches  of  pre-arraignment  arrestees  based\nsolely on the fact that they were assigned for transfer to the\ngeneral jail population was unconstitutional. We have consis-\ntently required consideration of individual factors, such as\narrest charges, criminal history, and suspicious behavior, to\njustify strip searches of pre-arraignment arrestees. As the dis-\ntrict court in this case rightly observed: “It was . . . abundantly\nclear after Thompson that placement in the general jail popu-\nlation cannot [sic] ‘by itself cannot justify a strip search.’ ”\nBull v. City & County of San Francisco, No. 03-01840, 2006\nWL 449148, at *16 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 23, 2006).\nMoreover, we have explicitly held several times that it was\nclearly established that strip search policies similar to San\nFrancisco’s are unconstitutional. In Ward, we concluded that\n“the law was sufficiently clear in early 1981 so as to expose\na public official who unreasonably authorized blanket strip\n\n2310 BULL v. SAN FRANCISCO\nsearches of minor offense arrestees to civil liability under 42\nU.S.C. § 1983.” Ward, 791 F.2d at 1332 (emphasis added).\nAlthough San Francisco’s policy included arrestees charged\nwith more serious offenses than those at issue in Ward, San\nFrancisco’s policy also applied to minor offense arrestees,\nsuch as those at issue in Ward. See also Act Up!/Portland v.\nBagley, 988 F.2d 868, 871-72 (9th Cir. 1993) (noting that by\n1989, it was clearly established that it was unconstitutional to\nstrip search a detainee arrested for a minor offense without\nreasonable suspicion that the individual arrestee was carrying\nor concealing contraband; reasonable suspicion was based on\nfactors such as the nature of the offense, the arrestee’s appear-\nance and conduct, and the prior arrest record).\nDefendants argue that the large amount of documentary\nevidence  they  have  produced  distinguishes  this  case  from\nother strip search cases. Because no other case confronted\nsuch a well-documented problem, Defendants contend, the\nlaw was not clearly established. However, the specific facts of\nprevious cases need not be materially or fundamentally simi-\nlar to the situation in question; rather, the salient question is\nwhether the state of the law at the time gives officials fair\nwarning that their conduct is unconstitutional. See Hope v.\nPelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 742 (2002).\nThe  fact  that  San  Francisco  documented  a  contraband\nsmuggling problem does not muddy the clarity of the law.\nThe evidence Defendants produced to the district court shows\nonly that contraband was a significant problem in San Fran-\ncisco jails generally; it does not demonstrate that persons eli-\ngible  for  inclusion  in  this  class  of  plaintiffs  contributed\nsignificantly, or even at all, to that problem. Therefore, San\nFrancisco’s policy is not different enough from policies that\nwe have held unconstitutional to suggest that the rights vio-\nlated by the policy were not clearly established.8 Sheriff Hen-\nnessey is not entitled to qualified immunity.\n8That the majority overturns two seminal strip search cases Giles and\nThompson—is further evidence that, at the time of the strip search policy,\nthe rights violated by the policy were clearly established. \n\nBULL v. SAN FRANCISCO 2311\nIV\nFor decades, we have followed Supreme Court precedent\nand required that body cavity strip searches of arrestees be\nbased on reasonable suspicion, created either by individual\ncircumstances  or  reasonable  objective  factors.  Today,  we\ndepart from that commonsense approach and sanctify routine,\nmandatory, indiscriminate, suspicionless body cavity searches\nfor anyone arrested and classified to the general jail popula-\ntion, regardless of how petty the offense. The record in this\ncase does not support this abrupt divergence from established\nlaw. Indeed, the only conclusion this record supports is that\npersons with no criminal history arrested for trivial offenses\npose no credible risk of smuggling contraband into jails. The\nreinstallation  of  a  more  constitutionally  sound  policy  has,\naccording to government filings, worked well and has struck\n“the right balance between safety and the rights of inmates.”\nOur longstanding precedent also struck the right balance. It\nallowed strip searches of those whose arrest charges, criminal\nhistory, probation status, or suspicious behavior would create\na  reasonable  justification  for  believing  the  person  arrested\nmight be concealing contraband in a body cavity. It precluded\njailors from strip searching those who posed no credible risk\nof  secreting  contraband.  Rather  than  bringing  competing\ninterests into equilibrium, today’s decision removes the bal-\nancing scales altogether — to the detriment of constitutional\nrights and human dignity. \nNor should we take solace in the fact that every person is\nsubject to a humiliating strip search, whether it be Sister Ber-\nnie Galvin, an honored long time community advocate for the\npoor who was arrested at an anti-war rally, or a pusher armed\nwith weapons and caught in a crack house. Our constitutional\noath requires us to do justice—not injustice—without respect\nto  persons.  Invading  the  rights  of  everyone,  regardless  of\nwhether we have reason to suspect them or not, should give\nno one illusory comfort that we are providing justice for all.\nI respectfully dissent.

Board of Chosen Freeholders of County of Burlington, et al.  On April 2, 2012, the Supreme Court \n4\n5 issued its Florence decision and, on April 10, 2012, this Court scheduled a status conference in the \n6\nabove-captioned matter for 8:30 a.m. on April 20, 2012.  Although no status conference report was \n7\nordered filed, the parties have conferred and elected to file this joint status conference report in an effort \n8\nto assist the court, albeit the day before the scheduled conference. \n9\n10 I.  STATUS OF THE CASE AT THE TIME OF THE STAY \n11   At the time the Court ordered all proceedings in this matter stayed, pending decision of the \n12 Supreme Court in Florence, the Court had before it Plaintiffs’ Amended Motion to Redefine the Certified \n13 2\nClass , then set for hearing on July 29, 2011.  No opposition had been filed prior to the court’s stay of all \n14\nproceedings. \n15\n  Plaintiffs’ Amended Motion to Redefine the Certified Class proposed the following redefined \n16\nclasses: \n17\n18   The class is redefined to include all persons in the previously \ncertified class who, in the period from and including April 23, 2001, to on \n19 or about January 21, 2104 [sic], were arrested and subjected to pre-\narraignment strip and/or visual body cavity search at the San Francisco Jail, \n20 in the following subclasses (hereinafter referred to as newly defined \nclasses):  \n21\n(a) (Class One) detainees in defendants’ custody who are members of the \n22 previously certified class subjected to second strip and visual body cavity \nsearches upon their initial arrival in their housing units, prior to being \n23\n                                                 \n1\n24  In view of the impending relocation of one of the representative plaintiffs, Sister Bernie Galvin, the \ncourt permitted the parties to take her deposition to preserve her testimony for trial in the event she were \n25 unavailable. That deposition was taken on August 12, 2011. \n2\n26  Plaintiffs had initially moved to redefine the certified class on October 8, 2010, following the Ninth \nCircuit’s en banc decision on Defendants’ interlocutory appeal of this Court’s denial of Defendant \n27 Hennessey’s Motion for Qualified Immunity for his decision to create a blanket policy of strip searching \nall individuals classified for housing. \n28\n2 \nJOINT STATUS CONFERENCE REPORT \nMary Bull, et al. vs. City & County of San Francisco, et al.; USDC, Northern District of California, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB \n\nCase3:03-cv-01840-CRB   Document377   Filed04/19/12   Page3 of 7\n \n1 intermingled with the general population, after they have already been strip \nsearched at County Jail 9: there is no rational penological purpose for such \n2 successive strip searches in the absence of reasonable suspicion;  \n3 (b) (Class Two) detainees in their custody who are members of the \npreviously certified class who were subjected to strip searches without \n4 reasonable suspicion at County Jail 9 without being classified for housing \nin the general population: there is no rational penological purpose for such \n5 strip searches in the absence of reasonable suspicion;  \n6 (c) (Class Three) misdemeanor detainees in their custody, who are \nmembers of the previously certified class, eligible for the protection of \n7 California Penal Code Section 4030, who were subjected to strip searches \nin violation of Penal Code Section 4030(f), which provides that “no person \n8 shall be subjected to a strip search or visual body cavity search prior to \nplacement in the general jail population, unless a peace officer has \n9 determined there is reasonable suspicion based upon specific and \narticulable facts to believe such person is concealing a weapon or \n10 contraband, and a strip search will result in the discovery of the weapon or \ncontraband. No strip search or visual body cavity search or both may be \n11 conducted without the prior written authorization of the supervising officer \non duty. The authorization shall include the specific and articulable facts \n12 and circumstances upon which the reasonable suspicion determination was \nmade by the supervisor.”  \n13\nII.  FLORENCE DECISION \n14\n  Before the Court issued its Order staying all proceedings in this matter, the parties, in their \n15\n16 memoranda supporting and opposing the requested stay, had stated their respective understandings of the \n17 issues likely to be decided by the Supreme Court.  Defendants observed that the Supreme Court would \n18\naddress “Whether the Fourth Amendment permits a jail to conduct a suspicionless strip search of every \n19\nindividual arrested for any minor offense no matter what the circumstances.” (Defendants’ Memorandum \n20\nof Points and Authorities in Support of Motion to Stay Proceedings, Doc. # 370, p. 3., citing Question \n21\nPresented upon which U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari in Albert W. Florence v. Board of Chosen \n22\nFreeholders of the County of Burlington, et al., No. 10-945 (emphasis added)).   Defendants further \n23\n24 stated that \"The Florence case presents legal issues that are directly relevant to the Bull case, including \n25\n(1) the constitutionality of suspicionless strip searches of pre-trial detainees arrested for minor offenses \n26\nunder any circumstances and (2) the constitutionality of second strip searches following a detainee's \n27\nmovement from one jail facility to another (which issue plaintiffs in Bull have made a major component \n28\n3 \nJOINT STATUS CONFERENCE REPORT \nMary Bull, et al. vs. City & County of San Francisco, et al.; USDC, Northern District of California, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB \n\nCase3:03-cv-01840-CRB   Document377   Filed04/19/12   Page4 of 7\n \n1 of their remaining case).  Id. at 3.  Plaintiffs stated that the Supreme Court, if it confined itself to the \n2\nquestion decided below in Florence, would only address “the constitutionality of strip searches upon \n3\nadmission to the general population” (Plaintiffs’ Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Opposition to \n4\nDefendants’ Motion for Stay, Doc.# 373, p. 3.) \n5\n6 III.  PLAINTIFFS’ POSITION \n7   While the full import of the Supreme Court’s decision in Florence is subject to debate, Justice \n8 3\nKennedy, writing for the Court , explicitly noted that “This case does not require the Court to rule on the \n9\ntypes of searches that would be reasonable in instances where, for example, a detainee will be held \n10\nwithout assignment to the general jail population and without substantial contact with other detainees.”  \n11\nFurthermore, Justice Kennedy wrote, “The circumstances before the Court, however, do not present the \n12\nopportunity to consider a narrow exception of the sort Justice Alito describes, post, at 2-3 (concurring \n13\n14 opinion), which might restrict whether an arrestee whose detention has not yet been reviewed by a \n15 magistrate or other judicial officer, and who can be held in available facilities removed from the general \n16\npopulation, may be subjected to the types of searches at issue here.” (566 U.S. ___ (2012), pps 18 and 19 \n17\nof the slip opinion.) \n18\n  Justice Alito in his concurring opinion, made clear that “The Court holds that jail administrators \n19\nmay require all arrestees who are committed to the general population of a jail to undergo visual strip \n20\n4\n21 searches not involving physical contact by corrections officers.”  In that section of his concurring \n22 opinion referred to by Justice Kennedy, Justice Alito stated: \n23\nIt is important to note, however, that the Court does not hold that it is always reasonable to \nconduct a full strip search of an arrestee whose detention has not been reviewed by a \n24\n25                                                  \n3\n Except as to Part IV of the opinion which Justice Thomas did not join. \n26\n4\n Justice Alito noted that Florence was detained “not for a minor traffic offense but instead pursuant to a \n27 warrant for his arrest, and that there was apparently no alternative, if Florence were to be detained, to \nholding him in the general jail population.” \n28\n4 \nJOINT STATUS CONFERENCE REPORT \nMary Bull, et al. vs. City & County of San Francisco, et al.; USDC, Northern District of California, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB \n\nCase3:03-cv-01840-CRB   Document377   Filed04/19/12   Page5 of 7\n \n1 judicial officer and who could be held in available facilities apart from the general \npopulation.  Most of those arrested for minor offenses are not dangerous, and most are \n2\nreleased from custody prior to or at the time of their initial appearance before a magistrate. \nIn some cases, the charges are dropped.  In others, arrestees are released either on their \n3\nown recognizance or on minimal bail.  In the end, few are sentenced to incarceration.  For \nthese persons, admission to the general jail population, with the concomitant humiliation \n4\nof a strip search, may not be reasonable, particularly if an alternative procedure is feasible.  \n5 (Alito, concurring opinion, pps 1 and 3.) \n \n6\n  Justice Roberts, specifically joining Justice Alito’s concurring opinion, stated that “it is important \n7\nfor me that the Court does not foreclose the possibility of an exception to the rule it announces.”  \n8\n(Roberts, concurring opinion, p. 1.) \n9\n  The dissenting opinion noted that “it remains open for the Court to consider whether it would be \n10\nreasonable to admit an arrestee for a minor offense to the general population, and to subject her to the \n11\n12 ‘humiliation of a strip search,’ prior to any review by a judicial officer.”  (Dissenting opinion, p. 14.) \n13   Plaintiffs believe that the Supreme Court resolved a narrow question that was not seriously in \n14\ndispute in this case:  whether the Fourth Amendment precludes a jail from strip searching a person \n15\nproperly placed in the jail’s general population.  The Supreme Court did not sanction the strip search of \n16\npersons arrested on charges not involving violence, drugs or weapons, without reasonable suspicion that \n17\nsuch persons were concealing contraband, prior to such persons being properly placed into the general \n18\npopulation.  This is the second subclass described by Plaintiffs in their Motion to Redefine the Certified \n19\n20 Class.   \n21   In ruling that the Fourth Amendment did not preclude the strip search of persons properly \n22\nadmitted to the jail’s general population, the Court did not address the question of the legality of \n23\nrepetitive, pre-arraignment strip searches, of persons properly placed into the general population.  This is \n24\nthe first subclass defined in Plaintiffs’ Motion to Redefine the Certified Class.  Plaintiffs request that the \n25\nCourt set a hearing date on Plaintiffs’ Amended Motion to Redefine the Class to resolve these remaining \n26\nissues. \n27\n28   Plaintiffs’ Complaint in this case alleged that the blanket pre-arraignment strip search of persons \n5 \nJOINT STATUS CONFERENCE REPORT \nMary Bull, et al. vs. City & County of San Francisco, et al.; USDC, Northern District of California, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB \n\nCase3:03-cv-01840-CRB   Document377   Filed04/19/12   Page6 of 7\n \n1 charged with crimes not involving violence, drugs, or weapons, without reasonable suspicion that such \n2\npersons were concealing contraband, violated their Fourth Amendment right to be free from \n3\nunreasonable searches and seizures.  While the Ninth Circuit’s en banc decision approved of the \n4\nDefendants’ policy of subjecting all persons going into the general population to strip searches, \n5\nregardless of the charges on which they were arrested or the lack of reasonable suspicion to believe they \n6\nwere concealing contraband, and despite their not having first appeared before a judicial officer for \n7\n8 arraignment, bail setting, or consideration of a request for release on his/her own recognizance, in view \n9 of the Supreme Court’s reservation of this question for future decision, Plaintiffs’ believe that once \n10\njudgment is entered in this case, this issue will be ripe for reconsideration in light of the Supreme Court’s \n11\nFlorence decision and, should it again be decided adversely to Plaintiffs, for presentation to the Supreme \n12\nCourt through a Petition for Writ of Certioriari. \n13\n14 IV.  DEFENDANTS’ POSITION \n15   Without at this time providing a full analysis of the Florence decision and its impact on the \n16 instant litigation, defendants believe that the Florence decision leaves fully intact the Ninth Circuit's \n17\ndecision in Bull and, moreover, announced important standards, principles and rationale that affirm \n18\ndefendants' position in this case.  For example, the Florence court:  (1) adopted the Turner v. Safley¸482 \n19\nU.S. 78 (1987) standard (a regulation impinging on an inmate's constitutional rights must be upheld \"if it \n20\nis reasonably related to legitimate penological interests\"); (2) reaffirmed Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 \n21\n(1979); (3) reaffirmed the importance of providing deference to correctional officials; (4) found that \"the \n22\n23 seriousness of an offense is a poor predictor of who has contraband,\" 566 U.S. ___ (2012), p. 14 of the \n24\nslip opinion; and (5) provided guidance that will impact plaintiffs' proposed second strip search class.  \n25\nThe Florence decision will provide important guidance for the remainder of the instant litigation.  \n26\n  Defendants' position on how best to proceed in this case is to first identify a hearing date for \n27\nPlaintiffs' Amended Motion to Redefine the Certified Class that is approximately sixty (60) days out or \n28\n6 \nJOINT STATUS CONFERENCE REPORT \nMary Bull, et al. vs. City & County of San Francisco, et al.; USDC, Northern District of California, Case No. C 03-1840 CRB \n\nCase3:03-cv-01840-CRB   Document377   Filed04/19/12   Page7 of 7\n \n1 so.  Following the hearing and the Court's ruling on Plaintiffs' Amended Motion to Redefine the Certified \n2\nClass, defendants plan to bring one or more motions for summary judgment.  Defendants believe that this \n3\nis the best way to narrow and define precisely what is currently left in the case. \n4\nV.  POSSIBLE RESOLUTION THROUGH MEDIATION \n5\n  In telephone conversations counsel for the parties discussed the possibility of participating in \n6\n7 mediation and the possibility of utilizing retired U.S. District Court Judge Raul Ramirez or Magistrate \n8 Judge Joseph C. Spero as a mediator.  The parties will be prepared to discuss their positions on this issue \n9\nat the status conference. \n10\n \n11 DATED: April 19, 2012      Respectfully Submitted, \n \n12 LAW OFFICE OF MARK E.

However, as the panel’s majority decision succinctly stated:  \n \nThe fact that San Francisco had documented a significant problem of \ncontraband smuggling does not muddy the clarity of the law.  The \nevidence defendants produced . . . shows only that contraband smuggling \nwas  a  significant  problem  in  the  San  Francisco  jails;  it  does  not \ndemonstrate that persons eligible for inclusion in the class in this case \ncontributed significantly, or even at all, to that problem. Bull v. City and \nCounty of San Francisco, 539 F. 3d 1193, 1201. [emphasis added]. \n \nThe evidence, in other words, simply does not support, and even contradicts, \nDefendants’ assertion that members of the class here were engaged in illicit \nsmuggling.    \nDefendants’ claim that their strip search of the Plaintiff class was lawful because \n“many  persons  arrested  for  minor  violations,  such  as  shoplifting  and  traffic \nviolations…often hid drugs or weapons on their body [sic] or inside their bodily \norifices in an effort to evade confiscation,” is misleading.  (Defendants’ Petition, p.1.) \nIt implies, incorrectly, that the District Court and Ninth Circuit panel decisions have \nprohibited the jail from strip searching persons arrested for minor violations. Yet, it is \n                                                 \n1  Orders of U.S. District Court Judge, Charles R. Breyer, September 22, 2005, and February 23, 2006 – consolidated \non appeal. \n\nCase: 05-17080     11/20/2008     Page: 6 of 23      DktEntry: 6713425\nwell established, and Plaintiffs have never disputed, that the jail is entitled to strip \nsearch minor offense arrestees for a number of reasons. The arrest charge is only one \nfactor in determining whether an arrestee can and should be strip searched; prior arrest \nhistory, parole/probation status, as well as “appearance and conduct” (including gang \naffiliation) are all important factors in making this determination, and provide a lawful \nbasis for a strip search. Kennedy 901F.2d at 716. Contrary to the concern expressed by \nthe panel dissenter, the Defendants have never taken the position that they “know very \nlittle about the arrestee” and are therefore unable to determine whether an arrestee \nshould be strip searched under the reasonable suspicion standard. (539 F.3d at 1211.) \nGiven the importance of the factual record in this case, it is especially egregious \nthat Defendants have withheld information concerning the prior arrest history and other \ninformation relevant to the strip search of arrestees charged with minor offenses in the \npast, possibly leading the dissenter on the panel to believe that the instances cited were \nclass members. (591 F.3d at 1210-1211.) The fact remains that – setting aside the \ninstances where Defendants have willfully concealed the relevant documentation \nconcerning the security justification for the strip search –  every single citation to the \nrecord by Defendants demonstrates the falsity of their central claim that it was \nreasonable  and  necessary  to  strip  search  this  class.2  Defendants  argue  that  the \n                                                 \n2   Defendants’ citations to the evidence to substantiate its claim of smuggling by the \nclass before the Court are contained in two footnotes of their petition.  (fn 3 and 4.)  The \ncitations are based on various jail records which sometimes show the arrest charge or \notherwise indicate the reasons for the search; in some instances, as noted above, \nDefendants have not seen fit to release information about the arrestee or the circumstances \nof the strip search, even though such records are, of course, available to them. As to these \nincomplete records, there is no way to know why or when the person was strip searched, \nand therefore their relevance to this case is impossible to determine.   \nThe first group of citations supposedly supports the claim that strip searches have \nuncovered various items of contraband – knives, scissors, syringes, cocaine, heroin. \n(Defendants’ Petition, p.6, fn. 3.) As demonstrated in Plaintiffs’ Statement of Facts, infra, \n  2\n\nCase: 05-17080     11/20/2008     Page: 7 of 23      DktEntry: 6713425\nunfortunate death of an inmate due to a drug overdose somehow supports their policy, \nyet there’s no evidence that this inmate obtained drugs because a new arrestee was not \nstrip searched or that a strip search of persons in this class would have prevented this \ndeath.  \nThis is why the panel decision concluded that “Defendants’ claim that they have \ndocumented instances of eligible class members engaging in smuggling contraband is \nnot credible and is not supported by the record.”  (539 F.3d at 1198.)  And this is why, \nas the panel further found, “we cannot conclude there is any reasonable relationship \nbetween the criteria triggering a search (classification for housing) and the interest in \nconducting the search (eliminating the introduction of contraband.)” (539 F.3d at \n1199.)  \nNotwithstanding their failure to present a security justification for the strip \nsearch of the limited class of arrestees whose Fourth Amendment rights are at issue \nhere, Defendants assert three different bases for their attack on the panel decision. \nFirst,  they  assert  that  Bell  v.  Wolfish,  441  U.S.  520  (1979)  mandates  absolute, \nunconditional deference to the judgment of jail officials, and requires this Court to \nreverse and repudiate twenty five years of precedent holding that jail officials must \nshow a reasonable factual relationship between the strip search policy and the security \nproblem it is supposed to address. (Defendants’ Petition, p.2-3; 8-9.)   \nYet in Bell, the Supreme Court made crystal clear that courts should defer to jail \nadministrators only when there is an “absence of substantial evidence in the record” to \nindicate that the officials have “exaggerated” their response to “the problems that arise \n                                                                                                                                                               \nevery documented instance  involved persons who were lawfully strip searched precisely \nbecause there was a security justification to do so.  \nThe second group of citations supposedly substantiates the assertion that “persons \nnot arrested for crimes involving drugs, weapons, and violence secreted drugs and other \ndangerous contraband in their bodily orifices.” Again, all the documented instances cited \ninvolve lawful strip searches, since of course there are security reasons to strip search \narrestees which are based on factors other than the nature of the arrest charges, and which \nare not contested here. (Defendants’ Petition, p.7, fn. 4.)  \n  3\n\nCase: 05-17080     11/20/2008     Page: 8 of 23      DktEntry: 6713425\nin the day-to-day operation of a corrections facility.” (441 U.S. at p.548.)  This case \npresents the very situation discussed by Bell in which jail administrators “exaggerated” \ntheir response to the problem of contraband smuggling at the jail by sweeping within \ntheir blanket strip search policy a clearly defined, innocuous class which demonstrably \ndoes not engage in such illicit and dangerous activity.  \nTherefore, the blanket strip search policy at issue here is not “constitutional” just \nbecause Bell found it appropriate to defer to jail administrators in that case, which \npresented different circumstances relating to the security need for the strip search. In \nother words, the strip search policy in that case did not represent an “exaggerated” \nresponse to a security threat, while here it does, rendering deference unwarranted.  \nSecond, Defendants attack the panel decision by arguing that Powell v. Barrett, \n541 F3d 1298 (11th Cir 2008) throws new light on Ninth Circuit precedent, revealing \nthat this Court of Appeals has been wrong all along in deciding such cases as Giles v. \nAckerman, 746 F.2d 614 (9th Cir. 1984); Ward v. County of San Diego, 791 F.2d 1329 \n(9th Cir. 1986); Thompson v. City of Los Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439 (9th Cir. 1989); and \nKennedy v. Los Angeles Police Department, 901 F.2d 702 (9th Cir. 1990).  There is a \nshort, but dispositive, answer to this contention. Powell did not, as here, involve the \nvisual inspection of each arrestee’s body cavity, the type of strip search that has \nconsistently given the Courts, as Bell itself said, “instinctively the most pause” and \nwhich has been widely viewed inside and outside of this circuit as “dehumanizing and \nhumiliating.”  (Bell, 441 U.S. at 558;  Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 711.) \n Instead, in Powell, arrestees were required to shower together in groups of up to \nthirty inmates and then, while standing in a line or singly, “show [their] front and back \nsides while naked” to a guard. 541 F.3d at 1300. The intrusion upon individual privacy \nin Powell was minimal, and perhaps it is for this reason that the Court found it self-\nevident that deference to the jail administration was appropriate under Bell. In any \ncase, the privacy interests at stake in Powell are not those at issue here, and there is no \n  4\n\nCase: 05-17080     11/20/2008     Page: 9 of 23      DktEntry: 6713425\nneed for this Court to grant rehearing or rehearing en banc “to address this intercircuit \nconflict.” (Defendants’ Petition, p. 3.)   \nIn addition, any decision by this Court would not alter the arguable existence of \nan inter-circuit conflict since every other circuit to address the issue, aside from the \nEleventh Circuit, has concluded that post-arrest placement in the general population is \na relevant factor in the Fourth Amendment calculus, but, standing alone, is inadequate \nto justify a routine strip search policy. (Compare, e.g., Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, \n802 (2d Cir. 1986) (general population a factor); Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, \n1255 (6th Cir. 1989) (same); Thompson v. City of Los Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439, 1447 (9th \nCir. 1989) (same); Hill v. Bogans, 735 F.2d 391, 394-95 (10th Cir. 1984)  (same) with \nPowell  v.  Barrett,  541  F3d  1298  (11th  Cir  2008)  (general  population  a  per  se \njustification for strip search).) \n Finally, Defendants’ third attack on the panel decision is that the security \njustification in San Francisco is distinguishable from Giles, Kennedy, Thompson, \nWard, and all the District Court decisions that have followed these cases. With regard \nto this factual contention, it is puzzling that the Defendants do not accurately present \nthe facts before both the District Court and the Court of Appeals, or disclose consistent \nand complete documentation of the circumstances surrounding the strip searches \nadvanced as justification for the blanket policy. \nContrary to Defendants’ attacks on this Court’s opinion, there is a compelling \nrecord based on hundreds of thousands of strip searches over a period of many years \nthat shows the class before this Court is not involved in illicit smuggling.  Given this \nkey fact, there is no reason to lump Plaintiffs with the class of arrestees who do present \na security risk. Rather, it is reasonable to look at the members of this class individually. \nThe respect we show to individuals’ bodily privacy under our Constitution requires no \nless.    Indeed,  the  standard  Defendants  must  meet  to  lawfully  strip  search  such \nindividuals is so minimal  – any articulable reason to search is arguably enough under \n  5\n\nCase: 05-17080     11/20/2008     Page: 10 of 23      DktEntry: 6713425\nthe “reasonable suspicion” standard – the jail is fully protected. Defendants have never \nmade the claim that it is not feasible to ferret out contraband by strip searching this \nclass on a case-by-case basis. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nOn August 22, 2008, a panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals filed its decision \nupholding the decision of District Court Judge Charles R. Breyer that the policy of the \nCity and County of San Francisco and its Sheriff Michael Hennessey to strip search all \npre-arraignment detainees classified for housing, violated the Fourth Amendment’s \nprohibition against unreasonable searches with respect to the class certified in the case, \nwhich included only a limited subset of the arrestee population – those “who were \narrested for an offense not involving drugs, weapons, violence, or a violation of parole \nor probation; who did not have a criminal history involving drugs, weapons, or \nviolence; and whose behavior did not create individualized suspicion warranting the \nsearch.” (539 F.3d at 1198.) \n  The panel’s opinion, authored by Judge Thomas, was joined by Judge Ikuta \nwho filed a concurring opinion; Judge Tallman dissented. The panel followed a long \nline of 9th Circuit precedent which outlawed the pre-arraignment blanket strip search of \narrestees unless there is “some reasonable relationship between the criteria used to \nidentify the specific individuals eligible for a strip search and the interest in preventing \nthe introduction of contraband”, or, in other words, that the strip search policy “‘bear \nsome discernible relationship to security needs.’”  (539 F.3d at 1197-1198, [internal \nquote omitted].) \nDefendants petitioned for rehearing and rehearing en banc and the Court directed \nPlaintiffs to file their answer to that petition by November 20, 2008. \nLest the twin towers of rationality and stare decisis which underpin our rule of \nlaw crumble, Defendants’ arguments must fail. \n  6\n\nCase: 05-17080     11/20/2008     Page: 11 of 23      DktEntry: 6713425\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nA.  The Class Before the Court \nThe class of arrestees before the Court in this case consists of those alleged \nminor offenders who were brought to the San Francisco jail on charges not involving \ndrugs, weapons, or violence, who had no criminal history of such offenses, who were \nnot on parole or searchable probation, and who also were not reasonably suspected of \nconcealing or seeking to smuggle contraband that could only be discovered by a strip \nand visual body cavity search, but who were nonetheless strip searched. (E.R. V: 1063-\n1064, [Summary Judgment Memorandum and Order, pp.3:17-4:5]; Plaintiffs= E.R. 28-\n37 [Amended Order]).) This strip search invariably involved inspection of the naked \nbody and rectal and vaginal cavities, requiring the arrestees to squat, spread their \ncheeks and, if female, their labia, and to cough while under observation. (E.R. I: p.115 \n[Jail Policy E-03, p.3].)  \nB.  The Jail’s Strip Search Policies \nAs Defendants state, arrestees in San Francisco were initially brought to County \nJail 9 which was used as an intake facility to hold arrestees before releasing or housing \nthem. (Defendants’ Petition, p.5.)  When first brought to the holding area of County \nJail 9, and booked, all arrestees were searched, “either a ‘pat search’ performed in \nconjunction with a hand held metal detector, and/or a strip search.” (E.R. I: p.14 \n[Policy].) Numerous categories of arrestees were strip searched at the time of booking \nwithout regard to whether they were later classified for housing B including those \narrested on charges involving drugs, weapons or violence; those with a criminal history \nof such charges; those who were parolees or probationers; those who were individually \nsuspected of concealing contraband; as well as others not in the class before the Court. \n(E.R. I: 115 [Policy E-03 II A, p.2]; E.R. I: 93-94, 106-109 [Arata Depo, 1:20-42; \n  7\n\nCase: 05-17080     11/20/2008     Page: 12 of 23      DktEntry: 6713425\n43:763:1-65:9.)  This booking search was not challenged by Plaintiffs. \nArrestees who did not fall into these categories were not strip searched at the \ntime of booking. But, if they were not released from the intake facility, or if they did \nnot or could not make bail in the time allowed, they were subjected to a strip search \nwhen they were Aassigned a custody level by Classification and scheduled for custodial \nhousing.@  (E.R.  I:  p.115  [Policy  II.A.10].)  Arrestees  were  Aclassified@  and  strip \nsearched even if they were to be immediately transported directly to Court and never \nhoused at the jail. This strip search occurred before the arrestees were interviewed for \nrelease on their own recognizance.  (E.R. I: 193, 181 [Humphrey Depo 94:9-18; 66:5-\n21].)  Indeed, an arrestee could not be considered for release on his or her own \nrecognizance without bail (AO.R.@) until Astripped in.@  (E.R. I: 181-182 [Humphrey \nDepo 66:15-67:1].)  \nIn fact, Aclassification@ of arrestees could be, and was, routinely advanced in \ntime so that it occurred immediately after booking, if the arrestee declined to Aconsent@ \nto a strip search when initially received at the jail, under a policy in effect until \nFebruary 2003.  (E.R. I: 138-139 [McConnell Depo 36:13-23; 38:18-39:4]; E.R. I: 200-\n203, 206 [Oaks Depo 31:1-12; Depo Ex 46; 30:18-24; 31:7-14; 47:1-6]; E.R. II: 220-\n221 [Quock Depo 16:1-22; 17:12-25]; E.R. I: 155-157 [Hawkins Depo 14:21-16:15]; \nE.R.  I: 123 [Dyer Depo, Ex. 15].)  \nThe body cavity inspection and strip search of arrestees in Plaintiff class solely \nbecause they had been unable to make bail or otherwise gain release (and were \ntherefore Aclassified@ for housing) is the sole search challenged herein. \nC.  The Classification Process \nIf  they  were  to  be  housed  at  the  jail  before  arraignment,  arrestees  were \nAclassified@, that is, assigned a bunk in an appropriate area other than County Jail 9.  \nAClassification@ was done in order to segregate arrestees who were housed separately in \naccordance with their level of criminal sophistication, criminal history, criminal \n  8\n\nCase: 05-17080     11/20/2008     Page: 13 of 23      DktEntry: 6713425\ncharges, past incarceration behavior, vulnerability, gang affiliation, and other relevant \nfactors such as age and sex.   (E.R. I: p.89-92 [Arata Depo 36:18-39:17; 60:18-65:9].) \nDefendants claim that the arrestees in the class were, once classified, housed in \nthe “general population” of the jail. But there is no evidence that there is a Ageneral \npopulation@  within  the  San  Francisco  jail  in  which  arrestees  in  the  class  were \nindiscriminately mingled once they were housed, given the classification process. \nSignificantly, while searches of unspecified areas of the jail found contraband within \nthe jail between 2000 and 2003, there is no evidence that arrestees in the Plaintiff class \nwere  ever  housed  in  the  areas  where  those  items  of  contraband  were  found.  \n(Defendants’ Petition, pp.6-7.)   \nOnce classified and/or housed, arrestees in the class had to be taken before a \nmagistrate for arraignment Awithout unnecessary delay@ under California law, and, in \nany event, could not be detained for more than two days, excluding Sundays and \nholidays.3  \nD.  The Smuggling Problem and the Security Justification for the Strip \nSearch of the Class before the Court \nWhile Defendants presented evidence of smuggling at the San Francisco jail, \nthere is not a single shred of evidence which shows that an arrestee within the class \nbefore the Court ever tried to smuggle anything through the intake facility of the San \nFrancisco jail at the time of the pre-arraignment classification strip search,  or, indeed, \nat any other time or in any other area of the jail.  Nor was there any evidence that the \nAreasonable suspicion@ standard for strip searching an individual minor offense arrestee \nbefore arraignment was inadequate to protect jail security. Neither was there any \nevidence that the innocuous arrestees in the class were “intermingled” indiscriminately \nwith other arrestees when placed in the “general population”. \nIndeed, the Defendants’ Statement of Facts demonstrates that there is no security \n                                                 \n3   The period could be extended by one day only if Court was not in session until the following day.  (Cal. Penal Code \n§ 825.) \n  9\n\nCase: 05-17080     11/20/2008     Page: 14 of 23      DktEntry: 6713425\njustification for the classification strip search of class members.4 (See, Defendants’ \nPetition, p.6 fn. 3.)  \nThe instances of discovery of contraband cited by Defendants to show that \narrestees do secrete contraband is misleading because:  \n1.  This evidence does not show a security justification for the strip search \nof arrestees in the class certified in this case. The arrestees searched in \nconnection with these discoveries were ineligible to join the class \nand/or the strip search was lawful [E.R. III: 463; 474; 478; 506; 522; \n534; 577; 595; 607; 612-614; 617; 621; 632; 633; 634; 636; 637];  \n \n2.  The discoveries did not involve a visual body cavity search or the \ninspection of the naked body [E.R. III 464; 525; 583];  \n \n3.  In many instances Defendants have suppressed the documentation \nrelating to the reason for the strip search (such as the arrest charge or \ncriminal history) or the eligibility of the arrestee for membership in the \nclass; without this relevant documentation, there is no way to know if \nthe discovery of contraband has any bearing on the security \njustification for the strip search at issue here, and in fact it can be \npresumed that the missing evidence is unfavorable to Defendants under \nwell established evidentiary presumptions.  [E.R. III: 474; 476; 480; \n483; 484-5; 486; 487; 497;  498; 499; 502; 517; 521; 525; 526; 532; \n535; 544; 545; 547; 548; 551; 553; 558; 560; 563; 565; 567; 571; 576; \n579; 582; 584; 586; 591; 604; 609];  \n \n4.  The discoveries occurred after the discontinuance of the policy \nchallenged here [E.R. III: 611; 612-614; 617; 623; 627; 628; 629; 630].  \nDefendants also claim that persons “not arrested for crimes involving drugs, \nviolence or weapons have secreted drugs and other dangerous items in their bodily \norifices”. (Petition, p.7.) The instances of discovery of contraband cited by Defendants \nin support of this proposition are similarly irrelevant or unsupportive of this conclusion \n                                                 \n4 The evidence has been exhaustively analyzed in Plaintiffs’ Opening Briefs in the course \nof the appeal and also in Plaintiffs’ Opposition to Defendants’ Request for Judicial Notice. \nDue to space limitations, the analysis here presents only the barest outline of the lack of \nevidentiary support for the strip search policy at issue here. The Yorke record did nothing \nto strengthen Defendants’ case.  \n  10\n\nCase: 05-17080     11/20/2008     Page: 15 of 23      DktEntry: 6713425\nbecause:  \n1.  This evidence does not show a security justification for the strip search \nof arrestees in the class certified in this case: the arrestees searched \nwere ineligible to join the class and/or the strip search was lawful [E.R. \nIII:474; 478; 534; 577; 595; YER 416-19; 435-38; 443-47 ( booking \nsearch) 448-49 ( booking search); 454-57; 464-68; 488-89; 490-91]; \n \n2.  The discoveries did not involve a visual body cavity search or the \ninspection of the naked body [E.R. III 601-603; YER 439-42];  \n \n3.  In many instances, the Defendants have suppressed the documentation \nof the reason for the strip search or the eligibility of the arrestee for \nmembership in the class, which is, of course, readily available to \nDefendants since they are in possession of arrest and criminal records; \nas noted above, it can be presumed that the missing evidence is \nunfavorable to Defendants [E.R. III:532; 609; YER 414-15; 427-28; \n439-42; 450-53]; \n \n4.  The discoveries involved a strip search incident to “safety cell” \nplacement on the basis of combative behavior or some other type of \nsearch which is not at issue here. [E.R.III: 527; 612-615]. \nFinally, with regard to the contention that jail administrators knew that new \narrestees were the “most likely smugglers” of contraband, nowhere in the record does \nany San Francisco jail official opine that the members of this class posed a threat to jail \nsecurity at the time they were classified or at any other time, and in the absence of any \nobjective support for such an opinion, it is entitled to no weight. \nARGUMENT  \nA.  BELL V. WOLFISH DOES NOT REQUIRE JUDICIAL DEFERENCE \nTO JAIL OFFICIALS’ JUDGMENT WHEN THEY, AS HERE, \nEXAGGERATE THEIR RESPONSE TO SECURITY \nCONSIDERATIONS \nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed. 2d. 447 (l979) is a \nseminal  case  because  it  set  forth  the  operative  principles  for  analyzing  the \nconstitutionality of jail strip searches under the Fourth Amendment, articulating a \n  11\n\nCase: 05-17080     11/20/2008     Page: 16 of 23      DktEntry: 6713425\n“balancing test” which requires the Court to balance “the need for the particular search \nagainst  the  invasion  of  personal  rights  that  the  search  entails.”    Under  the \ncircumstances presented there, the Court upheld a policy of strip searching inmates of \nthe jail after contact visits that were afforded to inmates as a privilege or benefit. \nThe Court had no occasion to distinguish between classes of inmates, since the \nPlaintiffs apparently argued the validity of the strip search as an “all-or-nothing” \nproposition. As this circuit observed in Kennedy, “the majority was not focusing on the \nindividual basis for each search; the majority’s constitutional inquiry instead centered \naround the soundness of the policy as a whole.” (901 F.2d 702.)  The consideration of \nwhether a strip search policy could be applied constitutionally to particular categories \nof jail inmates arose, of necessity, when individual Plaintiffs, as in this case, began to \nchallenge  strip  search  policies  applied  to  them  in  particular.  In  applying  Bell’s \nbalancing test to determine whether particular categories of arrestees can be lawfully \nstrip searched under a challenged policy, this circuit has not strayed from the principles \nenunciated in Bell, but has simply applied them to the facts before it.  \nIn Bell, the factors weighed by the Court on the scale, in favor of upholding the \nstrip search policy, included the fact that many of the inmates would be held for \nmonths pending trial, were charged with serious offenses, could not qualify for bail \nunder the liberal pretrial release policy, presented an escape risk, had contact visits \nplanned  in  advance,  were  not  closely  supervised,  and  thus  presented  a  perfect \nopportunity to obtain contraband. (Bell, 441 U.S at 447, fn28; 559-560.)  Deference \nwas deemed due to federal jail administrators because, given the afore mentioned \ncircumstances, there was a reasonable relationship between the strip search and the \nsecurity objective.  (Bell, 441 U.S. at 561.) \nHere, the converse is true.  Unlike the inmates in Bell, here the members of the \nclass before the Court have not been charged with any criminal offenses or appeared in \nCourt for determination of whether they should be released on bail or O.R; they have \n  12\n\nCase: 05-17080     11/20/2008     Page: 17 of 23      DktEntry: 6713425\nonly been arrested, on the basis an “educated guess”, as the Kennedy Court observed, \nby police officers. (901 F.2d at 714.) Unlike the inmates in Bell, a population that \nincluded those charged with serious and violent offenses, here the Plaintiff class had \nbeen arrested for minor, non-violent, non-drug or weapon related charges, were not on \nparole or probation, and had no criminal history of such offenses. In contract to the \ninmates in Bell, the members of the class here could be detained for only a few days \npending their arraignment, and have never smuggled anything into the jail.  There is \nalso no evidence that they were “intermingled” with the general jail population once \nclassified.  And unlike contact visits which justified the search in Bell, the arrests \nwhich brought the class members to the jail in this case were unplanned events.  \nIn sum, as both the District Court and the panel majority found, the evidence \nfailed to show that “persons eligible for inclusion in the class in this case contributed \nsignificantly, or even at all, ” to the problem of smuggling at the jail, Defendants have \nsimply “exaggerated their response” to the risk posed by this class and, by so doing, \ndestroyed the deference otherwise due them. \nB.  THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT’S DECISION IN POWELL V. BARRETT \nIS NEITHER CONTROLLING NOR PERSUASIVE AND FAILS TO \nFOLLOW BELL V. WOLFISH’S ANALYTICAL APPROACH OF \nBALANCING SECURITY NEEDS AND PRIVACY INTERESTS \nIn Powell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298 (11th Cir. 2008), as previously mentioned, \nthe Court ruled on Defendants’ motion to dismiss and held that a “shower-search” of \nnew arrestees did not violate the Fourth Amendment.  To reach this decision the Court \nengaged in no balancing test as required by Bell – apparently finding that the need for \nthe inspection of new arrestees was self-evident. Since there was no record before the \nCourt, we cannot know the purpose of the shower inspection, its security justification, \nthe information that was available to the jail about arrestees, the length of time they \nwere to be housed, or anything else other than that they were booked, inspected after \n  13\n\nCase: 05-17080     11/20/2008     Page: 18 of 23      DktEntry: 6713425\nshowering, and then placed in the general population for the first time. \n It is clear, however, that the “shower-search” did not involve the visual body \ncavity inspection which Defendants conducted here, and which Courts have uniformly \nfound so dehumanizing. Therefore this case does not create an inter-circuit conflict and \ndoes not weigh in favor of granting Defendants’ Petition.  \nThe fundamental reasoning of the Powell Court appears to be that the fact that a \nnew arrestee was automatically put in the jail was a per se justification for a strip \nsearch. However, this Court has ruled to the contrary several times, aside from this \ncase. See e.g., Thompson v. City of Los Angeles,  885 F.2d 1439, 1447 (9th Cir. 1989) \n(“Although Thompson… was placed into contact with the general jail population, such \na factor by itself cannot justify a strip search”); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, \n617 (9th Cir. 1984) (fact that arrestee may ultimately be intermingled with general jail \npopulation does not, by itself, justify strip search as such intermingling is “both limited \nand avoidable”; factors to be considered in determining whether reasonable suspicion \nexists to warrant a strip search include “the nature of the offense, an arrestee's \nappearance and conduct, and the prior arrest record”); Way v. County of Ventura, 2006 \nWL 1028835, 4, 5 (9th Cir. 2006) (“We cannot see how the charge of being under the \ninfluence of a drug necessarily poses a threat of concealing (and thereby using or \ntrafficking) additional drugs in jail during the limited time between booking and bail, \nor booking and placement in the general population”; “as there is no evidence that \nsecurity concerns require strip searching all arrestees on all drug offenses before \nplacement in the general jail population, and none that all persons arrested for being \nunder the influence of a drug are likely to have concealed more drugs in a bodily \n  14\n\nCase: 05-17080     11/20/2008     Page: 19 of 23      DktEntry: 6713425\ncavity, the Sheriff Department’s blanket policy cannot be a proxy for reasonable \nsuspicion”). There is no need to revisit this well established law in this circuit.  \nC.  THIS CASE CANNOT BE DISTINGUISHED FROM PREVIOUS \nCASES INVALIDATING SIMILAR STRIP SEARCH POLICIES \nDefendants argue that the contraband smuggling problem faced by the San \nFrancisco jail is particularly acute such that all previous cases invalidating the strip \nsearch of arrestees similar to the members of this class are distinguishable. But as \ndemonstrated by the Plaintiffs’ Statement of Facts, rebutting each and every instance \nthat the Defendants rely upon to make their case, and as the panel majority opinion \nfound, this case is not distinguishable from other cases on the crucial issue of whether \nthere is a security justification for applying the jail’s policy of strip searching arrestees \nwho were classified for housing to the members of this class.  \nCONCLUSION \nFor all of the reasons stated, the petition to grant rehearing or rehearing en banc \nshould be denied.  \n \nDATED: November 19, 2008  Respectfully submitted, \n \nLAW OFFICE OF MARK E.

This contraband included shanks (home-made knives), lighters, \nneedles, cocaine, methamphetamines, and heroin.  The persons smuggling this \ncontraband were not limited to those arrested on charges involving drugs, weapons, \nor violence.  Instead, many were persons arrested for minor violations, such as \nshoplifting and traffic violations.  These persons often hid the drugs or weapons on \ntheir body or inside their bodily orifices in an effort to evade confiscation.  \nBased on experience, San Francisco jail officials knew that new arrestees \nwere the most likely smugglers of contraband into the general jail population.  \nThose officials also knew that visual strip searches were effective at deterring and \nreducing contraband smuggling.  Thus, San Francisco implemented a visual strip \nsearch policy.  Under this policy, after determining that an arrestee was ineligible \nfor citation release and after providing a reasonable opportunity to post bail, San \nFrancisco visually strip searched those arrestees who were about to be transferred \ninto the general jail population.  As a result of these searches, San Francisco \nconfiscated numerous items of contraband including drugs and weapons that it \nwould not have discovered using other types of searches—such as a pat down \nsearch or a search using a metal detector.  Indeed, the effectiveness of San \nFrancisco's policy is starkly illustrated by the death of a jail inmate from a drug \noverdose soon after San Francisco halted its policy in response to the filing of this \nlawsuit. \nAppellants' Petition For Rehearing & Rehearing En Banc   1  n:\\lit\\li2008\\031697\\00513555.doc \nBull v. CCSF, et al. Case No. 06-15566 \n \n\nCase: 05-17080     10/03/2008     Page: 6 of 22      DktEntry: 6665879\n \nArrestees who were strip searched by San Francisco before January 2004 \nfiled this class action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that San Francisco's visual \nstrip search policy violated the Fourth Amendment.  In a divided opinion with a \nstrong dissent, the panel majority held that, under Ninth Circuit precedents, San \nFrancisco's visual strip search policy was unconstitutional under the Fourth \nAmendment and that the illegality of the policy was clearly established at the time.  \nThe panel held that strip searches of pretrial detainees are unconstitutional \"in the \nabsence of reasonable individualized suspicion.\"  Bull v. City and County of San \nFrancisco, 539 F.3d 1193, 1196, 1201 (9th Cir. 2008). \nAlthough Judges Thomas and Ikuta affirmed the denial of qualified \nimmunity, Judge Ikuta, compelled by Ninth Circuit precedents, concurred “with \nreluctance and grave concern.”  Id. at 1202.  Because the panel's holding and \nCircuit precedents \"contradict[ed]\" the United States Supreme Court's decision in \nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979), and thereby placed lives at risk, she urged \"a \nreconsideration of our case law.\"  Bull, 539 F.3d at 1205.  In dissent, Judge \nTallman agreed that the majority's holding conflicted with Bell and placed lives at \nrisk but concluded that San Francisco's policy \"was reasonable under the Fourth \nAmendment and resulted in no constitutional violation.\"  Id. at 1212.  Thus, two \njudges on the panel—a majority—believed that San Francisco's strip search policy \nwas constitutional notwithstanding Ninth Circuit case law. \nSan Francisco now petitions for rehearing or rehearing en banc.  As \nexplained below, this Court should grant this petition because the panel majority's \ndecision contradicts the Supreme Court’s decision in Bell—the seminal case \nregarding strip searches of pretrial detainees—and the rulings of this and other \nfederal circuits. \nFirst, the panel majority's decision strayed from Bell.  In Bell, the Supreme \nCourt held that a policy of strip searching inmates after contact visits without \nAppellants' Petition For Rehearing & Rehearing En Banc   2  n:\\lit\\li2008\\031697\\00513555.doc \nBull v. CCSF, et al. Case No. 06-15566 \n \n\nCase: 05-17080     10/03/2008     Page: 7 of 22      DktEntry: 6665879\n \nindividualized, reasonable suspicion was constitutional.  After balancing “the need \nfor the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search \nentails,” the court concluded that prison administrators should be accorded \"wide-\nranging deference in the adoption and execution of policies and practices that in \ntheir judgment are needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain \ninstitutional security.\"  Bell, 441 U.S. at 547.  In its earlier precedents, this Court \nmisconstrued Bell's balancing test and failed to accord the required deference to \njail administrators when it suggested that arrestees transferred to the general \npopulation cannot be strip searched absent an individualized, reasonable suspicion \nthat they have contraband.  As Judges Tallman and Ikuta correctly observed:  \n“[o]ur ship has sailed far from the course charted by the United States Supreme \nCourt in Bell.”  Bull, 539 F.3d at 1205; see also Id. at 1203 (“Ninth Circuit \nprecedent has wandered far from Bell, as the dissent points out”).  Thus, this Court \nshould grant rehearing or rehearing en banc and reconsider Giles v. Ackerman, 746 \nF.2d 614 (9th Cir. 1984), Thompson v. City of Los Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439 (9th Cir. \n1989), and Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Dept., 901 F.2d 702, 714 (9th Cir. 1990). \nSecond, the panel majority's decision conflicts with a recent en banc \ndecision from the Eleventh Circuit.  In Powell v. Barrett, 2008 WL 4072800 (11th \nCir. Sept. 4, 2008), the Eleventh Circuit, in an 11-1 decision, upheld a policy of \n\"strip searching all arrestees\" to be transferred into the general jail population \n\"even without a reasonable suspicion to believe that they may be concealing \ncontraband.\"  Thus, the Eleventh Circuit has taken a position contrary to the \nposition that the Ninth Circuit has taken here.  And this Court should grant \nrehearing or rehearing en banc in order to address this intercircuit conflict. \nThird, the panel majority should have distinguished Ninth Circuit case law \nbased on the unique record in this case.  Although prior Ninth Circuit cases have \nheld that strip searches of individual pretrial detainees violate the Fourth \nAppellants' Petition For Rehearing & Rehearing En Banc   3  n:\\lit\\li2008\\031697\\00513555.doc \nBull v. CCSF, et al. Case No. 06-15566 \n \n\nCase: 05-17080     10/03/2008     Page: 8 of 22      DktEntry: 6665879\n \nAmendment in the absence of individualized, reasonable suspicion, none of those \ncases had a well-documented record of contraband smuggling as in this case.  \nMoreover, many of those cases involved detainees who were awaiting bail or \ncitation release at the time of the search.  Absent evidence of a serious smuggling \nproblem, this Court concluded that the privacy concerns of detainees who would \nonly spend a few hours in jail outweighed the security interests of the facility.  The \nsame is not true here.  As Judge Tallman aptly observed, \"[w]e have never before \nbeen presented with such a compelling record of dangerous smuggling activity.\"  \nBull, 539 F.3d at 1206.  Balancing inmate privacy against the jail's security in light \nof this record as required by Ninth Circuit precedents compels a different \nconclusion—that San Francisco's strip search policy is constitutional.  Finally, \neven if the panel majority properly held that San Francisco's policy violated the \nFourth Amendment, it erred in holding that the unlawfulness of the policy was \nclearly established at the time.  In light of the serious smuggling problem plaguing \nSan Francisco's jails, a reasonable jail official could believe that it was lawful to \nstrip search arrestees who were unavoidably about to be placed in the general jail \npopulation. \nThe panel majority's decision poses a real danger to detention facilities \nthroughout the Ninth Circuit.  Like San Francisco jails, these facilities face a \nserious contraband smuggling problem that threatens the lives of their inmates and \nemployees.  Visual strip searches offer an effective way for these facilities to \ncombat this problem.  If allowed to stand, this decision will substitute the Court's \njudgment for that of experienced jail administrators.  And in so doing, the Court \nwill expose jail inmates and employees throughout the Ninth Circuit to injury and, \nsadly, even death.

Rather than place lives at risk, this Court should \ngrant rehearing or rehearing en banc. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nThis is a class action challenging San Francisco's former strip search policy.  \nUntil January 2004, San Francisco visually strip searched pretrial detainees who \n(a) had been given a reasonable opportunity to post bail or cite out (citation and \nrelease) before the search, and (b) were about to be transferred to the general jail \npopulation.1  San Francisco jail administrators implemented this policy in order to \ncombat contraband smuggling in its urban jails.   \nThe smuggling problem in San Francisco jails is grave.  From April 2000 \nthrough December 2003, searches of the general jail population uncovered over \n1,500 items—including shanks, knives, lighters, rock cocaine, cocaine powder, \nmethamphetamines, hypodermic needles, marijuana, heroin, and ecstasy pills.  \n(E.R. IV:  669).2  When prisoners smuggle drugs and weapons on or inside their \nbodies, employees, visitors, and inmates are put in danger.  Indeed, courts have \nrecognized the inherent danger posed by such smuggling.  See, e.g., Hudson v. \nPalmer, 468 U.S. 517, 526-27 (1984) (taking judicial notice of the “perplexing” \nproblem of contraband flowing into prisons).  And the record here shows that \nnothing less than the lives of inmates and staff are at stake.   \nAll new arrestees in San Francisco are brought to County Jail No. 9, San \nFrancisco’s intake and release facility.  At the facility, arrestees are booked and \nprocessed, and a determination is made as to whether they will be released or \nhoused in the general jail population.  (E.R. IV:  847).  Because County Jail No. 9 \n                                           \n1 Because of this class action, the Sheriff instituted new search policies in \nJanuary 2004 that are still in effect.  These new policies are not at issue here.   \n2 “E.R.” refers to Appellants’ Excerpts of Record filed in the consolidated \ncompanion appeal, Docket No. 05-17080. \nAppellants' Petition For Rehearing & Rehearing En Banc   5  n:\\lit\\li2008\\031697\\00513555.doc \nBull v.

(E.R. IV:  857).  County Jail No. 9 is thus the gateway into \nthe San Francisco jail system for both people and contraband. \nFrom their experience, San Francisco jail administrators knew that arrestees \nreceived for booking and transferred into the general jail population were the most \nlikely smugglers of drugs and weapons into San Francisco jails.  (E.R. IV: 644, \n646).  Thus, after giving arrestees a reasonable opportunity to post bail, persons \nwho were not eligible for citation release and did not post bail were visually strip \nsearched before entering the general jail population.  (E.R. IV:  653, 849).  These \nsearches were visual only; they involved no touching, occurred in private, and \nwere conducted by a deputy of the same gender as the arrestee.  (E.R. IV:  653-55.)  \nArrestees were given as long as possible to post bail or cite out before being strip \nsearched.  (E.R. IV:  861, 863, 868).  The purpose of these searches was to prevent \ncontraband smuggling, for the safety of inmates and staff.  (E.R. IV:  644, 852).   \nAnd these visual strip searches prevented a huge amount of contraband from \nentering the jails. The evidentiary record reveals that the strip searches uncovered \nnumerous knives, scissors, syringes, cocaine, heroin, and other illegal drugs hidden \nin the rectums, vaginas, mouths, or ears of new arrestees.3   \nArrestees who attempted to smuggle drugs and weapons into San Francisco jails \nwere not limited to persons arrested on charges involving drugs, weapons or \nviolence.  Indeed, the record reveals that persons who were not arrested for crimes \n                                           \n3 E.R. IV:  646, 667; E.R.

(E.R. IV:  645-46).  This too is borne out by \nthe record.  After San Francisco ended its strip search policy, an inmate died from \nan overdose of cocaine that was smuggled into the general jail population at the \nCounty Jail.  (E.R. V: 1058-60). \nARGUMENT \nI.  THE COURT SHOULD GRANT REHEARING OR REHEARING EN \nBANC BECAUSE THE PANEL'S DECISION CONFLICTS WITH \nSUPREME COURT AND OTHER CIRCUIT AUTHORITY. \nA.  The Panel's Holding Contradicts the Supreme Court's Decision In \n  Bell. \nAlthough the panel affirmed the district court's order holding that San \nFrancisco's strip search policy violated the Fourth Amendment, a majority—Judges \nIkuta and Tallman—agreed that the panel's holding contradicted Bell.  Indeed, \nJudge Ikuta, who reluctantly concurred, stated that \"a reconsideration of our case \nlaw is urgently needed.\"  Bull, 539 F.3d at 1205.  This Court should heed Judges \nIkuta and Tallman and grant rehearing or rehearing en banc.      \nIn Bell, the Supreme Court held that a detention facility may limit a pretrial \ndetainee's constitutional rights in order to maintain \"institutional security\" and \npreserve \"internal order and discipline.” 441 U.S. at 546.5  In determining whether \na facility's measures are constitutional, courts apply a fact-intensive balancing test: \n                                           \n4  E.R.  III: 474, 478, 527, 532, 534, 577, 595, 601, 603, 609, 612-14; Y.E.R. \nIII: 414-15, 416-19, 427-28, 435-38, 439-42, 443-47, 448-49, 450-53, 454-57, 464-\n68, 488-89, 490-91.  “Y.E.R.” refers to Appellants’ Excerpts of Record in Yourke \nv. City and County of San Francisco, Docket No. 06-16450, which were judicially \nnoticed. \n5 Federal case law makes it clear that there should be no distinction between \npretrial detainees and convicted inmates.  As the Supreme Court explained in Bell, \n(continued on next page) \nAppellants' Petition For Rehearing & Rehearing En Banc   7  n:\\lit\\li2008\\031697\\00513555.doc \nBull v. CCSF, et al. Case No. 06-15566 \n \n\nCase: 05-17080     10/03/2008     Page: 12 of 22      DktEntry: 6665879\n \nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment ... \nrequires a balancing of the need for the particular search against \nthe invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts \nmust consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner \nin which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and \nthe place in which it is conducted.  Id. at 559. \nUnder this test, “even when an institutional restriction infringes a specific \nconstitutional guarantee ... the practice must be evaluated in the light of the central \nobjective of prison administration, safeguarding institutional security.” Id. at 546-\n47.  Courts must accord “wide-ranging deference” to prison officials “in the \nadoption and execution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed \nto preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security.” Id. \nat 547.  Further, “in the absence of substantial evidence in the record to indicate \nthat the officials have exaggerated their response to these considerations, courts \nshould ordinarily defer to their expert judgment in such matters.” Id. at 548 \n(internal quotations omitted). \nApplying these principles, the Supreme Court in Bell upheld the detention \nfacility's policy of conducting a body-cavity search after a detainee had a contact \nvisit with a person outside the facility.  It did so even though only one search \nconducted by the facility had resulted in the discovery of contraband.  Id. at 558.  \n\"Balancing the significant and legitimate security interests of the institution against \nthe privacy interest of the inmates,\" the Court concluded that the strip search policy \nwas reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.  Id. at 560. \n                                                                                                                                        \n(footnote continued from previous page) \n441 U.S. at 546 n.28, \"there is no basis for concluding that pretrial detainees pose \nany lesser security risk than convicted inmates.  Indeed, it may be that in certain \ncircumstances they present a greater risk to jail security and order.\" Id.  See also \nDufrin v. Spreen, 712 F.2d 1084, 1087-88 (6th Cir. 1983) (\"It is clear that prison \nofficials need not distinguish between convicted inmates and pretrial detainees in \nreviewing their security practices\"). \nAppellants' Petition For Rehearing & Rehearing En Banc   8  n:\\lit\\li2008\\031697\\00513555.doc \nBull v. CCSF, et al. Case No. 06-15566 \n \n\nCase: 05-17080     10/03/2008     Page: 13 of 22      DktEntry: 6665879\n \nUnder Bell, San Francisco's strip search policy is constitutional.  The \nsmuggling of drugs and weapons into San Francisco jails is pervasive and poses a \nserious danger to jail inmates and employees.  Based on their experience, jail \nadministrators concluded that visual strip searches were effective in combating this \nsmuggling problem and protecting inmates and staff.  The subsequent death of an \ninmate due to a drug overdose after San Francisco halted its policy supports this \nconclusion.  Balancing the \"significant and legitimate security interests\" of San \nFrancisco jails against privacy concerns as required by Bell, this Court should have \nupheld the constitutionality of San Francisco's strip search policy.  Bell, 441 U.S. at \n560. \nBoth Judges Tallman and Ikuta agreed.  As Judge Tallman explained:  \nSan Francisco has demonstrated beyond cavil that the \nsmuggling of drugs, weapons, and other contraband into the \ngeneral jail population is a common and pervasive problem that \nimposes a security risk endangering both jail inmates and jail \nemployees.  While acknowledging the existence of this \nevidence, the majority extends Ninth Circuit restrictions and \nadopts a per se rule requiring reasonable suspicion to strip \nsearch a pretrial detainee transferred into the general population \nfor housing who does not otherwise meet the category of \narrestees the majority approves for strip-searching.  But the \nnewly-minted rule runs contrary to Supreme Court precedent, \nimpedes jail administration, and further endangers the safety of \njail inmates and employees.  Bull, 539 F.3d at 1206. \nSimilarly, Judge Ikuta stated: \nIn considering whether the policy was reasonable, we must \ndefer to the judgment of jail administrators.  If we did so, and \nthereby followed the directive of the Supreme Court, we would \nbe compelled to uphold the strip search policy as reasonable \ngiven the substantial evidence in the record illustrating the dire \nsecurity needs facing the facility.  Id. at 1203. \nOnly prior Ninth Circuit precedents—whose \"balancing test bears little \nrelation to Bell's\"—compelled Judge Ikuta to \"reluctantly concur in the majority's \ndetermination that the strip search policy was unconstitutional.\"  Bull, 539 F.3d at \nAppellants' Petition For Rehearing & Rehearing En Banc   9  n:\\lit\\li2008\\031697\\00513555.doc \nBull v. CCSF, et al. Case No. 06-15566 \n \n\nCase: 05-17080     10/03/2008     Page: 14 of 22      DktEntry: 6665879\n \n1204-1205.  Those precedents should be reconsidered not only because of Bell but \nto ensure the safety of jail inmates and employees.   \nB.  The Panel's Decision Conflicts With Other Federal Circuit         \nAuthority. \nJust weeks after the panel concluded that San Francisco's strip search policy \nviolated the Fourth Amendment, the Eleventh Circuit reached the opposite \nconclusion.  In an 11-1 en banc decision, the Eleventh Circuit upheld a policy of \n\"strip searching all arrestees as part of the process of booking them into the general \npopulation of a detention facility, even without a reasonable suspicion to believe \nthat they may be concealing contraband.\"  Powell, 2008 WL 4072800, at *1.  \nRelying on Bell, it reversed prior Eleventh Circuit precedents that had held—like \nthe Ninth Circuit—that individualized reasonable suspicion was necessary.  As the \ncourt explained, \"[e]mployees, visitors, and (not least of all) the detained inmates \nthemselves face a real threat of violence, and administrators must be concerned on \na daily basis with the smuggling of contraband by inmates accused of \nmisdemeanors as well as those accused of felonies.\"  Id. at *13.  \"These reasons \nsupport the expert opinion of jail administrators that all of those who are to be \ndetained in the general population of a detention facility should be strip searched \nwhen they enter or re-enter it.\"  Id.  Because the panel's decision conflicts with \nPowell, the Court should grant rehearing or rehearing en banc. \nII.  THE COURT SHOULD GRANT REHEARING OR REHEARING EN \nBANC BECAUSE SAN FRANCISCO'S STRIP SEARCH POLICY IS \nCONSTITUTIONAL UNDER NINTH CIRCUIT PRECEDENTS. \nThe record of drug and weapons smuggling in this case is unprecedented.  \nAs Judge Tallman aptly noted, this Court has \"never before been presented with \nsuch a compelling record of dangerous smuggling activity.\"  Bull, 539 F.3d at \n1206.  Even under Ninth Circuit precedents, this record constitutionally justifies \nSan Francisco’s strip search policy. \nAppellants' Petition For Rehearing & Rehearing En Banc   10  n:\\lit\\li2008\\031697\\00513555.doc \nBull v. CCSF, et al. Case No. 06-15566 \n \n\nCase: 05-17080     10/03/2008     Page: 15 of 22      DktEntry: 6665879\n \nUnder prior Ninth Circuit cases, a strip search policy must be reasonably \nrelated to the penal institution's interest in maintaining security—which must be \nsufficiently documented.  See Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 713 (“the enacted policy, if it \nis to be constitutional, must be ‘reasonably related’ to the penal institution’s \ninterest in maintaining security\"); Giles, 746 F.2d at 618 (holding that strip search \nmust bear some “discernible relationship to security needs”)(citations and \nquotations omitted).  And in those prior cases, this Court invalidated various strip \nsearch policies because they were not reasonably related to the institution's security \ninterest. \nBut this Court has never considered \"a record as fully developed and \ncomplete as that provided by San Francisco in support of its policy.\"  Bull, 539 \nF.3d at 1207.  In Giles, 746 F.2d at 617, \"the incidence of smuggling activity at \nthe\" jail was \"minimal.\"  Similarly, in Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 713, jail officials \nprovided no \"documentation (or even assertion) that felony arrestees have \nattempted to smuggle contraband into the jail in greater frequency than \nmisdemeanor arrestees.\"6  Finally, the Court in Thompson, 885 F.2d 1438 makes \nno mention of any contraband smuggling in the record.7\nBy contrast, San Francisco has documented the serious smuggling problem \nin its jails and has demonstrated that a substantial risk of smuggling exists \nregardless of whether the detainee is arrested for crimes involving drugs, weapons, \n                                           \n6 The strip search in Kennedy was far more intrusive than the strip searches \nat issue here.  In Kennedy, the detainee was “required to insert her fingers into her \nvagina and anus\"—and a policewoman touched her—in order to \"check whether \nshe had concealed any drugs or contraband in these body cavities.”  901 F.2d at \n711.  San Francisco’s strip searches involve no physical penetration and no \ntouching. \n7 Because San Francisco only searched arrestees who were going to be \ntransferred into the general jail population, other Ninth Circuit decisions – which \ndo not involve arrestees transferred to the general jail population – are inapposite.  \nSee Ward v. County of San Diego, 791 F.2d 1328, 1333 (9th Cir. 1985); Act \nUp!/Portland v. Bagley, 988 F.2d 868, 871-872 (9th Cir. 1993). \nAppellants' Petition For Rehearing & Rehearing En Banc   11  n:\\lit\\li2008\\031697\\00513555.doc \nBull v. CCSF, et al. Case No. 06-15566 \n \n\nCase: 05-17080     10/03/2008     Page: 16 of 22      DktEntry: 6665879\n \nor violence.  Thus, San Francisco has established that its strip search policy is \n\"reasonably related\" to its interest in maintaining jail security.   \nAccording to the panel majority, San Francisco's failure to clearly document \nany smuggling by an arrestee who would qualify as a member of the class – i.e., a \nperson who was not arrested on a charge involving drugs, weapons, or violence, \nwho did not have a criminal history involving drugs, weapons, or violence, and \nwhose behavior did not create an individualized suspicion warranting a search – \nestablishes that its strip search policy was not reasonably related to security \ninterests.  But the panel majority ignores the practical realities of the smuggling \nproblem.  As Judge Tallman explained, \"[i]nmates returning from a court \nappearance outside jail pose the same risk to the general jail population upon return \nas do new arrestees coming in from the outside.\"  Bull, 539 F.3d at 1211.  \nMoreover, as evidenced by the record, arrestees who were not arrested on charges \ninvolving drugs, weapons, or violence regularly attempted to smuggle drugs and \nweapons into San Francisco jails.  Finally, \"officials at a county jail . . . usually \nknow very little about the new inmates they receive or the security risk they \npresent at the time of their arrival.\"  Id. at 1211 (internal quotations omitted).  In \nlight of these practical realities, the panel majority's parsing of the record is \nfallacious.  By restricting San Francisco's options for dealing with its serious \nsmuggling problem based on the vagaries of the class definitions used by plaintiffs, \nthe majority not only jeopardizes jail security, but also the lives of jail inmates and \nemployees.    \nBecause he gave insufficient weight to the security risks, Judge Thomas \nquite amazingly, stated that “we cannot conclude that there is any reasonable \nrelationship between the criteria triggering a search (classification for housing) and \nthe interest in conducting the search (eliminating the introduction of contraband).”  \nBull, 539 F.3d at 1199.  If the panel majority had conducted the \"reasonable \nAppellants' Petition For Rehearing & Rehearing En Banc   12  n:\\lit\\li2008\\031697\\00513555.doc \nBull v. CCSF, et al.

And \nSan Francisco did not implement its strip search policy solely because detainees \nwould be placed into contact with the general jail population.  It implemented the \npolicy also based on (1) the grave, well-documented smuggling problem (not \npresent in Giles or Thompson) in San Francisco jails, which has caused injuries and \ndeath, and (2) the judgment of experienced jail administrators that arrestees \ntransferred into the general jail population pose the greatest risk of smuggling \ncontraband.  These additional factors render San Francisco's policy constitutional \nunder Ninth Circuit precedents. \nIII.  THE COURT SHOULD GRANT REHEARING OR REHEARING EN \nBANC BECAUSE SAN FRANCISCO'S VIOLATION OF THE \nFOURTH AMENDMENT WAS NOT CLEARLY ESTABLISHED. \nAccording to the panel majority, \"it was clearly established in this Circuit \nthat conducting strip searches of pre-arraignment arrestees based solely on the fact \n                                           \n8 To the extent Giles and Thompson appear to hold otherwise, these \npronouncements are dicta, as Judge Tallman rightfully observed.  Bull, 539 F.3d at \n1208 (\"[N]either case [Giles or Thompson] addressed a record as persuasive as that \npresented by San Francisco, and both cases based their holdings on separate legal \ngrounds, making their broad pronouncements dicta.\")  \nAppellants' Petition For Rehearing & Rehearing En Banc   13  n:\\lit\\li2008\\031697\\00513555.doc \nBull v.

It therefore concluded that no \nreasonable person could have believed that San Francisco's strip search policy was \nlawful at the time of its implementation.  But the evidentiary record in this case \ndistinguishes this case from every other case.  Because the majority erred in \ndenying qualified immunity, this Court should grant rehearing or rehearing en \nbanc.     \nQualified immunity ensures that officers, before they are held liable for \nconstitutional violations, have \"fair notice that [their] conduct was unlawful.\"  See \nBrosseau v. Haugen, 543 U.S. 194, 198 (2004).  The inquiry into whether conduct \nviolates clearly established law \"must be undertaken in light of the specific context \nof the case, not as a broad general proposition.\"  Id. at 198 (citation and quotations \nomitted).   \nAs explained above, prior Ninth Circuit cases did not involve a well-\ndocumented record of contraband smuggling or inmates being searched only after \nfailing to post bail or failing to be cited and released.  Unlike the defendants in \nthose cases, San Francisco did not search detainees awaiting bail or citation release \nand whose transfer to the general jail population was avoidable.  And unlike those \ndefendants, San Francisco has demonstrated a serious smuggling problem in its \njails—involving all arrestees, and not just persons arrested for offenses involving \ndrugs, violence, or weapons.  This smuggling problem jeopardizes the lives of its \njail inmates and employees.  Balancing privacy concerns against the security \ninterests in light of the unique record in this case, a reasonable jail official could \nbelieve that San Francisco's strip search policy was constitutional.  Accordingly, \nthis Court should grant rehearing or rehearing en banc. \nAppellants' Petition For Rehearing & Rehearing En Banc   14  n:\\lit\\li2008\\031697\\00513555.doc \nBull v. CCSF, et al.

PERMITTING THE PANEL MAJORITY OPINION TO STAND \nWILL HAVE SERIOUS NEGATIVE REPERCUSSIONS FOR \nDETENTION FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE NINTH CIRCUIT. \nThe San Francisco jails are not the only ones facing the troubling problem of \ncontraband smuggling.  For example, the County of San Mateo submitted an \namicus brief explaining that San Mateo jails face a similar scourge.  And there can \nbe little doubt that this issue affects county jails and federal prisons throughout the \nNinth Circuit.  See, e.g., Johannes v. Alameda County Sheriff's Dep't., 2006 WL \n2504400, at *4-6 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 29, 2006) (discussing the contraband problem in \na large county jail and the usefulness of strip searches in combating the problem).  \nLike San Francisco, the administrators of these jails and prisons believe that a \nvisual strip search policy is the only way to effectively combat the problem.  \nPreventing these administrators from implementing such a policy jeopardizes the \nsafety of inmates and employees.  As the dissent succinctly and powerfully stated, \n“When people are dying as a result of our errant jurisprudence, it is time to correct \nthe course of our law.”  Bull, 539 F.3d at 1213. \nV.

Seaton, Casper, Meadows, Schwartz\n& Cook, for the appellees. \nOPINION\nTHOMAS, Circuit Judge: \nIn this interlocutory appeal, we consider whether a blanket\npolicy of strip searching without reasonable suspicion of all\nindividuals arrested and classified for housing in the general\njail population violates the arrestees’ clearly established con-\nstitutional rights. Under the circumstances presented by this\ncase, we conclude that it does, and affirm the order of the dis-\ntrict court denying qualified immunity in this § 1983 class\naction suit. \n\n11476 BULL  v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\nI\nThe  San  Francisco  Sheriff’s  Department  (“Department”)\noversees an urban jail system, consisting of six county jails,\nwhich books and processes tens of thousands of persons a\nyear.  All  new  arrestees  are  brought  to  County  Jail  No.  9\nwhere they are booked and a determination is made as to\nwhether  the  arrestee  will  be  released  or  housed  pending\narraignment. County Jail No. 9 is a temporary detention facil-\nity and does not contain accommodations for extended stays.\nThus, all detainees who are classified for housing are trans-\nferred to another one of San Francisco’s jails within 24 hours.\nSan Francisco’s jails have faced a continuing problem with\nsmuggled contraband, including drugs and weapons. Searches\nwithin the general jail population have uncovered hundreds of\nitems of contraband. Many items of contraband have been dis-\ncovered during strip searches conducted on new arrestees at\nCounty Jail No. 9. Defendants produced evidence of 49 dis-\ncoveries of drug-related contraband and six weapon discover-\nies between April 2000 and January 2004. \nUntil January 21 2004, San Francisco had a policy1 of strip\nsearching all arrestees entering County Jail No. 9 who fell\ninto multiple particular categories.2 The strip search involved\n1San Francisco’s new policy, which went into effect January 21, 2004\nand currently remains in effect, is not at issue in this case. \n2According to the San Francisco Sheriff’s Department’s Policy and Pro-\ncedure manual, the following categories of arrestees were required to be\nstrip searched at the time of booking: \n•  An  arrestee  charged  with  a  crime  involving\ndrugs, weapons, or violence; \n•  An  arrestee  with  a  criminal  history  involving\ndrugs, weapons, or violence within the preceding\nfive years or multiple arrests within the last five\nyears for drugs, weapons, or violence; \n\nBULL  v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO 11477\ninspection of the naked body, including the arrestee’s breasts,\nbuttocks, and genitalia.\nAccording  to  Defendants,  the  strip  search  policy  was\napplied  as  follows:  upon  arrival  at  County  Jail  No.  9,  all\ninmates who were deemed searchable based on their charge\nor criminal history were automatically strip searched. Other\narrestees were generally not strip searched unless they were\n•  A  person  charged  with  a  parole  violation  or\nbooked with a state parole hold; \n•  A person charged with violation of probation; \n•  A  person  in  custody  on  detainer  from  another\njurisdiction; \n•  A person returned to custody from San Francisco\nCounty parole; \n•  A  person  returned  to  custody  from  residential\nplacement programs; \n•  A person in custody of another agency, booked\ninto jail for safe-keeping; \n•  A person booked on a U.S. Marshal hold; \n•  A person assigned a custody level and scheduled\nfor custodial housing; \n•  A person delivered from another jail. \nThe manual also stipulated that any arrestee may be strip searched by\nthe “arresting, transporting, or booking officer” when the officer “has a\nreasonable suspicion based on articulable facts that the person may pos-\nsess contraband. \n\n11478 BULL  v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\nidentified for placement in a safety cell,3 or if the detainee\nwould not be released within twenty-four hours and therefore\nwould  need  to  be  housed  in  another  jail  facility.  In  other\nwords,  the  Department  followed  a  blanket  policy  of  strip\nsearching all individuals who were classified for housing in\nthe general jail population, regardless of the crime for which\nthey were charged.\nOn April 23, 2003, Mary Bull and a class of similarly-\nsituated plaintiffs brought a § 1983 suit against Defendants\nalleging causes of action under the Fourth and Fourteenth\nAmendments of the U.S. Constitution, and several provisions\nof state law. In an order issued June 10, 2004, the district\ncourt  granted  Bull’s  motion  to  certify  a  class  under  Rule\n23(b)(3). The class was defined as:\nAll persons who, during the applicable period of lim-\nitations, and continuing to date, were arrested on any\ncharge  not  involving  weapons,  controlled  sub-\nstances, or a charge of violence, and not involving a\nviolation of parole or a violation of probation (where\nconsent to search is a condition of such probation),\nand who were subjected to a blanket visual body\ncavity strip search by defendants before arraignment\nat a San Francisco County jail facility without any\nindividualized reasonable suspicion that they were\nconcealing contraband. This class also includes 1) all\narrestees who were subjected to subsequent blanket\nstrip search(es) before arraignment after the initial\nstrip search, without any reasonable individualized\nsuspicion that they had subsequently acquired and\nhidden contraband on their persons; and 2) all per-\nsons who, prior to arraignment, were subjected to\nblanket  visual  body  cavity  search(es)  incident  to\n3Safety cells are single-occupant, padded cells used to house inmates\nwho were considered a danger to themselves or others, to be behaving in\na “bizarre” manner, or to be “gravely disabled.” \n\nBULL  v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO 11479\nplacement in a “safety cell” at any of the San Fran-\ncisco County jails. \nThe class was further limited by the district court’s Febru-\nary 23, 2006 order, which held that San Francisco’s policy of\nstrip searching arrestees on the basis of their criminal history\nwas lawful.4 The persons in the class as it stands before this\nCourt are thus all arrestees who were strip searched prior to\narraignment solely because they were classified for housing in\nthe general jail population prior to their arraignment. \nThe parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. On\nSeptember  22,  2005  the  district  court  granted  in  part  and\ndenied in part both motions. In relevant part, the district court\nheld  that  Sheriff  Hennessey  was  not  entitled  to  qualified\nimmunity with respect to San Francisco’s blanket policy of\nstrip searching all individuals classified for housing in the\ngeneral jail population. Defendants now appeal the district\ncourt’s denial of qualified immunity for Sheriff Hennessey.5\nII\nWe review de novo a district court’s decision to grant sum-\nmary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity. Motley\nv. Parks, 383 F.3d 1058, 1062 (9th Cir. 2004). In reviewing\n4Specifically, the court excluded arrestees with one or more prior con-\nvictions or two or more prior arrests for crimes involving drugs, weapons\nor violence within the prior five years. \n5On October 21, 2006 Defendants moved for reconsideration of portions\nof the district court’s August 30, 2005 Order that were unrelated to the\ncourt’s denial of qualified immunity for the Sheriff. Defendants simulta-\nneously appealed the denial of qualified immunity to this Court. This\nappeal was assigned Docket No. 05-17080. On February 23, 2006 the dis-\ntrict court issued an Amended Memorandum and Order Re: Motions for\nSummary Judgment. Defendants again appealed the denial of qualified\nimmunity to this Court. This second appeal was assigned Docket No. 06-\n15566.  On  April  26,  2006,  this  Court  issued  an  Order  consolidating\nappeals No. 05-17080 and 06-15566. \n\n11480 BULL  v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\na district court’s grant of summary judgment we must deter-\nmine, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\nnonmoving party, whether there are any genuine issues of\nmaterial fact and whether the district court correctly applied\nthe relevant substantive law. Olsen v. Idaho State Bd. of Med.,\n363 F.3d 916, 922 (9th Cir. 2004). \nTo determine whether a government employee is entitled to\nqualified immunity, we use a two-part test. Saucier v. Katz,\n533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001). First, we must determine whether,\nviewing the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,\nthe government employees violated the plaintiff’s constitu-\ntional rights. Id. Then, if we determine that a constitutional\nviolation has occurred, we must determine whether the rights\nwere clearly established at the time of the violation. Id.\nA\nWe turn first to the question of whether a policy of strip\nsearching arrestees solely because they are classified for hous-\ning in the general population, in the absence of any reasonable\nsuspicion, violates the arrestees’ constitutional rights. Follow-\ning a long history of precedent, we conclude that it clearly\ndoes. \n[1] In the first case to raise the question, Giles v. Ackerman,\n746 F.2d 614 (9th Cir. 1984) (per curiam), overruled on other\ngrounds by Hodgers-Durgin v. de la Vina, 199 F.3d 1037,\n1040 n.1 (9th Cir. 1999) (en banc), we announced the govern-\ning standard that “arrestees for minor offenses may be sub-\njected to a strip search only if jail officials have a reasonable\nsuspicion that the particular arrestee is carrying or concealing\ncontraband or suffering from a communicable disease.” Id. at\n615.6 \n6The dissent’s suggestion that this standard was stated in dicta is disin-\ngenuous. The full text of the sentence quoted above is as follows: “We\nhold that arrestees for minor offenses may be subjected to a strip search\n\nBULL  v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO 11481\n[2]  We  have  revisited  pre-arraignment  searches  several\ntimes, on each occasion reaffirming the individualized reason-\nable suspicion standard laid out in Giles. In Ward v. County\nof San Diego, 791 F.2d 1329 (9th Cir. 1986), we found no\nqualified immunity for a San Diego County Sheriff who had\nenacted a blanket strip search policy which resulted in the\nvisual body cavity search of a misdemeanor arrestee prior to\na determination regarding the arrestee’s eligibility for an own\nrecognizance release. In Thompson v. City of Los Angeles,\n885 F.2d 1439 (9th Cir. 1989), we held that the strip search\nof a person arrested for felony grand theft auto was valid\nbecause the charge was “sufficiently associated with violence\nto justify a visual strip search.” Id. at 1447. The next year,\nhowever, we held unconstitutional the City of Los Angeles’s\nblanket  strip  search  policy  which  subjected  all  felony\narrestees to a visual body cavity search. Kennedy v. Los Ange-\nles Police Dept., 901 F.2d 702, 714 (9th Cir. 1990), abrogated\non other grounds by Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224 (1991)\n(per curiam). In Kennedy, we emphasized that while a charge\nof a violent offense, such as the charge in Thompson, may jus-\ntify a strip search, the mere fact of a felony charge bears no\nreasonable relationship to institutional security concerns. Id.\nat 713 (“[T]he enacted policy, if it is to be constitutional, must\nbe ‘reasonably related’ to the penal institution’s interest in\nmaintaining security.”). In short, under controlling circuit pre-\ncedent, a blanket strip search of pre-arraignment arrestees, no\nmatter how minor the offense and in absence of reasonable\nsuspicion, violates the Constitution. \nDefendants argue that San Francisco’s policy is constitu-\ntional under Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979), in which\nonly if jail officials have a reasonable suspicion that the particular arrestee\nis carrying or concealing contraband or suffering from a communicable\ndisease.” Giles, 746 F.2d at 615 (emphasis added). The dissent may dislike\nthe holding in Giles but there is no reasonable dispute that the above state-\nment is the holding, not mere dicta. \n\n11482 BULL  v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\nthe Supreme Court addressed a strip search policy applied to\nprisoners and pre-trial detainees. However, Bell pre-dated the\npre-arraignment cases in our circuit, which carefully consid-\nered and distinguished Bell. \n[3] In Bell the Supreme Court held that strip and visual\nbody cavity searches may, in certain instances, be conducted\non  prisoners  and  pretrial  detainees  in  institutional  settings\nwith less than probable cause. 441 U.S. at 560. In determining\nwhether an institutional search policy is reasonable under the\nFourth Amendment, a court must balance “the need for the\nparticular search against the invasion of personal rights that\nthe search entails.” Id. at 559. In each case, a court “must con-\nsider  the  scope  of  the  particular  intrusion,  the  manner  in\nwhich it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the\nplace in which it is conducted.” Id. Giles, Ward, Thompson,\nand Kennedy were each decided subsequent to, and with the\nbenefit of, the Supreme Court’s holding in Bell. \nDefendants also argue that San Francisco’s strip search pol-\nicy was justified by the fact that the arrestees were to be trans-\nferred for housing in the general jail population, noting that\nthe introduction of contraband to the general population raises\nserious security concerns. However, we have previously made\nclear that although the fact that an arrestee is to be “placed\ninto contact with the general jail population” is one important\nfactor among many that may be considered in gauging the\nreasonableness of a search, “such a factor by itself cannot jus-\ntify a strip search.” Thompson, 885 F.2d at 1447; see also\nGiles, 746 F.2d at 618-19 (rejecting the notion that placement\nin the general jail population was enough to validate a strip\nsearch because “intermingling is both limited and avoidable”).\n[4] “The intrusiveness of a body-cavity search cannot be\noverstated.” Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 711. To justify such a “de-\nhumanizing and humiliating,” id., invasion of privacy, there\nmust  be  some  reasonable  relationship  between  the  criteria\nused to identify the specific individuals eligible for a strip\n\nBULL  v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO 11483\nsearch and the interest in preventing the introduction of con-\ntraband. See Giles, 746 F.2d at 618 (reasonableness require-\nment  under  the  Fourth  Amendment  requires  that  the  strip\nsearch bear some “discernible relationship to security needs”\n(quoting  Logan  v.  Shealy,  660  F.2d  1007,  1013  (4th  Cir.\n1981))); see also Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 713 (stressing the\nimportance  of  documentation  supporting  the  assertion  that\narrestees within the strip search category smuggle contraband\ninto the jail in greater frequency than arrestees outside of the\ncategory). We have consistently noted that factors to be con-\nsidered in determining whether reasonable suspicion exists to\nwarrant a strip search include “the nature of the offense, the\narrestee’s  appearance  and  conduct,  and  the  prior  arrest\nrecord.” Giles, 746 F.2d at 617; see also Thompson, 885 F.2d\nat 1446. \n[5] The challenged portion of San Francisco’s policy did\nnot consider such individualized factors and required strip\nsearches of arrestees based solely on their classification for\nhousing  in  the  general  population.  Defendants  nonetheless\nargue that the present case is distinguishable from our long\nline of precedent because they have produced substantial doc-\numentary evidence of the significant problem of contraband\nin the general population of San Francisco jails. The district\ncourt carefully examined the tendered evidence and found that\nDefendants proffered no evidence demonstrating smuggling\nby  individuals  who  would  qualify  for  membership  in  the\nplaintiff class. Defendants argue that the record “established\nthat  many  detainees  charged  with  minor  offenses  tried  to\nsmuggle contraband into jail.” However, both Plaintiffs and\nthe district court correctly point out that of the numerous inci-\ndents of discovered contraband documented by Defendants\nand presented to the district court, none clearly documents a\nsingle uncontroverted instance of a class member smuggling\ncontraband into a San Francisco facility. \nSeveral of the documented searches were based on permis-\nsible factors and the documentation for the remaining inci-\n\n11484 BULL  v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\ndents does not contain any evidence relating either to the\nreason  for  the  search  or  the  arrestee’s  eligibility  for  class\nmembership.  To  review,  the  class  certified  by  the  district\ncourt includes arrestees who were arrested for an offense not\ninvolving drugs, weapons, violence, or a violation of parole\nor probation; who did not have a criminal history involving\ndrugs,  weapons,  or  violence;  and  whose  behavior  did  not\ncreate individualized suspicion warranting a search. The two\nincidents cited by the Defendants illustrate the deficiency of\ntheir documentation. First, Defendants point to an incident on\nNovember 19, 2003 in which a man who was arrested on a\nwarrant for maintaining a public nuisance was found smug-\ngling a plastic bag of suspected cocaine powder into the jail.\nThe documentation of this incident in the record consists of\nan Incident Report and a Field Arrest Card. Neither document\nindicates  whether  the  arrestee  had  a  criminal  history  that\nwould legitimize the search or whether there was any other\nindividualized  suspicion  that  would  legitimize  the  search.\nWithout  more  information,  it  is  impossible  to  determine\nwhether this particular arrestee would be eligible for class\nmembership. Second, Defendants contend that a strip search\nof an arrestee, who was not charged with drugs, weapons or\nviolence offenses, uncovered an 8-inch pair of scissors. The\nonly documentation in the record of this incident is a Contra-\nband  Form.  The  Contraband  Form  does  not  indicate  the\ncharges on which this individual was arrested, the individual’s\ncriminal history, or whether there was any individualized sus-\npicion that prompted the search. It is impossible to tell from\nthe record whether or not this individual is in fact an eligible\nmember of the class. In short, Defendants’ claim that they\nhave documented instances of eligible class members engag-\ning in smuggling contraband is not credible and not supported\nby the record.7 \n7Because Defendants did not actually produce sufficient evidence, with\nrespect to either of these incidents, to establish whether or not the searched\nindividuals were eligible class members, we need not consider whether\nonly two documented incidents would be sufficient to justify the policy.\n\nBULL  v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO 11485\nThe incidents cited by the dissent similarly fail to demon-\nstrate even a single occurrence of a strip search uncovering\ncontraband from an eligible class member. Of the twelve inci-\ndents cited by the dissent, two did not even involve strip\nsearches,8  and  three  others  involved  arrestees  who  were\ndemonstrably ineligible for class membership because they\nwere arrested on parole violation or drug charges. The docu-\nmentation for the remaining seven incidents fails to include\nany information regarding the arrestees’ criminal history or\nwhether the arrestees did anything to create individualized\nsuspicion warranting a strip search. \n[6] As the district court concluded, the reports the defen-\ndant produced regarding the discovery of contraband during\nstrip searches consistently fail to provide any indication of the\ncharges of the searched individuals or the reason why they\nwere searched. Absent such evidence, it is impossible for us\nto know whether or not eligible class members are contribut-\ning at all—much less in any significant way—to the contra-\nband problem in the San Francisco jails. As such, we cannot\nconclude that there is any reasonable relationship between the\ncriteria triggering a search (classification for housing) and the\ninterest in conducting the search (eliminating the introduction\nof contraband). \n[7] In sum, controlling precedent holds that blanket strip\nsearches of pre-arraignment detainees regardless of severity\nof charge and without reasonable suspicion are unconstitu-\ntional. The district court properly concluded that the evidence\ntendered by Defendants was insufficient to distinguish this\ncase from our long line of precedent based on case-specific\ncircumstances. \n8In one incident contraband was found in an arrestee’s shoe, in the other\ncontraband was found in the arrestee’s mouth. Neither a search of a shoe\nnor of the inside of a person’s mouth qualifies as a strip search. \n\n11486 BULL  v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\nB\nWe turn next to the question of whether the right violated\nby  Defendants  was  clearly  established  at  the  time  of  the\nsearch. See Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201. “The relevant, disposi-\ntive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly estab-\nlished is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that\nhis conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.” Id.\nat 202. In other words, the inquiry is whether a reasonable\nperson could have believed his actions lawful at the time they\nwere undertaken. Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 646\n(1987). \nWe  have  made  clear  that  the  responsibility  for  keeping\nabreast of constitutional developments in criminal law falls\nsquarely  on  the  shoulders  of  law  enforcement  officials.\n“Given the power of such officials over our liberty, and some-\ntimes even over our lives, this placement of responsibility is\nentirely proper. Law enforcement officials must be cognizant\nnot only of how far their authority extends, but also of the\npoint at which their authority ends.” Ward, 791 F.2d at 1332.\n[8] San Francisco’s challenged strip search policy was in\nplace until January 2004. Well before that time, as we have\ndiscussed, it was clearly established in this Circuit that con-\nducting  strip  searches  of  pre-arraignment  arrestees  based\nsolely on the fact that they were assigned for transfer to the\ngeneral  population  was  unconstitutional.  We  have  consis-\ntently required consideration of individual factors, such as\narrest charges, criminal history, and suspicious behavior, to\njustify strip searches of pre-arraignment arrestees. Indeed, in\nan unbroken line of precedent tracing back to 1984, we have\naffirmed and reaffirmed the fundamental holding of Giles that\na strip search of a pre-arraignment detainee must be supported\nby reasonable individualized suspicion. It was also abundantly\nclear after Thompson that placement in the general jail popu-\nlation “by itself cannot justify a strip search.” Thompson, 885\nF.2d at 1447. \n\nBULL  v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO 11487\n[9] Moreover, we have explicitly stated several times that\nit has been clearly established that strip search policies similar\nto San Francisco’s are unconstitutional. In Ward, we con-\ncluded that “the law was sufficiently clear in early 1981 so as\nto expose a public official who unreasonably authorized blan-\nket strip searches of minor offense arrestees to civil liability\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983.” 791 F.2d at 1332 (emphasis added).\nAlthough San Francisco’s policy included arrestees charged\nwith more serious offenses than those at issue in Ward, the\npolicy by definition also applied to minor offense arrestees,\nsuch  as  those  at  issue  in  Ward.  San  Francisco’s  policy\nrequired strip searches of all arrestees who were classified for\ntransfer to the general population. Arrestees are “classified” if\nthey  cannot  post  bail.  Because  some  minor  offenses  do\nrequire bail, any minor offense arrestee who was required to\npost bail but was unable (or unable to post soon enough)\nwould  be  strip  searched  under  San  Francisco’s  policy.  As\nWard points out, we have long since established that strip\nsearches of such individuals, in absence of individualized sus-\npicion, is unconstitutional.9 \nDistrict courts in this circuit have also consistently recog-\nnized that the law in this circuit has clearly established that\nstrip search policies like the one challenged here are unconstitu-\ntional.10 See, e.g., Craft v. County of San Bernardino, 468\n9Again, in 1993 we reiterated: \nAt  the  time  Appellants  strip  searched  the  Appellees,  it  was\nclearly established in this circuit that it is unlawful to strip search\nan arrestee brought to a jail facility on charges of committing a\nminor offense, unless the officer directing the search possesses “a\nreasonable suspicion that the individual arrestee is carrying or\nconcealing contraband.” Reasonable suspicion may be based on\n“such factors as the nature of the offense, the arrestee’s appear-\nance and conduct, and the prior arrest record.” \nAct Up!/Portland v. Bagley, 988 F.2d 868, 871-72 (9th Cir. 1993) (quot-\ning Giles, 746 F.2d at 617) (internal citations and footnote omitted). \n10Defendants cite Johannes v. Alameda County Sheriff’s Dept., 2006\nWL 2504400, *12 (N.D. Cal. 2006) to argue that the state of the law in\n\n11488 BULL  v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\nF.Supp.2d 1172, 1177 (C.D. Cal. 2006) (“At the outset, it is\nworth noting that the Ninth Circuit has clearly recognized that\narrestees’  intermingling  with  other  detained  persons  can\nimpact upon whether a given strip and/or visual body cavity\nsearch is constitutionally permissible, but it cannot, by itself,\nprovide  justification  for  such  a  search  .  .  .”)  (citing\nThompson,  885  at  1447);  Wong  v.  Beebe,  2002  WL\n31548486, *15 (D. Or. 2002)11 (“[W]ell before [arrestee’s]\nstrip and cavity search, it was clear that blanket strip search\npolicies are unconstitutional if justified by nothing more than\nan arrest on suspicion of the commission of a felony or a\nplanned confinement in the general jail population.”) (citing\nKennedy, 901 F.2d at 713-15; Thompson, 885 F.2d at 1446-\n47); Silvia v. Clackamas County, 2001 WL 34039482, *4 (D.\nOr. 2001) (“Well before [arrestee’s] strip and cavity search,\nit was clear that blanket strip search policies justified by noth-\ning more than arrest on suspicion of the commission of a fel-\nony or a planned confinement in the general jail population\nare  unconstitutional.”)  (citing  Fuller  v.  M.G.  Jewelry,  950\nF.2d 1437, 1445-46 (9th Cir. 1991); Kennedy, 901 F.2d at\n713-15; Thompson, 885 F.2d at 1446-47). \nDefendants argue that the large amount of documentary\nevidence  they  have  produced  shows  that  the  problem  of\nsmuggled contraband is particularly acute in the San Fran-\ncisco jails and thus distinguishes this case from others. Fur-\nther,  defendants  argue  that  because  no  other  case  has\nthis circuit was not clearly established. However, the district court opinion\nin Johannes does not suggest that a policy such as San Francisco’s policy\nmight be constitutionally permissible. The Johannes court analyzed a strip\nsearch policy as applied to an individual plaintiff and did not express an\nopinion about the constitutionality of the policy on its face. The court con-\ncluded that, among other factors, Johannes’ lengthy criminal history pro-\nvided a valid basis for a strip search. Here, arrestees with similar criminal\nhistories are not included in the class. \n11In determining whether a particular right was clearly established, we\nmay also look to unpublished district court decisions. Sorrels v. McKee,\n290 F.3d 965, 971 (9th Cir. 2002). \n\nBULL  v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO 11489\nconfronted  such  a  well-documented  problem,  even  if  San\nFrancisco’s  policy  was  unconstitutional,  the  law  was  not\nclearly established. In deciding whether the law was clearly\nestablished, “[i]t is not necessary that the alleged acts have\nbeen previously held unconstitutional, as long as the unlaw-\nfulness [of the defendants’ actions] was apparent in light of\npreexisting law.” Malik v. Brown, 71 F.3d 724, 727 (9th Cir.\n1995).  “Closely  analogous  preexisting  case  law  is  not\nrequired to show that a right was clearly established.” White\nv. Lee, 227 F.3d 1214, 1238 (9th Cir. 2000). The specific facts\nof previous cases need not be materially or fundamentally\nsimilar to the situation in question; rather, the salient question\nis whether the state of the law at the time gives officials fair\nwarning that their conduct is unconstitutional. Hope v. Pelzer,\n536 U.S. 730, 742 (2002). \n[10] We have made it clear that in the Ninth Circuit strip\nsearches of pre-arraignment arrestees are unconstitutional in\nthe absence of reasonable individualized suspicion and that\nreasonable suspicion requires consideration of factors such as\nthe nature of the offense, the arrestee’s appearance and con-\nduct, and the arrestee’s criminal history. See, e.g., Act Up!,\n988 F.2d at 871-72; Edgerly, 495 F.3d at 657. Moreover, we\nhave made it clear that placement in the general jail popula-\ntion “by itself cannot justify a strip search.” Thompson, 885\nF.2d at 1447. San Francisco’s policy was to strip search pre-\narraignment  arrestees  no  matter  how  trivial  the  offense\ncharged and without reasonable suspicion solely because they\nwere to be classified for housing in the general population.\nThat such a blanket policy is a clear violation of the Constitu-\ntion is clearly established by our precedent. \n[11] The fact that San Francisco had documented a signifi-\ncant problem of contraband smuggling does not muddy the\nclarity of the law. The evidence Defendants produced to the\ndistrict court shows only that contraband smuggling was a\nsignificant problem in San Francisco jails; it does not demon-\nstrate that persons eligible for inclusion in the class in this\n\n11490 BULL  v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\ncase contributed significantly, or even at all, to that problem.12\nTherefore, San Franciso’s policy, and its justifications for that\npolicy, are not different enough from policies that we have\nheld unconstitutional, to suggest that the rights violated by\nSan Francisco’s policy were not clearly established. For these\nreasons, Sheriff Hennessey is not entitled to qualified immu-\nnity. \nIII\nIn conclusion we emphasize that our holding in no way pre-\nvents  correctional  facilities  from  strip  searching  inmates\nunder  permissible  circumstances.  Indeed,  we  do  not  today\neven discuss the rights of those who are incarcerated after\nhaving been convicted of a criminal offense. This case con-\ncerns  only  pre-trial  arrestees.  Moreover,  strip  searches  of\narrestees on the basis of their arrest for an offense involving\ndrugs,  weapons,  violence,  or  a  violation  of  probation  or\nparole; criminal history involving drugs, weapons or violence\nas specified by the district court; or another factor creating\nindividualized suspicion are not affected by our holding, as\nthese arrestees are excluded from the certified class. However,\na policy of strip searching arrestees based solely on their clas-\nsification for housing in the general population violates the\narrestees’ clearly established constitutional rights, and we thus\naffirm the district court’s denial of qualified immunity. \nAFFIRMED.\nIKUTA Circuit Judge, concurring: \nI  concur  in  the  majority’s  opinion  with  reluctance  and\ngrave concern. While compelled by Ninth Circuit case law,\nthe disposition is in tension with Supreme Court precedent.\n12See supra Part II.A. \n\nBULL  v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO 11491\nMoreover, by disregarding the jail administrators’ urgent con-\ncerns about a serious contraband smuggling problem, I agree\nwith the dissent that we are potentially putting lives in the San\nFrancisco detention system at risk. \nA\nIn Bell v. Wolfish, the Court established basic principles for\nanalyzing the constitutionality of “restrictions and practices\nthat were designed to promote security and order” at a deten-\ntion facility. 441 U.S. 520, 544 (1979). The Court made clear\nthat  a  detainee’s  constitutional  rights  may  be  limited  or\nretracted  to  further  the  goal  of  “maintaining  institutional\nsecurity and preserving internal order and discipline.” Id. at\n546. Because of the fundamental importance of internal secur-\nity within a detention facility, “even when an institutional\nrestriction infringes a specific constitutional guarantee . . . the\npractice must be evaluated in the light of the central objective\nof prison administration, safeguarding institutional security.”\nId. at 546-47. Courts must accord “wide-ranging deference”\nto the judgment of detention facility administrators “in the\nadoption and execution of policies and practices that in their\njudgment are needed to preserve internal order and discipline\nand to maintain institutional security.” Id. at 547. Further, “in\nthe absence of substantial evidence in the record to indicate\nthat the officials have exaggerated their response to these con-\nsiderations, courts should ordinarily defer to their expert judg-\nment in such matters.” Id. at 548 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). \nApplying  these  principles  to  the  petitioners’  Fourth\nAmendment challenge, the Court upheld the detention facili-\nty’s policy of conducting a body-cavity search after a detainee\nhad a contact visit with a person outside the facility. The\nCourt made clear that a fact-intensive balancing test is neces-\nsary to determine whether a practice is reasonable for Fourth\nAmendment purposes: \n\n11492 BULL  v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amend-\nment is not capable of precise definition or mechani-\ncal application. In each case it requires a balancing\nof the need for the particular search against the inva-\nsion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts\nmust consider [1] the scope of the particular intru-\nsion, [2] the manner in which it is conducted, [3] the\njustification  for  initiating  it,  and  [4]  the  place  in\nwhich it is conducted. \nId. at 559 (bracketed numbers added). While acknowledging\nthat a body cavity search is intrusive, and that searches may\non occasion be conducted in an abusive fashion, the Court\nfocused primarily on the third and fourth factors: the unique\nnature of a detention facility, which is “fraught with serious\nsecurity dangers,” id., and the central importance of maintain-\ning the institution’s security, which is a key principle in ana-\nlyzing  all  constitutional  challenges  to  detention  facility\npolicies and practices, id. at 546-47. The Court then readily\nconcluded, after “[b]alancing the significant and legitimate\nsecurity interests of the institution against the privacy interests\nof the inmates,” that the detention facility’s practice was rea-\nsonable under the Fourth Amendment. Id. at 560. \nIn reaching this conclusion, the Court rejected the Second\nCircuit’s analysis, which had focused on whether there was\nsufficient evidence that detainees had smuggled contraband\ninto the facility. Because the administrators “proved only one\ninstance in the [detention facility’s] short history where con-\ntraband was found during a body-cavity search,” the Second\nCircuit had held that the “gross violation of personal privacy\ninherent in such a search cannot be outweighed by the govern-\nment’s security interest in maintaining a practice of so little\nactual utility.” Id. at 558 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nBy contrast, the Court concluded that the lack of evidence of\nactual contraband smuggling was of little import. Id. at 559.\n\nBULL  v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO 11493\nB\nIn this suit against the City and County of San Francisco,\nBell  requires  us  to  balance  “the  significant  and  legitimate\nsecurity interests of the institution” against the privacy rights\nof the plaintiff class of pre-arraignment detainees. See id. at\n560. As we have noted, the “intrusiveness of a body-cavity\nsearch  cannot  be  overstated.  Strip  searches  involving  the\nvisual  exploration  of  body  cavities  is  dehumanizing  and\nhumiliating.” Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Dept., 901 F.2d\n702,  711  (9th  Cir.  1990),  abrogated  on  other  grounds  by\nHunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224 (1991). On the other hand, as\ncorrectly noted by the dissent, San Francisco has presented “a\ncompelling record of dangerous smuggling activity” indicat-\ning that there is a “pervasive problem that imposes a serious\nsecurity risk endangering both jail inmates and jail employ-\nees.” Dissent at 11498. San Francisco has emphasized that its\nstrip search policy is needed to help mitigate the smuggling\nproblems in the jail population. In considering whether the\npolicy was reasonable, we must defer to the judgment of the\njail administrators. See Bell, 441 U.S. at 547. If we did so, and\nthereby  followed  the  directive  of  the  Supreme  Court,  we\nwould be compelled to uphold the strip search policy as rea-\nsonable given the substantial evidence in the record illustrat-\ning the dire security needs facing the facility. \nBut Ninth Circuit precedent has wandered far from Bell, as\nthe dissent points out. Beginning in 1984 with Giles v. Acker-\nman,  746  F.2d  614  (9th  Cir.  1984),  overruled  on  other\ngrounds by Hodgers-Durgin v. de la Vina, 199 F.3d 1037 (9th\nCir. 1999) (en banc), we disregarded Bell’s direction to give\nthe detention facility administrator’s needs for “safeguarding\ninstitutional  security”  exceptional  weight  in  determining\nwhether a search policy is reasonable. See Bell, 441 U.S. at\n547. Instead, we held that a strip search of an arrrestee for a\nminor offense was not constitutionally reasonable unless jail\nofficials had a specific basis for suspecting that individual of\nsmuggling.  Giles,  746  F.2d  at  615.  Rejecting  the  district\n\n11494 BULL  v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\ncourt’s conclusions and giving effectively no deference to the\njail officials’ views, we held as a matter of law that strip\nsearches of all arrestees booked into the jail at issue were “not\nnecessary to protect the institution’s security interest,” and\nthat “arrestees charged with minor offenses may be subjected\nto a strip search only if jail officials possess a reasonable sus-\npicion that the individual arrestee is carrying or concealing\ncontraband.” Id. at 617. \nAlthough Giles may have justified its conclusion on the\nbasis of appellate fact-finding specific to that case, i.e., that\nthe jail facility in that case did not present security concerns,\nthe Giles rule subsequently took on a life of its own. In Ken-\nnedy we concluded that the LAPD’s policy of conducting a\nstrip search of all felony arrestees violated the Fourth Amend-\nment. 901 F.2d at 710-14. Rather than give due weight to the\nLAPD’s concerns “for safety, security, and the proper admin-\nistration of the jail system,” id. at 713 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted), we faulted the LAPD for failing to present\nclass-specific  information,  stating  that  a  “glaring  omission\nfrom the LAPD’s justification is any documentation (or even\nassertion)  that  felony  arrestees  have  attempted  to  smuggle\ncontraband into the jail in greater frequency than misdemea-\nnor arrestees.” Id. at 713. Because the LAPD failed to adduce\nevidence regarding “the likelihood of the arrestee’s conceal-\ning drugs, weapons, or contraband,” id. at 714, we held that\nthe LAPD’s policy could not be “reasonably related to the\npenal institution’s interest in maintaining security,” id. at 713.\nSimilarly, in Thompson v. City of Los Angeles, 885 F.2d\n1439 (9th Cir. 1989), we considered the Los Angeles Coun-\nty’s policy to strip search all new admittees to the county jail,\nand held that the reasonableness of the search depended on\nwhether a specific arrestee’s offense was “sufficiently associ-\nated with violence to justify a visual strip search.” Id. at 1447.\nIn so holding, we rejected the County’s institutional concerns\nregarding placing individuals “into contact with the general\njail population,” stating as a matter of law that “such a factor\n\nBULL  v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO 11495\nby itself cannot justify a strip search” because “such intermin-\ngling is ‘both limited and avoidable.’ ” Id. (quoting Giles, 746\nF.2d at 618). \nIn each of these cases, we gave short shrift to Bell’s focus\non the centrality of institutional security concerns and to its\ninstruction to defer to detention facility officials’ judgment\n“in the absence of substantial evidence in the record to indi-\ncate that the officials have exaggerated their response to these\nconsiderations.”  Bell,  441  U.S.  at  548  (internal  quotation\nmarks omitted). Instead of balancing individual privacy con-\ncerns against the “significant and legitimate security interests\nof the institution,” id. at 560, we have focused almost exclu-\nsively on the question whether detention facility administra-\ntors have an adequate basis for suspecting that individuals\nmay be smuggling contraband. In doing so, we have essen-\ntially adopted the rationale of the Second Circuit, rejected by\nBell, which gave controlling weight to the lack of specific evi-\ndence of a smuggling problem. In sum, the Ninth Circuit’s\nbalancing test bears little relation to Bell’s. \nC\nApplying this circuit’s balancing test to the facts in this\ncase, we could uphold San Francisco’s blanket policy of strip\nsearching the plaintiff class of pre-arraignment detainees only\nif  San  Francisco  presented  some  basis  for  suspecting  that\nclass  of  smuggling  contraband.  Because  I  agree  with  the\nmajority that San Francisco has not adduced evidence of con-\ntraband smuggling specific to the plaintiff class, and because\nI am bound by circuit precedent, I must reluctantly concur in\nthe majority’s determination that the strip search policy was\nunconstitutional. See Cerrato v. San Francisco Cmty. Coll.\nDist., 26 F.3d 968, 972 n.15 (9th Cir. 1994) (“In the absence\nof an en banc reversal or an intervening Supreme Court deci-\nsion . . . we are bound by circuit law.”). Moreover, because\nour circuit precedent clearly mandates this result, I must also\n\n11496 BULL  v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\nconcur in the majority’s determination that Sheriff Hennessey\nis not entitled to qualified immunity. \nThis result, however, ignores San Francisco’s warnings that\nthe smuggling problems in the San Francisco detention sys-\ntem are grave. It also ignores the jail administrators’ determi-\nnation that mandatory strip searches of all persons entering\nthe general jail population are needed to address this problem.\nBy effectively eliminating such security concerns from our\ncalculus, we contradict Supreme Court precedent and com-\nmon sense and take upon ourselves a role unsuited for the\ncourts.  As  the  Supreme  Court  noted,  judges  must  guard\nagainst the all-too-human tendency “to believe that their indi-\nvidual solutions to often intractable problems are better and\nmore workable than those of the persons who are actually\ncharged with and trained in the running of the particular insti-\ntution under examination.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 562. Because we\nhave dangerously substituted our judgment for the judgment\nof jail administrators, a reconsideration of our case law is\nurgently needed.\nTALLMAN, Circuit Judge, dissenting: \nOur  ship  has  sailed  far  from  the  course  charted  by  the\nUnited States Supreme Court in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520\n(1979). During the three-year period between April 2000 and\nDecember  2003,  the  San  Francisco  Sheriff’s  Department\n(“San Francisco”) discovered over 1,000 items of contraband\nsmuggled into its general jail populations.1 In July 2005, an\n1The contraband was discovered during searches conducted by San\nFrancisco’s canine unit. Items found included: 662 pills of assorted con-\ntrolled substances; 106 shanks and weapons; 272 lighters and matches; 13\ntattoo needles; 45 finds of rock cocaine (totaling 42.88 grams); 3 finds of\ncocaine  powder  (totaling  2.75  grams);  10  finds  of  methamphetamine\n(totaling 6.70 grams); 40 finds of marijuana (totaling 71.93 grams); 18\nfinds of heroin (totaling 6.24 grams and 6.79 milliliters); 24 gallons of\n“pruno”; 4 hypodermic needles; and 4 ecstasy pills. \n\nBULL  v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO 11497\ninmate booked and classified at County Jail No. 9 died from\na cocaine overdose eleven days after he was transferred to\nCounty Jail No. 2 for housing in the general population. The\ninmate had been charged with felony domestic violence and\nviolating probation, and therefore was subject to a strip search\non admission to the booking facility under the Sheriff’s pol-\nicy. There is no record that drugs were found on this inmate\nduring intake. \nAs the empirical evidence from jail operations now shows,\nthe underlying rationale for Ninth Circuit decisions in this\narena  suffers  from  an  inherent  defect  in  basic  logic.  The\nassumption is that arrestees booked for only minor or non-\nviolent offenses who will not be promptly released and must\nbe housed with the general inmate population are unlikely to\nbe  carrying  concealed  contraband  or  dangerous  weapons.\nExperience teaches otherwise. The County’s2 smuggling prob-\nlem is not isolated to those inmates booked for crimes involv-\ning drugs, weapons, or violence. The record is replete with\nincidents  of  jail  officials  finding  contraband  during  strip\nsearches of individuals arrested for “minor offenses”: public\ndrunkenness, public nuisance, loitering with intent to prosti-\ntute, knowingly receiving stolen property, petty theft with a\nprior offense, etc.3 \n2I refer to the City and County of San Francisco collectively as “the\nCounty.” Arrestees may include those taken into custody by law enforce-\nment agencies including the San Francisco Police Department and the\nSheriff’s Department. \n3Some of this information was taken from the record filed in a case\ninvolving a similar challenge to the same strip search policy, Yourke v.\nCity and County of San Francisco, No. 06-16450. Yourke was dismissed\nprior to oral argument for lack of jurisdiction. We granted San Francisco’s\nmotion to take judicial notice of portions of the Yourke record on appeal.\nAccordingly, the record we now consider includes additional Sheriff’s\nDepartment documents of smuggling incidents that supplement the Bull\nrecord. Together, these records paint a bleak picture of responsible County\nJail officials struggling to adhere to ever stricter court decisions while\nvainly trying to keep everyone safe from harm. \n\n11498 BULL  v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\nWe have never before been presented with such a compel-\nling record of dangerous smuggling activity. San Francisco\nhas demonstrated beyond cavil that the smuggling of drugs,\nweapons, and other contraband into the general jail population\nis a common and pervasive problem that imposes a serious\nsecurity risk endangering both jail inmates and jail employ-\nees. While acknowledging the existence of this evidence, the\nmajority extends Ninth Circuit restrictions and adopts a per se\nrule requiring reasonable suspicion to strip search a pretrial\ndetainee transferred into the general population for housing\nwho does not otherwise meet the category of arrestees the\nmajority approves for strip-searching. But the newly-minted\nrule runs contrary to Supreme Court precedent, impedes jail\nadministration,  and  further  endangers  the  safety  of  jail\ninmates and employees. Because I would conclude that San\nFrancisco’s policy of strip searching every arrestee transferred\ninto its general jail population for housing is reasonable under\nthe Fourth Amendment, I would find no constitutional viola-\ntion from the strip search policy. I would also reverse the dis-\ntrict court’s denial of qualified immunity to Sheriff Michael\nHennessey. I therefore respectfully dissent. \nI\nIn Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979), the Supreme Court\nconsidered the constitutionality of New York’s Metropolitan\nCorrectional  Center’s  (“MCC”)  policy  of  strip  searching\ninmates following any contact visit with a person from out-\nside the institution. Id. at 523, 528, 558-60. To support the\npolicy,  “[c]orrections  officials  testified  that  visual  cavity\nsearches were necessary not only to discover but also to deter\nthe smuggling of weapons, drugs, and other contraband into\nthe institution.” Id. at 558. During the policy’s “short history”\nonly  one  body-cavity  search  resulted  in  contraband  being\nfound. Id. \nThe Supreme Court nevertheless “[b]alanc[ed] the signifi-\ncant and legitimate security interests of the institution against\n\nBULL  v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO 11499\nthe privacy interests of the inmates” and held that the “visual\nbody-cavity inspections . . . contemplated by the MCC rules\ncan . . . be conducted on less than probable cause.” Id. at 560.\nEven though the Court could “not underestimate the degree to\nwhich  these  searches  may  invade  the  personal  privacy  of\ninmates,” it concluded that the institution’s compelling secur-\nity  interests  justified  the  invasion  of  personal  rights  that\nresulted. Id. at 559-60. As the Court explains: \nA detention facility is a unique place fraught with\nserious  security  dangers.  Smuggling  of  money,\ndrugs, weapons, and other contraband is all too com-\nmon an occurrence. And inmate attempts to secrete\nthese items into the facility by concealing them in\nbody cavities are documented in this record, and in\nother cases. That there has been only one instance\nwhere an MCC inmate was discovered attempting to\nsmuggle contraband into the institution on his person\nmay be more a testament to the effectiveness of this\nsearch technique as a deterrent than to any lack of\ninterest on the part of the inmates to secrete and\nimport such items when the opportunity arises. \nId. at 559 (citations omitted). \nSubsequent to Bell, we have considered several other strip\nsearch policies, yet at no time have we considered a record as\nfully developed and complete as that provided by San Fran-\ncisco in support of its policy. In Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d\n614 (9th Cir. 1984) (per curiam), overruled on other grounds\nby Hodgers-Durgin v. de la Vina, 199 F.3d 1037, 1040 n.1\n(9th Cir. 1999) (en banc), we held “that arrestees for minor\noffenses may be subjected to a strip search only if jail offi-\ncials have a reasonable suspicion.” Id. at 615. The Giles panel\npurported to follow Bell by claiming to balance “the security\nneeds of [the] local jail facilities against the privacy interests\nof arrestees charged with minor offenses.” Id. at 617. Unlike\nBell, however, Giles concluded that the Idaho county failed to\n\n11500 BULL  v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\ndemonstrate  that  its  security  interests  justified  the  serious\ninvasion of privacy created by its policy. Id. at 617. \nThe record reveals that the incidence of smuggling\nactivity at the Bonneville County Jail is minimal.\nEvidence  before  the  trial  court  indicates  that  of\napproximately 3,500 persons searched at the jail in\nthe preceding 18-month period, only eleven persons\nhad  concealed  anything  that  warranted  a  report,\nincluding  the  concealment  of  cigarettes.  [The\ncounty] cite[d] as significant only one discovery in\nthe course of 3,500 strip searches: a knife was found\ncradled in the small of the back of an arrestee. [The\ncounty] also cite[d] two instances from other parts of\nthe  country  (California  and  Mississippi)  in  which\nmatches were concealed on the person of detainees.\nId. \nBased on the Idaho record, we also concluded that there\nwas no sign “whatsoever that the County’s strip search policy\ncould or did have any deterrent effect.” Id. We noted that “ar-\nrest  and  confinement  in  the  Bonneville  County  Jail  are\nunplanned  events,  so  the  policy  could  not  possibly  deter\narrestees from carrying contraband.” Id. Based on this record,\nwe rejected the county’s argument that the search was justi-\nfied by the fact that Giles had been placed in the general jail\npopulation. Id. at 618-19 (“[The county’s] heavy reliance on\nthe intermingling of its temporary detainees with the general\n[jail] population is misplaced . . . because such intermingling\nis  both  limited  and  avoidable.”  (internal  quotation  marks\nomitted; second alteration in original)). \nWe reached a similar conclusion in Kennedy v. Los Angeles\nPolice Department, 901 F.2d 702 (9th Cir. 1990), abrogated\non other grounds by Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224 (1991)\n(per curiam). There, we found unconstitutional the Los Ange-\nles  Police  Department’s  (“LAPD”)  policy  subjecting  all\n\nBULL  v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO 11501\narrestees on suspicion of having committed a felony to a strip\nsearch, whether or not they were transferred to the general jail\npopulation. Id. at 710, 713-14. We found no justification for\ntreating  felony  arrestees  any  differently  than  misdemeanor\narrestees, who were subject to a strip search only upon rea-\nsonable suspicion. Id. at 714. There was simply no reasonable\nrelationship between the strip search and the LAPD’s alleged\nsecurity needs because the LAPD failed to provide “any docu-\nmentation  (or  even  assertion)  that  felony  arrestees  have\nattempted to smuggle contraband into the jail in greater fre-\nquency than misdemeanor arrestees.” Id. at 713. \nThe majority cites Giles as well as Thompson v. City of Los\nAngeles, 885 F.2d 1439, 1447 (9th Cir. 1989), for the proposi-\ntion that contact with the general jail population itself can\nnever justify a strip search. Maj. Op. at 11481-83. However,\nneither case addressed a record as persuasive as that presented\nby San Francisco, and both cases based their holdings on sep-\narate  legal  grounds,  making  their  broad  pronouncements\ndicta.  As  discussed  supra,  our  prior  holding  in  Giles  was\nbased primarily on the Bonneville County Jail’s failure to pro-\nvide evidence to prove it had security concerns that warranted\nsuch a severe invasion of privacy. See 746 F.2d at 617. With-\nout a full and complete record, we were in no position to\ndetermine as a matter of law that placement in a general jail\npopulation could never by itself justify a strip search. “Where\nit is clear that a statement is made casually and without analy-\nsis, where the statement is uttered in passing without due con-\nsideration of the alternatives, or where it is merely a prelude\nto another legal issue that commands the panel’s full atten-\ntion,” such a statement may be considered dicta. United States\nv. Johnson, 256 F.3d 895, 915 (9th Cir. 2001) (en banc) (Koz-\ninski, J.); cf. United States v. Ingham, 486 F.3d 1068, 1078\nn.8 (9th Cir. 2007) (concluding that the court’s decisions on\nex post facto principles was not dicta when the court provided\na “careful three-page” analysis). The same holds true for our\nanalysis in Thompson. With absolutely no discussion of the\nrecord, we cited Giles and simply stated that “contact with the\n\n11502 BULL  v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\ngeneral jail population . . . by itself cannot justify a strip\nsearch.” Thompson, 885 F.2d at 1447. However, that state-\nment was not central to our holding, see Sanchez v. Mukasey,\n521 F.3d 1106, 1110 (9th Cir. 2008) (discussing what consti-\ntutes dictum), as we went on to conclude that the city’s search\nin Thompson was nevertheless justified by reasonable suspi-\ncion. See Thompson, 885 F.2d at 1447.4 \nNow, with a full and complete record, we are squarely con-\nfronted with the question of whether transfer into the general\njail population alone can justify a strip search.5 Never has the\nSupreme Court required reasonable suspicion of weapons or\ncontraband to justify a strip search of pretrial detainees bound\n4Contrary to the majority’s statement, I do not contend that the follow-\ning holding in Giles is dicta: “arrestees for minor offenses may be sub-\njected to a strip search only if jail officials have a reasonable suspicion\nthat the particular arrestee is carrying or concealing contraband or suffer-\ning from a communicable disease.” See Maj. Op. 11480-81 n.6. Although\nI may have decided Giles differently, I nevertheless respect the decision’s\nprecedential value. Unlike the majority, however, I think the panel in Giles\nunnecessarily went beyond the question presented when it stated that con-\ntact with the general jail population alone can never justify a strip search.\nThis was a blanket conclusion without any analysis. Without a full and\ncomplete record the court could not give due consideration to the issue.\nWhether contact with the general jail population alone can ever justify a\nstrip search when the County here has trenchantly documented a pervasive\nsmuggling problem therefore remains an open question. \n5I must emphasize that San Francisco’s policy did not require the strip\nsearch of every arrestee brought into County Jail No. 9. San Francisco’s\npolicy required only the search of those inmates who were classified for\nhousing and were going to be transferred into the general jail population.\nTherefore, the other cases relied on by the majority are similarly distin-\nguishable as they do not involve arrestees subsequently transferred to the\ngeneral population for housing. See Ward v. County of San Diego, 791\nF.2d 1329, 1333 (9th Cir. 1985) (finding unconstitutional a blanket strip\nsearch policy that allowed officials to search a detainee before a determi-\nnation was made that she could be released on her own recognizance); Act\nUp!/Portland v. Bagley, 988 F.2d 868, 871-72 (9th Cir. 1993) (holding\nthat it was clearly established law as of 1989 that “it is unlawful to strip\nsearch an arrestee brought to a jail facility on charges of committing a\nminor offense”). \n\nBULL  v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO 11503\nfor  the  general  prison  population.6  See  Bell,  441  U.S.  at\n559-60; see also Evans v. Stephens, 407 F.3d 1272, 1278-79\n(11th Cir. 2005) (en banc); id. at 1285-86 (Carnes, J., spe-\ncially concurring). While other circuits have held that transfer\ninto the general population on a misdemeanor charge without\nmore is insufficient to justify a strip search, see Evans, 407\nF.3d  at  1285  (Carnes,  J.,  specially  concurring)  (collecting\ncases),7 at least one of those circuits has openly questioned its\nreasoning. \nIn Evans, the Eleventh Circuit went en banc to address its\ncase law holding that “[a]rrestees who are to be detained in\nthe general jail population can constitutionally be subjected to\na strip search only if the search is supported by reasonable\nsuspicion that such a search will reveal weapons or contra-\nband.”  Id.  at  1278  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).\nBecause the en banc court decided the case on other grounds,\nit never reached that question. Id. Nevertheless, it found the\nneed  to  state:  “Most  of  us  are  uncertain  that  jailers  are\nrequired to have a reasonable suspicion of weapons or contra-\nband before strip searching—for security and safety purposes\n—arrestees bound for the general jail population.” Id. As dis-\ncussed in more detail infra, Judge Carnes, joined by Judges\nDubina and Hull, elaborated further on this view in a special\nconcurrence. \nThere is no dispute that in addressing the constitutionality\n6Indeed, that was the basis for Justice Powell’s dissent in Bell. See 441\nU.S. at 563 (Powell, J. dissenting) (“I join the opinion of the Court except\nthe discussion and holding with respect to body-cavity searches. In view\nof the serious intrusion on one’s privacy occasioned by such a search, I\nthink at least some level of cause, such as a reasonable suspicion, should\nbe required to justify the anal and genital searches described in this\ncase.”). \n7I recognize that Evans cites our decision in Giles as standing for such\na proposition. However, as noted above, Giles’s statement regarding the\ntransfer of inmates into the general population is dictum and not binding\nprecedent. \n\n11504 BULL  v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\nof this particular policy, we must “balanc[e] . . . the need for\nthe particular search against the invasion of personal rights\nthat the search entails.” Thompson, 885 F.2d at 1445. The pre-\nvention of the introduction of weapons or other contraband\ninto jail facilities is an extremely weighty governmental inter-\nest. Id. at 1446; see also Bell, 441 U.S. at 547, 559-60 (pre-\nvention  of  smuggling  of  drugs,  weapons,  and  other\ncontraband  is  a  significant  and  legitimate  prison  security\ninterest); Evans, 407 F.3d at 1289 (discussing how smuggling\nof contraband undermines jail security). In Evans, Judge Car-\nnes discussed at length expert testimony provided in Dodge v.\nCounty  of  Orange,  282  F.  Supp.  2d  41  (S.D.N.Y.  2003),\nremanded on other grounds, 103 Fed. Appx. 688 (2d Cir.\n2004),  a  case  addressing  the  constitutionality  of  a  policy\nrequiring  all  pretrial  detainees  to  be  strip  searched  upon\nadmission to the county jail.8 In Dodge, both sides’ experts\nagreed that “ ‘one of the primary objectives of any correc-\ntional facility must be to prevent the introduction of “contra-\nband”  into  a  correctional  facility  due  to  the  dangers  that\ncontraband presents in a correctional setting.’ ” Evans, 407\nF.3d  at  1289  (quoting  Dodge,  282  F.  Supp.  2d  at  46).\n“ ‘Prison administrators therefore should be accorded wide-\nranging deference in the adoption and execution of policies\nand practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve\ninternal  order  and  discipline  and  to  maintain  institutional\nsecurity.’ ” Id. at 1289-90 (quoting Bell, 441 U.S. at 547). \n8Bound by Second Circuit precedent, the district court in Dodge ulti-\nmately concluded that the strip search policy of the Orange County Cor-\nrectional Facility in New York was unconstitutional. Nevertheless, the\ndistrict court felt obliged to record its disagreement with Second Circuit\nprecedent noting that the record in the Dodge case demonstrated that jail\nadministrators “face very real potential security concerns from any new\narrival.” 282 F. Supp. 2d at 82. The court went on to state that it was hard\nfor it “to articulate a principled reason why an inmate cannot be strip\nsearched without reasonable suspicion of contraband carriage when he\narrives at [the Orange County Correctional Facility] but can lawfully be\nstrip searched after a court date or during a cell shakedown on ‘less than\nprobable cause.’ ” Id. (citing Bell, 441 U.S. at 560). \n\nBULL  v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO 11505\nSan Francisco has sufficiently demonstrated that smuggling\nof contraband has resulted in a serious risk to inmates and jail\nemployees. The County discovered over 1,000 items of con-\ntraband during a three-year period starting in 2000. An inmate\ndied from a drug overdose apparently after he procured the\ndrug inside the jail. To further illustrate the problem, I detail\nsome of the incidents described in the record: \n•  April  29,  2000:  Officials  found  a  white  “rock\nlike” object the size of a marble between the but-\ntocks of a man arrested for obstructing a peace\nofficer, driving under the influence, and a parole\nviolation. The inmate grabbed and swallowed the\nobject, requiring a trip to the emergency room. \n•  August 1, 2001: Officials found a bag filled with\nan unknown type of white pills in the mouth of\na woman arrested for shoplifting and on a war-\nrant for forgery. \n•  August 10, 2001: Officials found a plastic baggie\ncontaining  several  off-white  rocks  individually\nwrapped in plastic in the buttocks area of a man\narrested for public drunkenness. \n•  June 23, 2002: Officials found a plastic bag con-\ntaining  white  powder  inside  the  vagina  of  a\nwomen arrested for receiving stolen property. \n•  January 15, 2003: Officials found a syringe con-\ntaining 20 cc’s of brown liquid in the anus of a\nman arrested for a parole violation. \n•  November 29, 2003: Officials found a syringe in\nthe vagina of a female inmate arrested on an out-\nof-county warrant for drunk driving. \n\n11506 BULL  v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\n•  December 29, 2003: Officials found a crack pipe\nand case in the vagina of a woman arrested for\ntraffic violations.9 \nThe  majority  struggles  mightily  to  discount  this  record,\nstating that there is no clear documentation proving a smug-\ngling incident by an arrestee that would qualify as a member\nof the Plaintiffs’ class. Maj. Op. 11483-85. The question in\nBell, however, was not whether the individual security risk of\none  particular  person  warranted  a  search,  but  whether  the\nsecurity risks of an entire institution justified the jail’s policy.\nOn this record, the majority cannot deny that San Francisco\nfaces  an  extensive  smuggling  problem.  It  nevertheless\nassumes that San Francisco can remedy the smuggling prob-\nlem, and overcome the security risks that problem creates,\nwithout strip searching any member of Plaintiffs’ class even\nthough each class member is to be commingled with the gen-\neral jail population. With all due respect to my colleagues, the\nfallacy of the assumption on which that conclusion is based\nwill endanger the safety of future inmates and jail employees.\nAs Judge Carnes explains in his special concurrence, and\nas this record so forcefully demonstrates, the security risk to\njail facilities exists whether the inmate was arrested on a mis-\ndemeanor or a felony, or whether the inmate has a criminal\nhistory or no prior record. Evans, 407 F.3d at 1291 (Carnes,\nJ., specially concurring). “ ‘[O]fficials at a county jail . . . usu-\nally know very little about the new inmates they receive or the\nsecurity risk they present at the time of their arrival.’ ” Id.\n(second alteration in original) (quoting Dodge, 282 F. Supp.\n2d at 38). Moreover, there is no doubt that gang affiliation of\n9This list provides but a small sample of the twenty-eight incidents set\nforth in the combined record of which we have taken judicial notice. See\nsupra n. 3. The location of the contraband items—whether it be in the\nshoe, mouth, vaginal or anal cavity of the inmate being searched, see maj.\nop. 11485 & n.8—does not change the fact that San Francisco faces a seri-\nous smuggling problem and the problem is not isolated to those offenders\narrested for crimes involving drugs, weapons, or violence. \n\nBULL  v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO 11507\ninmates is a serious security risk. Id. at 1289. Statistics of\ninmate gang affiliation in San Francisco County Jails are not\nprovided in this record, but as an example, “[a]t the county\njail involved in the Dodge case there were at least fifty gang\nmembers being held on any given day.” Id. “ ‘Gang members\nare  often  more  violent,  dangerous,  and  manipulative  than\nother inmates, regardless of the nature of the charges against\nthem. They are also more likely than other inmates to attempt\nto coerce family members or to coerce, cajole, or intimidate\nlesser violators into smuggling contraband into the facility.’ ”10\nId. (alteration omitted) (quoting Dodge, 282 F. Supp. 2d at\n48). \nInmates returning from a court appearance outside the jail\npose the same risk to the general jail population upon return\nas do new arrestees coming in from the outside. The majori-\nty’s failure to recognize the current smuggling problem and\nacknowledge the lengths that determined criminals will go to\nsmuggle  contraband  and  weapons  inside  a  jail  or  prison\nmerely highlights why the Supreme Court has continually told\nus to give special deference to jail house administrators where\nsafety and security concerns are at issue. See, e.g., Bell, 441\nU.S. at 562. \nWe must also consider the far ranging implications of the\nmajority’s rule on county jails located throughout our circuit.\nSan Mateo County Sheriff Don Horsley and the County of\nSan Mateo (“Amici”), defendants in another pending class\naction lawsuit in the United States District Court, Northern\n10This evidence undermines the limited reasoning provided in Giles. See\n746 F.2d at 617 (stating that “arrest and confinement in the Bonneville\nCounty Jail are unplanned events, so the policy could not possibly deter\narrestees from carrying contraband”). We now know that inmates will go\nto great lengths to get contraband into jail facilities, where the contraband\nmay be worth more than it is on the street. Therefore, a policy that requires\njail officials to strip search every transferee into the general jail population\nwill have more of a deterrent affect than the limited search policy our pre-\ncedent now permits. \n\n11508 BULL  v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\nDistrict of California, filed an amicus brief in support of San\nFrancisco. Amici also had a policy of strip searching every\narrestee who was going to be housed in San Mateo County’s\ngeneral jail population.11 For a five-month period in 2004,\nAmici seized forty-one items of contraband found during strip\nsearches conducted in San Mateo County Jails. Items confis-\ncated as a result of these strip searches included the following:\na  hypodermic  needle  secreted  in  an  arrestee’s  buttocks;  a\nrazor blade found in a woman’s bra; a pocket knife found in\na  woman’s  bra;  a  small  bag  containing  methamphetamine\ninside a woman’s bra; suspected heroin secreted between an\ninmate’s buttocks; and suspected methamphetamine secreted\nbetween an inmate’s buttocks. \nThis evidence proves jail officials need greater flexibility\nthan  Ninth  Circuit  jurisprudence  permits  to  adequately\naddress the security risks they face in safely running county\nlockups. San Francisco, San Mateo, and other county jails\nacross the country have not exaggerated the need for strip\nsearches. The Supreme Court has told us that an inmate’s con-\nstitutional rights must yield to the legitimate penological and\nsafety concerns of the institution which houses commingled\npretrial detainees with sentenced prisoners. See Bell, 441 U.S.\nat 547. By failing to give sufficient weight to the security risk\nposed by the smuggling of contraband into jail facilities, the\nmajority has neglected to follow the Court’s directive to bal-\nance  an  institution’s  security  interests  against  the  privacy\nintrusion that undoubtedly takes place as a result of the intru-\nsive search. See id. at 546-47. \nNinth Circuit jurisprudence has deviated far off the course\nthe Supreme Court has charted. Because San Francisco has\ndemonstrated that it faces a pervasive smuggling problem that\ncan only be mitigated by a policy requiring the search of\n11Sometime in 2003, in response to adverse judicial rulings, Amici\nchanged their strip search policy so that only arrestees charged with\ncrimes involving drugs, violence, or weapons are strip searched. \n\nBULL  v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO 11509\nevery arrestee transferred for housing among the County’s\ngeneral jail population, I would hold that San Francisco’s jus-\ntified safety interest outweighs the privacy intrusion caused\nby such a search. It was reasonable under the Fourth Amend-\nment and resulted in no constitutional violation under the first\nprong of Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194 (2001). \nII\nI also disagree with the majority’s conclusion regarding the\nsecond prong of the qualified immunity inquiry, whether, in\nlight of clearly established law, a reasonable officer could\nhave known his/her conduct was unlawful. See id. at 201-02.\nTo answer this question we must determine “whether [Sheriff\nHennessey]  could  .  .  .  have  reasonably  but  mistakenly\nbelieved that his . . . conduct did not violate a clearly estab-\nlished constitutional right.” Jackson v. City of Bremerton, 268\nF.3d 646, 651 (9th Cir. 2001). \n“[R]easonableness  under  the  Fourth  Amendment  is  not\ncapable of precise definition or mechanical application.” Bell,\n441 U.S. at 559. “We must therefore balance the security\nneeds of local jail facilities against the privacy interests of\narrestees  charged  with  minor  offenses  to  determine  what\nobjective  standard  authorizes  strip  searching  of  arrestees.”\nGiles, 746 F.2d at 617; see also Savard v. Rhode Island, 338\nF.3d 23, 29 (1st Cir. 2003) (“The constitutional line that sepa-\nrates permissible from impermissible uses of these methods is\nimprecise  and  context-specific  .  .  .  .  [P]lotting  that  line\nrequires a determination of what is reasonable under a given\nset of circumstances.”). \nPrior to today’s decision, we would balance the security\ninterest of the individual jail facility against the privacy inter-\nests of its arrestees. See Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 714 (concluding\nthat the LAPD failed to provide sufficient documentation to\njustify  its  policy  of  strip  searching  every  felony  arrestee);\nGiles, 746 F.2d at 617 (holding the arrestees’ privacy interests\n\n11510 BULL  v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO\noutweighed Bonneville County Jail’s security interests as the\nrecord demonstrated that smuggling activity at that local jail\nwas minimal). Today’s ruling adopts a dangerous per se rule\nnotwithstanding the proven security needs of San Francisco\nCounty Jails. When people are dying as a result of our errant\njurisprudence, it is time to correct the course of our law. \nThe  contours  of  an  arrestee’s  Fourth  Amendment  right\nwhen he or she is transferred into a jail’s general population\nis debatable among reasonable jurists. Because there was no\nclearly established law on this issue, and because San Fran-\ncisco provided a record sufficient to distinguish this case from\nour prior cases, I would hold that Sheriff Hennessey and his\ndepartment lacked “fair warning” that San Francisco’s policy\nviolates the Fourth Amendment. We should reverse the dis-\ntrict  court’s  order  denying  qualified  immunity  to  Sheriff\nMichael Hennessey. \nI respectfully dissent. ",

These plaintiffs were booked for crimes of violence.  Therefore, any strip\n14 search conducted of any these Plaintiffs at the San Francisco County Jail was valid under state\n15 and federal law.  Plaintiffs Mary Bull and Laura Timbrook were booked on felonies and are\n16 statutorily excluded from bringing claims under Penal Code § 4030.  Further, all claims raised by\n17 Plaintiff Charli Johnson are time-barred.\n18 This motion for summary judgment shall be based on this Notice Of Motion And Motion\n19 For Summary Judgment And Supporting Memorandum Of Points and Authorities, the\n20 Declaration of Ingrid M.

Four of these seven were arrested for crimes of\n5 violence:  causing serious bodily harm to a peace officer (Jonah Zern); spousal battery or battery\n6 in a dating relationship (Marcie Corneau); battery and threats to commit a crime resulting in\n7 death or great bodily injury (Alexis Bronson); and assault with a deadly weapon (Lisa\n8 Giampaoli).  Such crimes of violence justify a strip search under both federal and state law.  Two\n9 more plaintiffs were arrested for non-violent felonies—felony vandalism (Mary Bull), and\n10 burglary and forgery (Laura Timbrook)—and cannot pursue their claims under Section 4030 of\n11 the California Penal Code because that statute explicitly excludes felony arrestees from its reach.\n12 Finally, all claims raised by the seventh plaintiff challenged here, Charli Johnson, are time-\n13 barred.\n14 The City therefore respectfully requests that this Court enter summary judgment against\n15 Plaintiffs Zern, Corneau, Bronson and Giampaoli on Counts One, Three and Four of the Cross-\n16 Complaint, in which they allege that they were strip searched in violation of the state and federal\n17 constitutions and Penal Code Section 4030.  The City is also entitled to summary judgment\n18 against Plaintiffs Bull and Timbrook on their strip-search claims under Section 4030 of the\n19 California Penal Code, and against Plaintiff Johnson on all claims.\n20  STATEMENT OF FACTS\n21 A.  Jonah Zern\n22 Plaintiff Jonah Zern was arrested in San Francisco on January 18, 2003, for violations of\n23 Penal Code Sections 594(a)(1) (malicious vandalism), 594(b)(1) (felony vandalism), 148\n24 (resisting arrest), and 148.10 (resisting arrest resulting in serious bodily injury to police officer).\n25 See San Francisco Police Department (\"SFPD\") Incident Report and Field Arrest Card of Jonah\n26 Zern (\"Zern Arrest Rpt.\") at 1, 10, attached as Exhibit (\"Ex.\") A to the Declaration of Ingrid M.\n27 Evans In Support Of Defendants’ Motion For Summary Judgment (\"Evans Decl.\").  Zern was\n28 participating in an anti-war protest and traveling on foot through the financial district of San\nDefs’.

See Zern Arrest Rpt. at 3, ¶1.  Zern was part of a group that was breaking windows\n2 and spray painting buildings along Sansome and Washington Streets.  Id. at 3, ¶2.\n3 Inspector Yu, Officer Lozada, and Officer Peagler observed the group of protestors stop\n4 in front of the Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS) building, break the glass, and\n5 vandalize the building with spray paint.  Id.  The Officers then witnessed a smaller group—\n6 consisting of Zern and eight to ten others—knock over four to five San Francisco Police\n7 Department motorcycles.  Zern Arrest Rpt. at 3, ¶ 3.  Zern and the small group then kicked and\n8 pushed at the leveled motorcycles to the applause of the larger group.  Zern and two others\n9 continued their assault by kicking down several newspaper receptacles.  Id.\n10 The officers then moved in to arrest Zern and another unidentified male.  As Officer\n11 Peagler struggled with the unidentified male, Officer Lozada displayed his star and moved in to\n12 arrest Zern.  Zern Arrest Rpt. at 3 ¶ 4; 5, ¶ 3.  Officer Lozada shouted \"Police Officer.  Stop.\n13 You are under arrest.\"  Zern disregarded this command and attempted to flee.  Id. at 5, ¶ 4.\n14 Officer Lozada then applied a takedown technique that brought Zern onto his back on a parked\n15 vehicle, but Zern violently resisted arrest.  Id.  Officer Lozada then brought Zern to the ground\n16 and attempted to handcuff him, but a group of twenty or more violent protestors physically\n17 attacked Officer Lozada in an attempt to obstruct Officer Lozada's lawful custody of Zern.  Id. at\n18 5, ¶¶ 4-5.\n19 Inspector Yu and Officer Peagler moved through the crowd to aid Officer Lozada in\n20 regaining control of the resisting Zern.  Zern Arrest Rpt. at 3, ¶ 5; 5, ¶¶ 3-6.  Zern continued to\n21 resist violently until Officer Peagler placed Zern in a cross face lock.  Then, at the direction of\n22 Lieutenant Crenshaw and with the assistance of Inspector Yu, Officers Lozada and Peagler\n23 dragged Zern out of the crowd and placed Zern in handcuffs.  Id. at 4, ¶ 5.  Officer Peagler\n24 placed Zern in the Sheriff's van and Inspector Yu booked him at the Southern Police Station.  Id.\n25 at 4, ¶¶ 5-7.  Among other charges, Zern was arrested for violating Penal Code Section 148.10\n26 (resisting arrest resulting in serious bodily injury to police officer).  Evans Decl. ¶2.\n27\n28\nDefs’.

Marcie Corneau\n1\nPlaintiff Marcie Corneau was arrested in San Francisco on September 1, 2003, for an\n2\noutstanding warrant and a violation of Penal Code Section 243(e)(1) (battery of a spouse or in a\n3\ndating relationship).  See SFPD Incident Report and Field Arrest Card of Marcie Corneau\n4\n(\"Corneau Arrest Rpt.\") at 1, 12, attached as Ex. B to Evans Decl.  Corneau and Camio Scott\n5\nwere both from southern California and new to the San Francisco Bay Area.  Corneau Arrest Rpt\n6\nat 4, ¶ 1.  They were co-habitants in a dating relationship and had a child.  Id. at 3, ¶ 7.\n7\nOn September 1, 2003, Corneau found Scott at a party near 500 Broadway, San\n8\nFrancisco, and the two began to argue outside.  Corneau Arrest Rpt. at 3, ¶¶ 1, 4-5.  Officers\n9\nChoy and Byrne were walking on Broadway when they observed two people in a verbal\n10\nargument.  Id. at 3, ¶ 1.  The officers observed both Corneau and Scott swinging their hands at\n11\neach other.  Id.  Then Scott tried to walk away from Corneau, but Corneau ran at Scott from\n12\nbehind and grabbed his shirt.  Id.  Scott then broke free and continued to walk away until\n13\nCorneau caught up with him again and, this time, kicked Scott in the upper leg area from behind.\n14\nId.  Scott kicked back at Corneau and Corneau stumbled.  Id.  Corneau then again ran at Scott\n15\nfrom behind and grabbed his shirt. Id.  At that point, the officers intervened and detained\n16\nCorneau and Scott pending further investigation.  Id. at 3, ¶ 2.\n17\nThe officers determined Corneau to be the aggressor and, based on their own personal\n18\nobservations, confirmed Scott's version of the incident.  Corneau Arrest Rpt. at 3, ¶¶ 6-7.  Scott\n19\nwas released, and he subsequently filed for a citizen’s arrest against Corneau.  Id. at 8; 3, ¶ 7.\n20\nOfficer Byrne then served Corneau with an Emergency Protective Order.  Id. at 9; 3-4, ¶ 9.  A\n21\ncomputer check revealed that Corneau had an outstanding warrant for her arrest and that the\n22\ncouple had had numerous previous domestic disputes.  Id. at 7; 3, ¶ 8; 4 ¶ 1.  Sergeant Venderbilt\n23\napproved the booking of Corneau, as there was a reasonable likelihood that the safety of both\n24\npersons would be imminently endangered if Corneau were released.  Id. at 4, ¶ 1.  Corneau was\n25\nbooked for a violation of Penal Code § 243(e)(1) (battery of a spouse or in a dating relationship),\n26\na crime of violence.  Evans Decl. ¶3.\n27\n28\nDefs’.

Alexis Bronson\n1\nPlaintiff Alexis Bronson was arrested in San Francisco on August 5, 2002, for violations\n2\nof Penal Code Sections 422 (threat to commit crime resulting in death or great bodily injury to\n3\nanother), 242 (battery), and 647(f) (public intoxication).

C to Evans Decl.\n5\nOfficers Doyle and Nelson were dispatched to 680 Mission Street to investigate a reported\n6\nbattery.  Bronson Arrest Rpt. at 3, ¶ 1.  Victim Woody Wilcox met the officers and informed\n7\nthem that he had seen Bronson enter the apartment's parking garage in his car in an unsafe\n8\nmanner and at a high rate of speed.  Id. at 3, ¶ 2.  Wilcox reported that, when he approached\n9\nBronson and questioned him about his speed, Bronson became violent and pushed Wilcox in the\n10\nchest.  Id.  Wilcox then told Bronson that he was going to call 911 to report the incident, and\n11\nBronson responded, \"If you call 911, I'll kill you.\"  Id.  The parking lot attendant was able to\n12\nidentify Bronson through his vehicle license plate number and furnished the officers with\n13\nBronson's apartment number.  Id.\n14\nThe officers then went to Bronson's apartment with Wilcox and the building manager,\n15\nMichelle Lee.  Bronson Arrest Rpt. at 3, ¶ 3.  The officers smelled alcohol on Bronson and\n16\nconcluded that he was inebriated, evidencing red eyes and slurred speech.  Id.  Bronson admitted\n17\nhaving an argument with Wilcox, but denied the battery.  Id.  Officer Doyle informed Bronson\n18\nthat he would be making a report and provided Bronson with a follow-up form.  Id.\n19\nThe officers returned to the building lobby with Lee.  Bronson followed them into the\n20\nlobby, and angrily questioning Lee as to why she gave the police his name and apartment\n21\nnumber.  Bronson Arrest Rpt. at 3, ¶ 4, Ex. C.  Bronson's menacing manner frightened Lee and\n22\ncorroborated Wilcox's earlier statements about Bronson's actions.  Id.  The officers then arrested\n23\nBronson.  Id.  Bronson became belligerent during handcuffing and resisted Officer Doyle's\n24\nattempts to escort him out of the lobby.  Id.  Once he reached the sidewalk, Bronson lunged\n25\ntowards Officer Nelson, and Officer Doyle had to pull him away.  Id. at 3-4,¶ 4.\n26\nOfficer Miranda assisted Officer Doyle in placing Bronson—who was still violently\n27\nresisting and out of control—into the police transport, in which Bronson rode to County Jail\n28\nDefs’.

Bronson Arrest Rpt. at 4, ¶ 1.  Wilcox then filed a citizen’s arrest form based on the\n2 initial threat and battery.  Id. at 4, ¶ 3.  Bronson was booked for violations of Penal Code\n3 Sections 422 (threat of death or great bodily injury to another) and 242 (battery), both crimes of\n4 violence.  Evans Decl. ¶ 4.\n5 D.  Lisa Giampaoli\n6 Plaintiff Lisa Giampaoli was arrested in San Francisco on July 20, 2002, for a violation\n7 of Penal Code Section 245(a)(1) (assault with a deadly weapon other than a firearm).  See SFPD\n8 Incident Report and Field Arrest Card of Lisa Giampaoli (\"Giampaoli Arrest Rpt.\") at 1, 9,\n9 attached as Ex. D to Evans Decl.  On that date at approximately 1:41 a.m., Officers Brothers and\n10 Leung witnessed a white male with a dog, followed by a white female, running across the 5100\n11 block of Geary Street.  Giampaoli Arrest Rpt at 4, ¶ 1.  The officers pulled over to investigate\n12 and were told by Vladimir Mikshansky that he had witnessed Giampaoli urging her dog to attack\n13 three Asian males.  Id. at 4, ¶ 2.  This report was corroborated by witnesses Anton Karbushev\n14 and Andrew Siri.  Id. at 4, ¶ 5; 5 ¶ 1.\n15 Mikshansky described how the Asian males had run inside 5120 Geary Street in order to\n16 seek protection from Giampaoli and her attacking dog, and that Mikshansky and another had\n17 held the door shut to prevent Giampaoli and her dog from entering that building.  Id. at 4, ¶ 2.\n18 After Giampaoli turned to walk away from the door, Mikshansky went back outside.  Id.  But\n19 once he did, Giampaoli turned the dog to face Mikshansky, shouting \"It doesn't matter if you’re\n20 Black, Asian or White,\" and sicced the dog on Mikshansky.  Id.  The dog bit Mikshansky in the\n21 left hand, injuring him.  Id.  Mikshansky stated that, after the dog bit him, he ran across the\n22 street, pursued by Giampaoli and the dog.  Around this time, the officers arrived and witnessed\n23 the dog and Giampaoli running across the street.  Id.\n24 The officers verified that the wound to Mikshansky was consistent with a dog bite.  Id.\n25 Giampaoli was arrested for a violation of Penal Code § 245(a)(1) (assault with a deadly weapon\n26 other than a firearm), a crime involving violence and the use of a weapon.

SUMMARY JUDGMENT MUST BE GRANTED WHERE, AS HERE, THE\n15\nUNDISPUTED MATERIAL FACTS ENTITLE DEFENDANTS TO JUDGMENT\nAS A MATTER OF LAW.\n16\nA moving party is entitled to summary judgment if there is no genuine issue as to any\n17\nmaterial fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Fed. R. Civ. P.\n18\n56(c).  Material facts are those which may affect the outcome of the case.  Anderson v. Liberty\n19\nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).  The moving party bears the initial burden of production\n20\ndemonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S.\n21\n317, 323 (1986).  The party opposing the motion may not rest on conclusory allegations or mere\n22\nassertions, but must come forward with probative evidence that is sufficient, taking the record as\n23\na whole, to allow a rational jury to find for the nonmoving party.  Matsushita Electric Industries\n24\nCo. v. Zenith Radio, 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986).\n25\nHere, there are no material facts in dispute:  the nature of the charges against each of the\n26\nplaintiffs is clearly documented and the date of Plaintiff Johnson’s arrest is similarly beyond\n27\n28\nDefs’.

As these uncontested facts dispose of claims raised by seven of the nine individual\n2 plaintiffs as a matter of law, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment.\n3 II.  BECAUSE PLAINTIFFS ZERN, CORNEAU, BRONSON AND GIAMPAOLI\nWERE ARRESTED FOR CRIMES OF VIOLENCE, THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL\n4 CLAIMS FAIL AS A MATTER OF LAW.\n5 The Supreme Court of the United States has held that the Fourth Amendment of the\n6 United States Constitution protects an arrestee's privacy interests and bars intrusions into the\n7 body which are not justified under the circumstances.  Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757,\n8 768 (1966).  In determining whether a search was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, a\n9 court must balance \"the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that\n10 the search entails.\"  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979).\n11 The case law could not be clearer:  a strip search is reasonable and justified if the charged\n12 offense is related to drugs, weapons or violence.  See Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Dep't, 901\n13 F.2d 702, 716(9th Cir. 1990); Thompson v. City of Los Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439, 1447 (9th Cir.\n14 1989); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 618 (9th Cir. 1984); see also Masters v. Crouch, 872\n15 F.2d 1248, 1255 (6th Cir. 1989); Dufrin v. Spreen, 712 F.2d 1084, 1087 (6th Cir. 1983);\n16 Dobrowolskyj v. Jefferson County, 823 F.2d 955, 958-59 (6th Cir. 1987).\n17 Controlling Ninth Circuit decisions also leave no doubt that the offenses for which\n18 Plaintiffs Zern, Corneau, Bronson and Giampaoli were arrested all qualify as crimes of violence.\n19 For example, in United States v. Robinson, 967 F.2d 287, 293 (9th Cir. 1992), the Ninth Circuit\n20 explained that, in the sentencing context, “crimes of violence” contain an element of use,\n21 attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against another or involve conduct which\n22 poses a serious risk of potential injury to another.  Id.  Plaintiff Zern’s arrest for resisting arrest\n23 with significant bodily injury to a peace officer easily satisfies this test, as do the arrests of\n24 Plaintiffs Corneau and Bronson for battery and Plaintiff Giampaoli for assault with a deadly\n25 weapon.  See id. (battery on a police officer is a crime of violence); United States v. Campos-\n26 Fuerte, 357 F.3d 956, 961 (9th Cir. 2004) (flight from police in willful and wanton disregard for\n27 safety a crime of violence); Rosales-Rosales v. Ashcroft, 347 F.3d 714, 717 (9th Cir. 2003) (threat\n28 to commit crime resulting in death or great bodily injury to another is crime of violence); United\nDefs’.

Amparo, 68 F.3d 1222, 1225 (9th Cir. 1995) (assault and battery are each crimes of\n2 violence).\n3 As each of these Plaintiffs was charged with one or more crimes of violence, a strip\n4 search was an objectively reasonable procedure in each case.  These Plaintiffs’ claims of\n5 constitutional violations fail as a matter of law.\n6 III.  THE CLAIMS OF PLAINTIFFS BULL, ZERN, CORNEAU, BRONSON,\nGIAMPAOLI AND TIMBROOK UNDER PENAL CODE SECTION 4030 FAIL\n7 AS A MATTER OF LAW BECAUSE THEY WERE EACH ARRESTED FOR A\nFELONY AND/OR CRIME OF VIOLENCE.\n8\nAll individual plaintiffs also bring claims for strip searches that allegedly violate\n9\nCalifornia Penal Code Section 4030.  But this statute specifically excludes from its provision any\n10\npersons arrested for a felony.  The statute states:\n11\nThe provisions of this section shall apply only to prearraignment detainees\n12 arrested for infraction or misdemeanor offenses and to any minor detained\nprior to a detention hearing on the grounds that he or she is a person . . . .\n13 alleged to have committed a misdemeanor or infraction offense.  (Cal.\nPenal Code § 4030.)\n14\nSection 4030 also provides that reasonable suspicion is required to strip search certain persons\n15\narrested for misdemeanors and infractions “except those involving weapons, controlled\n16\nsubstances or violence.”  Penal Code § 4030(f) (emphasis added).\n17\nPlaintiffs Mary Bull and Laura Timbrook were each arrested on felony charges.  See\n18\nEvans Decl. ¶¶ 7-8.  As shown above, Plaintiffs Zern, Corneau, Bronson and Giampaoli were\n19\narrested for crimes of violence.  See Section II, supra.  Accordingly, none of these plaintiffs are\n20\nentitled to invoke Penal Code Section 4030, and Defendants are entitled to summary judgment\n21\non those claims.1\n22\nIV.  PLAINTIFF JOHNSON’S CLAIMS ARE TIME-BARRED.\n23\nThe instant action was filed on April 23, 2003, but Plaintiff Charli Johnson appears for\n24\nthe first time in the First Amended Complaint, filed on January 12, 2004.  Johnson's arrest and\n25\nthe events of which she complains occurred on or about August 30, 2001.

Garcia, 471 U.S. 261, 279-80 (1985).  Before January 1, 2003, that statute of\n4 limitations was one year.  See Cal. Code Civ. Pro. § 340 (West 1982 [before amendment\n5 effective Jan. 1, 2003]); Hacienda Valley Mobile Estates v. City of Morgan Hill, 353 F.3d 651,\n6 655 & n.2 ( 9th Cir. 2003).  Accordingly, Johnson was required to file any federal claims by\n7 August 30, 2002.  Her 2004 complaint is more than a year too late.\n8 Plaintiff Johnson’s state-law claims are likewise time-barred.  “[S]ubmission of a claim\n9 to a public entity is a condition precedent to tort action and the failure to present the claim bars\n10 the action.”  Lutz v. Tri City Hosp., 179 Cal. App. 3d 807, 812 (1986).  California Government\n11 Code section 911.2 requires that a tort claim for personal injury against a public entity be filed\n12 “not later than six months after the accrual of the cause of action.”  People ex rel Dept. of\n13 Transp. v. Sup. Ct. (Isenhower), 105 Cal. App. 4th 39, 43 (2003).  The state claim presentation\n14 requirement applies to claims for monetary relief whether based on tort, contract, statute or state\n15 constitutional provisions.  See Baines Pickwick Limited v. City of Los Angeles, 72 Cal. App. 4th\n16 298, 309 (1999) (contract and tort claims); Nuremberg Actions v. County of Contra Costa, 697 F.\n17 Supp. 1111, 1113 (N.D. Cal. 1988) (state constitutional claims); Gatto v. County of Sonoma, 98\n18 Cal. App. 4th 744, 765 (state Unruh Civil Rights Act claims).  Each claimant must file a\n19 government claim, and compliance is not excused on the ground that another party filed a\n20 government claim based on the same facts or occurrence.  See, e.g., Nguyen v. Los Angeles\n21 County Harbor/UCLA Med. Ctr., 8 Cal. App. 4th 729, 734 (1992) (granting nonsuit as to\n22 parents’ claim for emotional distress although daughter had filed government claim for damages\n23 based on same occurrence).\n24 Plaintiffs seek to rely on a class government tort claim filed by Mary Bull on February\n25 10, 2003, to satisfy the claim presentation requirement of all named plaintiffs.  The class action\n26 procedures do not extend the statute of limitations or the time for complying with the claim\n27 presentation requirements.  Thus, in order to rely on the February 10, 2003, claim, each\n28 plaintiff’s state law claims must have arisen on or after August 10, 2002.  As Plaintiff Johnson’s\nDefs’.

SUMMARY OF PLAINTIFFS' ARGUMENT \n2  Defendants seek what is in effect an advisory opinion on the legality of their new \n3  written strip search and safety cell policies.  At least three reasons should prompt the Court to \n4  deny Defendants' motion. \nFirst, declaratory relief is inappropriate unless the matter is ripe for adjudication and \n5 \ndoes not require a more factual development of the record.  United States ofA  merica v. Braren, \n6 \n338 F.3d 971,975 (9th Cir. 2003); United States. v. State ofrVashington, 759 F.2u 1353, 1357 \n7 \n(9th Cir. 1985) (en bane); Orix Credit Alliance v.  Wolfe, 212 F.2d 891, 895-896 (5th Cir.2000); \n8 \nRobinson Band ofP orno Indians ofR  obinson Rancheria v. Babbitt (N.D. Cal. 1998) 1998 WL \n9 \n[Westlaw] 355580 .. In detem1ining the legality of jail policies infringing on arrestees' Fourth \n10 \nAmendlnent and Due Process rights, courts must conduct a \"delicate balancing\" between \n11 \n\"institutional needs and objectives\" and the \"constitutional liberties\" of persons suspected of \n12 \nth \ncrime.  Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Dept., 901 F.2d 702, 711 (9 Cir. 1989).  That balancing \n13 \ncannot be done within the confines of the Cross-Complaint in which Defendants seek a \n14 \ndeclaratory judglnent. \n15 \nSecond, declaratory relief should be denied when it will not terminate the proceedings \n16 \nand afford relief from the uncertainty and controversy faced by the parties.\"  United States. v. \n17 \nState of Washington, 759 F.2d 1353, 1357 (9th Cir. 1985) (en bane).  Plaintiffs' claims focus on \n18 \nunconstitutional and illegal conduct which in some cases emanated from written policies, but in \n19 \nmany cases violated written policies but became the de facto policies of the Department. \n20 \nAbsent a record showing that the Department will enforce the valid new policies, no Order \n21 \nshould issue and, in any event, no Order will bind those not now before the Court and cannot \n22 \npreclude suits by those harmed by unconstitutional practices post-January 2004. \n23 \nFinally, many of the new policies are suspect and lack any support in the record. \n24 \nDefendants reject the mandatory requirement of individualized reasonable suspicion and create \n25 \nbroad categories permitting visual body cavity searches of those arrested on weapons, drugs or \n26 \nviolence charges and with certain criminal histories absent ay showings whatever that such \n27  individuals are, in fact, are likely to secrete weapons or contraband in body orifices when \n28  arrested. \nCASPER, MEADOWS \n& SCHWARTZ \n2121 N.

OVERVIEW OF PLAINTIFFS' OPPOSITION \n2  On January 22, 2004, seeking to moot Plaintiffs' claims for injunctive relief and \n3  Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, Defendants filed a Cross-Complaint for \nDeclaratory Relief to which they appended new regulations.  The Department promulgated \n4 \nthese new policies in mid-January 2004, years after the Ninth Circuit had condemned blanket \n5 \nstrip searches and nine months after Plaintiffs filed suit.  The Cross-Complaint asks the Court \n6 \nto declare that the c1ain1 for injunctive relief is moot and that the new regulations comply with \n7 \nfederal and state law. \n8 \nDefendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings seeks an Order blessing the Sheriffs \n9 \nDepartment's new written policies.  Defendants' Cross-Complaint alleges no more than the \n10 \nexistence of a dispute between the parties about the legality of the new written policies.  It \n11 \ncontains no allegations describing the institution's security needs which could support the new \n12 \nwritten policies, fails to allege that the Department has disciplined violators of the prior written \n13 \npolicies, or even enforced the new ones. \n14 \nThe issues framed by the Cross-Complaint are simply not ripe for adjUdication.  Those \n15 \nissues need further factual development.  United States ofA  merica v. Braren, 338 F.3d 971, \n16 \n975 (9th Cir. 2003).  Moreover, many of the issues addressed by new written policies, dealing \n17 \nwith both visual body searches and particularly safety cells are not encompassed in Plaintiffs' \n18 \npleadings.  Ruling on these matters would be a purely advisory opinion which this Court lacks \n19 \njurisdiction under Article III to issue. \n20 \nA review of the Plaintiffs' pleadings in this case reveals that from the start Plaintiffs \n21 \nhave sought redress for defendants' conduct which violated the rights of Plaintiffs and class \n22 \nmembers protected by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and by California statute.  Some \n23 \nof that conduct arose from deputies' application of illegal written policies while other abuses \n24 \nresulted from systemic violations of written policies so that new de facto policies came into \n25 \neffect.  For example, contrary to written policies, authorization forms were altered to create \n26  purported strip search consent forms.  Deputies participated in cross-gender searches, violating \n27  another written policy. And, in contravention of an express safety cell written policy, deputies \n28  used safety cell placements to punish arrestees who had been deemed uncooperative. \nCASPER, MEADOWS \n& SCHWARTZ \n2121 N.

Only an injunction has the potential to create \n3  that beneficial result. \nDefendants assert that their motion carves out an \"autonomous\" question, distinct from \n4 \nthe rest of the litigation.  Not so.  Contrary to Defendants' assertion, even a ruling in their favor \n5 \nwill not preclude litigation by those harmed by unconstitutional conduct of Department \n6 \npersonnel occurring after January 2004.  Rased on the written policies alone, the Court cannot \n7 \naccurately determine whether these written policies \"vill actually dictate the practices of jail \n8 \npersonnel.  The Court should not assume that its approval of the new written policies will \n9 \nthwart future litigation.  And, of course, the Court's ruling will not bind future litigants (and of \n10 \ncourse not those within the instant class) allegedly harmed by post January 2004 Department \n11 \npractices and de facto policies. A partial judgment on the pleadings for declaratory relief is \n12 \ninappropriate here.  Questions of fact about the effect of the new policies on actual practice and \n13 \nthe factual basis for the new policies mandating blanket strip searches on certain classes of \n14 \narrestees remain to be answered.  Moreover, such an order will not foreclose future litigation \n15 \nbased, as is the instant case, on illegal Departmental conduct. \n16 \nMany of the policies themselves are also suspect.  The Ninth Circuit has condemned \n17 \nblanket overbroad policies which consign entire categories to visual body cavity searches in the \n18 \nabsence of individualized reasonable suspicion.  No Ninth Circuit case has held that officials \n19 \nmay search pre-arraignment arrestees based solely on the nature of the arrest or on an arrestee's \n20 \ncriminal history.  Apart from citations to cases which Defendants often misread, Defendants \n21 \noffer no basis for consigning entire groups of arrestees to visual body cavity searches absent \n22 \nindividualized reasonable suspicion. \n23 \nWhile notice pleading rules permitted Defendants to file a barebones Cross-Complaint \n24 \nfor Declaratory Relief, that pleading, even with the attached new regulations, gives the Court \n25  scant basis on which to enter partial judgment for Defendants.  In determining the legality of \n26  jail policies infringing on arrestees' Fourth Amendment and Due Process rights, courts must \n27  conduct a \"delicate balancing\" between \"institutional needs and objectives\" and the \n28  \"constitutionulliberties\" of persons suspected of crime.

That balancing cannot be done within the confines of the \n2  Cross-Complaint in which Defendants seek a declaratory judgment. \n3  To judge the merit of the written policies the Court must go beyond the pleadings to \ndetermine the justification for the new policies, particularly those permitting strip searches for \n4 \nentire classes of individuals.  This task is necessary given the Ninth Circuit's recognition that \n5 \nthere are \"few exercises of state authority that intrude on citizen's privacy and dignity as \n6 \nseverely as visual anal and genital searches.\" Fuller v. M.G. Jewelry, 950 F.2d 1437,1445 (9th \n7 \nCir. 1991).  Among the questions which require answers are: What was the jails' history of \n8 \nfinding weapons and contraband during visual body cavity searches of those arrested under the \n9 \nprior policy? Have deputies ever discovered contraband during visual body cavity searches on \n10 \nthose transferred from other institutions?  What alternative procedures exist to detect weapons \n11 \nor contraband short of visual body strip searches?  What information do Sheriff s Department \n12 \npersonnel possess when deciding whether to subject an arrestee to a visual body cavity search? \n13 \nHow have Sheriff s Department personnel actually cOlnplied with prior written policies which \n14 \nprotected arrestees from improper strip searches or placements in safety cells?  Will citizen \n15 \narrests be deemed a valid basis for a strip search?  How does the Sheriff s Department classify \n16 \ncrilnes of violence? Defendants' papers provide no answers to these questions.  Without the \n17 \nanswers to these questions, this Court cannot determine if the intrusion on pre-arraignment \n18 \narrestees' rights is warranted given the institution's security needs against which the arrestees' \n19 \nrights must be weighed. Absent factual support for the dilution of Fourth Amendment rights \n20 \noccasioned by subj ecting arrestees to visual body cavity searches, the Court has an insufficient \n21 \nbasis on which to judge the constitutionality of the policies.  Pending a more robust \n22 \ndevelopment of the record, the Court must deny Defendants' motion.  United States ofA  merica \n23  v. Braren, 338 F.3d 971,975 (9th Cir. 2003); United States. v.

A Judgment On The Pleadings Is Not Warranted If Factual Issues \nRemain To Be Adjudicated. \n6 \n\"A judgment on the pleadings is properly granted when, taking all allegations in the \n7 \npleading as true, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"  Enron Oil \n8 \nTrading & Transportation Co. v.  Walbrook Ins. Co., Ltd.,132 F.3d 526,528 (9th Cir. 1997).  \"A \n9 \nmotion for judglnent on the pleadings pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c) is appropriate where the \n10 \nmaterial facts of a case are not in dispute, and a judgment on the merits may be achieved by \n11 \nfocusing on the legal issues and agreed facts in the case.  If the pleadings do not resolve all of \n12 \nthe factual disputes, a trial is more appropriate than a judgment on the pleadings.\" Roberts v. \n13 \nRubert v. Ruhrman, Inc. 909 F.Supp. 545, 552 (N.D. Ill. 1995). \n14 \nDefendants have alleged absolutely no facts in their Cross-Complaint that the \n15  Department disciplined deputies who formerly violated arrestees' rights, or that deputies have \n16  not and will not violate the rights of those arrested after January 2004.  Plaintiffs would have \n17  denied such allegations and judgment on the pleadings would have been denied ab initio.  On \n18  the other hand, the absence of such allegations provides the Court with no assurance that \n19  adoption of the new written policies will result in protection of arrestees' rights. \n20  The Ninth Circuit has explained, \"A court may, however, consider certain materials--\n21  documents attached to the complaint, documents incorporated by reference in the complaint, or \n22  matters of judicial notice--without converting the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary \n23  judgment.\"  United States  v.

Declaratory Judgment Must Be Denied When A Party Seeks Only \nAn Advisory Opinion, When The Issues Are Not Ripe For \n5  Adjudication Because The Factual Record Is Incomplete If \nDeclaratory Relief Will Not Terminate The Controversy. \n6 \nThis Court may not exercise Article III jurisdiction when a party seeks only an advisory \n7 \nopinion.  The Court's \"role is neither to issue advisory opinions nor to declare rights in \n8 \nhypothetical cases.\" Thomas v. Anchorage Equal Rights Com'n, 220 F.3d 1134, 1138 (9th Cir. \n9 \n2000) (en bane). \n10 \nThis Court has discretion to deny declaratory relief if prudential considerations dictate \n11 \nagainst it.  Thus, \"even if Article III jurisdiction does exist, a court must refrain from issuing \n12  declaratory relief if the matter is not ripe for decision.  A case is not ripe if further factual \n13  development is required.\"  United States ofA  merica v. Braren, 338 F.3d 971, 975 (9th Cir. \n14  2003); Orix Credit Alliance v. Wolfe, 212 F.2d 891, 895-896 (5th Cir.2000).  The Ninth Circuit \n15  further instructs us that,  \"Declaratory relief should be denied when prudential considerations \n16  counsel against its use ... Declaratory relief should be denied when it will neither serve a \n17  useful purpose in clarifying and settling the legal relations in issue nor terminate the \n18  proceedings and afford relief from the uncertainty and controversy faced by the parties.\" \n19  United States. v. State of Washington, 759 F.2d 1353,1357 (9th Cir. 1985) (en bane).  See, e.g., \n20  Cha-Toine Hotel Apartments Bldg. Corp. v. Shogren, 204 F.2d 256,258 (7 Cir. 1953) (same); \nMiramax Film Corp. v.

It would be impossible in the absence of a particular factual context for the parties \n3  and the Court to imagine all possible class III gambling scenarios and adjudicate which \n4  scenarios are lawful.\"  1998 WL [Westlaw] 355580, at 3. \n5  IV.  THE STATE OF THE RECORD ON DEFENDANTS' MOTION \nPRECLUDES THE GRANT OF DECLARATORY RELIEF. \n6 \nThe Court cannot gauge the constitutional or statutory validity of the current policies \n7 \nabsent a balancing of the harsh intrusion into personal privacy effected by a visual body cavity \n8 \nsearch against evidence that such degradations are necessary to safe operation of the jails.  In \n9 \ndetermining the legality of jail policies infringing on arrestees Fourth Amendment and Due \n10 \nProcess, this Court must conduct a \"delicate balancing\" between \"institutional needs and \n11 \nobjectives\" and the \"constitutional liberties\" of persons suspected of crime.  Kennedy, supra, \n12  901 F.2d 702, 711 (9th Cir. 1989).  \"The permissibility of a particular law enforcement practice \n13  is judged by balancing its intrusion on the individual's Fourth Amendment interests against its \n14  promotion of legitimate governmental interests.\"  Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 714, 617 (9th \n15  Cir. 1984) \"The more intrusive the search, the closer governmental authorities must come to \n16  demonstrating probable cause will uncover the objects for which the search is being \n17  conducted.\" Mary Beth G. v. City o/Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1273 (ih Cir. 1983). \n18  Thus, addressing the LAPD's policy of subjecting all felony arrestees to visual body \n19  cavity searches, Kennedy explained that the \"critical inquiry is whether the LAPD has a \n20  sufficient justification for imposing its blanket policy.\"  The Ninth Circuit invalidated the policy \non the ground that the LAPD had failed to produce, in support of its justification, \"any \n21 \ndocumentation (or even assertion) that felony arrestees have attempted to smuggle contraband \n22 \ninto the jail in greater frequency than misdemeanor arrestees.\"  901 F2d at 713. \n23 \nPlaintiffs remind the Court that those arrestees whose body cavities Defendants wish to \n24 \nsearch have only been arrested, not even arraigned, much less convicted.  In the instant case, \n25 \nvirtually none of them was charged.  Yet they were subj ect to what the Ninth Circuit has \n26 \ndescribed as \"dehumanizing and hmniliating\" and Hone of the most grievous offenses against \n27 \npersonal dignity and common decency\" the \"intrusiveness [of which] cannot be overstated.\" \n28 \nCASPER, MEADOWS \n& SCHWARTZ \n2121 N.

This dehumanizing experience, then, in effect is the punishment many \n2  arrestees receive solely because they are suspected of committing a crime.  These descriptions \n3  must be given effect or they lose any meaning.  Ifbalanced equally against an amorphous claim \nof jail security, the descriptions of visual body cavity searches as \"grievous offenses\" or \n4 \n\"dehumanizing\" might as well be morphed into \"unpleasant\" or \"uncomfortable.\" \n5 \nThe only way in which the Court can give effect to the accurate harsh descriptions \n6 \naffixed to such searches is by requiring Defendants to sustain their heavy burden of factually \n7 \njustifying the necessity for these blanket policies.  Defendants have not offered such \n8 \njustification and must go outside the confines of their Cross-Complaint to do so.  Based solely \n9 \non the allegations in Defendants' Cross-Complaint and the n~w policies appended to that \n10 \npleading, the Court cannot confidently balance the dilution of Fourth Amendment rights \n11 \nwrought by a visible body cavity search against the jails' security interests. Therefore, \"The \n12 \nstate of the record is inadequate to support the extent of relief sought.\" State of fiVashing tun, \n13 \nsupra, at 1356.  See, also, Robinson Band ofP orno Indians ofR  obinson Rancheria v. Babbitt, \n14 \nsupra. 1998 WL 355580, at 3.  The Court therefore must dcny Defendants' ITIotion. \n15 \nV.  AN ORDER BLESSING THE NEW REGULATIONS WILL NOT \n16  RESOLVE THE CONTROVERSY BETWEEN THE PARTIES NOR \nPRECLUDE FUTURE LITIGATION; MOREOVER SUBSTANTIAL \n17  UNRESOLVED FACTUAL ISSUES TIED TO THE VALIDITY OF THE \nNEW REGULATIONS FURTHER COUNSEL DENIAL OF THE \n18  MOTION. \n19  A.  Defendants' Motion Mischaracterizes Plaintiffs' Claims. \n20  Defendants support the need for declaratory relief with the following statements: \nIn their motion for a preliminary injunction, plaintiffs seek to enjoin \n21 \nthe current policies and allege an ongoing threat of irreparable harm to \n22  plaintiffs pending trial, despite the fact that they base their complaint in \nthis action entirely on now-superseded policies.  Plaintiffs' actual quarrel, \n23 \ntherefore, is with stale policies that were at one time applied to individuals \n24  who are no longer in the custody of the Sheriff.  A declaration from this \nCourt that the current policies fully comply with applicable law will cabin \n25 \nthe current litigation, which Plaintiffs should not be allowed to expand to \n26  encompass policies that were not yet in force at the time that their claims \narose. \n27 \n28 \nCASPER, MEADOWS \n& SCHWARTZ \n~121 N.

Defendants' characterization of the litigation is just \n2  plain wrong.  Plaintiffs do not base their entire complaint on the \"superseded policies.\" The \n3  First Amended Cross Complaint does not cite a \"written policy\" as the sole basis for the \n4  Complaint.  While the Motion for Preliminary Injunction addresses some of the old policies, it \n5  asks that the illegal practices of the Sheriffs Department be enjoined.  Examining these \n6  pleadings we find: \n1.  Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint \n7 \nOn January 12, 2004, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint, adding \n8 \nseven additional named Plaintiffs to Ms. Bull and Mr. Zem.  The First Amended Complaint \n9 \ndoes not refer to any particular written policies by number.  It does describe the strip searches \n10 \nand, where applicable, the cold room placements of the named Plaintiffs.  The First Amended \n11 \nComplaint seeks \"declaratory and injunctive relief declaring illegal and enjoining, prelilllinarily \n12 \nand permanently, defendants' policies, practices, and customs of subjecting pre-arraignment \n13 \ndetainees to strip and visual body cavity searches without having a reasonable suspicion that \n14 \nsuch searches would be productive of contraband or weapons and of using the \"cold rooms\" to \n15 \ncompel compliance or to punish detainees.\"  (emphasis added.) \n16 \nThough several abuses alleged in the pleadings arose from application of policies as \n17 \nwritten, the pleadings allege many practices and customs in variance with and in violation of \n18 \nthe written Department policies then in effect such as those forbidding cross-gender searches, \n19 \nforbidding use of safely cells to discipline recalcitrant arrestees, and requiring that those in \n20 \nsafety cells receive safety cell garments.  Again, the allegations did not focus on the \"written \n21 \npolicies,\" but on the abusive unconstitutional practices which permeated the jail system.  The \n22 \nnew policies appended to Defendants' Cross-Complaint restate many of the same directives \n23 \nwhich the Department habitually violated, precipitating this litigation. \n24  2.  Plaintiffs' Motion For A Preliminary Injunction \n25  On January 21, 2004, Plaintiffs filed their Motion for Preliminary Injunction to be heard \n26  at the same time as the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.  While challenging some of the \n27  Department's written policies (such as strip searching all arrestees who are to be \"classified\" \n28  and strip searching all arrestees placed in safety cells), the Motion seeks to enjoin the \nCASPER, MEADOWS \n& SCHWARTZ \n2121 N.

The testimony \n2  supporting Plaintiffs' motion describes a pattern and practice of Department personnel violating \n3  written policies governing visual body cavity searches and the placement of detainees in safety \n4  cells. 1 \nB.  A Declaratory Relief Judgment Will Not Resolve The \n5  Controversy Nor Preclude Future Litigation; Additional Facts \nMust Be Resolved Before The Court Can Confidently Decide \n6  Whether Declaratory Relief Is Appropriate. \nThe premise of Defendants' motion fails.  Plaintiffs' First Amended Class Complaint \n7 \nand Motion for Preliminary Injunction seeks to stop Defendants' illegal practices, both those \n8 \nwhich conform to illegal written policies and those which violate them.  To the extent that \n9 \n10 \nPlaintiffs have asked the Court to take judicial notice of the First Amended Class Complaint \n11 \nand the evidence Plaintiffs have submitted in support of the request for preliminary injunctive relief to \nemphasize the point that Plaintiffs' allegations (supported by Defendants ' testimony) of systemic \n12 \nviolations of prior written polices create at a minimum the factual question of whether Defendants' \npersonnel will adhere to the new policies and whether Defendants' supervisory personnel will enforce \n13 \nthe policies.  The Court need not accept the truth of this testin10ny, simply the fact that it exists, \ncreating at a minimum substantial factual issues which the Defendants' prayed\"for Order cannot \n14 \nresolve. \n15 \nFor example, although the written regulations in effect prior to January 2004 required that \nbooking strip searches of those falling outside the Strip Search Criteria of Section II of Procedure E-03 \n16 \nbe predicated on the reasonable suspicion that the arrestee possesses contraband and that that \nreasonable suspicion be documented on a written authorization form, Department personnel altered the \n17 \nform so that arrestees could \"consent\" to visual body cavity searches absent meeting the criteria for a \nbooking strip search laid out in the Defendants' own policy.

Alexis Bronson has stated that he was placed in a safety \ncell for not coughing loudly enough during a strip search, Miki Mangosing for attempting to talk to her \nfriend in an adjacent cell, and Michael Marron for removing a prison-issued wristband. Declaration of \n25 \nAlexis Bronson, ~~ 6-7, Declaration of Miki Mangosing, ~~ 3-5, Declaration of Michael Marron, ~~ 4-5. \n26 \nWhile the criteria in the old and new policies mandated strip searches of those charged with \ndrugs, weapons or violence, Sheriff s Department employees testified that there was no list of eligible \n27 \ncharges.

Thus, a \n3  declaratory judgment will not resolve claims of arrestees whose rights were or will be violated \nafter January 2004.  In any event, even should the Court enter a declaratory judgment, Plaintiffs \n4 \nwould still be free at trial to prove that deputies consistently violated the Department's written \n5 \npolicies, both those in effect prior and subsequent to January 2004. \n6 \nShakespeare's observation that \"what's past is prologue,\" (The Tempest, Act II, scene \n7 \n1), is truly apt here.  The record before the Court is replete with allegations and evidence of \n8 \nviolations of prior Department policies which appeared to offer at least some protection to \n9 \narrestees.  Defendants ask the Court to accept on faith that deputies applying the current \n10 \nregulations are protecting and will continue to protect arrestees' constitutional and statutory \n11 \nrights.  Absent an evidentiary inquiry the Court cannot declare that the new written policies will \n12 \noffer any more coverage of arrestees' rights than the \"safety garments\" sometimes given \n13 \narrestees placed in safety cells.  Even those parts of the new regulations which appear to pass \n14 \nconstitutional muster may well be honored solely in the breach.  Only a full factual record - not \n15 \nDefendants' arguments  will enable the Court to judge whether even those new policies which \n16 \nappear facially valid will stand the test oftinle or unfoliunately resel11ble the Enlperor's New \n17 \nClothes. \n18 \nHence, declaratory relief in this case \"will neither serve a useful purpose in clarifying \n19 \nand settling the legal relations in issue nor terminate the proceedings and afford relief from the \n20 \nuncertainty and controversy faced by the parties.\" State a/Washington, supra, 759 F.2d 1353 at \n21 \n1357.

Los Angeles Police Dept., 901 F.2d 702, 711 (9th Cir. 1989) concluded that \"[t]he \n3  intrusiveness of a body-cavity search cannot be overstated.  Strip searches involving the visual \nexploration of body cavities is dehumanizing and humiliating.\" Kennedy also noted that '''body \n4 \ncavity searches .. [of] inmates represent one of the most grievous offenses against personal \n5 \ndignity and common decency.'\" ld.  (quoting from Justice Marshall's dissent in Bell v.  Wolfish, \n6 \n441 U.S. 558, 576-577 (1979)).  FuLler v. M.G. JeweLry, 950 F.2d 1437,1445 (9th Cir. 1991) \n7 \nretnarked that \"few exercises of state authority intrude on citizen's privacy and dignity as \n8 \nseverely as visual anal and genital searches.\"  These descriptions are more than words cited \n9 \nfrom West's Federal Reporter.  They accurately describe the grave intrusion on Fourth \n10 \nAmendtnent protected privacy rights caused by visual body cavity searches. \n11 \nRecognizing the grievous character of these intrusions, the Ninth Circuit has condemned \n12 \noverbroad blanket strip search policies because such policies do not require the individualized \n13 \nreasonable suspicion that the arrestee possesses weapons or other contraband.  Reviewing prior \n14 \ndecisions, the Ninth Circuit stated in Fuller, supra, that \"[t]hese decisions suggest that strip and \n15 \nbody cavity searches of detainees may be conducted based on reasonable suspicion only where \n16 \nsuch searches are necessary to protect the overriding security needs of the institution--that is, \n17 \nwhere officials have a reasonable suspicion that a particular detainee harbors weapons or \n18 \ndangerous contraband.\"  950 F.2d at 1447.  (emphasis added.)  \"[T]he permissibility of a \n19 \nparticular law enforcement practice is judged by balancing its intrusion on the individual's \n20 \nFourth Amendment interests against its promotion of legitimate governmental interests.\" Giles \n21 \nv. Ackerman, supra, 746 F.2d at 617. \n22 \nIn explaining application of the reasonable suspicion standard, Kennedy noted that\" \n23 \n'Reasonable suspicion may be based on such factors as the nature of the offense, the arrestee's \n24 \nappearance and conduct, and the prior arrest record.'\"  901 F .2d at 716, citing Giles v. \n25 \nAckerman, supra, 746 F.2d at 617.  Kennedy, however, did not state that anyone of these \n26  factors, standing alone, necessarily would give rise to the reasonable suspicion necessary to \n27  justify the strip search.  Hence, \"the classification of the offense in some cases might inform the \n28 \nCASPER, MEADOWS \n& SCHWARTZ \n2121 N. California Blvd.,  MARY BULL, et aI., v.

Because visual body cavity searches are \n5 \nconsidered \"one of the most grievous offenses against personal dignity and common decency \n6 \nharm which befalls those subject to such searches\" (Kennedy, Y01 F.2d at 711), blanket \n7 \nclassification should be avoided except when it is narrowly focused.  As Kennedy noted, \"a \n8 \nham-handed approach to policy making runs the serious risk of infringing on detainees' \n9 \nconstitutional rights.\" 901 F2d at 713. \n10 \nB.  With No Factual Basis, The Strip-Search Policies Contain \n11 \nOverbroad Classifications And Other Defects Which Preclude \nDeclaratory Relief. \n12 \nPlaintiffs agree that \"[rJeasonable suspicion may be based on such factors as the nature \n13 \nof the offense, the arrestee's appearance and conduct, and the prior arrest record\" Kennedy, \n14 \nsupra, 901 F_2d at 716.  Kennedy, however, does not hold that anyone of the factors, standing \n15 \nalone, necessarily provides the individualized reasonable suspicion necessary to support the \n16 \nintrusion. \n17 \nBlanket policies, proffered with no justification, are suspect.  Thus, Kennedy invalidated \n18 \nthe blanket strip search of all felons on the grounds that the LAPD had failed to produce, in \n19 \nsupport of its justification, \"any documentation (or even assertion) that felony arrestees have \n20 \nattempted to smuggle contraband into the jail in greater frequency than misdemeanor arrestees.\" \n21 \n901 F.2d at 713. \n22 \nHere, Defendants have failed to allege any factual basis demonstrating that the blanket \n23 \nclassifications are necessary to protect jail security.  No allegation exists in the Cross \n24 \nComplaint, for example, that those arrested for drugs, weapons or violence have a propensity to \n25 \nsecret weapons or contraband in their person.  Mere arrest for an alleged crime involving drugs, \n26 \nweapons or violence cannot, without nlore, give rise to a reasonable suspicion that the arrestee \n27 \nintends to smuggle contraband into the facility.  As the court noted in Giles v. Ackerman, supra, \n28 \n\"arrest and confinement in the Bonneville County Jail are unplanned events, so the [strip \nCASPER, MEADOWS \n& SCHWARTZ \n2121 N.

The new policies contain no definition of violent \n8 \ncrimes.  Thus certain crimes, which n1ay appear to be crimes of violence are not necessarily in \n9 \nthat category.  For example, battery does not necessarily involve violence, since even the \n10 \nslightest touching is sufficient to support a conviction for the offense.  See, e.g., People v. \n11 \nRocha (1971) 3 Ca1.3d 893, 899 ft. 12,92 Cal.Rptr. 172 (\"The least unprivileged touching may \n12 \nconstitute a criminal battery.  'In other words, force against the person is enough, it need not be \n13 \nviolent or severe.\"'); People v. Longoria (1995) 34 Ca1.App.4th 12,40 Cal.Rptr.2d 213, (\"[t]he \n14 \nword 'violence' has no real significance ... ' it has long been established ... that 'the least \n15 \ntouching' may constitute battery.' \" ). \n16 \nThe absurdity of such blanket classification is evident in the case of Lisa Gialllpaoli. \n17 \nEven assuming the charges were true, how can an arrest for allegedly unleashing a dog on \n18 \nanother person give rise to a reasonable suspicion that the arrestee has placed weapons (i.e. \n19 \nanother animal) in her body cavity? \n20 \nMoreover, the policy makes no distinction between those arrested with probable cause \n21 \nand those arrested based on a citizen's arrest.  Hence, those brought into the jails due to \n22 \nmalicious citizens' complaints by enemies, ex-lovers, etc. and usually released without being \n23 \ncharged, still must face the harm wrought by a visual body cavity search.  In Corcoran v. \n24 \nFletcher, 160 F.2d 1085 (C.D. Cal. 2001), the court held that a city's policy of substituting \n25 \ncitizen's arrests for probable cause violated the Fourth Amendment.  Of course, those arrested \n26 \nin error for crimes of drugs, weapons or violence also must suffer visual body cavity searches. \n27  The new policies afford no protection for such individuals. \n28 \nCASPER, MEADOWS \n& SCHWARTZ \n2121 N. California Blvd.,  MARY BULL, et aI., v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al.

No documentation exists, nor may it exist on a motion \nfor judgment on the pleadings, that such arrestees, by virtue of prior arrests or even convictions, \n4 \nhave a propensity to secret contraband in their orifices.  The same overbreadth taints the policy \n5 \nmandating visual body cavity searches of those arrested for probation and parole violations. \n6 \nWatt v. City ofR  ichardson Police Department 849 F2d 195,198 (5th Cir, 1988) \n7 \nThe current written policies are also defective because they make no provision \n8 \nexcluding those awaiting bail from the visual body cavity search.  Given the recognized \n9 \nhumiliation of such searches, no reason exists why arrestees should not be given 23 hours to \n10 \npost bail and access to a telephone to arrange such release.  Otherwise, a visual body cavity \n11 \nsearch reInains punislunent for those unable to prolnptly post bail.  In the SaIne vein, no one \n12 \neligible for OR release should be strip searched before release on OR has been denied. \n13 \nC.  The Safety Cells Policy Is Also Flawed. \n14 \nThe safety cell policy is defective, too.  No one should be placed in a safety cell unless a \n15 \nqualified professional determines that such placement is necessary because the person is a \n16 \ndanger to himself.  If an arrestee is a danger to others, the arrestee ean be single celled in a \n17 \nnormal cell.  Moreover, detention in a safety cell must be premised on an individual's particular \n18 \ncircumstances.  Nonetheless, the perceived danger an individual poses to others provides an \n19 \ninsufficient basis to strip search an individual laced in a safety cell - once alone, that arrestee \n20 \nposes no threat to others.  In any event, no individual should be subjected to a visual body \n21 \nsearch absent an individualized reasonable suspicion that the search is necessary to protect the \n22 \nindividual. \n23 \nWhatever defects may exist in the strip search policy, the main point is this: the Court \n24 \nhas an insufficient factual record on which to declare the constitutionality of the current \n25 \npolicies.  For that reason, without more, the Court must refuse to enter judgment approving any \n26  of the current strip policies. \n27 \n28 \nCASPER, MEADOWS \n& SCHWARTZ \n2121 N.

The Court previously issued a Memorandum and Order on\n21 September 22, 2005, but then granted defendant’s motion for reconsideration in order to\n22 address several important issues in this lawsuit.  The Court received additional briefing and\n23 held an oral argument regarding the motion for reconsideration.  In light of the Court’s desire\n24 to reach a final resolution of those issues, the Court has reconsidered its previous Order to a\n25 degree beyond the scope of the motion for reconsideration.  This Amended Memorandum\n26 and Order Re: Motions for Summary Judgment therefore supercedes the Court’s\n27 Memorandum and Order of September 22, 2005.  After carefully reviewing the memoranda\n28 and evidentiary record submitted by the parties, and having had the benefit of two oral\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 247     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 2 of 35(cid:10)\n1 arguments, the Court hereby GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART plaintiffs’ motion\n2 for summary judgment.\n3 Defendant Michael Hennessey also filed a motion for summary judgment regarding\n4 qualified immunity.  That motion is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.  Finally,\n5 defendants’ motion for summary judgment with respect to plaintiffs Zern and Corneau is\n6 GRANTED.\n7 BACKGROUND\n8 I.   Factual History\n9 The San Francisco Sheriff’s Department (“the Department”) oversees six county jails. \n10 After arrest, all arrestees are brought to County Jail No. 9 where they are booked within 24\n11 hours of arriving and a determination is made as to whether the detainee will be released or\nt\nr\nu 12 housed pending arraignment.  County Jail No. 9 is a temporary detention facility and does not\no\nC\n  13 contain accommodations for extended stays.  Thus, all detainees who are classified for\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 housing are transferred to another one of the CCSF’s jails.  According to defendants,\ns D ct of 15 approximately 50,000 individuals are booked and processed through this system each year.\nte stri\na Di16 Under Department policy in effect until January 21 2004,1 all arrestees entering\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 County Jail 9 were subjected to a pat search and screened by a metal detector.  The policy\nUnit or the 18 also provided for strip searches2 of detainees who fell into a number of categories, including:\nF\n19 arrestees charged with crimes involving narcotics, weapons or violence; arrestees with a\n20 criminal history of that type; individuals arrested for a probation violation; individuals\n21 arrested outside of San Francisco; arrestees in transit to another jail; arrestees classified for\n22 housing in the general jail population; and individuals placed in “safety cells.”  Safety cells\n23 are single-occupant, padded cells used to house inmates who were considered a danger to\n24\n1The Department’s new policy, which went into effect in January 2004 and currently\n25 remains in effect, is not at issue here.\n26 2As noted previously, the Court recognizes that there is a spectrum of possible search\npractices, including strip searches and visual body cavity searches, that fall within the general\n27 rubric of “strip searches.”  The Court and the parties have used this label to cover all such\npractices.  As it has before, the Court will adhere to the understanding that the distinctions within\n28 this category of searches make no difference in the analysis performed for the purposes of this\nmotion. \n2\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 247     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 3 of 35(cid:10)\n1 themselves or others, to be behaving in a “bizarre” manner or to be “gravely disabled.” \n2 Although not provided for in the Department’s written policy, plaintiffs also contend that\n3 defendants maintained a practice of performing strip searches on all detainees who signed a\n4 form indicating that they consented to such searches.\n5 According to defendants, the Department’s strip search policy was applied as follows:\n6 upon arrival at County Jail No. 9 all inmates who were deemed searchable based on their\n7 charge or criminal history were automatically strip searched.  Other arrestees were generally\n8 not strip searched unless they were identified for placement in a safety cell or, through the\n9 booking process, it was determined that the detainee would not be released within twenty-\n10 four hours and therefore would need to be housed in another jail facility.  For example,\n11 individuals who were cited and released, individuals who were temporarily detained because\nt\nr\nu 12 they were intoxicated, and individuals who said they would be able to post bail would be\no\nC\n  13 classified for release and therefore not be strip searched.  In summary, the Department\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 adopted a policy of strip searching all individuals who were classified for housing in the\ns D ct of 15 general jail population. \nte stri\na Di16 Strip searches at County Jail No. 9 have led to the discovery of weapons and other\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 contraband on the persons of arrestees.  Defendant produced evidence that from April 2000\nUnit or the 18 through April 2005 strip searches at County Jail No. 9 resulted in the discovery of 73 cases of\nF\n19 illegal drugs or drug paraphernalia hidden in body cavities.  In that same time period, six\n20 weapons were also discovered as a result of strip searches.  In addition, safety cell searches\n21 resulted in the discovery of weapons on three other detainees.3  \n22 II.   Procedural History\n23 Plaintiffs filed this action on April 23, 2003, alleging causes of action based on the\n24 Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, 42 U.S.C. section\n25\n26 3Defendants provided contraband reports for a period that includes searches conducted\nunder both the prior policy and the newer policy.  If these reports are divided into the two policy\n27 periods, the result is that 49 instances of drug-related contraband were discovered during the old\nregime and 14 instances were discovered after the change.  As for weapons, three were found\n28 in non-safety cell searches prior to enactment of the new policy and three were found afterwards.\nAll safety cell discoveries were made prior to the policy change.\n3\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 247     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 4 of 35(cid:10)\n1 1983, and several provisions of state law.  In an order issued June 10, 2004, this Court\n2 granted plaintiffs’ motion to certify a class under Rule 23(b)(3).  The class was defined as:\n3 All persons who, during the applicable period of limitations, and\ncontinuing to date, were arrested on any charge not involving\n4 weapons, controlled substances, or a charge of violence, and not\ninvolving a violation of parole or a violation of probation (where\n5 consent to search is a condition of such probation), and who were\nsubjected to a blanket visual body cavity strip search by\n6 defendants before arraignment at a San Francisco County jail\nfacility without any individualized reasonable suspicion that they\n7 were concealing contraband.  This class also includes 1) all\narrestees who were subjected to subsequent blanket strip\n8 search(es) before arraignment after the initial strip search,\nwithout any reasonable individualized suspicion that they had\n9 subsequently acquired and hidden contraband on their persons;\nand 2) all persons who, prior to arraignment, were subjected to\n10 blanket visual body cavity search(es) incident to placement in a\n“safety cell” at any of the San Francisco County jails.\n11\nt (emphasis in original).\nr\nu 12\no\nC    Plaintiffs previously moved for partial summary judgment with respect to several of\n  13\nt\nic nia their claims and regarding several affirmative defenses.  Defendant Sheriff Hennessey also\nistr Califor14 moved for summary judgment regarding his assertion that he is protected by qualified\ns D ct of 15\nte stri immunity.  The Court issued a Memorandum and Order dated September 22, 2005, that\na Di16\nSt ern  addressed both of those motions.  Subsequently, the CCSF filed a motion for reconsideration\n  h\nUnited or the Nort1178 to address five categories of strip searches on which the Court granted summary judgment in\nF favor of the plaintiff because the CCSF did not oppose the motion.  Although the CCSF did\n19\nnot, in fact, oppose plaintiff’s motion as to those categories, the Court granted the motion for\n20\nreconsideration in order to resolve as many issues on the merits as possible.4  To that end, the\n21\nCourt has reconsidered the entire motion and issues this Memorandum and Order.\n22\nLEGAL STANDARDS\n23\nI. Summary Judgment\n24\nSummary judgment is appropriate when the “pleadings, depositions, answers to\n25\ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is\n26\n27\n4The Court erred in carving out two of the five categories discussed in defendant’s motion\n28 for leave to file a motion for reconsideration.  The Court will address all five categories raised\nin defendant’s motion for reconsideration in this Order.\n4\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 247     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 5 of 35(cid:10)\n1 no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a\n2 matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  “In considering a motion for summary judgment, the\n3 court may not weigh the evidence or make credibility determinations, and is required to draw\n4 all inferences in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.”  Freeman v. Arpaio, 125\n5 F.3d 732, 735 (9th Cir. 1997).  A principal purpose of the summary judgment procedure is to\n6 identify and dispose of factually unsupported claims.  See Celotex Corp. v. Cattrett, 477 U.S.\n7 317, 323-24 (1986).\n8 The party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of identifying those\n9 portions of the pleadings, discovery, and affidavits which demonstrate the absence of a\n10 genuine issue of material fact.  See id. at 323.  Where the moving party will have the burden\n11 of proof on an issue at trial, it must affirmatively demonstrate that no reasonable trier of fact\nt\nr\nu 12 could find other than for the moving party.  See id.  Once the moving party meets this initial\no\nC\n  13 burden, the non-moving party must go beyond the pleadings and by its own evidence “set\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).  The\ns D ct of 15 non-moving party must “identify with reasonable particularity the evidence that precludes\nte stri\na Di16 summary judgment.”  Keenan v. Allan, 91 F.3d 1275, 1279 (9th Cir. 1996) (quoting Richards\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 v. Combined Ins. Co., 55 F.3d 247, 251 (7th Cir. 1995)).  If the non-moving party fails to\nUnit or the 18 make this showing, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  See Celotex,\nF\n19 477 U.S. at 323.\n20 II. Fourth Amendment Challenges to Strip Searches\n21 The claim that a strip search was performed in violation of the Fourth Amendment is\n22 neither new nor unfamiliar.  In 1979, the Supreme Court reviewed the constitutionality of the\n23 practice of conducting visual body-cavity searches on prison inmates following contact visits\n24 by individuals from outside of the prison population.  See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 558\n25 (1979).  The Court remarked that “[t]he test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment\n26 is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application.”  Id. at 559.  Instead, “[i]n\n27 each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of\n28 personal rights that the search entails.”  Id.  The Court concluded that the search practice\n5\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 247     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 6 of 35(cid:10)\n1 there at issue was valid given the severity of the charges, the significant risks of smuggling\n2 contraband posed by contact visits, and the significant interest in preserving safety within the\n3 detention facility.  Id.  \n4 Since Wolfish, the Ninth Circuit has taken up the question of the lawfulness of strip\n5 searches in cases like this one involving pre-arraignment arrestees.  In the first case to\n6 consider the subject, Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614 (9th Cir. 1984) (per curiam)\n7 (overruled on other grounds by Hodgers-Durgin v. de la Vina, 199 F.3d 1037, 1041 (9th Cir.\n8 1999) (en banc)), the court announced the governing standard that “arrestees for minor\n9 offenses may be subjected to a strip search only if jail officials have a reasonable suspicion\n10 that the particular arrestee is carrying or concealing contraband or suffering from a\n11 communicable disease.”  746 F.2d at 615.  Such reasonable suspicion may be based on\nt\nr\nu 12 factors such as “the nature of the offense, the arrestee’s appearance and conduct, and the\no\nC\n  13 prior arrest record.”  Id. at 617.  Applying this standard, the court concluded that the policy\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 of the Bonneville County Jail in Idaho Falls, Idaho, to strip search all arrestees booked there\ns D ct of 15 was not proper in light of the institution’s security.  Id. at 617.  The court ruled that there was\nte stri\na Di16 no reasonable suspicion to support the search of the plaintiff because of the minor nature of\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 the offense (failure to pay parking tickets), the fact she had no prior record, and because she\nUnit or the 18 had been cooperative during the search.  Id. at 618.  The court further distinguished Wolfish\nF\n19 by noting that arrest and confinement is unplanned, thereby rendering a blanket strip search\n20 policy ineffective to the law enforcement objectives of preventing contraband from entering\n21 the county jail.\n22 The Ninth Circuit has revisited pre-arraignment searches several times, on each\n23 occasion reaffirming the individualized reasonable suspicion standard laid out by Giles.  In\n24 Ward v. County of San Diego, 791 F.2d 1329 (9th Cir. 1986), the court found no qualified\n25 immunity for a San Diego County Sheriff that had enacted a blanket strip search policy\n26 which resulted in the visual body cavity search of a misdemeanor arrestee prior to a\n27 determination regarding the arrestee’s eligibility for an own recognizance (“O.R.”) release. \n28 See id. at 1333 (“In most instances the unreasonableness of a strip search conducted prior to\n6\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 247     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 7 of 35(cid:10)\n1 an O.R. release determination is plain.”).  In Thompson v. City of Los Angeles, 885 F.2d\n2 1439 (9th Cir. 1989), the court found that the strip search of a felony grand theft auto arrestee\n3 at the Los Angeles County Jail was valid based on the charge alone, stating that the offense\n4 in question was “sufficiently associated with violence to justify a visual strip search.”  Id. at\n5 1447.  In a later case, however, the Ninth Circuit found fault with the City of Los Angeles’s\n6 blanket policy subjecting all felony arrestees to a visual body cavity search and the Los\n7 Angeles Police Department’s (“LAPD”) application of that policy to a woman arrested for a\n8 grand theft that did not involve drugs or violence.  See Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Dept.,\n9 901 F.2d 702, 710-16 (9th Cir. 1990) (impliedly overruled on other grounds by Hunter v.\n10 Bryant, 502 U.S. 224 (1991) (per curiam)).  In Kennedy, the court emphasized that the\n11 severity of the charge bore no reasonable relationship to institutional security concerns. Id. at\nt\nr\nu 12 713 (“[T]he enacted policy, if it is to be constitutional, must be ‘reasonably related’ to the\no\nC\n  13 penal institution’s interest in maintaining security.”).  Then, in Fuller v. M.G. Jewelry, 950\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 F.2d 1437 (9th Cir. 1991), the court clarified that strip searches in detention facilities are\ns D ct of 15 justified on less than probable cause solely by the need “to protect prisons and jails from\nte stri\na Di16 smuggled weapons, drugs or other contraband which pose a threat to the safety and security\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 of penal institutions.”  Id. at 1447.  The court refused to extend the reasonable suspicion\nUnit or the 18 standard to body cavity searches for ordinary stolen property, id. at 1448, and ruled invalid\nF\n19 the strip search by the LAPD of two women suspected of having stolen a ring.  Id. at 1450.  \n20 DISCUSSION\n21 Plaintiffs move for summary judgment to determine liability on several issues that\n22 underlie their claim that defendants’ prior strip search policy was unconstitutional pursuant to\n23 the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and actionable\n24 under 42 U.S.C. section 1983.  In particular, plaintiffs challenge the following search\n25 categories within the policy: (1) arrestees with one or more prior convictions or two or more\n26 prior arrests for crimes involving drugs, weapons or violence within the previous five years;\n27 (2) arrestees charged with a probation violation (who have not consented to searches of their\n28 persons as a condition of probation); (3) individuals arrested on a San Francisco warrant\n7\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 247     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 8 of 35(cid:10)\n1 outside of San Francisco County; (4) individuals arrested on a U.S. Marshal hold; (5)\n2 individuals held at a San Francisco jail while in transit to another part of the state; (6)\n3 arrestees classified for housing in a county jail; (7) individuals placed in safety cells; and (8)\n4 individuals strip searched because they signed a consent form.5  Plaintiffs’ challenge applies\n5 only to eligible class members, which does not include anyone arrested on charges involving\n6 weapons, controlled substances, or violence, and also does not include anyone who was strip\n7 searched upon an individualized finding of reasonable suspicion that an arrestee may be\n8 concealing weapons or contraband.\n9 I. Standing\n10 As a threshold matter, defendants contest plaintiffs’ standing to challenge any of the\n11 abovementioned categories, (1) through (8) supra, pursuant to which none of the named\nt\nr\nu 12 plaintiffs were searched.  Defendants argue that plaintiffs searched under one of these\no\nC\n  13 categories do not have standing to challenge other categories because no “case or\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 controversy” yet exists.  Yet defendants do not dispute that the named plaintiffs were\ns D ct of 15 personally injured and have standing to bring this lawsuit on other grounds.  See Lewis v.\nte stri\na Di16 Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 349 (1996).  Nor do defendants argue that plaintiffs did not have\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 standing to bring this action when it was initiated. \nUnit or the 18 Plaintiffs have standing to make a facial challenge as to the constitutionality of the\nF\n19 City’s former strip search policy.  The Court has previously determined that the named\n20 plaintiffs are adequate and typical class representatives who will actively pursue this\n21 litigation and represent the interests of all class members.  Moreover, defendants do not\n22 dispute that the class as a whole includes individuals searched pursuant to all of the\n23 aforementioned categories.  Defendants’ argument amounts to little more than a challenge to\n24 the class definition, which is not the subject of this motion.  \n25\n26\n27 5Plaintiffs’  original  Memorandum  of  Points  and  Authorities  in  Support  of  Partial\nSummary Judgment did not include any argument regarding “secondary searches,” the category\n28 of searches that included individuals searched for a second time prior to arraignment.  Therefore\nthe Court does not address that issue here.     \n8\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 247     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 9 of 35(cid:10)\n1 Moreover, defendants misapply the two district court cases they cite in support of their\n2 argument.  The issue in both of those cases was whether the putative named plaintiffs had\n3 standing to bring the lawsuit, which is not disputed here.  Accordingly, the Court finds that\n4 plaintiffs do have standing to challenge the CCSF’s former strip search policy on its face,\n5 including categories (1) through (8) listed above.  To the extent that defendants standing\n6 argument challenges whether plaintiffs can make an as-applied challenge to categories in\n7 which no named plaintiff was searched, defendants are correct.  An as-applied challenge to\n8 an individual category requires a factual foundation for the Court to analyze, which can only\n9 be provided by the facts surrounding the strip search of an individual.\n10 II. Facial Challenges\n11 Plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment avers that the categories of the\nt\nr\nu 12 CCSF’s policy listed above are unconstitutional on their face.  Defendants urge the Court to\no\nC\n  13 apply the standard set forth in United States v. Salerno to determine whether the relevant\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 parts of the policy here are unconstitutional.  In Salerno, the Supreme Court held that a facial\ns D ct of 15 challenge to a legislative act is “the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the\nte stri\na Di16 challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act might be\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 valid.” United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987).6  \nUnit or the 18 The Ninth Circuit, however, has not applied Salerno to cases challenging the\nF\n19 constitutionality of strip search policies.  See Fuller v. M.G. Jewelry, 950 F.2d 1437, 1452\n20 (9th Cir. 1991) (noting that the Ninth Circuit has held the “LAPD strip search policy is\n21 unconstitutional on its face” even though it never applied Salerno); see also Tardiff v. Knox\n22 County, 356 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2004) (Boudin, C. J.).  Instead, case law in this circuit has\n23 used the analysis first enumerated in Bell v. Wolfish to determine whether the policy itself is\n24\n25 6In City of Chicago v. Morales, 527 U.S. 41, 55 n.22 (1999), a plurality of the Supreme\nCourt called into question the continuing viability of the Salerno standard.  Subsequently,\n26 however, the Ninth Circuit has reaffirmed that the general standard for a facial constitutional\nchallenge to a legislative act not involving the First Amendment or abortion remains the one set\n27 forth in United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987).  See S.D. Myers, Inc. v. City and County\nof San Francisco, 253 U.S. 461, 467 (9th Cir. 2001) (recognizing that the Supreme Court has\n28 overruled Salerno in some contexts, but stating that “we will not reject Salerno in other contexts\nuntil a majority of the Supreme Court clearly directs us to do so”).\n9\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 247     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 10 of 35(cid:10)\n1 unconstitutional.  See Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Dept., 901 F.2d 702, 714 (9th Cir.\n2 1990) (“On balance, the LAPD’s policy cannot withstand the constitutional review\n3 articulated in Wolfish.”).7  Therefore, the Court will follow Ninth Circuit precedent and\n4 analyze the facial challenges under Wolfish.\n5 A.   “Classification” Searches\n6 Defendants claim that the jail system’s interest in strip searching pre-trial detainees is\n7 at its zenith when arrestees are “classified” for housing in the general jail population.  This is\n8 true because the introduction of outsiders into the jail system–as opposed to the temporary\n9 detention facilities at County Jail No. 9–poses heightened safety risks to prisoners and guards\n10 alike, given the large number of detainees in the jail system and the extended period of\n11 detention.  Under defendants’ view of the governing law, these concerns allow for blanket\nt\nr\nu 12 strip searches without individualized suspicion.  This position, however, fails in the face of\no\nC\n  13 Ninth Circuit precedent to the contrary.\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 Although defendants are correct that the government’s penological interests are\ns D ct of 15 heightened when temporary detainees are introduced into the general jail population, such\nte stri\na Di16 intermingling on its own does not create reasonable suspicion to perform a strip search.  As\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 stated by the Ninth Circuit, although the fact an arrestee is to be “placed into contact with the\nUnit or the 18 general jail population” is one important factor among many that may be considered in\nF\n19 gauging the reasonableness of a search, “such a factor by itself cannot justify a strip search.”8 \n20\n21 7Even  if  the  policy  itself  is  deemed  to  be  unconstitutional,  however,  the  liability\ndetermination is not complete.  Defendants can still show that a particular search was conducted\n22 on the basis of individualized suspicion rather than a categorical application of the policy.  See\nKennedy, 901 F.2d at 715; see also Fuller, 950 F.2d at 1446 (noting that even where an\n23 unconstitutional blanket policy exists, a search can be justified on other grounds).  Other than\nthe individuals discussed below, the Court does not have the occasion to address whether any\n24 individual searches were unconstitutional. \n25 8Defendants claim that Fuller is to the contrary.  There the Ninth Circuit cited with\napproval the Sixth Circuit’s decision in Dobrowolskyj v. Jefferson County, 823 F.2d 955 (6th\n26 Cir. 1987).  That case found that a county had not run afoul of the Fourth Amendment where it\nhad initially conducted a pat down search and did not perform a strip search until the plaintiff\n27 “was about to be moved into contact with the general jail population.”  Fuller, 950 F.2d at 1448\n(quoting Dobrowolskyj, 823 F.2d at 958).  \n28\nHowever, Fuller also approvingly cited a later Sixth Circuit case,  Masters v. Crouch, 872\n10\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 247     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 11 of 35(cid:10)\n1 Thompson, 885 F.2d at 1447; see also Giles, 746 F.2d at 618-19 (rejecting the notion that\n2 placement in the general jail population was enough to validate a strip search because\n3 “intermingling is both limited and avoidable” (citation and internal quotation omitted)). \n4 Rather than relying on the mere fact of intermingling, the Ninth Circuit has consistently\n5 noted that factors to be considered in determining whether reasonable suspicion exists to\n6 warrant a strip search include “the nature of the offense, an arrestee’s appearance and\n7 conduct, and the prior arrest record.” Giles, 746 F.2d at 617; see also Thompson, 885 F.2d at\n8 1446. \n9 Defendants’ additional justification–the documented record of serious and widespread\n10 contraband smuggling at San Francisco’s jails–is not sufficient to uphold the constitutionality\n11 of the categorical strip search policy.  As has the Ninth Circuit on several occasions, the\nt\nr\nu 12 Court recognizes the pressing need to maintain security in jails and prisons and the real and\no\nC\n  13 profound threats posed by the introduction of weapons and drugs into that environment.  See,\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 e.g., Thompson, 885 F.2d at 1446 (“the prevention of the introduction of weapons and other\ns D ct of 15 contraband into the jail ... is indeed an extremely weighty interest”);  Kennedy, 901 F.2d at\nte stri\na Di16 713 (“These concerns and this interest no doubt are weighty.”).  Yet to adopt defendants’\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 view that the severity of the smuggling problem can justify a blanket strip search policy\nUnit or the 18 would be to ignore the consistent holdings of the Ninth Circuit that reasonable suspicion may\nF\n19 only be founded upon facts that are particular to the individual arrestee.  See Giles, 746 F.2d\n20\n21 F.2d 1248 (6th Cir. 1989), for the proposition that the “fact that [the] detainee was intermingled\nwith other inmates has never alone been found to justify a strip search without considering the\n22 nature of the offense and whether the detainee might attempt to introduce weapons or contraband\ninto the institution.”  Fuller, 950 F.2d at 1448 (emphasis added) (quoting Masters, 872 F.2d at\n23 1254).  Master relied in part on Hill v. Bogans, 735 F.2d 391 (10th Cir. 1984), which found that\n“intermingling [with the prison population] is only one factor to consider in judging the\n24 constitutionality of a strip search,” id. at 394, and that where, as were the circumstances there,\n“[n]o other conceivable justification exists for the strip search,” id., the search is invalid.  See\n25 id. (considering the nature of the offense at issue and finding that it was “not commonly\nassociated by its very nature with the possession of weapons or contraband”).  \n26\nA fair reading of Fuller leads to the conclusion that the court there, consistent with\n27 Thompson and the governing law in the Ninth Circuit, treated the intermingling of an arrestee\nwith the general jail population as only one factor among many that might justify a search.\n28 Notably, Thompson cited both Dobrowolskyj and Masters in arriving at its conclusion that\nintermingling alone does not justify a strip search.  See Thompson, 885 F.2d at 1447.\n11\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 247     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 12 of 35(cid:10)\n1 at 615 (holding that there must be reasonable suspicion that “the particular arrestee” is\n2 concealing contraband); Ward, 791 F.2d at 1333 (summing up Giles’ holding as requiring\n3 “individualized suspicion”); Thompson, 885 F.2d at 1446 (“the arresting officers must have\n4 reasonable individualized suspicion”).   It is not enough, as defendants would have it, for the\n5 government to demonstrate that contraband smuggling is a significant problem.  Instead,\n6 there must be some reasonable relationship between the criteria used to identify individuals\n7 as eligible for a strip search and the interest in preventing the introduction of contraband. \n8 See Giles, 746 F.2d at 618 (reasonableness requirement under the Fourth Amendment\n9 requires that the strip search bear some “discernible relationship to security needs”) (quoting\n10 Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007, 1013 (4th Cir. 1981)).  \n11 Defendants have proffered no evidence demonstrating a high level of smuggling by\nt\nr\nu 12 individuals classified for housing who were not charged with crimes involving weapons,\no\nC\n  13 drugs or violence (or within another valid strip search category).  See Kennedy, 901 F.2d at\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 713 (stressing the importance of documentation supporting the assertion that arrestees within\ns D ct of 15 the strip search category smuggle contraband into the jail in greater frequency than arrestees\nte stri\na Di16 outside of the category).  Such a showing may have demonstrated that the charge alone was\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 not enough to identify potential contraband smugglers and supported a reasonable suspicion\nUnit or the 18 that other classes of individuals destined for the jail were likely to be security risks.  While\nF\n19 defendants did produce dozens of reports regarding the discovery of contraband during strip\n20 searches, the reports fail to provide any indication of the charges of the searched individuals\n21 or the reason why they were searched.  Absent such evidence there is no reasonable\n22 relationship between the criteria triggering a search (classification for housing) and the\n23 interest in conducting the search (eliminating the introduction of contraband).  See id.\n24 (finding the policy at issue unconstitutional because it rested on assumptions and societal\n25 judgments, rather than on careful deliberation and documentary evidence). \n26 Defendants’ policy of strip searching all arrestees classified for housing in the general\n27 jail population, coupled with their knowledge of a widespread problem with contraband\n28 smuggling in the jail system, is an invalid basis for the blanket policy because these two facts\n12\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 247     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 13 of 35(cid:10)\n1 say nothing about whether an individual arrestee classified pursuant to this policy may be\n2 concealing weapons or drugs.  Accordingly, the Court concludes that the Department’s\n3 former policy requiring strip searches of all detainees classified for housing in the general jail\n4 population without any consideration of the crime charged or any other individualized factors\n5 was unconstitutional. Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment as to classification searches is\n6 therefore GRANTED.\n7 B. Criminal History Searches\n8 Plaintiffs challenge defendants’ former policy as it relates to arrestees with one or\n9 more prior convictions or two or more prior arrests for crimes involving drugs, weapons or\n10 violence within the prior five years.  Plaintiffs urge the Court to follow Watt v. City of\n11 Richardson, a Fifth Circuit case where a strip search of a woman as a result of an old drug\nt\nr\nu 12 conviction was deemed unconstitutional.  849 F.2d 195 (5th Cir. 1988).\no\nC\n  13 The Court is unpersuaded in this instance by Watt, particularly in light of Ninth\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 Circuit precedent to the contrary.  First, the court in Watt made clear that only the particular\ns D ct of 15 search in question, not all searches under that policy, was unconstitutional.  Second, the\nte stri\na Di16 policy in Watt had no limiting restrictions, unlike here, where the policy requires a prior\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 conviction or multiple arrests to have occurred within the previous five years.  \nUnit or the 18 Most importantly, it is now settled law in the Ninth Circuit that reasonable suspicion\nF\n19 may be based on factors such as “the nature of the offense, the arrestee’s appearance and\n20 conduct, and the prior arrest record.” Giles, 746 F.2d at 617 (emphasis added).  Plaintiffs\n21 urge the Court to require more than a prior arrest record of the type included in this category\n22 in order to make a finding that individual reasonable suspicion exists.  Plaintiffs, however,\n23 cite to no case supporting that proposition and the Court is not inclined to agree.  A prior\n24 arrest record that includes offenses or arrests for crimes that courts have long recognized\n25 pose a sufficient risk to institutional security outweighs the arrestees’ privacy interests,\n26 particularly when that record occurred within a limited time period such as the prior five\n27 years.  The Court therefore finds as a matter of law that defendants had reasonable suspicion\n28 to search individuals pursuant to this category based on their prior record involving drugs,\n13\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 247     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 14 of 35(cid:10)\n1 weapons or violence.  As a result, the Court DENIES plaintiff’s motion for summary\n2 judgment as to this category and GRANTS summary judgment for defendants.\n3 C. Probation Violations\n4 As a threshold matter, the class definition makes clear that the only individuals\n5 challenging the City’s policy of strip searching all arrestees charged with a probation\n6 violation are those who did not consent to searches of their persons as a condition of\n7 probation.  Therefore, the Court’s inquiry focuses on the apparently narrow group of\n8 arrestees who were strip searched pursuant to this category of the policy.  See Declaration of\n9 Arturo Faro ¶ 7 (estimating that two-thirds of probationers consent to searches as a condition\n10 of probation).  This category of arrestees is further reduced when probationers arrested for\n11 crimes involving violence, drugs, or weapons are excluded.  Furthermore, the Court assumes\nt\nr\nu 12 that none of the arrestees in this category had a prior conviction–including their conviction\no\nC\n  13 underlying the period of probation at issue–involving drugs, violence or weapons because\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 otherwise they could fall into the “criminal history” category and validly be strip searched.\ns D ct of 15 Defendants correctly assert that probationers do not benefit from the same protections\nte stri\na Di16 as average citizens and therefore they have a diminished expectation of privacy.  See United\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 States v. Knights, 534 U.S. 112 (2001). Defendants essentially argue that under the Wolfish\nUnit or the 18 balancing test, that diminished expectation of privacy reduces the threshold for institutional\nF\n19 security concerns sufficiently to defeat summary judgment.  Yet probationers maintain some\n20 privacy rights.  See Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 712 (“Convicted prisoners ... retain some\n21 constitutional liberties.”).   Therefore, the Fourth Amendment requires that some nexus exists\n22 between the security needs of the institution and a strip search of individuals arrested for\n23 violating probation.  In fact, the enacted policy must be reasonably related to the institution’s\n24 interest in safety.  See Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 713.  In this narrow category of arrestees who\n25 were neither previously convicted of, nor presently charged with, offenses associated with\n26 heightened risks of concealing contraband, the mere fact that an individual was arrested for a\n27 probation violation is insufficient to warrant a strip search.  Some degree of individualized\n28 suspicion that a probation violator poses a safety risk must exist in order to justify a strip\n14\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 247     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 15 of 35(cid:10)\n1 search.  Yet defendants had no individualized suspicion of security risks when strip searching\n2 individuals pursuant to this categorical policy.  As a result, the Court finds unconstitutional\n3 defendants’ policy of strip searching probation violators for whom consent to searches of\n4 their persons was not a condition of probation.  See Marriott v. County of Montgomery, 227\n5 F.R.D. 159 (N.D.N.Y. 2005) (preliminarily enjoining county policy of strip searching\n6 probation violators).  Thus plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment as to this narrow\n7 category is GRANTED.\n8 D. Arrestees Transferred from/to Other Jurisdictions\n9 Plaintiffs challenge the policy as it relates to categories of arrestees who were strip\n10 searched because they were (1) arrested on a San Francisco warrant outside of San Francisco\n11 County, (2) arrested on a U.S. Marshal hold, or (3) held at a San Francisco jail while in\nt\nr\nu 12 transit to another part of the state.  The Court first notes that both parties’ arguments\no\nC\n  13 regarding these categories are vague, speculative, and generalized.  As a result, it is difficult\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 for the Court to determine with any precision whether arrestees in this category are any\ns D ct of 15 different from those arrested in San Francisco who were subject to the former strip search\nte stri\na Di16 policy.  But see Decl. of Ellen Brin ISO Mot. for Reconsideration.\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 It is, however, clear that defendants’ justification for strip searching arrestees in these\nUnit or the 18 categories because they may have had contact visits from lawyers or doctors is insufficient to\nF\n19 withstand careful scrutiny.9  Defendants contend that state law permits arrestees housed in\n20 jail to receive contact visits from professionals such as their attorney, physicians, surgeons,\n21 or psychologists.  See Def. Mem. at 4 n.3.  Yet defendants provide no evidence that any\n22 professional has attempted to smuggle contraband into the jail through a client or patient. \n23 The Court is unwilling, without any evidence to the contrary, to accept the notion that\n24 professionals who work within the criminal justice system would conspire with arrestees to\n25 introduce contraband to the general jail population.  Therefore the Court is unpersuaded by\n26 the argument that this type of contact visit poses a risk to jail security.\n27\n9Defendants present no argument or evidence that anyone other than legal or medical\n28 professionals can visit with arrestees in these categories.  Accordingly, the Court makes no\nfindings regarding any contact visits from the general public.\n15\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 247     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 16 of 35(cid:10)\n1 Defendants also argue, and plaintiffs appear to concede, that at least some of the\n2 arrestees in these categories mingled with the general jail population before being transferred\n3 to San Francisco.  This presents a different scenario from that of the line of Ninth Circuit\n4 case law, beginning with Giles, holding strip search policies unconstitutional by\n5 distinguishing Wolfish.  There, the fact that pre-arraignment arrestees could not anticipate\n6 intermingling with the general jail population raised the threshold of individualized suspicion\n7 necessary to justify a strip search.  See Giles, 746 F.2d at 617 (distinguishing the planned\n8 visits in Wolfish from the “unplanned events” of being arrested and confined in County jail\n9 and noting that “the policy could not possibly deter arrestees from carrying contraband”). \n10 But where an arrestee has knowledge that he may intermingle with the general jail population\n11 in San Francisco, a different scenario is presented which leaves open the possibility that\nt\nr\nu 12 contraband could be intentionally smuggled into a San Francisco jail.  The Court cannot say\no\nC\n  13 as a matter of law based on this record that searches pursuant to these categories are\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 unconstitutional because it is possible that the heightened risk to institutional security\ns D ct of 15 outweighs the arrestees’ privacy interests in some instances.  Furthermore, the Court is\nte stri\na Di16 unwilling to make a determination as a matter of law based on speculative, conclusory and\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 disputed allegations.  While the Court’s analysis with regard to classification searches above\nUnit or the 18 would apply to any arrestees whose first contact with the criminal justice system occurred at\nF\n19 County Jail No. 9, it is impossible to determine from the record whether anyone fits that\n20 description.  Accordingly, plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment regarding these three\n21 categories is DENIED.\n22 E. Consent Searches\n23 Plaintiffs contend that defendants’ former custom and practice of strip searching\n24 arrestees upon their consent was unconstitutional.  Defendants did not oppose plaintiff’s\n25 motion as to this category of strip searches.  Still, in order to prevail on such a claim,\n26 plaintiffs must show that consent was not freely given as a matter of law.  See United States\n27 v. Chan-Jimenez, 125 F.3d 1324, 1327 (9th Cir. 1997) (citing Schneckloth v. Bustamonte,\n28 412 U.S. 218 (1973)).  Under the totality of the circumstances analysis required here, the\n16\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 247     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 17 of 35(cid:10)\n1 Ninth Circuit has identified five factors to be considered in determining the voluntariness of\n2 a strip search. See United States v. Patayan Soriano, 361 F.3d 494 (9th Cir. 2004) (citing\n3 cases).  Those that are relevant here include whether (1) the person was in custody; (2) the\n4 officer had his weapon drawn or was otherwise threatening force; and (3) the officer\n5 informed the suspect of his right to refuse consent.  Id. at 502.  The Ninth Circuit has never\n6 applied these factors to consent for a strip search, but it is self-evident that, at a minimum,\n7 factors that are relevant to the search of an automobile would be relevant to the more\n8 invasive procedure of a strip search.10\n9 This inquiry is a fact-intensive one that requires a careful evaluation of evidence\n10 relating to a determination of voluntariness.  The Court, however, does not decide the validity\n11 of an individual search pursuant to this policy.  In order to rule on the constitutionality of this\nt\nr\nu 12 category of searches, the Court must therefore find that, as a matter of law, consent to a strip\no\nC\n  13 search under this custom or practice could not have been voluntary under the circumstances\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 at County Jail No. 9.11  Moreover, two conflicting factors relating to every consent search are\ns D ct of 15 not in dispute.  First, all those searched were in custody.  Second, all those searched\nte stri\na Di16 affirmatively signed a piece of paper acknowledging their consent.  Neither factor, however,\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 is dispositive.\nUnit or the 18 Plaintiffs present substantial evidence that it was the custom and practice of CCSF\nF\n19 officers to present a consent form to every arrestee who arrived at County Jail No. 9,\n20 regardless of whether there was reasonable suspicion that any individual arrestee may have\n21 been concealing contraband.  The practice included an altered “Strip Search Authorization”\n22 form on which a “consent to search” line was added and that was presented to eligible\n23 arrestees immediately after booking and prior to classification.  Plaintiffs allege that more\n24\n10Moreover, it is the government’s burden to show that consent was voluntary.  See Chan-\n25 Jimenez, 125 F.3d at 1327 (“In order to establish the validity of a consent to search, the\ngovernment bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that the consent was freely given.”).  Yet\n26 even though defendants have not met their burden because they did not oppose plaintiff’s\nmotion, the Court must still analyze plaintiffs’ claim in order to grant summary. \n27\n11Arrestees  who  were  charged  with  crimes  involving  weapons,  drugs  or  violence\n28 apparently were not asked for their consent to be searched under this custom.  See Deposition\nof Stephanie Quock at 16:4-14.  These arrestees, however, are not a part of the class here. \n17\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 247     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 18 of 35(cid:10)\n1 than 4,000 arrestees signed a consent to search form.  Moreover, pursuant to this practice, if\n2 an arrestee did not consent to a search, he would ultimately be strip searched after being\n3 classified following booking.   Furthermore, plaintiffs proffer evidence that force was used if\n4 an arrestee refused to be strip searched.  See Deposition of Suzette Humphrey at 84:10-12.  \n5 In other words, plaintiffs argue that arrestees did not have a choice whether to be strip\n6 searched or not and therefore consent to a search could not be voluntary.\n7 Yet the evidence in the record submitted by plaintiffs belies this contention.  See\n8 Deposition fo Eldred Oaks at 37:24-38:7 (noting that the custom included Sheriff’s deputies\n9 “explaining to the individual that their charges were not strip-able” before asking them if\n10 they would agree to be strip searched).   Even assuming arguendo that this choice was\n11 “illusory,” as plaintiffs contend, and that the arrestees would be strip searched regardless of\nt\nr\nu 12 whether they consented or not, it is not clear from the record if arrestees knew this when they\no\nC\n  13 consented to the search.  If they did not know that their choice was illusory, it is not clear that\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 consent to a search under these circumstances was involuntary.  Moreover, although it may\ns D ct of 15 exist, there is no evidence currently before the Court that officers threatened the use of force\nte stri\na Di16 at the time consent was requested or that arrestees were otherwise pressured into giving\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 consent.  Consequently, the Court is unwilling to draw broad conclusions from a limited\nUnit or the 18 factual record when a fact-intensive inquiry is appropriate, particularly where even the\nF\n19 limited evidence submitted indicates that at least some searches may have been voluntary. \n20 The Court cannot say that, as a matter of law, that no consent to a search could have been\n21 voluntary under the circumstances.  Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment as to consent\n22 searches is therefore DENIED.\n23 F.   Safety Cell Searches\n24 Plaintiffs also challenge the Department’s policy of automatically strip searching\n25 detainees on the sole basis that they have been designated for placement in a safety cell. \n26 Detainees were placed in a safety cell if they fit into one of six categories:  \n27 1.  She/he displays bizarre behavior which results in the destruction of property.  \n2.  She/he displays bizarre behavior which reveals an intent to cause self-inflicted\n28 harm.  \n3.  She/he appears gravely disabled and less restrictive housing is unavailable.  \n18\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 247     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 19 of 35(cid:10)\n1 4.  She/he appears to be a danger to self or others.  \n5.  She/he requests to use the safety cell.  \n2 6.  For observation only, if it is determined by direct observation that the prisoner has\ningested items that may cause injury.  \n3\n“Safety Cell Use” I.A.  From these classifications it appears that individuals were generally\n4\nplaced in a safety cell, and therefore strip searched, if prison officials determined that the\n5\nindividual appeared to be suffering from mental illness or was otherwise mentally unstable\n6\nsuch that there was a perceived risk that the detainee might engage in violent or self-\n7\ndestructive conduct.  Plaintiffs contend that the categories themselves do not indicate\n8\nwhether there is individualized suspicion to suspect that an arrestee is concealing contraband,\n9\nand therefore seek a ruling that the policy is unconstitutional on its face.\n10\nThe Court first notes that the law on this subject is not clearly established.  Neither\n11\nt party has found any case that discusses strip searches of pre-arraignment detainees based on\nr\nu 12\no\nC the determination that the individual is psychologically unstable.  Of course, such detainees\n  13\nt\nic nia present unique and substantial safety concerns that prison officials should be free to address,\nistr Califor14 in part, by ensuring that the detainees are not hiding weapons or other contraband that may be\ns D ct of 15\nte stri used to harm themselves or others.  Defendants here have presented evidence that mentally\na Di16\nSt ern  unstable detainees in San Francisco’s jail system have hidden contraband and have used such\n  h\nUnited or the Nort1178 contraband in attempts to harm themselves or others.  These findings are even more serious\nF in light of the Eighth Amendment obligations of jail managers to take reasonable precautions\n19\nto prevent prisoner suicide.  See Woodward v. Correctional Medical Services, 368 F.3d 917,\n20\n929 (7th Cir. 2004).  \n21\nStanding against these valid safety concerns are the fundamental privacy interests that\n22\nare infringed by the extreme intrusiveness of a strip search.  These interests are no less\n23\nprofound when the subject of the search is mentally disturbed.  See Aiken v. Nixon, 236\n24\nF.Supp.2d 211, 233 (N.D.N.Y. 2002) (discussing privacy interests in the context of strip\n25\nsearches of individuals held in a psychiatric hospital). \n26\nThe interests at stake in safety cell searches (prison safety and prisoner privacy) are\n27\ntherefore identical to those considered in Giles and its progeny.  The Court therefore finds\n28\nthat the Giles requirement of reasonable individualized suspicion that an arrestee is\n19\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 247     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 20 of 35(cid:10)\n1 concealing contraband is the appropriate test for strip searches of pre-arraignment detainees\n2 believed to be a danger to themselves or others.  See Aiken, 236 F.Supp.2d at 233-34\n3 (adopting “reasonable suspicion” standard for strip searches of individuals who voluntarily\n4 admitted themselves into a psychiatric hospital).  As articulated by Giles, important factors\n5 include “the nature of the offense, the arrestee’s appearance and conduct, and the prior arrest\n6 record.”  746 F.2d at 617.  Of course, in this context, unlike the categorical searches upon\n7 classification, the conduct of the arrestees is an important factor.  For example, conduct\n8 indicating a detainee may be mentally disturbed in a manner that may lead to unpredictable\n9 and potentially harmful conduct could serve as a valid justification for a search.  In addition,\n10 the searches may be based on a suspicion that types of “contraband” not ordinarily believed\n11 to be dangerous, such as shoelaces and other items used for self-strangulation, may be\nt\nr\nu 12 hidden.  Nonetheless, the basic framework articulated in Giles remains the appropriate\no\nC\n  13 analytical procedure to evaluate these claims.  That is, the mere fact of illustrating\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 characteristics of being mentally disturbed is not sufficient to justify a strip search.\ns D ct of 15 Turning to the policy at issue, the constitutionality of a policy that requires that all\nte stri\na Di16 individuals placed in a safety cell be strip searched depends on the reasons for the safety cell\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 placement.  Under Giles, if the policy requires a reasonable individualized suspicion that the\nUnit or the 18 detainee may be concealing drugs or other dangerous contraband, then the policy should be\nF\n19 upheld.  In the context of mentally unstable detainees, this Court finds that individualized\n20 suspicion can be founded upon behavior or circumstances indicating that the detainee may be\n21 a danger to himself or others.  Such behavior gives rise to legitimately heightened concerns\n22 that the detainee could be concealing “contraband” that might be used for harmful purposes,\n23 and thus serves as a reasonable basis for a strip search.  Moroever, to the extent that an\n24 officer believes that an arrestee acting in a bizarre manner is under the influence of a\n25 controlled substance, that amounts to individualized reasonable suspicion and that arrestee is\n26 not a member of the class. \n27 Here, some criteria identified by the policy at issue are reasonably related to this\n28 security interest.  These are categories 2 (“bizarre behavior” and “intent to cause self-\n20\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 247     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 21 of 35(cid:10)\n1 inflicted harm”); 4 (“danger to self or others”); and 6 (“ingested items that may cause\n2 injury”).  However, the other categories do not reveal a similar level of relatedness to the\n3 interest in safety.  Category 1 (“bizarre behavior” and “destruction of property”), for\n4 example, could be applied to an individual who has done nothing more than acted in a\n5 “bizarre” fashion and caused disruption at the jail.  Category 3 (“gravely disabled” and\n6 “housing unavailable”) could easily be applied to a physically disabled person who for safety\n7 reasons should not be placed in an ordinary cell.  Similarly, there is no requirement in\n8 category 5 (“requests to use the safety cell”) that an officer make an individualized\n9 determination that the detainee raises safety concerns.  See Aiken, 236 F.Supp.2d at 233-34\n10 (concluding that individuals who voluntarily admit themselves to a psychiatric ward do not\n11 surrender all privacy protections and that strip searches of such admittees must be based on\nt\nr\nu 12 reasonable suspicion of concealed drugs or weapons, but not other concealed items).\no\nC\n  13 Plaintiffs would have this Court go further and declare all of the safety cell categories\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 to be so overbroad and vague as to be unconstitutional on their face.  Admittedly, none of the\ns D ct of 15 categories are defined with objective terms that substantially constrain the individual\nte stri\na Di16 officer’s discretion.  However, the process of identifying particular conduct that is indicative\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 of psychiatric disturbance which in turn signals a propensity for violent or self-destructive\nUnit or the 18 conduct is inherently subjective and cannot be easily reduced to objective terms.  For this\nF\n19 reason, officers must be given considerable latitude in making this kind of determination. \n20 Thus it was reasonable for the Department to craft a policy that leaves broad discretion with\n21 the individual officer.  \n22 However, since such discretion is to be exercised by the individual officers, the Fourth\n23 Amendment analysis must focus on the factors considered by those officers.  An individual\n24 officer’s subjective finding that a detainee was a danger to self or others, without any facts\n25 articulated in support, is not enough to end the inquiry into whether a particular search was\n26 constitutional.  Thus, although the Department’s policy of allowing individual officers broad\n27 discretion to determine which detainees pose a danger to themselves or others is not\n28 unconstitutional on its face, plaintiffs may still prevail on their section 1983 claims by\n21\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 247     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 22 of 35(cid:10)\n1 showing that the individual officers exercised such discretion in an unconstitutional manner. \n2 For example, plaintiff Miki Mangosing was placed in a safety cell and strip searched\n3 pursuant to the determination that she was a danger to herself.  Records indicate that she was\n4 perceived to be under the influence, out of control and unable to remain in a sobering cell. \n5 Whether these and other facts support the responsible officers’ conclusion that Mangosing\n6 was a risk to herself is a question to be resolved by the appropriate factfinder, but it is\n7 possible that the officer’s conclusion was invalid even though the category itself is\n8 constitutional.\n9 In summary, the Court finds that the Department’s policy of strip searching all\n10 individuals placed in a safety cell, without regard for the reasons for the particular placement,\n11 is unconstitutional on its face.  Further, even with respect to searches conducted under the\nt\nr\nu 12 policy pursuant to the determination that a detainee is a danger to self or others, that\no\nC\n  13 determination is not enough by itself to justify a search.  In such cases, where a plaintiff can\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 show that the individual officer had not conducted the search based on reasonable suspicion\ns D ct of 15 (i.e. where the officer was unreasonable in finding that the detainee was a danger to self or\nte stri\na Di16 others) there may be liability pursuant to section 1983.  Accordingly, plaintiffs motion for\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 summary judgment is GRANTED as to safety cell categories 1, 3, and 5 but DENIED as to\nUnit or the 18 safety cell categories 2, 4, and 6.\nF\n19 III.   As-Applied Challenges by Individual Plaintiffs \n20 A. Plaintiffs Zern and Corneau\n21 In addition to their facial attack on the Department’s policy as a whole, plaintiffs ask\n22 the Court to determine that plaintiffs Jonah Zern and Marcie Corneau are members of the\n23 class.  Specifically, plaintiffs challenge the argument that these two individuals were arrested\n24 on charges of violence.  \n25 Zern was charged with a violation of California Penal Code section 148.10, which\n26 describes the crime of: \n27 resist[ing] a peace officer in the discharge or attempt to discharge\nany duty of his or her office or employment and [where the]\n28 willful resistance proximately causes death or serious bodily\ninjury to a peace officer \n22\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 247     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 23 of 35(cid:10)\n1 See Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 705 (referring to statutory definition in the process of determining\n2 whether a particular charge is a charge of violence).  Plaintiffs claim that this charge is not\n3 sufficient to provide reasonable suspicion because the statute does not require that the\n4 injuries to the officer result from force or violence.  \n5 The Ninth Circuit has held that “in some cases, the charge itself may give rise to\n6 reasonable suspicion.” Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 716 (citing Thompson 885 F.2d at 1447).  In\n7 Thompson the Court held that the charge of grand theft auto provided reasonable suspicion\n8 because that crime is “sufficiently associated with violence.”  Thompson, 885 F.2d at 1447. \n9 Similarly, although a violation of Penal Code section 148.10 does not necessarily involve\n10 force or violence, the crime is sufficiently related to violent conduct that the charge by itself\n11 justifies a strip search.\nt\nr\nu 12 The same is true with respect to plaintiff Corneau.  She was arrested and charged\no\nC\n  13 pursuant to California Penal Code section 243(e), which criminalizes a battery “committed\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 against a spouse. . . .”  Battery is defined under California law as “any willful and unlawful\ns D ct of 15 use of force or violence upon the person of another.”  Cal. Penal Code § 242.  Once again,\nte stri\na Di16 although plaintiffs may be correct that a violation of section 243(e) does not necessarily\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 involve violence, the crime is sufficiently associated with violent criminal conduct to justify\nUnit or the 18 a strip search.\nF\n19 Therefore, plaintiffs Zern and Corneau are not members of the class.  Defendants have\n20 renewed their earlier motion for summary judgment as to these plaintiffs.  Because the Court\n21 finds that the searches conducted on these individuals was based on reasonable suspicion, the\n22 motion is GRANTED.\n23 B.   Plaintiffs Bull, Mangosing and Timbrook\n24 The Ninth Circuit case law related to strip searches establishes that even where the\n25 strip search policy is determined to be unconstitutional, a particular search may still be found\n26 valid if the circumstances of the individual case created an individualized reasonable\n27 suspicion.  Plaintiffs contend that there is no basis for concluding that there was a reasonable\n28 suspicion as to plaintiffs Mary Bull, Miki Mangosing, and Laura Timbrook.  However,\n23\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 247     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 24 of 35(cid:10)\n1 plaintiffs Bull and Mangosing were each searched pursuant to the Department’s safety cell\n2 policy.  The Court previously noted that these types of searches are deeply grounded in the\n3 particular circumstances of the search and do not lend themselves easily to a broad brush\n4 approach.  Moreover, there is substantial evidence in the record from which a reasonable\n5 factfinder could conclude that both Bull and Mangosing were searched based on a reasonable\n6 suspicion that they might harm themselves or others.  For example, an initial psychological\n7 report regarding Bull states that she was “completely out of touch with reality,” that “[s]he\n8 murmurs and smiles to herself very inappropriately,” that “she is not responding to contact,”\n9 and that she “[a]t times seems to be talking to someone invisible.”  A housing report\n10 regarding Mangosing states that she was “out of control.”  Accepting these accounts as true\n11 and viewing them in the light most favorable to defendants, it is clear that summary judgment\nt\nr\nu 12 should be DENIED as to whether reasonable suspicion existed to strip search these plaintiffs.\no\nC\n  13 However, the Court reaches a different conclusion with respect to plaintiff Timbrook. \nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 The record reveals that Timbrook was arrested pursuant to warrants for displaying a false\ns D ct of 15 identification, possession of a forged check with intent to defraud and burglary.  After arrest,\nte stri\na Di16 Timbrook was classified for housing in the general jail population.  Defendant has not\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 opposed the motion for summary judgment in Timbrook’s favor and the Court finds nothing\nUnit or the 18 in the record that would support the conclusion that there was reasonable individualized\nF\n19 suspicion which supported the decision to strip search her.  As such, the motion is\n20 GRANTED with respect to plaintiff Timbrook. \n21 IV.   Qualified Immunity\n22 Sheriff Michael Hennessey moves for partial summary judgment on his defense of\n23 qualified immunity, claiming that the law discussed above was not sufficiently clearly\n24 established at the time the policy was in effect and that he was reasonable in crafting it as he\n25 did.  \n26 Qualified immunity protects “government officials . . . from liability for civil damages\n27 insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights\n28 of which a reasonable person would have known.”  Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818\n24\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 247     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 25 of 35(cid:10)\n1 (1982).  Qualified immunity operates “to ensure that before they are subjected to suit,\n2 officers are on notice their conduct is unlawful.”  Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 206 (2001). \n3 In considering a claim of qualified immunity, a court must first determine whether the\n4 plaintiffs have alleged the deprivation of an actual constitutional right.  See id. at 201.  If\n5 they have, the court must then determine whether that right was clearly established at the\n6 time of the violation.  See id.   The relevant inquiry is whether it would be clear to a\n7 reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.  Id. at 202. \n8 The clearly established test is met if “‘in light of the pre-existing law the unlawfulness [is]\n9 apparent.’”  Galvin v. Hay, 361 F.3d 1134, 1139 (9th Cir. 2004) (quoting Hope v. Pelzer, 536\n10 U.S. 730, 739 (2002)).  Even if an officer’s actions violate a constitutional right, a reasonable\n11 but mistaken belief that his conduct was lawful would result in the grant of qualified\nt\nr\nu 12 immunity.  Wilkins v. City of Oakland, 350 F.3d 949, 955 (9th Cir. 2003).\no\nC\n  13 Here, Sheriff Hennessey is not protected by qualified immunity from a suit based on\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 his decision to create a blanket policy of strip searching all individuals classified for housing\ns D ct of 15 in the general jail population.  As discussed above, the policy did violate plaintiffs’\nte stri\na Di16 constitutional rights.  Moreover, the right was clearly established: in an unbroken line of\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 precedent tracing back to 1984, the Ninth Circuit has reaffirmed the fundamental holding of\nUnit or the 18 Giles that a strip search of a pre-arraignment detainee must be supported by reasonable\nF\n19 individualized suspicion.  It was also abundantly clear after Thompson that placement in the\n20 general jail population cannot “by itself cannot justify a strip search.”  Thompson, 885 F.2d\n21 at 1447.  Given this clear precedent, the Court finds that reasonable minds could not differ as\n22 to what the law required.  The Sheriff’s motion is therefore DENIED as to classification\n23 searches.\n24 The legal landscape was far different as to safety cell strip searches.  At the time the\n25 policy was made there was little if any authority regarding searches of mentally ill or\n26 intoxicated detainees in a jail setting.  Although this Court finds that Giles provides\n27 substantial guidance regarding how this question should be addressed, that precedent does\n28 not necessarily compel the result reached here.  Accordingly, the law regarding safety cell\n25\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 247     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 26 of 35(cid:10)\n1 searches was not clearly established and therefore Sheriff Hennessey’s motion is GRANTED\n2 on this issue.\n3 Sheriff Hennessey’s motion also is GRANTED with regard to the criminal history\n4 category because the Court found there is no constitutional violation.  The Sheriff’s motion is\n5 further GRANTED with regard to probation searches, because even though the Court found\n6 searches of probationers who did not consent to searches of their persons as conditions of\n7 probation to be unconstitutional, the Sheriff could have reasonably thought that probationers’\n8 reduced rights allowed them to be strip searched upon an arrest for a probation violation. \n9 Moreover, there is no clearly established law in the Ninth Circuit to the contrary.  \n10 There is no clearly established law relating to searches of arrestees who were\n11 transferred to or from other jurisdictions.  It is reasonable–and arguably wise–for the Sheriff\nt\nr\nu 12 to operate with the utmost care when arrestees arrive at County Jail No. 9 from other\no\nC\n  13 jurisdictions because of the possibility of pre-arranged contraband smuggling.  The Court is\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 particularly wary here of its “limited role” in judging the policy decisions law enforcement\ns D ct of 15 personnel must make, and the Court further recognizes that some categorization is necessary\nte stri\na Di16 to effectively secure jails.  See Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 712 (“Corrections officials possess\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 special expertise in this area and must struggle regularly to maintain security in a most\nUnit or the 18 difficult and potentially explosive setting.”).  An individual analysis may ultimately reveal\nF\n19 that many of those arrestees never intermingled with the general jail population and arrived at\n20 County Jail No. 9 immediately after their arrest, but the Sheriff’s policy nevertheless was\n21 reasonable in light of the absence of clearly established law and the significant responsibility\n22 he possesses to protect the safety of the jails.  Therefore, the Court finds that the Sheriff’s\n23 motion is GRANTED as to arrestees who were transferred to or from other jurisdictions.\n24 As to the remaining category–consent searches–any individual liability to the Sheriff\n25 is derived only from his role as a supervisor to other officers who performed the consent\n26 searches because those searches were not a part of his official policy and he did not conduct\n27 any of the searches himself.  A supervisor generally “is only liable for constitutional\n28 violations of his subordinates if the supervisor participated in or directed the violations, or\n26\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 247     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 27 of 35(cid:10)\n1 knew of the violations and failed to act to prevent them.”  Taylor v. List, 880 F.2d 1040,\n2 1045 (9th Cir. 1989).  Here, there is evidence in the record to support a finding that the\n3 Sheriff did not know about the consent searches, and upon discovering this practice took\n4 action to prevent the continued use of such searches.  See Memorandum from Captain\n5 Richard Dyer, February 11, 2003.  Therefore, even though the Court can not determine\n6 whether the consent searches were unconstitutional, the Sheriff would nevertheless not be\n7 individually liable for the practice.  Accordingly, the Sheriff’s motion for qualified immunity\n8 with regard to the consent searches is GRANTED.\n9 V.   Monell Claims\n10 In their answer, defendants assert the affirmative defense that “[t]he complaint fails to\n11 state a federal civil rights claim against the defendants under the doctrine announced in\nt\nr\nu 12 Monell v. Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978).”  Plaintiffs move for\no\nC\n  13 summary judgment that this defense is inapplicable.  \nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 In Monell, the Supreme Court held that if the “execution of a government’s policy or\ns D ct of 15 custom, whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to\nte stri\na Di16 represent official policy, inflicts the injury [then] the government as an entity is responsible\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 under § 1983.”  Id. at 694.  To establish such municipal liability, a plaintiff must satisfy four\nUnit or the 18 conditions: “(1) that [the plaintiff] possessed a constitutional right of which he was deprived; \nF\n19 (2) that the municipality had a policy;  (3) that this policy ‘amounts to deliberate indifference’\n20 to the plaintiff's constitutional right;  and (4) that the policy is the ‘moving force behind the\n21 constitutional violation.’”  Van Ort v. Estate of Stanewich, 92 F.3d 831, 835 (9th Cir. 1996)\n22 (quoting Oviatt v. Pearce, 954 F.2d 1470, 1474 (9th Cir.1992) (citation omitted)).\n23 It is clear that the Department’s policy requiring strip searches of all individuals\n24 classified for housing creates municipal liability under Monell.  Defendant has not contested\n25 this was an official written policy of the CCSF.  Nor is there any dispute that the policy was\n26 the “moving force” behind the constitutional violations.  The policy clearly required\n27 individual officers to search all detainees classified for housing, without consideration of\n28\n27\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 247     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 28 of 35(cid:10)\n1 individualized suspicion.  The CCSF is therefore liable under Monell.  As such, plaintiff’s\n2 motion for summary judgment on that issue is GRANTED.\n3 Furthermore, to the extent probationers were unconstitutionally strip searched,\n4 defendants present no evidence to dispute that it was done pursuant to the policy.  Likewise,\n5 any strip searches executed pursuant to the policy relating to arrestees transferred to or from\n6 other jurisdictions that are ultimately deemed unconstitutional would be motivated by the\n7 policy, since defendants have presented no evidence that individual officers acted on their\n8 own behalf rather than as directed by the policy.  Therefore, plaintiff’s motion regarding\n9 Monell liability is GRANTED as to these categories.\n10 Plaintiffs acknowledge that the official written policy of the CCSF did not include\n11 authorization for consent searches.  Nevertheless, plaintiffs contend that the consent searches\nt\nr\nu 12 were a custom or informal policy that gives rise to Monell liability.  See Monell, 436 U.S. at\no\nC\n  13 690-691 (“[L]ocal governments ... may be sued for constitutional deprivations visited\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 pursuant to governmental ‘custom’ even though such a custom has not received formal\ns D ct of 15 approval through the body’s official decision-making channels.”).  The CCSF may be liable\nte stri\na Di16 if plaintiffs’ injury results from a custom that is a “permanent and well-settled” practice.\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 Thompson, 885 F.2d at 1444.  See also Gomez v. Vernon, 255 F.3d 1118, 1127 (9th Cir.\nUnit or the 18 2001) (condoning unconstitutional acts by the failure to investigate or correct the repeated\nF\n19 violations creates a policy or custom which permits the issuance of an injunction against the\n20 administrators in their official capacity).  Once such a showing is made, a local government\n21 may be liable for its custom “irrespective of whether official policymakers had actual\n22 knowledge of the practice at issue.”  Thompson, 885 F.2d at 1444. \n23 Here, plaintiffs have submitted substantial evidence that it was the custom and\n24 practice of the CCSF to ask all arrestees not charged with crimes involving violence, drugs or\n25 weapons, to sign a form consented to be strip searched.  More than 4,000 arrestees signed\n26 consent forms.  Moreover, a number of officers and supervisors of the City testified that\n27 consent searches were the common practice at CCSF, at least until the CCSF took action to\n28 end the practice by circulating a memorandum to that effect.  See Feb. 11 Dyer Memo. \n28\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 247     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 29 of 35(cid:10)\n1 Therefore, the Court finds that the CCSF had a custom and practice of using consent searches\n2 to strip search arrestees.  Although the Court cannot make a determination as to the\n3 constitutionality of the consent searches here, the CCSF would be liable under Monell for\n4 such searches, if any, that were unconstitutional and were conducted from the\n5 commencement of the class period until February 11, 2003, when the memo was circulated.\n6 Monell liability for the safety cell strip search policy presents a close question. \n7 Plaintiffs have not presented evidence that the failure of the department to provide more\n8 specific restrictions on safety cell strip searches was the “moving force” behind the alleged\n9 violations of the detainees’ constitutional rights.  Instead, plaintiffs claim that plaintiff Mary\n10 Bull was subjected to a safety cell strip search because she refused to submit to a\n11 “classification” strip search.  However, even accepting these allegations as true, such conduct\nt\nr\nu 12 would amount to a violation of the Department’s safety cell strip search policy and therefore\no\nC\n  13 would not create municipal liability.  See Henry v. County of Shasta, 132 F.3d 512, 521 (9th\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 Cir. 1997) (suggesting that there is no Monell claim where the officers acted “in violation of\ns D ct of 15 the orders or policies that governed their conduct”).  Plaintiffs also contend that Miki\nte stri\na Di16 Mangosing was unconstitutionally strip searched after she was placed in a safety cell\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 pursuant to a finding that she was a danger to herself.  However, the constitutionality of such\nUnit or the 18 a search would depend on whether the individual officers who chose to place her in a safety\nF\n19 cell had reasonable suspicion to believe that she was carrying concealed contraband.  It is\n20 therefore clear that in each of these cases if the search involved was unconstitutional, the\n21 proper defendant would be the individual officers who decided that the search should be\n22 conducted.  Under these circumstances, it is not enough that the Department left substantial\n23 discretion in the hands of the individual officers making safety cell placement\n24 determinations.  In order for there to be municipal liability, plaintiffs must show that the\n25 policy was a moving force behind the constitutional violations and that the Department’s\n26 decision not to further restrict officers’ discretion to order safety cell searches amounted to\n27 deliberate indifference on the part of the policymakers.  Plaintiffs’ have not made such a\n28 showing and therefore their motion for summary judgment on this issue is DENIED.\n29\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 247     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 30 of 35(cid:10)\n1 VI.   Other Affirmative Defenses\n2 Plaintiffs have also moved for summary judgment on defendants’ affirmative defenses\n3 that the Sheriff is not a “person” liable under section 1983 and that the Sheriff is immune\n4 from exemplary and punitive damages.  Plaintiffs also ask for summary judgment with\n5 respect to the affirmative defenses of estoppel, assumption of risk, and comparative\n6 negligence.  Defendants have not opposed any of these motions and plaintiffs have satisfied\n7 their burden of proof in support of these motions; therefore, they are GRANTED.\n8 VII.   State Claims\n9 Plaintiffs also move for summary judgment on their strip search claims under\n10 California Penal Code section 4030 and the California Constitution.   \n11 A.   Penal Code Section 4030\nt\nr\nu 12 California Penal Code Section 4030 makes unlawful and provides civil liability for\no\nC\n  13 certain classes of strip searches of pre-arraignment misdemeanor detainees. Defendants claim\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 that insofar as some members of the class were strip searched after they were declared\ns D ct of 15 eligible for housing in the general jail population, such plaintiffs cannot state a claim for\nte stri\na Di16 relief under section 4030.  The parties’ dispute in this regard centers on two portions of\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 section 4030.  Subdivision (f) of the statute provides in pertinent part:\nUnit or the 18 No person arrested and held in custody on a misdemeanor or\nF infraction offense, except those involving weapons, controlled\n19 substances or violence . . . shall be subjected to a strip search or\nvisual body cavity search prior to placement in the general jail\n20 population, unless a peace officer has determined there is\nreasonable suspicion based on specific and articulable facts to\n21 believe such person is concealing a weapon or contraband, and a\nstrip search will result in the discovery of the weapon or\n22 contraband. \n23 (emphasis added).\n24 Subdivision (g) of section 4030 next provides that:\n25 [N]o person arrested and held in custody on a misdemeanor or\ninfraction offense not involving weapons, controlled substances\n26 or violence, shall be confined in the general jail population unless\nall of the following are true: (i) The person is not cited and\n27 released[;] (ii) The person is not released on his or her own\nrecognizance pursuant to Article 9 (commencing with Section\n28 1318) of Chapter 1 of Title 10 of Part 2[;] (iii) The person is not\n30\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 247     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 31 of 35(cid:10)\n1 able to post bail within a reasonable time not less than three\nhours.\n2\nRelying on several statements in the legislative history, defendants take the position\n3\nthat these two sections, when read together, allow a strip search to be performed either if\n4\nthere is reasonable suspicion or if the three conditions of subdivision (g) are met.  For\n5\nexample, prior to the passage of the bill that became section 4030, the legislative counsel\n6\nconcluded that\n7\n[u]nder the proposed Section 4030 of the Penal Code, a person\n8 may be strip searched prior to the actual placement of the person\nin the general jail population, after the requirements of\n9 subdivision (g) for that placement have been met, without the\nneed for compliance with the requirements of subdivision (f).\n10\n“Strip Searches--#5001” Letter to Honorable Marian Bergeson from Ben E. Dale (Feb. 27,\n11\nt 1984) available at 6 Cal. Assembly Journal 11304 (1983-84 Reg. Sess.).  Statements in the\nr\nu 12\no\nC legislative history by the Senate, Assembly and the Governor at the time of passage adopt the\n  13\nt\nic nia view of the legislative counsel, thus lending further support to defendants’ interpretation.  \nistr Califor14 Plaintiffs respond with a citation to the later opinion of the California Attorney\ns D ct of 15\nte stri General, which concludes that section 4030 prohibits warrantless pre-arraignment strip\na Di16\nSt ern  searches absent reasonable suspicion “prior to the placement of [the detainee] in the general\n  h\nUnited or the Nort1178 population.”  See Cal. Att’y Gen. Opinion No. 88-1201 (July 6, 1989).  \nF The parties dispute arises out of the ambiguity of the phrase “prior to placement in the\n19\ngeneral jail population” that is used in subdivision (f) and repeated by the Attorney General’s\n20\nopinion.  The term “placement” in this phrase could reasonably be interpreted to refer either\n21\nto the physical delivery of a detainee to the “general jail” structure, or any number of points\n22\nin time before then, although after the subdivision (g) requirements are met.  It is an accepted\n23\nprinciple of statutory interpretation that, given such ambiguity, reference to the legislative\n24\nhistory is allowed.  See Day v. City of Fontana, 25 Cal.4th 268, 272 (Cal. 2001); see\n25\ngenerally Stephen Breyer, On the Uses of Legislative History in Interpreting Statutes, 65 S.\n26\nCal. L. Rev. 845 (1992).  Here, the legislative history confirms that “placement” under the\n27\nstatute occurs at some time “prior to the  actual placement of the person in the general jail\n28\npopulation” (emphasis added), but at some point after the three prerequisites for jail\n31\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 247     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 32 of 35(cid:10)\n1 confinement contained in subdivision (g) are met.  Thus the Court finds that section 4030 is\n2 not violated where a warrantless pre-arraignment strip search is performed without\n3 reasonable suspicion prior to a detainee physically arriving in the general jail population.\n4 This, however, does not end the inquiry.  Some ambiguity remains regarding whether\n5 a search may be performed on any prearraignment detainee who satisfies the three conditions\n6 described in subdivision (g).  Defendant claims that these three factors are sufficient to\n7 justify a search under the statute.  The Court rejects this view.  If defendants were correct, the\n8 statute would be reduced to nothing more than a three-hour waiting period for strip searches\n9 of any arrestee who is not able to post bail.  This is true because the nonoccurrence of the\n10 events described in subdivisions (g)(1) and (g)(2) is entirely within the control of the\n11 detaining officials.  Nothing in the legislative history requires such a sweeping result, and the\nt\nr\nu 12 clear text of the statute counsels against it.  The legislative counsel’s opinion states only that\no\nC\n  13 searches may be conducted “prior to . . . actual placement.”  This reasonable statement\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 cannot be converted into the sweeping conclusion that satisfaction of the subdivision (g)\ns D ct of 15 factors alone is both necessary and sufficient to justify a search without reasonable suspicion. \nte stri\na Di16 That view is contrary to the express intent of the statute to protect detainees’ civil rights by\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 limiting strip searches.  See Cal. Penal Code § 4030(a) (“It is the intent of the Legislature in\nUnit or the 18 enacting this section to protect the state and federal constitutional rights of the people of\nF\n19 California . . . by strictly limiting strip and body cavity searches.”).  Rather than adopting this\n20 radical view,12 the Court instead finds that a search without reasonable suspicion may take\n21 place consistent with section 4030 after: (1) the three subdivision (g) conditions are met; and\n22 (2) the circumstances demonstrate that the individual detainee is actually destined for the\n23 general jail population absent some unexpected reason for release. \n24\n25\n26 12The Court also rejects plaintiffs’ view that subdivision (g) prohibits incorporation of an\ninmate into the general jail population prior to an O.R. hearing.  The clear text of the statute is\n27 to  the  contrary  and  requires  only  that  the  detainee  “is  not  released  on  his  or  her  own\nrecognizance pursuant to” Penal Code section 1318 et seq., which governs O.R. releases.  This\n28 language clearly requires only the nonoccurrence of an O.R. release, and creates no substantive\nrights to a hearing prior to housing in the general jail population.   \n32\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 247     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 33 of 35(cid:10)\n1 Here, defendants have asserted that detainees assigned for housing were not strip\n2 searched until detainees were to be “dressed in” attire appropriate for the general jail\n3 population.  Confirming this fact, after removing their own clothes and being strip searched,\n4 inmates were instructed to put on prison uniforms.  Assuming these facts are true, searches\n5 under these circumstances did not run afoul of section 4030.  Therefore, plaintiff’s motion\n6 for summary judgment as to section 4030 is DENIED.\n7 B.   State Law Immunities\n8 Defendants next claim that the city is immune from liability under section 4030\n9 because California Government Code section 844.613 provides immunity for public entities\n10 from suits brought by prisoners.  However, section 4030 was enacted several years after\n11 section 844.6 and explicitly provides a private right of action for any detainee aggrieved by a\nt\nr\nu 12 violation of the state.  See Cal. Penal Code § 4030(p).  Of course, there are only two classes\no\nC\n  13 of conceivable defendants in the civil suits contemplated by this private right of action:\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 public entities making strip search policies and individual officers executing such policies.   \ns D ct of 15 Thus to find that the earlier-enacted immunity prevails over the later-enacted cause of action\nte stri\na Di16 would be to nullify at least half of the potential scope of the private cause of action. \nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 However, the later statute is more specific and does not limit the suits to either of these\nUnit or the 18 classes of defendants.  The Court therefore concludes that immunity on these grounds does\nF\n19 not apply.\n20 Defendants’ similar claim that Sheriff Hennessey is immune from liability under\n21 California Government Code section 820.214 also fails.  That statute opens with the\n22 qualification that it applies “[e]xcept as otherwise provided by statute.”  Cal. Gov’t Code §\n23\n24 13The statute states: “(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, except as\nprovided  in  this  section  and  in  Sections  814,  814.2,  845.4,  and  845.6,  or  in  Title  2.1\n25 (commencing with Section 3500) of Part 3 of the Penal Code, a public entity is not liable for:\n. . .  (2) An injury to any prisoner.”  Cal. Gov’t Code § 844.6.\n26\n27 14The statute states: “Except as otherwise provided by statute, a public employee is not\nliable for an injury resulting from his act or omission where the act or omission was the result\n28 of the exercise of the discretion vested in him, whether or not such discretion be abused.”  Cal.\nGov’t Code § 820.2.\n33\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01840-CRB     Document 247     Filed 02/23/2006     Page 34 of 35(cid:10)\n1 820.2.  As before, the more recent authorization of suit in section 4030 falls squarely within\n2 the statutory exception in section 820.2.  Therefore no immunity applies.\n3 C.   State Constitutional Claims\n4 Defendants claim that plaintiffs’ cause of action brought under the California\n5 Constitution’s privacy clause also fail.  Defendants state that in this context the California\n6 constitution’s privacy protection should be interpreted consistent with federal interpretations\n7 of Fourth Amendment protection.  See In re York, 9 Cal. 4th 1133, 1149 (1995).  Since the\n8 Court has rejected the claim that blanket strip searches of all detainees entering the general\n9 jail population is consistent with the Fourth Amendment, the same argument must also be\n10 rejected here.  Further, defendant has cited no case in which the statutory immunity created\n11 by Government Code section 844.6 was interpreted to be an available defense against a claim\nt\nr\nu 12 brought under the California Constitution’s privacy clause.\no\nC\n  13 D.   Other Defenses\nt\nc a\ni ni\nistr Califor14 Plaintiffs also moved for summary judgment with regard to several other of plaintiffs’\ns D ct of 15 affirmative defenses: that plaintiffs failed to satisfy claim presentment requirements; that\nte stri\na Di16 defendants are immune as public employees engaged in the execution and enforcement of\nSt ern \n  h\ned Nort17 law under Government Code section 820.4; and that defendants are immune as third parties\nUnit or the 18 under Government Code section 820.8.
