    "summary": "<p>On June 22, 1978, juveniles detained at the Yakima County Juvenile Detention Center in Washington brought a class action lawsuit in United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington against the Yakima County Board of County Commissioners, Yakima County Juvenile Superior Court, and the Director of the Yakima County Juvenile Department.  The plaintiffs, represented by Evergreen Legal Services, sought declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 for alleged constitutional violations.  On March 27, 1979, the court certified the class, which included all juveniles confined at the Detention Center on or after June 22, 1978.</p><p>According to the complaint, juveniles confined at the Detention Center were subject to psychological abuse, corporal punishment, and prolonged isolation in an unlit and unventilated room.  Children were locked in their rooms for eighteen hours in a day.  Juveniles were not given shoes for short and infrequent outdoor recreation periods.  Family members were only allowed to visit children for an hour each day and could not give their children gifts.  Detention center staff of the opposite sex strip-searched juveniles and observed them in the showers.  The plaintiffs alleged that medical care, school facilities, mental health counseling, probation counseling, sanitation, toilets, and fire safety were deficient. The plaintiffs complained that disciplinary procedures deprived them of due process.  </p><p>\t</p><p>In the course of settlement talks, it appears that the plaintiffs proposed a Partial Consent Judgment.  On September 30, 1982, the parties entered a Stipulation for Entry of Judgment.  Although the defendants admitted no wrongdoing, they agreed to improve conditions at the Detention Center.  Specific clauses in the consent decree addressed sanitation, safety, hygiene, clothing, censorship of mail, telephone privileges, the length of visits, showering privacy, recreation, exercise, school, medical care, search procedures prohibiting opposite-sex searches, and overcrowding.  In addition, the consent decree prohibited psychological and physical abuse, including corporal punishment.  The parties agreed on guidelines for disciplinary isolation, punitive sanctions, notice, hearings, and a grievance procedure.  The consent decree also addressed minimum daily out of cell time and standards for monitoring the detainees.  On October 7, 1982, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington (Judge Justin L. Quackenbush) approved the consent decree and dismissed the lawsuit. </p><p>The file contains no further information.</p><p></p>",

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n2 Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves\n3 and all other juveniles similarly situated, to remedy the viola-\n4 tion of their fundamental civil rights by the Defendants' unlawful\n5 operation of the Yakima County Juvenile Detention Center.  Plain-\n6 tiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief.\n7\n8 II.  JURISDICTION\n9 1.  This court has jurisdiction over the Defendants\n10 under 28 U.S.C. 1343, the jurisdictional counterpart of the Civil\n11 Rights Act of 1964.\n12\n13 III.  PARTIES\nU 2.  Clarence M. is a 16 year old resident of Yakima\n15 County, currently being held in detention at the Yakima County\n16 Juvenile Detention Ceter.\n17 3.  The Board of Commissioners ,of Yakima County, and\n18 Commissioners Graham Tollefson, Charles J. Klarich, and Les\n19 Conrad, have responsibility Under RCW 13.04.135, and 13.16.030/\n20 et seq., for the Juvenile Detention Facility in Yakima County.\n21 4.  The Yakima County Superior Court, and the Honorable\n22 Bruce Hanson, the Honorable Carl Loy, the Honorable Walter\n23 Stauffacher, the Honorable Blaine Hopp, and the Honorable Howard\n24 Hettinger, have responsibility for the care and commitment of\n25 children in detention under RCW 13.04.035, 13.04.053, and for\n26 the appointment of persons in charge of detention facilities\n27 under RCW 13.04.04 0.\n28 5.  Defendant Paul Peterson is the Director of the\n29 Juvenile Department of Yakima County and as such is responsible\n30 for the operation of the Juvenile Detention Center in Yakima\n31 County.\n32\nAMENDED\nCOMPLAINT  (2)  '\nMiN  LSOAL SCKVICM\nYAKIMA ormcs\n04 UMIMI\n\nC  (1\n1  IV.  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS\n2  6.  This action is properly maintainable as a class\n3  action under FRCP 23(a) and 23(b)(2).  The class is defined as\nA  all children in Yakima County, who are now or may be confined at\n5  the Yakima County Juvenile Detention Center.\n6  7.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members\n7  is impracticable.  Approximately 30,000 to 40,000 children reside\n8  in Yakima County, and may in the future be confined at the\n9  Detention Center, and the population of children actually confined\n10  there is constantly shifting.\n11  8.  Questions of law and fact are common to all members\n12  of the class.  The conditions of confinement at the Yakima County\n13  Detention Center are similar for all children confined there; all\nclass members share the civil rights violated by these conditions.\n15  9.  The claims of the representative party are typical\n16  of the claims of the class.  Plaintiff Clarence M. is currently\n17  confined at the Yakima County Juvenile Detention Center and has\n18  experienced the conditions which are or may be imposed on other\n19  members of the class.\n20  io.  The Plaintiff in this action will fairly and adequate\n21  ly represent the interests of the class.  Clarence M. has no\n22  interests adverse to the interests of other members of the class,\n23  and j.  represented by counsel who are competent and committed to\ns\nthe prosecution of this action.\n25  11.  Defendants have acted, and refused to act, on grounds\ngenerally applicable to the class, by maintaining and operating\nthe Juvenile Detention Center at which all members of the class\nare or may be confined.\n29\n30  V.  STATEMENT OF FACTS\n12.  The named plaintiff, Clarence M., is confined at\nthe Yakima County Juvenile Detention Center pursuant to an order\ni\nAMENDED  EvnanuN LCOAL Scnvicsa\nCOMPLAINT  (3)  VVAAKAIMA orrics\nYAKM*, WASMNOTMI *โข*โข!\n\no\n1 of the Superior Court of Yakima County.\n2 13.  The conditions at the Detention Center include the\n3 following:\n4 a)  Disciplinary measures at the Detention Center\n5 are imposed without reference to any written rules, and without\n6 opportunity for a prior hearing.  The named Plaintiff and other\n7 children confined at the Center are continually subjected to\n8 violence and threats of violence by the Center staff as a means\n9 of behavior control.  Children are commonly placed in a small,\n10 dark, unventilated room for periods of up to 24 hours, punishment\n11 for alleged rule violations.\n12 b)  Staff at the Detention Center are psychologically\n13 abusive to the children placed in their care.  The named Plaintiff\n14 and other children at the Center are subjected to vulgar taunts\n15 and insults from members of the staff, are expected to shower\n16 within sight of staff members of the opposite sex, and are routine-\n17 ly subjected to a degrading strip search after visitation with\n18 their families.\n19 c)  Conditions of confinement at the Center are\n20 unduly restrictive.
