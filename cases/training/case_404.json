    "summary": "<p>On October 23, 1970, patients involuntarily confined for mental treatment purposes at Bryce Hospital in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, filed a class action lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 against the Alabama Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation (DMH/MR) in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, Northern Division. The plaintiffs, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and private counsel, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that conditions at facilities operated by DMH/MR violated residents' rights under state and federal law.</p>\r\n<p>In the 33-year span of this litigation, this case became one of the most celebrated mental health cases.</p>\r\n<p>On March 12, 1971, the District Court (Judge Frank M. Johnson, Jr.) held that the patients were being denied their right to treatment and granted the defendants six months in which to raise the level of care at Bryce. Wyatt v. Stickney, 325 F. Supp. 781 (M.D. Ala. 1971). Judge Johnson reasoned that involuntarily committed patients \"unquestionably have a constitutional right to receive such individual treatment as will give each of them a realistic opportunity to be cured or in to improve his or her mental condition.\" On August 12, 1971, Judge Johnson enlarged the plaintiff class to include patients involuntarily confined at Searcy Hospital and at Partlow State School and Hospital. After the defendants filed their final report, on December 10, 1971, Judge Johnson concluded that the treatment program was deficient for failing to provide (a) a humane psychological and physical environment, (b) qualified staff in number sufficient to administer adequate treatment, and (c) individualized treatment plans. Wyatt v. Stickney, 334 F. Supp. 1341 (M.D. Ala. 1971).</p>\r\n<p>On April 13, 1972, the District Court (Judge Johnson) filed two opinions. In the first, Judge Johnson concluded that the plaintiffs had been denied the right of habilitation, and ordered that minimum standards had to be effectuated at the institutions immediately. Wyatt v. Stickney, 344 F. Supp. 387 (M.D. Ala. 1972). In the second, Judge Johnson issued orders establishing minimal constitutional standards for treatment of persons with mental illness and persons with intellectual disabilities. Wyatt v. Stickney, 344 F. Supp. 373 (M.D. Ala. 1972). The defendants appealed.</p>\r\n<p>On November 8, 1974, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals (Judge John Minor Wisdom) affirmed in relevant part the District Court's April 13, 1972, decisions. Wyatt v. Aderholt, 503 F.2d 1305 (5th Cir. 1974).</p>\r\n<p>In June 1977, the plaintiffs succeeded in obtaining a federal court office to monitor compliance with the Wyatt standards. And on January 15, 1980, the District Court (Judge unknown) entered an order placing DMH/MR in receivership.</p>\r\n<p>The parties engaged in extended negotiations and, in 1986, the parties entered into a consent decree requiring all state facilities to achieve JCAHO accreditation and Title XIX certification. On September 22, 1986, the District Court (Judge Myron H. Thompson) approved the consent decree. Wyatt v. Wallis, No. 3195-N, 1986 WL 69194 (M.D. Ala. Sept. 22, 1986). Under the consent decree, DMH/MR was required to make substantial progress in outplacing persons from state facilities, as well as to develop a system of internal advocacy and quality assurance of care.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Thompson subsequently approved further consent decrees that clarified the licensing requirements, development of treatment plans, supervision of treatment at state mental health facilities, creation and modification of an expert panel, and allowed further plaintiffs to intervene. Wyatt v. Horsley, No. 3195-N (M.D. Ala. July 2, 1991); Wyatt v. King, No. 3195-N (M.D. Ala. Oct. 25, 1991); Wyatt v. King, 793 F. Supp. 1058 (M.D. Ala. 1992).</p>\r\n<p>On July 22, 1991, the District Court found that Alabama's indefinite institutionalization of the involuntarily civilly committed was unconstitutional and ordered the defendants to conduct periodic post-commitment judicial reviews under certain standards. Wyatt v. King, 773 F. Supp. 1508 (M.D. Ala. 1991).</p>\r\n<p>On January 23, 1993, the plaintiffs moved to enforce the 1986 consent decree, claiming that DMH/MR had failed to comply with the 1986 decree and was violating the recently enacted Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. And on December 22, 1994, the District Court (Judge Thompson) recertified the plaintiff class.</p>\r\n<p>After a 35-day summary proceeding, on July 11, 1995, the District Court (Judge Thompson) granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction and denied the defendants' motions to disqualify the judge and to decertify the class. Wyatt v. Rogers, 892 F. Supp. 1410 (M.D. Ala. 1995). The defendants appealed. Judge Thompson held that the injunction was warranted to correct DMH/MR's failure to deal the gang activity, physical and sexual abuse on the part of staff, as well as use of improper methods to restrain children. The defendants appealed.</p>\r\n<p>On August 8, 1996, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals (Judge Gerald Bald Tjoflat) dismissed the appeal. Wyatt v. Rogers, 92 F.3d 1074 (11th Cir. 1996). The Court held that the appeal was rendered moot since the facility was closed during the pendency of the appeal, negating the court's jurisdiction. The Court also set forth procedures the plaintiffs had to follow in order to obtain DMH/MR's compliance with the decree.</p>\r\n<p>On October 8, 1996, the District Court (Judge Thompson) denied the plaintiffs' motion for enforcement of the consent decree. Wyatt v. Rogers, 942 F. Supp. 518 (M.D. Ala. 1996). Judge Thompson found that the plaintiffs failed to follow the procedures set forth by the Eleventh Circuit, and that plaintiffs' procedural failures precluded enforcement under the consent decree.</p>\r\n<p>Subsequently, DMH/MR moved for a finding that DMH/MR had sufficiently complied with the consent decree, allowing the lawsuit to be terminated. On December 15, 1997, the District Court (Judge Thompson) granted the defendants partial release from those provisions of the consent decree with which DMH/MR had complied, and denied the plaintiffs' motion for relief other than under the 1986 consent decree. Wyatt v. Rogers, 985 F. Supp. 1356 (M.D. Ala. 1997). Analyzing the case as a whole, Judge Thompson broke the Wyatt litigation up into four phases: (1) the establishment and extension of the Wyatt standards in the early 1970's; (2) the resumption of litigation in 1975, subsequent receivership and plan of compliance; (3) the resumption of litigation in 1981 resulting in the negotiation of the consent decree, establishment the Wyatt Consultant Committee and subsequent termination of the Consultant Committee; and, (4) the resumption of litigation in 1991, intervention of further plaintiffs, defendants' motions to dismiss and plaintiffs' motions to enforce. Judge Thompson recognized 31 current Wyatt mental-illness standards, organized and addressed them by category: (1) physical living environment and custodial care; (2) personal liberties; (3) treatment and record keeping; (4) medical care; (5) use and administration of psychotropic medications; (6) protection from harm and physical safety; (7) adequate staffing and staff supervision; (8) high risk or unusually restrictive treatment; (9) seclusion and restraint; (10) treatment in the least restrictive environment appropriate and transitional services; and (11) children's services. Judge Thompson found that DMH/MR was not in compliance with Wyatt standards concerning privacy and dignity, least restrictive conditions, visitation rights, freedom from unnecessary medication, freedom from seclusion/physical restraint, physical exercise, outdoors at regular intervals, religion, human environment facilities, supervision of staff, patient treatment, individualized treatment plans, confidentiality of records, transitional treatment post-release and written notice. And Judge Thompson continued the Court's oversight of DMH/MR's compliance with those standards.</p>\r\n<p>In line with the District Court's request that the parties narrow the issues still in contention, on December 9, 1998, the District Court (Judge Thompson) granted the parties' joint motion to release a list of facilities from the consent decree. Wyatt v. Rogers, No. Civ.A. 3195-N, 1998 WL 862920 (M.D. Ala. Dec. 9, 1998).</p>\r\n<p>On October 1, 2000, the parties entered into a three-year settlement agreement. Under the settlement agreement, the Commissioner established work groups to develop compliance plans. And after a fairness hearing to consider a joint motion of compliance with the settlement agreement, on December 5, 2003, the District Court (Judge Thompson) terminated the lawsuit.</p>\r\n<p>There is an interesting video about the suit available here: <a href=\"https://mn.gov/mnddc/parallels2/one/video/wyatt.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://mn.gov/mnddc/parallels2/one/video/wyatt.html</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

On March 12, 1971, in a formal opinion and decree,\nthis Court held that these involuntarily committed patients \"unquestionably have a constitutional right to receive\nsuch individual treatment as will give each of them a realistic opportunity to be cured or to improve his or her\nmental condition.\" The Court further held that patients at Bryce were being denied their right to treatment and that\ndefendants, per their request, would be allowed six months in which to raise the level of care at Bryce to the\nconstitutionally required minimum. Wyatt v. Stickney, 325 F.Supp. 781 (M.D.Ala. 1971). In this decree, the Court\nordered defendants to file reports defining the mission and functions of Bryce Hospital, specifying the objective\nand subjective standards required to furnish adequate care to the treatable mentally ill and detailing the hospital's\nprogress toward the implementation of minimum constitutional standards. Subsequent to this order, plaintiffs, by\n375 motion to amend granted August 12, 1971, enlarged their class to include patients involuntarily *375 confined for\n[1] [2]\nmental treatment at Searcy Hospital  and at Partlow State School and Hospital for the mentally retarded.\nOn September 23, 1971, defendants filed their final report, from which this Court concluded on December 10,\n1971, 334 F.Supp. 1341, that defendants had failed to promulgate and implement a treatment program satisfying\nminimum medical and constitutional requisites. Generally, the Court found that defendants' treatment program\nwas deficient in three fundamental areas. It failed to provide: (1) a humane psychological and physical\nenvironment, (2) qualified staff in numbers sufficient to administer adequate treatment and (3) individualized\ntreatment plans. More specifically, the Court found that many conditions, such as nontherapeutic,\n\nuncompensated work assignments, and the absence of any semblance of privacy, constituted dehumanizing\nfactors contributing to the degeneration of the patients' self-esteem. The physical facilities at Bryce were\novercrowded and plagued by fire and other emergency hazards. The Court found also that most staff members\nwere poorly trained and that staffing ratios were so inadequate as to render the administration of effective\ntreatment impossible. The Court concluded, therefore, that whatever treatment was provided at Bryce was\ngrossly deficient and failed to satisfy minimum medical and constitutional standards. Based upon this conclusion,\n[3]\nthe Court ordered that a formal hearing be held at which the parties and amici  would have the opportunity to\nsubmit proposed standards for constitutionally adequate treatment and to present expert testimony in support of\ntheir proposals.\nPursuant to this order, a hearing was held at which the foremost authorities on mental health in the United States\nappeared and testified as to the minimum medical and constitutional requisites for public institutions, such as\nBryce and Searcy, designed to treat the mentally ill. At this hearing, the parties and amici submitted their\n376 proposed standards, and now have filed briefs in support of them.[4] Moreover, the parties *376 and amici have\nstipulated to a broad spectrum of conditions they feel are mandatory for a constitutionally acceptable minimum\ntreatment program. This Court, having considered the evidence in the case, as well as the briefs, proposed\nstandards and stipulations of the parties, has concluded that the standards set out in Appendix A to this decree\n[5]\nare medical and constitutional minimums. Consequently, the Court will order their implementation.  In so\nordering, however, the Court emphasizes that these standards are, indeed, both medical and constitutional\nminimums and should be viewed as such. The Court urges that once this order is effectuated, defendants not\nbecome complacent and self-satisfied. Rather, they should dedicate themselves to providing physical conditions\nand treatment programs at Alabama's mental institutions that substantially exceed medical and constitutional\nminimums.\nIn addition to asking that their proposed standards be effectuated, plaintiffs and amici have requested other relief\ndesigned to guarantee the provision of constitutional and humane treatment. Pursuant to one such request for\nrelief, this Court has determined that it is appropriate to order the initiation of human rights committees to function\nas standing committees of the Bryce and Searcy facilities. The Court will appoint the members of these\ncommittees who shall have review of all research proposals and all rehabilitation programs, to ensure that the\ndignity and the human rights of patients are preserved. The committees also shall advise and assist patients who\nallege that their legal rights have been infringed or that the Mental Health Board has failed to comply with\njudicially ordered guidelines. At their discretion, the committees may consult appropriate, independent specialists\nwho shall be compensated by the defendant Board. Seven members shall comprise the human rights committee\nfor each institution, the names and addresses of whom are set forth in Appendix B to this decree. Those who\nserve on the committees shall be paid on a per diem basis and be reimbursed for travel expenses at the same\nrate as members of the Alabama Board of Mental Health.\nThis Court will reserve ruling upon other forms of relief advocated by plaintiffs and amici, including their prayer for\n377 the appointment of a master and a professional advisory committee to oversee the implementation of the *377\n[6]\ncourt-ordered minimum constitutional standards.  Federal courts are reluctant to assume control of any\norganization, but especially one operated by a state. This reluctance, combined with defendants' expressed\nintent that this order will be implemented forthwith and in good faith, causes the Court to withhold its decision on\nthese appointments. Nevertheless, defendants, as well as the other parties and amici in this case, are placed on\nnotice that unless defendants do comply satisfactorily with this order, the Court will be obligated to appoint a\nmaster.\nBecause the availability of financing may bear upon the implementation of this order, the Court is constrained to\nemphasize at this juncture that a failure by defendants to comply with this decree cannot be justified by a lack of\noperating funds. As previously established by this Court:\n\"There can be no legal (or moral) justification for the State of Alabama's failing to afford\ntreatment00and adequate treatment from a medical standpoint 00to the several thousand patients\n97 97\nwho have been civilly committed to Bryce's for treatment purposes. To deprive any citizen of his or\nher liberty upon the altruistic theory that the confinement is for humane therapeutic reasons and\n\nthen fail to provide adequate treatment violates the very fundamentals of due process.\" Wyatt v.\nStickney, 325 F.Supp. at 785.\nFrom the above, it follows consistently, of course, that the unavailability of neither funds, nor staff and facilities,\nwill justify a default by defendants in the provision of suitable treatment for the mentally ill.\nDespite the possibility that defendants will encounter financial difficulties in the implementation of this order, this\nCourt has decided to reserve ruling also upon plaintiffs' motion that defendant Mental Health Board be directed to\n[7]\nsell or encumber portions of its land holdings in order to raise funds.  Similarly, this Court will reserve ruling on\nplaintiffs' motion seeking an injunction against the treasurer and the comptroller of the State authorizing\nexpenditures for nonessential State functions, and on other aspects of plaintiffs' requested relief designed to\nameliorate the financial problems incident to the implementation of this order. The Court stresses, however, the\nextreme importance and the grave immediacy of the need for proper funding of the State's public mental health\nfacilities. The responsibility for appropriate funding ultimately must fall, of course, upon the State Legislature and,\nto a lesser degree, upon the defendant Mental Health Board of Alabama. For the present time, the Court will\ndefer to those bodies in hopes that they will proceed with the realization and understanding that what is involved\nin this case is not representative of ordinary governmental functions such as paving roads and maintaining\nbuildings. Rather, what is so inextricably intertwined with how the Legislature and Mental Health Board respond\nto the revelations of this litigation is the very preservation of human life and dignity. Not only are the lives of the\n378 patients currently confined at Bryce and Searcy at stake, but also at issue are the wellbeing *378 and security of\nevery citizen of Alabama. As is true in the case of any disease, no one is immune from the peril of mental illness.\nThe problem, therefore, cannot be overemphasized and a prompt response from the Legislature, the Mental\nHealth Board and other responsible State officials, is imperative.\nIn the event, though, that the Legislature fails to satisfy its well-defined constitutional obligation, and the Mental\nHealth Board, because of lack of funding or any other legally insufficient reason, fails to implement fully the\nstandards herein ordered, it will be necessary for the Court to take affirmative steps, including appointing a\n[8]\nmaster, to ensure that proper funding is realized  and that adequate treatment is available for the mentally ill of\nAlabama.\nThis Court now must consider that aspect of plaintiffs' motion of March 15, 1972, seeking an injunction against\nfurther commitments to Bryce and Searcy until such time as adequate treatment is supplied in those hospitals.\nIndisputably, the evidence in this case reflects that no treatment program at the Bryce-Searcy facilities\napproaches constitutional standards. Nevertheless, because of the alternatives to commitment commonly utilized\nin Alabama, as well as in other states, the Court is fearful that granting plaintiffs' request at the present time\nwould serve only to punish and further deprive Alabama's mentally ill.\nFinally, the Court has determined that this case requires the awarding of a reasonable attorneys' fee to plaintiffs'\ncounsel. The basis for the award and the amount thereof will be considered and treated in a separate order. The\nfee will be charged against the defendants as a part of the court costs in this case.\nTo assist the Court in its determination of how to proceed henceforth, defendants will be directed to prepare and\nfile a report within six months from the date of this decree detailing the implementation of each standard herein\nordered. This report shall be comprehensive and shall include a statement of the progress made on each\nstandard not yet completely implemented, specifying the reasons for incomplete performance. The report shall\ninclude also a statement of the financing secured since the issuance of this decree and of defendants' plans for\nprocuring whatever additional financing might be required. Upon the basis of this report and other available\ninformation, the Court will evaluate defendants' work and, in due course, determine the appropriateness of\nappointing a master and of granting other requested relief.\nAccordingly, it is the order, judgment and decree of this Court:\n1. That defendants be and they are hereby enjoined from failing to implement fully and with dispatch each of the\nstandards set forth in Appendix A attached hereto and incorporated as a part of this decree;\n\n2. That human rights committees be and are hereby designated and appointed. The members thereof are listed\nin Appendix B attached hereto and incorporated herein. These committees shall have the purposes, functions,\nand spheres of operation previously set forth in this order. The members of the committees shall be paid on a per\ndiem basis and be reimbursed for travel expenses at the same rate as members of the Alabama Board of Mental\nHealth;\n379 *379 3. That defendants, within six months from this date, prepare and file with this Court a report reflecting in\ndetail the progress on the implementation of this order. This report shall be comprehensive and precise, and shall\nexplain the reasons for incomplete performance in the event the defendants have not met a standard in its\nentirety.

Ms. Joyce Nickels              00 c/o Searcy Hospital, Mount Vernon, Alabama\n97\n\n[1]\nSearcy Hospital, located in Mount Vernon, Alabama, is also a State institution designed to treat the mentally ill.\nOn September 2, 1971, defendants answered plaintiffs' amended complaint, as it related to Searcy, with the\nfollowing language: \n\"Defendants agree to be bound by the objective and subjective standards ultimately ordered by this Honorable\nCourt in this cause at both Bryce and Searcy.\"\nThis answer obviated the necessity for this Court's holding a formal hearing on the conditions currently existing at\nSearcy. Nevertheless, the evidence in the record relative to Searcy reflects that the conditions at that institution\nare no better than those at Bryce.\n[2] The aspect of the case relating to Partlow State School and Hospital for the mentally retarded will be\nconsidered by the Court in a decree separate from the present one.\n[3] The amici in this case, including the United States of America, the American Orthopsychiatric Association, the\nAmerican Psychological Association, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the American Association on Mental\nDeficiency, have performed exemplary service for which this Court is indeed grateful.\n[4] On March 15, 1972, after the hearing in this case, plaintiffs filed a motion for further relief. This motion served,\namong other things, to renew an earlier motion, filed by plaintiffs on September 1, 1971, and subsequently\ndenied by the Court, to add additional parties. That earlier motion asked that the Court add: \n\"Agnes Baggett, as Treasurer of the State of Alabama; Roy W. Sanders, as Comptroller of the State of Alabama;\nRuben King, as Commissioner of the Alabama Department of Pensions and Security, George C. Wallace as\nChairman of the Alabama State Board of Pensions and Security, and James J. Bailey as a member of the\nAlabama State Board of Pensions and Security and as representative of all other members of the Alabama State\nBoard of Pensions and Security; J. Stanley Frazer, as Director of the Alabama State Personnel Board and Ralph\nW. Adams, as a member of the Alabama State Personnel Board and as representative of all other members of\nthe Alabama State Personnel Board.\"\nThe motion of September 1, 1971, also sought an injunction against the treasurer and the comptroller of the State\npaying out State funds for \"non-essential functions\" of the State until enough funds were available to provide\nadequately for the financial needs of the Alabama State Mental Health Board.\nIn their motion of March 15, 1972, plaintiffs asked that, in addition to the above-named State officials and\nagencies, the Court add as parties to this litigation Dr. LeRoy Brown, State Superintendent of Education and Lt.\nGovernor Jere Beasley, State Senator Pierre Pelham and State Representative Sage Lyons, as representatives\nof the Alabama Legislature. The motion of March 15, 1972, also requested the Court to appoint a master, to\nappoint a human rights committee and a professional advisory committee, to order the sale of defendant Mental\nHealth Board's land holdings and other assets to raise funds for the operation of Alabama's mental health\ninstitutions, to enjoin the construction of any physical facilities by the Mental Health Board and to enjoin the\ncommitment of any more patients to Bryce and Searcy until such time as adequate treatment is supplied in those\nhospitals.\n[5] In addition to the standards detailed in this order, it is appropriate that defendants comply also with the\nconditions, applicable to mental health institutions, necessary to qualify Alabama's facilities for participation in the\nvarious programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, funded by the United States Government. Because many of\nthese conditions of participation have not yet been finally drafted and published, however, this Court will not at\nthis time order that specific Government standards be implemented.\n[6] The Court's decision to reserve its ruling on the appointment of a master necessitates the reservation also of\nthe Court's appointing a professional advisory committee to aid the master. Nevertheless, the Court notes that\nthe professional mental health community in the United States has responded with enthusiasm to the proposed\ninitiation of such a committee to assist in the upgrading of Alabama's mental health facilities. Consequently, this\nCourt strongly recommends to defendants that they develop a professional advisory committee comprised of\n\namenable professionals from throughout the country who are able to provide the expertise the evidence reflects\nis important to the successful implementation of this order.\n[7] See n. 4, supra. The evidence presented in this case reflects that the land holdings and other assets of the\ndefendant Board are extensive.\n[8] The Court understands and appreciates that the Legislature is not due back in regular session until May,\n1973. Nevertheless, special sessions of the Legislature are frequent occurrences in Alabama, and there has\nnever been a time when such a session was more urgently required. If the Legislature does not act promptly to\nappropriate the necessary funding for mental health, the Court will be compelled to grant plaintiffs' motion to add\nvarious State officials and agencies as additional parties to this litigation, and to utilize other avenues of fund\nraising.\n[1] Approximately 50 patients at Bryce-Searcy are tubercular as also are approximately four residents at Partlon.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

THOMPSON, Chief Judge.\nIn 1972, as a result of a class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of patients involuntarily committed to the custody\nand care of the Alabama Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation, this court ordered departmental\nofficials to comply with certain minimal constitutional standards in the provision of care to the mentally ill. See \nWyatt v. Stickney, 344 F.Supp. 373 (M.D.Ala.1972),aff'd in part,503 F.2d 1305 (5th Cir.1974). Although this\nlitigation has undergone numerous developments since that time, these \"Wyatt standards\" for the mentally ill\nhave remained largely unchanged since their adoption. Last year, the parties sought court approval of two\nconsent decrees that proposed to modify several of the Wyatt standards. At that time, primarily because of the\napparent lack of support for the consent decrees among the state's mental health consumers and their\nadvocates, the court required the parties \"to clarify or change the decrees where necessary and to submit\nadditional evidence in support of the decrees.\" Wyatt v. King, 793 F.Supp. 1053, 1057 (M.D.Ala.1991). The\nparties, with the support of numerous mental health organizations, have now submitted three new consent\n1061 decrees for the court's approval. For the reasons that follow, the court will approve *1061 the entry of these new\n[1]\nconsent decrees.\n\nI.\nIt is well established that parties who seek to resolve a class action through settlement must first convince the\ncourt that the proposed settlement agreement constitutes a \"fair, adequate and reasonable\" resolution of the\n[2] [3]\ndispute. Holmes v. Continental Can Co., 706 F.2d 1144, 1147 (11th Cir.1983); see also Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e)\n(requiring judicial approval of any settlement negotiated in class action). Although the court will accord some\ndeference to the opinion of class counsel, the court retains an independent obligation to ensure that counsel is\nacting in the best interest and with the support of his or her class. Pettway v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co., 576\nF.2d 1157, 1217-18 (5th Cir. 1978),cert. denied,439 U.S. 1115, 99 S.Ct. 1020, 59 L.Ed.2d 74 (1979); Paradise v.\nWells, 686 F.Supp. 1442, 1444 (M.D.Ala. 1988).\nWhen parties to a consent decree subsequently propose to amend that decree, the trial court similarly must\nexamine evidence submitted by the parties to determine whether the proposed modification is justified. It is the\ncourt's responsibility to \"discern the underlying purpose of the decree and decide whether modification would be\nconsistent with that purpose.\" Hodge v. Dept. of Housing & Urban Dev't., 862 F.2d 859, 864 (11th Cir.1989) (per\ncuriam); see also Heath v. DeCourcy, 888 F.2d 1105, 1110 (6th Cir.1989) (in institutional reform litigation, court\nconsiders whether parties have identified \"defect or deficiency\" in district court's original decree which impedes\nachieving decree's goals). Again, the fact that class counsel supports the proposed modifications is an important\nfactor in the court's inquiry but is not the only relevant consideration; the court must still undertake an\nindependent evaluation of the evidence submitted before lending the authority of the federal court to the\nagreement fashioned by the parties.\nIn this case, in January 1991, counsel for the plaintiff class and counsel for the defendants first jointly petitioned\nthe court for approval of modifications to the existing Wyatt standards. The 35 standards address a broad\nspectrum of conditions and requirements, governing virtually every area of patient life within the state's mental\nhealth institutions, from showers to psychiatrist staffing ratios, from \"electro-convulsive treatment\" to therapeutic\nlabor. Through two consent decrees, the parties proposed to amend ten of these 35 standards, including those\ngoverning the administration of electro-convulsive treatment and the use of \"seclusion and physical restraint.\"\nAt that time, the court examined the decrees, reviewed the arguments presented by counsel in support of their\nadoption, and encouraged interested parties to present the court with their views on the proposed changes. As a\nresult of this process, it became clear to the court that counsel for the plaintiff class had failed to take sufficient\nsteps 00 or, it appeared, any steps whatsoever 00 to solicit comments from class members and their advocacy\n97 97\norganizations during the development of the decrees. At the fairness hearing, counsel were unable to present any\nevidence that would indicate the support of class members for these revisions. On the contrary, the court heard\nfrom numerous mental health consumers and their advocacy organizations who expressed strong criticisms of\nthe proposed modifications. In addition, the court had its own questions about the application of the proposed\n1062 decrees and the impact on current practices at state facilities. *1062 Because counsel had failed to present\nsufficient evidence to establish that the modifications were necessary to remedy a deficiency in the standards as\nthey existed or that the proposed changes would be in the \"best interest\" of the class, the court refused to\napprove these decrees. Hodge, 862 F.2d at 861-64. The court directed counsel for plaintiffs and defendants to\ngather additional evidence in support of the decrees and to clarify or change the decrees as necessary to obtain\n[4]\nwider support from the class members and their representatives. 793 F.Supp. at 1057.\nThe three new consent decrees currently before the court differ in many respects from those submitted to the\ncourt previously; most importantly, these decrees, unlike the earlier versions, now appear to have the support of a\nlarge segment of the mental health community. This is primarily due to the efforts of counsel for the plaintiff class\n[5]\nand counsel for defendants to involve the state's primary and secondary consumers,  consumer organizations,\nand advocacy groups 00 including counsel for the plaintiff-intervenors in this case 00 in the revision of the decrees.\n97 97\n[6]\n Counsel for the parties circulated copies of the proposed decrees to these various groups and individuals for\ntheir inspection and comment, and encouraged them to submit written comments or affidavits to the court and to\nmake their views known at the fairness hearing. Throughout the weeks preceding the fairness hearing on the\n\nthree new decrees, the court continued to receive revisions as counsel for the parties sought to respond to\ncomments and criticisms they received.\nThe willingness of counsel for the parties to address the concerns of their critics has had two very positive\nresults: first, the decrees now before the court have the support of the state's major mental health advocacy\norganizations; and, second, upon reviewing the decrees, the court finds that they are much improved\n[7]\nsubstantively as a result of the numerous revisions.  The court is confident that enactment of these proposed\nmodifications will improve the standard of care for patients committed to the state's mental health facilities and\nthus better promote the underlying purpose of the original Wyatt order. Hodge, 862 F.2d at 864. The following\nsection offers a general discussion of the existing standards and the more salient modifications advanced in the\n[8]\nthree proposed consent decrees.\nII.\nA. The First Consent Decree\n(Standards 21, 23, 26-29, 31, and 33)\n1063 The first of the proposed consent decrees would alter Wyatt standards 21, 23, 26-29, *1063 31, 33, and the\ndefinitional section of the standards. These revisions address two of the three issues identified by the original \nWyatt court as areas of \"fundamental\" concern: \"qualified staff in numbers sufficient to administer adequate\ntreatment,\" and the \"individualized treatment plans.\" 344 F.Supp. at 375. In addition, the decrees change some of\nthe terminology used in the standards to account for the new facilities that have been created since 1972.\ni. Clarification of definitions\nIn 1972, when the court promulgated the original Wyatt standards, Bryce and Searcy Hospitals housed the State\nof Alabama's involuntarily-committed mentally ill patients. Accordingly, the court applied the minimum treatment\nstandards for such patients to \"hospitals.\" See Wyatt, 344 F.Supp. at 379-386 (standards 18(A), 19(F) & (G), &\n24). Since 1972, however, the state has established additional mental health institutions, some of which, such as\nthe Eufaula Adolescent Center and the Thomasville Adult Adjustment Center, are not designated as hospitals.\nThe parties therefore have proposed amending the Wyatt standards to make clear that the standards for\ntreatment of people with mental illness apply not only to \"hospitals\" but to all state-operated \"facilities.\" The list of\ninstitutions specifically identified as hospitals is also updated to include North Alabama Regional Hospital and\nGreil Memorial Hospital. Finally, the proposed decree would specify that any reference to \"patients\" includes not\nonly hospital patients but all those individuals involuntarily committed to any state facility.\nii. \"Qualified mental health professionals\" or \"QMHP's\"\nOne of the central concerns animating the court's adoption of the original Wyatt standards was the lack of\nadequate qualifications among the departmental employees involved in the care of patients committed to the\nstate's mental health institutions. See Wyatt v. Stickney, 325 F.Supp. 781, 783 (M.D.Ala.1971). Accordingly, in its\n1972 order, the court obligated state officials to provide mental health treatment to these residents through\nproperly trained and experienced staff. In particular, the court created four categories of \"qualified mental health\n[9]\nprofessionals\" or \"QMHP's,\" authorized by the Wyatt standards to plan and administer treatment.\nIn earlier proposals, the plaintiffs and defendants sought to expand the definition of QMHP's substantially, to\ninclude a wider range of social workers, nurses, and doctors. In response to strenuous objections from consumer\nadvocacy groups, the parties have limited the expansion to the addition of two categories of \"psychological\nassociates.\" These psychological associates would be psychologists with master's degrees and two years of\nclinical experience under the supervision of a doctoral level clinical psychologist who fall in one of the two\nfollowing groups: (1) those with master's degrees from accredited clinical programs providing specialized training\n\nin abnormal behavior, and (2) those with degrees in another area of psychology, but who have received training\nin abnormal behavior and are employed in one of the covered state institutions on the date the decree takes\neffect. Plaintiffs' counsel has indicated that this expansion will have limited impact on patient care, as master's\nlevel psychologists already perform many of the tasks of a QMHP at state facilities. Their explicit inclusion as\nQMHP's will permit them, when appropriate, to approve formally treatment plans and to approve certain orders in\nthe plans regarding visitation, mail and telephone communication, wearing personal clothing and keeping and\nusing personal items.\n1064 *1064 The revised standards also change the terminology used to refer to staff who are not QMHP's as \"non-\nQMHP\" staff instead of \"non-professional\" staff.\niii. Licensing and certification requirements for QMHP's\nThe existing standard 21 mandates that both QMHP's and non-QMHP's in each field shall meet all licensing and\ncertification requirements promulgated by the state for their profession or specialty. The proposed decree would\namend this standard to clarify the QMHP status of certain social workers and to permit certain psychiatrists who\nare awaiting full licensure to serve as QMHP's for a period of one year. The decree would also revise standard\n23, which requires that each non-QMHP be supervised by a QMHP, to specify that the supervisor must be a\nQMHP \"appropriate to the work assignment and professional discipline\" of the non-QMHP staff member.\niv. Individualized treatment plans\nThe first consent decree proposes several changes in the existing standards governing the development,\nimplementation, supervision and review of patient treatment plans by mental health staff. Structurally, the\nmodifications would consolidate existing standards 26 through 29 and 33 into a single standard. Substantively,\nthe revisions incorporate recommendations made by consumers and advocates to ensure that patients\nunderstand their treatment goals and that these goals relate to the criteria for discharge.\n(a) Development of the individualized treatment plan\nStandard 26 of the court's 1972 order required that an individual treatment plan for each patient be developed by\n\"appropriate Qualified Mental Health Professionals, including a psychiatrist.\" Wyatt, 344 F.Supp. at 384. The\nrevised standard clarifies that treatment plans must be developed by \"an assigned Treatment Team,\" and that\nteams within hospitals must be headed by a psychiatrist and those in geriatric programs and in the Thomasville\nAdjustment Center and the Eufaula Adolescent Center by \"an appropriate QMHP.\" The existing standard 33\nallows 15 days for the creation of an individualized treatment plan. As revised, the standard now requires that a\nmember of the treatment team examine the patient and develop an interim treatment plan within 72 hours of\nadmission. The treatment team would have ten days to develop and implement a fully individualized plan.\nThe revised standard also adds to the elements which must be included in each patient's individualized treatment\nplan. In addition to the information already required, the treatment plan must include: \"a statement of the patient's\nstrengths including skills and interests,\" \"an assessment by medical staff of any restrictions or limitations on\nphysical activity,\" and intermediate and long-range treatment goals. Criteria for release to less restrictive\ntreatment conditions and criteria for discharge must be \"specific and measurable,\" must be \"written in\nnontechnical language,\" and must be \"explained to the patient in a manner appropriate to the patient's capacity to\nunderstand.\" The intermediate and long-term treatment goals must be clearly stated and \"must relate to\ninvoluntary commitment criteria\"; similarly, criteria for release must \"relate to involuntary commitment standards.\"\nAs part of the treatment plan, the treatment team must also develop an individualized discharge plan that\nidentifies the different services the patient will require upon discharge.\n\n(b) Supervision of treatment\nThe revised standard specifies that, once a plan has been developed that includes all of these elements, a\nQMHP and a psychiatrist must bear responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the treatment plan,\nintegrating the various components, reviewing the plan regularly, and recording the patient's progress. As before,\nthe QMHP bears responsibility for ensuring that the patient is released to a less restrictive form of treatment\n1065 when appropriate; in addition, however, the revised standard requires the QMHP to see *1065 that, upon\ndischarge, the patient receives the appropriate transitional services.\n(c) Progress summaries\nThe parties have also agreed to alter the requirements concerning the entry of progress summaries and the\nreview of treatment plans. For most patients, the revision does not affect the current standard's requirement of\nweekly progress summaries by a QMHP but simply recasts this requirement as a \"minimum\" and instructs the\nQMHP to update the report more frequently as necessary, that is, \"on a regular and periodic basis ... as dictated\nby good clinical judgment.\" For patients in long-term treatment programs and geriatric patients, the standards\nwould instead require only monthly progress summaries. Added is a requirement that progress summaries\ninclude a \"medication review\" that monitors the efficacy of any prescribed medication and the presence of\nunintended side effects.\n(d) Review and modification of treatment plans\nThe revised standard seeks to regularize the review of treatment plans to ensure that appropriate modifications\nmay be made in a timely fashion. Currently, standard 29 requires \"continuous\" review, and modifications \"if\nnecessary,\" but offers no precise guidance beyond the requirement that a review be conducted at least every 90\ndays. The revised standard specifies that a patient's treatment plan is to be reviewed \"at major key decision\npoints in the patient's treatment, including: at the time of admission, transfer, and discharge; when there is a\nmajor change in the patient's condition; at the point of estimated length of treatment and thereafter based on that\nestimated length of treatment;\" and, at a minimum, every 90 days. Modifications are to be made by the treatment\nteams \"as the need becomes evident through regular and periodic reviews.\" Because the new standards provide\nfor a treatment team, rather than an individual QMHP, to develop and implement the treatment plan, the\nrequirements that a patient periodically receive a mental examination from a QMHP other than the professional\nresponsible for his or her care, and that a non-attending QMHP review the treatment plan, have both been\neliminated.\n(e) Quality assurance and utilization review\nTo ensure that the theoretical benefits of the improved standards are realized in practice, the parties have\nfashioned a new standard requiring each mental health facility to maintain a \"quality assurance program,\" to\nguarantee that treatment plans are reviewed in accordance with accreditation standards, and a \"utilization review\nprogram,\" to screen patients to determine whether they have been appropriately admitted and to reexamine\nperiodically each patient's need for continued inpatient treatment. The latter provision would replace an existing\nstandard that requires the superintendent of a hospital to examine a patient and decide whether the patient\nrequires hospitalization within 15 days of the patient's admission. In its stead, the revised standard mandates that\nthe need for continued inpatient treatment be determined according to a schedule based on the average length of\nstay for the unit or program in which the patient is being treated. If the data for the patient's individual unit or\n[10]\nprogram are not \"readily available,\" the staff may use instead length of stay data for the entire facility.  As part\nof the admissions screen and the continued stay reviews, the facility must document the specific basis supporting\nits determination that a patient requires admission or continued institutional care.\n\nThe revised standard takes the important step of clarifying the facility's obligation to terminate the involuntary\n1066 commitment of *1066 patients who do not meet commitment standards. If, as a result of the admissions screen or\na continued stay review, the facility determines that the patient does not meet the standards for involuntary\ncommitment, \"the patient must be released immediately unless he or she agrees to continue on as a voluntary\npatient.\" The revised standard similarly requires that if, at any point during a patient's stay, the facility director or\nthe director's appointed representative determines that the patient no longer meets the criteria for involuntary\ncommitment, the patient must be discharged immediately, unless he or she decides to stay on as a voluntary\npatient, and must be provided with the appropriate transitional services.\nv. Patient records\nThe parties propose to modify standard 31, which concerns patient records, to emphasize the importance of the\nconfidentiality of patient records and to clarify that this must be protected \"through strict adherence to applicable\nstatutes and rules.\" The revised decree would also modify the current requirement that all individuals seeking\naccess to a patient's record must first obtain written authorization from the patient or the patient's guardian. The\nrevised standard identifies a limited number of individuals, including the patient's attorney, authorized Department\nemployees, and, to the extent legally authorized, the Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program, who need not\nobtain a formal written consent in order to examine a patient's records. The standard also affirms that a patient\nmust have access to his or her own records.\nIn response to comments and recommendations submitted by consumers, the new standard adds the\nrequirement that any complaint about a patient that is recorded in the patient's record be discussed with the\npatient, and that the patient's response be documented along with the complaint. The requirement that complete\npatient records be kept on the patient's ward has been deleted.\nB. The Second Consent Decree: Seclusion and Restraint\n(Standard 7)\nAmong the most rigorous procedural protections adopted by the court in its 1972 order were those designed to\nprotect the rights of mental health patients against the unfettered use of such extraordinary measures as electro-\nconvulsive treatment, and isolation (or seclusion) and physical restraint. The second consent decree proposes\nseveral changes in the procedures governing physical restraint and seclusion designed to increase the\n[11]\nprotections for patients and to reflect current professional standards.  Revisions to the standards governing\nuse of electro-convulsive treatment are addressed in the third decree.\nThe original Wyatt standard authorized the use of seclusion or restraint in both emergency and non-emergency\nsituations but established different standards applicable to the two situations. In the absence of any emergency,\nthe original standards permit a patient to be physically restrained or isolated on the written order of a QMHP who\nhas \"personally seen the patient concerned and evaluated whatever episode or situation is said to call for\nrestraint or isolation.\" Such an order could remain in effect for a maximum of 24 hours, after which time it would\n[12]\nneed to be \"renewed\" if physical restraint and isolation were to be continued.  In an emergency, defined as a\n1067 situation in which \"it is likely that *1067 patients could harm themselves or others,\" an order for restraint or\nisolation could be approved by any staff member for a period of up to one hour if the staff member found that\n\"less restrictive means of restraint are not feasible.\" An emergency order for restraint or isolation could not extend\nbeyond this initial one hour period unless a QMHP was consulted and entered an appropriate order in writing. \n344 F.Supp. at 380.\nUnlike the current standard, the revised standard makes clear that a patient may be physically restrained \"only ...\nto prevent [the] patient from physically injuring himself/herself or others\"; even nonemergency use of restraint or\nseclusion is governed by this requirement. It emphasizes that \"[s]eclusion and restraint shall not be used as\npunishment or for the convenience of staff or in a manner that causes undue physical discomfort, harm or pain to\n\nthe patient.\" The revised standard substantially limits the number of staff members authorized to order non-\nemergency seclusion or restraint: only a \"qualified physician,\" defined as a psychiatrist or a licensed physician\nwith specialized training, possesses this authority. The physician must be physically present and must perform an\nexamination of the patient prior to issuing the order. Previously, the standard permitted a patient to be kept in\nseclusion or restraint for up to 24 hours on the basis of the initial order; the revised standard shortens this time to\na maximum of eight hours. The new standard would also require that the patient be monitored every 15 minutes,\nas opposed to every hour under the present standard, and be bathed at least every 24 hours, rather than every\n12 as is presently the rule. In response to the recommendations of advocacy groups, the standard also specifies\nthat the staff member monitoring the patient shall be made aware of any special medical concerns regarding the\npatient so that these may be taken into account.\nLike the 1972 order, the proposed decree recognizes an exception to the ordinary requirements when the use of\nisolation and physical restraint is required in \"emergency situations.\" As with non-emergency orders, however, the\nprocedural safeguards governing emergency restraint and seclusion are much improved. The existing standard\ndoes not require the involvement of medical personnel in implementing emergency seclusion and restraint, and\npermits the extension of emergency orders for up to 24 hours at a time as long as a QMHP is \"consulted\" within\nthe first hour of the emergency episode and approves an extension of the order. This standard has been rewritten\nto ensure that even in \"emergency\" situations the use of seclusion and restraint is carefully controlled. As revised,\nthe standard permits \"a trained, clinically privileged, qualified registered nurse\" to approve a seclusion or restraint\norder \"in emergency situations when no qualified physician is available,\" but only if alternative treatment\ninterventions \"have been unsuccessful or would not prevent injury\" and the use of seclusion or restraint is\n[13]\nnecessary \"to prevent a patient from physically injuring himself/herself or others.\"  Before approving an order\nfor seclusion or restraint, the nurse must be physically present and must evaluate the patient's condition \"to the\nextent ... feasible\"; this evaluation is to be documented in the patient's record. If all the preceding requirements\nare met, the nurse may order the use of seclusion or restraint for a period of up to one hour. The revised standard\nrequires that a qualified physician be notified as soon as possible after the emergency episode begins, and that\nsuch a physician must see the patient in person within four hours 00 preferably, within one hour.\n97\n1068 *1068 A qualified doctor may verbally order that the emergency one-hour episode of seclusion or restraint be\nextended for up to four hours (three hours beyond the nurse's original order) if the doctor finds that this action is\nnecessary to prevent physical injury to the patient. No emergency episode may last longer than four hours; after\nthat time, any additional seclusion order must comply with the standard governing nonemergency use of\nseclusion and restraint. All written orders for seclusion and restraint, including emergency orders, must include a\nclinical assessment of the patient, the alternative treatment interventions attempted, and criteria for the release of\nthe patient that relate to the original reasons for the intervention.\nFinally, the revised standard adds requirements regarding the management of patients in seclusion and restraint.\nIt mandates that patients be provided \"fluids\" as well as meals on a regular basis; that patients' vital signs must\nbe taken \"as clinically indicated\"; and that patients in restraint must \"be released for range of motion exercises as\nclinically indicated.\"\nC. The Third Consent Decree: Electro-Convulsive Treatment or \"ECT\"\n(Standard 9(3))\nAs initially established in 1972, the Wyatt standards required only that a patient have given \"express and\ninformed consent\" before any administration of electro-convulsive treatment or \"ECT\". Wyatt, 344 F.Supp. at 380.\nIn 1980, however, the court instituted a fairly elaborate procedural mechanism for approving and administering\n[14]\nthe treatment.  This new procedure required that a QMHP trained and experienced in ECT use recommend\nthe treatment in writing; that the recommendation be concurred in by another QMHP trained and experienced in\nits use and approved by the superintendent or medical director of the hospital and by the \"Extraordinary\nTreatment Committee,\" a five-member court-appointed body; and that the patient give written, informed consent.\nThe procedure placed a number of significant responsibilities on the Extraordinary Treatment Committee,\n\nincluding that it certify that the patient's consent was actually \"knowing, intelligent, and voluntary\", ascertain that\nthe proposed treatment constituted the \"least drastic alternative available\", \"give great weight to any expression\nby the patient of a desire not to be subjected to ECT\", and resolve \"[a]ny doubts that ECT is in the best interest of\nthe incompetent patient ... against proceeding with such treatment.\" Finally, the court required that each patient\nbe represented throughout these proceedings by an independent attorney.\nIn the case of a patient incompetent to give informed consent, the 1980 order mandates alternative procedures\nfor obtaining approval of ECT. If such an individual is deemed incompetent by either his or her attorney, treating\npsychiatrist, or the Extraordinary Treatment Committee, the Committee may consent to such treatment on the\npatient's behalf if, after a comprehensive evaluation of the patient and his or her records, and taking account of\nthe wishes of the patient, the patient's family members, and the hospital staff, it finds that the treatment would be\nin the patient's best interest. Either the patient or a family member may seek court review of such a decision\nbefore ECT is begun.\nOnce such treatment has been approved, the 1980 order also constrains how it may be administered. First,\nwithin ten days prior to the beginning of each series of ECT, the patient must receive a complete physical and\nneurological examination. Second, such treatment may only be administered by a QMHP psychiatrist, trained and\nexperienced in the use of ECT, or by \"qualified personnel\" under the \"direct supervision and in the physical\n1069 presence\" of such trained psychiatrist. Third and finally, a competent patient is entitled to withdraw *1069 his or\nher consent to such treatment at any time and for any reason.\nIn the proposed consent decrees submitted to the court last year, which the court refused to approve, the parties\nsought to make substantial modifications in the procedures for ECT. In particular, the proposed decrees placed\nthe entire process under independent judicial supervision by eliminating the Extraordinary Treatment Committee\nand transferring to state courts the responsibility for determining a patient's competency to consent to treatment\nand approving the administration of ECT. Furthermore, because counsel for the parties assumed that state courts\nwould continue to appoint counsel in cases such as these, the proposed decrees eliminated the Department's\nobligation to provide each patient with an independent attorney. In addition, among other things, the decrees\nrequired that a consulting psychiatrist, not affiliated with either the Department or the treating psychiatrist,\nexamine the patient and concur in the recommendation for ECT, and the decrees recognized a new category of\n\"emergency\" ECT for situations in which the delay inherent in ordinary procedures could be expected to\njeopardize the patient's life or cause the patient serious physical harm.\nAlthough the parties' counsel believed the proposed modifications on the whole strengthened the protections\nprovided to patients, some consumers and advocacy groups voiced a number of concerns, in particular about the\nelimination of the Extraordinary Treatment Committee. In response to these concerns, the parties have proposed\na new decree which, like the earlier proposals, still strengthens the protections provided to patients, but does so\nthrough less radical revisions to the procedures governing ECT.\nThe proposed decree preserves the Extraordinary Treatment Committee but provides that it shall be\n[15]\n\"reconstituted\" by the court to ensure that consumers or expatients are represented as committee members.\nAlthough the above-listed substantial responsibilities of the Committee are conspicuously absent, these concerns\nhave not been overlooked: the decree provides that the court is to \"prescribe rules of the Committee's\nfunctioning.\" The decree further limits those who may prescribe ECT to \"a psychiatrist ... who has training\nregarding the appropriate use of ECT, has conducted a thorough mental and physical examination of the patient,\nand reviewed the medical records available.\" The revised standard also spells out more clearly the information\nthat must be provided a patient before the patient's informed consent may be obtained. This provision reflects the\nconcerns expressed by some class members that, in the past, patients may have consented to ECT without fully\nunderstanding the potential side effects. The protections established by the court in 1980 for non-emergency\nECT should be, depending upon the oversight duties ultimately assigned to the reconstituted Extraordinary\nTreatment Committee, somewhat strengthened with the implementation of the decree.\nThe revised standard provides for the administration of ECT to a patient who is not competent to consent to\ntreatment and for whom no guardian has been appointed, in certain \"emergency\" situations. In the absence of a\nconsent obtained according to the standard described above, ECT may be administered only when the treating\n\npsychiatrist has documented, and the Extraordinary Treatment Committee confirmed, that the following\nconditions are met: (1) the patient's condition has deteriorated; (2) the patient has failed to respond to alternative\nforms of treatment; and (3) a delay in treatment \"could reasonably be expected to jeopardize the life of the patient\nor to result in serious physical harm to the patient.\" Before invoking this emergency provision, the treating\n1070 psychiatrist must first notify the Department's Internal Rights Advocacy and Protection Program *1070 and must\ndiligently petition the state court to appoint a guardian or provide judicial authorization for the treatment. Only if\n[16]\nthe psychiatrist is unable to secure a decision from the state court may the \"emergency\" treatment proceed.\nFinally, the revised standard directs the Internal Rights Advocacy and Protection Program to conduct an annual\nreview of all administrations of ECT, both emergency and nonemergency.\nThe court recognizes that not all class members are happy with the revised standard. Although the use of ECT\nhas gained increased acceptance in the medical community since the court first established procedures\ngoverning its use in 1972, it continues to generate controversy among members of the mental health community.\nTestimony submitted to the court confirms that, other than seclusion and restraint, ECT is the treatment modality\nof greatest concern to consumers. The court heard from a number of consumers and advocates who object to\nany use of \"emergency\" ECT on patients unable to give voluntary consent. These critics assert that ECT is a very\ninvasive form of therapy which carries serious side effects, most notably memory loss, even when appropriately\nused. In light of these risks, critics of the \"emergency\" use provision would have preferred that the standard be\nmodified to prohibit such use altogether. And although the focus of most objections centered upon \"emergency\"\nuse of the treatment, critics have also sought increased assurance that the treatment will be used only as therapy\nof last resort, and that patients who consent to treatment will be provided with full information about the treatment\nand its risks.\nFor the most part, however, even critics of ECT agreed with the court that the revised standard represents an\n[17]\nimprovement over the existing Wyatt standard.  The decree retains existing patient safeguards, such as the\nappointed attorney and the Extraordinary Treatment Committee, and establishes some additional protections.\nThe exception for \"emergency\" treatment is narrowly defined and should not result in any increased use of the\ntherapy. Finally, the court notes that this standard has been modified in the past and, if necessary, may be\nrevised again in the future, as medical knowledge about the risks and benefits of ECT indicates that further\nrevision would better protect the interests of the state's mental health patients.\nAccordingly, for the above reasons, it is the ORDER, JUDGMENT, and DECREE of the court that the joint\nrequest for entry of consent decrees filed by plaintiffs and defendants on January 10, 1991, be and it is hereby\ngranted to the extent that the three new proposed consent decrees, submitted to the court on October 15, 1991,\nand later revised, are approved and entered this date.\nCONSENT ORDER I\nThe plaintiffs and defendants have agreed that certain definitions and standards contained in the Court's prior\norders regarding the care and treatment of persons with mental illness should be modified to both enhance the\ntreatment of class members and better protect their rights. They have asked the Court to approve these\n1071 modifications. For the reasons set forth in the Memorandum Opinion entered *1071 this date, the modifications\nwill be approved.\nAccordingly, it is ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the definitions section of the Wyatt standards\nconcerning the care and treatment of persons with mental illness and Standards 21, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, and\n33 concerning the care and treatment of persons with mental illness be and are hereby AMENDED as set out in\nthe Appendix to this order.\nAPPENDIX TO CONSENT ORDER I OF MAY 14, 1992\n\nModifications of Standards Governing Care and Treatment of Class\nMembers with Mental Illness\nDefinitions\na. \"Facility\" 00 One of the inpatient institutions for persons who are mentally ill operated by the Department of\n97\nMental Health/Mental Retardation, including hospitals, the Thomasville Adult Adjustment Center, and the Eufaula\nAdolescent Center.\nb. \"Hospital\" 00 Bryce Hospital, Searcy Hospital, North Alabama Regional Hospital, and Greil Memorial Hospital,\n97\nand any other state hospital operated by the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation in which class\n[1]\nmembers reside.\nc. \"Patients\" 00 All persons who are now confined and all persons who may in the future be confined to any facility\n97\noperated by the Alabama State Department of Mental Health/Mental Retardation pursuant to an involuntary civil\ncommitment procedure.\nd. \"Qualified Mental Health Professional\" 00\n97\n(1) a psychiatrist with three years of residency training in psychiatry;\n(2) a psychologist with a doctoral degree from an accredited clinical psychology program; or a\npsychologist with a doctoral degree from another accredited applied psychology program (e.g.\ncounseling) who is licensed to practice within the state and who has one year of clinical\nexperience under the supervision of a QMHP clinical psychologist;\n(3) a psychological assistant (i) with a master's degree in psychology from an accredited clinical\nprogram offering specialized training in abnormal behavior and with two years of clinical\nexperience under the supervision of a doctoral level clinical psychologist and (ii) who practices\nunder the supervision of a doctoral level clinical psychologist;\n(4) a psychological assistant with a master's degree in psychology who (i) has training in abnormal\nbehavior, (ii) has two years of clinical experience under the supervision of a doctoral level clinical\npsychologist, (iii) is employed in a facility on the date of the Consent Order adopting this Appendix,\n[2]\nand (iv) who practices under the supervision of a doctoral level clinical psychologist;\n(5) a social worker with a doctorate or master's degree from an accredited program and two years\nof clinical experience under the supervision of a QMHP;\n(6) a registered nurse with a graduate degree in psychiatric nursing and two years of clinical\nexperience under the supervision of a QMHP; and\ne. \"Non-QMHP Staff Member\" 00 An employee of a facility, other than a QMHP, whose duties require direct\n97\ncontact with or supervision of patients.\nStandard 21\n1072 (21) Each Qualified Mental Health Professional shall meet all licensing and certification *1072 requirements\npromulgated by the State of Alabama, if any, for persons engaged in private practice of the same profession\n[3]\nelsewhere in Alabama.

A summary of the extent and nature of the patient's work activity\nshall also be included, if applicable. The frequency and regularity with which the patient's progress is noted\nshould be dictated by good clinical judgment. Factors affecting the exercise of such judgment should include\nchanges in the patient's condition and/or the need to document observations that affect treatment planning. At a\nminimum, progress summaries shall be recorded as follows:\n[4]\n(1) Weekly summaries for patients in short-term treatment programs (programs of up to 180 days)  and in\n[5]\nadolescent treatment programs;\n[6]\n(2) Monthly summaries for patients in long-term treatment programs (programs of more than 180 days);\n(3) Monthly summaries for geriatric patients.\nD.

Quality Assurance/Utilization Review.\nEach facility shall have a Quality Assurance Program that provides for all treatment plans to be reviewed in\naccordance with JCAHO standards and a Utilization Review Program that requires that all patients be screened\nfor appropriateness of admission to the facility according to specific criteria, including whether the patient meets\nthe standards for commitment. The Utilization Review program shall also require that the facility review a patient's\nneed for continued inpatient treatment according to a schedule based on the average length of stay for the unit or\n1074 program in which the patient is being treated.[7] The *1074 need for continued inpatient treatment shall be judged\nagainst specific criteria, including whether the patient continues to meet the standards for commitment. As part of\nthe screen for appropriateness of admission and as part of the continued stay reviews, the facility shall document\nthe specific basis for a determination that a patient needs to be admitted or continues to need institutional care.\nIf, as a result of the screen for appropriateness of admission or a continued stay review, it is determined that a\npatient does not require inpatient treatment in accordance with the standards for commitment, the patient must\n\nbe released immediately unless he or she agrees to continue treatment on a voluntary basis. In addition, if at any\ntime the director of the facility or his appointed, professionally qualified agent at any time determines that a\npatient does not require inpatient treatment in accordance with the standards for commitment, the patient must\nbe discharged immediately unless he or she agrees to continue treatment on a voluntary basis. Upon discharge,\nthe patient will be linked to an appropriate community mental health center and given access to case\n[8]\nmanagement services unless not clinically indicated.\nStandard 27\nStandard 27 is deleted.\nStandard 28\nStandard 28 is deleted.\nStandard 29\nStandard 29 is deleted.\nStandard 31\n(31) Confidentiality of the patient record shall be protected through strict adherence to applicable statutes and\nrules.

They have asked the Court to approve the modification. For the reasons\nset forth in the Memorandum Opinion entered this date, the modification will be approved.\nAccordingly, it is ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that Standard 9(3) concerning the care and treatment\nof persons with mental illness be and is hereby AMENDED as set out in the Appendix to this order.\nAPPENDIX TO CONSENT ORDER II OF MAY 14, 1992\nModifications of Standard 9(3) Governing Care and Treatment of Class\nMembers with Mental Illness\nStandard 9(3)\nPatients may be administered electro-convulsive treatment (ECT) provided the following conditions are met prior\nto implementing each course of treatment.\nBasic Requirements\n1. The patient is 19 years of age or older.\n2. The treatment is prescribed by a psychiatrist licensed in the State of Alabama who has training regarding the\nappropriate use of ECT, has conducted a thorough mental and physical examination of the patient, and has\nreviewed the medical records available.\n\n3. The Extraordinary Treatment Committee concurs in the recommendation of treatment. The Committee shall be\nreconstituted by the Court, after reviewing recommendations by the plaintiffs and the defendants for the\nCommittee's reconstitution. In reconstituting the Committee, the Court will provide for representation on the\nCommittee of consumers and/or ex-patients. The Court shall also prescribe rules for the Committee's functioning.\n4. The clinical director of the facility has approved the decision to treat with ECT.\n5. The treatment is administered by a psychiatrist who is specially trained in the use of ECT. Unless medically\ncontraindicated, anaesthesia and muscle relaxants are administered by a qualified anaesthetist or\nanesthesiologist or by a physician skilled in this procedure.\n1076 *1076 6. Regressive or depatterning electro-convulsive techniques are not utilized.\n7. Complete, accurate, and contemporaneous records are maintained with respect to each administration of ECT.\n8. Consent has been obtained in accordance with paragraphs # 9-# 12, or the emergency administration of ECT\nis permitted under paragraphs # 13-# 15 below.\nConsent\n[1]\n9. For a competent patient (i.e., a patient who is capable of giving informed consent to ECT):\na. The patient has been fully informed by the treating psychiatrist (in language and in a manner appropriate to the\npatient's condition and capacity to understand) of the nature, risks and consequences of ECT, including the\npossibility of memory loss; of the patient's right to revoke his consent at any time, including during the course of\nthe treatment; and of specific means by which the patient may revoke his consent (e.g., by orally informing the\ntreating psychiatrist or other staff, by calling a specific telephone number, by returning a pre-printed form, etc.);\nand\nb. The patient has consented in writing to the treatment.\n10. If the patient has been judicially determined to be incompetent to consent to treatment (e.g., a court has\nappointed for the patient a general guardian or a limited guardian with power to consent to treatment), and the\npatient has not regained competency before or during the proposed course of ECT treatment:\na. The patient has been informed of the nature of the treatment in language and in a manner appropriate to the\npatient's condition and capacity to understand; and\n[2]\nb. Consent has been obtained in writing from the patient's guardian  after the guardian has been informed of\nthe risks and benefits of the treatment, of the legal guardian's right to revoke consent at any time, and of specific\nmeans for revoking consent (e.g., by orally informing the treating psychiatrist or other staff, by calling a specific\ntelephone number, by returning a pre-printed form, etc.).\n11. If the patient has been judicially determined to be incompetent to consent to treatment (e.g., a court has\nappointed for the patient a general guardian or a limited guardian with power to consent to treatment), but the\npatient has regained competency before or during the proposed course of ECT treatment (regardless of whether\nthe patient's guardian has consented to the treatment):\na. The patient has been fully informed by the treating psychiatrist (in language and in a manner appropriate to the\npatient's condition and capacity to understand) of the nature, risks and consequences of ECT, including the\npossibility of memory loss; of the patient's right to revoke his consent at any time, including during the course of\nthe treatment; and of specific means by which the patient may revoke his consent (e.g., by orally informing the\ntreating psychiatrist or other staff, by calling a specific telephone number, by returning a pre-printed form, etc.);\nand\nb. The patient has consented in writing to the treatment.\n\n12. If a patient has not been judicially determined to be incompetent to consent to treatment, but the treating\npsychiatrist believes the patient may not be competent to consent:\na. The treating psychiatrist has caused a formal request (e.g. petition, motion, etc.) to be filed in a court of\n[3]\ncompetent jurisdiction for adjudication of the patient's competence to consent to treatment;  and\n1077  b. Either:\n*1077\n(i) The court has appointed a guardian and the requirements of paragraph # 10 have been met; or\n(ii) The court itself has authorized the treatment and the requirements of paragraph # 10a have been met.\nEmergency Administration\n13. Notwithstanding paragraphs # 9-# 12 above, patients may be administered ECT in an emergency if the\nfollowing conditions have been met:\na. The treating psychiatrist has documented, and the Extraordinary Treatment Committee has found, that: (i) the\npatient is not competent to consent to treatment and is without a guardian; (ii) the patient's condition has\ndeteriorated, (iii) the patient has failed to respond to alternative forms of treatment, (iv) a delay in treatment could\nreasonably be expected to jeopardize the life of the patient or to result in serious physical harm to the patient;\nand\nb. The treating psychiatrist has:\n(i) Notified the Department's Internal Rights Advocacy and Protection Program of his or her decision; and\n(ii) Been unable to secure a decision on the appointment of a guardian or a judicial authorization from a state\ncourt to administer ECT on an emergency basis, despite diligent efforts on his part and the part of legal counsel\n[4]\nfor the Department.\n14. If the treating psychiatrist believes that the patient may require additional ECT treatment in the future, the\nDepartment must make diligent efforts following the emergency treatment to obtain a judicial determination of\nwhether the patient is competent to consent and, if it is determined that the patient is not competent, to obtain the\nappointment of a guardian to consent to treatment or a judicial authorization for future ECT treatments.\nReview by Internal Advocacy Program\n15. The Department's Internal Rights Advocacy and Protection Program shall annually review all administrations\nof ECT (i.e., emergency administrations, administrations to consenting competent patients, and administrations to\nincompetent patients when a guardian or court has given consent).\nCONSENT ORDER III\nThe plaintiffs and the defendants have agreed that Standard 7 contained in the Court's prior orders regarding the\ncare and treatment of persons with mental illness should be modified to both enhance the treatment of class\nmembers and better protect their rights. They have asked the Court to approve the modification. For the reasons\nset forth in the Memorandum Opinion entered this date, the modification will be approved.\nAccordingly, it is ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that Standard 7 concerning the care and treatment of\npersons with mental illness be and is hereby AMENDED as set out in the Appendix to this order.\nAPPENDIX TO CONSENT ORDER III OF MAY 14, 1992\n\nModifications of Standard 7 Governing Care and Treatment of Class\nMembers with Mental Illness\n[1]\nStandard 7\n(7) A. Standard for Seclusion or Restraint. Patients have a right to be free from seclusion and physical restraint.\nPatients may be placed in seclusion or physically restrained only (a) to prevent a patient from physically injuring\nhimself/herself or others, (b) after alternative treatment interventions have been unsuccessful or after determining\n1078 that alternative treatment interventions would not be practicable, and (c) when authorized by a written *1078\n[2]\norder of a qualified physician  who is physically present and has examined the patient. No order for seclusion or\nrestraint may exceed eight hours.\nB. Exceptions. Exceptions to the requirement that seclusion and restraint be implemented only pursuant to a\nwritten order of a qualified physician who is physically present and has examined the patient may be made in\nemergency situations when no qualified physician is available. In such situations, the use of restraint or seclusion\n[3]\nmay be implemented for up to one hour by a trained, clinically privileged, qualified registered nurse  to prevent\na patient from physically injuring himself/herself or others, after determining that alternative treatment\ninterventions have been unsuccessful or would not be practicable. The nurse must be physically present and\nevaluate the patient's physical condition to the extent that it is feasible and document the evaluation in the clinical\nrecord. A qualified physician should be notified as soon as possible after the emergency episode of seclusion or\nrestraint. A qualified physician should see the patient within four hours of the initiation of seclusion or restraint and\npreferably within one hour. The emergency episode of seclusion or restraint may be extended up to four hours\n(i.e. three hours beyond the initial one hour authorized by the qualified registered nurse) upon verbal order of a\nqualified physician if necessary to prevent a patient from physically injuring himself/herself or others and if, in the\nopinion of the qualified physician, alternative treatment interventions would be unsuccessful in preventing injury.\nAfter the emergency episode has extended for four hours, the patient must be released unless a qualified\nphysician writes a new order for seclusion or restraint that meets the criteria in paragraph A(a-c) above. All\nemergency seclusion or restraint orders (including any related documentation) must be reviewed and signed by a\nqualified physician within twelve hours of the initial use of seclusion or restraint.\nC. Orders for Seclusion or Restraint. All written orders for seclusion and restraint (including in emergency\nsituations) shall include a clinical assessment of the patient, the alternative treatment interventions attempted,\nand criteria for the release of the patient which shall relate to the standard for seclusion or restraint in paragraph\nA above. When the criteria for release have been met or at the end of the period set out in the order (whichever\n1079 occurs first), the patient must be released unless the patient is then examined by a *1079 qualified physician who\nwrites a new order for seclusion or restraint.\nD. Management of Patients in Seclusion or Restraint. A documented observation shall be made of a patient in\nrestraint or seclusion at least every fifteen minutes. The person making the observation shall be made aware of\nand shall take account of any special medical concerns regarding the patient. The patient must be given\nbathroom privileges at least every hour, must be bathed at least every twenty-four hours or more frequently if\nnecessary, and must be provided meals and fluids on a regular basis. Vital signs shall be taken as clinically\nindicated. Patients in restraint shall be released for range of motion exercises as clinically indicated.\nE. Additional Matters. Seclusion and restraint shall not be used as punishment or for the convenience of staff or\nin a manner that causes undue physical discomfort, harm, or pain to the patient. PRN orders for seclusion and\nrestraint are prohibited.\n[1] With the submission of the three new decrees, the court entered a final order rejecting the two original\ndecrees. Wyatt v. King, civil action no. 3195-N (M.D. Ala. Oct. 28, 1991).\n\n[2] The court also has a duty to ensure that the settlement is not illegal, against public policy, or the product of\nfraud or collusion. Dillard v. Crenshaw County, 748 F.Supp. 819, 823 (M.D.Ala.1990). No one has leveled such a\ncharge against the three new proposed decrees, and the court is unaware of any evidence which would support\nsuch a charge.\n[3] In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981), the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals\nadopted as binding precedent all of the decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to the close of\nbusiness on September 30, 1981.\n[4]See note 1, supra.\n[5] \"Primary\" consumers are mental health patients themselves; \"secondary\" consumers are the families and\nfriends of mental health patients who are affected by the standard of state mental health services.\n[6] The plaintiff-intervenors, who are seeking to represent those members of the Wyatt plaintiff class who are\ninvoluntarily confined at the Thomasville Adult Adjustment Center, have also participated in the settlement\nprocess. Although not directly involved in this phase of the litigation, their counsel are familiar with the\nimplementation of the Wyatt standards at the Thomasville facility and have provided the parties and the court with\nuseful insight into the possible impact of the proposed revisions on patients at that facility. Plaintiff-intervenors'\ncounsel have also assisted by suggesting amendments to the Wyatt standards designed to ensure the timely\nidentification and discharge of patients who no longer meet commitment criteria. See Wyatt v. King, 773 F.Supp.\n1508 (M.D.Ala. 1991).\n[7] In a previous order, the court wrote that it \"understands the difficulties class counsel faces in endeavoring to\nsolicit the views\" of \"his clients 00 who consist only of current patients confined in state mental health facilities.\"\n97\n793 F.Supp. at 1055-56. Counsel for the plaintiff class, Mr. Ira Burnim, is to be strongly commended for the\nsensitive and effective manner in which he has involved many affected and interested persons in the settlement\nproceedings.\n[8] The three decrees now before the court address the same standards that the parties' counsel sought to\nmodify in the original two decrees. The \"addition\" of a third decree results from counsel's decision to submit the\nrevised standard on seclusion and restraint and the revised electroconvulsive treatment standard as two separate\ndecrees.\n[9] Under the existing standard, the following four groups may serve as QMHP's: (1) psychiatrists with three\nyears of residence training in psychiatry; (2) psychologists with doctoral degrees from accredited programs; (3)\nsocial workers with master's degrees from accredited programs and two years of clinical experience under the\nsupervision of a QMHP; and (4) registered nurses with graduate degrees in psychiatric nursing and two years of\nclinical experience under the supervision of a QMHP. See Wyatt, 344 F.Supp. at 379.\n[10] Plaintiff-intervenors repeatedly expressed concern that calculations of the average length of stay for the\nfacility as a whole would bias the length of stay toward longer periods of hospitalization, as the high volume and\nfast turnover of the admissions unit would obscure the actual length of stay on the long-term unit. The current\nproposal seeks to accommodate this concern where such data are available.\n[11] In a footnote, the decree suggests that the plaintiffs and the defendants \"may agree to apply a different\nstandard\" to the Eufaula Adolescent Center. Counsel for the parties have explained to the court that, because this\nfacility is in a state of flux and because its future is thus uncertain, the parties were unable to agree on how the\nprocedures governing restraint and seclusion should be modified to apply to it. The court understands from the\nparties that the Eufaula Adolescent Center will therefore continue to be governed by the existing procedures.\n[12] The existing standard also requires that the patient be seen by \"qualified ward personnel\" who will record the\npatient's physical and, if appropriate, psychological condition at least every hour; that the patient receive\n\"bathroom privileges\" every hour and be bathed every 12 hours; and that the patient be provided meals regularly.\n[13] To meet the training standards, the nurse must be a QMHP registered nurse or a licensed registered nurse\nwho has two years of clinical experience, has completed a basic ten-hour course addressing the use of\n\npsychopharmacology, psychopathology, and psychotherapeutic interventions (such as seclusion and restraint),\nand who obtains 20 hours of continuing professional education credits annually, half of them in areas relating to\nthe treatment of patients with mental illness. The ten-hour educational course is to be developed by the\nDepartment of Mental Health and Mental Retardation in consultation with consumers and ex-patients.\n[14]Wyatt v. King, civil action no. 3195-N (M.D.Ala. July 25, 1980). The court adopted this new standard \"for the\npurpose of eliminating any confusion or ambiguity and to continue the procedural safeguards that must\naccompany the use of extraordinarily or potentially hazardous modes of treatment on patients in the state's\nmental institutions.\" Id. at 1.\n[15] The exact composition of the reconstituted committee is left for the court to determine, with the assistance of\nthe parties, after approval of the revised decrees. The Committee would continue to function in its present form\nuntil the changes contemplated by the revised standard are implemented.\n[16] To avoid the prospect of repeated \"emergency\" orders approving the use of ECT, the standard directs that if\nthe treating psychiatrist anticipates that future ECT treatments may be indicated, the psychiatrist must make\n\"diligent efforts\" following the emergency treatment to obtain a judicial determination of the patient's competency\nand, if necessary, the appointment of a guardian.\n[17] The plaintiff-intervenors remain opposed to federal court involvement in the administration of ECT, fearing\nthat the proposed decree will encourage the Department to \"bypass\" state law protections regarding informed\nconsent. The plaintiff-intervenors also question the need for this provision, contending that it is based solely on\nanecdotal evidence that, on occasion, some state courts have failed to process emergency requests\nexpeditiously. The court assumes that the defendants will comply with the standards in making \"diligent\" efforts to\nsecure a state court decision, and that this provision will therefore be invoked infrequently, if at all. Informed\nconsent will remain primarily an issue for the state courts to resolve.\n[1] There is a long-standing dispute between the parties concerning whether the Wyatt standards are applicable\nto the Taylor Hardin Secure Medical Facility. This Consent Order is not intended to take a position on the matter,\nbut instead to leave the question open to future judicial resolution if necessary. The Court understands that the\nparties have no intention to request such a resolution in the foreseeable future.\n[2] This provision affects no more than 9 psychological assistants now employed by the Department. These nine,\nand only these nine, would attain QMHP status as a result of this provision.\n[3] This standard does not require that a social worker in a facility have a license for private independent practice\n(commonly referred to as a \"P.I.P.\" license). It is sufficient that the social worker be licensed by the relevant state\nagency for private social work practice under the supervision of an appropriate professional.\n[4] Currently, these programs include the North Alabama Regional Hospital, the Greil Memorial Hospital, and the\nadmissions units at Bryce and Searcy Hospitals.\n[5] Currently, the only such program is the adolescent unit at Bryce Hospital.\n[6] Currently, the Eufaula Adolescent Center and the Thomasville Adult Adjustment Center are considered long-\nterm treatment programs, as are Bryce and Searcy Hospitals, except their admissions units.\n[7] The requirement that \"the facility review a patient's need for continued inpatient treatment according to a\nschedule based on the average length of stay for the unit or program in which the patient is being treated\" applies\nonly when such data is readily available. When it is not, length of stay data for the facility will be used.\n[8] The parties anticipate that such linkage and access may not be clinically indicated in all cases in which a\nperson is discharged on the basis that he/she is an inappropriate admission. In some of these cases, the person\nmay not be mentally ill or may not require community mental health or case management services upon\ndischarge.\n[1] A psychiatrist may consider a patient to be \"competent\" when the psychiatrist reasonably believes the patient\nto be capable of giving informed consent to ECT.\n\n[2] As used in this standard, a \"guardian\" includes any person authorized by a court of competent jurisdiction to\nconsent on behalf of the patient to the administration of ECT.\n[3] Each such formal request filed in court must ask the court to appoint counsel for the patient whose\ncompetence is at issue.\n[4] Requests filed with the court for the appointment of a guardian or judicial authorization to administer ECT\nmust ask the court to appoint counsel for the patient whose competence is at issue.\n[1] In the case of the Eufaula Adolescent Center, the plaintiffs and the defendants may agree to apply a different\nstandard.\n[2] A \"qualified physician\" means, for purposes of this Standard: \n(a) a psychiatrist; or\n(b) a licensed physician (i) who has completed a basic 10-hour review course in psychiatry, including\npsychopharmacology, psychopathology, psychotherapeutic interventions (e.g., the use of seclusion/restraint),\ninterviewing, and assessment of mental status; (ii) who obtains a minimum of twenty hours of continuing medical\neducation per year; and (iii) who has demonstrated his abilities to the satisfaction of a supervising psychiatrist,\nresulting in his being granted by the Medical Staff clinical privileges as a qualified physician.\nThe 10-hour review course shall be developed by the Department of Mental Health/Mental Retardation in\nconsultation with consumers and ex-patients.\n[3] A \"qualified registered nurse\" means, for purposes of this Standard: \n(a) a QMHP registered nurse; or\n(b) a licensed registered nurse (i) who has two years of clinical experience in an inpatient psychiatric setting\nunder the supervision of a QMHP nurse and/or a psychiatrist; (ii) who has completed a basic 10-hour course that\nincludes psychopharmacology, psychopathology, and psychotherapeutic interventions (e.g., the use of seclusion/\nrestraint), interviewing, and assessment of mental status; and (iii) who obtains 20 hours of continuing\nprofessional education credits annually, 10 of which concern the treatment of persons with mental illness.\nThe 10-hour review course shall be developed by the Department of Mental Health/Mental Retardation in\nconsultation with consumers and ex-patients.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

STICKNEY, as Commissioner of Mental Health and the State of Alabama\nMental Health Officer, et al., Defendants.\nCiv. A. No. 3195-N.\nUnited States District Court, M. D. Alabama, N. D.\nMarch 12, 1971.\n782 *782 George W. Dean, Jr., Destin, Fla., for plaintiffs.\nJoseph D. Phelps, of Hill, Robison, Belser, Brewer & Phelps, Montgomery, Ala., and Jerry Wood, Asst. Atty. Gen.,\nMontgomery, Ala., for defendants.\nORDER\nJOHNSON, Chief Judge.\nThis is a class action that was initiated by guardians of patients confined at Bryce Hospital, Tuscaloosa, Alabama,\nand by certain employees of the Alabama Mental Health Board who are assigned to Bryce Hospital. The plaintiffs\n[1]\nsue on behalf of themselves and on behalf of other members of their respective classes.\nThe defendants are the commissioner and the deputy commissioner of the Department of Mental Health of the\nState of Alabama, the members of the Alabama Mental Health Board, the Governor of the State of Alabama, and\nthe probate judge of Montgomery County, Alabama, as representative of the other judges of probate in the State\nof Alabama.\nThe case is now submitted upon plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, the opposition of the defendants\nthereto, and the testimony taken in connection with the hearing on plaintiffs' motion.\nThe Alabama Mental Health Board is a public corporation created by the State of Alabama through legislation\ncodified at Title 22, Sections 311-336, Alabama Code (Supplement 1969). This board is responsible for the\nadministration of all State mental health facilities and treatment centers, including Bryce Hospital, Tuscaloosa,\nAlabama. When not in session, the Alabama Mental Health Board acts through its chief administrative officer\n[2]\nwhose title is State Mental Health Officer. This position is presently held by Dr. Stonewall B. Stickney.\nBryce Hospital is located in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and is a part of the mental health service delivery system for\nthe State of Alabama. Bryce Hospital has approximately 5,000 patients, the majority of whom are involuntarily\ncommitted through civil proceedings by the various probate judges in Alabama. Approximately 1,600 employees\nwere assigned to various duties at the Bryce Hospital facility when this case was heard on plaintiffs' motion for a\npreliminary injunction.\nDuring October 1970, the Alabama Mental Health Board and the administration of the Department of Mental\n783 Health terminated 99 of these employees. These terminations were made *783 due to budgetary considerations\nand, according to the evidence, were necessary to bring the expenditures at Bryce Hospital within the framework\nof available resources. This budget cut at Bryce Hospital was allegedly necessary because of a reduction in the\ntax revenues available to the Department of Mental Health of the State of Alabama, and also because an\nadjustment in the pay periods for personnel which had been directed by the Alabama legislature would require\nadditional expenditures. The employees who were terminated included 41 persons who were assigned to duties\n\nsuch as food service, maintenance, typing, and other functional duties not involving direct patient care in the\nhospital therapeutic programs. Twenty-six persons were discharged who were involved in patient activity and\nrecreational programs. These workers were involved in planning social and other types of recreational programs\nfor the patient population. The remaining 32 employees who were discharged included 9 in the department of\npsychology, 11 in the social service department, with varying degrees of educational background and experience,\nthree registered nurses, two physicians, one dentist and six dental aides. After the termination of these\nemployees, there remained at Bryce Hospital 17 physicians, approximately 850 psychiatric aides, 21 registered\nnurses, 12 patient activity workers, and 12 psychologists with varying academic qualifications and experience,\ntogether with 13 social service workers. Of the employees remaining whose duties involved direct patient care in\nthe hospital therapeutic programs, there are only one Ph.D. clinical psychologist, three medical doctors with\nsome psychiatric training (including one board eligible but no board-certified psychiatrist) and two M.S.W. social\nworkers.\nThe Alabama Department of Mental Health, during the last two and one-half years, has been engaged in rather\nextensive reorganization. This reorganizational effort, according to testimony, is designed to render a more\n[3]\nefficient and effective delivery of treatment to patients at Bryce Hospital and in the other mental hospitals  within\nthe Alabama Mental Health system. A part of the organizational effort was a transition from a departmental\nsystem of organization at Bryce Hospital to the unit-team system of delivery of mental health services and\ntreatment to patients at Bryce Hospital. The unit-team system, as it is termed, divides the State of Alabama into\ncontiguous geographical county units, with mentally ill patients from each such geographical area being assigned\nto a particular unit within the hospital. This geographical distribution is divided between Searcy and Bryce\nHospitals, with Searcy accommodating the counties in the southerly part of the State and Bryce in the remainder\nof the State. Approximately ten units are ultimately planned for the Bryce facility. The unit is to be headed by a\nteam leader who will normally be a professional. It is proposed that the units contain such professionals as\nphysicians, psychologists, and social workers, as well as psychiatric aides and nurses. The patients within the\nunit are to receive individual attention from such hospital personnel according to their needs. This Court cannot\nnow say upon the evidence that has been presented that the decision of the Alabama Department of Mental\nHealth to adopt the unit-team treatment delivery approach was an improper exercise of medical and professional\njudgment. The evidence is clear that the unit-team approach is a scientifically recognized and acceptable method\nof delivering treatment to mental health patients. It seems to be a nationally recognized method for the\nimprovement of the delivery of therapeutic services to patients in mental hospitals. This Court is unable at this\n784 time to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of the unit-team delivery approach at Bryce Hospital. This *784 is\ntrue due to the fact that at the time of the hearing upon plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction the transition\nhad only just been completed, but not fully implemented.\nIncluded in the Bryce Hospital patient population are between 1,500 and 1,600 geriatric patients who are\nprovided custodial care but no treatment. The evidence is without dispute that these patients are not properly\nconfined at Bryce Hospital since these geriatric patients cannot benefit from any psychiatric treatment or are not\nmentally ill. Also included in the Bryce patient population are approximately 1,000 mental retardates, most of\nwhom receive only custodial care without any psychiatric treatment. Thus, the evidence reflects that there is\nconsiderable confusion regarding the primary mission and function of Bryce Hospital since certain nonpsychotic\ngeriatric patients and the mental retardates, and perhaps other nonmentally ill persons, have been and remain\ncommitted there for a variety of reasons.\nThe evidence further reflects that Alabama ranks fiftieth among all the states in the Union in per-patient\n[4]\nexpenditures per day.  This Court must, and does, find from the evidence that the programs of treatment in use\nat Bryce Hospital prior to the reorganization that has resulted in the unit-team approach were scientifically and\nmedically inadequate. These programs of treatment failed to conform to any known minimums established for\nproviding treatment for the mentally ill.\nThe patients at Bryce Hospital, for the most part, were involuntarily committed through noncriminal procedures\nand without the constitutional protections that are afforded defendants in criminal proceedings. When patients are\nso committed for treatment purposes they unquestionably have a constitutional right to receive such individual\ntreatment as will give each of them a realistic opportunity to be cured or to improve his or her mental condition. \n\nRouse v. Cameron, 125 U.S.App.D.C. 366, 373 F.2d 451; Covington v. Harris, 136 U.S.App.D.C. 35, 419 F.2d\n617. Adequate and effective treatment is constitutionally required because, absent treatment, the hospital is\ntransformed \"into a penitentiary where one could be held indefinitely for no convicted offense.\" Ragsdale v.\nOverholser, 108 U.S.App.D. C. 308, 281 F.2d 943, 950 (1960). The purpose of involuntary hospitalization for\ntreatment purposes is treatment and not mere custodial care or punishment. This is the only justification, from a\nconstitutional standpoint, that allows civil commitments to mental institutions such as Bryce. According to the\nevidence in this case, the failure of Bryce Hospital to supply adequate treatment is due to a lack of operating\nfunds. The failure to provide suitable and adequate treatment to the mentally ill cannot be justified by lack of staff\nor facilities. Rouse v. Cameron, supra. In Rouse the Court stated:\nWe are aware that shortage of psychiatric personnel is a most serious problem today in the care\nof the mentally ill. In the opinion of the American Psychiatric Association no tax-supported hospital\nin the United States can be considered adequately staffed. We also recognize that shortage\ncannot be remedied immediately. But indefinite delay cannot be approved. \"The rights here\nasserted are * * * present rights * * * and, unless there is an overwhelming compelling reason,\nthey are to be promptly fulfilled.\" Watson v. City of Memphis, 373 U.S. 526, 533, [83 S. Ct. 1314,\n1318, 10 L.Ed.2d 529] (1963). (Emphasis in original.)\n785 *785 There can be no legal (or moral) justification for the State of Alabama's failing to afford treatment 00 and\n97\nadequate treatment from a medical standpoint 00 to the several thousand patients who have been civilly\n97\ncommitted to Bryce's for treatment purposes. To deprive any citizen of his or her liberty upon the altruistic theory\nthat the confinement is for humane therapeutic reasons and then fail to provide adequate treatment violates the\nvery fundamentals of due process.\nAs stated, this Court cannot at this time make any finding with regard to whether the unit-team system approach\nor the departmental approach is a better treatment delivery mechanism for Bryce Hospital. Nor can this Court at\nthis time make any finding regarding the \"adequacy\" of the treatment to be given under the unit-team approach. It\nmay very well be that when the unit-team approach is implemented in the Bryce facility the patients committed\nthere will be receiving such individual treatment as will give each of them a realistic opportunity to be cured or to\nimprove his mental condition. On the other hand, it may be that the unit-team approach will not provide such\ntreatment.\nThe plaintiffs by formal motion ask this Court for an order of reference in order that there may be an authoritative\ndetermination of standards of the adequacy of the mental treatment now used and to be used in effectuating the\nright to treatment for those who are incarcerated in the Bryce facility. The defendants oppose this Court's making\nsuch an order of reference at this time, arguing that it is only proper that the defendants be allowed the\nopportunity to set standards and to make evaluations for submission to the Court prior to the time this Court\nappoints masters to perform this task. This Court has concluded that it will, for the time being, reserve ruling upon\nplaintiffs' motion for an order of reference. The reservation upon plaintiffs' motion for an order of reference will be \nfor a limited time so as to afford the defendants an opportunity to promulgate and implement proper standards for\nthe adequate mental care of the patients in the Bryce Hospital facility and in order to allow the defendants a\nreasonable time to implement fully the unit-team approach and to measure the effectiveness of the unit-team\ntherapeutic treatment programs at the Bryce facility. This Court recognizes that this is a matter which will take\nthorough study and will require professional judgment and evaluation. The evidence reflects that the defendant\nDr. Stonewall B. Stickney is, if he is afforded adequate funds for staffing and facilities, qualified to study, to\nevaluate, to institute, and to implement fully appropriate mental health treatment programs. A failure on the part of\nthe defendants to implement fully, within six months from the date of this order, a treatment program so as to give\neach of the treatable patients committed to Bryce facility a realistic opportunity to be cured or to improve his or\nher mental condition, will necessitate this Court's appointing a panel of experts in the area of mental health to\ndetermine what objective and subjective hospital standards will be required to furnish adequate treatment to the\ntreatable mentally ill in the Bryce facility. This will include an order requiring a full inspection of the existing\nfacilities, a study of the operational and treatment practices and programs, and recommendations that will enable\nthis Court to determine what will be necessary in order to render the Bryce facilities a mental health unit providing\nadequate and effective treatment, in a constitutional sense, for the patients who have been involuntarily\ncommitted and are confined there.\n\nAccordingly, it is the order, judgment and decree of this Court that the defendants, within ninety days from the\ndate hereof, prepare and file with this Court:\na. A precise definition of the mission and functions of Bryce Hospital;\n786 b. A specific plan whereby appropriate and adequate treatment will be provided to the patients at Bryce Hospital \n*786 who, from a medical standpoint, may be responsive to mental health treatment;\nc. A report reflecting in detail the progress on the implementation of the unit-team approach in the Bryce facility.\nThis report should reflect the number of unit teams, the number of patients in each unit, a breakdown of\nprofessionals assigned to each unit by discipline, and the number of patients in each unit who are receiving\nindividual attention from some member of the professional disciplines and how often this treatment is accorded.\nIn this connection, records are to be maintained detailing the names of the patients entitled to receive 00 from a\n97\nmedical standpoint 00 psychiatric care and treatment, and the type and extent of the treatment being\n97\nadministered. Such reports must be made available to plaintiffs' attorneys and to the attorneys of any other\nparties who may appear in this case as amicus.\nIt is further ordered that the United States of America, acting through the United States Department of Justice and\nother appropriate officials such as the officials of the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare,\nbe and it is hereby requested and invited to appear in this cause as amicus for the purpose of assisting this Court\nin evaluating the treatment programs at the Bryce Hospital facility and in assisting the defendants in meeting the\nsubjective standards of the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare as said standards pertain\nto adequate treatment, personnel, space, equipment and facilities. The Department of Health, Education and\nWelfare and the United States Public Health Service are also requested and invited to participate, through the\nUnited States Department of Justice, as amicus, in order to assist the defendants in qualifying for Social Security\nbenefits for the approximately 1,500 to 1,600 geriatric patients who are presently housed at Bryce Hospital for\ncustodial purposes; this invitation to these agencies is also for the purpose of rendering assistance to the\ndefendants in formulating and implementing a feasible plan that will benefit each of these geriatric patients by his\nor her becoming appropriately situated in some type facility other than a facility for the treatment of the mentally\nill.\nIt is further ordered that ruling on plaintiffs' motion for an order of reference be and the same is hereby reserved.\nThis Court specifically retains jurisdiction of this case.\n[1] Plaintiff-employees have now withdrawn their request that they be reinstated as employees of the Alabama\nMental Health Board. This completely eliminates their reinstatement claims from the case.\n[2] The Alabama Mental Health Board is also responsible for other State mental health facilities, such as that\nlocated at Searcy Hospital, Mount Vernon, Alabama. However, in this case this Court is not concerned with the\noperation of the facility at Searcy, since plaintiffs have not properly raised the \"adequacy of treatment\" afforded by\nthe State of Alabama to patients at Searcy Hospital. Plaintiffs, in their post-trial briefs, argue that they have\nproperly raised the \"adequacy of treatment\" afforded the patients at Searcy Hospital; however, this Court finds\nthat the defendants were not fairly apprised that plaintiffs intended to include Searcy and the pleadings in this\ncase do not so reflect.\n[3] Searcy, located at Mount Vernon, Alabama.\n[4] No evidence was presented on the point, but the plaintiffs in their post-trial brief advised this Court that Bryce\nHospital has not conformed with the standards of the Social Security Administration to the point of becoming\neligibile for federal funds under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Plaintiffs' counsel further advised in their\nbrief that Bryce Hospital had not applied for certification for eligibility for these funds.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

When patients are so committed for treatment purposes they\nunquestionably have a constitutional right to receive such individual treatment as will give each of\nthem a realistic opportunity to be cured or to improve his or her mental condition. . . .\nAdequate and effective treatment is constitutionally required because, absent treatment, the\nhospital is transformed \"into a penitentiary where one could be held indefinitely for no convicted\noffense.\" Ragsdale v. Overholser, 108 U.S.App.D.C. 308 [315], 281 F.2d 943, 950 (1960). The\npurpose of involuntary hospitalization for treatment purposes is treatment and not mere custodial\ncare or punishment. This is the only justification, from a constitutional standpoint, that allows civil\ncommitments to mental institutions. . . .\nAt the request of defendants, the Court in the March 1971 order allowed defendants six months to set standards\nand implement fully a treatment program so as to give each treatable patient a realistic opportunity to be cured or\n1343 to improve his or her mental condition. The case is again submitted upon defendants' *1343 reports and the\n[2]\nseveral objections thereto.\nIn the matters presented to this Court by the parties, there seem to be three fundamental conditions for adequate\nand effective treatment programs in public mental institutions. These three fundamental conditions are: (1) a\n\nhumane psychological and physical environment, (2) qualified staff in numbers sufficient to administer adequate\ntreatment and (3) individualized treatment plans. The report filed by defendants with this Court, as well as the\nreports and objections of other parties who have studied the conditions at Bryce Hospital, demonstrates rather\nconclusively that the hospital is deficient in all three of these fundamental respects.\nThe psychological and physical environment problems are, in some instances, interrelated. For example, the\ndormitories are barn-like structures with no privacy for the patients. For most patients there is not even a space\nprovided which he can think of as his own. The toilets in restrooms seldom have partitions between them. These\nare dehumanizing factors which degenerate the patients' self esteem. Also contributing to the poor psychological\nenvironment are the shoddy wearing apparel furnished the patients, the non-therapeutic work assigned to\npatients (mostly compulsory, uncompensated housekeeping chores), and the degrading and humiliating\nadmissions procedure which creates in the patient an impression of the hospital as a prison or as a \"crazy\nhouse\". Other conditions which render the physical environment at Bryce critically substandard are extreme\nventilation problems, fire and other emergency hazards, and overcrowding caused to some degree by poor\nutilization of space. In addition, the quality of the food served the patients is inferior. Only fifty cents per patient\nper day is spent for food, and sanitation procedures with regard to the preparation and service of food, commonly\nrecognized as basic health practices and utilized at other such hospitals, are not followed at Bryce.\nThe second fundamental condition needed for effective treatment is a qualified and numerically sufficient staff. It\nis clear from the reports of Bryce's expert consultants that Bryce is wholly deficient in this area, both as regards\nits professional staff and its nonprofessional staff. More psychiatrists, Doctor of Philosophy level psychologists\nand qualified Medical Doctors are not only a medical but are also a constitutional necessity in this public\ninstitution. Special staff is needed to place the custodial patients still residing at Bryce. Although, as Rouse v.\nCameron, 125 U.S. App.D.C. 366, 373 F.2d 451 (1966) points out, contact with the nonprofessional staff should\nbe therapeutic, very little of this therapeutic value is realized at Bryce. The nonprofessional staff is poorly trained;\nnurses aides, for example, are required to have only a tenth grade education. Also there is no effective \"in-\nservice\" training program for, or even any regular supervision over, the nonprofessional staff. The\nnonprofessionals are spread very thinly; thus, they are overworked, creating not only an inadequate situation for\nthe patients but extreme stresses for individual aides. Both Bryce consultants agree with amici and plaintiffs that\nadditional aides and activities therapists are a necessity.\nThe third necessary condition for an effective treatment program is individualized treatment plans. Bryce is also\ndeficient in this area. Although every patient has been classified as to treatability, the records made on each\n1344 patient are inadequate. Minimum medical standards require that periodic inquiries be *1344 made into the needs\nof the patients with a view toward providing suitable treatment for them. Yet, at Bryce the records evidence no\nnotations of mental change. They consist generally only of notations of the times and amounts of drugs given and\nparticipation in the Patient Operated Program, the Token Economy Program or the Level Program. Bryce's own\nconsultant advises that treatment is geared primarily to housekeeping functions. The three main programs which\nhave been implemented motivate the patients to some activity and do effect some degree of socialization, but at\na minimum level. What programs there are do not yet seem to be operating effectively, partly because of the\nuntrained staff members supervising them.\nAll the objections raised by amici and by plaintiffs generally are supported by the reports of Bryce's consultants.\nThere seems to be a consensus of opinion among the experts that the treatment program at Bryce Hospital\ncontinues to be wholly inadequate. There are strong indications from the evidence before the Court, sparse as it\nis, that the conditions at Partlow and Searcy are no better than those at Bryce.\nThe primary and fundamental question remaining in this case, therefore, is not whether the defendants have\npromulgated and implemented a program that meets minimum medical and constitutional standards, but what\n[3]\nprocedure this Court should now pursue to ensure that this be done.  Although the goals defendants have set\nare rather vague, the defendants Stickney and Folsom, who has since the earlier hearing in this cause been\nretained as Superintendent of Bryce Hospital, have to this point generally demonstrated good faith and a desire\nto attain minimum medical and constitutional standards in the three primary mental institutions now operated by\nthe State of Alabama. Consequently this Court will again defer turning over the operation of these institutions to a\npanel of masters.\n\nNonetheless, minimum medical and constitutional standards for the operation of these institutions must be\nformulated. Defendants have been given an opportunity to perform this task and have failed. It must be kept in\nmind that plaintiffs' rights are present ones, and they must be not only declared but secured at the earliest\npracticable date. This Court has concluded that the most feasible procedure to be followed as to this phase of the\nlitigation is for this matter to be set again for formal hearing, this time for the purpose of allowing the parties and\namici the opportunity to present proposed standards that meet medical and constitutional requirements for the\noperation of the three mental institutions herein concerned and to present evidence by experts in support thereof.\nFrom this evidence this Court will establish standards and in due course order their implementation.\nAccordingly, it is the order, judgment and decree of this Court that this cause be and the same is hereby set for\nhearing for the purposes hereinabove stated commencing at 10:00 a. m. on January 18, 1972.\n[1] On August 22, 1971, this Court granted plaintiffs' proposed amendment to enlarge the class to include\npatients involuntarily confined for mental treatment purposes at Partlow State School and Hospital and Searcy\nHospital at Mt. Vernon, Alabama. This did not necessitate additional defendants since by authority of Title 22,\nSection 318, Code of Alabama, the defendant board has control and jurisdiction of all the mental institutions\nherein involved.\n[2] As directed, the United States of America formally appeared as amicus curiae. By leave of the Court the\nAmerican Psychological Association, the American Ortho-psychiatric Association, and the American Civil Liberties\nUnion have also appeared as amici curiae. The plaintiffs and all amici have filed objections to defendants'\nreports.\n[3] As stated earlier, the treatment program now being implemented at Bryce is wholly inadequate. Likewise, the\ninterim report filed by defendants on June 10, 1971, is inadequate. This report and the other matters presented to\nthis Court upon this submission affirmatively reflect that defendants have formulated no standards for staffing, for\nimproving the physical environment or for realistically improved treatment plans. While it may be that adequate\nfinancial means had not at the time of the filing of defendants' reports been made available by the Alabama\nLegislature to satisfy these medically and constitutionally mandated standards, the standards should at least\nhave been formulated.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Johnson, Jr., writing on behalf of a three-judge district\ncourt, found that Alabama's procedures for involuntary civil commitment of the mentally ill to state institutions did\nnot comport with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Lynch\nv. Baxley, 386 F.Supp. 378 (M.D.Ala.). Judge Johnson set forth and imposed on the state \"those standards and\nsafeguards which, at a minimum, the Due Process Clause requires for the protection of persons whose liberty is\nplaced in jeopardy as a consequence of their becoming the subjects of civil commitment proceedings against\ntheir will.\" Id. at 387. Seventeen years later and in another lawsuit, this court is now confronted with an equally\nimportant question from the other end of the commitment process: what procedures, if any, the state must adopt\nto ensure that mentally ill persons civilly confined against their will are released when their confinement is no\nlonger necessary. Based upon the evidence and briefs submitted by the parties, the court holds that the state\nshould be required to conduct post-commitment periodic judicial reviews, using the same \"standards and\nsafeguards\" articulated in Lynch, to determine when persons who have been involuntarily civilly confined due to\nmental illness should be released.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\nSince its inception in 1970, this ongoing litigation has focused primarily on the conditions in the state's mental\nhealth and mental retardation facilities. See, e.g., Wyatt v. Stickney (Wyatt I), 344 F.Supp. 373 (M.D.Ala.1972)\n(Johnson, J.) (establishing minimum constitutional standards for the adequate care and treatment of mentally ill\npatients), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, and rem'd in part,503 F.2d 1305 (5th Cir.1974); Wyatt v. Stickney (Wyatt II),\n344 F.Supp. 387 (M.D.Ala.1972) (Johnson, J.) (establishing minimum constitutional standards for the adequate\ncare and treatment of mentally retarded patients), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, and rem'd in part,503 F.2d 1305 (5th\nCir.1974). On January 25, 1991, Diane Martin and eleven other patients in Alabama's mental health institutions\nintervened as plaintiffs in this litigation. These intervenors, sometimes referred to as the \"Martin intervenors,\"\nasserted a number of new claims, including the one now before the court: that the state fails to provide adequate\nprocedures for the release of those patients who no longer meet the requirements for involuntary civil\nconfinement of the mentally ill. As the court will explain below, this new claim can be viewed as the third chapter\n[1]\nin a continuing effort to bring the state's involuntary civil commitment procedures up to constitutional muster.\nChapter I: Lynch v. Baxley. In 1974, this court found that Alabama's then-existing civil commitment statutes for the\nmentally ill violated due process in large part because they provided inadequate notice, allowed detention without\n1510 a probable cause hearing within a reasonable period of time, did not require the presence at the hearing *1510 of\nthe person to be committed, did not require counsel, and contained ill-defined standards for commitment. Lynch\nv. Baxley, 386 F.Supp. 378 (M.D.Ala.1974) (three-judge court) (Johnson, J.). The starting point of Lynch was a\npresumption that all civil commitments by probate courts in Alabama were involuntary and that, absent a knowing\nand intelligent waiver, all persons the state sought to be committed had to be afforded basic due process\nprotections. The court stated that,\nall Alabama probate court commitments are to be presumed involuntary unless and until there has\nbeen a judicial determination in an adversary proceeding during which the person proposed to be\ncommitted is represented by counsel, that the commitment is in fact a voluntary one, knowingly\nand intelligently consented to by the person to be committed. In the absence of any such judicial\ndetermination, the commitment proceedings are involuntary as a matter of law and must comply\nwith the following minimum standards.\n386 F.Supp. at 387. The court imposed on the state a number of minimum standards and procedures which it\nconsidered to be required by the due process clause. In the judgment which accompanied the memorandum\nopinion entered on December 14, 1974, the three-judge court succinctly articulated these standards and\nprocedures as follows:\n(a) Adequate notice of the hearing and its purpose shall be given sufficiently in advance of the\nscheduled proceedings to permit a reasonable opportunity to prepare therefor.\n(b) The person proposed to be committed or recommitted shall have the right to attend the hearing\nunless the Court, after appropriate inquiry, determines that he is so mentally or physically ill as to\nbe incapable of attendance.\n(c) The subject of the hearing shall be informed of his right to counsel and to the appointment of\ncounsel if indigent. Where the recommitment of a presently confined patient is sought, a guardian \nad litem who is an attorney shall be appointed.\n(d) Any person now unlawfully confined shall be entitled to independent expert examination and\nassistance in preparation for the hearing, by means of court appointment where he cannot afford\nto retain such services.\n(e) If recommitment hearings are to be conducted on the hospital premises, they shall take place\nin surroundings as noncoercive as possible. In no event shall such hearings be held in patients'\n\nquarters. Appropriate street dress shall be made available to each subject, if not already available\nto him.\n(f) No person shall be committed or recommitted unless the probate judge finds:\n(i) That he is mentally ill;\n(ii) That he poses a real and present threat of substantial harm to himself or to others;\n(iii) That the danger has been evidenced by a recent overt act of the individual;\n(iv) That there is treatment available for the illness diagnosed or that confinement of the\ndangerous but untreatable individual is necessary for his and the community's safety and well-\nbeing; and\n(v) That commitment or recommitment is the least restrictive alternative necessary and available\nfor treatment of the person's illness.\n(g) The necessity for commitment or recommitment must be proved by evidence which is clear,\nunequivocal, and convincing.\n(h) At the hearing, the subject shall have the right to offer evidence, to be confronted with the\nwitnesses against him and to cross-examine them, and the privilege against self-incrimination.\nThe rules of evidence applicable in other judicial proceedings in this state shall be followed in\ninvoluntary commitment proceedings.\n(i) A full record of the proceedings, including findings adequate for review, shall be compiled and\nretained by the probate court.\n1511 *1511 (j) Nothing contained in this Order shall be construed to limit the power of the guardian ad\nlitem to waive any of his client's rights when, in his judgment and in the judgment of the probate\njudge after appropriate findings of fact, waiver is in the best interests of his client.\nIn response to the memorandum opinion and judgment of the court, Alabama enacted new statutes governing the\ninvoluntary civil commitment of the mentally ill. These statutes are found at 1975 Alabama Code §§ 22-52-1\n[2]\nthrough 22-52-37 (Michie 1990).\nChapter II: Birl v. Wallis. In the mid-1980's, this court was confronted with a challenge to the constitutionality of\nthe procedures used by Alabama to recommit individuals who had been released from state mental health\nhospitals for \"trial visits.\" The court found that, because these patients at the time they are released on trial visits\nhave improved to the point that they have a constitutional right to an unconditional discharge, returns from trial\nvisits are equivalent to initial commitments and thus require that the procedures and standards set forth in Lynch\nbe met before patients may be reconfined. Birl v. Wallis (Birl II), 633 F.Supp. 707 (M.D.Ala.1986) (Thompson, J.); \nBirl v. Wallis (Birl I), 619 F.Supp. 481 (M.D.Ala.1985) (Thompson, J.).\nChapter III: Wyatt v. King. In their current complaint-in-intervention filed in early 1991, the Martin intervenors\nclaim that Alabama's indeterminate involuntary civil confinement of the mentally ill violates the Due Process\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as enforced through 42 U.S.C.A. § 1983\n(West 1981 & Supp.1991). They have properly invoked the jurisdiction of the court pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. §§\n1331, 1343 (West 1966, 1976 & Supp.1991). They have named as defendants the Commissioner of Mental\nHealth and Mental Retardation and the directors of the various state mental health institutions.\nThe evidence the Martin intervenors have submitted to the court reflects the following. The State of Alabama\nneither has a limit on the length of civil commitment nor does it provide for adversarial post-commitment periodic\nreview. Rather, proceedings for release are nonadversarial and made by the personnel of the Department of\nMental Health and Mental Retardation without any hearing or review by any independent decisionmaker. There\nare approximately 1,800 residents in the state's five mental health hospitals, and 90% of these patients were\ncommitted involuntarily and thus are there against their will. The intervenors have submitted further evidence\n\nwhich suggests that some of these residents no longer meet Lynch's initial commitment requirements. For\nexample, according to the intervenors, \"L.M.\" was involuntarily committed to the state's mental health facilities in\n1970. Over these 20 years, she has never been subjected to any formal procedure to determine whether her\ncontinued confinement is appropriate. Indeed, although an evaluating psychiatrist noted in 1986 that foster care\nwould be appropriate for her, no discharge procedures were ever initiated.\n1512 *1512 The Martin intervenors seek both declaratory and injunctive relief requiring that the state conduct post-\ncommitment periodic judicial reviews using the standards and procedures articulated in both the memorandum\nopinion and judgment in Lynch. The intervenors suggest that these reviews be conducted no later than 150 days\nafter the initial commitment and, if the commitment is renewed, annually thereafter. Their proposed relief is as\nfollows:\n(1) The initial period of involuntary commitment pursuant to the State of Alabama's civil\ncommitment statutes shall not exceed 150 days.\n(2) If the state desires further commitment, the director of the state mental health facility or his\ndesignee must file a petition for renewal of a commitment within 30 days prior of the expiration of\nthe initial commitment order. The petition must explain in detail why renewal of commitment is\nbeing requested and why less restrictive conditions of treatment are not appropriate.\n(3) No renewal of commitment shall exceed a period of one year.\n(4) A patient involuntarily civilly committed shall be released if (a) the director of a state mental\nhealth facility or his designee does not file a petition for renewal of commitment within the time\nprescribed, or (b) a state court denies the petition for renewal, or (c) no state-court order renewing\ncommitment is issued before expiration of the current period of authorized commitment.\nThe defendants do not concede that their current involuntary civil commitment procedures violate the Due\nProcess Clause, but they have agreed that if the procedures are unconstitutional the court may then adopt the\nintervenors' proposed new procedures and standards as relief.\nII. DISCUSSION\nThe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that a state\nshall not \"deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" The Martin intervenors\ncharge that Alabama's indeterminate involuntary civil commitment of the mentally ill deprives these persons of\ntheir \"liberty\" without due process of law. In determining whether their claim has merit, the court will engage in a\ntwo-part analysis. The court will address, first, whether these persons have a \"liberty interest\" in being released\nwithin the meaning of the Due Process Clause, and, second, if so, what process is due before that interest may\nbe curtailed.\nA.\nPersons committed against their will suffer not only a dramatic loss of physical freedom with its severely detailed\ncontrol and invasive treatment, they also cannot enjoy those mundane, daily pleasures 00 working, shopping,\n97\nenjoying the companionship of family and friends, or simply being left alone 00 the loss of which we on the outside\n97\nwould find to be not only intolerable but a threat to our very sanity. It is therefore not surprising that the United\nStates Supreme Court has characterized involuntary civil commitment of a person in state mental health\ninstitutions as a \"massive\" curtailment of liberty. Humphrey v. Cady, 405 U.S. 504, 509, 92 S.Ct. 1048, 1052, 31\nL.Ed.2d 394 (1972). It is also not surprising that the parties to this litigation have stipulated that, \"People confined\n[3]\nin state mental health facilities in Alabama under civil commitment suffer a significant deprivation of liberty.\"\nThe issue for the court is whether, based on the above, the court can further conclude that the failure to release\npatients who no longer meet the requirements for civil commitment implicates a liberty interest. For the reasons\nthat follow, the court finds that it must so conclude.\n\nIn 1972, in Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715, 720, 92 S.Ct. 1845, 1849, 32 L.Ed.2d 435 (1972), the Supreme\nCourt of the United States held that a state cannot constitutionally commit a person for an indefinite period simply\n1513 on account of his incompetency to stand trial on the charges filed against him. In reaching this conclusion, *1513\nthe Court wrote that \"due process requires that the nature and duration of commitment bear some reasonable\nrelation to the purpose for which the individual is committed.\" Id. at 738, 92 S.Ct. at 1858. Implicit in this language\nwas the limitation that the duration of confinement not exceed its purpose.\nBut what was implicit in the language in Jackson became express three years later in O'Connor v. Donaldson,\n422 U.S. 563, 95 S.Ct. 2486, 45 L.Ed.2d 396 (1975). There, in upholding a challenge by Kenneth Donaldson to\nhis continued confinement against his will in a Florida hospital, the Court observed that, \"Nor is it enough that\nDonaldson's original confinement was founded upon a constitutionally adequate basis, if in fact it was, because\neven if his involuntary confinement was initially permissible, it could not constitutionally continue after that basis\nno longer existed.\" Id. at 574-75, 95 S.Ct. at 2494. The Court explained that a state cannot refuse to release\nmentally ill patients \"merely to ensure them a living standard superior to that they enjoy in the private community,\"\nid., or \"solely to save its citizens from exposure to those whose ways are different.\" Id. The \"mere presence of\nmental illness,\" the Court continued, \"does not disqualify a person from preferring his home to the comforts of an\ninstitution.\" Id. See also Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584, 600, 99 S.Ct. 2493, 2503, 61 L.Ed.2d 101 (1979) (\"It is not\ndisputed that a child, in common with adults, has a substantial liberty interest in not being confined unnecessarily\nfor medical treatment\"); Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 426, 99 S.Ct. 1804, 1809, 60 L.Ed.2d 323 (1979) (\"the\nState has no interest in confining individuals involuntarily if they are not mentally ill or if they do not pose some\ndanger to themselves or others\"); Birl II, 633 F.Supp. at 710-11 (\"it is well established that a patient must be\nunconditionally released from involuntary confinement once the grounds for initial confinement cease to exist\"); \nStitt v. Department of Mental Health & Mental Retardation, 562 So.2d 259, 262 (Ala.Civ.App. 1990) (\"The State\ndoes not have an interest in confining individuals involuntarily if they are not mentally ill or if they do not pose a\ndanger to themselves or others\").\nMoreover and more specifically, it is not necessary that this court look beyond its own existing orders governing\nthe operation of Alabama's mental health system to conclude that involuntarily confined patients have a liberty\ninterest in immediate release once their confinement is no longer necessary. In its 1972 order establishing\nminimum constitutional standards for the adequate treatment of the mentally ill, this court listed as one of the\nstandards that, \"If the patient no longer requires hospitalization in accordance with the standards for commitment\n..., he must be released immediately unless he agrees to continue with treatment on a voluntary basis.\" Wyatt I,\n344 F.Supp. at 386 (standard 33).\nThe conclusion is therefore inescapable that involuntarily civilly confined patients have a liberty interest in being\nreleased once the grounds for their confinement cease to exist. When patients have recovered to the point that\ntheir condition no longer satisfies the requirements for initial commitment, they must be released.\nB.\nHaving concluded that persons involuntarily confined have a liberty interest in being released immediately if\nhospitalization is no longer necessary, the court must next determine what process is due to ensure that that\ninterest is not improperly curtailed. The Martin intervenors suggest that, at a minimum, due process requires, first,\nthat the state conduct post-commitment periodic reviews and, second, that these reviews be judicial in nature\nusing the standards and procedures articulated in Lynch. More specifically, the intervenors have submitted a\nproposal, set forth earlier, requiring that the state, using Lynch standards and procedures, review the need for a\npatient's continued involuntary confinement within 150 days of initial commitment and, if the commitment is\nrenewed, annually thereafter.\n1514 The function of due process \"is to minimize the risk of erroneous decisions.\" *1514Greenholtz v. Inmates of\nNebraska, 442 U.S. 1, 13, 99 S.Ct. 2100, 2106, 60 L.Ed.2d 668 (1979). \"Because of the broad spectrum of\nconcerns to which the term must apply, flexibility is necessary to gear the process to the particular need; the\nquantum and quality of the process due in a particular situation depend upon the need to serve the purpose of\n\nminimizing the risk of error.\" Id. The Supreme Court has indicated that, in determining what procedures are\nrequired to minimize this risk in the liberty interest context, a court must balance a number of factors:\nFirst, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous\ndeprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of\nadditional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government's interest, including the\nfunction involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute\nprocedural requirement would entail.\nParham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584, 599-600, 99 S.Ct. 2493, 2502-03, 61 L.Ed.2d 101 (1979),quoting Mathews v.\nEldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 903, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976). In applying these factors, this court will\nconsider the interests of the involuntarily civilly committed patient. The court will also examine the interests of the\nstate in the involuntary civil commitment process. And finally, the court will consider whether, in light of these\ninterests, current procedures are insufficient and supplemental ones 00 in particular, the Martin intervenors'\n97\nsuggested new procedures and standards 00 are needed to reduce adequately the risk of an erroneous\n97\ndeprivation of a patient's liberty interest.\nIdentifying the interests at stake is somewhat easy. On the one hand, for the reasons given above, persons civilly\ncommitted against their will have a substantial interest in being released once they no longer meet the\nrequirements for commitment. On the other hand, both the involuntary committed and the state have a legitimate\ninterest in the state's provision, through its parens patriae powers, of \"care to its citizens who are unable because\nof emotional disorders to care for themselves.\" Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 426, 99 S.Ct. 1804, 1809, 60\nL.Ed.2d 323 (1979). The \"state also has authority under its police power to protect the community from the\ndangerous tendencies of some who are mentally ill.\" Id. In addition, both the involuntarily committed and the state\nhave a substantial interest in assuring that the commitment procedures are not so complex and burdensome that\nthey unnecessarily divert scarce public resources from the central objective of providing health care or that they\nerect unnecessary procedural barriers to the provision of care to those who need it. Medical personnel must be\nable to devote their time and energy to performing the task for which they were trained, and the commitment\nprocess must not be so onerous that family and friends of those in need of state health care abandon the process\nfor less substantively beneficial alternatives for their loved ones.\nThe more difficult issue is what minimum process is due to reduce the risk of erroneous continued confinement of\npersons without undercutting the efforts to further the above identified beneficial interests of both the state and\nthe mentally ill in the involuntary civil commitment process. The United States Supreme Court has suggested that\na minimum requirement would be some form of post-commitment periodic review. In Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S.\n584, 607, 99 S.Ct. 2493, 2506, 61 L.Ed.2d 101 (1979), in rejecting a challenge to Georgia's procedures for the\nvoluntary commitment of children by their parents, the Court wrote that \"it is necessary that the child's continuing\nneed for commitment be reviewed periodically.\" Two United States Circuit Courts of Appeals have similarly\nsuggested that periodic review is required. In Doe v. Austin, 848 F.2d 1386, 1395-96 (6th Cir.),cert. denied,488\nU.S. 967, 109 S.Ct. 495, 102 L.Ed.2d 531 (1988), the Sixth Circuit stated that, \"Of course, because involuntary\ncommitment cannot continue after the basis for that commitment ceases to exist, due process requires that some\n1515 periodic review take place during *1515 confinement.\" (Emphasis in original). And in Clark v. Cohen, 794 F.2d 79,\n86 (3rd Cir.),cert. denied,479 U.S. 962, 107 S.Ct. 459, 93 L.Ed.2d 404 (1986), the Third Circuit wrote that \"due\nprocess required periodic reviews of [a patient's] continuing need for institutionalization.\" \"Periodic reviews are\nrequired,\" the court continued, \"because if the basis for a commitment ceases to exist, continued confinement\nviolates the substantive liberty interest in freedom from unnecessary restraint.\" Id.\nTwo state supreme courts have gone further in their analysis and concluded that the post-commitment review\nmust be both periodic and judicial in nature. In the landmark case of Fasulo v. Arafeh, 173 Conn. 473, 378 A.2d\n553 (1977), the Supreme Court of Connecticut concluded that reviews of the continued need for confinement\nmust be state-initiated, periodic, and judicial in nature. The court explained that, because the \"state's power to\nconfine terminates when the patient's condition no longer meets the legal standard for commitment\" and because\n\"the state's power to confine is measured by a legal standard, the expiration of the state's power can only be\ndetermined in a judicial proceeding which tests the patient's present mental status against the legal standard for\nconfinement.\" 378 A.2d at 556. That court further explained that,\n\nFreedom from involuntary confinement for those who have committed no crime is the natural state\nof individuals in this country. The burden must be placed on the state to prove the necessity of\nstripping the citizen of one of his most fundamental rights, and the risk of error must rest on the\nstate. Since the state has no greater right to confine a patient after the validity of the original\ncommitment has expired than it does to commit him in the first place, the state must bear the\nburden of proving the necessity of recommitment, just as it bears the burden of proving the\nnecessity for commitment.\nId. at 557. Similarly in In re Harhut, 385 N.W.2d 305, 312-13 (Minn.1986), the Supreme Court of Minnesota held\nthat a commitment statute which provided for indeterminate commitments accorded with due process only if\njudicially construed to require that there be continuous representation by counsel, that statutorily mandated\nannual medical reviews be sent to the committing court and counsel, and that there be judicial review of the\ncommitted patient's status \"at least once every three years.\" The state court explained that, \"without some\nperiodic judicial review of the mentally retarded, there still exists the possibility, no matter how remote, of a\npatient falling through the cracks in the bureaucracy and languishing in a mental institution.\" Id. at 312.\nThere is, of course, binding case law from the Eleventh Circuit which could be read to suggest that the post-\ncommitment review for the involuntarily civilly committed need not be judicial in nature. In Williams v. Wallis, 734\nF.2d 1434 (11th Cir.1984), the appellate court held that those committed to Alabama's mental health system after\nbeing found not guilty of a criminal offense by reason of insanity are not entitled to periodic adversarial release\nproceedings. The court found that the \"probative value of the additional safeguard of adversary hearings is\nslight.\" Id. at 1438. Williams is significantly distinguishable, however. The \"due process balance\" in Williams,\nwhere the person involuntarily committed was an insanity acquittee, is quite different from that which must be\nstruck here, where those confined have committed no crime. As the Eleventh Circuit later explained in Benham v.\nLedbetter, 785 F.2d 1480, 1491 (11th Cir.1986), \"an insanity acquittee as compared with a candidate for civil\ncommitment\" has a \"lessened liberty interest.\" Indeed, because of this difference, the appellate court in Benham\nfound that a presumption of continuing insanity at a commitment hearing for an insanity acquittee did not violate\ndue process. See also Birl I, 619 F.Supp. at 492 (Williams is inapplicable to recommitment of patients discharged\nfrom mental health institutions on trial visits, \"because the procedures used and the interests at stake are so\ndifferent for patients deemed criminally insane and patients who are civilly committed\").\n1516 *1516 Fortunately, although convinced that the law supports post-commitment review that is both periodic and\njudicial in nature for the involuntarily civilly committed, the court need not rest on legal conclusions alone. The\npreviously described case of patient \"L.M.\" 00 who has been involuntarily civilly confined for over 20 years 00 by\n97 97\nitself provides a compelling reason why review which is judicial in nature and reasonably periodic is minimally\nnecessary. L.M. has not been adjudicated as having committed any crime. Nevertheless, she has spent more of\nher life locked away than probably most serious criminal offenders have. The least the state owed her over these\nmany years was a periodic formal hearing, with all the trappings of an initial commitment proceeding, to assure to\na reasonably high degree of certainty that her continued confinement was to her and society's benefit as claimed\nby the state. It cannot reasonably and in good faith be argued that the initial formal commitment hearing she may\nhave received two decades ago 00 or even a decade and half ago in the wake of Lynch 00 could in any way serve\n97 97\nas a basis for such a conclusion. And L.M.'s circumstances and those of similarly situated patients cannot be\ndisregarded as extreme or isolated. Because the involuntary civil commitment of every patient to the Alabama\nMental Health and Mental Retardation System is indefinite, all of them are potentially committed for periods as\nlong as, and even longer than, L.M.'s.\nMoreover, the parties have entered into factual stipulations which solidly reinforce the court's legal conclusion.\nFirst, they agree that under the current procedures 00 which do not provide for post-commitment periodic judicial\n97\nreview 00 there is \"the risk of the continued hospitalization of a person after the purposes of commitment have\n97\n[4]\nbeen accomplished.\"  They have also agreed that periodic judicial review would reduce this risk while at the\nsame time actually advancing the other beneficial interests of the both state and the mentally ill in the\ncommitment process; they agree that such review would better serve to protect the liberty interest of the\ninvoluntarily civilly confined, is medically acceptable, and would otherwise independently serve the interests of\n[5]\nthe mental health system.  With these stipulations, which point in favor of periodic judicial review and in which\n\nthe state has offered no reason why there should not be such review, the due process balance falls decidedly on\nthe side of review that is both periodic and judicial in nature.\nThat the court has struck the proper balance is also supported by a canvas of the involuntary civil commitment\nlaws of other states. Although apparently the norm in the United States at one time, indefinite commitment\nstatutes are now almost extinct. See Procedural Safeguards for Periodic Review: A New Commitment to Mental\nPatient's Rights, 88 Yale L.J. 850 (1979); Developments in the Law 00 Civil Commitment of the Mentally Ill, 87\n97\nHarv. L.Rev. 1190 (1974). Alabama is one of only two states in the United States whose statutes still allow for\ninvoluntary civil commitment with no provision for \"periodic review\" of whether that person, once committed,\n[6]\ncontinues to meet the criteria for commitment. See Brakel, Parry & Weiner, The Mentally Disabled and the Law\n(3d ed. 1985). Indeed, \"[o]ne of the most important changes that has occurred in the commitment laws has been\nthe virtual demise of indeterminate commitment provisions that prevailed in all but a handful of states as recently\nas 1970.\" Id. at 72.\nIII. RELIEF\nThe parties have agreed that, should the court find that the state must hold post-commitment periodic judicial\nreviews, the Martin intervenors' proposal 00 that the reviews use the procedures and standards articulated in both\n97\n1517 the memorandum opinion and judgment in Lynch and that the *1517 reviews be conducted within 150 days of\ninitial commitment and, if the commitment is renewed, annually thereafter 00 should be implemented as the court's\n97\nremedy. The court will accept and follow this agreement. The court will, however, delay implementation of these\nnew requirements for periodic judicial review.\nThe court recognizes that those now in the state's mental health institutions 00 who in some instances may have\n97\nbeen there for 20 years or more 00 have a compelling interest in receiving prompt review of whether they still meet\n97\nthe conditions for commitment. However, the court also shares the parties' concern that setting too short a\nschedule for implementation system-wide could result in hasty and meaningless proceedings. The defendants\nwill have much to do in preparation for the reviews. For these reasons, the court will require that the defendants\nand their attorneys, in consultation with counsel for the plaintiffs and the Martin intervenors, formulate a plan for\ntimely and complete implementation of the new requirements. The court will require that the defendants and their\ncounsel submit the plan to the court within 45 days.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nIn conclusion, the Due Process Clause prohibits the indefinite involuntary civil commitment of the mentally ill\nwithout reference to whether they remain mentally ill and dangerous; once a person who has been civilly\ncommitted no longer meets the criteria for commitment, he or she must be released. And the necessary corollary\nto this conclusion is that there must be some form of post-commitment review to determine whether these\npersons still meet the criteria for commitment. The court is convinced that this review must be judicial in nature\nand reasonably periodic and that the proposal submitted by the Martin intervenors and to which the defendants\nhave agreed satisfies this command.\nFinally, the court would add that the relief it affords today complements, rather than supersedes, all other\noutstanding obligations the court has placed on the defendants 00 in particular, that the defendants must\n97\nimmediately release any patient who \"no longer requires hospitalization in accordance with the standards for\ncommitment,\" Wyatt I, 344 F.Supp. at 386 (standard 33), and that the defendants must \"provide adequate\ntransitional treatment and care for all patients released after a period of involuntary confinement.\" Id. (standard\n34). Moreover, because the relief afforded today is the minimum required by the Due Process Clause, the\ndefendants may always adopt procedures which require even more frequent post-commitment judicial review.\nAn appropriate judgment will be entered.\n\nJUDGMENT\nIn accordance with the memorandum opinion entered, it is the ORDER, JUDGMENT, and DECREE of the court:\n(1) That judgment be and it is hereby entered in favor of the Martin intervenors and against the defendants on the\nMartin intervenors' challenge to the State of Alabama's indeterminate involuntary civil commitment of the mentally\nill pursuant to 1975 Alabama Code §§ 22-52-1 through 22-52-37 (Michie 1990);\n(2) That it be and is hereby DECLARED that the State of Alabama's indeterminate involuntary civil commitment of\nthe mentally ill, without post-commitment periodic judicial review of whether they continue to meet the criteria for\ncommitment, violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution;\nand\n(3) That it be and is hereby DECLARED that the State of Alabama's involuntary commitment of the mentally ill\npursuant to the state's civil commitment statutes shall be subject to the following additional procedures:\n(A) The initial period of involuntary commitment pursuant to the State of Alabama's civil\ncommitment statutes shall not exceed 150 days.\n(B) If the state desires further commitment, the director of the state mental health facility or his\n1518 designee must file a petition for renewal of a commitment *1518 within 30 days prior to the\nexpiration of the initial commitment order. The petition must explain in detail why renewal of\ncommitment is being requested and why less restrictive conditions of treatment are not\nappropriate.\n(C) No renewal of commitment shall exceed a period of one year.\n(D) A patient involuntarily civilly committed shall be released if (a) the director of a state mental\nhealth facility or his designee does not file a petition for renewal of commitment within the time\nprescribed, or (b) a state court denies the petition for renewal, or (c) no state-court order renewing\ncommitment is issued before expiration of the then-current period of authorized commitment.\nIt is further ORDERED that all post-commitment periodic reviews required by the \"additional procedures\" set forth\nin this judgment shall also comport with the procedures and standards articulated in both the memorandum\nopinion and judgment in Lynch v. Baxley, 386 F.Supp. 378 (M.D.Ala.1974) (three-judge court).\nIt is further ORDERED that the defendants and their counsel, after consulting with counsel for plaintiffs and the\nMartin intervenors, shall submit to the court within 45 days a plan for the timely and complete implementation of\nthe \"additional procedures\" set forth in this judgment.\n[1] The Martin intervenors also challenge the constitutionality of the treatment afforded residents at one of the\nstate's facilities, the Thomasville Adult Adjustment Center. This claim has been severed and will be heard by the\ncourt later.\n[2] Section 22-52-10, for example, provides in relevant part as follows: \n(a) If at the final hearing upon a petition seeking to commit a person to the custody of the state department of\nmental health and mental retardation or such other public facility as the court may order, the probate judge, on\nthe basis of clear, unequivocal and convincing evidence, shall find:\n(1) That the person sought to be committed is mentally ill; and\n(2) That as a consequence of the mental illness the person poses a real and present threat of substantial harm to\nhimself or to others; and\n(3) That the threat of substantial harm has been evidenced by a recent overt act; and\n\n(4) That treatment is available for the person's mental illness or that confinement is necessary to prevent the\nperson from causing substantial harm to himself or to others; and\n(5) That commitment is the least restrictive alternative necessary and available for treatment of the person's\nmental illness;\nthen upon such findings, the probate judge shall enter an order setting forth his findings, granting the petition and\nordering the person committed to the custody of the Alabama state department of mental health and mental\nretardation or to such other public facility as the court may order.\n(b) If any such element be unproved, the probate judge shall deny the petition and discharge the subject of the\npetition sine die.\n[3] Parties' stipulation H, filed April 8, 1991.\n[4] Parties' stipulation I, filed on April 8, 1991.\n[5] Parties' stipulations F, G, I, J, K, and L, filed on April 8, 1991.\n[6] Louisiana is the other state whose statutes allow for indeterminate involuntary civil commitment without post-\ncommitment periodic review.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

THOMPSON, Chief Judge.\nOn August 8, 1996, in an order dismissing an appeal of a preliminary injunction from this court as moot, the\nEleventh Circuit Court of Appeals instructed that, \"In seeking to enforce the court's injunctions in this case, the\nplaintiffs have not resorted to the traditional means of enforcing injunctions.\" Wyatt v. Rogers, 92 F.3d 1074, 1078\nn. 8 (11th Cir.1996). The issue now before the court is how to proceed as to the following two motions now under\nsubmission in light of this instruction: the plaintiffs' motion, filed on January 22, 1993, for enforcement of a 1986\nconsent decree, claiming that defendants had failed to comply with the 1986 consent decree and were violating\nthe then recently enacted Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C.A. §§ 12101-12213 (West\nSupp.1995); and the Martin-intervenors' complaint-in-intervention, filed on January 25, 1991, asserting, among\nother things, that the care and conditions at one of the state's facilities, the Thomasville Adult Adjustment Center,\nviolated prior court orders as well as federal statutory and constitutional law.\n\nI.\nThe relevant background is as follows:\n00 On April 13, 1972, this court found that conditions in the facilities operated by Alabama's Department of Mental\n95\nHealth and Mental Retardation violated patients' constitutional rights, and the court entered injunctions requiring\nthe defendant state officials to bring the facilities into compliance with certain minimal constitutional standards. \nWyatt v. Stickney, 344 F.Supp. 373 (M.D.Ala. 1972) (Johnson, J.) (setting standards for the mentally ill), aff'd in\nrelevant part,503 F.2d 1305 (5th Cir.1974); Wyatt v. Stickney, 344 F.Supp. 387 (M.D.Ala.1972) (Johnson, J.)\n(setting standards for the mentally retarded), aff'd in relevant part,503 F.2d 1305 (5th Cir.1974).\n00 In 1986, the parties in Wyatt submitted to the court a proposed consent decree intended to resolve all\n95\noutstanding disputes. After conducting a hearing on the objections to the decree, the court agreed to approve the\nparties' proposal and entered an order and memorandum opinion to that effect. Wyatt v. Wallis, No. 3195-N, 1986\nWL 69194 (M.D.Ala. Sept. 22, 1986).\n520 00 On January 18, 1991, the defendants moved the court for a finding that they had *520 met their obligations\n95\nunder the 1986 consent decree and for an order terminating this litigation.\n00 Also in January 1991, Diane Martin and eleven other patients, now commonly referred to as the \"Martin-\n95\nintervenors,\" filed a complaint-in-intervention asserting, among other things, that the care and conditions at\nThomasville violated prior orders as well as federal statutory and constitutional law.\n00 In the fall of 1991, the court held a trial on the Martin-intervenors' challenge to the care and conditions at\n95\nThomasville, followed by briefing in January and February 1992.\n00 On January 22, 1993, the plaintiffs brought a motion to enforce the 1986 consent decree, claiming that\n95\ndefendants had failed to comply with the 1986 consent decree and were violating the Americans with Disabilities\nAct.\n00 Trial on the following two substantive motions began in the spring of 1995: the defendants' January 18, 1991,\n95\nmotion for a finding that they had met their obligations under the 1986 consent decree and for an order\nterminating this litigation, and the plaintiffs' January 22, 1993, motion to enforce the 1986 consent decree. The\ntrial lasted 35 days, spanning the months of March, April, and May.\n00 On July 11, 1995, in response to the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary relief, the court entered a memorandum\n95\nopinion finding that resident children at the Eufaula Adolescent Center were not safe due to pervasive and severe\nsafety and abuse problems. The court issued a preliminary injunction requiring that the defendants \"take\nimmediate and affirmative steps to provide for the safety and protection from abuse of all resident children at the\n... Center, as required by Wyatt mental-illness standards, 1, 7, and 19.\" Wyatt v. Poundstone, 892 F.Supp. 1410,\n[1]\n1423 (M.D.Ala.1995).  The defendants appealed.\n00 On August 8, 1996, the Eleventh Circuit issued an order dismissing the appeal as moot, but also setting forth in\n95\nsome detail the procedures for obtaining compliance with an injunction. Wyatt v. Rogers, 92 F.3d 1074 (11th\nCir.1996).\nII.\nIn its opinion of August 8, the Eleventh Circuit stated that \"Precedent dictates that a plaintiff seeking to obtain the\ndefendant's compliance with the provisions of an injunctive order move the court to issue an order requiring the\ndefendant to show cause why he should not be held in contempt and sanctioned for his non-compliance.\" 92 F.3d\nat 1078 n. 8. The appellate court concluded that, with their motion for enforcement filed in January 1993 and\ncomplaint-in-intervention for enforcement in 1991, the plaintiffs and the Martin-intervenors \"have not resorted to\nthe traditional means of enforcing injunctions.\" Id.\n\nThe plaintiffs and the Martin-intervenors argue that this court need not heed these instructions from the appellate\ncourt because the issue addressed by the court was not formally before it. This district court cannot agree. First,\nthe Eleventh Circuit relied upon Newman v. State of Alabama, 683 F.2d 1312, 1318 (11th Cir.1982),cert. denied,\n460 U.S. 1083, 103 S.Ct. 1773, 76 L.Ed.2d 346 (1983), which has been on the books for years. This district court\nand the parties simply overlooked it. Second, it is clear that the appellate court was going out of its way to give\ncareful direction to this court as to how to proceed upon dismissal of the appeal, and, what is more important, it\nwas bringing to the court's attention apparent errors that could still be corrected. It would be foolish, therefore,\nand possibly even contemptuous to proceed down a path that the appellate court has expressly, not just\nimpliedly, stated is incorrect. Indeed, the Eleventh Circuit pointedly and repeatedly observed that the plaintiffs'\n521 January 1993 motion and the procedures employed by the court to consider *521 the motion were defective. See \nWyatt, 92 F.3d at 1078 n. 8 (\"In seeking to enforce the court's injunctions in this case, the plaintiffs have not\nresorted to the traditional means of enforcing injunctions described above. Nor has the court issued orders to\nshow cause, calling upon the allegedly recalcitrant defendants to explain why they have not complied with the\ninjunctive provisions in question.\"); id. at 1078 n. 12 (\"on this occasion plaintiffs' motion alleged that the\ndefendants were violating the 1986 consent decree and sought a contempt adjudication and sanctions....\n[H]owever, the motion failed to allege, with specificity sufficient to inform the defendants, which injunctive\nprovisions the defendants were purportedly violating.\"); id. at 1078 n. 13 (\"With respect to the plaintiffs' motion\nthat the defendants be held in contempt for violating the 1986 consent decree, the court did not determine\nwhether the motion was sufficient to warrant the issuance of an order to show cause, ...; rather, the court simply\nscheduled an evidentiary hearing.\").\nThe plaintiffs and the Martin-intervenors contend that this court can still ignore these appellate instructions\nbecause the defect, if any, was harmless and the defendants' objection to how this court has so far conducted\nproceedings comes too late. Again, the court cannot agree. The appellate court observed that, under the\ncontempt procedures it outlined, \"if the plaintiff establishes the defendant's noncompliance with the court's\ninjunctive order and the defendant presents no lawful excuse for his noncompliance, the court usually adjudges\nthe defendant in civil contempt and imposes a sanction that is likely to prompt the defendant's compliance with\nthe injunction.\" 92 F.3d at 1078 n. 8. The court then proceeded to outline the available sanctions. The court stated\nthat \"One sanction might be to incarcerate ... the defendant,\" and \"[a]nother sanction might be to fine the\nrecalcitrant official.\" Id.\nHowever, before either of these sanctions may be imposed against defendants here, this court would have to\nfollow certain procedures 00 procedures that arguably are rooted in constitutional protections. See International\n97\nUnion, UMWA v. Bagwell, 512 U.S. 821, 114 S.Ct. 2552, 129 L.Ed.2d 642 (1994). These procedures, as outlined\nby the Eleventh Circuit, are as follows: \"Precedent dictates that a plaintiff seeking to obtain the defendant's\ncompliance with the provisions of an injunctive order move the court to issue an order requiring the defendant to\nshow cause why he should not be held in contempt and sanctioned for his noncompliance.... In his motion, the\nplaintiff cites the provision(s) of the injunction he wishes to be enforced, alleges that the defendant has not\ncomplied with such provision(s), and asks the court, on the basis of his representation, to order the defendant to\nshow cause why he should not be adjudged in contempt and sanctioned. If the court is satisfied that the plaintiff\nhas made out a case for an order to show cause, it issues the order to show cause. The defendant, following\nreceipt of the order, usually files a response, either confessing his noncompliance or presenting an excuse, or\n`cause,' therefor. The dispute is thereafter resolved at a show cause hearing, with the issues to be decided at the\nhearing framed by the show cause order and the defendant's response.\" Wyatt, 92 F.3d at 1078 n. 8.\nThese procedures have not been followed here. The Eleventh Circuit equated the hearings held before this\ndistrict court 00 on the motion filed by the plaintiffs in 1993 and the complaint-in-intervention filed by the Martin-\n97\nintervenors in 1991 00 to nothing more than \"status conferences.\" The court wrote, \"the hearings that the district\n97\ncourt has convened to consider the plaintiffs' motions for enforcement have amounted for the most part to status\nconferences in which the court is briefed, sometimes through testimony, on the current conditions at DMH/MR\ninstitutions.\" Id. The court even proffered that \"This may account for the court's failure to rule on the plaintiffs'\n1981 motion to ensure compliance with the court's 1972 injunctive orders and, as well, the plaintiffs' 1993 motion,\n... to enforce the consent decree entered in 1986.\" Id. These so-called \"status conferences\" cannot be viewed as\nmeeting the requirements for contempt proceedings.\n\nThe court will therefore deny the plaintiffs' January 1993 motion to the extent they seek enforcement of the 1986\n522 consent decree. The motion will still be considered to the *522 extent the plaintiffs claim that the defendants are\nviolating the Americans with Disabilities Act. The denial will be without prejudice though. If the court should find\nthat the defendants are not entitled to a finding of compliance and to termination of this litigation, the plaintiffs\nmay, if they wish, then pursue contempt proceedings, but as outlined by the Eleventh Circuit.\nSimilarly, the denial of the Martin-intervenors' complaint-in-intervention will be to the extent they seek\nenforcement of prior orders, and not to the extent they claim that the defendants have otherwise violated federal\nlaw. And the denial will be without prejudice, and thus with the result that, if the court should find, based on\nevidence presented in 1991 as well as in 1995, that the defendants are not entitled to a finding of compliance and\nto termination of this litigation as to Thomasville, the Martin-intervenors may, if they wish, then pursue contempt\nproceedings, but again as outlined by the Eleventh Circuit.\nFor above reasons, it is ORDERED as follows:\n(1) The plaintiffs' motion, filed on January 22, 1993, for enforcement of a 1986 consent decree, claiming that the\ndefendants had failed to comply with the 1986 consent decree and were violating the recently enacted Americans\nwith Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C.A. §§ 12101-12213 (West Supp.1995), is denied without prejudice to the\nextent that the plaintiffs seek enforcement of prior court orders.\n(2) The Martin-intervenors' complaint-in-intervention, filed on January 25, 1991, asserting, among other things,\nthat the care and conditions at one of the state's facilities, the Thomasville Adult Adjustment Center, violated prior\ncourt orders as well as federal statutory and constitutional law, is denied without prejudice to the extent that the\nMartin-intervenors seek enforcement of prior court orders.\nIt is further ORDERED that the defendants' motion to dismiss filed on August 14, 1996 (Doc. no. 1424), is denied.\n[1] Doc. nos. 1119-20. The notation \"Doc. no.\" indicates the file docket number given to a document. It is penciled\nin the right-hand bottom corner of a pleading or order and is entered on the docket sheet. Because of the large\nnumber of documents (pleadings and orders) generated almost daily in this case, the court has attempted to\nidentify a document by both its filing or entry date and its docket number. The clerk of the court did not begin\ngiving documents a docket number until November 22, 1993.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

In 1986, the court\napproved a consent decree resolving the parties' continued conflicts over the defendants' compliance with orders\nentered in the early 1970's and the adequacy of the state's funding and administration of the state's mental health\nand retardation facilities. Wyatt v. Wallis, 1986 WL 69194 (M.D.Ala. Sept.22, 1986) (Thompson, J.).\nIn 1991, a new round of litigation began. On January 18, 1991, the defendants moved for a finding that they have\nmet their obligations under the 1986 decree and for an order terminating this lawsuit. On January 22, 1993, the\nplaintiffs moved to enforce the 1986 consent decree and for further relief in light of both the defendants'\ncontinuing failure to comply with the 1986 consent decree and the recently enacted Americans with Disabilities\nAct of 1990, commonly referred to as the \"ADA,\" 42 U.S.C.A. §§ 12101-12213. The court held a hearing on these\nmotions for 35-trial days, spanning over several months, in 1995. The trial was followed by extensive briefing of\nthe parties.\n\nThe hearing was, by agreement of the parties, a `summary proceeding.' To try this case as a normal trial would\nhave taken many months and the parties therefore agreed to try it as a summary proceeding. As a summary\nproceeding, the evidence was submitted in a jointly prepared record before the hearing, and both the defendants'\nand the plaintiffs' live and in-court examination of witnesses was limited to 60 hours of direct and 30 hours of\ncross-examination, with rebuttal testimony limited to two days. The purpose of the live testimony was to highlight\n1361 the most pertinent and relevant parts of the already filed record.[1] Nevertheless, the record *1361 that the court\nhas had to review is comparable to that of a trial lasting many months.\nSubsequent to the trial, on October 8, 1996, the court held that the plaintiffs' failure to follow proper court\nprocedures for obtaining the defendants' compliance with the 1986 consent decree warranted denial of their\nmotion for enforcement except to the extent the plaintiffs seek relief other than under the consent decree. Wyatt\nv. Rogers, 942 F.Supp. 518 (M.D.Ala.1996) (Thompson, J.).\nBased on the hearing and the evidentiary record and for the reasons that follow, the court now concludes that the\ndefendants' motion for a finding that they have met their obligations under the 1986 decree and for an order\nterminating this lawsuit should be granted in part and denied in part, and that the plaintiffs' motion for relief other\nthan under the 1986 consent decree should be denied.\nI. BACKGROUND\nBecause, as will be explained later, the court must determine whether defendants have complied in good faith\nwith the whole of the 1986 consent decree since its entry, it is necessary that the court provide a detailed\nhistorical review of the defendants' past conduct and current attitudes.\nThis longstanding lawsuit began in 1970 when two classes of plaintiffs, former employees at Bryce Hospital and\ncurrent patients, filed a complaint against various officials of the State of Alabama alleging that staff reductions\n[2]\ndeprived patients of their rights under state and federal law.  Since this date there have been four different\nphases of Wyatt litigation.\nA. First Phase of Wyatt Litigation\nIn the 1970's, in expansive and landmark opinions, the court, speaking through Judge Frank M. Johnson, Jr.,\nfound that conditions in the facilities operated by the Alabama Department of Mental Health and Mental\nRetardation violated patients' constitutional rights, and the court entered injunctions requiring the defendants to\nbring the facilities into compliance with certain minimal constitutional standards.\nWYATT STANDARDS ESTABLISHED: Beginning in 1971, the court found that the programs of treatment in use\nfor the mentally ill at Bryce Hospital were \"scientifically and medically inadequate\" and that the treatment \"failed\n[3]\nto conform to any known minimums established for providing treatment for the mentally ill.\" Wyatt v. Stickney,\n325 F.Supp. 781, 784 (M.D.Ala.1971) (Johnson, J.). The court further found that the majority of patients were\ninvoluntarily committed through noncriminal procedures and therefore had an unquestionable constitutional right\n\"to receive such individual treatment as will give each of them a realistic opportunity to be cured or to improve his\nor her mental condition.\" Id. The court, therefore, ordered the defendants to develop and implement within six\nmonths a treatment program to secure these rights. Id. at 785. Nine months later, the court reviewed the\ndefendants' progress in securing these rights. The evidence indicated that the treatment at Bryce Hospital\ncontinued to be \"wholly inadequate.\" Wyatt v. Stickney, 334 F.Supp. 1341, 1344 (M.D.Ala.1971) (Johnson, J.).\nBryce lacked a humane psychological and physical environment, qualified staff in numbers sufficient to\nadminister adequate treatment, and individualized treatment plans. Id. at 1343. As evidence of an inhumane\npsychological and physical environment, the court pointed to the fact that residents lived in barn-like structures\nwith no privacy, they were provided shoddy apparel, and given non-therapeutic work to do. The facility was\n1362 plagued by ventilation problems, fire and safety hazards, and overcrowding. And the *1362 defendants spent only\n50 cents a day on providing food to each resident. As for staffing, Bryce was deficient in all areas. Not only did it\nnot have enough staff, nonprofessional staff was poorly trained. And as to treatment, the records kept on patients\n\nwere less than adequate and the treatment was geared to housekeeping functions only, not to improving the lot\nof the patient. Id. at 1343-44. The defendants were essentially warehousing patients in an inhumane\nenvironment. The court later enlarged the litigation to include patients involuntarily confined for mental treatment\npurposes at Searcy Hospital for the mentally ill and Partlow State School and Hospital for the mentally retarded\nand found that the conditions at these hospitals were no better than those at Bryce. Id. at 1344.\nNoting that the plaintiffs' rights were \"present ones, and they must be not only declared but secured at the earliest\npracticable date,\" the court held a hearing in order to establish minimum standards to be met by these facilities. \nId. at 1344. After that hearing, in 1972, the court entered injunctions requiring the defendants to bring state\nfacilities into compliance with certain minimum constitutional standards. Wyatt v. Stickney, 344 F.Supp. 373\n(M.D.Ala.1972) (standards for mentally ill) (Johnson, J.), aff'd in relevant part,503 F.2d 1305 (5th Cir.1974); \nWyatt v. Stickney, 344 F.Supp. 387 (M.D.Ala. 1972) (standards for mentally retarded) (Johnson, J.), aff'd in\nrelevant part,503 F.2d 1305 (5th Cir.1974). These mental-illness and mental-retardation standards, which were\ndeveloped with the assistance of the parties and experts in the fields of mental health and mental retardation, are\ncommonly known as the `Wyatt standards.' The Wyatt standards were designed to meet what the district court\ncalled the three \"fundamental conditions for adequate and effective treatment,\" Wyatt, 334 F.Supp. at 1343: \"(1) a\nhumane psychological and physical environment, (2) qualified staff in numbers sufficient to administer adequate\ntreatment and (3) individualized treatment plans.\" Id. Over the years, the court has periodically revisited these\nstandards at the parties' request, and has from time to time approved modifications to these standards in order to\nbring them into compliance with evolving professional standards. See, e.g., Wyatt v. Poundstone, 1995 WL\n430939 (M.D.Ala. July 11, 1995) (Thompson, J.); Wyatt v. King, 793 F.Supp. 1058 (M.D.Ala.1992) (Thompson, J.)\n; Wyatt v. Ireland, No. 3195-N, 1979 WL 48254 (M.D.Ala. Oct. 25, 1979) (Johnson, J.); Wyatt v. Hardin, No. 3195\n(M.D. Ala. June 29, 1976) (Johnson, J.).\nWYATT STANDARDS EXTENDED: In 1975, the court extended the Wyatt standards to apply to all state facilities\nfor the mentally ill and mentally retarded. Wyatt v. Hardin, No. 3195-N, 1975 WL 33692 (M.D.Ala. Feb. 28, 1975)\n(Johnson, J.). However, the establishment of the Wyatt standards proved to be only the first step in an extended\nstruggle to secure the rights of mentally ill and mentally retarded residents of Alabama's institutions. And as this\nlitigation continued and the Alabama Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation expanded, the\nlitigation came to encompass a large number of facilities. This lawsuit is unique in its broad scope and all-\nencompassing nature in that it applies to so many facilities and to both the state's mental-illness and mental-\nretardation systems.\nB. Second Phase of Wyatt Litigation\nLITIGATION RESUMES IN 1975: Litigation began again in 1975, when the court allowed the parties to reopen\ndiscovery to determine whether the defendants had complied with the 1972 orders. In 1977, the plaintiffs and\namicus curiae United States of America filed a motion for further relief and requested, among other things, that\nthe court appoint a special master or receiver to assure compliance.\nSYSTEM PLACED IN RECEIVERSHIP AND PLAN OF COMPLIANCE APPROVED: In a separate petition, the\nGovernor of Alabama advised the court that \"the Alabama mental health system is in a distress situation\" and that\nachievement \"of an effective mental health system maintained and operated in the interest of the safety and\nwelfare of the patients and indeed, all of the citizens of this state, require[s] the assertion of the extraordinary\n1363 equitable power of this Court.\" The Governor requested that the *1363 court appoint him receiver of the\nDepartment. The court determined that the defendants had not complied with its injunctive orders and appointed\nthe Governor as receiver of the state mental health system. The Governor proposed a plan of compliance under\nwhich the defendants were to achieve compliance with all Wyatt standards within 18 months, except new\nphysical plant construction or major renovation. The court approved the plan.\nC. Third Phase of Wyatt Litigation\nLITIGATION RESUMES IN 1981: In 1981, the plaintiffs returned to court again to ensure that the Wyatt\nstandards were fully implemented as required by the Governor's compliance plan. The plaintiffs moved for the\n\nprovision of sufficient funds to enable compliance with the 1972 orders and implementation of the Governor's\nplan. The defendants, in response, moved to eliminate all of the Wyatt standards and substitute in their place a\nrequirement that the defendants achieve accreditation of the State's mental illness facilities by the Joint\nCommission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (\"JCAHO\") and certification of the mental\nretardation facilities through Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.A. § 1396, et seq. The defendants\nsought elimination of the Wyatt standards on the grounds that these standards exceeded minimum constitutional\nrequirements. The Governor and the Commissioner of the Alabama Department of Mental Health and Mental\nRetardation also moved for termination of the receivership, and the plaintiffs moved to remove and replace the\nGovernor as receiver.\nIn 1983, the Governor resigned as receiver. The court appointed a non-state official as receiver. Wyatt v. Ireland,\nNo. 3195-N (M.D.Ala. Feb. 1, 1983) (Thompson, J.). The defendants appealed to, and obtained a stay of the\nappointment from, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. In response to the stay, this court appointed the\ngovernor's legal advisor as receiver. Wyatt v. Ireland, No. 3195-N (M.D.Ala. March 8, 1983) (Thompson, J.). Also\nin 1983, the court held a hearing on both the defendants' and plaintiffs' motions but did not rule on them.\n1986 CONSENT DECREE ENTERED: In 1986, the parties submitted to the court their proposed settlement of\nthe litigation. After conducting a fairness hearing on the objections to the consent decree, the court approved the\ndecree, which resolved the parties' continued conflicts over the department's failure to comply with all the Wyatt\nstandards, funding, and other issues. Wyatt, 1986 WL 69194. In general, the final settlement reflected a\nresolution of three issues: (1) the defendants' desire to terminate court supervision of the state system; (2) the\nplaintiffs' concern about the continued viability of the Wyatt standards; and (3) the plaintiffs' efforts to focus the\nlitigation on the provision of community facilities and programs and the placement of qualified patients in those\n[4]\nfacilities and programs.  The final settlement reflected a balancing of these concerns, and the memorandum\nopinion that accompanied the decree further underscored the tradeoffs that had been made by each side in order\nto reach a compromise.\nUnder the terms of the consent decree, the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation was freed from\nactive judicial supervision. The settlement dissolved not only the receivership but the Office of Court Monitor, an\noffice specifically created to monitor on a daily basis the defendants' implementation of the court's orders and\nstandards. The consent decree, however, required several affirmative actions by the defendants. First, it required\nthat all the Wyatt standards \"remain in effect.\" Wyatt, 1986 WL 69194, at *7. And it required that the defendants\nmake substantial progress in achieving and maintaining compliance with all of the Wyatt standards. Id. at **3, 7.\nThe court noted the significance of this provision in its accompanying memorandum opinion. The validity of the \nWyatt standards had been vigorously attacked by the defendants, and a number of court decisions cast doubt on\n1364 whether they would withstand the defendants' challenge. See, e.g., Youngberg*1364v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307,\n102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982); Newman v. Graddick, 740 F.2d 1513 (11th Cir.1984). \"As both the plaintiffs\nand the defendants ... observe[d], the incorporation of these standards into a settlement ma[de] these standards\n... unsusceptible to challenges because of present and future changes in the law. Without question, one of the\nmost significant things bargained away by the defendants in order to secure the plaintiffs' approval of the\nsettlement is the defendants' vigorously asserted and often repeated contention that the court's prior standards\nand orders are always subject to attack because of the present and future changes in the law.\" Wyatt, 1986 WL\n69194, at *4.\nSecond, the decree enjoined the defendants \"to make all reasonable efforts to achieve full accreditation of\nAlabama's mental health facilities by [JCAHO] and full certification of Alabama's mental retardation facilities under\nTitle XIX.\" Id. Thus, under the settlement, the defendants' motions to vacate and substitute the Wyatt standards\nwith JCAHO accreditation and Title XIX certification and the plaintiffs' motions for judicially ordered funding and\nappointment of an independent receiver were denied.\nThird, and \"perhaps most importantly,\" as the court further noted in its discussions of trade-offs between the\nparties, \"the settlement achieve[d] something the plaintiffs were unable to achieve in the past: it substantially\nbroaden[ed] the focus of the litigation to include community placement and require[d] that the defendants make\nsubstantial progress in placing people in the community. Indeed, part of the capital construction program\n\ncontemplated by the settlement include[d] the construction of hundreds of community beds throughout the state.\" \nId. at *5.\nThe settlement provided that, should the defendants fail to comply with the significant provisions in the\nsettlement, the court would entertain requests to reactivate its active supervision of the Mental Health and Mental\nRetardation System. Wyatt, 1986 WL 69194, at *8. Under the settlement, the parties were also ordered to\nestablish a \"patient advocate system, operated within and by the Alabama Department of Mental Health and\nMental Retardation, to help protect the rights of the plaintiff class,\" and a \"quality assurance system operated by\nthe central office of the Alabama Department of Mental Health and Retardation to monitor and assure the quality\nof care provided by the Department.\" Id.\nWYATT CONSULTANT COMMITTEE ESTABLISHED: Paragraph 11 of the consent decree placed on the\nplaintiffs and the defendants the affirmative obligation \"to co-operate\" to establish \"a process\" by which, first,\n\"plaintiffs' counsel will be apprised of the progress made by the defendants\" in meeting the above three\nsubstantive requirements, and, second, \"the defendants will continue to receive input from independent experts\nconcerning means\" of meeting the three requirements. Id. at *8. Paragraph 10 also directed the parties to comply\nwith a number of plans of compliance contained in documents filed with the court. Id. Pursuant to ¶¶ 10 and 11 of\nthe consent decree, the parties established what is now known as the \"Wyatt Consultant Committee.\" Wyatt v.\nHorsley, No. 3195-N (M.D.Ala. Jan.28, 1991) (Thompson, J.).\nThe committee consisted of five members: two appointed by the plaintiffs, two appointed by the department, and\nthe fifth being the Director of Advocacy Services of the Department. The committee worked with the court, the\ndefendants, and the plaintiffs and served three roles. First, it was a direct source of independent, expert advice\nfor the department. It would periodically visit the department and then offer advice as to how the department\ncould better and more swiftly meet its obligations under the orders of the court. Second, the committee was a\ndirect source of information for the plaintiffs' counsel as to how the department was progressing. The committee\npinpointed and explained to plaintiffs' counsel those areas which needed his immediate attention. With the aid of\nthe committee, plaintiffs' counsel, who is not an expert on mental health issues, was better able to meet the\nobligation he had to the plaintiff class to monitor closely the department's efforts to comply with the consent\n1365 decree. Third and finally, the committee *1365 assumed another role which was somewhat of an extension of the\nfirst two: that of the mediator.\nThe department and the plaintiffs did not always agree as to how those problems identified by the committee\nshould be approached and resolved. When this happened, the committee would meet with plaintiffs' counsel and\ndepartment officials and their counsel, sometimes separately and sometimes together, to discuss the problem\nand to attempt to reach some agreement so as to avoid litigation. If this did not work, the committee would then\nmeet with the court, identify what it considered to be a problem, and ask for the court's assistance. The court,\nwith the assistance of the committee, would then arrange for an informal meeting of all those involved: the court,\nplaintiff's counsel, the commissioner (or his representative) and his counsel, and the members of the committee.\nAt these meetings, the court and the commissioner spoke directly to each other rather than through attorneys. Id.\n[5]\nBetween 1987 and 1990, the Wyatt Consultant Committee worked with defendants, their attorneys, plaintiffs'\nattorneys, and the court to attempt to achieve compliance with the 1986 consent decree without resort to\nlitigation. There were regular and extensive meetings. Through this process and with the aid of the committee,\nthe department and the plaintiffs' counsel were able to address effectively a number of continuing and recurring\nproblems. These included: expansion of community facilities and the transfer of mentally ill and mentally retarded\npatients from state institutions to these community facilities; appropriate placement of mentally retarded and\ndually diagnosed patients; improvement of the Quality Assurance System and the Patient Advocacy System;\nrevision of the Wyatt standards; and securing an adequate budget for the department. Id.\nIn the fall of 1990, in a meeting with the court, the Commissioner of the Alabama Department of Mental Health\nand Mental Retardation announced that he and his attorneys were contemplating filing a motion seeking to\nterminate the 1986 consent decree. At that time, the court, the commissioner, counsel for all parties, and the\ncommittee were in the midst of addressing a number of important matters. Indeed, resolution appeared near for\n\nsome of them. For example, the commissioner had presented to the court a novel but very promising solution to\nsome of the urgent problems the department was confronting at one of its institutions, the Eufaula Adolescent\nCenter. Earlier in the year, the committee had reported to plaintiffs' counsel and the court its concern that the\nmajority of the children at the center were not in need of the type of restrictive and isolated environment the\nfacility provides, and that these children could be more appropriately served in a less restrictive program closer to\ntheir homes and families. The committee was also working very closely with the commissioner and plaintiffs'\ncounsel on the department's overall continuing efforts with regard to the expansion of community services and\nfacilities and the transfer of eligible mentally ill and mentally retarded patients from state institutions to these\nfacilities. The committee also had pending before it even more issues which did not involve the court.\nOn November 30, 1990, however, the commissioner, suddenly and without any prior notice00either to the court,\n97\nthe committee members, or plaintiffs' attorneys 00 terminated the services of the Wyatt Consultant Committee. At\n97\nthe time, as stated, several urgent matters were pending before the committee. The commissioner did not allow\nthe committee a period of time to wrap up its affairs. There was no phasing out of the committee. The\ncommissioner stated that he believed that the department had substantially complied with the consent decree\nand that he would be seeking such a determination from the court. More specifically, the commissioner wrote\n1366 each member of the committee *1366 that he was \"of the opinion that there has been substantial compliance with\nthe requirements of the consent decree\" and that he \"will therefore seek a court determination of such\ncompliance.\" He explained that he did \"not feel that the consultant committee approach is necessary any longer.\"\n[6]\nBy order entered on January 28, 1991, the court reinstated the committee albeit only for three months. The court\ngave the following reasons: \"The issue for the court, therefore, is where can it look for an interim `process' to fulfill\nthe requirements of the [1986] consent decree. First, because the commissioner acted so precipitously and failed\nto give advance notice of his intended action, the court has not had sufficient time to seek out alternatives and to\nhave another interim `process' ready for implementation upon the termination of the committee last November.\nThe court, therefore, has only one place to turn: the current committee. Second, the committee is needed on an\ninterim basis to wind up its affairs and provide an orderly transition to any new `process' the parties may develop.\nAn orderly transition could only be beneficial for all involved. The court, therefore, turns to the Wyatt Consultant\nCommittee to fulfill the requirements of paragraph 11 of the consent decree, though only until the parties can\nfulfill their obligation under the same paragraph to `co-operate to establish' the required `process.'\" Wyatt v.\nHorsley, No. 3195-N at 16 (M.D.Ala. Jan.28, 1991) (Thompson, J.). The defendants filed an appeal but later\ndismissed it.\nD. Fourth and Current Phase of Wyatt Litigation\nDEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR COMPLIANCE FINDING AND FOR TERMINATION OF LITIGATION FILED: In\n1991, a new round of litigation began. On January 18, 1991, the defendants moved for a finding that they have\nmet their obligations under the 1986 consent decree and for an order terminating this lawsuit. In order to facilitate\na quick and inexpensive resolution of the lawsuit, the court suggested the appointment of an independent expert.\nThe parties, however, suggested instead the appointment of a two-expert panel, jointly selected by the plaintiffs\nand the defendants in lieu of discovery, to \"investigate and report to the Court and the parties ... [t]he factual\n[7]\nissues pertaining to defendants' compliance with the outstanding orders of the Court.\"  Neither of the experts\nwere sufficiently neutral or independent of the parties to be considered \"court-appointed\" experts, under Federal\nRule of Evidence 706. Nonetheless, the court approved the proposed two-expert panel as \"an agreement\"\nbetween the parties for the orderly and efficient resolution of the defendants' motion. Wyatt v. Horsley, No. 3195-\nN (M.D.Ala. July 2, 1991) (Thompson, J.).\nCLARENCE SUNDRAM APPOINTED: Subsequently, at the request of the parties, the court substituted one\nexpert, Clarence Sundram, for the two-expert panel. Wyatt v. King, No. 3195-N (M.D.Ala. Oct. 25, 1991)\n(Thompson, J.). The court approved Sundram's methodology, and in November 1992, he submitted a report on\nBryce and the Albert P. Brewer Developmental Center as to their compliance with the Wyatt standards.\nSundram's proposed study consisted of three phases: first, to review the system's compliance with court orders;\nsecond, to assess the adequacy and effectiveness of the process used to identify patients and residents who\n\nrequire less restrictive placements; and, third, to assess the adequacy and appropriateness of plans for post-\ninstitutional services for patients and residents who have been discharged from the defendants' facilities. The\nplaintiffs and the defendants both had opportunities to review and comment on drafts of the reports. Sundram's\nreport on Brewer and Bryce found that the department had made significant progress as to certain Wyatt\nstandards. He found that the defendants successfully made substantial efforts to improve the physical\nenvironments of their institutions and hospitals and increased staffing ratios beyond their prior grossly deficient\n1367 levels, thus resulting *1367 in compliance with many standards. Yet, he also found that there remained significant\nproblems and noncompliance as to other critical standards and rights, including treatment and habilitation, safety,\nassuring residents remain free from excessive and unnecessary medication, and, most significantly, unnecessary\n[8]\ninstitutionalization.\nSundram was unable to complete his entire review of the system because the defendants breached their\nagreement regarding Sundram's studies. The defendants hired Warren Bock, another expert, to duplicate\nSundram's review. Bock conducted tours of Bryce and Brewer following Sundram's tours. When Sundram\nlearned of this breach of the agreement, he resigned, believing that he could no longer function as an\nindependent expert as a result of the defendants' actions.\nMARTIN PLAINTIFFS INTERVENE: Also in January 1991, Diane Martin and eleven other patients, now\ncommonly referred to as the `Martin-intervenors,' filed a complaint-in-intervention asserting two claims: first, that\nthe defendants failed to provide adequate procedural protections to ensure that involuntarily civilly-committed\npatients are released once they no longer meet the criteria for commitment established in Lynch v. Baxley, 386\nF.Supp. 378, 387 (M.D.Ala.1974) (three-judge court); and, second, that the care and conditions at one of the\nstate's facilities, the Thomasville Adult Adjustment Center, violated the 1972 orders as well as federal statutory\nand constitutional law. On July 22, 1991, the court found that Alabama's indefinite institutionalization of the\ninvoluntarily civilly committed was unconstitutional and ordered the defendants to conduct periodic post-\n[9]\ncommitment judicial reviews using the standards and safeguards articulated in Lynch. Wyatt v. King, 773\nF.Supp. 1508 (M.D.Ala.1991) (Thompson, J.). At the time, Alabama was one of only two states that allowed for\nindefinite institutionalization. Id. at 1516. The court emphasized that these new procedural safeguards\n\"complement[], rather than supersede[], all other outstanding obligations the court has placed upon the\ndefendants,\" reiterating in particular that the defendants remained under an obligation to \"immediately release\nany patient who `no longer requires hospitalization in accordance with the standards for commitment,' Wyatt [],\n344 F.Supp. at 386 (standard 33), and ... [to] `provide adequate transitional treatment and care for all patients\n[10]\nreleased after a period of involuntary confinement.' Id. (standard 34).\" Wyatt, 773 F.Supp. at 1517.  In a series\n[11]\nof later orders the court adopted plans for implementing the July 22 order.  There was no appeal from these\norders.\nAPPROVAL AND DISAPPROVAL OF MODIFICATIONS TO 1986 CONSENT DECREE: In May 1991, the parties\nsought court approval of two consent decrees that proposed to modify several of the Wyatt standards. Primarily\nbecause of the apparent lack of support for the consent decrees among the state's mental health consumers and\ntheir advocates, the court refused to approve the decrees. Wyatt v. Horsley, 793 F.Supp. 1053 (M.D.Ala.1991)\n(Thompson, J.). The court cautioned the parties as follows: \"The court understands the difficulties class counsel\nfaces in endeavoring to solicit the views of such persons. However, to the extent plaintiffs' counsel cannot receive\ninput from class members, he must seek it from such secondary sources as public interest organizations, former\n1368 mental patients, and family members and caregivers who have *1368 day-to-day contact with class members in\nthe state's institutions. While fulfilling this duty may render the settlement process more complex and problematic,\nit is essential if the class attorney is to persuade the court that an agreement is in the best interests of the class,\nrather than merely expect the court to trust his professional judgment. To allow any less in a class action would\nbe to accept the cynical view that the attorney for the plaintiffs is `the dominus litus,' that is, the true master of the\nlawsuit, and the plaintiffs `only a key to the courthouse door dispensable once entry has been effected.' Saylor v.\nLindsley, 456 F.2d 896, 899 (2nd Cir.1972).\" Id. at 1056. See also Wyatt v. King, No. 3195-N, 1991 WL 365043\n(M.D.Ala. Oct. 28, 1991) (Thompson, J.). In the fall of 1991, the court held a trial on the Martin-intervenors'\nchallenge to the care and conditions at the Thomasville Adult Adjustment Center, followed by briefing in January\nand February 1992.\n\nIn May 1992, the parties submitted, for court approval, three new consent decrees modifying mental-illness\nstandards 7, 9(3), 21, 23, 26-29, 31, and 33. This time the court approved the decrees, noting, among other\nthings, that \"The three new consent decrees currently before the court differ in many respects from those\nsubmitted to the court previously; most importantly, these decrees, unlike the earlier versions, now appear to\nhave the support of a large segment of the mental health community. This is primarily due to the efforts of\ncounsel for the plaintiff class and counsel for defendants to involve the state's primary and secondary consumers,\nconsumer organizations, and advocacy groups ... in the revision of the decrees.\" Wyatt v. King, 793 F.Supp.\n1058, 1062 (M.D.Ala.1992) (Thompson, J.). Mental-illness standards 27, 28, 29, and 33 were deleted or\n[12] [13]\nsuperceded.  The remainder of mental-illness standards007, 9(3), 21, 23, 26, and 3100were modified.\n97 97\nLater, in 1992, the court issued an order and memorandum opinion denying motions filed by the defendants that\nsought modification of the 1986 consent decree by eliminating certain requirements, including several provisions\nin the original 1972 Wyatt standards. Wyatt v. King, 803 F.Supp. 377 (M.D.Ala.1992) (Thompson, J.). The\ndefendants had sought the elimination of the following: the minimum standards which guarantee patients' rights\n[14] [15]\nto privacy, dignity and humane treatment (mental-illness standard 1  and mental-retardation standard 15)\nthe standard that recognizes the right of mentally retarded patients \"to a habilitation program which will maximize\n[16]\nhis human abilities and enhance his ability to cope with his environment (mental-retardation standard 2)  the\nstandards which mandate the delivery of care and services in the least restrictive environment necessary (parts\n[17] [18]\nof mental-illness standards 2, 26, and 28)  and parts of mental-retardation standards 3, 9, and 11  and the\nprovision in the 1986 consent decree that obligates the defendants to make substantial progress in placing\nresidents of state institutions in community facilities and programs. The court held that the requirements for\n[19]\nmodification had not been met. Id. The defendants filed an appeal but later dismissed it.\nThe following January, in 1993, the court entered an order and memorandum opinion denying a motion filed by\n1369 the defendants that sought the elimination of another Wyatt standard, *1369 mental-illness standard 34, which\nobligates them to provide class members with adequate transitional services following release from a state\n[20]\nfacility. Wyatt v. King, 811 F.Supp. 1533 (M.D.Ala.1993) (Thompson, J.). The defendants had alternatively\nrequested that, should the court decline to vacate mental-illness standard 34, the court should clarify that the\ndefendants may fully discharge their obligations under the standard by placing patients in existing programs as\nspace permits, without creating any new programs or services to accommodate patients' needs, and by providing\npost-release care to each patient for a maximum period of one year following the patient's release. The court held\nthat the requirements for modification and clarification had not been met. The court began by noting that, in light\nof the court's 1991 decision00condemning Alabama's indeterminate institutionalization of the involuntarily civilly\n97\ncommitted and mandating periodic judicial review of commitment decisions00\"the defendants now believe that `it\n97\nis no longer possible to continue to hospitalize patients involuntarily on the basis of their clinical needs.'\" Id. at\n1543 (footnote omitted). In other words, \"Deprived of the option to keep patients institutionalized pending the\navailability of appropriate post-release care, the defendants now seek to be relieved of the obligation of Standard\n34.\" Id. The court rejected for several reasons this basis for eliminating Standard 34:\n\"First, the court's 1991 decision did not create any new legal obligation to the extent it stated that\nthe defendants were obligated to release immediately into the community with adequate\ntransitional services those patients who no longer met the criteria for initial commitment; the court\nmerely reaffirmed existing obligations. Included in the 1972 order establishing minimum\nconstitutional standards was Standard 33, which provided that `If the patient no longer requires\nhospitalization in accordance with the standards for commitment ..., he must be released\nimmediately unless he agrees to continue with treatment on a voluntary basis.' It was no accident\nthat, in the sequence of Wyatt standards, this standard immediately preceded Standard 34, which\nrequires that the state provide transitional care for these patients once released. Together, these\ntwo standards established a scheme which was intended to assure that involuntarily confined\npatients who no longer meet the criteria for commitment will not be unnecessarily held in\nconfinement but rather will be immediately released into community settings with adequate\ntransitional services. Moreover, in 1972, this court specifically rejected the suggestion that the lack\nof community facilities would excuse any failure to comply with the Wyatt standards, holding that\n\n`the unavailability of neither funds, nor staff and facilities, will justify a default by defendants in the\nprovision of suitable treatment for the mentally ill.'\n\"The principal import of the 1991 decision, in contrast, is that it established the procedures the\nstate must follow in meeting its obligation under the scheme established by Standards 33 and 34.\nUnder the 1991 decision, the defendants must do the following: conduct periodic post-commitment\njudicial reviews to determine when persons involuntarily confined because of mental illness should\nbe released; conduct these reviews using the standards and safeguards articulated in Lynch; and\nconduct these reviews within 150 days of the initial commitment and, if the commitment is\nrenewed, annually thereafter. The defendants' argument that it was not until the 1991 decision that\nthey had an obligation to release immediately into adequate community settings those patients\nwho no longer meet commitment criteria is completely meritless.\n\"But second and more troubling is the fact that defendants even make this argument. With their\nargument, the defendants implicitly admit that, in order not to comply with Standard 34, they\nconsciously violated Standard 33, with the result that they have essentially ignored both standards\nover the years. Now that the court has brought to an end their noncompliance with Standard 33,\n1370 they seek to be relieved of compliance *1370 with Standard 34 so that they can continue with their\noverall non-compliance with the scheme established under both standards. They seek to bring the\ncourt into complicity with their unexcused failure for over 20 years to comply with both Standards\n33 and 34. In this, the court cannot acquiesce. To the contrary, it is this court's heavy responsibility\nfinally to bring the defendants into immediate and full compliance with both standards.\"\n[21]\nId. at 1543-44 (footnotes omitted) (citations omitted). The defendants filed an appeal but later dismissed it.\nLater, on July 11, 1995, the court approved a proposal by amicus curiae United States to modify mental Wyatt\nmental-retardation standard 22(b) (medication: unnecessary, excessive, review, etc.). Wyatt v. Poundstone, 1995\nWL 430939 (M.D.Ala.1995) (Thompson, J.).\nPLAINTIFFS' MOTION TO ENFORCE FILED: On January 22, 1993, the plaintiffs brought a motion to enforce the\n1986 consent decree, claiming that defendants had failed to comply with the 1986 consent decree and were\nviolating the recently enacted ADA.\nIn 1994, the parties resumed litigation after the collapse of extensive efforts in 1992 and 1993 to enter into an\nagreement to establish formal procedures for settlement of the current round of litigation on the pending\nsubstantive motions00that is, the defendants' January 18, 1991, motion for a finding that they had met their\n97\nobligations under the 1986 consent decree and for an order terminating this litigation, and the plaintiffs' January\n22, 1993, motion to enforce the 1986 consent decree and for further relief. See Wyatt v. Hanan, 871 F.Supp. 415\n(M.D.Ala. 1994) (Thompson, J.) (discussing 1992 and 1993 efforts at settlement).\nTrial on the two substantive motions00the defendants' January 18, 1991, motion for a finding that they had met\n97\ntheir obligations under the 1986 consent decree and for an order terminating this litigation, and the plaintiffs'\nJanuary 22, 1993, motion to enforce the 1986 consent decree and for further relief 00 began in the spring of 1995.\n97\n[22]\nThe trial lasted 35 days, spanning the months of March, April, and May.  The trial was followed by extensive\nbriefing of the parties in July.\nPROBLEMS REVEALED AT EUFAULA ADOLESCENT CENTER: At the beginning of the trial, the court\n[23]\nexpressed concern about violations of the Wyatt standards at the Eufaula Adolescent Center.  The center was\na secure, residential treatment facility located in a remote and rural part of Barbour County, Alabama. It served 55\n[24]\nchildren ages 12 to 18, who had either a mental illness or emotional disturbance.  Formerly a military base, it\nwas comprised of several buildings00two dorms, a recreational and gym area, a school, an administration building\n97\n[25]\nwith professional offices, and a security building. The area was surrounded by a chain link fence.  The\n1371 physical plant of the children's dorms 00 old military style barracks00was *1371 \"Spartan\" and outdated.[26]\n97 97\nFurthermore, its remote location made it difficult for families to visit their children and participate in therapy, and\n[27]\ndifficult to recruit qualified staff.\n\nThe briefs and the evidentiary record filed prior to the trial indicated that there were pervasive and severe safety\nproblems and abuse of resident children at the center. After presenting their evidence on the Eufaula Adolescent\n[28]\nCenter, the plaintiffs filed a motion requesting preliminary injunctive relief as to these safety problems.\nOn July 11, 1995, in response to the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary relief, the court entered a memorandum\nopinion preliminarily finding that resident children at the center were not safe due to pervasive and severe safety\nand abuse problems. This danger was most pronounced in three areas: gang activities; staff abuse; and the\nimproper use of restraint techniques. Wyatt v. Poundstone, 892 F.Supp. 1410 (M.D.Ala.1995) (Thompson, J.).\nThese preliminary findings, which are now made final, were as follows.\nAlthough envisioned as a facility for treatment of mentally ill adolescents in a secure environment, the Eufaula\nAdolescent Center evolved in the 1980s into a \"penal\" facility for \"antisocial adolescent, conduct disorder patients\nwho get in trouble with the law, and are sent to a secure psychiatric facility as a less restrictive alternative to\n[29]\nincarceration.\"  \"The fact that the [center] was a secure facility represented a convenient resource for\ncommitment by probate judges or juvenile judges who were faced with the problems of delinquent youth. The\n[30]\nalternatives were the [center] or a training school.\"  The center was essentially a \"correctional facility\" with a\n[31] [32]\n\"penal atmosphere.\"  Its program was \"punitive\" and \"not nearly so therapeutic as it might have been.\"\n\"There was an excessive reliance on seclusion, a large number of patient injuries, allegations of staff abuse,\n[33]\nprogramming that was overly restrictive and punitive in nature.\"  Therefore, the center's mission was, to speak\nkindly, confusing: in theory, it was a treatment facility; but, in realty, it was essentially a penal institution.\nThis evolution into a penal facility violated the 1986 consent decree in a number of serious ways. First, the\ndefendants abandoned any effort to seek accreditation by JCAHO. As stated, the 1986 consent decree required\nthat the defendants make substantial efforts to achieve JCAHO accreditation at all its psychiatric facilities.\nJCAHO is an independent organization of health care professionals which promulgates national standards for\nhealth care facilities. In order to become accredited, a team of doctors, nurses, and administrators conducts an\n[34]\non-site survey at least every three years.  In October of 1987, the defendants unilaterally chose, instead, to\n[35]\npursue and obtain accreditation by the American Association of Psychiatric Services for Children (AAPSC).\n1372 AAPSC accreditation required \"very little expense or changes in current operation.\"[36] Because the defendants' \n*1372 action was without court approval, it can be characterized only as a conscious violation of the 1986\n[37]\nconsent decree.\nSecond, in 1990, the Wyatt Consultant Committee00an entity which, as stated, was created under the terms of the\n97\n1986 consent decree to both monitor the defendants' progress and to advise the defendants00toured the center.\n97\n[38]\nThe committee found numerous serious violations of the 1986 consent decree and reported back to the court.\n[39]\nThe most disturbing was that most of the children did not belong in the center's restrictive environment.  In\nMay 1990, the committee and the defendants entered into an agreement to end placements at the center. The\ncourt acknowledged this agreement in a letter to the Commissioner of the Department Mental Health and Mental\nRetardation, stating that \"there appears to be a general agreement between the department and the [Wyatt\nConsultant Committee] that the vast majority of the 115 children residing at the Eufaula facility are not in need of\nthe type of restrictive and isolated environment Eufaula currently provides, and that these children could be more\n[40]\nappropriately served in less restrictive, community-based programs, closer to their homes and families.\"  The\ncourt stated that it was agreed \"that the department should develop, by no later than mid-August 1990, a detailed\nplan for providing both a conceptual framework for children's mental health services and an operational plan to\n[41]\ndevelop needed community-based services and to end placements at Eufaula.\"  However, the defendants did\n[42]\nnot comply with this agreement.\nAdmittedly, beginning in the early 1990s, the defendants attempted to improve conditions at the center. First, it\ncommissioned another consultant committee, known as the Vaughan Committee, to review the center and make\nrecommendations. The Vaughan Committee developed a new mission statement regarding admissions,\nprogramming, staff training, and other aspects of the center's program, moving the center back toward treatment\n\n[43]\nand away from its penal dimension.  As a result of these efforts at reform, the center was downsized from\naround 115 beds at its peak to a 60-bed capacity, which was evenly divided between boys and girls ages 12 to\n18, and children admitted to the center must have had either a serious emotional disturbance or mental illness.\n[44]\n The most egregious exclusion practice 00 confinement to building 112, which, as will be shown later,\n97\nresembled solitary confinement in a prison more than therapeutic exclusion in a psychiatric facility 00 ended\n97\n[45]\nbefore trial. Moreover, the center was eventually accredited by JCAHO.  However, it cannot be overlooked that\nthe Vaughan Committee's report and implementation plan did not focus on the needed community-based\nservices intended to end placements at Eufaula, as promised by the defendants, and that it was not until 1991\n1373 and 1992, some four or five years after the 1986 decree, that the defendants began taking the steps necessary \n[46]\n*1373 to upgrade the substandard conditions at the center to meet JCAHO accreditation requirements.\nAt the time of trial in 1995, therefore, the department had changed its admissions criteria and reduced the census\nat the center to approximately 55 children. However, many of these children still did not require institutionalization\nin a locked and secure facility and with the appropriate supports could have been served in communities closer to\n[47]\ntheir families.  Once children were discharged from the center, transitional services and treatment were also\ninadequate. Children were often discharged to their homes, where support services were not always provided.\n[48] [49]\n Very few children had involvement with community mental health centers after discharge.  Thus, the\ncenter did not provide adequate discharge planning or ensure the requisite services were available to children\nonce they were in their communities.\nThird, the evidence reflected that children at the centers were subjected to abuse both physically and mentally. To\nbe sure, the center, because of its nature, had always had somewhat of a dual personality: on the one hand, the\ncenter was a mental-illness facility and, as such, provided treatment to its residents; and, on the other hand,\nbecause its residents also suffered from conduct disorders, it also provided a \"secure environment.\" The critical\nquestion, however, is whether, in spite of these improvements, the facility was still unnecessarily \"penal\" in nature\nand not sufficiently therapeutic, safe, and free from abuse, in violation of the Wyatt standards. The court finds, as\nis shown below, that the defendants failed to correct adequately the safety and abuse problems at the center.\nAs stated, the abuse and unsafe conditions at the center were reflected in three particular areas: (1) gang\nactivity; (2) staff abuse of children; and (3) the use of improper restraint techniques. At the time of trial, gang\nactivity was current and widespread at the center. Many children credibly attested: \"There are gangs here [at the\n[50]\ncenter]. They hit and kick and beat up on kids.\"  \"The gangs are known to jump on kids they don't like and to\n[51]\nhit and punch kids that are not members of their gang.\"  Gang members were sent on \"missions\" where they\n[52]\n\"g[o]t higher ranks for beating other people up.\"  Or the mission may have involved \"males mak[ing] the\n[53]\nfemale do sex acts with them.\"  The gangs created fear in the children at the center. As one child attested,\n[54]\n\"The gangs scare me ... I feel threatened for my physical safety here. This is not a safe place for kids to be.\"\nAnd children joined gangs in order to feel safer and avoid being physically assaulted. As one child stated, \"I\n[55]\njoined a gang because I kept getting hit and I thought once I joined people would leave me alone.\"  In order to\n[56]\nidentify with a gang, a child might tattoo himself or herself with a gang symbol.\nThe gang activity had not only been current and widespread at the time of trial, it had been longstanding and\n1374 within the defendants' *1374 knowledge for some time. Dr. Buzogany, a member of the Vaughan Committee,\ntestified that he and the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation were aware that gang activity\n[57]\nexisted at the center.  Additionally, AAPSC noted in its report of accreditation review and recommendations\n[58]\nthat the center, itself, reported that it had continuing problems with gangs.\nThe defendants failed to address adequately the gang activity at the center. Other than telling children to throw\n[59]\naway gang signs or not wear gang colors, little else was done to eliminate gang activity.  Thus, children did not\nfeel safe and did not feel as though they had any recourse. As one child stated, \"I don't believe any of the staff\n[60]\nput much effort into trying to stop the gangs here.\"  And another expressed similar frustrations: \"The staffs\nknow there are gangs here and that there is gang violence here but they do nothing about it except tell us we\ncannot wear [gang] `colors.' They know a lot of the fights that happen here are because of the gangs but they still\n\ndon't do anything to try to stop the gangs. They just act like the gangs do not exist, but they do. It is not a safe\n[61]\nplace here.\"  At the time of trial in 1995, gang activity was serious and pervasive at the center and posed a\ndirect and continuing threat to the safety of the children who were there.\nThe defendants' reaction at the hearing before the court to the evidence of gang activity was also informative.\nThe defendants accused counsel for the plaintiffs of headline seeking and sensationalism for raising gang\nactivities as a safety violation at the center. And without even conducting a serious investigation of the\n[62]\nallegations, the defendants denied that gang activity constituted a problem at the center.  Only after the court\nhad openly questioned whether the defendants' denial-without-investigation was indicative of how they typically\nreacted to problems at the center, did the defendants conduct a serious inquiry into gang activity at the center.\n1375 [63] In its July 11, 1995, memorandum *1375 opinion, the court wrote that \"it was deeply disappointed that, rather\nthan blanketly denying the allegations without their own investigation, they had not stood up and promised a\npersonal and thorough investigation of their own and that, if the allegations proved true, there was nothing within\nreason the court could order that they would not have already done on their own to remedy the problem\neffectively.\" 892 F.Supp. at 1417.\nThe evidence of pervasive and serious gang activity at the center and the defendants' reaction to the evidence\nled the court to three important inferences: \"First, the defendants' tolerance of the destructive activity is indicative\nof the fact that they view[ed] the activity as natural to the facility and not worthy of any remedial effort, and of the\nfurther fact that they thus still view[ed] the Center as substantially penal rather than therapeutic in nature.\nSecond, unless serious problems are brought out into the open before the court and public, it is likely that the\ndefendants will not address them. And third, absent direct and continuing judicial oversight, it is likely that the\ndefendants will not remedy a serious problem, even though brought out into the open; they will often deny it\nwithout adequate inquiry.\" Id.\nWith regard to staff abuse, the evidence reflected that the administration at Eufaula Adolescent Center did not\nrespond appropriately to evidence and allegations of staff abuse of children. Indeed, the evidence supported the\nconclusion that the center, through inaction as well as action, condoned and allowed continued abuse of children.\nThe center had a large number of abuse and neglect allegations, with an excessive number of children and staff\n[64]\nbeing involved in multiple incidents of abuse and neglect.  During the period from November 1990 to August\n1993, 42 staff members at the center were involved in multiple abuse and neglect investigations, representing a\n[65]\ntotal of 240 incidents.  Five of the center staff were involved in eleven or more abuse and neglect incidents\n[66]\neach.  These numbers indicated that appropriate action was not taken to assure that staff did not abuse their\npositions of control and authority over children, who, of course, were naturally vulnerable.\nSeveral examples are illustrative of this problem. Mr. M. was involved in 13 different investigations from\nSeptember 1992 to January 1993. Shortly after beginning work, he physically abused a child by pushing him\n[67]\nagainst a wall and injuring his head.  The only remedial action taken was verbal counseling and a one-day\n[68]\nsuspension without pay.  Additional complaints were filed against Mr. M. and investigated, six for physical\nabuse and two for verbal abuse. The center found insufficient evidence to determine whether there had been\nphysical abuse in the six physical abuse complaints, and the center found that two instances of verbal abuse had\noccurred. The physical abuse allegations included slamming a boy into a gym door, throwing a boy against a\nsecurity screen and rubbing his face against the window, throwing a boy against his bed, purposefully scraping a\nboy's elbow against a wall, pushing a boy against a wall and verbally threatening him, and throwing a boy against\na wall and twisting his arm behind his back in a choke hold. Additional allegations included allowing one boy to\n[69]\nbeat up another and asking a boy to tattoo him.  During one of the verbal abuse incidents, Mr. M. teased and\n[70]\ntaunted a child, making inappropriate and unprofessional comments concerning a child's mother.  In the other\n1376 instance, Mr. M. called a boy a \"white cracker,\" *1376 a \"pecker head,\" and a \"4-eyed bitch,\" and told the boy,\n[71]\n\"suck my dick.\"  For the verbal abuse, the center sent a reprimand letter for one instance and issued a verbal\nwarning for the other. The center allowed Mr. M. to continue working with children after a substantiated instance\nand multiple allegations of physical abuse and instances of verbal abuse, potentially placing children in danger\nand certainly not providing appropriate care. Not until March 1993, did the center terminate him.\n\nAnother staff member, a mental health worker, had sexual relationships with a child at the center. The\nDepartment's Bureau of Special Investigations found evidence \"sufficient to establish reason to believe and\nprobable cause to believe\" that Mr. H. engaged in sexual intercourse with a 15-year-old girl in a bathroom stall.\n[72]\n Prior to this incident, Mr. H. had been investigated regarding five other incidents of physical abuse and\nsexual misconduct at the center. In fact, Mr. H. had allegedly engaged in \"digital intercourse\" with the same\nwoman on another occasion. A staff member reported this incident to the director of the center, but he failed to\nact or limit Mr. H.'s contact with children despite Mr. H.'s previous extensive record of sexual misconduct and the\n[73]\nfact that the report mentioned that Mr. H. and this girl were planning to have intercourse in the bathroom.\nThe center's director learned of the alleged sexual intercourse in August 1993. In early September, he\ninterviewed the victim and a second child who witnessed the sexual act, and he initiated an investigation by the\nBureau of Special Investigation. The director, however, took no personnel action against Mr. H. until October 30,\nwhen he reassigned Mr. H. to the boys' dorm, and, on November 5, when he placed Mr. H. on mandatory annual\nleave. One week later, he allowed Mr. H. to resign. During the interim, before he reassigned Mr. H. to the boys'\ndorm and then placed him on leave, a resident reported that the alleged victim had been skipping classes to have\nsex with Mr. H.; the mother of a former resident called to report that her daughter had received letters from Mr. H.\nwith inappropriate sexual language; and a staff member reported that Mr. H. was on the telephone with another\n[74]\ngirl arranging to meet her in the bathroom.  Thus, the center allowed a staff member with a history of physical\nand sexual abuse to remain in contact with children while he was the subject of an ongoing investigation for a\nserious allegation of sexually abusing a child. The center did not reassign Mr. H. to the boys' dorm until over two\nmonths after the alleged incident; and even this reassignment did not ensure he would have no contact with girls.\nThis failure to act swiftly, firmly, and adequately, placed children in danger, by exposing them to a high risk of\nsexual and physical abuse. It also sent a message to the children and staff regarding the acceptability of the\ninappropriate sexual conduct at issue.\nEqually disturbing was the defendants' failure to administer to the victim any follow-up counseling specifically\n1377 designed to address this incident. Although her clinical *1377\nrecord reflected that her therapists, in individual and group sessions, addressed this incident, it did not indicate\n[75]\nthat she received any special therapy or additional therapy after the incident was reported.  The court is\n[76]\nfurther disturbed by the center's failure to aid the victim in any manner in pursuing criminal charges.  Once the\ncenter discharged her and she left the center's gates, the center absolved itself of all responsibility for this\nincident as far as the victim was concerned.\nThe court therefore finds that the center did not respond appropriately to serious instances of staff abuse. The\ncourt recognizes that, because of the type of residents it has, the center would probably have had more false\nallegations of abuse than other facilities did, and the court further recognizes that it is impossible to prevent\nabuse from ever occurring at an institution; nevertheless, the number of incidents of abuse at the center was\nunacceptably high.\nThird, with regard to the use of force to restrain children, the evidence reflected that staff improperly used\ndangerous physical force to restrain children at the center. These included: hammerlocks, bending a child's\nthumb back while holding the child in a hammerlock, placing forearms against a child's neck while the child is\n[77]\nagainst a wall, and using knees in a child's back to pin the child on the ground.  Some of the children\n[78]\nsustained welts, scrapes, and bruises as a result of improper restraint practices.  The administration at the\ncenter did not take action to redress such abuse. Although the defendants reported that one staff member who\n[79]\nused improper force to restrain children had been fired,  this was only one staff member and did not address\nthe institutional problem. This would have required training staff to restrain children in a proper way, and not\n[80]\ntolerating the failure to do so. The center had a history of tolerating such abuse.  There are proper and safe\nmethods for restraining even the most volatile individuals and these should have been used. Failure to use\nproven and safe methods should not have been tolerated and should have been firmly addressed.\n\nFourth, Eufaula Adolescent Center failed to create a sufficiently therapeutic environment. Treatment plans at the\n[81]\ncenter did not meet mental-illness standard 26's requirements for individualization.  Treatment plans were not\n1378 individualized, but rather were canned, repeatedly listing in a cursory *1378 fashion the same problems for child\n[82]\nafter child in plan after plan.  Defendants did not provide structured and therapeutic activities for children. The\nabsence of positive planned and structured activities was a deficiency that led to serious behavior problems and\n[83]\nincidents among children and between staff and children.  The center's \"levels system\" was also non-\ntherapeutic and not in compliance with professional standards of treatment. The center operated on a level\n[84]\nsystem and token economy.  This system and its goals, however, were not individualized, but rather generic,\nin violation of professional standards. Further refinements and improvements were needed in this system to\nmake it individualized and to ensure that large numbers of children were not denied therapeutic activities as a\n[85]\nresult of their level.\nFinally, seclusions were used for non-therapeutic purposes. Until just before trial, the defendants would seclude\nchildren in building 112. Seclusion practices in building 112 were more punitive than therapeutic and resembled\nsolitary confinement in a prison more than therapeutic exclusion in a psychiatric facility. Children were placed in a\n[86]\nrow of cells, with no fixtures other than a light, a cement floor, and little-to-no heat or air-conditioning.\n[87]\nConfinement in building 112 ended only in 1994, in the wake of discovery in this case.  While this practice has\nended, its use up to 1994, several years after the defendants filed their motion to terminate the lawsuits, reflects\nthe tension at the center between its \"penal\" and \"therapeutic\" missions.\nThe defendants also improperly secluded children through use of a \"behavior modification unit\" or \"B-mod,\" a\nlocked ward with individual rooms. Children were confined to a room and could not leave. There were no doors\n[88]\non the rooms, but a staff person sat at or near the entrance ensuring the child does not leave.  Defendants,\nhowever, did not consider this to be \"seclusion\" because of the absence of the door on the room. Therefore, there\nwas no clinical oversight, no required recording of confinements, nor any time limits on confinement to B-mod, in\n[89]\nclear violation of the Wyatt standards.  Absence of a door, however, does not eviscerate the requirements for\n[90]\nseclusion and restraint set out in mental-illness standard 7.  A child was still confined to a room on a locked\nward. There was usually nothing in the room, but the frame of a bed, a pillow, and a blanket, if the child brought\n[91]\nthat with him or her. Seclusion in B-mod was a clear violation of standard 7.  B-mod also resulted in a\ndeceptively low number of official seclusions at the facility.\nAs for the monitored and recorded seclusions, the center also failed to comply with mental-illness standard 7.\nThe center failed to meet its own compliance criteria goals in several areas: children were not always given\nbathroom privileges on an hourly basis, they were not offered fluids on an hourly basis, clinical assessments\n1379 were not always completed, nor were physician's orders always signed within the requisite 24-hour *1379 time\n[92]\nperiod.  Furthermore, despite the failure to monitor and report B-mod seclusions, the center's number and\n[93]\nfrequency of exclusions were extremely high and increasing.  While the court recognizes that given the nature\nof the center's residents, its incidents of seclusion may be higher than other facilities, the increasing number of\nseclusions was unacceptably high, especially in light of the failure to even record B-mod exclusions.\nThe evidence therefore reflected that the defendants were in violation of, at least, the following Wyatt mental-\n[94]\nillness standards: 2 and 34 (least restrictive environment and transitional care),  26 (adequate treatment and\n[95] [96]\nindividual habilitation plans),  7 (seclusion and restraint),  and 1 and 19 (safety and freedom from abuse).\n[97]\nThe court issued a preliminary injunction requiring that the defendants \"take immediate and affirmative steps to\nprovide for the safety and protection from abuse of all resident children at the ... Center, as required by Wyatt\nmental-illness standards 1, 7, and 19.\" Wyatt, 892 F.Supp. at 1423. The defendants were required to submit, after\nreceiving and considering input from the plaintiffs and amicus United States of America, two plans to the court:\nfirst, a \"plan containing measures ... to address and resolve immediately the severe and pervasive safety\nproblems and abuse of resident children at the Eufaula Adolescent Center\"; and, second, a \"plan ... providing for\n\nindependent monitoring of the defendants' implementation of the above measures.\" Id. at 1423-24. The court\nfurther required that the defendants \"furnish the following to the parents or guardians of all residents of the\nEufaula Adolescent Center and their attorneys, if any: a copy of this order and preliminary injunction and\naccompanying memorandum opinion, along with a cover letter,\" id. at 1424, explaining \"to the parents, guardians,\nand their attorneys the need for them to monitor the conditions at the Eufaula Adolescent Center by visiting it\npersonally and frequently.\" Id. at 1423.\nIn ordering this relief the court wrote that it \"cannot rely solely on a `promise' by the defendants to implement any\nproposed measures. Throughout the history of this litigation, the defendants have left and continue to leave `a\ntrail of broken promises.' Wyatt, 1986 WL 69194, at *6. A formal court order, incorporating all measures\nnecessary to address the safety problems at the Center, is warranted.\" Wyatt, 892 F.Supp. at 1422. The court\nfurther wrote that, \"the defendants' past conduct teaches that, absent judicial oversight, even a court order is\ninadequate to assure compliance. Only when two circumstances are present does it appear that there can be any\nreasonable assurance of the defendants' immediate and substantial compliance with a court order. The first\ncircumstance is that the defendants' conduct be kept out in the open subject to scrutiny by both the court and the\npublic. The second circumstance is that there be direct pressure from an outside source. For example, only when\nthe issue of gang activity was brought out in the open and the court applied direct pressure, did the defendants\ninitiate an investigation. The court believes that the effects of these two circumstances can be achieved\nprophylactically through a limited measure: the temporary appointment of a monitor.\"\nThe defendants appealed the preliminary injunction order to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. In the\nmeantime, the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation closed the Eufaula Adolescent Center, and\nthis court then stayed the preliminary injunction, finding that \"the need for the preliminary injunction ... is moot.\" \n1380 Wyatt v. Poundstone, 941 F.Supp. 1100, 1109 (M.D.Ala.1996) (Thompson, J.). The court *1380 also informed the\nEleventh Circuit that upon remand of this appeal it would dissolve the preliminary injunction. Id. The Eleventh\nCircuit then dismissed the appeal, Wyatt v. Rogers, 92 F.3d 1074 (11th Cir.1996), and this court dissolved the\n[98]\npreliminary injunction.\nSUMMARY FINDINGS OF PARTIAL COMPLIANCE: During trial and at the invitation of the court, the defendants\nfiled motions requesting the following: a judgment on partial findings, pursuant to Rule 52(c) of the Federal Rules\nof Civil Procedure, as to mental-illness standards 3 (no incompetency by reason of commitment), 5 (send/receive\nmail), 8 (experimental research), 9 (lobotomy/averse conditioning, etc.), 11 (wear own clothes; keep\npossessions), 13 (laundering of clothes), 17 (interaction with members of opposite sex), 18 (patient labor, etc.),\n21 (staff licensing and certification requirements), and 25 (patient exams following admission); a judgment on\npartial findings, pursuant to Rule 52(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as to mental-retardation standards\n8 (evaluation within 14 days of admission), 17 (no incompetency by reason of commitment), 18 (religion), 19\n(telephone/visitation rights), 20 (send/receive mail), 21 (interaction with opposite sex), 23 (no seclusion; \"time-\nout\" ok), 24 (behavior modification only with consent), 25 (electric shock only for extraordinary circumstances), 29\n(no experimental treatment without consent), 30 (no unusual or hazardous treatment without consent), 32\n(outdoors at regular intervals), 33 (resident labor, etc.), 42 (written copy of standards upon admission), and 45\n(no organ removal); and a finding of compliance with ¶ 8 of the 1986 consent decree, which required the\ndefendants \"to make all reasonable efforts to achieve full accreditation of Alabama's mental health facilities by the\n[JCAHO] and full certification of Alabama's mental retardation facilities under Title XIX ... 00 and once attained, to\n97\ncontinue to maintain such accreditation and certification.\" Wyatt, 1986 WL 69194, at *7 (¶ 8).\nThe court granted the defendants' motions for partial finding as to all but mental-retardation standard 42. Wyatt v.\nPoundstone, No. 3195-N, 1995 WL 569121 (M.D.Ala. April 18, 1995) (Thompson, J.); Wyatt v. Poundstone, No.\n3195-N, 1995 WL 938444 (M.D.Ala. Dec. 5, 1995) (Thompson, J.). The court also granted the defendants' motion\n[99]\nfor a finding of compliance with ¶ 8 of the consent decree as to all facilities.  While the court readily found ¶ 8\ncompliance with all facilities except the Eufaula Adolescent Center, the court wrote that it \"finds that the\nDepartment achieved full accreditation of the Eufaula Adolescent Center as of May 1994, and that the\nDepartment has so far maintained such accreditation,\" but that, \"between 1986 and late 1991, the defendants did\n[100]\nnot take `all reasonable efforts' to obtain accreditation.\"  The court explained:\n\"The 1986 Consent Decree entered on September 22, 1986 stated:\n\n`By agreement of the parties, the defendants are hereby ENJOINED to make all reasonable\nefforts to achieve full accreditation of Alabama's mental health facilities by the Joint Commission\non the Accreditation of Hospitals [JCAHO] ... and once attained, to continue to maintain such\naccreditation.'\nThis meant that beginning on September 22, 1986, the defendants were to begin taking all\nreasonable steps to obtain accreditation. The defendants did not, however, begin to make all\nreasonable efforts to obtain accreditation as of this date. The defendants contend that they did not\npursue accreditation because of confusion over which of several manuals JCAHO would use to\nsurvey the facility. The defendants made one inquiry to the JCAHO on September 15, 1987. After\na response from JCAHO on September 30, 1987, indicating that Eufaula should probably be\nsurveyed under one manual, but that the defendants should review one other manual as well, the\ndefendants did not pursue accreditation nor attempt to clear up the confusion over which manual\n1381 JCAHO would use. Instead, in October of 1987, the defendants *1381 unilaterally chose to pursue\nand obtain accreditation by [AAPSC]. AAPSC accreditation would require \"very little expense or\nchanges in current operation.\" While the Wyatt Committee encouraged Eufaula to seek AAPSC\naccreditation, the Wyatt Committee did not accept AAPSC accreditation as a substitute for JCAHO\naccreditation. If the defendants believed that the AAPSC was an adequate substitute, they should\nhave sought the court's permission to substitute this accreditation for JCAHO accreditation. They\ndid not do so however. Indeed, the court finds that they chose accreditation by an agency that\nwould require little change or expense. \"Additionally, the defendants contend that they did not\nseek accreditation because they were not sure whether or not the court would require them to\nclose the facility. If the defendants decided to `delay' their effort pending such a decision, they\nshould have either gained the plaintiffs' consent or sought approval from the court. \"Finally, the\nevidence reflects that not until 1991 and 1992 did the defendants begin taking the steps\nnecessary to upgrade the substandard conditions at Eufaula to meet JCAHO accreditation\nrequirements. The defendants have not offered any credible reasons for not beginning this\nprocess in 1986 or, for the reasons given above, as early as 1987.\"\nPLAINTIFF CLASS RECERTIFIED: On December 22, 1994, in the midst of heated and extensive preparations\n[101]\nfor trial by the parties and the court, the defendants filed a motion to recertify or modify the plaintiff class.\nThey requested that the court do the following: appoint new class representatives and new class counsel;\nexplicitly state who is in the class; clarify whether this class action is pursuant to subsection(b)(2) or (b)(3) of Rule\n23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; permit members of the plaintiff class to opt out of the class pursuant\nto subsection (b)(3) of the rule if they wish; and issue notice to class members pursuant to subsection (d)(2) of\nthe rule. On January 18, 1995, after over 24 years of litigation, the defendants filed a supplemental motion adding\n[102]\nan alternative request to decertify the plaintiff class.  The defendants argued that the class should be\ndecertified because there had never been a formal order of certification, because the former named plaintiffs'\nclaims were moot, and because of a conflict of interest within the plaintiff class.\nAfter trial and while the appeal regarding Eufaula Adolescent Center was pending, the court refused to decertify\nthe plaintiff class and, instead, allowed additional plaintiffs to intervene and recertified \"A plaintiff class consisting\nof all current and future mentally-retarded and mentally-ill residents of any facility, hospital, center, or home,\npublic or private, to which they are assigned or transferred for residence by the Alabama Department of Mental\nHealth and Mental Retardation, ... pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a) & (b)(2).\" Wyatt v. Poundstone, 169 F.R.D. 155\n(M.D.Ala.1995) (Thompson, J.).\nIn recertifying the plaintiff class, the court rejected the defendants' contention that the class should be\nimmediately decertified because of a conflict of interest within the plaintiff class between those who advocate\ncommunity placement of residents and those who oppose it. It appeared that any conflict within the plaintiff class\nresulted, at least in large part, from misinformation disseminated by the defendants. The defendants had sent\nletters to class members, their guardians, caregivers, and next-of-kin informing them that the plaintiffs and their\nattorneys were seeking to have services for all class members reduced and full deinstitutionalization of the\nmentally-retarded, that is, to have all mentally-retarded class members now residing in the defendants'\n\ndevelopmental centers moved into the community. The defendants failed to state in their letters that the plaintiffs\nadvocate that the defendants be required to develop more extensive and greater community services and that\ninstitutionalized residents be given the choice between institutionalization and community placement. With this\n1382 omission, the defendants left the important misimpression that the plaintiffs *1382 seek to close the state's\nfacilities and force patients out without any support services.\nThe defendants sent a letter to guardians of mentally-retarded residents in the state's developmental centers\nstating:\n\"This letter shall serve as notice that the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation is\ncurrently involved in a lawsuit involving your ward, [name], at the [name] Developmental Center.\nThe plaintiffs' attorneys in this lawsuit claim to represent your ward. One of the Plaintiffs'\nobjectives in this case is to close the state's mental retardation facilities, including [name]\n[103]\nDevelopmental Center.\"\nThe defendants failed to add that the plaintiffs advocate the development of more extensive and greater\ncommunity services and want to give institutionalized residents the choice, where appropriate, between\ninstitutionalization and community placement. Other letters were sent to family members and guardians of class\nmembers, including the mentally-ill patients, stating:\n\"This letter shall serve as notice that the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation is\ncurrently involved in a lawsuit involving your ward/relative at [name of institution]. The Plaintiffs'\nattorneys in this lawsuit claim to represent your ward/relative as counsel for the Plaintiff's class\nmembers. One of the Plaintiffs' objectives in this case is to substantially reduce the state's mental\n[104]\nhealth facilities.\"\nAgain, with their omission, the defendants presented a false picture of the plaintiffs' position in this litigation.\nThese letters went on to state that the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation was objecting to\nproducing class members' records to plaintiffs' attorneys and encouraged the guardian or family member to\ncontact the department if he or she objected to counsel having access to their ward's records. These letters were\nsent to guardians after the court had specifically cautioned the defendants not to \"encourage\" plaintiffs and their\nguardians to object to producing the class members' records without explicit approval of the district\n[105]\ncourt00approval which was not obtained.  Also, some of the letters implied (with a space provided for approval\n97\nor disapproval of the release of information to plaintiffs' counsel) that guardian-or-parent approval was necessary\n[106]\nto release of the information, despite the fact that mental-illness standard 31  expressly gives to plaintiffs'\ncounsel and their agents, in the same manner that it gives to employees of the Department of Mental Health and\n[107]\nMental Retardation, the right to full access to patients' records.\nDENIAL, IN PART, OF PLAINTIFFS' MOTION TO ENFORCE: Finally, in the wake of the dismissal of the appeal,\nthe court entered an order on October 8, 1996, denying plaintiffs' motion for enforcement except to the extent\nthey seek relief other than under the 1986 consent decree. Wyatt v. Rogers, 942 F.Supp. 518 (M.D.Ala.1996)\n(Thompson, J.). The court reasoned that \"In its opinion of August 8, the Eleventh Circuit stated that `Precedent\ndictates that a plaintiff seeking to obtain the defendant's compliance with the provisions of an injunctive order\nmove the court to issue an order requiring the defendant to show cause why he should not be held in contempt\nand sanctioned for his noncompliance.' 92 F.3d at 1078 n. 8. The appellate court concluded that, with their motion\nfor enforcement filed in January 1993 ..., the plaintiffs ... `have not resorted to the traditional means of enforcing\ninjunctions.' Id.\" Wyatt, 942 F.Supp. at 520. The court also denied, for these same reasons, the Martin-\nintervenors' complaint-in-intervention, filed on January 25, 199100asserting, among other things, that the care and\n97\n1383 conditions at one of the state's facilities, the Thomasville *1383 Adult Adjustment Center, violated prior court\norders as well as federal statutory and constitutional law00to the extent that the Martin-intervenors seek\n97\nenforcement of prior court orders. Id.\nAgainst this background, the court now turns to the two substantive motions now before it: the defendants' motion\nfor a finding that they have met their obligations under the 1986 decree and for an order terminating this lawsuit;\nand the plaintiffs' motion to the extent they seek relief other than under the 1986 consent decree.\n\nII. DEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR FINDING THAT THEY HAVE MET\nTHEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE 1986 CONSENT DECREE AND FOR\nTERMINATION OF LITIGATION\nIn considering the defendants' motion for a finding that they have met their obligations under the 1986 consent\ndecree and for an order terminating this lawsuit, the court will first address what legal principles should be\napplied. The court will then make its findings of compliance or noncompliance in light of these principles. And,\nfinally, the court will conclude with its holding as to whether there should be full or incremental release and\nwhether this litigation should be terminated.\nA. Governing Legal Principles\nIn 1991, in Board of Educ. of Oklahoma City Public Schools v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 111 S.Ct. 630, 112 L.Ed.2d\n715, the Supreme Court addressed explicitly when it is appropriate for a federal court to dissolve a school\ndesegregation decree and terminate litigation. The Court reaffirmed the important principle that a decree may not\nbe dissolved \"if the purposes of the litigation as incorporated in the decree ... have not been fully achieved.\" 498\nU.S. at 247, 111 S.Ct. at 636 (quoting United States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 391 U.S. 244, 248, 88 S.Ct.\n1496, 1499, 20 L.Ed.2d 562 (1968)). In other words, there must be a showing of full and satisfactory compliance\nwith the basic purposes and provisions of the decree before it may be terminated. The Court, however, made\nclear that school desegregation decrees must be viewed as only \"temporary measure[s],\" id. at 247, 111 S.Ct. at\n637; \"[s]uch decrees ... are not intended to operate in perpetuity.\" Id. at 248, 111 S.Ct. at 637. Two limitations,\ninherent in the jurisprudence of federal courts, warranted this conclusion: the first limitation is inherent in the\nnature of the equitable authority of federal courts to fashion appropriate relief; and the second limitation derives\nfrom our dual system of federal and state governments.\nAs to the first limitation, the Court wrote: \"`[F]ederal-court decrees must directly address and relate to the\nconstitutional violation itself. Because of this inherent limitation upon federal judicial authority, federal-court\ndecrees exceed appropriate limits if they are aimed at eliminating a condition that does not violate the\nConstitution or does not flow from such a violation.'\" Id. at 247, 111 S.Ct. at 637 (quoting Milliken v. Bradley, 433\nU.S. 267, 282, 97 S.Ct. 2749, 2758, 53 L.Ed.2d 745 (1977)). With regard to the second limitation, the Court\nexplained: \"Dissolving a desegregation decree after the local authorities have operated in compliance with it for a\nreasonable period of time properly recognizes that `necessary concern for the important values of local control of\npublic school systems dictates that a federal court's regulatory control of such systems not extend beyond the\ntime required to remedy the effects of past intentional discrimination.'\" Id. at 248, 111 S.Ct. at 637 (quoting \nSpangler v. Pasadena City Bd. of Educ., 611 F.2d 1239, 1245 n.5 (9th Cir.1979) (Kennedy, J., concurring)). \"From\nthe very first,\" therefore, \"federal supervision of local school systems was intended as a temporary measure to\nremedy past discrimination.\" Id. at 247, 111 S.Ct. at 637 (emphasis added.)\nBased on these principles, the Supreme Court then articulated two overarching considerations that must inform a\ntrial court's determination of when \"the purposes of the litigation as incorporated in the decree ... have ... been\nfully achieved.\" Id. at 247, 111 S.Ct. at 636 (quoting United Shoe Machinery Corp., 391 U.S. at 248, 88 S.Ct. at\n1499). The first is whether the vestiges of past discrimination have been eliminated to the extent practicable. Id.\n1384 at 249-50, 111 S.Ct. at 638. The second is whether the school board has complied in good faith with *1384 the\ndesegregation decree as a whole since it was entered. Id. The trial court must be satisfied that \"it is unlikely that\nthe school board would return to its former ways,\" id. at 247, 111 S.Ct. at 636-37, and thus that the constitutional\nviolation will not be promptly repeated once the decree is lifted. The trial court \"need not accept at face value the\nprofession of a school board which has intentionally discriminated that it will cease to do so in the future.\" Id. at\n249, 111 S.Ct. at 637. Rather, a school board's past record and present attitudes towards the reforms mandated\nin the decree are highly relevant to this inquiry. Id. at 249, 111 S.Ct. at 637. Good faith, therefore, is generally\nbest demonstrated by compliance with the basic provisions and purposes of the decree for a reasonable period\nof time.\n\nA year later, in 1992, in Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 112 S.Ct. 1430, 118 L.Ed.2d 108, the Supreme Court\naddressed whether and when it is appropriate for a federal court to relinquish supervision and control over a\nschool district in incremental stages before there has been full compliance in every area of school operation\nunder an existing court decree. The Court held that, \"A federal court in a school desegregation case has the\ndiscretion to order an incremental or partial withdrawal of its supervision and control.\" 503 U.S. at 489, 112 S.Ct.\nat 1444-45. The Court modified the considerations announced in Dowell. These considerations, as modified, are,\nfirst, \"whether there has been full and satisfactory compliance with the decree in those aspects of the system\nwhere supervision is to be withdrawn,\" id. at 491, 112 S.Ct. at 1446, and, second, \"whether retention of judicial\ncontrol is necessary or practicable to achieve compliance with the decree in other facets of the school system.\" \nId. As to the second consideration, the Court explained that aspects of the decree may be so \"intertwined or\nsynergistic in their relation ... that a constitutional violation in one area cannot be eliminated unless the judicial\nremedy addresses other matters as well.\" Id. at 497, 112 S.Ct. at 1449. The third and last consideration,\naccording to the Court, is essentially the same good-faith consideration announced in Dowell: \"whether the\nschool district has demonstrated, to the public and to the parents and students of the once disfavored race, its\ngood-faith commitment to the whole of the court's decree and to those provisions of the law and the Constitution\nthat were the predicate for judicial intervention in the first instance.\" Id. at 491, 112 S.Ct. at 1446. The Court\nagain emphasized that, in \"considering these factors, a court should give particular attention to the school\nsystem's record of compliance.\" Id. \"A school system is better positioned to demonstrate its good-faith\ncommitment to a constitutional course of action when its policies form a consistent pattern of lawful conduct\ndirected to eliminating earlier violations.\" Id. See also Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 88-89, 115 S.Ct. 2038,\n2049, 132 L.Ed.2d 63 (1995) (reaffirming considerations articulated in Freeman).\nThe Court in Freeman reasoned, as it did in Dowell, that the remedial authority of federal courts is limited by the\nprinciple \"that `judicial powers may be exercised only on the basis of a constitutional violation,' and that `the\nnature of the violation determines the scope of the remedy.'\" Freeman, 503 U.S. at 489, 112 S.Ct. at 1445\n(quoting Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. 1, 16, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1276, 28 L.Ed.2d 554\n(1971)). \"A remedy is justifiable only insofar as it advances the ultimate objective of alleviating the initial\nconstitutional violation.\" Id. at 489, 112 S.Ct. at 1445. The Court then reemphasized that these remedial\nprinciples take on special import when they implicate federal-state relations, observing that \"the court's end\npurpose must be to remedy the violation and, in addition, to restore state and local authorities to the control of a\nschool system that is operating in compliance with the Constitution.\" Id. (emphasis added.) \"[T]he federal courts\nin devising a remedy must take into account the interests of state and local authorities in managing their own\naffairs, consistent with the Constitution.\" Id. (quoting Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 280-81, 97 S.Ct. 2749,\n2757-58, 53 L.Ed.2d 745 (1977)). The Court concluded that, \"Partial relinquishment of judicial control, where\n1385 justified by the facts of the case, can be an important and significant step in fulfilling the district *1385 court's duty\nto return the operations and control of schools to local authorities.\" Id. Moreover, \"By withdrawing control over\nareas where judicial supervision is no longer needed, a district court can concentrate both its own resources and\nthose of the school district on the areas where the effects of de jure discrimination have not been eliminated and\nfurther action is necessary in order to provide real and tangible relief to minority students.\" Id. at 493, 112 S.Ct. at\n1447.\nWhile the decisions in Dowell and Freeman specifically concerned school desegregation decrees, the reasoning\nbehind those decisions was based on limiting principles of equitable relief and federalism which govern federal\ncourts in general. See Swann, 402 U.S. at 15-16, 91 S.Ct. at 1275-76 (\"a school desegregation case does not\ndiffer fundamentally from other cases involving the framing of equitable remedies to repair the denial of a\nconstitutional right. The task is to correct, by a balancing of the individual and collective interests, the condition\nthat offends the Constitution.\"). Therefore, these limiting principles 00that a remedy is justifiable only insofar as it\n97\nadvances the ultimate objective of alleviating the initial constitutional violation, and that the control of a state\ninstitution that is operating in good-faith compliance with a court decree must be restored to state authorities\n00apply with equal force to federal court decrees governing other state institutions, including mental-health\n97\ninstitutions. See United States v. Miami, 2 F.3d 1497, 1505, 1508 (11th Cir.1993) (applying Dowell standard to\nconsent decree entered to redress discrimination in city fire department); United States v. City of Montgomery,\n948 F.Supp. 1553 (M.D.Ala.1996) (Thompson, J.) (terminating, based on considerations articulated in Freeman,\ndecrees redressing race and sex discrimination in city police department); Jordan v. Wilson, 951 F.Supp. 1571\n\n(M.D.Ala.1996) (Thompson, J.) (longstanding sex discrimination lawsuit against city police department terminated\nbased on considerations articulated in Freeman). This court will therefore apply these principles, and the\nconsiderations derived from these principles, to the defendants' motion for a finding that they have met their\nobligations under the 1986 consent decree and for an order terminating this lawsuit.\nThe considerations, reformulated to apply in general to state institutions that are subject to detailed remedial\ndecrees, are as follows. A federal court may, in its discretion, dissolve a decree in full and terminate the litigation\nif it finds such dissolution is appropriate in light of the following two considerations: first, whether the conditions\nthat gave rise to the need for the litigation have been fully remedied, and, second, whether the state defendants\nhave complied in good faith with the decree as a whole since it was entered. A court, in its discretion, may order\nan incremental or partial release from a decree if it finds such action is appropriate in light of the following\nconsiderations: first, whether there has been full and satisfactory compliance with the decree in those aspects of\nthe system where supervision is to be withdrawn; second, whether retention of judicial control in those aspects of\nthe system is not necessary or practicable to achieve compliance with the decree in other facets of the system;\nand, third, whether the state defendants have demonstrated their good-faith commitment to the whole of the\ncourt's decree and to those provisions of the law and the Constitution that were the predicate for judicial\nintervention in the first instance.\nIn considering whether to order full, partial, or no release, a court should give particular attention to the state\ndefendants' record of compliance. State defendants are better positioned to demonstrate their good-faith\ncommitment to the decree when their policies and actions form a consistent pattern of lawful conduct in\ncompliance with the decree.\nHowever, while the principles reaffirmed, and the considerations articulated, in Dowell and Freeman are binding\non this court, they are still essentially general notions. Other than noting that the burden of establishing that court\nsupervision is no longer needed rests with defendant state officials, Freeman, 503 U.S. at 490-91, 112 S.Ct. at\n1445-46 (indicating that the school board must \"demonstrate its good-faith commitment\" before judicial control\n1386 may be relinquished), *1386 and that whether there has been good-faith compliance is a subject for a specific\nfactual finding by the trial court, id. at 498, 112 S.Ct. at 1449, the two decisions do not provide details, outside the\ncontext of school desegregation, as to how a court should go about determining when, in fact, there has been\ncompliance with a court decree and when that compliance rises to the level of a demonstration of good faith.\nFirst and obviously, good-faith compliance with most of the provisions of the 1986 consent decree, and thus with\nthe decree as a whole, cannot be determined with mathematical certainty. The question for the court, therefore, is\nthe proper standard for determining whether the state defendants have or have not complied with the provisions\nof the decree. While Dowell and Freeman offer little to assist the court in approaching this question, another\nSupreme Court decision, rendered ten years earlier, does. In Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct.\n2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982), the Supreme Court addressed whether an involuntarily committed person has a\nconstitutionally protected liberty interest under the due-process clause of the fourteenth amendment to\nreasonably safe conditions of confinement and to freedom from unreasonable bodily restraints, and, if so, what\nthe proper standard for determining whether a state has adequately protected these interests is. After answering\nyes to the first issue, the Court stated the resolution of the second issue00the proper-standard issue00must be\n97 97\n\"determined by balancing [the committed person's] liberty interest against the relevant state interest.\" 457 U.S. at\n321, 102 S.Ct. at 2461. The Court then answered the second question as follows: \"`the Constitution only requires\nthat the courts make certain that professional judgment in fact was exercised. It is not appropriate for the courts\nto specify which of several professionally acceptable choices should have been made.'\" Id. at 321, 102 S.Ct. at\n2461 (quoting Romeo v. Youngberg, 644 F.2d 147, 178 (3rd Cir.1980) (Seitz, J, concurring)).\nThe Court then explained: \"By so limiting judicial review of challenges to conditions in state institutions,\ninterference by the federal judiciary with the internal operations of these institutions should be minimized.\nMoreover, there certainly is no reason to think judges or juries are better qualified than appropriate professionals\nin making such decisions.\" Id. at 322-23, 102 S.Ct. at 2461-62. The Court then concluded that, \"[f]or these\nreasons, the decision, if made by a professional, is presumptively valid; liability may be imposed only when the\ndecision by the professional is such a substantial departure from accepted professional judgment, practice, or\n\nstandards as to demonstrate that the person responsible actually did not base the decision on such a judgment.\" \nId. at 323, 102 S.Ct. at 2462.\nHere, admittedly, the responsibility of this court is to secure the defendants' swift and full compliance with the\n1986 consent decree. Nevertheless, as would be the case with a court seeking to vindicate the liberty interests\nidentified in Youngberg, this court is still an interloper, for the ultimate responsibility for the operation of the\nAlabama Mental Health and Mental Retardation System still lies with the State of Alabama. Therefore,\ninterference by this court \"with the internal operations of [the Alabama Department of Mental Health and Mental\nRetardation] should be minimized,\" id. at 322, 102 S.Ct. at 2461, to that necessary to vindicate compliance with\nthe decree. Similarly, because \"there certainly is no reason to think [this] judge[] ... [is] better qualified than\nappropriate professionals in making ... decisions\" in the Alabama system calling for professional judgment, id. at\n323, 102 S.Ct. at 2462, a \"decision, if made by a professional, [should be] presumptively valid.\" Id.\nTherefore, in determining whether the defendants have complied with the 1986 decree00and, in particular with\n97\neach of the Wyatt standards to the extent the standard calls for professional judgment00the role of this court is to\n97\nmake certain that professional judgment was, in fact, exercised. It is not appropriate for the court to specify which\nof several professionally acceptable choices should have been made. The court should, however, be careful not\n1387 to apply an `anything goes' view. In other words, the mere presence of conflict in expert testimony does not *1387\nmean that professional judgment was used, nor does it mean that professional judgment was not used.\nIn addition, of course, a decision is entitled to such deference only if it is one that calls for professional judgment.\nFor example, whether a patient should be placed in a community setting would be a decision that would call for\nprofessional judgment, and the court should not second guess such a decision as long as it was based on\nacceptable professional judgment. However, whether the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation\nhas met its obligation to create community facilities would not turn exclusively on professional judgment. The\nbottom line is that, in those instances where professionals have determined that a patient could or should be in a\ncommunity setting, the decree requires that, within practical administrative and budgetary limits, the department\nhave such settings available, and the court's limited role under the consent decree is to make sure that this is so.\nThe force of the 1986 consent decree is that, if a state professional finds that a patient could or should be in a\nlocal community facility, the patient should not he hospitalized far away from home, from family, and from local\ncommunity simply because an appropriate local community facility is not, within practical limits, available.\nMoreover, it is the court's responsibility to ensure that a judgment is made by a competent professional based on\nprofessional standards and practices, appropriate medical and psychological criteria, and not on administrative\nconvenience or nonmedical criteria. Thomas S. v. Flaherty, 699 F.Supp. 1178, 1183, 1200 (W.D.N.C.1988),aff'd,\n902 F.2d 250 (4th Cir.),cert. denied,498 U.S. 951, 111 S.Ct. 373, 112 L.Ed.2d 335 (1990); Lelsz v. Kavanagh,\n673 F.Supp. 828, 835 (N.D.Tex. 1987); Clark v. Cohen, 613 F.Supp. 684, 704 (E.D.Pa.1985),aff'd,794 F.2d 79\n(3d Cir.),cert. denied,479 U.S. 962, 107 S.Ct. 459, 93 L.Ed.2d 404 (1986). Thus, the court has a responsibility to\nassess a professional's expert opinion, by assessing the expert's credibility and the reliability of the information\non which the expert bases his or her opinion. The court has assessed the credibility of each witness and the\nweight to be given each witness's testimony. In assessing the credibility of the experts, the court took into account\n[108]\nthe sources of the expert's opinions. Some of the experts' selection of data was decidedly unprofessional.\nWhere the expert's data were not random, but selected by the party he or she represented, where the expert\nrelied on the representations of the parties instead of making an independent determination, and where the\nexpert deliberately attempted to mislead the court, the court has taken all these into account in its assessment.\n[109]\nSecond, the determination of whether the defendants have complied with the 1986 consent decree requires a\nclose and detailed scrutiny of the Alabama Mental Health and Mental Retardation System; and, without question,\nclose scrutiny of any state institution of the magnitude presented here will inevitably reveal numerous\ndeficiencies, and these deficiencies will not be of equal footing. Moreover, as this case dramatically\ndemonstrates, decree requirements come in all shapes and forms. At one extreme, there are those that are\nsimple and objective, and that can be easily and quickly met. It would be practical, and thus reasonable, to\nexpect 100% compliance 100% of the time as to these requirements. For example, the defendants have fully\ncomplied, as the court has expected, with the mental-illness standards 8 and 9, which require that patients not be\n\nsubjected to experimental research without informed consent and which prohibit lobotomies, psychosurgery,\n1388 electro-convulsive therapy, and other unusual or hazardous *1388 medical procedures without strict safeguards.\n[110]\nAt the other extreme, there are those requirements that are complex and greatly subjective, and that require a\nsubstantial commitment of time and resources. It would be impractical, and thus unreasonable, to expect 100%\ncompliance 100% of the time as to these requirements. For example, the court would not expect that the\ndefendants would be able to prohibit all patient abuse in the future. Obviously, the Alabama Department of Mental\nHealth and Mental Retardation can act only through people who, though professional, are still fallible. Therefore,\nin reviewing whether the defendants have complied with mental-illness standards 1 and 1900which together\n97\nprohibit patient abuse by staff00the question for the court is not simply whether there has been no patient abuse in\n97\nany of the state's mental health facilities, for such an absolute requirement would simply be impractical in the\n[111]\nimperfect world in which we live.  And although relevant, the question is not just how frequent the abuse has\nbeen. Rather, the question is multifaceted: what measures the defendants have adopted to help prevent such\nabuse; whether and how these measures have been implemented; and what steps the defendants have taken in\nthose instances when they have been presented with evidence of possible abuse. Therefore evidence that, over\na period of time, there may have been isolated instances of patient abuse would not necessarily preclude a\nfinding of good-faith full compliance with mental-illness standards 1 and 19.\nIndeed, in its memorandum opinion regarding the Eufaula Adolescent Center, the court was concerned not only\nabout the lack of safety for children at the center, but also about the fact that the defendants, when confronted\nwith such evidence, denied it without conducting their own serious and thorough investigation. The court wrote\nwith dismay: \"The court admonished the defendants that it was deeply disappointed that, rather than blanketly\ndenying the allegations without their own investigation, they had not stood up and promised a personal and\nthorough investigation of their own and that, if the allegations proved true, there was nothing within reason the\ncourt could order that they would not have already done on their own to remedy the problem effectively.\" Wyatt,\n892 F.Supp. at 1417 (footnotes omitted). Indeed, much of the relief fashioned by the court went to the defendants'\nreaction to the evidence. The court recognizes that the defendants cannot provide 100% assurance that unsafe\nconditions will not recur, and the defendants should not fear that bringing such conditions out in the open for all to\nsee. But the defendants can assure (and what the court in the end is really looking for) is that the defendants\nhave in place reasonable means for preventing such conditions to the extent practicable, and that they have in\nplace reasonable means for uncovering and remedying the conditions when, unfortunately, they do arise.\nFinally, there are some Wyatt standards that even conflict with one another. For example, mental-illness\n[112]\nstandards 1 and 19 require that patients be provided with a safe environment,  while mental-illness standard\n[113]\n7 requires freedom from unnecessary bodily restraint.  \"[A]n institution cannot protect its residents from all\ndanger of violence if it is to permit them to have any freedom of movement.\" Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 320, 102\nS.Ct. at 2460. This conflict was most pronounced in the cases of the elderly. On the one hand, because the\nelderly are fragile, there is the reasonable need to restrain them to keep them from falling and severely hurting\nthemselves, and, on the other hand, there is the humane concern that they should be allowed some freedom of\nmovement. These cases have no brightline solutions.\n1389 Therefore, relevant to the inquiry about compliance with the individual provisions in *1389 the 1986 consent\ndecree are the following: the nature of the specific term of the consent decree; the relationship of the term to\nother terms and to the decree's basic purposes; the length of time the consent decree has been in effect; the\ndefendants' history of specific as well as overall compliance; and the degree of compliance.\nWith the above legal principles and considerations in mind, the court will now turn to the specific provisions in the\n1986 consent decree. The court will address these provisions in the following order: the Wyatt mental-illness\nstandards; the Wyatt mental-retardation standards; the requirements for JCAHO accreditation and Title XIX\ncertification; and all the other provisions in the 1986 consent decree.\n\nB. Wyatt Mental-Illness Standards\n[114]\nThe defendants operate six psychiatric facilities with a census of between 1,400 and 1,900 patients.  The six\nfacilities are Bryce Hospital, Searcy Hospital, Greil Memorial Hospital, North Alabama Regional Hospital,\n[115]\nThomasville Mental Health Rehabilitation Center, and Taylor Hardin Facility.\nBryce Hospital, established in 1861, is the oldest and largest public mental health hospital in Alabama. At its peak\n[116]\nin 1969 it housed over 6,000 patients.  It is organized into separate units, including acute care, adolescent,\n[117]\nlong-term care, and nursing facilities. Today its average census is approximately 1,037 patients.  Searcy is\n[118]\nthe next largest mental hospital with approximately 484 patients. It is also organized into separate units.\n[119]\nVirtually all of Alabama's adult long-term patients reside at either Bryce or Searcy.  Greil Memorial and North\nAlabama Regional Hospitals are both acute-care facilities. They treat between 66 and 95 patients, respectively.\n[120] [121]\n Approximately 135 individuals reside at Thomasville, a transitional facility.\n[122]\nThere are 31 current Wyatt mental-illness standards.  The court has already made partial findings of\ncompliance as to ten of these standards under Rule 52(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure: mental-illness\nstandards 3 (no incompetency by reason of commitment), 5 (send/receive mail), 8 (experimental research), 9\n(lobotomy/averse conditioning, etc.), 11 (wear own clothes; keep possessions), 13 (laundering of clothes), 17\n(interaction with members of opposite sex), 18 (patient labor, etc.), 21 (staff licensing and certification\nrequirements), and 25 (patient exams following admission). Wyatt v. Poundstone, No. 3195-N, 1995 WL 938444\n(M.D.Ala. Dec. 5, 1995) (Thompson, J.).\nThe court assesses the defendants' compliance with the Wyatt mental-illness standards by category: (1) physical\nliving environment and custodial care; (2) personal liberties; (3) treatment and record keeping; (4) medical care;\n1390 (5) use and administration of psychotropic *1390 medications; (6) protection from harm and physical safety; (7)\nadequate staffing and staff supervision; (8) high risk or unusually restrictive treatment; (9) seclusion and restraint;\n(10) treatment in the least restrictive environment appropriate and transitional services; and (11) children's\nservices.\n1. Physical Living Environment and Custodial Care: Mental-illness\nStandards 12, 13, 19, and 20\nThe defendants have made significant progress in improving the physical living environment and custodial care.\nFor the most part, the defendants provide the patients in their mental-illness facilities an adequate living\n[123]\nenvironment and custodial care as defined by standards 12, 13, 19, and 20.  These standards require\nadequate clothing, adequate physical facilities, and nutritious meals.\nThe court has already made a finding of compliance with standard 13. The court now makes a finding of\ncompliance with standards 12 and 20. Generally, as to standard 12, residents are provided an adequate selection\n[124]\nof seasonable clothing.  While there are isolated incidents of noncompliance, such as elderly residents\ninadequately clothed in only robes, these incidents do not amount to a systematic violation of the standard.\nFurthermore, while there are problems with theft of clothes and while residents complain of a communal clothing\n[125]\nmentality among the staff, patients are generally adequately clothed.\n[126]\nAs for standard 20, patients are provided with nutritionally adequate meals in dining rooms.  Some residents\nare not able to eat in dining rooms because the tables are not equipped for wheelchairs and geri-chairs. While it\nis preferable for all patients to eat in dining rooms, the standard does not require that non-mobile patients eat in\ndining rooms.\nThe court reads standard 19 to apply to patients' safety in a broad sense. To the extent it prohibits abuse and\nneglect, the defendants are not in compliance, as the court will explain in its abuse-and-neglect discussion. To\n\nthe extent it applies to the physical facilities, the defendants are also not in compliance. While the defendants\n1391 have made significant progress in improving their *1391 physical facilities, they have yet to meet standard 19's\nrequirements, for there are still fire and safety hazards and other serious physical safety hazards in old buildings.\n[127]\nThe court does not find compliance to this extent.\nAs long as patients continue to live in unsafe buildings, the defendants cannot be found in compliance.\nAdditionally, there is no compliance to the extent defendants have failed to install special alert systems in\n[128]\nbedrooms for patients with mobility and communication problems.  Discouraging patients from personalizing\ntheir rooms and displaying personal objects violates this standard as well, as do sparsely decorated day rooms.\nThus, the court concludes that the defendants are in compliance with mental-illness standards 12, 13, and 20 and\nnot in compliance with standard 19.\n2. Personal Liberties: Mental-illness Standards 1, 3, 4, 5, 11, 14, 15, 16,\n17, 18, 31 and 35\nThe court finds compliance with the vast majority of the personal liberty standards. The court has already found\n[129]\ncompliance with five of the standards addressing personal liberties: 3, 5, 11, 17, and 18.  The defendants are\n[130]\nin partial compliance with standards 14 and 15.  Standards 14 and 15 address patients' rights to regular\nphysical exercise and to be outdoors. Most patients have the opportunity for physical exercise and to be\n[131]\noutdoors.  However, patients on certain wards do not have an opportunity to exercise, and those who live on\nlocked wards or who do not have unescorted ground privileges do not have an opportunity to be outdoors at\n1392 regular intervals.[132] Thus, the defendants *1392 are not in compliance with these standards.\nStandard 35 requires that upon a patient's admission, the patient and his or her family, guardian, or next-of-friend\n[133]\nshould receive written notice in understandable language of the Wyatt standards.  It also requires that all\nstandards be posted on each ward. Although, it appeared that the defendants were not yet in full compliance\nduring trial, the defendants should now be in compliance. If the defendants supplement the record forthwith to\nshow full compliance with this standard, the court will so find.\nThe defendants are not in compliance with standards 1, 4, 16, and 31. Standard 1 states that \"Patients have a\n[134]\nright to privacy and dignity.\"  The defendants require adults to stand naked in the hallway to await group\n[135]\nshowers.  Requiring adults to stand naked in the hallways violates their dignity and privacy. The defendants\n[136]\nalso place patients in four-point restraints in the middle of hallways, in front of nursing stations.  When placed\nin a four-point restraint a patient is lying on a movable bed spread eagle with his or her ankles and wrists tied to\neach corner. Placing an individual in such a compromising position in a public space for all to see is an affront to\nan individual's dignity. JCAHO survey teams have also found the defendants do not promote care for certain\n[137]\npatients \"in a manner that maintains or enhance[s] each resident's dignity and safety.\"  The defendants are\nnot in compliance with standard 1.\nStandard 4 requires that patients have the same rights to visitation and telephone calls as do patients at other\n[138]\npublic hospitals.  However, patients' visitors00 families and friends00are not allowed to visit them on the wards,\n97 97\nbut must instead visit with the patients in public common areas which can be loud and noisy and often do not\n[139]\nprovide for privacy.  Today, most public hospitals allow visitors on the living units so that family and friends\n[140]\ncan observe the living conditions and treatment of loved ones.  Indeed, if the court is to release the\ndefendants from any standards, such observation by loved ones is one of the most effective ways by which the\ncourt can be assured that the defendants will continue to respect the rights of patients in its hospitals.\n1393 Standard 16 provides that patients shall have an opportunity for religious worship.[141]*1393 While patients have\nan opportunity to worship, Protestants do not have the opportunity to worship with the denomination of their\n[142]\nchoice.\n\n[143]\nStandard 31 sets forth the confidentiality rules for patient records.  The standard sets forth who may have\naccess to a patients records and what each record shall include at a minimum. The defendants are not in\ncompliance with several provisions of the standard. First, the plaintiff-class's attorneys and their designated\nagents are among the individuals who entitled to access to a patient's records, notwithstanding applicable rules\nand statutes. As previously shown, the defendants violated this standard when they sent to each guardian or\nparent of a resident a misleading letter. The letters misled the guardians and parents about the nature of this\nlitigation. But, in addition to this, as stated, the letters incorrectly suggested that the defendants needed the\n[144]\napproval of the guardian or parent in order for the plaintiffs-class's attorneys to see a patient's record.\nStandard 31 is also violated in that certain items required by the standard to be in the patient's record are not\nalways there. For example, any physical restraint or seclusion, including soft restraints, requires a signed order\nby a qualified physician in the patient's file. There is not always a signed order by a physician for every instance\nof seclusion or restraint. Additionally, summaries of extraordinary incidents in the facility involving the patient are\nto be included in the file. However, often these are included in an incident report only and are not in the patient's\nfile. These are just some examples of the missing items in patient's records. Thus, the court finds that the\ndefendants do not comply with standard 31 sufficiently.\nIn sum, the defendants have made progress in assuring patient's personal liberties and are in compliance with\nstandards 3, 5, 11, 17, and 18. However, they still have some progress to make as to standards 1, 4, 14, 15, 16,\n31 and 35.\n3. Treatment and Record Keeping: Mental-illness Standard 26\nWyatt mental-illness standard 26 is a comprehensive and detailed standard requiring that the defendants develop\n[145]\nand implement for each individual patient an individual treatment plan.  The essence of this standard is to\nprovide the committed patients, whose freedom has been taken away, individual treatment that will give each\npatient a realistic opportunity to be cured or to improve his or her mental condition. Wyatt, 325 F.Supp. at 784.\nUnder this standard, each patient shall have an individual treatment plan developed by a treatment team. The\n1394 standard has many requirements as to how the plan shall be developed, what it shall *1394 contain, and how it\nshall be implemented and updated. It also requires \"utilization review.\" Utilization review requires the facility to\nreview a patient's need for continued inpatient treatment according to certain criteria, including applicable\n[146]\nstandards for commitment.  If a patient no longer meets the criteria, he or she must be released immediately\nand linked to appropriate community services, unless the patient agrees to continued voluntary treatment in the\nfacility.\nWhile all patients are given a comprehensive individual treatment plan upon admission, these plans are not\n[147]\nalways implemented, nor for the intermediate and long-term patients are they updated.  Psychiatric\n[148]\nassessments of intermediate and long-term patients are often outdated and cursory.  For example, in one\nlong-term unit at Bryce Hospital, the average length of time since the last psychiatric assessment was in excess\n[149] [150]\nof seven years.  Furthermore, untrained and unqualified staff are asked to update treatment plans.\nIndeed, Greil Memorial Hospital received the lowest form of accreditation awarded by JCAHO recently because\nof serious deficiencies throughout the hospital, which included deficiencies in treatment planning and therapeutic\n[151]\nactivities.\nOther patients simply do not belong in the hospital in violation of the \"utilization review\" portion of this standard\nand other standards relating to least restrictive environment. For example, some patients' only \"active\" problems\n[152]\nare the unavailability of community services.  For other patients their treatment plans failed to target the\nbehavior that is keeping them in the hospital. For example, charts reviewed by one of the plaintiffs' experts\nidentified treatment goals that addressed non-psychiatric problems, such as incontinence, obesity, and foot\n[153]\nfungus.\n\n[154]\nFurthermore, an absence of activities and programs exacerbates patients' conditions.  Many patients at\n1395 Bryce spend their days idly, with little or nothing to do.[155] Meaningful *1395 daily activities are critical to the\n[156]\ntreatment programs for persons with mental illness.\nThe absence of activities is even more pronounced at the Kidd, Allen, and Box nursing facilities, which serve\nolder adults. Adults are lined up in a circle around the day rooms in geri-chairs and/or restraints all day, doing\n[157]\nnothing.  The absence of meaningful activities for older adults, especially those with dementia, results in their\n[158]\nbecoming more withdrawn and apathetic and in further cognitive deterioration.  Thus, quality of life\nsignificantly deteriorates.\nFor the reasons set forth above, the court concludes that the defendants are not in compliance with standard 26.\n4. Medical Care: Mental-illness Standards 10, 25, and 30\nStandard 10 states that \"Patients have a right to receive prompt and adequate medical treatment for any physical\nailments.\" Standard 25 requires that \"Each patient shall have a comprehensive physical and mental examination\nand review of behavioral status within 48 hours after admission to the hospital.\" And standard 30 covers the\n[159]\ntreatment of other physical illnesses, such as tuberculosis.\nThe court has already found compliance with standard 25 and now finds compliance with standards 10 and 30.\n[160]\n The only reservation the court has as to these two latter standards is the failure of the defendants to provide\ncondoms to patients who are HIV-positive and known to be sexually active. The court hopes that the defendants\nhave addressed this problem.\nAdmittedly, the plaintiffs identified two or three deaths that they claimed resulted from inadequate care. They\nfurther claimed that patients in two cases had limbs amputated because of substandard care. The evidence\nsurrounding these incidents is too insufficient and inconclusive to support the conclusion that defendants\nprovided inadequate medical care to these patients and that the defendants are not entitled to a finding that they\nhave complied with standards 10, 25, and 30.\n5. Use and Administration of Psychotropic Medications: Mental-illness\nStandard 6\nStandard 6 addresses medications. Standard 6 requires that patients not be medicated unless necessary, and it\n1396 provides protections and procedures to ensure compliance.[161] The defendants violate this standard *1396 in\nseveral ways. First, long-term patients are maintained with no improvement on stagnant medication regimes, in\n[162]\nviolation of professional standards that require experimentation to find drugs that are more effective.\nSecond, the defendants do not follow professional standards in administering drugs. Nurses sometimes initial\nthat a drug has been administered prior to actually administering the medication. This unprofessional practice\n[163]\nmakes records and notations of medication unreliable in violation of professional standards.  Third,\n[164]\nmedication management does not adequately identify patients' adverse drug reactions.\nThere was much evidence at trial that the defendants could be in violation of this standard because they were not\nusing Clozaril. However, because there was also evidence that this is a new drug that can cause death in a small\nnumber of patients, the court cannot, and should not, fault the defendants for deciding, in their professional\njudgment, not to use the drug. Moreover, the court's duty does not extend to such minuscule oversight.\n\n6. Adequate Staffing and Staff Supervision: Mental-illness Standards\n21, 22, 23, and 24\nStandards 21 through 24 are intended to require staffing and supervision sufficient to administer adequate\n[165]\ntreatment plans and ensure the safety and basic needs of patients.  Standard 21 requires that staff meet\ncertain licensing requirements. The court has already found that the defendants comply with this standard.\nStandard 22 requires that the defendants provide a certain amount of staff training. The defendants also are in\n[166]\ncompliance with this standard.\nThe defendants, however, are not in compliance with standards 23 and 24. Standard 23 addresses staff\n1397 supervision, and requires *1397 that staff who are not qualified mental health professionals be under the\nsupervision of such professionals. The defendants are not in compliance with this standard because most non-\nprofessional staff is supervised by nurses who are not qualified mental health personnel. However, this practice is\ncommon in psychiatric hospitals, and thus the court would entertain a motion to modify this standard so as to\n[167]\nplace the defendants into compliance under their current practices.\nStandard 24 requires that the defendants meet certain staffing ratios. The specific ratios listed in the standard\napply to Bryce and Searcy Hospitals only, and there is no evidence before the court that the defendants do not\ncomply with these specific ratios at these two hospitals. The court therefore finds compliance with this standard.\n[168]\nIn summary, the court finds that the defendants are in compliance with standards 21, 22, and 24 and are not in\ncompliance with standard 23.\n7. Protection From Harm and Physical Safety: Mental-illness\nStandards 1 and 19\nThis court reads standards 1 and 19 to also require that patients confined by the defendants in their institutions\nbe protected from harm. As stated, standard 1 provides that \"Patients have a right to privacy and dignity,\" and\nstandard 19 provides, in part, that \"A patient has a right to a humane psychological and physical environment.\"\n[169]\n Patients are not protected from harm and provided a safe environment. Incident reports reveal large\nnumbers of incidents of staff abuse of patients, patient-on-patient abuse, sexual abuse, and unexplained injuries.\n[170]\n Examples of abuse and neglect revealed in the incident reports include the following:\n* On June 22, at Searcy, a mental health worker jumped a female patient who was mentally\nretarded. According to witnesses, the patient, was kicked in the stomach, on her buttocks, and\nbetween her legs. The mental health worker also pulled her hair and scratched her face. During\n[171]\nthe fight, other patients (and staff) gathered around, yelling encouragement to the worker.\n* On November 3, 1993, a female patient was sexually abused by a male mental health worker\nwhile seated with other patients in the courtyard. According to the female patient, another patient\nhad rubbed the mental health worker to the point of arousal. The worker wanted the female patient\nto feel his erection. When she refused and tried to stand up, the mental health worker touched her\n[172]\nbreasts and grabbed her hand trying to get her to touch him.\n[173] [174]\nMental health workers push, slap, and hit patients.  They also tolerate patient-on-patient abuse.\nCertain patients suffer repeated abuse, yet nothing is done. For example, Robert H., a named class member\n[175]\nsustained more than 40 injuries over the course of a three-year-and-ten-month period.  This one patient was\nhit by a staff member with a clip board on the head, necessitating 14 sutures, and repeatedly beaten by staff\n1398 members with coat *1398 hangers.[176] Staff also allowed other patients to hurt this patient.\n\nIn a three-month period, reports indicated that another patient, John F., was beaten with coat hangers, choked,\n[177]\nslapped, hit, and kicked by staff.  An advocacy program investigation disclosed 22 incidents in December\n[178]\n1993 alone as to this patient, including staff abuse and self-abusive behaviors.  The court concurs with the\n[179]\nadvocacy program in concluding that this patient's right to a safe environment was violated.\nIn addition, there was the staff abuse and lack of safety at the Eufaula Adolescent Center. The court will not\nrepeat this evidence.\nThese incidents are not isolated incidents. Abuse00staff-on-patient, patient-on-patient, and self-abuse due to the\n97\n[180]\nfailure to provide treatment for maladaptive behaviors00is widespread.  Abuse is not only physical, but also\n97\n[181]\nverbal.\nThe defendants have failed to address this abuse in any meaningful and effective way. Indeed, the defendants'\nresponse to the widespread incidents of abuse verges on neglect. In part, this is due to problems Sundram\nidentified in his reports on the defendants' investigatory process of incidents, which fails to identify the causes of\n[182]\nincidents and recommend changes, so as to prevent future incidents.  At the mental-illness facilities, hospital\n[183]\npolice conduct investigations.  These investigations are narrowly focused on whether a criminal statute has\n[184]\nbeen violated and do not focus on the cause of the incident and ways to avoid it in the future.  Files contain\n[185]\nlittle to no suggestions for preventing future similar incidents.  Reports merely summarize witness statements\nwith little to no analysis or evaluation; nor do reports analyze evidence. Most incidents are \"unsubstantiated\"\neven in the face of multiple patient witnesses and physical evidence. The investigators have little to no clinical\ntraining, especially in assessing the credibility of patient victims and witnesses. An even greater problem is under-\nreporting, that is, the failure to report incidents. The follow-up that the defendants conduct on investigations\n00facility, regional and central review through quality assurance and improvement programs00has failed to detect\n97 97\n[186]\nthe deficiencies in investigations noted above.  As a result, it is rare that action is taken to correct problems\n[187]\nand prevent further abuse from occurring.  After Sundram's studies, the defendants requested that he\nformulate specific written recommendations to address these investigatory problems. Sundram complied with\ntheir request, but the defendants, at the time of trial, had not implemented his suggestions, nor corrected the\n[188]\nproblems he identified.\n1399 *1399 The advocacy program, while certainly benefitting patients, has also failed to prevent the abuse detailed\n[189]\nabove. There are insufficient numbers of advocates to handle all of the patients in the system.\nMoreover, as already indicated, the defendants tend to respond to any revelations of serious deficiencies00such\n97\nas abuse and lack of safety00by coverup and denials, They tend to condemn the messenger of the deficiencies\n97\nrather than address the problem itself.\n8. Seclusion and Restraint: Mental-illness Standard 7\n[190]\nStandard 7 states patients' rights to be free from unreasonable seclusion and restraint.  Restraint usually\nrefers to tying or strapping someone to a chair or bed. Seclusion refers to the practice of confining someone\nalone in a bare room. Under standard 7, these methods are to be used only as a last resort, after less restrictive\ninterventions, such as social reinforcement of behavior, have failed, and never for staff convenience or as\npunishment. Thus, the standard prohibits seclusion or restraint, except for a small number of situations. If one of\nthese situations arises, the standard has multiple procedures that must be used for placing and monitoring\nsomeone in seclusion or restraint. While the defendants have made significant progress in improving their\nseclusion-and-restraint practices, they have not complied with this standard to the extent they can be released.\n[191]\n The standards' requirements, which range from requiring a written order from a physician to using restraint\nonly as a last resort, are not always followed; compliance is erratic. Patients are placed in restraints without the\nrequisite orders, and patients are not always given the bathroom privileges and motion exercises that are\n[192]\nrequired by the standard.  Restraints are often tied incorrectly, risking injury and causing discomfort to\n\n[193]\npatients.  And staff have used sheets to restrain patients placing them at risk for strangulation and in violation\n[194]\nof professional standards.\nThere was also evidence of the improper and excessive use of restraints on elderly patients, and that this use\nhas led to injuries and atrophy of the elderly's mobility. These cases do not, however, present brightline solutions.\nOn the one hand, because the elderly are fragile, there is the reasonable need to restrain them to keep to keep\nthem from falling and severely hurting themselves; but, and, on the other hand, there is the humane concern that\nthey should be allowed some freedom of movement. The court cannot conclude that the defendants' treatment of\nthe elderly has violated standard 7.\n1400 *1400 Furthermore, the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation's own data regarding the number of\nincidents are unreliable due to selective reporting and unwarranted narrow definitions of seclusion and restraint\n[195]\nthat exclude many occurrences.\nInstead of complying with Wyatt mental-illness standard 7, the defendants have implemented their own\nstandards, which they contend protect patients' rights. These standards allow standing orders for restraints if a\n[196]\npatient's consent is obtained and close monitoring of patients in seclusion and restraint.  These safeguards\n[197]\nhowever are insufficient. First, patients cannot meaningfully assert their right to consent.  Furthermore, they\n[198]\nare not always implemented.  More importantly, standard 7 has not been modified by the court, nor have the\ndefendants sought to have it modified. The defendants cannot simply disregard standards with which they\ndisagree.\n9. Dangerous or Unusual Medical Procedures: Mental-illness\nStandards 8 and 9\nStandard 8 gives patients the right not to be subjected to experimental research without informed consent and\nstandard 9 prohibits lobotomies, psychosurgery, electro-convulsive therapy (ECT), and other unusual or\n[199]\nhazardous medical procedures without strict safeguards.  The court has already found compliance with these\nstandards.\n10. Treatment in the Least Restrictive Environment Necessary to\nAchieve the Purposes of Commitment Transitional Community\nServices, and Community Facilities and Services: Mental-illness\nStandards 2 and 34 and ¶ 9 of the 1986 Consent Decree\nAs previously explained, one of the central goals of the 1986 consent decree was the development of community\nfacilities and services. Paragraph 9 of the 1986 consent decree provides: \"The defendants be and are hereby\nENJOINED to continue to make substantial progress in placing members of the plaintiff class in community\n[200]\nfacilities and programs.\"  This provision in the consent decree essentially sought to implement mental-illness\n[201]\nstandards 2 and 34.\nStandard 2 states that \"Patients have a right to the least restrictive conditions necessary to achieve the purposes\nof commitment.\" And standard 34 requires that patients not simply be released into the streets once they no\n1401 longer require institutionalization, but instead be provided appropriate community *1401 care when released,\nwhether that be a residential live-in program in the community teaching important daily living and coping skills,\n[202]\nday treatment, or intermittent crisis care.\nThe least restrictive environment necessary to achieve the purposes of commitment is a highly individualized\nconcept, requiring that, based on professional judgment, each individual live as independently and with as few\n[203]\nrestrictions on his or her liberties as practicable.  This means that while patients are in the hospital they\n\nshould be treated in the least restrictive environment that is necessary to achieve the purposes of their\ncommitment. Thus, for example, if a patient does not require restraints, then to place him or her in restraints\nviolates this standard. Or, for example, if a patient does not need to be on a locked ward, placing that individual\non a locked ward, or revoking ground privileges if unnecessary for treatment, violates this standard. This\nstandard also requires that if a patient need not be in an institution, that is, they can be either treated adequately\nin the community with community supports and programs, or they no longer meet the criteria for commitment to\n[204]\nan institution, they be released.  Based on the professional judgment of their own staff, the defendants do not\ncomply with these requirements.\nFirst, the defendants practice of placing patients on locked wards initially and then allowing them to earn their\n[205]\nright to less restrictions violates this standard.  Often there are no rationales or justifications for restrictions,\n[206]\nsuch as locked wards and no grounds privileges.\nSecond, while clearly some individuals with mental illness must be confined in institutions, not all of the\nindividuals in the defendants' institutions belong there. Some patients do not require hospitalization in order to\nmeet the purposes of their commitment. With appropriate supports they can be treated in the community. And\nsome patients meet the commitment criteria only because of the lack of available community services. That is,\nwithout these community services they become dangerous either to themselves or to others, but with these\nservices they would not need to be committed in the first place.\nIn 1986, the defendants committed themselves under the terms of the consent decree to developing a broad\nrange of community facilities and programs to ensure that standards 2 and 34 would be implemented. This range\nof facilities and programs included a continuum of residential settings for the mentally ill from the most intensively\nstaffed to the least intensively staffed, day treatment programs, a range of psychosocial and vocational\nrehabilitation programs geared to patients who have a wide variation in skills and functional levels, case\nmanagement services, substance abuse programs, crisis intervention services, and inpatient services in local\n[207]\nhospitals or crisis residences.  Establishing these facilities and programs would make unnecessary the\n[208]\nongoing hospitalization in state institutions of hundreds of patients.  Through the consent decree and\nnumerous discussions with the Wyatt Committee, the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation\n[209]\nacknowledged the need for these facilities and programs and began to establish them.  While the defendants\n1402 have *1402 made progress, they have failed to allocate the requisite resources to develop the needed\n[210]\ncommunity-based facilities and services.  The defendants have created a paper structure of a broad range of\n[211]\ncommunity facilities and programs, but they have failed to devote the resources needed to develop them.\nOne of the most egregious failures is the failure to develop crisis services. Only five of Alabama's 22 community\n[212]\nmental health boards have crisis programs.  Case management services are either not provided or are\n[213]\ninadequate because the case manager's load is far too high,  and community services for the elderly are\n[214]\nseriously deficient.  The gap between the services that exist and those that are needed is substantial.\nAs a result of the failure to fund community facilities and programs, individuals who need not be institutionalized\nremain in institutions where their freedom to live as normal and free a life as possible is significantly diminished.\n[215]\n The record is replete with examples of patients for whom there is no clinical justification for continued\ninstitutionalization. At the periodic recommitment hearings, required by this court in 1991, many patients were\n[216]\nrecommitted or placed on voluntary status because of the absence of community alternatives.  And other\nindividuals slated for community placements are required to wait months for an opening or are transferred to\n[217]\nanother institution, such as Thomasville, which is not the least restrictive environment appropriate.\nThe defendants' failure at achieving this goal is underscored by the fact that they have been under an obligation\nsince 1986 to provide community facilities and programs for those entitled to be the least restrictive environment\nin light of professional judgment.\nNot only does the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation fail to discharge patients who do not\n1403 necessarily require hospitalization if given the appropriate community supports, when it does discharge *1403\n\n[218]\npatients it fails to provide adequate transitional care and sometimes places patients in substandard facilities.\nThe defendants typically do no more to ensure adequate transitional care than make a phone call to schedule an\nappointment for discharged patients at a community mental health center. There is no follow-up to ensure that a\n[219]\npatient has kept the appointment and is receiving services from the community mental health center.  The\ncourt finds that the defendants have failed miserably at meeting standard 34.\nIn 1991, the defendants moved to vacate standard 34, which requires transitional services. In moving to vacate\nstandard 34, the defendants admitted that they consciously violated then standard 33 (requiring discharge of\npatients who do not need hospitalization), in order not to have to comply with standard 34. In denying their\nmotion, the court noted that the defendants had \"essentially ignored both standards over the years.\" Wyatt, 811\nF.Supp. at 1544. By seeking to eliminate the standard, the defendants sought \"to bring the court into complicity\nwith their unexcused failure for over 20 years to comply with both Standards 33 and 34.\" Id. This willful violation\ndemonstrates the gravity and duration of defendants' failure to comply with standards 2 and 34 and paragraph\nnine of the 1986 consent decree.\nThe court recognizes that the defendants have begun to make progress in discharging patients who are\nunnecessarily hospitalized. However, this progress is recent and there is no guarantee that they will continue\nalong this path to the extent necessary under the consent decree. An update on the defendants' progress may,\nand should, reveal more substantial compliance with standards 2 and 34.\n11. Children's Services: Mental-illness Standard 32\n[220]\nStandard 32 addresses the special needs of children and young adults.  Standard 32 requires that the\nDepartment of Mental Health and Mental Retardation make special provisions for children in its facilities,\nincluding educational opportunities, treatment that considers the child's maturational and developmental level,\nsufficient staff specialized in the care of children, recreational and play opportunities in the open air, appropriate\nresidential facilities, and arrangements for contact between the hospital and the family.\nApart from evidence on the Eufaula Adolescent Center, very little evidence was provided or highlighted at trial on\nthe services to adolescents in the defendants' other hospitals, such as the Bryce Adolescent Unit. While the\nevidence is sketchy, it appears that the defendants provide the bare minimum of adolescent services required by\n1404 standard 32. *1404 Thus, the court finds compliance with standard 32.\n12. Summary as to Mental-illness Standards\nIn conclusion, as to the mental-illness standards, the court finds that the defendants have made significant\nimprovements in their facilities since this litigation began in 1970. The defendants, for the most part, provide\nclean environments where basic needs are met and develop initially individual treatment plans for each patient.\nHowever, significant violations of individual liberties remain as to privacy and safety, violations of professional\nstandards as to the administration of psychotropic medications, updating and implementing adequate treatment\nprograms, safety and abuse, staffing, and the availability of community services for patients, who in the opinion of\nthe state's own professionals, could be returned to their communities if such facilities were available.\nFor the above reasons, the court concludes as follows:\n(1) The defendants are in compliance with the following mental-illness standards: 3 (no\nincompetency by reason of commitment), 5 (send/receive mail), 8 (experimental research), 9\n(lobotomy/averse conditioning, etc.), 10 (prompt and adequate medical treatment), 11 (wear own\nclothes; keep possessions), 12 (clothing allowance, selection), 13 (laundering of clothes), 17\n(interaction with members of opposite sex), 18 (patient labor, etc.), 20 (nutritional standards), 21\n(staff licensing and certification requirements), 22 (orientation training for nonprofessional staff),\n24 (minimum number of treatment personnel), 25 (patient exams following admission), 30\n(entitlement to physical care), and 32 (special provisions for children, young adults).\n\n(2) The defendants are not in compliance with the following mental-illness standards: 1 (privacy\nand dignity), 2 (least restrictive conditions), 4 (visitation rights), 6 (freedom from unnecessary\nmedication), 7 (freedom from seclusion/physical restraint), 14 (physical exercise), 15 (outdoors at\nregular intervals), 16 (religion), 19 (humane environment; facilities; etc.), 23 (supervision of staff,\npatient treatment), 26 (individualized treatment plan, etc.), 31 (confidentiality of records, etc.), 34\n[221]\n(transitional treatment post-release), and 35 (written notice of mental illness standards).\nC. Wyatt Mental-Retardation Standards\nThe defendants operate five mental retardation developmental centers: Partlow Developmental Center, Albert P.\nBrewer Developmental Center, J.S. Tarwater Developmental Center, Glen Ireland II Developmental Center, and\nLurleen B. Wallace Developmental Center. Each of these facilities is a residential training center for individuals\nwith mental retardation and developmental disabilities. The total current census in these facilities is approximately\n1000.\n[222]\nThere are 47 current mental-retardation standards.  The court, as stated, has already made partial findings of\ncompliance under Rule 52(c) of the Federal Rules of Procedure as to 14 of these standards: 8 (evaluation within\n14 days of admission), 17 (no incompetency by reason of commitment), 18 (religion), 19 (telephone/visitation\nrights), 20 (send/receive mail), 21 (interaction with opposite sex), 23 (no seclusion; \"time-out\" ok), 24 (behavior\nmodification only with consent), 25 (electric shock only for extraordinary circumstances), 29 (no experimental\ntreatment without consent), 30 (no unusual or hazardous treatment without consent), 32 (outdoors at regular\nintervals), 33 (resident labor, etc.), and 45 (no organ removal). Wyatt v. Poundstone, No. 3195-N, 1995 WL\n569121 (M.D.Ala. April 18, 1995) (Thompson, J.).\nThe court assesses the defendants' compliance with the mental-retardation standards by category: (1) physical\n1405 environment; *1405 (2) custodial care; (3) residents' rights; (4) habilitation and programming; (5) least restrictive\nenvironment; (6) medication, medical care, and restraint; (7) adequate staffing; and (8) protection from harm.\nWhile the court makes findings of compliance for the department's mental-retardation facilities as a whole, the\ncourt notes at the outset that there are significant differences in levels of compliance among the different\nfacilities. The court recognizes that certain facilities, such as Brewer, have made significant progress in certain\nareas, such as habilitation. However, other facilities, such as Wallace and Ireland have failed to make progress\nand their practices still do not conform to minimal professional standards. Because of the scope of this lawsuit,\nthe court finds compliance and noncompliance as to the mental-retardation system as a whole. Furthermore, the\ncourt notes that not one facility is in compliance with all the relevant standards, and therefore none would be\neligible for release entirely.\n1. Physical Environment: Mental-retardation Standard 38\nMental-retardation standard 38 states that \"A resident has a right to a humane physical environment within the\ninstitutional facilities. These facilities shall be designed to make a positive contribution to the efficient attainment\n[223]\nof the habilitation goals of the institution.\"  The standard has specific requirements for day rooms, toilets and\nlavatories, showers, residential units, dining facilities, linen servicing and handling, housekeeping, nonambulatory\nservices, and maintenance and safety of the physical plant. The defendants have made significant progress in\nupgrading the physical environment at their mental-retardation facilities and, for the most part, the defendants\n[224]\ncomply with this standard.  There are inconsistencies in the availability of adaptive equipment at the\n[225]\ndefendants' facilities, such as an absence of light alarms for the deaf and hearing impaired.  The absence of\nadaptive equipment shall be corrected by the defendants. With this exception noted, the court finds compliance\n[226]\nwith this category and standard.\n\n2. Custodial Care: Mental-retardation Standards 34, 35, and 37\nMental-retardation standards 34, 35, and 37 address an adequate diet, adequate clothing, and normal grooming,\n1406 such as teeth brushing and bathing.[227] While the defendants *1406 have made progress in improving custodial\ncare, they still have failed to ensure that all residents at all of their institutions are provided minimal upkeep.\nStandard 34 requires that residents be provided a nourishing and well-balanced diet. The department contracts\n[228]\nwith a food service, which provides residents with a nourishing and well-balanced diet.  The department,\nhowever, does not always comply with subsection (b) of the standard, which requires that therapeutic diets be\n[229]\nprovided to the residents.  Some residents require chopped food and liquid diets, but are fed solid food,\n[230] [231]\nwhich can result in choking.  Thus, the consequences of noncompliance can be fatal and is unexcused.\nThe court finds compliance with standard 34, with the exception of subsection (b).\nStandard 35 requires that residents have an ample supply of neat, fitting, and seasonable clothing. It also\nrequires that special clothing needs be met. Residents at Wallace and Ireland are not always provided neat,\nfitting, and appropriate clothing. They have been found wearing clothing that is not their own, misfitting, and\n[232]\ninappropriate.\nStandard 37 requires that residents be regularly groomed and be assisted in learning good grooming practices,\nincluding brushing teeth, bathing, and nail cutting. While the defendants comply with this standard at Brewer, they\n[233]\ndo not comply with this standard at Wallace and Ireland.  The defendants fail to ensure that all residents'\n[234]\nteeth are brushed, hair is washed, and clothing clean.  Many residents at Wallace have lost teeth as a result\n[235]\nof inadequate dental hygiene.\n1407 *1407 For their mental retardation system as a whole, the court finds that the defendants are in compliance with\nstandard 34, excluding subsection (b), and are thus not in compliance with standards 34(b), 35, and 37.\n3. Residents' Rights: Mental-retardation Standards 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,\n20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 36, and 42\nThe court has, as stated, already found compliance with eleven of these 17 resident-rights standards (mental-\n1408 retardation standards 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 29, 30, and 32),[236] and noncompliance with one (standard \n[237]\n*1408 42).  The rights that are complied with range from the right to send and receive mail to the right not to\nbe subjected to unusual or hazardous treatments. They are all complied with.\nStandard 42 requires that a resident and his or her next-of-kin or guardian receive a copy of his or her rights\nunder the Wyatt standards upon admission. As stated, the court has previously found that the defendants were\nnot in compliance with this standard. However, it should take the defendants' little effort to achieve compliance\npromptly with this standard.\nAs for the remaining standards 15, 16, 27, 31, and 36, the court finds that the defendants are in compliance with\n[238]\nstandards 31 and 36, and not in compliance with standards 15, 16, and 27.  Standard 31 requires that a\n[239]\nresident has a right to regular exercise several times a week. This standard is met.\nStandard 36 requires that residents be able to keep their personal possessions. With the exception of some\n[240]\nproblems with stealing, the defendants comply with this standard.\n[241]\nStandard 15 states that \"Residents shall have a right to dignity, privacy and humane care.\"  This standard is\nmet to the extent the above rights are respected; however, it is not met to the extent residents are subject to\nabuse and neglect. Thus, the court finds noncompliance, but will explain this finding in its discussion of abuse\nand neglect.\n\nStandard 16 ensures that residents maintain their rights as citizens of the United States and Alabama. As with\nstandard 15, this standard is met to the extent that the above rights are respected; however, it is not met to the\nextent that residents' rights under the United States Constitution, as embodied, and defined by agreement of the\nparties, in the 1986 consent decree, are not respected. Thus, to the extent the defendants are in noncompliance\nwith the decree they are in violation of standard 16.\nStandard 27 states \"Corporal punishment shall not be permitted.\" This standard is not complied with. Residents\nare subjected to corporal punishment by staff. The court will explain this findings in its discussion of abuse and\nneglect of residents.\nThus, while many of the residents' rights are respected and the defendants are in compliance with standards 17,\n18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 29, 30, 31, 32, and 36, the defendants still violate significant and important resident's\nrights and are not in compliance with standards 15, 16, 27, and 42.\n1409  4. Habilitation and Programming: Mental-retardation Standards 1,\n*1409\n2, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 33, 43, and 44\nThese mental-retardation standards001, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 33, 43, and 4400require that residents receive\n97 97\n[242]\nindividual habilitation that is suited to their needs and maximizes their coping and living skills.  Habilitation is\n1410 defined by the Wyatt mental-retardation standards as \"the process by which the staff *1410 of the institution\nassists the resident to acquire and maintain those life skills which enable him to cope more effectively with the\ndemands of his own person and of his environment and to raise the level of his physical, mental, and social\n[243]\nefficiency. Habilitation includes but is not limited to programs of formal, structured education and treatment.\"\nIn lay terms, habilitation means helping individuals with mental retardation or developmental disabilities acquire\nneeded skills. Its focus is on training and development. The term habilitation is used instead of treatment\nbecause mental retardation is a learning disability and training impairment rather than an illness. Youngberg, 457\nU.S. at 309 n. 1, 102 S.Ct. at 2454 n. 1. The habilitation standards address what type of individual habilitation\nplans are required, what must be in those plans, how those plans shall be implemented and updated, and how\nparents or guardians shall be updated.\nThe court has already found compliance with standard 33, which spells out multiple rules for resident labor. It\nrelates to habilitation in so far as labor tasks are or are not assigned as therapeutic tasks aimed at habilitation.\nThe court also finds compliance with certain of the other habilitation standards. Those that merely address paper\nwork and deadlines00that is, those that set deadlines for the development of a plan and evaluation, standards 7,\n97\n8, and 9, and the standard that addresses the availability and privacy of records, standard 1400are generally\n97\n[244]\ncomplied with.  Additionally, the defendants comply with standards 5 and 44. Standard 5 requires that\nresidents receive suitable educational services. The defendants comply with this standard. Standard 44 prohibits\nbehavior modification programs in the absence of a physician's certification that the problem is not medically\nrelated and prohibits programs seeking to eliminate socially appropriate behavior. The defendants comply with\n[245]\nthis standard as well.\nAs for the rest of the habilitation standards 00standards 1, 2, 11, 12, and 43, which go to the minimal effect and\n97\nquality of the habilitation and not just to the mere fact of paperwork or deadlines00the court finds noncompliance.\n97\nStandards 1 and 2 together provide that each resident has a right to habilitation suited to his or her needs and\n[246]\nwhich will maximize his or her abilities to cope with the world and to live a life as normal as possible.\nStandards 11 and 12 together require that each residents' habilitation be supervised and integrated by a qualified\nmental retardation professional or QMRP. They require that the resident be released to less restrictive habilitation\nsettings when appropriate, and that the habilitation plans be continuously reviewed and modified when\nnecessary. These standards are also not being met.\n[247]\nResidents are not being provided adequate and minimally professional habilitation.  While the defendants\n1411 have come a long way in beginning to habilitate their residents, *1411 they still do not meet minimal professional\n\nstandards. For example, while each resident has a habilitation plan, these plans are often not individualized and\n[248]\nare inconsistently and inadequately implemented.  The defendants fail to meet minimal professional\n[249]\nstandards for teaching the acquisition of skills.  Many residents are provided nonfunctional tasks in violation\n[250]\nof minimal professional standards.  A functional task is one that teaches the resident a functional skill that\n\"enable[s] [the resident] to cope more effectively with the demands of his own person and of his environment.\"\n[251]\n For example, instead of being occupied with functional skills many residents spend their time sorting and\n[252]\ndoing make-work.  The defendants themselves have recognized that the residents in their facilities have\n[253]\nmuch greater potential to perform useful skills for which they could be paid than they currently teach them.\n1412 Staff interaction with patients does little to aid habilitation.[254] Staff fail to adequately *1412 train, supervise and\n[255]\ninteract with residents. As a result residents remain idle, unoccupied, and inadequately supervised.  Staff\nignore residents when they are behaving properly, doing little to reinforce good behavior, and intervene only to\n[256]\nstop inappropriate behavior, sometimes reinforcing it by giving it attention.  Data collection is not consistent\n[257]\nwith professional standards, nor does it reflect what is actually occurring.  Collection of data is critical to\n[258]\nadequate habilitation because it is necessary for ensuring that plans are relevant and effective.\nIn the area of behavioral programming00 that is, programming designed to correct maladaptive behaviors00the\n97 97\n[259]\ndefendants' habilitation efforts are woefully inadequate.  Some residents with severe behavior problems do\n[260]\nnot even have a program to address their behavior.  Those who do have programs often have inadequate\nones. Programs are not professionally designed, lacking professional analysis of the behavior to be corrected,\n1413 and therefore are less effective.[261] Additionally, defendants fail to provide *1413 adequate services and\n[262]\nprogramming for individuals with communication disorders.\nThe defendants also fail to meet the standard 2's requirement that habilitation enable residents to live a life \"as\nnormally as possible\" and that residents be transferred to the least restrictive environment for habilitation. This\nfinding, however, is explained in the next section addressing least restrictive environment.\nStandard 43 covers the defendants' obligations to update the guardians or next-of-kin of residents on the\nprogress of residents. It requires that the defendants note in these updates the services which have not been\nprovided because of a lack of resources. While the defendants send letters semiannually to the vast majority of\nresidents and annually to a minority, noting residents' general progress and any significant health problems, they\nfail to always note services from which a resident could have benefitted but were not provided because of\n[263]\nresources.\nThus, the defendants are in compliance with most of the habilitation standards relating to mere formalities, such\nas paperwork, standards 7, 8, 9, and 14. They are in compliance with standards 5, 33, and 44 as well. However,\nthey are not in compliance with the standards that go to the quality and effectiveness of habilitation, standards, 1,\n2, 11, and 12. They also are not in compliance with standard 43.\n5. Least Restrictive Environment and Community Facilities and\nPrograms: Mental-retardation Standards 2, 3, 4, 10, 16, 47, and 49 and\n¶ 9 of the 1986 Consent Decree\nCombined, Wyatt standards 2, 3, 4, 10, 16, 47, and 49 and ¶ 9 of the consent decree require that residents be\nhabilitated in the most integrated or least restrictive environment appropriate for their needs, based on\n1414 professional judgment.[264] Standard 2 requires *1414 \"normalization,\" that is that residents lead a life as normal\nas possible. Standard 3 states that residents shall not be admitted to institutions unless it is the least restrictive\nhabilitation setting feasible for that person, nor shall a person be admitted if community services are adequate to\nserve that person. It also provides that \"Residents shall have a right to the least restrictive conditions necessary\nto achieve the purposes of habilitation.\"\n\nLess restrictive means moving to less structured living settings, to smaller facilities and living units, and to\nindividual residences, being integrated into the community, and living as independently as possible. In summary,\nthese standards require that if a less restrictive environment (for example, a small community setting as opposed\nto a large institution) is necessary to or will achieve the purposes of habilitation, then that setting is required\nwithin reason. See, e.g., Thomas S. v. Flaherty, 902 F.2d 250, 253-54 (4th Cir.),cert. denied,498 U.S. 951, 111\n[265]\nS.Ct. 373, 112 L.Ed.2d 335 (1990).  The right asserted by the plaintiffs to be integrated or placed in the least\nrestrictive habilitation appropriate is not, as the defendants would suggest, the equivalent of outright and\nautomatic deinstitutionalization. Rather, it is quite to the contrary. As this court emphasized in 1979, the decision\nas to what setting is the most integrated or less restrictive depends on each individual's needs and should be left\nto that individual, his or her family, and his or her treating professionals. Under the consent decree, therefore, the\ndefendants were to set up a process by which the needs of the plaintiffs would be evaluated by professionals on\na case-by-case basis, and the professionals might or might not find that the minimally adequate setting for\nhabilitation for an individual plaintiff is community placement. But if they do, as they have so far done, the\ndefendants were required by the consent decree to have such facilities and programs available. The defendants\nhave not done this.\nStandards 4, 10, 16, 47, and 49 all help implement the above requirements. Standards 4 and 49 seek to prevent\ncertain inappropriate admissions. Standard 4 disallows institutionalization of borderline and mildly retarded\nindividuals, unless they have severe additional handicaps. Standard 49 prohibits institutionalization unless the \nWyatt standards are met. Under certain circumstances it allows exceptional admissions if the person will injure\n1415 himself or others, become homeless, *1415 or go to jail, in the absence of institutionalization.\nStandards 10 and 47 address residents' transitions to less restrictive community settings. Standard 10 requires\npost-institutionalization plans be developed for those with the promise of community placement. And standard 47\nrequires that \"Each resident discharged to the community shall have a program of transitional habilitation\nassistance.\"\nParagraph 9 of the consent decree essentially implements the above standards. Paragraph 9, as stated, requires\nthe defendants \"to continue to make substantial progress in placing members of the plaintiff class in community\nfacilities and programs.\"\nParagraph 9 of the consent decree and all of the above standards, with the exception of standard 4, are being\n[266]\nviolated by the defendants.  The residents' rights to the least restrictive environment have been\nreemphasized over the years. In 1979, the court reemphasized that the Wyatt mental-retardation standards\nrequired that residents be placed in the least restrictive environment appropriate to their needs and that the\ndefendants make every attempt to move residents from segregated living environments into integrated\ncommunity living environments to the extent necessary to achieve the purposes of habilitation, as these purposes\nare defined by the defendants' own professionals. The defendants sought in the early 1980s to be relieved from\nthis requirement based on developments in the law, but in 1986 agreed through bargaining with the plaintiffs to\nretain this requirement. Indeed, in ¶ 9 of the 1986 consent decree, the defendants committed themselves to\ndeveloping a whole range of community facilities and programs to implement the Wyatt standards' Wyatt\nrequirement of a less restrictive environment where determined by professionals to be appropriate. As this court\nhas previously noted, this was one of the most important bargains struck in the settlement process. Wyatt, 811\nF.Supp. at 1540.\nThe court again emphasizes that, in discussing the least restrictive environment where appropriate, it is not\ndirecting automatic or outright deinstitutionalization; the 1986 consent decree does not, by its own force, require\nthe deinstitutionalization of any patient or any group of patients. Rather it requires that the professionals who\nwork with patients be given an informed choice to place these patients in less restrictive community settings. The\n[267]\nfield of mental retardation has progressed dramatically since this litigation began in 1970.  Today\nprofessionals have the capacity to develop community facilities and programs for even the most severely\n[268]\nmentally retarded.  Therefore, many residents in the defendants' developmental centers could live in the\n[269]\ncommunity settings given the appropriate supports and services.  This does not mean that mentally-retarded\n\nindividuals are turned out of institutions onto the street with no appropriate support or services, but rather that\n1416 they are *1416 habilitated in smaller non-institutionalized homelier settings in the community. Indeed, the\ndefendants currently provide supports and services to seriously disabled individuals in their communities00for\n97\nexample, those with complex medical, physical, and behavior needs, such as individuals who have seizure\ndisorders, are dually diagnosed, require behavior plans, and use a wheelchair and/or have communication\n[270]\ndisorders.  And the department has started to work towards developing community placements as required\nby the 1986 consent decree. In its five-year plan covering the period from October 1, 1993 to October 1, 1995,\nthe department had plans to place 570 institutional residents in the community, reducing its institutional mental-\n[271]\nretardation population by almost one-half.\nHowever, the fact remains that the defendants did little to nothing to move residents into the community from\n[272]\n1986 until 1992.  In fact, the Alabama Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation admitted many\n[273]\nindividuals into its institutions during this time-period because of a lack of community alternatives.\nProfessional decisions not to outplace individuals during this time period were not driven by \"professional\"\nevaluations based on individual needs but rather by the lack of community alternatives with appropriate supports.\n[274]\nThe defendants' efforts at community placements did not begin in earnest until after they filed their motion for\nfinding of compliance and for termination of this litigation. The fact also remains that hundreds of individuals still\nremain institutionalized in the defendants' facilities for no apparent or good reason.\nIn addition, there are no selection criteria for the 570 residents actually selected for community placement.\n[275]\nNothing distinguishes them from the hundreds who remain in the defendants' institutions.  The process of\n[276]\nselection is fairly arbitrary.  Indeed, it appears that those who remain in the state's institutions are the less\n[277]\nproblematic residents, who are less disabled than those outplaced.  In fact, the institutionalized residents are\n[278]\ngenerally less disabled than the national norm for institutionalized individuals.\n1417 *1417 Furthermore, less restrictive settings, such as community residential placements, where appropriate\nservices and supports are provided, tend to enable greater growth in skills and development for mentally-retarded\n[279]\nindividuals; whereas institutionalized settings can have adverse effects.  Community settings provide a\nmultitude of opportunities for modeling behavior and learning skills that are simply not available in institutions.\n[280]\n And it costs on average twice as much to serve an individual with mental retardation in a state-operated\n[281]\ninstitution as compared to serving that individual in the community.\nFor all of the above reasons, the court concludes that the defendants' failure to offer those persons, whom they\nhave institutionalized, an informed choice to live in less restrictive community settings where there is a\nprofessional determination that such is appropriate violates the 1986 consent decree. An \"informed choice\" might\ninclude the opportunity to visit community sites, talk with the providers, talk with the other consumers, visit\n[282]\ncommunity workshops and jobs, and have a trial placement in the living arrangement.  Habilitation and\nnormalization require that the plaintiffs have this choice. Because of the defendants' failure to comply with the\ndecree, hundreds of residents are unnecessarily institutionalized. Thus, the defendants are not in compliance\nwith mental-retardation standards 2, 3, 10, 16, 47, and 49 and with ¶ 9 of the consent decree.\n6. Medication, Medical Care, and Restraint: Mental-retardation\nStandards 6, 13, 22, 26, and 45\n[283]\nStandards 6, 13, and 45 require that residents receive adequate medical care.  The court has already found\n[284]\ncompliance with standard 45 and for the most part the defendants comply with standards 6 and 13.\n[285]\nStandard 22 addresses medication practices.  It requires that certain professional procedures be followed 00\n97\n1418 for example, that no *1418 medication be administered unless at the written order of a physician and that\n\npharmacists be employed. It also requires that residents not be unnecessarily medicated with psychotropic drugs\nor given medications as a substitute for adequate habilitation, for the convenience of staff, or as a punishment.\nThe defendants comply in general with most of standard 22, with the exception of subsections (c) and (d), which\naddress unnecessary medication and medication being used as a substitute for habilitation. Because of\ninadequate behavioral programming for maladaptive behaviors, residents are subjected to unnecessary\n[286] [287]\nmedications.  And high dosages of psychotropic medications are not always adequately justified.  With\nthese exceptions noted, the court finds compliance with the medical care and medication standards.\n[288]\nStandard 26 addresses physical restraint of residents.  The standard requires that residents not be\nrestrained unless absolutely necessary to protect the resident or others from harm. Alternative techniques must\nhave failed before it is used, and it cannot be used as a substitute for habilitation, for the convenience of staff, or\nas punishment. The standard sets for a number of rules that must be followed before using restraints and once a\nrestraint is used. The court finds compliance with this standard.\n1419  7. Adequate Staffing: Mental-retardation Standards 39, 40, and 41\n*1419\nStandards 39, 40, and 41 require that the defendants provide sufficient staffing to enable adequate habilitation.\n[289]\n The standards go to staff qualifications, supervision, and staff ratios. Standard 39 requires that staff meet\nlicensing and certification requirements, that staff receive appropriate orientation training, and that staff be\nsupervised by qualified mental retardation professionals or QMRPs. Under standard 40, each resident care\nworker must under the direct professional supervision of a QMRP. And standard 41 states, in part, that: \"Qualified\n[290]\nstaff in numbers sufficient to administer adequate habilitation shall be provided.\"\nAs for the supervision, qualification, and certification requirements, the defendants are in compliance and have\n[291]\nthus satisfied standards 39 and 40.  However, as for sufficient numbers of staff, standard 41, the defendants\nare not in compliance. The defendants fail to provide staff in sufficient numbers and sufficiently trained to\n[292]\nimplement adequate habilitation.  Staffing, for example, is inadequate to give residents training in social and\n[293]\nself-care skills at meals.  And for certain patients, the lack of staffing at meal times places them at risk for\n[294]\nchoking, which can be fatal.  Those staff that are available often are inadequately trained to implement\n[295]\nhabilitation plans in a manner consistent with minimal professional standards.  Furthermore, insufficient\n1420 staffing also places residents in danger and *1420 leads to unnecessary injuries and abuse.[296] Large numbers\n[297]\nof unexplained injuries are often due to inadequate staffing.  And patients with severe behavioral problems\n[298]\nwho require one-to-one supervision do not always receive the required supervision.  This can place them at\nserious risk of injury to themselves and others. For example, one patient sexually abused other patients when he\n[299]\nwas supposed to be on one-to-one supervision, and others have suffered serious injuries.  One resident bled\nto death after being beaten by another resident. He probably would not have died if he had received prompt\nmedical attention, but the staff person responsible for that area was simply not there for most of that evening.\n[300]\n Staffing is often simply insufficient to enable adequate habilitation, monitoring, and care for residents, and\n[301]\nto ensure safety.\nDespite knowledge of inadequate staffing 00from requests by current staff for additional help, advocacy monitoring\n97\nreports, and investigations of deaths and incidents00the Alabama Department of Mental Health and Mental\n97\n[302]\nRetardation has failed to act.  The defendants contend that Title XIX certification means they have sufficient\n[303]\nstaffing despite these complaints and numerous incidents.  However, as the court has already explained in\nits discussion of Title XIX certification, such certification does not, by itself, mean that residents are minimally\nadequate care as defined in the 1986 consent decree. It only means that the hospital is being reimbursed by\nMedicaid.\n\n8. Protection From Harm/Abuse and Neglect: Mental-retardation\nStandards 15, 27, and 28\nPerhaps most significantly, aside from the fact that many residents need not even be institutionalized, is the fact\nthat residents are subjected to unexcused abuse and neglect in the defendants' institutions. They are not safe\nand are frequently abused and neglected. Staff members punch, hit, and kick defenseless mentally-retarded\nresidents. Furthermore, failure to adequately staff residences leads to abuse and unnecessary injuries. Even\nmore egregious is the fact that the defendants' know about these problems, and yet fail to correct them.\nStandards 15, 27, and 28 all require the defendants to provide a safe environment for the residents in their\n[304]\ninstitutions as does the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution. Youngberg v. Romeo, 457\n1421 U.S. 307, 324, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 2462, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982). Standard 15 states that *1421 \"Residents have a\nright to dignity, privacy and humane care.\" This is violated in that residents are abused and neglected. Standard\n27 states that \"Corporal punishment shall not be permitted.\" Residents are beaten and abused by staff in\n[305]\nviolation of this standard.  And standard 28 prohibits mistreatment, neglect, or abuse of residents. It also\nrequires that violations be reported and thoroughly investigated. This standard is also not met.\nResidents are not safe: they are subject to inexcusable abuse and neglect, due to inadequate staffing and actual\n[306]\nabuse by staff.  This includes unexplained injuries, physical abuse by staff, verbal abuse, and neglect. Some\nof the injuries are simply the result of failure to staff adequately and failure to provide appropriate programming to\n[307]\nresidents.  For example, at Wallace, staff fail to adequately monitor patients with pica, a self-injurious\n[308]\nbehavior of eating inedible objects.  They also fail to provide appropriate behavior programs for such\n[309]\nbehavior, which is treatable.  Other incidents of abuse are due to simple and pure staff abuse. For example,\n1422 an undercover investigation at *1422 Ireland led to indictments of 24 Ireland staff for patient abuse. Staff\n[310]\nmembers were charged with kicking and striking residents and hitting them with brushes and metal rods.  At\n[311]\nWallace abuse and neglect are also rampant.  One resident suffered 140 documented injuries in less than\ntwo years, including fractures, lacerations, bites, and beatings with a shoe, mainly at the hands of another\n[312]\nresident.  Yet nothing was done to protect this resident from these repeated injuries. Residents are also not\n[313]\nprotected from other residents who are known sexual abusers.\nNot only are residents abused, neglected, and not safe but the investigation system has numerous flaws and is\n[314]\nineffective at correcting and reducing risk of injury and abuse.  Investigations of injuries and abuse are\nconducted by departmental police and are inappropriately focused on the narrow issue of whether criminal\n[315]\nactivity occurred and whether any statutes were violated.  Investigators are not trained in evaluating witness\nstatements and evidence. Little to no analysis is conducted of findings. Thus, investigations fail to identify ways to\nprevent problems from occurring again. As a result, residents are needlessly subject to repeated abuse over and\nover of the same sort. Review by quality assurance has failed to correct these grave deficiencies. An even\ngreater problem is intimidation of employee-witnesses by other employees leading to a significant under reporting\n[316]\nof incidents.  It is telling that the abuse uncovered in the Ireland undercover operation was not reported to\ninvestigators by other staff, despite occurring in front of other staff.\nThe department's refusal to investigate anonymous allegations of abuse and neglect also dramatically reduces\n[317]\nthe number of incidents investigated or reported.  And the failure to bring in independent investigators leads\nto inadequate corrective measures and investigations. It is often a case of the \"fox guarding the chicken house.\"\n[318]\n Furthermore, the department's refusal to investigate at all in some incidents is simply unjustified. A former\npolice officer witnessed a staff member slapping a six-year-old resident, reported the abuse, but nothing was\n[319]\ndone.  This staff member who struck the child remained at Ireland until she was arrested in the undercover\n[320]\noperation.\n\n1423 The defendants have been on notice of the problems with their investigatory system for *1423 some time.[321]\n[322]\nYet, they have failed to take action to correct it.  This failure is especially egregious in light of the defendants'\n[323]\nknowledge of abuse in their institutions.  Also inexcusable is the defendants' failure to inform parents of\n[324]\nvictims of injuries and investigation results.\nIn summary, the court finds as follows:\n(1) The defendants are in compliance with the following Wyatt mental-retardation standards: 4\n(borderline, mildly MR not institutionalized), 5 (educational services), 6 (prompt and adequate\nmedical treatment), 7 (pre-admission examination/diagnosis required), 8 (evaluation within 14\ndays of admission), 9 (individualized habilitation plan), 13 (entitlement to physical care), 14\n(records maintained; kept confidential), 17 (no incompetency by reason of commitment), 18\n(religion), 19 (telephone/visitation rights), 20 (send/receive mail), 21 (interaction with opposite\nsex), 22(a)-(b), (e)-(g) (medication: unnecessary, excessive, review, etc.), 23 (no seclusion; \"time-\nout\" ok), 24 (behavior modification only with consent), 25 (electric shock only for extraordinary\ncircumstances), 26 (physical restraint only when absolutely necessary, etc.), 29 (no experimental\ntreatment without consent), 30 (no unusual or hazardous treatment without consent), 31 (physical\nexercise), 32 (outdoors at regular intervals), 33 (resident labor, etc.), 34(a) & (c-d) (nutritional\nstandards, diet, etc.), 36 (personal possessions), 39 (staff licensing and certification\nrequirements), 40 (QMRP supervision of staff), 44 (behavior modification, etc.), and 45 (no organ\nremoval).\n(2) They are not in compliance with the following standards: 1 (general right to habilitation), 2\n(habilitation program to maximize abilities), 3 (admission standards: habilitation is feasible, etc.),\n10 (post-institutionalization plan), 11 (QMRP supervision of plan), 12 (plan reviewed by QMRP,\nteam, etc.), 15 (dignity, privacy, humane care), 16 (no state/federal rights lost), 22(c)-(d)\n(medication: unnecessary, excessive, review, etc.), 27 (no corporal punishment), 28 (no\nmistreatment, abuse, neglect), 34(b) (nutritional standards, diet, etc.), 35 (clothing allowance,\nselection, etc.), 37 (grooming practices, etc.), 38 (humane environment, facilities, etc.), 41 (staffing\nratios), 42 (written copy of standards upon admission), 43 (written reports every 6 months), 47\n(transitional habilitation program), and 49 (no admission to institution not meeting above\n[325]\nstandards, etc).\nD. JCAHO Accreditation and Title XIX Certification\nThe defendants have obtained JCAHO accreditation at all their mental-illness facilities and Title XIX certification\nat all their mental-retardation facilities. While they were less than diligent in obtaining JCAHO accreditation at the\nEufaula Adolescent Center, the defendants have maintained accreditation and certification at all of their other\nfacilities. The court finds full compliance with JCAHO and Title XIX provisions in the 1986 consent decree.\n1424  E. Other Provisions in the 1986 Consent Decree\n*1424\nThe 1986 consent decree also requires that the plaintiffs and the defendants \"cooperate to establish\" the\nfollowing:\n(1) \"A process by which the private plaintiffs' counsel will be apprised of the progress made by the\ndefendants toward the ends described in paragraphs 7, 8, and 9\" of the consent decree, Wyatt,\n1986 WL 69194, at *8, that is, in complying with the Wyatt standards (¶ 7), in obtaining JCAHO\naccreditation and Title XIX certification (¶ 8), and in placing plaintiff class members in community\nprograms and facilities (¶ 9), Wyatt, 1986 WL 69194, at *7;\n\n(2) \"A process by which the defendants will continue to receive input from independent experts\nconcerning means of achieving the ends described in paragraphs 7, 8, and 9,\" Wyatt, 1986 WL\n69194, at *8;\n(3) \"A patient advocate system, operated within and by the Alabama Department of Mental Health\nand Mental Retardation, to help protect the rights of the plaintiff class,\" id.; and\n(4) \"A quality assurance system operated by the central office of the Alabama Department of\nMental Health and Retardation to monitor and assure the quality of care provided by the\nDepartment.\" Id.\nThe defendants have failed to comply in full with the first and second requirements. With their sudden and\nsummary dismissal of The Wyatt Consultant Committee and their breach of their agreement with Sundram, they\nhave demonstrated a bad-faith breach of these provisions. The defendants have, however, complied with the\nother two requirements.\nF. Conclusions as to Defendants' Motion for Finding that They Have\nMet Their Obligations under the 1986 Consent Decree and for\nTermination of Litigation\nThe court now turns to the critical issue of whether the defendants should be released in whole or in part from the\n1986 consent decree, and, if in whole, whether this litigation should be terminated. As stated, the considerations\narticulated by the Supreme Court in Dowell and Freeman, reformulated to apply in general to state institutions\nthat are subject to detailed remedial decrees, are as follows. A federal court, in its discretion, may dissolve a\ndecree in full and terminate the litigation if the court finds such to be appropriate in light of the following\nconsiderations: first, whether the conditions that gave rise to the need for the litigation have been fully remedied,\nand, second, whether the state defendants have complied in good faith with the decree as a whole since it was\nentered. Alternatively, a federal court, in its discretion, may order an incremental or partial release from a decree\nif it determines that such is appropriate in light of the following considerations: first, whether there has been full\nand satisfactory compliance with the decree in those aspects of the system where supervision is to be withdrawn;\nsecond, whether retention of judicial control in those aspects of the system is not necessary or practicable to\nachieve compliance with the decree in other facets of the system; and, third, whether the state defendants have\ndemonstrated their good-faith commitment to the whole of the court's decree and to those provisions of the law\nand the Constitution that were the predicate for judicial intervention in the first instance.\nIn considering whether to order full, partial, or no release, a court should give particular attention to the state\ndefendants' record of compliance. State defendants are better positioned to demonstrate their good-faith\ncommitment to the decree when their policies and actions form a consistent pattern of lawful conduct in\ncompliance with the decree.\nThe common consideration in determining whether release should be either full or partial is whether the\ndefendants have acted in good faith with regard to the whole of the decree. In making this determination, the\ncourt must keep in mind that, as previously indicated, the consent decree's underlying purpose \"was not simply to\nestablish the plaintiffs' rights to constitutionally adequate services,\" Wyatt, 803 F.Supp. at 385, for \"[t]hat claim\n1425 had been litigated in 1972 and resolved in favor of the plaintiffs.\" Id.; see*1425also Wyatt, 811 F.Supp. at 1540.\nIn the years leading up to the consent decree, the defendants made vigorous and repeated contentions that, in\nlight of present and future changes in the law, the Wyatt standards00in particular, as interpreted by the plaintiffs to\n97\nrequire the provision of new and additional community facilities and services and the community placement of\nthose patients who qualify based on professional judgment00 then exceeded the requirements of federal statutory\n97\nand constitutional law. Id. They based their attack on a 1982 Supreme Court decision, Youngberg v. Romeo, 457\nU.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982), and its progeny, which they strenuously argued cast doubt on\nthe continuing validity of the least-restrictive-environment and other requirements embodied in the standards. In\n1986, with the entry of the consent decree and in return for the court's release of active supervision of the\n\nAlabama Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation, the defendants agreed to put to rest, by\nabandoning, their dispute over whether, in light of developing law, the Wyatt standards (including the requirement\nof providing additional community facilities and programs and the placement of patients in communities if they\nqualify based on professional judgment) could be maintained as a condition for vindication of the plaintiffs' rights,\nand thus they further agreed to put to rest what was necessary to establish when the conditions that gave rise to\nthe need for the litigation had been fully remedied; instead, they agreed to the overall objective mandate that the\ndefendants were to comply in full with all provisions in the consent decree, including each and every one of the \nWyatt standards and the requirements that the defendants \"raise capital funds to provide needed community\nplacements and services\" and \"continue to make substantial progress in placing members of the plaintiff class in\ncommunity facilities and programs.\" Wyatt, 1986 WL 69194, at *7.\nThus, as previously stated, the disputes resolved by the 1986 consent decree focused on three different issues:\n(1) the defendants' request to terminate court supervision of the state system; (2) the plaintiffs' concern about the\ncontinued viability of the Wyatt standards in the face of constitutional challenge; and (3) the plaintiffs' efforts to\nfocus the litigation on the provision of community facilities and services and the placement of patients in those\nfacilities. The final decree reflected a balancing of these concerns and the trade-offs made by both sides in the\n[326]\nresulting compromise. The parties were well aware of the trade offs they were making,  and the\nmemorandum opinion accompanying the decree in 1986 noted the competing concerns animating the consent\ndecree and the trade-offs accepted by each side. Id.; see also Wyatt, 811 F.Supp. at 1540; Wyatt, 803 F.Supp. at\n385-87.\nTherefore, even if the requirements placed on defendants by the consent decree00implementation of the Wyatt\n97\nstandards, including providing new and additional community facilities and services and placement of patients in\nthese facilities if they qualify based on professional judgment00exceeded the bare minimum of constitutional care\n97\nrequired by the constitution, and, in particular by Youngberg, this fact is, by itself, of no moment. In other words,\nwhether the decree exceeds the minimum or not is irrelevant, because the consent decree is legally valid. Parties\nmay agree in a consent decree to more extensive relief than a court would have ordered absent settlement. Suter\nv. Artist M., 503 U.S. 347, 354 n.6, 112 S.Ct. 1360, 1365 n. 6, 118 L.Ed.2d 1 (1992); Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk\nCounty Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 389-90, 112 S.Ct. 748, 762-63, 116 L.Ed.2d 867 (1992); see also Local Number 93,\nInternat'l Ass'n of Firefighters v. Cleveland, 478 U.S. 501, 525-26, 106 S.Ct. 3063, 3077, 92 L.Ed.2d 405 (1986).\nThe agreed relief may go beyond the constitutional floor as long as the relief ordered is \"related to\" correcting\nunconstitutional conditions. Rufo, 502 U.S. at 389, 112 S.Ct. at 763. In this case, the consent decree, including\nthe Wyatt standards and the requirement of providing of new and additional community facilities and services and\n1426 the placement of patients in communities, were all ordered in order to *1426 correct the violation of constitutional\nrights at state facilities for the mentally ill and retarded. Wyatt, 344 F.Supp. 373; id.,344 F.Supp. 387.\nThe court recognizes that the commitments in the 1986 consent decree are not absolutes and that they are\nconstrained, first, by simple practicalities, such as administrative and budgetary problems and, second, by other\nappropriate state interests. For example, the state cannot simply shut down its large facilities and then build\ncommunity facilities, for, in the interim, patients would have no where to seek treatment and the disruption to the\nstaff would be monumental. Moreover, even the degree to which the state should focus on community facilities\nand programs to the exclusion of large institutions is not explicit under the consent decree, and, indeed, turns on\nthe degree to which the state's own professionals, in the exercise of their sound judgment, decide that patients\ncan and should live in these community settings. But the requirement that the defendants are to move to such\nsettings those patients who qualify based on the judgment of the defendants' own professionals is settled by the\nentry of the consent decree (regardless as to whether it was required by the Constitution) and is no longer\ndebatable.\nIndeed, this obligation is longstanding, reaching far back beyond the 1986 consent decree. In 1979, the court\nwrote: \"Although the minimum constitutional standards require defendants to provide community facilities and\nservices when an individual's habilitation demands such treatment, they do not remove from the professional\njudgment of qualified staff members the decisions regarding the appropriateness of community placement. In this\nrespect the Court does not believe the standards should be modified.\" Wyatt v. Ireland, No. 3195-N, 1979 WL\n48254, at *4 (M.D.Ala.1979) (Johnson, J.). The court then concluded: \"From the evidence it is clear that there is\ndebate within the profession concerning the beneficial effects of community placement for the severely and\n\nprofoundly retarded. The Court will not choose sides in this debate. Nor should it.\" Id. at *5. Similarly, today, the\ncourt will still not enter the debate, for that is a matter for professional judgment. But once the state itself has\ndetermined based on professional judgment that a patient qualifies for a community setting00as is true in case\n97\nafter case in the Alabama Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation System00the court has long made\n97\nclear that \"the minimum constitutional standards require defendants to provide community facilities and services.\"\nId. at *4.\nHere, against this background, the court must conclude that the defendants have acted in good faith with regard\nto some but not the whole of the decree. The following circumstances prevent the court from concluding that the\ndefendants have acted in good faith with regard to whole of the decree:\n(1) The defendants have failed to comply with Wyatt mental-illness standards 1 (privacy and\ndignity), 2 (least restrictive conditions), 4 (visitation rights), 6 (freedom from unnecessary\nmedication), 7 (freedom from seclusion/physical restraint), 14 (physical exercise), 15 (outdoors at\nregular intervals), 16 (religion), 19 (humane environment; facilities; etc.), 23 (supervision of staff,\npatient treatment), 26 (individualized treatment plan, etc.), 31 (confidentiality of records, etc.), 34\n(transitional treatment post-release), and 35 (written notice of mental-illness standards). In many\ninstances, this failure has been substantial and long standing.\n(2) The defendants have failed to comply with Wyatt mental-retardation standards 1 (general right\nto habilitation), 2 (habilitation program to maximize abilities), 3 (admission standards: habilitation\nis feasible, etc.), 10 (post-institutionalization plan), 11 (QMRP supervision of plan), 12 (plan\nreviewed by QMRP, team, etc.), 15 (dignity, privacy, humane care), 16 (no state/federal rights\nlost), 22(c)-(d) (medication: unnecessary, excessive, review, etc.), 27 (no corporal punishment), 28\n(no mistreatment, abuse, neglect), 34(b) (nutritional standards, diet, etc.), 35 (clothing allowance,\n1427 selection, etc.), 37 (grooming practices, etc.), 38 (humane environment, *1427 facilities, etc.), 41\n(staffing ratios), 42 (written copy of standards upon admission), 43 (written reports every 6\nmonths), 47 (transitional habilitation program), and 49 (no admission to institution not meeting\nabove standards, etc.). In many instances, this failure has been substantial and long standing.\n(3) The defendants have failed to comply with the provisions in the consent decree requiring that\nthey provide additional and new community facilities and programs and for the placement of\npatients in these facilities and programs to the extent they qualify based on professional judgment.\n(4) The defendants exposed children at the Eufaula Adolescent Center to grave and serious\ndanger. Their reaction to the information was to deny it, without investigation.\n(5) The defendants breached their agreement for Sundram to do a comprehensive review of the\nsystem. The defendants' reaction to critical reports was to get rid of the reporter.\n(6) The defendants sudden and summary dismissal of the Wyatt Consultant Committee. Again,\nthe defendants' reaction to critical reports was to get rid of the reporter.\n(7) The defendants misrepresented in letters to plaintiff class members and their guardians,\ncaretakers, and next-of-kin that the plaintiff class and their attorneys sought to close state facilities\nand force patients out without any community support services.\n(8) The defendants were less than diligent in obtaining JCAHO accreditation at the Eufaula\nAdolescent Center, and they even actually suspended it without court approval.\nThese are only some of the circumstances; they are not all.\nAt first blush00because good faith with regard to the whole of the decree is a common consideration in\n97\ndetermining whether release should be full or partial00it would appear that this factual finding would preclude\n97\nrelease of the defendants either partially or wholly. However, three circumstances lead the court to a different\nconclusion.\n\nFirst, the Supreme Court made clear in Dowell and Freeman that the considerations it articulated are just that,\n\"considerations.\" They should inform the trial court's decision; they were not characterized as inflexible\nrequirements.\nSecond, the Court also emphasized that partial release may have an important practical value in itself: \"By\nwithdrawing control over areas where judicial supervision is no longer needed, a district court can concentrate\nboth its own resources and those of the school district on the areas where the effects of de jure discrimination\nhave not been eliminated and further action is necessary in order to provide real and tangible relief to minority\nstudents.\" Freeman, 503 U.S. at 493, 112 S.Ct. at 1447. The physical size of this litigation00the number of\n97\nfacilities and the number of employees00has grown so much since the inception of this litigation that in many ways\n97\nthe case today resembles very little the one that was filed. Indeed, part of the problem in litigation of this size has\nbeen management alone; maintaining a hold on the whole of the institution at the same time may now be simply\nimpractical. The court is therefore convinced that it would be of benefit to all if this case could be downsized and\nthe issues narrowed so that all can concentrate their limited time and resources to only those areas where further\naction is necessary under the decree.\nThird and finally, the defendants must be strongly credited for having brought the Alabama Department of Mental\nHealth and Mental Retardation a long way. They have demonstrated substantial and good-faith compliance with\nmajor provisions in the 1986 consent decree. These include the following:\n(1) The defendants have complied with Wyatt mental-illness standards 3 (no incompetency by\nreason of commitment), 5 (send/receive mail), 8 (experimental research), 9 (lobotomy/averse\nconditioning, etc.), 10 (prompt and adequate medical treatment), 11 (wear own clothes; keep\n1428 possessions), 12 (clothing allowance, selection), 13 (laundering *1428 of clothes), 17 (interaction\nwith members of opposite sex), 18 (patient labor, etc.), 20 (nutritional standards), 21 (staff\nlicensing and certification requirements), 22 (orientation training for nonprofessional staff), 24\n(minimum number of treatment personnel), 25 (patient exams following admission), 30\n(entitlement to physical care), and 32 (special provisions for children, young adults).\n(2) They have complied with Wyatt mental-retardation standards 4 (borderline, mildly MR not\ninstitutionalized), 5 (educational services), 6 (prompt and adequate medical treatment), 7 (pre-\nadmission examination/diagnosis required), 8 (evaluation within 14 days of admission), 9\n(individualized habilitation plan), 13 (entitlement to physical care), 14 (records maintained; kept\nconfidential), 17 (no incompetency by reason of commitment), 18 (religion), 19 (telephone/\nvisitation rights), 20 (send/receive mail), 21 (interaction with opposite sex), 22(a)-(b), (e)-(g)\n(medication: unnecessary, excessive, review, etc.), 23 (no seclusion; \"time-out\" ok), 24 (behavior\nmodification only with consent), 25 (electric shock only for extraordinary circumstances), 26\n(physical restraint only when absolutely necessary, etc.), 29 (no experimental treatment without\nconsent), 30 (no unusual or hazardous treatment without consent), 31 (physical exercise), 32\n(outdoors at regular intervals), 33 (resident labor, etc.), 34(a) & (c-d) (nutritional standards, diet,\netc.), 36 (personal possessions), 39 (staff licensing and certification requirements), 40 (QMRP\nsupervision of staff), 44 (behavior modification, etc.), and 45 (no organ removal).\n(3) They have obtained JCAHO accreditation at all their mental-illness facilities and Title XIX\ncertification at all their mental-retardation facilities.\nFor all of the above reasons, the court concludes that defendants should be released from the 1986 consent\ndecree to extent that they have complied with these provisions. The defendants' motion for finding that they have\nmet their obligations under the 1986 consent decree and for termination of litigation will be granted to this extent.\nAlthough the defendants have complied with requirements in the consent decree that they \"cooperate\" with\nplaintiffs to establish \"A patient advocate system, operated within and by the Alabama Department of Mental\nHealth and Mental Retardation, to help protect the rights of the plaintiff class,\" Wyatt, 1986 WL 69194, *8, and \"A\nquality assurance system operated by the central office of the Alabama Department of Mental Health and\nRetardation to monitor and assure the quality of care provided by the Department,\" id., the court exercises its\n\ndiscretion to decline to release the defendants from these two requirements at this time for three reasons. First,\nthe sudden and arbitrary manner in which defendants terminated the Wyatt Consultant Committee casts doubt on\nwhether, in the absence of the these requirements, the defendants would maintain such oversight or something\ncomparable to it. Second, the evidence reflects00for example, with the problems at the Eufaula Adolescent Center\n97\n00that defendants simply do not respond well to outside criticism, and attempt to resolve matters by attempting get\n97\nrid of the messenger rather than address the problem. Third and finally, these two requirements are so\n\"intertwined or synergistic in their relation,\" Freeman, 503 U.S. at 497, 112 S.Ct. at 1449, with all other\nsubstantive provisions in the consent decree that it would not prudent at this time to release the defendants from\nthem while there are so many substantive requirements they have yet to satisfy fully.\nThe court considered releasing the defendants facility-by-facility rather than standard-by-standard, but such\nwould have resulted in the release of no facilities in whole. The court also considered partial release by facility\nand by standard00such that one facility could be released as to a standard without releasing another facility as to\n97\nthat standard 00but the court believes that this approach would be too small-scaled, in that the focus would not be\n97\n1429 on the system-wide operation of a standard, a view that would help assure that compliance was truly the result \n*1429 of systemic reform rather than the fortuity of the energy and good work of one facility manager. Moreover, if\nthis approach were broadened to include the entire system, the approach would become confusing and time-\nconsuming, for whenever the court narrowly reviewed compliance with a particular standard in a particular facility,\nthe court would still always have to look at system-wide systemic compliance, and, as a result, the reviews would\nbe often redundant. Going standard-by-standard appears to be a practical and reasonable compromise, for it\nallows incremental and partial release, but from a system-wide, and thus systemic, perspective.\nIn their pretrial brief, throughout trial, and in their posttrial brief, the defendants argued that JCAHO accreditation\nand Title XIX certification were the equivalent of compliance with the Wyatt standards and the rest of the 1986\nconsent decree, and that the court could not require more. They essentially repeated the arguments made in their\npleadings filed in the years leading up to the consent decree. The court rejected these arguments then, and now\nrejects them again. JCAHO accreditation and Title XIX certification, in and of themselves, do not demonstrate\n[327]\ncompliance with the Wyatt standards or, for that matter, constitutionally required treatment.\nFirst, JCAHO accreditation and Title XIX certification were only one element of the multifaceted 1986 consent\ndecree. Thus, JCAHO accreditation and Title XIX certification, albeit important elements of compliance with the\ndecree, are not the equivalent of compliance with all important and basic aspects of the consent decree. Second,\nas previously emphasized by this court, the defendants' argument that achievement of JCAHO accreditation and\nTitle XIX certification is full proof of compliance with all Wyatt standards and other important aspects of the\ndecree conflicts with the intent behind the decree. In the round of litigation leading up to the decree, the\ndefendants expressly requested that the court replace the Wyatt standards with an order requiring JCAHO\n[328]\naccreditation and Title XIX certification.  With its approval of the 1986 consent decree, the defendants\nabandoned this argument and, instead, agreed to the continued preservation of the Wyatt standards and to the\nprovision of community facilities and programs and the placement of qualifying patients in these facilities and\nprograms. This abandonment was a part of the trade they made, and they are still bound by it. The defendants'\nasserted reliance on accreditation and certification as constituting substantial compliance with the Wyatt\nstandards essentially repeats an argument they, by agreement, abandoned in return for the 1986 consent decree.\nMoreover, after hearing and reviewing much evidence on what JCAHO accreditation and Title XIX certification\nmean substantively, the court is convinced that, while accreditation and certification may be important evidence of\ncompliance, they are not the equivalent of, or a substitute for, compliance with the 1986 consent decree or with\nminimal constitutional standards. JCAHO, as previously stated, is an independent organization of health care\nprofessionals which promulgates national standards for health care facilities. In order to become accredited a\n[329]\nhospital undergoes an on-site survey at least every three years.  A team of doctors, nurses, and\nadministrators evaluates the facility on hundreds of standards and through a very complicated scoring process\n[330]\ndetermines the score a hospital receives.  But accreditation means nothing more than that the hospital meets\nJCAHO's minimal standards as evaluated by the surveying team. The fact, for example, that the Eufaula\nAdolescent Center received a very high JCAHO score despite its grave problems regarding the safety and abuse\nof children and its use of restraints and seclusion raises a red flag for the court as to the meaning of JCAHO\n\n1430 accreditation. The evidence demonstrated that *1430 the Eufaula Adolescent Center simply did not meet the \nWyatt standards, yet it was accredited; and, furthermore, accredited with a very high score. The evidence also\ndemonstrates that the defendants simply are not in compliance with multiple Wyatt mental-illness standards and\nother provisions in the consent decree at their other mental-illness facilities. Indeed, as demonstrated by the\nevidence the court cites to in its findings of fact, JCAHO has found multiple violations of its standards as well in\n[331]\nits surveys. Yet, all of the defendants' facilities are and remain JCAHO accredited.  An organization can\nbecome accredited and remain accredited despite findings of deficient or unsatisfactory standards of care.\nJCAHO accreditation is simply not the equivalent of compliance with the 1986 consent decree. Accord Robbins v.\nBudke, 739 F.Supp. 1479, 1481 (D.N.M.1990) (JCAHO accreditation is \"by no means an assurance that abuse\nand neglect of patients does not take place in an institution, or that patients' constitutional and statutory rights are\nbeing protected\").\n[332]\nFurthermore, the survey process itself lends itself to abuse by the institutions and is riddled with problems.\n[333]\nFacilities are notified in advance of the survey.  As a result they conduct mock surveys in preparation for the\n[334]\nactual survey and increase staffing and improve treatment at the time the survey is conducted.  The\n[335]\nsurveyors therefore do not see the facility as it really is on an average day.  While JCAHO is working to\nimprove its surveys, there is no evidence that the surveys conducted of the defendants' institutions have been\nimproved to account for all of these problems.\nAdmittedly, some courts have held that JCAHO accreditation creates a presumption of meeting minimum\nconstitutional standards of care, but the presumption may be rebutted. Thomas S. v. Flaherty, 902 F.2d 250,\n252-53 (4th Cir.),cert. denied,498 U.S. 951, 111 S.Ct. 373, 112 L.Ed.2d 335 (1990); Woe v. Cuomo, 729 F.2d\n96, 106 (2d Cir.),cert. denied,469 U.S. 936, 105 S.Ct. 339, 83 L.Ed.2d 274 (1984). Even if the court were to\naccept the defendants' accreditation as a presumption of compliance, the plaintiffs have rebutted that\npresumption, through overwhelming evidence that the defendants systematically violate certain standards.\nBut more importantly, even assuming that the evidence is insufficient to rebut the presumption that defendants\nare in compliance with minimum constitutional standards and thus that defendants had met all minimum\nconstitutional standards, it would not necessarily follow that defendants were in compliance with the 1986\nconsent decree. As stated, parties may agree in a consent decree to more extensive relief than a court would\nhave ordered absent settlement. Moreover, as stated, in 1986, with the entry of the consent decree, the parties\nput to rest their dispute over what was necessary to establish that the conditions that gave rise to the need for the\nlitigation had been fully remedied; they agreed to the overall objective mandate that the defendants were to\ncomply in full with all provisions in the consent decree, including each and every one of the Wyatt standards and\nthe provision of new and additional community facilities and programs and the placement in those facilities and\nprograms of all patients who qualify based on professional judgment. The bottom line, therefore, is whether the\ndefendants have met all the requirements of the consent decree.\nHowever, the court does not reject JCAHO accreditation as relevant evidence of compliance with the consent\n1431 decree. Indeed, the court finds that accreditation is highly relevant proof of compliance with the consent *1431\ndecree. The absence of accreditation would raise red flags regarding noncompliance. And the presence of\naccreditation, including the score and presence or absence of deficiencies and recommendations, is, and has\nbeen considered by the court as, a reassuring and relevant piece of evidence to be considered in tandem with all\nof the other relevant evidence. Cf. Dolihite v. Videon, 847 F.Supp. 918, 936 (M.D.Ala.1994) (JCAHO accreditation\nincreases the \"likelihood that professional judgments will govern individual treatment decisions within the\ninstitution\"), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 74 F.3d 1027 (11th Cir.), cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 117 S.Ct. 185, 136\nL.Ed.2d 123 (1996); but see plaintiffs' exh. IV.H. 1 at 30 (public citizen's health research group survey stating\n\"JCAHO imposes meaningful penalties so infrequently that it fails to adequately deter violations of quality\nstandards designed to safeguard the public health\").\nThe court makes similar conclusions as to the significance of Title XIX certification. It is not the equivalent of\nsubstantial compliance with the 1986 consent decree's other requirements or constitutional minimum standards.\n[336]\nIt is a necessary requirement for compliance with the standards, but not sufficient.  Title XIX requires that the\ndefendants' facilities for the mentally retarded be certified by the Health Care Finance Administration (HCFA) in\n\norder to receive Medicaid funding. Lelsz v. Kavanagh, 673 F.Supp. 828, 836-37 (N.D.Tex.1987). Surveys are\n[337]\nconducted by other state employees who work for the same Governor.  If HCFA were to decertify an\ninstitution, then that state institution would not continue to receive Medicaid funding. Thus, the incentive is to\n[338]\ncertify and institutions are rarely decertified.  Additionally, as with JCAHO accreditation, facilities deploy\n[339]\nadditional staffing and give surveyors a false impression of actual care in the facility.  Title XIX surveyors\nsimply do not gain, as much as is needed, an accurate insight into the daily reality at mental-retardation facilities.\n[340]\n And as with JCAHO, facilities can remain certified, despite findings of serious deficiencies.\nFinally, the findings in this case simply do not support the defendants' arguments. The defendants' facilities for\nthe mentally retarded are certified by Title XIX00indeed many, if not all, were certified in 1986. However, the\n97\nfindings demonstrate that the defendants are not in compliance with many crucial standards, such as safety,\nwhich not only go to the plaintiffs' rights under the 1986 consent decree, but also go to their constitutional rights.\nMany courts have considered this issue and they have all reached the same conclusion: that Title XIX is not\nevidence of meeting minimal standards. See, e.g., United States v. Illinois, 803 F.Supp. 1338, 1341 (N.D.Ill.1992);\n[341]\nUnited States v. Tennessee, 798 F.Supp. 483, 489 (W.D.Tenn.1992); Lelsz, 673 F.Supp. at 841.\nIII. PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR FURTHER RELIEF\n1432 The plaintiffs assert a number of substantive due-process rights under the fourteenth *1432 amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution, which, they contend, are incorporated into the Wyatt standards and which the\ndefendants are violating. Under the fourteenth amendment, according to the plaintiffs, involuntarily confined\nresidents and patients have rights to adequate food, shelter, clothing, medical care, and substantive liberty rights\nto safety, freedom from bodily restraint, freedom from unnecessary institutionalization and segregation from\nsociety, and minimally adequate training necessary to secure these rights. Anything that leads to the violation of\nthese rights, the plaintiffs say, is therefore a constitutional violation. For example, inadequate staffing, which\ncontributes to safety problems by allowing residents to injure themselves and others, is a constitutional violation. \nSociety for Good Will to Retarded Children, Inc. v. Cuomo, 737 F.2d 1239, 1246 (2d Cir.1984). Virtually every \nWyatt standard, they argue, goes to securing one of these constitutional rights, and, to the extent that the Wyatt\nstandards secure these rights and are violated, these violations are also constitutional violations.\nThe court's response to the plaintiffs' argument is, to the extent they seek relief outside the four corners of the\n1986 consent decree, the same as its response to the defendants' argument to the extent it is of like kind. With\nthe 1986 consent decree, the parties gave flesh to what the fourteenth amendment required, and they agreed to\nwhat the amendment required, and no more and no less. The court therefore sees no need to address the\nplaintiffs' constitutional argument separately. Moreover, in Wyatt v. Rogers, 92 F.3d 1074 (11th Cir.1996), the\nEleventh Circuit Court of Appeals made clear what the plaintiffs needed to do to seek relief under the consent\ndecree. The plaintiffs' request for relief directly under the Constitution could be viewed as an improper way to get\n[342]\naround this approach.\nThe plaintiffs also assert rights under the ADA to services00that is housing, treatment, habilitation, and the like00in\n97 97\nthe most integrated environment appropriate to their needs. The defendants argue that the ADA does not provide\nthe plaintiffs this right.\nThe ADA is a comprehensive piece of civil rights legislation intended to guarantee Americans with disabilities an\n[343]\nend to exclusion and segregation and, instead, inclusion and integration into society.  Title II of the ADA\nprohibits state and local governments from discriminating on the basis of a disability in the provision of services.\nThe regulations implementing Title II require that all services be administered in the most integrated environment\nappropriate. 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d). Integration is that which \"enables individuals with disabilities to interact with\nnon-disabled individuals to the fullest extent possible.\" 28 C.F.R. pt. 35, App. A at 452. The plaintiffs contend that\n1433 the defendants are violating this law by failing to expand sufficiently Alabama's integrated *1433 community\nplacement program and, thereby, keeping hundreds of mentally retarded and mentally ill patients in segregated\nstate institutions when those patients could and should be placed in integrated community-based programs. The\ndefendants, however, contend that, as a matter of law, the ADA simply does not guarantee the mentally retarded\n\nor mentally ill the right to be placed in the community. And, they further contend, even if the ADA did give the\nplaintiffs rights to community-based placements, the change to their current services would be so fundamental\nand the burden so great that the ADA would not require them to make this change. Thus there are two parts to\nthe court's inquiry. First, it must determine whether the plaintiffs have a right to integrated services under the\nADA. If they do, the court turns to the second part of its inquiry to determine whether the plaintiffs are entitled to\n[344]\nrelief.\nThere are cases that support both the plaintiffs' and the defendants' positions. See, e.g., Helen L. v. DiDario, 46\nF.3d 325, 337-39 (3d Cir.),cert. denied,516 U.S. 813, 116 S.Ct. 64, 133 L.Ed.2d 26 (1995); Eric L. v. Bird, 848\nF.Supp. 303, 313-14 (D.N.H.1994); Conner v. Branstad, 839 F.Supp. 1346 (S.D.Iowa 1993); Martin v. Voinovich,\n840 F.Supp. 1175, 1190-92 (S.D.Ohio 1993); People First of Tenn. v. Arlington Developmental Center, 878\nF.Supp. 97 (W.D.Tenn.1992); Williams v. Secretary of the Executive Office of Human Services, 414 Mass. 551,\n609 N.E.2d 447 (1993). The court need not enter the fray at this time. With the 1986 consent decree, the parties\ngave flesh to what the fourteenth amendment required, and, the plaintiffs have not pointed to anything in the ADA\nthat is not already required by the consent decree. The court therefore sees no need to address the plaintiffs'\nADA argument separately. Moreover, in Wyatt v. Rogers, 92 F.3d 1074 (11th Cir.1996), the Eleventh Circuit Court\nof Appeals made clear what the plaintiffs needed to do to seek relief under the consent decree. The plaintiffs'\nrequest for relief directly under the ADA could be viewed, as could their request under the Constitution, as an\n[345]\nimproper way to get around this approach.\nIV. RELIEF\nAs stated, the court will grant, in part, the defendants' motion for finding that they have met their obligations under\nthe 1986 consent decree and for termination of litigation, and the court will deny the plaintiffs' motion for further\nrelief. The defendants will be released from the following requirements of the 1986 consent decree:\n(1) Wyatt mental-illness standards 3 (no incompetency by reason of commitment), 5 (send/receive\nmail), 8 (experimental research), 9 (lobotomy/averse conditioning, etc.), 10 (prompt and adequate\nmedical treatment), 11 (wear own clothes; keep possessions), 12 (clothing allowance, selection),\n13 (laundering of clothes), 17 (interaction with members of opposite sex), 18 (patient labor, etc.),\n20 (nutritional standards), 21 (staff licensing and certification requirements), 22 (orientation\ntraining for non-professional staff), 24 (minimum number of treatment personnel), 25 (patient\nexams following admission), 30 (entitlement to physical care), and 32 (special provisions for\nchildren, young adults).\n(2) Wyatt mental-retardation standards 4 (borderline, mildly MR not institutionalized), 5\n(educational services), 6 (prompt and adequate medical treatment), 7 (pre-admission examination/\n1434 diagnosis required), 8 (evaluation within *1434 14 days of admission), 9 (individualized habilitation\nplan), 13 (entitlement to physical care), 14 (records maintained; kept confidential), 17 (no\nincompetency by reason of commitment), 18 (religion), 19 (telephone/visitation rights), 20 (send/\nreceive mail), 21 (interaction with opposite sex), 22(a)-(b), (e)-(g) (medication: unnecessary,\nexcessive, review, etc.), 23 (no seclusion; \"time-out\" ok), 24 (behavior modification only with\nconsent), 25 (electric shock only for extraordinary circumstances), 26 (physical restraint only when\nabsolutely necessary, etc.), 29 (no experimental treatment without consent), 30 (no unusual or\nhazardous treatment without consent), 31 (physical exercise), 32 (outdoors at regular intervals),\n33 (resident labor, etc.), 34(a) & (c-d) (nutritional standards, diet, etc.), 36 (personal possessions),\n39 (staff licensing and certification requirements), 40 (QMRP supervision of staff), 44 (behavior\nmodification, etc.), and 45 (no organ removal).\n(3) JCAHO accreditation at all their mental-illness facilities and Title XIX certification at all their\nmental-retardation facilities.\nHowever, as the court has indicated throughout this memorandum opinion, there are areas where it appears that,\nsince trial, defendants should now be in compliance (for example, mental-illness standards 16 (religion) and 35\n\n(written notice of mental-illness standards) and mental-retardation standards 22(c) & (d) (medication:\nunnecessary, excessive, review, etc.), 34(b) (nutritional standards, diet, etc.), 38 (humane environment, facilities,\netc.), and 42 (written copy of standards upon admission)). In addition, there are areas where, with more careful\nfocusing by the court and the parties, the defendants should be able to achieve compliance within a year or so.\nTherefore, in the future, rather than taking on the system as a whole, the court will require that the parties focus\non just one or a few provisions in the consent decree, and see if full compliance can be achieved, albeit\npiecemeal, more expeditiously.\nThe court will therefore require that the parties submit a joint proposal for periodic small compliance hearings,\nwhich would each focus on a narrow aspect of the litigation, over the next year. In addition, so as to further\nexpedite the resolution of this litigation, the court will set down for an immediate hearing the following consent\ndecree requirements, which the defendants should have met by now:\n(1) Mental-illness standards 16 (religion) and 35 (written notice of mental-illness standards); and\n(2) Mental-retardation standards 22(c) & (d) (medication: unnecessary, excessive, review, etc.), 34\n(b) (nutritional standards, diet, etc.), 38 (humane environment, facilities, etc.), and 42 (written copy\nof standards upon admission).\nTo be sure, with the entry of an appropriate judgment today, there will be no pending request for further release\nfrom the 1986 consent decree. However, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals has made clear that a court may,\non its own initiative, review whether a court decree is still needed. United States v. Miami, 2 F.3d 1497, 1505,\n1506 (11th Cir.1993) (\"district court ... is authorized to consider sua sponte whether termination of the consent\ndecree is appropriate\"); see also United States v. City of Montgomery, 948 F.Supp. 1553, 1562 (M.D.Ala.1996)\n(Thompson, J.) (court invited parties to take appropriate steps to terminate longstanding decrees providing for\nredress of past race discrimination in city government); Jordan v.

The plaintiffs may renew the motion to the extent it\ncomplies with the instructions of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Wyatt v. Rogers, 92 F.3d\n1074 (11th Cir.1996).\n(4) The Martin-intervenors' complaint-in-intervention, filed on January 25, 1991, asserting, among\nother things, that the care and conditions at one of the state's facilities, the Thomasville Adult\nAdjustment Center, violated federal statutory and constitutional law, is denied without prejudice to\nthe extent that it has not already been denied. The Martin-intervenors may renew the motion to\n1436 the extent it complies with the instructions of the Eleventh Circuit *1436 Court of Appeals in Wyatt\nv. Rogers, 92 F.3d 1074 (11th Cir.1996).\nIt is further ORDERED that the plaintiffs, the defendants, and amicus curiae United States of America shall\nsubmit to the court, within 28 days, a joint proposal for periodic small compliance hearings which would each\nfocus on narrow aspects of the litigation over the next year.\nIt is further ORDERED that a compliance hearing is set for February 4, 1998, at 10:00 a.m., on following consent\ndecree requirements, which the defendants should have met by now:\n(1) Mental-illness standards 16 (religion) and 35 (written notice of mental-illness standards); and\n(2) Mental-retardation standards 22(c) & (d) (medication: unnecessary, excessive, review, etc.), 34\n(b) (nutritional standards, diet, etc.), 38 (humane environment, facilities, etc.), and 42 (written copy\nof standards upon admission).\n[1]See Orders of May 8, 1995 (Doc. nos. 996, 997, and 998), Dec. 30, 1994 (Doc. no. 429), Nov. 9, 1994 (Doc.\nno. 265), and Sept. 26, 1994 (Doc. no. 144). The notation `Doc. no.' indicates the file docket number given to a\ndocument. It is penciled in the right-hand bottom corner of a pleading or order and is entered on the docket sheet.\nBecause of the large number of documents (pleadings and orders) generated almost daily in this case, the court\nhas attempted to identify a document by both its filing or entry date and its docket number. The clerk of the court\ndid not begin giving documents a docket number until November 22, 1993.\n[2] While this lawsuit initially also involved a claim that employees at Bryce had been deprived of certain rights as\na result of staff reductions, the plaintiff-employees withdrew their claims, leaving only patients' rights issues\nremaining. Wyatt v. Stickney, 325 F.Supp. 781, 782 n. 1 (M.D.Ala.1971) (Johnson, J.).\n[3] At the invitation of the court, the United States of America participated as amicus curiae in this litigation. Order\nof March 12, 1971, at 7.\n\n[4]See plaintiffs' exh. I.B. 10(4) (transcribed remarks of the lead speakers for the plaintiffs and defendants at\nfairness hearing).\n[5] The committee frequently communicated with the court, the plaintiffs, and the defendants alone or with one\nother party present only. This was part of the committee's role. During trial and in their posttrial briefs, the\ndefendants attempted to discredit members of the committee by suggesting they had engaged in improper ex\nparte contacts. The court emphasized at trial, and now re-emphasizes, that these contacts were not improper,\nbecause this was the committee's role and all parties consented to and understood this role.\n[6] Letter of November 30, 1990, from Commissioner J.

Lynch v. Sessions, 942 F.Supp. 1419 (M.D.Ala.1996) (three-judge court) (Albritton,\nJ.).\n[10] Mental-illness standard 33 has since been deleted, Wyatt v.

The court,\nhowever, noted that it \"would welcome a request by the United States in the future to renew its participation in\nthis litigation.\" Order of September 16, 1992. \nLater, by orders entered on September 27, 1994, and October 27, 1994, the court, at the request of the United\nStates, allowed the United States to participate again as amicus curiae in this litigation. Wyatt v. Hanan, 868\nF.Supp. 1356 (M.D.Ala.1994).\n[20]See infra note 202.\n[21] Admittedly, mental-illness standard 33 has been deleted. But the requirement of release of those patients\nwho no longer meet the need for institutionalization is still embodied in other Wyatt standards. See infra notes\n200 and 202, and accompanying text. And, in any event, the law itself requires as much. See O'Connor v.\nDonaldson, 422 U.S. 563, 574-75, 95 S.Ct. 2486, 2493, 45 L.Ed.2d 396 (1975) (\"A finding of `mental illness'\nalone cannot justify a State's locking a person up against his will and keeping him indefinitely....

In any event, the less demanding AAPSC\nfound serious problems at the center. The AAPSC noted, among other problems, that the center \"lacks a clear\nphilosophy of treatment\", that its use of seclusion violated its own policies, that there was a need for training in\ndealing with suicidal behavior, and that gangs were a problem.

This approach\nmerely served to drive gang activity underground; it was not an effective way of addressing and eliminating gang\ninfluences and behaviors. Id. at exh. 17.\n[60]Id. at exh. 1.\n[61]Id. at exh. 4. The center's advocate for children appears to have been ineffective in addressing the children's\nconcerns and fear of gangs. Id. at exhs. 1, 3, and 18. As one child reported, \"Since it doesn't do any good to tell\nhim [the advocate,] no one really goes to him very much.\" Id. at exh. 18.\n[62] Transcript of April 14, 1995, at 4465, 4468-70, filed April 17, 1995.\n[63] After the court's admonishment, the defendants hired a team of four experts to conduct a tour of the center.\nDr. Galloway, who testified on behalf of this team, stated that, although there was informal group activity that the\nchildren perceived as gang activity, there was no formal and organized gang activity. He observed informal group\nactivity, such as gang markings, and noted that some children said they were in gangs, but he did not consider\n\nthis to constitute a \"gang\" problem. Transcript of May 16, 1995, at 8050-52, filed May 17, 1995. Whether one\nrefers to gang activities as formal and organized or informal group activity, the evidence reflected that the children\nat the center engaged in damaging rituals and threatening behavior which seriously jeopardized their safety and\nthe safety of other children. \nThe findings of Galloway and his team regarding gang activity were also compromised by several factors. The\nfirst compromising factor was the extremely narrow focus of Galloway's investigation. He limited his inquiry to the\nobservations made in the four days he and the team were at the center. Transcript of May 15, 1995, at 7987-91,\nfiled May 16, 1995. Thus, prior incidents were ignored. Second, he did not examine virtually any hard data00for\n97\nexample, incident reports or the like. Id. at 7985-86. And third, despite the fact that he was at the center to\nexamine gang activity, he did not investigate in any fashion the fact that two of the three clinical records he\nexamined while at the center had references, either in progress notes or behavioral reports, to gang activities.\nTranscript of May 16, 1995, at 8063-78, filed May 17, 1995. For example, in one record the therapist noted that in\na session with the patient he or she \"focused on [the patient's] gang involvement.\" Id. at 8063. While this could\nhave referred to prior gang involvement, there was no way of knowing if it referred to current or prior gang\ninvolvement without having made further inquiry.\n[64] Plaintiffs' exh.

Prior to this\ninstance of sexual misconduct, a girl patient had reported that Mr. H. had asked her to pull up her shirt while in\nthe gym and to go to the bathroom because he had something to show her. She also reported that Mr. H. winked\nat her and would bump into her and hit her with his hand on her bottom. The center issued a letter of reprimand\nfor this behavior. Id. at exh. 1. Additionally, a girl had alleged that Mr. H. had something going with two other girls,\na boy had accused Mr. H. of being involved with a 15-year-old resident, and a boy admitted to assisting in the\nrelay of a letter from a girl patient to Mr. H. During the investigation of the latter incident, one girl admitted that Mr.\nH. made sexual comments, touched her breasts, patted her butt, and had asked her to have sex with him. The\ninvestigation file also indicated that another boy reported overhearing Mr. H. tell a girl patient he wanted to have\nintercourse with her. Id. at exhs. 2-4. Despite this record, Mr. H. still was in direct contact with children when he\nallegedly had sexual intercourse with a girl patient at the center in a bathroom stall.\n[74] Plaintiffs' review of Benjamin H.'s file, filed May 16, 1995 (Doc. no. 1035), at exhs. 5b, 8, and 5c.\n[75] Notice of filing of client record (Doc. no. 924). Her progress notes indicate that this incident arose in therapy\nsessions on September 13, 21, and 28, 1993.\n[76] The incident involving Mr. H. having sexual intercourse with a girl patient in the bathroom was referred to a\ngrand jury. However, the state did not pursue criminal charges because the girl did not appear at the grand jury\nhearing.\n[77]See, e.g., Plaintiffs' exh.

I.C. 4(9) at 34-35 (Deposition of Poundstone). The defendants contend in their posttrial brief\nthat there are approximately 1,400 adult patients in their psychiatric facilities. However then-Commissioner\nPoundstone indicated in his deposition of February 20, 1995, that the total is approximately 1,970.\n[115] Whether Taylor Hardin is subject to the consent decree is uncertain. The parties presented virtually no\nevidence on this facility at trial, although there is evidence in the record. Because of its uncertain status, the court\nwill not make any findings at this point as to Taylor Hardin. This does not mean, however, that Taylor Hardin is not\nsubject to the consent decree. \nAt the time of trial, the Eufaula Adolescent Center was also operated by the defendants. As shown earlier, the\ndefendants have now closed the center.\n[116] Plaintiffs' exh. I.A. 1(2) at 1 (Sundram's Bryce report).\n[117] Plaintiffs' exh. I.C. 4(9) at 34-35 (Deposition of Poundstone). These numbers include the 337 residents of\nthe Kidd and Allen nursing facilities. These numbers are only approximations. The census at each facility\nchanges on a daily basis as patients are admitted and released. Id.\n[118]Id. This number includes the 124 residents residing at Searcy's Claudette Box nursing facility.\n[119] Transcript at 4763-64 (Bernstein testimony).\n[120] Plaintiffs' exh. I.C. 4(9) at 34 (deposition of Poundstone).\n[121]Id.\n[122] These standards are found at court's exh. 2.\n[123] Mental-illness standard 12 provides: \n\n\"The hospital has an obligation to supply an adequate allowance of clothing to any patients who do not have\nsuitable clothing of their own. Patients shall have the opportunity to select from various types of neat, clean, and\nseasonable clothing. Such clothing shall be considered the patient's throughout his stay in the hospital.\"\nStandard 13 provides:\n\"The hospital shall make provision for the laundering of patient clothing.\"\nStandard 19 provides:\n\"A patient has a right to a humane psychological and physical environment within the hospital facilities. These\nfacilities shall be designed to afford patients with comfort and safety, promote dignity, and ensure privacy. The\nfacilities shall be designed to make a positive contribution to the efficient attainment of the treatment goals of the\nhospital.\"\nStandard 19 then sets forth specific requirements for resident units, toilets and lavatories, showers, day rooms,\ndining facilities, linen servicing, housekeeping, geriatric-and-nonambulatory facilities, and the overall physical\nplants.\nStandard 20 provides:\n\"Patients, except for the non-mobile, shall eat or be fed in dining rooms. The diet for patients will provide at a\nminimum the Recommended Daily Dietary Allowances as developed by the National Academy of Sciences.\nMenus shall be satisfying and nutritionally adequate to provide the Recommended Daily Dietary Allowances. In\ndeveloping such menus, the hospital will utilize the Moderate Cost Food Plan of the Department of Agriculture.\nThe hospital will not spend less per patient for raw food, including the value of donated food, than the most recent\nper person costs of the Moderate Cost Food Plan for the Southern Region of the Untied States, as compiled by\nthe United States Department of Agriculture, for appropriate groupings of patients, discounted for any savings\nwhich might result from institutional procurement of such food. Provisions shall be made for special therapeutic\ndiets and for substitutes at the request of the patient, or his guardian or next of kin, in accordance with the\nreligious requirements of any patient's faith. Denial of a nutritionally adequate diet shall not be used as\npunishment.\"\n[124] Plaintiffs' exh.

For example, Sundram found that the wooden stairwells in the old main building of Bryce\nHospital constituted a fire hazard. He also found other remaining safety hazards, such as exposed light fixtures in\nshowers, slippery shower floors lacking safety mats, and the like. JCAHO also continues to cite Bryce for\ndeficiencies in basic life safety in some of its units. Plaintiffs' exh. IV.A. 2(19).\n[128] Plaintiffs' exh. I.A. 1(2) at 7 (Sundram's Bryce report).\n[129] Mental-illness standard 3 provides: \n\"No person shall be deemed incompetent to manage his affairs, to contract, to hold professional or occupational\nor vehicle operator's licenses, to marry and obtain a divorce, to register and vote, or to make a will solely by\nreason of his admission or commitment to the hospital.\"\nStandard 5 provides:\n\"Patients shall have an unrestricted right to send sealed mail.

Patients shall have a right to receive sealed mail from others, except to the extent that the\nQualified Mental Health Professional responsible for formulation of a particular patient's treatment plan writes an\n\norder imposing special restrictions on receipt of sealed mail. The written order must be renewed after each\nperiodic review of the treatment plan if any restrictions are to be continued.\"\nStandard 11 provides:\n\"Patients have a right to wear their own clothes and to keep and use their own personal possessions except\ninsofar as such clothes or personal possessions may be determined by a Qualified Mental Health Professional to\nbe dangerous or otherwise inappropriate to the treatment regimen.\"\nStandard 17 provides:\n\"The institution shall provide, with adequate supervision, suitable opportunities for the patient's interaction with\nmembers of the opposite sex.\"\nStandard 18 sets forth the rules governing patient labor. It is too long to reproduce in its entirety in this opinion. It\ncan be found at court's exh. 2. In essence it provides that patients shall not be required to provide labor involving\nthe operation and maintenance of the hospital. Patients may voluntarily engage in such labor if it is compensated\nin accordance with the federal minimum wage laws. The standard allows patients to engage in therapeutic tasks\nand labor, including labor the hospital would otherwise pay an employee for, provided that it is part of a treatment\nplan and compensated in accordance with federal minimum wage laws. The standard also permits patients to be\nrequired to perform there personal housekeeping chores, such as making a bed.\n[130] Standard 14 provides: \n\"Patients have a right to regular physical exercise several times a week. Moreover, it shall be the duty of the\nhospital to provide facilities and equipment for such exercise.\"\nStandard 15 provides:\n\"Patients have a right to be outdoors at regular and frequent intervals, in the absence of medical considerations.\"\n[131] Plaintiffs' exh.

IV.A. 2(50) at 17699 (Title XIX survey report, Kidd, Feb. 1991) (noting among many\nother problems, patients' lack of privacy in toileting and bathing).\n[138] Standard 4 provides: \n\"Patients shall have the same rights to visitation and telephone communications as patients at other public\nhospitals, except to the extent that the Qualified Mental Health Professional responsible for formulation of a\n\nparticular patient's treatment plan writes an order imposing special restrictions. The written order must be\nrenewed after each periodic review of the treatment plan if any restrictions are to be continued. Patients shall\nhave an unrestricted right to visitation with attorneys and with private physicians and other health professionals.\"\n[139] Plaintiffs' exh. I.A. 1(2) at iii, 14 (Sundram's Bryce report).\n[140]Id. at 14.\n[141] Standard 16 provides: \n\"The right to religious worship shall be accorded to each patient who desires such opportunities. Provisions for\nsuch worship shall be made available to all patients on a nondiscriminatory basis. No individual shall be coerced\ninto engaging in any religious activities.\"\n[142] Plaintiffs' exh. I.A. 1(2) at 21 (Sundram's Bryce report).\n[143] Standard 31 provides: \n\"Confidentiality of the patient record shall be protected through strict adherence to applicable statutes and rules.\nNotwithstanding the preceding, the following shall have access to a patient's record: (a) the patient; (b) the\npatient's guardian; (c) individuals properly authorized in writing by the patient or the patient's guardian; (d)\nattorneys for the plaintiff class and their designated agents; (e) the Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program, or its\nsuccessor, in accordance with applicable law; and (f) properly authorized employees of the Alabama Department\nof Mental Health and Mental Retardation, including the staff of the Department's Internal Rights Protection and\nAdvocacy Program.\"\nThe standard then sets forth what each patient record shall include at a minimum.

IV.F. 2(13) at 6 (JCAHO official accreditation report, North Alabama Regional, Nov. 9, 1994).\nA mock survey conducted by the Department prior to a JCAHO survey at Searcy detected similar deficiencies in\nmedication practices. Plaintiffs' exh. IV.B. 2(40) at 10471 (memo from Mason to Bartlett re: Searcy Mock Survey,\nJan. 25-27, 1994).

I.A. 1(2) at v, 30-31 (Sundram's Bryce report).\n[168] However, inadequate staffing contributes to the defendants' failure to meet the safety and treatment\nstandards. The court finds that the defendants' failure to adequately implement individual treatment plans in\nconformance with standard 26 and failure to protect patient's from harm in conformance with standards one and\n19 demonstrates inadequate staffing. But these deficiencies are adequately addressed by the requirements in\nstandards 1, 19, and 26.\n[169]See supra note 88.\n[170] Transcript at 4876-85 (Bernstein testimony).\n[171] Plaintiffs' exh.

To this end, the institution shall make every attempt to move residents from (1) more to less\nstructured living; (2) larger to smaller facilities; (3) larger to smaller living units; (4) group to individual residence;\n(5) segregated from the community to integrated into the community living; (6) dependent to independent living.\"\nStandard 4 provides:\n\"Borderline or mildly retarded persons shall not be residents of the institution. In unusual cases in which\nborderline or mildly mentally retarded persons have severe additional handicaps which preclude their living in the\ncommunity, they may reside in Partlow. Such persons will receive suitable remedial training and treatment for the\nadditional handicapping conditions as well as suitable habilitation programming. They will be afforded all the\nrights afforded other residents.\n\n\"For purposes of this standard, a borderline retarded person is defined as an individual who is functioning\nbetween one and two standard deviations below the mean on a standardized intelligence test such as the\nStanford Binet Scale and on measures of adaptive behavior such as the American Association on Mental\nDeficiency Adaptive Behavior Scale. A mildly retarded person is defined as an individual who is functioning\nbetween two and three standard deviations below the mean on a standardized intelligence test such as the\nStanford Binet Scale and on a measure of adaptive behavior such as the American Association on Mental\nDeficiency Adaptive Behavior Scale.\"\nStandard 10 provides:\n\"Residents who hold reasonable promise for eventual placement outside the institution and for living in the\ncommunity shall have post-institutionalization plans developed for them within the six-month period following\nadmission. Post-institutionalization plans for those now residing in Partlow will be reevaluated so that such plans\ninclude only those residents who show reasonable promise of making a satisfactory adjustment in a\nnoninstitutional setting. The plans shall be developed by a Qualified Mental Retardation Professional. The\nguardian or next of kin of the resident and the resident, if able to give informed consent, shall be consulted in the\ndevelopment of such plan and shall be informed of the content of such plan.\"\nStandard 47 requires that \"Each resident discharged to the community shall have a program of transitional\nhabilitation assistance.\"\nStandard 49 provides:\n\"No person shall be admitted to any publicly supported residential institution caring for mentally retarded persons\nunless such institution meets the above standards or unless the chief administrator of such institution determines\nthat the person, if allowed to remain in the community, is likely to cause serious injury to himself or others, or that\nthe only alternative for providing adequate shelter, food and clothing for such person is jail. Any person initially\ndetermined to be such an exceptional case shall be admitted for a period not to exceed 30 days during which\ntime a thorough evaluation of such person shall be conducted by the officials of the institution. If this evaluation\nconfirms that such person falls within the limited exception set forth above, then such person may be admitted to\nan institution for the mentally retarded in a regular status.\n\"The Director of the institution shall file with this court each thirty days a report setting forth the full details\nwarranting any exceptional admission, including the evaluation of the patient.\"\nThe defendants previously sought to eliminate all standards requiring that residents' be provided habilitation in\nthe least restrictive environment. Wyatt, 803 F.Supp. at 377 (denying defendants' motion).\n[265] The purpose of habilitation is to allow an individual to lead a life as normal as possible and as free from\nrestrictions on their liberties as possible.\n[266] The court finds compliance with standard four. Plaintiffs' exh. I.A. 1(1) at vi, 37-38 (Sundram's Brewer\nreport). The mildly retarded and borderline individuals in the defendants' institutions are dually diagnosed, that is,\nthey have an additional handicap. Thus, the defendants are not violating this standard. By finding compliance\nwith this standard, the court, however, is not finding compliance with the other least restrictive environment\nstandards as to these individuals for whom a less restrictive environment may or may not be appropriate.

The defendants' expert and his team reviewed the Department's polices and procedures which\n\nprohibit corporal punishment and spoke with facility personnel. Defendants' posttrial brief, at 73, filed June 26,\n1995 (Doc. no. 1107). The team failed to review incident reports documenting evidence of corporal punishment\nand abuse and neglect, in essence, it failed to make an independent inquiry into whether these policies were\nimplemented. Instead it conducted a paper inquiry and relied on the defendants' representations. This type of\ninquiry is typical and applies virtually across the board to the defendants' experts' inquiries. \nFurthermore, as the court has previously noted, policies and procedures are meaningless in the face of evidence\nthat they are not implemented. In the face of the overwhelming evidence of abuse and neglect at the defendants'\nmental-retardation facilities, including the defendants' own undercover operation, the court is compelled to\ndiscount the defendants' experts' opinion.\n[306] Transcript at 6224, 6273, 6297, 6303-04, 6308 (Christian testimony); id. at 5773 (Records testimony); U.S.\nMR 2 at 20, 80-83 (Christian report); U.S. MR exh. 118 (Wallace Advocacy third quarter monitoring report, Oct.\n1994); see also plaintiffs' exh.

The defendants rely on Association for\nRetarded Citizens of North Dakota v. Schafer, 872 F.Supp. 689 (D.N.D.1995),rev'd in nonrelevant part,83 F.3d\n1008 (8th Cir.),cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 117 S.Ct. 482, 136 L.Ed.2d 376 (1996). In releasing a mentally\ndisabled program from injunctions, the court adopted a report by a panel of masters that cited Title XIX\ncertification as an important element of the system's improvements over the last decade. Id. at 699. However, in \nSchafer, meeting Title XIX standards had \"been the principal thrust of the U.S. District Court's orders designed to\nremedy the absence of, or gaps in, federally required services for the developmentally disabled in North Dakota.\" \nId. Whereas, in this case, the scope of the court's orders go far beyond achieving Title XIX certification.\n[342] The court cannot, however, agree with the defendants' argument that the court has limited jurisdiction to\nenforce this consent decree. The holdings and cases they cite, Saahir v. Estelle, 47 F.3d 758, 761 (5th Cir.1995); \nLelsz v. Kavanagh, 807 F.2d 1243 (5th Cir.),cert. dismissed,483 U.S. 1057, 108 S.Ct. 44, 97 L.Ed.2d 821\n(1987), do not apply to this case. In Saahir the court's jurisdiction to enforce a consent decree was limited\nbecause it had both approved the consent decree and dismissed the case. While the Eleventh Circuit has not\nexpressed a firm view on a court's jurisdiction to enforce a consent decree after the lawsuit has been dismissed,\nthere is a body of case law that holds that the court must have an independent jurisdictional basis to enforce a\nsettlement agreement after the lawsuit has been dismissed. See, e.g., McCall-Bey v. Franzen, 777 F.2d 1178,\n1185-87 (7th Cir.1985); Fairfax Countywide Citizens Ass'n v. County of Fairfax, 571 F.2d 1299 (4th Cir.),cert.\ndenied,439 U.S. 1047, 99 S.Ct. 722, 58 L.Ed.2d 706 (1978),contra, England v. Kemp, 976 F.2d 662, 665-666\n(11th Cir.1992). The court need not reach whether it has jurisdiction to enforce a decree after the lawsuit has\nbeen dismissed because the court has never dismissed this lawsuit. Therefore, its jurisdiction to enforce the\nsettlement agreement is firm. The holding in Lelsz is also inapposite. In Lelsz the district court did not have\njurisdiction to enforce a consent decree, because the consent decree had ordered state officials to undertake\ncertain actions based on state law, which a federal court cannot do, Pennhurst State School & Hospital v.\nHalderman, 465 U.S. 89, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984). 807 F.2d at 1247-48, 1252. The settlement\nagreement in this lawsuit was not based on state law.\n[343] H.R.Rep. No. 485(III), 101st Cong, 2d Sess. at 26, reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 267, 445, 449\n(Hereinafter House Report (III)).\n[344] Indeed, the ADA parallels the 1986 consent decree in that it focuses on individual circumstances. The ADA\nrequires an individual assessment of each individual on a case-by-case basis as to whether or not community\nservices and what community services are the most integrated appropriate, not a blanket statement regarding\nwhole classes of individuals.

As the regulations' appendix explains the regulations\nrequire that actions be based on \"facts applicable to individuals and not on prescriptions as to what a class of\nindividuals with disabilities can or cannot do.\" 28 C.F.R. pt. 35, app. A at 449.\n[345] For these same reasons, the Martin-intervenors' request for additional relief will be denied.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

These patients alleged that the conditions at Bryce Hospital were such that they had been\n[2]\ndeprived of their rights under the United States Constitution.\n1077 On March 12, 1971, following a hearing on the plaintiffs' application for preliminary injunctive *1077 relief, the\ndistrict court found that patients at Bryce Hospital were being denied their \"constitutional right to receive such\nindividual treatment as will give each of them a realistic opportunity to be cured or to improve his or her mental\n[3]\ncondition.\" Wyatt v. Stickney, 325 F.Supp. 781, 784 (M.D.Ala. 1971). The court ordered the defendants to\n\ndevise, and to submit to the court for approval, a plan to bring the hospital into compliance with constitutional\nstandards of care.\nSeveral months after the district court's decision, the plaintiffs were given leave to amend their complaint to\ninclude allegations of constitutionally inadequate treatment at a second state-run hospital for the mentally ill,\nSearcy Hospital, in Mt. Vernon, Alabama, and at Partlow State School and Hospital, a state-run institution for\n[4]\nmentally retarded persons in Partlow, Alabama.  Following this amendment, the court's order of March 12,\n1971, was made applicable to the Searcy and Partlow facilities.\nAfter the defendants failed to formulate \"minimum medical and constitutional standards\" for the operation of the\nthree institutions, the district court, on April 13, 1972, established what would become known as the \"Wyatt\nstandards,\" which set forth several specific requirements for the adequate treatment of both mentally ill and\n[5]\nmentally retarded individuals.  The court enjoined the defendants to implement the standards. See Wyatt v.\nStickney, 344 F.Supp. 373, 378-86 (M.D.Ala.1972) (Bryce and Searcy Hospitals); Wyatt v. Stickney, 344 F.Supp.\n[6]\n387, 394-407 (M.D.Ala.1972) (Partlow State School and Hospital).  The former Fifth Circuit affirmed the district\ncourt's injunctions in 1974. Wyatt v. Aderholt, 503 F.2d 1305 (5th Cir. 1974). It upheld under the Due Process\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment the plaintiffs' constitutional right to treatment and affirmed the standards\nthat were promulgated by the district court. In 1975, the district court, with the agreement of the parties, amended\n[7]\nits 1972 injunctions to apply the Wyatt standards to all DMH/MR facilities.\n1078 *1078 The defendants failed to comply with the Wyatt standards, and in 1979, the governor of Alabama moved\nthe district court to place Alabama's mental health and mental retardation system into receivership. See Wyatt v.\nIreland, Civ. A. No. 3195-N (M.D.Ala. Oct. 25, 1979). On January 15, 1980, the court appointed the governor\nreceiver of all DMH/MR institutions.\nOn March 9, 1981, the plaintiffs moved the court to force the defendants to comply with the 1972 injunctive\norders by ordering them to provide \"sufficient funds\" to the DMH/MR so that it could satisfy the Wyatt standards.\nThe plaintiffs did not seek enforcement of the court's injunctive orders by using equity's time-honored procedures\nfor obtaining the enforcement of an injunction. Rather, as they have done throughout this case, they simply asked\n[8]\nthe court to \"do something\" to make the defendants comply with the Wyatt standards.  On May 18, 1981, the\ndefendants, in response to the plaintiffs' motion, moved the court to modify its 1972 injunctive orders to eliminate\nthe Wyatt standards and to substitute accreditation by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare\nOrganizations (\"JCAHO\") as the standard of constitutionally acceptable care at DMH/MR institutions. The\nplaintiffs opposed the substitution. In 1983, the court held a hearing on both the defendants' and plaintiffs' 1981\nmotions, but did not rule on them.\n1079 *1079 The parties eventually negotiated a settlement, and submitted it in the form of a consent decree, which the\ndistrict court approved on September 22, 1986. See Wyatt v. Wallis, Civ. A. No. 3195-N (M.D.Ala. Sept. 22,\n1986). Among other things, the decree (1) removed the Alabama mental health and mental retardation system\nfrom receivership; (2) dismissed from the case all defendants except the commissioner of mental health and\nmental retardation and the individual directors of the DMH/MR institutions; (3) continued in effect the Wyatt\nstandards; (4) enjoined the defendants to \"continue to make substantial progress in achieving compliance with\"\nthe Wyatt standards; and (5) enjoined the defendants to seek and maintain JCAHO accreditation at all DMH/MR\ninstitutions.\nOn December 20, 1990, patients at the Thomasville Adult Adjustment Center in Thomasville, Alabama, moved\n[9]\nthe district court for leave to intervene in the litigation as plaintiffs.  In their proposed complaint, the intervenors\nalleged that the defendants had violated the Wyatt standards and that certain unconstitutional conditions existed\n[10]\nat Thomasville.  The intervenors sought a permanent injunction barring further admissions to the Center until\nthe defendants complied with the Wyatt standards at that institution. The court granted the Thomasville patients'\nmotion to intervene on January 25, 1991, and, in October of that year, held a bench trial on their claims. The\n[11]\ndistrict court has yet to rule on this matter.\n\nII.\nOn January 18, 1991, before the district court ruled on the Thomasville patients' motion to intervene, the\ndefendants, acknowledging that they were not in compliance with all of the Wyatt standards at DMH/MR\ninstitutions, nonetheless moved the district court to terminate the 1986 consent decree and to dismiss the case.\nOn April 19, 1991, the defendants, apparently as an alternative measure, moved the court to modify the consent\ndecree by deleting or modifying several of the Wyatt standards. Early in 1993, while these motions were still\npending, the plaintiffs moved the district court for \"a finding that the defendants are violating the 1986 Consent\n[12]\nDecree\" and for \"contempt sanctions for defendants' violations.\"  The court ordered that the defendants' and\n[13]\nthe plaintiffs' motions be heard together at an evidentiary hearing.\n1080 *1080 The hearing was held from March 13 to May 16, 1995. On the first day of the hearing, the court announced\nat a meeting in chambers that, in response to deposition testimony describing unsafe living conditions at the\nEufaula Adolescent Center in Eufaula, Alabama, it was considering entering preliminary injunctive relief on behalf\nof the patients at Eufaula. On April 17, the plaintiffs formally moved the court to provide such relief, and on July\n11, the court entered a preliminary injunction enjoining the defendants from \"failing to take immediate and\naffirmative steps to provide for the safety and protection from abuse of all resident children at the Eufaula\nAdolescent Center, as required by [the Wyatt standards].\" Wyatt v. Poundstone, 892 F.Supp. 1410, 1423\n(M.D.Ala.1995). The court further ordered the defendants to submit a plan to the court to \"address and resolve\nimmediately the severe and pervasive safety problems and abuse of resident children at Eufaula Adolescent\nCenter.\" Id. at 1423-24. The defendants appeal the preliminary injunction in No. 95-6637, contending that the\ndistrict court abused its discretion in ordering the relief it granted. After the appeal was taken, the district court, on\nSeptember 15, 1995, approved a one-year remedial plan for Eufaula.\nThe Eufaula Adolescent Center is now closed; there are no patients residing at the facility. Further, it appears that\nthe state is not likely to reopen Eufaula prior to September 15, 1996, the date on which the defendants' plan (and\n[14]\nthus the preliminary injunction) expires. The appeal is therefore moot.\nIII.\nOn August 17, 1995, a month after the entry of the preliminary injunction, the defendants moved the district judge\nto disqualify himself from the case, alleging (1) that the judge has acted in a manner \"in which his impartiality\nmight reasonably be questioned,\" 28 U.S.C. § 455(a); and (2) that \"in private practice he served as lawyer in the\n[15]\nmatter in controversy,\" 28 U.S.C. § 455(b)(2).  On October 3, 1995, the judge denied the motion. The\ndefendants appeal this denial in No. 95-6875.\nAn interlocutory appeal does not lie from the denial of a motion to disqualify a district judge. See United States v.\nGregory, 656 F.2d 1132, 1136 (5th Cir. Unit B Sept. 1981); In re Corrugated Container Antitrust Litig., 614 F.2d\n[16]\n958, 960-61 (5th Cir.),cert. denied,449 U.S. 888, 101 S.Ct. 244, 66 L.Ed.2d 114 (1980).  The defendants\ncontend, however, that an order denying a motion to disqualify is appealable if it is pendent to a final or otherwise\n1081 appealable order. See Stewart v. Baldwin County Bd. of Educ., 908 *1081 F.2d 1499, 1509 (11th Cir.1990)\n(\"Pendent jurisdiction is properly exercised over nonappealable decisions of the district court when the reviewing\ncourt already has jurisdiction over one issue in the case.\"); see also Swint v. Chambers County Comm'n, ___ U.S\n. ___, ___ & n. 2, 115 S.Ct. 1203, 1209 & n. 2, 131 L.Ed.2d 60 (1995) (discussing the doctrine of \"pendent\nappellate jurisdiction\"). Here, the defendants claim that the district court's denial of the motion to disqualify is\npendent to and appealable with its order granting the plaintiffs preliminary injunctive relief at Eufaula, which the\ndefendants appeal in No. 95-6637.\nThe appeal of the preliminary injunction is moot. See supra part II. Thus, even were the unappealable\ndisqualification order pendent to the appealable preliminary injunction, the denial of the motion to disqualify is no\nlonger pendent to any reviewable order. The court's order would be reviewable on a petition for a writ of\nmandamus. See Corrugated Container, 614 F.2d at 961 n. 4. Defendants have not submitted such a petition,\n\nhowever, and we decline on our own initiative to treat their appeal of the court's order as a mandamus petition.\n[17]\n We therefore have no jurisdiction to review the district court's order denying the defendants' motion to\ndisqualify.\nIV.\nOn December 22, 1994, the defendants moved the district court to \"recertify\" or modify the plaintiff class, or, in\n[18]\nthe alternative, to \"decertify\" the class, because a plaintiff class had never been certified in the case.  On\nOctober 3, 1995, the same day the court denied the defendants' motion to disqualify the district judge, the court\n[19]\ndenied the motion to decertify the plaintiff class. At the same time, the court \"recertified\" the plaintiff class. See\nWyatt v. Poundstone, Civ. A. No. 3195-N (M.D.Ala. Oct. 3, 1995). In No. 95-6875, the defendants appeal the\ndistrict court's refusal to decertify the plaintiff class and its recertification of that class.\nClass recertification orders are not final orders within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 1291; as such, they are\nordinarily not appealable. See Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 468-69, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 2458, 57\nL.Ed.2d 351 (1978); Elster v. Alexander, 608 F.2d 196, 197 (5th Cir.1979); Knox v. Amalgamated Meat Cutters &\nButchers Workmen, 520 F.2d 1205, 1206 (5th Cir.1975). Likewise, 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a) does not provide for\ninterlocutory appellate review of such orders. The defendants contend that the recertification order, like the\ncourt's denial of the motion to disqualify, is appealable because it is pendent to the appealable order granting\npreliminary injunctive relief. As we have explained, see supra part III, because the preliminary injunction is moot,\nthe recertification order is no longer pendent to any reviewable order. We therefore have no jurisdiction to review\nthe district court's order refusing to decertify the plaintiff class and recertifying that class.\nV.\nIn conclusion, the appeal of the preliminary injunction entered on July 11, 1995, is DISMISSED as moot (No.\n95-6637), and the appeal of the district court's orders of October 3, 1995, is DISMISSED for lack of appellate\n1082 jurisdiction (No. 95-6875). All outstanding *1082 motions before this court pertaining to these appeals are hereby\nDENIED as moot.\nSO ORDERED.\n[*] Honorable Levin H. Campbell, Senior U.S. Circuit Judge for the First Circuit, sitting by designation.\n[1] Since the beginning of the litigation, the parties and the courts have treated this case as a class action, even\nthough the district court has failed to certify a plaintiff class. See, e.g., Wyatt v. Stickney, 325 F.Supp. 781, 782\n(M.D.Ala.1971) (\"This is a class action.... The plaintiffs sue on behalf of themselves and on behalf of other\nmembers of their respective classes.\"); Wyatt v. Aderholt, 503 F.2d 1305, 1306 (5th Cir.1974) (\"The guardians of\npatients ... brought this class action on behalf of their wards and other civilly committed patients.\"). One of the\nissues on appeal is the propriety of the district court's \"recertification\" of a plaintiff class. See infra part IV.\n[2] The lawsuit was filed after staff members at Bryce Hospital and other DMH/MR institutions were discharged\nas a result of a state \"budgetary crisis.\" These discharged staff members joined the Bryce Hospital patients as\nparty plaintiffs and sought reinstatement to their positions. Both groups of plaintiffs sought to \nredress the deprivation, under color of laws and statutes of the State of Alabama, of rights, privileges, and\nimmunities secured by the Fifth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States,\nproviding for equal rights of all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States.\nThe patients alleged that the staff reductions would have two harmful consequences. First, patients involuntarily\ncommitted to Bryce Hospital would not receive the care that Alabama law required that they receive. Such lack of\ncare, it was alleged, would deprive the patients of \"due process\" because the patients would be subjected to what\namounted to penal confinement. Second, the staff reductions and consequent lack of adequate treatment\nprograms would have \"serious and irreparable consequences\" for the patients at Bryce Hospital. The patients\n\nasked the district court to enter a permanent injunction ordering the defendants to \"insure and direct that no\npresent course of mental health treatment and service now being given to plaintiffs ... shall in any way be\ninterrupted, changed, or interfered with.\" The patients also sought an injunction that would end further involuntary\ncommitment of patients to Bryce Hospital.\nThe discharged staff members alleged that they had a right under Alabama law to remain in their jobs, that their\ndischarge violated their due process right to pre-termination hearings, and that the defendants had other means\nof meeting the budgetary crisis aside from cutting staff. They sought an injunction that would require the\ndefendants to \"rescind\" all staff terminations at Bryce Hospital. These staff members subsequently abandoned\ntheir claims and withdrew from the case, leaving the patients as the only plaintiffs. See Wyatt, 325 F.Supp. at 782\nn. 1.\nIn 1974, the former Fifth Circuit described the patients' complaint and the subsequent amendment to that\npleading as follows:\nThe original complaint did not allege that treatment levels at Bryce had been inadequate before the [staff]\nterminations. For reasons not entirely clear from the record before us, however, the focus of the litigation soon\nshifted from the effects of the [staff] terminations to questions of the overall adequacy of the treatment afforded at\nthe Alabama state mental hospitals. On January 4, 1971, the plaintiffs amended the complaint to add prayers that\nthe defendants be enjoined from operating Bryce \"in a manner that does not conform to constitutional standards\nof delivering adequate mental treatment to its patients\"; that the [c]ourt order defendants to prepare a\n\"comprehensive constitutionally acceptable plan to provide adequate treatment in any state mental health\nfacility\"; and that the court declare that patients confined to a state mental health facility are entitled to \"adequate,\ncompetent treatment.\"\nWyatt v. Aderholt, 503 F.2d 1305, 1308 (5th Cir. 1974).\n[3] The district court did not explicitly state what constitutional provision formed the basis for its ruling. The court\nfound that \"[t]o deprive any citizen of his or her liberty upon the altruistic theory that the confinement is for\nhumane therapeutic reasons and then fail to provide adequate treatment violates the very fundamentals of due\nprocess.\" Wyatt, 325 F.Supp. at 785.\n[4] As noted in the text, supra, when this suit was brought, the plaintiffs were patients at Bryce Hospital, not\nSearcy Hospital or Partlow State School and Hospital. Some of the patients were subsequently transferred to\nSearcy and Partlow (or were eligible for such transfer) and thus had standing to complain of the conditions at\nthose institutions. The amended complaint alleged that the three institutions were being operated in a\n\"[c]onstitutionally impermissible manner which results in scientifically and medically inadequate care,\" but did not\ncite any specific provision of the Constitution.\n[5] The Wyatt standards were designed to meet what the district court called the three \"fundamental conditions\nfor adequate and effective treatment\": \"(1) a humane psychological and physical environment, (2) qualified staff\nin numbers sufficient to administer adequate treatment and (3) individualized treatment plans.\" See Wyatt v.\nStickney, 334 F.Supp. 1341, 1343 (M.D.Ala.1971).\n[6] In the order pertaining to Bryce and Searcy Hospitals, the court reiterated its earlier holding that civilly\ncommitted mentally ill persons have a constitutional right to treatment. In the order pertaining to Partlow State\nSchool and Hospital, the court outlined a \"constitutional right to habilitation\" for civilly committed mentally\nretarded individuals so as to \"give each of [these persons] a realistic opportunity to lead a more useful and\nmeaningful life and to return to society.\" Wyatt, 344 F.Supp. at 390.\n[7] The 1975 order changed the definitions of \"institution\" and \"hospital\" in the Wyatt standards to include \"any\nother centers, homes, and facilities 00 public or private 00 to which [mentally ill, emotionally disturbed, or mentally\n97 97\nretarded] persons are assigned or transferred for residence\" by the DMH/MR. The definition of \"residents\" in the\nstandards applicable to facilities for the mentally retarded was changed to include \"all persons who are now\nconfined and all persons who may be confined at ... any other institution as hereinabove defined for the care,\ntreatment, and habilitation of the mentally retarded.\" In the standards applicable to facilities for the mentally ill, the\ndefinition of \"patients\" was changed to include \"all persons who are now confined and all persons who may in the\n\nfuture be confined at ... any other `hospital' as hereinabove defined for the care, custody, and treatment of the\nmentally ill or emotionally disturbed.\" See Wyatt v. Hardin, Civ. A. No. 3195-N (M.D.Ala. Feb. 28, 1975). Although\nthe court's injunctions now reached private facilities in which DMH/MR placed patients, no private facility was\nmade a defendant in the action.\n[8] Precedent dictates that a plaintiff seeking to obtain the defendant's compliance with the provisions of an\ninjunctive order move the court to issue an order requiring the defendant to show cause why he should not be\nheld in contempt and sanctioned for his noncompliance. See Newman v. State of Alabama, 683 F.2d 1312, 1318\n(11th Cir.1982),cert. denied,460 U.S. 1083, 103 S.Ct. 1773, 76 L.Ed.2d 346 (1983). In his motion, the plaintiff\ncites the provision(s) of the injunction he wishes to be enforced, alleges that the defendant has not complied with\nsuch provision(s), and asks the court, on the basis of his representation, to order the defendant to show cause\nwhy he should not be adjudged in contempt and sanctioned. If the court is satisfied that the plaintiff has made out\na case for an order to show cause, it issues the order to show cause. The defendant, following receipt of the\norder, usually files a response, either confessing his noncompliance or presenting an excuse, or \"cause,\"\ntherefor. The dispute is thereafter resolved at a show cause hearing, with the issues to be decided at the hearing\nframed by the show cause order and the defendant's response. \nAt the hearing, if the plaintiff establishes the defendant's noncompliance with the court's injunctive order and the\ndefendant presents no lawful excuse for his noncompliance, the court usually adjudges the defendant in civil\ncontempt and imposes a sanction that is likely to prompt the defendant's compliance with the injunction.\nOne sanction might be to incarcerate ... the defendant[].... While a federal court is always reluctant to coerce\ncompliance with its decrees by incarcerating a state official, if that official is in contempt there can be no doubt of\nthe court's authority to do so. State officials are not above the law.\nAnother sanction might be to fine the recalcitrant official. \"Civil contempt may ... be punished by a remedial fine,\nwhich compensates the party who won the injunction for the effects of his opponent's noncompliance.... If [a state\nofficial] refuses to adhere to a court order, a financial penalty may be the most effective means of insuring\ncompliance.\" [Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 691, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 2573, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978).]\nNewman, 683 F.2d at 1318 (citation omitted).\nIn seeking to enforce the court's injunctions in this case, the plaintiffs have not resorted to the traditional means\nof enforcing injunctions described above. Nor has the court issued orders to show cause, calling upon the\nallegedly recalcitrant defendants to explain why they have not complied with the injunctive provisions in question.\nConsequently, the hearings that the district court has convened to consider the plaintiffs' motions for enforcement\nhave amounted for the most part to status conferences in which the court is briefed, sometimes through\ntestimony, on the current conditions at DMH/MR institutions. This may account for the court's failure to rule on the\nplaintiffs' 1981 motion to ensure compliance with the court's 1972 injunctive orders and, as well, the plaintiffs'\n1993 motion, described in the text, infra, to enforce the consent decree entered in 1986.\n[9] Patients at Thomasville were already members of the plaintiff \"class,\" as defined by the Wyatt standards. See\nWyatt, Civ. A. No. 3195-N (M.D.Ala. Feb. 28, 1975) (changing the definition of \"hospital\" in the Wyatt standards\nspecifically to include the Thomasville Adult Adjustment Center).\n[10] Among other things, the intervenors claimed that \"Alabama's indeterminate involuntary civil confinement of\nthe mentally ill violate[d] the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\" because the state did not limit\nthe length of the confinement and the DMH/MR failed to provide for periodic adversarial post-commitment\nreviews of such confinement. See Wyatt v. King, 773 F.Supp. 1508, 1511 (M.D.Ala.1991). On July 22, 1991, the\ndistrict court granted the intervenors relief on this claim, declaring Alabama's \"indeterminate involuntary civil\ncommitment of the mentally ill\" unconstitutional and ordering periodic adversarial post-commitment reviews. Id. at\n1517-18.\n[11] The defendants have petitioned this court for a writ of mandamus compelling the district court to rule on the\nintervenors' claim of unconstitutional conditions at Thomasville. See In re Fetner, No. 95-6879 (11th Cir. filed Oct.\n23, 1995). This court stayed the petition pending the resolution of the instant appeals.\n\n[12] Unlike their previous motion to enforce the district court's injunctive orders, see supra note 8, on this\noccasion plaintiffs' motion alleged that the defendants were violating the 1986 consent decree and sought a\ncontempt adjudication and sanctions. Like the previous motion, however, the motion failed to allege, with\nspecificity sufficient to inform the defendants, which injunctive provisions the defendants were purportedly\nviolating. \nOn the same day that they filed the above motion, the plaintiffs moved the court for leave to amend their\ncomplaint to assert a claim for declaratory and injunctive relief on the ground that the defendants were violating\nprovisions of the newly enacted Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Pub.L. No. 101-336, 104 Stat. 328. In\neffect, the plaintiffs sought leave to bring an entirely new lawsuit. The claims under the Americans with Disabilities\nAct were unrelated to the case at hand, but the district court granted the motion to amend.\n[13] With respect to the plaintiffs' motion that the defendants be held in contempt for violating the 1986 consent\ndecree, the court did not determine whether the motion was sufficient to warrant the issuance of an order to show\ncause, see supra note 8; rather, the court simply scheduled an evidentiary hearing.\n[14] On August 1, 1995, the defendants asked the district court to stay the preliminary injunction pending this\nappeal; the district court denied their request a week later. After the DMH/MR announced that it was closing\nEufaula, the district court stayed the preliminary injunction because it found \"the need for the preliminary\ninjunction ... is moot.\" Wyatt v. Fetner, Civ. A. No. 3195-N (M.D.Ala. Mar. 22, 1996). (The district court also\ninformed this court that upon remand of this appeal it will dissolve the preliminary injunction.) The defendants\nhave appealed the stay order, Wyatt v. Fetner, No. 96-6279 (11th Cir. filed Mar. 22, 1996); we dismiss this appeal\nas moot in a separate unpublished opinion.\n[15] Section 455 provides: \n(a) Any justice, judge, or magistrate of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his\nimpartiality might reasonably be questioned.\n(b) He shall also disqualify himself in the following circumstances:\n(1) Where he has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party, or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary\nfacts concerning the proceeding;\n(2) Where in private practice he served as lawyer in the matter in controversy, or a lawyer with whom he\npreviously practiced law served during such association as a lawyer concerning the matter, or the judge or such\nlawyer has been a material witness concerning it.\n28 U.S.C. § 455(a), (b)(1)-(2).\n[16] In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), this court adopted as binding\nprecedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to October 1, 1981.\n[17] The defendants have petitioned for a writ of mandamus to disqualify the district judge from the case of Lynch\nv. Evans, Civ. A. No. 74-T-89-N (M.D.Ala.), another longstanding case concerning Alabama's mental health\nsystem. The petition, In re Fetner, No. 95-6728 (11th Cir. filed Sept. 5, 1995), was consolidated with these\nappeals for oral argument. We dismiss the petition as moot in a separate unpublished opinion.\n[18]See supra note 1. The defendants also contended that the plaintiff class should be decertified because the\nnamed plaintiffs' claims had become moot. The district court, however, allowed a new group of plaintiffs whose\nclaims are not moot (the Hanna class) to \"intervene\" in the case, essentially substituting them for the Wyatt\nplaintiffs.\n[19] The plaintiff class is now defined as \"mentally-ill and mentally-retarded individuals who live in hospitals,\ncenters, facilities, or homes, public or private, to which the individual has been assigned or transferred to by the\n[DMH/MR].\" Wyatt v. Poundstone, Civ. A. No. 3195-N (M.D.Ala. Oct. 3, 1995).\n\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

THOMPSON, Chief Judge.\nThe plaintiffs in this ongoing class-action lawsuit first sued officials of the State of Alabama over 24-years ago,\nclaiming that conditions at facilities operated by the Alabama Department of Mental Health and Mental\nRetardation violated residents' rights under federal law. On January 22, 1993, the plaintiffs moved to enforce a\n1986 consent decree and for further relief, claiming that defendant state officials had failed to comply with the\n1986 decree and were violating the recently enacted Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C.A. §§\n12101-12213 (West Supp.1995).\nNow before the court is an additional motion by the plaintiffs seeking preliminary injunctive relief on their 1993\n[1]\nmotion as to one of the state-operated mental health facilities, the Eufaula Adolescent Center.  For the reasons\nthat follow, the court concludes that the additional motion should be granted and a preliminary injunction entered.\nI. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nIn 1972, after finding that the defendants were violating the plaintiffs' constitutional rights, the court entered\ninjunctions requiring that state facilities for the mentally retarded and mentally ill be brought into compliance with\n\ncertain minimal standards. Wyatt v. Stickney, 344 F.Supp. 373 (M.D.Ala. 1972) (Johnson, J.) (standards for\nmentally ill), aff'd in relevant part,503 F.2d 1305 (5th Cir.1974); Wyatt v. Stickney, 344 F.Supp. 387\n(M.D.Ala.1972) (Johnson, J.) (standards for mentally retarded), aff'd in relevant part,503 F.2d 1305 (5th Cir.1974)\n. These standards were developed with the assistance of the parties and experts in the fields of mental health\n[2]\nand mental retardation, and are commonly known as the \"Wyatt standards.\"  The establishment of the Wyatt\nstandards proved, however, to be only the first step in an extended struggle to secure the rights of the mentally ill\nand mentally retarded residents of Alabama's institutions. In 1986, the court approved a consent decree resolving\nthe parties' continued conflicts over the adequacy of the state's funding and administration of the state's mental\n[3]\nhealth and retardation facilities.  As part of the 1986 consent decree, the defendants agreed to make\n[4]\nsubstantial progress towards achieving compliance with the Wyatt standards.\nIn 1991, a new round of litigation began. On January 18, 1991, the defendants moved for a finding that they had\nmet their obligations under the 1986 decree and for an order terminating this lawsuit. On January 22, 1993, as\nstated, the plaintiffs moved to enforce the 1986 consent decree and for further relief, claiming that the defendants\nhad failed to comply with the decree and were violating the recently enacted Americans with Disabilities Act.\nBeginning on March 13, 1995, the court held a 35-day hearing on these two motions.\nAt the beginning of the hearing, based on the pretrial briefs and a preliminary review of the evidentiary record\n1412 filed prior to the hearing,[5] the court expressed grave concern *1412 about violations of the Wyatt standards at\n[6]\nthe Eufaula Adolescent Center, a facility for adolescent children.  The briefs and the record indicated that there\nwere pervasive and severe safety problems and abuse of resident children at the Center, in violation of Wyatt\nmental-illness standards 1, 7, and 19. These standards, as the court will explain later, require that the defendants\nmaintain a safe environment for residents in its mental-illness institutions. After presenting their evidence on the\nEufaula Adolescent Center, the plaintiffs filed a motion requesting preliminary injunctive relief as to these safety\nproblems.\nAlthough the court has heard all of the evidence, it is treating this motion as one for preliminary, as opposed to\nfinal, relief. The relief is preliminary in the sense that final briefs are not due until mid-July 1995, and the court will\nnot have a chance to review the mammoth record as a whole for some time thereafter. However, because, as is\nshown below, violations of the Wyatt standards at the Center are pervasive and severe and because, as a result,\nthe very health and safety of the children at the Center are threatened, some form of preliminary or interim relief\nis warranted. The need for final and long-term relief, as well as the need for other relief regarding alleged\nadditional violations of the 1986 consent decree and the Americans with Disabilities Act, will remain an open\nissue and will be addressed as part of the final disposition of this round of litigation.\nII. STANDARD FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION\nWhether to issue a preliminary injunction lies within the sound discretion of the district court. Frio Ice, S.A. v.\nSunfruit, Inc., 918 F.2d 154, 159 (11th Cir.1990). The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals has established a four-\nprong test for the district court to apply when determining whether a preliminary injunction should issue. Under\nthis test, the movant must demonstrate: (1) a substantial likelihood that the movant will prevail on the merits; (2) a\nsubstantial threat that the movant will suffer irreparable injury if the injunction is not granted; (3) the threatened\ninjury to the movant outweighs the threatened harm the injunction may do to the opposing party; and (4) granting\nthe preliminary injunction will not be adverse to the public interest. Id.; United States v. Lambert, 695 F.2d 536,\n539 (11th Cir.1983); see also Fed.R.Civ.P. 65. In the following two sections of this memorandum opinion, the\ncourt will, first, preliminary find the facts and, second, explain why, based on an application of the above four-\nprong test to these facts, some limited preliminary relief is warranted.\nIII. PRELIMINARY FINDINGS OF FACT\nA. History of Eufaula Adolescent Center\n\n1. The Place\nThe Eufaula Adolescent Center is a secure, residential treatment facility located in a remote and rural part of\n[7]\nBarbour County, Alabama.  Formerly a military base, it is comprised of several buildings 00 two dorms, a\n97\nrecreational and gym area, a school, an administration building with professional offices, and a security building.\n[8]\nThe area is surrounded by a chain link fence.  The physical plant of the children's dorms 00 old military style\n97\n[9]\nbarracks 00 is \"Spartan\" and outdated.  Furthermore, its remote location makes it difficult for families to visit their\n97\n[10]\nchildren and participate in therapy, and difficult to recruit qualified staff.\n2. Its Mission\nAlthough envisioned as a facility for treatment of mentally-ill adolescents in a secure environment, the Eufaula\nAdolescent Center evolved in the 1980s into a \"penal\" facility for \"antisocial adolescent, conduct disorder patients\n1413 who get in trouble with the law, and are sent to a secure psychiatric facility as a *1413 less restrictive alternative\n[11]\nto incarceration.\"  \"The fact that the [Center] was a secure facility represented a convenient resource for\ncommitment by probate judges or juvenile judges who were faced with the problems of delinquent youth. The\n[12]\nalternatives were the [Center] or a training school.\"  The Center was essentially a \"correctional facility\" with a\n[13] [14]\n\"penal atmosphere.\"  Its program was \"punitive\" and \"not nearly so therapeutic as it might have been.\"\n\"There was an excessive reliance on seclusion, a large number of patient injuries, allegations of staff abuse,\n[15]\nprogramming that was overly restrictive and punitive in nature.\"  Therefore, the Center's mission was, to speak\nkindly, confusing: in theory, it was a treatment facility; but, in reality, it was essentially a penal institution.\nThis evolution into a penal facility violated the 1986 consent decree 00 including mental-illness standards 1, 7, and\n97\n19 00 in a number of serious and flagrant ways. First and most obviously, resident children were denied court-\n97\nmandated treatment and were subjected to abuse both physically and mentally. Second, the defendants\nabandoned any effort to seek accreditation by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospital Organizations\n(JCAHO). The 1986 decree required that the defendants make substantial efforts to achieve JCAHO\naccreditation at all its psychiatric facilities. JCAHO is an independent organization of health care professionals\nwhich promulgates national standards for health care facilities. In order to become accredited, a team of doctors,\n[16]\nnurses, and administrators conducts an on-site survey at least every three years.  In October of 1987, the\ndefendants unilaterally chose, instead, to pursue and obtain accreditation by the American Association of\n[17]\nPsychiatric Services for Children (AAPSC).  AAPSC accreditation required \"very little expense or changes in\n[18]\ncurrent operation.\"  Because the defendants' action was without court approval, it can be characterized only\n[19]\nas a flagrant violation of the 1986 consent decree.\nThird, in 1990, the Wyatt Committee 00 an entity created under the terms of the 1986 consent decree to both\n97\n[20]\nmonitor the defendants' progress and to advise the defendants 00toured the Center.  The Committee found\n97\n[21]\nnumerous serious violations of the 1986 consent decree and reported back to the court.  The most disturbing\n[22]\nwas that most of the children did not belong in the Center's restrictive environment.  In May 1990, the\n1414 Committee and the defendants entered into *1414 an agreement to end placements at the Center. The court\nacknowledged this agreement in a letter to the Commissioner of Mental Health and Mental Retardation, stating\nthat \"there appears to be a general agreement between the department and the [Wyatt Committee] that the vast\nmajority of the 115 children residing at the Eufaula facility are not in need of the type of restrictive and isolated\nenvironment Eufaula currently provides, and that these children could be more appropriately served in less\n[23]\nrestrictive, community-based programs, closer to their homes and families.\"  The court stated that it was\nagreed \"that the department should develop, by no later than mid-August 1990, a detailed plan for providing both\na conceptual framework for children's mental health services and an operational plan to develop needed\n\n[24]\ncommunity-based services and to end placements at Eufaula.\"  However, the defendants did not comply with\n[25]\nthis agreement.\nIn approving the 1986 consent decree, this court wrote that \"there has been in this lawsuit a trail of broken\npromises of when there would be full compliance with the standards and orders of this court.\" Wyatt v. Wallis, No.\n3195-N, 1986 WL 69194, *6 (M.D.Ala. Sept. 22, 1986) (Thompson, J.). The defendants' actions and lack of action\nafter the 1986 decree reflect that the court's admonishment was not heeded, and that the trail continued into the\nnext decade. After two decades, it is therefore evident that the defendants do not always follow through on a\npromise, and that a court decree, absent close and direct oversight, carries with it no assurance of compliance.\nAdmittedly, beginning in the early 1990s, the defendants attempted to improve conditions at the Center. First, it\ncommissioned a consultant committee, known as the Vaughan Committee, to review the Center and make\nrecommendations. The Vaughan Committee developed a new mission statement regarding admissions,\nprogramming, staff training, and other aspects of the Center's program, moving the Center back toward treatment\n[26]\nand away from its penal dimension.  As a result of these efforts at reform, the Center has been downsized\nfrom around 115 beds at its peak to a 60-bed capacity, which is evenly divided between boys and girls ages 12 to\n[27]\n18, and children admitted to the Center must have either a serious emotional disturbance or mental illness.\nThe most egregious exclusion practice, which resembled solitary confinement in a prison more than therapeutic\n[28] [29]\nexclusion in a psychiatric facility, has ended.  Moreover, the Center has now been accredited by JCAHO.\n1415 However, it *1415 cannot be overlooked that the Vaughan Committee's report and implementation plan did not\nfocus on the needed community-based services intended to end placements at Eufaula, as promised by the\ndefendants, and that it was not until 1991 and 1992, some four or five years after the 1986 decree, that the\ndefendants began taking the steps necessary to upgrade the substandard conditions at the Center to meet\n[30]\nJCAHO accreditation requirements.\nMoreover, the evidence reflects that several of the Center's severe and pervasive problems from the 1980s and\nthe early 1990s still remain. To be sure, the Center, because of its nature, will always have somewhat of a dual\npersonality: on the one hand, the Center is a mental-illness facility and, as such, must provide treatment to its\nresidents; and, on the other hand, because its residents also suffer from conduct disorders, it must also provide a\n\"secure environment.\" The critical question, however, is whether, in spite of these recent improvements, the\nfacility is still unnecessarily \"penal\" in nature, in violation of the Wyatt standards, and not sufficiently therapeutic,\nsafe, and free from abuse. The court finds, as is shown below, that the defendants have failed to correct\nadequately the safety and abuse problems at the Center.\nB. Violations of Wyatt Safety and Abuse Standards\nAs stated, children at the Eufaula Adolescent Center are unnecessarily subjected to abuse and unsafe\n[31]\nconditions, and they do not feel safe.  This danger is reflected in three particular areas: (1) gang activity; (2)\nstaff abuse of children; and (3) the use of improper restraint techniques.\n1. Gang Activity\nGang activity is current and widespread at the Center. Many children credibly attested: \"There are gangs here [at\n[32]\nthe Center]. They hit and kick and beat up on kids.\"  \"The gangs are known to jump on kids they don't like and\n[33]\nto hit and punch kids that are not members of their gang.\"  Gang members are sent on \"missions\" where they\n[34]\n\"get higher ranks for beating other people up.\"  Or the mission may involve \"males mak[ing] the female do sex\n[35]\nacts with them.\"\nThe gangs create fear in the children at the Center. As one child attested, \"The gangs scare me ... I feel\n[36]\nthreatened for my physical safety here. This is not a safe place for kids to be.\"  And children will join gangs in\norder to feel safer and avoid being beat up. As one child stated, \"I joined a gang because I kept getting hit and I\n\n[37]\nthought once I joined people would leave me alone.\"  In order to identify with a gang, a child may tattoo\n[38]\nhimself or herself with a gang symbol.\nThe gang activity is not only current and widespread, it has been longstanding and within the defendants'\nknowledge for some time. Dr. Buzogany, a member of the Vaughan Committee, testified that he and the\n[39]\nDepartment of Mental Health and Mental Retardation were aware that gang activity existed at the Center.\nAdditionally, AAPSC noted in its report of accreditation review and recommendations that the Center itself had\n[40]\nreported that it had continuing problems with gangs.\n1416 *1416 The defendants have failed to address adequately the gang activity at the Center. Other than telling\n[41]\nchildren to throw away gang signs or not wear gang colors, little else is done to eliminate gang activity.  Thus,\nchildren do not feel safe and do not feel as though they have any recourse. As one child stated, \"I don't believe\n[42]\nany of the staff put much effort into trying to stop the gangs here.\"  And another expressed similar frustrations:\n\"The staffs know there are gangs here and that there is gang violence here but they do nothing about it except\ntell us we cannot wear [gang] `colors.' They know a lot of the fights that happen here are because of the gangs\nbut they still don't do anything to try to stop the gangs. They just act like the gangs do not exist, but they do. It is\n[43]\nnot a safe place here.\"  The court is convinced that gang activity is serious and pervasive at the Center and\nposes a direct and continuing threat to the safety of the children there.\nThe defendants' reaction at the hearing before the court to the evidence of gang activity is also informative. The\ndefendants accused counsel for the plaintiffs of headline seeking and sensationalism for raising gang activities as\na safety violation at the Center. And without even conducting a serious investigation of the allegations, they\n[44]\ndenied that gang activity constituted a problem at the Center.  Only after the court had openly questioned\nwhether the defendants' denial-without-investigation was indicative of how they typically reacted to problems at\n[45]\nthe Center, did the defendants conduct a serious inquiry into gang activity at the Center.  The court\nadmonished the defendants that it was deeply disappointed that, rather than blanketly denying the allegations\nwithout their own investigation, they had not stood up and promised a personal and thorough investigation of their\n1417 own and that, if the allegations proved true, there was nothing within reason the court could order that they *1417\nwould not have already done on their own to remedy the problem effectively.\nThe evidence of pervasive and serious gang activity at the Center and the defendants' reaction to the evidence\nleads the court to three important inferences. First, the defendants' tolerance of the destructive activity is\nindicative of the fact that they view the activity as natural to the facility and not worthy of any remedial effort, and\nof the further fact that they thus still view the Center as substantially penal rather then therapeutic in nature.\nSecond, unless serious problems are brought out into the open before the court and public, it is likely that the\ndefendants will not address them. And third, absent direct and continuing judicial oversight, it is likely that the\ndefendants will not remedy a serious problem, even once brought out into the open; they will often deny it without\nadequate inquiry.\n2. Staff Abuse\nThe administration at Eufaula Adolescent Center does not respond appropriately to evidence and allegations of\nstaff abuse of children. Indeed, the evidence supports the conclusion that the Center, through inaction as well as\naction, has condoned and allowed continued abuse of children. The Center has a large number of abuse and\nneglect allegations, with an excessive number of children and staff being involved in multiple incidents of abuse\n[46]\nand neglect.  During the period from November 1990 to August 1993, 42 staff members at the Center were\n[47]\ninvolved in multiple abuse and neglect investigations, representing a total of 240 incidents.  Five of the Center\n[48]\nstaff were involved in eleven or more abuse and neglect incidents each.  These numbers indicate that\nappropriate action is not taken to insure staff do not abuse their positions of control and authority over children,\nwho, of course, are naturally vulnerable.\n\nSeveral examples are illustrative of this problem. Mr. M. was involved in 13 different investigations from\nSeptember 1992 to January 1993. Shortly after beginning work, he physically abused a child by pushing him\n[49]\nagainst a wall and injuring his head.  The only remedial action taken was verbal counseling and a one-day\n[50]\nsuspension without pay.  Additional complaints were filed against Mr. M. and investigated, six for physical\nabuse and two for verbal abuse. The Center found insufficient evidence to determine whether there had been\nactual physical abuse in the six physical abuse complaints; and the Center found that two instances of verbal\n[51]\nabuse had occurred.  During one of the verbal abuse incidents, Mr. M. teased and taunted a child, making\n[52]\ninappropriate and unprofessional comments concerning a child's mother.  In the other instance, Mr. M. called\n[53]\na boy a \"white cracker,\" a \"pecker head,\" and a \"4-eyed bitch,\" and told the boy, \"suck my dick.\"  For the\nverbal abuse, the Center sent a reprimand letter for one instance and issued a verbal warning for the other. The\nCenter allowed Mr. M. to continue working with children after a substantiated instance and multiple allegations of\nphysical abuse and instances of verbal abuse, potentially placing children in danger and certainly not providing\nappropriate care. Not until March 1993 did the Center terminate him.\nAnother staff member, a mental health worker, had sexual relationships with a child at the Center. The\nDepartment's Bureau of Special Investigations found evidence \"sufficient to establish reason to believe and\n1418 probable *1418 cause to believe\" that Mr. H. engaged in sexual intercourse with a 15-year-old girl in a bathroom\n[54]\nstall.  Prior to this incident, Mr. H. had been investigated regarding five other incidents of physical abuse and\nsexual misconduct at the Center. In fact, Mr. H. had allegedly engaged in \"digital intercourse\" with the same\nwoman on August 9, 1993. A staff member reported this incident to the director of the Center on August 18, but\nhe failed to act or limit Mr. H.'s contact with children despite Mr. H.'s previous extensive record of sexual\nmisconduct and the fact that the report mentioned that Mr. H. and this girl were planning to have intercourse in\n[55]\nthe bathroom.\nThe Center's director learned of the alleged sexual intercourse in August 1993. In early September, he\ninterviewed the victim and a second child who witnessed the sexual act, and he initiated an investigation by the\nBureau of Special Investigation. The director, however, took no personnel action against Mr. H. until October 30,\nwhen he reassigned Mr. H. to the boys' dorm, and, on November 5, when he placed Mr. H. on mandatory annual\nleave. One week later, he allowed Mr. H. to resign. During the interim, before he reassigned Mr. H. to the boys'\ndorm and then placed him on leave, a resident reported that the alleged victim had been skipping classes to have\nsex with Mr. H.; the mother of a former resident called to report that her daughter had received letters from Mr. H.\nwith inappropriate sexual language; and a staff member reported that Mr. H. was on the telephone with another\n[56]\ngirl arranging to meet her in the bathroom.  Thus, the Center allowed a staff member with a history of physical\nand sexual abuse to remain in contact with children while he was undergoing an investigation for the serious\nallegation of sexually abusing a child. The Center did not reassign Mr. H. to the boys' dorm until over two months\nafter the alleged incident; and even this reassignment did not ensure he would have no contact with girls. This\nfailure to act swiftly, firmly, and adequately, placed children in danger, by exposing them to a high risk of sexual\nand physical abuse. It also sent a message to the children and staff regarding the acceptability of the\ninappropriate sexual conduct at issue.\nEqually disturbing is the defendants' failure to administer to the victim any follow-up counseling specifically\ndesigned to address this incident. Although her clinical record reflects that her therapists in individual and group\nsessions addressed this incident, it does not indicate that she received any special therapy or additional therapy\n[57]\nafter the incident was reported.  The court is further disturbed by the Center's failure to aid the victim in any\n[58]\nmanner in pursuing criminal charges.  Once the Center discharged her and she left the Center's gates, the\nCenter absolved itself of all responsibility for this incident as far as the victim was concerned.\n1419 *1419 In summary, the court finds that the Center does not respond appropriately to serious instances of staff\nabuse. The court recognizes that, because of the type of residents it has, the Center will probably have more\nfalse allegations of abuse than other facilities do, and the court further recognizes that it is impossible to prevent\nabuse from ever occurring at an institution; nevertheless, the number of incidents of abuse at the Center is\nunacceptably high.\n\n3. Use of Improper Force to Restrain Children\nStaff improperly uses dangerous physical force to restrain children at the Center. These include: hammerlocks,\nbending a child's thumb back while holding the child in a hammerlock, placing forearms against a child's neck\n[59]\nwhile the child is against a wall, and using knees in a child's back to pin the child on the ground.  Some of the\n[60]\nchildren have sustained welts, scrapes, and bruises as a result of improper restraint practices.  The\nadministration at the Center has not taken action to redress such abuse. Although the defendants report that one\n[61]\nstaff member who used improper force to restrain children has been fired,  this is only one staff member and\ndoes not address the institutional problem. This would require training staff to restrain children in a proper way,\n[62]\nand not tolerating the failure to do so. The Center has a history of tolerating such abuse.  There are proper\nand safe methods for restraining even the most volatile individuals and these should be used. Failure to use\nproven and safe methods should not be tolerated and should be firmly addressed.\nC. JCAHO Accreditation and Center Policies\nThe defendants contend that the Center's recent accreditation by JCAHO demonstrates that it provides a safe\nenvironment for children. As explained earlier, JCAHO is an independent organization of health care\nprofessionals which promulgates national standards for health care facilities. JCAHO will inspect a hospital to\ndetermine if it complies with its standards. However, as demonstrated at trial, JCAHO accreditation does not\n[63]\nmean that a facility is protecting a patients' constitutional and statutory rights to safety.  In fact, courts, which\nhave examined this question, have found that JCAHO accreditation is \"by no means an assurance that abuse\nand neglect of patients does not take place in an institution.\" Robbins v. Budke, 739 F.Supp. 1479, 1481\n(D.N.M.1990). And, indeed, this court heard a great deal of evidence on JCAHO accreditation during the 35-day\nhearing, and concludes that JCAHO accreditation does not ensure that patients are safe and not abused and\nneglected.\n1420 Admittedly, some courts have held that accreditation creates a presumption that a *1420 facility is meeting\nminimal standards of care, which include minimal safety standards. But, this is only a rebuttable prima facie\npresumption. See, e.g., Thomas S. v. Flaherty, 902 F.2d 250, 252-53 (4th Cir.),cert. denied,498 U.S. 951, 111\nS.Ct. 373, 112 L.Ed.2d 335 (1990); Woe v. Cuomo, 729 F.2d 96, 106 (2d Cir.),cert. denied,469 U.S. 936, 105\nS.Ct. 339, 83 L.Ed.2d 274 (1984). Even if the court were to accept the defendants' evidence of JCAHO\naccreditation as creating a presumption of safety, the evidence demonstrates that this presumption has been\nrebutted. Thus, while JCAHO accreditation may be evidence to be considered by the court in determining\nwhether there is compliance with certain minimal standards, the weight it should be accorded is limited.\nThe defendants also contend that they have specific policies in place to guarantee children's safety. However, the\n[64]\nmere presence of a policy if not implemented is meaningless.  In light of the above evidence, the court\nconcludes that the defendants' current policies alone, either because they are not implemented or they are not\nstrong enough, are not sufficient to ensure substantial compliance with the Wyatt safety and abuse standards.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nThe court will now consider whether the plaintiffs are entitled to preliminary injunctive relief based on the four\nfactors discussed previously.\n\nA. There Must be a Substantial Likelihood that the Plaintiffs Will\nUltimately Prevail on the Merits\nThe first element of the four-prong test has been met. The court finds that there is current, pervasive, and severe\ngang activity, staff abuse of children, and improper use of restraint techniques at the Center. Thus, the preliminary\nfindings of fact reflect that the defendants are not providing a safe environment for children at the Eufaula\nAdolescent Center in violation of Wyatt mental-illness standards 1, 7, and 19. These standards together require\n1421 that the defendants provide a safe environment.[65] Standard 1 *1421 provides that \"Patients have a right to\nprivacy and dignity.\" Wyatt, 344 F.Supp. at 379. Standard 7 outlines the procedures for and sets restrictions on\n[66]\nthe seclusion and restraint of patients. Wyatt v. King, 793 F.Supp. at 1077-79.  It provides that \"Seclusion and\nrestraint shall not be used as punishment for the convenience of staff or in a manner that causes undue physical\ndiscomfort, harm, or pain to the patient,\" id. at 1079, and that \"Patients may be placed in seclusion or physically\nrestrained only ... to prevent a patient from physically injuring himself/herself or others.\" Id. at 1077. And Standard\n19 provides that \"A patient has a right to a humane psychological and physical environment within the hospital\nfacilities. These facilities shall be designed to afford patients with comfort and safety, promote dignity, and ensure\nprivacy. The facilities shall be designed to make a positive contribution to the efficient attainment of the treatment\n[67]\ngoals of the hospital.\" Wyatt, 344 F.Supp. at 381.\nB. There Must be Proof that the Plaintiffs Will Suffer Irreparable Harm\nUnless the Injunction Issues\nThe second element has also been met. The conditions at the Center pose an immediate and substantial threat\nto the safety of children. Therefore, absent appropriate relief from this court, there is a substantial likelihood that\nthe children at the Center will suffer irreparable harm. Of course, this concern raises the issue of what court-\nordered relief would be appropriate.\n[68]\nAt the court's request, the defendants proposed a remedy to correct any safety problems.  They proposed\nthree measures: (1) to assign additional clinical staff to the boys' and girls' dormitories after school, in the\nevening, and on weekends to improve supervision of direct-care staff and patients; (2) to formulate a formal\nadministrative leave policy for the Center, in order to facilitate a faster administrative response to abuse and\nneglect allegations; and (3) to report all allegations of staff-on-child and child-on-child abuse immediately to the\nassociate commissioner to assure that the Center receives prompt attention from the highest officials at the\nDepartment when necessary. The defendants assert that these measures are clinically and administratively\nadequate, and they have implemented the first, are currently implementing the second, and will implement the\nthird as soon as a new associate commissioner is appointed.\nThe plaintiffs proposed several measures: (1) appointing a special master or review panel to supervise the\nimplementation of relief; (2) ending all admissions at the Center until it is made safe; (3) enjoining the\nCommissioner of the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation to ensure the safety, dignity, and\nhumane treatment of children at the Center; (4) appointing a program manager to implement a safety program,\namong other programs, with power over management, budget, personnel, and programs at the Center; (5)\nappointing a services developer to develop discharge, transitional, and community services for the children at the\nCenter; and (6) enjoining the defendants from reducing total spending for children and adolescent services,\nunless it can demonstrate that a reduction in spending will not affect the implementation of the court's order.\n1422 *1422 While there are positive elements in both the defendants' and the plaintiffs' proposed relief measures, the\ncourt believes that the defendants' plan does not go far enough and that the plaintiffs' plan goes too far. The\nplaintiffs' plan essentially proposes a receivership, which the court believes is unwarranted at this time, in light of\nthe fact that there appear to be other, less intrusive but still reasonably effective, measures available. The\nresponsibility for the operations of Alabama's facilities lies with the state itself, and, therefore, this court should\ninterject itself into the operation of a state institution only to the extent necessary.\n\nThe defendants' proposal is inadequate for three reasons. First, the three proposed measures are not sufficient\nto solve the safety and abuse problems at the Center. They do not address the pervasive and serious gang\nactivities. Nor do they address the improper use of force in restraining children. The court will therefore require\nthat the defendants include in their proposed measures additional measures to address these problems. Second,\nthe court cannot rely solely on a \"promise\" by the defendants to implement any proposed measures. Throughout\nthe history of this litigation, the defendants have left and continue to leave \"a trail of broken promises.\" Wyatt v.\nWallis, No. 3195-N, 1986 WL 69194, *6 (M.D.Ala. Sept. 22, 1986) (Thompson, J.). A formal court order,\nincorporating all measures necessary to address the safety problems at the Center, is warranted. The court will\ntherefore require that the defendants, after soliciting and considering input from the plaintiffs and amicus curiae\nUnites States, develop and submit all of the above measures for inclusion in a formal order.\nThird and finally, the defendants' past conduct teaches that, absent judicial oversight, even a court order is\ninadequate to assure compliance. Only when two circumstances are present does it appear that there can be any\nreasonable assurance of the defendants' immediate and substantial compliance with a court order. The first\ncircumstance is that the defendants' conduct be kept out in the open subject to scrutiny by both the court and the\npublic. The second circumstance is that there be direct pressure from an outside source. For example, only when\nthe issue of gang activity was brought out in the open and the court applied direct pressure, did the defendants\ninitiate an investigation. The court believes that the effects of these two circumstances can be achieved\nprophylactically through a limited measure: the temporary appointment of a monitor.\nThe monitor will be able to apply pressure on the defendants to move aggressively towards compliance with the \nWyatt standards by keeping the issues of safety at the Eufaula Adolescent Center out in the open for scrutiny by\nthe court and the public. While the precise duties and contours of the monitor are an issue for the defendants to\nresolve, the position should include the following:\n· The monitor must be independent and free from any influence or control by either the defendants\nor the plaintiffs. The monitor must be unbiased in both appearances and in fact.\n· The monitor must have adequate access to residents, staff, guardians, and to whomever else he\nor she needs to deal.\n· While past Wyatt monitors have been full-time, the position need not be full-time at this time. The\nmonitor must report to the court and parties at least once a month on the progress of the\ndefendants.\n· The monitor position need last for only one year from the day it is fully implemented. The court\nbelieves that the defendants should be able to comply with this order within less than one year.\nMoreover, the position should not become institutionalized. The one-year limitation should inspire\nthe monitor to complete his or her task as soon as possible. A court's purpose in institutional\nlitigation such as this is to remedy the violation and then to withdraw from any involvement in the\naffairs of the institution once it is operating in compliance with federal law. Missouri v. Jenkins, ___\nU.S. ___, ___, 115 S.Ct. 2038, 2054, 132 L.Ed.2d 63 (1995); Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467,\n489-90, 112 S.Ct. 1430, 1445, 118 L.Ed.2d 108 (1992). However, if at the end of one year it\n1423 appears that the monitor is still necessary, *1423 the court will entertain a request to extend the\nposition.\n· The defendants shall bear the fees and expenses of the monitor.\nThe court has no preference as to whether the monitor consists of one individual or a group modeled after the\nWyatt Committee.\nFinally, it is often overlooked that the court is not the only entity responsible for assuring that the defendants\ncomply with the law. Another entity is the public 00 in particular, those members of the public who have a direct\n97\ninterest in the operation of Alabama's Mental Health and Mental Retardation System because they have family\nand friends who reside in its facilities. The court will therefore direct that the defendants send to the parents or\nguardians of all residents, and their attorneys, if any, a copy of this memorandum opinion and the order and\n\npreliminary injunction accompanying this opinion. These court papers must be accompanied by a cover letter\ndrafted by counsel for defendants, with input from counsel for plaintiffs, and approved by the court. The letter\nshould explain to the parents, guardians, and their attorneys the need for them to monitor the conditions at the\nEufaula Adolescent Center by visiting it personally and frequently. The letter should also explain to them how,\nwithout fear of reprisal to either themselves or patients, they may report concerns of abuse or lack of safety to the\nindependent monitor. For a period of one year, these court papers and the cover letter shall also be furnished to\nthe parents and guardians of all future residents of the Center and their attorneys.\nC. The Threatened Injury to the Plaintiffs Must Outweigh Whatever\nDamage the Proposed Injunction May Cause the Defendants\nThe third element has also been satisfied. The court has moved conservatively. The responsibility for addressing\nthe problem of safety at the Eufaula Adolescent Center still remains where it should: with the defendants. The\ncourt has imposed a scheme limited in both time and function. The court has not required that the defendants\ncede any additional control or supervision of its facility. The court believes that this relief appropriately balances\nthe interests of both the plaintiffs and the defendants.\nD. The Injunction Must not be Adverse to the Public Interest\nFinally, the fourth element is also satisfied. Institutionalized children are \"unlikely to be able to\" protect their\ninterests or \"voice\" their rights. Wyatt v. Horsley, 793 F.Supp. 1053, 1056 (M.D.Ala.1991) (Thompson, J.). Thus,\nthe court, the parties, and the public have an especially important fiduciary responsibility to make sure that these\nchildren's interests are protected. Indeed, everyone connected with this litigation must be especially vigilant in\nmonitoring and ensuring that the children's interests, especially their safety, are secured.\nAn appropriate order and injunction will be issued.\nORDER AND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION\nIn accordance with the memorandum opinion entered this date, it is the ORDER, JUDGMENT, and DECREE of\nthe court as follows:\n(1) The plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction, filed on April 17, 1995 (Doc. no. 901), is granted.\n(2) The defendants Commissioner of the Alabama Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation and\nDirector of the Eufaula Adolescent Center are PRELIMINARILY ENJOINED and RESTRAINED from failing to\ntake immediate and affirmative steps to provide for the safety and protection from abuse of all resident children at\nthe Eufaula Adolescent Center, as required by Wyatt mental-illness standards 1, 7, and 19.\n(3) Said defendants, after receiving and considering input from plaintiffs and amicus curiae United States of\nAmerica, shall formulate and submit to the court, within 14 days, the following:\n(A) A plan containing measures, as outlined in the accompanying memorandum opinion entered\nthis date, to address and resolve immediately the severe and pervasive safety problems and\n1424 abuse of resident *1424 children at the Eufaula Adolescent Center; and\n(B) A plan, as outlined in the accompanying memorandum opinion entered this date, providing for\nindependent monitoring of the defendants' implementation of the above measures.\n(4) Within 28 days from the date of this order, said defendants shall furnish the following to the parents or\nguardians of all residents of the Eufaula Adolescent Center and their attorneys, if any: a copy of this order and\npreliminary injunction and accompanying memorandum opinion, along with a cover letter, as outlined in the\naccompanying memorandum opinion entered this date. For a period of one year, these papers and the cover\nletter shall also be furnished to the parents and guardians of all future residents of the Center and their attorneys.\n\nThe clerk of the court is DIRECTED to issue a writ of injunction.\nThe United States Marshal or her representative is DIRECTED to serve a copy of this order and preliminary\ninjunction and accompanying memorandum opinion on defendants Commissioner of the Alabama Department of\nMental Health and Mental Retardation and Director of the Eufaula Adolescent Center.\n[1] Doc. no. 901.\n[2] Modifications to the court-ordered standards have been approved.

The purpose of a live hearing was to highlight the most\npertinent and relevant parts of the already filed record. See Wyatt v. Poundstone, No. 3195 (M.D.Ala. May 8,\n1995); Wyatt v.

Building 112 consisted of a\nlong narrow corridor with cells approximately nine-by-six. Each cell had a steel grate on the top with a light fixture\nhanging down through the grate. Other than the light, there were no fixtures or furniture, the building was\nunheated, and children had to sit on the concrete floor. Plaintiffs' exh. I.B. 1(9): White report at 21-22.\nConfinement in building 112 ended only in the wake of discovery at the Center. \nThe court further notes that despite the termination of confinements in building 112, it has some concerns\nregarding current exclusion practices at the Center. B-mod is a locked ward with rooms that have no doors.\nChildren sent to B-mod are confined to their room and may not leave. A staff person sits at or near the door to\nensure the child does not leave the room. The defendants contend this is not exclusion because there is no door,\nand therefore refers to this type confinement as merely \"time-out\". No time limits or clinical oversight is exercised\non B-mod exclusions in clear violation of the Wyatt standards. Id. at 20; transcript of April 14, 1995, at 4417-19,\n4431-39, filed April 17, 1995.

He observed informal group\nactivity, such as gang markings, and noted that some children said they were in gangs, but he did not consider\nthis to constitute a \"gang\" problem. Transcript of May 16, 1995, at 8050-52, filed May 17, 1995. Whether one\nrefers to gang activities as formal and organized or informal group activity, the evidence reflects that the children\nat the Center engage in damaging rituals and threatening behavior seriously jeopardizing the safety of other\nchildren. \nThe findings of Galloway and his team regarding gang activity are also compromised by several factors. The first\ncompromising factor is the extremely narrow focus of Galloway's investigation. He limited his inquiry to the\nobservations made in the four days he and the team were at the Center. Transcript of May 15, 1995, at 7987-91,\nfiled May 16, 1995. Thus, prior incidents were ignored. Second, he did not examine virtually any hard data 00 for\n97\nexample, incident reports or the like. Id. at 7985-86. And third, despite the fact that he was at the Center to\nexamine gang activity, he did not investigate in any fashion the fact that two of the three clinical records he\nexamined while at the Center had references, either in progress notes or behavioral reports, to gang activities.\nTranscript of May 16, 1995, at 8063-78, filed May 17, 1995. For example, in one record the therapist noted that in\na session with the patient he or she \"focused on [the patient's] gang involvement.\" Id. at 8063.

Prior to this\ninstance of sexual misconduct, a girl patient had reported that Mr. H. had asked her to pull up her shirt while in\nthe gym and to go to the bathroom because he had something to show her. She also reported that Mr. H. winked\nat her and would bump into her and hit her with his hand on her bottom. The Center issued a letter of reprimand\nfor this behavior. Id. at exh. 1. Additionally, a girl had alleged that Mr. H. had something going with two other girls,\na boy had accused Mr. H. of being involved with a 15-year-old resident, and a boy admitted to assisting in the\nrelay of a letter from a girl patient to Mr. H. During the investigation of the latter incident, one girl admitted that Mr.\nH. made sexual comments, touched her breasts, patted her butt, and had asked her to have sex with him. The\ninvestigation file also indicated that another boy reported overhearing Mr. H. tell a girl patient he wanted to have\nintercourse with her. Id. at exhs. 2-4. Despite this record, Mr. H. still was in direct contact with children when he\nallegedly had sexual intercourse with a girl patient at the Center in a bathroom stall.\n[56] Plaintiffs' review of Benjamin H.'s file, filed May 16, 1995 (Doc. no. 1035), at exhs. 5b, 8, and 5c.\n[57] Notice of filing of client record (Doc. no. 924). Her progress notes indicate that this incident arose in therapy\nsessions on September 13, 21, and 28, 1993.\n[58] The incident involving Mr. H. having sexual intercourse with a girl patient in the bathroom was referred to a\ngrand jury. However, the state did not pursue criminal charges because the girl did not appear at the grand jury\nhearing.\n[59]See, e.g., Plaintiffs' exh. I.B. 1(9): White report at 11; transcript of April 13, at 4174-78, filed April 14, 1995\n(testimony of Wayne T.); transcript of April 14, 1995, at 4476-78, filed April 17, 1995 (testimony of White);\nplaintiffs' exh.

[while he was] lying on the floor.\" Plaintiffs' exh. IV.C. 4(5)(n) at 001445. The facility\ncharacterizes such conduct as neglect, not abuse, and merely issued a written reprimand to the staff member. Id.\nat 001440. After three more instances of substantiated abuse or neglect, the Center terminated this staff member,\nin light of a long record of abuse of children and inappropriate behavior. Plaintiffs' ex. IV.C. 4(5)n at 001766-69:\nletter, dated October 28, 1993, from Anthony Dykes to Mr. M.\n[63] This court has rejected the defendants' contention that JCAHO accreditation, in and of itself, demonstrates\ncompliance with any aspect of the consent decree or constitutionally required treatment. See Order, entered on\nMarch 3, 1995 (Doc. no. 680).\n\n[64]See, e.g., AAPSC report and recommendations noting that the Eufaula Adolescent Center did not follow its\nown seclusion policies. Plaintiffs' exh. IV.C. 2(3) at 002611-12.\n[65] Furthermore, the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution requires that the defendants\nprovide a safe environment to children committed to the Center. Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 324, 102\nS.Ct. 2452, 2462, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982). The right to safe conditions \"constitutes a `historic liberty interest'\nprotected substantively by the Due Process Clause.\" Id. at 315, 102 S.Ct. at 2458 (quoting Ingraham v. Wright,\n430 U.S. 651, 673, 97 S.Ct. 1401, 1413, 51 L.Ed.2d 711 (1977)). This right applies to those civilly committed for\nnonpenal purposes. See, e.g., Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 315, 102 S.Ct. at 2458; Society for Good Will to Retarded\nChildren, Inc. v. Cuomo, 737 F.2d 1239, 1246 (2d Cir. 1984). \nThe defendants contend that the majority of children at the Center are voluntarily admitted and therefore have no\ndue process right to safe conditions. However, the court disagrees with the defendants' definition of voluntary. To\nbe at an institution voluntarily means that the child may leave the institution if he or she wants. The Eleventh\nCircuit Court of Appeals has recognized that patients who enter an institution initially on a voluntary basis become\ninvoluntary patients who have due process rights under the fourteenth amendment, \"To the extent that [those]\npatients might be prevented from leaving.\" Doe v. Public Health Trust of Dade County, 696 F.2d 901, 903 n. 10\n(11th Cir.1983) (per curiam). Children at the Center may not simply check themselves out. The children are there\nbecause their behavioral problems are so severe they must be in a locked and secure facility. While it is true that,\nif a child is 14 or older he or she may request to be released, it is not true that he or she will necessarily be\nreleased. The child must request a form and apply to be released, and then wait 72 hours for approval. The\ndoctoral-level treatment staff and the psychiatrist may deny the release. Defendants' response to court's inquiry\nregarding voluntary status of residents at the Eufaula Adolescent Center, filed April 24, 1995 (Doc. no. 923), at\nexh. 5. Furthermore, under Policy No. 350-5, a facility director or clinical director \"may deny release of a client\nwho is a voluntary admission, if in his/her opinion, the release of the client would be unsafe for the client or\nothers.\" Id. at exh. 4. The director must then seek formal commitment of that resident. If the child's behavior truly\nmerits a secure facility, it is likely that this would more often than not be the case. Additionally, many of the\nvoluntarily committed children have been told that they must either voluntarily go to the Center or go to a youth\ncorrections facility. Plaintiffs' additional filing on the Eufaula Adolescent Center, filed May 1, 1995 (doc. no. 942),\nat exhs. 3, 4 and 9. These patients are not in any real sense free to leave, in that they are free only to leave to go\nto jail.\n[66] Standard 7 further provides in part: \n\"Patients have a right to be free from seclusion and physical restraint. Patients may be placed in seclusion or\nphysically restrained only (a) to prevent a patient from physically injuring himself/herself or others, (b) after\nalternative treatment interventions have been unsuccessful or after determining that alternative treatment\ninterventions would not be practicable, and (c) when authorized by a written order of a qualified physician who is\nphysically present and has examined the patient. No order for seclusion or restraint may exceed eight hours.\"\nWyatt, 793 F.Supp. at 1077-79. The standard then provides for exceptions to its application, what written orders\nfor exclusion or restraint must contain, and how patients in seclusion or restraint are to be treated and managed. \nId. at 1079.\n[67] Standard 19 then sets forth specific requirements for resident units, toilets and lavatories, showers, day\nrooms, dining facilities, linen servicing, housekeeping, geriatric-and-nonambulatory facilities, and the overall\nphysical plants. Wyatt, 344 F.Supp. at 381-83.\n[68] The court requested the defendants to submit a proposed remedy, even though they might contend that no\nremedy is necessary.

The Honorable\nFrank M. Johnson, trial judge, held that mentally ill patients \"have a constitutional right to receive such individual\ntreatment as will give each of them a reasonable opportunity to be cured or to improve his or her mental\ncondition\". Wyatt v. Stickney, M.D.Ala.1971, 325 F.Supp. 781, 784. In a later order, Judge Johnson held that the\n1307 mentally retarded patients *1307 have a constitutional right to \"such individual habilitation as will give each of\nthem a realistic opportunity to lead a more useful and meaningful life and to return to society\". Wyatt v. Stickney,\nM.D.Ala.1972, 344 F.Supp. 387, 390. The district court found that conditions at the three facilities deprived the\nplaintiffs of these constitutional rights, and ordered the defendants-appellants, Alabama officials responsible for\n\nthe administration of the state's mental health programs, to implement a detailed set of standards designed to\nensure the provision of minimally adequate treatment and habilitation at the institutions. From this order, the\nAlabama Mental Health Board and Alabama's Governor George C. Wallace bring separate appeals.\nTogether, the Mental Health Board and the Governor advance six major contentions on appeal. They contend (1)\nthat the district court erred in holding that civilly committed mental patients have a constitutional right to\ntreatment; (2) that the court lacked jurisdiction because the suit was in effect a suit against the state proscribed\nby the eleventh amendment; (3) that the case involves rights and duties not susceptible to determination by\njudicially ascertainable and manageable standards, and therefore presents a non-justiciable controversy; (4) that\nthe order of the district court invades a province of decision-making exclusively reserved to the state legislature;\n(5) that the plaintiffs were not entitled to equitable relief because they had adequate remedies at law to protect\nthe rights they asserted; and (6) that the district court erred in awarding plaintiffs a reasonable attorneys' fee.\nNeither in the district court nor on appeal to this Court have the defendants challenged the detailed set of\nstandards articulated by the district court. They have conceded that if there is a constitutional right to treatment\nenforceable by a suit for injunctive relief in federal court, those standards accurately reflect what would be\nrequired to ensure the provision of adequate treatment.\nI.\nA. The proceedings below\nThis case began innocuously enough, when a cut in the Alabama cigarette tax forced the state to fire 99\n[2]\nprofessional, subprofessional, and intern employees  at the Bryce Hospital, a state-run institution for the\nmentally ill at Tuscaloosa. The plaintiffs filed their complaint October 23, 1970. The complaint named two classes\nas plaintiffs. One, represented by Ricky Wyatt and two other named plaintiffs, appellees here, consisted of the\npatients at Bryce. The other, represented by five of the then recently terminated employees, consisted of the\nemployees who had been dismissed for budgetary reasons. The defendants were Stonewall B. Stickney, then\nExecutive Officer of the Alabama State Mental Health Board; Dr. John V. Hottel, his Chief Deputy; the members\nof the Board; then Governor Albert P. Brewer, both in his capacity as Governor and in his capacity as a member\nof the Board; and Judge Perry O. Hooper, Probate Judge of Montgomery County, both individually and as a\nrepresentative of the class consisting of all probate judges in Alabama.\nThe complaint alleged that the defendants had effected the staff reductions purely for budgetary reasons; that the\ndischarges of the 99 employees had been accomplished without notice and a hearing, and violated the\nemployees' rights under the due process clause; and that as a result of the discharges the patients at Bryce\nwould not receive adequate treatment. The complaint sought injunctive relief requiring the defendants to insure\n1308 that treatment programs then *1308 being administered at Bryce would not be interrupted or altered, and\nrequiring the defendants to rescind the terminations of the 99 employees.\nThe original complaint did not allege that treatment levels at Bryce had been inadequate before the terminations.\nFor reasons not entirely clear from the record before us, however, the focus of the litigation soon shifted from the\neffects of the October 1970 terminations to questions of the overall adequacy of the treatment afforded at the\nAlabama state mental hospitals. On January 4, 1971, the plaintiffs amended the complaint to add prayers that the\ndefendants be enjoined from operating Bryce \"in a manner that does not conform to constitutional standards of\ndelivering adequate mental treatment to its patients\"; that the Court order defendants to prepare a\n\"comprehensive constitutionally acceptable plan to provide adequate treatment in any state mental health\nfacility\"; and that the court declare that patients confined to a state mental health facility are entitled to \"adequate,\ncompetent treatment\".\nOn March 12, 1971, the district court ruled on the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. 325 F.Supp. 781.\nThe court's opinion reflected the shift in the focus of the case. In its opinion, the court declared that patients\n\"involuntarily committed through noncriminal procedures and without the constitutional protections that are\nafforded defendants in criminal proceedings\" are \"committed for treatment purposes\" and so \"unquestionably\n\nhave a constitutional right to receive such individual treatment as will give each of them a realistic opportunity to\nbe cured or to improve his or her mental condition\". 325 F.Supp. at 784. The court found that the treatment\nprograms in effect before the institution of a staff reorganization then in progress were \"scientifically and\nmedically inadequate\", failing to \"conform to any known minimums established for providing treatment for the\nmentally ill\". Id. The court stated that it was not at that time in a position to determine whether the treatment which\nwould be provided after the reorganization was completed would be adequate. Accordingly, the court allowed the\ndefendants ninety days to report progress made in the reorganization plan, and to file with the Court a \"specific\nplan\" for the provision of adequate treatment at Bryce. Also in the March 12 order, the court invited the United\nStates, through the Department of Justice and Health, Education and Welfare, to appear as amicus.\nOn August 4, 1971, the plaintiffs amended their complaint to allege that the Searcy Hospital at Mount Vernon,\nAlabama, the one other state hospital for the mentally ill in Alabama, and the Partlow State School and Hospital,\nAlabama's state facility for the mentally retarded, were being operated in a constitutionally impermissible manner.\nOn September 13, 1971, six months after the March 12 order, the defendants filed their report on proposed\nstandards of adequate treatment and their implementation. Objections to the report were later filed by the\nplaintiffs and by the United States, as well as by several interested private organizations which had been granted\n[3]\nleave to appear as amici.\nThe court announced its conclusions upon review of the report and the objections to it in an opinion issued\n1309 December 10, 1971. 334 F.Supp. 1341. In this *1309 opinion, the district court held that there are three\n\"fundamental conditions for adequate and effective treatment\": a \"humane physical and psychological\nenvironment\"; qualified staff \"in numbers sufficient to administer adequate treatment\"; and individualized\ntreatment plans. The court held that the reports before it showed \"rather conclusively\" that the treatment\nprograms at Bryce did not meet any of these conditions. It also noted that conditions at Searcy and Partlow\nseemed little better. It concluded that the defendants had failed to \"formulate minimum medical and constitutional\nstandards for the operation of these institutions\". The court scheduled a formal hearing to take evidence\nnecessary to establish standards, and said that after the hearing it, the court, would itself \"establish standards\nand in due course order their implementation\".\nThe court postponed the hearings to give the defendants another opportunity to formulate proposed minimum\nstandards. On January 17, 1972, the parties and amici met in Atlanta, Georgia, where they undertook extensive\ndiscussions concerning the proper standards of treatment at the Alabama hospitals. Out of these discussions\ncame two Memoranda of Agreement stipulating certain of the standards necessary to define what would\nconstitute minimally adequate mental treatment at a state psychiatric institution. One of the Memoranda covered\nstandards for treatment at the mental hospitals, Searcy and Bryce; the other covered standards to be imposed at\nthe school for the mentally retarded, Partlow. These Memoranda were filed with the district court at the times for\nthe hearings set for determining the proper standards. The hearing concerning Bryce and Searcy was held\n[4]\nFebruary 3 and 4, 1972; the hearing concerning Partlow was held February 28-March 2.\nThe district court announced its orders granting permanent injunctive relief in two opinions issued April 13, 1972.\nOne of the opinions concerned Partlow, the other, Bryce and Searcy. 344 F.Supp. 373 (Bryce-Searcy), 390\n(Partlow). In Partlow, Judge Johnson held that \"[b]ecause the only constitutional justification for civilly committing\na mental retardate . . . is habilitation, it follows ineluctably\" that civilly committed retardates \"have a constitutional\nright to receive such individual habilitation as will give each of them a realistic opportunity to lead a more useful\nand meaningful life and to return to society\". The Bryce-Searcy opinion summarized the court's earlier opinions,\nnoting its holding that the civilly mentally ill have a constitutional right to treatment. Beyond this, the two opinions\nwere substantially identical. Both ordered the defendants (1) to implement an elaborate set of standards of\ntreatment set forth in appendices to the opinions; (2) to establish human rights committees at the institutions to\nreview all research and treatment programs \"to ensure that the dignity and human rights of the residents are\npreserved\"; (3) to prepare and file reports within six months of the orders on the implementation of the standards;\n1310 and (4) to pay court costs and a reasonable attorneys' fee to the plaintiffs. The Partlow *1310 order also required\n[5]\nthe defendants to hire a qualified administrator for the School within sixty days.\n\nGovernor Wallace and the Mental Health Board filed separate notices of appeal May 12, 1972. On May 22,\nGovernor Wallace filed a motion for modification and for a stay pending appeal. On June 1, the district court\nissued an opinion fixing the amount due plaintiffs as attorneys' fees at $36,744.62. 344 F. Supp. at 408-411. On\nJune 26, the district court denied the motions for modification and for a stay pending appeal. This Court also\ndenied a motion for a stay pending appeal.\nB. The conditions in the Alabama hospitals\nThere has not been any significant dispute, in this Court or in the district court, about the conditions that prevailed\nin the Alabama hospitals at the time this suit was instituted. The defendants have pitched their defense on their\nargument that the Constitution does not guarantee a right to treatment; they have virtually conceded that if such a\nconstitutional right exists, the conditions in the hospitals were such that the state's constitutional obligation to\nprovide adequate treatment could not be met. There is therefore little reason for an extended discussion of the\nconditions that prevailed at the hospitals. Some discussion, however, is essential to understanding this case. We\ntherefore note briefly how far short the hospitals fell of meeting the three \"fundamental conditions of adequate\nand effective treatment\" defined by the district court.\nFirst, it is clear that the environment at the hospitals was a far cry from the \"humane psychological and physical\nenvironment\" the district court envisioned as sine qua non of rehabilitative treatment. Bryce Hospital was built in\nthe 1850's; it had 5000 inmates of whom 1500 to 1600 were geriatrics, 1000 were mental retardates, and there\nwere allegedly other non-mentally ill persons. Patients in the hospitals were afforded virtually no privacy: the\nwards were overcrowded; there was no furniture where patients could keep clothing; there were no partitions\nbetween commodes in the bathrooms. There were severe health and safety problems: patients with open\nwounds and inadequately treated skin diseases were in imminent danger of infection because of the unsanitary\nconditions existing in the wards, such as permitting urine and feces to remain on the floor; there was evidence of\ninsect infestation in the kitchen and dining areas. Malnutrition was a problem: the United States described the\nfood as \"com[ing] closer to `punishment' by starvation\" than nutrition. At Bryce, the food distribution and\npreparation systems were unsanitary, and less than 50 cents per day per patient was spent on food. Dr. Donald\nL. Clopper, Associate Commissioner for Mental Retardation for the Alabama Department of Mental Health,\ntestified that Partlow was a \"stepchild\" in the State of Alabama; that the physical environment was inadequate for\ntreating inmates; that \"we don't have the staff we don't have the facilities, nor do we have the financial\nresources\". According to Dr. Clopper, at least 300 Partlow inmates could be discharged immediately, and about\n70 percent of the inmates should never have been committed; yet it was 60 percent over-crowded. Patients at\n1311 Partlow were forced to perform uncompensated labor. Aides frequently put patients in seclusion *1311 or under\nphysical restraints, including straitjackets, without physicians' orders. One resident had been regularly confined in\na straitjacket for more than nine years. The Evaluation Report on Partlow by the American Association on Mental\nDeficiency stated that nine working residents would feed 54 young boys ground food from one very large bowl\nwith nine plates and nine spoons; \"since there were no accommodations to even sit down to eat,\" it was\nimpossible to tell which residents had been fed and which had not been fed with this system. Seclusion rooms\nwere large enough for one bed and a coffee can, which served as a toilet. The patients suffered brutality, both at\nthe hands of the aides and at the hands of their fellow patients; testimony established that four Partlow residents\n[6]\ndied due to understaffing, lack of supervision, and brutality.\nThe hospitals failed to meet the second condition, adequate staffing. The defendants' chief witness on standards\nmaintained that treatment could be delivered with the ratio of one psychiatrist, one graduate level psychologist,\nand one masters level social worker for every 125 patients, and the district court ultimately adopted this\nrecommendation. The organizations appearing as amici had recommended higher ratios00one psychiatrist, one\n97\npsychologist, and one social worker for every 30-50 patients. But at the time this suit was instituted there were\nratios of only one medical doctor with some psychiatric training for 5,000 patients, one Ph.D. psychologist for\nevery 1,670 patients, and one masters level social worker for every 2,500 patients at Bryce. The parties and\namici agreed completely on the minimums necessary for treatment of the mentally retarded. They agreed that\nadequate treatment could be delivered at Partlow with ratios of one masters level psychologist and one masters\nlevel social worker for every sixty patients, and one physician for every two hundred patients. Yet at Partlow there\n\nwere only one psychologist with masters level training or above for every 1,200 patients; one masters level social\nworker for every 730 patients; and one physician for every 550 patients. Of the four physicians at Partlow, two\nwere not licensed to practice in Alabama.\nA severe shortage of nonprofessional staff paralleled the inadequacies of professional staff. After a tour of Bryce,\ndefendants' own consultants noted that:\nAide staff is spread very thin, creating extreme stresses for individual aides, who at times must\ncover one or two or three wards, housing as many as 100 or 200 patients. Obviously, it is\nimpossible under such circumstances to provide anything more than a cursory observation and\nthe hope of avoiding disturbing incidents. An aide under these circumstances is hard pressed to\nmeet even minimum patient needs.\nThe institutional staff was inadequate not only in sheer numbers but also in training; there was no effective\n\"inservice training\" program for, or even any regular supervision over, the nonprofessionals.\nFinally, the evidence established that the hospitals failed to meet the third condition, individualized treatment\nprograms. According to one consultant's testimony, care of patients at Partlow was not suited to the needs of\nparticular individuals, but was instead \"geared primarily to housekeeping functions00cleaning floors, cleaning\n97\nbeds, cleaning patients00and to a continuation of work assignments\". Experts testified that the patient records\n97\n1312 kept at the hospital were wholly inadequate; that they were written in such a way as to be incomprehensible \n*1312 to the aide level staff that had prime responsibility for patient care; and that they were kept where they\nwere not accessible to the direct care staff particularly in need of them.\nII.\nThe appellants' first and principal contention on appeal is that the Constitution does not guarantee persons civilly\n[7]\ncommitted to state mental institutions a right to treatment.  This contention is largely foreclosed by our decision,\nissued since the institution of this appeal, in Donaldson v. O'Connor, 1974, 493 F.2d 507. In Donaldson, we held\nthat civilly committed mental patients have a constitutional right to such individual treatment as will help each of\nthem to be cured or to improve his or her mental condition. We reasoned that the only permissible justifications\nfor civil commitment, and for the massive abridgments of constitutionally protected liberties it entails, were the\ndanger posed by the individual committed to himself or to others, or the individual's need for treatment and care.\nWe held that where the justification for commitment was treatment, it offended the fundamentals of due process if\ntreatment were not in fact provided; and we held that where the justification was the danger to self or to others,\nthen treatment had to be provided as the quid pro quo society had to pay as the price of the extra safety it\nderived from the denial of individuals' liberty.\nOur discussion in Donaldson, briefly summarized here, answers most of the arguments made by the appellants\non this appeal against the recognition of a constitutional right to treatment. Governor Wallace, however, makes\none argument not answered by our discussion in Donaldson, and it is appropriate that we address that argument\nhere. Governor Wallace challenged the assumption, made by the district court in this case and by this Court in \nDonaldson, that the only permissible justifications for confinement are danger to self or others or need for\ntreatment. Instead, the Governor suggests, the principal justification for commitment lies in the inability of the\nmentally ill and mentally retarded to care for themselves. The essence of this argument is that the primary\nfunction of civil commitment is to relieve the burden imposed upon the families and friends of the mentally\ndisabled. The families and friends of the disabled, the Governor asserts, are the \"true clients\" of the\n[8]\ninstitutionalization system.\nFrom this premise the Governor proceeds to the conclusion that is the crux of his argument. If \"need for care\" is a\n1313 justification for commitment00or is the*1313 justification00then it follows that the mere provision of custodial care\n97 97\nis constitutionally adequate to justify continued confinement. \"[T]he providing of custodial care alone is a\ntremendously important consideration to patients, their families, and the public-at-large\", the Governor writes in\nhis brief.\n\nThere are two answers to this line of argument. The first, and more limited, is that even accepting the Governor's\npremise that \"need for care\" is a constitutionally adequate justification for confinement, it does not follow that we\nmust accept the conclusion00that the kind of care that was provided at the Alabama hospitals is sufficient to make\n97\ncontinued confinement constitutional. The assertion that \"need for care\" justifies confinement implies that the\nstate has an affirmative obligation to provide a certain minimum quality \"care\", no less than the assertion that\n\"need for treatment\" justifies confinement implies that the state has an affirmative obligation to provide a certain\nminimum quality \"treatment\". And it is clear that, however that obligation might specifically be defined, it was not\nbeing met in the Alabama hospitals. Dr. Gunnar Dybwad, Professor of Human Development at the Graduate\nSchool for Advanced Studies in Social Welfare at Brandeis University, and a one time presidential consultant in\nthe field of mental retardation, made essentially this point when he testified about conditions at Alabama's\nPartlow State School and Hospital:\nThe situation which exists and obviously has existed in Partlow for a long time is one of storage, of\npersons. I am using that word because I would not use care, which involves00has a certain\n97\nqualitative character, and I would not even use the word, `custodial,' because custody, in my term,\nmeans safekeeping. And, as is visible to the visitor at the present time, employees at Partlow are \nnot in a position to effect safekeeping, considering the number of people they have to take care of;\nso I would say it is a storage problem at the moment. (Emphasis supplied.)\nIndeed, many of the standards established by the district court in this case 00notably those required for what the\n97\ndistrict court called a \"humane psychological and physical environment\"00 might have to be met for the state to be\n97\nable legitimately to claim it was providing adequate \"care\" to its mental patients. At least where the right to a\n\"humane environment\" is concerned, then if it is irrelevant whether the right be viewed as a facet of a \"right to\ntreatment\", or of a \"right to care\". It is likewise irrelevant for those purposes whether the state interest imputed to\nthe civil commitment system be called the need \"to treat\" the mentally ill, or the need \"to care\" for them.\nBut beyond this, we find it impossible to accept the Governor's underlying premise that the \"need to care\" for the\nmentally ill00and to relieve their families, friends, or guardians of the burdens of doing so00can supply a\n97 97\nconstitutional justification for civil commitment. At stake in the civil commitment context, as we emphasized in \nDonaldson, see 493 F.2d at 520, are \"massive curtailments\" of individual liberty. Against the sweeping personal\ninterests involved, Governor Wallace would have us weigh the state's interest, and the interests of the friends and\nfamilies of the mentally handicapped in having private parties relieved of the \"burden\" of caring for the mentally ill.\nThe state interest thus asserted may be, strictly speaking, a \"rational\" state interest. But we find it so trivial beside\nthe major personal interests against which it is to be weighed that we cannot possibly accept it as a justification\nfor the deprivations of liberty involved.\nThe other arguments against recognition of a constitutional right to treatment for civilly committed mental patients\nadvanced by the appellants are, as we noted above, answered by our discussion in Donaldson. Following \n1314 Donaldson, we hold that the district court here did not err in finding that civilly committed *1314 mental patients\nhave a constitutional right to treatment. Our express holding in Donaldson and here rests on the quid pro quo\nconcept of \"rehabilitative treatment, or, where rehabilitation is impossible, minimally adequate habilitation and\ncare, beyond the subsistence level custodial care that would be provided in a penitentiary.\" 493 F.2d at 522.\nIII.\nThe second, third, fourth, and fifth issues raised by the appellants are also substantially affected by our decision\nin Donaldson, and present little difficulty except as to some aspects of remedy which will be discussed in Part IV,\ninfra. The argument that this suit is barred by the eleventh amendment is based largely upon Burnham v.\nDepartment of Public Health, N.D.Ga.1972, 349 F.Supp. 1335, appeal docketed, No. 72-3110, 5 Cir., Oct. 4,\n1972, a case consolidated for argument on appeal with this case. In Burnham, the court held that, because the\nright to treatment was a right arising only, if at all, under state law, a suit by citizens of the state against state\nofficials to enforce the right was barred by the eleventh amendment. Our holding in Donaldson, however, vitiates\nthis argument, of course, for we have now established that the right to treatment arises as a matter of federal\nconstitutional law under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nIn Donaldson, we addressed and rejected the argument that a constitutional right to adequate treatment would\npresent questions not susceptible to \"judicially manageable or ascertainable standards\". We held that the\njudiciary was competent to determine, at least in individual cases, whether psychiatric treatment was medically or\nconstitutionally adequate. And we said in dictum that even in cases such as this one, \"when courts are asked to\nundertake the more difficult task of fashioning institution-wide standards of adequacy\", 493 F.2d at 526, the\ncourts would be able to formulate workable standards. In Donaldson, we took note of the substantial agreement\nreached in this case among parties and amici\nin developing standards during the course of the proceedings in the lower court. We cited that development as\nevidence supporting our view that workable standards could be fashioned. We remain mindful of that\ndevelopment here, in reaffirming our belief that the right to treatment can be implemented through judicially\nmanageable standards.\nThe appellants' fourth contention is that the order of the district court invades a province of decision-making\nexclusively reserved for the state legislature. Governor Wallace argues that the order will require heavy\nexpenditures of state funds; that these funds will have to come from other state programs; and that the duty of\ncompromising and allocating funds among the many programs competing for them is a duty which must be\ndischarged by the state governor and legislature alone. Governor Wallace concedes in his brief that he is not\ncontending that \"the financial cost of complying with an established constitutional right is a valid reason for failure\nto comply\". He \"suggest[s] that before the Court decides to adopt a new constitutional right it should consider all\nof the consequences of its action, financial and social, and its effect on our federal form of government\". The\nMental Health Board makes the point in a related way, by suggesting that the district court's order here is in effect\nan order requiring the state to furnish a particular service, and by citing cases establishing the general proposition\nthat ordinarily it is not for the federal courts to say whether or in what amounts a state shall provide any particular\ngovernment benefit or service. E. g.,Fullington v. Shea, D.Colo.1970, 320 F.Supp. 500, aff'd, 404 U.S. 963, 92\nS.Ct. 345, 30 L.Ed.2d 282.\nWe find these arguments unpersuasive. It goes without saying that state legislatures are ordinarily free to choose\n1315 among various social services competing *1315 for legislative attention and state funds. But that does not mean\nthat a state legislature is free, for budgetary or any other reasons, to provide a social service in a manner which\nwill result in the denial of individuals' constitutional rights. And it is the essence of our holding, here and in \nDonaldson, that the provision of treatment to those the state has involuntarily confined in mental hospitals is\nnecessary to make the state's actions in confining and continuing to confine those individuals constitutional. That\nbeing the case, the state may not fail to provide treatment for budgetary reasons alone. \"Humane considerations\nand constitutional requirements are not, in this day, to be measured or limited by dollar considerations\". Jackson\nv. Bishop, 8 Cir. 1968, 404 F.2d 571, 580 (Blackmun, J.), quoted, Rozecki v. Gaughan, 1 Cir. 1972, 459 F.2d 6, 8.\n\"Inadequate resources can never be an adequate justification for the state's depriving any person of his\nconstitutional rights\". Hamilton v. Love, E.D.Ark. 1972, 328 F.Supp. 1182, 1194. \"[T]he obligation of the\nRespondents [prison officials] to eliminate unconstitutionalities does not depend upon what the Legislatures may\ndo\". Holt v. Sarver, E.D.Ark.1970, 309 F.Supp. 362, 385, aff'd, 8 Cir. 1971, 442 F.2d 304. See also Hawkins v.\nTown of Shaw, 5 Cir. 1971, 437 F.2d 1286, 1292.\nThis conclusion is not novel. In the context of state penal institutions, the federal courts have repeatedly\nintervened to assure that the conditions of confinement do not invade the constitutional rights of those confined. \nE. g.,Cruz v. Beto, 1972, 405 U.S. 319, 92 S. Ct. 1079, 31 L.Ed.2d 263; Johnson v. Avery, 1968, 393 U.S. 483,\n89 S.Ct. 747, 21 L.Ed.2d 718; Campbell v. Beto, 5 Cir. 1972, 460 F.2d 765; Landman v. Royster, E.D.Va.1971,\n333 F.Supp. 621; Holt v. Sarver, E.D.Ark.1970, 309 F. Supp. 362, aff'd, 8 Cir. 1971, 442 F. 2d 304. This Court has\nrecognized that \"our constitutional duties require that the courts be ever vigilant to assure that the conditions of\nincarceration do not overstep the bounds of federal constitutional limitations\". Campbell, 460 F.2d at 767-768. In\ndischarging these duties, the federal courts have in some cases entered decrees requiring substantial\nrestructuring of state prison systems, but the courts have not hesitated to enter such decrees when necessary to\nsafeguard the constitutional rights of prisoners. As the court said in Holt v. Sarver:\nLet there be no mistake in the matter; the obligation of the Respondents to eliminate existing\nunconstitutionalities does not depend upon what the Legislature may do, or upon what the\n\nGovernor may do, or, indeed, upon what Respondents may actually be able to accomplish. If\nArkansas is going to operate a Penitentiary System, it is going to have to be a system that is\ncountenanced by the Constitution of the United States.\n309 F.Supp. at 385.\nSimilar developments have occurred in the field of institutions for the detention of juveniles. Nelson v. Heyne, 7\nCir. 1974, 491 F.2d 352, aff'g, N.D.Ind. 1972, 355 F.Supp. 451; Martarella v. Kelley, S.D.N.Y.1972, 359 F.Supp.\n479, enforcing, 349 F.Supp. 575; Inmates of Boys' Training School v. Affleck, D.R.I. 1972, 346 F.Supp. 1354; \nMorales v. Turman, E.D.Tex.1973, 364 F.Supp. 166.\nThe appellants' fifth contention, that the plaintiffs had adequate remedies at law, is also unpersuasive. In the \nBurnham case, the court held that the legal remedies of \"habeas corpus, medical malpractice, and ordinary tort\nactions\" would supply adequate remedies to mental patients who claimed to have been denied a right to\ntreatment. 349 F.Supp. at 1343. It found the plaintiffs' arguments to the contrary \"inconsistent with plaintiffs\nargument that each individual patient should have his particular therapy or treatment personalized\". Id. Governor\nWallace and the Mental Health Board urge here the argument that damage and habeas corpus actions provide\n1316 adequate legal remedies to the plaintiffs. They also point to the *1316 plaintiffs' argument that treatment must be\nindividualized, and to the tension between that argument and the plaintiffs' insistence that injunctive relief on\nbehalf of the plaintiff class is appropriate in this case.\nWe are unable to agree that injunctive relief is inappropriate merely because damages or habeas corpus relief\nmay be available to some or all individual plaintiffs. While habeas corpus and tort remedies should play a\nvaluable, indeed essential, role in enforcing the constitutional rights we recognized in Donaldson, those remedies\nare not capable of ensuring what the plaintiffs seek to ensure in this case. In the first place, habeas corpus relief\nand tort damages are available only after the fact of a failure to provide individual treatment. Here the plaintiffs\nseek preventive relief, to assure in advance that mental patients will at least have the chance to receive adequate\ntreatment by proscribing the maintenance of conditions that foredoom all mental patients inevitably to inadequate\nmental treatment. Moreover, there are special reasons why reliance upon individual suits by mental patients\nwould be especially inappropriate. Mental patients are particularly unlikely to be aware of their legal rights. They\nare likely to have especially limited access to legal assistance. Individual suits may be protracted and expensive,\nand individual mental patients may therefore be deterred from bringing them. And individual suits may produce\ndistortive therapeutic effects within an institution, since a staff may tend to give especially good00or especially\n97\n[9]\nharsh00treatment to patients the staff expects or knows to be litigious.\n97\nWe see no inconsistency between this conclusion and the position taken by the plaintiffs, and by the district court,\nthat treatment must be individualized. The plaintiffs here do not seek to guarantee that all patients will receive all\nthe treatment they need or that may be appropriate to them. They seek only to ensure that conditions in the state\ninstitutions will be such that the patients confined there will have a chance to receive adequate treatment. This\nrequires only the establishment of a program, institution-wide in scope, for developing and formulating individual\ntreatment plans; it of course does not require the formulation, in this suit, of each individual plan. The question of\nwhat is necessary to the establishment of such a program is better resolved in a class action brought on behalf of\nall patients than it would be in a series of individual suits.\nIV.\nWe pretermit decision as to the remedy decreed by the district court to the extent herein stated. As we have held,\nthe legislative power may not be used to deprive appellees of their constitutional right to treatment, but a\nsubstantial question is presented as to the scope of judicial power in implementing this right. The ultimate\nquestion will be, if all else fails, the method of effecting the financial outlay which will be necessary for the\njudiciary to give meaning to judicially prescribed minimum constitutional standards for adequate treatment of the\nmentally ill.\nPrior to the entry of the court's orders on April 13, 1972, 344 F.Supp. 373; 344 F.Supp. 387, the parties and amici\nstipulated to a number of specific conditions they agreed were necessary for a constitutionally acceptable\n\n1317 minimum treatment program.[10] Because of these stipulations, we need not and do not *1317 reach decision as\nto whether the standards prescribed by the district court are constitutionally minimum requirements, or whether it\nis within the province of a federal district court, three-judge or single judge, to prescribe standards as\ndistinguished from enjoining the operation of such institutions while constitutional rights are being violated.\nGovernor Wallace contends such stipulations are not binding on him or the Alabama legislature. As a party to the\nstipulations, through counsel, we hold the Governor has for his part agreed that these standards are minimally\nacceptable under the Constitution. The Alabama legislature presents a different problem. Clearly the Governor is\nwithout authority to agree to the expenditure of funds required to implement such a broad spectrum of standards\nwhen such a decision under Alabama law is reserved to the legislature. That the legislature was not a party to the\nstipulations in question or to this law suit reenforces this manifest principle of governmental organization. It is the\nGovernor's role to propose relief to the legislature and, having stipulated the standards, to use his best efforts to\naccomplish the relief.\nWith respect to judicial accomplishment of the remedy, profound questions are presented regarding the scope of\nsubstantive due process and the role of federal courts in matters affecting the management of state institutions.\nHere we are concerned with the operation of state mental institutions within the parameters of substantive due\n[11]\nprocess.\nThe governor argues that the prescribed remedy will entail the expenditure annually of a sum equal to sixty per\ncent of the state budget excluding school financing, and a capital improvements outlay of $75,000,000. This is\ncontested by appellees. However that may be, we regard as premature any issue as to whether the district court\nshould appoint a Special Master for the purposes of selling or encumbering state lands to finance these\nstandards, or should enjoin certain state officials from authorizing expenditures for nonessential state functions,\nand thereby alter the state budget, or by other means order a particular mode of financing the implementation of\nthe stipulated standards.\nSuch remedial propositions are by the terms of the district court's April 13, 1972 not present orders; they lie in the\nuncertain future. The district court wrote:\n\" . . . this Court has decided to reserve ruling also upon plaintiffs' motion that defendant Mental\nHealth Board be directed to sell or encumber portions of its land holdings in order to raise funds.\nSimilarly, this Court will reserve ruling on plaintiffs' motion seeking an injunction against the\ntreasurer and the comptroller of the State authorizing expenditures for nonessential State\n1318 functions, and on other aspects of plaintiffs' requested *1318 relief designed to ameliorate the\nfinancial problems incident to the implementation of this order. . . . The responsibility for\nappropriate funding ultimately must fall, of course, upon the State Legislature and, to a lesser\ndegree, upon the defendant Mental Health Board of Alabama. For the present time, the Court will\ndefer to those bodies in hopes that they will proceed with the realization and understanding that\nwhat is involved in this case is not representative of ordinary governmental functions such as\npaving roads and maintaining buildings. Rather, what is so inextricably intertwined with how the\nLegislature and Mental Health Board respond to the revelations of this litigation is the very\npreservation of human life and dignity . . .\nIn the event, though, that the Legislature fails to satisfy its well-defined constitutional obligation,\nand the Mental Health Board, because of lack of funding or any other legally insufficient reason,\nfails to implement fully the standards herein ordered, it will be necessary for the Court to take\naffirmative steps, including appointing a master, to ensure that proper funding is realized and that\nadequate treatment is available for the mentally ill in Alabama.\" 344 F.Supp. at 377-378. See also \n344 F.Supp. at 393-394. (These separate orders cover the three institutions involved.)\nTo the latter statement, the district court added in a footnote, 344 F.Supp. at 378, n. 8:\n\"The Court understands and appreciates that the Legislature is not due back in regular session\nuntil May, 1973. Nevertheless, special sessions of the Legislature are frequent occurrences in\nAlabama, and there has never been a time when such a session was more urgently required. If\n\nthe Legislature does not act promptly to appropriate the necessary funding for mental health, the\nCourt will be compelled to grant plaintiffs' motion to add various State officials and agencies as\nadditional parties to this litigation, and to utilize other avenues of fund raising.\" See also 344\nF.Supp. at 394, n. 14.\nThe district court ordered that defendants file within six months a detailed report on the implementation of the\nstipulated standards.\nThe serious constitutional questions presented by federal judicial action ordering the sale of state lands, or\naltering the state budget, or which may otherwise arise in the problem of financing, in the event the governing\nauthorities fail to move in good faith to ensure what all parties agree are minimal requirements, should not be\nadjudicated unnecessarily and prematurely. SeeAshwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 1936, 297 U.S. 288,\n346-348, 56 S.Ct. 466, 80 L.Ed. 688, 710-712 (Brandeis, J., concurring); cf.Hawkins v. Town of Shaw, 5 Cir. (en\nbanc), 1972, 461 F.2d 1171; Holt v. Sarver, 8 Cir., 1971, 442 F.2d 304, 309. Since we have now affirmed that part\nof the district court's orders recognizing the constitutional right to treatment, determination of good faith efforts by\nstate authorities to ensure these rights should be made in the first instance in the district court.\nIn any event, as a jurisdictional matter dictated by federal statute, remedies of the type contemplated in the\ndistrict court order of April 13, 1972 are required to be determined by a district court of three judges. Any federal\ndecree that state lands be sold or legislative appropriations be reallocated or enjoined would involve state laws of\nstate-wide significance within the purview of 28 U.S.C.A. § 2281. The federal injunctive decree which might be\nentered in such circumstances is required to be that of a three-judge district court. Sands v. Wainwright, supra,\n1319 491 F.2d 417. We of course make no prejudgment *1319 as to the appropriateness of any such remedial order.\nMoreover, depending on the improvements made or in progress, such remedies may be unnecessary.\nThis court views as serious a state's failure to ensure the fulfillment of appellees' constitutional rights, but the\ninterests of all concerned, and the sensitivities of our federal system, will be best served by the parties, amici,\nand court moving together to meet the constitutional requisites. This is the nature of the remedy ordered by this\ncourt in Hawkins v. Town of Shaw, supra, 461 F.2d at 1174. This appears to be the meaning and intent of the\ndistrict court's recognition of the function of the Alabama legislature within the Alabama governmental framework,\nand the court's orders of April 13, 1972 requiring reports on compliance with the stipulated standards.\nThis approach should hasten the day when the district court can be reasonably assured that appellees'\nconstitutional rights are no longer being violated, and when ultimate control over the institutions in question can\nbe returned to the state. Cf.Holt v. Sarver, supra, 442 F. 2d at 309.\nV.\nWe reserve decision on the issue presented by the awards of attorneys' fees to plaintiffs pending decision in No.\n73-1790, Gates v. Collier; No. 73-2033, Newman v. State of Alabama; and Named Individual Members of the San\nAntonio Conservation Society v. Texas Highway Department, en banc, argued and submitted on October 2, 1974.\nSee 28 U.S.C.A. § 2106 for the authority to reserve decision.\nAffirmed in part; remanded in part for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith; and decision reserved in\npart.\n[1] \"Treatment\" means care provided by mental health professionals and others that is adequate and appropriate\nfor the needs of the mentally impaired inmate. Treatment also encompasses a humane physical and\npsychological environment. The term \"habilitation\", used by the parties and amici in the district court and by the\ndistrict court in its order of April 13, 1972 (Partlow State School and Hospital) is a term used to describe that\ntreatment which is appropriate to the condition of the mental retardate. For convenience, in this opinion we group\n\"habilitation\" and \"treatment\" under the single term \"treatment\", and to include those instances where\nrehabilitation is impossible in which event the requirement is minimally adequate habilitation and care, beyond\nthe subsistence level custodial care that would be provided in a penitentiary. Donaldson v. O'Connor, 5 Cir., 1974,\n493 F.2d 507, 522.\n\n[2] The 99 employees included 41 who were assigned duties such as food service, maintenance, typing and\nother mechanical duties not involving direct patient care; 26 persons involved in planning social and other\nrecreational activities for the patients; nine persons from the department of psychology; eleven from the social\nservice department; three registered nurses, two physicians, one dentist, and six dental aides.\n[3] By order entered August 20, 1971, the district court granted the motion filed by the American Civil Liberties\nUnion, the American Orthopsychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, and the American\nAssociation on Mental Deficiency, for leave to appear as amici. In this Court, these amici have been joined by the\nNational Association for Mental Health, the American Psychiatric Association and the National Association for\nRetarded Children. The seven have filed a joint brief in this Court. \nThe district court expressed its gratitude to these organizations for their valuable assistance in this difficult and\ncomplex case, 344 F.Supp. 375, 390, and we do so, too.\n[4] At the conclusion of the Partlow hearing, the district court entered an emergency order requiring the\ndefendants to take certain immediate actions at Partlow. These included the installation of an emergency light\nsystem and procedures for emergency evacuation; revision of sanitation measures in the kitchen; revamping of\nits program for the use of drugs; conducting appropriate immunizations; and employing three hundred additional\nresident care workers. In its order filed March 2, 1972, the court said it was taking these steps \"to protect the lives\nand well-being of the residents\", because it found Partlow to be a \"warehousing institution . . . wholly incapable of\nfurnishing treatment to the mentally retarded and . . . conducive only to the deterioriation and debilitation of the\nresidents\", and because it found conditions at Partlow \"substandard to the point of endangering the health and\nlives of the residents\".\n[5] In both orders, the court refused requests made by plaintiffs and amici to appoint a master and professional\nadvisory committee to oversee implementation of the standards on grounds that \"[f]ederal courts are reluctant to\nassume control of any organization, but especially one operated by a state\". 344 F.Supp. at 377, 392-393. The\ncourt also, in both orders, reserved ruling on various motions by the plaintiffs to ensure adequate financing for the\nimplementation of the standards. These included a motion that the Mental Health Board be directed to sell or\nencumber its extensive land holdings, and a motion for an injunction against the expenditure of state funds on\nany \"nonessential\" functions until the standards were fully implemented.\n[6] One of the four died after a garden hose had been inserted into his rectum for five minutes by a working\npatient who was cleaning him; one died when a fellow patient hosed him with scalding water; another died when\nsoapy water was forced into his mouth; and a fourth died from a self-administered overdose of drugs which had\nbeen inadequately secured.\n[7] In raising the issue in this Court, the appellants contend that, because there is no constitutional right to\ntreatment, the district court lacked jurisdiction over the suit. In so arguing the issue, the appellants are following,\non this point as one the other four of their first five contentions, the decision of the Northern District of Georgia in \nBurnham v. Department of Public Health, 1972, 349 F.Supp. 1335, appeal docketed, No. 72-3110, 5 Cir., Oct. 4,\n1972. In Burnham, the court held that the Constitution does not guarantee a right to treatment. It then held that\nthe consequence of this conclusion was that it was without jurisdiction over the suit, because 28 U.S.C. § 1343\n(3), the asserted basis of jurisdiction, confers jurisdiction only over \"action[s] . . . to redress the deprivation\" of a\n\"right, privilege, or immunity\" secured by the Constitution or by an Act of Congress providing for equal rights.\n[8] Governor Wallace borrows the term \"true clients\" from the work of Professor Erving Goffman. E. Goffman.\nAsylums00Essays on the Social Situations of Mental Patients and Other Inmates 384 (1961). Governor Wallace in\n97\nhis brief praises Professor Goffman as a \"realistic writer\". Be that as it may, it is fairly clear that Professor\nGoffman's intent, in calling \"relatives, police, and judges\" the \"true clients of the mental hospitals\" was critical,\nindeed harshly so, and that Professor Goffman was insinuating by that statement an embarrassing, though rarely\nadmitted, truth about the institutionalization system in the United States. What Professor Goffman implied was\nmorally unacceptable00that the convenience of relatives and law enforcers justifies stripping away all of the\n97\nliberties of the civilly committed 00we hold today is constitutionally unacceptable.\n97\n[9] See 86 Harv.L.Rev. 1282, 1305 (1973).\n\n[10] The parties and amici submitted in two Memoranda of Agreement stipulations of standards of adequate care.\nVirtually all of the specifics of the district court's April 13, 1972 orders were taken from these stipulations. These\nstandards have not been challenged on appeal. Indeed, Governor Wallace's brief to this court begins with the\naffirmation: \"We wish to emphasize at the outset that this appellant, Governor George C. Wallace, is in full and\ncomplete agreement with the ultimate achievement of the standards and goals for mental health facilities which\nare set forth in the District Court's order[s] of April 13, 1972.\" Brief of Appellant, p. 1.\n[11] noted, supra, however rare thay may be, federal decrees mandating affirmative action expenditures by state\ngoverning authorities to ensure constitutional guarantees are not unprecedented in cases involving equal\nprotection and also cruel and unusual punishment.

In their amended\ncomplaint, plaintiffs have alleged that Partlow is being operated in a constitutionally impermissible fashion and\nthat, as a result, its residents are denied the right to adequate habilitation. Relying on these allegations, plaintiffs\nhave asked that the Court promulgate and order the implementation at Partlow of minimum medical and\nconstitutional standards appropriate for the functioning of such an institution. Plaintiffs have asked also that the\nCourt appoint a master and a professional advisory committee to oversee the implementation of judicially ordered\nguidelines and appoint a human rights committee to safeguard the personal rights and dignity of the residents.\nFinally plaintiffs have requested the Court to grant various forms of relief intended to ameliorate the financial\n[3]\ndifficulties certain to arise in connection with the upgrading of Alabama's public mental health institutions.\n390 *390 On February 28-29, 1972, the Court conducted a hearing on the issues formulated by the pleadings in this\ncase. Evidence was taken on the adequacy of conditions currently existing at Partlow as well as on the standards\n[4]\nrequisite for a constitutionally acceptable minimum habilitation program. The parties and amici  stipulated to a\nbroad array of these standards and proposed additional ones for the Court's evaluation. The case now is\n\nsubmitted upon the pleadings, the evidence, the stipulations, and the proposed standards and briefs of the\nparties.\nInitially, this Court has considered plaintiffs' position, not actively contested by defendants, that people\n[5]\ninvoluntarily committed  through non-criminal procedures to institutions for the mentally retarded have a\nconstitutional right to receive such individual habilitation as will give each of them a realistic opportunity to lead a\nmore useful and meaningful life and to return to society. That this position is in accord with the applicable legal\nprinciples is clear beyond cavil. In an analogous situation involving the mentally ill at Bryce Hospital, this Court\nsaid:\n\"Adequate and effective treatment is constitutionally required because, absent treatment, the\nhospital is transformed `into a penitentiary where one could be held indefinitely for no convicted\noffense.' Ragsdale v. Overholser, [108 U.S.App.D.C. 308] 281 F.2d 943, 950 (1960). The purpose\nof involuntary hospitalization for treatment purposes is treatment and not mere custodial care or\npunishment. This is the only justification, from a constitutional standpoint, that allows civil\ncommitments to mental institutions such as Bryce.\" Wyatt v. Stickney, 325 F.Supp. at 784.\nIn the context of the right to appropriate care for people civilly confined to public mental institutions, no viable\ndistinction can be made between the mentally ill and the mentally retarded. Because the only constitutional\njustification for civilly committing a mental retardate, therefore, is habilitation, it follows ineluctably that once\n[6]\ncommitted such a person is possessed of an inviolable constitutional right to habilitation.\n391 *391 Having recognized the existence of this right, the Court now must determine whether prevailing conditions\nat Partlow conform to minimum standards constitutionally required for a mental retardation institution. The Court's\nconclusion, compelled by the evidence, is unmistakably clear. Put simply, conditions at Partlow are grossly\nsubstandard. Testimony presented by plaintiffs and amici has depicted hazardous and deplorable inadequacies in\n[7] [8]\nthe institution's operation.  Commendably, defendants have offered no rebuttal.  At the close of the testimony,\nthe Court, having been impressed by the urgency of the situation, issued an interim emergency order \"to protect\nthe lives and well-being of the residents of Partlow.\" In that order, the Court found that:\n\"The evidence . . . has vividly and undisputedly portrayed Partlow State School and Hospital as a\nwarehousing institution which, because of its atmosphere of psychological and physical\ndeprivation, is wholly incapable of furnishing [habilitation] to the mentally retarded and is\nconducive only to the deterioration and the debilitation of the residents. The evidence has\nreflected further that safety and sanitary conditions at Partlow are substandard to the point of\nendangering the health and lives of those residing there, that the wards are grossly understaffed,\nrendering even simple custodial care impossible, and that overcrowding remains a dangerous\nproblem often leading to serious accidents, some of which have resulted in deaths of residents.\"\nWyatt v. Stickney, March 2, 1972. (Unreported Interim Emergency Order.)\nBased upon these findings, the Court has concluded that plaintiffs have been denied their right to habilitation and\nthat, pursuant to plaintiffs' request, minimum standards for constitutional care and training must be effectuated at\n392 Partlow. Consequently, having determined from a careful study of the evidence *392 that the standards set out in\n[9]\nAppendix A to this decree are medical and constitutional minimums, this Court will order their implementation.\nIn so ordering, the Court emphasizes that these standards are, indeed, minimums only peripherally approaching\nthe ideal to which defendants should aspire. It is hoped that the revelations of this case will furnish impetus to\ndefendants to provide physical facilities and habilitation programs at Partlow substantially exceeding medical and\nconstitutional minimums.\nFor the present, however, defendants must realize that the prompt institution of minimum standards to ensure the\nprovision of essential care and training for Alabama's mental retardates is mandatory and that no default can be\njustified by a want of operating funds. In this regard, the principles applicable to the mentally ill apply with equal\nforce to the mentally retarded. See Wyatt v. Stickney, 325 F.Supp. at 784-785.\n\nIn addition to requesting that minimum standards be implemented, plaintiffs have asked that defendants be\ndirected to establish a standing human rights committee to guarantee that residents are afforded constitutional\nand humane habilitation. The evidence reflects that such a committee is needed at Partlow, and this Court will\norder its initiation. This committee shall have review of all research proposals and all habilitation programs to\nensure that the dignity and human rights of residents are preserved. The committee also shall advise and assist\nresidents who allege that their legal rights have been infringed or that the Mental Health Board has failed to\ncomply with judicially ordered guidelines. At reasonable times the committee may inspect the records of the\ninstitution and interview residents and staff. At its discretion the committee may consult appropriate, independent\n[10]\nspecialists who shall be compensated by the defendant Board.  The Court will appoint seven members to\ncomprise Partlow's human rights committee, the names and addresses of whom are set forth in Appendix B to\nthis decree. Those who serve on the committee shall be paid on a per diem basis and be reimbursed for travel\nexpenses at the same rate as members of the Alabama Board of Mental Health.\nPlaintiffs, as well as amici, also have advocated the appointment of a federal master and a professional advisory\ncommittee to oversee the implementation of minimum constitutional standards. These parties maintain that\nconditions at Partlow largely are the product of shameful neglect by the state officials charged with responsibility\nfor that institution. Consequently, plaintiffs and amici insist, these state officials have proved themselves\nincapable of instituting a constitutional habilitation program. Although this Court acknowledges the intolerable\nconditions at Partlow and recognizes defendants' past nonfeasances, it, nevertheless, reserves ruling on the\n393 appointment of a master and a professional advisory committee.[11] Federal *393 courts are reluctant to assume\ncontrol of any organization, but especially one operated by a state. This Court, always having shared that\nreluctance, has adhered to a policy of allowing state officials one final opportunity to perform the duties imposed\nupon them by law. See e. g.,Sims v. Amos, 336 F.Supp. 924 (M.D.Ala.1972); Nixon v. Wallace, C.A. No. 3479-N,\nM.D.Ala., January 22, 1972. Additionally, since the entry of the interim emergency order of March 2, 1972,\ndefendants have worked diligently to upgrade conditions at Partlow in conformity with court-established\ndeadlines. These factors, combined with defendants' expressed intent that the present order will be implemented\nforthwith and in good faith, cause the Court to withhold its decision on the appointments. Nevertheless, this Court\nnotes, and the evidence demonstrates convincingly, that the operation of Partlow suffers from a virtual absence\nof administrative and managerial organization. This long-enduring organizational deficiency has been intensified\nby the lack of dynamic, permanent leadership. Regrettably, the problem has remained unresolved over the span\nof this litigation and, indeed, has been compounded by the appointment of acting and interim superintendents.\nThe massive program of reform and reorganization to be launched at Partlow requires the guidance of a\nprofessionally qualified and experienced administrator. Consequently, this Court will order that defendants\nemploy such an individual on a permanent basis. Should defendants fail to do so, or otherwise fail to comply\ntimely with the provisions of this decree, the Court will be obligated to appoint a master.\nThe Court also reserves ruling upon plaintiffs' motion that defendant Mental Health Board be directed to sell or\nencumber portions of its extensive land holdings. Similarly, this Court reserves ruling on plaintiffs' motion seeking\nan injunction against the expenditure of state funds for nonessential functions of the state, and on other aspects\nof plaintiffs' requested relief designed to ameliorate the financial problems incident to the effectuation of minimum\nmedical and constitutional standards. The Court reserves these rulings despite the fact that the primitive\nconditions, as well as the atmosphere of futility and despair which envelops both staff and residents at Partlow,\ncan be attributed largely to dire shortages of operating funds. By withholding its decisions, the Court continues to\nobserve its long-standing policy of deferring to state organizations and officials charged by law with specified\nresponsibilities. The responsibility for appropriate funding ultimately must fall, of course, upon the State\nLegislature and, only to a lesser degree, upon the defendant Mental Health Board. Unfortunately, never, since the\n[12]\nfounding of Partlow in 1923, has the Legislature adequately provided for that institution.  The result of almost\n394 fifty years of legislative neglect has been catastrophic; atrocities occur daily.[13] Although, in fairness, the *394\npresent State Legislature can be faulted relatively little for the crisis situation at Partlow, only that body can rectify\nthe gross omissions of past Legislatures. To shrink from its constitutional obligation at this critical juncture would\nbe to sanction the inhumane conditions which plague the mentally retarded of Alabama. The gravity and\nimmediacy of the situation cannot be overemphasized. At stake is the very preservation of human life and dignity.\n\nConsequently, a prompt response from the State Legislature, as well as from the Mental Health Board and other\nresponsible state officials, is imperative.\nIn the event, though, that the Legislature fails to satisfy its well-defined constitutional obligation and the Mental\nHealth Board, because of lack of funding or any other legally insufficient reason, fails to implement fully the\nstandards herein ordered, it will be necessary for the Court to take affirmative steps, including appointing a\n[14]\nmaster, to ensure that proper funding is realized  and that adequate habilitation is available for the mentally\nretarded of Alabama.\nFinally, the Court has determined that this case requires the awarding of a reasonable attorneys' fee to plaintiffs'\ncounsel. The basis for the award and the amount thereof will be considered and treated in a separate order. The\nfee will be charged against the defendants as a part of the court costs in this case.\nTo assist the Court in its determination of how to proceed henceforth, defendants will be directed to prepare and\nfile a report within six months from the date of this decree detailing the implementation of each standard herein\nordered. This report shall be comprehensive and shall include a statement of the progress made on each\nstandard not yet completely implemented, specifying the reasons for incomplete performance. The report shall\ninclude also a statement of the financing secured since the issuance of this decree and of defendants' plans for\nprocuring whatever additional financing might be required. Upon the basis of this report and other information\navailable, the Court will evaluate defendants' work and, in due course, determine the appropriateness of\nappointing a master and of granting other requested relief.\nAccordingly, it is the order, judgment, and decree of this Court:\n1. That defendants be and they are hereby enjoined from failing to implement fully and with dispatch each of the\nstandards set forth in Appendix A attached hereto and incorporated as a part of this decree;\n2. That a human rights committee for Partlow State School and Hospital be and is hereby designated and\nappointed. The members thereof are listed in Appendix B attached hereto and incorporated herein. This\ncommittee shall have the purposes, functions, and spheres of operation previously set forth in this order. The\nmembers of the committee shall be paid on a per diem basis and be reimbursed for travel expenses at the same\nrate as members of the Alabama Board of Mental Health;\n3. That defendants, within 60 days from this date, employ a professionally qualified and experienced\nadministrator to serve Partlow State School and Hospital on a permanent basis;\n395 *395 4.

STICKNEY, | as Commissioner of Mental | Health and the State of Alabama | Mental Health Officer, |\net al. | Defendants, | United States of America et al., | Amici Curiae. | \nOn Request for Attorneys' Fees\nOnce again this Court is confronted with a request for attorneys' fees made by plaintiffs involved in pro bono\n[1]\npublico litigation, and the request is well taken.  In 1967, over three years prior to the initiation of this suit, the\nAmerican Association on Mental Deficiency [hereinafter referred to as AAMD] conducted a study of Partlow State\n[2]\nSchool and Hospital.  That study, which was made available to Partlow's Director and to the State Mental\nHealth Board, portrayed the institution as one enveloped by an atmosphere of despair, hopelessness and\ndepression. The AAMD found Partlow grossly deficient virtually in every respect, including habilitation\n\nprogramming, staffing, staff training, community relations and residential facilities. At the time of the study,\nPartlow's administration and organization were found to be chaotic. The institution had promulgated no statement\nof its philosophy and objectives, and what emergency and safety procedures existed were evaluated as primitive\nand ineffective. Evidence offered at trial demonstrated that defendants also had knowledge prior to the initiation\nof this suit of the unconstitutionally substandard conditions at Bryce and Searcy Hospitals. Nevertheless,\nalthough many of the inadequacies known by defendants to exist in Alabama's mental health institutions could\nhave been corrected without large expenditures, little, if any, progress toward upgrading conditions was realized\nuntil this case was initiated. From a legal standpoint, such nonfeasance on the part of defendants constitutes bad\nfaith which necessitated the expense of litigation. This bad faith forms a valid basis for the granting of attorneys'\nfees. See e. g., Vaughan v. Atkinson, 369 U.S. 527, 530-531, 82 S.Ct. 997, 8 L.Ed.2d 88 (1961).\n409 A second, and more appropriate, justification for the Court's award, however, evolves from a kind of benefit *409\ntheory. See Mills v. Electro Auto-Lite Co., 396 U.S. 375, 90 S.Ct. 616, 24 L.Ed. 2d 593 (1970). Plaintiffs bringing\nsuits to enforce a strong national policy often benefit a class of people far broader than those actually involved in\nthe litigation. Such plaintiffs, who are said to act as \"private attorneys general,\" Newman v. Piggie Park\nEnterprises, Inc., 390 U.S. 400, 88 S.Ct. 964, 19 L.Ed.2d 1263 (1968), rarely recover significant damage awards.\nMoreover, if a violation of civil rights is alleged or if some other challenge to constituted authority is involved,\nthese plaintiffs and their attorneys may confront other, more personal obstacles to the maintenance of their\npublic-minded suits. See NAACP v. Allen, 340 F.Supp. 703 (M.D.Ala.1972). Consequently, in order to eliminate\nthe impediments to pro bono publico litigation and to carry out congressional policy, an award of attorneys' fees\nnot only is essential but also is legally required. See Lee v. Southern Home Sites, 444 F.2d 143 (5th Cir. 1971); \nSims v. Amos, 336 F.Supp. 924 (M.D.Ala.1972); NAACP v. Allen, supra; Bradley v. School Bd. of Richmond, 53\nF.R.D. 28 (E.D.Va.1971).\nThe present action clearly is one intended to be encouraged by the benefit rule. By successfully prosecuting this\nsuit, plaintiffs have benefitted not only the present residents of Bryce, Partlow and Searcy but also everyone who\nwill be confined to those institutions in the future. Veritably, it is no overstatement to assert that all of Alabama's\ncitizens have profited and will continue to profit from this litigation. So prevalent are mental disorders in our\nsociety that no family is immune from their perilous incursion. Consequently, the availability of institutions capable\nof dealing successfully with such disorders is essential and, of course, in the best interest of all Alabamians.\nDespite plaintiffs' having benefitted so many people, however, they neither sought nor recovered any damages.\nNevertheless, the expenses they incurred in vindicating the public good were considerable. To burden only\nplaintiffs with these costs not only is unfair but also is legally impermissible. See e. g., Mills v. Electro Auto-Lite\nCo., supra; Lee v. Southern Home Sites, supra. Considerations of equity require that those who profit share the\nexpense. In this case, the most logical way to spread the burden among those benefitted is to grant attorneys'\nfees. Plaintiffs clearly are entitled to a reasonable award.\nThis Court must consider, therefore, what is reasonable under the circumstances. Factors relevant to the Court's\ndetermination generally are the same as those covering grants of attorneys' fees in commercial cases. See \nBradley v. School Bd. of Richmond, supra. They include the intricacy of the case and the difficulty of proof, the\ntime reasonably expended in the preparation and trial of the case, the degree of competence displayed by the\nattorneys seeking compensation and the measure of success achieved by these attorneys. In public interest\ncases, courts also should consider the benefit inuring to the public, the personal hardships that bringing this kind\nof litigation causes plaintiffs and their lawyers, and the added responsibility of representing a class rather than\nonly individual plaintiffs.\nHaving considered these factors, the Court notes that the several aspects of the present litigation have\nsynthesized to compose a very complex case. Plaintiffs' attorneys have navigated through a heretofore\nuncharted course and, in the process, have helped establish minimum constitutional standards for mental health\ninstitutions. These attorneys have exhibited professional conscientiousness throughout the litigation, and their\n[3]\ntoil, along with that of others, has culminated in an incalculable benefit to the people of Alabama.\n410 *410 The above considerations, and others, militate in favor of the Court's granting plaintiffs' attorneys full\ncompensation. Nevertheless, the weight of these factors must be balanced against and tempered by the nature\n\nof this lawsuit. It is the duty of members of the legal profession to represent clients who are unable to pay for\ncounsel and also to bring suits in the public interest. While lawyers who satisfy this ethical responsibility should\nbe remunerated, their fees should not be exorbitant. This Court must bear in mind that the very goals plaintiffs'\nattorneys seek to achieve through litigation require great monetary outlays, most of which presently are\nunavailable. Some compromise, therefore, is essential.\nIn attempting to determine what is a reasonable fee under the circumstances, this Court is impressed with the\nphilosophy underlying the Criminal Justice Act. That Act provides for compensation to attorneys appointed to\nrepresent indigent criminal defendants. The Act's legislative history makes clear that although the amount\nprovided, $30 per in-court hour and $20 per out-of-court hour, is below normal levels of compensation in legal\npractice, it nevertheless is considered a reasonable basis upon which lawyers can carry out their professional\nresponsibility without either personal profiteering or undue financial sacrifice. 1964 U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.\nNews, p. 2997.\nThe Court is convinced that this philosophy applies with equal force to the present case. As already emphasized,\nlawyers participating in the case sub judice, as well as those participating in a Criminal Justice Act case, perform\nethical and professional responsibilities. In both cases they embark upon their participation with knowledge that\ntheir named clients are unable to pay them. Generally, however, these lawyers are not motivated by desire for\nprofit but by public spirit and sense of duty. Moreover, in both cases the rights involved, those dealing with\nrestrictions on physical freedom, are of the most profound significance to the public. These similarities justify\nreferral to the Criminal Justice Act.\nOn the basis of the fee schedule set forth in the Act, therefore, this Court has determined that a reasonable fee in\n[4]\nthis case is $30 per in-court hour and $20 per out-of-court hour.  In establishing this fee, however, the Court is\ncareful to note that the Criminal Justice Act furnishes only a very flexible standard. In a particular case, a\nreasonable fee may vary either way from that provided by the Act.\nIn addition to determining an hourly fee, the Court is obliged to decide what time is reasonable for an attorney or\nattorneys to have spent in connection with the lawsuit. Plaintiffs' lawyers, Jack Drake and Reber Boult, have filed\nstatements setting forth in detail their time expended in preparation of the case. The hours they have claimed are\nreasonable and uncontested. Plaintiffs' other lawyer, George Dean, however, has neglected to file a similar\nstatement. Instead, he has testified only that he has spent almost all of 18 months working on the case. Under\nsuch circumstances, the Court must decide the amount of time an attorney should reasonably have spent to\naccomplish the work produced. From the evidence adduced at the hearing on this matter, the Court has made\nthat determination.\nAccordingly, it is the order, judgment and decree of this Court:\n1. That attorney's fees and expenses of the Honorable George Dean in the amount of $23,600.00 be and the\n411 same *411 are hereby taxed against defendant Alabama Mental Health Board;\n2. That attorney's fees and expenses of the Honorable Jack Drake in the amount of $7,595.91 be and the same\nare hereby taxed against defendant Alabama Mental Health Board; and\n3. That attorney's fees and expenses of the Honorable Reber Boult in the amount of $5,558.71 be and the same\nare hereby taxed against defendant Alabama Mental Health Board.\nIt is further ordered that defendant Alabama Mental Health Board pay said expenses and attorneys' fees to the\nClerk of this Court within 30 days from this date. Upon receipt of these funds, the Clerk of this Court will deposit\nthem in an interest bearing account. The Clerk of this Court is ordered and directed to hold said funds in said\ninterest bearing account pending further order of this Court.\n[1] On March 12, 1971, in a formal opinion and decree, this Court held that patients involuntarily committed to\nBryce Hospital because of mental illness were being deprived of the constitutional right, which they\nunquestionably possess, \"to receive such individual treatment as [would] give each of them a realistic opportunity\nto be cured or to improve his or her mental condition.\" Wyatt v. Stickney, 325 F.Supp. 781 (M.D.Ala.1971). On\n\nAugust 12, 1971, the Court granted plaintiffs' motion to add to the lawsuit patients confined at Searcy Hospital,\nMount Vernon, Alabama, another institution which, although designed to treat the mentally ill, failed to do so in\naccordance with constitutional standards. The Court, having unavailingly afforded defendants an opportunity to\npromulgate and effectuate minimum standards for adequate treatment of the mentally ill, determined on\nDecember 10, 1971, that such standards had to be judicially formulated and ordered implemented. Wyatt v.\nStickney, 334 F.Supp. 1341 (M.D.Ala.1971). To that end, the Court conducted a hearing on February 3-4, 1972,\nat which the parties and amici submitted proposed standards for constitutionally adequate treatment, and\npresented expert testimony in support of the proposals. The aspect of the case relating to the Bryce-Searcy\nfacilities will be considered by the Court in a decree separate from the present one.\n[2] As expressed by amici in their briefs and substantiated by the evidence in this case, mental retardation refers\ngenerally to sub-average intellectual functioning which is associated with impairment in adaptive behavior. This\ndefinitional approach to mental retardation is based upon dual criteria: reduced intellectual functioning and\nimpairment in adaptation to the requirements of social living. The evidence presented reflects scientific advances\nin understanding the developmental processes of the mental retardate. The historic view of mental retardation as\nan immutable defect of intelligence has been supplanted by the recognition that a person may be mentally\nretarded at one age level and not at another; that he may change status as a result of changes in the level of his\nintellectual functioning; or that he may move from retarded to non-retarded as a result of a training program which\nhas increased his level of adaptive behavior to a point where his behavior is no longer of concern to society. See\nUnited States President's Panel on Mental Retardation, Report of the Task Force on Law, 1963. (Judge David L.\nBazelon, Chairman.)\n[3] More specifically, in a motion filed September 1, 1971, and renewed March 15, 1972, plaintiffs have asked\nthat they be permitted to join various state officials as defendants in this case. Plaintiffs maintain that these\nofficials, including, among others, the members of the State Legislature and the treasurer and the comptroller of\nAlabama, are necessary parties for the attainment of complete relief. Among the relief plaintiffs seek in\nconnection with the state officials is an injunction against the expenditure of state funds for nonessential functions\nof the state until enough money is available to provide adequately for the financial needs of the Alabama Mental\nHealth Board. In addition, plaintiffs have asked the Court to order the sale of a portion of defendant Mental Health\nBoard's land holdings and other assets and to enjoin the Board from the construction of any physical facilities,\nincluding any planned for regional centers.\n[4] The amici in this case, including the United States of America, the American Orthopsychiatric Association, the\nAmerican Psychological Association, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the American Association on Mental\nDeficiency, have performed invaluable service for which this Court is indeed appreciative.\n[5] The Court will deal in this decree only with residents involuntarily committed to Partlow because no evidence\nhas been adduced tending to demonstrate that any resident is voluntarily confined in that institution. The Court\nwill presume, therefore, that every resident of Partlow is entitled to constitutionally minimum habilitation. The\nburden falls squarely upon the institution to prove that a particular resident has not been involuntarily committed,\nand only if defendants satisfy this difficult burden of proof will the Court be confronted with whether the voluntarily\ncommitted resident has a right to habilitation.\n[6] It is interesting to note that the Court's decision with regard to the right of the mentally retarded to habilitation\nis supported not only by applicable legal authority, but also by a resolution adopted on December 27, 1971, by\nthe General Assembly of the United Nations. That resolution, entitled \"Declaration on the Rights of the Mentally\nRetarded\", reads in pertinent part: \n\". . . The mentally retarded person has a right to proper medical care and physical therapy and to such education,\ntraining, rehabilitation and guidance as will enable him to develop his ability and maximum potential.\"\n[7] The most comprehensive testimony on the conditions currently prevailing at Partlow was elicited from Dr.\nPhilip Roos, the Executive Director for the National Association for Retarded Children. Dr. Roos inspected\nPartlow over a two-day period and testified as to his subjective evaluation of the institution. In concluding his\ntestimony, Dr. Roos summarized as follows: \n\n\". . . I feel that the institution and its programs as now conceived are incapable of providing habilitation of the\nresidents. Incarceration, certainly for most of the residents, would I feel have adverse consequences; would tend\nto develop behaviors which would interfere with successful community functioning. I would anticipate to find\nstagnation or deterioration in physical, intellectual, and social spheres. The conditions at Partlow today are\ngenerally dehumanizing, fostering deviancy, generating self-fulfilling prophecy of parasitism and helplessness.\nThe conditions I would say are hazardous to psychological integrity, to health, and in some cases even to life.\nThe administration, the physical plants, the programs, and the institution's articulation with the community and\nwith the consumers reflect destructive models of mental retardation. They hark back to decades ago when the\nretarded were misperceived as being sick, as being threats to society, or as being subhuman organisms. The\nnew concepts in the field of mental retardation are unfortunately not reflected in Partlow as we see it\ntoday00concepts such as normalization, developmental model in orientation toward mental retardation, the thrust\n97\nof consumer involvement, the trend toward community orientation and decentralization of services; none of these\nare clearly in evidence in the facility today.\"\n[8] Indeed, on February 22, 1972, defendants filed with the Court a statement of position providing in relevant\npart that: \n\"Assuming that such a federal constitutional obligation exists . . ., defendants will not contest the factual accuracy\nof an ultimate finding . . . that defendants have not met the constitutional obligation to provide adequate care at\n[Partlow], . . .\"\nAt the hearing, defendants adopted the testimony of Dr. Roos in its entirety.\n[9] In addition to the standards detailed in this order, it is appropriate that defendants comply also with the\nconditions, applicable to mental health institutions, necessary to qualify Partlow for participation in the various\nprograms, such as Medicare and Medicaid, funded by the United States Government. Because many of these\nconditions of participation have not yet been finally drafted and published, however, this Court will not at this time\norder that specific Government standards be implemented.\n[10] The recitation of the licenses of this committee, and similarly, of the committees to be inaugurated at the\nBryce and Searcy facilities, is not intended to be inclusive. The human rights committee of each mental health\ninstitution shall be authorized, within the limits of reasonableness, to pursue whatever action is necessary to\naccomplish its function.\n[11] The Court's decision to reserve ruling on the appointment of a master causes it to reserve ruling also on the\nappointment of a professional advisory committee to aid the master. Nevertheless, the Court notes that the\nprofessional mental health community in the United States has responded with enthusiasm to the proposed\ninitiation of such a committee to assist in the upgrading of Alabama's mental retardation services. Consequently,\nthis Court strongly recommends to defendants that they develop a professional advisory committee comprised of\namenable professionals from throughout the country who are able to provide the expertise the evidence reflects\nis important to the successful implementation of this order.\n[12] By defendants' admission, Partlow State School and Hospital always has been a \"step-child\" of the\nstate00never having received the public support it so desperately required. Not until the short term in office of\n97\nGovernor Lurleen Wallace was any emphasis placed upon securing adequate care for Alabama's mentally\nretarded. Beginning with Mrs. Wallace's tenure in 1966, the budget for mental health has increased but remains\nwoefully short of the minimum required for constitutional care.\n[13] A few of the atrocious incidents cited at the hearing in this case include the following: (a) a resident was\nscalded to death by hydrant water; (b) a resident was restrained in a strait jacket for nine years in order to\nprevent hand and finger sucking; (c) a resident was inappropriately confined in seclusion for a period of years,\nand (d) a resident died from the insertion by another resident of a running water hose into his rectum. Each of\nthese incidents could have been avoided had adequate staff and facilities been available.\n[14] The Court realizes that the Legislature is not due back in regular session until May, 1973. Nevertheless,\nspecial sessions of the Legislature are frequent occurrences in Alabama, and there has never been a time when\n\nsuch a session was more urgently required. If the Legislature does not act promptly to appropriate the necessary\nfunding for mental health, the Court will be compelled to grant plaintiffs' motion to add various state officials and\nagencies as additional parties to this litigation and to utilize other avenues of fund raising.\n[1] See Standard 7, infra.\n[2] As is reflected in Standard 4, supra, it is contemplated that no mildly retarded persons be residents of the\ninstitution. However, until those mildly retarded who are presently residents are removed to more suitable\nlocations and/or facilities, some provision must be made for their educational program.\n[3] Approximately 50 patients at Bryce-Searcy are tubercular as also are approximately four residents at Partlow.\n[4] See n. 2, supra.\n[5] Defendants may, in lieu of employing fulltime dentists, contract outside the institution for dental care. In this\nevent the dental services provided the residents must include (a) complete dental examinations and appropriate\ncorrective dental work for each resident each six months and (b) a dentist on call 24 hours per day for emergency\nwork.\n[6] Defendants may, in lieu of employing fulltime chaplains, recruit, upon the ratio shown above, interfaith\nvolunteer chaplains.\n[1] Other such cases in which this Court has found a valid basis for the awarding of a reasonable attorneys' fee\ninclude Sims v. Amos, 336 F.Supp. 924 (M.D.Ala.1972) (three judges) and NAACP v. Allen, 340 F.Supp. 703\n(M.D.Ala.1972).\n[2] American Ass'n on Mental Deficiency Institutional Evaluation Project, Final Report For Partlow State School &\nHospital (1967).\n[3] The able and invaluable assistance which plaintiffs' attorneys received from amici in this case in no way\ndetracts from the quality of their effort. The Court is constrained, however, to comment generally on the number\nof lawyers for whom plaintiffs seek attorneys' fees. Because this case is so complex and the time required to\nmeet various deadlines so great, the Court feels that the number of lawyers utilized by plaintiffs was necessary.\nIn another case in which attorneys' fees are appropriate, the same may not be true. The Court must decide on an\nad hoc basis whether the number of attorneys employed and the time expended by them were reasonable.\n[4] In addition to regularly employed legal staff, defendants retained special counsel in this case at a rate of $30\nper hour.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

THOMPSON, District Judge.\nThis litigation is again before the court, this time on the plaintiffs' motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction\n[1]\nregarding the Eufaula Adolescent Center, pursuant to Rule 62(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The\ncourt will grant the motion to the extent that it will enter an order (1) declaring that the preliminary injunction is\n\nnow moot; (2) staying the injunction pending resolution of the appeal; and (3) informing the Eleventh Circuit Court\nof Appeals that, upon remand, the injunction would be dissolved.\nI.\nThe events leading up to the plaintiffs' motion to dissolve may be chronologically summarized as follows:\n1103 *1103July 11, 1995: The court issued a memorandum opinion finding that the resident children at the Eufaula\nAdolescent Center were not safe due to pervasive and severe safety and abuse problems. The court entered a\ncompanion order and preliminary injunction requiring the defendants to take certain interim steps to improve\nconditions there. Specifically, the court rejected the plaintiffs' request to close the Center and, instead, required\nthe defendants to do the following: (1) to prepare and implement a plan to bring the facility into compliance with\nconstitutional and Wyatt standards; (2) to provide for independent monitoring of implementation of the plan; and\n[2]\n(3) to furnish copies of the order and opinion to the parents or guardians of all residents of the Center.  With\nregard to the monitoring provision, the court stated: \"The monitor position need last for only one year from the\nday it is fully implemented. ... A court's purpose in institutional litigation such as this is to remedy the violation and\nthen to withdraw from any involvement in the affairs of the institution once it is operating in compliance with\nfederal law. Missouri v. Jenkins, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 115 S.Ct. 2038, 2054, 132 L.Ed.2d 63 (1995); Freeman v.\n[3]\nPitts, 503 U.S. 467, 489-90, 112 S.Ct. 1430, 1445, 118 L.Ed.2d 108 (1992).\"  The court placed a similar one-\nyear limit on the requirement that the defendants furnish copies of the order and opinion to the parents or\n[4]\nguardians of all residents of the Center.\n[5]\nAugust 1, 1995: The defendants filed a notice of appeal from the order and preliminary injunction,  and they\n[6]\nrequested a stay of the injunction pending appeal from this court.\n[7]\nThe defendants also submitted a proposed compliance plan for the Center.\nAugust 8, 1995: The court denied the stay but indicated that, pending appeal, it would continue \"to reassess the\n[8]\nneed for the outstanding preliminary relief.\"  Further, the court indicated that if the monitor found conditions at\nthe Center to be different from those described in the court's preliminary findings, this could \"lead to the\n[9]\ntermination of the need for any preliminary court involvement, including even appellate review.\"  Finally, the\ncourt stated that if, pending the appeal, the defendants \"redress the problems found by the court\" and the monitor\nfinds \"that some oversight [is] needed but not for a full year,\" the need for the preliminary injunction could cease\n[10]\nwithin \"a few months, at a saving to all involved.\"  \"In other words, the defendants have it within their power to\n[11]\nend the need for preliminary relief early on.\"\nAugust 24, 1995: The court rejected the defendants' proposed compliance plan and directed certain changes in\nit. The court further modified the requirements for the plan to include \"a one-year sunset provision\" \"to ensure that\nthe court's intervention in the State's operation of the Center is reasonably limited to meeting the resident safety\n[12]\nobjectives described in the July 11 memorandum opinion.\"  With this modification, all of the essential\nrequirements of the preliminary injunction would terminate in one year.\nSeptember 15, 1995: The court approved the defendants' resubmitted proposed compliance plan and ordered\nthe defendants to implement it for a period of no more than one year. In the same order, the court appointed the\ndefendants' nominee, Dr. Richard Thigpen, to be the monitor of the Center for a period of no more than one year.\n[13]\n1104 *1104August 1995: Pursuant to an agreement between the parties, the defendants ceased admitting new\n[14]\npatients to the Center.  According to the reports of the monitor filed with the court, the number of children at\n[15]\nthe Center has steadily declined since then.\nOctober 20, 1995: The monitor reported that Associate Commissioner Fetner had advised that, \"after much study,\na recommendation was being made to move towards closing the Eufaula Adolescent Center, with a possible\n\n[16]\ntimetable centering around the beginning of 1996.\"  \"It was indicated,\" according to the monitor, \"that such a\npolicy recommendation would be accompanied by proposed, alternative approaches to the mission and needs\nfulfilled at Eufaula, including possible reliance on the multi-needs approach to adolescent children's needs, as\n[17]\nprescribed by legislation in Alabama.\"\nOctober 31, 1995: In response to the monitor's report, the plaintiffs filed a letter with the court noting concerns\n[18]\nabout the defendants' plans regarding continued operation of the Center.\nNovember 14, 1995: The defendants responded to the plaintiffs' concerns regarding the Center's closing, stating\n[19]\nthat \"Defendants have not finalized any plans to close [the Center].\"\nMarch 1, 1995: The monitor reported that \"a recommendation to close [the Center] is still pending in the\nDepartment of Mental Health and Mental Retardation.... [I]f current treatment plan projections are met, all current\nresidents would be discharged by a date sometime in April.\" The monitor indicated that various proposals for the\nCenter had been suggested, including \"acquisition of the Center by the Department of Youth Services.\" The\nmonitor also indicated that, \"should admissions be reopened, indications are that operations would be continued\n[20]\non a scaled-down basis, perhaps with a census as low as 25 children.\"\nMarch 4, 1996: Associate Commissioner Fetner notified the monitor that approval had been received respecting\n[21]\nthe recommendation to close the Eufaula Adolescent Center, and that the date for closing was April 15, 1996.\nMarch 6, 1996: The monitor reported that Mr. Dykes, the Center's director, confirmed that \"the closing was to be \n[22]\ncomplete and final on April 15.\"\nMarch 7, 1996: The defendants notified the monitor that the actions taken with regard to the Center constitute a\n\"suspension of operations, effective mid-April.\" The monitor attempted to ascertain \"whether the Center is being \nclosed, as reported by me in the Report, or whether operations are being suspended.\" Defense counsel called\nthe monitor back and \"stated that information in this report, which [the monitor] read to him by phone, was correct\n[23]\nbut, from the Department's standpoint, this places the Center in the status of `suspended operations.'\"\nOn the same date, the defendants filed with the court \"A Notice of Suspension of Operations of the Eufaula\n[24]\nAdolescent Center.\"  According to a Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation news release\nattached to the notice, the suspension was \"at least in part due to a recommendation made by a committee\n1105 appointed by *1105 [Commissioner] Poundstone to review operations at all state-operated mental illness facilities\n[25]\nin terms of long-term appropriateness for customer service, overall effectiveness and cost-efficiency.\"  The\nDepartment also noted that the cost of maintaining accreditation was a factor in the decision. \"Furthermore, for\nthe facility to continue to meet accreditation standards, the state would have to replace the residential dormitory\nat a cost of approximately $5 million. The [Department] has been working with state and local officials to develop\nappropriate alternatives for adolescent mental health treatment and to explore the state's options in terms of the\n[26]\nphysical facility itself.\"\nThe Department indicated that it had made provisions to transfer the Center's 138 employees. \"The vast majority\nof these employees will be offered an opportunity to transfer to positions at other [Department] facilities. In\naddition, the [D]epartment will work with the state Personnel Department, the Alabama State Employees'\n[27]\nAssociation and others to identify vacant positions within other state agencies, and in community programs.\"\nIn the same news release, the Department also indicated, for the first time as far as the court is aware, that the\ncourt's preliminary injunction was a factor in the Center's closing or suspension of operations. \"In addition,\"\naccording to the Department, \"the preliminary injunction issued by the [court] in Wyatt, and the delays associated\n[28]\nwith the appeals, directly contributed to the decision to suspend operations.\"\nMarch 14, 1996: At a status conference held in chambers, defense counsel represented to the court that\n[29]\noperations at the Center have been suspended and that no more children are residing there.  In response to\nthe court's question as to whether the suspension was due to the plaintiffs' prior request to close the Center,\n\nmade as a part of their motion for preliminary injunction, defense counsel stated that \"This is not a recognition ...\n[30]\nof any acquiescence to the plaintiffs' request; this is based upon a funding shortfall.\"  Defense counsel also\n[31]\nacknowledged, with regard to the monitor, that they were \"not arguing that we need one\" pending appeal.  In\nresponse to the court's \"bottom-line\" question, \"Why do we need the injunction?\", defense counsel gave no\nreason other than \"I believe the injunction, just as a matter of law, is in effect because it's pending before the\n[32]\nEleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.\"  Counsel for the plaintiffs stated that \"There is no need for ... the monitor or\nfor the Abuse Protection Committee. And no need for the injunction which at the moment has no practical effect.\"\n[33]\nDefense counsel further indicated that, even if they prevailed on appeal, they could not \"answer substantively\"\nwhether they expected to resume operations at the Center. Defense counsel described the reopening of the\n[34]\nCenter as only an \"option.\"\nFrom the above events, the following is apparent: (1) the safety and abuse problems identified in prior orders no\nlonger exist at the Center because there are no longer any children residing there; (2) in view of the lack of\nfunding and the relocation of staff, the Center is unlikely to resume operations by September 1996, that is, within\nthe one-year period in which the injunction is legally enforceable; (3) in view of the recommendation by the\nCommissioner's committee that the Center be \"closed,\" and the confirmation by the Center's director that \"the \nclosing was to be complete and final,\" it is unlikely that the Center will reopen at all; and (4) in view of the other\n1106 options being explored by the defendants *1106 and the monitor's assessment of them, it is unlikely that, even if\nthe Center were to reopen, it would resume operations under conditions substantially similar to those in existence\nat the time the injunction was imposed 00 indeed, none of the options mentioned by the monitor in his reports\n97\nincludes reopening the Center on a scale and in a form similar to that at the time of the preliminary injunction.\nII.\nA.\nThe plaintiffs now move for the court to dissolve the preliminary injunction since it is no longer needed in order to\nprotect the Center's resident children. \"A case is moot when it no longer presents a live controversy with respect\nto which the court can give meaningful relief.\" Pacific Insurance Co. v. General Development Corp., 28 F.3d\n1093, 1096 (11th Cir.1994). The controversy over the injunction at the Center no longer exists. Neither the\nplaintiffs nor the defendants have offered, and this court cannot fathom, any reason why the terms of the\ninjunction should 00 or could 00 remain in effect where the purpose of the injunction was to protect the Center's\n97 97\nchildren and there are now no children subject to the injunction's protection. See, e.g., Darring v. Kincheloe, 783\nF.2d 874 (9th Cir.1986) (prisoner's claim for injunction to improve prison conditions is moot if prisoner is no longer\nsubject to those conditions); Martin v. Sargent, 780 F.2d 1334 (8th Cir.1985) (same).\nThe defendants contend that \"there is clearly a continuing dispute over the legality of conditions and care\" at the\n[35]\nCenter because the Center may reopen; thus, they argue, the controversy is not moot.  The court rejects this\ncontention for several reasons. First, as the court has found, the Center is not likely to reopen. The monitor found\nthat it had closed, and the recommendation of the Commissioner's committee was that it be closed. Second, the\nfact that the reopening of the Center remains, as defense counsel described it, an \"option,\" along with turning the\nfacility over to the Department of Youth Services, opening it as a larger facility, or opening it as a smaller facility,\nis not sufficient to keep the controversy alive for purposes of the appeal. \"Options\" are mere abstract\npropositions. It has long been settled that \"a federal court has no authority `to give opinions upon moot questions\nor abstract propositions, or to declare principles or rules of law which cannot affect the matter in issue in the case\nbefore it.'\" Brooks v. Georgia State Bd. of Elections, 59 F.3d 1114, 1118 (11th Cir.1995) (quoting Church of\nScientology of California v. United States, 506 U.S. 9, 12, 113 S.Ct. 447, 449, 121 L.Ed.2d 313 (1992)).\nThird, even if the Center reopened, it might do so in a very different form. The preliminary injunction imposed by\nthe court would hardly be applicable to a small, 25-bed facility. The injunction was carefully tailored to the\nCenter's institutional characteristics, and its provisions would not readily be transferable to a different institutional\n\nstructure. The fact that the physical facility might be used in the future, even by the Department of Mental Health\nand Mental Retardation, does not mean that the same controversy that gave rise to the need for the preliminary\ninjunction would exist.\nFourth, although there is an exception to the mootness doctrine for those controversies that are \"capable of\nrepetition, yet evading review,\" see, e.g., Brooks, 59 F.3d at 1120, it is not applicable here. This doctrine applies\nonly in exceptional situations, see City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 109, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 1669, 75\nL.Ed.2d 675 (1983), and only where there is a \"reasonable expectation or demonstrated probability that the same\ncontroversy will recur involving the same complaining party.\" Brooks, 59 F.3d at 1120. There must be more than a\n\"mere physical or theoretical possibility of recurrence.\" Id. (quoting C & C Products, Inc. v. Messick, 700 F.2d 635,\n1107 637 (11th Cir.1983)). Although the defendants insist that they maintain the option to reopen the Center, all *1107\nother evidence before the court points to the fact that this is an unlikely prospect, at least within the one-year term\nof the preliminary injunction.\nIn addition, to avail themselves of the \"evading review\" exception, the defendants would have to show that the\nchallenged action was of too short duration to be fully litigated. See Brooks, 59 F.3d at 1120. The defendants\ncannot make such a showing where the trial court still has the opportunity to address the merits of the case and\nthe parties still have an opportunity to appeal at a later point. Id. at 1121; Tropicana Products Sales, Inc. v.\nPhillips Brokerage Co., 874 F.2d 1581, 1583 (11th Cir.1989). The injunction here is only preliminary; the court has\nyet to rule on the merits of the case and, if necessary, to fashion final relief. When the court does rule on the\nmerits of the case, the parties will certainly have the opportunity to appeal the court's decision. Therefore, it\ncannot be shown that the current controversy \"evades review.\"\nThe injunction is moot on other grounds as well. The injunction and all of the accompanying orders and opinions\ncontemplate that the injunction would terminate as soon as its objectives have been met, that is, when children\nare no longer subject to safety and abuse problems at the Center. The objectives of the injunction have been\nmet, and the injunction on its terms is no longer effective. See Pacific Insurance Co. v. General Development\nCorp., 28 F.3d 1093, 1097 (11th Cir. 1994) (stating that an appeal of an injunction that has been terminated by its\nterms is moot); Tropicana Product Sales, 874 F.2d at 1581.\nB.\nBefore the court can dissolve the moot injunction, it must first consider whether it maintains jurisdiction to do so\nwhile the injunction is on appeal to the Eleventh Circuit. \"As a general rule, `[t]he filing of a notice of appeal ...\ndivests the district court of control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.'\" Pacific Insurance Co.,\n28 F.3d at 1097 n. 7 (quoting Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459 U.S. 56, 58, 103 S.Ct. 400, 402,\n74 L.Ed.2d 225 (1982)). However, Rule 62(c) creates an exception to the general rule, permitting a district court,\nin its discretion, \"to suspend, modify, restore or grant an injunction during the pendency of the appeal.\"\nFed.R.Civ.P. 62(c).\nThe plaintiffs argue that dissolution is the appropriate step under Rule 62(c) where, as here, an injunction is no\nlonger needed to preserve the rights of the party whom it was entered to protect. Rule 62(c) does not explicitly\nprovide for dissolution of an injunction pending appeal, however, and the case-law on dissolution under Rule 62\n(c) is not altogether transparent. Recently, in Pacific Insurance Co., the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals\nreserved reaching the issue of whether a district court had jurisdiction to vacate an appealed injunction as moot\nunder Rule 62(c). 28 F.3d. at 1097 n. 7. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, on the other hand, clearly stated in \nCoastal Corp. v. Texas Eastern Corp., 869 F.2d 817 (5th Cir.1989), that Rule 62(c) does not confer jurisdiction on\nthe district court to dissolve an injunction that is on appeal. Id. at 820. Noting \"an imposing thicket of jurisdictional\nthorns\" surrounding this issue, the appellate court held that dissolution is not within a district court's jurisdiction, in\npart because Rule 62(c)'s drafters must have intended to omit \"dissolve\" from the list of powers conferred upon\ncourts. Id. at 819. In any event, the question of whether this court has the power to dissolve the preliminary\ninjunction while it is on appeal is a close one. It is clear, however, that Rule 62(c) permits the court to stay the\nnow-ineffective injunction until the Court of Appeals has had the opportunity itself to consider whether the appeal\nis moot. Rule 62(c) explicitly allows a court to \"suspend\" an injunction pending appeal. This presumes that a court\n\nmay terminate operation of an injunction after it has already been put into effect if circumstances require it. Here,\nequity 00 and common sense 00 requires the court to allow the Center to return to the status quo ante. Neither the\n97 97\nplaintiffs nor the defendants want the injunction. The plaintiffs have acknowledged that the injunction is no longer\n1108 needed and have requested that the injunction be dissolved, and the defendants *1108 previously requested a\nstay. The court simply has no one before it who wants the injunction 00 at least pending appeal.\n97\nPresented with these facts, the court believes that the best course to follow is to enter a stay order, accompanied\nby a declaration of mootness and a statement to the appellate court that, upon remand, the injunction will be\ndissolved. In this way the court will acknowledge that the need for the injunction is moot, it will meet its obligation\n[36]\nto \"withdraw from involvement in the affairs of the institution\" once the need is no longer there,  and it will\navoid the difficult issue of whether a trial court has jurisdiction to dissolve a preliminary injunction pending appeal.\nC.\nAlthough it appears that neither the plaintiffs nor the defendants want the injunction to continue 00 at least pending\n97\nappeal 00 the court believes that, in light of the unsettled nature of the law in this circuit, it is prudent to go ahead\n97\nand apply the traditional factors considered by courts when confronted with a request for a stay. Generally, in\ndetermining whether to grant a stay pending appeal, courts must examine the following factors: (1) whether the\napplicants have made a strong showing that they are likely to prevail on appeal; (2) whether the applicants will be\nirreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties\ninterested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies. Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776, 107\nS.Ct. 2113, 2119, 95 L.Ed.2d 724; United States v. Bogle, 855 F.2d 707, 708 (11th Cir. 1988). Due to the unusual\nposture of this case, where the party that originally sought the injunction now requests its termination, these\nfactors cannot be rigidly applied. Nonetheless, the court will apply the Hilton principles to this case to determine\nwhether the stay can be granted.\nAs to the first factor, the court will consider the likely outcome of the appeal of the preliminary injunction. The\ninjunction is not likely to be sustained on appeal regardless of which party prevails. The plaintiffs have made a\nstrong showing that the Eleventh Circuit will dismiss the appeal for mootness. First, as discussed supra II.A., the\ninjunction on its terms contemplates that it may be terminated when its objectives have been met, and this may\nbe grounds for finding the appeal moot, see Pacific Insurance Co., 28 F.3d. at 1097. Second, \"if an event occurs\nwhile a case is pending on appeal that makes it impossible for the court to grant `any effectual relief whatever' to\na prevailing party,\" the appeal is moot. Brooks, 59 F.3d. at 1118 (quoting Church of Scientology of California, 506\nU.S. at 12, 113 S.Ct. at 449 (1992)). Since there are no more children at the Center, and the plaintiffs and the\ndefendants agree that the injunction has no purpose, it is clear that the Court of Appeals could not grant \"any\neffectual relief whatever\" to the prevailing party. Moreover, even if the defendants prevail, and the appeal is not\nfound to be moot, the injunction will not remain in its current form. The first factor weighs very heavily toward\nstaying the injunction.\nThe second and third factors also weigh toward staying the injunction. Imposing a stay is in the interests of the\nplaintiffs and the defendants. In this context, the continued operation of the injunction would impose harm on the\ndefendants, who bear the considerable costs of monitoring and maintaining an empty facility. No party will be\nharmed by the stay.\nLastly, but perhaps most significantly, the public interest clearly lies in granting the stay of the preliminary\ninjunction. Continued oversight of the Center and the costs associated with such oversight would be a wasteful\nuse of limited public funds. The court's purpose in institutional litigation such as this is to remedy the violation and\nthen to withdraw any involvement in the affairs of the institution.
