    "summary": "<p>On February 28, 1978, persons confined as patients in California under the Welfare and Institutions Act filed this class action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.  The plaintiffs filed under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the California Department of Mental Health (CDMH), the California Department of Developmental Services (CDDS), and the California Department of Health Services (CDHS).  Represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and private counsel, they sought declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that they had been administered antipsychotic medication without informed consent in violation of their Fourteenth Amendment right to due process.</p><p>After negotiations led to adoption of regulations concerning the rights of voluntary patients to informed consent, on February 27, 1981, the District Court (Judge William H. Orrick) dismissed that portion of the complaint.  </p><p>On May 12, 1981, the plaintiffs submitted a Second Amended Complaint and the District Court (Judge Orrick) certified a class consisting of adult patients at Napa State Hospital who had been or in the future would be administered antipsychotic medications and who belonged to a list of enumerated subclasses.  The subclasses included (a) patients detained for 72 hours of evaluation and treatment or (b) for 14 days of intensive treatments, and (c) committed by a temporary conservatorship or (d) by a conservator.</p><p>Further negotiations ensued and in April 1983 the parties submitted a consent decree to the District Court. Under the consent decree, the parties agreed that administration of antipsychotic drugs without informed consent to patients in any of the four subclasses implicated a liberty interest protected by the Due Process clause. In effect, the consent decree permanently enjoined the CDMH from administering antipsychotic medications to persons in the subclasses and established procedures and standards for administration of such drugs and a selection of independent reviewers.  Further, under the consent decree the court retained control of the matter to monitor the defendants' compliance as well as to modify the terms of the agreement. Judge William H. Orrick approved the consent decree on December 13, 1983.</p><p>On March 26, 1984, the court ordered the defendants to pay $600,000 in attorneys' fees and costs to the plaintiffs. </p><p>The defendants filed one status report on November 30, 1984. The consent decree remained extant, but there were no additional docket entries until 2010. </p><p>On December 17, 2010, the court received a letter from personnel at Napa State Hospital responsible for assisting the hospital to maintain compliance with the terms of the consent decree. The letter explained that the hospital had been unable to fulfill the requirements of the consent decree since October 2010 and inquired whether there had been a modification or abandonment of the terms of the consent decree.  District Judge William Alsup, who had been assigned the case while it was dormant, realized he had been an attorney for the plaintiffs in this case and recused himself from the case on January 3, 2011. The case was reassigned to Judge Saundra Brown Armstrong. </p><p>As of March 9, 2019 no new activity has occurred but the case is technically still open.</p>",

After\n3  negotiations resulting in the adoption of regulations concern-\n4  ing the rights of voluntary patients to informed consent as\n5  to the administration of such medication (Section 850 et seq.\n6  of Title 9, California Administrative Code), a dismissal of\n7  that portion of the complaint which concerned voluntary\n8  patients was entered on February 27, 1981.  On May 12, 1981,\n9  a Second Amended Complaint was filed and defendants have\n10  filed their Answer.\n11  The Court has jurisdiction over both the parties\n12  and the subject matter of this action.  The defendants are\n13  Douglas Arnold, as Interim Director of the Department of\n14  Mental Health of the State of California; Gary Macomber, as\n15  Director of the Department of Developmental Services of the\n16  State of California; and David Dawson, as Interim Director of\n17  the Department of Health Services of the State of California.\n18  The plaintiff class, certified by the Court on\n19  May 12, 1981, and amended hereby, consists of adult patients\n20  at Napa State Hospital who have been or in the future will be\n21  administered antipsychotic medications (as defined in Exhibit A\n22  to this Consent Decree) and who belong to one of the following\n23  subclasses:\n24  (1)  all patients detained for 72 hours of\n25  evaluation and treatment at Napa pursuant to California\n26  Welfare and Institutions Code Section 5150 et. šeq. ;\n27\n28\nCONSENT DECREE  2\n\n1  (2)  all patients certified for 14 days of\n2  intensive treatment at Napa pursuant to California\n3  Welfare and Institutions Code, Section 5250 et. seq.;\n4  (3)  all persons committed to Napa by a\n5  temporary conservator under a temporary conservatorship\n6  established pursuant to California Welfare and Institu-\n7  tions Code, Section 5352.1 et. seq.; and\n8  (4)  all persons committed to Napa by a\n9  conservator established pursuant to California Welfare\n10  and'Institutions Code, Section 5350 et. seq.\nH  The parties agree that administration of antipsy-\n12  chotic medications to a patient within any of the four\n13  plaintiff subclasses without the patient's informed consent\n14  implicates a liberty interest protected by the Due Process\n15  clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\n16  Constitution.  Recognizing this constitutional interest, and\n17  for the purpose of avoiding the continuation of difficult,\n18  expensive, and protracted litigation, the parties hereby\n19  waive a trial of this action, waive findings of fact and\n20  conclusions of law, and consent to entry of the order set\n21  forth in this Decree.\n22  Defendant Interim Director of the Department of\n23  Mental Health agrees that this Consent Decree is fully\n24  binding on him, each of his officers, agents, employees and\n25  successors, and all other persons acting in concert with him\n26  who have notice of this Decree.

Such discovery shall be\n21  subject to the provisions of the Discovery Order issued by\n22  the Court on August 16, 1982.  The Director of the Department\n23  of Mental Health shall prepare reports regarding compliance\n24  with this Decree six months and one year after implementation.\n25  The reports shall be served on plaintiffs within thirty days\n26  of the close of the reporting period, and filed with the\n27  Court (with any agreed modifications) thirty days thereafter.\n28\nCONSENT DECREE  5\n\n1  Plaintiffs  may file  a separate  statement  or  report  within\n2  thirty  days  after  defendants'  filing.\n3  MODIFICATION\n4  The Court retains jurisdiction to modify this\n5  Consent Decree upon motion of any party showing good cause\n6  for such a modification.\n7  Upon the understanding that the provisions of this\n8  Consent Decree can be fully performed by the Department of\n9  Mental Health of the State of California alone, the claims\n10  pleaded in the complaint against defendants Gary Macomber, as\n11  Director of the Department of Developmental Services of the\n12  State of California, and David Dawson, as Interim Director of\n13  the Department of Health Services of the State of California,\n14  are hereby dismissed.\n15  COSTS AND FEES\n16  Plaintiffs' reasonable recoverable costs and\n17  reasonable attorneys' fees and other expenses pursuant to\n18  42 U.S.C.

All  steps  required  by  these  procedures  shall  be\nfully  documented  in  the  patient's  chart.\nII.  Administration  of  Antipsychotic  Medications\nA.

The patient  has  been  informed  of  his/her  rights\nunder  these  procedures.\nB.  Requirement  of  Consent\nAntipsychotic  medication  may be  administered  to  an\nadult  patient  treated  pursuant  to  the  LPS Act\nonly  after  the  patient  has  given  informed,  voluntary\nconsent  in  writing,  except  as  otherwise  provided  in\nthese  procedures.\n1.

In  the  event  that  the\npatient  has  been  shown  the  form  and communi-\ncates  consent  but  does  not wish  to  sign  the\nwritten  consent  form,  it  shall  be  sufficient\nfor  the  physician  to  place  the  unsigned  form\nin  the  patient's  record  together  with  the\nnotation  that  while  the  patient  understands\nthe  nature  and  effect  of  antipsychotic  medica-\ntion  and consents  to  the  administration  of\nsuch  medication,  the  patient  does  not  desire\nto  sign  a written  consent  form.\n3.

Patients  admitted  pursuant  to  Section  5150  and/or\n5250  of  the  LPS Act  as  gravely  disabled.\n1.  If  a patient  admitted  pursuant  to  a  72-hour\ndetention  and/or  a 14-day  certification  pur-\nsuant  to  the  LPS Act  as  gravely  disabled\nrefuses  or  revokes  consent  to  the  administra-\ntion  of  antipsychotic  medication,  the  treating\nphysician  shall  speak  to  the  patient  to\n3.\n\ndiscuss  and  attempt  to  respond  to  the\npatient's  concern  about  the  medication.  The\nphysician  shall  suggest  the  patient  discuss\nthe  natter  with  a person  of  his/her own\nchoosing,  such  as  a relative,  friend,  or  the\npatients1  rights  advocate.\n2.  If,  after  the  discussion  with  the  patient,\nthe  physician  believes  medication  is  a neces-\nsary  part  of  the  patient's  treatment  plan and\n(1)  the  patient  still  refuses  the  medication\nand  (2)  the  physician  determines  that  the\npatient  has  the  capacity  to  give  informed  con-\nsent  in  that  the  refusal  is  not  a product  of\nthe  patient's  mental  illness,  then  medication\nshall  not  be administered,  except  as  provided\nin  Section  IV.\na.  If,  however,  the  physician  determines  (1)\nthe  patient  has  the  capacity  to  give\ninformed  consent,  and  (2)  i.  for  a\npatient  on medication,  witholding  medi-\ncation  would  result  in  substantial\ndeterioration;  ii.  for  a patient  not on\nmedication,  the  patient  is  substantially\ndeteriorating;  then  the  physician may\nrequest  an  independent  review.  Medica-\ntion  shall  not  be administered  pending\nthe  independent  review.\nb.  The  independent  reviewer  shall  then  con-\nduct  a personal  examination  of  the\npatient  and  a review  of  the  patient's\nchart  within  three  working  days.\ni.  If  the  independent  reviewer  deter-\nmines  the  patient  has  the  capacity\nto  give  informed  consent  in  that  the\npatient's  refusal  is  not  a product\nof  the  patient's  mental  illness,\nmedication  shall  not  be  admini-\nstered.\nii.  If  the  independent  reviewer  deter-\nmines  (1)  the  patient  lacks  the\ncapacity  to  give  informed  consent\nin  that  the  refusal  is  a product\nof  the  patient's  mental  illness,  and\n(2)  medication  is a necessary  part\nof  the  patient's  treatment  plan,  and\n(3)  i.  for  a patient  on medication,\nwitholding  medication  would  result\n4.\n\nin substantial deterioration; ii.\nfor a patient not on Dedication, the\npatient is substantially deterior-\nating, then medication nay be admin-\nistered as part of the patient's\ntreatment plan.\nc.  Medication nay be administered\nunder this section only so long as\nit is necessary and required to\npreclude substantial deterioration.\n3.  If, after a discussion with the patient, the\nphysician believes medication is a necessary\npart of the patient's treatment plan and the\nphysician determines (1) the patient lacks the\ncapacity to give informed consent in that the\nrefusal is a product of the patient's mental\nillness and (2) i. for a patient on medica-\ntion, witholding medication would result in\nsubstantial deterioration; ii. for a patient\nnot on medication, the patient is substan-\ntially deteriorating; then medication may be\nadministered as part of the patient's treat-\nment plan.  However, the physician shall con-\ncurrently request an independent review.\na.  The independent reviewer shall then con-\nduct a personal examination of the\npatient and a review of the patient's\nchart within three working days.\ni.  If the independent reviewer deter-\nmines (1) the patient has the capa-\ncity to give informed consent in\nthat the refusal is not a product\nof the patient's mental illness or\n(2) medication is not a necessary\npart of the patient's treatment\nplan, or (3) i. for a patient on\nmedication, witholding medication\nwould not result in substantial\ndeterioration; ii. for a patient not\non medication, the patient is not\nsubstantially deteriorating, then\nmedication shall not be adminis-\ntered, except as provided in\nSection IV.\nii.  If the independent reviewer deter-\nmines (1) the patient lacks the ¯\ncapacity to give  informed consent\nin that the refusal is a product of\n5.\n\nthe patient's »ental illness, and\n(2) •education is a necessary part\nof the patient's treatment plan, and\n(3) i. for a patient on medication,\nwitholding medication would result\nin substantial deterioration; ii.\nfor a patient not on medication the\npatient is substantially deterior-\nating, then medication nay be admin-\nistered as part part of the\npatient's treatment plan.\nb.  Medication Bay be administered under\nthis section only so long as it is\nnecessary and required to preclude sub-\nstantial deterioration.\nB.  Patients Admitted Pursuant to Section 5150\nand/or 5250 of the LPS Act as a Danger to\nOthers or a Danger to Self\n1.  A patient admitted pursuant to a 72-hour\ndetention and/or a 14-day certification pur-\nsuant to the LPS Act as Danger to Others or\nDanger to Self and for whom the treating phy-\nsician determines medication is necessary for\ntreatment, may receive medication as part of\nthe patient's treatment plan.\n2.  A patient may be treated with medications pur-\nsuant to this section only so long as the phy-\nsician determines medication continues to be\nnecessary for the preservation of life or the\nprevention of serious bodily harm to the\npatient or others.  Otherwise the provisions\nof sections III A or C apply as appropriate.\nC.  Patients Admitted Pursuant to\nSection 5350 et seq. of the LPS Act\nThe procedures of this section apply to a patient\n(1) admitted pursuant to conservatorship estab-\nlished pursuant to the LPS Act, (2) whose conser-\nvator has been granted the power to consent to\ntreatment, and  (3) who refuses or revokes consent\nor does not otherwise provide informed consent to\nthe administration of antipsychotic medication.\n1.  The treating physician shall speak to the\npatient to discuss and attempt to respond to\nthe patient's concerns, if any, about the\nmedication.  The physician shall suggest the\npatient discuss the matter with a person of\n6.\n\nhis/her own choosing, such as a relative,\nfriend, or the patients' rights advocate.\n2.  If, after the discussion with the patient, the\nphysician believes medication is a necessary\npart of the patient's treatment plan and the\npatient still refuses or has not otherwise\nprovided informed consent to the Medication,\nthe physician shall request an independent\nreview.  Medication shall not be administered\npending the independent review unless the phy-\nsician determines for a patient on medication,\nwitholding medicationwould result in substan-\ntial deterioration; or for a patient not on\nnedication, the patient is substantially\ndeteriorating.\n3.  The independent reviewer shall then conduct a\npersonal examination of the patient and a\nreview of the patient's chart within three\nworking days.\na.  If the independent reviewer determines\nmedication is a necessary form of treat-\nsent, medication may be administered as\npart of the patient's treatment plan.\nb.  If the independent reviewer determines\nmedication is not a necessary form of\ntreatment, medication shall not be\nadministered except as provided in Part IV.\nc.  The independent reviewer shall review\nevery 90 days the treatment program of\neach patient, who has refused medication\nor who has not provided informed consent\nbut is receiving medication, to determine:\ni.  Whether the patient is still\nrefusing the medication, or has not\nprovided informed consent; and\nii.  Whether medication is still a neces-\nsary part of the patient's treatment\nplan; and\niii.  Whether the other components of the\npatient'8 treatment plan are being\nimplemented.\n4.  Nothing herein, however, affects any rights of\nconservators pursuant to the LPS Act to give\nor withhold consent to treatment.\n7.\n\nIV. The Emergency Administration of Medication\nNothing in these Procedures is intended to prohibit\na physician from taking appropriate action in en\nemergency.  An emergency exists when there is a sudden\nmarked change in the patient's condition so that action\nis immediately necessary for the preservation of life or\nthe prevention of serious bodily harm to the patient or\nothers, and it is impracticable to first obtain consent.\nIf antipsychotic medication is administered during an\nemergency, such medication shall be only that which is\nrequired to treat the emergency condition and shall be\nprovided in ways that are least restrictive of the per-\nsonal liberty of the patient.\nIn the event a patient described herein at Section\nIII A 2, or III C, is administered antipsychotic medica-\ntions in an emergency, and such emergency condition is\nlikely.to last beyond 24 hours, the treating physician\nshall within that 24 hours request an independent\nreview.\nThe independent reviewer shall then conduct a\npersonal examination and review of the patient's chart\nwithin three working days.  In addition to the determi-\nnations required above, the independent reviewer shall  .\ndetermine if the emergency condition continues.\nV.  Patients' Rights Advocate\nThe patient's rights advocate shall be given\nnotice of each refusal or failure to provide informed\nconsent occuring under sections III or IV herein and\nwritten notice of and the opportunity to appear at the\nexamination by the independent reviewer.  The patient's\nrights advocate shall discuss with the patient the\npatient's objections, if any, to the medication and\nshall, whether or not present at the review, provide\nthe independent reviewer a written statement of the\npatient's reason for refusing medication.  The patient's\nrights advocate nay request an independent review\nwhenever he/she determines a patient is refusing or has\nnot provided informed consent to medication and an inde-\npendent review has not been requested.\nVI. Information as to Patients Rights\nPatients shall be informed in writing of their\nrights under these procedures prior to the administra-\ntion of medications, except in an emergency, including\nfor conservatees, their rights of judicial review pur-\nsuant to sections 5358.3 and 5364 of the LPS Act.\n8.\n\n1  PROTOCOL FOR SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT REVIEWERS\n2\n3  1.  The Department of Mental Health shall hire as many\n4  Independent Reviewers as are necessary to carry out the\n5  functions specified in the Procedures for the Administration\n6  of Antipsychotic Medications.
