    "summary": "<p>On March 11, 1987, mentally ill patients at G. Pierce Wood Memorial Hospital (GPW), filed a class action lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 against the State of Florida in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division.  The plaintiffs, represented by Florida Rural Legal Services, Advocacy Center, Southern Legal Counsel, the School Board of Manatee County, the Center for Public Representation, a public defender and private counsel, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the State was violating their constitutional rights by providing substandard care and housing at GPW, and by failing to release them when they were \"discharge ready.\"  Specifically, the plaintiffs contended that the State: (1) violated their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment by failing to discharge them into less restrictive settings; (2) denied them procedural due process in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment by arbitrarily revoking privileges without formal standards and with no opportunity for challenge; (3) abridged their First, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by arbitrarily restricting visitation privileges; (4) infringed their right to counsel in violation of the First, Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments by failing to provide legal assistance or an adequate law library, and (5) violated their Fourteenth Amendment rights by providing inadequate medical staffing, recreation, vocational training, security and nutrition.</p><p>On March 16, 1989, the District Court (Judge Paul Game, Jr.) certified a class consisting of \"all persons who are now or will in the future be committed\" to GPW, and a subclass of present and future patients \"who have been determined by their treatment team to be 'discharge ready' for a period of 15 days or longer, but who have not been discharged.\" Significantly, the court later expanded the class to include \"former patients at GPW even after they are discharged into community treatment facilities.\"</p><p>In June 1989, the parties partially settled the case by entering into a consent decree under which the State of Florida agreed to make various changes in the hospital's operations.  The consent decree provided for specific community living arrangements well beyond federal law standards.  And, on September 13, 1989, the District Court (Judge Game) appointed David Ferleger, Linda Glenn, and Dorothy Rowe as monitors as provided by the consent decree.</p><p>Following substantial litigation respecting the monitors' recommendations, on November 17, 1989, the District Court (Judge Game) adopted the monitors' workplan and budget.</p><p>On December 5, 1989, the District Court (Judge Game) denied the defendants' motion for partial summary judgment.  The defendants appealed.</p><p>On March 26, 1990, the District Court (Judge Game) denied the defendants' motion to remove the monitors.  The defendants appealed.</p><p>On March 27, 1990, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals granted the defendants' motion to expedite the appeal from the District Court's denial of partial summary judgment.</p><p>On December 12, 1990, the District Court (Judge Hodges) redefined the plaintiff class to include only those persons confined at GPW into a community treatment facility, reserved ruling on the length of the defendants' obligations to the class as well as to whether the defendants had achieved substantial compliance with the consent decree, and denied the monitors' request for access to a central abuse registry.</p><p>There followed substantial litigation concerning payment of the monitors and attorneys' fees.  On December 30, 1991, the case was reassigned to Judge Anne C. Conway.  On February 4, 1992, the District Court (Judge Conway) approved the parties' joint stipulation to reduce the number of monitors, and also created a protocol to pay the monitors including a system of reconciliations.  Numerous stipulations relating to payment followed.</p><p>The parties apparently worked out a settlement agreement and, on June 2, 1993, the District Court (Judge Conway) granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs' motion for a fairness hearing on the settlement agreement. The Court also granted a number of motions for attorney fees for the plaintiffs, throughout the course of litigation.</p><p>On January 3, 1994, the case was reassigned to Judge Susan C. Bucklew.  Litigation continued concerning reconciliation payments for monitoring and attorneys' fees and, during this time, the defendants began moving to vacate the consent decree in whole and in part, as well as to recuse the monitors.  On November 29, 1994, the District Court (Judge Bucklew) ordered the monitors to show cause why they had not yet met with the defendants to discuss a new budget.  And, on April 25, 1995, the Court referred a number of motions to Magistrate Judge Thomas B McCoun III, who recommended that the motions be denied.  On January 3 and July 11, 1995, the Court awarded the plaintiffs interim attorneys' fees.  The defendants filed interlocutory appeals for reconsideration or to amend the Court's awards.  The plaintiffs cross-appealed.</p><p>On November 13, 1995, the District Court (Judge Bucklew) referred the case to mediation and appointed Martha Cook as mediator to resolve the issues of quarterly reconciliations, payment applications, the monitors' budget and the monitors' recusal.  A settlement followed, approved by the Court on March 7, 1996.  The Court then referred to the mediator, Martha Cook, issues respecting exit criteria and legal access.</p><p>On May 15, 1996, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the defendants' appeal of the District Court's July 11, 1995, order.  On January 27, 1997, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the defendants' appeal of the District Court's January 3, 1995, order.</p><p>Previously, on May 17, 1995, the Department of Justice (DOJ) sent a letter to the Governor of Florida indicating an intent to investigate conditions at Landmark Learning Center and GPW pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. ยง 1997.  After the State of Florida repeatedly denied DOJ access to the facilities, on November 9, 1995, the DOJ sent a findings letter to the Governor basing its information on public documents.  On July 10, 1996, the United States submitted a motion to intervene in this case as a plaintiff.</p><p>On March 23, 1998, the District Court (Judge Becklew) adopted Magistrate Judge McCoun's recommendations, denying the defendants' motion to vacate, and granting the United States' motion to intervene.  </p><p>On November 18, 1998, the Magistrate Court (Judge McCoun) ordered the defendants to comply with the monitors' request for access to class members as well as to mortality and budget information.</p><p>Significant litigation followed regarding attorneys' fees, substitution of attorneys, discovery, mediation, scheduling and continuance of a trial and compliance with the consent decree, during which time several emergency motions for protective orders were granted.  </p><p>After a bench trial in August and September 2000, on June 28, 2001, the District Court (Judge Bucklew) entered judgment for the defendants and closed the case.  Johnson v. Murphy, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24013 (D. Fla. June 28, 2001).  The Court held that \"[i]n this trial, the burden of proof was on the plaintiffs to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendants are violating the statutory and constitutional right of current and former GPW patients\" and that \"they have not done so,\" holding instead that \"[w]hile the plaintiffs have offered evidence that mistakes have been made and that conditions and programs could be different or in some cases better, they have failed to prove that the patients at GPW are inadequately supervised; inadequately treated for self-injurious behavior; inadequately protected from environmental hazards; or that adverse incidents are inadequately investigated and/or responded to.\"</p><p>After one of the monitors apparently resigned, there was substantial litigation respecting the appointment of a replacement and the removal of the interim monitor.</p><p>In February 2002, GPW was closed.</p><p>On June 3, 2002, the District Court (Judge Bucklew) granted in part and denied in part the defendants' supplemental motion to terminate the consent decree and to dismiss the case with prejudice.  The Court specifically denied the defendants' motion to terminate paragraphs of the consent decree pertaining to the monitoring of the defendants' community obligations and the Community Compliance Exit Criteria.  A number of defendants filed separate appeals.</p><p>On October 29, 2003, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals (Judge R. Lanier Anderson III) affirmed the District Court's June 3, 2002, refusal to lift all conditions of the consent decree.  Johnson v. Florida, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 22282 (11th Cir. Oct. 29, 2003).  The Court held that the district court did not err by refusing to vacate the consent decree under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5) because the state acknowledged that approximately 90 patients were still in the state's physical custody because they could not be released when the hospital closed. Moreover, it found that the district court's findings in the Justice Department's case that the hospital's conditions met substantive due process standards were not conclusive as to the consent decree, as the issues were not identical. It found that the district court did not err by denying the state attorneys' fees from the Justice Department under 42 U.S.C.S. ยง 1997c(d) because the DOJ case was not frivolous.</p><p>On March 19, 2004, the Magistrate Court (Judge McCoun) entered an order resolving the two remaining exit criteria issues. Over the next few years, the monitors submitted several budget plans for the defendants to follow, and the Court granted all of them. </p><p>On September 30, 2009, the Court held that people moving out of the area were no longer considered part of the class. Consequently, the Court found that two of the defendants sufficiently complied with the consent decree, and granted defendants' motion to exit the consent decree as to those two defendants. The following year, the Court granted defendants' motion to exit for the remaining two defendants, and the consent decree was dissolved. </p><p></p>",

Case No.: 8:87-CV-369-T-24TBM \nMARTIN VAN HOLDEN, et aI., \nDefendants. \n/ \n------------------------~ \nORDER \nThis cause comes before the Court on Defendants' Motion to Terminate Consent Decree \nand Exit Criteria Stipulation (Doc. No. 1327), Plaintiffs' Response in Opposition (Doc. No. \n1364), Defendants' Supplemental Motion to Terminate Consent Decree and Exit Criteria \nStipulation (Doc. No. 1414), and Plaintiffs' Response in Opposition (Doc. No. 1423).  A hearing \nwas held on these motions on May 22, 2002. \nI.  History of the Case \nThis case was originally filed on March 11, 1987 by a class of plaintiffs on behalf of \nmentally ill persons who are or have been patients at G. Pierce Wood Memorial Hospital \n(\"GPW\"), a state psychiatric hospital in Arcadia, Florida.  Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint \non December 14, 1987 and a third amended complaint on December 14, 1988 (Doc. No. 30). \nThe Third Amended Complaint contained five counts.  In Count I, Plaintiffs alleged that the \ndenial of less restrictive treatment and the conditions of their confinement violated their rights \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment.  Count II stated a claim for denial of procedural due process \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1445     Filed 06/03/2002     Page 2 of 16(cid:10)\nresulting from Defendants' allegedly arbitrary revocations of Plaintiffs' grounds privileges, \nwhich allowed Plaintiffs to move freely about the facility.  Count III asserted a claim under the \nFirst, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments for denial of their liberty and association rights \nresulting from the lack of access to telephones and the hospital's policies of prohibiting visitors \nunder twelve and prohibiting \"consensual kissing and hugging between male and female patients \nand visitors.\"  (Doc. No. 30).  In Count N  Plaintiffs asserted a claim under the First, Fifth, Sixth, \nand Fourteenth Amendments for denial of access to courts.  Finally, in Count V Plaintiffs \nasserted a claim for violation of their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment stemming from an \nalleged lack of appropriate programs, services, and trained staff. \nIn 1989, the case was partially settled by a consent decree (Doc. No. 68).  The Court \nretained jurisdiction over the case and appointed monitors to monitor compliance with the \nconsent decree.  In 1993, after further negotiation, the parties entered a stipUlation regarding exit \ncriteria for the consent decree and a stipulation regarding legal access and Plaintiffs moved the \nCourt to approve the stipulations regarding legal access and exit criteria (Doc. No. 403).  In 1994, \nDefendants filed their notices of withdrawal from both stipulations (Doc. Nos. 430, 434, 491). \nHowever, Defendants later filed a motion to withdraw their notices of withdrawal from the \nstipulation regarding legal access and stipUlation regarding exit criteria.  (Doc. No. 443).  The \nCourt granted Defendants' motion to withdraw their notices of withdraw in an order dated July \n12, 1994.(Doc. No. 457.  Defendants also filed a motion to dismiss Count N  ofthe Third \nAmended Complaint, the legal access claim, and to terminate the stipulation on legal access in \nDecember, 1994 (Doc. No. 503).  In an order dated March 23, 1998 (Doc. No. 705), this Court \nadopted Magistrate Judge Thomas McCoun's Report and Recommendation (Doc. No. 681), \n2 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1445     Filed 06/03/2002     Page 3 of 16(cid:10)\ngranted Plaintiffs' motion to approve stipulations regarding exit criteria and legal access (Doc. \nNo. 403), denied Defendants' remaining motion to withdraw from the exit criteria stipulation \n(Doc. No. 491), denied Defendants' motion to dismiss Count N  of the Third Amended \nComplaint (Doc. No. 503), and granted the United States' Motion to Intervene (Doc. No. 637). \nOn April 2, 1998, the United States intervened in this action pursuant to the Civil Rights \nof Institutionalized Persons Act.  In their complaint in intervention, the United States alleged that \nconditions at GPW violated the constitutional rights of current and fonner patients.  The United \nStates also alleged that Defendants violated the Americans With Disabilities Act by failing to \nprovide services and programs to current and fonner GPW patients in the most integrated setting \nappropriate to their needs.  The United States sought prospective injunctive relief on behalf of \nthese current and fonner GPW patients.  After a non-jury trial, the Court directed the Clerk to \nenter judgment in favor of Defendants and against Plaintiffs and Plaintiff-Intervener on all claims \ntried before it.  The Court found that they failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that \nDefendants were violating the statutory and constitutional rights of current and fonner GPW \npatients. Specifically, the Court found that Plaintiffs and Plaintiff -Intervener failed to prove that \nthe patients at GPW were inadequately supervised; inadequately treated for self-injurious \nbehavior; inadequately protected from environmental hazards; or that adverse incidents were \ninadequately investigated and/or responded to.  Additionally, the Court found that Plaintiffs and \nPlaintiff-Intervener failed to prove inadequate assessment of patients; inadequate treatment \nplanning; inadequate provision of active treatment; or inadequate discharge planning.  As to \ncommunity services, the Court found that Plaintiffs and Plaintiff-Intervener failed to prove that \nDefendants were not providing adequate community services to meet the assessed functional and \n3 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1445     Filed 06/03/2002     Page 4 of 16(cid:10)\nclinical needs of current and former GPW patients, nor did Plaintiffs prove that Defendants were \nnot providing such services in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of patients. \nFinally, the Court found that Plaintiffs failed to prove a violation of the ADA.  The Court, \nhowever, did not specifically address Defendants' obligations under the Consent Decree as \nmeasured by the Exit Criteria Stipulation.  The Court made it clear that it was not the purpose of \nthe trial to evaluate Defendants' obligations under the Consent Decree but rather to try the \nconstitutional violations and the ADA violations raised by the United States in its complaint. \nOn February 7,2002, the last patient was transferred out ofGPW and on February 28, \n2002 the hospital formally closed.(affidavit of William Briscoe M.D.) \nII.  Defendants' Motion to Terminate Consent Decree \nand Exit Criteria and Motion to Dismiss \nDefendants seek to terminate the Consent Decree and Exit Criteria and to dismiss the case \nwith prejudice.  (Doc. No. 1327 and 1414).  In their motion to terminate (Doc. No. 1327), \nDefendants assert that the Court should terminate the consent decree and exit criteria and dismiss \nthe case for several reasons.  First, Defendants argue that it is no longer equitable to continue to \nenforce the consent decree as the facts of the case have significantly changed since the parties \nentered into the Consent Decree.  Second, Defendants assert that the Court lacks jurisdiction to \nenforce the Consent Decree in the absence of any ongoing violations of federal law.  Lastly, \nDefendants argue that they are entitled to termination of the Consent Decree under United States \nv. City of Miami, 2 F.3d 1497, 1508 (11  Cir. 1993) because the basic purpose of the decree has \nth \nbeen fully achieved and there is no significant chance of recurring violations once the decree is \nlifted.  In their supplemental motion to terminate (Doc. No. 1414), Defendants reiterate the \n4 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1445     Filed 06/03/2002     Page 5 of 16(cid:10)\narguments in their original motion and further state that the hospital closure now renders moot \nthe legal access claim, the community exit criteria. and all but arguably two paragraphs of the \nconsent decree.  Defendants further assert that those remaining provisions of the consent decree \ndealing with the community are short-term commitments that have been completed,  or are \nexhortatory and unenforceable, or are so closely linked to the hospital that they do not remain \nviable after the hospital closure. \nIn their responses to Defendants' motions, Plaintiffs assert that Defendants erroneously \nrely on the Court's June 28,2001 order in the intervener's case to show compliance with the \nconsent decree and exit criteria stipulation as that issue was not before the Court in the non jury \ntrial.  Plaintiffs also assert that there is no basis to vacate the consent decree and exit criteria \nstipulation because Defendants have failed to demonstrate compliance which satisfies the basic \npurpose of the consent decree.  Plaintiffs agree that the hospital closure renders moot most, but \nnot all, of the provisions of the Consent Decree. Specifically, Plaintiffs agree that the hospital \nclosure renders moot that part of the Consent Decree and Exit Criteria pertaining to both \nDefendants' hospital obligations and to the legal access claim.  However, Plaintiffs argue that \nnone of the Community Exit Criteria are rendered moot by the closure.  Plaintiffs further assert \nthat this Court has jurisdiction to enforce that part of the Consent Decree and Exit Criteria that \nremain viable because Defendants have made no showing that the lingering effects of \ninappropriate hospitalization have been abated. \nIII.  Legal Standard for Termination \nIn the Eleventh Circuit, the standard for terminating consent decrees is set forth in the \ncases of and United States v. City of Miami, 2 F.3d 1497, 1508 (lIth Cir. 1993) and Allen v. \n5 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1445     Filed 06/03/2002     Page 6 of 16(cid:10)\nAlabama State Bd. of Ed., 164 F.3d 1347, 1350 (11th Cir. 1999V  The Court finds these cases \nmore applicable to the issue of termination than Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. \n367 (1992) as that case dealt specifically with modification of a consent decree.  In Rufo, the \nSupreme Court held that when a party seeks relief from a consent decree the court must \ndetermine whether the circumstances are such that continued enforcement of the decree is still \nequitable.  502 U.S. at 383.  The party seeking modification ofthe decree shoulders the burden of \nestablishing a significant change in the law or facts that warrants such revision.  Id.  If the \nmoving party carries its burden, the court must then \"consider whether the proposed modification \nis suitably tailored to the changed circumstances.\" Id. \nDefendants argue that the Eleventh Circuit has applied Rufo's equitable considerations in \nthe context of termination.  The case Defendants cite, however, did not deal with a termination; \nthat case also concerned a motion to modify a consent decree. See Jacksonville Branch NAACP \nv. Duval County Sch. Bd., 978 F.2d 1574, 1582 (11th Cir. 1992).  As such, the Court will \nevaluate Defendants' motion to terminate under the standard set forth in City of Miami and \nAllen. \nIn City of Miami, the city entered into a consent decree which prohibited it from \ndiscriminating against its employees and prospective employees on the basis of race, sex, or \nnational origin.  The union consented to the terms of the decree.  The city then implemented its \nown affirmative action program. 2 F.3d at 1501.  Fifteen years after the consent decree was \nentered, the union filed a motion to vacate or modify, contending that the consent decree had \nThe Court notes that the Allen opinion was later vacated by stipUlation of the parties. \nI \n216 F.3d 1263 (11 th Cir. 2000).  However, the opinion remains persuasive authority as it is a \nclear pronouncement of this Circuit's standard for the termination of consent decrees. \n6 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1445     Filed 06/03/2002     Page 7 of 16(cid:10)\nserved its purpose.  The union contended that the decree \"in its current fonn is no longer directed \nat correcting actual discrimination or the effects of actual discrimination.  Rather, the City has \ninstitutionalized [sic] a quota system that unduly infringes the interest of employees not \nbenefitting from the plan.\" Id. at 1502.  The district court denied the union's motion to vacate or \nmodify the decree, holding that the union \"had not presented 'an evidentiary or legal basis' for \nsuch action.\"  Id. at 1503.  The Eleventh Circuit vacated the district court's order and remanded \nthe case to the district court for review in light of recent Supreme Court decisions articulating \n\"legal principles ...a pplicable to requirements to tenninate or modify consent decrees\" in cases \nconcerning public institutions.  Id. at 1498. \nThe Eleventh Circuit emphasized that the Supreme Court had recently \"articulated more \nflexible standards to be applied to consent decrees which were entered ...t o amicably [redress] \nstatutory and constitutional wrongs committed against individuals by public institutions.\"  Id. at \n1503 (citing Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. 367 (1992ยป.  The Court explained \nthe standard under Rufo for detennining whether a consent decree should be modified. \nHowever, the Eleventh Circuit stated that in detennining whether a consent decree should be \ntenninated, the Supreme Court's decision in Board of Ed. of Oklahoma City Pub. Schs. v. \nDowell, 498 U.S. 237 (1991) was instructive. City of Miarni, 2 F.3d at 1505.  In remanding the \ncase back to the district court, the Court of Appeals stated that ''tennination of the consent decree \nwould be appropriate if the district court finds that the decree is clearly no longer necessary either \nto prevent discrimination in the future or to remedy the effects of past discrimination.\" Id. at \n1508. \nLater the Eleventh Circuit more clearly and succinctly articulated the standard for \n7 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1445     Filed 06/03/2002     Page 8 of 16(cid:10)\ntermination of consent decrees in Allen v. Alabama State Bd. of Ed., 164 F.3d 1347, 1350 (11th \nCir. 1999).  Citing City of Miami and Dowell, the Court stated that a party seeking termination of \na consent decree under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) (5) bears the burden of showing that \n(1) \"the basic purposes of the decree have been fully achieved\" and (2) \"that there is no \nsignificant likelihood of recurring violations of federal law once the decree has been lifted.\" \nAllen, 164 F.3d at 1350. \nIV.  Consent Decree and Exit Criteria Stipulation \nThe Court must first identify the basic purposes of the Consent Decree.  Looking to both \nthe Third Amended Complaint and the Consent Decree, it is clear that Plaintiffs were primarily \nconcerned with two issues: conditions at the hospital and the inappropriate placement of patients \nat GPW rather than in less restrictive facilities in their communities.  The provisions of the \nconsent decree concern either the hospital or community placement. \nAs an initial matter, the parties agree that those provisions of the Consent Decree and Exit \nCriteria Stipulation pertaining to the hospital and legal access have been rendered moot by the \nclosing ofthe hospital.  The Court likewise finds that the hospital closure renders these \nprovisions moot.  Accordingly, Defendants' motion to terminate the Consent Decree and Exit \nCriteria Stipulation is GRANTED to the extent that those provisions concerning the hospital are \nhereby terminated. The closure of the hospital leaves for the Court the determination of whether \nthe remaining community placement provisions, specifically Consent Decree paragraphs 2, 37, \nand 35 as it pertains to the monitoring of compliance with paragraphs 2 and 372 and the \n, \nParagraph 2 sets forth that \n2 \nBeginning February 20, 1989, the defendant will assign clients to living \n8 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1445     Filed 06/03/2002     Page 9 of 16(cid:10)\nCommunity Compliance Exit Criteria,3 should be terminated as well. \nA.  Basic Purpose of the Decree as to Community Placement and Achievement \nIn determining whether the basic purpose of appropriate community placement has been \nachieved, the Court should consider Defendants' \"progress or lack thereof' toward that goal. City \nunits according to their functional levels and specialized program needs \nbased on what is therapeutically appropriate for each client.  As community \nfacilities become available, based on specific additional, legislative \nappropriations, this shall include moving residents from (1) more to less \nstructured living; (2) larger to smaller living facilities; (3) group to individual \nresidence; (4) segregated from the community to integrated into community \nliving; (5) dependent to independent living, according to their needs and as \nmore specifically set forth in the Comprehensive Services Plan for the Alcohol, \nDrug Abuse and Mental Health Program 1989-1993, pages 71-130, attached hereto and \nincorporated herein by reference. \nParagraph 37 states that \nPatients shall be identified as \"discharge ready\"  based upon determination \nby the treatment team which will include participation of the client and his \ncase manager.  Subject to availability by specific additional legislative \nappropriations, community placement will be made consistent with the \navailability of services in the GPW catchment area and consistent with need \nas identified in the Comprehensive Services Plan for Alcohol, Drug Abuse \nand Mental Health Program, pages 71-130, attached hereto. \n3 The language in the Exit Criteria Stipulation makes clear that it serves as the method for \nmeasuring Defendants' compliance with hospital based obligations, while the Community \nCompliance Exit Criteria is the sole and exclusive method for determining Defendants' \nperformance and completion of community obligations. (Stipulation Regarding Exit Criteria at 2, \n7). Plaintiffs do not explicitly concede that the only viable remnant of the Exit Criteria \nStipulation is the Community Compliance Exit Criteria, attached as Exhibit 1, but they agree \nwith Defendants as to the mootness of those provisions of the Consent Decree concerning the \nhospital and legal access claim.  The language of the Consent Decree, coupled with Plaintiffs' \narguments concerning the viability of the community obligations, leads to the conclusion that if \nthe only provisions of the Consent Decree remaining are those concerning Defendants' \ncommunity obligations, then the only provisions ofthe Exit Criteria that survive are those which \nmeasure Defendants' performance of these community obligations - the Community Compliance \nExit Criteria. \n9 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1445     Filed 06/03/2002     Page 10 of 16(cid:10)\nof Miami, 2 F.3d at 1508.  Also of importance is Defendants' good faith compliance with the \ndecree. Id.  Defendants argue that the basic purpose of the decree has been fulfilled as evidenced \nby the Court's factual findings in its June 28,2001 Order on the non-jury intervention trial. \nFurthermore, Defendants argue that there has been no \"reliable record evidence\" that Defendants \nhave failed to comply with the decree. \nIn its June 28, 2001 Order, the Court did not make specific findings as to Defendants' \ncompliance with the provisions of the Consent Decree.  In fact, the Court made it clear that it was \nnot the purpose of the trial to evaluate Defendants' obligations under the Consent Decree. \nNevertheless, as Defendants emphasize, the Court did make findings that Defendants were \ncomplying with their community obligations.  As to Defendants' community obligations, the \nCourt made the following fmdings: \n\" Upon discharge from GPW, patients are provided several community placement \noptions, (such as family homes, private apartments, assisted living facilities, etc.), \naccording to their needs and abilities.\"  (Doc. No. 1319 at 18) \n\"The defendants in this matter are placing persons with mental disabilities in community \nsettings rather than in institutions when the relevant treatment professionals have \ndetermined that community placement is appropriate\"  Id. \n\"Further, the community settings in which patients are placed are integrated and less \nrestrictive than a hospital or institutional setting.\" Id. at 19. \n\"The defendants are providing an appropriate array and intensity of community services.\" \nId. at 20. \n\" ... all aspects of the defendants' provision of community services comply with accepted \nprofessional standards of care.\" Id. at 23. \n10 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1445     Filed 06/03/2002     Page 11 of 16(cid:10)\nBased on these factual findings, it appears that at the time of trial Defendants had fulfilled the \nbasic purposes of the consent decree as it applies to the community obligations.  Specifically, \nthese findings indicate a good faith compliance with the provisions of the consent decree and \nprogress toward the goal of discharging those patients identified as 'discharge ready' into \nappropriate community facilities.  Nevertheless, patients continued to be discharged from GPW \nand placed in the community after the conclusion of the trial in September of2000 until the last \npatient was discharged in February of2002.  Although the first prong of the standard for \ntermination appears to have been met, the Court still must consider whether Defendants have \nshown that they have met the second prong: whether there is a significant likelihood of recurring \nviolations once the decree is lifted. \nB.  Likelihood of Recurring Violations \nUnder the second prong of the standard for termination, Defendants must demonstrate \nthat there is no significant likelihood of recurring violations once the decree is lifted.  Allen, 164 \nF.3d at 1350.  Defendants assert that \"the Court's detailed findings demonstrate that there is little \nlikelihood of slippage in care and conditions.\"  (Doc. No. 1327 at 21).  Defendants further argue \nthat they \"have no federal law obligations to provide any level of care or safety in the community \n- people are not in the defendants' physical custody there.\" Id.  Defendants cite D.W. v. Rogers, \n113 F.3d 1214 (11th Cir. 1997), in support of their argument that they had no obligation to \nprovide the discharged residents with treatment or to ensure that these individuals received care \nor safety once discharged.  D.W., however, did not involve parties who freely entered into a \nconsent decree, binding themselves to obligations to which they voluntarily agreed. \nWhile the Court's factual findings in it June 28, 2001 Order do indicate that the basic \n11 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1445     Filed 06/03/2002     Page 12 of 16(cid:10)\npurposes of the Consent Decree have been achieved, these findings do not indicate that there is \nno significant likelihood of recurring violations in light of the fact that a great number of patients \nwere discharged after the Court made its findings.  In order for the Court to find no such \nlikelihood exists, it is necessary that the Court evaluate Defendants' performance under the \nCommunity Compliance Exit Criteria, which the parties stipulated as the method of measuring \nDefendants' compliance with its community obligations to ensure that those individuals \ndischarged after the Court made its findings in its June 28,2001 Order were similarly placed in \nappropriate community settings.  Because there is no evidence before the Court that these \nindividuals were discharged into community facilities in compliance with the Community \nCompliance Exit Criteria, the Court cannot find that there is no significant likelihood of recurring \nviolations of federal law once the decree has been lifted. \nAccordingly, it is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that Defendants' Motion to Terminate \nthe Consent Decree and Exit Criteria and Supplemental Motion to Terminate the Consent Decree \nand Exit Criteria (Doc. Nos. 1327 and 1414) are GRANTED IN PART, DENIED IN PART: to \nthe extent the motions seek to terminate Consent Decree paragraphs 2,37, and 35 as it pertains to \nthe monitoring of Defendants' community obligations, and the Community Compliance Exit \nCriteria, the motions are DENIED; otherwise, the motions are GRANTED. \n~ \nDONE AND ORDERED at Tampa, Florida this  day of June, 2002. \nQ~  Elk~ \nC-. \nS  AN C.

Case No. 8:87-cv-369-T-24TBM \nGERALD REGIER, \nDefendant. \n________________________ \n~I \nORDER \nTHIS CAUSE is before the court on the Office of the Monitor's Request for Ruling \non Two Remaining Exit Criteria Issues (Doc. 1539), Plaintiffs' memorandum (Doc. 1544), \nand Defendant's brief (Doc. 1545).  A hearing on the matter was conducted March 18,2004.1 \nAs more fully addressed in the pleadings and at the hearing, the parties and the Office \nof the Monitor request the court to resolve their dispute over the continued efficacy of \ncriterion #1 to the Community Compliance Exit Criteria (hereinafter \"Exit Criteria\") in effect \nin this case.  Additionally, they ask the court to define the scope of footnote 1 to criterion #6 \ninsofar as it defines the term \"areas of need.,,2 \nIThis court also heard argument on the matter at a hearing on June 10,2003. \n2In or about February 1993, the parties, with the approval of the Office of Monitor, \nentered a Stipulation Regarding Exit Criteria (hereinafter \"Stipulation\") intended to provide \nthe exclusive method of measuring the State's performance under the consent decree.  The \nStipulation included agreed upon standards by which to measure the State's compliance with \nits G. Pierce Wood Memorial Hospital (hereinafter \"GPW\")-based obligations and its \ncommunity-based obligations under the consent decree and for the termination of the decree. \nIn essence, the State here challenges the manner in which the Office of the Monitor has \nmeasured its compliance under criterion #1 because it believes that the criterion is obsolete. \nIt also disputes how the Office of the Monitor interprets a footnote to the Exit Criteria. \n155/ \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1551     Filed 03/19/2004     Page 2 of 4(cid:10)\nCriterion #1 provides: \nThe class member was placed in the community in a less restrictive setting \nthan GPW regardless of whether or not intermittent hospitalization is required. \nIs the class member placed in a setting less restrictive than \nGPW whether or not intermittent hospitalization is required? \nAre the services for this person among the less restrictive \nalternatives and practices which, based upon professional \njudgment, will assist the person living in the community? If \nnot, did the person choose to refuse a reasonable offer of a less \nrestrictive alternative? \nIs the person's home safe and clean? \nSee (Doc. 1544, Exh.l at 1).  Exit criterion #6 states, \"The class member receives the level \nand intensity of services, described in the SIP goals, to meet the class members' needs, \nwhether or not intermittent hospitalization is required ....\"   The footnote to this criterion \nstates in pertinent part: \nIn the context of the community compliance criteria, the \"areas of need\" are \ndefined as case management, independent living skills, vocational/educational, \nsocial activities, mental health therapy and medication, physical health and \nnutrition. \nThe parties and the Office of the Monitor agree that regardless of the source of \nthese needs (i.e., maintaining the person in the community and remedying \nlingering effects of inappropriate hospitalization), the exit criteria are based \nexclusively upon identifying and meeting current needs in the categories \nreferred to above .... \nId. at 2, 4. \nRegarding criterion #1, while it appears to speak both to the present and to the past, \nwhen the criterion is read in the context of the entire Stipulation it is apparent that it was \nResolution of the dispute appears necessary to guide the State in its testing protocol, which \nthe court has allowed to be substituted in lieu of the compliance reviews formerly performed \nby the Office of the Monitor. \n2 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1551     Filed 03/19/2004     Page 3 of 4(cid:10)\nintended to inquire of the current circumstances of the members of the class in measuring the \nState's compliance with the consent decree.  Thus, in negotiating the Exit Criteria under the \nStipulation, the parties agreed to seven areas appropriate for measuring the State's compliance \nwith its agreed upon community-based obligations.  See Exh. C to the Stipulation.  The first \nof these areas was whether \"[t]he class member was placed in the community in a less \nrestrictive setting than GPW regardless of whether or not intermittent hospitalization was \nrequired.\"  The actual inquiry required for measuring the State's compliance in this area was \nset forth in the Exit Criteria found at Exhibit 1 to the exit criteria for the State's hospital \nbased obligations under the consent decree.  See Exh. A to the Stipulation.  Upon a plain \nreading of the agreed upon inquiries, each looked to the present circumstances of the class \nmember. \nFrom arguments, including the comments of the monitor, it is apparent that the \nquestion of whether a class member was or is placed in a setting less restrictive than GPW \nupon hislher discharge is a question no longer necessary to be asked in measuring the State's \ncompliance given the current circumstances.  The actual dispute is over whether the State, in \nits compliance testing, must include the last two inquiries set forth in this criterion (or their \nequivalent).  I conclude that they must.  As noted above, by their very terms these inquiries \nquestion the current circumstances of the class member.  By the Stipulation, the Exit Criteria \nare the sole and exclusive method for measuring the State's performance and satisfaction of \nits community-based obligations under the consent decree.  Although I have permitted the \nState to substitute its testing protocol for the monitor's compliance reviews, the Exit Criteria \nhave not changed and the State's instrument must adequately address each of the inquiries \n3 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1551     Filed 03/19/2004     Page 4 of 4(cid:10)\nagreed to by the parties in the Stipulation.  These inquiries, speaking as they do to the present \ncircumstances of the class members, remain viable and must be measured for compliance \n3 \nwhether by the State or the monitor.\nIn regard to footnote 1 to criterion #6, the parties dispute whether the definition of \n\"areas of need\" set forth therein applies to all of the Exit Criteria or only to criterion #6.  By \nmy reading, the footnote has broad application.  While it clearly is appended to criterion #6, a \nplain reading of the footnote indicates that it is intended to apply to the entirety of the Exit \nCriteria.  Thus, to the extent that any of the Exit Criteria require measurement of compliance \nwith the \"needs\" of the class members, it must measure the compliance in each of the areas \n4 \nset forth by the footnote.\nDone and Ordered in Tampa, Florida, this 19th day of March 2004. \n~/4~~ \nTHOMAS B. McCOUN III \nUNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE \nCopies furnished to: \nThe Honorable Susan C. Bucklew \nCounsel of Record \n3Interestingly, it appears from the hearing that the Monitor and the State's own expert \nagree on this.  The Office of the Monitor has always assumed that this criteria looked to the \ncurrent circumstances of the class member as well as to whether the class member was \ndischarged from GPW to a less restrictive setting, and the State's new testing device \ncontinues to inquire of the current circumstances of the class members consistent with the \ninquiry of the last two interrogatories of this criterion.  While the lawyers may disagree, the \nexperts appear not to. \n4From arguments, this will only impact the State's testing protocol for criterion #5, \nwhich will have to be modified. \n4 ",

Pierce Wood Memorial Hospital\nDear Governor Chiles:\nOn May 17, 1995, we notified you, pursuant to the Civil\nRights of Institutionalized Persons Act  (\"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C.\nยง 19 97, of our intent to investigate conditions at G. Pierce Wood\nMemorial Hospital  (\"G.  Pierce Wood\") in Arcadia, Florida.  The\npurpose of this letter is to advise you of the constitutional and\nstatutory violations ascertained during this investigation, the\nsupporting facts, and recommended minimum remedial measures.\nBy way of background, after notifying you of our intent to\ninvestigate G. Pierce Wood, we sent counsel for the State a\nletter dated May 31, 1995 to advise the State of our desire to\nconduct an on-site inspection of the facility to assess and\nevaluate current conditions.  We also requested that the State\nprovide the Department with certain documents and information\nprior to the on-site inspection.  Such inspections and requests\nfor documents are a routine part of our CRIPA investigations.\nIn late July, the State provided us with \"public records,\"\nonly after the Department agreed to pay for copying and labor\ncosts.  When we inquired about the other information we had\nrequested, counsel advised the Department that the State would\nneither provide further information nor grant access to the\nfacility by our attorneys and expert consultants retained by the\nUnited States to assist in the conduct of this investigation\nuntil the Department provided the State with more specific\ninformation regarding the allegations it had received concerning\nG. Pierce Wood.  Counsel also indicated that the State intended\nto depose a representative of the Department pursuant to Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 30(b)(6) to ascertain whether the Department had any\n\n- 2 -\nevidence of possible violations of the Johnson v. Bradley consent\ndecree.\nIn an effort to resolve this matter amicably, the Department\noffered to meet with Florida Assistant Attorney General Jason\nVail.  On September 15, 1995, Mr. Vail met with Deputy Assistant\nAttorney General Loretta King, and other members of my staff} who\ndiscussed the nature and purpose of our investigation.  We gยทlso\ndiscussed the nature of the allegations we have received about\nunlawful conditions at G. Pierce Wood and provided the State with\na six page list of the allegations along with numerous newspaper\nreports and the August 1994 Health Care Financing Administration\nsurvey of the facility.  Mr. Vail advised us that he lacked the\nauthority to grant the Department access to the facility or to\nprovide any additional documents.  At our request, on September\n19, 1995, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Loretta King and\nother members of my staff further discussed this matter in a\ntelephone conference call with your General Counsel, W. Dexter\nDouglass, HRS General Counsel Kimberly Tucker, and Assistant\nAttorney General Vail.  The State continued to deny the\nDepartment access to the facility and to additional documents and\nsuggested that the Department's concerns should be addressed in\nthe context of on-going litigation in Johnson v. Bradley, a\nprivate class action lawsuit involving G. Pierce Wood.  On\nSeptember 27, 1995, Mr. Vail advised us by letter that the State\ncontinued to deny the Department access to the facility and\nadditional documents, and directed us, instead, to the Johnยกson v.\nBradley lawsuit.\nOver the last five months, we have endeavored to work\ncooperatively with the State and regret that the State has\ninsisted that this matter be resolved only through litigation\nrather than through the non-adversarial method we have proposed\nrepeatedly.  Notwithstanding lack of access, we have gathered\nnumerous facts from public documents provided by the State,\nincluding the August 1995 Inspector General's Report  (hereinafter\n\"IG report\") on G. Pierce Wood, the September 5, 1995 G. Pierce\nWood Memorial Hospital Review Team Report to the Florida\nSecretary of Health and Rehabilitative Services  (hereinafter\n\"Review Team Report\") and information obtained from former\npatients and staff, advocates, concerned citizens, and newspaper\narticles which indicate that conditions at the facility deprive\nG. Pierce Wood patients of their constitutional rights and\nviolate the Americans with Disabilities Act  (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. ยงยง\n12101 e_t seq. and regulations promulgated pursuant to the ADA.\nPatients of state operated psychiatric facilities have a\nfundamental Fourteenth Amendment due process right to reasonable\nsafety and adequate medical care, including psychiatric services.\nYoungberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307  (1982).  Patients have a right\nto adequate psychiatric treatment which includes treatment\nprograms designed to protect their liberty interests.  Such\n\n- 3 -\ntreatment programs must be sufficient to permit each patient an\nopportunity to improve or be cured and to function as\nindependently as their psychiatric conditions permit.  See, fe .g. ,\nWyatt v. Sticknev, 325 F.Supp. 781, 784  (M.D. Ala. 1971).  Such\nprograms must provide opportunities for patients to acquire ยฃnd\nmaintain skills that will enable them to cope more effectively\nwith the demands of their own person, their environment, and to\nraise- fe-he level of their mental, behavioral, physical, and social\nefficiency.  Gary W. v. Louisiana, 437 F. Supp. 1209, 1219 (E:.D.\nLa.  197 6);  see also, Thomas S. by Brooks v. Flaherty, 699 F.S.\n1178  (W.D. N.C. 1988), aff'd. 902 F.2d 250  (4th Cir. 1990), pert.\ndenied, Flaherty v. Thomas S. by Brooks, 498 U.S. 951  (1990):.\nMoreover, a state cannot constitutionally confine, without more,\na nondangerous individual who is capable of surviving safely: in\nthe community either independently or with assistance.  0'Connor\nv. Donaldson, 422 U.S. 563, 576  (1975).  Federal statutes and\nregulations also create rights and place obligations on statยกe\ninstitutions.\nThe numerous constitutional and statutory deficiencies which\nwere previously summarized during our September 15, 1995 meeting\nwith counsel for the State include the following:\nI.  G. Pierce Wood Has Failed to Protect Patients From Hanrt.\nBased upon information we have received, we conclude that\nthe lack of adequate staff supervision places patients at G.\nPierce Wood at risk of significant harm and even death_..  In\nparticular, our sources report and the IG report confirms that\nstaff fail to properly supervise suicidal and self-injuriou$\npatients, patients likely to elope, and patients at risk of\nchoking at mealtimes.\nA.  Failure to Provide Adequate Special Precautions Fยข>r\nPatients in Need of Supervision\nThe IG report and other information in the public domain\nreveals numerous instances in which G. Pierce Wood staff fail to\nadequately monitor patients requiring close supervision,\nincluding those patients who have a physician's order for one-to-\none supervision.  For example, in August 1994 a twenty-five: year\nold female patient died while on one-to-one staffing.  A\nphysician had ordered one-to-one supervision because this patient\nhad recently attempted suicide.  According to hospital policy, an\nassigned staff person may not leave the patient unsupervised\nuntil replaced by another employee.  The staff person is also\nresponsible for documenting the patient's location and activities\nevery 15 minutes.  On the night of this patient's death, however,\nthe assigned staff person left at the 11:00 p.m. shift change\nbefore the oncoming staff person arrived.  The staff person:\nassigned to monitor the patient on the 11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a:.m.\nshift never took over the one-to-one watch.  In addition,\n\n_ 4 -\ndocumentation on the precautions checklist revealed that the\npatient was not checked every fifteen minutes and \"face checkยฆs\"\nrequired at the beginning of each shift were not completed on! a\ntimely basis.  According to the IG report, the combination of! the\nfailure to complete fifteen minute checks, failure to conduct!\nface checks in a timely fashion, and the failure of the staff! to\ntake responsibility for one-to-one supervision resulted in thยฆe\npatient's demise.  When the patient was found, rigor mortis had\nalready begun to set in.\nIn another incident, the IG report concluded that there was\ninadequate care and supervision of a patient who attempted\nsuicide while on eye-to-eye contact precaution.  Hospital polยฆicy\nrequires a staff person assigned eye-to-eye contact to constajntly\nbe in a situation to observe or see the resident at all times!.\nInadequate supervision contributed to the near death of this\npatient because the staff person directly responsible for\nsupervision did not maintain uninterrupted eye-to-eye contact! at\nall times.  As a result, the patient was able to smuggle a shleet\ninto the bathroom, lock the bathroom stall door, and attempt ยฆto\nhang himself.  Another patient on eye-to-eye precautions for\nsuicidal behavior disappeared from the facility for more than\nnineteen hours before he was discovered walking nude along thยฆe\nhighway.\nThe IG report also found thatยฏ*G. Pierce Wood staff failejd to\nadequately perform their special precautions responsibilities'\nwhich, in turn, enabled a patient to self-mutilate in eight\nincidents in 1994 .  Those eight incidents included self-\nmutilation by a plastic comb and knife, glass from a framed\npicture, a coke can, and a razor blade.  In all, the patient was\ninvolved in 43 reported self-injurious incidents that year with\nthe majority of the incidents occurring while the patient wasยฆ on\nspecial precautions supervision.  Nineteen incidents occurred\nwhile on one-to-one suicidal precautions, 10 occurred while รค>n\ntwo-to-one suicidal precautions, and one while on 15 minute\nprecautions.\nAnother patient was found dead, slumped in a geri-tray ยขhair\nwith her throat and chin on the chair's table top.  Despite\nhospital policy classifying a geri-tray as a mechanical restraint\nnecessitating one-to-one supervision, no staff person was\nassigned to monitor the patient on a one-to-one basis and thยข\npatient was unsupervised at the time of death.\nThe Review Team Report also concluded that one-to-one\nassignments are problematic due to staffing shortages and thยฃ\nstaff's lack of training and understanding of their roles ancfl.\naccountability.  In sum, G. Pierce Wood's failure to ensure that\nstaff monitor patients who need close supervision and that staff\nproperly observe and document the patient's condition places\n\n- 5 -\npatients at significant risk of serious injury and death and\nviolates their constitutional rights.\nB.  Failure to Take Adequate Steps to Prevent Elopements\nOur sources indicate that a significant number of patients\nhave eloped from G. Pierce Wood in recent years.  Some of these\npatients were later discovered dead.  For example, in 1993, a\nmale patient who suffered from delusions, amnesia, and physical\nhandicaps eloped from the Hospital and was found dead a month\nlater.  His body was discovered leaning against a tree about a\nmile from Hospital grounds.  The cause of death could not be!\nestablished.  Despite the patient's history of eloping, he wยฆas\nsuddenly removed from elopement precautions and granted full!\nprivileges only three days prior to his disappearance.  The ;IG\nreport reviewed this incident and concluded that G. Pierce Wood's\npolicies on how to respond to an elopement are deficient.\nAnother male patient eloped from G. Pierce Wood severalยฆ\ntimes before finally eloping and committing suicide in an orยฆange\ngrove near the facility.  A female patient eloped from the\nfacility and was later struck and killed by a car on the\nPennsylvania Turnpike.  A third patient, who was committed tjo G.\nPierce Wood after having been found not guilty of murder by\nreason of insanity, escaped soon after she was sent to facility.\nShe was later found in another state.\nThese incidents indicate that G. Pierce Wood fails to take\nadequate measures to prevent patients in need of supervision from\neloping.  As a result, a number of patients who pose a dangยขr to\nthemselves and others have eloped over the years, several oยฃ whom\nwere later found dead.\nC.  Failure to Monitor and Supervise Patients with Diโกtary\nRestrictions\nOur sources report and the IG report confirms that G. Pierce\nWood also fails to adequately monitor and supervise patients with\ndietary restrictions.  In the last year, at least two patients\nwho were restricted to a soft food diet choked to death at\nmealtime.  The IG report concluded that the direct care staff's\nfailure to provide adequate supervision and care contributed to\nthe choking death of a patient during a noon meal as recently as\nJuly 1995.\nThe report based its findings on several facts.  First!, the\npatient neither received his physician ordered mechanical soft\ndiet tray nor was he offered any other food during the noonl meal.\nRecords also indicated that the patient may not have eaten since\nthe prior evening's meal, some nineteen hours earlier.  Staff did\nnot follow appropriate facility procedures to ensure that the\npatient received his proper meals.  Second, the staff person\n\n- 6 -\nresponsible for supervising the patient was not aware of thijs\nassignment until after the patient's death.  Staff responsible\nfor supervising patients were not present at all times, therjeby\nallowing the patient to leave undetected and potentially obtain\nfood elsewhere.  Apparently, the patient had a history of\nwandering off to pick up food off the ground or take food from\nother patients.\nThis recent serious incident followed a similar incident in\nAugust 1994 when another patient on a pureed diet swallowed and\nchoked on a piece of meat which was lodged in his airway.  T!he IG\nreport found that the staff person assigned to observe the\npatient for signs of choking on the day of his death was unaware\nof this responsibility.  The report also found that G. Pierde\nWood fails to ensure that patients with dietary restrictions\nreceive the correct meals.  For example, when this patient was\ninadvertently placed on a regular diet, the error went unnoticed\nby the treatment team for a period of nineteen days until it was\ndiscovered by a psychiatrist.  The IG report found that stafff do\nnot check pureed meals to ensure that they meet the consistency\nordered by doctors.  In fact, the inspectors found that purged\nmeals contain discernible meat fragments, pieces of tomatoes, and\nrice.\nAccording to the Review Team ^Report, the hospital\nadministration ordered residents on mechanical soft and pureed\ndiets to eat their meals in their residences in July 1995.  When\nthe review team recently toured G. Pierce Wood and observed\nresidents with dietary restrictions eating in their residences,\nthe team found patients eating standing up at the nursing station\nand sitting on couches with their trays on their laps.  Due to\novercrowding in day rooms and quiet rooms, staff were unable to\nproperly observe patients' eating behaviors and monitor residents\non choking precautions.  Moreover, the Review Team found that\nstaff did not know how to intervene properly when patients\nexhibited unsafe eating behaviors.  The Review Team Report\nconcluded that meals in the residences fail to provide an\nappropriate atmosphere for a therapeutic dining experience.\nIn sum, G. Pierce Wood's has failed to ensure that patients\nreceive their correct meals in a timely manner, that staff follow\nphysician ordered dietary restrictions and provide necessary\nsupervision during mealtimes, and that staff complete the\nappropriate documentation.  These deficiencies pose life-\nthreatening risks and violate the patients' constitutional\nrights.\nD.  Failure to Take Adequate Steps to Prevent Patient|\nInjuries\nReliable sources report that G. Pierce Wood fails to tqake\nadequate steps to keep patients from injuring each other.\n\n- 7 -\nPatients continually commit acts of violence against each other.\nPatients have been raped and beaten by other patients.  In\naddition, patients who are unable to protect themselves are\nplaced in quarters with other patients whose propensity towards\nviolence places them in danger.  Moreover, patients who are HIV\npositive reportedly regularly engage in sexual activity with\nother patients.  A number of other injuries at the facility\napparently occur for unknown reasons because staff are not\nmonitoring patients.\nThere appear to be a number of systemic problems at G.\nPierce Wood that underscore the facility's failure to protect\npatients from harm.  There are problems with adequate deployment\nand supervision of staff on the units, staff failing to perform\nrequired duties or sleeping on the job, staff lacking knowledge\nof facility policies and protocols, and staff failing to\ncommunicate important information about patients' conditions:at\nshift changes.  In addition, there have been delays in\ninvestigations of significant incidents, retaliation and alleged\ndisincentives for reporting staff abuse and neglect, and\nfalsification of records.  All of these serious deficiencies\ncontribute to G. Pierce Woods's failure to ensure that patients\nare protected from harm, in violation of their constitutional\nrights.\nII.  G. Pierce Wood Has Failed to Provide Adequate Treatment\nk\nOur sources report that patients at G. Pierce Wood, are hot\nreceiving adequate treatment.  According to the Review Team\nReport, staff fail to develop treatment plans in accordance with\nthe results of functional and clinical assessments.  Treatment\nplans fail to integrate and track the progress of behavioral\nintervention programs.  Some interventions are not being\nimplemented.  Treatment plans also fail to track medical issues\nnoted in patient records.\nTreatment teams fail to .develop and implement appropriate\ntreatment plans and to review and revise them when necessary:,\nparticularly when there is a change in a patient's status.  As a\nresult, treatment teams are unable to adequately respond wheโกi a\npatient's condition deteriorates.  For example, the IG report\nfound that despite the fact that a patient exhibited suicidal\nideations just days before he killed himself, the patient\nremained in an unstructured program with full privileges.\nAnother patient frustrated by delays in release from the hospital\ncut off both his hands with a circular saw.  The Review Team!\nconfirmed problems with treatment plan review and revision. `` For\nexample, the Review Team Report documents instances in which!\nstaff failed to revise the treatment plan or develop new\ninterventions despite the identification of significant probยฆlems\nsuch as suicidal and homicidal statements and aggression.\n\n- 8 -\nWe have also received reports that patients are not properly-\ndiagnosed and treatment plans do not adequately address dange!rous\nbehaviors in which they engage.  For example, some female\npatients regularly sell sex to other patients to obtain money for\ncigarettes.  Although staff is aware of this conduct, patients\nare not counselled on their behavior.  As noted earlier, the\nfacility fails to provide adequate suicide precautions and toยก\nrespond to situations where patients are in danger of hurting\nthemselves or others.\nG. Pierce Wood also fails to provide adequate and\nappropriate activities/training programs to teach patients skills\nthat enable them to function as independently as their\npsychiatric conditions permit.  Many of the patients sit idly in\nday rooms or pace the halls and do not regularly attend\nprogramming.  There are an insufficient number and array of\ntherapeutic activities to meet patients' rehabilitative needs.\nWe have also received information that patient records Lack\nvital information that is essential for proper patient care.\nTreating psychiatrists fail to routinely record progress notes in\nthe medical record in a timely manner.  Medical records also lack\ndocumentation in such key areas as changes in medication,\nresponses to psychiatric treatments, and changes in psychiatric\ntreatment plans.  Direct care staff^,.fail to recognize and\ndocument important behavior differences such as mood swings.\nAlso, treatment plans lack measurable short- and long-term goals\nfor patients.  Treatment goals are set for the convenience of\nstaff rather than to meet patient needs.  Proper documentation is\nimportant to ensure consistency of treatment and to track a\npatient's progress toward cure and eventual discharge.\nReliable sources also indicate that mechanical and chemical\nrestraints are used inappropriately and without necessary\nprecautions and supervision.  For some patients, drugs are thยกe\nonly therapy they receive.  There is not enough effort to provide\nalternative or supplementary therapeutic treatment.\nIn sum, treatment at G. Pierce Wood fails to comport with\ngenerally accepted professional standards.  The absence of such\ntreatment directly threatens the health and safety of patients,\nimpairs their potential to improve or be cured, and violates\ntheir constitutional rights.\nIII. G. Pierce Wood Has Failed to Follow Accepted Medical Caiรญe\nand Medication Practices.\nOur sources report and the IG report confirms that G. Pierce\nWood's fails to provide its patients with adequate medical care\nplacing them at significant risk of life-threatening illness and\ndeath.  For example, in July 1994, a patient died from an\nundiagnosed hernial condition.  The Inspector General's medical\n\n- 9 -\nconsultant opined that an adequate physical examination the night\nbefore or the morning the patient died may have detected the\nhernial condition which caused his death.\nThe lack of adequate care at G. Pierce Wood is particularly\nevident in emergency situations.  The IG report cited several\nmedical emergencies in which the staff failed to utilize\nappropriate life saving techniques.  When staff tried to revive\nthe patient suffering from an undiagnosed hernial condition,\ncomplete life saving techniques were not utilized by the Codei\nBlue response team in that an intravenous infusion  (IV) was njot\nstarted.  In another emergency, the Code Blue response team was\ncalled twice and it did not arrive until five minutes after the\ninitial call.  When a patient was found choking to death in\nAugust 1994, staff did not commence basic life saving techniqjues\nuntil after the patient had been removed from the dining room.\nThe paramedic who treated the patient who choked to death in July\n1995 told IG inspectors that the physicians and the Code Blue\nresponse team at G. Pierce Wood need to be trained and certified\nin Advanced Cardiac Life Support and practice these skills on a\nregular basis to improve their proficiency in dealing with these\ntypes of emergencies.\nWe have also received reports that G. Pierce Wood fails .to\nfollow accepted medication practices.  Staff fail to coordinate\nthe use of multiple psychotropic medications administered to\npatients.  In the weeks before her death in August 1994, a\npatient was taking a combination of powerful psychotropic\nmedications.  The medical examiner was unable to rule out\nincreased dosages as a contributing factor to her death.  The\nsame patient was given the wrong drug by mistake a few weeks\nbefore her death.  We have received complaints from other sources\nabout medication errors.  In addition, staff are not adequately\ntrained to detect and recognize drug side effects.  Until\nrecently, unlicensed staff were permitted to administer\nmedication to patients.\nThe failure to provide adequate medical care, particularly\nin emergency situations, and to follow accepted medication\npractices places G. Pierce Wood patients at significant risk1of\nharm and violates their constitutional rights.\nIV.  G. Pierce Wood Has Failed to Provide Adequate Staffing.\nWe have received information that G. Pierce Wood lacks\nadequate number of psychiatrists, physicians, and nurses.\nAccording to the Review Team Report, only two of the six\nauthorized positions for general health care physicians in the\nmedical unit are currently filled.  In addition, the deployment\nof direct care staff is not adequate to meet the needs of the\npatients.  Without sufficient staff, the facility is unable to\n\n- 10 -\nprovide patients with constitutionally required treatment, care\nand supervision.\nV.  G. Pierce Wood Has Failed to Provide Treatment in the Most\nIntegrated Setting Appropriate to Patients' Needs.\nOur sources report that a number of patients at G. Pierce\nWood have been evaluated by facility professionals and determined\nto be ready for discharge to the community.  These patients\nremain institutionalized because of an inadequate number of\nplacements available in the community.  As a result, discharge\nready patients continue to be segregated from the rest of\nsociety.  In other situations, patients have been discharged\nwithout appropriate discharge plans and have not received\nadequate aftercare services.  The State's failure to implement\nprofessional judgments about the appropriate setting in which to\nserve patients and to provide adequate treatment in the most\nintegrated setting appropriate to patients' needs violates the\npatients' constitutional rights and their rights under the ADA.\nMINIMUM REMEDIAL MEASURES\nThe following remedial measures need to be implemented in\norder to meet constitutional and statutory requirements:\nI.  Protection from Harm  ^*\nG. Pierce Wood must identify patients who require one-to-one\nor close supervision and ensure that such supervision is\nprovided.  Patients who have dietary restrictions must receive\nappropriate meals in a timely manner and adequate supervision to\nensure that they receive such meals.  G. Pierce Wood must tajce\nadequate steps to identify, assess, and prevent patients who pose\na danger to themselves and others from eloping and to respond\nappropriately when elopements occur.  The facility must also: take\nadequate steps to protect patients from being victimized by other\npatients.\nII.  Treatment\nG. Pierce Wood must evaluate, diagnose, and treat patients\nconsistent with generally accepted professional standards.\nPatient treatment plans must be appropriate, coordinated, and\nproperly managed.  Such programs must allow each patient a\nreasonable opportunity to be cured, function as independently as\npossible, and cope as effectively as possible with his or he:r\nneeds.  Mechanical and chemical restraints may only be used 'in\naccordance with accepted professional standards.  Patient records\nmust contain essential information and properly document the!\npatient's course of care.\n\n- 11 -\nIII. Medical Care and Medication Practices\nG. Pierce Wood must provide adequate medical care,\nparticularly in emergency situations.  Staff must be properly\ntrained and qualified to respond to medical emergencies.  All use\nof drugs must be professionally justified, carefully monitored,\ndocumented, and reviewed.\nIV.  Staffing\nG. Pierce Wood must retain and deploy adequate numbers of\nqualified professional and direct care staff to develop and\nimplement treatment programs, to care for patients, and to\nprovide appropriate supervision and adequate medical care.\nV.  Discharge Planning\nG. Pierce Wood must appropriately assess each patient to\ndetermine which patients are appropriate for discharge.  The\nfacility must develop and implement adequate discharge planning,\nincluding appropriate community-based mental health services, to\nmeet the needs of the patient upon discharge.  In addition, the\nState must develop adequate quality assurance mechanisms to\nensure the appropriateness of post-discharge services.\nPursuant to CRIPA, the Attorneยฏรฝ General may move to\nintervene in a pending lawsuit to correct deficiencies at an\ninstitution fifteen days after appropriate officials are notified\nof them or may initiate an independent action after forty-nine\ndays.  See 42 U.S.C. ยง 1997c(b)(l), l997b(a)(l).  Therefore, we\nanticipate hearing from you within fifteen days upon receipt of\nthis letter with any response you may have to our findings.  If\nyou do not respond within the stated time period, we will\nconsider intervening in the pending action Johnson v. Bradley or\ninitiating our own action to remedy the conditions that violate\npatients' constitutional and federal statutory rights.  In light\nof this case, we have served a copy of this letter on the\nappropriate federal court.\nFinally, we note we did not have the benefit of the on-site\nreview of institutional conditions contemplated by CRIPA priojr to\ndetermining these findings.  Your own IG report, however, has\nsubstantiated many of the allegations we received.  Consistent\nwith the legislative history of CRIPA, we have been obliged to\ninfer that many of the allegations we have received regarding; G.\nPierce Wood are true in view of your failure to permit an\ninspection or provide requested documentation, and the findings\nof your IG report.\n\n- 12 -\nIf you or any member of your staff have any questions,\nplease feel free to contact Tawana Davis at  (202) 514-6534 or\nBill Maddox at  (202) 514-6251.\nDeval L.

SHELDON,\nDefendant.\n___________________________/\nO R D E R\nThis cause comes before the Court for consideration of two motions: (1) Defendant's First\nMotion to Exit Consent Decree (Doc. No. 1565) and (2) Defendant's Supplemental Motion to\nExit Consent Decree (Doc. No. 1577).  These motions were considered by United States\nMagistrate Judge Thomas B. McCoun III.  Judge McCoun has filed his report recommending\nthat the motions be granted in part.  (Doc. No. 1611).  All parties were furnished copies of the\nReport and Recommendation and were afforded the opportunity to file objections pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1).  Objections to the Magistrate's Report and Recommendation were filed by\nboth parties.  (Doc. No. 1612, 1613).  Upon consideration of the Report and Recommendation\nand the parties' objections thereto, and upon this Court's independent examination of the file,\nincluding reviewing the transcript of the hearing that was held on April 9, 2009 (Doc. No. 1594),\nit is determined that the Report and Recommendation (Doc. No. 1611) should be adopted.\nI.  Background\nAt issue in these motions is whether four districts--Suncoast Region (\"SCR\"), District 8\n(\"D-8\"), District 14 (\"D-14\"), and District 15 (\"D-15\")--have complied with the community\n\ncompliance exit criteria set forth in the Stipulation Regarding Exit Criteria that was executed by\nthe parties on February 12, 1993 (\"1993 Stipulation\"), as modified by the Court's Order dated\nMarch 19, 2004 (Doc. No. 1551), such that they may exit the Consent Decree and end this\nlitigation.  Pursuant to the 1993 Stipulation, the level of compliance required to exit is defined as\nfollows:\n1. 85 percent of all class members will achieve positive results on 6 of the 7\n(85%) community compliance areas.\n2. Each district will exit any individual community compliance area when 85\npercent or more people in the sample meet the requirements of any\ncompliance area(s). Monitoring will continue for the full sample across all\nseven community compliance areas until the required performance level of\n85 percent has been achieved in all seven compliance areas. Monitoring of\nthose compliance areas where the standard has been previously achieved\nshall be considered technical assistance and any future scores shall not\naffect the district(s) ability to exit overall.\n3. Each district will exit independent of the performance of any other district\nwhen the performance criteria stated on 1 and 2 above have been\nachieved.\n(Doc. 1605, p. 5 of 18).\nThe definition of the class has been an issue in several Orders.  (Doc. No. 54, 246, 1498,\n1516).  The class definition includes \"those patients discharged from GPW [G. Pierce Wood\nMemorial Hospital] into a community treatment facility.\"  (Doc. No. 1498).  In an Order dated\nJanuary 15, 2003, the Court clarified this class definition by stating that \"patients who move out\nof the catchment area or who refuse treatment lose their status as class members.\"  (Doc. No.\n1498).  Thereafter, on April 11, 2003, this Court further clarified the class definition and stated\nthe following:\n[C]lass members have the right to make treatment decisions, including the decision\nto refuse treatment. Individuals who refuse all treatment lose their status as class\nmembers. Clearly, the Court did not intend the refusal of treatment to include\nsporadic refusals of medication, such as the refusal of certain medications due to\n2\n\nside effects or pregnancy. Nor did the Court intend the definition to apply to those\nindividuals who refuse certain treatments or certain treatment facilities only to\nchange their minds a short time later, or to those individuals who are not\ncompetent to refuse treatment. . . . Refusal of treatment means a refusal of all\ntreatment for a significant period of time. \n(Doc. No. 1516).  \nBased on the community compliance reviews conducted in 2007 and 2008, Defendant\ncontends that the four remaining districts have complied with the community compliance exit\ncriteria set forth in the 1993 Stipulation, because each district achieved compliance in at least six\nof the seven community compliance areas in 2007 or 2008.  In response, Plaintiffs challenge\nwhether certain class members were improperly excluded from these reviews due to Defendant\nimproperly classifying certain patients as no longer being members of the class.  Specifically,\nPlaintiffs challenge whether patients classified as \"movers\" (those who moved out of the\ncatchment area) and \"refusers\" (those who refused all treatment for at least 90 days) were\nimproperly excluded.\nWith regards to patients classified as \"movers,\" Defendant takes the position that\naccording to this Court's Order stating that \"patients who move out of the catchment area . . . lose\ntheir status as class members,\" it properly excluded patients who moved out of the catchment\narea, even if such patients later moved back.  (Doc. No. 1498).  With regards to patients\nclassified as \"refusers,\" Defendant takes the position that if a patient refused all treatment for at\nleast ninety days, such patient is deemed to have refused all treatment for a significant period of\ntime, and according to this Court's April 11, 2003 Order, such patient is no longer a member of\nthe class.\nThe monitor reviewed the 2007 and 2008 community compliance reviews, and she\nevaluated Defendant's compliance with the community compliance exit criteria under three\nscenarios: (1) under Defendant's definition of the class, which excluded all patients who moved\n3\n\nout of the catchment area or who refused all treatment for at least ninety days, (2) under\nDefendant's definition of the class, plus the excluded movers and refusers identified by the\nMonitor (with the assumption that all of these excluded movers and refusers would fail the\ncompliance reviews), and (3) under Defendant's definition of the class, plus the excluded\nrefusers identified by the Monitor (with the assumption that all of these excluded refusers would\nfail the compliance reviews).  Below is the Monitor's summary of Defendant's compliance with\nthe seven community compliance areas under each scenario (Doc. No. 1605, p. 15):\n2007\nDefendant's definition of Defendant's definition Defendant's definition\nthe class (which excludes of the class, plus movers of the class, plus\nmovers and refusers) and refusers identified refusers identified by\nby the Monitor the Monitor\nD-8 6 out of 7 6 out of 7 6 out of 7\nD-14 7 out of 7 1 out of 7 6 out of 7\nD-15 6 out of 7 3 out of 7 6 out of 7\nSCR 7 out of 7 6 out of 7 6 out of 7\n2008\nDefendant's definition of Defendant's definition Defendant's definition\nthe class (which excludes of the class, plus movers of the class, plus\nmovers and refusers) and refusers identified refusers identified by\nby the Monitor the Monitor\nD-8 6 out of 7 6 out of 7 6 out of 7\nD-14 7 out of 7 3 out of 7 7 out of 7\nD-15 7 out of 7 5 out of 7 7 out of 7\nSCR 5 out of 7 5 out of 7 5 out of 7\nAccordingly, under Defendant's definition of the class and interpretation of the\ncommunity compliance exit criteria, all four districts should be allowed to exit the Consent\n4\n\nDecree, because each district achieved compliance in at least six of the seven community\ncompliance areas in 2007 or 2008.  However, under Plaintiffs' definition of the class (which\nincludes both movers and refusers) and interpretation of the community compliance exit criteria,\nnone of the districts should exit the Consent Decree, because none of the districts achieved\ncompliance in all seven of the seven community compliance areas in 2007 or 2008. \nAdditionally, under the third alternative definition of the class (which includes refusers but does\nnot include movers), D-14 and D-15 can exit the Consent Decree, because those two districts\nachieved compliance in all seven of the seven community compliance areas in 2008.\nAfter reviewing the motions and holding a hearing on April 9, 2009, Judge McCoun\nmade the following conclusions and recommendations: With regards to the issue of whether\nDefendant correctly classified movers as no longer being members of the class once they move\nout of the catchment area, even if they later return, Judge McCoun agreed with Defendant's\ninterpretation of this Court's January 15, 2003 Order.  As such, Judge McCoun overruled\nPlaintiffs' objection regarding the exclusion of movers from the compliance reviews.\nWith regards to the issue of whether Defendant correctly classified refusers as no longer\nbeing members of the class after refusing all treatment for 90 days, Judge McCoun rejected\nDefendant's position.  Instead, Judge McCoun agreed with Plaintiffs' position that when this\nCourt stated in its April 11, 2003 Order that in order to be excluded from the class, the patient\nmust refuse all treatment for a significant period of time, the Court meant refusal for more than\n90 days.  Additionally, Judge McCoun agreed with the Monitor that eight of the patients that\nwere excluded from the compliance reviews as refusers, but who were identified by the Monitor\n5\n\nas having not consistently refused all treatment for at least twelve to fourteen months, should not\nhave been excluded from the class.1\nAs a result of these conclusions regarding which patients made up the class, Judge\nMcCoun recommended that D-14 and D-15 be allowed to exit from the Consent Decree, because\nthose two districts achieved compliance in all seven of the seven community compliance areas in\n2008.  Defendant argued that the Court's supervision had gone on long enough, and given its\nsubstantial compliance with the community compliance exit criteria, the Court should also allow\nD-8 and SCR to exit from the Consent Decree.  Judge McCoun rejected Defendant's argument\nbased on the 1993 Stipulation.  \nIn the 1993 Stipulation, the parties specifically agreed that the community compliance\nexit criteria \"shall be the sole and exclusive method for assessing the Defendants' performance\nand determining their completion of designated community-based obligations.\"2 (1993\nStipulation, p. 7, ยถ 7).  Additionally, the 1993 Stipulation provides that the exit criteria shall be\nthe sole and exclusive method for determining termination under the Consent Decree unless the\nparties agree otherwise and obtain the Court and Monitor's approval. (1993 Stipulation, p. 4, ยถ\n1).  \nII.  Plaintiffs' Objections to the Report and Recommendation\nAfter Judge McCoun issued his Report and Recommendation, Plaintiffs filed their\nobjections thereto.  Specifically, Plaintiffs object to Judge McCoun's determination that\n1\nFour were in SCR, and four were in D-15).  (Doc. No. 1611, p. 6).\n2\nThe 1993 Stipulation was filed at Doc. No. 343.  However, the Court issued an Order on July 12,\n1994 (Doc. No. 457) that was incorrectly docketed and resulted in the Clerk's Office improperly striking\nDoc. No. 343.  As such, on September 29, 2009, the Courtc alled the attorney for the Monitor and requested\nthat he file a copy of the 1993 Stipulation so that it would be in the record.\n6\n\nDefendant properly excluded from the compliance reviews patients that moved out of the\ncatchment area but later returned.  In support of their position that movers should not have been\nexcluded from compliance reviews, Plaintiffs argue: (1) movers should be treated similarly to\nrefusers and should not be excluded if they have not moved out of the catchment area for a\nsignificant period of time, and (2) excluding movers infringes on their constitutional right to\ntravel because it results in them forfeiting their right to treatment based on their decision to\ntravel.  These arguments have no merit.\nThe Court rejects Plaintiffs' argument that patients who move out of the catchment area\nshould be treated the same as patients who refuse treatment, and as such, movers should not lose\ntheir status as class members if they return to the catchment area before a significant period of\ntime elapses.  Requiring a patient to refuse all treatment for a significant length of time before\nexcluding the patient from the class ensures that the patient's right to make treatment decisions is\nprotected and recognizes that a short-term refusal of treatment can have a legitimate medical\npurpose or reason (such as side-effects, pregnancy, or incompetency) that does not necessarily\nindicate a long-term decision to refuse all treatment.  However, moving out of the catchment area\nis viewed by the Court as more of a long-term decision.  If a patient decides to move and reside\nelsewhere, implicitly, the patient is making a decision to terminate his or her treatment within the\ncatchment area.\nFurthermore, excluding movers from the compliance reviews does not infringe on their\nright to travel.  Choosing to move and reside outside of the catchment area is different from\ntraveling.  Also, the movers' right to treatment is not affected in any way; instead, movers are\nsimply no longer included in the compliance reviews.  Judge McCoun noted in his Report and\n7\n\nRecommendation that movers who returned to the catchment area were not denied treatment\nwhen they returned, and instead, such patients are treated as \"priority clients\" upon their return.\nAccordingly, the Court overrules Plaintiffs' objections to the Report and\nRecommendation.  As such, the Court adopts Judge McCoun's recommendation that the Court\nfind that Defendant did not improperly exclude movers from the compliance reviews.\nIII.  Defendant's Objections to the Report and Recommendation\nDefendant also filed objections to Judge McCoun's Report and Recommendation. \nSpecifically, Defendant objects to Judge McCoun's recommendation that D-8 and SCR not be\nallowed to exit the Consent Decree.  In support of its contention, Defendant makes the following\narguments: (1) there is new information showing that SCR achieved compliance in all seven of\nthe seven community compliance areas in 2007; (2) Judge McCoun incorrectly applied the\ncommunity compliance exit criteria; and (3) the Court should employ the \"flexible approach\" set\nforth in Horne v. Flores, 129 S. Ct 2579 (2009), and find that the Consent Decree should be\nterminated based on Defendant's substantial compliance.  Upon review, the Court defers ruling\non the first argument and rejects the remaining two arguments.\nA.  New Information Regarding One Refuser\nDefendant first argues that there is new information showing that one of the four refusers\nin SCR that the Monitor and Judge McCoun determined was still part of the class was not\nauditable in 2007.  Specifically, Defendant contends that this one refuser was in a state treatment\nfacility for the entire period covered by SCR's 2007 compliance review, and as a result, that\npatient should not have been considered.  As such, Defendant argues that if that refuser is\n8\n\nexcluded from the 2007 compliance review, then SCR achieved compliance in all seven of the\nseven community compliance areas in 2007.  \nThe current motions have been pending for more than a year, and this Court is not\ninclined to delay its ruling based on this new information.  As such, the Court will permit\nDefendant to file a motion and raise the issue of whether SCR fully satisfied the community\ncompliance exit criteria in 2007 based on this new information regarding the one refuser.  The\nCourt will consider this new argument after it is fully briefed and both Plaintiffs and the Monitor\nhave had an opportunity to review the new information and respond.  \nB.  Application of the Community Compliance Exit Criteria\nNext, Defendant argues that Judge McCoun incorrectly applied the community\ncompliance exit criteria by requiring two levels of compliance, one of which he deemed required\ncompliance in all seven of the seven community compliance areas.3  For the first time, Defendant\nnow argues that paragraphs 1 and 2 of the community compliance exit criteria describing the\nlevel of compliance required to exit the Consent Decree is contradictory.  This argument has no\nmerit.\nPursuant to the 1993 Stipulation, the level of compliance required to exit the Consent\nDecree is defined as follows:\n3\nThe seven community compliance areas can be briefly described as follows: (1) placement in the\ncommunity in a less restrictive setting than GPW; (2) clinical assessments; (3) functional assessments; (4)\ntreatment planning services based upon pr ofessional judgment at the level and intensity needed; (5)\nopportunities to exercise choice based upon available alternatives and to participate in the development of\nhis/her SIP; (6) level and intensity of services, descbried in the SIP goals, to meet the class membersโ needs;\nand (7) detailed progress notes.  In the remainder of this Order, the Court sometimes refers to these seven\ncommunity compliance areas as seven community-based benefits.\n9\n\n1. 85 percent of all class members will achieve positive results on 6 of the 7\n(85%) community compliance areas.\n2. Each district will exit any individual community compliance area when 85\npercent or more people in the sample meet the requirements of any\ncompliance area(s). Monitoring will continue for the full sample across all\nseven community compliance areas until the required performance level of\n85 percent has been achieved in all seven compliance areas. Monitoring of\nthose compliance areas where the standard has been previously achieved\nshall be considered technical assistance and any future scores shall not\naffect the district(s) ability to exit overall.\n3. Each district will exit independent of the performance of any other district\nwhen the performance criteria stated on 1 and 2 above have been\nachieved.\n(Doc. 1605, p. 5 of 18).  \nBased on the plain language set forth above, there are two levels of compliance: First,\n85% of the class must achieve positive results in six of the seven community compliance areas. \nThis first level of compliance ensures that each class member is obtaining at least six of the\nseven community-based benefits.  Thus, this first level focuses on whether each member is\ngenerally receiving the community-based benefits as a whole.  \nSecond, each of the seven community-based benefits must have been received by at least\n85% of the class.  This second level of compliance ensures that each of the community-based\nbenefits are being provided to at least 85% of the class.  Thus, this second level focuses on the\nprovision of each specific community-based benefit.    \nAccordingly, there are two levels of compliance that must be met before a district can\nexit the Consent Decree, and these two levels are set forth in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the\ncommunity compliance exit criteria.  Defendant's argument that there are not two levels of\n10\n\ncompliance and/or that paragraphs 1 and 2 are contradictory borders on frivolous.4  Furthermore,\nto the extent that Defendant argues that in order to exit the Consent Decree, there must only be\ncompliance in six of the seven community compliance areas, Defendant's position is negated by\nthe plain language cited above, which clearly requires compliance in all seven of the seven\ncommunity compliance areas. \nC.  Substantial Compliance\nNext, Defendant argues that based on the recent Supreme Court case, Horne v. Flores,\n129 S. Ct. 2579 (2009), this Court should terminate the Consent Decree.  Specifically, Defendant\nargues that based on the \"flexible approach\" described in Horne regarding the evaluation of\nmotions filed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5)5 and Defendant's substantial\ncompliance with the community compliance exit criteria, this Court should terminate the\nConsent Decree.  \nIn Horne, the Supreme Court stated the following regarding Rule 60(b)(5):\n[T]he Rule provides a means by which a party can ask a court to modify or vacate\na judgment or order if a significant change either in factual conditions or in law\nrenders continued enforcement detrimental to the public interest.  The party\nseeking relief bears the burden of establishing that changed circumstances warrant\nrelief, but once a party carries this burden, a court abuses its discretion when it\nrefuses to modify an injunction or consent decree in light of such changes.\n4\nEqually as frivolous is Defendants' argument, raised for the first time in its objections to the Report\nand Recommendation, that paragraph 2 of the community compliance exit criteria contains a typographical\nerror in the second sentence such that the  phrase \"six of the\" was inadvertently left out.  According to\nDefendant, paragraph 2 should read as follows (with the allegedly m issing phrase added in br ackets):\n\"Monitoring will continue f or the f ull sample across all seven com munity compliance areas until the\nrequired performance level of 85 percent has been achie ved in all [six of the] seven compliance areas.\"\nThere is no support for Defendant's argument.\n5\nRule 60(b)(5) provides that a  court may relieve a party from  a judgm ent when applying it\nprospectively is no longer equitable. \n11\n\nRule 60(b)(5) serves a particularly important function in what we have termed\nโinstitutional reform litigation.โ  For one thing, injunctions issued in such cases\noften remain in force for many years, and the passage of time frequently brings\nabout changed circumstances-changes in the nature of the underlying problem,\nchanges in governing law or its interpretation by the courts, and new policy\ninsights-that warrant reexamination of the original judgment.\nId. at 2593 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  The Court went on to state:\n[I]n recognition of the features of institutional reform decrees, we have held that\ncourts must take a โflexible approachโ to Rule 60(b)(5) motions addressing such\ndecrees.  A flexible approach allows courts to ensure that responsibility for\ndischarging the State's obligations is returned promptly to the State and its\nofficials when the circumstances warrant.  In applying this flexible approach,\ncourts must remain attentive to the fact that federal-court decrees exceed\nappropriate limits if they are aimed at eliminating a condition that does not violate\n[federal law] or does not flow from such a violation.  If [a federal consent decree\nis] not limited to reasonable and necessary implementations of federal law, it may\nimproperly deprive future officials of their designated legislative and executive\npowers.\nFor these reasons, a critical question in this Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry is whether the\nobjective of the . . . . declaratory judgment order . . . has been achieved.  If a\ndurable remedy has been implemented, continued enforcement of the order is not\nonly unnecessary, but improper.\nId. at 2494-95 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\nDefendant argues that in 2007, D-8 failed to achieve compliance in only one of the  seven\nof the community compliance areas.  Specifically, in the community compliance area of\ntreatment planning, D-8 scored an 84%, which is 1% less than the minimum required score of\n85% needed for compliance.  (Doc. No. 1573, p. 21 of 26)  Therefore, Defendant argues, if in\n2007, just one of the patients in D-8 that had scored negatively in treatment planning had\nactually scored positively, then D-8 would have achieved the required minimum score of 85% in\nall seven of the community compliance areas.6\n6\nDefendant's substantial compliance argument is also based on the assumption that the Court accepts\nDefendant's contention based on new information that one of the refusers in SCR should have been excluded\nfrom the 2007 compliance review, and if that refuser had been excluded, then SCR would have achieved\n12\n\nWhile the Court acknowledges that Defendant has undertaken sweeping modifications\nand improvements to the community mental health system within the catchment area in the past\nten years, the Court finds that it must honor the parties' agreement regarding how to determine\nwhen the Consent Decree should be terminated.  As previously stated, the parties specifically\nagreed in the 1993 Stipulation that the community compliance exit criteria \"shall be the sole and\nexclusive method for assessing the Defendants' performance and determining their completion of\ndesignated community-based obligations.\" (1993 Stipulation, p. 7, ยถ 7).  Additionally, the 1993\nStipulation provides that the exit criteria shall be the sole and exclusive method for determining\ntermination under the Consent Decree unless the parties agree otherwise and obtain the Court\nand Monitor's approval. (1993 Stipulation, p. 4, ยถ 1).  Given that the parties have not agreed that\nthe Consent Decree should be terminated, and given that SCR and D-8 have not yet\ndemonstrated full compliance with the community compliance exit criteria, termination is not\nwarranted under the terms of the 1993 Stipulation.  Furthermore, the Court finds that the\napplication of the flexible approach delineated in Horne does not change the Court's conclusion\nthat the objective of the Consent Decree has not yet been achieved.  Therefore, the Court\ndeclines Defendant's invitation to terminate the Consent Decree, despite Defendant's substantial\ncompliance.\ncompliance in all seven of the community compliance areas.  However, as previously stated, the Court has\ndeferred ruling on this argument at this time and has directed Defendant to file a motion addressing this\nissue.\n13\n\nIV.  Conclusion\nAccordingly, it is now ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that: \n(1) The Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation (Doc. No. 1611) is\nadopted and incorporated by reference in this Order of the Court.\n(2) Defendant's First Motion to Exit Consent Decree (Doc. No. 1565) and\nDefendant's Supplemental Motion to Exit Consent Decree (Doc. No.\n1577) are GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART:  The\nmotions are GRANTED to the extent that the Court finds that District 14\nand District 15 have fully satisfied the community compliance exit criteria\nand are authorized to exit the Consent Decree and the Court's supervision\nand Orders thereunder; otherwise, the motions are DENIED, except that\nDefendant may raise the issue of whether the Suncoast Region fully\nsatisfied the community compliance exit criteria in 2007 based on the new\ninformation regarding the one refuser that Defendant contends should\nhave been excluded from the 2007 compliance review.  Monitoring shall\ncontinue in accordance with the Consent Decree and the community\ncompliance exit criteria as to District 8 and the Suncoast Region.\nDONE AND ORDERED at Tampa, Florida, this 30th day of September, 2009.\nCopies to:\nThe Honorable Thomas B.

VI nri Ha\nDeval L. Patrick  โ/omArthur E.

Pierce Wood Memorial Hospital  (\"Pierce\") in\nArcadia, Florida. 1/  Landmark is a state-operated  institution\nhousing approximately 300 developmentally disabled adults and\nchildren.  Pierce is a state-operated institution housing\napproximately 445 mentally ill adults on both a short and long\nterm basis.\nResidents of state operated facilities for the\ndevelopmentally disabled and mentally retarded have a fundamental\nFourteenth Amendment due process right to reasonable safety,\nadequate medical care and training.  Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S.\n307  (1982).  Such training must be sufficient to protect each\nresident's liberty interests and permit each resident an\nopportunity to function as independently as their individual\n1/  Pierce is the subject of a 1989 consent decree filed in\nJohnson v. Bradley, C.A. No. 87-369  (M.D. Fla. 6/1/89) and of a\nmonitor who ostensively evaluates compliance from time to time.\nPlaintiffs are represented by James K. Green, sole practitioner\nwithout adequate resources to address the multitude of compliance\nissues.  State defendants have filed a series of motions to\ndismiss, motions to dismiss the monitor and other motions to\nterminate the case.\nConditions at Pierce, as described in the text, are\nespecially egregious -- suicide by hanging, an unobserved\npatient cuts off both hands, and three patients die in a single\nweek.  In view of the protracted violations and the apparent\ninability of plaintiffs' lawyer to address these problems alone,\nour involvement is warranted.  Obviously, compliance in Bradley\nhas not been achieved and Mr. Green welcomes our participation.\n\n- 2 -\nhandicapping conditions permit.  See, e.g., Thomas S. by Brooks\nv. Flaherty. 699 F. Supp. 1178  (W.D. N.C. 1988); United States v.\nTennessee. No. 92-2062, slip op. at 12 (W.D. Tenn. Feb. 17,\n1994); Halderman v. Pennhurst State School & Hospital, No. 74-\n1345,  slip op. (E.D. Pa. March 29, 1994).  See also 42 C.F.R.\nยง 483.440.\nWe have obtained information that indicates residents of\nLandmark and Pierce are being harmed and exposed to unreasonable\nrisks of harm in violation of their constitutional and statutory\nrights. 2./  Alleged unconstitutional violations include the\nfollowing:  abuse and neglect of residents, inadequate medical\nand psychiatric care, and failure to provide residents with\nadequate training programs.  See Youngberg v. Romeo. 457 U.S. 307\n(1982).  In addition, Landmark and Pierce are institutions that\nunduly segregate their residents from the rest of society solely\non the basis of their disabilities.  As a result, these\nfacilities are failing to provide services to their residents in\nthe least separate, most integrated setting as required by the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990  (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C.\nยง 12101 et. seq. , and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of\n1973,  29 U.S.C. ยง 794 et sea.\nPOSSIBLE VIOLATIONS\nA.  The State of Florida Fails to Provide Landmark\nand Pierce Residents with Services in the\nLeast Separate. Most Integrated Setting.\nLandmark and Pierce are isolated, self-contained\ninstitutional environments that separate their residents from the\nrest of society on the basis of their disabilities.  As such,\nstate officials are subjecting these individuals to conditions\nthat violate the ADA and Section 504.  Landmark and Pierce also\ninappropriately discriminate against a certain class of their\nresidents by allowing a double standard of care for residents\nwithin the facilities.  Landmark and Pierce have a number of\nunlicensed beds, i.e., beds that do not meet the federal\nregulatory standards enacted pursuant to the medicaid and\nmedicare programs.  The unlicensed beds at Landmark and Pierce do\nnot meet these minimum standards of care set to safeguard the\ncare and protection of residents in state facilities.  The\npractical result of this distinction is to set a dual standard of\ncare within the institution between those residents in licensed\n2/  Conditions at Pierce were first brought to our attention by\nofficials of the Health Care Financing Administration of the\nDepartment of Health and Human Services  (HHS) in a telephone call\nseveral months ago.  This is highly unusual and suggests the\ngravity of the deficiencies at Pierce.  This is the first such\ncall of this kind within memory.\n\n- 3 -\nbeds protected by the standards set by licensing agencies and\nthose in unlicensed beds for whom that protection is with-\nheld. 3/  Such discrimination violates Section 504 and the ADA.\nIn addition, at Pierce, Health Care Finance Administration\n(\"HCFA\") surveyors recently found that Pierce has inadequate\nnursing coverage for its licensed and unlicensed units and often\npulls staff off the non-licensed units to cover nursing shortages\nin the licensed portion of the facility. 4./\nThe state has failed to provide Landmark residents with\nsufficient numbers of needed placements in a community setting.\nAs a result, many Landmark residents who are suited for community\nplacement continue to be isolated from the rest of society.  Not\nonly does the segregation violate the residents' statutory rights\nunder Section 504 of the ADA, but the care and treatment afforded\nthem in the institution does not rise to the level of care\nprovided elsewhere in the community as required under the above\nstatutes.\nThe state has also failed to provide Pierce residents\nwith adequate mental health services in the community. 5/\nCurrently, Pierce houses between 50 and 100 residents who are\nsuitable for immediate release into the community. 6/  Due to\nthe lack of available community mental health services, residents\ncontinue to be segregated in a remote and isolated institution.\nThe state's failure to provide services in the community violates\nSection 504 and the ADA.\n3./  The Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services\nundertook a study of four Florida ICF/MR facilities, including\nLandmark, that showed that .... \"dual levels of care exist\nbetween licensed and unlicensed units in all facilities since\nsome therapies are not available to persons in unlicensed units.\n. . .  Many of the individuals in unlicensed homes have severe\nbehavioral problems or self injurious behavior.\"  Unlicensed Beds\nIn Developmental Services Institutions Study  (Department of\nHealth and Rehabilitative Services), 1994, at 2.\n4./  Health Care Financing Administration  (\"HCFA\") Survey\nInformation on G.

Green, P.A.,\nFebruary 14, 19 95.\n\n- 4 -\nB.  The State Fails to Ensure that Landmark and Pierce\nResidents are Free from Abuse and Neglect.\nA local advocacy group called the Advocacy Center for\nPersons with Disabilities published a report entitled the\nLandmark Learning Center Review  (\"The  Review\") that revealed\nrampant physical and mental abuse of Landmark residents. 2.1\nLandmark has a history of abuse dating back to at least 1987.\nOne such incident that occurred in 1993 involved a severely\ndysfunctional resident who died as a result of a blow to the\nabdomen. 8./  The resident had suffered a fifty  (50) pound\nweight loss in the month-preceding his death. 9./  Landmark\nofficials were unable to give a satisfactory explanation for the\nweight loss and death. 1J3/  In addition, a male resident died\non November 18, 1991, at the hospital after experiencing severe\ninternal bleeding. 1.1/  The resident broke his femur at 11:00\np.m. and was not brought to the hospital until 10:15 a.m. the\nnext morning. 12./ He  died at around noon that same day.  The\nattending doctor reported that the resident suffered from\nnumerous bruises. 12./ Such incidents indicate that the\ntreatment and care of the mentally retarded at Landmark is\ndirectly and adversely affected by untrained and abusive staff.\nThe examples listed above demonstrate a continued pattern of\nabuse and neglect.  From 1989-1994, five  (5) residents have died\nand three of those deaths occurred in one eight day time\nperiod. 14./  A Health Care Quality Assurance  (\"HCQA\") team of\nthe Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services\nl_l Advocacy Center for Persons with Disabilities, Landmark\nLearning Center Review,  (\"The  Review\"), 1992, at 6.  Recent\nreports by the Advocacy Center indicate that conditions at\nLandmark have not- improved since The Review was released.\nLandmark Learning Center December 1993 Report.\n8./  Jacquee Petchel, Unexplained Deaths Mount, Miami Herald,\nNov. 23, 1993, at Al.\n9_/  Telephone Conversation with Karen Curran, attorney for the\nresident's family, August, 1993.\n10/  Id.\n1JL/  Telephone Conversation with Mark Stokes, attorney for the\nresident's family, August 1993.\n12/  Id.\n11/  Id.\n14/  Id.\n\n- 5 -\n(\"HRS\") conducted a special visit to Landmark following the three\ndeaths in eight days. JL5./ The report stated:\n[T]he overall findings of the team indicate that each\nof the three deaths contained elements that could t>e\nviewed as demonstrating deficiencies in the quality of\ncare delivered by the facility.  Each case involved a\nseries of systematic, technical, and administrative\nproblems that, when taken together, created an\nenvironment making it possible for the deaths to\noccur. 16/\nIn 1992, the Review reported high mortality rates at Landmark\nwhere seven (7) residents died in a five month period starting\nOctober 1991 through March 1992. 17/ In 1994, Chris Schuh,\nwith the Association for Retarded Citizens  (\"ARC\"), stated that\n\" . .. the death rate now (at Landmark) has not decreased since\n1991\". 18/\nPierce also fails to protect its patients from harm.  Last\nsummer, three patients died within one week.  A 73 year old\npatient died by choking on food on August 14, 1994.  Prior to his\ndeath, this patient had experienced a choking episode in March\n1994.  Following a medical evaluation, the patient was placed on\na pureed diet.  On the day of his death, the patient was observed\nby staff stumbling and falling outside the on-unit dining room\nafter the evening meal at 5:17 p.m.  Resuscitation efforts\nproved unsuccessful and the patient was declared dead at\n5:50 p.m. 19/\nThe autopsy revealed masses of small fragments of food\nmaterial throughout the trachea and bronchial tree and food\nthroughout the lungs including \"fragments as large as grains of\nrice . . . . \" 2.0./  The medical examiner listed the official\ncause of death as \"acute cardiorespiratory failure due to\nId.\n16/  Id.\n17/  The Review, at 6.\n18/  Telephone Conversation with Chris Schuh, Association for\nRetarded Citizens, September 19, 1994.\n19/  HCFA Adjunct Survey Report  (September 20, 1994) .\n20/  Id.\n\n- 6 -\naspiration of food into the larynx and trachea due to accidental\ncauses.\" 21/\nFour days later, a 25 year old female patient died while on\none to one suicide precaution watch.  Hospital policy provides\nthat the assigned staff person must document the patient's\nactivities and location every 15 minutes.  Upon review of\nhospital records, HCFA found that from 5:45 a.m. until the\nresident was found unresponsive on a sofa at 6:55 a.m.,  there\nwere no entries documenting observations of the patient. 22/\nIn addition, HCFA found that no RN's were assigned to the\npatient's unit on 6 of the 21 shifts during the week of her death\nresulting in inadequate nursing coverage.  During the actual\nshift on which the patient died, there was a nursing complement\nof 4 aides and .5 RN.  Three of the 23 patients on the unit were\non 1:1 suicide watch.  Such nurse staffing left the .5 RN and 1\naide responsible for the remaining 20 patients. 23/\nOn August 20, 1994, a 26 year old male was found hanging\nfrom a tree outside by a fellow patient and two staff persons who\nwere looking for him to give him his evening medication. 24/\nThe resident had a long history of command hallucinations telling\nhim to kill himself and had frequently been on 1:1 suicide watch.\nIn fact, he had been on suicide watch up until 2 days prior to\nhis death.  The progress notes for the day of his death begin\nonly at the time the resident was found hanged.  The HCFA report\non this death called for a review of the indications for\nmaintaining patients on a suicide watch when they exhibit serious\nsuicidal tendencies. 25/\nIn July 1994, a male resident at Pierce seriously injured\nhimself.  The patient scaled, unobserved, a 12 foot tall chain\nlink fence and gate topped with 3 strands of barbed wire and slid\nthrough an 18 inch gap in the ceiling of a garage which housed,\namong other items, a circular saw.  He was found at 6:15 p.m. by\na security guard who saw him standing in the window of the garage\nholding up both bloody arms with his hands missing.  The hands\nwere found palm up on the table.  The staff did not realize the\n21/  Id.\n21/  Id.\n23/  Id.\n24/  Id.\n25./  Id.\n\n- 7 โ\nresident was missing until he was noted absent for his 6:00 p.m.\nmedication. 26/\nC.  The State Fails to Provide Landmark and\nPierce Residents with Adequate Medical and\nPsychiatric Care.\nLandmark fails to provide its residents with adequate\nmedical and psychiatric care.  Landmark still does not have the\nsystems in place to safeguard residents against over-medication,\ninadequate review of psychotropic medication, use of gastrostomy\ntubes for the convenience of staff, and misdiagnoses of serious\nillnesses that can and have led to death. 2J7/  For example, a\nresident died of cancer without ever being treated for that\ndisease while another resident died from an allergic reaction to\na drug.  Both incidents indicate lack of systemic, adequate and\nconsistent care. 2.8/  Landmark also has the highest ratio of\nresidents in a ICF/DD facility with gastrostomy tubes in the\ncountry, many of which were inserted for the convenience of the\nstaff or due to lack of adequate staffing. 23.1 Monitoring of\npotentially harmful side effects of psychotropic medications with\nneurological testing and/or periodic review is sporadic. 30/\nPierce also fails to provide adequate psychiatric care to\nits residents.  Progress notes must be recorded weekly for the\nfirst two months and at least once a month thereafter.  The\nprogress notes must contain recommendations for revisions in the\ntreatment plan as indicated as well as precise assessments of the\npatient's progress in accordance with the original or revised\ntreatment plan. 3_l/  HCFA surveyors found that the psychia-\ntrist at Pierce failed to record progress notes in a timely\nmanner for the first two months and thereafter.  They also found\nthat changes in medications, response to psychiatric treatments\nand changes in psychiatric treatment plans were not routinely\n26/  HCFA Complaint Investigation Survey  (August 18, 1994); Don\nMoore, Month Took Toll at GPW, DeSoto Sun Herald, August 30,\n1994, at 1.\n27/ Id.\n28./ Id.\n21/ Id.\n30/ Id.\n31/  HCFA Statement of Deficiencies and Plan of Correction\n(August 18, 1994) at 2.\n\n- 8 -\ndocumented by progress notes in all cases. .32./  In addition,\nHCFA indicated that it is not clear whether the psychiatrist, who\nis responsible for 53 residents, is involved in the on-going care\nof every patient on the unit surveyed. 33/\nD.  The State Fails to Provide Landmark Residents\nwith an Adequately Safe Living Environment.\nLandmark's physical environment also impacts the health of\nthe residents.  The Health Care Financing Administration (\"HCFA\")\nfound in August, 1992, that deficiencies in the kitchen areas\nincluded freezers and refrigerators that did not meet\ntemperatures considered safe for the maintenance of food items,\noutdated food and rusty can openers, and numerous unsanitary and\nunsafe conditions. 3_4/  In June, 1993, HCFA again found the\nsame deficiencies with regard to equipment and food.  HCFA\nfurther found dirty food delivery containers, containers of\nuncovered rancid grease, rusting and peeling metal on ice\nmachines, rotting boxes with nearby rodent excrement, leaking\nroof tiles that had allowed water to leak onto sugar that was\ncurrently being used and two large, dirty garbage containers of\nwilted lettuce intended for resident consumption. 3_5/  In\nDecember, 1993, the Advocacy Center for Persons with Disabilities\nfound the following:\n[C]onditions in the kitchen were unsanitary  . . ..\n[F]ood was observed falling on the floor and staff\npicking it up and placing it back on the serving trays.\nThere was no attempt to keep food covered, and many\nflies were observed on the food.  Furthermore, LLC is\nstill using the meal trays and styrofoam take out boxes\nwhich were cited as problems in the November/December\n1992 review of LLC Administration and Management\nstructure by HRS.\n32/  Id.\n33/  HCFA Survey Information for G.

The State Fails to Provide Landmark and\nPierce Residents With Adequate Programming\nand Treatment.\nLandmark fails to provide training programs designed to meet\nthe specific needs of individual residents and abate or eliminate\nself-injurious behaviors.  The Advocacy Center reported\nnegligible active treatment and \"an unacceptable and astonishing\nnumber of residents who exhibit stereotypical and other\ninstitutional type behaviors.\" 3J7/  The Advocacy Center\nfurther stated that \"the lack of behavioral programming remains\na serious deficiency which has not been improved since\n1992.\" 3_8/  Pre-vocational and other training programs are not\nwell attended and are frequently cancelled. 3_9/  As a result,\nLandmark fails to prevent the regression and/or loss of skills of\nits residents.\nPierce also fails to provide adequate training programs to\nmeet the specific needs of individual residents.  Each patient\nmust have a written treatment plan that includes short and long\nterm goals. 4.0/  HCFA found that 13 of the 19 records it\nreviewed contained only short and long term goals for staff\nrather than measurable outcome goals for the patients. 4_1/  In\naddition, Pierce lacks adequate activities/training programs that\npromote optimal levels of the physical and psychosocial\nfunctioning.  HCFA surveyors found the majority of residents\n36/  Advocacy Center for Persons with Disabilities, Inc.

This action is properly brought as a  CI~rS action because: \na.  The  class is  so  numerous  that  jOinter of all  members \nis imprac  cable. \nI \nb.  Questions  of  law  and  fact  common  to  the  class \nI \ninclude,  ut  are  not  limited  to,  whether  the  defendtW.ts  have  deprived \nthem of: \n1)  their right to movement; \n2)  their  right  to  Uberty,  free  : rom  unreasonable \nrestraint; \n- 3  -\nI \nIi \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 6     Filed 12/14/1987     Page 4 of 18\n3)  their  right  to  the  least  rest9~tiVe  appropriate \navailable treatment; \n, \n4)  their right to communicate  freely tnd privately  with \nI \npersons 0  tside the facility  and to use telephones in tqe least  restrictive \nI \nmanner; \ni \n5)  their  right  to  associate  with  othe, patients of their \nchoice;  an \nI \n6)  their right of access to the courts,. \nc.  The  named  Plaintiffs'  claims  are  ttpical  of  those  of \nthe  class.  Plaintiffs  are  patients  at  G.  Pierce  Wood!

The  Plaintiffs  will  fairly  and  adeqU~telY  protect  and \nrepresent  the interests of the class  since all  their CIs+s are identical to \nthe  claims  of  the  class  as  a  whole  and  they  have  ~etained  competent \ncounsel to represent them and others similarly situated~ \n- 4  -\n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 6     Filed 12/14/1987     Page 5 of 18\n'I \n'II  \n'I \nI \n1$.

Plaintiffs,  Miller  Frank  Johnson  Llord  Koger  Gail \nJ  J \nBjerkenes,  Sandra  Guinn  and  Daniel  Fennel,  are  patierts  at  G.  Pierce \nWood  Memorial  Hospital  (G. P. W.)  a  state-operated  psy,hiatriC  treatment \nJ \nfacility  housing over 800  people like the plaintiffs. \n17.  Plaintiffs'  ability  to  move  freely  about  q.P.W.'s  grounds \nI \nis  governed by whether they possess  grounds privileges;. \nI \n18 โข  Grounds  privileges  are  initially  granted!  by  a  treatment \nteam  of memtal  health  professionals,  but  they  are  revoked  and \nrout~ely \nreinstated  by  ward  staff  who  possess  no  more  a  high  school \nth~ \ndiploma. \n19.  As  a  result,  Plaintiffs'  rights to freedom lof movement  and \nI' \nI \nliberty  are  being  restricted,  not  for  any  reasons  i~elated  to  their \nI \ntreatment,  but  to  punish  them  for  disobedience,  ~rce  them  into \nfollowing  hospital  rules  or  other  rules  arbitrarily  by  G. P. W.  's \ncre~.ed \nstaff and to serve their convenience. \n20.  The  Plaintiffs  have  been  deprived  of  to  public \n~ccess \n! ' \nI \ntelephones because of there are  no  telephones  on  the  w~ds and because \nI \nof  arbitrary  restrictions,  not  related  to  their  treatmedt,  placed  on  the \nuse of telephones. \nI \n21.  The  Plaintiffs  have  been  deprived  of acc~ss to  the  courts \nbecause  there is  no  law  library  available  to  them  and  rey do  not  have \naccess to attorneys. \n- 5 -\n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 6     Filed 12/14/1987     Page 6 of 18\n'-' \n--./ \nI \nI \ni \n~2' \nI \nAs  to  the  representative  Plaintiff,  Mille  Frank  Johnson, \nover  one  year  ago  his  doctors  determined  that  he  as  ready  to  be \ndischarged from  G.

By  this  action,  plaintiffs  challenge  the  administration \nof  powerful  psychotropic  drugs  to  mental  patients  by  unlicensed \nhospi tal  aides,  denial  of  access  to  the  courts,  violations  of \nprocedural  due  process,  restrictions  on  liberty,  and  denial  of \nadequate  care,  treatment,  training,  recreation,  staffing  and \nnutrition  to  mental  patients  at  G.  Pierce  Wood  Memorial  Hospital \nin  Arcadia,  Florida. \n2.  In  addition,  plaintiffs  challenge  the  placement  of  the \n50  to  125  patients  at  G.P.W.  who  require  treatment  in \nalternative,  less  restrictive  facilities  in  their  home \ncommunities.  The  mental  health  of  these  patients,  whom  the \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 30     Filed 12/14/1988     Page 2 of 13(cid:10)\ndefendants  label  as  ndischarge  ready,\"  deteriorates  significantly \nin  the  unnecessari ly  restrictive  setting  of  hospi tals  such  as \nG.P.W. \nB. \nJURISDICTION \n3.  This  court  has  jurisdiction  over  plaintiffs'  claims \npursuant  to  28  united  States  Code,  Sections  1331,  1343(3), \n2201(a),  2202. \n4.  The  unlawful  practices  and  policies  alleged  below  were \nand  are  now  being  committed  by  the  defendants  against  plaintiffs \nwithin  the  Middle  District of  Florida. \nC. \nPARTIES \n5.  Plaintiffs,  MILLER  FRANK  JOHNSON,  LLOYD  L.  KOGER,  GAIL \nBJERKENES,  SANDRA  GUINN  and  DANIEL  FENNELL  are  invol untar i ly \ncommitted  psychiatric  patients  at  G.  Pierce  Wood  Memorial \nHospital  in  DeSoto  County,  Florida. \n6.  Defendant,  RICHARD  INSLEY,  is  the  Administrator  of  G. \nPierce Wood  Memorial  Hospital,  DeSoto  County,  Florida. \n7.  Defendant,  GREGORY  L.  COLER,  is  the  Secretary  of  the \nFlorida  Department  of  Health  and  Rehabilitative  Services  (HRS). \nHRS,  through  defendant  COLER,  has  a  duty  to  provjde  a \ncomprehensive  statewide  program  of  mental  health  care  and \nexercises  executive  and  administrative  supervision  over  all \nmental  health  facilities  in  the  state  of  Florida,  including  G. \nWood  Memorial  Hospital. \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 30     Filed 12/14/1988     Page 3 of 13(cid:10)\n8.  At  all  times  material  hereto,  defendants  were  acting \nunder  color  of  state  law  and  caused  the  consti tutional \ndeprivations  described  below. \nD. \nCLASS  ALLEGATIONS \n9.  This  action  is  brought  pursuant  to  Fed.R.Civ.P.  23(a} \nand  (b) (2)  since  defendants  have  acted  in  a  manner  generally \napplicable  to  the  class  as  a  whole. {Plaintiffs'  Motion  for  Class \nCertification  dated  March  31,  1988  is  incorporated  by  reference.} \n10.  The  plaintiff  class  consists  of  all  present  and  future \npatients  at  G.  Pierce  Wood  Memorial  Hospital. \n11.  The  class  also  includes  a  sub-class  of  all  present  and \nfuture  patients  at  G.P.W.  who  have  been  medically  determined  to \nbe  \"discharge  ready\"  for  a  period  of  15  days  or  longer  but  who \nhave  not  been  released. \n12.  This  action  is  properly  brought  as  a  class  action \nbecause: \na.  The  class  is  so  numerous  that  joinder  of  all \nmembers  is  impracticable. \nb.  Questions  of  law  and  fact  common  to  the  class \ninclude,  but  are  not  limi ted  to,  whether  the  defendants  have \ndeprived  them  of: \nI}  their  right  to movement; \n2}  their  right  to  liberty,  free  from \nunreasonable  restraint; \n3 }  their  right  to  the  least  restrictive \nappropriate  treatment; \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 30     Filed 12/14-/1-988     Page 4 of 13(cid:10)\n4 )  their  right  to  communicate  freely  and \npr i vate1y  wi th  persons  outside  the  faci 1i ty  and  to  use \nte1ephonesi \n5)  their  right  to  associate  with  other  patients \nof  their  choicei \n6)  their  right  to  access  of  the  courts1  and \n7}  their  right  to  adequate  care,  treatment, \ntraining,  recreation,  staffing and  nutrition. \nc.  The  named  plaintiffs'  claims  are  typical  of  those \nof  the  class.  Plaintiffs  are  patients  at  G.  Pierce  Wood  Memorial \nHospital  who  have  been  denied: \n1}  their  right  to  movement  and  freedom  from \nunreasonable  restraint; \n2 }  their  right  to  the  least  restrictive \nappropriate  available  treatment; \n3)  their  right  to  communicate  freely  and \nprivately with  persons  outside  the  facility  and  to  use  telephones \nin  the  least  restrictive manner; \n4}  their  right  to  liberty,  free  from \nunreasonable  restraint; \n5}  their  right  to  associate  with  other  patients \nof  their  choice; \n6}  their  right  to  access  to  the  courts;  and \n7}  their  right  to  adequate  care,  treatment, \ntraining,  recreation,  staffing  and  nutrition. \n13.  The  named  plaintiffs will  fairly  and  adequately  protect \nand  represent  the  interests  of  the  class  since  their  claims  are \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 30     Filed 12/14/1988     Page 5 of 13(cid:10)\nidentical  to  the  claims  of  the  class  as  a  whole  and  the  subclass \nin  particular,  and  they  have  retained  competent  counsel  to \nrepresent  them  and  others  similarly  situated. \n14.  Defendants  have  acted  or  refused  to  act  on  ground \ngenerally  applicable  to  the  class  as  a  whole. \nE. \nFACTS \n15.  Plaintiffs,  MILLER  FRANK  JOHNSON,  LLOYD  KOGER,  GAIL \nBJERKENES,  SANDRA  GUINN  and  DANIEL  FENNELL  are  patients  at  G. \nPierce  Wood  Memorial  Hospital  (G.P.W.),  a  state-operated \npsychiatric  treatment  facility  housing  over  800  patients  like  the \nplaintiffs,  most  of  whom  were  involuntarily  committed. \n16.  Plaintiffs'  ability  to  move  freely  about  G.P.W.'s \ngrounds  is  governed  by  whether  they  possess  grounds  privileges. \n17.  Grounds  privileges  are  granted  by  a  treatment  team  of \nmental  health  professionals  but  are  routinely  suspended  or \nrevoked  in  order  to  coerce  patients  to  follow  hospital  rules,  to \ndiscipline  patients  for  not  following  hospital  rules,  or  to \ncoerce  them  into  accepting  treatment  which  they  have  the  right  to \nrefuse. \n18.  While  patients  are  verbally  advised  of  some  hospital \nrules  upon  admission,  no  rules  are  posted,  and  no  written  copies \nof  the  rules  are  provided  to  patients.  Other  rules  are \narbitrarily  created  and  enforced  by  staff without  adequate  notice \nto  plaintiffs. \n19.  Grounds  privileges  are  routinely  revoked  or  suspended \nwithout  affording  patients  adequate  notice,  hearing,  written \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 30     Filed 12/14/1988     Page 6 of 13(cid:10)\nexplanation  of  evidence  in  support  of  revocation  or  suspension, \nand  assistance  at  a  hearing. \n20.  The  plaintiffs  have  been  deprived  of  access  to  public \ntelephones  because  there  are  no  telephones  on  the  wards  and \nbecause  of  arbitrary  restrictions,  not  related  to  their \ntreatment,  placed  on  the  use  of  other  telephones. \n21.  The  hospital  does  not  allow  visits  by  anyone  under  age \ntwelve. \n22.  Hospital  rules  prohibit  consensual  hugging  or  kissing, \nin  private or  public,  among  male  and  female  patients  or  visitors. \n23.  Most  patients,  including  the  named  plaintiffs,  are \nindigent. \n24.  There  is  no  adequate  law  library  available  to \nplaintiffs  and  they  do  not  have  adequate  access  to  attorneys. \n25.  The  food  served  to  plaintiffs  is  bland  and  inadequate \nto  satisfy  the  essential  nutritional  needs  of  plaintiffs. \n26.  The  vocational,  recreational,  and  educational \nfacilities  at  G.P.W.  are  grossly  inadequate  to  meet  patient \nneeds. \n27.  The  treatment  plans  for  many  patients  vary  little  if \nany  over  time  reflecting  either  a  lack  of  training  on  the  part  of \nthe  staff  or  as  gross  inadequacy  of  treatment. \n28.  Patient-on-patient  and  patient-on-staff  violence  is \nfrequent  and  results  from  grossly  inadequate  staffing  and \ntraining  of  staff. \n29.  Over  one  year  ago  Plaintiff,  MILLER  FRANK  JOHNSON,  was \ndetermined  to  be  discharge  ready  from  G.P.W. \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 30     Filed 12/14/1988     Page 7 of 13(cid:10)\n30.  Mr.  JOHNSON  has  not  been  discharged,  in  part,  because \nof  a  lack  of  alternative  treatment  services  in  the  communi ties \nserved  by  G.P.W. \n31.  Plaintiff,  LLOYD  KOGER,  was  committed  to  G.P.W.  in \nApril,  1987. \n32.  Mr.  KOGER  is  not  currently  discharge  ready. \n33.  Mr.  KOGER  has  been  sued  by  HRS  for  care  and  maintenance \nbut  was  unable  to  afford  an  attorney. \n34.  Plaintiff,  GAIL  BJERKENES,  was  committed  to  G.P.W.  in \nJanuary,  1986. \n35.  She  was  determined  to  be  discharge  ready  on  August  4, \n1986. \n36.  She  was  not  discharged  due  to  the  lack  of  less \nrestrictive  treatment  facilities. \n37.  Sometime  between  March  5  and  May  20,  1987,  she \nregressed  to  the  point  where  she was  no  longer  discharge  ready. \n38.  She  is  not  considered  to  be  discharge  ready  at  this \ntime. \n39.  Plaintiff,  SANDRA  GUINN,  was  involuntarily  committed  in \nNovember,  1987. \n40.  Ms.  GUINN  is  not  discharge  ready. \n41.  On  at  least  one  occasion,  her  grounds  privileges  were \nrevoked  for  reasons  unrelated  to  treatment. \n42.  Plaintiff,  DANIEL  FENNELL,  was  committed  to  G.P.W.  on \nNovember  16,  1973. \n43.  Mr.  FENNELL  has  been  discharge  ready  since  June  1,1987. \n\n--\n------~ \nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 30     Filed 12/14/1988     Page 8 of 13(cid:10)\n-\n44.  Although  he  has  been  recommended  for  placement  in  a \ngroup  home  or  similar  facility,  the  lack  of  such  facilities  in \nthe  communities  served  by  G.P.W.  has  resulted  in  his  not  being \ndischarged. \nF. \nCLAIMS  FOR  RELIEF \nCount  I  - Denial  of  Less \nRestrictive  Treatment \n45.  Plaintiffs  allege  paragraphs  1  through  44. \n46.  Plaintiffs  MILLER  FRANK  JOHNSON,  LLOYD  L.  KOGER,  GAIL \nBJERKENES,  SANDRA  GUINN,  and  DANIEL  FENNELL  are  psychiatric \npatients  confined  to  G.P.W โขโข  They  are  or  have  been  considered \n\"discharge  ready\"  by  defendants. \n47.  G.P.W.  is  not  designed  to,  nor  does  it  provide  the \nappropriate,  less  restrictive  treatment,  services  and  training \nappropriate  for  discharge  ready  patients. \n48.  Due  to  lack  of  appropriate,  less  restrictive  treatment \nalternatives,  plaintiffs'  care  at  G.P.W.  is  at  best  custodial and \ninadequate  to  maintain  or  develop  the  skills  necessary  to  enable \nplaintiffs  to  function  in  a  less  restrictive  setting. \n49.  By  subjecting  plaintiffs  to  confinement  for  reasons \nother  than  treatment,  and  by  subjecting  them  to  conditions  which \nhave  resulted  and  will  continue  to  result  in  a  loss  of  skills, \ndefendants  have  violated  and  continue  to  violate  plaintiff's \nrights  under  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution. \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 30     Filed 12/14/1988     Page 9 of 13(cid:10)\nCount  II  - Denial  of  Procedural  Due  Process \n50.  Plaintiffs  reallege  paragraphs  1  through  49. \n51.  Unlike  comparable  institutions,  plaintiffs  are  confined \nto  locked  wards.  Plaintiffs'  ability  to  move  about  freely  is \ndependent  on  their  ability  to  obtain  grounds  privileges.  Grounds \nprivileges  are  routinely  revoked  without  opportunity  for  hearing \nand  without  established  criteria,  resulting  in  arbitrary \nrevocation  or  suspension  of  these  privileges. \n52.  By  subjecting  plaintiffs  to  inappropriate  conf inement \nand  revoking  grounds  privileges  without  due  process,  defendants \nhave  denied  plaintiffs  their  rights  under  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution. \nCount  III - Denial  of  Visitation \n53.  Plaintiffs  reallege  paragraphs  1  through  52. \n54.  Plaintiffs  are  confined  on  locked  wards  where  no \ntelephone  facilities  are  available  and  are  thereby  depri ved  of \ntheir  liberty  and  freedom  of  association. \n55.  Defendants  have  a  policy  prohibiting visitors  under  the \nage  of  twelve  years. \n56.  Defendants  have  prohibited  consensual  kissing  and \nhugging  between  male  and  female  patients  and  visi tors.  These \npolicies,  practices  and  procedures  deprive  plainti ffs  of  their \nright  to  liberty  and  the  right  to associate with  others. \n57.  By  these  practices  defendants  have  denied  plaintiffs' \nrights  under  the  First,  Ninth  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  to  the \nUnited  States  Constitution. \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 30     Filed 12/14/1988     Page 10 of 13(cid:10)\n_,I \nCount  IV  - Denial  of  Access  to  Courts \n58.  Plaintiffs  reallege  paragraphs  1  through  57. \n59.  Plaintiffs  are  denied  access  to  an  adequate  law \nlibrary. \n60.  Because  of  their  confinement  at  G.P.W.,  plaintiffs  have \nno  reasonable  access  to  attorneys  to  assist  them  with  domestic \nrelations  problems,  civil  rights  claims,  law  suits  filed  by \ndefendants  against  patients  for  care  and  maintenance,  and  other \nlegal  problems. \n61.  Because  of  their  confinement  at  G.P.W.,  plaintiffs  are \nunable  to  secure  meaningful  access  to  the  courts  wi thout  legal \nassistance. \n62.  By  failing  to  provide  legal  assistance  defendants  have \ndenied  to  plaintiffs'  rights  under  the  First,  Fifth,  Sixth  and \nFourteenth  Amendments  to  the  united  States  Constitution. \nCount  V  - Denial  of  Adequate  Training, \nRecreation,  Staffing and  Nutrition \n63.  Plaintiffs  reallege  paragraphs  1  through  62. \n64.  Due  to  a  lack  of  appropriate  programs,  services  and \ntrained  staff,  plaintiffs'  care  at  G.P.W.  is  inadequate. \n65.  Due  to  a  lack  of  trained  medical  staff,  unlicensed \naides  administer  powerful  psychotropic  drugs  to  patients. \n66.  Due  to  a  lack  of  appropriate  programs  and  trained \nstaff,  plaintiffs  are  not  provided  meaningful  vocational \ntraining. \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 30     Filed 12/14/1988     Page 11 of 13(cid:10)\n67.  Due  to  a  lack  of  appropriate  programs  and  trained \nstaff,  plaintiffs  are  depri ved  of  meaningful  therapeutic \nrecreation. \n68.  Due  to  lack  of  funds  and  staffing,  plaintiffs  are \ndeprived  of  adequate  nutrition. \n69.  Due  to  a  lack  of  staffing,  defendants  are  unable  to \ncontrol  violent  patients,  creating  an  atmosphere  detrimental  to \npatient  recovery. \n70.  By  subjecting  plaintiffs  to  inappropriate  care  and \ntreatment,  defendants  have  violated  and  continue  to  violate \nplaintiffs'  rights  under  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  united \nStates  Constitution. \nG. \nIRREPARABLE  HARM \n71.  Plaintiffs  have  no  plain,  speedy,  or  adequate  remedy  at \nlaw  to  secure  redress.  Unless  restrained  and  enjoined  by  this \nCourt,  defendants  will  continue  to  deny  plaintiffs  their  rights \nunder  the  Constitution  of  the  United  States  as  described  in \nParagraphs  1-64.  By  virtue  of  the  foregoing,  plaintiffs  have \nsuffered  and  will  continue  to  suffer  immediate  and  irreparable \ninjury. \nH. \nPRAYER  FOR  RELIEF  AS  TO  ALL  CLAIMS \nWHEREFORE,  plaintiffs  request  that  this  Court: \na)  Certify  this  action  as  a  class  action; \nb)  Grant  a  jury  trial  on  all  issue  on  which \nplaintiffs  are  entitled as  a  matter  or  right; \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 30     Filed 12/14/1988     Page 12 of 13(cid:10)\nc)  Declare  that  defendants'  confinement  and \nrestrictions  of  patients  violate  their  rights  as  guaranteed  by \nthe  First,  Fifth,  Sixth  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  to  the  United \nStates  Constitution. \nd)  Grant  preliminary  and  permanent  injunctive  relief \nrestraining  and  enjoining  the  defendants,  their  officers,  agents, \nemployees,  attorneys,  and  successors  in  off ice,  and  all  other \npersons  in  active  concert  and  participation  with  them,  from  any \nfurther  confinement  or  restrictions  of  plaintiffs  in  violation  of \ntheir  constitutional  rights1 \ne)  Award  plaintiffs'  costs  and  reasonable  attorneys' \nfees  and  costs  pursuant  to  42  United  States  Code,  Section  19881 \nand \nf)  Grant  any  other  relief  the  Court  deems  equitable. \nRespectfully  submitted, \nEsquire \neen,  Eisenberg  and  Cohen,Lawyers \n1  Clematis  Street,  Suite  200 \nst Palm  Beach,  Florida  33401 \nlephone:  (407)  659-2009 \nKAREN  I.

Subsequent  to  the \ntrial,  the  parties  submitted  proposed  findings  of  fact  and \nconclusions  of  law. \nBACKGROUND \nThis  case  was  originally  filed  on  March  11,  1987  by  a  class \nof  plaintiffs  on  behalf  of  mentally  ill persons  who  are  or  have \nbeen  patients  at  G.  Pierce  Wood  Memorial  Hospital  (\"GPW\"),  a \nstate  psychiatric  hospital  in  Arcadia,  Florida.  In  1989,  the \ncase  was  partially settled by  a  consent  decree,  with  the  Court \nSCAl~l~bU \nJ3'~ \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1319     Filed 06/28/2001     Page 2 of 44(cid:10)\nretaining  jurisdiction over  the  case.  Court  monitors  were \nappointed  to  monitor  compliance  with  the  aforementioned  consent \ndecree.  On  April  2,  1998,  the  United  States  intervened  in this \naction pursuant  to  the  Civil  Rights  of  Institutionalized Persons \nAct  (\"CRIPA\"),  42  U.S.C.  ยง  1997,  et  seq.  In  its complaint  in \nintervention,  the  United  States  alleges  that  conditions  at GPW \nviolate  the  constitutional  rights  of  current  and  former  patients. \n1 \nThe  United  States  also  alleges  that  the  defendants are  violating \nthe  Americans  With  Disabilities Act  (\"ADA\"),  42  U.S.C.  ยงยง  12131-\n12134,  by  failing  to  provide  services  and  programs  to  current  and \nformer  GPW  patients  in  the  most  integrated setting appropriate  to \ntheir needs.  The  United  States  seeks  prospective  injunctive \nrelief  on  behalf  of  these  current  and  former  GPW  patients. \nFINDINGS  OF  FACT \nGeneral: \nG.  Pierce  Wood  Memorial  Hospital  is  a  state psychiatric \nhospital  located  in Arcadia,  Florida.  The  overwhelming  majority \nof  patients  served  at  GPW  have  severe  and  persistent  mental \nillnesses.  At  anyone  time,  the  State of  Florida  serves \n1G.  Pierce Wood  Memorial  Hospital;  The  Florida Department of Health \nand Rehabilitative Services;  Robert  Williams,  in his official capacity; \nthe  State  of  Floridai  Jeb  Bush.  Governor  of  the  State  of  Florida;  Ed \nFeaver,  in  his  official  capacity;  Robert  Constatine,  in  his  official \ncapacitYi  Frances  Gibbons,  in  her  official  capacity;  Lynn  Richard,  in \nher official capacitYi  Don Dixon,  in his official capacitYi  Sue Gray,  in \nher  official  capacity;  and  Martin  Van  Holden,  in  his  capacity  as \nAdministrator  of  G.  Pierce  Wood  Memorial  Hospital. \n2 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1319     Filed 06/28/2001     Page 3 of 44(cid:10)\napproximately  350  persons  at  GPW,  and  over  eighty-five  percent  of \nthose  patients  are  involuntarily  committed  pursuant  to  the  Baker \nAct,  Fla.  Stat.  Chpt.  394.  Under  42  U.S.C.  ยง  12131(2),  current \nand  former  patients  of  GPW  are  individuals  with \n~qualified \ndisabilities\"  as  defined  by  Americans  With  Disabilities  Act \n~he \n(\"ADA\").  The  defendants  in  this  case  are  \"public  entities\"  that \nare  subject  to  the  requirements  of  Title  II  of  the  ADA,  42  U.S.C. \nยง  12131 (1) (B) . \nThere  are  approximately  thirty admissions  to  GPW  each  month, \nand  approximately  the  same  number  of  discharges.  Persons \ndischarged  from  GPW  are  generally  discharged  to  one  of  the  five \nDepartment  of  Children  and  Family  Services  districts  in  GPW's \ncachement  area,  Districts  5,  6,  8,  14  and  15.  These  five \ndistricts  cover  nineteen  counties  in  central  Florida. \nReasonab1e  Care  and  Safety: \nGPW  provides  conditions  of  reasonable  care  and  safety  to  its \npatients.  GPW  takes  reasonable  steps  to  minimize  or  prevent  harm \nto  GPW  patients,  and  the  conditions  of  care  and  safety at  GPW \ncomply  with  accepted  standards  of  professional  judgment. \nSpecifically,  GPW  provides  its patients  with  adequate \nsupervision;  adequate  treatment  for  self-injurious  or  assaultive \nbehavior;  adequate  protection  from  environmental  hazards;  and \nadequate  systems  and  procedures  regarding  the  investigation  of \nand  response  to  adverse  incidents. \n3 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1319     Filed 06/28/2001     Page 4 of 44(cid:10)\nSupervision \nWith  regard  to  adequate  supervision  of  patients  at  the \nHospital,  GPW  bases  its  staffing  on  a  number  of  variables  such  as \nthe  number  of  new  admissions  that  the  hospital  receives,  and  on \ninformation  related  to  needs  that  is  gathered  from  the \nstaffi~g \nmedical  staff  by  the  clinical  director.  Tr.  8/24,  29.4-30.8.2 \nAs  there  are  no  national  standards  that  set  guidelines  for \npsychiatric  staffing,  GPW  bases  its staffing decisions  on \ninstitutional  specific  factors.  Id.  GPW  has  fourteen  full-time \npsychiatric  positions,  and  a  fifteenth  position  that  primarily \ninvolves  supervisory  and  administrative  duties.  Tr.  8/30, \n115.17-24.  Additionally,  the  hospital  has  six  general  care \nservice  physicians.  Tr.  8/30,  115.25-116.5.  Similarly,  nurses  at \nGPW  are  provided  pursuant  to a  formal  for  Providing  Nursing \n~Plan \nCare\"  which  is  based  on  nurse  staffing  levels.  Tr.  8/30, \n~ideal\" \n37,  39,  and  59.  Consistent  with  the  American  Nurses' \nAssociation's  standards,  the  nurse  staffing program  at  GPW  is \nbased  on  patient  need  rather  than  on  hours  per  patient  per  day. \nTr.  8/30,  45-46.  While  more  nurses  at  GPW  would  be  ideal,  the \nhospital  is  still able  to meet  the  nursing  care  needs  of  its \npatients  with  the  nursing  staff  that  is  currently provided.  Tr. \n8/30,  59.  As  to  semi-professional  and/or  non-professional  staff \nReferences  to trial transcripts are given in the  following  format: \n2\n\"Tr.  month/day,  page.line-page.line\". \n4 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1319     Filed 06/28/2001     Page 5 of 44(cid:10)\nat  the  hospital,  GPW  provides  registered  nurse  supervision  of  all \n\"LPN\"  nurses  on  duty.  Tr.  9/5,  41.  Furthermore,  the  hospital \nhas  systems  in  place  to monitor  direct  staff and  nursing \ndeficiencies,  to  include  a  corrective  action  plan  if staffing \ndeficiencies  are  found.  Tr.  9/5,  19-24,  61-62. \nTreatment  for  Self-Injurious  or Assaultive Behavior \nWith  regard  to  treatment  for  self-injurious  or  assaultive \npatient  behavior,  GPW  has  a  system  in  place  where  such  behavior \nis  noted  on  patient  records;  reviewed  by  treatment  teams  as  to \npatient  needs  and  progress;  and  modified  depending  on  patient \nprogress,  team  input,  and  response  to  precaution  levels.  Tr. \n8/23,  187.10-213.12;  Exhibit  0-122  at  25-26.  GPW  also  has  an \nindependent  mortality  review  process  by  which  fatal  incidents  at \nthe  hospital  are  sometimes  reviewed  by  the  University  of  South \nFlorida  Department  of  Psychiatry  & Behavioral  Medicine.  Exhibit \n0-65;  Tr.  8/30,  133.17-22.  Patients  who  have  indications  and/or \nhistories  of  self-injurious  or  assaultive  behavior  are  placed  on \nappropriate  precautionary  levels  and  participate  in  specific \ntreatments  designed  to  decrease  their  risk  of  harm. \nSee,~, \nCase  of  Tonya  W.,  Exhibit  0-122  at  48-50;  Tr.  8/24.  10.3-13.11; \nCase  of  Paul  B.,  Exhibit  0-122  at  25-26;  Tr.  8/23,  187.10-213.12. \nFurther,  the  hospital  has  a  system  in  place  whereby  a  peer  review \ncommittee  meets  after  a  death  occurs  to  evaluate  and  make \nrecommendations  as  to  what  steps,  if any,  need  to  be  taken  to \n5 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1319     Filed 06/28/2001     Page 6 of 44(cid:10)\nensure  the  safety  of  patients  at  the  hospital.  Tr.  8/30,  123.9-\n124.9,  Case  of  Rodney  S.,  DOJ  Exhibit  182A  at  6-7  (noting  post \nincident  recommendations  made  by  mortality  review  committee) . \nWith  mentally  ill patients  like  those  at  GPW,  there  is  often \nno  real  way  to  predict  who  will  commit  suicide  or  injure \nthemselves  due  to  the  fact  that  such  behavior  is  often  an \nimpulsive  event  that  is  based  on  unidentifiable  factors.  Exhibit \nD-24;  Tr.  8/31,  148.2-151.15,  154.24-155.10.  However,  in  cases \nwhere  patients  do  show  identifiable  signs  of  self-injurious \nbehavior,  the  hospital  has  treatment  teams  that  meet  with  those \npatients  to  evaluate  their  c~ndition.  Case  of  Leon  G.,  Tr.  8/30, \n204.6-205.19.  Once  a  patient's  condition  is \nself-i~jurious \nevaluated,  status  notes  are  nade  and  hospital  staff members  take \naction  in  accordance  with  the  patient's  treatment  plan.  Id. \nFurther,  in  cases  where  patients  exhibit  signs  of  immediate  harm \nto  themselves  or  others,  they  are  placed  on \n~one-on-one\" \nprecautions,  are  immediately  seen  by  a  doctor,  and  are  taken  out \nof  restraints  (if  needed)  as  soon  as  possible.  Tr.  8/24,  87.10-\n90.14;  91.1-5. \nProtection  from  Environmental  Hazards \nAs  a  general  observation,  the  rate  of  patient  injuries  at \nGPW  is  less  than  the  national  average  as  measured  in  national \nsurveys  of  other  large  state psychiatric  hospitals.  Tr.  8/31, \n160.12-164.3.  During  the  relevant  time  periods  in  this matter, \n6 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1319     Filed 06/28/2001     Page 7 of 44(cid:10)\nthe  number  of  serious  injuries  to  patients  from  environmental \nhazards  was  relatively  low  and  there  were  no  patterns  of \nnegligence  present.  Tr.  8/28,  156.12-159.8;  Exhibit  0-120  at  62-\n64.  As  to  \"contraband\"  at  the  hospital  (such  as  drugs  or \nweapons),  staff at  the  hospital  are  generally  not  allowed  to \nsearch  patients,  but  searches  are  conducted  when  there  is \nprobable  cause  and  in  emergercy  circumstances.  Tr.  9/5,  165.19-\n22;  167.8-169.6.  Most  contr  band  found  at  the  hospital,  however, \nis  brought  in  by  visitors,  and  the  staff at  the  hospital  calls \nthe  local  sheriff's  department  if they  suspect  that  a  visitor  has \nbrought  in  illegal  contraband.  Tr.  9/5,  170.17-171.10.  As  to \nsubjective  contraband  (such  as  shoelaces,  belts,  towels,  etc.), \nrestrictions  are  placed  on  patients  on  a  case-by-case  basis.  The \nhospital's  \"subjective  contraband\"  policy  attempts  to  maintain  as \nmuch  of  a  \"home-like\"  environment  as  possible.  Tr.  9/6,  117.7-\n119.18. \nAs  to  structural  safety  hazards  at  the  hospital  (such  as \ndoorknobs,  plumbing  fixtures,  etc.),  the  hospital  evaluates \nsafety  through  an  interaction  between  a  specific  environment  and \nthe  patients  in  that  environment  based  on  level  of  supervision \nand  level  of  privileges  in  a  particular  location.  Tr.  8/28, \n163.8-164.18.  While  it is  impossible  to  make  any  environment \ncompletely  free  of  hazards  and  accidents  have  occurred  due  to \nenvironmental  hazards,  GPW  acts  to  remove  suicide  and  safety \n7 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1319     Filed 06/28/2001     Page 8 of 44(cid:10)\nhazards  while  attempting  to  balance  the  comfort,  self-esteem,  and \nself-respect  of  its patients.  Tr.  8/30,  57.  Pursuant  to  a \nreview  by  the  hospital's  engineering  department,  GPW  has  enacted \nan  \"action  plan\"  for  the  removal  of  environmental  hazards.  Tr. \n8/8,  155.14-157.14.  In  accordance  with  its  action  plan,  the \nhospital  has  removed  environmental  hazards  such  as  door  knobs, \nceiling  grids,  and  plumbing  fixtures,  and  has  replaced  glass \nfixtures  with  lexon  plexi-glass.  Tr.  9/5,  181.18-183.24. \nInvestigation  and  Respomse  to  Adverse  Incidents \nAt  GPW,  reports  of  incidents  are  recorded  on  \"Resident \nOccurrence  Report\"  forms  (\"ROR\").  While  many  hospitals  do  not \nrecord  commonplace  events  (such  as  cursing,  shouting,  or  pacing) \non  formal  reports,  GPW  \"over-reports\"  incidents  in  that  it has  a \npolicy  of  recording  common  events  that  would  not  be  recorded \nelsewhere.  Tr.  9/5,  244.10-246.4;  Tr.  9/6,  93.14-24.  Many  of \nthe  events  reported  by  GPW  are  considered  normal  or  trivial  at \nother  hospitals.  Tr.  8/28,  168.3-18.  However,  GPW's  reporting \npolicy  is  based  on  the  premise  that  an  excess  of  information  is \nbetter  than  not  getting  enough  information.  Tr.  9/6,  92.24-\n93.24.  This  policy  results  in  a  large  number  of  ROR's,  many  of \nwhich  are  concerning  minor  incidents.  See  ide  However,  in  some \nROR's  filed  during  the  times  relevant  to  this  action,  certain \npatients  at  the  hospital  made  serious  allegations  of  rape  and \nsexual  assault.  Serious  incident  reports  are  investigated by  the \n8 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1319     Filed 06/28/2001     Page 9 of 44(cid:10)\nhospital,  and  with  regard  to  the  aforementioned  allegations  of \nrape  and  sexual  assault,  investigations  found  that \npos~-report \nthey  were  unsubstantiatedยท.  There  have  been  no  substantiated \nincidents  of  rape  or  sexual  assault  at  the  hospital.  Tr.  9/6, \n66.2-15;  99.8-100.14;  Tr.  9/5,  173.25-174.21;  216.23-217.17. \nSimilarly,  while  some  ROR's  at  the  hospital  contain  patient \nallegations  of  other  serious  activity or  violations  (such  as \nillegal  drug  use),  few  of  those  allegations  turned  out  to  be \nsubstantiated.  Tr.  9/6,  116.4-22.  Additionally,  many  ROR's \nwhich  contain  incidents  such  as  patient  assaults  or  accidents  are \nbased  on  events  where  patients  were  not  injured  (such  as  verbal \nassaults  by  patients).  Tr.  9/6,  105.16-108.11. \nThe  hospital  has  in  place  programs  to  assure  proper  response \nto  and  investigations  of  adverse  incidents.  These  programs \ninclude  security  investigations,  internal  hospital \ninvestigations,  a  patient  grievance  process,  high  risk  reviews, \nretrospective  case  reviews,  and  mortality  reviews.  Tr.  9/5, \n164.10-18;  9/6,  35-64.  Information  gathered  from  these  programs \nis  disseminated  to  treatment  teams  and  staff members  for \nassessments  and  modifications.  Tr.  9/6,  114.20-115.2,  111.7-19. \nAll  \"significant  reportable  events\"  (as  that  term  is  defined  by \nthe  State)  are  reported  to  State  officials pursuant  to  a  formal \n\"SRE\"  reporting  policy.  Tr.  9/6,  91.11-92.2;  94.8-95.3. \nAdditionally,  hospital  investigators  give  priority  to  the \n9 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1319     Filed 06/28/2001     Page 10 of 44(cid:10)\ninvestigation  of  serious  incident  reports  according  to  a \nstandardized  set  of  criteria  set  forth  by  the  hospital.  Tr.  9/6, \n39.1-40.20;  9/6,  38.12-25.  Such  investigations  are  subjected  to \nsupervisory  review  and  are  often  supplemented  with  follow-up \ninvestigations.  Tr.  9/6,  39.1-40.20. \nIn  addition  to  the  procedures  discussed  above,  Florida's \nDepartment  of  Children  and  Family  Services  operates  an \ninvestigative  unit  known  as  Adult  Protective  Services  which \noperates  an  hotline\"  which  GPW  patients  have  access  to. \n~abuse \nTr.  9/6,  42.21-44.23.  Hospital  employees  also  have  access  to  the \nhotline  and  are  required  to  immediately  report  any  instances  of \nabuse  that  they  observe.  Id.  Furthermore,  the  hospital's \nresident  advocate  and  resident  advocate  attorney,  along  with  the \nhospital  administrator,  are  involved  in  the  patient  grievance \nprocess  to  assure  that  allegations  of  abuse  and  neglect  are \ninvestigated  on  a  multi-level  basis.  Tr.  9/6,  50.22-54.7.  The \nhospital  also  has  a  Quality  Management/Risk  Management  Department \nthat  identifies  patterns  and  trends  at  the  hospital  based  on \npatient  and  staff  incidents.  Tr.  9/6,  57.12-59.2;  58.10-59.2. \nAs  noted  above,  the  hospital  also  has  a  mortality  review  process \nby  which  incidents  of  death  are  sometimes  reviewed  by  the \nUniversity  of  South  Florida  to  determine  whether  there  was \nappropriate  care  and  conduct.  Exhibit  0-65. \n10 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1319     Filed 06/28/2001     Page 11 of 44(cid:10)\nStandard  of Professional  Care \nWith  respect  to  reasonab  e  care  and  safety  of  patients,  GPW \ntakes  reasonable  steps  to min'mize  or  prevent  harm  to  GPW \npatients,  and  the  conditions  of  care  and  safety  at  GPW  comply \nwith  accepted  standards  of  professional  judgment.  Accepted \nstandards  of  professional  judgment  in  the  field  of  psychiatry \nshould  be  based  upon  training,  experience,  judgment,  and  current \nt~e \npeer  reviewed  literature  in  field.  Tr.  8/23,  39.4-40.15. \nH~CA \nWhile  organizations  such  as  and  JCAHO  do  set  some  standards \nfor  psychiatric  hospitals,  those  standards  exceed  generally \naccepted  professional  standards  of  care  for  patients  at  hospitals \nlike  GPW.  Tr.  8/23,  36.6-36.9,  37.23-24.  Thus,  the  fact  that  a \nhospital  or  part  of  a  hospital  has  lost  or  does  not  have  HFCA \nand/or  JCAHO  accreditation  does  not  necessarily mean  that \naccepted  professional  standards  of  care  are  not  being  utilized. \nSee  id.  At  GPW,  the  treatment  of  self-injurious  behavior  (Tr. \n8/23,  47.12-52.9);  the  supervision  and  care  of  patients  (Tr. \n8/30,  133.17-22;  Tr.  9/5,  59-60;  Tr.  8/30,  81-83);  the  prevention \nof  harm  from  environmental  hazards  (Tr.  8/28,  164.19-24);  and  the \nreporting  and  investigation  of  adverse  incidents  (Tr.  9/6,  35-64) \nall  comply  with  accepted  standards  of  professional  judgment. \nTreatment: \nPatients  at  GPW  are  provided  adequate  treatment  that \ncomplies  with  accepted  professional  judgment,  practice,  and \n11 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1319     Filed 06/28/2001     Page 12 of 44(cid:10)\nstandards.  Specifically,  patient  assessment,  treatment  planning, \nprovision  of  treatment,  and  discharge  planning  are  adequate  and \nacceptable. \nPatient  Assessment \nAs  a  general  guideline  for  patient  assessment,  GPW  has \ndeveloped  a  model  assessment  form  which  is  found  in  its \nPsychology  Department  Manual.  Tr.  8/31,  87.1-89.25.  In  1996, \nDr.  Lyon,  the  Director  of  Psychology,  developed  a  procedure  to \nimplement  detailed psychological  reports  in  conjunction  with  the \nhospital's  protocol  monitoring  department.  Tr.  8/31,  89.13-\n91.11.  In  addition  to  the  hospital's  protocol  audit  of \nassessment  records,  Dr.  Lyon  developed  a  system  of  qualitative \nreview  of  assessments  when  he  took  over  as  Director  of  Psychology \nin  1996.  Tr.  8/31,  99.17-100.7;  207.6-15.  Under  this  review \nprocess,  a  small  number  of  initial  patient  assessments  were  found \nto  be  \"poor\"  due  to  the  fact  that  the  assessment  sheets  were  done \nin  a  \"fill-in-the-blanks\"  tY1e  manner.  Tr.  8/31,  94.17-96.7. \nHowever,  a  vast  majority  of  lhe  assessment  forms  reviewed  at  the \nhospital  were  accurate  in  their  observations  and  ranged  from \n\"adequate\"  to  \"quite  good.\"  Tr.  8/25,  88.19-90.3.  With  regard \nto  poor  assessments,  the  hospital  implemented  corrective  action \nwhich  included  revising  its  Psychology  Manual.  Tr.  8/31,  96.10-\n98.20.  Further,  in  July  of  1999,  the  hospital  prepared  a \nresearch  paper  which  compared  Positive  and  Negative  Syndrome \n12 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1319     Filed 06/28/2001     Page 13 of 44(cid:10)\nScale  (\"PANSS\")3  test  scores  with  results  from  national  and \ninternational  studies,  as  well  as  results  from  other  Florida \nstate  hospitals.  Exhibit  0-26.  That  research  study  showed  that \nGPW  was  properly  performing  the  PANSS  test  in  conjunction  with \nits assessment  of  patients.  Tr.  8/31,  139.13-24. \nTreatment  Planning \nTreatment  planning  at  GPW  iS,a  process  that  encompasses  a \npatient's  entire  chart,  a  specific  treatment  plan,  and  the \nspecific  knowledge  of  treating  professionals.  Tr.  8/23,  107.12-\n18.  Treatment  planning  for  a  patient  is  also  a  fluid  concept  in \nthat  it may  change  based  on  progress,  specific  needs,  and \nspecific  behavior.  Tr.  8/23,  187.10-213.12.  Treatment  plans  at \nthe  hospital  are  implemented  with  the  goal  of  reducing \ninappropriate  behavior  and  symptoms  and  preparing  the  patient  for \ndischarge.  Tr.  8/23,  138.24-144.6.  Treatment  planning  at  GPW \nincludes,  inter  alia,  therapeutic  activities,  OBT,  and  individual \npsychotherapy.  Tr.  8/24,  10.3-13.11.  Through  specific \nindividual  treatment  plans,  patient  charts,  and  progress  notes, \ntreatment  plans  at  GPW  are  informative  as  to  what  type  of \ntreatment  a  patient  is  receiving,  to  include  what  type  of \nmedication,  if any,  a  patient  is  taking.  Tr.  8/24,  140.2-7; \n140.11-15;  Exhibit  0-135.  Frequent  patient  progress  notes  serve \n3The  PANNS  rating scale is a  type of assessment test that references \na  normative  sample  of  schizophrenic patients  as  a  basis  for  comparison. \nTr.  8/31,  110.22-111.14. \n13 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1319     Filed 06/28/2001     Page 14 of 44(cid:10)\nto  inform  treatment  prOfeSSio!alS  of  changes  in  a  patient's \ntreatment  and  medication  regi  e.  Tr.  8/24,  147.1-18;  149.20-25; \n150.3-17.  Further,  treatment  team meetings  with  patients  are \nmade  part  of  treatment  planning  at  GPW.  Exhibit  0-123  at  8-16. \nIn  summary,  treatment  planning  at  GPW  consists  of  individualized \ntreatment  regimes,  specific  interventions,  individual \npsychotherapy,  group  psychotherapy,  rehabilitation,  and \nindividual  psychopharmacologic  interventions.  Tr.  8/24,  .93.16-\n22. \nProvision  of Treatment \nThe  provision  of  psychological  treatment  at  GPW  is  multi-\nfaceted.  One  method  of  treatment  is  \"SIP  meetings\"  or  treatment \nteam  meetings  wherein  patients  and  treatment  team members  discuss \npast  management  and  treatment  issues.  Tr.  8/24,  78.5-16.  During \ntreatment  team  meetings,  team members  at  GPW  are  aware  of  the \nclinical  histories  of  the  participating patients,  and  discussions \nduring  these  meetings  are  thoughtful  and  clinically  informed. \nExhibit  0-123  at  60.  Patients  at  GPW  are  encouraged  to  engage  in \nactive  treatment  and  psychosocial  rehabilitation.  Tr.  8/28, \n72.25-79.22.  Additionally,  a  significant  number  of  staff members \nat  GPW  are  trained  and/or  certified in  substance  abuse  issues  to \nprovide  treatment  and  support  to  patients  with  substance  abuse \nproblems.  Tr.  8/31,  103.4-104.8. \n14 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1319     Filed 06/28/2001     Page 15 of 44(cid:10)\nPsychosocial  rehabilitation  at  GPW  is  based  on  non-medical \ninterventions  designed  to  foster  the  rehabilitation  of \npsychiatric  patients  and  includes  family  therapy,  skills \ntraining,  vocational  rehabilitation,  and  psychotherapy.  Tr. \n8/25,  76.2-19.  While  psychotherapy  is  one  of  the  most  common \nforms  of  psychosocial  rehabilitation,  many  techniques  are  used  in \nthe  field,  and  there  are  no  widely  accepted  professional \nstandards  in  psychosocial  rehabilitation.  Tr.  8/25,  79.5-80.21; \nTr.  8/29,  137.24-140.24.  At  GPW,  treatment  professionals  rely  on \ntheir  training  and  experience  to  choose  the  best  form  of \npsychosocial  rehabilitation  that  is most  likely  to  help \nindividual  patients.  Tr.  8/25,  78.2-22.  One  particular model  of \npsychosocial  rehabilitation  used  by  GPW  in  an  adapted  form  is  a \n\"role  recovery\"  model,  which  represents  one  of  many \nprofessionally  acceptable  treatment  methods  in  the  field.  Tr. \n8/25,  83.19-85.5;  Tr.  8/29,  236.1-237.16.  GPW  has  a  goal  of \ntwenty  hours  per  week  of  therapeutic  interventions,  and  patient \ncontacts  are  made  each  day  in  various  forms  and  durations. \nExhibit  0-47;  Tr.  8/29,  242.14-243.12;  245.6-20;  Exhibit  0-114  at \n11-12.  Additionally,  GPW  has  therapeutic  programs  and  services \navailable  to  patients  such  as  on  and  off-ward  training/skills \nprograms;  recreation  and  leisure  activities;  and  grounds  where \npatients  are  free  to  walk.  Tr.  8/25,  124.1-125.14;  126.7-128.2; \nExhibit  0-114  at  14-20.  Finally,  while  there  are  no  specific \n15 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1319     Filed 06/28/2001     Page 16 of 44(cid:10)\nprograms  at  the  hospital  that  are  exclusively  for  Spanish \nspeaking  patients,  GPW  has  bi-lingual  and  multi-lingual  staff \nmembers  (who  are  fluent  in  Spanish  and  other  languages)  that  help \nfacilitate  communication  with  non-English  speaking  patients.  Tr. \n8/31,  218.10-17. \nDischarge  Planning \nAccording  to  GPW  policy,  a  patient's  individual  treatment \nplan  is  developed  shortly  after  admission,  and  this  plan  or  \"SIP\" \nincludes  discharge  planning.  DOJ  Exhibit  148  at  2.  Discharge \nplanning  is  reviewed  and  modified  during  \"SIP  updates\"  or \nmodifications,  and  community  case  managers  often  participate  in \nSIP  meetings  to  discuss  discharge  planning.  Tr.  9/8,  96.17-98.8. \nFurthermore,  patient  discharge  skills  (such  as  bathing,  taking \nmedication,  etc.)  are  annotated  on  discharge  planning  forms  such \nas  the  \"7001  Form\"  and  the  \"Interdisciplinary Discharge  Summary\" \nform.  Tr.  9/8,83.17-85.23.  As  an  additional  element  of \ndischarge  planning,  the  hospital  attempts  to  involve  family \nmembers  in  the  patient  discharge  process  for  support  and  patient \nneeds.  Tr.  9/8,  85.25-87.18. \nWhile  evidence  was  presented  at  trial  that  some  patients' \ndischarge  plans  did  not  comply  with  hospital  policy,  discharge \nplanning  at  GPW  as  a  whole  is  adequate  and  acceptable.  Tr.  9/8, \n81.25-82.21;  178.9-18.  Often,  GPW's  plan  for  discharge  and \nplacement  is  limited  due  to  the  fact  that  patients  who  are  no \n16 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1319     Filed 06/28/2001     Page 17 of 44(cid:10)\nlonger  involuntarily  committed  sometimes  choose  not  to  cooperate \nwith  the  hospital.  Tr.  9/8,  93.24-96.15.  However,  community \ncase  managers  are  actively  involved  at  the  hospital  in  both \ndischarge  planning  and  discharge  follow-up.  Tr.  9/8,  69.2-70.25; \nExhibit  D-117  at  11-13.  Community  case  managers  that  work  with \nGPW  as  treatment  team members  are  knowledgeable  about  placement, \nservice  options,  and  patients  in  their  area.  Tr.  9/8,  81.25-\n82.9. \nStandard  of Professional  Care \nAs  noted  above,  accepted  standards  and  judgments  in  the \nfield  of  psychiatry  should  be  based  upon  training,  experience, \njudgment,  and  current  peer  reviewed  literature  in  the  field.  Tr. \n8/23,  39.4-40.15.  Also  as  noted  above,  there  are  no  widely \naccepted  professional  standards  in  psychosocial  rehabilitation. \nTr.  8/25,  79.5-80.21;  Tr.  8/29,  137.24-140.24.  Patient \nassessment  (Tr.  8/25,  89.13-91.11),  treatment  planning  (Tr.  8/24, \n93.2-93.7),  provision  of  treatment  (Tr.  8/24,  78.5-16;  Tr.  8/25, \n101.18-25;  103.8-15;,  and  discharge  planning  (Tr.  9/8,  81.25-\n82.21;  178.9-18)  are  adequate  and  acceptable;  and  patients  at  GPW \nare  provided  adequate  treatment  that  complies  with  accepted \nprofessional  judgment,  practice,  and  standards. \nCommunity  Services: \nCurrent  and  former  GPW  patients  are  provided  adequate \ncommunity  mental  health  services  to  meet  their  assessed \n17 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1319     Filed 06/28/2001     Page 18 of 44(cid:10)\nfunctional  and  clinical  needs  in  an  integrated  setting  that  is \nappropriate  to  those  needs. \nPlacement  in  Community  Settings \nThe  defendants  in  this  tter are  placing  persons  with \nmental  disabilities  in  commun'ty  settings  rather  than  in \ninstitutions  when  the  relevan  treatment  professionals  have \ndetermined  that  community  placement  is  appropriate;  the  transfer \nfrom  institutional  care  to  a  less  restrictive  setting  is  not \nopposed  by  the  affected  individual;  and  the  placement  can  be \nreasonably  accommodated,  taking  into  account  the  resources \navailable  to  the  State  and  the  needs  of  others  with  disabilities. \nUpon  discharge  from  GPW,  patients  are  provided  several \ncommunity  placement  options,  (such  as  family  homes,  private \napartments,  assisted  living  facilities,  etc.),  according  to  their \nneeds  and  abilities.  Tr.  8/15,  58.3-5;  59.1-6;  Tr.  9/8,  75.19-\n76.5.  While  many  factors  influence  the  stability of  community \ntenure  for  mentally  ill patients  (such  as  fluctuations  in  mental \ncondition,  resources,  and  need  for  crisis  care),  patients \ndischarged  from  GPW  are  usually  successful  in  remaining  in \ncommunity  settings.  Tr.  8/10,  83.5-84.5;  Tr.  8/15,  84.3-85.6. \nOnce  patients  are  discharged  into  community  settings,  GPW \ncontinues  to  contact  and  follow-up  with  those  patients  pursuant \nto  individual  discharge  plans.  Tr.  8/15,  52.24-53.7.  In  June  of \n1999,  GPW  initiated  a  community  outreach  program  based  on  a \n18 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1319     Filed 06/28/2001     Page 19 of 44(cid:10)\n\"community  ACT  team\"  model.  Tr.  9/5,  146.1-148.25.  That \ncommunity  outreach  program  is designed  to  augment  the  discharge \nprocess  by  providing  additioral  support  and  services  to  patients \nin  community  settings.  Tr.  9/5,  148.17-149.14.  Once  patients \nare  discharged  into  community  settings  from  the  hospital,  they \nare  provided  with  sufficient  \"staff-to-client\"  support  to  meet \ntheir  needs.  Tr.  9/8,  Further,  the  community  settings \n42.7-~4. \nin  which  patients  are  placed  are  integrated and  less  restrictive \nthan  a  hospital  or  institutional  setting.  Tr.  8/17,  183.19-22. \nIn  some  cases,  patients  at  GPW  are  discharged  into  assisted \nliving  facilities  or  \"ALF's.\"  ALF's  are  privately owned  and \noperated  facilities  that  provide  living  assistance  to  those  in \nneed  of  it.  Tr.  8/15,  55.13-56.8.  While  there  was  evidence  of \npoorly  operated ALF's,  assisted  living  facilities  are  perfectly \nacceptable  as  discharge  options  for  some  patients.  Only  a  small \npercentage  of  patients  from  GPW  are  actually discharged  into \nALF's.  DOJ  Exhibit  212,  Appendix  Di  DOJ  Exhibit  333.  Typically, \nover  half  of  the  patients  at  GPW  are  discharged  into  independent \nliving  or  family  homes,  and  1nother  twenty  percent  of  patients \nare  discharged  into  \"group  llving  situations\"  sponsored  by \ncommunity  health  providers.  Id. \nUnnecessary  Isolation \nThe  defendants'  mental  health  program,  as  administered,  does \nnot  result  in  unnecessary  isolation  of  patients  into  segregated \n19 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1319     Filed 06/28/2001     Page 20 of 44(cid:10)\nsettings.  Consistent  with  the  intent  of  Florida's  \"Mental  Health \nAct\",  the  defendants  in  this matter  strive  to  serve  patients  with \nthe  least  restrictive  interve  tions  based  on  the  individual  needs \nof  each  patient,  within  the  s  ope  of  available  services.

DOJ  Exhibit \n71;  Exhibit  D-100  at  i-iii. \nArray  and  Intensity  of Community  Services \nThe  defendants  are  providing  an  appropriate  array  and \nintensity  of  community  servic  s.  The  residential  options \navailable  to  patients  dischar  ed  from  GPW  are  logistically \nadequate  due  to  the  fact  that  few,  if any,  of  them  operate  at \nfull  capacity.  Tr.  9/8,  45.2  18.  As  a  whole,  the  defendants \nprovide  a  broad  array  of  co  nity  services  such  as  emergency \nstabilization  treatment;  ification  services;  inpatient \nservices;  residential  services;  case  management  services;  and \ncrisis  intervention  services.  Tr.  9/7,  21.15-23.7;  Tr.  9/8, \n45.19-46.23;  178.20-180.10.

Summary  of  the  Law \n(A).  Constitutional  Claims \nu.s. \nIn  Youngberg  v.  Romeo,  457  307  (1982),  the  United \nStates  Supreme  Court  addressed  the  question  of  whether  a  person \nwho  is  involuntarily  committed  to  a  state  institution  for  the \nmentally  retarded  has  substantive  rights  under  the  Due  Process \nClause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  (1)  safe  conditions  of \nconfinement;  (2)  freedom  from  bodily  restraints;  and  (3)  training \nor  habilitation.  See  Youngberg,  457  U.S.  at  309.  Turning  first \nto  the  issue  of  safe  conditions  of  confinement,  the  Court  in \n23 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1319     Filed 06/28/2001     Page 24 of 44(cid:10)\ni \nYoungberg  found  that  an  inst~tutionalized patient  has  an  obvious \nright  to  adequate  food,  shelter,  clothing,  and  medical  care.  See \nid.  at  315.  Recognizing  that  a  person's  right  to  personal \nsecurity  is  a  \"historic  liberty interest\",  the  Court  found  that \nan  institutionalized person  also  has  a  substantive  due  process \nright  to  safe  conditions  of  confinement.  See  id.  Similar  to  a \npatient's  right  to  safe  conditions  of  confinement,  the  Court  in \nYoungberg  also  found  that  freedom  from  bodily  restraint  is \nrecognized  as  a  core  liberty! protected by  the  Due  Process  Clause. \nI \nI \nIn  light  of  the  fact  that  thf  right  to  be  free  from  bodily \nI \nrestraints  survives  criminal! conviction  and  incarceration,  the \nI \nI \ncourt  found  that  it must  als~ survive  involuntary  commitment. \ni \nWith  the  aforementioned  rights  established,  the  Court  in \nI \nI \nYoungberg  went  on  to  addressithe  question  of  whether  an \nI \ninvoluntarily  committed  patient  has  a  constitutional  right  to \nminimally  adequate  training  or  habilitation4 In  addressing  this \nโข \nquestion,  the  Court  began  with  the  general  principle  that  a  state \nis  under  no  constitutional  dyty  to  provide  substantive  services \ni \nto  those  within  its  border.  ISee  id.  at  317.  However,  when  a \nperson  is  institutionalized  nd  wholly  dependant  on  the  state, \nthe  Court  recognized  that  a  uty  to  provide  certain  services  and \ncare  does  exist.  See  id.

With  these \n~he \nobligations  stated,  however,  Court  went  on  to  note  that  the \nwhethe~ \nquestion  is  not  simply  a  liberty  interest  has  been \ninfringed,  but  whether  the  extent  or  nature  of  the  restraint  or \nlack  of  safety  is  such  as  to  due  process.  Thus,  in \n~iolate \n! \ndetermining  whether  or  not  a  violation  has  taken \n~onstitutional \nplace,  a  court  must  whether  a  state  exercised \ndetermin~ \nprofessional  judgment  in  a  deicision  related  to  constitutionally \nprotected  rights.  See  id.  322.  In  evaluating  professional \na~ \njudgment,  a  court  must  show  ~eference to  the  judgment  of \nqualified  professionals,  and ii decisions  made  by  such  professionals \nI \n~ \nare  presumptively  valid.  at  323.  \"It is  not  appropriate \nfor  the  courts  to  specify  of  several  professionally \nwh~ch \nI \nacceptable  choices  should  ha~e been  made.\"  Id.  at  321.  Rather, \nI \n\"[lJiability may  be  imposed  9nlY  when  [aJ  decision  by  [aJ \nsUbst~ntial \nprofessional  is  such  a  departure  from  accepted \nI \n! \nprofessional  judgment,  or  standards  as  to  demonstrate \npract~ce, \nthat  the  person  responsible  1I ctually did  not  base  the  decision  on \nsuch  a  judgment.\"  Id.  at  32~. \n,  Id  .  . \nIn  summary,  the  Court  s  eC1Slon  in  Youngberg  is  as  follows: \nI \nI \n25 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1319     Filed 06/28/2001     Page 26 of 44(cid:10)\n1.

In  determining  whe~her a  state  has  met  its obligations \nunder  the  constitu~ion,  decisions  made  by  appropriate \nprofessionals  are  to  a  presumption  of \n~ntitled \ncorrectness,  and  may  be  imposed  only  when  a \nl~ability \ndecision  by  a  professional  is  such  a  substantial \ndeparture  from  acc~pted professional  judgment, \npractice,  or  stand4rds  as  to  demonstrate  that  the \nperson  responsible 'actually  did  not  base  the  decision \non  such  a  judgmentJ  See  id .. \n, \n, \n, \nPrior  to  the  Supreme  CoJrt's  decision  in  Youngberg,  the \nI \nformer  Fifth  Circuit  held  th~t civilly committed  mental  patients \ni \nhave  a  constitutional  right  I  individual  treatment  that  will \n~o \nI \nafford  them  a  reasonable  oPP9rtunity  to  be  cured  or  to  improve \ntheir mental  condition.

See;D.W.  v.  Rogers,  113  F.3d  1214,  1218 \n(11th  Cir.  1997).

Zimring, 1119  S.Ct.  2176  (1999),  the  Supreme \nCourt  was  asked  to  decide  whtther  Title  II  of  the  ADA  requires \nI \nplacement  of  persons  with  me*tal  disabilities  in  community \nsettings  rather  than  in  institutions.  See  Olmstead,  119  S.Ct.  at \n2181.  Answering  this  questi~n with  a  \"qualified  yes\"  ,  the  Court \nin  Olmstead  held  that: \ni \nSuch  an  action  is  in  when  the  State's  treatment \nor~er \nprofessionals  have  detetmined  that  community  placement \nis  appropriate,  the  tra~sfer from  institutional  care  to \na  less  restrictive  setting  is  not  opposed  by  the  affected \nindividual,  and  the  pla~ement can  be  reasonably \naccommodated,  taking  into  account  the  resources  available \nto  the  State  and  the  ne~ds of  others  with  disabilities. \nI \nId.  However,  the  Court  in flmstead  expounded  on  its  holding  by \nstating  that  a  state's  respoI*  sibility  to  provide  community-based \ntreatment  to  qualified perso~s with  disabilities  is  not \ni \nboundless.

In  this  case,  the \ndefendants have  raised an  Eleventh Amendment  immunity defense  to the ADA \nclaims  against  it.  This  court'l however,  need  not  address  what  effect, \nif any,  the  Garrett opinion  have  on  the ADA  claims  in  this  case  in \nwou~d \nlight  of  the  fact  that  the  cotrt  finds  that  the  defendants  have  not \nviolated the  ADA.  Therefore,  a  y  Eleventh Amendment  defense  offered by \nthe  defendants  is  rendered  moot. \n28 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1319     Filed 06/28/2001     Page 29 of 44(cid:10)\nresist  modifications  that  entiail  a  alteration\"  of \n~fundamental \nthe  state's  services  and  prodrams.

Reasonable  and  Safety \nCa~e \nIn  this  case,  the  plainbI iffs  have  three  \"constitutional \nclaims\"  that  can  be  divided  various  sub-parts.  The  first \n~nto \nconstitutional  claim  raised  ~y the  plaintiffs  pertains  to  the \n, \n, \nprovision  of  reasonable  care  and  safety  to  the  patients  at  GPW. \nSpecifically,  the  plaintiffs ;I allege  that  the  patients  at  GPW  are \nina~equatelY \ninadequately  supervised;  treated  for  self-injurious \nprote~ted \nbehavior;  inadequately  from  environmental  hazards;  and \n29 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1319     Filed 06/28/2001     Page 30 of 44(cid:10)\nthat  adverse  incidents  are  inadequately  investigated  and/or \nresponded  to. \nInadequate  Supervision \nThe  plaintiffs  contend  tihat  GPW  fails  to  provide  a \nsufficient  number  of  adequat1ly  trained  staff  to  provide  patients \n, \nwith  adequate  supervision  anq  safety  in  a  therapeutic \nenvironment.  However,  the  evidence  at  trial  shows  that  GPW  is \nadequately  staffedยท with  trairted  employees  who  provide  adequate \nsupervision  and  safety  as  marldated  by  the  Supreme  Court's  holding \nin  Youngberg  that  a  the  must  provide  reasonable  safety  for \nStat~ \nall  residents.

While  it is \ntrue  that  in  any  psychiatric  hospital,  a  larger  number  of  trained \nstaff  would  always  be  ideal,  the  staffing  at  GPW  provides \nreasonable  care  and  safety  arid  complies  with  accepted \nprofessional  judgment,  pract~ce,  or  standards.

Adequate  Treatment \nThe  next  constitutional  claim  asserted  by  the  plaintiffs  is \nthat  the  patients  at  GPW  do  not  receive  adequate  treatment.  The \nsub-claims  under  this  main  claim are  inadequate  assessment  of \npatients;  inadequate  treatment  planning;  inadequate  provision  of \nactive  treatment;  and  inadequate  discharge  planning. \nPatient  Assessment \nTurning  first  to  the  sub-claim of  inadequate  assessment  of \npatients,  the  plaintiffs  contend  that  patient  assessments  at  GPW \nfail  to  determine  realistic  rehabilitative  goals  and  the \nappropriate  treatment  needed  to  attain  those  goals. \ninterv~ntions \nContrary  to  these  allegations,  however,  the  evidence  at  trial \nshows  that  GPW's  clinical  assessments  of  patients  are  based  on \nprofessional  judgment  and  comply  with  accepted  professional \njudgment,  practice,  or  standards.  See  Youngberg,  457  U.S.  323; \nTr.  8/31,  87.1-89.25;  Tr.  8/31,  89.13-91.11;  Tr.  8/31,  99.17-\n100.7;  207.6-15;  Tr.  8/25,  88.19-90.3;  Tr.  8/31,  96.10-98.20; \nExhibit  D-26;  Tr.  8/31,  139.~3-24. \n33 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1319     Filed 06/28/2001     Page 34 of 44(cid:10)\nTreatment  Planning \nMoving  to  the  plaintiffs'  sub-claim  for  inadequate  treatment \nplanning,  the  plaintiffs  state  that  patients  at  GPW  are  provided \nad  hoc  and  inconsistent  treatment  activities  that  often  bear  only \nan  incidental  relationship  to  their  therapeutic  needs  and  goals. \nHowever,  the  evidence  at  triql  shows  that  treatment  planning  at \nGPW  is  based  on  professional  judgment  that  comports  with  accepted \nprofessional  judgment,  practice,  or  standards.  Tr. \nSee,~, \n8/23,  107.12-18;  Tr.  8/23,  187.10-213.12;  Tr.  8/23,  138.24-144.6; \nTr.  8/24,  10.3-13.11;  Tr.  8/24,  140.2-7;  140.11-15;  Exhibit  0-\n135;  Tr.  8/24,  147.1-18;  149.20-25;  150.3-17;  Exhibit  0-123  at  8-\n16;  Tr.  8/24,  93.16-22.  While  it is  true  that  the  expert \nopinions  at  trial  varied  as  bo  what  treatment  is  best  for  any \ngiven  patient,  it is  not  appropriate  for  the  Court  to  choose \nwhich  of  several  professionally  acceptable  treatment  planning \nchoices  should  have  been  made.  Treatment  planning  at  GPW  is \nbased  on  professional  judgment  that  comports  with  accepted \nprofessional  judgment,  or  standards.  See  Youngberg, \npract~ce, \n, \n457  U.S.  at  321;  Tr.  8/24,  91.2-93.7. \nProvision  of Treatment  4nd  Treatment  Programing \nMuch  like  their  sub-claim  for  treatment  planning,  the \nplaintiffs  also  claim  that  provision  of  active  treatment  at \nt~e \nGPW  is  inadequate.  Once  again,  however,  the  evidence  at  trial \nshows  that  treatment  at  GPW  is  based  on  professional  judgment \n34 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1319     Filed 06/28/2001     Page 35 of 44(cid:10)\nthat  comports  with  accepted  judgment,  practice,  or \np~ofessional \nstandards.

Furthermore,  the  evidence  at  trial  shows  that \ntreatment  at  GPW  reasonably  ensures  patient  safety  and \nfacilitates  the  patients'  ability to  function  free  from  bodily \nrestraints;  prevents  patients'  basic  self-care  skills  from \ndeteriorating;  and  affords  patients  a  reasonable  opportunity  to \nbe  cured  or  to  improve  their mental  condition.

Supp.  at  276. \nDischarge  Planning \nAs  a  final  sub-claim  under  failure  to  provide  adequate \ntreatment,  the  plaintiffs  argue  that  discharge  planning  at  GPW  is \n, \ninadequate.  At  trial,  the  evidence  showed  that  GPW  has \nhowev~r, \nan  ongoing  system  for  planning  that  is  based  on \ndischa~ge \nprofessional  judgment  that  cqmports  with  accepted  professional \npractice  and  standards.

While  the  testimony \nat  trial  showed  that  every  aspect  of  every  patient's  discharge \nplan  was  not  always  formally  in  a  set  series  of \n~ecorded \ndocuments,  the  evidence  also  showed  that  GPW's  discharge  planning \nsystem  is  based  on  professional  judgment  that  complies  with \naccepted  professional  practice  and  standards.  Tr.  9/8,  81.25-\n82.21;  178.9-18. \n(iii) .  Provision  of  Community  Health  Services \nThe  final  constitutional  claim  raised  by  the  plaintiffs  is \nthat  the  defendants  are  violating  the  Constitution  in  the \nprovision  of  community  mental  health  services  to  present  and \nformer  GPW  patients.  More  specifically,  the  plaintiffs  allege \nthat  the  defendants  are  not  providing  adequate  community  services \nto  meet  the  assessed  functional  and  clinical  needs  of  current  and \nformer  GPW  patients,  nor  are  they providing  such  services  in  the \nmost  integrated  setting  appropriate  to  the  needs  of  those \npatients.  At  trial,  however,  the  evidence  did  not  support  the \nplaintiffs'  aforementioned  constitutional  claims.  In  fact,  the \nevidence  at  trial  showed  that  the  defendants'  provision  of \ncommunity  services  is  based  qn  professional  judgment  that \ncomports  with  accepted  professional  practice  and  standards.  See, \n~,  Tr.  9/8,  45.2-18;  Tr.  9/7,  21.15-23.7;  Tr.  9/8,  45.19-\n46.23;  178.15-180.10;  Tr.  9/8,  57.16-58.21;  106.2-6;  Exhibit  0-\n117  at  9;  Tr.  8/15,  58.3-5;  59.1-6;  Tr.  9/8,  75.19-76.5;  OOJ \n36 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1319     Filed 06/28/2001     Page 37 of 44(cid:10)\nExhibit  212  at  Appendix  0;  DOJ  Exhibit  333;  Tr.  9/7,  72.11-75.14. \nFurthermore,  no  evidence  at  trial  suggested  that  the  provision  of \ncommunity  services  to  current  and  former  GPW  patients  was  not \ntaking  place  in  the  most  integrated  setting appropriate  for  the \nneeds  of  those  patients.  While  the  testimony  of  some  witnesses \nwas  that  some  GPW  patients  do  not  receive  community  services  in \nthe  best  of  settings,  this  fact  alone  does  not  constitute  a \nconstitutional  violation.  The  law  requires  that  community \nservices  must  comply  with  accepted  professional  judgment, \npractice,  or  standards,  and  does  not  require  that  community \nservices  be  provided  in  the  best  conceivable  setting possible. \nYoungberg,  457  u.s.  at  323.  Similarly,  the  testimony  at  trial \nshowed  that  some  of  GPW's  community  patients,  at  times,  end  up  in \nless  than  desirable  circumstances  after  their  discharge.  While \nthis  anecdotal  evidence  is  sad  and  unfortunate,  it does  not  prove \na  constitutional  violation  due  to  the  fact  that  it does  not  show \nthat  professional  judgment,  practice,  or  standards  are  not  being \ncomplied  with.  See  id.  In  fact,  substantial  evidence  at  trial \nshowed  that  patients  in  the  community  often  end  up  in  unfortunate \nsituations  due  to  factors  that  are  beyond  the  defendants' \ncontrol.  See,~, Tr.  8/15,  15.17-17.17  (patient  recidivism); \nTr.  9/8,  90.15-96.15  (conclusion  of  involuntary  commitment \nstatus/loss  of  patient  cooperation);  Tr.  9/8,  90.15-96.15 \n(criminal  conduct  by  patients) . \n37 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1319     Filed 06/28/2001     Page 38 of 44(cid:10)\n/.-.. \n(B).  Claims  Under  the  AD~ \nIn  addition  to  their  con$titutional  claims,  the  plaintiffs \nalso  contend  that  the  defendants  are  violating  the  ADA  by  failing \nto  make  reasonable  modifications  necessary  to  provide  mental \nhealth  services  in  the  most  iptegrated  setting  appropriate  for \npatient  needs.  According-to  the  plaintiffs,  the  ADA  demands  that \nmental  health  services  be  provided  in  community  settings  to  the \nextent  that  such  a  setting  is  consistent  with  patient  needs.  See \nUnited  States'  and  Plaintiffs'  Post-Trial  Memorandum  of  Law  at \n14.  As  noted  previously,  the  crux  of  the  plaintiffs'  ADA  claim \nis  that  the  defendants  are  failing  to  reasonably modify  their \nprograms  in  light  of  the  fact  that  they  are  failing  to  provide \nmental  health  services  in  the  most  integrated  setting  appropriate \nto  patient  needs.  While  the  lion's  share  of  the  plaintiffs' \narguments  focuses  on  the  modifications  that  the  defendants  could \nmake  to  comply  with  the  ADA,  the  underlying  premise  of  the \nplaintiffs'  ADA  claim  is  faulty.  Specifically,  the  evidence  at \ntrial  did  not  show  that  the  defendants  were  failing  to  administer \nGPW's  mental  health  program  in  the  most  integrated  setting \nappropriate  to  the  needs  of  current  and  former  GPW  patients. \nSee,  ~,  T r.  9/8 ,  45. 2 -18 ;T r.  9/7,  21. 15 - 23 . 7;  T r.  9/8 ,  45. 1 9-\n46.23;  178.15-180.10;  Tr.  9/8,  57.16-58.21;  106.2-6;  Exhibit  D-\n11 7  at  9;  T r.  8 / 15 ,  58. 3 - 5 ;  59. 1-6 ;  T r.  9/8,  7 5 . 19 -7 6 . 5 ;  DO J \nExhibit  212  at  Appendix  D;  DQJ  Exhibit  333;  Tr.  9/7,  72.11-75.14. \n38 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1319     Filed 06/28/2001     Page 39 of 44(cid:10)\nIn  other  words,  while  the  plaintiffs'  ADA  claims  focus  on  what \nmodifications  the  defendants  could make  to  improve  their mental \nhealth  program,  their  evidence  at  trial  failed  to  prove  that  the \ndefendants  are  in  fact  violating  the  ADA. \nAs  noted  above,  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  in  the \nOlmstead  decision  held  that: \n[Title  II  of  the  ADA  requires  placement  of  persons  with \nmental  disabilities  in  community  settings  rather  than  in \ninstitutions]  when  the  State's  treatment  professionals  have \ndetermined  that  community  placement  is  appropriate,  the \ntransfer  from  institutional  care  to  a  less  restrictive \nsetting  is  not  opposed  by  the  affected  individual,  and  the \nplacement  can  be  reasonably  accommodated,  taking  into \naccount  the  resources  available  to  the  State  and  the  needs \nof  others  with  disabilities \nOlmstead,  119  S.Ct.  at  2181.  With  this  holding  in  mind,  the \nevidence  at  trial did  not  prove  that  the  defendants  are  failing \nto  place  individuals  in  an  appropriate  community  treatment \nsetting when  relevant  treatment  professionals  have  determined \nthat  community  placement  is  appropriate.  See  supra,  Part \nII (A)  (iii).  Given  this  fact,  the  plaintiffs  have  failed  to  show \nany  violation  of  the  ADA  as  interpreted  by  the  Supreme  Court  in \nOlmstead. \nAdditionally,  the  plaintiffs'  contend  that  the  defendants' \nmental  health  program,  as  administered,  results  in  unnecessary \nisolation  of  patients  into  segregated  settings.  Specifically, \nthe  plaintiffs  claim that  the  alleged  segregation  of  patients \nstems  from  the  defendants'  (1)  failure  to  provide  an  appropriate \n39 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1319     Filed 06/28/2001     Page 40 of 44(cid:10)\narray  and  intensity  of  community  services;  (2)  failure  to  plan \nfor  patient  discharges;  (3)  failure  to  assess  the  needs  of  the \npatient  population;  and  (4)  failure  to  properly manage  their \nresources  and  system  accountability.  Much  like  the  similar \nclaims  made  by  the  plaintiffs  in  their  constitutional  counts, \nhowever,  the  evidence  at  trial does  not  substantiate  any  of  the \nalleged  segregation  claims.  See  supra,  Part  II(A);  See  also,  Tr. \n8/15,  58.3-5;  59.1-6;  Tr.  9/8,  75.19-76.5;  Tr.  8/10,  83.5-84.5; \nT r.  8/15,  84. 3 - 8 5 . 6;  T r.  8/15,  52. 24 - 5 3 . 7;  T r.  9/5,  148. 17-\n149.14;  Tr.  8/17,  183.19-22;  Tr.  8/15,  55.13-56.8;  OOJ  Exhibit \n212,  Appendix  0;  OOJ  Exhibit  333.  As  a  general  matter,  the \nevidence  at  trial did  not  show  that  the  defendants'  mental  health \nprogram,  as  administered,  results  in  unnecessary  isolation  of \npatients  into  segregated  settings.  See  Tr.  9/6,  199.13-15; \n202.17-201.25;  Exhibit  0-146A  at  ยง394.453;  Tr.  9/7,  21.15-23.7; \nTr.  9/7,  33.18-23;  OOJ  Exhibit  71;  Exhibit  0-100  at  i-iii. \nNotwithstanding  the  four  reasons  offered  by  the  plaintiffs  as  to \nwhy  patients  are  unnecessarily  isolated  into  segregated  settings, \nthe  evidence  at  trial  failed  to  show  that  patients  are  in  fact \nisolated  into  segregated  settings.  Additionally,  an  examination \nof  each  of  the  four  alleged problems  offered  by  the  plaintiffs, \nin  light  of  the  evidence  presented  at  trial,  shows  that  the \ndefendants  are  not  unnecessarily  subjecting  patients  to  isolated \nsegregation. \n40 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1319     Filed 06-/28/2001     Page 41 of 44(cid:10)\n. \nยทr--\n... \nAs  to  the  array  and  intensity of  community  settings  provided \nby  the  defendants,  the  plaintiffs  have  offered  ample  evidence  at \ntrial  to  show  that  different  community  services  could  be  offered \nby  the  defendants.  The  plaintiffs  have  also  presented  evidence \nthat  the  community  services  offered by  the  defendants  could  be \nbetter,  broader  and  more  intense.  Despite  these  facts,  however, \nthe  plaintiffs  have  failed  to  show  that  the  community  services \nprovided  by  the  defendants  are  inadequate  to  the  point  that  they \nresult  in  unnecessary  isolated segregation  in  violation  of  the \nADA.  See,~, Tr.  9/8,  45.2-18;  Tr.  9/7,  21.15-23.7;  Tr.  9/8, \n45.19-46.23;  178.15-180.10;  Tr.  9/8,  57.16-58.21;  106.2-6; \nExhibit  0-117  at  9;  Tr.  8/15,  58.3-5;  59.1-6;  Tr.  9/8,  75.19-\n76.5;  DOJ  Exhibit  212  at  Appendix  0;  DOJ  Exhibit  333;  Tr.  9/7, \n72.11-75.14. \nAs  to  discharge  planning  and  patient  needs  assessments,  the \nCourt's  previous  discussion  of  these  topics  under  the  plaintiffs' \nconstitutional  claims  is  also  relevant  here. 6  The  evidence  at \ntrial  showed  that  discharge  planning  and  patient  needs  assessment \nat  GPW  are  not  done  in  violation  of  the  ADA  See,  DOJ  Exhibit \n148  at  2.;  Tr.  9/8,  96.17-98.8;  Tr.  9/8,83.17-85.23;  Tr.  9/8, \n85.25-87.18;  Tr.  9/8,  93.24-96.15;  Tr.  9/8,  69.2-70.25;  Exhibit \nIn fact,  the plaintiffs themselves note the similarity between the \n6\narguments  made  in  their  constitutional  claims  and  those  made  in  their \nADA  segregation  claims.  See  United  States'  and  Plaintiffs'  Post-Trial \nMemorandum  of  Law  at  19. \n41 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1319     Filed 06/28/2001     Page 42 of 44(cid:10)\n0-117  at  11-13;  Tr.  9/8,  81.25-82.9;  Tr.  9/7,  39.6-16.DOJ  Exhibit \n80  at  5. \nFinally,  the  defendants'  resource  management  and  system \naccountability  as  it relates  to  compliance  with  the  ADA  is \nirrelevant  since  no  violation  of  the  ADA  has  been  proven.  Having \nmade  the  preceding  finding  that  the  defendants  are  not  violating \nthe  ADA,  it is  unnecessary  for  the  Court  to  examine  whether  the \nproposed  modifications  offered by  the  plaintiffs  are  reasonable \nand/or  are  fundamental  alterations  to  the  defendants'  mental \nhealth  program.  In  other  words,  there  is  no  need  for  the  Court \nto  consider  what  program modifications  would  bring  the  defendants \ninto  compliance  with  the  ADA  given  the  fact  that  the  Court  has \nfound  that  the  defendants  are  not  violating  the  ADA. \nIn  this  trial,  the  burden  of  proof  was  on  the  plaintiffs  to \nprove  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence  that  the  defendants  are \nviolating  the  statutory and  constitutional  rights  of  current  and \nformer  GPW  patients.  They  have  not  done  so.  While  the \nplaintiffs  have  offered  evidence  that  mistakes  have  been  made  and \nthat  conditions  and  programs  could  be  different  or  in  some  cases \nbetter,  they  have  failed  to  prove  that  the  patients  at  GPW  are \ninadequately  supervised;  inadequately  treated  for  self-injurious \nbehavior;  inadequately  protected  from  environmental  hazards;  or \nthat  adverse  incidents  are  inadequately  investigated  and/or \nresponded  to.  Additionally,  the  plaintiffs  have  failed  to  prove \n42 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1319     Filed 06/28/2001     Page 43 of 44(cid:10)\ninadequate  assessment  of  patients;  inadequate  treatment  planning; \ninadequate  provision  of  active  treatment;  or  inadequate  discharge \nplanning.  As  to  community  services,  the  plaintiffs  have  failed \nto  prove  that  the  defendants  are  not  providing  adequate  community \nservices  to  meet  the  assessed  functional  and  clinical  needs  of \ncurrent  and  former  GPW  patients,  nor  have  they  proven  that  the \ndefendants  are  not  providing  such  services  in  the  most  integrated \nsetting  appropriate  to  the  needs  of  patients. \nLikewise,  the  plaintiffs  have  failed  to  prove  a  violation  of \nthe  ADA.  Again,  while  the  plaintiffs  offered  evidence  that \ncommunity  services  and  facilities  could  be  different  and  in  some \ninstances  better,  they  have  failed  to  prove  that  the  defendants' \nmental  health  program,  as  administered,  results  in  unnecessary \nisolation  of  patients  into  segregated  settings. \nAccordingly,  it is  hereby  ORDERED  AND  ADJUDGED  that  the \nClerk  shall  enter  final  judgment  in  this matter  in  favor  of  the \ndefendants  and  against  the  plaintiffs and  plaintiff-intervenor  in \nthis  matter  on  all  claims  raised  and  tried  in  Case  No.  8:87-Civ-\n369-T-24TBM  during  the  weeks  of  August  7,  2000  through  September \n8,  2000. \n43 \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1319     Filed 06/28/2001     Page 44 of 44(cid:10)\n.-\nr:\\ \n-1 \nDONE  AND  ORDERED  at  Tampa,  Florida,  this  ~ day  of  June, \n2001.

DISTRICT  COURT \nFOR  THE  MIDDLE  DISTRICT OF FLORIDA \nTAMPA  DIVISION \nMILLER  FRANK  JOHNSON, \non behalf of himself and all \nthose similarly  situated, \nPlaintiffs, \nCivil Action  No. \nVB. \nRICHARD  INSLEY,  Administrator,  CLASS  ACTION \nG.  PIERCE  WOOD  MEMORIAL \nHOSPITAL,  FLORIDA  DEPARTMENT \nOF  HEALTH  AND  REHABILI-\nTA TIVE  SERVICES, \nDefendants. \n-------------------------------------, \nCOMPLAINT \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n1.  This is a  suit brought pursuant to 42  U. S. C.  ยงl983  to  redress \nviolations  of  the  1st,  5th.  6th  and  14th  Amendments  to  the  United  States \nConstitution. \n2.  Plaintiffs  seek  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  under  the  1st \nand  14th  Amendments  to  prevent  the  Defendants  from  restricting  their \nassociation  with  others  or  their  liberty  for  reasons  not  related  to  treatment. \nPlaintiffs allege that they are unnecessarily restricted while on the grounds of \nG.  Pierce  Wood  Memorial  Hospital  and  that  they  are  denied  access  to \ntelephones  for  reasons  unrelated  to  their  treatment  needs.  Plaintiffs  also \nallege  that  they  are  being  held  at  G.  Pierce  Wood  Memorial  Hospital  without \nreceiving treatment because the Defendants have failed  to provide alternative, \nless restrictive facilities in their home communities. \n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1     Filed 03/11/1987     Page 2 of 7(cid:10)\n3.  Plaintiffs  seek  declaratory and injunctive  relief under  the  5th, \n6th and 14th  Amendments to prevent the Defendants from  denying them access \nto the  courts.  Plaintiffs  allege  that  Defendants'  failure  to  provide  them  with \na  law  library or attorney representation effectively denies them  this access. \nII.  JURISDICTION \n4.  This court has jurisdiction over Plaintiffs'  claims pursuant to \n28  U.S.C.  fU331,  1343(3),  2201(a),  2202  and 42  U.S.C.  ยงi983. \n5 โข  The  unlawful  practices and  policies  alleged  below  were  and  are \nnow  being committed by the Defendant within the Middle  District of Florida. \nIII.  PARTIES \n6.  Plaintiff,  MILLER  FRANK  JOHNSON,  is  a  psychiatric patient at \nG.  Pierce Wood  Memorial  Hospital in DeSoto County,  Florida. \n7.  Defendant,  RICHARD  INSLEY,  is  the  Administrator  of  G. \nPierce Wood  Memorial  Hospital,  DeSoto County,  Florida. \n8.  Defendant,  FLORIDA  DEPARTMENT  OF  HEALTH  AND \nREHABILITATIVE  SERVICES  (HRS),  is  the  department  of  state  government \nresponsible for  providing a  comprehensive  statewide  program  of mental  health \ncare.  As  a  result,  HRS  exercises  executive  and  administrative  supervision \nover  all  mental  health  facilities  in  the  state  of  Florida,  including  G.  Pierce \nWood  Memorial  Hospital. \nIV.  CLASS  ACTION  ALLEGATIONS \n9.  This  action is brought pursuant to  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  23 (a)  and \n(b)  since Defendants have  acted in a  manner  generally  applicable  to the  class \nas a  whole. \n- 2  -\n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1     Filed 03/11/1987     Page 3 of 7(cid:10)\n10.  The  Plaintiff  class  consists  of  all  present  and  future  patients \nat  G.  Pierce Wood  Memorial  Hospital. \n11.  This action is properly brought as a  class action because: \na.  The  class  is  so  numerous  that  joinder  of  all  members  is \nimpracticable. \nb.  Questions of law  and fact  common  to the class include,  but \nare not limited to,  whether the  defendants have  deprived them of: \n1)  their right to  movement  and  freedom  from  unreasonable \nrestraint; \n2)  their right to the least restrictive appropriate  available \ntreatment; \n3)  their  right  to  communicate  freely  and  privately  with \npersons  outside  the  facility  and  to  use  telephones  in  the  least \nrestrictive manner; \n4)  their right to liberty; \n5)  their  right  to  associate  with  other  patients  of  their \nchoice; \n6)  their right of access to the courts. \nc.  The  Plaintiff's  claims  are  typical  of  those  of  the  class. \nPlaintiff  is  a  patient  at  G.  Pierce  Wood  Memorial  Hospital  who  has  been \ndenied: \n1)  his  right  to  movement  and  freedom  from  unreasonable \nrestraint; \n2)  his  right  to  the  least  restrictive  appropriate  available \ntreatment; \n- 3  -\n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1     Filed 03/11/1987     Page 4 of 7(cid:10)\n3)  his  right  to  communicate  freely  and  privately  with \npersons  outside  the  facility  and  to  use  telephones  in  the  least \nrestrictive manner; \n4)  his right to liberty; \n5)  his right to associate with other patients of his choice; \n6)  his right of access to the courts. \n12 โข  The  Plaintiff  will  fairly  and  adequately  protect  and  represent \nthe interests of the class  since  all his claims  are identical to  the claims  of the \nclass  as  a  whole  and  he  has retained  competent  counsel to represent  him  and \nothers similarly situated. \n13.  Defendants  have  acted  or  refused  to  act on  grounds  generally \napplicable to the class as a  whole. \nV.  FACTS \n14.  Plaintiff,  Miller  Frank  Johsnon,  is  a  patient  at  G.  Pierce  Wood \nMemorial  Hospital  (the hospital),  a  state-operated psychiatric treatment facility \nhousing over 800  people like the plaintiff. \n15.  Plaintiffs'  ability  to  move  freely  about  the  hospital  grounds  is \ngoverned by whether they possess grounds privileges. \n16.  Grounds  privileges  are initially  granted by a  treatment team of \nmental  health  professionals,  but they  are  routinely  revoked  and  reinstated by \nward staff who possess no more than a  high school diploma. \n17.  As  a  result,  Plaintiffs'  rights  to  freedom  of  movement  and \nliberty  are  being  restricted,  not  for  any  reasons  related  to  their  treatment, \nbut to punish them  for  disobedience,  coerce  them  into following  hospital rules \nor  other  rules  arbitrarily  created  by  the  hospital  staff  and  to  serve  the \nconvenience of the hospital staff. \n- 4 -\n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1     Filed 03/11/1987     Page 5 of 7(cid:10)\n18.  The  Plaintiffs  have  been  deprived  of  access  to  public \ntelephones  because  of  there  are  no  telephones  on  the  wards  and  because  of \narbitrary  restrictions,  not  related  to  their  treatment  placed  on  the  use  of \ntelephones. \n19.  The  Plaintiffs  have  been  deprived  of  access  to  the  courts \nbecause there is no law  library available to them  and  they  do  not have access \nto attorneys. \n20.  As  to  the  representative  Plaintiff,  Miller  Frank  Johnson,  at \nleast  six  months  ago  his  doctors  determined  that  he  was  ready  to  be \ndischarged from  G. P. Wโข  \n21.  Mr.  Johnson  has  not  been  discharged,  in  part,  because  of  a \nlack  of  alternative  treatment  services  in  the  communities  served  by  the \nhospital. \nVII โข  CLAIMS  FOR  RELIEF \nCOUNT  I \n22.  The  Defendants'  confinement  of  Plaintiffs  for  reasons  other \nthan  treatment  has  deprived  them  of  their  right  to  associate  with  other \npatients  of  their  own  choosing  in  violation  of  the  First  Amendment  to  the \nUnited States  Constitution,  and thereby 42  U. S . C.  11983. \nCOUNT  II \n23.  The  Defendants'  confinement  of  Plaintiffs  for  reasons  other \nthan  treatment  has  deprived  them  of their  liberty  without  due  process of law \nin  violation  of the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution, \nand thereby 42  U. S. C.  11983. \n- 5  -\n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1     Filed 03/11/1987     Page 6 of 7(cid:10)\nCOUNT  III \n24.  Defendants'  restrictions  on  access  to  public  telephones \nrestricts  the  Plaintiffs'  ability  to  associate  with  others  and  deprives  them  of \ntheir liberty in violation of the  First and  Fourteenth  Amendments  to  the  U. S . \nConstitution and thereby 42  U. S. C.  ยง 1983. \nCOUNT  IV \n25.  Defendants'  failure  to  provide  legal  assistance  denies  Plaintiffs \naccess  to  the  courts  in  violation  of  the  Fifth,  Sixth  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments to the  U. S.  Constitution and thereby 42  U. S. C.  ยง1983. \nVIII.  IRREPARABLE  HARM \n26.  Plaintiffs  have  no  plain,  speedy,  or adequate  remedy at  law  to \nsecure  redress.  Unless  restrained  and  enjoined  by  tbis  Court,  Defendants \nwill  continue  to  deny  Plaintiffs  their  rights  under  the  Constitution  of  the \nUnited  States.  By  virtue  of the  foregoing,  Plaintiffs  have  suffered  and  will \ncontinue to suffer immediate  and irreparable injury. \nIX.  PRAYER  FOR  RELIEF \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs request that this Court: \na)  Certify this action as  a  class action; \nb)  Grant  a  jury trial on  all issues  on  which  Plaintiffs  are  entitled \nas  a  matter of right; \nc)  Declare  that  Defendants'  confinement  and  restriction  of patients \nfor  reasons  other  than  treatment  violates  their  rights  as  guaranteed  by  the \nFirst and  Fourteenth Amendments to the United  States  Constitution. \n- 6 -\n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB     Document 1     Filed 03/11/1987     Page 7 of 7(cid:10)\n--\n,/ \nd)  Grant  preliminary  and  permanent  injunctive  relief  restraining \nand  enjoining  the  Defendants,  their  officers,  agents,  employees,  attorneys, \nand  successors  in  office,  and  all  other  persons  in  active  concert  and \nparticipation  with  them,  from  any  further  confinement  or  restriction  of \npatients for purposes other than treatment; \ne)  Award  Plaintiffs  costs  and  reasonable  attorneys'  fees  pursuant \nto 42  U.S.C.  ยง1988;  and \nf)  Grant any other relief the Court deems equitable. \nRespectfully submitted, \nDATED:  March  11,  1987 \nInc. \n\"..-----~~~~;:::::..~~;;e.~~~~_A_CL. \nK.

CASE NO.  8:87-cv-369-T-24 TBM\nGEORGE H. SHELDON, et al.,\nDefendant.\n                                                             /\nORDER\nThis cause comes before the Court for consideration of Defendantโs Unopposed\nDispositive Motion to Exit Suncoast Region and District 8 and Terminate Consent Decree (Doc.\nNo. 1618).  Upon this Courtโs independent examination of the file and after conducting a hearing\nupon the unopposed motion on February 11, 2010, in which all parties and the Court Monitor\nwere heard, it is determined that the Suncoast Region and District 8 are allowed to exit the\nConsent Decree (Doc. No. 68); the Stipulation Regarding Exit Criteria (Doc. No. 1615) has been\ncomplied with; the remaining paragraphs of the Consent Decree โ 2, 35, and 37 โ are vacated;\nthe injunctions are dissolved; the Consent Decree is terminated and this Court relinquishes its\njurisdiction over this cause.\nI.  Background\nIn the Courtโs Order dated September 30, 2009, (Doc. No. 1614) related to Defendantโs\nFirst Motion to Exit Consent Decree (Doc. No. 1565) and Defendantโs Supplemental Motion to\nExit Consent Decree (Doc. No. 1577), it found that District 14 and District 15 had fully satisfied\nthe community exit criteria and were authorized to exit the Consent Decree and the Courtโs\n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB   Document 1625   Filed 02/19/10   Page 2 of 4 PageID 11045\nsupervision and Orders thereunder.  As to Suncoast Region and District 8 the motions were\ndenied.  However, Defendant was given leave to raise the issue of whether Suncoast Region fully\nsatisfied the community compliance exit criteria in 2007 because one โrefuserโ (one who refused\nall treatment for at least 90 days) should have been excluded from the 2007 compliance review. \nThe Court further ordered that monitoring should continue in accordance with the Consent\nDecree and the community compliance exit criteria as to District 8 and the Suncoast Region.\nPursuant to the 1993 Stipulation, the levels of compliance required to exit are defined as\nfollows:\n1. 85 percent of all class members will achieve positive results on 6 of the 7\n(85%) community compliance areas.\n2. Each district will exit any individual community compliance area when 85\npercent or more people in the sample meet the requirements of any\ncompliance area(s).  Monitoring will continue for the full sample across\nall seven community compliance areas until the required performance\nlevel of 85 percent has been achieved in all seven compliance areas. \nMonitoring of those compliance areas where the standard has been\npreviously achieved shall be considered technical assistance and any\nfuture scores shall not affect the district(s) ability to exit overall.\n3. Each district will exit independent of the performance of any other district\nwhen the performance criteria stated on 1 and 2 above have been\nachieved.\n(Doc. No. 1615: Exhibit 1 to Stipulation, p. 3).\nII.  Full Compliance with the Exit Criteria\nOn November 13, 2009, the Office of the Monitor issued its 2009 Suncoast Region\nCommunity Exit Criteria Compliance Reviews Report of Findings, which concluded as follows:\nThe Suncoast Region has achieved full compliance with both\nrequirements of the community exit criteria.  As this report\ndocuments, this area actually achieved all of the requirements for\nexiting the lawsuit in 2007, but the error was not discovered until\n2\n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB   Document 1625   Filed 02/19/10   Page 3 of 4 PageID 11046\nrecently.  While in 2008, Suncoast Region did not meet the\nrequirements for compliance, that review would not have occurred\nhad the real findings for 2007 been known.  And given that the\narea achieved compliance in 2007 and scored very highly during\nthe 2009 reviews, it is clear that the Suncoast Region has met both\nof the requirements for a finding of full compliance.\n(Doc. No. 1618-1:  Exhibit 1, Monitorโs 2009 Suncoast Region Report of Findings, p. 7).\nOn December 19, 2009, the Office of the Monitor issued its 2009 District 8 Community\nExit Criteria Compliance Reviews Report of Findings, which concluded as follows:\nGiven that the Monitorโs November 13, 2009 report on the\nSuncoast Regionโs 2009 community compliance review confirmed\nfull compliance with both requirements of the exit criteria and this\nreport confirms that District 8 has achieved full compliance with\nboth requirements of the community exit criteria, the Office of the\nMonitor concludes that defendants have complied with all of the\nprovisions of the exit criteria.\n(Doc. No. 1618-2:  Exhibit 2, Monitorโs 2009 District 8 Report of Findings, p. 6).\nAt the hearing conducted on February 11, 2010, the Court confirmed with the parties,\nthat once the unopposed motion is granted it would terminate the Consent Decree and the\nCourtโs jurisdiction over this cause.  The Monitor affirmed the purpose of the Consent Decree\nhad been achieved and that there is no significant likelihood of recurring violations of federal\nlaw once the Consent Decree has been lifted.\n3\n\nCase 8:87-cv-00369-SCB   Document 1625   Filed 02/19/10   Page 4 of 4 PageID 11047\nIII.  Conclusion\nAccordingly it is now ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that:\n(1) Defendantโs Unopposed Dispositive Motion to Exit Suncoast Region and\nDistrict 8 and Terminate Consent Decree (Doc. No. 1618) is GRANTED. \n(2) The Court finds that Suncoast Region and District 8 have fully satisfied\nthe community compliance exit criteria and are authorized to exit the\nConsent Decree and the Courtโs supervision and Orders thereunder.

Schwartz, Center for Republic Representation, Northampton, MA, for Appellees.\n[*]\nBefore ANDERSON and COX, Circuit Judges, and NANGLE , District Judge.\nANDERSON, Circuit Judge:\nThese consolidated cases arise out of litigation against the State of Florida (\"the State\") over conditions at a\nformer state-run mental health facility, G. Pierce Wood Memorial Hospital (\"GPW\"), which closed in February\n[1]\n2002. In the first case, # 02-13499 (\"the Consent Decree case\"), the State  challenges the district court's\nrefusal to lift all conditions of a Consent Decree under which GPW was subject to court-supervised monitoring.\nThe Consent Decree was entered to settle litigation between a plaintiff class of patients and the State regarding\nconditions of confinement, treatment and release at the hospital. In the second case, # 02-14670 (\"the attorney\nfee case\"), the State challenges the district court's order refusing to award attorneys' fees incurred in defending\nclaims brought by the Justice Department as Intervenor on behalf of the patients. The State won on all counts at\na bench trial, and claims it is statutorily entitled to attorneys' fees as the prevailing party.\nI. BACKGROUND\nUntil its closure, GPW was a state-run hospital for the mentally ill, at which approximately 85 percent of the\n1337 patients *1337 were involuntarily committed by court order under a Florida statute known as the \"Baker Act.\" A\ngroup of patients at GPW brought a class action in the Middle District of Florida in November 1987, alleging that\nthe State was violating their constitutional rights by providing substandard care and housing, and by failing to\nrelease them when they were \"discharge ready.\" Specifically, the complaint alleged that the State: (1) violated\ntheir rights under the Fourteenth Amendment by failing to discharge them into less restrictive settings; (2) denied\nthem procedural due process in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment by arbitrarily revoking privileges without\nformal standards and with no opportunity for challenge; (3) abridged their First, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendment\n\nrights by arbitrarily restricting visitation privileges; (4) infringed their right to counsel in violation of the First, Fifth,\nSixth and Fourteenth Amendments by failing to provide legal assistance or an adequate law library; and (5)\nviolated their Fourteenth Amendment rights by providing inadequate medical staffing, recreation, vocational\ntraining, security and nutrition.\nThe court certified a class of \"all persons who are now or will in the future be committed\" to GPW, and a subclass\nof present and future patients \"who have been determined by their treatment team to be `discharge ready' for a\nperiod of 15 days or longer, but who have not been discharged.\" Significantly, the court later expanded the class\nto include \"former patients at GPW even after they are discharged into community treatment facilities.\"\nIn June 1989, the parties entered into a Consent Decree, under which the State agreed to make various changes\nin operations at GPW. A preamble to the decree, entitled \"Scope of Agreement,\" stated that the decree was\nbinding upon \"[d]efendants and their successors, agents, servants and employees.\" The only portion of the order\nat issue is the district court's refusal to terminate court supervision as it relates to three paragraphs of the\nConsent Decree: ยถยถ 2, 35, and 37. In Paragraph 2, the State agreed to begin assigning clients to living units and\nprograms according to their individual functional levels and therapeutic needs. The State further agreed that:\nAs community facilities become available ... this shall include moving residents from (1) more to\nless structured living; (2) larger to small living facilities; (3) group to individual residence; (4)\nsegregated from the community to integrated into community living; (5) dependent to independent\nliving, according to their needs and as more specifically set forth in the Comprehensive Services\nPlan for the Alcohol and Mental Health Program ... attached hereto and incorporated by reference.\nId. at ยถ 2. Paragraph 35 requires the parties to agree on the selection of a monitor to oversee compliance with the\nagreement, and Paragraph 37, which is similar to Paragraph 2, deals with the state's obligation to evaluate when\npatients are \"discharge ready\" and, subject to the availability of funding, to place them in appropriate community\nsettings.\nThe decree expressly provided that it was subject to court approval, and that \"[c]ompliance/non-compliance with\nthis Agreement shall be determined by the Court.\" In other words, the parties clearly contemplated a continuing\noversight role for the court. The Consent Decree was filed with the district court as a settlement agreement. After\nconducting a fairness hearing, the court approved the decree by order of August 14, 1989, reserving jurisdiction\nto oversee its implementation.\n1338 *1338 Because the State's obligations under the decree were somewhat general, the parties agreed after several\nyears of oversight by the monitor to develop criteria by which the state's compliance could be measured.\nAccordingly, they entered into two additional agreements (the \"Exit Criteria\"). There were two sets of Exit Criteria\n00 one governing the provision of legal services and one regarding the adequacy and timeliness of placement in\n97\ncommunity treatment00but only the latter is at issue here. The parties reduced their agreement to an \"Exit Criteria\n97\nStipulation,\" which they agreed to submit to court approval. In the stipulation, the parties agreed that the Exit\nCriteria would be \"the sole and exclusive method for assessing Defendants' performance and determining\ncompletion of their remaining obligations and the termination under the consent decree except as otherwise\naccepted by the parties and approved by the Monitors and the Court.\" Among other specifications, the stipulation\nprovided that reports of the monitor evaluating the State's compliance with the Exit Criteria would be appealable\nto the district court and subject to de novo judicial review. Notably, the Exit Criteria purported in several instances\n[2]\nto modify obligations imposed by the Consent Decree.\nIn December 1994, the State moved for the first time to withdraw from the Exit Criteria. The State, evidently\nhaving concluded that it entered into an unfavorable bargain, argued that the stipulation exceeded the scope of\nthe case as defined by the Complaint and the Consent Decree. It further argued that the executive branch\nofficials who entered into the Exit Criteria overstepped their authority by purporting to bind legislative\npolicymakers into the future. The motion was summarily rejected and the Exit Criteria remained in force.\nIn June 1996, the Justice Department moved to intervene in the case on the Plaintiffs' side under the Civil Rights\nof Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1997 et seq. (\"CRIPA\"). CRIPA empowers the Attorney General to\nbring or join litigation seeking injunctive relief on behalf of persons confined in state or municipal institutions, if\n\nthere is reasonable cause to believe that the confinees are being subjected to \"egregious or flagrant conditions\nwhich deprive such persons of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or\nlaws of the United States causing such persons to suffer grievous harm, and that such deprivation is pursuant to\na pattern or practice (of violations).\" See 42 U.S.C. ยง 1997(a). The DOJ Complaint accused the State of violating\nthe Fourteenth Amendment and the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 12131 et seq., by\nfailing to protect patients from harm, failing to provide the level of care appropriate to meet the patients' liberty\ninterests, and failing to ensure that each patient was placed in the most appropriate setting for his needs.\nThe State denied all of the DOJ allegations, and the case went to a five-week bench trial during August and\nSeptember of 2000. At the start of the trial, the State announced that it had decided to close GPW (although the\nState contends that its intentions were known before the trial). However, because the parties had agreed in the\npretrial order to limit the evidence presented at trial to that developed before September 30, 1999, the planned\nclosure was not part of the record at trial. The original class Plaintiffs actively participated in the trial and sought\n1339 affirmative relief *1339 beyond that provided under the Consent Decree.\nFollowing the trial, the district court issued an opinion on June 28, 2001, ruling for the State on all counts of the\nDOJ complaint. The court concluded that as of September 30, 1999, the State was providing a constitutionally\nadequate level of care under the standard set forth in Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73\nL.Ed.2d 28 (1982). Youngberg recognized that patients involuntarily committed to state custody enjoy a\nsubstantive due process right to \"reasonable care and safety, reasonably nonrestrictive confinement conditions,\nand such training as may be required by these interests.\" Id. at 324, 102 S.Ct. at 2462. To determine what is a\nreasonable level of care, courts were instructed only to \"make certain that professional judgment in fact was\nexercised,\" id. at 321, 102 S.Ct. at 2461, not to second-guess the outcome of that judgment. Applying \nYoungberg, the district court reviewed each category of services and conditions at GPW and found all of them to\ncomply with accepted standards of professional judgment. As to the particular services at issue here, the court\nfound that \"[c]urrent and former GPW patients are provided adequate community mental health services to meet\ntheir assessed functional and clinical needs in an integrated setting that is appropriate to those needs.\" It further\nfound that the State was \"providing an appropriate array and intensity of community services,\" and that \"all\naspects of the defendants' provision of community services comply with accepted professional standards of\ncare.\"\nAs the prevailing party, the State moved for an award of attorney fees and costs against the DOJ pursuant to\nCRIPA, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1997c(d). The request was referred to a Magistrate Judge, who recommended granting the\npetition for $351,139.45 in costs but denying the request for attorneys' fees on the grounds that CRIPA did not\nmandate an award of fees to prevailing defendants. The district court adopted the Magistrate Judge's Report and\nRecommendation and denied attorneys' fees. The State appealed, giving rise to Case No. 02-14670.\nOn July 20, 2001, the State filed a Supplemental Motion to Terminate Consent Decree, based on the district\ncourt's findings after the DOJ trial that the State was providing a constitutionally adequate level of care. Before\nthat motion could be decided, GPW officially closed as of February 11, 2002. The State followed up on February\n21, 2002, with a Supplemental Motion to terminate the decree, arguing that closure of GPW mooted any\noutstanding issues. The district court granted the State's motion to vacate in large part, but denied it as to three\nprovisions of the Consent Decree that are at issue here. In the Order, discussed in detail in Section II.A., which\nfollows, the court found that the State was not entitled to relief from those provisions 00 which concern the\n97\nplacement of former patients in community programs 00 because it had not shown that the violations of federal\n97\nlaw proscribed by the Consent Decree and Exit Criteria would not recur. The State appealed, giving rise to Case\nNo. 02-13499.\nII. DECISIONS BELOW\nA. The Consent Decree 00 Case # 02-13499\n97\nThe district court heard argument on May 23, 2002, on the State's Motion to Terminate Consent Decree and Exit\nCriteria Stipulation and its Supplemental Motion to Terminate Consent Decree. The court did not take evidence at\n\nthe hearing. The court issued its order on June 3, 2002, granting in part and denying in part the State's two\nmotions.\n1340 The district court found that the parties were in agreement that closure of GPW *1340 mooted most provisions of\nthe Consent Decree and Exit Criteria regarding conditions of hospitalization, and therefore granted the motions to\nvacate regarding those provisions. The court then turned to the three provisions disputed here. The court decided\nthat the proper legal framework for analyzing a motion to vacate a consent decree was set forth in United States\nv. City of Miami, 2 F.3d 1497, 1508 (11th Cir.1993), and Allen v. Alabama State Board of Education, 164 F.3d\n[3]\n1347, 1350 (11th Cir.1999). City of Miami and Allen employ a two-prong inquiry, under which the court first\nlooks to whether \"the basic purposes of the decree have been fully achieved.\" Allen, 164 F.3d at 1350. If so, the\ncourt then must find that \"there is no significant likelihood of recurring violations of federal law once the decree\nhas been lifted.\" Id. The court rejected the State's suggestion that the standard of Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk\nCounty Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 112 S.Ct. 748, 116 L.Ed.2d 867 (1992), should govern, because Rufo dealt with a\nmotion to modify a decree, not a motion to vacate. Applying the City of Miami framework, the court looked first to\nwhether the basic purposes of the decree had been achieved. The court focused on the State's argument that the\norder of June 28, 2001, following the DOJ trial (hereinafter, the \"Bench Trial Order\") was conclusive as to the\nState's compliance with the Consent Decree and exit standards. The court noted that the Bench Trial Order\nexpressly stated that the purpose of the trial was not to evaluate the State's obligations under the Consent\nDecree. However, the court acknowledged that its findings of fact 00 that the State was making appropriate\n97\ncommunity placements as of the time of the trial 00 suggested that basic purpose of the decree was being\n97\nachieved with respect to the patients hospitalized as of September 1999, and with respect to patients discharged\nas of that date.\nThe court further found, however, that even if the Bench Trial Order indicated that the basic purposes of the\ndecree were being achieved as of the time of the DOJ trial, that finding was not conclusive as to the \"great\nnumber\" of patients discharged between the trial and GPW's shutdown in February 2002. Because there was no\nevidence that those remaining patients had been discharged in compliance with the Community Compliance Exit\nCriteria, the court could not conclude that there was no significant likelihood of a recurring violation of federal law\nif the decree were lifted. Consequently, the court denied the State's motion to vacate the three disputed\nparagraphs of the decree.\nB. Attorneys' Fees 00 Case # 02-14670\n97\nThe district court issued its Order denying the State's request for attorneys' fees on August 5, 2002. In its Order,\nthe district court agreed with the Magistrate Judge that Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U.S. 412, 98\nS.Ct. 694, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978), provided the proper legal standard by which to evaluate the petition. Under \nChristiansburg, a prevailing defendant in a civil-rights action may be awarded attorneys' fees when it is shown\nthat the plaintiff's case was \"frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation,\" but the defendant need not show that\nthe case was actually brought in bad faith.\nThe court rejected the State's suggestion that the more lenient standard of Geier v. Richardson, 871 F.2d 1310\n(6th Cir.1989) 00 under which the prevailing party is presumptively entitled to attorneys' fees regardless of whether\n97\n1341 the case *1341 is shown to be frivolous 00 was appropriate when attorneys' fees are sought against the\n97\nGovernment in a CRIPA action. Instead, the court held that Christiansburg should provide the standard because:\n(1) the legislative history of CRIPA indicates that Congress intended for prevailing legal standards under other\ncivil-rights statutes to apply, which meant Christiansburg; (2) CRIPA's fee-shifting language is similar to that in\nother civil-rights statutes to which Christiansburg applies; and (3) the policy considerations behind Christiansburg\n00 to provide an incentive for aggrieved parties to enforce civil-rights laws and to punish wrongdoing defendants\n97\n00 were similarly applicable to CRIPA, thus indicating that attorneys' fees awards were principally intended for\n97\nprevailing plaintiffs and not defendants.\nApplying Christiansburg, the court agreed with the Magistrate Judge that the State had not shown that the DOJ's\ncase was frivolous. The court noted that the State did not even move for summary judgment, that the trial was\nsubstantive 00 lasting for 23 days and involving the testimony of numerous experts 00 and that the DOJ's case was\n97 97\n\nsupported by allegations of death or serious injury to many patients. The court rejected the State's contention that\nthe DOJ should have scaled back its claims upon learning of the imminent closure of GPW, because the hospital\nin fact remained open for two more years, during which time the allegedly unconstitutional conditions could have\n[4]\ncontinued to harm patients.\nIII. DISCUSSION\nA. The Consent Decree 00 Case # 02-13499\n97\nA consent decree is a judgment, and thus subject to Rule 60(b), which provides in part that a party may obtain\nrelief from a final judgment if \"the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon\nwhich it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should\nhave prospective application.\" Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b)(5). A party seeking modification of a consent decree bears a\nheavy burden of persuasion. See Sierra Club v. Meiburg, 296 F.3d 1021, 1034 (11th Cir. 2002) (\"A party seeking\nto modify a consent decree has a high hurdle to clear and the wind in its face.\"). Generally, however, indefinite\nfederal court oversight of state institutions is disfavored, and a federal court should terminate supervision once\nthe defendant comes into compliance with the law. See Ensley Branch, NAACP v. Seibels, 31 F.3d 1548,\n1574-75 (11th Cir.1994) (\"Remedial decrees should require the responsible officials to end their unconstitutional\naction posthaste. Remedial decrees should not foster prolonged oversight and management by the least\nrepresentative branch.\"). A district court's decision to modify, or not modify, a consent decree is reviewed for\nabuse of discretion. Jacksonville Branch, NAACP v. Duval County Sch. Bd., 978 F.2d 1574, 1578 (11th Cir.1992).\nWe review for clear error the findings of fact on which a modification decision is based. Id.\nThe thrust of the State's argument on appeal is that the district court should have vacated the Consent Decree\nbecause of changes of fact and law. With respect to the former, the State argues that the DOJ Bench Trial\nestablished that there are no longer constitutional violations, and that fact coupled with the closure of GPW,\nunder a proper application of the Rufo standard, warranted vacation of the Decree. The State also argues that \n1342 D.W. v.*1342Rogers, 113 F.3d 1214 (11th Cir.1997), constitutes a change of law and that, as a result of that\ndecision, states have no constitutional duty to provide mental health services after patients have been discharged\n[5]\nfrom state custody.  Finally, the State suggests that, in the absence of a violation of federal law, the district court\nmay have lacked jurisdiction to continue enforcing the decree. Specifically, the State contends that, in order to\napply the narrow exception to state Eleventh Amendment immunity for prospective injunctive relief recognized by \nEx parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908), the court must find that the defendant is\nengaged in an ongoing violation of federally protected rights.\nWe first address the district court's formulation of the City of Miami standard under which it assessed the State's\npetition for relief. We then turn to the court's application of that standard to the facts.\n1. The Rufo and City of Miami standards\nRufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 112 S.Ct. 748, 116 L.Ed.2d 867 (1992), involved a long-\nrunning class action by pretrial detainees challenging the conditions of their confinement, including overcrowding,\npoor sanitation, and cramped cells. The district court found that conditions at the jail were so onerous as to\nconstitute punishment without benefit of trial, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court set a deadline\nfor the county to cease using the substandard facility, and ordered that replacement facilities be readied. In\nresponse to that order, the parties entered into a consent decree that obligated the county to provide modernized\nhousing with specified amenities and living space. But during the pendency of the consent decree, two things\nhappened: first, jail population grew faster than expected, and second, the Supreme Court clarified the amount of\ninmate living space that was constitutionally required. These developments prompted the county to move to\nmodify the consent decree on the basis of changed circumstances.\nThe Court held that the rigorous showing required by United States v. Swift & Co., 286 U.S. 106, 52 S.Ct. 460, 76\nL.Ed. 999 (1932) for relief from a court-approved settlement agreement 00 \"[n]othing less than a clear showing of\n97\n\ngrievous wrong evoked by new and unforeseen conditions\" 00 was impractically rigid in dealing with institutional\n97\nreform litigation, because of the strong public interests at stake. Rather, the Rufo Court held, a decree can be\nmodified if the party seeking modification shows \"a significant change in circumstances\" 00 either of fact or of law\n97\n00 warranting revision. Rufo, 502 U.S. at 383, 112 S.Ct. at 760. If such showing is made, \"the court should\n97\nconsider whether the proposed modification is suitably tailored to the changed circumstance.\" Id. The Court\nelaborated on possible changed circumstances: (a) \"changed factual conditions make compliance with the\ndecree substantially more onerous\" than was contemplated; (b) the decree \"proves to be unworkable because of\nunforeseen obstacles,\" or (c) \"enforcement of the decree without modification would be detrimental to the public\ninterest.\" Id. at 384-85, 112 S.Ct. at 760.\nIn United States v. City of Miami, 2 F.3d 1497, 1508 (11th Cir.1993), we applied Rufo in the context of a motion to\n1343 modify *1343 or vacate a consent decree in a class-action discrimination case. In that case, the Justice\nDepartment sued the City of Miami, alleging that minorities and women suffered widespread employment\ndiscrimination in the fire department and other city agencies. The parties averted trial by entering into a consent\ndecree calling for reforms in the hiring and promotion process, which the district court entered as its judgment.\nSome years later, a firefighters' union 00 which was granted intervenor status 00 sought to modify or vacate the\n97 97\ndecree on the grounds that the decree had achieved its purpose of diversifying the fire department's ranks.\nIn considering whether to modify the decree, we observed 00 citing Rufo 00 that the first step was to determine the\n97 97\n\"basic purpose\" of the agreement. Id. at 1504. If the modification was directed to that basic purpose, it would\nlikely frustrate that purpose and was therefore impermissible; if it was directed only to \"one of several means of\naccomplishing the purpose ... or one of several means of measuring compliance,\" then it might be permitted. Id.\nat 1505.\nWe then evaluated whether the decree could be lifted rather than merely modified. We again began with the first\nprong of Rufo: determine the \"basic purpose.\" Then 00 citing Board of Education of Oklahoma City Public Schools\n97\n[6]\nv. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 111 S.Ct. 630, 112 L.Ed.2d 715 (1991),  which preceded Rufo by a year 00 we said:\n97\n[O]n remand, the district court must determine whether the decree's basic purpose of eliminating\nthe effects of past discrimination has been achieved .... In determining whether the decree's\npurpose has been fulfilled, the district court should consider whether the City has complied in\ngood faith with the decree and whether the vestiges of past discrimination have been eliminated to\nthe extent practicable.... In sum, termination of the consent decree would be appropriate if the\ndistrict court finds that the decree is clearly no longer necessary either to prevent discrimination in\nthe future or to remedy the effects of past discrimination.\nId. at 1508 (internal quotes omitted).\nIn the case at bar, the district court treated Rufo and City of Miami as mutually exclusive standards 00 the former\n97\napplicable only to requests to modify a decree, and the latter appropriate where a party seeks to be relieved from\nthe decree entirely. Accordingly, it applied only City of Miami. While we disagree with the district court's\n1344 characterization of these *1344 cases, its approach did not constitute reversible error, particularly in light of the\nnature of these Defendants' petition for relief.\nIn our view, the City of Miami formulation is merely a gloss or a method of applying Rufo, not a distinct standard. \nSee Bldg. & Constr. Trades Council v. NLRB, 64 F.3d 880, 888 (3rd Cir.1995) (applying Rufo to a request to\nmodify or terminate injunction, but enumerating flexible list of factors similar to those in City of Miami, including\n\"whether the party subject to its terms has complied or attempted to comply in good faith with the injunction; and\nthe likelihood that the conduct or conditions sought to be prevented will recur absent the injunction\"). City of\nMiami itself made no attempt to limit the application of Rufo or to distinguish it. The City of Miami court did not\ntreat the requests to modify and to vacate the consent decree as two analytically distinct matters; rather, it\ndiscussed them together. See2 F.3d at 1505 (\"We find that the principles articulated in Rufo and Dowell are\napplicable to requests to modify or terminate decrees in employment discrimination class actions, like the one\nbefore us.\") (emphasis added).\n\nTo put it another way, we do not read City of Miami as indicating that a district court is without authority to\nterminate a consent decree (as opposed to merely modifying it) if 00 to use Rufo's formulation 00 changed\n97 97\ncircumstances have caused compliance with the decree to become substantially more onerous, or have rendered\nthe decree impracticable, or its continued enforcement inimical to the public interest. Nor do we understand the\n[7]\ndistrict court to have believed its discretion was so constrained.  We therefore discern no prejudicial error in the\ndistrict court's method of analysis.\nThe State petitioned for relief from the decree principally based on the court's findings at the DOJ Bench Trial that\nGPW was providing a constitutionally adequate level of care. That development could be considered a change in\nlaw or fact (what the State would call a \"Rufo case\"), but it could just as easily be considered a finding of\nsubstantial compliance with the decree (what the State concedes would be a \"City of Miami\" case). This\nsubstantial overlap is one reason that we think it was inappropriate for the district court to attempt to draw a bright\nline between Rufo and City of Miami where none exists.\nThe situation is similar with respect to the closure of GPW. Again, while this claim could be viewed as one of\nchanged factual circumstances, it could also be treated as a claim of substantial compliance (in that all of the\npatients had been successfully discharged). Again, there is nothing inconsistent between City of Miami and Rufo,\n[8]\nand we find no reversible error in the district court's analysis.\n2. Substantive claims\nWe turn then to the State's substantive arguments. It argues that three post-decree developments of law and fact\nrequired the district court to vacate the remaining portions of the decree: (1) our decision in D.W. v. Rogers, 113\n1345 F.3d 1214 (11th Cir. 1997), addressing a state's obligation to provide mental health treatment to persons *1345 in\nlegal but not physical custody; (2) the Bench Trial Order, which found no ongoing violations of substantive due\nprocess in the provision of care at GPW; and (3) the closure of the hospital. The State argues that these\ndevelopments make it inequitable to continue enforcing the Decree (what the State labels a Rufo argument) and\nmake it unlikely that constitutional violations, if they occurred at all, will recur (its City of Miami argument). The\nState variously phrases its argument that the Decree should be vacated, sometimes arguing for lifting the Decree\nbecause there are no constitutional violations (and none likely), and sometimes arguing in quasi-jurisdictional\nterms (that the exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity recognized in Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct.\n441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908), requires an ongoing violation of a federally protected right).\nBefore turning to the substance of this argument, we address the threshold matter of the burden of proof. We\nreject the State's suggestion that the burden of proof should be placed on the Class Plaintiffs. To the contrary, the\nSupreme Court in Rufo clearly held that the burden of proof is on the party seeking modification of a consent\ndecree. Rufo, 502 U.S. at 393, 112 S.Ct. at 765 (\"[A] party seeking modification of a consent decree must\nestablish that a significant change in facts or law warrants revision of the decree and that the proposed\nmodification is suitably tailored to the changed circumstance.\"); accord City of Miami, 2 F.3d at 1504 (quoting \nRufo); see also Hodge v. Dep't of Housing & Urban Dev., 862 F.2d 859, 862 (11th Cir.1989) (holding that burden\nis on party seeking relief from final judgment under Rule 60(b) to establish grounds for relief). The State's\nconclusory assertions of lack of jurisdiction are unpersuasive.\nEven the Seventh Circuit cases on which the State relies hold that, in the context of a Rule 60(b) motion for relief\nfrom a consent decree, the burden is on the party seeking relief to establish that changed circumstances warrant\nrelief from the decree. See David B. v. McDonald, 116 F.3d 1146, 1149 (7th Cir.1997) (quoting Rufo: \"a party\nseeking modification of a consent decree bears the burden of establishing that a significant change in\ncircumstances warrants revision of the decree\"); accord United States v. Krilich, 303 F.3d 784, 789-90 (7th\nCir.2002); United States v. Rueth Dev. Co., 335 F.3d 598 (7th Cir. 2003). The district court properly placed the\nburden of proof on the State.\n\n(a) The D.W. decision\nThe State argues that D.W. v. Rogers, 113 F.3d 1214 (11th Cir.1997), constituted a change in the governing law\nwhich warrants termination of the Consent Decree. The State argues that it was completely absolved of all\nconstitutional duty and all responsibility once GPW was closed and the patients discharged from that hospital.\nFor several reasons, we decline the State's invitation to order a termination of the Consent Decree on this ground\nat this stage of the litigation.\nThe district court noted that the D.W. decision was distinguishable in that it did not involve a consent decree. The\nState's initial brief responds simply by asserting in conclusory fashion that that distinction is irrelevant. Because\nthe State offers no analysis or authority to guide our review, and because the matter has not been addressed by\n[9]\nthe district court, we decline to address the issue further.\n1346 *1346 In any event, even if the State could persuade us that it is completely absolved of any and all responsibility\nthe moment a patient is released from its physical custody (which of course we do not address and do not\ndecide), the State would still not be entitled to a termination of the Consent Decree at this stage. The State has\nacknowledged that, as to some undetermined subset of patients, their release from GPW did not end their stay in\nthe State's physical custody. For example, counsel for the State conceded at oral argument that approximately 90\npatients were considered too ill to be discharged when the time came to leave GPW, and were transferred to\n[10]\ncustodial settings in other state hospitals.  Consequently, because there was insufficient factual evidence that\nall discharged GPW patients were out of the State's physical custody 00 and indeed, a strong contrary indication\n97\nthat some were not 00 the State did not carry its burden of showing that none of the released patients had a\n97\ncontinuing due process right to adequate care, even under the State's reading of D.W. As a result, the State has\nnot established that no live controversy existed among the parties, or that further constitutional violations could\nnot occur.\nFinally, the State has failed to address the fact that the D.W. decision did not address the issue which the State\napparently wants to raise in the instant case. D.W. merely stands for the narrow proposition that a State's duty to\nprovide treatment does not begin until a state assumes physical custody of the person as well as legal custody.\nBy contrast, in the instant case, the state clearly assumed constitutional duties with respect to the patients by\nassuming physical custody. The issue here is the point at which such duty ends. We decline to address that novel\nand difficult issue for several reasons. The issue has been inadequately addressed in the briefs on appeal, and\nwas not addressed at all by the district court. Moreover, whether or not a release from physical custody relieves a\nstate of the duty it had assumed may depend upon the circumstances surrounding the release. See Wakefield v.\nThompson, 177 F.3d 1160 (9th Cir.1999); Davis v. Brady, 143 F.3d 1021 (6th Cir. 1998); see also Marsh v. Butler\nCounty, Ala., 268 F.3d 1014, 1039 n.19 & 20 (11th Cir.2001) (en banc). There is no record evidence at all with\nrespect to the discharge of patients from GPW from and after September 1999; it would be unwise to attempt\nresolution of the legal issue in the absence of concrete facts.\n(b) Closure of GPW\nOur foregoing discussion applies equally to the State's argument that the closure of GPW and release of all its\npatients terminates any live federal interest in continued enforcement of the decree. For the reasons above\nmentioned, the State has failed to establish that there are not ongoing constitutional violations and that none are\n1347 likely to recur; at this stage of the litigation the State has failed to carry its burden *1347 of proving that the\nalleged changes of fact and law warrant vacation or further revision of the Consent Decree.\n(c) The Bench Trial Order\nThe State argues that the DOJ Bench Trial established that there are no ongoing constitutional violations and\nnone likely to recur. We do not believe that the court's findings in the Bench Trial Order that conditions at GPW\nmet substantive due process standards were conclusive as to the separate proceeding challenged here.\n\nThe issue before the district court during the DOJ bench trial was a relatively discrete one: whether, as of\nSeptember of 1999, the State was violating the Fourteenth Amendment and the ADA by failing to protect patients\nfrom harm, failing to provide the level of care appropriate to meet the patients' liberty interests, and failing to\nensure that each patient was placed in the most appropriate setting for his needs upon release from the hospital.\nIn ruling on the instant motion, the district court acknowledged that, although the bench trial findings were not\nphrased in terms of compliance with the Consent Decree, the findings were tantamount to a declaration that\nconditions at GPW met the basic requirements of the decree with respect to the patients still hospitalized as of\nSeptember 1999 and with respect to patients discharged to less restrictive settings as of that date. However, the\ncourt further found that its observations about the level of care as of the bench trial did not conclusively establish\nthat the level of care was constitutionally adequate as of June 2002 or that violations could not recur. In particular,\nthe district court noted that the Bench Trial Order did not address at all the circumstances surrounding the\ndischarge of patients from GPW after September 1999. We agree.\nIn order for the findings at the bench trial to be preclusive in the separate proceeding at issue here, the State\nwould have to show that: (1) the issue was identical in both the prior and current action; (2) the issue was actually\nlitigated; (3) the determination of the issue was critical and necessary to the judgment in the prior action; and (4)\nthe burden of persuasion in the subsequent action is not significantly heavier than in the prior proceeding. \nAgripost, Inc. v. Miami-Dade County, 195 F.3d 1225, 1230 n.11 (11th Cir.1999); In re Bilzerian, 153 F.3d 1278,\n1281 (11th Cir. 1998). The State has failed to show that all prerequisites for the application of collateral estoppel\nwere met here.\nThe DOJ was required at the bench trial to prove its claims of ADA and Fourteenth Amendment violations by a\npreponderance of the evidence. Here, however, the State bore the burden of establishing grounds for relief in\nmoving to vacate the Consent Decree. Because of the differential burdens, a finding that the DOJ could not\ndemonstrate that the State was violating substantive due process or the ADA was not the same thing as saying\nthat the State could demonstrate affirmatively its satisfaction of its constitutional obligations. See Young & Co. v.\n[11]\nShea, 397 F.2d 185, 188 (5th Cir.1958)  (refusing to apply collateral estoppel to jury verdict in administrative\nproceeding before Commissioner of Labor over entitlement to workers' compensation benefits because \"the fact\nthat a worker could not convince a jury that he had suffered an injury should not estop him from attempting to\nconvince a Commissioner that he was injured inasmuch as the standard of persuasion is less before the\n1348 Commissioner than before the court\"); *1348accord In re St. Laurent, 991 F.2d 672, 677 (11th Cir.1993).\nEven more important, the issues in the DOJ bench trial and in this Rule 60(b) proceeding were not identical. In\nthe latter proceeding, the court was properly concerned not merely with whether the State had achieved\ncompliance with constitutional standards at one point, but whether it was presently in compliance. See Dowell,\n498 U.S. at 248, 111 S.Ct. at 637 (stating that court, in deference to local control of schools, should dissolve\ndesegregation decree \"after the local authorities have operated in compliance with it for a reasonable period of\ntime\"). Also, and significantly, the placement of patients recently discharged from GPW is a factual development\nsubsequent to, and distinct from, the events at issue in the DOJ trial. The Bench Trial Order therefore cannot be\n[12]\ndecisive as to whether the State was violating the constitutional rights of later-discharged patients.\nFor the foregoing reasons, the State has not yet established the absence of ongoing constitutional violations, \ne.g., with respect to those patients discharged since September 1999, and has not established that constitutional\nviolations will not recur. Because of this failure, the State's reliance upon Evans v. City of Chicago, 10 F.3d 474\n(7th Cir.1998) (en banc), and David B. v. McDonald, 116 F.3d 1146 (7th Cir.1997), is misplaced. In Evans the\nSeventh Circuit held that a consent decree should be vacated because of a subsequent change in the law; it was\ndetermined that the alleged equal protection violation and the alleged due process violation, which comprised the\nfederal claim upon which the consent decree was based, were wholly without merit, thus leaving no substantial\nclaim under federal law to sustain the consent decree. The decisive opinion in that case by Judge Ripple\nconcluded that that change of law made \"further enforcement of the consent decree by the district court\ninappropriate under the standards set forth by the Supreme Court in Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502\nU.S. 367, 112 S.Ct. 748, 762-64, 116 L.Ed.2d 867 (1992).\" Evans, 10 F.3d at 483. In David B. the Seventh Circuit\nheld that a subsequent change of law, the enactment of a state statute relieving the defendant agency of its\nauthority over certain juvenile treatment programs that were the subject of the consent decree, warranted either\n\nmodification or vacation of the consent decree. In remanding to the district court, the Seventh Circuit instructed\nthat the court should \"determine whether a substantial federal claim supports the decree as a whole; if not, the\nentire decree must be lifted.\" David B., 116 F.3d at 1150. Unlike Evans and David B., the State in the instant case\n1349 has failed to demonstrate the absence of a substantial federal claim[13]; the State has *1349 failed to\ndemonstrate the absence of an ongoing constitutional violation, and has failed to demonstrate that there is no\n[14]\nlikelihood that constitutional violation will recur.\n(d) Substantive Claims 00 Summary\n97\nIn sum, we conclude that the State bears the burden of establishing that changed circumstances warrant\nmodification or vacation of the Consent Decree. The State has failed at this stage of the litigation to establish that\nany of the after-occurring developments of law or fact on which the State relies would compel a district court to\ngrant more than the considerable measure of relief from the Decree that the court below extended. The State has\nfailed to establish that no live controversy existed, or that changed circumstances warrant vacation of the Decree,\nor that no violations of federally protected rights were occurring or likely to occur. Consequently, the district court\ndid not abuse its discretion in declining to terminate the remaining provisions of the Consent Decree.\nB. Attorneys' Fees 00 Case # 02-14670\n97\nThe State appeals the district court's order of August 5, 2002, denying its motion for an award of attorneys' fees.\nThe district court found that the State failed to make the showing required by Christiansburg Garment Co. v.\nEEOC, 434 U.S. 412, 98 S.Ct. 694, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978), which provides that a prevailing defendant in a civil-\nrights action may be awarded attorneys' fees when it is shown that the plaintiff's case was \"frivolous,\nunreasonable, or without foundation.\"\nThe State contends that, pursuant to the fee-shifting provision of CRIPA, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1997c(d), it was entitled as\n1350 the prevailing party to recover its legal fees from the DOJ. The State raises three lines of argument: *1350 (1) the\nplain language of ยง 1997c(d) indicates that the \"prevailing party\" is entitled to fees, regardless of whether the\nparty is plaintiff or defendant; (2) the district court erred in applying Christiansburg because the history and\npurpose of ยง 1997c(d) are unlike those of other fee-shifting provisions for which Christiansburg was coined, and\n(3) even if Christiansburg supplies the standard, the district court employed it erroneously, by too literally applying\nthe \"frivolity\" requirement and by failing to recognize the DOJ's vexatious litigation conduct.\nWe review a district court's decision to award or not to award attorneys' fees for abuse of discretion. Sayers v.\nStewart Sleep Ctr., 140 F.3d 1351, 1353 (11th Cir.1998); EEOC v. Reichhold Chem., 988 F.2d 1564, 1568 (11th\nCir.1993). Under the \"American Rule,\" the default assumption is that each party is responsible for its own legal\nfees, and thus fees ordinarily will not be awarded to the prevailing party without express statutory authority. \nBuckhannon Bd. & Care Home v. West Virginia Dep't of Health & Human Res., 532 U.S. 598, 602, 121 S.Ct.\n1835, 1839, 149 L.Ed.2d 855 (2001) (citing Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc'y, 421 U.S. 240, 247, 95\nS.Ct. 1612, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975)). Congress has chosen to modify the American Rule in numerous statutes,\nincluding the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1975, so as to provide for the\nprevailing party to recover its reasonable attorney fees from the loser.\nSection 1997c(d) is one such statute. It provides, in its entirety:\nIn any action in which the United States joins as an intervenor under this section, the court may\nallow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee against the\nUnited States as part of the costs. Nothing in this subsection precludes the award of attorney's\nfees available under any other provisions of the United States Code.\n42 U.S.C. ยง 1997c(d).\nIn Christiansburg, the Supreme Court held that, even where a statute is facially neutral as to which party can\nreceive attorneys' fees, two equitable considerations weigh in favor of a more lenient standard when awarding\n\nfees to the plaintiff as opposed to the defendant: first, the prevailing plaintiff is serving to vindicate important\nfederal rights as Congress' designated instrument of enforcement (the \"private attorney general\" rationale), and\nsecond, \"when a district court awards counsel fees to a prevailing plaintiff, it is awarding them against a violator\nof federal law.\" Id. at 418-19, 98 S.Ct. at 699.\n1. The State's Section 1997c(d) Argument\nThe State first argues that the CRIPA statute itself makes an award of attorneys' fees to a prevailing defendant\npresumptively appropriate. This argument overlaps with the following argument and will be dealt with principally\nin subsection (2), infra. It is enough to observe here that, because ยง 1997c(d) is permissive and not mandatory 00\n97\nit says the court \"may allow\" attorneys' fees 00 a fee award is not automatic. See Christiansburg, 434 U.S. at 418,\n97\n98 S.Ct. at 699 (interpreting same statutory term 00 \"may allow\" 00 in Title VII fee statute, and rejecting a similar\n97 97\nargument that prevailing defendant is presumptively entitled to award). Consequently, there must be standards to\nguide the district court's exercise of discretion. Thus the only real question is what legal standard governs, and\n[15]\nwhether the district court applied it properly.\n1351  2. Applicability of Christiansburg Standard\n*1351\nThe State's principal point is that ยง 1997c(d) is simply different from other fee-shifting statutes in wording and in\nintent, and thus the rules of interpretation governing those other statutes do not apply. Its argument begins with\nthe wording of the statute itself. Since the statute excludes the United States from receiving a fee award, and\nsince it speaks in terms of recovery of fees \"against the United States,\" the provision appears 00 unlike other civil-\n97\nrights statutes 00 to be intended solely for the benefit of prevailing defendants. Thus, the State argues, the\n97\nanalysis applied to other fee-shifting statutes, which are principally intended to benefit prevailing plaintiffs, is\nirrelevant. The State then argues that the purpose of fee-shifting provisions 00 to encourage private plaintiffs who\n97\nmay lack financing to take the lead in enforcing anti-discrimination laws as \"private attorneys general\" 00 does not\n97\napply to CRIPA, since it does not involve a private plaintiff of limited means. Therefore, the State contends, the\ncaselaw based on that policy should not control.\nWe do not entirely accept the State's logic. It does not necessarily follow that, because it is harder (or in this\ncase, impossible) for a prevailing plaintiff to get attorneys' fees, it should be easier for a prevailing defendant to\nobtain fees. In enacting CRIPA, Congress weighed the equities in favor of prevailing defendants by disqualifying\nthe Government from receiving fees even if it prevails. There is thus no compelling equitable reason for courts to\n[16]\nmake the system even more favorable to defendants.\nAs discussed infra, the state of the law when Congress enacted CRIPA was that prevailing defendants could\nqualify for attorneys' fees only by showing that the plaintiff's case was frivolous, unreasonable or without\nfoundation. \"The normal rule of statutory construction is that if Congress intends for legislation to change the\ninterpretation of a judicially created concept, it makes that intent specific.\" In re Colortex Indus., Inc., 19 F.3d\n1371, 1375 n. 2 (11th Cir.1994) (quoting Midlantic Nat'l Bank v. New Jersey Dep't of Envtl. Prot., 474 U.S. 494,\n501, 106 S.Ct. 755, 759, 88 L.Ed.2d 859 (1986)). If Congress wanted to lower the bar for a prevailing defendant\nunder CRIPA, it could and should have said so. We can infer no such intent from its silence.\nIt is probably true that the risk of having to pay the opponents' legal fees would be a greater deterrent to a private\nplaintiff than to the Justice Department, thus reducing the public-policy concerns that normally mitigate against\nmaking plaintiffs pay attorneys' fees. However, since only a government entity can be sued under CRIPA, the\nequities on the defendant's side are also weaker, as we need not worry that the expense of this litigation will put\nthe State of Florida out of business.\n1352 Outside of the intellectual property arena, which we find readily distinguishable[17]*1352 , the State has not\nidentified any federal statute similar to ours that presumptively entitles the prevailing defendant to attorneys' fees.\nTo the extent that the standard varies from Christiansburg at all, it varies in the other direction, making it harder\nfor defendants to obtain fees. See, e.g., Turlington v. Atlanta Gas Light Co., 135 F.3d 1428, 1437 (11th Cir.1998)\n\n(rejecting Christiansburg and applying \"bad faith\" requirement of Fair Labor Standards Act to defendant's request\nfor attorneys' fees under Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. ยง 626(b)). In light of this background\nof attorneys' fee law, we cannot infer from Congress' silence in CRIPA an intent to lower the established bar and\ncarve out a uniquely favorable standard for government defendants. Further, the other equitable factor in \nChristiansburg 00 that an award against a losing defendant, unlike a losing plaintiff, is an award against a federal\n97\nlawbreaker 00 still applies in the context of CRIPA. We therefore see no compelling equitable argument that\n97\nrequires altering the normal legal standard by which fees are awarded.\nSignificantly, Christiansburg itself involved an award against a federal agency 00 the EEOC 00 and this Circuit has\n97 97\ncontinued to apply the established standard in discrimination cases brought by the EEOC, with no indication that\na different standard should apply because the Government was the losing plaintiff. See Reichhold Chem., 988\nF.2d at 1571-72 (overturning district court's fee award because EEOC succeeded in presenting a prima facie\ncase of discrimination, indicating that its claims were not frivolous); EEOC v. Pet, Inc., 719 F.2d 383, 384-85 (11th\nCir. 1983) (stating that even though EEOC failed to establish prima facie case, its litigation strategy was not\nunreasonable and could have succeeded under different circumstances; thus, under Christiansburg, case was\nnot so frivolous as to support fee award).\nThe principal purpose of CRIPA was to promote the involvement of the Justice Department in institutional reform\nlitigation; the legislative history indicates that Congress recognized that the participation of the DOJ in disability\ndiscrimination cases was invaluable. See S.REP. No. 96-416 (1979) at 19-22, reprinted at 1980 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n787, 801-03 (discussing barriers to litigation faced by mentally disabled plaintiffs, and \"unique and invaluable\"\nrole of Attorney General in bringing class actions on their behalf). It thus is logical to interpret ยง 1997c(d) in para\nmateria with fee-shifting provisions in other discrimination statutes that were, similarly, designed to promote and\nreward the involvement of plaintiffs in furthering the statutes' intent.\nAlthough Christiansburg arose in a Title VII discrimination case, courts have applied its standard to other fee-\nshifting statutes, particularly those in the civil-rights arena (such as the ADA and the Voting Rights Act), which are\nworded similarly to the Title VII standard and to the ยง 1997c(d) standard at issue here. The statute applied in \nChristiansburg, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-5(k), states that \"the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party,\nother than the [EEOC] or the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee ... and the [EEOC] and the United States\nshall be liable for costs the same as a private person.\" Almost identical wording appears in ยง 1997c(d). Use of the\nsame or similar language in two fee-shifting statutes \"is a strong indication that they are to be interpreted alike.\" \nIndependent Fed'n of Flight Attendants v. Zipes, 491 U.S. 754, 759 n. 2, 109 S.Ct. 2732, 2735 n. 2, 105 L.Ed.2d\n[18]\n639 (1989) (internal quotes omitted).\n1353 *1353 The published legislative history on ยง 1997c(d) is extremely sparse. The Senate report states only: \"An\namendment was accepted ... which would allow the prevailing party other than the United States a reasonable\nattorney's fee at the discretion of the court.\" See S. REP. No. 96-416, at 31 (1979), reprinted at 1980\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 787, 813. A footnote adds: \"This provision is similar to that found in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964. See Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U.S. 412, 98 S.Ct. 694, 54 L.Ed.2d 648.\" See id. at 68, n.\n86, 1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 832. The House conference report, H. CONF. REP. No. 96-897 (1980), reprinted at\n1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. 832, says in explaining the fee-shifting provision: \"The award is discretionary with the court,\nand it is intended that the present standards used by courts under the civil rights laws will apply.\" See id. at 12,\n1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 837.\nThe DOJ argues that the reference to \"present standards\" in the House report, and the explicit citation to \nChristiansburg in the Senate report, leave no doubt that Congress contemplated application of Christiansburg,\nwhich was decided just two years earlier. The State contends, however, that the reference to \"present standards\"\ncould just as easily refer to the Supreme Court's decision in Newman v. Piggie Park Enter., Inc., 390 U.S. 400, 88\nS.Ct. 964, 19 L.Ed.2d 1263 (1968), which makes an award of fees the default assumption unless it is shown that\nan award would be \"unjust.\"\nPiggie Park, however, was a case in which a prevailing plaintiff sought attorneys' fees under Title II of the Civil\nRights Act. By its own terms, the case applies where the applicant for attorneys' fees has been successful in\nobtaining an injunction, see id. at 402, 88 S.Ct. at 966, which obviously refers to plaintiffs. That distinction was\n\nmade abundantly clear in Christiansburg, which cited and distinguished Piggie Park. See Christiansburg, 434\nU.S. at 418-19, 98 S.Ct. at 699 (\"[A]s emphasized so forcefully in Piggie Park, the plaintiff is the chosen\ninstrument of Congress to vindicate a policy that Congress considered of the highest priority.\") (internal quotes\nand citation omitted). Thus, it is apparent that by 1980, when Congress enacted CRIPA, the prevailing legal\nstandard for the award of attorneys' fees to a prevailing defendant was Christiansburg, not Piggie Park.\nThe State offers as an alternative standard to Christiansburg the Sixth Circuit's decision in Geier v. Richardson,\n1354 871 F.2d 1310 (6th Cir.1989).[19] We decline the *1354 State's invitation to adopt the reasoning of Geier, which\nfound Christiansburg inapplicable in the context of an unsuccessful complaint in intervention by the Government\nin a Title IX desegregation case. Geier is factually unlike our case. There, the Government opposed a consent\ndecree agreed upon between the private plaintiffs and the state. The Government lost its case against a state\ngovernment and the private plaintiffs. The private plaintiffs were suing to enforce their civil rights in a Title IX\ndesegregation case, and therefore were the private attorneys general seeking to enforce the statute, i.e., the\nparties whom the caselaw is reluctant to chill. Geier, 871 F.2d at 1314. Moreover, the Geier court saw the\nGovernment's litigation conduct as unusually egregious; the Government switched sides and attacked the parties'\nconsent decree after having supported it, thus forcing the original opposing parties to unite in defending it. Thus,\neven though the Sixth Circuit did not use the words \"frivolous\" or \"bad faith,\" attorneys' fees might well have been\njustified under Christiansburg.\nIn sum, we hold that Christiansburg is applicable to a claim for attorneys' fees under CRIPA. The same policy\narguments the State mounts here were applicable to Christiansburg, yet the Supreme Court obviously was not\npersuaded that a different set of standards should apply when the Government is the unsuccessful plaintiff.\n3. The District Court Correctly Applied the Christiansburg Analysis\nAs a fallback, the State argues that it was entitled to attorneys' fees even if Christiansburg applies. The State\ncontends that the district court erred in analyzing the Christiansburg factors by failing to take account of the\nDOJ's unreasonable litigation conduct, in particular its refusal to settle any claims even after learning of GPW's\nimminent shutdown.\nThat the DOJ lost on all counts does not, of course, establish frivolity by itself. Christiansburg cautioned against\nsuch hindsight bias:\n[T]he term meritless is to be understood as meaning groundless or without foundation, rather than\nsimply that the plaintiff has ultimately lost his case .... [I]t is important that a district court resist the\nunderstandable temptation to engage in post hoc reasoning by concluding that, because a plaintiff\ndid not ultimately prevail, his action must have been unreasonable or without foundation.\nId. at 421-22, 98 S.Ct. at 700. In EEOC v. Pet, Inc., 719 F.2d 383, 384 (11th Cir.1983), we interpreted \nChristiansburg's caution against second-guessing to require that, when determining whether a claim was or\nbecame frivolous, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-prevailing plaintiff. We have\nrecognized that the showing required to support a finding of frivolity is a \"stringent\" one, see Walker v.\nNationsBank of Fla., 53 F.3d 1548, 1558 (11th Cir.1995).\nThere is no dispute that our decision in Sullivan v. School Bd. of Pinellas County, 773 F.2d 1182 (11th Cir.1985),\nprovides the framework to assess whether a plaintiff's claim was frivolous for purposes of an attorneys' fees\naward. In Sullivan, a Title VII discrimination case, we set down \"general guidelines\" for analyzing the strength of\nthe plaintiff's case against the Christiansburg standard: \"(1) whether the plaintiff established a prima facie case;\n1355 (2) whether the defendant offered to settle; *1355 and (3) whether the trial court dismissed the case prior to trial\nor held a full-blown trial on the merits.\" Id. at 1189. The Sullivan court reversed the district court's award of legal\nfees, concluding that the plaintiff's case was not \"patently devoid of merit\" based on the facts that: the case\nsurvived a Rule 41(b) motion to dismiss; the defendant never moved for summary judgment; the plaintiff\nproduced anecdotal evidence that her supervisors were biased against women and Jews; and the plaintiff's own\ntestimony, if believed, would have supported a reasonable jury finding that she suffered from gender and religious\ndiscrimination.\n\nThe Sullivan factors here point, if anything, against an award of fees. The case was not dismissed before trial,\nand the Magistrate Judge found (and the district court agreed) that the DOJ established a prima facie case. That\nconclusion of fact is not clearly erroneous, for the reasons set forth in the district court's decision: the DOJ put\nforth expert testimony and documentation that, if believed, could have supported a reasonable trier of fact's\nfinding that the State was providing constitutionally inadequate care, and thus if the state had moved for\nsummary judgment, it would have been denied. There is no evidence that the State made a settlement offer that\nthe DOJ rejected, and the State does not so allege.\nThe State's only real evidence that the DOJ pursued an unreasonable litigation strategy is the fact that the DOJ\ndid not drop or amend claims in light of the planned closure of GPW. The trial court, however, found that the\nDOJ's conduct was reasonable given the lengthy period (two years) between the announcement and shutdown,\nand the concern for patient safety during the interim. Consequently, the district court's application of the \nChristiansburg/Sullivan factors was not clearly erroneous.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, and in light of the instant record or lack thereof, we cannot conclude that the district\ncourt abused its discretion in denying the State's Rule 60(b) motion for relief from the Consent Decree (Case No.\n[20]\n02-13499),  and we cannot conclude that the district court erred in its decision not to award attorneys' fees to\nthe State after the DOJ Bench Trial (Case No. 02-14670). Accordingly, the decisions below are\nAFFIRMED.\n[*] Honorable John F. Nangle, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri, sitting by\ndesignation.\n[1] The principal named Defendant, Bradley, is the former Superintendent of GPW. Because the suit is in\nsubstance one against the State of Florida, \"the State\" will be used to refer to the Defendants in the aggregate.\n[2] To cite but one example, one provision of the Exit Criteria, regarding the Defendants' obligation to install an\nelevator, stated: \"Delete consent decree requirement pursuant to agreement of Plaintiffs and Office of the\nMonitor.\"\n[3] The court recognized that Allen was vacated as a result of a settlement between the parties, see 216 F.3d\n1263 (11th Cir.2000), but still found its approach useful as persuasive authority for how the Circuit would treat a\nmotion to vacate.\n[4] The court agreed with the Magistrate Judge that the State was entitled to its court costs and litigation\nexpenses. That part of the Order is not challenged on appeal.\n[5]D.W. involved a substantive due process challenge to the state of Alabama's practice of \"wait-listing\" mentally\nill children who had been civilly committed to state custody for treatment of mental illness. The court held that,\nbecause the state had not yet assumed physical custody of the child plaintiffs 00 at most, it had legal custody 00\n97 97\nthe plaintiffs had no due process right to any particular level of treatment. See id. at 1218, 1220.\n[6]Dowell, like Rufo, was an \"institutional reform\" case, in that instance a desegregation case against the\nOklahoma City school system. The district court had entered an injunction directing the school district to adopt a\nbusing plan designed to integrate schools in single-race neighborhoods. After several years of active court\nsupervision, the court granted the school system's motion to close the case, but did not vacate the injunction.\nWhen the school system later sought to adopt a new school assignment system, a group of parents moved to\nreactivate court supervision under the injunction, alleging that the system was out of compliance. The district\ncourt denied the parents' motion and vacated the injunction, but the Tenth Circuit reversed, relying on the Swift\n\"grievous wrong\" standard. The Supreme Court, presaging Rufo, held that Swift was too inflexible a yardstick for\nassessing the continued usefulness of a consent decree involving school desegregation, because such decrees\n\nare necessarily temporary and require leeway for local innovation. Rather, the Court 00 in phrasing we adapted in \n97\nCity of Miami 00 formulated the proper inquiry as \"whether the [school system] had complied in good faith with the\n97\ndesegregation decree since it was entered, and whether the vestiges of past discrimination had been eliminated\nto the extent practicable.\" Dowell, 498 U.S. at 249-50, 111 S.Ct. at 638.\n[7] That the court fully understood the breadth of its discretion is evident in the fact that it did selectively vacate\nmost strictures of the Consent Decree, as the State requested, leaving in place only those substantive provisions\ngoverning discharges into community placement, as to which it was not satisfied the State had shown\ncompliance.\n[8]Rufo, by its terms, applies where compliance with the terms of a decree becomes substantially more onerous\nor impracticable because of changed circumstances. Here, the State's claim is just the opposite 00 that later\n97\ndevelopments in effect lowered the burden of compliance so that there was nothing left for the decree to\naccomplish.\n[9] Similarly, the State asserts in conclusory fashion that the Exit Criteria are unenforceable. Again, we decline to\naddress this argument which has also not been addressed by the district court. To the extent that the State is\nasserting as a factual matter that the Exit Criteria were not adopted by the district court as an amendment or\nsupplement to the Consent Decree, we prefer that the district court interpret its own order in the first instance. To\nthe extent that the State is asserting some unspecified legal argument, we would insist that the State articulate\nany such argument clearly, and support same with analysis and authorities; and in any event, we would prefer for\nany such argument to be addressed in the first instance by the district court.\n[10] Aside from this comment at oral argument, the record is absolutely silent with respect to the placement of the\npatients discharged since the September 1999 cut-off date for the DOJ litigation, and with respect to the\nplacement of other patients as to which there is some record evidence, the district court has not addressed\nwhether any or all of such placements constitute physical custody in the state vel non. See, e.g., Taylor v.\nLedbetter, 818 F.2d 791, 795-96 (11th Cir.1987) (en banc).\n[11] In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981), this Circuit adopted as binding precedent\nall decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to the close of business on September 30, 1981.\n[12] In addition, the constitutional violations alleged by the original class plaintiffs and those alleged by DOJ were\nnot coextensive; for instance, the class plaintiffs alleged both procedural and substantive due process violations,\nwhile the DOJ complaint in intervention alleged only that substantive due process was violated. When the district\ncourt held in the Bench Trial Order that no constitutional violations were occurring, its holding was necessarily\nlimited to substantive due process; anything further would be beyond the DOJ complaint and thus not \"critical and\nnecessary\" to the judgment. Therefore, the State has not shown that the court's finding in the DOJ case that the\nState was providing a constitutionally adequate level of care addressed every constitutional violation to which the\nConsent Decree was directed.\n[13] Moreover, the State has not argued in its brief on appeal that the \"substantial federal claim\" referred to in \nEvans and David B. should be strictly construed to embrace only direct and proven constitutional violations as\nopposed to related provisions of the Consent Decree. In other words, the State has not argued that there is\ntension between Evans and David B., on the one hand, and the Supreme Court's decision in Rufo:\nFederal courts may not order States or local governments, over their objection, to undertake a course of conduct\nnot tailored to curing a constitutional violation that has been adjudicated.... But we have no doubt that, to \"save\nthemselves the time, expense, and inevitable risk of litigation,\" ... petitioners could settle the dispute over the\nproper remedy for the constitutional violations that had been found by undertaking to do more than the\nConstitution itself requires ... [so long as the same] was related to the conditions found to offend the Constitution.\n502 U.S. at 389, 112 S.Ct. at 762-63. Because no such argument was raised by the State, and any possibly\nrelated argument was inadequately briefed, we do not address it. If raised on remand, we prefer for the district\ncourt to address the issue in the first instance.\n\n[14] Because we reject the State's contention that the Bench Trial Order conclusively determined that the State\nhad met all of its obligations to provide a constitutionally appropriate level of care, we do not reach the State's\nsucceeding argument 00 which was entirely dependent on the faulty premise 00 that a court loses jurisdiction to\n97 97\nenforce compliance with a consent decree settling constitutional claims as soon as the defendant crosses the\nthreshold of constitutionally acceptable performance, regardless of whether the decree purports to require more.\nWe note that the Supreme Court has recently heard arguments in a case on the closely related issue of whether\nthe Eleventh Amendment is waived when a state enters into a consent decree to settle an unlitigated case in\nwhich prospective injunctive relief is sought under the doctrine of Ex parte Young, supra. See Frazar v. Gilbert,\n300 F.3d 530 (5th Cir.2002),cert. granted sub nom., Frew v. Hawkins, ___ U.S. ___, 123 S.Ct. 1481, 155 L.Ed.2d\n223 (2003). Frazar is not our case, because it arose in the setting of a motion by the plaintiff class members to\nenforce the terms of the decree. The case was therefore not evaluated under Rufo; rather, the burden was\nproperly placed upon the plaintiffs to demonstrate the violation of a federally protected right justifying relief. See \nFrazar, 300 F.3d at 543. Nevertheless, the Court's answer to the Eleventh Amendment question posed in Frazar\ncould provide guidance in our related inquiry. We therefore are especially hesitant to venture a gratuitous\ninterpretation.\n[15] As the State acknowledges, courts have routinely read standards into similar discretionary fee-shifting\nstatutes even where none appears. See, e.g., Bruce v. City of Gainesville, 177 F.3d 949 (11th Cir.1999) (applying\nChristiansburg dual standard to Americans with Disabilities Act fee-shifting provision, 42 U.S.C. ยง 12205, which\nspeaks neutrally in terms of allowing a reasonable attorneys' fee to the \"prevailing party\"). Therefore, the fact that\nthe statute contains no \"frivolity\" language does not mean that a court cannot impose such a standard consistent\nwith the statute.\n[16] Congress has already built an extra measure of protection into CRIPA for defendants by empowering the\nDOJ to intervene only in cases where there are \"egregious or flagrant conditions\" causing \"grievous harm.\" 42\nU.S.C. ยง 1997(a).\n[17]See infra note 18.\n[18] The State argues that courts sometimes have declined to apply the Christiansburg standard to fee-shifting\nstatutes worded similarly to ยง 1997c(d). However, its principal example is the copyright statute, 17 U.S.C. ยง 505,\nwhich is unlike CRIPA in purpose or history. In Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., 510 U.S. 517, 114 S.Ct. 1023, 127\nL.Ed.2d 455 (1994), the Supreme Court found that frivolity was not a prerequisite to an award of attorneys' fees\nto a prevailing defendant in a Copyright Act suit because: (1) the Copyright Act language was enacted in 1976,\nbefore Christiansburg became the accepted legal standard; (2) all other intellectual property statutes have \"loser\npays\" regimes which are party-neutral; (3) the goal of the Copyright Act was not to promote or reward public-\ninterest litigation; and (4) unlike in civil-rights suits, it is unlikely that plaintiffs in copyright suits will be indigent.\nOnly the fourth concern arguably applies in our case, because of the Justice Department's financial resources.\n[19] The State also suggests in its briefs on appeal that the Court look for guidance to the Equal Access to\nJustice Act, 28 U.S.C. ยง 2412(d), which presumptively entitles the prevailing party to an award of fees unless the\nopponent's position is \"substantially justified\" or \"special circumstances\" make an award unjust 00 a standard the\n97\nState describes as more favorable The State concedes, however, that the EAJA by its terms does not apply to\nthis case and is of instructive value only. The State did not argue for application of the EAJA standard below.\nIndeed, its brief to the Magistrate Judge mentioned the EAJA only fleetingly and by way of distinction, in arguing\nthat the State should automatically recover its fees without surmounting any additional barrier. Because the EAJA\nargument presented here was not properly raised below and was not addressed by the district court, we decline\nto address it here in the first instance.\n[20] We sympathize with the State's desire to be freed from the court supervision inherent in the Consent Decree.\nWe fully expect the State will renew its motion for relief after marshaling evidence as to the patients discharged\nfrom GPW since September 1999, and we are confident that the district court will entertain such a motion,\nconduct appropriate evidentiary hearings, and render its decision after receiving the guidance of adequate\nbriefing.\n\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
