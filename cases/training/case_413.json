    "summary": "<p>On December 15, 1976, residents of the Northampton State Hospital in Massachusetts filed a class action lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 against the State of Massachusetts in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had violated their constitutional rights by failing to provide them with suitable treatment under the least restrictive conditions, by discriminating against them with respect to benefit allocation pursuant to federal statutory programs, failing to provide alternative housing arrangements, failing to provide adequate mental health care, and failing to provide programming for them.  </p><p>On January 6, 1978, the parties entered into a Consent Decree in the case.  The Decree provided for changes in the areas of programming, staffing, transportation, vocational training, job placement, medical care, counseling, provision of alternative care environments and housing arrangements, funding, and mental health care requirements.  </p><p>On March 19, 1981, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts (Judge Frank Harlan Freedman) found that the defendants had failed to comply with the terms of the Consent Decree by failing to release funding for the programs specified by the Decree in a timely manner.  The Court ordered the defendants to release the funds and to account for all expenditures.  The defendants appealed.</p><p>On August 19, 1981, the District Court (Judge Freedman) held that the plan proposed by the defendants for retraining all hospital and community employees was inadequate.  The Court then ordered the state to develop a plan for a system of independently and legally trained advocates, all of whom would be paid by the state and capable of representing clients in connection with legal issues arising from their disability or status of prior or concurrent institutionalization.  Brewster v. Dukakis, 520 F.Supp. 882 (D.Mass. 1981).  The defendants appealed.  </p><p>On November 16, 1981, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (Judges Levin Hicks Campbell, Hugh Henry Bownes, and Stephen Gerald Breyer) issues a temporary injunction to stay the District Court's order that the defendants must immediately release funding pursuant to the consent decree.  On December 23, 1981, the District Court (Judge Freeman) issued an order compelling defendants to implement certain provisions of the Consent Decree and extending the time that the defendants had to obtain funding.  The defendants appealed.  </p><p>On March 24, 1982, the First Circuit (Judge Frank Morey Coffin) upheld the District Court's order with the modification that the defendants could not be required to go beyond what their good-faith professional best efforts could reasonably be expected to accomplish.  Brewster v. Dukakis, 675 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1982).  </p><p>On June 28, 1982, the First Circuit (Judge Breyer) vacated the District Court's order regarding the provision of a legal services program, holding that the District Court had no legal authority to require the Commonwealth to pay for a broad legal services program for people who are mentally ill or have an intellectual disability.  Brewster v. Dukakis, 687 F.2d 495 (1st Cir. 1982).</p><p>On July 16, 1982, the District Court (Judge Freedman) ordered the defendants to pay $386,204.01 in attorneys' fees to the plaintiffs.  Brewster v. Dukakis, 544 F.Supp. 1069 (D.Mass. 1982).  The defendants appealed.  On March 14, 1986, the First Circuit (Judge Coffin) affirmed the District Court's attorney fee award, with a $5000 reduction of the fee.  Brewster v. Dukakis, 786 F.2d 16 (1st Cir. 1986).</p><p>On March 12, 1987, the District Court (Judge Freedman) issued an order of disengagement, finding that the parties had substantially complied with the Consent Decree and holding that the case would be closed within three years if the Court found that the Decree had been fully accomplished within that time period.  </p><p>On January 6, 1992, the District Court vacated the Consent Decree and dismissed the case.  </p><p></p>",

INTRODUCTION\nThe disputes before this Court arise from differences in interpretation of the Consent Decree entered in this case\non December 7, 1978.\nIn order to understand the position of the Court, a brief summary of the history and contents of the Decree is\nnecessary.\nThe Complaint in this matter was filed in December 1976. The Decree was born out of two years of intense\nnegotiation between the parties. The Court was completely neutral in this process, in no way compelling\nagreement; every substantive or procedural obligation contained in the Decree has been voluntarily assumed by\nthe parties, with the full knowledge that their agreement as ratified by this Court would constitute a binding order.\nParagraph 4 of the Decree binds not only the Decree's signors but their successors and employees as well.\n884 The target of this Decree is one of the most vulnerable and chronically abused segments *884 of our society:\n[1]\nthose labelled mentally ill and mentally retarded.  Specifically, the plaintiff class is defined in Paragraph 7 of the\nDecree as \"all persons who were, as of December 15, 1976, are, or may be hospitalized at the Northampton\nState Hospital, including those persons on indefinite visit or conditional discharge during that period.\"\nThe catchment area of Northampton State Hospital is Region One of the State Department of Mental Health\n(DMH). It includes all of Hampshire, Franklin, Hampden, and Berkshire counties, and a small portion of\nWorcester County. A shorthand definition of the plaintiff class then might be: all persons in the western third of the\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts with mental health needs severe enough to qualify them for potential\nhospitalization.\nThe Decree estimates that this group comprises approximately 2,135 persons during any two-year planning\n[2]\nperiod.  A further group of 3,588 persons is designated the \"at-risk subpopulation\"00those persons who might\n97\nfind themselves in need of hospitalization if services available in December 1978 were cut back. See Attachment\nA of the Decree, and paragraphs 8c and 8d.\n\nAs might be expected with such a large group spread over such a broad and diverse geographic area, a wide\nrange of disabilities is exhibited. Some class members suffer from chronic mental illness, having been\nhospitalized for thirty, forty, or in some cases in excess of fifty years. Others are suffering an acute episode which\nmay respond quickly to treatment and never be repeated. Still others are \"revolving door\" clients whose illness\nmay lead them to multiple, short admissions in any two-year period. Juveniles are treated in this system as well\nas geriatrics, whites as well as minorities. A few class members have histories of violence; the overwhelming\nmajority offer a risk only to themselves, if anyone.\nThe body of the Decree and its attachments describe00and require00a dramatic transformation in the method of\n97 97\ncare for plaintiff class members. The defendants bind themselves to create no less than \"a comprehensive\nsystem of appropriate, less restrictive treatment, training and support services for each member of the plaintiff\nclass ....\" Decree at paragraph 3.\nThe distinctive quality of the Decree lies in the commitment to treatment in a \"comprehensive community mental\nhealth and retardation system,\" with three components: residential environments which are \"the least restrictive\nand most normal setting appropriate for each resident or client\"; non-residential programs designed to provide\n\"the major daily activity for those clients whose residential environment does not provide the total treatment\nprogram, as well as for other members of the plaintiff class who live independently in the community\"; and\nmanagement services to oversee residential and non-residential programming. See Decree at Paragraph 8a.\nProbably the most concrete ramification of the Consent Decree from the point of view of the service recipient or\n\"client,\" is the transfer of mental health services from a large, state-run centralized institution to scores of much\nsmaller, private community-based service facilities, spread out over the Region. These non-profit organizations\nvary widely in their size, experience, funding, administrative structure, staffing patterns and theories of treatment.\nAlthough some state personnel work in these programs, most personnel in the community system is private and\ntherefore not subject to civil service regulations.\nThese agencies administer a wide variety of programs. Twelve distinct types of residential programs are\n885 described in Attachment B to the Decree. At least fourteen *885 types of non-residential services are described in\nAttachment C.\nThe Decree, in addition, makes heavy demands on DMH's administrative structure. Specific provisions are made\nin the Decree for the development of Individual Service Plans (ISPs) to insure the complete evaluation and\nappropriate treatment of clients (paragraphs 26 to 31); for the drafting of governing regulations (paragraphs 32\nand 33); for monitoring and evaluation of the system (paragraphs 38 to 40); and for the reorganization and\nphase-down of the Hospital (paragraphs 41 to 46).\nThe parties bind themselves in signing the Decree to the ongoing supervision of the Court both in the general\nimplementation process and with regard to specific outstanding issues not finally resolved by the parties in the\nnegotiation process. Paragraph 6 of the Decree states:\nJurisdiction is retained by the Court until further order, to enable any party to apply at any time for\nsuch further orders as may be necessary or appropriate for the interpretation, implementation,\nenforcement or modification of the terms of this Decree and for supervision and approval of the\nresolution of issues left for further planning and negotiation.\nAs will be seen, the issues left for further planning and negotiation00with supervision and approval of the\n97\nCourt00include some of the most crucial features of the Decree.\n97\nFinally, the plaintiffs and defendants have agreed to the appointment of an independent Monitor, responsible only\nto the Court, with a right of access to all information, records, residential environments, and program areas. The\nparties bind themselves to the proposition that, with certain limitations, the Monitor has the final word with regard\nto individual complaints and the power to make recommendations to the Court on any issue related to\nimplementation of the Consent Decree. These recommendations become final and binding unless a Court\nhearing is requested by a party. See paragraphs 51-60.\n\nRealizing perhaps that disagreements would arise during the implementation process the parties have given the\nCourt in paragraph 50 extremely broad powers. This paragraph states:\nThe defendants agree to take all necessary actions to insure full and timely compliance with the\nprovisions of this Decree. The parties recognize that there may arise during the implementation of\nthis Decree, difficulties beyond the control of the defendants which may inhibit timely\naccomplishment of certain of its terms. Whenever the parties or the Monitor determine that such\ndifficulties have arisen and significantly threaten implementation, the problem may be brought to\nthe Court for its attention.\nOver the past three years progress has been made in establishing the community mental health system. Non-\nresidential and residential programming in the community has greatly expanded. Census at the Hospital has\ngone down. The administrative capacity of the Department of Mental Health has increased.\nOn the other hand, the concrete problems of implementation have to some extent undermined the ambitious\npromises of the Decree. The development of residential, non-residential and administrative components has\noften occurred only after long delays. Hospital census, which was originally intended to be at 50 by June 30,\n1981, is still well over 200. Regulations have emerged tardily. The drafting of Individual Service Plans is at least\neighteen months behind schedule.\nObviously, the creation of a community mental health system that provides treatment in settings that are more\ntailored to the client, more homelike and less restrictive can have enormous advantages. These settings can\nprovide more appropriate care, with fewer of the dangers of long-term institutionalization and an enhanced\nenjoyment of basic civil liberties. It is equally obvious that a poorly designed or poorly implemented community\nmental health system leaves the client isolated, less visible and even more vulnerable to neglect and abuse. It is\n886 against this backdrop that the *886 controversy before the Court should be seen.\nThe current disputes between the parties center on the interpretation and application of two paragraphs of the\nDecree: paragraph 59, which addresses the subject of trained, independent advocates for clients; and paragraph\n35, which addresses the subject of appropriate orientation, retraining and ongoing development of Hospital staff\nand employees of community programs. Both these issues were left unresolved in the negotiation process\nleading to the Decree. An evidentiary hearing was held on the question of advocacy on July 16, 1981 and on the\nsubject of training on August 4, 1981.\nII. POWERS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE COURT\nA consent decree, speaking generally, has the quality of a contract between or among the parties entering into it;\nat the same time a decree, when ratified by the court, is a court order and calls into play the exercise of the\ncourt's equitable powers.\nThe Supreme Court has stated:\nBecause the defendant has, by the decree, waived his right to litigate the issues raised, a right\nguaranteed to him by the Due Process Clause, the conditions upon which he has given that\nwaiver must be respected, and the instrument must be construed as it is written and not as it\nmight have been written had the plaintiff established his factual claims and legal theories in\nlitigation.\nUnited States v. Armour and Company, 402 U.S. 673, 681, 91 S.Ct. 1752, 1757, 29 L.Ed.2d 256 (1971).\nThus, a court would not be justified in imposing some additional burden on the defendants, or substantially\nchanging the terms, to justify some inferred \"purpose\" of a consent decree. United States v. ITT Continental\nBanking Company, 420 U.S. 223, 235, 95 S.Ct. 926, 933, 43 L.Ed.2d 148 (1974).\nAt the same time, the agreement of the parties does not extinguish the equitable or supervisory powers of the\ncourt. It is settled that the court retains the authority to resolve ambiguities in the language of a decree. United\n\nStates v. Armour, supra, at 681, 91 S.Ct. at 1757; EEOC v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 611 F.2d 795, 798 (10th Cir.\n1979),cert. denied,446 U.S. 952, 100 S.Ct. 2918, 64 L.Ed.2d 809 (1980). Where changed legal or factual\nsituations make it necessary, courts even retain the power to make modifications of a decree. United States v.\nSwift and Company, 286 U.S. 106, 114, 52 S.Ct. 460, 462, 76 L.Ed. 999 (1932); Gomes v. Moran, 605 F.2d 27,\n30 (1st Cir. 1979).\nIn the Swift case, Justice Cardozo stated:\nThe result is all one whether the decree has been entered after litigation or by consent .... In either\nevent, a court does not abdicate its mandate if satisfied that what it has been doing has been\nturned through changing circumstances into an instrument of wrong.\n286 U.S. at 114-115, 52 S.Ct. at 462.\nTo summarize, the parties to a decree may rest confident that they bind themselves only to what is agreed upon,\nprovided that they are aware of the court's inherent supervisory role. The court, in the act of transforming a\nsimple agreement between two parties into a court order00and inevitably placing the dignity of the court and its full\n97\nrange of sanctions behind the decree00 may be confident that it retains some equitable powers of supervision,\n97\nprovided that these powers are exercised in a way that is sensitive to the parameters of the parties' original\nagreement.\nTurning specifically to this Consent Decree, the Court finds its inherent powers ratified and dramatically \nexpanded by the Decree's very provisions. Paragraphs 5 and 6 explicitly recognize that certain issues have\nevaded \"final, substantive settlement\" and that the Court's supervision and approval of the resolution of these\nissues is necessary. These unresolved issues are not trivial. They include: determination of need for and design\n887 of a secure treatment setting for those clients not appropriate for community placements (paragraph 16); the *887\ncontent of a plan for orientation, retraining and ongoing development of Hospital staff and employees of\ncommunity programs (paragraph 35); the content of a reorganization and phasedown plan for the Hospital\n(paragraph 43); the need for, role of and funding for trained, independent advocates for clients (paragraph 59).\nThe failure to resolve definitively any one of these issues would create a gap in the Consent Decree and render\nits full implementation almost impossible.\nParagraph 6 of the Decree also confers on the Court not only ongoing jurisdiction but also the power to render\n\"such further orders as may be necessary and appropriate for the interpretation, implementation, enforcement or\nmodification of the terms of this Decree ....\" Paragraphs 50 through 61 of the Decree establish in broad terms the\npowers of the Court and of the court-appointed Monitor.\nIn short, the Court's supervisory authority permeates the Decree, not only through its inherent equitable powers,\nbut also by the express choice of the parties.\nIII. LEGAL ADVOCACY\nA. The Interpretation of Paragraph 59\nParagraph 59 of the Decree states as follows:\nThe Monitor will investigate and determine the necessity for trained, independent advocates to\nassist clients in the protection of their rights as set forth in relevant statutes, regulations, and the\nprovisions of this Decree, including the attachments hereto. The Monitor will submit his\nrecommendation to the parties and the Court by January 1, 1980, on the appropriate role of and\nfunding for such independent advocacy. The plaintiffs and defendants agree to cooperate in\ninvestigating sources of funding and in seeking federal funds to establish and maintain an\nadvocacy system, to the extent such is determined to be appropriate.\nIn compliance with the first sentence of this paragraph, the court-appointed Monitor submitted his report and\nrecommendations to this Court. A copy of the report is appended to this Memorandum as Appendix A.\n\nIn summary, the report finds that trained, independent advocates are necessary, and that effective advocacy\nservices will disappear after June 1982. The report makes additional recommendations regarding the general\ncomposition of the advocacy apparatus: that it must be paid and fulltime, include attorneys and lay advocates,\nhave access to records, include clients themselves to the extent possible and be free from undue outside\ninfluence. Finally, the report recommends that the defendants be required to fund the advocacy system and\nreport to the Court with a timetable and budget \"that will assure no discontinuity of advocacy services within the\nRegion.\"\nWith the permission of the Court and the parties, the Monitor's report was submitted over a year later than was\noriginally required by the Decree. The delay permitted the employment of an expert consultant, Dr. Stanley S.\nHerr, who prepared and submitted an extensive report on the need for advocacy services, advocacy models, and\npotential funding sources. The Herr Report, which was also prepared for the assistance of the Court, Tauro, J., in \nMassachusetts Association for Retarded Citizens v. Dukakis (Nos. 75-5023-T and 75-5210-T), is part of the\nrecord of this case. The Herr report fully supports the findings and recommendations of the Monitor.\nThe Monitor's report to the Court was circulated to the parties and they were asked to respond to each of the\nreport's seven recommendations, indicating support or disagreement. The plaintiffs' response generally\nsupported the recommendations. The defendants' initial response, after a month delay, was to oppose the final\ntwo recommendations00which placed the responsibility for funding advocacy on the defendants00and to decline to\n97 97\nagree or disagree with the other five recommendations. The defendants were not willing to take a position on the\nneed for advocacy, only denied their responsibility to fund it.\n888 *888 More recently, the defendants appear to have altered their position, now contesting the need for advocacy\nservices beyond those currently provided. They have continued to assert vigorously that the Decree neither\nimposes an obligation to fund advocacy services, nor gives the Court the power to impose such an obligation on\nthem.\nCertainly the defendants are right that the Decree does not explicitly impose on them the responsibility to fund\nadvocacy services.\nIt is equally clear that the defendants are wrong about the powers conferred by the Decree on the Court. As\nnoted, the question of advocacy services is one of the issues in the Decree left open, whose resolution is left\nsubject to the supervision and approval of the Court, under paragraph 6 of the Decree. Moreover, as to this issue,\nthe Court's Monitor is given important responsibilities. He is to \"determine the necessity\" for advocates and make\na recommendation to the Court \"on the appropriate role of and funding for such independent advocacy.\"\nThe Court holds that this paragraph along with the other enabling provisions of the Decree gives to the Court the\npower to accept or reject the Monitor's recommendations and, if the recommendations are accepted, order them\nto be carried out. To the extent that the paragraph contains any ambiguity on this point, the Court hereby\nexercises its supervisory power to remove the ambiguity. Any other interpretation of the Decree would leave the\nCourt without the power to intervene where the inability of the parties to negotiate a resolution of an outstanding\nissue would undermine the expeditious implementation of the Decree and render it an incomplete document.\nThe defendants argue that their responsibilities are confined to those set out in the third sentence of the\nparagraph: \"to cooperate in investigating sources of funding and in seeking federal funds to establish and\nmaintain an advocacy system ....\" It is their position that, even after making appropriate findings, no power would\nlie in the Court to place responsibility to provide advocacy on the defendants.\nIt flows from this argument that the recommendations of the Monitor to the Court would have no significance if\nthey were rejected by the defendants. It also follows that the Court's role in providing supervision and approval of\nthe resolution of outstanding issues would be entirely passive: the Court would have no power to order a\nresolution and the defendants would have the power to permanently block resolution of this and other critical\nareas of the Decree simply by refusing to agree.\nThis interpretation of the Decree is both dangerous and incorrect. It belies both the obvious intent of paragraph\n59 and the other provisions of the Decree. Moreover, it derogates from the inherent equity power of the Court in\n\nsupervising the implementation of the Decree. Clearly, the final sentence of paragraph 59 was intended to\nimpose an additional task on the defendants, not define their exclusive responsibility.\nThe Court holds that it has the power within the four corners of the Decree as interpreted, as well as in the\nexercise of its general equitable and supervisory powers, to order the defendant to design and fund a system of\nadvocacy for the plaintiff class members00provided that it supports this exercise of power with appropriate\n97\nfindings of fact determined after hearing at which the defendants are given full opportunity to argue and present\nevidence, as was done in this case.\nB. Factual Findings\nThe plaintiff class members involved in this lawsuit are particularly vulnerable to invasions of their legal rights.\nFirst, they suffer the normal handicap of all economically disadvantaged persons00 the inability to purchase legal\n97\nrepresentation.\nSecond, they suffer from the stigma of association with a State mental hospital, which renders them uniquely\nexposed to prejudice in housing, employment, access to generic services and in many other areas.\n889 *889 Third, this group has unique problems in recognizing and asserting its legal rights due to cognitive\nlimitations or impaired ability to communicate. Many chronically hospitalized clients may become either so\npassive as a result of decades of confinement or medication, or become so fearful of authority, that they may lose\nthe ability either to protect themselves or obtain protection.\nFourth, the sheer variety of the clients puts unique demands on any advocacy system: old and young, white and\nminority, chronic and acute, mentally ill and retarded are all contained within the class served under the Decree.\nFifth, the geographic spread of the clients, from the urban areas of Springfield to the rural areas of Berkshire\nCounty makes it extremely difficult to keep track of clients. Clients have the tendency00to use a phrase frequently\n97\nheard during the implementation of this Decree00to \"fall through the cracks\" as they move from a large,\n97\ncentralized, State-run treatment setting like Northampton State Hospital, into small, atomized, privately\nadministered treatment programs.\nThe plaintiff class members possess a wide variety of rights arising by virtue of their disabling condition or from\ntheir past or present institutionalized status. These rights are complex and multitudinous. They are defined under\nconsent decrees, including this one, and under federal and state constitutions, statutes and regulations. With no\nmechanism for assisting mentally disabled persons in enforcing them, these rights might as well not exist.\nBy way of example, the rights conferred upon the plaintiff class by this Consent Decree alone include at least the\nfollowing:\n... to live in the least restrictive, most normal residential alternative suited to their individual needs;\nto have their residential and non-residential needs determined and reviewed according to\nindividualized planning processes;\nto participate and be represented in those processes;\nto be free from admission to the Hospital, if a mentally retarded client, unless by special exception\nof the RSA;\nto due process in connection with transfers from the Hospital to the community; to receive\nresidential and non-residential services on a voluntary basis to the maximum extent feasible;\nto be notified and given an opportunity to object to any proposed residential or non-residential\nplacement;\n\nto request a transfer at any time to a more appropriate, less restrictive setting, and to have such\nrequests considered and acted upon in accordance with specified standards and procedures;\nto file complaints with the Court Monitor; and\nto initiate independent enforcement actions.\nHerr Report, 20-21.\nTo cite just one segment of the Department of Mental Health's regulations, specifically promulgated pursuant to\nparagraph 32 of this Decree, the plaintiff class members have the following rights:\n1. The right to be free from unlawful discrimination by the DMH or by programs licensed or\nregulated by DMH;\n2. The right to religious freedom and practice without compulsion according to the client's\npreference;\n3. The right to vote, including reasonable assistance when desired in registering and voting;\n4. The right to communicate including the right to have access to a telephone for confidential calls\nand the right to receive unopened mail;\n5. The right to representation by an attorney or advocate;\n6. The right to be protected from commercial exploitation;\n7. The free right of association, including the right to call meetings and receive guests in\ncommunity programs;\n8. The right to enjoy basic goods and services without threat of denial or delay, including a sound\n890 diet, clean and appropriate clothing, medical care, social contact, *890 daily activities, personal\npossessions, access to storage space;\n9. The right to control provision of medical treatment;\n10. The right to be free from specific forms of abuse including corporal punishment, verbal abuse,\nthreat of transfer, inappropriate restraint.\nSee 104 C.M.R. 15.03(3) and (4).\nOther regulations govern the use of restraint and seclusion (104 C.M.R. 15.03(5)), medication (104 C.M.R. 15.03\n(6)), labor (104 C.M.R. 15.03(7)), possessions and funds (104 C.M.R. 15.03(8)), access to records and record\nprivacy (104 C.M.R. 15.03(9)).\n104 C.M.R. 16.01 et seq. describes the complex process of individual service planning and the rights of clients in\nthis process. This includes initial screening, comprehensive assessment, ISP development, the drafting of\nprogram specific plans to carry out the ISP, periodic reviews of the ISP, possible modifications of the ISP, and\nelaborate procedures for client appeals through administrative hearing and ultimately through judicial review\nunder Mass.Gen. Laws c. 30A, ยง 14. See 104 C.M.R. 16.11(4)(d).\nSpecific statutes give clients additional rights. See Mass.Gen.Laws c. 123, ยง 23 and c. 111, ยง 70E.\nThis enumeration is intended as an example merely, not exhaustive, of those rights possessed by clients\nbecause of their status as disabled persons, or as former or current residents of the Northampton State Hospital.\nPersuasive testimony was offered at hearing, and the Court finds, that without trained advocates clients would\nsuffer chronic and substantial deprivation of the rights afforded them under this Decree, under existing\nregulations and under State statutes.\n\nFamiliarity with the nature of the plaintiff class, the community mental health system and the applicable statutes,\nregulations and provisions of this Decree makes it possible to define more exactly what sort of advocate is\nneeded if the Decree is to be fully implemented.\nFirst, advocates must be legally trained. The Herr Report and the testimony of Dr. Herr demonstrate clearly that\nwithout legal training, and without the power to go to court for redress if necessary, advocates would lack the\nnecessary knowledge, skills, and \"clout\" to function effectively. The advocacy system must include lawyers.\nSecond, advocates must be independent. Permitting DMH administrators or employees of direct care agencies\nsole responsibility for advocacy would, in the words of one witness, be like \"letting the fox guard the henhouse.\"\nPromoting the interests of clients must inevitably mean conflict with DMH administrators and private vendor\nagencies.\nThird, the advocacy system must have sufficient resources to permit representation of institutionalized clients and\noutreach efforts to community programs. To do this, advocates cannot be donating their time. The advocacy\napparatus must have the financial and professional stability to permit comprehensive planning and reasonably\nsophisticated coordination of its efforts.\nFourth, advocates must have access to clients themselves and, with appropriate safeguards, client records.\nGiving an administrator or an agency the power to close off this access would quickly cripple an advocacy\nsystem.\nThe foregoing analysis permits the following findings: a need for advocacy services for plaintiff class members\nexists; these advocacy services must be sufficient to protect the rights of clients stemming from their condition of\ndisability or status as currently or previously institutionalized persons; the advocacy system must include lawyers\nand others with legal training, must be independent, must have stable resources and must have access to clients\nand their records.\nTwo questions remain: are existing advocacy services adequate to meet the needs of plaintiff class members? If\nnot, how is such advocacy to be obtained?\n891 *891 The Herr Report thoroughly reviews existing advocacy services, public and private, and finds them\ninadequate to meet even the minimal needs of clients. The Mental Health Legal Advisors Committee, established\nby the Supreme Judicial Court, is largely not engaged in advocacy for individual clients. The Developmental\nDisabilities Law Center concentrates its efforts solely on clients labelled retarded, who make up a tiny fraction of\nthe plaintiff class. The Mental Patients' Advocacy Project, currently serving as counsel for the plaintiff class and\noffering comprehensive legal advocacy both at the institution and in the community, operates on a federal grant\n[3]\nthat will terminate on June 30, 1982 and will not be renewed.  The affidavit of the executive director of the\nWestern Massachusetts Legal Services, funded under the Legal Services Corporation, confirms that\norganization's inability to provide comprehensive legal advocacy for the plaintiff class. Charitable efforts by\nmembers of the private bar have an ad hoc value at best. The courageous efforts of fledgling self advocacy\ngroups, such as \"On Our Own\" are insufficient without the support of lawyers.\nThe defendants' testimony attempting to prove the sufficiency of advocacy efforts within DMH only demonstrated\nthe contrary. The Department's Regional counsel testified it was not part of his function to offer individual\nrepresentation to clients. The head of the Region's quality assurance team indicated the same. Further, he\ntestified that one-day preannounced quality assurance visits to community programs occurred only once every\ntwo to three years. An attorney working for DMH in the Westfield Area testified to her efforts to set up voluntary\nhuman rights committees in Westfield's community programs. But she testified, first, that the committees, when\nconstituted would have no enforcement powers. Second, she testified that no human rights committee was\nactually in operation in Westfield as of the date she testified. Finally, she stated that, to the best of her\nknowledge, none of the other four Areas in the Region employed an attorney in her role or had established any\nhuman rights committees. An appeals mediator working for the DMH in the Franklin/Hampshire area testified that:\n\"I just try to mediate and if mediation does not appear possible, I clarify ... I in no way represent clients.\"\n\nTo the extent that defendants have offered service coordinators, or other care givers, as \"advocates\" for clients,\nthe Court finds that these individuals lack the expertise, independence and capacity, given their other\nresponsibilities, to perform in the manner required.\nThe Court finds that after June 30, 1982, no comprehensive or effective advocacy services will exist within\nRegion One to protect the legal rights of plaintiff class members.\nThe last question is by far the most difficult and the one most hotly pressed by the defendants. Who shall be\nresponsible for the advocacy system?\nOn the one hand, the Court cannot help taking note of, and sympathizing with, the State's fiscal problems. More\n[4]\nimportantly, the Court has no desire to involve itself in the administration of the State's mental health system.\nOn the other hand, at least three considerations press the Court to require advocacy.\nFirst, unless the State takes responsibility for establishing the advocacy apparatus, there will be none. Put\ndifferently, the choice is not between a State-supported advocacy system or one supported by some other stable\nsponsor; it is rather between a State-supported system or none at all.\n892 *892 Second, the cost is not great. The sample budget for an advocacy system, proposed by the Monitor and\nappended to his report, suggests costs amounting to well less than one-half of one per cent of the annual\noperating budget of Region One of the Department of Mental Health.\nThird, the Court finds the need to be critical, and inherent in the very scheme of the Decree. A system of\nadvocacy is not a luxury for the plaintiff class but, given the Decree's other requirements, an absolute necessity.\nThe Decree calls for the dispersal of client services into privately run programs from one end of the four-county\nRegion to the other. The Monitor's reports submitted to this Court after review by the parties have alerted the\nCourt to the risk that this Decree might become00through incompetence, inadequate funding, or for some other\n97\nreason00a justification for \"dumping\" clients out of the institution into poor quality treatment programs, or pushing\n97\nthem from the institution without any program at all. Already the Court has been warned of a large number of\nclients \"falling through the cracks\" in the community mental health system, and winding up in substandard\nhousing or, homeless, on the streets. The Court is not willing, personally or institutionally, to provide through this\nDecree a sanction and a disguise for the continued neglect and abuse of persons labelled mentally ill. Without\nsome minimal system of legal advocacy, members of the plaintiff class will be in the words of Dr. Herr, falling into\n\"chasms, not cracks.\"\nIt is worth noting, in addition, that at least one other court has placed the responsibility for providing advocacy\nservices on defendants in a similar case. See Halderman v. Pennshurst State School and Hospital, 612 F.2d 84,\n113 (3rd Cir. 1979), reversed on other grounds, ___ U.S. ___, 101 S.Ct. 1531, 67 L.Ed.2d 694 (1981).\nFinally, the Court finds that the vigorous involvement of plaintiffs' counsel in the implementation of this Decree\nhas substantially reduced the need for judicial oversight. The disappearance of active counsel will inevitably\nrequire Court involvement in the minutiae of implementation.\nWith regard to the question of advocacy, then, the Court hereby orders the defendants to submit, no later than\nOctober 1, 1981, a plan for a system of independent, legally trained advocates, capable of representing clients in\nconnection with legal issues arising from the clients' disability or status of prior or current institutionalization. A\ntimetable and budget must be submitted with the plan that will insure that the system is fully operational no later\nthan June 1, 1982. The Court is requiring this date to permit thirty days of overlap with the Mental Patients\nAdvocacy Project and insure no discontinuity of services. The advocates must be independent of the Department\nof Mental Health, and must be paid and full-time. A sufficient number of lawyers must be employed by the system\nto insure adequate supervision of lay advocates and court representation where necessary.\n\nIV. HUMAN RESOURCES\nThe second issue grows out of the Consent Decree's human resource requirements. Again, the Court must both\nconstrue the meaning of a paragraph of the Decree and make findings of fact regarding compliance with the\nparagraph.\nIn paragraph 35 of the Decree, the defendants placed upon themselves four obligations. These obligations have\nendured through various amendments of the paragraph.\nFirst, they agreed to \"provide all new employees with appropriate orientation and training programs to increase\ntheir skills and interest in achieving service goals for clients.\" Second, the Decree states \"the defendants agree to\nprovide staff persons employed in new residential and non-residential programs with training appropriate to their\ntasks as set forth in Attachments B and C.\" Third, the defendants stated that \"those Hospital employees for whom\n893 employment in community settings is both desired and suitable will be offered retraining *893 to permit them to\nserve appropriately the needs of clients in these community programs.\" Finally, to accomplish and report to the\nCourt on these efforts the defendants agreed to work with the plaintiffs so that \"[t]he parties will prepare by\nOctober 1, 1979, a plan for orientation, retraining, and ongoing development of Hospital staff and employees of\ncommunity programs.\"\nThe history of paragraph 35 of the Consent Decree is illustrative of the frustrations encountered in\nimplementation. As originally drafted it is a relatively simple provision containing the elements described above.\nA few days prior to October 1, 1979 a motion to amend paragraph 35 was submitted, assented to by all parties,\nwhich extended the date for submission of a final human resources plan to January 1, 1980. Elaborate provisions\nfor substitution of a draft plan by October 1, 1979 were added to the paragraph, but are not relevant here.\nThe rationale for the extension to January 1, 1980 was the need to undertake a manpower survey of hospital\nemployees to determine their interest in and fitness for employment in community programs.\nA second motion to amend paragraph 35 was submitted on January 15, 1980. The rationale for this requested\nextension was the need to collect information on salaries to be incorporated in the final plan. Again, the\ndefendants received the extension, this time to May 15, 1980.\nOn May 14, 1980 the Monitor was notified in writing that a further extension was needed because of the\n\"enormous magnitude\" of the final plan. An informal extension was granted.\nBy July 1980 a 145-page draft plan comprehensively addressing a broad range of troublesome personnel issues,\nand fully satisfying the provisions of paragraph 35, was submitted by the Regional Office to the DMH Central\nOffice and shared with the plaintiffs and the Monitor.\nOn August 25 and September 16, 1980 the Monitor held conferences in Boston regarding obstacles to\nimplementation of the Decree, with a stenographer present. At these conferences the Monitor was informed by\nvarious representatives of the defendants that the Regional DMH plan was being reviewed at other levels of the\nExecutive and that a final plan would shortly be submitted to the Court which would address not only training but\nother broader personnel issues such as salary adequacy and career ladders. It was informally agreed that the\nfinal plan of the defendants would be submitted on September 30, 1980.\nOn September 25, 1980, the defendants again moved for an extension of time to submit their final plan. The\nmotion cited the magnitude of the draft under consideration and the \"complexity and scope\" of their efforts. It\nsought an extension of time to submit the final plan to December 1, 1980. The extension was allowed but only\nuntil November 1, 1980.\nOn October 31, 1980, after a delay of more than a year (during which time no comprehensive training efforts\nwere being made either with regard to hospital or community staff), after repeated protestations regarding the\nmagnitude of the plan and the need to gather extensive data, the defendants submitted a six-page document\n\nwhich they represented as their final plan. As will be seen, this plan is no more than a collection of generalities\n[5]\nthat pay lip service to the wording of paragraph 35 without beginning to satisfy its provisions substantively.\nA non-evidentiary hearing was held before this Court on December 18, 1980, with the Secretaries of\nAdministration and Finance and the Executive Office of Human Services, present. The Court requested that the\ndefendants develop an amended plan to satisfy what the Court and the Monitor felt were some of the clear\n894 inadequacies *894 of the six-page final plan as submitted. The deficiencies of the plan were spelled out in writing\nby the Monitor in a letter to the defendants.\nIn response to the listing of deficiencies the defendants submitted, in January of 1981, their \"Administrative Plan\"\nfor implementation of the six-page human resources plan. The \"Administrative Plan\" was intended to give the\nCourt some notion of the defendants' specific intentions with regard to human resources. However, the\ndefendants insisted that the plan was entirely discretionary and that none of its terms should be considered\nbinding or incorporated in the Decree.\nThe \"Administrative Plan\" is an ambitious scheme for a schedule of orientation sessions and the development of\na core curriculum to form the basis of intensive training. As of August 1981 virtually none of its provisions has\nbeen carried out.\nThus, nearly two years after the original date required for submission of a final plan for \"orientation, retraining,\nand ongoing development of Hospital staff and employees of community programs,\" next to nothing has been\ndone. The plan before the Court is still the six-page document which the defendants insist satisfies paragraph 35\nand the plaintiffs condemn as inadequate.\nThis long summary of the history behind implementation of paragraph 35 is offered for two reasons. First, it gives\nthe lie to any accusation that the Court has acted hastily or impatiently with regard to defendants' efforts to satisfy\nthis paragraph. Second, it demonstrates what the Court believes to be conduct amounting to outright bad faith on\nthe part of the defendants.\nIt is no consolation that this bad faith cannot be laid at the feet of any one individual. It can be described as the\nbad faith of the defendants collectively, or perhaps as systemic bad faith. Nevertheless, specific representations\nwere made to this Court through the Monitor as to the magnitude and content of the final plan being drafted by\nthe defendants. The representations were not vindicated by subsequent events. A discretionary \"Administrative\nPlan\" was offered to the Court purporting to show the intentions of the defendants; few if any of the elements of\nthis plan were actually carried out.\nWhen delays and misrepresentations occur to this degree, the Court has forced upon it only two options:\nintervene or abdicate.\nTurning to the plan as submitted under paragraph 35, the Court finds it inadequate for the following reasons.\nFirst, the sections describing the orientation effort lack any proposed budget, lack specification of a person or\npersons to be responsible for coordinating orientation, lack a timetable for orientation sessions and lack details of\nthe content of orientation.\nSecond, the sections describing the defendants' proposed training efforts are inadequate for the following\nreasons: no details of training content are offered, no persons responsible for coordinating training are identified,\nno timetable for provision of necessary training is established, no budget is offered for the training effort, no\nprocedures are established to insure that all employees of private contract agencies are properly trained.\nThird, the six-page plan completely lacks any details regarding ongoing development of Hospital and community\nstaff. Minimally, procedures must be established to insure that new staff are pulled into training programs and that\nthe professional expertise of program staff is monitored and upgraded.\nPutting aside the plan and looking directly at the training efforts actually made, the progress can be described\nsimply and emphatically. Virtually no training has been done, except on an ad hoc basis by individual vendors or\nparticular Area staff.\n\nThe Executive Director of the Western Massachusetts Training Consortium, the agency whose contracts with the\nDMH provide most of the resources for developing a comprehensive training effort, testified that, as far as\n895 orientation sessions, only one pilot session has occurred. None further *895 was planned. Due to delays in\ncontract approval, only a little over one month's work was done in developing the core curriculum for training. No\ntraining sessions are scheduled.\nDr. David Specht, also of the Western Massachusetts Training Consortium, testified as to the results of his\nmanpower turnover study. According to his study, there is a 54.8% turnover in direct care staff in the average\ncommunity program annually. Only one-third of community employees have worked in their agency for more than\na year. There is a 40% turnover of residential supervisory staff. Specht found that in most community programs\nstaff were placed on the job without any training whatsoever. He also found that during a six-month study of 13\nagencies and 192 staff, no agency reported any dismissal of staff. Specht cited lack of adequate salaries, lack of\nappropriate orientation and training programs and absence of career ladders as the main reasons for the high\nturnover of staff.\nThe defendants' evidence only confirmed the impression made by the plaintiffs' witnesses. Elaine Ostroff, the\nDMH person responsible for training admitted on direct examination that a statewide system for training \"really\ndoes not exist at this time .... Very little training is provided in a consistent, ongoing way.\" Ms. Ostroff described\nthe beginning of an effort at development of the core training curriculum, orientation programs and supervisor\ntraining; while encouraging, these beginnings have as yet produced little in the way of concrete results.\nBased on the foregoing the Court finds that the defendants have not only failed to submit an adequate plan as\nrequired by paragraph 35, but have failed to satisfy the substantive provisions of that paragraph requiring\nprovision of appropriate orientation, training programs and ongoing development for community and Hospital\npersonnel.\nIt was for good reason that the personnel and training provisions formed a central feature of the Decree. The\ndecentralized nature of the proposed community system means that, if treatment is to be consistent and\nadequate, a comprehensive supervisory and planning role must be played by the DMH in the area of training.\nThis is particularly true in an isolated community program which, unlike a large medical facility, lacks a\nconcentration of trained medical personnel to oversee, to at least some extent, the direct care staff. The fear\nremains 00 and clearly has been realized to some extent 00 that underpaid persons with little or no training or\n97 97\nsupervision will be given responsibility in community programs for the day-to-day treatment of class members.\nConcrete, comprehensive steps by the defendants to confront this problem have been practically non-existent.\nWith regard to human resources, the Court makes the following orders:\n1. The defendants will submit to this Court, no later than October 1, 1981, a comprehensive plan for training,\norientation and ongoing development of community and Hospital staff. The plan will satisfy all the deficiencies\nenumerated in this Memorandum.\n2. The plan will insure that a final draft of a core curriculum for training of supervisory and direct care staff is\napproved and submitted to this Court by all defendants no later than November 1, 1981.\n3. The plan will insure that appropriate retraining programs are available for interested Hospital staff no later than\nFebruary 1, 1982.\n4. The plan will insure the orientation of all community and Hospital staff no later than April 1, 1982.\n5. The plan will insure that all supervisory and direct care staff receive training under the core curriculum no later\nthan June 30, 1982.\n6. Any requests for extensions of the timelines in this Order will be filed prior to the expiration of the date to be\nextended and will be supported by affidavit setting forth the reasons for the request.\n896  APPENDIX A\n*896\n\nMONITOR'S REPORT REGARDING NECESSITY FOR TRAINED\nADVOCATES\nThis Report is submitted pursuant to Paragraph 59 of the Consent Decree, which requires the Monitor to\n\"investigate and determine the necessity for trained, independent advocates to assist clients in the protection of\ntheir rights ...\" and \"to submit its recommendation ... on the appropriate role of and funding for such independent\nadvocacy.\"\nTwo sources provide the foundation for this Report. First, and primarily, close experience with implementation of\nthis Decree over two years and thousands of hours has provided the Monitor with direct knowledge of the\nconcrete realities and needs of mentally disabled persons living in the community. Second, the comprehensive\nreport of Dr. Stanley S. Herr, of Harvard Law School, commissioned by this Court for use in the Brewster Decree\nand other Decrees, has afforded the Monitor and this Court an excellent summary of thought on advocacy\nnationally. This lengthy report is appended.\nOn the question of the necessity for advocates, the Court Monitor determines that independent, trained legal\nadvocates are necessary to protect adequately the rights of the plaintiff class in the coming years. This\nconclusion is supported unanimously by the literature and court decisions on the subject.\nThe most obvious justification for this conclusion lies in the extreme vulnerability of the group to be protected.\nThe abuse and neglect suffered by mentally disabled persons in institutions and in the community, historically\nand to the present, is too glaring to require particularized support. While fledgling self-advocacy groups\ncomposed of ex-hospital clients have some power to articulate their own needs and desires, even these groups\nwould be the first to admit that without training and support their voices may have little impact.\nIn addition, the extreme complexity of the evolving law expressing or related to the rights of the mentally disabled\ndemands trained legal advocacy. The Herr Report details some 20 pages of specific areas where regulations,\ncourt decisions, statutes or other sources of law are found applicable to mentally disabled persons. The advocacy\nof these rights is often literally a matter of life and death. No untrained lay person could be expected to\ncomprehend the various sources of applicable law, let alone fluently argue from them in support of mentally\ndisabled persons. See Herr, pp. 10-31.\nThird, existing mechanisms for advocacy are clearly inadequate, either in terms of their current capacity or their\nlong-term ability to provide services. The Herr Report carefully analyzes the capacity of existing advocacy\nservices in the Commonwealth and finds that, with one exception, the services are not able to meet the advocacy\nneeds of this client group. The one exception is the Mental Patients' Advocacy Project, a nationally recognized\nadvocacy group currently representing the plaintiff class in the implementation of this Consent Decree and\noperating under a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). The funding grant for this\norganization, however, will terminate in June of 1982. Thus, unless preparations are made within the next few\nmonths, current advocacy resources will expire on this date. See Herr, pp. 39-57.\nFinally, the disappearance of adequate advocacy services may force this Court to act, as a practical matter, as\nthe permanent advocate or protector of the plaintiff class. A well established advocacy system reduces or\neliminates the need for constant recourse to the federal court and avoids the possibility of this lawsuit becoming\nan open book in perpetuity.\nHaving determined the necessity for trained, independent advocates, the Monitor is required then by the Decree\nto make recommendations as to the appropriate role of and funding for these advocates. While the theoretical\n897 role of an advocacy system *897 could be discussed indefinitely, the necessary features of an independent legal\nadvocacy system for mentally disabled persons in this Region are easy to summarize.\nFirst, advocates must have thorough legal training. They must be familiar with the evolving law as expressed in\nregulation, statutes and court decisions. They must have minimal training in both informal negotiation and formal\n\ntrial practice. This requires that the system contain attorneys, though they may be supported by legally trained\nadvocates.\nSecond, the advocacy system must have a capacity to respond and assist clients in their relationships with state\nagencies, with private non-profit agencies and with a society at large. This means that the advocacy system must\nhave the potential to do both individual client advocacy and systemic litigation. In short, the advocacy system\nmust have a high degree of flexibility and expertise to confront a wide variety of problems.\nThird, the advocacy system must be capable of making contact with its clients. Since the Brewster population will\nbe scattered in various residences and treatment sites throughout the Region, this will require considerable\noutreach efforts and availability at a variety of locations. It will also require that, within established limits,\nadvocates have access to client records and that defendants insure that no private agency prevents advocates\nfrom contacting clients. To increase the likelihood of fruitful contact, the advocacy system should make efforts to\ninclude ex-hospital patients or other clients within the system.\nFourth, advocates must be free from any undue influence from the agencies or persons with whom they may\nhave an adversarial relationship.\nIn order to play the role described above, the advocacy system must be full-time, must be paid, must contain a\nmixture of attorneys and legal paraprofessional advocates and be capable of performing on-going training for its\nstaff. The Herr Report describes in detail the general role of the advocacy system at pages 59 through 99.\nThe practical feasibility of this proposed system is demonstrated by the fact that the system really exists and is\ncurrently functioning in this Region. The Mental Patients' Advocacy Project comprises three attorneys and five\nparalegal advocates performing a broad spectrum of advocacy across the four counties of Western\nMassachusetts, both at Northampton State Hospital and at a wide variety of community programs in the Region's\nfive Areas.\nThe final topic of this Report is the question of funding for the independent legal advocacy system. On this issue,\ntwo principles must be observed. First, the funding source must be stable and reliable. Second, the funding\nsource cannot compromise the independence of the advocacy system.\nMany potential sources of funding for legal advocacy are set out in the Herr Report at page 100 and following.\nOne of the most promising external sources of funds may be the federal government itself. Section 502 of the\nrecently enacted Mental Health Systems Act empowers the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make\ngrants to providers of advocacy services. It is worth noting that these grants may be made only if the entity:\n(A) has the authority and ability to pursue legal, administrative, and other appropriate remedies to\nensure the protection of the rights of mentally ill individuals, and\n(B) is independent of any entity which provides treatment or services to mentally ill individuals.\nWhile many sources of funds potentially exist, the locus of responsibility for assuring adequate funding of the\nadvocacy system can only be with the defendants. Federal grants, private foundations, and local universities and\nlaw schools may help, and may even assume the bulk of cost, but they do not have the long-term stability and\nreliability to assure continued existence of an advocacy system. It will therefore be the recommendation of this\nReport that the responsibility for assuring and, if necessary, supplying adequate funding of the advocacy system\nlies with the state.\n898 *898 This recommendation is not inconsistent with the independence of legal advocates. The defendants\ncurrently provide substantial funding for civil and criminal legal assistance to indigent persons without\ncompromising the independence of that advocacy system.\nAs an example of an advocacy program which would be adequate to safeguard minimally the various legal rights\nof the plaintiff class for the indefinite future, a sample administrative structure and proposed budget is appended.\nThis information is based on the current budget for the Mental Patients' Advocacy Project. Please note that the\nannual proposed budget represents less than one-half of one percent of the current operating budget for the\ndefendants' services in the four counties of Western Massachusetts.\n\nIn summary, the finding and recommendation of the Monitor in this matter are as follows:\n1. There is a necessity for trained, independent legal advocates to assist all class members in the protection of\ntheir rights as set forth in relevant statutes, regulations, and the provisions of this Decree.\n2. Without action, adequate legal advocacy services for the plaintiff class will disappear after June, 1982.\n3. The advocacy system must be capable of intervening through legal means in the relationship of clients with\nagencies of state government, with private non-profit agencies providing direct service, and with the society at\nlarge.\n4. The advocacy system must include attorneys, though it may also incorporate legally trained para-\nprofessionals. Advocates must be trained, paid and full-time. Advocates must have access to client records\nthrough appropriate procedures and access to clients themselves in community programs. Clients should be\nencouraged to work with the advocacy system.\n5. The advocacy system must be free of undue influence by the agencies with whom they are likely to have an\nadversarial relationship.\n6. The defendants must adequately fund the legal advocacy system, though federal or other sources may\ngenerate some or all of the needed monies.\n7. Defendants must provide the Court by March 16, 1981 with a timetable and proposed budget that will insure no\ndiscontinuity of advocacy services within the Region.\nPlaintiffs and defendants will submit their responses to these recommendations by February 27, 1981. As to each\nrecommendation, plaintiffs and defendants should indicate whether they agree or disagree. As to each point\nwhere there is disagreement, plaintiffs or defendants should indicate the grounds or reasons for disagreement\nand suggest alternatives to the proposed recommendation.\nRespectfully submitted, /s/ Michael A.

Gen., Commonwealth of Massachusetts,\nand William L. Pardee, Asst. Atty. Gen., were on brief, for defendants, appellees.\n[*]\nBefore TORRUELLA, SELYA and BOUDIN,  Circuit Judges.\nSELYA, Circuit Judge.\nThese appeals mark the most recent chapter in institutional reform litigation that began almost two decades ago.\n[1]\n On this occasion, plaintiffs argue that the district court erred both in banning future fee awards and in\ncalculating fees for services rendered by their counsel in connection with the latest round of litigation. We agree\nwith certain of plaintiffs' contentions, disagree with others, and dispose of the appeals accordingly.\nI\nIn December 1978, the district court entered a consent decree resolving a class action, started in 1976, that\nchallenged the mental health regime maintained by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts at the Northampton\nState Hospital. The decree required the Commonwealth to develop a network of community residential facilities\nand nonresident support programs. On March 12, 1987, after approximately eight years of supervision, the\ndistrict court entered a carrot-and-stick order in anticipation of bringing active judicial involvement to a close. The\norder set maintenance-of-effort provisions firmly in place, enunciated guiding principles, ranked priorities, and\ndirected that certain further steps be taken. It also offered the Commonwealth a carrot, providing that, if all went\nwell during the next three years, the district court would \"end its jurisdiction\" over the mental health system in\nWestern Massachusetts. This meant, the court explained, that it would terminate the decree although continuing\nthe maintenance-of-effort provisions in effect.\nOn October 25, 1990, the court issued a disengagement order that removed much of the case from judicial\noversight but continued the court's control over a portion of the litigation until September 1, 1991. The 1990 order\n490 reiterated the court's promise to terminate *490 supervision if sufficient progress transpired. On January 6, 1992,\nthe court entered its final disengagement order. The court found that compliance had been achieved and,\nconsequently, ordered:\n... that the Consent Decree entered on December 7, 1978 is hereby vacated, the Court's active\njurisdiction over the case and the mental health system in Western Massachusetts is hereby\nended, and this action is hereby dismissed....\nIn the same document, however, the court also stipulated:\n\n... that notwithstanding the foregoing order, the defendants are enjoined from violating Section III\nand Paragraph 43 of the Disengagement Order [continuing the maintenance-of-effort provisions]\nwhich shall remain in effect.\nThen, avowedly \"pursuant to\" its January 6 order, the court entered what it styled a \"judgment of dismissal.\"\nNeither side appealed.\nIn earlier proceedings, fees totalling approximately $675,000 had been awarded to plaintiffs' counsel for work\ndone through October of 1990. After entry of the judgment of dismissal, the parties' attention returned to these\nverdant pastures. Plaintiffs filed a further fee application which, as later supplemented, sought close to $30,000 in\nfees for the period November 1, 1990, to June 1, 1992. The Commonwealth opposed the request in several\nparticulars and also asked the court to rule out, or at least cabin, future legal fees.\nOn November 6, 1992, the district court granted the plaintiffs' fee application in part and denied it in part. Using\nreduced rates, the court awarded $12,766 for services rendered through January 6, 1992, but refused to allow\nfees for work performed after that date. The court also responded favorably to the Commonwealth's motion,\nstating that it would not award \"any future attorneys' fees.\" Plaintiffs appealed.\nII\nPlaintiffs' first and most salient attack is upon the district court's issuance of a categorical ban prohibiting future\nfees. They argue that, although the January 6 order and separate judgment purport to disengage the court from\noversight and dismiss the case, the order explicitly continues in effect an injunction embodying the maintenance-\nof-effort provisions. Because there is an ongoing injunction, plaintiffs say, the district court, consistent with 42\nU.S.C. ยง 1988 (Supp.1991), cannot wholly preclude fee-shifting as it relates to future proceedings that may\n[2]\nimplicate the injunction.\nThe Commonwealth adopts a posture of confession and avoidance. It does not argue that an absolute bar on\nfuture fees is legally supportable 00 a stance we take as an implied concession of the plaintiffs' basic point 00 but,\n97 97\nrather, it suggests that the court below meant only to preclude compensation for self-initiated monitoring efforts\nthat might be undertaken thereafter by plaintiffs' counsel. In support of this reading, the Commonwealth points to\nan earlier appeal wherein this court suggested that it might be appropriate at some stage to ask the district judge\n\"to relieve [the Commonwealth] of the burden of paying for private party monitoring.\" Brewster v. Dukakis, 786\nF.2d 16, 19 (1st Cir.1986). Thus, the Commonwealth asseverates, the November 6 order should be read not to\nprohibit all attorneys' fees, but simply to limit fees to future disputes, if any, in which the plaintiffs prove to be\n\"prevailing part[ies]\" within the meaning of section 1988.\nIt is true that the November 6 order is to some extent opaque and that the district court's intent in entering it is\ncorrespondingly tenebrous. It is also arguably true that the district court's judgment of dismissal, together with the\ncourt's references to complete disengagement, may be consistent with an unqualified end to the litigation. And if\nthis case were complete, then the issue of future fees would be moot (although an order barring them would then\n491 seem unnecessary). Yet the Commonwealth's interpretive legerdemain *491 overlooks a crucial fact: the January\n6 order, quoted supra p. 3, states unequivocally that the maintenance-of-effort provisions continue\n\"notwithstanding\" the dismissal. Unless these provisions are purely hortatory 00 and the Commonwealth itself\n97\ndoes not make such a claim 00 there is still a permanent injunction operating in this case.\n97\nWe find that the injunction remains in effect. Our reasons are twofold. First, although the district court's dismissal\nin this case, taken alone, might betoken the end of the decree, the dismissal does not stand alone. By its terms, it\nwas entered \"pursuant to\" an order of even date 00 and the order itself is no less explicit that \"notwithstanding\" the\n97\nproposed dismissal the defendants are \"enjoined\" from violating certain injunctive provisions which remain in\nforce. A court's dispositive orders must be read as an integrated whole. Reading the instant record in that fashion,\nthe various edicts clearly contemplate continuation of the injunction 00 and so long as the injunction endures, the\n97\ndistrict court's enforcement authority can always be \"reawakened.\" Consumer Advisory Bd. v. Glover, 989 F.2d\n\n65, 67 (1st Cir.1993); see also In re Pearson, 990 F.2d 653, 657 (1st Cir.1993) (noting that when structural\ninjunctions are left in place, they often require continuing judicial intervention).\nThe second reason why we interpret the January 6 order along these lines is prophylactic: when, as in this case,\nthere are two possible interpretations of a decree, one of which would undermine the decree's validity and the\nother of which would be entirely unremarkable, the latter is plainly to be preferred. Were we to conclude that the\nCommonwealth's reading of the record was correct, a serious question would arise as to whether the judgment\ncomplied with the requirement that \"a rather precise statement\" be furnished before a district court can terminate\nan institutional reform decree. Board of Educ. v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 246, 111 S.Ct. 630, 636, 112 L.Ed.2d 715\n(1991). As we recently observed, courts entering such decrees often \"pass through levels of disengagement as\nthe decree moves toward achievement.\" Glover, 989 F.2d at 67. Termination of a decree has significant\nconsequences for the parties, and Dowell requires that so important an event be plainly marked.\nFor these reasons, we construe the judgment of dismissal as closing the case administratively but leaving the\ninjunction in effect. And, once this finding is juxtaposed with the text of the November 6 order 00 which, as framed,\n97\ncan certainly be read to interpose a wholesale ban on future fees (indeed, that is the most natural reading of it) 00\n97\nit follows inexorably that the latter order must be modified. Notwithstanding that 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988(b) provides that\nthe district court \"may\" award reasonable fees to a prevailing party \"in its discretion,\" the Supreme Court has\nruled that attorneys' fees must be awarded thereunder to a successful plaintiff \"unless special circumstances\nwould render such an award unjust.\" Blanchard v. Bergeron, 489 U.S. 87, 89 n. 1, 109 S.Ct. 939, 942 n. 1, 103\nL.Ed.2d 67 (1989); see also de Jesus v. Banco Popular, 918 F.2d 232, 234 (1st Cir.1990) (discussing operation of\nsection 1988). Given this preeminent authority, an anticipatory negation of all future fees, in all circumstances,\ncannot easily be defended in an ongoing institutional reform case.\nThe matter before us adequately illustrates the point. Here, one can easily envision circumstances 00 say, an\n97\negregious violation of the maintenance-of-effort provisions requiring litigation to set matters right 00 in which\n97\n492 section 1988 could demand a further award of fees.[3]Cf. Pearson, 990 F.2d at 657*492 (holding that when a\nstructural injunction in an institutional reform case \"has continuing effects, the issuing court retains authority to\nenforce it\"). We could construct other examples, but no useful purpose would be served. Because it is perfectly\nplain that a total ban on future fees cannot be countenanced here, the district court's order needs adjustment.\nLest the baby be discarded with the bath water, we also uphold the district court's ban on future fees insofar as\nthe ban represents a determination that it is no longer reasonable to remunerate counsel for routine monitoring of\nthe decree (including the continuing injunction). Plaintiffs themselves do not object to this limitation on future\ncompensable services and, given the lack of objection, we see no need to discuss the matter extensively. After\nall, when the court ruled that further monitoring would be superfluous, the litigation had been winding down for\nfive years, the Commonwealth was in compliance, the decree had been truncated, and the case was being\nrelegated to inactive status.\nWithout wishing unduly to prolong the discussion, we add one further observation: by tradition and almost by\nnecessity, district judges have great discretion in deciding what claimed legal services should be compensated, \nsee, e.g., Phetosomphone v. Allison Reed Group, Inc., 984 F.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir.1993); Lipsett v. Blanco, 975 F.2d\n934, 939-40 (1st Cir.1992); Foley v. City of Lowell, 948 F.2d 10, 18-19 (1st Cir.1991), and there are times when\nan advance ruling by the trial court provides helpful guidance. So here, in regard to the gratuitous nature of future\nmonitoring.\nIII\nAnother disagreement between the parties concerns the hourly rates that plaintiffs' counsel should earn for work\ndone from November 1990 to June 1992. Each of plaintiffs' two attorneys submitted affidavits reciting their\nqualifications and attesting to fees charged and paid at $195 per hour (lead counsel) and $125 per hour\n(associate counsel), respectively. The district court did not succumb to these importunings, instead awarding lead\ncounsel, Stephen Schwartz, $120/hr. for core legal work, and associate counsel, Cathy Costanzo, $80/hr. for\nsuch work. For non-core work, the court awarded lead counsel $80/hr. and associate counsel exactly half that\n\n[4]\nrate.  Plaintiffs assign error to the lower court's refusal to accept what plaintiffs term their lawyers' \"established\nbilling rates.\"\nThe standards governing hourly rates applicable to shifted legal fees are hardly models of precision. The\nSupreme Court has endorsed the use of market rates as a starting point, see Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886,\n895, 104 S.Ct. 1541, 1547, 79 L.Ed.2d 891 (1984), but it also has approved consideration of adjusting factors. \nSee Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air, 478 U.S. 546, 563-65, 106 S.Ct. 3088,\n3097-98, 92 L.Ed.2d 439 (1986); Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 434 n. 9, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1940 n. 9, 76\nL.Ed.2d 40 (1983). This court has followed the same course, see, e.g., Lipsett, 975 F.2d at 940-41; United States\nv. Metropolitan Dist. Comm'n, 847 F.2d 12, 19 (1st Cir.1988), and we have underscored the ample discretion of\nthe district judge 00 the judicial officer who is most familiar with the case, the attorneys, and the interactive\n97\nnuances 00 in constructing fee awards. See, e.g., Foley, 948 F.2d at 19.\n97\nWe think the current dispute can best be addressed by putting it into historical perspective. In 1982, the district\ncourt allowed fees of $80/hr. for lead counsel's court activities and $70/hr. for his decree-implementation work. In\n1985, these rates were increased to $95 and $85, respectively. In that time frame, we approved the rates as\nwithin the district court's discretion. See Brewster, 786 F.2d at 21. In 1991, the district court raised Mr. Schwartz's\nrates to $120/hr. for core work and $80/hr. for non-core work. At the same time, the court set associate counsel's\n493 rates at $80/hr. for core work and $40/ hr. for non-core work. On each occasion, the *493 court rejected plaintiffs'\nrequests for more munificent rates.\nThe several affidavits submitted to support plaintiffs' latest fee application aimed to fill gaps in proof and to show\nthat counsel actually command the higher rates they seek here from other clients. In its fee order, issued on\nNovember 6, 1992, the district court reaffirmed the rates it had established in 1991, without discussing the latest\nset of affidavits. As a general rule, a fee-awarding court that makes a substantial reduction in either documented\ntime or authenticated rates should offer reasonably explicit findings, for the court, in such circumstances, \"has a\nburden to spell out the whys and wherefores.\" Metropolitan Dist. Comm'n, 847 F.2d at 18. But, there are\noccasions on which fee-setting judges \"should be permitted to draw conclusions and make adjustments without\nfull articulation.\" Jacobs v. Mancuso, 825 F.2d 559, 564 (1st Cir.1987).\nThis is such an occasion. The trial court made the necessary bottom-line findings. Although subsidiary findings\nwould have been desirable, mitigating circumstances abound: the judge (who has done a stellar job over almost\ntwo full decades) knew the case inside out; the rates used by the trial court are the very figures adopted in 1991,\nthe year in which much of this work was done; those rates were not appealed when first used; and the newly\nclaimed hours are relatively few in number. Finally, this is the caboose of a litigation train that has chugged along\nfor almost two decades. Given the singular nature of the situation and the age of the case, we are reluctant to\npress the district court for supplementary explanation. Believing, as we do, that the additional expense to be\nincurred in seeking perfection would be a poor investment, we decline to disturb the district court's reaffirmation\nof the rates it set in 1991.\nIV\nThe last point of contention involves the district court's refusal to consider awarding fees for services rendered\nafter January 6, 1992. The court took this position solely because it believed that no compensation should be\npaid for work performed after the date of its last disengagement order. In light of our holding that a categorical\nban on future fees cannot stand, see supra Part II, the blanket disallowance of fees referable to services\nrendered subsequent to the bar date must likewise fall.\nWe must now decide what to do with the disallowed hours. Bearing in mind that the district court never addressed\nindividual entries in the time records submitted for this period, we would ordinarily remand so that the court might\nreevaluate the situation. But, the circumstances here are out of the ordinary: the contentiousness surrounding the\nlawyers' compensation threatens to overshadow the main case 00 a somewhat Kafkaesque development since\n97\nthe case furnishes the sole raison d'etre for the compensation. The Supreme Court has repeatedly cautioned that\na fight over fees, within the broader framework of a litigated case, ought not take on a life of its own. See, e.g., \n\nHensley, 461 U.S. at 436, 103 S.Ct. at 1941 (\"A request for attorney's fees should not result in a second major\nlitigation.\"). Put bluntly, fee disputes, unlike Jack's beanstalk or Pinocchio's nose, cannot be permitted to grow\nand grow and grow.\nIn kindred circumstances, we have refused to let the tail wag the dog. We have recognized, for example, that\nwhen a trial court has improvidently disallowed certain time, an appellate court, so long as the record is\nreasonably complete, may appropriately take the bull by the horns, forgo a remand, and recalculate the fee\naward without further ado. See, e.g., Pearson v. Fair, 980 F.2d 37, 45 (1st Cir.1992); see also Foster v. Mydas\nAssocs., Inc., 943 F.2d 139, 144 n. 8 (1st Cir.1991) (listing representative cases); cf. Navarro-Ayala v. Nunez, 968\nF.2d 1421, 1428 (1st Cir.1992) (applying the same principle to a required recalculation of monetary sanctions).\nBecause this case fits the model, we turn directly to the necessary computation.\nThe block of time in question aggregates 51.9 hours (31.6 hours attributable to Mr. Schwartz and the remainder\n494 attributable *494 to Ms. Costanzo).[5]\nLead counsel's time entries deal exclusively with fee-related work. We have repeatedly held that time reasonably\nexpended in connection with fee applications is itself compensable, see, e.g., Lund v. Affleck, 587 F.2d 75, 77\n(1st Cir.1978), but, since time spent in this exercise often amounts to little more than \"documenting what a lawyer\ndid and why he or she did it,\" Gabriele v. Southworth, 712 F.2d 1505, 1507 (1st Cir.1983), it may fairly be\ncompensated at a reduced rate. See id.; accord Jacobs, 825 F.2d at 563; Miles v. Sampson, 675 F.2d 5, 9 (1st\nCir.1982). Thus, we accept lead counsel's fee-related time in toto, but direct that it be valued at the rate\napplicable to his non-core work. This portion of the incremental fee is, therefore, $2528, viz., 31.6 hrs. ร $80/hr. =\n$2528.\nWe treat associate counsel's incremental time in two segments. We award plaintiffs the miscoded time, see supra\n[6]\nnote 5, in its entirety.  Using the dollar figure computed by plaintiffs under the district court's approved rates, \nsee Appellants' Brief at 31 n. 19, and mindful that the Commonwealth has not criticized the computation, we\nvalue this time at $1150. We add to this figure $80, representing the remaining two hours of Ms. Costanzo's time.\nIn doing so, we note that these hours were spent in fee-related endeavors and should, therefore, be remunerated\nat her non-core rate.\nAs a final check, we have paused to consider whether the fee award, as adjusted, appears reasonable in the\ncircumstances and is in overall proportion to what remained at stake in the winding-down of the litigation. See \nJacobs, 825 F.2d at 563 (suggesting such an overview). We conclude that the requirement of reasonableness is\nfully satisfied. The revised award is fair to plaintiffs and their counsel, although slightly less generous than they\nhad thought due; it is, at the same time, fair to the Commonwealth, although slightly more extravagant than it had\nhoped. While we anticipate that all the parties will be displeased, the fact that a fee award leaves both payer and\npayee somewhat sullen is often a sign of fairness all around.\nV\nWe need go no further. The order appealed from is affirmed in part and vacated in part. The case is remanded for\nthe entry of a revised fee award for the period ended June 1, 1992, increasing the amount of attorneys' fees from\n$12,766 to $16,524. The court below shall also enter a new judgment eliminating the absolute bar on future fee\nrequests (assuming such an absolute bar was intended), making explicit the bar on future fees for self-initiated\nmonitoring, and clarifying that the limited injunction remains in effect until further order. Should plaintiffs believe\nthey are entitled to fees or costs on appeal, they may file an application pursuant to 1st Cir.Loc.R. 39.2.\nIt is so ordered.\n[*] Judge Boudin has recused himself in this matter. Therefore, the case is decided by the two remaining\npanelists. See 28 U.S.C. ยง 46(d)(1988).\n\n[1] Prior phases of the litigation are chronicled in sundry opinions of this court. See, e.g., Brewster v. Dukakis,\n786 F.2d 16 (1st Cir.1986); Brewster v. Dukakis, 687 F.2d 495 (1st Cir.1982); Brewster v. Dukakis, 675 F.2d 1 (1st\nCir.1982). We refer persons who hunger for additional detail to those opinions.\n[2] The statute pertinently provides that in any action to enforce specified civil rights laws, \"the court, in its\ndiscretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the\ncosts.\" 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988(b).\n[3] The Commonwealth agrees that, in theory, there could be future litigation in this case for which compensation\nmight properly be sought, but urges that fees should be granted only if plaintiffs prove to be the prevailing parties\nin such future litigation. Plaintiffs, by contrast, claim that once a suitor is found to have prevailed on a significant\naspect of a civil rights case and obtains some relief, the district court is not obliged to subdivide counsel's bill into\nsuccessful and unsuccessful elements. In plaintiffs' view, even unsuccessful aspects can be compensated,\nalthough reasonableness remains a constraint and the degree of success is often relevant to the fee. We think it\nunwise to attempt to resolve this conundrum in the abstract; after all, the district court did not address the\nstandard for future fee awards and the problem may never arise. Hence, we express no opinion on these\ncompeting contentions.\n[4] In the district court's parlance, core work includes legal research, writing of legal documents, court\nappearances, negotiations with opposing counsel, monitoring, and implementation of court orders. Non-core work\nconsists of less demanding tasks, including letter writing and telephone conversations. We upheld a similar\ntaxonomy in Brewster, 786 F.2d at 21.\n[5] The situation is complicated by a careless mistake contained in the plaintiffs' fee application. In that\nsubmission, plaintiffs identified a block of Ms. Costanzo's time, totalling 18.3 hours, as having been spent in\n1992. So labelled, the time was disallowed. Plaintiffs now allege for the first time that these hours were\nmisrecorded and actually represent time spent in 1991. Upon close perscrutation, the entries' text appears to\nbear out the allegation.\n[6] In the circumstances at bar, we choose not to penalize plaintiffs for their labelling error. We do not mean to\nsuggest, however, that a fee-setting court lacks discretion to discount fees because of sloppiness in the fee-\nseeker's presentation. Cf., e.g., Grendel's Den v. Larkin, 749 F.2d 945, 956 (1st Cir.1984) (finding \"no reason to\napply the Fees Act in such a way as to give delinquent applicants a second chance to recover\").\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

NATURE OF THE ACTION\n1.  The Northampton State Hospital (hereinafter the\nHospital) presently involuntarily confines more than 500\nmentally disabled  persons and admits more than 1500 involun-\ntary patients annually.  Of both this fixed and revolving\npatient population, a significant number did not and do not\nbelong in the Hospital and would benefit by being placed in\nalternative care facilities, including community mental health\nclinics, halfway houses, nursing homes, rest homes, group homes\nand other residential environments.  However, only a tiny\nfraction of these patients have been or can be placed in such\nalternative facilities, either because there are not enough\nplaces in existing alternatives to handle the number of\npatients who are appropriate for placement or because the qual-\nity of treatment and supervision provided in many of the\nexisting alternatives is inadequate and would harm rather\nthan benefit patients placed there or because the Hospital\nhas neglected to locate suitable placements.  The absence of\nadequate and appropriate community placements is the result\nof a pattern and practice on the part of the defendants in\nfailing to create such alternatives.\nThe term \"mentally disabled,\" as used throughout\nthis Complaint, refers to persons who are mentally ill or\nmentally retarded, or who have a combination of these handicaps\n\n4\n2.  The involuntary confinement of mentally disabled\npersons in a total institution such as the Northampton State\nHospital results in a serious deprivation of liberty.  More-\nover, patients' constitutional rights of association, assembly,\nand travel as well as their freedom of speech and freedom of\nbelief are seriously restricted if not fully curtailed in the\nHospital.  The abridgement of individuals' liberty and other\nfundamental rights must be accomplished by the least drastic\nmeans possible.  Since placement in a less restrictive com-\nmunity setting or facility is appropriate and would benefit a\nsignificant number of patients at the Hospital, retention in\nthe Hospital is unnecessary and unconstitutional.\n3.  The sole legitimate purpose for the confinement of\npersons at the Hospital is treatment. The limited treatment\noffered at the Hospital can be and routinely is administered in\ncommunity clinics, halfway houses, nursing homes, rest homes,\ngroup homes, and other residential environments.  This continuum\nof less restrictive alternatives also offers other modes of\ntreatment which are not available in the Hospital and which\nwould greatly further the patients' rehabilitation and their\nintegration into the community.  Where the treatment of a sig-\nnificant number of patients at the Hospital can be undertaken\nin a less restrictive setting or facility, and where the\ntreatment provided at the Hospital often harms rather than\nbenefits their mental condition, retention at the Hospital is\ninappropriate and unconstitutional.\n\n4.  The desirability of providing treatment in less\nrestrictive community alternatives in order to avoid the\nresultant harm of institutionalization is now clearly a national\npolicy incorporated in several recent Congressional enactments.\nThe mandate to maintain a continuum of community treatment\nprograms has been incorporated in every recent federal statutory\nscheme affecting the mentally disabled.  Specifically, Congress\nhas enacted five interrelated programs that provide the major\nportion of federal funds for mentally disabled persons and\nhas conditioned receipt of such funds on the care, treatment,\nand rehabilitation of disabled persons in less restrictive\nalternatives.  These programs include the Developmentally\nDisabled Assistance and Bill of Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง6001\net seq.; the Community Mental Health Center Amendments, 42\nU.S.C. ยง2689; the Special Health Revenue Sharing Act, 42 U.S.C.\nยง246; the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. ยง794; and Title\nXIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง1396 et seq.  Taken\ntogether they reflect a clear federal policy to treat mentally\ndisabled persons in appropriate, less restrictive alternatives\nand not to discriminate in the allocation of federal funds\nagainst any subgroup of such persons by virtue of their unneces-\nsary institutionalization.  Massachusetts has violated and\ncontinues to violate this policy by accepting federal monies\npursuant to these programs but failing to place the plaintiffs\nand members of their class in such less restrictive alternatives\n\n5.  All of the patients in the Hospital are confined\nthere pursuant to Stat. 1970, c. 888, codified as M.G.L.\nc. 123.  The fundamental goal of that statute is to return\nthe mentally ill, through suitable rehabilitation and treat-\nment, to a full, productive, and autonomous life in the community\nas soon as possible and insofar as possible.  In revising\nthis statute, the legislature was particularly concerned\nwith the rights of mental patients and mentally retarded\nresidents after they were confined in institutions.  Among\nthe most important of those rights to which mental patients\nare entitled after confinement are the rights to be confined\nand treated in the least restrictive environment.  Therefore,\nthe legislature was aware that many mental patients stagnated\nin large mental institutions and did not receive suitable\ntreatment in an often inhumane environment that impeded the\nperson's physical or psychological recovery.  The legislature\nwas also especially sensitive to the reality that confinement\nin a mental hospital often impaired the basic constitutional\nrights to liberty, to travel, to privacy and to association.\nIn order to minimize any infringement on these constitutional\nrights, the legislature provided that persons confined under\nM.G.L. c. 123 be placed in the least restrictive setting con-\nsistent with suitable treatment.  It contemplated that persons\nconfined in the Hospital should have available to them a con-\ntinuum of phased treatment settings ranging from large\n\ninstitutions such as the Hospital to smaller, less restric-\ntive facilities that would promote the patients' early\nreintegration to a normal life in the community.  As the need\nfor any restriction on a person's liberty decreased and the\npatient's level of function improved, the legislature intended\nthat they should move along that continuum of alternatives.\n6.  This class action, arising under the United States\nConstitution and its statutes and the laws of the Commonwealth\nof Massachusetts, is brought by patients confined under the\ncontrol of the Department of Mental Health at the Northampton\nState Hospital and other facilities in Region I of the Common-\nwealth of Massachusetts established to provide treatment to\nthe mentally ill and mentally retarded of that area.  The\nplaintiffs seek to compel the defendants not to deprive them\nof their liberty, their rights of association, assembly,\nspeech, belief, travel, and privacy, and their right to treat-\nment and rehabilitation, except under the least restrictive\nconditions necessary, as guaranteed by the First, Eighth,\nNinth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitu-\ntion, 42 U.S.C. ยง6010, 42 U.S.C. ยง2689, 42 U.S.C. ยง246,\n42 U.S.C. ยง1396 et seq., 29 U.S.C. ยง794, and M.G.L. cc. 19\nand 123.  Specifically this action seeks to compel the defen-\ndants to create sufficient and adequate treatment settings or\nfacilities which are less restrictive than the Hospital as\n\npresently constituted, and to place the plaintiffs therein.\nSuch settings or facilities include but are not limited to\ncommunity clinics, halfway houses, nursing homes, rest homes,\ngroup homes, and other residential environments.\nII.  JURISDICTION\n7.  This action arises under the Civil Rights Act,\n42 U.S.C. 1983, the First, Eighth, Ninth; and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the United States Constitution, Developmentally\nDisabled Assistance and Bill of Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง6010;\nCommunity Mental Health Center Amendments, 42 U.S.C. ยง2689;\nSpecial Health Revenue Sharing Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง246; Title XIX\nof the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง1396 et seq., Rehabili-\ntation Act, 29 U.S.C. ยง794, and, pursuant to the Court's pendent\njurisdiction, under M.G.L. cc. 19 and 123.  The jurisdiction\nof this Court is based upon 28 U.S.C. ยงยง1331, 1343(3) and (4).\nDeclaratory relief is sought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง2201-2.\nThe amount in controversy exceeds Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000)\nexclusive of interest and costs, for each plaintiff.\nIII.  PLAINTIFFS\n8.  David Brewster is a 24 year-old resident of the\nNorthampton State Hospital.  Mr. Brewster was brought to the\n\nHospital in 1968 at the age of sixteen and has remained there\nwithout interruption.  He has spent the greater part of the last\neight years locked on his ward with virtually no treatment,\nrecreation, or exercise, despite the absence of evidence in\nthe medical records of any violent or disruptive behavior.  No\neducation has ever been provided for Mr. Brewster, despite\nnumerous requests by him for reading instruction.  At the most\nrecent judicial review of his confinement in September 1976,\nthe staff determined that placement in a less restrictive\nalternative setting or facility was necessary for Mr. Brewster's\ntreatment needs, that he had in fact regressed during his con-\nfinement at the Hospital, but that no setting or facility\nexisted appropriate for Mr. Brewster.  Therefore, no effort at\nplacement has been made or is reasonably expected to be made.\n9.  Hector Santiago is a 29 year-old Puerto Rican\nresident at the Northampton State Hospital.  Mr. Santiago\nhas been confined intermittently since 1973.  Mr. Santiago\nspeaks primarily Spanish and has great difficulty in communi-\ncating with any Hospital employee on his ward or unit because\nno staff member is able to converse in Spanish.  Furthermore,\nno psychological tests or psychotherapy has been administered\nbecause of this language barrier.  His most recent psychiatric\nevaluation, completed in June 1976, recommends placement in a\ncommunity setting, with appropriate treatment and supervision.\n\n10\nMr. Santiago has been recommended for this placement since\n1973.  There is no evidence in his records that the Hospital\nhas ever taken any action to secure a suitable community\nplacement for Mr. Santiago.  Instead he has been released\nperiodically to his home, which lacks any suitable support,\nsupervision, or treatment.  Due to the absence of a suitable\ncommunity facility, and the inadequacies of existing community\nsettings, Mr. Santiago has been involuntarily returned to the\nHospital, each time in a regressed condition.\n10.  Richard Schneider is a 26 year-old resident of the\nNorthampton State Hospital.  Mr. Schneider has been confined\nsince 1973.  He was once released on convalescent leave status\nfrom the Hospital to a boarding house that did not have any\nsupport, supervision, or treatment.  Mr. Schneider was returned\nin eighteen days from this placement in a deteriorated and re-\ngressed condition.  Due to the absence of suitable community\nfacilities and the inadequacies of existing alternative facil-\nities, no effort has been made to place Mr. Schneider in a\ncommunity setting, although he would benefit by placement in\na suitable community alternative.\n11.  Donald Gaboury is a 25 year-old resident of the\nNorthampton State Hospital.  Mr. Gaboury was confined at the\nage of five at the Belchertown State School for the Retarded\n\nLI\nfrom which he was transferred in 1970 to the Hospital along\nwith 200 other retarded persons after the filing of a lawsuit\nin the United States District Court challenging the conditions\nof confinement and the overcrowding at the School.  There is\nabsolutely no evidence in the records that he is mentally ill.\nMr. Gaboury was locked in seclusion from July 9, 1971 to February\n9, 1973, every evening without interruption, although there\nis no evidence in the records of any serious threats of vio-\nlence or significantly disruptive behavior during the time he\nhas been confined at the Hospital.  A social services report,\ncompleted in 1974, recommends that Mr. Gaboury be placed in a\ngroup home for retarded persons since the Hospital has no staff\nor facilities to devise or implement any treatment program for\nsuch persons.  No such placement has ever been effected due\nprimarily to the absence of a suitable community facility\navailable to patients at the Hospital.\n12.  Martin Weinberg is a 34 year-old resident of the\nNorthampton State Hospital.  Mr. Weinberg was confined in 1959\nat the Paul A. Dever State School for the Retarded from which\nhe was transferred in 1967 to the Hospital.  There is absolutely\nno evidence in the records that he is mentally ill.  Mr.\nWeinberg has continually regressed during this eighteen years\nof confinement due to the lack of treatment for his condition.\nAt the most recent periodic review in August 1976, placement\n\n12\nin a community facility for the retarded was recommended since\nthe Hospital has no staff or facilities to devise or implement\nany treatment program for such persons.  No such placement has\never been effected, due primarily to the absence of a suitable\ncommunity facility available to patients at the Hospital.\n13.  Albert Potter is a 34 year-old resident of the\nNorthampton State Hospital.  Mr. Potter has been confined since\n1962.  He has been released periodically from the Hospital,\nbut has been involuntarily returned on seventeen separate\noccasions.  On each occasion, Mr. Potter has been released to\nlive in an apartment by himself, with no provision for suitable\nsupport, supervision, or treatment.  Within the past two years,\nhe has been readmitted to the Hospital six times, always in a\nregressed condition.  During each hospitalization and prior to\ndischarge, the Hospital staff recommended a placement in a\nsupervised community setting where Mr. Potter can receive suit-\nable treatment.  At no time has such placement ever been effected.\nDue to the absence of suitable community facilities and the\ninadequacies of existing alternative facilities, no effort is\npresently being made or can reasonably be expected to be made\nto place Mr. Potter in a less restrictive alternative.\n14.  Ella Bailey is a 73 year-old resident of the\nNorthampton State Hospital.  Ms. Bailey has been confined since\n\n13\n1950.  During the past seven years, Ms. Bailey has been per-\nmitted to live outside the Hospital in a nursing home.  She\nhas, however, been returned to the Hospital due to the inade-\nquacies in existing alternative facilities.  In September\n1976, the social service staff recommended placement in an\nappropriate nursing home.  The Hospital has not effected this\nplacement, due primarily to the absence of a suitable community\nfacility.\n15.  Thonnie Rowell is a 62 year-old resident of the\nNorthampton State Hospital.  Mr. Rowell has been confined\nsince 1940.  The medical notes in his record comprise only\neight pages for the entire 36 years of his hospitalization.\nIn a psychiatric evaluation in July 1974, placement in a rest\nhome was recommended.  No effort was made to accomplish this\nplacement at that time.  In a subsequent psychiatric evaluation\nin July 1976, placement in a community setting was again\nrecommended but deemed impossible because of the lack of a\nbirth certificate for Mr. Rowell.  The lack of suitable treat-\nment within the Hospital and the failure of the Hospital to\nplace him in an appropriate less restrictive alternative have\nresulted in a serious regression of Mr. Rowell's condition.\nDue to the absence of an appropriate community facility and\nthe inadequacies of existing community settings, Mr. Rowell\ncontinues to be confined at the Hospital.  Stephen Ferrarone,\n\n14\nhis next friend, is a paralegal with the Mental Patients\nAdvocacy Project at the Northampton State Hospital and has\nassisted Mr. Rowell in other matters.  Mr. Rowell has no other\nfamily or friends.\n16.  Mary McGuillicuddy is a 70 year-old resident of the\nNorthampton State Hospital.  Ms. McGuillicuddy has been con-\nfined without interruption since 1935.  Immediately after her\ntransfer from the Foxboro State Hospital to Northampton in\nAugust 1975, placement in a nursing home was recommended by\nthe Hospital staff.  No effort was made to accomplish this\nplacement.  At her most recent psychiatric review in February\n1977, such placement was again recommended.  Despite repeated\nnotations in her medical records suggesting the need for nursing\ncare, no effort has yet been made to locate a suitable nursing\nhome for Ms. McGuillicuddy.  Due to the absence of suitable\ncommunity facility and the inadequacies of existing alterna-\ntive facilities, Ms. McGuillicuddy remains confined to her\nward at the Hospital.  Carol Booth, her next friend, is a\nparalegal with the Mental Patients Advocacy Project at the\nNorthampton State Hospital and has assisted Mr. McGuillicuddy\nin other matters.  Ms. McGuillicuddy has no other family or\nfriends.\n17.

Plaintiffs David Brewster, Hector Santiago, Richard\nSchneider, Donald Gaboury, Martin Weinberg, Albert Potter,\nElla Bailey, Thonnie Rowell, and Mary McGuillicuddy sue on\ntheir own behalf and pursuant to Rules 23(a), 23(b)(l) and\n23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, on behalf\n\n18\nof that class of persons who are or who may be hospitalized\nin the Northampton State Hospital pursuant to M.G.L. c. 123,\nand who now or may, in the future, need placement in a least\nrestrictive setting, consistent with suitable care and treat-\nment, and including those who now or may be placed on leave\nstatus by the Hospital.  As persons confined in the Northampton\nState Hospital who need placement in a least restrictive setting,\nplaintiffs David Brewster, Hector Santiago, Richard Schneider,\nDonald Gaboury, Martin Weinberg, Albert Potter, Ella Bailey,\nThonnie Rowell, and Mary McGuillicuddy can fairly and adequately\nrepresent and protect the interests of this class.  The class\nrepresented by the named plaintiffs is so numerous that joinder\nof all members is impractical.  The questions of law and fact\npresented in this action are common to members of the class.\nThe claims of the representative parties are typical of the\nclaims of the class.  Prosecution of separate actions by\nindividual members of the class would create a risk of incon-\nsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual\nmembers of the class which would establish incompatible\nstandards of conduct for the defendants.  The prosecution of\nseparate actions would also create a risk of adjudications with\nrespect to individual members of the class which would, as a\npractical matter, be dispositive of the interests of the other\nmembers not parties to the adjudications or substantially impair\nor impede their ability to protect their interests.\n\n19\n18.  The defendants have refused to act on grounds\ngenerally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate\nfinal injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief\nwith respect to the class as a whole; that is, the defendants\nhave refused to provide the class with suitable treatment in\nthe least restrictive setting as required by the United States\nConstitution, 42 U.S.C. ยง6010, 42 U.S.C. ยง2689, 42 U.S.C.\nยง246, 42 U.S.C. ยง1396 et seq., 29 U.S.C. ยง794, and M.G.L.\ncc. 19 and 123.\nV.

DUTIES\n33.  Under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution, the defendants have the duty not to deprive the\n\n25\npatient plaintiffs of their liberty in other than the least\nrestrictive setting.\n34.  Under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution, the defendants have the duty to provide the\npatient plaintiffs with suitable treatment under the least\nrestrictive conditions.\n35.  Under the First Amendment to the United States\nConstitution, the defendants have the duty not to abridge the\npatient plaintiffs' rights of association, assembly, speech,\nbelief, and travel except with the least drastic means avail-\nable and in the least restrictive setting appropriate for the\nplaintiffs' condition.\n36.  Under the First, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments\nto the United States Constitution, the defendants have the\nduty not to infringe upon the patient plaintiffs' right of\nprivacy by confining them in other than the least restrictive\nsetting.\n37.  Under the Eighth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution, the defendants have the duty not to confine the\npatient plaintiffs in a setting more restrictive than is neces-\nsary to provide them with suitable treatment consistent with\ntheir needs.\n\n26\n38.  Under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution, the defendants have the duty not to deny the\npatient plaintiffs or any subclass of the patient plaintiffs\nthe equal protection of the law by discriminating against them\nin the allocation of benefits pursuant to federal statutory\nprograms.\n39.  Under the Developmental Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.\nยง6010, the defendants have a duty to use any federal funds\nreceived under the Act to provide the plaintiffs with appro-\npriate treatment under the least restrictive conditions.\n40.  Under the Community Mental Health Center Amend-\nments of 1975, 42 U.S.C. ยง2689, the defendants have a duty to\nprovide a complete continuum of mental health services for the\npatient plaintiffs that is designed to avoid unnecessary\ninstitutionalization and to provide treatment in alternative\ncommunity facilities.\n41.  Under the Special Health Revenue Sharing Act,\n42 U.S.C. ยง246, the defendants have a duty to eliminate the\ninappropriate institutionalization of the patient plaintiffs\nand to insure the availability of appropriate community programs\n42.  Under Title XIX of the Social Security Act,\n42 U.S.C. ยง1396 et seq., the defendants have a duty to insure\n\n27\nthat funds appropriated pursuant to the Act are expended to\nprovide care and treatment in noninstitutional facilities when-\never appropriate for the needs of the patient plaintiffs.\n43.  Under the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. ยง794,\nthe defendants have the duty not to discriminate against any\nhandicapped person or class of persons in the provision of\nfederally assisted programs.\n44.  Under M.G.L. c. 123, the defendants have the duty\nto return the mentally ill to a full, productive, and autono-\nmous life in the community as soon as possible and insofar as\npossible.\n45.  Specifically, M.G.L. c. 123, ยง4, requires the\ndefendants to periodically review the condition of every person\nwithin the care of the Department to determine whether place-\nment in a community setting is appropriate or whether continued\nhospitalization is required.\n46.

To fulfill its constitutional and statutory respon-\nsibilities, the defendants must explore all alternative\ntreatment settings or facilities and promptly place the patient\nplaintiffs in the alternatives reasonably suited to their\nneeds.

Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 19, ยง24, the defendants are\nmandated to develop and maintain comprehensive mental health\nand mental retardation services including, but not limited to,\ninpatient, outpatient, and partial hospitalization services.\nSuch services must be established to provide preventive, pre-\ncare and aftercare treatment consistent with the treatment\nneeds of persons residing in Region I which include the patient\nplaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class.\n49.  Therefore, the defendants are constitutionally and\nstatutorily required to provide, as alternatives to the\n\n29\nNorthampton State Hospital as presently constituted, smaller,\nmore suitable, and less restrictive treatment settings or\nfacilities such as community clinics, halfway houses, nursing\nhomes, rest homes, group homes, day houses, night houses, and\nother appropriate residential environments.  To the extent\nthat such least restrictive alternatives do not presently\nexist, the defendants have the duty to create new alternative\nfacilities or to upgrade and restructure existing but inade-\nquate alternative facilities so that all the patient plaintiffs\nmay be placed in alternative facilities to their benefit.\nVII.  STATEMENT OF FACTS\n50.  Plaintiffs David Brewster, Hector Santiago, R.ichard\nSchneider, Donald Gaboury, Martin Weinberg, Albert Potter, Ella\nBailey, Thonnie Rowell, and Mary McGuillicuddy should no\nlonger be confined in the Hospital but instead should be placed\nin lesser restrictive settings where suitable treatment can be\nprovided and where there is significantly less abridgement\nof their rights of association, assembly, speech, travel, and\nprivacy.  According to M.G.L. c. 123 and the Regulations of\nthe Department of Mental such less restrictive alternatives\ninclude, but are not limited to, community mental health\nclinics, halfway houses, nursing homes, rest homes, group homes,\n\n30\nand other residential environments.  The named plaintiffs have\nnot been placed by the defendants in such alternative facil-\nities which will provide suitable treatment and instead have\ncontinually been confined at the Hospital, in violation of the\nFirst, Eighth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United\nStates Constitution, 42 U.S.C. ยง6010, 42 U.S.C. ยง2689, 42 U.S.C.\nยง246, 42 U.S.C. ยง1396, 29 U.S.C. ยง794, and M.G.L. cc. 19 and\n123.\n51.  A significant portion of the present and annual\npopulation of the Hospital, including the named plaintiffs and\nconstituting the plaintiff class, should no longer be confined\nin the Hospital but instead should be placed in lesser re-\nstrictive settings where suitable treatment can be provided and\nwhere there is significantly less abridgement of their rights\nof association, assembly, speech, travel, and privacy.  Such\nalternatives include, but are not limited to, community mental\nhealth clinics, halfway houses, nursing homes, rest homes,\ngroup homes, and other residential environments.  In violation\nof the guarantees of the First, Eighth, Ninth, and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the United States Constitution and M.G.L. cc. 19\nand 123, the members of the plaintiff class have not, however,\nbeen placed by the defendants in suitable, less restrictive\nalternative facilities.\n\n31\n52.  Inappropriate and unnecessary  institutionalization\nof mentally disabled persons often results in their intellec-\ntual, emotional, physical, and social regression as well as the\nloss of those skills necessary to regain their self-sufficiency.\nPlaintiffs David Brewster, Hector Santiago, Richard Schneider,\nDonald Gaboury, Martin Weinberg, Albert Potter, Ella Bailey,\nThonnie Rowell, and Mary McGuillicuddy have suffered such re-\ngression and loss of self-sufficiency as a consequence of their\nprolonged and unnecessary institutionalization.  Their ties and\ncommunication with their families and friends have become\nweaker, thereby fostering further dependence.  Because they are\ndenied any opportunity to reintegrate into the mainstream of\nsociety through placement in a residential community treatment\nprogram, their mental conditions continue to deteriorate while\nthey remain confined in an institution.\n53.  Several community mental health centers presently\nserve mentally ill persons residing in certain areas of Region I\nin Western Massachusetts.  Pursuant to the provisions of the\nCommunity Mental Health Center Amendments, 42 U.S.C. ยง2689 and\nits predecessor, these centers are mandated to provide preven-\ntive services to persons who otherwise would be hospitalized\nand aftercare services to discharged hospital patients who\nmight otherwise be forced to return to a hospital.  In addition,\nthe centers are required to provide a continuum of mental health\nservices including the creation of community residential\n\n32\ntreatment programs, in order to avoid or eliminate inappropriate\ninstitutionalization.  The centers are further required to\nassist local courts in the evaluation of individuals within\ntheir jurisdiction for the purpose of assessing whether in-\npatient hospitalization is necessary.\n54.  Plaintiffs David Brewster, Richard Schneider,\nAlbert Potter, Mary McGuillicuddy, and other members of the\nplaintiff class are entitled to receive services from these\ncommunity mental health centers and could benefit from such\nservices, including placement in a less restrictive community\nsetting.  None of the patient plaintiffs have ever received\nthe services offered by these centers Tior benefited by the\nfederal funds expended pursuant to the Community Mental Health\nCenter Amendments, due primarily to their inappropriate con-\nfinement at the Northampton State Hospital.  Many members of\nthe plaintiff class, although otherwise eligible for such\nservices, have never been evaluated by these centers as to the\nnecessity for hospitalization and have therefore been needlessly\ninstitutionalized when treatment in a less restrictive setting\nwas more appropriate for the individual's treatment needs.\n55.  Several of the named plaintiffs and members of\nthe plaintiff class are developmentally disabled and reside\nat the Northampton State Hospital solely as a result of being\n\n33\ntransferred from the Belchertown State School.  Pursuant to\nthe provisions of the Developmentally Disabled Assistance and\nBill of Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง6010, they are entitled to ade-\nquate treatment that is designed to maximize their developmental\npotential and that is administered in the least restrictive\nalternative.  The named plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff\nclass should no longer be confined in the Hospital, which pro-\nvides no treatment, no specialized services, no rehabilitation\nprogram, and no vocational training for developmentally dis-\nabled persons, but instead should be placed in lesser restric-\ntive settings where suitable treatment can be provided and where\nthere is significantly less abridgement of their rights of\nliberty, association, assembly, speech, travel, and privacy.\nOther developmentally disabled persons do receive such treat-\nment, services, and training in less restrictive environments,\nbut no federal funds pursuant to this Act are expended for\nthose persons residing at the Hospital.  Such alternatives\ninclude, but are not limited to, halfway houses, group homes,\nrest homes, shared apartments, and other residential environ-\nments.  In violation of the guarantees of the First, Eighth,\nNinth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitu-\ntion, the Developmental Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง6010, the\nRehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. ยง794, and M.G.L. cc. 19 and 123,\nthe plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class have not,\nhowever, been placed by the defendants in suitable less restric-\ntive alternative facilities.\n\n34\n56.  The named patient plaintiffs and the members of\nthe plaintiff class have not been and cannot reasonably expect\nto be placed in less restrictive alternatives where suitable\ntreatment is provided, because, inter alia:\na.  There is poor record keeping at the Northampton\nState Hospital, which impedes a determination of\nwhether a patient should be placed in a less\nrestrictive setting and includes no documentation\nof the consideration given to placement in a\ncommunity setting or facility;\nb.  The defendants regularly fail to explore and invest-\nigate less restrictive alternative settings;\nc.  The defendants have not established adequate\nplacement procedures for patients at the Hospital;\nd.  The defendants have no procedures for referring\nprospective patients to less restrictive alterna-\ntive settings prior to admission;\ne.  There is not adequate deployment of staff by the\ndefendants to effect proper placements;\nf.  There is not adequate deployment of staff to\nmonitor and supervise existing placements and to\nfacilitate the transition from the Hospital to a\nless restrictive setting;\n\n35\ng.  The defendants have not provided enough places in\nexisting alternative facilities in Region I to\ngive the named plaintiffs and the plaintiff class\nsuitable treatment in the least restrictive setting.\nFor instance, there is not one supervised resi-\ndential halfway house in the entire Springfield\nArea, although the city of Springfield is the\nsecond largest city in Massachusetts;\nh.  The quality of care provided or approved by the\ndefendants in the few existing alternative facil-\nities in Region I is so low that the patient\nplaintiffs and the plaintiff class would be harmed\nand not benefited if placed in such alternative\nfacilities;\ni.  The defendants have failed to establish or enforce\nminimum standards for alternative facilities that\nwill insure that persons placed in such facilities\nare benefited and not harmed;\nj.  The defendants have failed to allocate the neces-\nsary resources and to supervise the establishment\nof a continuum of less restrictive alternatives\nthat will provide suitable treatment for a broad\nrange of patients' conditions;\n\n36\nk.  The defendants have failed to make full use of the\nevaluation, preventive care, and aftercare\nservices of community mental health centers and to\ncoordinate its admission and discharge policies\nwith the practices of these facilities;\n1.  The defendants have failed to allocate any places\nin existing less restrictive alternative facil-\nities for retarded persons or to establish any new\nless restrictive alternatives in order to provide\nsuitable treatment for retarded persons confined\nin the Hospital;\nm.  The defendants have failed to coordinate and imple-\nment any comprehensive plan for the establishment\nand maintenance of an adequate number of suitable,\nless restrictive alternative settings.\n57.  The defendants' failure to provide an adequate\nnumber of appropriate community placements consistent with the\ntreatment needs of the patient plaintiffs results from a\npattern and practice of disregarding their duty to develop and\nestablish a continuum of less restrictive alternatives, all in\nviolation of the United States Constitution, 42 U.S.C. ยง6010,\n42 U.S.C. ยง2689, 42 U.S.C. ยง246, 42 U.S.C. ยง1396, 29 U.S.C.\nยง794, and M.G.L. cc. 19 and 123.\n\n37\nVIII.  CAUSES OF ACTION\n58.

DUKAKIS, ET AL.,)\nDefendants  )\nMEMORANDUM\nDecember 23, 1981\nFREEDMAN, D.J.\nI.  INTRODUCTION\nOn December 7, 1978 the Court received a Consent Decree\nin the above-entitled matter, signed by representatives of the\nplaintiff class and by virtually all the senior executive offi -\ncers of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  In this Decree, the\ndefendants bound themselves and their successors in office to\nestablish \"a comprehensive system of appropriate, less restrictive\ntreatment, training, and support services\" for mentally disabled\npersons in the western part of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\nConsent Decree, 1 3.  The Decree's explicit goal is to replace,\nor virtually replace, Northampton State Hospital with this\ncomprehensive system.\nAs in the fast with other Decrees, the rosy atmosphere\nof cooperation and consensus existing when the Consent Decree was\nfiled has grown murkier during the years of implementation.  A\nprevious opinion of this Court in the same case, at 520 F.Supp.\n882 (D. Mass. 1981) gives the flavor of the difficulties encountered\nby the Court in overseeing the process of implementation.\nThe current round of hearings and memoranda is Dronroted\nby the defendants' massive reductions in mandated orograraming\nfor mentally disabled class members.  The defendants do not deny\nthat the services being reduced or eliminated and the new programming\nbeing cancelled are required by the Consent Decree.  They justify\n\nthe reductions, eliminations and cancellationsโwhich amount in\neffect virtually to a dismantling of large components of the\ncommunity mental health systemโby pointing to the Legislature.\nThe Legislature, according to the defendants, is to blame for\nthese reductions because of its failure to appropriate adequate\nfunds to support programming mandated by the Decree.\nOn August 4, 1981, the Court issued a temporary re-\nstraining order, and after hearing on September 9, 1981, the\nCourt on September 15, 1981 issued a preliminary  injunction\nbarring the defendants from eliminating or reducing existing\nrequired programming, or cancelling plans for prospective\nprograms required by the Decree.  A final paragraph of the\nCourt's injunction required the defendants to report in writing\non their efforts to secure the additional funding which they\nclaimed was necessary to comply with the Decree.\nA Motion to Suspend Injunction Pending Appeal was filed\nbefore this Court and denied; this denial was subsequently\nappealed by the defendants to the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the First Circuit and on November 16, 1981 the Court of\nAppeals stayed all the provisions of the injunction, except for\nthe paragraph requiring the defendants to report on their efforts\nto secure funding.  The Court of Appeals stated in its memorandum,\nhowever:\nWe recognize that as the District Court did\nnot cite the Carey case, supra [New York State\nAssociation for Retarded Children v. Carey\"! 6Tl\nF.Zd 162 (ZncTCir. 1980)], it may not have had\nthe issues therein brought to its attention.\nWe also note possible confusion over the extent\nto which the court's order is actually meant to\napply to the Legislature and to require defen -\ndants to violate state budgetary restrictions.\nBecause of these factors, and because time may\nbe of the essence to secure for the plaintiffs\nthe maximum level of assistance to which they\nare entitled, we provide that prior to our\nJanuary sitting the District Court is free to\nreconsider and to modify its Injunction not-\nwithstanding the pendancy of this appeal, pro-\nvided we are given timely advance notice of such\naction which might, of course, moot this appeal.\nIn response to this language,  this Court is today issuing\n- 2 -\n\na revised preliminary injunction, along with this Memorandum,\nin order to eliminate any possible confusion as to the intent\nand target of its orders.  In formulating the revised order, the\nCourt has reviewed additional affidavits, depositions, and other\ndiscovery material submitted by the plaintiffs and defendants.\nIn addition, the plaintiffs have filed a Motion to Revise the\nInjunction; the Court received oral argument on this motion on\nDecember 17, 1981.\nThe defendants have attempted to cast the current con-\ntroversy as a dispute between this Court and the Legislature\nover appropriation of funds, inflating the issue to unmanagable\nconstitutional proportions.  It is apparent now that certain\nambiguous language in this Court's Memorandum of September 15,\n_1981 has added to rather than decreased the confusion.  In fact,\nas will be demonstrated below, it is the defendants who have\nfailed to perform their obligations under the Decree and under\nexisting authority.  It is the defendants, and only the de-\nfendants, whose conduct is the target of the Court's orders.\nThe Court well recognizes that the Legislature is not a defendant.\nII.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nThe 1982 fiscal year (\"FY  '82\") in the Commonwealth of\nMassachusetts runs from July 1, 1981 through June 30, 1982.\nOverall planning within the Department of Mental Health (\"DMH\")\nfor programming to operate during FY  '82 obviously takes place\nmany months prior to July 1, 1981.  This planning is translated\ninto a budget proposal which is passed up through the Executive\nBranch eventually to the Legislature.\nf  Insofar as the programming required by the Consent\nDecree is concerned, with some minor exceptions, the proposed\nscope of services for FY  '82 โ including old, expanded and new\nprogrammingโwas deemed sufficient by the Court and plaintiffs\n/  to satisfy generally all applicable provisions of the Decree.\nIt is important to note, however, that neither the court-appointed\n- 3 -\n\nMonitor nor the plaintiffs are in a position to .\"judge competently\nthe reasonableness of the defendants' translation of programming\ninto dollars.  Putting this issue another way, the focus of the\nCourt's attention is on the development of appropriate programming;\nthe determination as to the amounts and source of funds for this\nprogramming is entirely within the discretion of the defendants,\nthough they may keep the Court_j nformed of their decisions.  The\n1\noverall budget request made by the defendants to the Legislature\nfor FY  '82 to support Consent Decree programming in the community\nwas slightly in excess of 53 million dollars.\nIn July of 1981, the Court was informed through the\nMonitor of the fact that the Legislature had apprppriated approx-\nimately 5 million dollars less than the defendants' budget request.\nLater that month the plaintiffs filed their Motions for Temporary\nRestraining Order and Preliminary Injunction, alleging that the\ndefendants' planned wholesale cancellations and reductions of\nprogramming, justifying these reductions and cancellations by\npointing to the reduced appropriation.  The planning for these\nreductions and cancellations was apparently underway, without\nany prior notification to Jthe Court or motion to revj.g_e the Consent\nDecree.  In fact, the Court was noj^ even.\nprograms to be reduced or eliminated until just prior to the\nhearing on plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction, on\nSeptember 9, 1981.\nThe destructive impact of these cuts is not disputed.\nOver 100 persons ready for community placement will be indefinitely\nretained at Northampton State Hospital.  Current census is approxi-\nmately 225.  Court clinic programs, badly needed adolescent\nservices, the only Hispanic residential program and a large segment\nof programming for the elderly will be eliminated.  Substantial\nreductions are slated for service coordination, assessment, and\nindividual service planning, throughout the Region.\nIn framing its preliminary injunction, the Court took\n- 4 -\n\ninto consideration the foregoing facts and these additional\nconsiderations:\n''First, xthe defendants began the process of reducing and\neliminating programming while a request for supplemental appro-\npriation was still pending before the Legislature.  This\nsupplemental appropriation, if approved, would be more than\nadequate to replace the funding which defendants deemed necessary\nfor all required services.\n^Second, the defendants began the reduction of programming,\nwithout\"~at any point filing any motion pursuant to F.R.Civ.P. 60\n(b) (6) to amend the Consent Decree.  In other words, the defen-\ndants, faced with what they felt were barriers to implementation\nof the Decree, began independently choosing which provisions of\nthe Decree would be complied with, which would be partially\ncomplied with, and which would be ignored.\n/Third,,, the defendants apparently assumed the reduction\nin appropriation warranted immediate proportionate reductions\nin programming.  However, the DMH has been notoriously imprecise in\nits estimations of the amounts of money needed by it for Consent\nDecree programming.  For example, the DMH reverted to the\nCommonwealth's general fund in FY  '81 at least $11 million in\nfunds requested and appropriated but unspent.  It was not clear\nthat the reductions in programming were fully justified by the\ndecreased appropriation.\n^Fourth, the cancellations and program reductions would\nhave gone into effect without the defendants attempting first\nto transfer funds which may have been available in other accounts\nwithin the Department of Mental Health or under the control of\nthe Executive Office of Human Services.  It is not clear to what\nextent these transfers are within the discretion of the defendants,\nor require Legislative approval.  In any case, mechanisms exist\nto effect such transfers and they are not uncommon.\n, the Court recognized that the budgetary and\n- 5 -\n\nspending mechanisms in the Commonwealth are somewhat unclear,\nand subject to various informal pressures.  Even the scope of\nthe defendants' formal power to obtain access to funds is in\ndispute in regard to, for example, the defendants' power to\nshift monies from the institutional to the community account.\nFunding projections themselves have a will-of-the-wisp quality.\nFor example, the additional amount of funds required to insure\ncompliance with all provisions of the Consent Decree was esti-\nmated at the hearings in September before this Court as more\nthan $5 million.  By November 19, 1981, the projected shortfall\nwas down to slightly more than $3 million.\nIn consideration of all these factors, the Court con-\ncluded on September 15, 1981, that the wisest course was to\nenjoin the defendants' proposed reductions, at least long\nenough to permit the Legislature to act on the supjalemental\nbudget request.  The Court did not, therefore, enter into a\nthorough examination of the defendants' overall good faith\nin using all the means at their disposal to secure funding.\nLikewise, the Court did ;noยฃ comment upon the appropriateness of\ninstituting programmatic reductions without first moving to\nrevise the Consent Decree.  Since the Legislature has chosen not\nto act, favorably or unfavorably, on the supplemental budget\nrequest, and since the defendants have proceeded to implement\nvarious programmatic reductions and cutbacks, it is now appro-\npriate for the Court to examine carefully the defendants' efforts\nto secure what they conceive to be adequate funding to support\nConsent Decree programs.\nIII.  THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE DEFENDANTS IN\nIMPLEMENTING THE CONSENT DECREE\nThe question before the Court on the facts described\nabove is very simple:  What are the responsibilities of defendants\ncharged with the inrolementation of a consent decree, when an initial\nbudget appropriation appears to be insufficient to support mandated\n- 6 -\n\nconsent decree programming?\nThe Court holds that the defendants have^minimally,\ntwo responsibilities under the terms of the Decree in thi_s\nsituation. f First,, before reducing any programming required\nby the Decree, defendants have an obligation to exhaust all\nefforts to obtain necessary funds, (^econdy when these efforts\nare exhausted, or when defendants conclude that failure to\nmake revisions in the Consent Decree would create a risk of\nsubstantial harm to plaintiff class members, defendants have\nan obligation--prior to any reduction in programming that would\nviolate the Consent Decree--to present the Court with an\nappropriate motion to revise the Consent Decree pursuant to\nF.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6).  Morris v. Travisono, 509 F.2d 1358, 1361\n(1st Cir. 1975).\nThe defendants have failed to perform either of these\nobligations.\n/Tirsty  the defendants have not made best efforts to\nlocate funds required to support the Consent Decree.  The affi-\ndavits of Bruce Bullen and George Hertz make it clear that, at\nleast prior to December 16, 1981, the Legislature x\\/as never\ninformed that the funding shortage for Consent Decree programs\nwas in fact approximately half of the amount originally projected\n'  \"  '  2  \"  \"\"~\"~  ~~  ~\"\nby the defendants.  It is inconceivable that this change would\nhave been irrelevant to the Legislature.  Further, the defendants\nhave not made efforts to effect the transfer of funds from\nLayered beneath this question is a second question, of\nfar more profound constitutional significance:  What are the powers\nof a district court in relation to a legislative body which, by its\nfailure to appropriate adequate funds, renders it impossible for\ndefendants to comply with a consent decree?  As__noted in Section\nit_jLs unnecessary to .address, this difficult questTon_ in_j>jrder Jto\nresolve the issue before the Court.  ~\n2\nBy letter of December 16, 1981, Governor King has\napparently informed Chairman Michael C. Creedon, of the House Ways\nand Means Committee, for the first time of the decreased need\nfor supplemental funds.  This letter was first presented to the\nCourt at oral argument on plaintiffs' Motion to Revise Preliminary\nInjunction on December 17, 1981.\n- 7 -\n\nexisting accounts to ยฃOver_,Cons^nt Decree Programs,^despite the\nfact that a significant budget surplus is projected for the\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts during the current fiscal year.\nNo effort has been made to access emergency funds available to\nthe Governor.  No efforts have been made to transfer funds from\nthe Northampton State Hospital account to the community account\nto cover community programming.\nIn conclusion, the Court is not satisfied that the\ndefendants have made their best efforts to obtain funding\nnecessary for Consent Decree programs.  In particular, the Court\n^_  -\nis not satisfied that the defendants have made all necessary\nefforts to shift funds already appropriated by the Legislature\n3\nto Consent Decree accounts.  The defendants have, at a minimum,\nthe obligation to make these efforts before dismantling the\ncommunity mental health system required by the Decree.\nIn the event that the defendants are unsuccessful in\neffecting transfers or locating funds by taking actions within\ntheir own control, the defendants are ordered to return to this\nCourt with an appropriately drafted motion to revise the Consent\n4\nDecree with full justification for each requested revision.\nโข'These justifications will be specifically and carefully scrutinized.\ni The Court of Appeals has recently suggested that one rationale for\nservice cutbacks โ \"the state's bar to payment of funds without a\nj current appropriation\"--may be inadequate where the degree of\nresulting harm is severe.  Coalition for Basic Human Needs v. King,\n654 F.2d 838, 843 (1st Cir. 1981).\nIV.  THE COURT'S POWERS IN OVERSEEING IMPLEMENTATION\nOF THE CONSENT DECREE\nIt appears undisputed that the Court has at least the\n3\nf  It is important to emphasize that this resolution of the\ndefendants' funding problem would not require any new Legislative\nappropriation, only movement of funds already approved, a far less\nsubstantial intrusion on state government functions.\n4\nIt is now clear that additional or different cuts are now\ncontemplated beyond those described at the hearing on September 9,\n1981.\n- 8 -\n\npowers described above in relation to the Consent Decree:  the\npower to require best efforts and the power to require an\nappropriate motion where these efforts are ^^vaxli^ig,.\nAdditional powers of the Court appear to be less clear.\nThe Court assumed in its opinion of September 15, 1981, and\nstill assumes, that it retains in supervising the implementation\nof this Consent Decree all powers afforded a court after an\nadjudicated finding of unconstitutionality.  Considerable\nauthority exists for this position.  In the case of United States\nv. Board o_f Education ojf Naterbury Connecticut, 560 F. 2d 1103 (2nd\nCir.  1977), the Court of Appeals stated:\nHad the case gone to trial, the school board\nmight have proved that the school system was not\nintentionally segregated.  However, the posture of\nthis litigation now prevents such an inquiry since\nthe Consent Order operates as a litigated finding\nof unconstitutional segregation.\nId., at 1104.\nSee also, Brown v. Neeb, 644 F.2d 551 (6th Cir. 1981);\nUnited States v. Board of Ed o_f City o_f Chicago, 88 F.R.D. 769\n(1981); Inmates of_ Boys' Training School v. Southworth, 76 F.R.D.\n115 (D. R.I. 1977).\nIt is axiomatic that a Consent Decree ratified by a\ncourt, becomes an order carrying the same force and effect as any\norder entered after a contested trial.  United States v. Swift,\n286 U.S. 106, 114-15  (1932).\nThe defendants argue that exercise of the Court's broad\nremedial powers requires a prior finding of violation of constitu-\ntional rights, citing Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267  (1974),\nSwann v. Charlott-Mechlenburg Board p_f_ Education, 402 U.S. 1  (1971),\nand other Supreme Court cases involving adjudicated findings of\nunconstitutionality.  The Court of Appeals has suggested in its\nmemorandum that the absence of an adjudicated finding of unconsti-\ntutionality may be a factor in determining the extent of the Court's\nI remedial powers.\nIn this Court's opinion, such a limitation of a district\n- 9 -\n\nThe plaintiffs have requested that this Court exercise\nits remedial powers by moving to close admissions at Northampton\nState Hospital.  Since the Court has declined to do this, or\nexercise any other remedial option at this time, the question of\nthe precise scope of the Court's powers does not arise.\nV.  THE DISTRICT COURT'S POWERS IN RELATION\nTO THE LEGISLATURE\nClearly, district courts retain the power to issue\norders that have fiscal ramifications, at least where the exercise\nof these powers is based on an adjudicated finding of unconsti-\ntutionally.  Milliken v. Bradley, supra at 289.  It is not clear\nto what extent, if any, the Court's powers to issue orders having\nfiscal ramifications are limited by the absence of an explicit\nadjudication of violations of constitutional rights.\nIn any case, by now__it should be^absoj^u^ly__c_lear that\nthe Court has no intention of ordering the Legislature., .directly\nor indirectly, to do anything.  Any language in the Court's\nprior opinion that appeared to suggest the contrary is regrettable.\nIn fact, the Court did not, on September 15, 1981, and does not\nnow make any order applicable to the Legislature.\nThe Court was aware of the case of New York State Associa-\ntion for Retarded Children v. Carey, 631 F.2d 162 (2nd Cir. 1980),\nbut did not cite it because of its view that the case is inapposite,\nThat case involved an \"express Legislative disapproval\" of certain\nmonies required for consent decree implementation.  Such was not\nthe case here.  Significantly, the court affirmed in that decision\nthe defendants' obligation to use all available discretionary\nefforts to obtain necessary funds.  In addition, the Court in that,\ndecision did not examine the defendants' responsibility to file a\nfn. 5 (cont'd)\ncourt's powers would eliminate the jConsent Decree as_ a means for\nresolution of cases where constitution^T]TTg]jtJ3-^s~ involved*\":  This\ndisappearance would have serious ramifications.. f~ar .litigant s. and\nQQUrtLS..\n- 10 -\n\nmotion to revise--perhaps because the _fa_ilure to fund related\nonly to the ancillary Review Panel and not to programming a_t the\nheart of the Decree, as in the present case.\nThis case is much more in line with a prior decision,\nin the Carey line, at 596 F.2d 27 (2nd Cir. 1979).  There, the\nCourt of Appeals reviewed the district court's orders requiring\nthe hiring of certain staff for the so-called Consumer Advisory\nBoard  (CAB).  The Court stated:\nThe State's second objection on appeal is\nthat the district court's order is vague and\nunenforceable and lacks compliance with F.R.Civ.\nP. 65(d).  See also, Pasadena City Board of\nEducation v. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424 (197617\nThe State officials are concerned, they allege,\nbecause the district court has provided no\nguidance as to what specific actions they are\nto take after their request to the Legislature\nfor appropriations and whether, if the request is\nunsuccessful, what further action would be suffi-\ncient.  But at the same time the State points out\nthat a number of options appear to be available\nto comply with the order, including requests to\nthe supplemental budget under New York Constitu-\ntion Article 7, Sees. 3 and 4.  Moreover, the\nstate claims that there are only three potential\nsources of funds available that it may use to\nfund CAB staff; budgets of the other twenty-one\ndevelopmental centers in the State, funds already\ndesignated for programs for the developmentally\ndisabled, or funds from the executive management\nbudget.\nWe do not think the order lacks specificity.\nIt compels appellants to assure approval and\nfunding for four full-time professional staff\npositions and one full-time secretarial position\nfor the CAB.  The order leaves it to the state\nofficials themselves to determine the exact means\nby which to implement the order, appropriately\nwary of superseding state officials in the proper\nperformance of their governmental functions.\nNewman v.

Carey, 596 F.2d 27,\n38 (2nd Cir. 1979).\nThis Memorandum and Order stand only for the proposition\nthat the defendants must make good faith efforts--meaning they must\nexhaust all available mechanisms--to secure adequate_^funding^for\nthe Decree before abandoning efforts to maintain and initiate a\nmandated services.

CONCLUSION\nBased on the foregoing, the Court concludes that the\nirreparable harm to the plaintiff class members, their likelihood\nof success on the merits and considerations of public interest\nall warrant reissuance of this Court's prior preliminary in-\njunction, with the following revisions and additions:\nParagraph 2:  October 1, 1981 will be revised to\nJanuary 15, 1982.\nParagraphs 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, and 10:  October 15, 1981\nwill be revised to February 1, 1982.\nIn addition, the Court will add the following paragraphs:\nParagraph 11:  Undertake any and all actions within their\ndiscretion to obtain, by accessing funds under their discretionary\ncontrol, by transferring funds under their discretion, by seeking\napproval from the Legislature of transfers of funds, by obtaining\nsupplemental or deficiency appropriations, or by whatever\nmechanism may be available to the defendants sufficient funding\nto comply with all provisions of the Consent Decree.

In the\ninterest of expeditiously resolving the few areas of con-\ntroversy remaining between the parties, therefore, the Court\nwill proceed directly to the heart of the matter.\nPursuant to Paragraph 57 of the Final Consent Decree\nentered into by the parties and approved by this Court on\nDecember 7, 1978, the court-appointed Monitor has submitted a\nRecommended Order providing for the Court's disengagement\nfrom the Consent Decree.  On March 2, 1987 the Court held a\nhearing on this recommendation at which counsel for plain-\ntiffs and defendants presented oral arguments.  The Monitor\nwas also present and addressed some comments to the\nCourt.1  Having carefully considered the briefs and oral\n1At the hearing, the Court expressed its willingness to\nreceive comments from interested community organizations\nwithin ten days.  Two such comments were received and have\nbeen reviewed by the Court.\n\nargument of the parties and the further comments of the\nMonitor, the Court will, with some adjustments, adopt the\nRecommended Order of the Monitor.\nThe parties are in full agreement with nearly every\naspect of the Recommended Order.  What is in contention,\nthough, is the final section.  This section sets forth a\nthree-year timetable for the Court's disengagement.  At the\nconclusion of this period, the Monitor is to report to the\nCourt and a hearing will be held as to whether \"the\ndefendants have made significant good faith efforts and\nprogress. . . .\"  If this is found,\nthe Court will make a finding that the defendants\nare in compliance with the Consent Decree and will\n/end its jurisdiction over the case and the mental\n/ health system in Western Massachusetts and the\nDecree will be terminated and notwithstanding said\ntermination of the Consent Decree, the maintenance\nof effort provisions in Section VII herein shall\nremain in effect.\nRecommended Order, Paragraph 53.\nDefendants are in full agreement with this language.\nPlaintiffs agree that it is appropriate to conclude this case\nand to permit the gradual withdrawal of active supervision of\nthe Court.  Nevertheless, plaintiffs fear the Monitor's\nproposed language could lead in the future to a wholesale\nreturn to pre-Decree conditions.  In the words of their\ncounsel, plaintiffs fear that \"a fundamental undermining of\nthe whole purpose of the case\" could occur and plaintiffs\nwould be powerless to return to Court to stop it.

The paragraph at issue now reads:\nNotwithstanding the Court's Disengagement Orders and\nsubject to available resources and appropriations.  the\ncommunity mental health system of services established\nunder the Decree shall be maintained at appropriation\nlevels and annualized appropriations. . . .\nRecommended Order, Paragraph 39 (emphasis added).  The Court\nagrees with the position of plaintiffs' counsel that the\ninclusion of \"available resources\" gives the appearance of\naccording too much authority to the Department for the\nallocation of appropriated revenue among the areas of the\nCommonwealth.

The Court will,\ntherefore, eliminate the words \"available resources,\" to\nclarify this point.\nIn light of one of the public comments received, see\nsupra n. 1, the Court wishes to clarify one further aspect of\nthe disengagement section.

DUKAKIS, ET AL.,  )\nDefendants  )\nORDER OF DISENGAGEMENT\nMarch 12, 1987\nFREEDMAN, C.J.\nI.PRELIMINARY  STATEMENT\nA. INTRODUCTION\n1.  On December 6, 1978, the parties entered into an\nagreement with each other for the purpose of establishing a\ncomprehensive system of appropriate, less restrictive treat-\nment, training, and support services for each member of the\nplaintiff class, which agreement, upon the approval of the\nCourt, was entered as the Final Consent Decree (\"Decree\") in\nthis action on December 7, 1978 and which Decree has been\namended from time to time.\n2.  The parties have diligently pursued the goals of the\nDecree and, with the assistance of the Court and its Monitor,\nmuch has been accomplished and the purposes of the Decree are\nnearing completion.\nB.  ACCOMPLISHMENTS\n3.  The Decree provided for the establishment of a com-\nprehensive community-based mental health system.  Community-\n\nbased services were to be designed and developed to enable\nBrewster class members \"to live in the least restrictive,\nmost normal residential alternative and to receive appro-\npriate treatment, training, and support suited to their\nindividual needs.\"  Decree, Paragraph 8.b.  The parties are\nin agreement that there have been substantial accomplishments\nregarding this objective.  Specifically the parties note the\nfollowing achievements:\n(1) Residential Services\n4.  Approximately 500 beds have been developed during the\nterm of the Decree for mentally ill and mentally retarded\nBrewster class clients.\n5.  These community residential beds are provided to\nBrewster clients through a wide range of program types,\nmaximizing the likelihood of finding a placement for each\nindividual that is least restrictive and most appropriate in\nlight of that individual's needs.\n6.  The range of community residential programs now\navailable includes programs offering services within each of\nthe program types defined in Attachment B of the Decree,\nspecifically including:  specialized home care programs,\nsupervised apartment programs or group homes, transitional\napartment programs or group homes with physical care com-\nponents, apartment programs or group homes with behavioral\nemphasis, and apartment programs or group homes with physical\ncare components and behavioral emphasis.\n7.  Innovations in community residential programming have\n- 2 -\n\noccurred throughout the course of defendantsโข implementation\nof the Decree, allowing many individual class members to be\nappropriately served in programs specially designed to meet\ntheir unique needs.\n8.  Mentally retarded class members, more than eighty of\nwhom were at Northampton State Hospital in 1978, have bene-\nfitted from successful placements in community residential\nprograms.  These residential placements and related day or\nnonresidential programs have effectively minimized acute\nhospitalization and have almost completely substituted for\nlong-term hospitalization at Northampton State Hospital of\nmentally retarded class members.\n9.  Elderly class members, about one hundred of whom were\nat Northampton State Hospital in 1978, have similarly\nbenefitted from successful placements in community residen-\ntial programs.  As with the mentally retarded class members,\nthese residential programs have effectively minimized acute\nhospitalization and have almost completely substituted for\nlong-term hospitalization at Northampton State Hospital.\n10.  The establishment of short-term respite beds in\nassociation with crisis intervention programs in each com-\nmunity mental health service area has enabled thousands of\nBrewster class members to receive effective care and treat-\nment services in the community without the need for insti-\ntutionalization in the more restrictive environment of\nNorthampton State Hospital.\n- 3 -\n\n(2) Nonresidential Services\n11.  Nonresidential community-based treatment and support\nprograms are now available to serve the mentally ill and\nmentally retarded Brevster class clients who have been placed\nin community residential programs as well as to serve many\nother Brewster class members, who with this support, are\ncapable of living independently.  Prior to the Decree most of\nthese services either were not available or were provided in\nassociation with long-term hospitalization at Northampton\nState Hospital.\n12.  The nonresidential programs are provided through a\nwide range of program types, maximizing the likelihood of\neffectively assisting each individual client to acquire and\nmaintain those physical, mental and social skills that will\nenable the client to cope most effectively with the demands\nof his or her environment.\n13.  The range of nonresidential programs now available\nincludes programs offering services within each of the\nprogram types defined in Attachment C of the Decree, speci-\nfically including:  assessment teams, community service\ncoordination, psychotherapy/counseling, respite care, family\nsupport, medication unit/nursing support, crisis intervention\nunits, day treatment, day activity, vocational rehabilitation\n(including prevocational training/sheltered workshops and\ntransitional employment/job placement), and recreational,\nsocialization and support services.\n14.  New innovative community nonresidential programs\n- 4 -\n\nhave been developed during the course of defendants1 implemen-\ntation of the Decree, with particular emphasis on vocational\nand work support programming, intensive case management ser-\nvices, specialized support programs for adolescents, citizen\nadvocacy and family support programs and mobile crisis\nintervention services.\n(2) Client Rights, Service Planning, Human Resources and\nLicensing\n15.  Comprehensive regulations for the community-based\nmental health service system regarding client rights, indi-\nvidual service plans, program standards and licensing require-\nments have been promulgated by the Department of Mental Health\n(\"the  Department\").  No comparable regulations existed prior\nto the signing of the Decree.\n16.  Activities beneficial to Brewster class clients that\nhave occurred pursuant to the community mental health regu-\nlations have included:  development and implementation of\ncomprehensive individual service plans for hundreds of\nclients; independent reviews of some disputed service plans\npursuant to a formal appeals system wherein fundamental\ndifferences of opinion regarding appropriate services may be\nfairly and definitively resolved; independent surveys and\nlicensing of community residential and nonresidential programs\nto ensure that established program standards are met; and\nenforcement of clear regulatory standards governing such basic\nclient rights issues as the use of restraint, consent to\ntreatment, and the management of client records,\n- .5 -\n\nclient possessions and client funds.\n17.  Training to maximize staff understanding of and\ncapacity to respond to client needs is now occurring on a\ncontinuous cycle for all staff of community residential and\nnonresidential programs.\nII.  DEFENDANTS1 UNDERTAKINGS\n18.  NOW THEREFORE, the Court hereby ORDERS defendants as\npart of this Order of Disengagement to undertake to accom-\nplish the following:\nA.  MANAGEMENT AND QUALITY ASSURANCE\n19.  A Field Operations Manager will be established for\nmental health services in District I, with direct supervisory\nauthority over the Area Directors.  The Field Operations\nManager will be fully responsible for the overall operation,\ndevelopment and quality of all community-based mental health\nservices in the District.  A position has been authorized and\nfunded for this purpose in the Fiscal Year (\"FY\") 1987\nbudget.  Sufficient staff will be assigned to support the\nField Operations Manager in carrying out these responsibili-\nties.\n20.  At the direction of an appropriate central office\nmanager, the Field Operations Manager will have authority\nover the expenditure of community mental health resources\nallocated to the District.  The Field Operations Manager will\nperiodically review expenditures within the community program\naccounts throughout the fiscal year.  The Field Operations\nManager will review and approve all purchase of service\n- 6 -\n\nchanges and any other significant reallocation of resources\nwithin an area's community mental health system.\n21.  The Field Operations Manager will monitor utili-\nzation of community mental health resources.  As is the\ncurrent practice the Field Operations Manager will approve\nlong-term vacancies from residential programs.  The Field\nOperations Manager will also review and approve all justi-\nfications relating to delays in program development or under-\nutilization.\n22.  The Field Operations Manager will have authority\nover issues that arise between areas.  Specifically, the\nField Operations Manager will have responsibility for\nsettling all disputes between areas within the District\nregarding area of meaningful tie designations.  The Field\nOperations Manager will have the authority to order the\ntreatment of a client from one area in another area's program\nwhen necessary.\n23.  The Field Operations Manager will serve as the\nCommissioner's designee for many regulatory and contractual\nfunctions.  The Field Operations Manager will ordinarily be\nthe hearing officer for all contract award appeals.  The\nDistrict Manager's role in departmental investigations, 104\nC.M.R. 24.06, will be taken over by the Field Operations\nManager when the complaint involves community mental health\nservices.  The Field Operations Manager will assume the res-\nponsibilities given the Regional Services Administrator in\nmental health Individual Service Plan appeals, see 104 c.M.R.\n- 7 -\n\n16.11(4).\n24.  The Field Operations Manager will continue the\nDistrict Manager's role in the licensing process.  Specifi-\ncally, the Field Operations Manager will review and sign all\ndeficiency statements/plans of compliance, review and sign\nall licensing waiver petitions and review and monitor all\ndeficiency correction orders.\n25.  The Field Operations Manager will regularly review\nutilization by the areas of institutional mental health\nresources.  In conjunction with the Chief Operating Officer\nof Northampton State Hospital, staff from the area office and\nsaid state hospital, the Field Operations Manager will regu-\nlarly review the current patients at this state hospital.\nThis review will center on the circumstances of the client's\nadmission, the client's clinical condition, the plan for\ndischarge, barriers to discharge and any other relevant\nissues regarding the client or utilization of the state\nhospital and community systems.\n26.  The Field Operations Manager will continue to have\noversight of the training of staff in community mental health\nprograms.  The Field Operations Manager in conjunction with\nthe area personnel will develop a system to insure that staff\nin community programs are adequately trained.\n27.  The Field Operations Manager will develop and\nimplement systems for utilization review within the community\nmental health system.  Part of this community utilization\nreview will result from the amendment and strengthening of\n- 8 -\n\nthe Individual Service Plan process which is discussed\ninfra.  The Field Operations Manager will preside over the\nstandardization of the Individual Service Plan process in\nDistrict I.  The Field Operations Manager will also develop\nother utilization review procedures in the community mental\nhealth system.  While implementation of this system will\nprimarily rest with the areas, the Field Operations Manager\nwill have an independent capacity in this process to conduct\nquality assurance client audits or as an ex officio member of\ntreatment or assessment teams.  Each area will be required to\nsubmit regular reports to the Field Operations Manager on its\nutilization review process.\n28.  The Field Operations Manager will periodically\nreview the performance of the Area Directors in regards to\ntheir management of the community mental health system.\n29.  The Field Operations Manager shall be responsible\nfor working with the Chief Operating Officer of Northampton\nState Hospital to insure the integration of the hospitalโขs\noperations with the community mental health system and shall\nhave access to the central office manager responsible for\nhospitals to resolve any differences.\n30.  For a period of three years from the effective date\nof this Order of Disengagement, the defendants shall comply\nwith present Court orders regarding human resource training.\nB.  INDIVIDUAL SERVICE PLANS\n31.  Mental Health Individual Service Plan regulations\nwere issued by the Department in 1980 pursuant to Decree\n- 9 -\n\nrequirements.  The regulations are limited in scope to\nDistrict I in Western Massachusetts.  They are presently\ncodified at 104 C.M.R. 16.00.\n32.  The Department will develop a plan thoroughly to\nassess, revitalize and standardize the District I mental\nhealth Individual Service Plan system.  This plan shall be\ncompleted within three months from the Court's approval of\nthis recommendation.  The goals of this plan will be (1) to\nconduct training and to establish enforcement mechanisms\nsufficient to ensure full and timely implementation as\nmandated by the Individual Service Plan regulations, and (2)\nto identify and then make whatever revisions of the regula-\ntions may be necessary to ensure that they will promote their\npurposes to the maximum extent possible.  The Department\nplans to initiate the Individual Service Plan regulatory\nrevision and implementation activities concurrently during FY\nโข87.\n33.  The defendants shall complete all required Indivi-\ndual Service Plans for those persons who are hospitalized at\nNorthampton State Hospital within six months of the date of\nthis Order of Disengagement.  Individual Service Plans shall\nbe implemented thereafter within a reasonable time subject to\navailable resources.\nC.  RESIDENTIAL PLACEMENTS\n34.  With respect to the Governor's 1986 mental health\ninitiative which presently provides that there be 230 new\nresidential placements for District I, the defendants shall,\n- 10 -\n\nfor FY '88, seek funding for twenty-five high-intensity\nresidential placements for class members.  Preferences for\nthese twenty-five placements will be given to those class\nmembers who are hospitalized at Northampton State Hospital on\nthe date of this Order and shall apply on a seniority basis\nto those residents with the longest length of hospitali-\nzation.\n35.  With respect to other placements that may be\ndeveloped pursuant to the Governor's initiative, it is\nunderstood that preference shall be given for one-half of\nthese additional placements to persons now or hereafter\nhospitalized at Northampton State Hospital.  Defendants shall\nplan for these additional placements but, do not commit\nthemselves for their funding.  These placements shall be\nallocated on the basis of seniority favoring those residents\nwith the longest length of hospitalization.  With respect to\nthe presently planned eighty additional placements of the\nmoderate or high-intensity type that may be developed,\npreference will be given for one-half of these placements to\npersons presently or hereafter hospitalized at Northampton\nState Hospital.  These placements are also to be allocated on\nthe basis of seniority favoring those residents with the\nlongest length of hopsitalization.\nD.  INPATIENT FACILITIES\n36.  The defendants will develop a plan for the providing\nof inpatient services for class members. The plan will\nidentify the location(s) and projected capacity of inpatient\n- 11 -\n\nservices to be provided by the Department in District I.  The\nplan will utilize regional, emergency and/or backup facili-\nties and area inpatient facilities.  This plan shall be\ncompleted within eight months of the date of this Order of\nDisengagement and submitted to the Monitor and plaintiffs'\ncounsel.\n37.  It is recognized that the capacity of such regional\n\\  and area inpatient facilities may be increased or decreased\nin the future, depending upon the needs of persons in\n^ District I.  The Department shall nonetheless prepare and\nimplement a plan providing for a capacity of no more than 120\npersons in three to five area facilities.  Defendants have\nexercised reasonable good faith efforts during the last two\nyears to prevent inappropriate hospitalization and shall\ncontinue to make such efforts in order to attempt to achieve\nthe goal of a census of 120.  The defendants agree the\nMemorial Complex Building will be closed at the earliest\npossible date permitted by the development of the three-to-\nfive area inpatient facilities.  Thereafter, the Haskell\nBuilding shall be utilized and maintained as an emergency or\nbackup inpatient facility.\n38.  The defendants may eventually close the Haskell\nBuilding if the defendants determine that it is no longer\nnecessary to serve class members or if the defendants decide\nanother facility is more suitable as an emergency or backup\ninpatient facility.\n39.  These inpatient facilities should be operated\n- 12 -\n\nconsistent with existing policies and state law to screen out\ninappropriate admissions of the mentally retarded, those with\norganic brain syndrome, alcoholics and adolescents.\nIII.  MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT\n40.  Notwithstanding the Court's Disengagement Order and\nsubject to avairiiible appropriations, and community mental\nhealth system of services established under the Decree shall\nbe maintained at present appropriation levels and annualized\n'V.  โข  '  -  'โข\"-\"\nappropriations for the twenty-five new residential placements\nreferred to in Section II, supra. pursuant to the following\nprinciples:\n(a) Residents and clients are entitled to live in the\nleast restrictive, most normal residential alternative and to\nreceive appropriate treatment, training, and support suited\nto their individual needs.\n(b) The determination of client service needs will occur\nthrough an individualized screening, evaluation, and service\nplanning process, including annual reviews of Individual\nService Plans.\n(c) The determination of appropriate residential and\nnonresidential placements for each resident and client will\nbe made so as to guarantee that all persons are placed in the\nleast restrictive alternative which will provide them with\nappropriate treatment, training and support.\n(d) Since the residential models are designed to be the\nmost normal and least restrictive environments appropriate\nfor the residents and clients, smaller apartment units are\n- 13 -\n\npreferred to larger group homes, although either may be\nappropriate depending on the particular circumstances.\n(e) Community residential and nonresidential services\nwill be offered, to the maximum extent feasible, on a volun-\ntary basis and with due regard for the client's dignity and\npersonal autonomy.\n(f) Community residential alternatives and nonresidential\nprograms will be integrated in the community and operated in\nthe most normal manner appropriate to the needs of their\nclients.\n(g) If new information and a clear change in circum-\nstances indicate a more appropriate way to maintain existing\nservices than required by these principles, the defendants\nmay modify a program or programs.  For purposes of this\nsubparagraph  (g) only, notice of any such change which is\nproposed within a period of three years from the effective\ndate of this Order of Disengagement, and an opportunity to\nobject, shall be given to plaintiffs' counsel.\nIV.  COURT DISENGAGEMENT\n41.  In consideration of the foregoing, the Court hereby\nrelinquishes active supervision over the Consent Decree but\nretains supervision over this case subject to the following\nqualifications:\n(a) For a period of one year, the defendants will file\nbimonthly written reports with the Monitor and also oral\nreports at least monthly describing their efforts and pro-\ngress in planning and implementation of Section II.  The\n- 14 -\n\nMonitor shall retain the authority specified in the Decree to\ninvestigate and propose action by the defendants sua sponte\nor on request by a party.  Defendants will provide copies of\ntheir written reports to plaintiff's counsel.\n(b) At the end of one year, the defendants shall file a\none-year progress report with the Monitor describing the\nstatus of the several initiatives and plans identified\nherein.  The Monitor shall afford the plaintiffs and repre-\nsentatives of interested community organizations an oppor-\ntunity to comment upon the defendants' report, and shall\nthereafter file the report with his own comments thereon with\nthe Court.  The plaintiffs and interested community repre-\nsentatives may file comments with the Court, to which the\ndefendants may respond.\n(c) If it shall appear to the Court, based upon the\ndefendants' report, the Monitor's comments, and the comments\nof plaintiffs and representatives of interested community\norganizations, if any, that the^defendants have exercised\n.good faith efforts iand have Imade reasonable progress1* in\ndeveloping and implementing the initiatives and plans iden-\ntified above, the Court shall find reasonable progress is\nbeing achieved and therefore the terms of the Order of\nDisengagement will continue to be recognized by the Court and\nthe parties will continue to be bound thereby for an addi-\ntional two-year period.\n42.  (a) The defendants shall for an additional two-year\nperiod file quarterly written reports with the Monitor and\n- 15 -\n\nsuch other oral reports as the Monitor may require outlining\ntheir continued efforts and progress with the planning and\nimplementation of Section II herein.\n(b) The Monitor shall retain authority to investigate and\npropose action sua sponte or on request of a party.  Defen-\ndants will provide copies of their written reports to plain-\ntiffs' counsel.\n43.  At the end of the two years of said quarterly\nreports, the Monitor shall report to the Court as to whether\nthe defendants during said additional two-year period have\nmade reasonable good faith efforts to bring about significant\nprogress toward implementation of the initiatives in Section\nII.  Plaintiffs, defendants and representatives of interested\ncommunity organizations may submit their own comments to the\nCourt with regard to the degree of effort and progress\nachieved in this two-year period.  The Court shall hold a\nhearing and if it determines that the defendants have made\nsignificant(good faith efforts and progress, the Court will\nmake a finding that the defendants are in compliance with the\nConsent Decree and will end its jurisdiction over the case\nand the mental health system in Western Massachusetts.  The\nDecree will then be terminated and notwithstanding said\ntermination of the Decree, the maintenance of effort pro-\nvisions in Section III herein shall remain in effect.  The\nCourt notes that said maintenance of effort provisions, in\naddition to the stated principles therein, are designed to\nprevent a virtual undermining of the Decree's accomplishments\n- 16 -\n\nor a dismantling of the mental health system created in\nWestern Massachusetts by the Decree.\nIt is So Ordered.\nChief United States District Judge\n- 17 -",

The decree bound the responsible Massachusetts officials to establish a system for the care and\n[1]\ntreatment of mentally disabled persons in community residential facilities and nonresidential programs.\nThe litigation commenced in 1976; the decree was entered in 1978; and the district court made its first fee award\n[2]\nin 1982, covering work performed from 1976 through 1981, in the amount of $386,204.  The decision, resulting\nin a two-thirds reduction of the amount claimed, included an extensive analysis in which the court discussed and\ndistinguished four kinds of work done by plaintiffs' counsel in implementing and monitoring the decree. The court\nestablished different rates for court work, decree implementation and monitoring, general work, and travel. Id. at\n1076. Although the decree called for a court-appointed Monitor, the decree also bestowed various responsibilities\non the parties. Id. at 1072.\nThe present fee application covered the period from January 1, 1982 through June 30, 1984, and included\n2537.93 hours of services performed by two lawyers and a paralegal. The 191-page application included some\n3500 entries (at roughly eighteen items a page) accounting for time in tenths of an hour, and coded to identify six\n[3]\ndifferent kinds of work.  The entry described the kind of activity (e.g., \"spoke w/\", \"met w/\", \"drafted letter\",\n\"reviewed letter\", \"deposition\", \"hearing\", etc.), as well as the other person or group involved, and, usually, the\nsubject matter (e.g., \"on budget\", \"on crisis intervention program\", \"on deposition\"). The amount claimed was\n$239,772.10.\nThe district court awarded $132,639.55, a reduction of forty-four percent. The court decided three issues in favor\nof the plaintiffs: (1) it rejected defendants' contention that, to recover post-judgment fees, plaintiffs must show that\ntheir efforts produced a better result than otherwise would have occurred, holding that \"reasonable monitoring\",\nunder Garrity v. Sununu, 752 F.2d 727, 738 (1st Cir.1984) imposes a lesser burden; (2) it rejected defendants'\n\nchallenge to time spent on three motions to hold defendants in contempt, all settled before hearing, finding that\n18 the efforts helped produce favorable results; and (3) it rejected defendants' claim that the fee *18 award should\nbe reduced to the extent that hours included in the fee application were also compensated by the Association of\nService Providers for Persons with Handicaps (\"Association\"), accepting counsel's representation that all time\nclaimed was for service benefiting the plaintiff class.\nThe court decided five issues in whole or in part against the plaintiffs: (1) it disallowed time spent in the\nunsuccessful defense on appeal of a legal services program ordered by the district court; (2) it disallowed time\nspent in a candidate search for the position of court Monitor; (3) it cut in half time claimed in connection with a\nSupplemental Agreement that never came to fruition; (4) it reduced, among other items, the claimed hourly rates\nfrom $125 and $115 for court activities to $95, from $115 and $105 for decree implementation to $85, and from\n$105 and $95 for general work to $75; and (5) it refused to grant plaintiffs' request for a fifteen percent upward\nadjustment of the lodestar, while also denying defendants' request for a downward adjustment.\nDefendants appeal the court's refusal to adopt a rigorous \"but for plaintiffs' efforts\" standard for post-judgment\nmonitoring fees and its refusal to reduce the award to reflect payments received from the Association. Plaintiffs\ncross appeal from the court's elimination of time spent in helping select a Monitor, from its reduction of time spent\non the Supplemental Agreement, and from its reduction of hourly rates.\nI. Post-Judgment Monitoring\nDefendants' position is that in a post-judgment context where a defendant-funded court monitor is created by the\ndecree, the only way to avoid creating a state-funded, open-ended \"sinecure for counsel\" is \"to compensate\ncounsel only where a substantial issue arises as to the defendants' obligations under the decree, and the work of\nplaintiffs' counsel yields a resolution more favorable to the class than the defendants were prepared to concede.\"\nThey argue that such an extra burden is required to sift out progress or benefits flowing from the decree itself.\nThey seek to distinguish Garrity v. Sununu, supra, on the ground that the instant case has in place a court\nMonitor, paid some $70,000 during the period at issue, whose presence presumably should have made\nunnecessary all time spent in routine monitoring. They argue alternatively that Garrity may need to be limited in\nlight of Webb v. Board of Education of Dyer County, 471 U.S. 234, 105 S.Ct. 1923, 85 L.Ed.2d 233 (1985), which\nheld that there should be no 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988 fee award for work in optional administrative proceedings unless it\nis \"of a type ordinarily necessary\" to advance the litigation. Id.105 S.Ct. at 1929.\nWe appreciate the fact that devising workable ways, fair to performer and payor, to compensate legal services\nduring the formative period (following issuance of a complex system-creating decree and before satisfactory\nimplementation becomes largely routine) is a difficult and sensitive task. The services are of lower profile and\noften of a more routinized nature than services preceding judgments. Missing the refining fire of the basic\nlitigation, plaintiffs' attorney may slip into a mode of spending too much time on too many matters, with the result\nthat the decree institutionalizes the attorney, as well as the system.\nDefendants' proferred standard, however, leaves us traumatized at the prospect of a multitude of trials 00 not\n97\nnecessarily mini-trials 00 on whether issue A, for which X hours are claimed, was really a \"substantial\" issue\n97\nregarding a defendant's obligations, and, if so, did plaintiffs' work produce a more favorable resolution than\ndefendants \"were prepared to concede\". Must the result be measurably more favorable? How may one prove\nwhat defendants were prepared to concede, but did not? Such a standard implies the availability of appellate\nreview of each issue, an addition to our domain that we would welcome with something less than unbridled\nenthusiasm. Moreover, as Amicus points out, defendants' proposed standard would stimulate posturing and\nundercut the amicable cooperation that a consent decree is designed to foster; plaintiffs would opt for a\ncombative, litigious route in preference to quiet negotiation. Whether we view the likely results in terms of delay,\ncost to the parties, inflated counsel fees, acrimony, or the additional burden on both the district court and the\ncourt of appeals, we see little to recommend the suggested innovation.\nPerhaps the most salient approach is to see if the normal method of determining fees for monitoring has broken\ndown. We cannot say that it has in this case, because, while it was begun, it was never completed. Plaintiffs\n19 supplied their compendious fee *19 application, which, while often not facially self-explanatory, contained the\n\nnecessary keys to testing its reasonableness. Defendants generally knew the dates, subject matter, and people\ninvolved. They, at some expense to be sure, could have mounted challenges to specific claims 00 if not on a\n97\ncomprehensive basis, at least on a random one. Had this happened, the district court would have had the benefit\nof the adversary process and could have developed a sense of the extent to which the claim for services was\nreasonable. We recognize that a specific challenge to every item in a 3500-item catalogue of time charges would\nbe impracticable, but it is not too much to expect the Commonwealth, relying on its deep involvement in the\nlitigation, to target significant and vulnerable areas for testing. We would have confidence that, given reasonable\nassistance by counsel, a court could arrive at a fair decision without a dismaying investment of time, particularly\nduring the later, \"tapering off\" stages of implementing a decree.\nThis traditional approach not having been attempted, we are left with the general attack on the standard, together\nwith the \"Association issue\", infra. Without specific indicia of unreliability, we are left with more general indicators,\nwhich do not support the Commonwealth. We note first the consistency of the district court's fee decision-making\nin this case with the approach taken in its earlier decision on the 1976-1981 applications. Second, we are mindful\nof the extensive forty-four percent reduction made in this case. Third, we do not think it excessive for attorney\nSchwartz to have spent about one-fourth of his time for two and one half years on this case (i.e., 1323 hours out\nof 5000), attorney Fleischner one eighth (i.e., 602 hours out of 5000), and paralegal Costanzo one eighth (i.e.,\n613 hours out of 5000). Fourth, we observe that the Commonwealth, when it perceives that matters have been\nsufficiently clarified and stabilized, may and indeed should petition the court to relieve it of the burden of paying\nfor private party monitoring. Fifth, we note that plaintiffs will have waited from two to four years for their attorney's\nfees.\nFinally, we are impressed by the fact that defendants have not been able to muster any authority for their\n[4]\nproposition. Against the full array of authority for allowing fees for reasonable post-judgment monitoring,  the\ndefendants can say only that these decisions are \"a series of ad hoc assessments of factual circumstances quite\nunlike those presented here.\" As for their invocation of Webb v. Board of Education of Dyer County, 471 U.S. 234,\n105 S.Ct. 1923, 85 L.Ed.2d 233 (1985), as Amicus points out, its requirement that services (in an optional\nadministrative proceeding) be \"useful\" and \"ordinarily necessary\" is fully consonant with our insistence in Garrity\nthat services be \"necessary for reasonable monitoring of a consent decree\". 752 F.2d at 738. And finally,\ndefendants' effort to justify departure from the Garrity standard where a court-appointed monitor is in place\n[5]\nseems to us to have been adequately answered by the district court in its first fee opinion.\nWe therefore hold that the district court properly rejected defendants' plea to accept a different standard of proof\nfor post-judgment monitoring.\nII. The Association Issue\nPlaintiffs' fee application was filed on August 16, 1984. Oral argument was had on October 19, 1984. Shortly\nthereafter, a routine audit revealed that the Association, a group of state funded contractors providing services to\n20 plaintiffs under the consent *20 decree, had entered into a retainer agreement with a charitable corporation\nstaffed by plaintiffs' counsel, the Center for Public Representation (\"Center\"). Under this agreement, the Center\nwas obligated to provide fourteen hours of service a week to the Association, in return for which the Center\nreceived from each Association member one-third of one percent of its contract funding received from the\nDepartment of Mental Health. Between 1982 and 1984, the Association paid the Center $87,468.\nDefendants moved to reopen the evidence and sought additional discovery on December 3, 1984 on the issues\nwhether all of the time claimed was in reality for work done for plaintiffs and whether plaintiffs had already been\ncompensated by the Association. Plaintiffs immediately moved to supplement their application and also opposed\nthe motion to reopen, stating that the information as to compensation from the Association was irrelevant and\nthat, in any event, they had now provided full information. Defendants countered with a proposal that the parties\ntry to stipulate facts concerning the Center's representation of the Association, failing which they would seek\ndiscovery.\n\nOn December 13, 1984, the court allowed the defendants' motion to reopen for purposes of receiving written\nbriefs 00 within thirty days from defendants and sixty days from plaintiffs. It further stated that evidence on alleged\n97\nconflicts of interest concerning payments of attorney's fees \"shall be brought forward to the Court Monitor and he\nshall conduct hearings on same and make recommendations to the Court.\" On December 21, noting that the\ncourt had allowed the motion to reopen, defendants sought leave to file interrogatories requesting a list of all\npersons named in the fee application who were employees of a provider agency, and information concerning the\nmake-up of the \"Litigation Committee\" mentioned in the retainer agreement, including whether it was the\n\"Litigation Committee\" referred to in various entries in the fee application. They also sought to telescope the time\nfor responses so that they could incorporate them in their written brief. Plaintiffs opposed these requests, stating\nthat the court had limited any reopening to written briefs. On January 4, 1985, the court denied leave to propound\ninterrogatories, writing: \"The Court did not intend that discovery should be reopened.\" We have traced this bit of\nprocedural history in detail because it plays a large role in shaping our decision.\nDefendants' position is that case authorities such as our Palmigiano v. Garrahy, 616 F.2d 598 (1st Cir.1980),\nholding that the presence of financial support for a public interest legal services organization is irrelevant to the\ncalculation of a reasonable fee under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988, do not apply to the instant case where the Association's\nretainer payments to the Center were for legal services rendered in the Association's behalf and where the\nAssociation's Litigation Committee has the power to determine the scope and type of work and legal positions to\nbe taken by the Center. Defendants further point to specific portions of the record, which indicate to them that\ncertain services were performed solely or dominantly for the Association (for example, meetings with the\nLitigation Committee and time recorded for conferring with employees of various providers). They also claim that\ntheir inability to probe further leaves an \"irresolvable ambiguity\" as to the object of counsels' work, which justifies\na fee reduction of between fifteen and twenty-five percent (i.e., between $20,000 and $33,000).\nPlaintiffs, on the other hand, claim that the principles of cases like Palmigiano govern, that the existence of\nadditional sources of funding is irrelevant to the disposition of their fee application, that the overarching purpose\nof the Association, necessarily controlling its Litigation Committee, is the welfare of the plaintiff class, and that\nplaintiffs' attorneys have often taken positions contrary to the interests of individual providers and have always\naccorded the plaintiff class their \"exclusive and unconditional loyalty\". Most pertinently, they assert that their fee\napplication includes no time spent for the Association on unrelated matters but only hours spent for the\nAssociation (50% of their total work for the Association) where the interests of the plaintiff class and the\nAssociation were identical.\nThe district court, noting that the key question was whether the time claimed in the fee application was expended\nfor the benefit of the plaintiff class, proceeded to rely \"on the demonstrated integrity of plaintiffs' counsel ... who\n21 have shown themselves to be extremely conscientious and honest attorneys\". The court stated *21 that \"[w]hen\nthey represent to the Court that 50% of their Association hours were also for the benefit of the plaintiff class, quite\nfrankly, the Court believes them. Defendants' position that plaintiff's hours must be reduced for this reason is,\ntherefore, rejected.\"\nSuch a credibility judgment and exercise of discretion would normally be unexceptionable, particularly in\nattorney's fee matters. But, as we earlier have signalled, the procedural history of this issue places the ruling in a\ndifferent light. We have criticized defendants for not making discrete challenges to specific kinds of services\nperformed or the time spent in performing them. But the issue of dual compensation and possibly divided loyalty\ndid not arise until after the October 1984 hearing. Although plaintiffs' attorneys cannot be criticized for any\nconcealment of the retainer arrangement, it clearly was not known by these defendants or their counsel.\nThe district court itself recognized the importance of the issue, but, when the issue arose, gave signals which\nwere variously interpreted. Plaintiffs felt that only written briefs could address the issue; defendants felt that they\nwere permitted to gather some facts. The court specifically allowed evidence on possible conflicts of interest to\nbe submitted to the Court Monitor for his recommendations. Four months later, the Monitor did recommend,\nfollowing the joint agreement of the parties, that the retainer arrangement be terminated. This of course avoids\nrecurrence of any problem but did not dissipate any cloud hovering over the instant fee application.\n\nWe conclude that the district court should have allowed at least a limited discovery on this newly realized issue to\ntest whether or not some of the time claimed was solely or principally in pursuit of Association purposes that were\nnot coterminous with those of the plaintiff class. While our own impression of the time sheets is that plaintiffs'\nattorneys pursued a generally scrupulous approach to conscientious reporting, a cursory scrutiny reveals some\ntwenty-five hours recorded as being spent in meetings with the Litigation Committee. Plaintiffs' attorney Schwartz,\nin an affidavit, stated: \"As a practical matter, these communications [at meetings] were primarily for the purpose\nof my providing information to the Committee, and through them to the members, concerning the status of\nimplementation of this Decree.\"\nThis indicates to us that the time spent in these meetings might well not have been spent for the principal benefit\nof the plaintiff class. Perhaps in the long run the class benefited, but, in view of the fact that defendants were\nprecluded from any discovery or testing, the entries are sufficiently suspect to warrant exclusion. Rather than\nremand these already prolonged proceedings for reconsideration by the district court, we think it both fair and\nappropriate to deduct from the award a sum roughly equal to twice the amount of the entries that appear suspect\nto us 00 $5,000.\n97\nIII. The Cross-Appeal\nPlaintiffs, regretfully, have engaged in three frivolous claims in their cross-appeal. Their fee application claimed\nhourly rates of $125 and $115 for court activities for their two attorneys and $115, $105, and $40 for decree\nimplementation for their two attorneys and paralegal. The court, having allowed $80 an hour for court activities\nand $70 for decree implementation in 1982, increased the rates to $95 for court activities and $85 for\nimplementation. Plaintiffs rely on their evidence of prevailing market rates in Springfield to urge that, as a matter\nof law, their evidence should carry the day. The legal work involved in this case was most intimately known by the\ndistrict court; that the district court chose to increase fees by nineteen percent and no more was clearly within its\ndiscretion, especially in this advanced stage of implementation of the decree.\nPlaintiffs' other two claims are that the court abused its discretion in excluding 64.7 hours of time spent (and\nconsequently $12,629) in the search for a new court monitor and in excluding one-half of the 366 hours for what\nproved to be an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate a supplemental agreement. As to the former, the court\nacknowledged that the parties' attorneys were to consult and advise, but noted that the choosing was the court's\nresponsibility. As to the latter, the court gently suggested that plaintiffs had \"perhaps put in too much effort\" on a\nsupplemental agreement. Both judgment calls were clearly within the discretion of the court.\n22 Accordingly, the judgment below is reduced from $132,639.55 to $127,639.55*22and, as reduced, is affirmed.\nThe plaintiffs not having prevailed on part of the defendants' appeal and having lost on their cross-appeal, it is the\njudgment of the court that the parties bear their own costs and that no counsel fees be awarded for the appeals.\n[*] Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation.\n[1] We have had two prior occasions to address this litigation: Brewster v.

Although we avoid a detailed description of the circumstances giving rise to the order,\nthe provisions of the order, and their modification by a second order, a brief review is necessary to set the stage\nfor our discussion of this appeal.\nThe consent decree was the result of the negotiated settlement of a suit filed as a class action in the district court\nby nine residents of the Northampton State Hospital who claimed that the Commonwealth's programs to treat\nmentally disabled persons at the hospital violated their constitutional and statutory rights to less restrictive\ntreatment through nonhospitalization programs. In the consent decree the Commonwealth 00 represented by the\n97\nGovernor, the Attorney General and his assistants, the Secretary of Administration and Finance, the Secretary of\nHuman Services and the Commissioner of the Department of Mental Health 00 agreed to undertake specific\n97\nprograms that would provide a comprehensive system of community mental health and retardation services by\noffering less restrictive residential facilities and nonresidential treatment and support programs. Although many of\nthe programmatic provisions are stated as absolute promises to provide the specified services, the consent\ndecree also states that \"defendants will use their best efforts to insure the full and timely financing of this\nDecree\".\nIn July, 1981, two and one-half years into the life of the consent decree, the Massachusetts legislature\nappropriated approximately five million dollars less than appellants' budget request of 53 million dollars for the\nconsent decree program. The Governor subsequently filed a supplemental budget request to try to obtain the\nmoney needed to comply fully with the decree. In early August plaintiffs-appellees, awaiting action on the\nsupplemental request, filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to prevent\nappellants from curtailing the consent decree programs in light of the reduced appropriation, a process appellants\nhad already initiated. Appellees claimed that any reductions in program violated the consent decree. On\nSeptember 15, 1981, the district court issued an order directing appellants in effect to proceed with\n\nimplementation of the consent decree programs as though there were no shortfall in funding and to submit to the\nCourt Monitor for the consent decree a report of all efforts taken to obtain full funding from the legislature.\n3 Questioning whether the district court could order funding of programs contrary *3 to legislative desire, this court\nstayed the order pending appeal. On December 23 the district court modified its order and issued a new\nmemorandum to make clear that it was not ordering the legislature to appropriate money but instead was\nrequiring appellants to make their best efforts to obtain full funding. Because it found that appellants had not\nmade their best efforts to date, it ordered them to continue to conduct programs at full funding levels until best\nefforts either produced results or were proven unsuccessful, in which event appellants were ordered to return to\nthe court with a request for modification of their obligations under the terms of the consent decree. Pending our\nreview of the September 15 and December 23 orders, this court on January 12 stayed the portion of the order\nrequiring continued spending at full funding levels, and modified that section of the order which directed\nappellants to make their best efforts by increasing the specificity of appellants' obligation to make best efforts and\nto report to the court on those efforts.\nWe fully appreciate the delicate nature of this situation. By committing the Commonwealth to fulfilling certain\nresponsibilities, appellants induced appellees to drop their suit. The district court, having approved the\nagreement, must ensure its continued execution, but is faced with the political reality that the legislature has\n[1]\nrefused to fund the consent decree to the extent requested by appellants.  Although the district court has\nrecognized that the legislature is not subject to its injunctive power, it has sought to protect appellees' rights\nunder the decree by prohibiting appellants from cutting consent decree programs until they have proven that their\nbest efforts to obtain full funding are unavailing.\nProceeding to a review of the district court's orders, we first note that paragraph 6 of the consent decree provides\nthat the district court retains jurisdiction \"to enable any party to apply at any time for such further orders as may\nbe necessary or appropriate for the interpretation, implementation, enforcement, or modification of the terms of\nthis Decree\". Appellees in this instance were not seeking modification of the decree, which would have resulted in\na permanent, facial change in the decree. See, e.g., System Federation No. 91 v. Wright, 364 U.S. 642, 647, 81\nS.Ct. 368, 371, 5 L.Ed.2d 349 (1961). See generally Delaware Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air v.\nPennsylvania, No. 81-2308 (3d Cir. Mar. 1, 1982). Nor were they applying for enforcement through contempt\nproceedings as is customary when a party believes that the provisions of a consent decree have been violated. \nSee, e.g., Commodity Futures Trading Comm'n v. Premex, Inc., 655 F.2d 779, 782 (7th Cir. 1981); Interdynamics,\nInc. v. Firma Wolf, 653 F.2d 93, 97 (3d Cir. 1981); New York State Ass'n for Retarded Children v. Carey, 631 F.2d\n162, 163 (2d Cir. 1980).\nRather, appellees took an intermediate course by seeking clarification of duty and enforcement in an\nundifferentiated request for injunctive relief. Because an action for enforcement (i.e., contempt) would entail\nprocedures and standards of proof not applied in this instance, we cannot view the resulting court order as an\nenforcement order. Instead, we deem the order to have been issued under the court's power to interpret the\ndecree, a power clearly reserved to the court by the terms of the decree. On the periphery of the court's power to\ninterpret is also a limited power to issue injunctive relief which may be used to protect rights and enforce duties\nonce they have been clarified. Cf. Delaware Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air v. Pennsylvania, supra, at 8\n(after finding violation of consent decree, court issues injunction requiring specific implementing action not\n4 contained in decree). Although we find *4 that the court partially abused its power in this instance, we recognize\nthat the use of this limited injunctive power is appropriate when, as here, unusual and possibly unforeseen\ncircumstances have required interpretation of the decree, some relief or enforcement may be in order, and yet the\n[2]\nclarity of obligation necessary for enforcement through contempt has not yet been established.\nIn the present situation, the district court was correct insofar as it interpreted the consent decree to require\nappellants to make good faith efforts to secure funding before making cuts in services. The terms of the consent\ndecree clearly state that appellants' obligation is only to exert their best efforts to fully fund the consent decree\nprograms by submitting budget requests, allocating funds appropriately among programs, and by efficiently\n[3]\nmanaging the financial procedures involved in implementing the programs.  Although the programmatic\nprovisions of the consent decree are often phrased as mandatory obligations of the state, we must interpret the\nprovision requiring best efforts to fund these obligations as an overriding provision that modifies the apparently\n\nmandatory nature of these obligations. The best efforts provision follows all of the substantive, programmatic\nprovisions, and must be read as a modification of each because it relates to a common denominator essential to\n[4]\nthe implementation of each of those provisions 00 funding.  Consequently, the court was not abusing its\n97\ndiscretion when it interpreted the consent decree to require best efforts and ordered appellants to make best\nefforts to achieve full funding.\nThe court also found that appellants had not made best efforts as of the time of its ruling and imposed additional\nresponsibilities on appellants as a result in order to implement the decree. We cannot say the district court lacked\na sufficient basis to find that appellants had not made best efforts to obtain full funding as of December 23. There\nis enough evidence on the record to show that appellants might have persevered more than they did to obtain full\nfunding. Nor did the court abuse its discretion by ordering appellants to undertake certain specific efforts to obtain\nfunding and to report on their efforts to the Court Monitor. While attempting to implement the consent decree in\nthe context of the peculiar circumstances that had evolved, the court was justified in reviewing appellants' efforts\nto date, and, finding them lacking, in imposing additional, consistent burdens on appellants to ensure\nimplementation of the decree. Consequently, paragraphs 10 and 11 of the December 23 order, as modified by\nthis court's order of January 12, stand in effect.\nThe district court imposed other obligations on appellants, however, that we feel exceeded the scope of the\n5 court's power to interpret and implement the decree. Paragraphs 1 through 9 of the December 23 *5 order\ngenerally require appellants not only not to cut down any FY '82 programs (ยถ 1); but to develop, submit to\nbidding, contract, and fund all community programs originally planned for FY '82 (ยถยถ 3, 6); promptly fill all\nauthorized personnel positions and convert certain state positions into contract staff (ยถยถ 4, 7); notify all providers\nof these requirements (ยถ 2); do all this without reducing other programs (ยถยถ 5, 8); and prepare all plans and\ndocuments necessary to accomplish the foregoing (ยถ 9). Although the court can order appellants to do what they\nare required to do under the terms of the consent decree 00 to make best efforts 00 the court cannot require\n97 97\nappellants to go beyond what their good faith professional best efforts can reasonably be expected to\n[5]\naccomplish.  We therefore vacate paragraphs 1 through 9.\nWe also vacate paragraph 12 of the December 23 order which requires appellants to submit a motion for relief\nfrom the order in the event that their best efforts do not produce the funding necessary to fully implement the\nconsent decree. Because the order, as modified by this ruling, no longer imposes a mandatory duty on appellants\nto continue conducting programs at full funding levels, it is no longer necessary to provide a mechanism for relief\nfrom that duty.\nThe implementation of the consent decree in this particular situation requires the parties continually to reassess\ntheir respective rights and obligations under the decree as the circumstances, such as the availability of funding,\nevolve. The court has the power both to interpret the consent decree in light of the changing circumstances and\nto enforce it through contempt proceedings. Given the fluidity of this situation, we stress that clarity of obligations\nmust be a prerequisite to enforcement through contempt proceedings. In the future the separate objectives of\ninterpretation and enforcement should be clearly kept in mind in framing pleadings and structuring court\nproceedings.\nParagraphs 1 through 9 and paragraph 12 of the district court's order of December 23 are vacated, and\nparagraphs 10 and 11, as modified by this court's order of January 12, are affirmed.\nSo ordered.\n[1] The funding problem continues as of the writing of this opinion. The legislature has approved a three million\ndollar supplemental appropriation, but that amount is insufficient to meet the needs of the consent decree\nprograms at issue here because it must be allocated among several other areas where the state has obligations\nunder court orders. We are not aware that previously appropriated funds have been reallocated to allow full\nfunding of the Brewster consent decree programs.\n[2] We are wary of the fact that this protective injunctive power is, in ultimate effect, not too different from the\ncourt's power to enforce the consent decree, and that parties might seek enforcement through injunction, which\n\nrequires only a showing of a likelihood of success, rather than enforcement through contempt, which requires\nmore rigorous proof of a breach. Accordingly, the proper use of injunctive relief must be restricted to a power\nexercised as an incident of the court's power to interpret the decree in the face of unusual circumstances.\n[3] The provision of the consent decree states in part that: \n\"The defendants will use their best efforts to insure the full and timely financing of this Decree, including:\nsubmission of appropriate budget requests to the Massachusetts General Court; allocation of sufficient funds to\ninsure that all existing and new programs meet the minimum standards therein; full allocation of funds\nappropriated for services during the fiscal year; allotments of appropriated funds as needed....\"\n[4] This interpretation is buttressed by paragraphs 9 and 11 of the consent decree that state that if appellants\nhave any budgetary or programmatic reason to modify the community residential alternatives, nonresidential\nprograms, and administrative management services, appellees are to have the opportunity to object to those\nmodifications in advance. By inclusion of these terms, both parties would seem to have recognized that\nbudgetary considerations may at times force deviation from the programs as outlined in the consent decree.\n[5] We do not intend to foreclose the possibility that some extraordinary circumstances 00 such as where time is of\n97\nthe essence, the party seeking relief has shown a substantial likelihood of success, and the opposing party has\nacted in bad faith 00 might justify imposition of interim obligations significantly beyond the terms of the consent\n97\ndecree in order to preserve the rights of a party pending final interpretation of the decree or enforcement through\ncontempt. Such extraordinary circumstances do not exist in this instance.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

This statute provides that:\nIn any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of [42 U.S.C. ยง 1983], the court, in its discretion,\nmay allow the prevailing party ... a reasonable attorney's fees as a part of costs.\n1071 The plaintiffs' attorneys have submitted extensive material purporting to summarize *1071 their efforts for the\n[1]\nyears 1976 to 1981.  Their total fee claim for these years exceeds 1.2 million. The defendants oppose the\naward of any attorneys' fees. Alternatively, they argue on a variety of grounds that plaintiffs' fee claim should be\nreduced. The Court agrees with defendants that a substantial reduction of the fee claim is warranted. For reasons\ndetailed below, the Court finds that plaintiffs are entitled to $386,204.01 in attorneys' fees and costs.\nI. The Decree\nOn December 15, 1976 plaintiffs filed this suit as a class action under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and other federal and\nstate statutes against various officials of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The essence of the action was\nplaintiffs' demand that the defendants create and maintain appropriate community programs for persons\ninstitutionalized at Northampton State Hospital. On August 22, 1977, the Massachusetts Association for Mental\nHealth, Inc. (\"MAMH\") and the Massachusetts Association for Retarded Citizens, Inc. (\"MARC\") were permitted to\nintervene as plaintiff-intervenors.\nThe plaintiff class, defined as all persons who were, as of December 15, 1976, are, or may be hospitalized at the\nNorthampton State Hospital, was certified by this Court on October 27, 1977. Between October 1977 and\nOctober 1978, the plaintiffs and defendants engaged in a \"planning process\"00at the request of the Court00in an\n97 97\nattempt to negotiate a plan for community mental health services for class members in Western Massachusetts\nand, if possible, to resolve the issues presented by the litigation without a trial.\nOn October 23, 1978, plaintiffs and defendants agreed, again at the suggestion of the Court, to incorporate the\nresult of their planning process into a Consent Decree. After approximately six weeks of drafting, all parties\n\nsigned the Consent Decree on December 6, 1978, and the Court approved the Decree after hearing on\nDecember 7, 1978.\nAt the time of its signing, this Decree was00to the best of the Court's knowledge00 the most comprehensive,\n97 97\njudicially enforceable plan for the provision of community mental health services in the country. It was a direct\nproduct of the year-long cooperative planning efforts of plaintiffs and defendants. The Decree itself contains sixty-\ntwo paragraphs setting forth in broad outline the jurisdiction of the Court, definition of terms, principles for\ncreating and maintaining community programs, models for the development of these programs, individual service\nplanning, standards and regulations, personnel and training, evaluation of compliance, and placement\nprocedures. The appointment of a Monitor to oversee implementation, and a description of his or her powers, is\nincluded. The Decree also contains over 200 pages of attachments, analyzing the sub-populations to be served,\ndescribing in great detail twelve different residential program models and thirteen non-residential models to serve\nclients with varying levels of need, and mandating various other responsibilities for defendants including\ndevelopment of needed management services.\nAlthough the Consent Decree is an extensive document, it explicitly fails to wrap up definitively all issues related\nto implementation. The development of a secure treatment center for the residual Northampton State Hospital\npopulation inappropriate for community placement (Paragraph 16), the processes for retraining and transfer of\nhospital staff (Paragraph 35), the creation and maintenance of an adequate training system for community mental\nhealth staff (Paragraph 35), the necessity for and design of legal advocacy services for community mental health\n1072 clients (Paragraph 59), the reorganization and phase-down of the Hospital (Paragraph 43) and the drafting of \n*1072 Regulations (Paragraphs 32 and 33) exemplify issues left by the Decree to further negotiation between the\nplaintiffs and the defendants. All of these paragraphs mandate active plaintiff involvement in resolution of\noutstanding issues.\nBeyond this, the Decree itself reaches years into the future with its provisions for community placements\n(Paragraph 15), upgrading of existing programs (Paragraph 19), development of psychiatric beds in general\nhospitals (Paragraph 17), program licensing (Paragraph 38), funding (Paragraph 47), individual service planning\n(Paragraphs 26 and 27), management information services (Paragraph 40), and programming for persons\ndenominated as mentally retarded (Paragraph 20).\nSince 1978 the efforts of defendants and plaintiffs have gradually resulted in the emergence of a community\nmental health system in Western Massachusetts. Hospital census has been reduced by one-third. Plaintiff class\nmembers have been assessed and individual service plans drafted to reflect each client's needs and strengths.\nCrisis intervention programs now function to reduce or entirely eliminate the necessity for institutionalization for\nmany individuals. Both residential and non-residential, including vocational, programming have been expanded\nand enriched. Appropriations for services for class members have more than quadrupled.\nWhile the full implementation of the Decree has been delayed, significant progress has been made towards\nproviding every plaintiff class member adequate and appropriate treatment in the environment most respectful of\nhis or her freedom and dignity.\nPlaintiffs' counsel have played a vigorous and necessary role in implementation. They have assisted in the\ndrafting of regulations, negotiated myriad administrative disputes with the defendants without the necessity of\ncourt intervention, consulted with the court-appointed Monitor and participated in mediation with the Monitor\nregarding disputes not subject to administrative resolution, evaluated the progress towards implementation of the\nDecree through frequent meetings with Department of Mental Health personnel, reported and vigorously pressed\ncharges of client abuse or neglect both in the community and in the hospital, represented clients during hearings\non the drafting of individual service plans called for in the Decree, negotiated several amendments to various\nparagraphs of the Decree and participated in final negotiations around issues left open by the Decree itself.\nSeveral evidentiary hearings on issues such as human resources, legal advocacy and budgetary matters have\ntaken place before this Court, particularly in the past two years. Plaintiffs' counsel have represented the class in\nthree hearings before the First Circuit Court of Appeals.\nAs in other institutional reform litigation, the entry of the Court's judgment has not terminated the role of the\nplaintiffs' counsel. In important respects, entry of judgment has represented only a beginning. Without\n\ndetermined, competent and dedicated representation, the provisions of this Consent Decree might have had little\npractical significance for the class members.\nII. Attorneys' Fees: General\nAlthough 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988 provides for the award of attorneys' fees in the court's discretion, the Supreme Court\nhas held that a successful plaintiff \"should ordinarily recover an attorney's fee unless special circumstances\nwould render such an award unjust.\" Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, 390 U.S. 400, 402, 88 S.Ct. 964, 966,\n19 L.Ed.2d 1263 (1968). (Action for attorneys' fees under Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ยง 204(b), 42\nU.S.C. ยง 2000a-3(b)).\nThe First Circuit has stated: \"Parties may be considered to have prevailed when they vindicate rights through a\nconsent judgment.\" Nadeau v. Helgemoe, 581 F.2d 275, 279 (1st Cir. 1978).\nThere is no bar to fees for post-judgment remedial work.\n1073 Services devoted to reasonable monitoring of the court's decrees, both to insure *1073 full\ncompliance and to ensure that the plan is indeed working ... are compensable services. They are\nessential to the long-term success of the plaintiff's suit.\nNorthcross v. Board of Education, 611 F.2d 624, 637 (6th Cir. 1979),cert. denied,447 U.S. 911, 100 S.Ct. 2999,\n64 L.Ed.2d 862 (1980).\nIt is clear that, in an appropriate case, an interim award of attorney's fees may be ordered. Hanrahan v. Hampton,\n446 U.S. 754, 757-58, 100 S.Ct. 1987, 1989, 64 L.Ed.2d 670 (1980). Given that judgment has entered pursuant\nto the Consent Decree and given further that implementation of the Decree has been protracted, the Court finds\nconsideration of an interim award at this time reasonable.\nDefendants do not apparently contest any of these propositions. They insist, however, that the plaintiffs are not\nentitled to any attorneys' fees for two reasons. First, they say that the application for fees is not timely, second,\nthey allege that the plaintiffs are not \"prevailing parties,\" as that term is to be understood under the doctrine of \nNadeau v. Helgemoe, supra.\nDefendants note that plaintiffs first filed their application for attorneys' fees on March 21, 1981, more than two\nyears after the entry of the Consent Decree and judgment. Acknowledging that White v. New Hampshire\nDepartment of Social Security, ___ U.S. ___, 102 S.Ct. 1162, 71 L.Ed.2d 325 (1982) permits the District Courts\nto exercise discretion and award attorney's fees in these circumstances, they nevertheless argue that the court\nshould use its discretion to deny fees on the ground that the defendants have been unfairly prejudiced by the\ndelay.\nThis argument might carry weight if the litigation had indeed ended on December 7, 1978. However, the plaintiffs\nand defendants have had an intimate and unbroken relationship since 1976. Despite the Consent Decree, in\nessential respects, the negotiation, monitoring and litigation have unfolded continuously from the initiation of the\nsuit to the present. Moreover, the defendants' complaint that individuals critical to an assessment of the attorneys'\nfees application have moved on to other employment is substantially undercut by the fact that all of these\nindividuals are still employed in eastern Massachusetts and are readily available for discussion and consultation.\nIn fact, some former state employees have filed affidavits or made themselves available for depositions in\nconnection with this application. See, Affidavit of Catherine A. White and Deposition of S. Stephen Rosenfeld.\nThe First Circuit has recently held that, in the absence of a local rule, \"the determination of timeliness rested\nwithin the sound discretion of the District Court.\" White v. New Hampshire Department of Employment Security,\n679 F.2d 283, at 285 (1st Cir. 1982),on remand from ___ U.S. ___, 102 S.Ct. 1162, 71 L.Ed.2d 325 (1982). The\nCourt finds that the defendants have not suffered any significant prejudice as a result of the timing of filing the\nattorneys' application. This factor, therefore, will not bar payment of fees.\nThe issue of whether plaintiffs were \"prevailing parties\" is somewhat more complicated.\n\nIn Nadeau v. Helgemoe, supra, the First Circuit established two criteria for determining when a party will be\nconsidered to have \"prevailed\" for purposes of the attorneys' fees statute. First, the plaintiffs must demonstrate\nthat the lawsuit was factually the \"catalyst\" which prompted the defendants to take particular action. Second,\neven if the lawsuit were the catalyst, defendants' action must not be \"gratuitous,\" but must flow from some legal\ncompulsion.\nDefendants point to the declining populations of other institutions for the mentally ill and mentally retarded\nthroughout the state as evidence that census reduction at Northampton State Hospital constitutes part of a\nvoluntary state-wide policy, and has not been compelled or catalyzed by the lawsuit.\nThe defendants' emphasis on mere census reduction, however, entirely avoids the central theme of the Brewster\n1074 litigation. The *1074 goal of this action has never been census reduction alone; this may be a euphemism for\nwhat has been more pungently described as \"dumping\"00or placing clients into the community without adequate\n97\nservices. On the contrary, the goal of this litigation has been the creation of \"a comprehensive system of\nappropriate, less restrictive treatment, training and support services ....\" Consent Decree, Paragraph 3.\nOn this score, the Decree has been an agent for progress. Millions of new dollars have been committed by the\nstate in recent fiscal years to press forward with the development of a community mental health system in the\nWestern third of the Commonwealth. Defendants do not allege that the exponential growth of this system in the\ngeographic area covered by the Decree has been duplicated elsewhere in the State. Recognizing the unique\ngrowth of community mental health services subject to this Decree, the Department of Mental Health's Individual\nService Plan and Non-Residential Regulations have been made applicable only to Brewster class members. Prior\nto the promulgation of the Consent Decree, the expenditures for community mental health programs for Region I\nwere the lowest in the state; subsequent to the Decree, they became the highest.\nMoreover, a \"policy\" favoring movement of clients from institutional to community settings apparently dates back\nat least to 1966, when the Legislature made community mental health treatment the preferred alternative. But\npolicy commitments by themselves do not necessarily garner hard results. By 1978, when this Decree was\nsigned, little more than the barest skeleton of a community mental health system existed in this part of the\nCommonwealth. The Court finds that this lawsuit was a catalyst which led to the remedies described in the\n[2]\nDecree.\nThe assertion that the actions of the state defendants were gratuitous, and not incited by any constitutional or\nstatutory considerations is similarly groundless. The First Circuit has carefully articulated the method for\nassessing the validity of a fee claim against this criterion.\nEven if plaintiffs can establish that their suit was causally related to the defendants' actions which\nimproved their condition, this is only half of their battle. The test they must pass is legal as well as\nfactual. If it has been judicially determined that defendants' conduct, however beneficial it may be\nto plaintiffs' interests, is not required by law, then defendants must be held to have acted\ngratuitously and plaintiffs have not prevailed in a legal sense. See Taylor v. Safeway Stores, Inc.\n[524 F.2d 263, 273 (10th Cir. 1975) ]. In the present case ... there has not yet been a judicial\ndetermination of whether plaintiffs' rights were violated under traditional standards of analysis. In\nsuch circumstances, one might argue that the district court cannot meaningfully decide the legal\nrequirements that govern defendants' conduct without conducting the very trial the consent decree\nwas signed to avoid. However, we believe the court has had sufficient exposure to the facts and\nlaw of this case to determine, whether if plaintiffs had continued to press their claims under\ntraditional constitutional theory, their action could be considered \"frivolous, unreasonable, or\ngroundless, or that the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so.\" Christianburg\nGarment Co. v. E.E.O.C., 434 U.S. 412, 422, 98 S.Ct. 694, 701, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978) (the\nstandard under which defendants may be entitled to attorney's fees under the 1964 Civil Rights\nAct).\nNadeau v. Helgemoe, supra at 281.\n\nNo court has determined that defendant's conduct is not required by law. The recent Supreme Court decision in \n1075 Youngberg v. Romeo, ___ U.S. ___, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982), offers general support *1075 for the\nposition taken by plaintiffs in their lawsuit. By 1978, lower courts had supported the requirement of treatment in\nthe least restrictive environment. Dixon v. Weinberger, 405 F.Supp. 974 (D.D.C.1975); Lessard v. Schmidt, 349\nF.Supp. 1078 (E.D. Wis.1972),vacated and remanded on other grounds,414 U.S. 473, 94 S.Ct. 713, 38 L.Ed.2d\n661 (1974). More recently, of course, the concept has received additional support. See, e.g., Commonwealth v.\nNassar, 380 Mass. 908, 406 N.E.2d 1286 (1980).\nMoreover, the fact that plaintiffs' original complaint lacked definitive constitutional support does not bar fees. The\npurpose of ยง 1988 is to encourage civil rights actions that may press the boundaries of black-letter doctrine. \nFurtado v. Bishop, 635 F.2d 915, 918-19 (1st Cir. 1980). Certainly, plaintiffs' action is not frivolous, unreasonable\nor groundless.\nThe Court finds that plaintiffs have sufficiently \"prevailed\" in both the legal and the factual sense within the\n[3]\nmeaning of ยง 1988, to warrant payment of attorneys' fees.\nIII. Calculation of the \"Lodestar\"\nHaving determined that neither of defendants' arguments would bar completely payment of attorneys' fees, the\nCourt turns to analysis of the proper method for calculating the amount of fees to be paid.\nThe method for calculating appropriate attorneys' fees under ยง 1988 has been clearly described in Furtado v.\nBishop, 635 F.2d 915 (1st Cir. 1980), which refined the previous decision in King v. Greenblatt, 560 F.2d 1024\n(1st Cir. 1977),cert. denied438 U.S. 916, 98 S.Ct. 3146, 57 L.Ed.2d 1161 (1978). In Furtado, the First Circuit\napproved the \"lodestar\" approach to fee calculation and cited with approval Copeland v. Marshall, 641 F.2d 880\n(D.C.Cir.1980) (en banc). See also, Lindy Bros. Builders, Inc. v. American Standard Radiator & Sanitary Corp.,\n540 F.2d 102 (3rd Cir. 1976) (en banc). More recently, in Miles v. Sampson, 675 F.2d 5 (1st Cir. 1982), the Court\nof Appeals has summarized the procedure for making the calculation.\nUnder this method, there are two principal steps to computing an award of fees. First, a \"lodestar\"\nfee is determined by multiplying a reasonable hourly rate by the number of hours reasonably\nexpended on the lawsuit. Second, the \"lodestar\" is adjusted up or down to reflect factors, such as\nthe contingent nature of success in the lawsuit or the quality of legal representation which have\nnot already been taken into account in computing the \"lodestar\" and which are shown to warrant\nthe adjustment by the party proposing it.\nId., at 8.\nThe Court's analysis in this case will begin with a calculation of reasonable hourly rates for each of the attorneys\ninvolved. The Court will then determine the reasonable number of hours expended on the lawsuit, making certain\nreductions in consideration of factors to be detailed below. Finally, the Court will address the issue of whether the\n\"lodestar\" should be adjusted upward or downward, as urged by the plaintiffs and defendants respectively.\nA. Reasonable Hourly Rates\nSTEVEN J. SCHWARTZ\nSteven J. Schwartz, the lead counsel for the plaintiffs, is a 1971 cum laude graduate of Harvard Law School.\nAttorney Schwartz practiced as staff attorney of the Western Massachusetts Legal Services, staffing their\nGreenfield, Northampton, and Northampton State Hospital offices; he has specialized in poverty law cases and\nrepresented institutionalized persons at Northampton State Hospital. In 1976, Attorney Schwartz established,\nthrough a grant from the National Institute for Mental Health (\"NIMH\") the Mental Patients' Advocacy Project, a\n1076 program designed to train lay advocates to represent mentally *1076 disabled persons. Attorney Schwartz is a\n\nnationally recognized expert who has contributed to securing the rights of institutionalized mentally disabled\npersons through litigation, legislative and regulatory development, consultation and publications.\nThe lodestar rate requested for Attorney Schwartz is $80.00 per hour for 1976, $90.00 per hour for 1977, $100.00\nper hour for 1978, $110.00 per hour for 1979 and $120.00 per hour for 1980.\nThe Court believes that this fee range is somewhat above the level generally demanded by others with Attorney\nSchwartz's background and above rates awarded in similar cases. Defendants have suggested rates of $50.00 to\n$80.00 per hour and the Court finds a fee of $80.00 for Attorney Schwartz's \"core\" litigation services to be\nreasonable. In this district fees for similar work have ranged from $50.00 to $100.00 per hour. See Ingerson v.\nHogan, No. 76-3255-S (D.Mass. Order entered April 6, 1982) slip op. at 5, n. 2. To compensate plaintiffs for delay\nin payment, the Court will use the same hourly rate for all years claimed.\nSlightly lesser rates should be paid for activities in the nature of support and preparation. Thus, the Court will\naward Attorney Schwartz the full hourly rate for the time spent during meetings directly related to litigation, during\ndirect meetings with the Attorney General, for court appearances and for activity directly related to court\nappearances including the preparation of briefs and memoranda. Monitoring and implementation of the Decree,\nalong with drafting of regulations, have been awarded the slightly lower rate of $70.00 per hour, in recognition of\nthe fact that these activities are, on the one hand, not as strenuous as litigation, but on the other hand are\ndemanding tasks requiring a high degree of experience and professionalism. Other activities, including\ncorrespondence, telephone calls, general planning and negotiating sessions, general research and consultation\nactivities and work in connection with preparation of the application for attorneys' fees have been compensated at\n[4]\nthe still lower hourly rate of $60.00 per hour,  recognizing that these activities are less strenuous and ancillary\nto the basic tasks of litigation and implementation of the Decree.\nROBERT D. FLEISCHNER\nRobert D. Fleischner, co-counsel for the plaintiffs, is a 1973 graduate of Boston College Law School. As a\npracticing attorney at Western Massachusetts Legal Services for five years, Attorney Fleischner has had\nexperience in representing clients in poverty law cases, and has specialized in juvenile and education law. As\nAssistant Director at the Mental Patients Advocacy Project he has, along with Attorney Schwartz, taken primary\nresponsibility for the conduct of this litigation, for the years 1978-80. In addition, he has represented clients in civil\ncommitment and guardianship hearings and participated as amicus curiae in related cases. Attorney Fleischner\nteaches mental health law at Smith College Graduate School for Social Work. As a mental disability law expert he\nhas consulted nationally.\nAttorney Fleischner's lodestar request is $80.00 per hour for 1978, $90.00 per hour for 1979, and $100.00 per\nhour for 1980.\nFor reasons described in the discussion regarding Attorney Schwartz, the Court will award a fee of $80.00 per\nhour for \"core\" litigation and fees of $60.00 to $70.00 per hour for other activities.\nOTHER COUNSEL\nWell over 90% of the hours expended by plaintiffs' counsel in this case were put in by Attorneys Schwartz and\nFleischner. The hours claimed by six other counsel have not been broken down by task in the plaintiffs'\n1077 submissions with the same specificity as the hours of Attorneys Schwartz and *1077 Fleischner.[5] It is clear from\nthe submissions, however, that the bulk of the hours contributed by these attorneys came mainly in connection\nwith core litigation activities, such as preparation of memoranda or strategy conferences. Recognizing the lack of\nspecificity, however, the Court has set the rates of these attorneys towards the lower end of the allowable range.\n\nJAN C. COSTELLO\nAs a 1976 graduate of the Yale Law School, Jan C. Costello worked for two years as staff attorney at the Mental\nPatients Advocacy Project, 1976-78. Prior to this experience, Attorney Costello worked as an intern/law clerk with\nthe Mental Health Law Project in Washington D. C. Although a recent graduate, Attorney Costello had specialized\ntraining and experience in mental disability law.\nThe lodestar request for Jan C. Costello is $50.00 per hour for 1976, $55.00 per hour for 1977, and $60.00 per\nhour for 1978.\nBecause of her relative inexperience at the time, the Court has awarded a flat rate of $50.00 per hour for her\nwork.\nWILLIAM C. NEWMAN\nAttorney Newman graduated in 1976 from Northeastern University School of Law and is a partner in the\nNorthampton law firm of Lesser, Newman, Sibbison & Souweine. Attorney Newman has specialized in civil rights\nand mental health litigation. He has participated as a consultant in the preparation and litigation of this case.\nThe lodestar request for William C. Newman is $55.00 per hour for 1976, $60.00 per hour for 1977 and $65.00\nper hour for 1978.\nBecause of his relative inexperience at the time, the Court has awarded a flat rate of $50.00 per hour for his\nwork.\nTHOMAS B. LESSER\nAttorney Thomas Lesser is a 1971 graduate of Harvard Law School and a partner of the Northampton law firm of\nLesser, Newman, Sibbison & Souweine. Attorney Lesser has extensive trial experience in federal and state court\nand he has represented clients in commitment hearings at Northampton State Hospital. Attorney Lesser brought\nhis expertise as a consultant in the early pre-trial and trial aspects of this case.\nThomas Lesser's lodestar request is $65.00 per hour for 1976, $70.00 per hour for 1977, $75.00 per hour for\n1978.\nThe Court will award a flat rate of $60.00 per hour, given Attorney Lesser's background and taking into\nconsideration that he acted mainly as a consultant without primary responsibility for the conduct of the litigation.\nSTEPHEN ARONS\nAttorney Arons is an Associate Professor of Legal Studies at the University of Massachusetts and a 1969 cum\nlaude graduate of Harvard Law School. Attorney Arons participated in the development of the Mental Patients\nAdvocacy Project and acted initially as director. Attorney Arons has extensive knowledge and experience in\nconstitutional law and federal court litigation. As an expert in the field of mental disability law, he has provided\nconsultation to this lawsuit and other cases around the country.\nThe lodestar request for Stephen Arons is $100.00 per hour for 1976 through 1978. His awarded rate is\ndiscussed below.\n\nIRA HOROWITZ\nIra Horowitz is a 1968 graduate from the University of Chicago Law School and was Director of Litigation and\nTraining at Western Massachusetts Legal Services. Attorney Horowitz has had substantial experience in public\ninterest litigation particularly in the federal courts. Attorney Horowitz acted as senior consulting attorney on this\nlaw suit providing expertise in developing legal theories and planning litigation. He has been a training consultant\nto the Office of Program Support of the Legal Services Corporation in Washington, D. C.\nThe lodestar request for Attorney Horowitz is $100.00 per hour for 1976 through 1978. His awarded rate is\ndiscussed below.\n1078  E. OLIVER FOWLKES\n*1078\nAttorney Fowlkes is a 1968 law school graduate and an assistant professor of law at Hampshire College.\nAttorney Fowlkes is experienced in representing institutionalized persons and assisted in the development of the\nMental Patients Advocacy Project. As an expert in disability law, Attorney Fowlkes has been involved in several\nclass action suits representing institutionalized mental patients. He has published papers, and has acted as a\nconsultant for the National Institute for Mental Health.\nThe lodestar request for E. Oliver Fowlkes is $100.00 per hour for 1976 through 1978.\nAttorneys Arons, Fowlkes and Horowitz, as noted, are experienced attorneys in the area of mental health law,\nused mainly as consultants in the preparation of briefs and memoranda, or during meetings in the early stages of\nthe litigation. Their experience, in more primary roles, might justify the award of higher hourly rates, but in view of\ntheir role as consultants only, the Court has awarded flat hourly rates of $70.00 per hour for each.\nB. Hours Reasonably Expended\nThe plaintiffs have submitted schedules detailing the hours claimed to have been expended in connection with\nthis litigation. The material was presented to the Court in two segments including a schedule of hours spent thru\ncalendar year 1980 and a schedule of hours expended during the calendar year of 1981. For reasons to be\nexplained, the Court will calculate the lodestars for the periods 1976 through 1980 and 1981 separately.\nThe attached appendix details the number of hours claimed by each of the eight attorneys involved in this case\nby year and, in the case of Attorneys Schwartz and Fleischner, by category of task.\n1) 1976-1980\nAttorney Schwartz has calculated the total hours spent by him in connection with this litigation for the five years in\nquestion as 4,143.75. Total hours claimed by Attorney Fleischner are 628.55.\nThe requested total hours for the other six counsel employed in this case are as follows:\n                               Hours\nJan C. Costello                140.0\nWilliam C. Newman               63.0\nThomas Lesser                  127.5\nIra Horowitz                    84.8\nStephen Arons                   50.2\nE. Oliver Fowlkes               21.5\n\nThus, the total number of attorney hours claimed by plaintiffs in the years 1976 through 1980 is 5,259.3.\nDefendants have not suggested that any of the hours claimed in any way has been deliberately misrepresented.\nThey do argue, however, that plaintiffs have made claims for unnecessary work, or for time not properly\ncompensable. More vigorously, they criticize as unreliable the methods used by the plaintiffs in reconstructing\ntime records which were not contemporaneously maintained. The Court will address each of the defendants'\narguments.\nFirst, the defendants argue that legal representation consisting of general monitoring and implementation of the\nDecree is not compensable. The only legal work for which plaintiffs' counsel are entitled to payment, say\ndefendants, must grow out of post-Decree disputes in which plaintiffs can claim to be \"prevailing parties.\"\nThis argument ignores the fact that the Decree itself clearly envisions a prominent role for plaintiffs' counsel in\nimplementation. As described above, numerous paragraphs of the Decree mandate plaintiff involvement.\nDefendants signed the Decree knowing this fact and knowing, further, that an application for counsel fees by\nplaintiffs might be submitted. Deposition of S. Stephen Rosenfeld, at 40-41.\nIt would be entirely contrary to the concept of cooperation underlying a Consent Decree, and would compromise\njudicial economy, to require plaintiffs' counsel to inflate every implementation negotiation into a full scale dispute\n1079 in which they would *1079 then \"prevail,\" in order to justify attorneys' fees. As noted, the Court has found that the\nplaintiffs \"prevailed\" for purposes of ยง 1988 when the Consent Decree was entered; work necessarily related to\n[6]\ninsuring implementation of the Decree, or called for by the Decree itself, is compensable.  The Court finds that\nthe sorts of tasks performed by plaintiffs' counsel fall into this category. See Northcross v. Board of Education,\nsupra, at 637.\nTo the extent that plaintiffs' post-Decree activities may have been superfluous or excessive, the Court will\nconsider this factor in determining a percentage reduction of the requested hours. To the extent that\nimplementation activities are less demanding than actual trial work, the Court has already reduced plaintiffs'\nhourly rates.\nSecond, with regard to the period prior to entry of the Decree, defendants assert that no fees should be allowed\nfor the period when plaintiffs were engaged in a \"planning process\" with defendants. They allege that the\nconsiderable number of hours spent by the plaintiffs in the biweekly planning meetings during this period \"had\nlittle to do with the substance of the lawsuit.\" Defendants' Brief at p. 12.\nThis is not the case. The planning process was undertaken at the request of the Court explicitly as an effort\ndesigned to obviate the necessity for a trial and, if possible, deliver to the plaintiff class services that all parties\nseemed to recognize as crucial, without adversarial litigation. The last paragraph of the plaintiffs' written response\nto the defendants' letter of October 18, 1977 to the Court makes this clear.\nWe would hope that the above clarification will be promptly accepted by all parties in order that the\nplanning process, and the eventual resolution of this litigation, can proceed without further delay.\nLetter dated November 8, 1977 from plaintiffs' counsel Steven J. Schwartz and Boisfeuillet Jones, Jr. to Assistant\nAttorney General S. Stephen Rosenfeld, (emphasis supplied). Exhibit B to Affidavit of Catherine White,\nDefendants' Appendix at 12.\nIn addition, the biweekly planning meetings clearly generated the pitch of the subsequent Consent Decree.\nProperly understood, this process was essentially an extended settlement negotiation. It is hardly surprising,\ngiven the complexity of this form of public institutional litigation, that the negotiations were unusually protracted.\nFinally, the defendants themselves have frequently conceded the plaintiffs' critical and appropriate role in the\nplanning process that led to the Decree. In their letter to the Court of October 18, 1977, under the heading \"Role\nof Plaintiffs,\" counsel for the defendants clearly recognized this.\nThe defendants envision counsel for the plaintiffs playing a substantial role in this process [i.e. the\nplanning process] both in their formal capacity in this lawsuit and in their continuing capacity as\n\nadvocates for individual residents at Northampton. We see them making an especially valuable\ncontribution in helping to develop procedures for transfer as well as assisting in the location and\ndevelopment of suitable community placements.\nExhibit A of Affidavit of Catherine White, Defendants' Appendix at 7.\nIt is hardly equitable for defendants to seek actively plaintiffs' assistance on the one hand, and bar fees for these\nvery contributions on the other.\nIt is worth noting, moreover, that plaintiffs' activities during the \"planning process\" have generally been\ncompensated at a lower hourly rate than other work. The Court finds that this reduced fee rate is appropriate.\n1080 Defendants advance as their third argument for reducing the fee, that plaintiffs *1080 are not entitled to\ncompensation for work devoted to discrete issues on which they clearly did not prevail. On this point, the Court\nagrees. This argument applies only to work done in 1981, however, and will be addressed below.\nFourth, defendants object to \"over-lawyering\" on the part of plaintiffs, as tending to inflate the fee claim. With this\ncontention, the Court again agrees. Review of the plaintiffs' submissions demonstrates that as many as four\nseparate counsel attended meetings at the early stages of the litigation. This factor has been considered by the\nCourt in rendering a percentage reduction of the hours claimed.\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, defendants object to plaintiffs' manner of reconstructing time records. It is\nnot disputed that for the years 1976-1979 plaintiffs did not maintain contemporaneous time records. To some\nextent this is understandable. The controlling statute did not take effect until 1976. Before Reynolds v. Coomey,\n567 F.2d 1166, 1167 (1st Cir. 1977) some confusion existed as to whether legal services attorneys were always\nentitled to fees.\nOn the other hand, while a lack of contemporaneous time records would not justify elimination of attorneys' fees \nin toto, in this case the Court agrees that a significant reduction of the hours claimed is appropriate.\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court will reduce all the compensable hours claimed by twenty percent. In making\nan across-the-board percentage reduction in requested compensable hours, rather than performing an item-by-\nitem accounting, the Court is following accepted practice. Copeland v. Marshall, supra, 641 F.2d at 903.\nThe lodestar for the years 1976-1980 has been calculated in Section V. The totals are as follows:\n                                      Amount\nSteven J. Schwartz                  $216,856.40\nRobert D. Fleischner                  34,875.60\nJan C. Costello                        5,600.00\nThomas Lesser                          6,120.00\nWilliam C. Newman                      2,520.00\nSteven Horowitz                        4,748.80\nStephen Arons                          2,811.20\nE. Oliver Fowlkes                      1,204.00\nThe plaintiffs have claimed up to $65.00 per hour for travel. Particularly in view of the necessity to commute from\nthe western part of the state to Boston for frequent meetings, the Court finds that some fees for travel time are\njustified. Defendants concede this but object that the claimed rate is too high. The Court agrees that travel rates\nshould be drastically reduced and will order $20.00 per hour for travel. Thus the total time claimed for travel for\n1976-1980 is 303 which, at a rate of $20.00 per hour, leaves a total of $6,060.00. Adding $14,115.00 in costs\nresults in a total lodestar for 1976-80 of $294,911.00.\n\n2) 1981\nTurning to the year 1981, the issues are both simpler and more complicated. On the one hand, claims are made\nonly for the representation by Attorneys Fleischner and Schwartz, who claim 721.4 and 279.55 hours\nrespectively. The details of their claims, by category, appear in Section V of this Memorandum. The issue of\nmaintenance of contemporary time records is almost eliminated because by this period both attorneys were\nmaintaining such records, in general. Similarly, the problem of duplication of representation is much reduced due\nto the absence of other attorneys involved in the case. In view of the complexity of the issues involved the Court\nis not inclined to penalize the plaintiffs for the attendance of two attorneys at some hearings or meetings. It is\nworth noting that the defendants in general had at least two, and sometimes more, attorneys at pertinent\nhearings or meetings.\nOn the other hand, the issues in calculation of fees during this year are more complicated, due to the failure of\nthe plaintiffs to \"prevail\" on at least two issues.\nOn the issue of the fiscal year 1982 (FY '82) budget, two hearings were held before this Court and two arguments\n1081 before *1081 the First Circuit Court of Appeals. Orders and memoranda were issued by this Court on September\n15 and December 23, 1981, which were subsequently modified and affirmed in part and vacated in part by the\nCourt of Appeals. Brewster v. Dukakis, 675 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1982). It is clear that at least as regards part of the FY\n'82 budget issue, the plaintiffs were not the prevailing party. At the same time, the fact that the plaintiffs were\nprevailing with regard to a portion of this issue makes it difficult to quantify arithmetically the precise number of\nhours that might be justified in connection with litigation of this issue.\nIn addition, the Court held hearings and rendered an opinion on the issues of legal advocacy and human\nresources for clients. Brewster v. Dukakis, 520 F.Supp. 882 (D.Mass.1981). While defendants did not appeal the\nCourt's decision on human resources, the Court's Order on advocacy was appealed and has recently been\nvacated and remanded. Brewster v. Dukakis, No. 81-1687, (1st Cir. June 22, 1982). Again, because this Court's\ninitial decision entwined two issues, a precise division of time is not possible. The fact that it is difficult to separate\nout time spent according to whether a litigant prevailed or did not prevail will not justify total disallowance of the\nclaim. Nadeau v. Helgemoe, at 279.\nBased on this, the Court will reduce the hours claimed by Attorneys Fleischner and Schwartz for litigation\n[7]\nactivities by one-third for 1981, and for all other activities by ten percent.  The computation is set forth in\nSection V; total hours for Attorney Schwartz are 619.52, and for Attorney Fleischner, 237.88. Multiplying these\nhours by the awarded rates results in a 1981 lodestar for Attorney Schwartz of $40,298.80, and for Attorney\nFleischner of $15,966.70.\nCalculating twenty-eight hours of 1981 travel at $20.00 per hour adds $560.00 to their total.\nThus, adding costs of $926.24, the total lodestar for 1981 is $57,751.74.\nIV. Adjustment of Lodestar\nThe plaintiffs have requested that the Court increase the lodestar amount by 100%, pointing to the contingent\nnature of the case, the substantial delay in payment, the quality of the attorneys' work, and the significance of the\nresults, all factors to be considered under the rubric of King v. Greenblatt, supra, in the framework of the Lindy-\nCopeland-Furtado decisions.\nThe Court finds that as to all of the factors suggested, a substantial increase in the lodestar amount would be\nwarranted.\nFirst, the case was highly contingent in nature. The judicial and constitutional underpinnings of the plaintiffs'\nclaim, while not illusory, did lack definitive support at the time the suit was filed. Even today, the precise\nboundaries of the rights of the plaintiff class remain unclear. Courts have awarded an increase to the lodestar\n\namount in response to considerations of contingency such as were faced by the plaintiffs in this case. Stenson v.\nBlum, 512 F.Supp. 680 (S.D.N.Y.1981)aff'd,617 F.2d 493 (2nd Cir. 1981),petition for cert. docketed, 50 U.S.\nL.W. 3744 (U.S. March 16, 1982) (50% increase), Halderman v. Pennhurst, 533 F.Supp. 661 (E.D.Pa.1982)\n(300% and 50% increases).\nSecond, the Court is sensitive to the excellent quality of work performed by the plaintiffs' attorneys and to their\nhigh degree of dedication, which has been far above the level that might ordinarily be expected from attorneys\nwith their experience and background. Partly because of this level of competence and commitment, the Consent\nDecree was first negotiated and finally drafted, saving the Court and more importantly the disabled clients at\n1082 issue here the strain and delay of a lengthy *1082 trial. Along with the staff of paralegals they have trained, they\nhave represented clients in individual complaints both in the Hospital and in the scores of small programs now\nestablished in the community. They have not only assisted in drafting regulations, but have assisted all\ncommunity programs under the Decree to give workshops to staff on the content of the regulations. In addition to\nlegal skills, the issues in the Decree have necessitated a close familiarity with a body of relevant clinical\nknowledge, as well as knowledge of the state's fiscal and administrative processes. Since their efforts often broke\nnew ground, they lacked the assistance of prior models to guide them in carrying out their broad responsibilities\n[8]\nunder the Decree.  The Court finds the quality of work justifies a percentage increase in the lodestar.\nThird, the significance of the results obtained is unusually impressive. Only the faint outlines of the community\nmental health system could be perceived at the outset of this litigation; the Consent Decree has produced a\nfunctioning community mental health system able to respond flexibly in most cases to the needs of thousands of\nmentally disabled persons in the western part of the state of Massachusetts. Plaintiffs have had a substantial role\n[9]\nin creating this system and deserve an increase to their fee based on this outstanding result.\nAbsent countervailing considerations, the Court would be inclined to increase the lodestar amount by at least\n50%. However, the Court agrees with defendants that countervailing considerations do exist in this case. First,\nthe defendants themselves are to be complimented for their generally high degree of flexibility and dedication.\nObviously the enormous amount achieved through the implementation of this Decree to date would not have\nbeen possible without a substantial degree of cooperation among plaintiffs and defendants. Second, the Court is\nsensitive to the fact that this legal fee will be paid out of the public treasury. See Keyes v. School District No. 1,\n439 F.Supp. 393, 414-415 (D.Colo.1977). Third, the Court takes notice that the fee in any case is substantial, that\na second application for attorneys' fees for the plaintiff-intervenor is still pending and, finally, that additional\ninterim applications for attorneys' fees can be anticipated for at least this year and the coming year. For all the\nforegoing reasons, the Court has determined to increase the amount of the attorneys' fees by 10% in recognition\nof the contingent nature of the case, the high quality of work performed by the plaintiffs' counsel, and the\nsignificance of the result. This 10% adjustment will be added to the total actual attorneys' fees award.\nV. Calculation of Attorneys' Fees\nThe detailed calculation of attorneys' fees is as follows:\n              ATTORNEY SCHWARTZ  1976-1980\n                          Hours           Adjustment       Rate

Conclusion\nBecause of its sensitivity to the fact that these fees are to be paid out of the public treasury and acknowledging\nthat the fee award though much reduced is high, the Court will permit defendants to pay the fee in two equal\ninstallments, the first to be paid on or before September 1, 1982 and the second on or before September 1, 1983.\n[1] This Memorandum pertains only to the application of attorneys attached to, or consulting with, the Mental\nPatients Advocacy Project, which represents the named plaintiffs and the plaintiff-intervenor Massachusetts\nAssociation for Mental Health. The application on behalf of plaintiff-intervenor Massachusetts Association for\nRetarded Citizens was received too late for consideration by the Court in this Memorandum and will be\naddressed at a later date.\n[2] Defendants appear to concede that plaintiffs' actions were not \"completely superfluous\" in effecting\nprogrammatic change. Nadeau v. Helgemoe, supra, at 281. Defendants' Brief at 8, n. 4. Plaintiffs prevail if they\nsucceed \"on any significant issue which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing the suit.\" Id.,\nat 279.\n[3] The exception to this general conclusion is the work done during the year 1981, when plaintiffs did not prevail\nfactually on two discrete issues. These issues will be addressed below.\n[4] Defendants' brief suggests $57.50 as a reasonable hourly rate for preparation of the fees application.\nDefendants' brief at 27. Courts may use varying rates to compensate attorneys for more or less demanding\ntasks. Miles v. Sampson, supra at 9.\n\n[5] A breakdown of hours by type of task is made only for \"other\" attorneys, so it is difficult to determine which of\nthese attorneys was employed on which category of task.\n[6] Despite the use of the term \"monitoring\" the activities of plaintiffs' counsel have not duplicated those of the\ncourt-appointed Monitor. The Monitor evaluates services under the Decree, resolves minor disputes, attempts to\nmediate major disputes, makes suggestions for implementation and submits reports to the Court. He does not\nhave direct responsibility for insuring implementation of the Decree or advocating on behalf of plaintiff class\nmembers.\n[7] In making the percentage reductions in claimed hours for all six years, the Court has taken into consideration\nthat plaintiffs have made no claim for compensation for some 2,000 hours for work performed by paralegals and\nlaw students. It would not have been improper to claim paralegal hours as part of a fee request, Lamphere v.\nBrown University, 610 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir. 1979), and the Court's reduction might have been more severe had\nthese hours been included in the application. See also Furtado v. Bishop, supra, at 920.\n[8] Because of the uncertainty now surrounding the issue of the state's responsibility to fund advocacy services,\nand the expiration of the NIMH grant which has hitherto funded plaintiffs' counsel, an appropriate grant of\nattorneys' fees may be a significant source of funds for prospective legal services for the class.\n[9] Plaintiffs have offered a fourth reason for increasing the lodestar amount00delay in payment 00which the Court\n97 97\nrejects. First, by waiting over two years to file their application, plaintiffs themselves contributed to the delay.\nSecond, by assigning the same hourly rates for work over several years the effect of delay in payment is muted.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

DUKAKIS, et al., Defendants, Appellants.\nNo. 81-1687.\nUnited States Court of Appeals, First Circuit.\nArgued February 12, 1982.\nDecided June 28, 1982.\nRehearing Denied August 23, 1982.\nBruce E. Mohl, Asst. Atty. Gen., Government Bureau, Boston, Mass., with whom Francis X. Bellotti, Atty. Gen.,\nBoston, Mass., was on brief, for defendants, appellants.\nSteven J. Schwartz, Springfield, Mass., with whom Robert D. Fleischner, Nonnie S. Burnes, and Hill & Barlow,\nBoston, Mass., were on brief, for plaintiffs, appellees.\n[*]\nBefore ALDRICH and BREYER, Circuit Judges, and TORRUELLA,  District Judge.\nBREYER, Circuit Judge.\nAppellants, representing the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, seek to overturn a district court order requiring\nthem to develop, and to pay for, a program of legal assistance for mentally ill and retarded people. The district\ncourt, in connection with its ongoing supervision of a consent decree, ordered the Commonwealth to create an\nindependent legal advocacy program that would represent mentally ill or retarded clients on issues arising out of\na client's \"disability,\" \"prior ... institutionalization,\" or \"current institutionalization.\" After examining the language of\nthe decree, its background, its purposes, and other relevant law, we agree with appellants that the court has no\nlegal authority to require the Commonwealth over its objection to pay for a broad legal services program. We\ntherefore vacate the district court's order.\nI\nThe consent decree in this case represents the negotiated settlement of a suit filed in 1976 as a class action in\nfederal district court by nine residents of Northampton State Hospital in Western Massachusetts. The plaintiffs,\nappellees here, claimed that the Commonwealth's programs for treating mentally ill and retarded people violated\nstate and federal law (constitutional and statutory) which, in their view, required treatment in less restrictive, more\nnormal surroundings. After two years of negotiation, the parties agreed to enter a consent decree. The\nCommonwealth 00 represented by the Governor, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Administration and\n97\nFinance, the Secretary of Human Services, and the Commissioner of the Department of Mental Health 00 did not\n97\nadmit any violation of law. But in the decree it promises to provide a \"less restrictive\" system of mental health\n496 care. It undertakes to provide community *496 mental health services, offering less restrictive residential facilities\nand nonresidential treatment programs, with the aim of allowing hospitalized patients to leave Northampton State\nHospital and find a place to live, and to obtain treatment, in their communities. The decree is lengthy and\ndetailed; it explicitly leaves some issues undecided and open to future resolution. It provides for ongoing court\nsupervision with the assistance of a court-appointed monitor. It has been the subject of previous litigation in this\ncourt, see, e.g., Brewster v. Dukakis, 675 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1982).\nThis particular appeal arises out of the decree's arrangements for resolving one of the controversies explicitly left\nundecided, namely, the appropriate type, role, and financing of a system of legal advocacy for the mentally ill and\nretarded. Although the parties could not agree about these matters in 1978, they wrote into the decree a provision\nthat dealt with the issue as follows:\n\nยถ 59. The Monitor will investigate and determine the necessity for trained, independent advocates\nto assist clients in the protection of their rights as set forth in relevant statutes, regulations, and the\nprovisions of this Decree, including the attachments hereto. The Monitor will submit its\nrecommendation to the parties and the Court by January 1, 1980, on the appropriate role of and\nfunding for such independent advocacy. The plaintiffs and defendants agree to cooperate in\ninvestigating sources of funding and in seeking federal funds to establish and maintain an\nadvocacy system, to the extent such is determined to be appropriate.\nPursuant to this paragraph, the Monitor asked an expert consultant, a lawyer with special qualifications and\nexperience in this area, to undertake a study of the problem. The consultant prepared a lengthy report, and\nsubmitted it to the Monitor in September 1980. This report appears to constitute the basis for the order under\nchallenge.\nThe report begins by setting out many rights that the author believes are conferred upon mentally ill people by\nlaw, including the decree, administrative regulations, statutes and constitutions. Some of these rights are highly\ngeneral, such as rights to treatment, to a nonrestrictive environment, to decent facilities, to fair procedural rules.\nOthers involve nondiscrimination, such as the right of equal access to educational, recreational, transportation,\nand medical services. Still others are detailed and specific, such as rights to stationery, postage, storage space,\nand access to a telephone. As these examples suggest, the list of rights is extensive, ranging from practical\nissues, such as a decent diet, to individual rights, such as treatment with dignity. The report goes on to make a\npowerful case that the 13 pages of specific rights which it lists as those of the mentally ill may remain only paper\npromises, unless the mentally ill are also provided with independent advocates who can represent them\nindividually. The report's 200 pages argue clearly and strongly for a general, state-financed, system of\nindependent advocates to secure these rights for the mentally ill and retarded.\nIn January 1981, the Monitor, acting pursuant to ยถ 59, made recommendations more modest, but roughly similar\nto those that the consultant suggested. He noted that independent legal advocates are needed and that, after\nJune 1982, it will be difficult for many existing advocacy organizations to find funding. He concluded that the state\nshould pay for at least a few lawyers to act as the nucleus of a general, independent legal advocacy system.\nSubsequently, the Commonwealth asked the court to declare that it had no legal obligation to pay for such a\nprogram. The court held an evidentiary hearing. The consultant and others testified. Appellees submitted\naffidavits, for example, from patients whom legal advocates had helped to obtain such benefits as better\ntreatment and vocational training. Appellants submitted evidence that their existing program of \"service\ncoordinators\" meets those needs for which the Monitor recommended independent legal advocates. But, the\n497 Commonwealth's main argument was a legal *497 one 00 that it could not be required to pay for the legal\n97\nadvocacy program, because the law imposes no such obligation.\nThe district court, on August 19, 1981, rejected the Commonwealth's argument and accepted the Monitor's\nrecommendations. It ordered the Commonwealth to present a specific detailed plan for carrying out those\nrecommendations. Appellants appeal from that order.\nII\nAlthough appellants argued in the district court that the Commonwealth's \"service coordinator\" program was\nadequate to secure the rights of the mentally ill, they will concede for purposes of this appeal that an independent\nlegal advocacy program is highly desirable. They do not take issue with the soundness of the recommendations\nof the expert consultant or the Monitor. They argue only that, as a matter of law, the district court lacks the power\nto force the Commonwealth to pay for the recommended program. And that question 00 not the desirability of the\n97\nprogram 00 is the sole issue that we consider.\n97\nThe district court found the source of its power in the decree itself. We have examined the decree and the record\nin detail, keeping in mind that the district court is more familiar with the background of the litigation than are we. \nCf. Brown v. Neeb, 644 F.2d 551, 558 n.12 (6th Cir. 1981). Nonetheless, we have been unable to find adequate\n\nauthority in the decree for the court's order. Nor can we find adequate authority elsewhere in the law. If the\ndecree provides this authority, it must be found in some combination of language, structure or purpose. A\ndiscussion of each of these aspects of the decree, in turn, should indicate why we are unable to find the requisite\nauthority.\n1. Language. The language of the decree, if given its ordinary meaning, does not authorize the court to order the\nCommonwealth to fund a general legal advocacy program for the mentally ill. Paragraph 59, which deals\nspecifically with legal advocacy, instructs the Monitor to \"investigate and determine\" the need for \"trained,\nindependent advocates.\" He is to \"submit\" his \"recommendation to the parties and the Court.\" (Emphasis added.)\nThe paragraph goes on to state that the parties will \"cooperate in investigating sources of funding and in seeking\nfederal funds.\" But it says no more. It does not specifically authorize the court to order the parties to accept the\nMonitor's recommendations. Cf. New York State Association for Retarded Children, Inc. v. Carey, 596 F.2d 27,\n33, 37 (2d Cir.),cert. denied,444 U.S. 836, 100 S.Ct. 70, 62 L.Ed.2d 46 (1979).\nThe court relied for its power upon ยถ 59 in combination with ยถยถ 5 and 6 of the decree. Yet, the language of these\nparagraphs, if given its ordinary meaning, also seems inadequate. The relevant sentences of ยถ 5 (which appears\nin the \"general\" section of the decree) read as follows:\nThis Decree includes a final, substantive resolution of most of the issues raised by this litigation.\nTo the extent that current information renders final, substantive settlement of an issue\nimpracticable, the parties have agreed upon a schedule and process for collaboration and/or\nnegotiation, supervised by the Court, which the parties believe can lead to a final resolution of the\nissue in a fair and reasonable manner.\nThis language suggests that the parties intended to resolve through negotiation or collaboration certain issues\nthat the decree left open. This expectation seems reasonable given the fact (as the briefs point out) that relations\nbetween the parties were good: both sides believed in, and were working to achieve, \"deinstitutionalization\" (the\nmain object of the decree); and negotiation has led to resolution of most of the other undecided issues. Moreover,\nthis language says only that the court shall \"supervise\" the \"process for collaboration and/or negotiation.\" It does\nnot say that the court shall \"resolve\" the issues subject to that process. Courts, as well as administrative bodies,\nare familiar with the difference between encouraging parties to settle a dispute (or supervising a settlement\n498 process) *498 and deciding a dispute over objection. There is not here any evidence of \"bad faith\" by a party that\ncould transform the one power into the other.\nParagraph 6 (also contained in the \"general\" section of the decree) reads as follows:\nJurisdiction is retained by the Court until further order, to enable any party to apply at any time for\nsuch further orders as may be necessary or appropriate for the interpretation, implementation,\nenforcement, or modification of the terms of this Decree and for supervision and approval of the\nresolution of issues left for further planning and negotiation.\nThe first part of this sentence does not grant the needed authority. Even if one viewed this order as one\n\"appropriate for the ... implementation ... of the terms\" of the decree, one would still have to find elsewhere in the\ndecree specific \"terms\" that the order implements. Nor does the order purport to be one of \"modification\" of\nterms. The last clause of the sentence gives the court the power of \"supervision and approval of the resolution of\nissues left for further planning and negotiation....\" (Emphasis added.) It does not speak of the court's powers of\n\"supervision and approval and resolution\" of issues left for future settlement. Thus, it is most naturally read as\nspecifying the court's authority to incorporate into the decree, and to implement, the results of negotiations on\nopen issues, not as granting the court authority to resolve those issues itself.\nParagraph 50, to which appellees also point, states that if unforeseen difficulties arise which \"significantly\nthreaten implementation, the problem may be brought to the Court for its attention.\" There is no indication that we\nare dealing here with an \"unforeseen difficulty.\" But, even if this paragraph were relevant, its language does not\nconfer the power at issue.\nIn sum, the language of the decree's \"general\" provisions, while recognizing the existence of major open issues,\ncannot, without straining, be read automatically to grant the court a general power to resolve all open issues,\n\nother than in conformity with procedures specified elsewhere. And, the more specific provision relevant here (ยถ\n59) allows the Monitor to investigate and to recommend, but it does not state that the Monitor or the court shall\nresolve the matter of a broad, general, independent, legal services program for the mentally ill.\nNonetheless, these clauses do not forbid court resolution. And, there is, at least arguably, some ambiguity in\nsome of the language. We therefore go on to see whether there are special reasons, arising out of the decree's\nstructure or purposes, or out of the parties' likely intent, for allowing the district court, nonetheless, to read the\nneeded authority into this language.\n2. Structure. The \"structural\" argument rests on an analogy to three other sets of provisions that concern issues\ndeliberately left open. These other provisions arguably bear upon the proper interpretation of the language just\ndiscussed. The first set of these provisions concerns the powers of the Monitor. Paragraph 55, for example,\nstates that \"an individual complaint or problem\" of a client or resident may be brought to the attention of the\nMonitor \"for appropriate action.\" He may make \"a recommendation to the defendants\" to resolve the problem. His\n\"action on individual complaints or problems will be considered final.\" Paragraph 56 gives the Monitor \"authority\nto make recommendations with regard to implementation of the Decree if ... the Monitor believes that the\ndefendants are not in compliance with the Decree [and certain other conditions are fulfilled]....\" The\n\"recommendations\" are binding on the parties unless they file an objection with the court and request a hearing.\nParagraph 57 allows the monitor to \"make recommendations on unresolved issues and propose modifications or\nrevisions in the Decree to facilitate compliance with its fundamental purposes.\" Paragraph 58 allows a party to\nask the Monitor \"for a specific action or recommendation,\" and a party objecting to the \"Monitor's response may\nrequest a hearing before the Court.\"\n499 These provisions do not shed much light on the present problem. Paragraphs 55 and *499 56 provide for binding\nrecommendations. But they deal with specific circumstances (such as \"individual\" grievances) which the parties\napparently agree are not present here. And, since they use specific language to make a recommendation binding\nwhere they do apply, they are of little help in deciding how to treat a \"recommendation\" where they do not apply.\nThe last two paragraphs 00 ยถยถ 57 and 58 00 also speak of a Monitor's \"recommendation\" but they do not suggest\n97 97\nthat a \"recommendation\" is binding or that the court has power to make it so.\nSecond, appellees point to several provisions that both deal with issues left open and also seem to foresee the\ncourt's having the power, if necessary, to resolve them. Paragraphs 32 and 33 state that appellant Department\n\"will draft and promulgate regulations, ... governing residential alternatives, nonresidential programs, Individual\nService Plans, and due process procedures for residents moving from the Hospital to a community setting.\" The\nregulations \"will be promulgated,\" they \"will ... be incorporated by reference\" in the decree, and they \"will be\njointly drafted through a negotiation process between the plaintiffs and the Department.\" Similarly, ยถ 35 provides\nthat \"the parties\" (presumably acting together) \"will prepare ... a plan for orientation, retraining, and ongoing\ndevelopment of Hospital staff and employees of community programs ... [which] plan will be incorporated by\nreference in this Decree after review and approval by all parties.\" Paragraph 43 provides that \"[t]he parties ... will\nproduce, through a negotiation process, a reorganization and phase-down plan\" for the Northampton State\nHospital, which plan \"will be included by reference in this Decree.\" Appellees argue that these provisions 00\n97\ndealing with regulations, personnel training, and hospital reorganization 00 do not expressly grant the court\n97\nauthority to resolve the issue; yet, it is reasonable to imply such authority despite silence. Thus, one might imply\nan intent to grant the court authority to resolve other issues 00 indeed all issues left open for future resolution.\n97\nThis argument, however, is weak. If these provisions bestow upon the court the power to impose solutions, they\ndo so in virtue of 1) their rather specific language (the regulations, the training plan, the phase-down plan, all \"will\nbe\" written and incorporated), and 2) the need to resolve these details of \"deinstitutionalization\" (regulations,\npersonnel training, reorganization of the hospital) to achieve the decree's agreed upon, major,\n\"deinstitutionalization\" objective. Yet, it is as to these two key points that the relation of these paragraphs to the\nlegal services paragraph (ยถ 59) breaks down. An inspection of the language of ยถ 59 reveals that it is far less\nspecific in foreseeing a resolution of the issue than are ยถยถ 32, 33, 35 and 43. And, as will be elaborated below,\nthe legal services program at issue in ยถ 59 is not a \"deinstitutionalization\" detail, logically implied by a\ncommitment to the objective. Rather, it constitutes a major, separable program which could in good faith be\nopposed (or favored) by one committed to achieving \"deinstitutionalization.\"\n\nThird, appellees point to ยถ 16, which provides the closest analogy to ยถ 59. It concerns the problem of what to do\nwith the \"remaining\" population at Northampton State Hospital 00 those who appear to need \"a secure treatment\n97\nsetting at an appropriate location.\" It states that, \"[i]f the parties cannot agree on a resolution of\" this issue, \"they\nwill report to the Court.\" This paragraph is very much like ยถ 59, because it does not say what the court can or\ncannot do. The matter is simply to be referred to the court. Moreover, like a general legal services program,\nresolution of issues related to those who cannot be \"deinstitutionalized\" is not obviously essential to the success\nof deinstitutionalization. The problem with pointing to ยถ 16, however, is that ยถ 16 raises exactly the same question\nat issue here. It is no more clear than ยถ 59 that the court is to have the power to resolve differences if the parties\nfail to agree. Nothing in the record before us shows that it gives this power to the court; thus, it is an analogy that\nshows little.\n500 *500 In sum, the \"structural\" argument by analogy to other provisions in the decree fails to show the necessary\ndelegation of power. Those provisions that appear to grant the power at issue in respect of their own particular\nsubject matter (ยถยถ 55, 56, 32, 33, 35, 36, 43) are not similar enough to ยถ 59 to be convincing. The provision that\nseems most similar (ยถ 16) does not clearly delegate the necessary power.\n3. Purpose. The key question is whether the main purpose of the decree 00 deinstitutionalization 00 requires a\n97 97\ngeneral legal services program for the mentally ill or at least requires that the court have the power to create such\na program. If so, one might argue that the parties intended to give the court this power on the principle that he\nwho wills the end must will the means. After examining the record, however, we do not believe the court power\nhere at issue can be implied from the basic purposes of the consent decree.\nAs described in the decree itself, in letters written by appellees' counsel, and in court opinions, the decree's basic\npurpose is \"deinstitutionalization\" 00 that is to say, removing patients from Northampton State Hospital and\n97\nproviding for their care in less restrictive, more normal, surroundings. The aim of the system described in the\ncourt's order, in the Monitor's recommendation, and in the consultant's report, however, is different. It is to provide\nlegal representation on legal issues arising generally out of the \"clients' disability\" as well as their \"prior or current\ninstitutionalization.\" The opinion, recommendations, and report make clear that the relevant range of legal issues\non which representation is sought is vast, encompassing everything from job discrimination to surgical treatment.\nClearly, legal representation and \"deinstitutionalization\" are related; the former can help achieve the latter. But,\nthe relationship between a general legal advocacy program and deinstitutionalization is neither close enough nor\nspecial enough to conclude that parties intending the latter must have intended the former, or must have intended\nto allow the court to order it in the event of disagreement.\nWe reach this conclusion primarily for the reason just stated. The legal services program described summarily in\nthe court's order extends well beyond problems arising out of \"deinstitutionalization;\" it is not a program tailored\nto decree enforcement; it is a program for general representation of the mentally ill; it thus could not constitute a\nnecessary part of the decree's basic deinstitutionalization objective. Moreover, it does not seem inevitable to us\nto infer an intent to resolve definitively the \"legal services\" issue (unlike the \"regulations,\" \"training\" or \"hospital\nreorganization\" issues) from the basic deinstitutionalization commitment. At least one of the parties, the\nCommonwealth, has never believed (given its own \"service coordinators\") that independent legal advocacy is an\nabsolute necessity. It still argues that, even if independent legal advocacy is desirable, as a practical matter funds\nare limited, and whatever money is available is better spent on treatment, or other patient needs. Cf. Brewster v.\nDukakis, supra. Whether or not its arguments are correct, the fact that they are made, and that they are\nreasonable, suggests that the Commonwealth did not intend, and that it need not have intended, that the legal\nservices issue be resolved, as part of its commitment to deinstitutionalization. Thus, even if we interpret the\nlanguage of the decree flexibly \"in light of the need to achieve ... [its] basic purposes,\" Massachusetts Association\nfor Retarded Citizens, Inc. v. King, 668 F.2d 602, 607-08 (1st Cir. 1981), those purposes do not imply a grant by\nthe parties to the court of the power to order the Commonwealth, over its objection, to pay for a general legal\nservices program in Western Massachusetts to represent mentally ill and retarded persons on all issues related\nto their disabilities.\nWe specifically confine our holding to the general legal services program referred to in the district court's order.\nSome of the statements made at oral argument suggest that the order's program might also cover the legal cost\n501 of representing plaintiffs in this and other proceedings directly related *501 to the implementation and\n\nenforcement of the decree. But we are not considering an order that deals specifically with these costs. The order\nbefore us is broader. An order narrowly aimed at legal representation in this case itself would raise quite different\nissues from those argued here, in terms of both expectations and needs. And, by vacating this order, we do not\nintend to prejudge the determination of the lawfulness of a more narrow order aimed at legal representation in\nthis case itself.\n4. Other sources of law. Finally, we do not see how the court's powers can be augmented by references to\n\"general equitable,\" or to other, powers, to cure violations of the Constitution, for the simple reason that there has\nbeen no finding of any such violation. The appellees' legal claims were not adjudicated; the Commonwealth did\nnot concede they were valid; nor has it been persuasively shown that the requisite findings can be inferred from\nthe circumstances. Cf. NAACP v. Beecher, 679 F.2d 965 (1st Cir. 1982); Brown v. Neeb, 644 F.2d at 561-63. See \nYoungberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, ___ n.25, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 2460 n.25, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982) (\"A federal court,\nof course, must identify a constitutional predicate for the imposition of any affirmative duty on a state.\"). Thus, we\ncannot here accept as controlling authority, cases such as Halderman v. Pennhurst State School and Hospital,\n446 F.Supp. 1295, 1325, 1327 (E.D.Pa.1977),aff'd on federal statutory grounds,612 F.2d 84, 113 (3d Cir. 1979),\nrev'd,451 U.S. 1, 101 S.Ct. 1531, 67 L.Ed.2d 694 (1981), where violations of law were found.\nFor these reasons, we vacate the order of the district court and remand for proceedings consistent with this\ndecision.\nVacated and remanded.\n[*] Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

DUKAKIS, ET AL.,\nDefendants, Appellants.\nBefore\nCampbell, Bownes and Breyer,\nCircuit Judges.\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\nEntered November 16, 1981\nThis matter came on to be hear,d upon appellants' motion\nfor stay of preliminary injunction pending appeal.  The stay is\nhereby granted with respect to paragraphs 1-9 only of the injunc-\ntion, and the appeal placed on the January list for argument.\nThe injunction in issue directs defendant officials, pur-\nsuant to a 1978 consent decree, to disregard the budgetary con-\nstraints which they believe (and the district court nowhere denies)\nare necessary if defendants are to live within the means presently\nappropriated by the state legislature for the mental health programs\nhere in question.  In its decision, the district court seemingly\njustifies these commands upon the grounds that (1) the legislature\nis under a legal duty to fund the consent decree, and (2) that the\ncourt is constitutionally empowered to enforce that duty.  In a\ncase such as this, where the existence of a constitutional viola-\ntion has never been adjudicated and where the legislature is\nneither a party nor has agreed to fund the consent decree, we are\ncompelled to entertain serious doubts as to the correctness of the\ndistrict court's premise that the legislature is under any such\nabsolute, judicially enforceable duty.  See New York State Associ-\nation for Retarded Children v. Carey, 631 F.2d 162 (2d Cir. 1980).\nBrewster v. Commw. of Mass.\nโขJ  pj  IPBI  โขHit* โขโขโขโข โขโข  *w\nMH-MA-001-004\n\nMoreover, if these doubts should grove well founded', and the injunc-\ntion should meanwhile remain in full effect, irreparable harm could\nensue not only to defendants, who may be compelled to act in deroga-\ntion of valid state laws, but to the recipients of mental health\nservices, whose programs might altogether cease when existing\nfunding runs out.  We accordingly believe that appellants have made\na sufficient showing of probable success, irreparable harm and a\nclaim upon the public interest, to warrant issuance of a stay at\nthis time pending resolution of the appeal.  Virginia Petroleum\nJobbers Association v. Federal Power Commission, 259 F.2d 921 (D.C.\nCir.  1958).  In reaching this conclusion we take into account the\ndeference properly owed by federal courts to a state's management\nand control over its financial affairs.  Welsh v. Likins, 550 F.2d\n1122, 1131-32 (8th Cir. 1975).  Given the considerable uncertainty\nof the law, the officials of Massachusetts should not be subject to\nthese judicial commands pending final determination of the appeal.\nWe recognize that as the district court did not cite the\nCarey case, supra, it may not have had the issues therein brought\nto its attention.  We also note possible confusion over the extent\nto which the court's order is actually meant to apply to the\nlegislature and to require defendants to violate state budgetary\nrestrictions.  Because of these factors, and because time may be of\nthe essence to secure for the plaintiffs the maximum level of\nassistance to which they are entitled, we provide that prior to our\nJanuary sitting the district court is free to reconsider and to\nmodify its injunction notwithstanding the pendancy of this appeal,\nprovided we are given timely advance notice Of such action which\nmight, of course, moot this appeal.\nWhile this court reserved the right to decide the merits\nfollowing the briefing and argument permitted on the motion for\nstay, we now believe that opportunity for further argument and\nbriefing of the merits should be provided, hence, as noted, the\ncase has been placed on the January list.  If either party wishes\nto file briefs in addition to those already submitted, they may do\nso on or before December 14, 1981.\nSo ordered.\nBy the Court,\nDANA H.

General\n1.  Plaintiffs are all mentally disabled persons who\nwere as of December 15, 1976, are, or may be hospitalized at\nthe Northampton State Hospital.  They bring this action\npursuant to, inter alia, 42 U.S.C. ยง1983, claiming violations\nof their constitutional and statutory rights to be treated in\nappropriate, less restrictive alternatives suitable to their\nneeds.\n2.  This Court has jurisdiction of the subject matter,\npursuant to, inter alia, 28 D.S.C. ยง1343 and 42 D.S.C. ยง1983.\nOn October 27, 1977, this Court certified this matter as a\nclass action.\n3.  Based upon the record and consideration of\nsubmissions filed by all the parties in conjunction with the\ncase, this Decree is entered by the Court and consented to_J>y\nthe parties for the purpose of establishing a comprehensive\nsystem of appropriate, less restrictive treatment, training,\nand support services for each member of the plaintiff class\nwhich will meet, without necessarily defining, federal and\nstate constitutional and statutory standards.\n4.  This Decree, including the attachments hereto\nsubject to the provisions of paragraphs 9 through 11, shall be\nas binding on the defendants' successors, officers, agents,\nemployees, and attorneys as on the defendants themselves.\nDefendants and their successors will take actions necessary to\n- 3 -\n\nsecure full implementation of this Decree, including\ncoordinating with other agencies and officials of the\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts and delegating among themselves\nand their subordinates the appropriate responsibilities.\n5.  In order to address the issues the parties and the\nCourt deem pertinent for final settlement of the case, this\nDecree, including the attachments hereto subject to the\nprovisions of paragraphs 9 through 11, sets forth the\ndefendants' commitments towards the plaintiff class.  This\nDecree includes a final, substantive resolution of most of the\nissues raised by this litigation.  To the extent that current\ninformation renders final, substantive settlement of an issue\nimpracticable, the parties have agreed upon a schedule and\nprocess for collaboration and/or negotiation, supervised by the\nCourt, which the parties believe can lead to a final resolution\nof the issue in a fair and reasonable manner.\n6.  Jurisdiction is retained by the Court until\nfurther order, to enable any party to apply at any time for\nsuch further orders as may be necessary or appropriate for the\ninterpretation, implementation, enforcement, or modification of\nthe terms of this Decree and for supervision and approval of\nthe resolution of issues left for further planning and\nnegotiation.\n- 4 -\n\nB.  Definitions\n7.  As used in this Decree, the following terms shall\nhave the following meanings:\n\"Department\" means the Department of Mental Health of\nMassachusetts.\n\"Commissioner\" means the Commissioner of the\nDepartment of Mental Health.\n\"Region I\" means the geographical area designated in\nSection 3.2 of the Code of Human Services Regulations, Title 4\n- Mental Health and Mental Retardation, in force as of the date\nof this Decree, including the four counties of Franklin,\nHampshire, Berkshire, and Hampden.\n\"Regional Office\" means the principal administcative\noffice for Region I or its successor.\n\"Regional Services Administrator\" means the director\nand chief administrator of Region I or its successor.\n\"Areas\" means the geographical divisions designated in\nSection 3.2 of the Department Regulations, in force as of the\ndate of this Decree.\n\"Area Office\" means the principal administrative\noffice for each of the five Areas, or their successors, in\nReg ion I.\n\"Hospital\" means the Northampton State Hospital,\nNorthampton, Massachusetts.\n\"Resident\" means a member of the class who resides at\nthe Northampton State Hospital or is not otherwise discharged\n- 5 -\n\nfrom the Hospital while residing in another facility or\nenvironment.\n\"Client\" means a member of the plaintiff class who\ndoes not presently reside at the Northampton State Hospital.\n\"The plaintiff class\" means all persons who were, as\nof December 15, 1976, are, or may be hospitalized at the\nNorthampton State Hospital, including those persons on\nindefinite visit or conditional discharge during that period.\n\"Community residence or residential alternative\" means\nany mental health or retardation program providing residential\nservices, other than a state hospital or state school for the\nretarded, including, but not limited to, a supervised residence\nor apartment, transitional residence or apartment, specialized\nresidence or apartment for persons with behavior or physical\nproblems, group home, halfway house, foster home, specialized\nhome care, rest home, nursing home, or any other type of\nenvironment providing care or treatment for mentally disabled\npersons.\n\"Nonresidential program\" means any mental health or\nretardation service provided in other than a residential\nsetting, including, but not limited to, individual needs\nassessment and service planning, case management, counseling\nand psychotherapy, respite care, family therapy, medication\nclinic, crisis intervention, day treatment, day activity,\nprevocational training and sheltered workshop, transitional\n- 6 -\n\nemployment and job placement, supervised recreation, or any\nother type of nonresidential service providing care or\ntreatment for mentally disabled persons.\n\"Individual Service Plan or ISP\" means an\nindividualized written plan describing the individual's\ncapabilities and needs for treatment, training, and support\nservices, including the methods to be utilized and the\nperson(s) responsible for providing such services.\n- 7 -\n\nC.  Principles for Creating and Maintaining Community Programs\n8.  The following principles form the basis for\ncreating and maintaining the comprehensive system of community\nmental health and retardation services suitable to meet the\nneeds of all members of the plaintiff class:\na.  A comprehensive community mental health\nand retardation system consists of three distinct\ncomponents:  (1)  residential environments which are\nthe least restrictive and most normal settings\nappropriate for each resident or client;  (2)\nnonresidential treatment, training, and support\nprograms which are geographically separate from\ncommunity residences and which provide the major daily\nactivity for those clients whose residential\nenvironment does not provide the total treatment\nprogram, as well as for other members of the plaintiff\nclass who live independently in the community; and (3)\nmanagement services to adequately develop, coordinate,\nadminister, monitor, and evaluate this network of\nenvironments and programs.\nb.  Residents and clients are entitled to live in\nthe least restrictive, most normal residential\nalternative and to receive appropriate treatment,\ntraining, and support suited to their individual needs.\nc.  There are approximately 2135 mentally\ndisabled plaintiffs in Region I who have been, since\nthe initiation of the lawsuit, are, or will be\nโ ft -โข\n\nhospitali'zed within any two year period at the\nNorthampton State Hospital.  The lack of appropriate\ntreatment in less restrictive community alternatives\ncan result in their unnecessary institutionalization.\nThese plaintiffs constitute the population to be\nserved by the development of new and the expansion of\nexisting programs and services, as is more fully\ndescribed in Attachme_n_t__A.\nd.  There are approximately 3588 other mentally\ndisabled plaintiffs, as described in Attachment A, who\nare presently receiving community residential and\nnonresidential services, but who may be hospitalized\nif such services are eliminated, reduced or otherwise\ndiluted.  To the extent these existing services remain\nadequate, these clients are not part of the population\nto be served by the development of new programs and\nservices.\ne.  The provision of appropriate treatment,\ntraining, and support services to residents and\nclients will not deprive other persons currently\nreceiving mental health or retardation services from\nthe defendants from continuing to receive such\nservices for as long as they are determined to be\nnecessary, according to professionally accepted\nstandards.\n- 9 -\n\n1\nP\nf.  The determination of client service needs\nwill occur through an individualized screening,\nevaluation, and service planning process, including\nannual reviews of Individual Service Plans.\ng.  The determination of the appropriate\nresidential and nonresidential placement for each\nresident and client will be made so as to guarantee\nthat all persons are placed in the least restrictive\nalternative which will provide them with appropriate\ntreatment, training, and support.\nh.  In light of the profound effects of the long\nterm institutionalization of many of the plaintiffs,\nand the practical problems in making available the\nmost suitable setting, some residents and clients may\nbe placed initially in the more structured\nalternatives; however, they will be provided with the\nnecessary treatment, training, and support to enable\nthem to move, as quickly as possible and in accordance\nwith their capabilities, into less restrictive, more\nopen settings and programs.\ni.  Since the residential models are designed to\nbe the most normal and least restrictive environments\nappropriate for the residents and clients, smaller\napartment units are preferred to larger group homes,\nalthough either may be appropriate depending on the\nparticular circumstances.\n- 10 -\n\nj.  Community residential and nonresidential\nservices will be offered, to the maximum extent\nfeasible and entirely if possible, on a voluntary\nbasis and with due regard for the client's dignity and\npersonal autonomy.\nk.  All residential and nonresidential services\nwill be offered by providers of services on a\nnondiscriminatory basis, without regard to a\nresident's or client's degree of handicap or ability\nto pay, subject to the provisions of G.L. c. 123, SS32\nand 37.\n1.  Community residential alternatives and\nnonresidential programs will be integrated in the\ncommunity and operated in the most normal manner\nappropriate to the needs of their clients.\nm.  Standards^ for all residential alternatives\nand nonresidential program models are necessary to\ninsure the health, welfare, and dignity of all clients\nof such programs.  Licensing procedures are necessary\nto enforce these standards and serve as the primary\nmonitoring device to insure program adequacy.\nn.  An evaluation process is required to assess a\nprogram's quality and effectiveness in meeting the\nneeds of its clients.\n- 11 -\n\no.  Adequate residential and nonresidential\nservices will be provided in appropriate, less\nrestrictive alternatives to all residents and clients\nfor as long as determined necessary to meet their\nindividual needs, according to professionally\nacceptable standards.\nII\n- 12 -\n\nD.  Development of Community Programs\n9.  The community residential alternatives and\nnonresidential programs, set forth in Attachments B and C\nrespectively, represent appropriate program models designed to\nmeet the needs of all residents and clients.  These models are\nbased on current information and experience and may be\nmodified, to the extent that new knowledge discloses more\nappropriate alternatives, provided that the plaintiffs'\nattorneys are given notice and an opportunity to object\nreasonably in advance of any budgetary or programmatic action\nto implement any modification.\n10.  The number of residential and nonresidential\nplacements in each program model, set forth in Attachments D\nand E respectively, represent the number of placements which\nthe parties deem appropriate to .meet the needs of all residents\nand clients.  The number of placements in each program model\nwhich will be created may be modified to the extent necessary\nto meet the individual needs of all residents and clients as\ndetermined by their Individual Service Plans.\n11.  The parties recognize that administrative and\nmanagement services are necessary and appropriate to develop,\ncoordinate, manage, monitor, and evaluate the diverse system of\ncommunity programs.  A proposed design for such administrative\nand management services is set forth in Attachment F.  This\ndesign is subject to further review and modification by J:he\n- 13 -\n\ndefendants' normal budgetary and programmatic processes,\nprovided that plaintiffs are informed of and allowed to\nparticipate in and have the opportunity to object to any\nbudgetary or programmatic decision.  The design set forth in\nAttachment F does not imply any conclusion as to whether the\nproposed positions are to be newly created or reallocated from\nthe Hospital.  Such management services insure that all\nresidents and clients receive appropriate treatment, training,\nand support in the least restrictive alternative suitable to\ntheir individual needs.\n12.  The defendants will create and maintain\nappropriate community residential alternatives and\nnonresidential programs, including necessary management\nservices, for all members of the plaintiff class adequate to\nmeet their individual needs as recommended  in their Individual\nService Plans.\n13.  The defendants will create and fund appropriate\ncommunity  residential alternatives and nonresidential programs\nand will maintain and continue to fund all new and existing\nprograms unless the needs of the residents and clients, as\ndetermined by their Individual Service Plans, no longer require\nsuch programs.\n14.  The defendants will not place residents or\nclients in residential alternatives or nonresidential programs\nwhich fail to meet the environmental, care, and programming\nstandards included in this Decree and the attachments hereto,\nsubject to the provisions of paragraphs 9 through 11.\n- 14 -\n\n15.  With respect to residents at the Northampton\nState Hospital, the defendants will create and maintain\nresidential and nonresidential programs which will reduce the\ncensus of the Hospital to 250 residents by June 30, 1979, to\n150 residents by June 30, 1980, and to no more than 50\nresidents by June 30, 1981.  As to this remaining population,\nthe defendants will, by June 30, 1931, create and maintain\nappropriate community residential and non residential programs\nsuitable to the individual needs of those residents for__whom\nthe community program models set forth in Attachments B-E are\nappropriate, and will place those residents in such\n^alternatives.\n/\"  16.  To the extent that the community program models\nset forth in Attachments B-E do not adequately meet the needs\n\\of a portion of this remaining population, the defendants\nagree, during the formulation of the budget for fiscal year\n1981, to seek a resolution of outstanding issues relevant to\nthe need for a secure treatment setting at an appropriate\nlocation.  If the parties cannot agree on a resolution of these\nissues, they will report to the Court by November 15, 1979.\n17.  The  defendants will use their best efforts to\n;\ninsure the development of an inpatient capacity of additional\nacute psychiatric beds in community general hospitals in Region\nI, as deemed necessary to meet the needs of members of the\nplaintiff class described in Attachments C, D and E.  To the\nextent that factors outside the defendants' control inhibit or\n- 15 -\n\nprevent the creation of this inpatient capacity in community\nhospitals, the parties recognize the need to modify the\nprojected number, type, and timing of community  residential\nalternatives necessary to meet the needs of these members of\nthe plaintiff class.\n18.  The defendants will take all necessary action to\nmaximize the reallocation of funds from the Hospital to the\ncommunity.  Reallocation will proceed so that by June 30, 1981,\nthe unit cost will not exceed $40,000 per resident at the\nHospital.\n19.  With respect to clients who have been or may be\ninstitutionalized at the Hospital and who are presently\nreceiving some but not all of the residential and\n, .!\nM\nnonresidential services appropriate to their needs, the\nIN defendants will upgrade existing community programs- and create\nnew programs and services to meet their individual!needs.  The\ndefendants agree that sixty percent of the deficiency in\nexisting services, as described in Attchment G, will be\neliminated by June 30, 1980, and the remainder will be\neliminated by June 30, 1981.\n20.  By June 30, 1979 the defendants will place forty\nmentally retarded residents currently at the Hospital in\nappropriate, less restrictive residential alternatives and\nprovide them with treatment, training, and support services\nโขjx*\"\nsuitable to their individual needs.  The projected cost of\nthese placements for six months is $412,000, of which $260,000\n-16 -\n\nwill be allocated from the Comnonwealth's 5C22-0100 account and\nthe remaining $152,000 will be reallocated from the Hospital\nbudget for the 1979 fiscal year.\n21.  By June 30, 198C the defendants will place all\nremaining mentally retarded residents at the Hospital in\nappropriate, less restrictive residential alternatives and\nprovide them with treatment, training, and support services\nsuitable to their individual needs.\n22.  The defendants will insure that Department\npersonnel experienced in mental retardation will assume\npredischarge planning and community placement responsibility\nfor all mentally retarded residents and clients in order that\nthere is no distinction in Department aftercare\nresponsibilities for any mentally retarded client based on\nprior residency in the Northampton State Hospital as opposed to\nstate schools for the retarded.  All mentally retarded clients\nwill be considered within the scope, and will receive the\nprotections of, all mental retardation regulations, standards,\nand procedures.\n23.  The defendants will make their best^efforts to\ninsure that residents and clients of community residential\nalternatives and nonresidential programs are provided equal\naccess to all generic services, such as education,\ntransportation, recreation, and medical care, and will develop\nappropriate links between the community mental health delivery\nsystem and such services.\n- 17 -\n\n24.  The defendants will use their best efforts to\novercome all obstacles and barriers to the creation of\ncoamunity residential and nonresidential programs, as required\nby this Decree, including, but not limited to, the actions set\nforth in Attachment H.\n25.  As soon as it is practicable and to the extent\nnot inconsistent with existing contracts, the defendants will\nreach a written agreement with the operator of the community\nresidence or nonresidential program to include the following:\na.  require the residence or program to comply\nwith the applicable terms of this Decree and with all\napplicable statutes, rules, and regulations\npromulgated by the United States, the Commonwealth of\nMassachusetts, and the Department;\nb.  reserve the right of employees and\ncontractees of the Department to have reasonable\nโข\naccess to the residence or program and to audit its\nrecords, to supervise services to its clients, and to\noperate, or make appropriate provision for the\noperation of, the residence until clients are\nappropriately placed elsewhere in the event the\nprovider substantially fails to fulfill the terms of\nits contract;\nc.  specify all charges and the sources of\npayment of a client's program, room and board, and any\nother expenses;\n- 18 -\n\nd.  require the participation of the residence or\nprogram director, or appropriate representative, in\nthe Individual Service Plan process for each of their\nclients;\ne.  require substantial fulfillment of the\napplicable portions of each client's Individual\nService Plan.\nSanctions foe failure to comply with the provisions of the\nagreement will be included in the agreement and will include,\nbut will not be limited to, the termination of the agreement\nand the removal of the client from the placement.  Prior to the\nrenewal of an agreement, the defendants will monitor the\nservice provider's compliance with the terms of the agreement.\n- 19 -\n\nE.  Individual Service Plan\n26.  The defendants will furnish or continue to\nfurnish all residents and clients with a written Individual\nService Plan which specifies in detail the individual's\ncapabilities and needs for services, including the methods to\nbe utilized to provide such services.  The Individual Service\nPlan will address the individual's residential and\nnonresidential program needs, with particular emphasis on the\ndetermination of the least restrictive residential environment\nand suitable nonresidential treatment, training, and support\nservices appropriate to meet those needs.  Such residential\nalternatives and nonresidential services will include, but not\nbe limited to, those programs set forth in Attachments B and\nC.  The Individual Service Plan will describe short-term and\nlong-term program goals and timetables for the attainment of\nthese goals.  The Individual Service Plan will identify by name\nthe person or persons who are primarily responsible for\nimplementing, and overseeing  implementation of, service goals.\n27.  The Individual Service Plan will be developed\nunder the direction of a qualified professional and will be\nreviewed at least annually by an interdisciplinary  team which\nis appropriately constituted in accordance with professionally\nacceptable standards and which includes the person or persons\nprimarily responsible for the daily care and support of the\nresident or client, as well as the community service\ncoordinator responsible for the client.  Each resident or\n- 20 -\n_J\n\nclient, and the individual's guardian, advocate or other\nrepresentative will be notified of and invited to participate\nin the interdisciplinary  team meeting, unless the resident or\nclient objects to such attendance.  Notification of team\nmeetings will be provided as far in advance as practicable, and\nin no event less than two weeks prior to the meeting.  As of\nSeptember 1, 1979, a resident or client, either individually or\nwith the assistance of a representative, may challenge the\nIndividual Service Plan pursuant to procedures to be agreed\nupon by the parties by June 1, 1979, which will be\nsubstantially similar to those to be promulgated .le Department\nregulations.\n28.  The resident's or client's community service\ncoordinator will be responsible for reviewing andLsupervising\nthe client's progress, for ascertaining that appropriate\nservices are being delivered, and for coordinationthe  input of\nother professionals and staff in the Individual Service Plan\nprocess.\n29.  Recommendations as to residential and\nnonresidential program placements will be based on an\nevaluation of the actual needs of the resident or client rather\nthan on what programs are currently available.  In cases where\nthe services needed by a client are unavailable, the Individual\nService Plan will recommend an interim program based on\navailable services which meet, as nearly as possible, the\nactual needs of the client.  The number of clients in need of a\nservice or program which is not currently available and the\n- 21 -\n\ntype of residential alternatives or nonresidential programs\nwhich they need will be compiled  in order to plan for the\nfurther development of programs.\n30.  For all residents who do not presently have an\nIndividual Service Plan in conformity with the provisions of\nparagraph 26 of this Decree, an ISP will be developed by\nJanuary 1, 1980.\n31.  A uniform system of records will be established\nby the Department for Area offices and residential and\nnonresidential programs to the extent necessary to insure the\nproper delivery of services and in accordance with Department\nregulations.  A complete copy of the resident's or client's\nrecord will be kept at a single, appropriate location and\nupdated regularly.\n- 22 -\n\np.  Standards\n32.  In order- to protect the legal and civil rights of\nall residents and clients, including their rights to personal\ndignity/^individual autonomy, adequate treatment, and freedom\nfrom abuse, the Department will draft and promulgate\nregulations, to be incorporated by reference in this Decree,\ngoverning residential alternatives, nonresidential programs,\nIndividual Service Flans, and due process procedures for\nresidents moving from the Hospital to a community setting.\nThese regulations will substantially parallel similar\nregulations promulgated or drafted by the Department of Mental\nHealth for mentally retarded persons and will be promulgated\npursuant to the following schedule, unless an extension is\nagreed upon by the parties:\na.  Community residential regulations'by Juno 1,\n1979;\nb.  Nonresidential program regulations, including\nprovisions for all relevant program models.described\nin Attachment C, by March 1, 1980; and\nc.  Individual Service Plan and Due\nProcess regulations by April 1, 1980.\n33.  The Department will include the plaintiffs in\nreviewing and revising drafts of these regulations and all\nother standards affecting clients1 rights and the quality of\nlife in community programs.  If the standards  as promulgated\ndiffer substantially from those regulations applicable to\nmentally retarded persons, separate standards for community\n- 23 -\n\nresidential and nonresidential programs serving Members of the\nplaintiff class will be jointly drafted through a negotiation\nprocess between the plaintiffs and the Department and subsequent1\nincluded in this Decree.\ni\n- 24 -\n\nG.  Personnel and Training\n34.  The defendants will either directly or indirectly\nrecruit qualified personnel to staff community  residential\nalternatives and nonresidential programs.  Such recruitment\nefforts\" and hiring practices will be designed to insure that\npersonnel working in community programs are sensitive to\nclients' needs and their right to be treated in the least\nrestrictive, most normal setting possible.  Every effort will\nbe made to screen out those applicants for employment who might\npose a danger to clients or who fail to work in their best\ninterests.\n35.  The defendants wili provide all new employees\nwith appropriate orientation and training programs to increase\ntheir skills and interest in achieving service goals for\nclients.  The defendants agree-to provide staff persons\nemployed in new residential and nonresidential programs with\ntraining appropriate to their tasks as set forth in Attachments\nB and C.  Those (Hospital employees^; for whom employment in\ncommunity settings is both desired and suitable will be offered\nretraining to permit them to serve appropriately the needs of\nclients in these community programs.  The parties will prepare\nby October 1, 1979, a plan for orientation, retraining, and\nongoing development of Hospital staff and employees of\nโ  โ  โ\n\\\ncommunity programs.  This plan will be incorporated Jby_\nreference in this Decree after review_and_appr_ova 1 by all  v\nparties\n- 25 -\n\n36.  Personnel policies will he designed to maximize\nuse of individual employee skills and to enhance effective\nservices for clients and working conditions for employees.\nPersonnel policies will include provisions, consistent with\nstate law, for suspending or terminating employees whose job\nperformance is determined, after appropriate review, to be\nsubstantially unsatisfactory or to violate the rights of\nclients as set forth in relevant statutes, regulations or the\nprovisions of this Decree.\n37.  The defendants agree to use their best efforts to\nsecure federal funds, through Title XX of the Social Security\nAct, 42 U.S.C. S1397a{2) (A), and other -sources, .tec train and\nretrain individuals working in community programs.  To the\nextent federal funds are inadequate for this purpose, the\ndefendants agree to provide by other means or tar^eek adequate\nfunding for training personnel.\nj '!\n- 26 -\n\nH.  Monitoring and Evaluation\n38.  The defendants will, through the Department's\nArea and Regional offices, monitor compliance with contract\nrequirements and the provisions of this Decree by local\nvendors, agencies, and other providers of service to residents\nand clients.  To fulfill this responsibility, the defendants\nwill use the licensing procedures for residential and\nnonresidential programs included in the Department regulations\ndescribed in paragraph 32.\n39.  The defendants will, thiough program standards\nand evaluation mechanisms to be established by the Department,\nseek to insure that residential alternatives and nonresidential\nprograms provide appropriate services which provide a high\nquality of life for their clients and which are effective in\npromoting their clients' early movement to less restrictive,\nmore independent living environments.\n40.  The defendants will develop and maintain a\nmanagement information system to better understand clients' use\nof residential and nonresidential programs and to generate data\nfor planning and evaluation purposes.\n- 27 -\n\nI.  Hospital and Placement Procedures\n41.  The defendants will make all reasonable efforts\nto substantially reduce new admissions to the Hospital through\nthe creation of residential alternatives and nonresidential\nprograms designed to prevent the unnecessary hospitalization of\nclients.  No mentally retarded client will be admitted to the\nHospital except upon criteria developed by and with the express\napproval of the Regional Services Administrator.  No resident\nwill be transferred to another state hospital or school unless\nand until the Regional Services Administrator or the\nCommissioner determines that such transfer will offer the\nresident more appropriate services and a more suitable, less\nrestrictive environment than the Hospital.\n42.  The defendants will provide all residents of the\nHospital with appropriate planning and preparation for\ndischarge from the Hospital through the Individual Service Plan\nprocess.  The Department will seek to insure, through the\nassignment of a community service coordinator to each resident,\nappropriate links between Hospital based and community services\n43.  The parties will review all issues relevant to\nthe phasing down of the Hospital, including administrative,\npersonnel, programmatic, and fiscal considerations, and will\nproduce, through a negotiation process, a reorganization and\nphase-down plan by November 15, l?2i_wni<?h_J?.irAL. be_ini*Il1<led_ ?y\nreference in this Decree.  The.plan will include specific\ntimetables for reallocation of Hospital funds and may include a\n- 28 -\n\nproposal for the use of the Hospital grounds and buildings,\nwhich plan shall keep at an absolute minimum maintenance costs\nfor the Hospital grounds and buildincs net used by residents.\nThe plan will be designed to insure that no resident is\nprovided with less treatment or a more restrictive environment\nduring this transition period than presently exists at the\nHospital.\n44.  The procedures for the reallocation of Hospital\nfunds, which will be set forth in detail in the reorganization\nplan, will be done in such a manner as to insure a\nstaff-patient ratio appropriate to meet the basic needs of the\nresidents.  No funds will be reallocated from existing\ncommunity programs serving members of the plaintiff class,\nexcept to the extent that the parties agree that such programs\njare inappropriate to or inefficient in meeting the needs of\n(their clients.\n45.  After a placement in an appropriate residential\nalternative and/or nonresidential program has been located, the\nArea Director will inform the resident or client of the\nproposed placement.  Notification will also be given to the\nplaintiffs' attorneys, pursuant to an agreement between the\nparties set forth in Attachment I.  If the resident or client\nfinds acceptable and consents to the proposed placement, it\nwill be accomplished without undue delay.  If the resident or\nclient rejects the proposed placement, the Department will make\nan effort to locate an alternative residential and/or\n- 29 -\n\nnonresidential program more suitable to the wishes of the\nresident or client and appropriate to his/her needs.  The\nDepartment will draft, in consultation with the plaintiffs,\ndetailed regulations governing placement and transfer\nprocedures and will issue such regulations, pursuant to\nparagraph 32 (c).\n46.  The resident or client may at any time initiate a\nrequest for transfer to a more appropriate, less restrictive\nsetting.  The Area director will respond within 30 days, either\naccepting or rejecting the request and stating the reasons for\nany rejection.  A request for such a transfer will be rejected\nonly because continuation in the current residence offers the\nindividual a better opportunity for personal development in a\nmore suitable, less restrictive environment, because of\nstatutory restrictions on the resident's os; client's freedom of\nmovement, or because a placement is not currently available\nelsewhere.  In this third situation the resident or client will\nbe transferred as soon as an appropriate placement can be found\nor developed.\n- 30 -\n\nJ.  Implementation and Monitoring\n47.  The defendants will use their best efforts to\ninsure the full and timely financing of this Decree,\nincluding:  submission of appropriate budget requests to the\nMassachusetts General Court; allocation of sufficient funds to\n\"insure that all existing and new programs meet the minimum\nstandards herein; full allocation of funds appropriated for\nservices during the fiscal year; allotments of appropriated\nfunds as needed; prompt release of scheduled positions and\nprocessing of conversion and transfer requests; use of an\nappropriate voucher system by the comptroller's office to\ninsure the prompt availability of necessary funds; use of a\ntimely payment system to insure adequate cash flow to providers\nof services, so long as the providers have in place an auditing\nsystem and comply with.reasonable auditing procedures to be\nestablished by the defendants which do not restrict the\nappropriate provision of services to clients.  In order to\nfinance the obligations of this Decree, the defendants agree\nnot to transfer funds among accounts in such a way as to reduce\nthe level of services presently being provided to mentally\ndisabled persons at the Hospital or elsewhere in Region I of\nthe Department of Mental Health.\n48.  The defendants will include in every future\ncontract requiring an agent or independent contractor to\nperform duties, standards, and procedures which would otherwise\n- 31 -\n\nbe performed by the defendants or their employees, a clause\nrequiring the agent or contractor to meet the relevant\nobligations of this Decree and the attachments hereto.\n49.  The parties agree that Regional and Area\nadministrative personnel should have reasonable flexibility to\nimplement residential and nonresidential programs.\n50.  The defendants agree to take all necessary action\n! to insure full and timely compliance with the provisions of\nthis Decree.  The parties recognize that there may arise,\nduring the implementation of this Decree, difficulties beyond\nthe control of the defendants which may inhibit timely\naccomplishment of certain of its terms.  Whenever the parties\nor the Monitor determine that such difficulties have arisen and\nsignificantly threaten implementation, the problem may be\nbrought to the Court.for its attention.\n51.  By January 1, 1979, an independent Monitor will\nbe appointed by the Court from a list of proposed candidates\njointly prepared by-the plaintiffs and defendants.  The Monitor\nwill be responsible solely to the Court and will serve the\nCourt and the interests of justice for as long as necessary.\nThe Monitor will review and report to the Court and the parties\nI  i li! on the progress towards implementation of this Decree, in\naccordance with procedures and schedules to be agreed upon by\nthe parties.  The Monitor's first term of appointment will be\nfor eighteen months., which may be extended by agreement of the\nparties and the Court.  The parties' attorneys will consult\n- 32 -\n\nwith each other prior to the reappointment or replacement of\nthe Monitor, and exchange proposals regarding the Monitor's\nposition at least three we~ks prior to submittal to the Court\nfor approval.  The defendants will pay the salary and expenses\nof the Monitor and will provide necessary clerical support.\nThe defendants will pay the costs and expenses of those\nconsultants which the Monitor finds necessary to fulfill its\nresponsibilities as set forth in this Decree, provided that\neither the parties agree or the Court, after a hearing, finds\nthat such consultation is appropriate.\n52.  The Monitor will be allowed access to all\ninformation, records, residential environments, and program\nareas, and will be permitted to interview any person affected\nby or involved in the implementation of this Decree to the\nextent necessary to discharge .the Monitor's duties under this\nDecree.\n53.  The Monitor will evaluate residential,\nnonresidential, and management services in the community,\nincluding their costs and effectiveness, as well as services at\nthe Northampton State Hospital which relate to placement in\ncommunity programs, pursuant to the standards set forth in this\nDecree and the attachments hereto.\n54.  The Monitor may make informal suggestions to the\ndefendants in whatever form the Monitor deems appropriate in\norder to facilitate compliance with the Decree.\n- 33 -\n'*<โข  โข\n\n55.  If an individual complaint or problem is not or\ncannot be resolved through existing procedures of the\nDepartment, any employee or agent of the defendants, any\nresident or client, or any guardian, advocate, or other\nrepresentative of a resident or client, may bring a situation\nor disagreement related to the provisions of this Decree to the\nattention of the Monitor for appropriate action.  The Monitor\nwill provide written notice of such matter to the parties1\nattorneys.  The Monitor may make a recommendation to the\ndefendants to promptly address or resolve such problem.  The\nMonitor's action on individual complaints or problems will be\nconsidered final, and inappropriate for review by this Court,\nexcept to the extent provided in paragraph 61.\n56.  The Monitor will have the authority to make\nrecommendations with: regard to implementation of the Decree\nif:  (1) the Monitor believes that the defendants are not in\ncompliance with the .Decree; (2) this judgment is accompanied by\nwritten findings of fact which indicate the source of the\nevidence upon which each finding is based; and  (3) the\nrecommendations are consistent with and can be implemented\nwithin the framework of the Decree.  Such recommendations will\ninclude, where necessary, timetables for implementation of\nsteps or measures necessary to bring the defendants into\ncompliance.\na.  Copies of each recommendation accompanied by\nthe findings of fact required by this paragraph will\n- 34 -\n\nbe filed with the Court and sent to counsel for the\nparties.  All parties shall be bound by the\nrecommendation unless, within fifteen business days,\nany party files an objection with the Court and\nrequests a hearing.  Objections may be made on the\nbasis that (1) the findings of fact relied upon by the\nMonitor are erroneous, (2) the Monitor's judgment of\nnoncompliance is erroneous, or  (3) the Monitor's\nrecommendations are beyond the provisions of or\ninconsistent with the Decree.\nb.  The hearing on the objections will be held at\nthe earliest convenient time after notice to all\nparties.\n57.  The Monitor will submit written reports to the\nCourt and the parties every six months: on li<ยซ progress achieved\nin complying with the provisions of this Decree, including a\ndescription of all problems and disputes which have arisen and\nsuggestions for appropriate action to- remedy such problems.\nThe reports will also make recommendations on unresolved issues\nand propose modifications or revisions in the Decree to\nfacilitate compliance with its fundamental purposes.  Before\nfiling its report the Monitor will submit a draft thereof to\nthe parties for comment.  The Monitor may submit special\nreports to the Court and the parties at any time.\n58.  Any party may submit a written request to the\nMonitor for a specific action or recommendation.  A copy of\nsuch request will be filed with the Court and served upon the\nparties' attorneys.  The Monitor will prepare and file a\n- 35 -\n\nresponse with the Court in 30 days, a copy of which will be\nsent to all parties.  Any party objecting to the Monitor's\nresponse may request a hearing before the Court.\n59.  The Monitor will investigate and determine the\nnecessity for trained. independent advocate^ to assist clients\nin the protection of their rights as set forth in relevant\nstatutes, regulations, and the provisions of this Decree,\nincluding the attachments hereto.  The Monitor will submit its\nrecommendation to the parties and the Court by January 1, 1980,\non the appropriate role of and funding for such independent\nadvocacy.  The plaintiffs and defendants agree to cooperate in\ninvestigating sources of funding and in seeking federal funds\nto establish and maintain an advocacy system, to the extent\nsuch is determined to be appropriate.\n60.  The plaintiffs and the defendants will cooperate,\nwith the Monitor in his/her efforts to facilitate compliance\nwith this Decree.  For this purpose, the Governor's office, the\nSecretary of Administration and Finance, the Executive Office\nof Human Services, the Department of Public Health, and the\nDepartment of Mental Health will designate staff persons\nresponsible for coordinating implementation of this Decree and\nwill furnish the names of such persons to the Court, the\nMonitor, and the plaintiffs' attorneys.\n61.  Plaintiffs' counsel may apply to the Court for\nappropriate relief on matters of significant concern to the\nclass.  Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent a resident\n- 36 -\n\nor client or his/her legal representative from bringing an\nindependent enforcement action in the event that the\nindividual's grievances have not been remedied through the\nprocedures specified in this Decree or other procedures\nexisting within the Department.\n62.  Defendants will post in each building at the\nHorthampton State Hospital, and will either post in or send to\neach community program where members of the plaintiff class\nreceive services, a notice that the Court has issued a judgment\nsetting forth standards and procedures to be applicable to all\nthe plaintiffs.  The defendants will insure that a copy of that\njudgment is available for inspection at Area and Regional\noffices of the Department of Mental Health during regular\nbusiness hours by employees and agents of defendants, vendors\nand service providers, residents, clients and--theit parents,\nrelatives, and legal guardians, and all other interested\nmembers of the public.  Defendants are committed to providing\ncopies of this Decree to all providers of mental health\nservices in Region I.

Introduction\nIn order to plan a system of community treatment programs\nand residences for mentally disabled persons, it is necessary to\nidentify the population within the parameters of the planning\nprocess and then to subdivide this population into relatively\nhomogeneous groups or clusters according to individual character-\nistics and corresponding mental health needs.  The total population,\ndefined as all persons who have been, are now, or will be hospital-\nized in the Northampton State Hospital (the Hospital), can be\nviewed as composed of five distinct subpopulations:  (1)  Acute\npatients admitted for the first time and who remain in the Hospital\nfor a brief period; (2) Recidivist patients who have been admitted\nmore than once and who remain in the Hospital for varying lengths i\nof time; (3^ Long-term patients who have been hospitalized for\nmore than three months and usually for more than a year; (4)  Non-\nacute patients who were hospitalized on or after December 15, 1976,\nwho have been discharged as of a given planning date, and who\nare not likely to return to the Hospital; and (5)  Persons never\nadmitted to the Hospital but at substantial risk of being hos-\npitalized unless alternative services are available.  For planning\npurposes, the grouping of each of these subpopulations was\n(41)\n\nundertaken on the basis of the Final Draft of the Index Con-\nstruction jointly prepared by the plaintiffs and defendants.\nThis document identifies the number of persons in each subpopu-\nlation and analyzes that subpopulation according to relevant\nclusters.  The data set forth within will form the basis for\ndetermining the appropriate number and type of community pro-\ngrams and residences necessary to meet the needs of the mentally\ndisabled population subject to this planning process.\nII. Methodology for Identifying Subpopulations\nAlthough no formula or statistical design has been created\nto precisely identify the number of persons who have been or\nmay be hospitalized, there is remarkable similarity in the\nresults produced by several different approaches that have been\ndevised after an exhaustive review of hospital data and results\nof the assessment survey.  It is recognized that all of these\napproaches attempt essentially to approximate a dynamic model\nof client \"flow\" into and out of the hospital, without actually\nrelying upon a dynamicโsimulation methodology.  The development\nof a fully dynamic model of patient flow would have required the\nretrieval of a substantial amount of additional data, and require'\nconsiderable delays in the planning process.  As noted, the dis-\ntinctive methodologies employed here do show a remarkable con-\nvergence, results of which are described below:\ni I\n(42)\n\nA.  Acute Subpopulation - 525\nThere are an average of more than five hundred and twenty-\nfive new admissions to the Hospital each year who have never\nbeen previously admitted to a mental hospital.  Alternatively,\na total of 32 persons in the Hospital on September 17, 1977\nwere identified on the assessment survey as either acute or\nadolescent with not more than one previous admission, and\nt\nV hospitalized for less than three months.  Similarly, there\nwere 29 persons with no previous admissions.  Given the\naverage length of stay at the Hospital for this subpopulation\nof approximately 20 days, these persons represent an acute\npopulation of approximately 550 (29 x 18 - 532; 32 x 18 - 576)\nB.  Recidivist Subpopulation - 1076\nIn order to determine the unduplicated count of persons\nadmitted to the Hospital over a two year period who had pre-\nviously been hospitalized, an extensive review of Hospital\nrecords was undertaken.  This review included examining the\nadmission history of every person admitted during the six\nmonth period from October 1, 1977 - March 31, 1978.  This\nindividual analysis allows for an exact determination of the\nnumber and frequency of persons entering the Hospital in a\ngiven time period, in addition to precisely identifying who\nthose persons are and the source of their referral.\nOn the basis of this data (see especially Appendix C,\nTables 1 to 3), a total of 1300 annual admissions to the\n(43)\n\nHospital were identified, 736 of which were readmissions.\nWhen this figure was adjusted for repeated readmissions of\nthe same client, there were 680 unduplicated individuals\nidentified for a single year.  In order to determine for\na 2 year planning period how many unduplicated recidivist\nclients would re-enter the Hospital, a number of data-\nbased assumptions were made (see Appendix C, Table 4).\nBasically, four'separate recidivist subgroups were identified:\nGroup A:  Consisting of 46 persons, each of whom are\nreadmitted two to three times each year, and\n4 to 6 times over a two year planning period;\nGroup B:  Consisting of 318 persons, each of whom are\nreadmitted once each year, and twice over a\ntwo year planning period;\nGroup C:  Consisting of 121 persons, each of whom are\nreadmitted about every 18 months, 80_ of whom\ncould be expected to show up within a single\nyear, and all of whom could be expected to\nii\nshow up at least once during the two year\nplanning period, and;\nGroup D:  Consisting of 590 persons, each of whom are\nreadmitted about every 30 months, 236 of\nwhom could be expected to show up within a\nsingle year, and 472 of whom could be expected\n(44)\n\nto show up at least once during the two year\nplanning period.\nThus, for a one year planning period we would expect 680\nunduplicated clients  (46 +318 + 80 + 236) in the\nrecidivist subpopulation.  For a two year planning period\nthere would be 957 unduplicated recidivist clients (46 + 318 +\n121 + 472*) admitted to the Hospital.\nIn addition to this total, there are 119 other clients\nreleased form the Hospital on an indefinite visit status,\nwho returned to the Hospital one or more times during the\nyear (See Appendix C, Table 3).  Although pursuant to\nDepartment procedures these persons are not formally re-\nadmitted, they clearly must be considered as part of the\nrecidivist subpopulation for planning purposes.  Thus this\nmethodology suggests the total unduplicated recidivist\nsubpopulation that will be admitted to the Hospital in a\ntwo year period is 1076 persons (957 + 119).\nC.  Long-Term Subpopulation - 362\nA total of 362 persons at the Hospital on September 17,\n1977 had been there longer than three months.  Of this\ngroup more than three hundred had been hospitalized for\nmore than a year.\n*While Group D (the infrequent readmit group) consists of an\nestimated 590 individuals at risk of readmission, only 472 could\nbe expected to show up during the two year planning period.\n(45)\n\nD.  Nursing Home Discharged Subpopulation - 172\nAs of June 30, 1977 there were 178 persons on convalescen\nleave status.  These people, although not residing in the\nHospital, are still considered clients of the Department.\nAlternatively a total of 172 persons were discharged from the\nHospital to either a nursing home, rest home, or boarding\nhome during FY 1977.  Given the exceedingly low readmission\ni 1\nrate from nursing and rest homes, there is little likelihood\nthis subpopulation is included in the recidivist subpopula-\ntion above.  Finally, 1980 former Hospital patients were\ndischarged to nursing or rest homes between 1969 and 1977; of\nthis number 1240 left between 1969 and 1974.  Thus in years\n1975 to 1977, slightly more than 200 persons per year were\ndischarged to these type of facilities, with only a slight\nrisk of their returning to the Hospital (1980 --1240).\nE.  At Risk Subpopulation - 3588\nBased on an October 1977 Department inventory of all\ncommunity facilities in Region I, there are 3588 persons\npresently being served that were identified as being at\nrisk of hospitalization in the absence of these programs.\n'. t\nAlthough it is difficult to determine with precision the\nsize of this group, it is clear that existing community\nmental health services presently being used by this subpopu-\nlation should be maintained at their current levels and not\nbe considered available to other persons not presently\n(46)\n\nreceiving such services.  Any decrease or dilution of these\nservices for this subpopulation would create a substantial\nrisk that members of this group would be hospitalized.\nHowever, Department staff should retain the discretion to\ndecide whether a given program is operating below capacity\nand is therefore able to serve additional clients without\ndecreasing existing services to, or creating a risk of\nhospitalization for, this subpopulation.  Given these\n'โข4\nprogrammatic principles, the calculation of this subpopula-\ntion represents the best available figure and is supported\nby recently collected information in the Region.\nCombining these subpopulations, the community mental health system\nshould be designed to serve 2135 persons through a variety of\nprograms and residences.  While some portion of this, population,\nparticularly the long-term and discharged subpopulation (C and D),\nmay require continuous residential services and programming, a\nsubstantial percent of this group, especially the acute sub-\npopulation (A) , will require intensive services for only limited\ntime.  Moreover, the subpopulation of persons never hospitalized\nbut at risk of institutionalization (E) should be considered to\nbe receiving appropriate services at the present time, provided\nnone of these services are reduced or otherwise altered.  By\ngrouping each subpopulation into homogeneous clusters, it is\npossible to determine the number of persons needing each type\nof program or residence.\nClustering of Subpopulations\nUsing the Final Revision of the Index Construction, a total\nof 47 clusters were created.  The assessment survey of all\n(47)\n\npersons in the Hospital on September 17, 1977 generated data\nindicating that much of the resident population fell within a'\nrelatively small number of clusters.  Almost half of the cluj\nters were void.  The frequency distribution of all the clust<\nfor that population, which includes the entire long-term sub-'\npopulation and a portion (approximately 1/12) of the acute at\nrecidivist subpopulations is attached as Appendix A followed\na summary list of all the clusters that were not void (Appenc\nB).\nEach relevant cluster was then cross-tabulated with the\nnumber of prior admissions and length of stay in the Hopsital\norder to determine which clusters related to the acute, recic\nand long-term subpopulations.  Appendix D sets forth the re-\nsults of that cross tabulation, including the percentage of\neach subpopulation in each cluster.  That table also describe*]\nthe percentage of each cluster that, on the basis of clinical\nand practical experience, would be expected to fall within eac\nsubpopulation.  Thus, although three persons in poor health\nwere admitted for the first time and were at the Hospital\nless than three months, thereby falling in the acute subpopu-\nlation, it is highly likely that they will remain at the Hospi\nindefinitely and thereby soon become part of the long-term\nI โข\nsubpopulation.  Appendix E sets forth the results of the crosJ\ntabulation adjusted for these clinical considerations, includ-J\ning the percentage of each adjusted subpopulation in each\n(48)\n\ncluster.  It should be noted that the adjustments were only\nmade in obvious cases and technically resulted in an insignifi-\ncant net change in each subpopulation.\nOn the basis of this adjusted cross-tabulation, the follow-\ning projections emerge for each subpopulation:\nA.

This\ndata, drawn from the Region I Inventory Survey conducted\nin October - November 1977, represents the best information\navailable on,-this subpopulation, and appears generally\nreliable for the limited purpose of an assessment and planning\ntool.  Assuming a continuation of existing treatment pro-\ngrams serving this subpopulation, no planning of additional\nservices is required.\nn\nt\n(51)\n\n12\nAPPENDIX A\nIV.

INTRODUCTION\nl\\\nThe following program descriptions, compositions and cost breakdowns are\nmeant to serve as a guideline for regional and area planning in the development\nof community residential alternative programs. The matching of client and\nresidential alternatives as described for each program is based on the Region\nI Client Evaluation Survey.  Approaches to staffing and start up program\ncosts will require modification depending on such factors as the support\nservices provided, client level of functioning, location of the facility\nand condition of the building.\nProgram Considerations\nAn underlying principle in the development of program models should be the\nmaximizing of individual client growth and the development of individualized\nservice plans to assist and teach clients to live as normal a 1ife as possible\nin the mainstream of the community.  This can be facilitated by incorporating\nthe developmental model when designing  Individual Service Plans, recognizing\nthe capability of each person to learn, grow and develop, no matter how severely\ndisabled.\nMany clients in need of a community residential  placement require assistance in\ngaining self-help skills, socialization skills, and use of community resources.\nFor some clients training may be quite basic; for others, more sophisticated,\ndepending on the individual  level of functioning upon entry into the community\nprogram.  In addition, some clients may require an individualized program to\neliminate problemmatic behaviors and/or supervision of basic physical care needs.\nThe following programs describe staffing and cost figures for either eight bed\nresidences or 4 bed apartments.  Although each apartment is described for a\nmaximum of four persons, two separate apartments might be clustered together\nin one large building or adjacent buildings.  In no event, however, should\nprograms be located in such geographical  proximity as to create an undue\nconcentration of clients in one area or neighborhood.\nMany of the attached program descriptions include the alternative of operating\nprograms in either houses or apartments.  As many programs can be implemented\nin either type of housing, facility decisions should be based on the programmatic\nflexibility as well as on the barriers to implementation and operation presented  >\nby each type of facility.  These may include the relative social advantages of\na small apartment for four persons over a larger home for eight residents; tMe\nability to design and implement service plans on a more individualized basis\nin smaller settings; the reality that small apartments are more normative than\nlarger homes; considerations of the types of housing available in an area; the\navailability of start-up monies (minimal  for an apartment program which  rec!u1[e*  '\n tJ\nno mortgage); cost of alternative staffing requirements (often higher in aoart^e  .,;\nthan in homes); renovation or time delays caused by the need to meet tne 5ta:3\nBuilding Code for Group Residences; and issues related to community acceptance\nand integration and local zoning ordinances.\n(66)\n\n-2-\nFinally, some of the residential alternatives are described as specialized\nprograms for persons with severe behavioral  problems and/or physical care\nneeds.  Staffing in these programs has been designed to provide the\nadditional coverage required by the added program responsibilities.\nProgrammatically, however, it is important for any one facility to have a\nmixed population with regard to level of severity of disability, as an\nimportant aspect of residential  programming  is peer role modeling, inter-\naction and support.  It is recommended that no more than half the residents\nin any specialized program require intensive behavioral  intervention or\nphysical care.  Special subpopulations, such as programs for adolescents,\nmay require alternative staffing configurations.  With some modifications,\nhowever, the range of specialized programming needs should fit within the\nalternative residential  programs described herein.\nSatellite Model of Organizing Network of Community Residential  Services\nWhen planning an area network of community residential  programs one concept\nto consider is the Satellite Model of Organizational  structure.  This consists\nof a core residential unit which, in addition to providing services and training\nto clients who live there, also provides managerial  support and program\ncoordination for each program in the area's network of residential  services.\nProfessional  staff as needed by the residential  network are maintained by the\nunit and are responsible for providing programmatic coordination and management\nfor clients within the network.  Some clients receiving services in the\nsatellite netowrk may never live in the core unit itself but may move into a\nsatellite setting directly.  Others may live in the core unit during an\nevaluation period, so that an individual  service plan may be developed and\nappropriate satellite program identified.  Some clients may come to the core\nunit intermittently for respite or emergency care.  Satellite programs may ii\nconsist of specialized group home or apartment programs, specialized  home\ncare and support services to clients residing in non-OMH provided or funded\nhousing (see following descriptions).  Utilization of this model'would\nnecessitate modification of the enclosed program and staffing descriptions\nto accommodate a centralized and consolidated administrative and program\ncoordination.\nStaffing Considerations\nFull time staff positions are based on a non-residential  forty hour week rather\ni Mr\nthan a live-in staff approach.  Programs utilizing live-in staff will  require\nmodification of the staffing pattern described here.  The annual  salary for mental\nhealth workers is estimated at $9500 with the recommendation that each program\nestablish two levels of salary, with entry level workers without experience\nin community mental  health work (MHW I) beginning at S3500  and those with\ngreater expertise and/or experience (MHW II) beginning at $10,500.\n' r\nIn addition, it is important that new staff participate in a comprehensive\ntraining program designed to orient them to the larger community mental  health\nsystem, other generic community  services, the goals, objectives and behavioral\ntechniques of the particular residential  program and a range of skills necessary\nto :neet client needs.\n(67)\n4\nJ\n\n-3-\nOn the enclosed charts the nubmer of positions indicated  in the \"Direct Care\nPersonnel\" column reflect the number of persons on duty on a particular shift.\nThe Full Time Equivalent  (F.T.E.) column  indicates the number of forty hour\nweek positions necessary to provide the coverage.  The \"Cover Factor\" column\nreflects staff necessary to cover vacation and sick leave time.  Recommended\nstaffing patterns should be viewed from the standpoint of overall  need rather\nthan rigid adherence to shift.  For example, if a director is at a residence\nat scheduled times during the day shift she/he may be able to provide the\nminimal coverage required when the majority of clients are engaging  in day\nactivities outside the home.  It might then be advantageous for some of the\nday shift mental health- workers1 hours to be reassigned to the evening shift\nwhen more clients are in the residence.  Additionally, it may be important\nto staff understanding of client functioning,inter-staff communication and\nprogram implementation for staff to rotate shifts so that all staff have the\nopportunity to be with clients engaging in a variety of daily living and\nsocial  experiences.  Actual  staff scheduling should also include time for all\nstaff to meet weekly to discuss general  concerns of the program and  individual\nclient progress, as well as a time for house meetings with all staff and\nresidents  present.\nStaffing  for each program with a minimum of eight clients includes a half\ntime Oirector/Administrator.  Responsibilities of this position should  include\nhiring and supervising direct care staff, coordinating and managing the\nresidential  aspect of the Individual  Service Plans (ISP), arranging for\nsupport services as needed, facilitating the use of generic community  services,\nrepresenting the program in community  relation efforts, providing or arranging\nfor pre-service and in-service training of direct care staff, managing the\nfiscal aspects of the operation and maintaining data as required.  Organizational\nstructure and staff composition of the residential  program will affect the\nresponsibilities and time needed for \"Oirector/Administrator\" duties.  For\nexample, an agency operating more than one residential  program may require a\nfull time director  with funding partially provided by each program.  A small\nagency operating a single program may want to combine the half-time director\nand float time into one position to include both direct care and  administrative\nduties and/or may require night staff to handle a portion of the paper\nadministrative duties such as completion of statistical  reports, etc.\nThe duties of mental  health workers  include assisting and teaching clients\nin learning to live independently, providing counselling and support to clients\nas necessary, implementing  the program's goals and responsibilities and  sharing\nwith the director and other staff the daily operational  tasks of the residence.\nWeekday staff are expected to facilitate clients' involvement  in non-residential\nprograms,activities  and employment, but must be available to clients who, for\nwhatever reason, do not participate  in such activities.\nBudget  Considerations\nWhen calculating the amount cf DMH resources needed for operating expenses, c\nincome should be deducted  from the total  cost.  Many clients are eligible for\nSupplementary Security  Income (S.S.I.) which  is presently 5215.93 per month.\nSubtract the amount the client keeps for personal  needs.  Multiply the remainder\nby 12 (months).  Reduce this figure by 5% as most facilities average a 5% vacancy\nrate over a year's time.  This will  provide you with an estimated  non-OMH house\nincome.\n(68)\n\n-4-\nProvider Considerations\nIt is generally beneficial  for providers of these programs to be private,\nnon-profit organizations experienced in operating residences for mentally\ndisabled clients.  Such providers should have the professional  skills necessary\nto design, establish and coordinate quality programs, including the ability\nto recruit and train dedicated staff.  They should also possess the\nadministrative capability and flexibility to manage such programs and\nintegrate their goals with the larger community alternative system.  To the\nextent that small, inexperienced private corporations or public agencies\nare used as providers, some modification of these program models may be\nnecessary to account for the lack of flexibility or other resultant constraints.\nProviders also have the flexibility to rent or purchase homes or apartments\nas well as the discretion to combine rent, maintenance and some insurance costs\nto cover variable rental prices.\nI!\nM\n(69)\n\n\\i\\\nPR06RAM  DEFINITIONS\n(70)\n\nPROGRAM DEFINITIONS\nSupport Services to Clients Residing in Non-DMH Provided or Funded\nA.\nHousing -  Staff support and consultation consisting of regular visits\nto clients' to assist in their adjustment to their living environment\nand the community at large, as well as assisting facility providers,\nwhen appropriate, in their work with clients.\nโขSpecialized Home Care Program - Supervised living of one to three\nadults in a private home in the community.

START-UP COSTS\nStart-Up Costs will vary considerably depending on such factors as\nlocation and condition of facility, whether facility is to be purchased or\nrented; whether there are legal complications; the particular building code\nspecifications to be met, etc.\na.  House Purhcase/Oown Payment:  Conventional mortgages from banks\nusually require a 20% down payment.  Thus a $15,000 down payment\n-t\nwould be sufficient to obtain a $75,000 conventional mortgage.\nWith liberal bank and/or employment of a state/federal mortgage\nassistance/guarantee program this amount could vary.\nb.  Legal Services:  Generally such services might include title\ntransfer, zoning advice and legal counseling.  In some instances,\nthese services might be obtained on a pro bona basis, in which\ncase there would be no cost.\nc.  Real Estate Taxes:  This varies depending on the time of year the\nproperty is purchased.  If the sale is closed in January, taxes\nfor the entire year must be paid before an exception is granted.\nConversely, if the closing occurs in December, little or no taxes\nneed be paid.  To date no way has been found to obtain an.\nexemption on the first year's taxes short of a legislative act.\nd.  Meeting Building Code Specifications:  These requirements include\ntotal smoke and heat detector systems (approximately $5000) and\nspecial fire resistant paint.  Depending on the structure, other\nexpenses could include widening stairs, adding rear fire escapes,\nchanging the direction for opening doors, adding fire doors,\ninstalling emergency lighting, etc.\ne.  Staff:  Prior to beginning program operation staff must be available\nto write proposals, perform need studies, make referral contacts,\nhire and train staff, purchase supplies and equipment, deal with\nbanks, lawyers, contractors, etc.\nI\nf.  Contingency Fund:  Clients generally move into a new residence a few\nat a time over the first few months of operation.  Ouring tnis rime\nthe majority of expenses are fixed costs that have to be met, in spite\nof a lower income from client fees.\ng.  Staff Training:  New staff should participate in a comprehensive training\nprogram prior to beginning to work with clients.  Ongoing training should\nbe provided through consultation funds.\nยง\n(70\n\nESTIMATED START-UP COSTS\nResidence or Home\nX.\nMtnumum Average Maximum\nโข\nDown  Payment 0 7.500 15,000\nb.

The  Program Models\nThe program models  described  herein  are  designed  to  provide  mentally\ndisabled  persons  living  in  the  community with  those  treatment  and  support\nservices  appropriate  to  their  neeas.  Taken  together,  they  represent  a\ncontinuum  of  programs  that  vary  in  structure  and  intensity  but which\nshould  enable  clients  to  progress  towards  independent,  productive  lives\nin  the  community.  Seme programs  are  primarily  clinical  and offer  a  range\nof  treatment  modalities  in  a  radically  oriented  environment;  some  ire\ndistinctively  nonclinical  and  provide  training  in  various  social,  physical,\nvocational,  and  educational  skills  to  assist  clients  in  gaining  such  in-\ndependence;  and  finally  others  are  chiefly  supportive,  giving  clients\nhelp,  when  necessary,  in  responding  to  the  demands  of  community  living.\nAlthough  available  to  all  mentally  disabled  persons  Iving  in  the com-\nmunity,  these  models  are  principally  intended  to  complement  ccrmiunity\nresidential  alternatives  yj  serving  the  nonresidential  program needs  of\nclients  living  in  those  settings.  It  is  the  expectation  that  such  clients\nwill  participate  in  these  nonresidential  programs  or  other  activities\nsuch  as  employment  or  schooling  five  days  per  week.  Thus  these  programs\nare  but  one  piece  of  a comprehensive  network  of  a  conmunity  mental  health\nsystem.\nThe  separate  models  :re$=n*ed  below  are  designed  to  be  unified  in\nmultiple  ways.  First,  zr.s assessment  unit  draws  into  the  evaluation\nand  treatment  planning  pr;cass  reoresantatives  from  those  services  thac\nI\nclients  are  to  receive.  In  :.iis  way even  before  client  treatment  clans\ni1'\ni!\nil\nii-\n(120)\n\nare implemented, key caregivers meet to discuss a client's needs and\ntotal  program.\nThis initial unification is carried forward by community service\ncoordinators who assume primary responsibility for the whole client, and\ninsure that the client is not treated atomistically.  It would be a\nmistake, however, to view the community service coordination function as\nmerely a \"liaison\" one.  Community service coordinators will establish\n\"supportive human relationships\" with their clients, providing counseling\naimed at bolstering clients' coping skills and self esteem.  Through these\nrelationships community service coordinators will develop a multi-level\nknowledge of their clients' service needs and how these needs fit together.\nAnother dynamic for unification provided for in this plan is that the\nvarious programs can share staff, so that persons employed part time by\none program might also be employed part time by another.  This coemployment\nwill be facilitated by the fact that many programs, in particular the\nIt  should  be noted  that  the  community  service  \"coordinators  functions  are\nones  that  are  sometimes  assigned  to  aftercare  workers  or  psychotherapists  n\nother  systems.  The model  of  community service  coordination.Proposed  here  s\ndesigned  to  emphasize  several  aspects  of  these  functions  which become problem-\natic  in  systems  that  rely  on aftercare  or  psychotherapy.\n.  In^ontrast  to  ?he concept  of  aftercare  community service  coordinat on\nas  proposed  here  is  not  restricted  to  discharged  clients  and a  post-hospital\nization  period.  Instead  it  is  a service  designed  for  a spectrum of  clients\nranging  from  those who are  recently  discharged  to  those  who have never been\nin  the  hospital  but  are  at  risk  and  those  who are  currently  hospitalized.\nMoreover,  it  is  explicitly  designed  to  be available  to  such  clients  as  long\nas  they  are  in  need of  any mental  health  services <.  will\n  rUant in\nโข  Community  Service  coordination  also  assumes  that  jost  clients  win\nneed  a variety  of  services  which  must  be coordinated  to b^  ' ^^\nclients  to  obtain  these  servicas  and  insuring  that  they  arยซ  ยซ?rdina\nare\ninvolves  working  with  clients  on a  variety  OT problems,  many or  rfjich\nneither  psychological  nor psychiatric,  in  a variety  or  settings  tor\nflexible  amounts  of  time.  Psychotherapy  provided  in an or.ica  ^  a\nfixed  amount  of  time  is  ill  suited  to  ^ese  functions.  Moreover,  only\na minority  of  clients  are  appropriate  ror  the  specialized  behav  ยฐr\n  d\nmodification  or  intrapsychically  oriented  treatments  soeci.icaU/  as.ociat.a\nwith  psychotnerapy.\n(121)\n\n\"clinical\" ones: assessment, community service coordination, crisis inter-\nvention, psychotherapy, family therapy, respite care and medication/nursing\nare intended to be co-located in and an integral part of a community\nmental health center.\nFinally, other mental health and generic social services that may be\nphysically separate from a mental health center will be integrated into\nthe care system by means of affiliation agreements maintained by coordin-\nation staff in area offices, by umbrella activities of community service\ncoordinators and assessment team members and by day to day working inter-\nactions among other program staff.\nIn conformity with the principles of normalization, these models\nspecifically exclude all generic services that are otherwise available\nin the community.  Clients should be encouraged to use generic educational,\ntransportation, health, legal and other services; mental health staff\nshouTd assist generic service providers in making their services\naccessible to mental health clients.  To the extent that mental health\nclients are denied such services, Area based advocates should assist\nclients in gaining access to those agencies and organizations.\nGiven the dearth of existing, generally accepted nonresidential\nprototypes, the attached models set forth the overall purpose and par-\nticular elements of each program and include a reasonably accurate pro-\njection of the range of costs for serving clients with intensive and\nmoderate needs.  As new data and information are generated through the\nimplementation of these programs, refinements and adjustments will\nnecessarily be made.\n(122)\n\nB.  Population to Be Served\nIt is recognized that some of the treatment and support services\ndescribed in the attached models are presently being offered in some form,\nalthough there is a considerable variance between Areas.  Moreover,\ncertain  nonresidential services such as prescreening, crisis, interven-\ntion, and community service coordination are not available anywhere in\nthe Region.  These program models are designed to supplement existing\nservices in order to meet the needs of persons who are or may be hospital-\nized due to the inadequacy or total unavailability of appropriate community\ntreatment and support programs.  Based on a thorough review of data\nsupplied by the Northampton State Hospital, the Regional Office, and the\nclient assessment survey, this population includes approximately 2100\nmentally disabled persons in Region 1.  (See Analysis of Population in\nRegion 1.)  In addition, there are approximately 4000 other persons now\nreceiving partially adequate mental health services from existing programs\nwhich are essential in preventing their hospitalization.  For purposes\nof the planning process, it is assumed that the attached models must be\nintegrated with existing Area programs in a manner that does not decrease\nor dilute the services presently being provided to persons Irving in the\ncommunity.\nC.  Staffing and Costs\n1. Staffing\nThe attached models include only a staffing pattern and projection\nof costs.  Staffing is in terms of full time equivalents (FTE's) and\nnot actual persons.  One FTE may be one person working 40 hours, two\n(123)\n\npeople working 20 hours, etc.  No detailed employment objectives,\nlines of authority, hiring procedures, or staff training element is\nincluded.  Standards for nonresidential  programs should be developed\nthat address these issues by establishing guidelines for service\nproviders in their development of clear personnel policies.\nRegular training is essential to the viability of the entire\ncommunity care system and participation  in ongoing training programs\nis included as a portion of each person's nondirect care responsibil-\nities.  In addition, time is allocated for staff meetings, client\nconferences, record keeping, consultation, eduction, liaison with\nother agencies, and travel.  It is assumed that most staff would spend\n70% of their time in direct care tasks and only 30% in nondirect care\nresponsibilities.  The latter figure is significantly less than that\nused by the National  Institute of Mental Health in computing similar\nstaffing requirements and is estimated to be somewhat less than that\npresently being practiced in community mental health centers in the\nCommonwealth.\nProvided with each program model is a service analysis.  These\nanalyses quantify the work to be done by a program and the staff time\navailable for performing  it.  These and certain other statistics are\nused to check the appropriateness of the programs' projected utilization,\ndirect and non-direct care staffing and unit costs.\nAlthough the models do not include separate components or\nstaffing patterns for different client subpopulations  such as elderly,\nmentally retarded or adolescent, it is clearly recognized  that \"he\nactual imDlementation of the models, particularly day treatment, day\n(124)\n\n6\nactivity and sheltered workshop, may differ.  The special needs of\neach subpopulation would affect both the content of a client's pro-\ngram and the qualifications of the individual staff person, but not\nthe actual model or staffing pattern.\n2. Costs\nIn light of the current cost of medical  insurance, social  security,\nand other employee benefits, the models adopt a standard fringe of 18%.\nSimilarly a figure of 20% of direct care salaries is regularly used\nto compute the cost of overhead, which includes equipment maintenance\nand replacement, supplies, postage, travel, office rental, telephone,\nauditing costs, and legal expenses.\nFor those services open 50 weeks a year (i.e. offering staff a\n2 week vacation) approximately 11% of staff time was estimated to be\nnecessary to cover sick days, accidents and other types of legitimate\nabsences.  This figure was computed as follows:\n250  working days per year to cover (= 50 weeks x 5 days per week)\n15  sick days\n3  personal  days\n7  other (average number per year, due to: industrial  accidents,\nmaternity/education  leave, extended vacation, death\ndays, etc.)\n25 Total lost days\n225 Average number of days worked per year\n1.11  Factor to cover lost days = 225 * 250\nNo reference is made in program elements to expected start-up\ncosts, including office equipment and initial training.  Approxi-\nmately S600 should be added for each staff person to every program\nmodel, 20\" of which is allocated  to training and the remainder to\n(125)\n\nequipment.  A portion  of  these expenses  may be reduced  through the\nuse of certain  equipment  from other  state  facilities  and institutions.\nIn  addition,  $5,000 should be allocated  for the purchase of a vehicle\nfor  each program that  provides  transportation  (day treatment, day\nactivity  and pre-vocational  training/sheltered  workshops).  A summary\nof  start-up  costs  is shown in Table 1.\nD.  Administration\nIt  is the expectation  that  each Area will  have the administrative\ncapacity  to coordinate  the delivery  of  services  between  residential\nand nonresidential  programs  pursuant  to  individual  service  plans  (ISP).\nHowever,  these models also  locate within  services  the clerical  personnel\nnecessary  to meet their  secretarial,  receptionist,  record  keeping and\nbookkeeping  needs.  Along with  overhead,  these  administrative  costs  amount\nto  an average of 202 of the total  program cost.  The quality  control and\nmonitoring  functions  of the system will  be performed by the Regional  Offict\nAlthough  the program models  set forth  a standard  staffing  pattern  to be\nโขIIP\nfor every Area, the Regional Services Administrator would retain the  m.\ndiscretion to shift and distribute resources between areas in order to  *:\nw\nensure  an equitable  per client  allocation.  Finally,  eaich client  will  ^'\nhave  a community  service  coordinator  and each  Area  a  cljient  advocate  ^>>\nto  facilitate  the delivery  of appropriate  services  in  t|he least  restrictive J-\nenvironment.  ^\n(126)\n\n8\nI.  ASSESSMENT TEAM\nThe Assessment Team will provide a major coordinating, evaluation,\nassessment and individual  treatment planning function for the 427 at risk\npersons in each OMH area in Region I.  The Team will provide a core inter-\ndisciplinary staff and will draw upon professionals from the Medication,\nConmunity Service, Crisis Intervention, and Psychotherapy Programs to\nprovide an individual  interdisciplinary team for each client.  The\nindividual client's team will be responsible for drafting and annually\nreviewing individual service plans for the client.  More frequent than\nannual reviews may be requested by the community service coordinator,\nmay be planned by the client's team or may be required because of a\ncrisis incident.  The Team ideally should be based in a community mental\nhealth center.\nA.  Definition\nA program designed to provide initial screening, assessment and\nservice planning for all at risk persons in the DMH service system\nand to annually or more frequently review and update the initial\nservice plan.\nB.  Program Elements\nij\nProgram will\n1.  Provide initial screening, assessment and individual\nservice plans for persons seeking DMH services who\nhave been previously hospitalized or would be at the\nrisk of hospitalization if comprehensive community\nservices were not available.\n2.  Receive referrals from public and private agencies as\nwell as self-referrals.\n3.  Utilize staff from the Medication, Crisis, Psychotherapy\nCounseling and Community Service Programs to create\n(127)\n\ninterdisciplinary teams to:carry out screening,\nassessment, and individual service planning.\n4.  Determine the range of appropriate OMH services and\nservices of other public and private agencies for each\nclient.\n5.  Refer clients for placement and ongoing service\nmonitoring the Community Service Coordination Program.\n6.  Periodically, but at least annually, reevaluate all\nindividual service plans and reevaluate upon request of\nany service program or community service coordinator.\n7.  Provide screening, assessment, and individual service\nplans for clients referred from the Crisis Unit after\ninitial crisis resolution.\n8.  Reevaluate individual service plans upon requests of\nMedication, Community Service Coordination, Crisis and/or\nPsychotherapy Programs.\nC. Clients\n(427) area clients could be assessed at least once annualy\nby this program model.  Some clients, such as those who become acutely\ndisturbed, behave in unexpected and dangerous ways, appear ready for\nless restrictive services or whose progress appears blocked, might be\nre-evaluated more frequently.  The average number of assessments per client\nis projected to be one and one half.  The annual program capacity is\n640 evaluations.\n(128)\n\nStaffing/Cost Schedule\n10\np,ggยปssment Team\nFull Proqram Fringe Overhead\nDirect  Care  Personnel FTE's Sala Salary 18% 20% TOTAL\n*.

COMMUNITY SERVICE COORDINATION  PROGRAM\nCommunity service coordinators should be closely related to the\nAssessment Team which will serve as the intake point for at risk clients\nin an Area.  They should be assigned after the Assessment Team screen-\ning and once it is determined that DMH services will be made available\nto the client through an individual community service plan.  Each\nservice coordinator should have a caseload which reflects a range of\nclient difficulties since long term ability to constantly handle the\nclients most disorganized and frequently in crisis is limited.\nA.  Definition\nCommunity  service coordination involves responsibility for\nestablishing a supportive human relationship with each client;\nproviding itermittent supportive'counseling with respect to\nproblems in daily living; coordinating, monitoring and initiating\nchanges in the agreed upon service plan for a client; providing\ncontinuity for clients as they move through various services of\nthe system; and advocating for client vis a vis the mental health\nand generic service systems.\n8.  Program Elements\nProgram ^wi 11\n1.  Work closely with Assessment Team to receive referrals\nof clients for whom DMH services are being planned.\n2.  Establish a primary support relationship with the client\nthrough periodic individual meetings at a clinic location and\nin the field (e.g., in a client's home, residential  program\nor day program).\n3.  Meet periodically with the program staff or individuals\nproviding services for the client to monitor client's progress\n(131)\n\n13\nand services and to assure linkages and communication among\nservices when a client is receiving more than one service.\n4.  Aid client's transition from one service or program to\nanother.\n5.  Assist clients in meeting demands of community living,\nincluding advocating for the client's needs with community\nagencies and other service providers.\nS.  Act as resource for referral and assistance of clients in\nobtaining generic education, employment and recreation services.\nm\n7.  Arrange for periodic revaluations of client by the\nAssessment Team and referral to other services when appropriate\nor discharge planning and recommendations when appropriate.\n8.  Receive consultations from the Assessment Team, Crisis\nUnit, and Medication Unit.\n9.  Casework supervisors will assist in staffing  individual\nservice planning teams drawn up by the Assessment Team and\nwill provide direct care two days per week.\nC.

INPATIENT PROGRAMS\nTreatment will be provided in general hospitals with psychiatric\ncapacity.  Referrals will be made from the Crisis Intervention Program\nand directly from the community.  Depending on the length of stay of\nthe client, the Inpatient Program will perform assessment, evaluation\nand treatment planning functions and initiate on-site treatment.  If\nthe stay 1s less than four days, assessment and treatment planning\nwill be referred to the Assessment Team.  The Inpatient Unit will work\ncooperatively with the Assessment Team and Crisis Unit and referral to\nother OMH services will take place only through the Assessment Team.\nA.  Definition\nTo provide short term involuntary or emergency hospitalization\n(under 30 days) for assaultive persons who are in crisis and who\ncannot be served at the time 1n other DMH residential, day, or\ncrisis intervention programs.\nB.

Staffing/Costs\nApproximately 4 beds should be provided in a general hospital\nlocated in each Area.  The costs of care in the hospital should\nbe paid through insurance or Medicaid.\nD.  Clients\nFor those clients needing constant or specialized medical super-\nvision in a medical environment including those requiring involuntary\ncare.  Approximately 4 beds annually are estimated to be necessary.\nThe costs of care in the hospital should be paid through private\ninsurance or Medicaid.\n(158)\n\n40\nIX.  DAY TREATMENT PROGRAMS\nThese programs will be utilized primarily by clients requiring\nOMH housing but not exclusively so.  They should be viewed as rela-\ntively intensive therapeutic programs which should serve clients\nfor an average of 16 weeks with treatment directed toward specific\ngoals.  Clients should then be able to move to less intensive ser-\nvices such as supportive psychotherapy counseling, day activity,\nemployment, or educational programs.  Referrals, along with individual\nservice plans, will be received from the Assessment Team and monitor-\ning of individual service plans will be conducted by a community\nโขI? service coordinator.\nA.  Definition\nDay treatment  programs  provide  a structured,  five  day a week,\nday time program including  psychiatric  services,  individual  and\ngroup therapy,  milieu  therapy,  medical  services,  educational  ser-\nvices,  and social  and vocational  rehabilitation  on  irrelatively\nshort-term basis  directed  to  individual  treatment  goals.\nB.

DAY ACTIVITY TREATMENT PROGRAMS\n*\nThe major distinction'between day activity and day treatment\nprograms is that some clients may utilize day activity programs on\na long term basis whereas day treatment programs should be designed\nas more Intensive and limited to a short term.  Day activity programs\nwill be oriented for chronic or stable clients (including MR) who may\nbe preparing for sheltered workshops or some supervised employment\nsetting but who have limited potential  for independent employment and\nself-support.  They will include a prevocational  training component\nsimilar to, but separate from, the sheltered workshop serving more\nindependent clients.\nA.  Definition\nDay activity programs consist of a daily, five day a week,\nstructured program of social, educational, vocational, rehabilita-\ntion and activities of dally living training oriented to individual\nservices plans and goals of clients, including both those requiring\na short term transitional  service and others requiring a longer\nterm maintenance service.\nB.  Program Elements\nProgram will\n1.  Receive referrals from Assessment Team, Day Treatment,\nand Community Service Coordinator.\n2.  Implement individualized service and training plans\ndirected either to movement of clients on to sheltered\nworkshops or other vocational  programs or to maintenance\nof clients who cannot move to less structured settings.\n3.  Provide training in social, educational, vocational,\n(163)\n\n45\nrehabilitation  and  activities  of  daily  living  skills.\n4.  Regularly  consult  with  each  client's  community  service\ncoordinator  and  together  with  the  community  service\ncoordinator,  plan  for  client's  leaving  the  program  or\nany necessary  adjustments  for  long  term clients,  in-\ncluding  placement  in  sheltered  workshop.\n5.  Meet  periodically  with  family  and/or  residential  place-\nment  staff  to  discuss  client's  progress.\n6.  Provide  for  transportation  of  clients  to  and  from\nprogram.\nC.  Clients\nFor clients who are not acutely disturbed but who need long\nterm support and supervision to assist them in dealing with chronic\nand/or ^ry debilitating problems.  The program model would serve\n30 clients at any one time.  The expected length of service for\nan average client is 50 weeks.  Consequently\"the number of clients\none program can serve annually is 30.\n(164)\n\nStaffing/Cost Schedule\nยปrvi<set*  nยปy a^t-iv-it-y Treatment m\n46\nFull Program Fringe Overhead\nI.

VOCATIONAL  REHABILITATION\nVocational services should, wherever possible, be utilized in the\ncommunity, rather than creating special programs for OMH clients.\nClients who do not require intensive supervision in Day Treatment or\nDay Activity Programs would presumably be able to participate in a\nCETA, WIN, NYC, OIC, or other privately financed job training program\nwith the supportive help of their family and/or residential  placement\ncounselor or their community service coordinators.  For those persons\nneeding additional support and assistance in locating employment, a\ntransitional employment and job placement program is necessary.  For\npersons not yet capable of working in regular employment settings, a\nprevocational and sheltered workshop program would be created.\nWhile a number of vocational  rehabilitation services and program\nmodels are being proposed, we realize that there are many other types\nof programs that can and should be encouraged to develop-  The absence\nof such programs from this model is not to imply that new, creative,\nand innovative approaches to vocational rehabilitation should not be\nencouraged.  Some specific models that are valuable for different\nclient ability levels and interests include client managed businesses,\noutdoor work programs, and cottage industries.\nโข -'โข!>:.\n(167)\n\n49\nA.  PREVOCATIONAL  TRAINING/SHELTERED  WORKSHOPS\nPrevocational  training and sheltered workshops should be\nestablished with the primary goal of teaching basic work skills\nand providing  employment  opportunity  in a supervised and structured\nsetting which will also meet the client's social and  rehabilitation\nneeds.  It is expected  that some percentage of the clients will\neventually move on to other employment  settings.  The capacity to\nprovide such movement must be included, in addition  to the provision\nof long term useful  employment  on a maintenance basis for a number\nof clients.\n1.  Definition\nPrevocational  training provides a structured  employment\nsetting for the teaching of basic work skills to persons not\nyet able to perform  independently  in a sheltered workshop.  A\nsheltered workshop  provides  vocational  training and  rehabilita-\ntion services, and work activity acquired  through contracts with\nprivate  industry.  This training  is designed primarily as an\nintermediate  step for clients  capable of moving on to independent\nemployment, but also serves as a long term setting  for clients\nwith  limited potential  to obtain  independent  employment.\n2.  Program  Elements\nProgram will\na.  Receive  referrals  from Assessment  Team, Day  ~reiz~erz,\nand Community  Service  Coordinator.\nb.  Implement  individualized  vocational  plans, as oreoarec\nby program  staff, directed  toward ,-novment of clients\nto independent emcioyment or to productive  -aintenanca\n(168)\n\n50\nof  sheltered employment-\nc.  Provide supportive  counseling  related  to employment\nand employment related  problems.\nd.  Regularly  consult  with  each client's  community\nservice  coordinator  and together with  the community\nservice  coordinator,  plan  for  any changes  in  the\nclient's  service  plan.\ne.  Meet periodically  with  client's  family  and/or\nresidential  placement counselor  to  discuss  client's\nprogress  or  status.\nf.  Provide  transportation  to  and from program.\n'ยฃ.:\nC.  Clients\nFor clients with severe or multiple disabilities who lack\nbasic work and social skills,  \"his program model will serve\n38 clients annually, and 30 clients at any one time.

RECREATIONAL/SOCIALIZATION PROGRAM\nIn  general,  clients  should  use  regular  conmunity  programs  at  adult\neducation  centers,  the  YMCA-YWCA, and  other  recreational  locations.\nSegregating  clients  for  special  programs  of  a general  recreational\nnature  is  not  conducive  to  normalization.  To  the  maximum extent  pos-\nsible  they  should  be  encouraged  to  go on  their  own or  in  small  groups\nof  2-3  to  generic  programs  for  additional  activities.  To  facilitate\nuse of  generic  programs  and  integration  of  clients  into  adult  education\nprograms,  community  centers  or  YMCA-YWCA programs,  there  should be\nfunding  for  a part-time  liaison  staff  person  at  the  generic  program,\nand  regular  membership  or  tuition  fees  for  the  activities.  The  role  of\nthe  liaison  person  would be merely  to  be  familiar  with  DMH clients  using\nthe  program and  to  respond  to  any  problems  that  might  arise.  Other\nrecreation/socialization  services  such  as  social  clubs  and  self-help\ngroups  should  be  facilitated  by  the  community  service  coordinators\nand residential  staff.\nA.  Definition\nFunds  should  be  provided  to  community  centers,  YMCA,  YWCA or\nadult  education  programs  utilized  regularly  by  10 or  more DMH\nclients  living  in  DMH housing  or  in  non-DMH  housing,  to  provide  cne\nextra  part-time  staff  liaison  and  necessary  membership  or  tuition\nfees.\nB.

TRANSPORTATION\nTransportation of clients to and from programs and appointments is\nan ongoing problem for all mental health and social service providers.\nCreating separate transportation systems, however, is not cost effective\nor manageable, given the varying needs of clients and the fact that for\nsome clients transportation needs will  change periodically, and in some\ncases, frequently.  For this reason transportation  should be included\nin full time Day Activity, Day Treatment and Sheltered Workshop Programs.\nIn addition, most residential  programs will  find that staff have to\nprovide transportation  for clients' appointments or other special  needs,\nas well as for social and recreational  group activities.  Funding for\nthese programs should include the purchase of a vehicle and ongoing\ntransportation costs.  Individual  transportation  to clinics, counseling,\njobs, higher education and non-DMH training for those not in DMH\nresidences would be arranged by the client with assistance from the\ncommunity  services coordinator if necessary.\n(181)\n\n63\nXIV.  EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS\nEducational needs of clients who require intensive DMH services\nshould be met in the context of Day Treatment and Day Activity\nPrograms.  Clients who are then able to move into adult education\nprograms or college courses should be encouraged and aided to do so.\nAll youth (age 22 and under) should receive CORE evaluations and be\nprovided services via their local board of education.  For adolescents,\nthese services should include a comprehensive day treatment/educational\nprogram specifically designed to meet their needs as identified in\nthe CORE evaluation.  Pursuant to Chapter 766, it is the responsibility\nof local school boards to implement such programs.\n(182)\n\nATTACHMENT D\nAMENDED FINAL DRAFT\nRESIDENTIAL PLACEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR\nMENTALLY DISABLED PERSONS IN REGION I\nI.  INTRODUCTION\nThis document sets forth the number and type of residential\nplacements that must be designed and created for the mentally\ndisabled population in Region I.  Having drafted a general\ndescription of 12 residential models, including staffing patterns\nand costs (see Community Residential Alternatives), and having\ngrouped the disabled population into 22 clusters representing\ndifferent client needs (see Summary of Clusters for Northampton\nState Hospital), it was then necessary to match each cluster\nwith a primary and, if appropriate, secondary placement recom-\nmendation.  The conclusions of the matching process are set forth\nin Part II.\nWhile most clusters are assigned only one primary placement\nrecommendation, in certain cases several primary placement\nrecommendations are suggested.  Wherever an apartment placement\nis recommended as a first choice, it is always coupled with a\ngroup home or transitional community residence.  This reflects\nthe fact that both placements are programmatically  approximately\nthe same, and that the determination of which should be created\nand funded is primarily an administrative choice best left to\nthe implementation phase of this planning process.  In certain\nother cases two or more placements are suggested as first\nchoices with percentages assigned to each.  In these cases it\nis recognized that the least restrictive alternative is most\ndesirable, but given the institutionalization of some persons\nin that cluster, immediate placement in that alternative may not\nbe appropriate for all clients in that cluster.  It is clearly\nintended, however, that such clients will be provided necessary\ntraining and support as to enable them to move into the less\nrestrictive placement shown as soon as possible.  Secondary\nplacements are considered to be less desirable than the primary\nplacements for most clients; however, they are to be considered\nas options for certain clients in clusters with documented\nspecial needs.\nThe Summary of Clusters and the Analysis of the Mentally\nDisabled Population (Appendix E) describe the number of persons ,\nin each cluster for both the Hospital and community populations.\nIt should be noted that, pursuant to the precedental rules\ndescribed in the Summary of Clusters, adolescent, mentally retarded,\nchronic, and acute clients with serious behavioral problems were\ninitially factored out and placed in the assaultive cluster (c).\n(183)\n\nGiven this frequency distribution and the matching of clusters\nand residential models, it is possible to determine the number\nof placements for each subpopulation that must be created in\nI- each type of residential program.  The residential needs of\nthe Hospital subpopulations and the community subpopulations\nI1.; are set forth in Parts III and IV, respectively.  A table des-\ncribing the total number of placements in each residential\nalternative for all mentally disabled persons in Region I is\nin Part V.\n(184)\n\nII.

FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION OF RESIDENTIAL PLACEMENTS FOR HOSPITAL\nPOPULATION\nThe following distribution shows the residential placements for\nall persons in the Hospital on a given day.  It is based on the data\ngathered from the client assessment survey with respect to the Hospital\npopulation as of September 17, 1977.  Thus it includes an average daily\ncensus of persons within the acute and recidivist subpopulations, as\nwell as all persons in the long-term hospitalization group.\nNo. of No. of\nPrimary Secondary\nModel Code Model Type Placements Placements\nA Non-DMH Housing w/Support  28\nB Specialized Home Care  31\nC D Supervised Apartment/Group Home  255\nE, E-, Transitional Apartment/\nCommunity Residence  29\nF.

FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION FOR NON-HOSPITAL SUBPOPULATIONS\nA. โข Acute Subpopulations\nA significant portion of the thirty-two persons in this\nsubpopulation who are hospitalized at any given time could best\nbe served by non-residential crisis intervention services.\n(See Nonresidential Treatment and Support Models--Crisis\nIntervention).  Although this subpopulation is comprised\nonly of persons with no prior admissions to the Hospital,\na portion of this subpopulation may have been receiving\nmental health services through outpatient clinics and\nsupport programs, while the remainder of this group had\nno previous contact with the mental health system.  For\nboth components of this subpopulation, however, a non-\nresidential crisis intervention program is appropriate and\nhas already been included in Part III, above.\nBecause a non-residential program does not have the\ncapability of responding to the security needs of highly\nassaultive or committed persons, a limited number of general\nhospital psychiatric beds will be necessary.  Given the\nsmall number and rapid turnover of such cases, tw_enยฃ.y\nhospital beds should meet the needs of the Region.  These\nplacements would be created in private hospitals located\nin each DMH ARea, and would include the capacity to accept\ninvoluntary clients.  An additional twenty voluntary psy-\nchiatric beds should be created in these hospitals, thus\n,  providing a toj:a,l_of forty beds in the Region.  It is\ninteresting to note that a detailed study of general\nhospital resource allocations by the Western Massachusetts\n..Health Planning Council indicated that, beyond the eighty\nbeds specifically designated for psychiatric services, an\nadditional forty beds were often used to meet the needs of\npsychiatric patients.  Although any new hospital beds may\nhave to go through the Determination of Need procedure,\nit is clear that the failure to create the necessary hospital\nplacements would significantly undermine the other residen-\ntial placement distributions.\nB.  Recidivist Subpopulation\nAlthough almost all of the 1076 persons in this sub-\npopulation will require some form of mental health services\nto prevent their rehospitalization, only a small percentage\n(150 persons) will need a residential placement.  Most of\nthe residential needs of this subpopulation should be\nreflected in the 81 placements for this group, included in\nPart III (see also Appendix E of the Final Draft of the\nPopulation Analysis)'.  Given the size of this subpopulation,\nhowever, it is somewhat difficult to determine the precise\n(189)\n\nnumber of persons who will need residential placement at\nany given time.  It is reasonable to assume that a small\nnumber of additional placements will be needed to meet the\nneed of individuals in this subpopulation who are in acute\ncrisis or need extensive support subsequent to such crisis.\nThe needs of this group for non-residential crisis services\nand general hospital beds have already been included in\nthe placements set forth in Part III and Part IVA.  Many\nothers, however, may require intensive support to live\nin their own apartment or home.  On the basis of data on\nthe recidivist population of the Northampton State, approx-\nimately 500 persons per year must be provided this level\nof support.\nNo.  of\nPrimary\nModel Code Model Type Placements\nA Non-DMH Housing with Support 500\nB Specialized Home Care 13\nC, D Supervised Apartment/Group Home 12\nC.  Long Term Subpopulation\nAll of the 362 persons in this subpopulation who will\nneed residential placement have already been included in\nPart III\nD.  Discharged Subpopulation\nSince all 172 persons in this subpopulation presently\nreside in nursing or rest homes, they will only need\npsychiatric support services in their residences.  Given\nthe lack of adequate staff or other resources of almost\nall nursing and rest homes to address the needs of former\nHospital patients, additional support services are necessary\nto avoid having the nursing home become a mini-institution\nwith inadequate treatment.\nNo. of\nPrimary\nModel Code Model Type Placements\nNon-DMH Housing with Support 172\n(Nursing Home)\n(190)\n\nIV.

Introduction\nThis document sets forth the number and type of nonresiden-\ntial placements  that must be designed and created for the\nmentally disabled population in Region I.  Having drafted a\ngeneral description of 15 nonresidential models, including\nstaffing patterns and costs (see Nonresidential Treatment and\nSupport Programs) and having grouped the disabled  population\ninto 22 clusters representing different client needs (see Summary\nof Clusters for Northampton State Hospital), it was then necessary\nto match each cluster with the program(s) appropriate to the\nneeds of those clients.  The conclusions of the matching  process\nare set forth in Part II.\nA comprehensive nonresidential  system must have the capacity\nto assist approximately 2100 persons in Region I or roughly\n427 persons in each of the five Areas.  While some models, such\nas the assessment and community service coordination programs,\nare designed to serve all persons, others, such as day treatment,\nday activity, prevocational/sheltered workshop, and transitional\nemployment/job placement represent a continuum along which\nclients should progress as they move towards full  integration\nin the community.  Thus only a percentage of any one cluster\nwill need a particular program on this continuum at a given\ntime.  The percentages used for these program models  reflect\nthe clients' present needs, as determined by the client assess-\nment survey data, with due weight given to the institutionaliza-\ntion that most of the Hospital population has experienced.\nA few models, such as counseling, respite care, and family\nsupport, are limited programs  that should be available for a\nrelatively  small number of persons.  Although it is possible to\ndetermine which clusters are likely to require these services,\nas well as the total number of persons in each Area who would\nparticipate in these programs, it is not possible to calculate\nthe precise percentage of each cluster appropriate for each\nmodel; therefore, an x  is used to indicate the general con-\nclusion that some portion of the cluster needs that program.\nThe Summary of Clusters and the Analysis of the Mentally\nDisabled Population  (Appendix E) describe the number of persons\nin each cluster for both the Hospital and community populations.\nGiven this frequency distribution and the matching of clusters\n(192)\n\nand residential models, it is possible to determine the number\nof placements in each program that must be created for each\nsubpopulation  The nonresidential needs of the Hospital and\ncommunity subpopulations are set forth in Part III.  A tabula-\ntion of the total number of placements in each program for all\nmentally disabled persons in Region I is presented in Part IV.\nIt is recognized that each of the five Areas vary con-\nsiderably in size and need for new programs; for the ease of\ncomputation, however, each Area is considered to have an\naverage of 1/5 of the client population.\n(193)\n\nPI  PI  PI  PI  PJ  PJ\ntt> n> CO\na a 3 CO OP\nm a> (P n a a> rr rr 03 CL O\n03 01 c Patient r\n(-โข Q X\nrr 3 o (D Character-\nre 03\n< CO istic\nJO jn>o h0^J r3\"r P503\nrr rr rt\nยป Z\n03 O\na.\nn>\nMo\nw\nCluster z\nH\n# of Persons\ni\nin Cluster\no\njo PI\npi r\naID >\"a X XX X  X  X  X  X  X Intake/ CMOO\nAssessment PI H\n( z n\nrr O\nH X H\ntBo>  p3- x x x x x x x x x xx Comm.

There-\nfore, the Area and Regional figures do not accurately reflect the\nnumber of placements needed but rather the unduplicated number of\npersons needing such services.  As set forth in the Nonresidential\nTreatment and Support Programs, it is reasonable to assume that\nfour placements is sufficient to meet the needs of approximately\n400 persons in each Area.\n2\nThe average client stay in the day treatment programs is 16\nweeks; one placement is thus capable of serving approximately\n3 persons.  As set forth in the Nonresidential Treatment and Support\nProgram, it is reasonable to assume that a program with 20 place-\nments can meet the needs of each Area.\nParticipation in this program is not related to client cluster\nand therefore is not included in the preceding tables.  None of the\npersons in the day treatment (20) or day activity treatment (73)\n(201)\n\n11\nprograms or clients in the acute (100) or discharged to nursing hor.e\n(35) subpopulations will need a separate recreation program.  Of\nthe remaining 200 clients in each Area, most of whom are in the\nrecidivist subpopulation, approximately one-half would participate\nin this program.\n(202)\nJ\n\nATTACHMENT F\n-FINAL DRAFT\nMANAGEMENT COMPONENT\nI.  Introduction\nThe Department of Mental Health has the primary and ultimate\nresponsibility for creating and maintaining a comprehensive system\nof community treatment and support programs appropriate to the needs\nof mentally disabled persons.  This responsibility is undertaken on\na local level through Regional and Area Offices which develop, fund,\nmanage, coordinate, and monitor these programs.  To the extent that\nservices are delivered through many independent providers, the Depart-\nment's responsibilities can only be fulfilled If it has the manage-\nment capacity to oversee a diverse delivery system.  Moreover, given\nthe clinical advantages of providing much treatment and training out-\nside of the residential environment, the task of ensuring that its\nclients regularly receive appropriate services makes the Department's\nmanagement responsibilities especially complex.  The Regional and Area\nOffices presently lack adequate mental health resources to fulfill those\nresponsibilities, since they are primarily geared to an institution\nbased service system.  In order to develop and manage quality community\nprograms, a management component must be included in the planning design.\nPortions of this component like the direct care components, should be\npurchased through contract mechanisms.  An outline of such a component,\nvith a specific description of the organizational structure, is attached.\n(203)\n\nPage 2\nII.  The Providers\nIt is expected that the actual provision of services will be done\nchiefly through private nonprofit corporations experienced In design-\ning and implementing residential and non-residential programs for\nmentally disabled persons.  The Department will contract with these\nIndependent providers pursuant to standard RFP procedures and reg-\nulations established by the Office of Administration and Finance.\nIt is estimated that there are on the average, 40 contracts per\narea and 200 contracts regios-wide. in Region I, totalling roughly\n$8 million dollars.  Implementation of this plan might double their\nnumber and/or size.  This increase in Area and Regional responsibility\ncannot be over emphasized.  Area and Regional Offices provide tech-\nnical assistance to vendors in developing their proposals and monitor\ncontract operations In order to ensure that all programs are compliant\nwith State regulations and are an integral part of a comprehensive\nsystem.  If an Area elects to become a primary service provider for\nsome of its clients, the management component must be modified\naccordingly.  In certain cases, the Regional Office may also pro-\nvide services for high risk/low incidence clients in inter-area\nprograms.  This should be reflected in Regional Office structure\nand staffing.\n(204)\n\nPage 3\nIII.  General Description of Functions, Management Areas and Activities\nAlthough Regional and Area Offices address very different levels\nof operations, both must have the ability to perform two types of\nfunctions:  planning and development and monitoring and coordination.\nThese functions must be performed in three management areas:  pro-\ngram management, fiscal and personnel management, and information\nmanagement.  Table I shows the matrix of functions by management\nareas and lists the major types of activities associated with each\ncombination of function and management area.  A general descrip-\ntion of these activities follows which does not detail the dif-\nference between regional and area activities.  However in sections\n17 and V Area and Regional Office activities are specified separately.\nA.  Program Management\nWithin the program management area three activities re-\nflect the planning and development funtion.  System and program develop-\nment refers to planning a community care system, including residen-\ntial and non-residential programs and linkages to generic services.\nThis activity also includes developing vendors and agencies and pro-\nviding technical assistance in drafting proposals.  Staff train-\ning and development involves insuring that adequately trained\nmanpower is available to meet program needs.  Community develop-\nment consists of working with citizen boards and councils to\nfacilitate community acceptance and client integration.  This is\ndone by educating citizens and developing local leadership.\n(205)\n\nTable I.

System and program coordination in-\ncludes developing functional linkages between programs, facilitating the\nsharing of information when appropriate, supervising the transition of\nservices from institutions to communities and ensuring that clients con-\ntinue to move through community programs towards less restricitve, more\nindependent living with appropriate continuity of care.  Legal services\ndiffer from the area to the regional level.\nAt the regional level\nlegal services consist of legal counsel to the Regional and Area offices.\nProgram monitoring occurs primarily at the area level.  It involves over-\nseeing the community care system.  This includes reviewing and approving\nvendor contracts, ensuring contract compliance through periodic reviews\nof programs and technical assistance in the implementation of \"plans of\ncorrection\" in cases of non-compliance.  Prograa monitoring also includes\nreviewing and resolving any complaints by clients or advocates against il\nprograms.1  Quality assurance is primarily a regional function although\nArea Office staff will participate.  This activity involves annual re-\nviews of programs to assure compliance with program and professional\nstandards.  It is a crucial activity in setting the staff for program\nmonitoring.\n^This document does not address but recognizes an important role for\nconsumers in program evaluation.\n(207)\n\nPage 6\nB.  Fiscal and Personnel Management\nthere are four activities associated with the planning and\ndevelopment function within the area of fiscal and personnel management.\nBudget development and contracting refer to the process by which dollars\nare assigned to accounts and vendors in compliance with state laws and re-\ngulations.  Contract development can extend to assisting providers in\nwriting contracts.  Spending and revenue planning involves establishing\nexpenditure schedules and strategies for generating revenues so that\nprograms can operate uninterrupted by issues of fiscal solvency.\nThe monitoring and coordination function is reflected in three\nactivities in the fiscal and personnel management area. Expenditure and\nrevenue monitoring refer to tracking spending and revenues to ensure\ncompliance with spending and revenue plans.  A goal of such monitoring is\nto uncover variances from plans while there is time to correct them.\nAuditing involves monitoring contracts to ensure that vendors are oper-\nating in compliance with state fiscal regulations  and laws.  Personnel\nmanagement and affirmative action involves facilitating the recruitment,\nhiring, development and maintenance of an appropriately skilled and\nmotivated workforce composed of minority employees to a degree consis-\ntent with affirmative action guidelines.\nC.  Information Management\nIn the information management area there are three planning\nand development related functions.  Long range planning consists of the\ndevelopment of explicit goals for clients and programs within a 3 to5\nyear planning horizon.  This goal setting is a key area of citizen in-\nvolvement.  (208)\n\nPage 7\nIt is also a component reguixed in most federal grant proposals and\nincreasingly in state health and social service planning.  Annual planning\ninvolves devising strategies for allocating dollars to programs.  These\nplans are the basis for budget development.  Research for program develop-\nment includes needs assessment and evaluation research designed to\nprovide information as to what client needs are and what programs most\nsuccessfully meet them.  This information is necessary for deciding\nwhat programs to develop, and/or fund,  it also provides back up for\nfederal grants, determination of need procedures, etc.\nFinally, within the information management area two activities\nrelate to monitoring and coordination.  The first is developing and\nmaintaining client, personnel, fiscal and service management information\nsystems.  These systems information as to:  types and quantities of\nservices provided; numbers and types of clients served; staffing pat-\nterns and activities; costs.  Such information is basic to most manage-\nment activities.  The second is program evaluation and research.  This\nactivity provides information as how well different services work for\ndifferent clients.  This information is the key to system and program\nplanning.\n(209)\n\nPage 8\nIV.  The Area Office\nThe primary responsibility for designing and supervising the com-\nmunity care delivery system lies with the Area Office.  Table II shows\nhow the activities just described translate into specific Area Office\nstaffing and activities in support of programs for clients in the North-\nampton class.  The number of area staff required for management support\nof programs for all area clients would be between 2 and 2?j times the\nnumber shown (e.g.:  mentally retarded persons, children and adolescents,\nsubstance abusers, adults with mental health problems, but not at risk of\nstate hospitalization, etc.).  This table also shows which of the positions\nrequired exist and which do .  Table III depicts the organization\n noC\nchart for the area positions listed in Table II.\nTable IV summarizes the Information on Area Office staffing and\npresides cost information.  This cost Information includes salaries,\nfringe benefits at 18%, support costs at 15%, and 40% of electronic data\nprocessing costs of $10,000.00 per area.  The support costs are set at\n15% rather than 20% (the figure used for direct care programs), because\nArea Offices already exist and have certain support equipment and supplies.\nThe data processing costs cover terminal rental at $250.00 per month\nto permit decentralized data entry and report generation, at $585.00\nper month for computer time and telephone costs.  The information on costs\nmay be summarized as follows:\nPositions (Poa.): 6.9\nSalaries: 94,450-\nFringe benefits ยง 13%: 15,921\nSupport costs  0 15%: 17,267\n$ 127,638\nTotal  :\nx 5 Areas  : $ 638,190\n(210)\n\nAKEA STAFF AHO ACTIVITIES\nOrgaiiir.ntion.il  Unit Tonition flFTE's  ([Exist.

The Regional Office  89e\nThe ultimate responsibility for the proper design and functioning\nof a quality system of community programs rests with the Regional office.\nIn the abstract, the Regional Office must have capacities that are timi-\nlar to the areas.  However, concretely regional activities deal with diff-\nerent levels of operation than do Area  Offices.  For example, Regional\nand Area Offices both monitor programs.  However, the Area Office does\n\"hands-on\" day to day monitoring while the Regional' Office does quality\nassurance once per year.\nTable V shows the concrete activities performed in the Regional\nOffice and how these translate into regional staffing needs for the\npurposes of the suit.  Once again management support for programs for\nall regional clients would require approximately 2-2*1 times the numbers\nregional staff shown.  Table VI depicts the Regional Table of Organization.\nTable VII summarizes this information and shows staffing costs.  The cost\ninformation in Table VI is the same as in Table IV.

Introduction\n. The documents in Phase I of the planning process designed\na. range of residential and nonresidential program models and\ndetermined the actual number of placements which must be created\nin each of those models to meet the needs of the members of the\n-plaintiff class.  The Summary of Principles and Conclusions of\n; Phase I correlated all planning documents and estimated the total\nI cost for creating and maintaining a system of community mental\nhealth services for a specific portion of the plaintiff class\nwho were hospitalized in a given two year period (planning\npopulation).  Given the fact that some of the programs needed\nby the planning population already existed, although not necessarily\nin a form comparable to the relevant model, it thus was necessary\nto assess the capacity and adequacy of existing programs to serve\nthis planning population.  The resultant information could then\nbe used to determine the actual number of new residential and\nnonresidential placements which must be created and the extent\nto which existing programs must be upgraded to satisfy the\nplaintiffs' needs as set forth in the Phase I planning documents.\n(221)\n\nII.  The Process\nAfter extensive discussion of various assessment tech-\nniques, a process was developed over several months to generate\nand analyze relevant data on the capacity and adequacy of existing\nprograms.  It was recognized at the outset that even an extensive\nresearch project using sophisticated computer methodologies\nwould not be significantly more reliable than information\ngathered through individual interviews and analysis of existing\ncontracts due to the limits on the type and accessibility of\ninformation maintained by community service providers.  Therefore,\na two step process was adopted which initially determined the\ncapacity of existing programs to serve members of the planning\npopulation and which subsequently analyzed this data in light\nof the program models to assess their adequacy.\nThe data gathering phase of this process began with a\nreview of all mental health programs funded in whole or in part\nby. the Department of Mental Health.  Through a series of questions\naddressed to each Area Director in separate interviews (see\nAppendix A), the programs in each Area which significantly serve\nmembers of the planning population were delineated and their\nactual client capacity determined.  A list of all relevant pro-\ngrams, by Area, and their capacity to serve the planning population\nwas then compiled for review and certification by the Regional\nServices Administrator.  It was recognized that this approach\nnot only provided a reliable measure of the extent of services\n(222)\n\noffered by existing programs to the most disabled population,\nbut also created a standard against which all programs and Area\nmanagers could be held accountable in the future.\nAn adequacy assessment instrument to collect information\nas to each program's personnel and fiscal resources was then\ncarefully drafted, discussed, and finalized (see Appendix B).\nFor each program determined to significantly serve the planning\npopulation a separate staff and funding survey form was completed,\neither by the 'Area Director based on a review of contracts and\nother Department statistics or through a formal site visit to\nthe service provider by the Area Director, Regional Office\nstaff person, and a representative of the plaintiffs.  Using this\nsurvey instrument, accurate information was generated as to the\nstaff and fiscal resources of existing community programs which\nare available to deliver each of the model residential and non-\nresidential services described in the planning documents.\nTo summarize and analyze this data, two formats were\ncreated (see Appendix C).  The first described all available\nresources in Region I for each residential and nonresidential\nservice and then assessed the adequacy of existing programs\nproviding that service by comparing the available resources with\nthe standards set forth in the planning documents.  This compari-\nson was done not only for present resources, but also for\nanticipated program resources included in the new FY'79 budget,\nas approved, and the FY'80 budget, as requested by che Department.\nThe second format compiled the adequacy conclusions for each\n(223)\n\nservice and presented a composite description of the adequacy\nof all existing residential and nonresidential services.  This\nsummary was again done for present resources, approved FY*79\nprograms, and requested FY'80 programs.  The resultant data\nanalysis, a summary of which is attached as Appendix D,\nprovides a clear picture of which program models exist in\nRegion I, and the capacity and adequacy of those programs to\nserve members of the planning population.\nIII.  Conclusion\nBased on the carefully devised process for gathering and\nanalyzing information with respect to the capacity and adequacy\nof existing community programs, several conclusions emerge:\n1.  There is no unused capacity in existing programs to\nserve the present residents of the Hospital.  There-\nfore, further census reduction in conformity with\nthe residential and nonresidential placement recom-\nmendations set forth in the planning documents, can\nonly be accomplished through the creation of new pro-\ngrams or the expansion of existing programs to serve\nthese members of the planning population.\n2.  There are several residential and nonresidential\nprograms which have the capacity to serve a specific\nportion of the planning population but which are\ninadequate, as compared to the planning documents,\n(224)\n\nto meet the needs of the members of the planning\npopulation living in the community who participate\nin these programs.  The projected cost of upgrading\nthese programs for community clients is $2,801,506.\n3.  There are other residential and nonresidential programs\nwhich are entirely absent or only minimally avail-\nable in most Areas in Region I, and which therefore\nmust be newly created to serve the members of the\nplanning population living in the community who need\nsuch programs. The projected cost of creating or\nexpanding these programs for community clients is\n$3,812,077.\nThus these conclusions indicate that the residential and\nnonresidential programs which now exist in Region I are sub-\nstantially inadequate to serve the 1755 members of the planning\npopulation not presently institutionalized at the Northampton\nState Hospital.  The total cost of upgrading these programs to\nprovide adequate treatment in appropriate less restrictive\nalternatives for these persons is $6,613,583.  Some but not all\nof these costs include federal reimbursements under Titles XIX\nand XX of the Social Security Act, which would be significant\nfor many nonresidential programs.\nTherefore, in order to reduce 607. of this inadequacy in\nexisting programs during FY'80, it will require $2,933,421\nduring that year (see Appendix E).  A significant portion of\n(225)\n\nthis cost ($1,404,341) is already included in and has been\napproved as part of the Region I budget request for FY'80.\nTo eliminate the remaining inadequacy during FY'8l, it will\ncost $1,772,440 during that year.\n(226)\n\nAPPENDIX A\nFOR MEETING OF 9/8/78\nMethodology for identifying existing community mental health services funded fully\nor partially by D.M.H. and for determining the extent to which these programs meet\nthe needs of the plaintiffs' class members as set forth in the summary and documents\nof Phase I of the planning process.\nFILTERING QUESTIONS\n1.  Does the reporting unit or agency operate at more than a minimum level at least\none program described in the residential or non-residential program models?  If\nso, uhich program (use Appendix A).\nYes\n2.  Is the program significantly designed and funded, pursuant to State Plan,\npolicy, or assurances made in other litigation to serve a client population\nother than the members of the class as defined in the planning documents?\nNo\n3.  Is the program designed and funded to significantly serve members of the\nplanning population, as opposed to other members of the plaintiff class\n(See Appendix B for description of the planning population).\nYes\nRepeat above procedure for all RUs corresponding to F.Y.'79 for funding.\nNew programs funded for F.Y.'79, new programs requested for F.Y.'SO.\nADEQUACY QUESTIONS\n*ยป.  What is the full capacity of the program and what percentage is designed\nand funded to service the planning population?  (See Appendix C for capacity\nformat).\n5.  What is the level of D.M.H. and non-D.H.H. funding?\n6.  Uhat is the total number of staff and hou are they assigned to the program\nunder consideration.  Uhat is the resultant staff/client ratio?\n(227)\n\nDIRECTIOWS APPENDIX B\nThis packet includes this coversheet, a Staffing Form, a Funding Form\nand an Appendix of Staff Discipline Codes.  All programs being surveyed\nare assumed to fall into one of four Qeneral categories.\nCategory 1\nThe program is equal to the agency for budget and staffing.\nCategory 2\nThe program is not equal to the total agency, but staff and budget\nare distinct in all but administrative overhead.\nCategory 3\nThe program is not equal to the agency.  There is staff sharing but\nallocation of staff time to each program is clearly predetermined by\nagency policy and procedure.\nCategory *ยป\nThe program is not equal to the agency.  There is a staff and/or\nbudget sharing that is not administratively predetermined.  This\ncategory would include all cases that do not fall into any of\ncategories 1, 2 or 3 above.\nThe rules for applying the Funding and Staffing Forms to the four (k)\ncategories are presented belou:\nCatecorv Number Staffino Funding\n1 Columns 1 through 3 Columns 1 through *ยป\nand 6\n2 Columns 1 through 3 Columns 1 through 5\nand 6\n3 .

Column 2 - FTE - is mandatory for computing Column 6 (Cost of Staff\nPerson to Program)  S = 2x  3(salary)\n2.  If 2 is not available, than Columns k and 5 in regard to assigned\nhours must be computed.\nThus  4 + 5 = 2,\nThen  2 x3  = 6\n\nDIRECTIONS  CONT'D PAGE 2\nFunding Form\n1.  Columns 3, *ยป and 5 should be equal to Column 1\n2.  Columns 8 and 9 should be equal to Column 6\n3.

Commw. of Mass\nโขHIIllI\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nDISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\nDAVID BREWSTER, etal.,  )\nPlaintiffs  )\n)\nv.  )  CIVIL ACTION NO. 76-4423-F\n)\nMICHAEL S. DUKAKIS, et al.,)\nDefendants  )\nFINDINGS AND ORDER\nMarch 19, 1981\nFREEDMAN, D.J.\nBased on the hearing held on March 16, 1981, this\nCourt makes the following findings:\n1.  The defendants have failed to comply with\nParagraphs 24 and 47 of the Consent Decree entered in this\nmatter, due to their failure to take effective measures to\nsecure timely release of funds for programs required by the\nDecree.  The absence of effective coordination among the\ndefendants in assembling documentation required by the legis-\nlature has resulted in substantial delays in release of funds\nheld in certain legislative supplementary accounts and\ntargeted for Consent Decree programs.\n2.  The efforts made by the defendants to access these\nfunds were drastically complicated by vague and unnecessarily\nrestrictive language imposed by legislative committees\nlimiting access to Consent Decree supplementary accounts.\n3.  Although staff members connected with the House\nWays and Means Committee were requested, by Order of this\nCourt, to attend the hearing to provide the Court with necessary\ninformation regarding the processes of the House Ways and Means\nCommittee, no representative staff members for that Committee\nappeared.  Staff members and counsel from the Senate Ways\nand Means Committee did appear.\nn\n\n4.  The delays in coordinating submission of docu-\nmentation to the legislature by the defendants resulted in\nlate release of funds contained in the 5 OJ. 1^9.006 account,\nearmarked for improvement in the existing community mental\nhealth system and specifically required by Paragraph 19 of the\nDecree.  As a result of delays in release of funds from this\naccount, members of the plaintiff class were unnecessarily\nhospitalized and denied their right to placement in less\nrestrictive community settings, as required by the Decree.\n5.  As a result of the lack of coordination by the\ndefendants, and the unnecessarily restrictive language imposed\nby the legislature limiting access, approximately $2.6 million\ncontained in the 5100-0101 supplementary account is currently\nbeing withheld from the community mental health system.\n6.  Without these funds, the local Department of\nMental Health administrators will be unable to pay community\nmental health providers through the end of this fiscal year.\nIn addition, a number of providers with short funded contracts,\nor with personnel transferred from state slots to contract\npositions, will begin running out of money as early as April\n30,  1981.\n7.  The plan proposed by the defendant Executive\nOffice of Human Services to avoid the destructive ramifications\nof the failure to obtain release of the 5100-0101 funds is\nwholly inadequate to prevent harm to the plaintiff class.  The\nuse of so-called reversions from one account to absorb shortages\nin another account requires a protracted process of contract\namendment, negotiation with and active cooperation from private\nmental health agencies and processing of dozens of such amend-\nments through the elaborate state bureaucracy.  Representatives\nof several agencies whose cooperation would be critical to the\namendment process necessary to generate reversions indicated\nan unwillingness to be involved in this process.  Dependency\n- 2 -\n\non reversions for program funding has, in addition, caused\nconsiderable delay and harm to members of the plaintiff class\nwhen used in the past.  Finally, the use of the reversion\nprocess will not generate sufficient funds to offset existing\nshortages.\n8.  The defendants have violated Paragraph 20 of\nthe Consent Decree, and the subsequent agreed upon recommenda-\ntions of the Monitor to implement this Paragraph, by failing\nto approve in a timely manner contracts for several mentally\nretarded persons currently at Northampton State Hospital and\nto be served by the Franklin/Hampshire Area Office of Region\nOne of the Department of Mental Health.\n9.  The delays in accessing funds from the 5011-9006\naccount intended to upgrade existing community programs and\ncreate necessary new programmatic services may without\nprompt action result in an inability by the Department of\nMental Health to spend these monies in an effective, timely\nand positive manner.\n10.  The additional requirements for numerous adminis-\ntrative reports both to the legislature and to the Central\nOffice of the Department of Mental Health has placed demands\non the Office of Region One of the Department of Mental Health\nthat cannot be met by current personnel resources without harm\nto members of the plaintiff class.  Reporting requirements are\nforcing regional administrative personnel to abbreviate their\nprogrammatic efforts.\nBased on the preceding findings of fact, the Court\nhereby ORDERS:\n1.  That the defendants submit no later than April\n17,  1981 a plan for productive and effective expenditure of\nall funds contained in the 5011-9006 account, assuring that\nno portion of these funds is reverted tojthe^ general funds but\nis invested effectively in improving existing community mental\n- 3 -\n\nhealth services as required by Paragraph 19 of theJDecree.\n2.  That the defendants submit to this Court no\nlater than July 31, 1981 an accounting specifying details\nregarding all expenditures out of the 5011-9006 account.\n3.  That the defendants take all action legally\npermitted to insure retroactive payment to private contract\nagencies who have incurred expenses for members of the plaintiff\nclass subject to reimbursement from the 5011-9006 account.\n4.  That the defendants, no later than April 3, 1981,\napprove all contracts submitted prior to the date of this\nOrder for programs to serve members of the plaintiff class\nin Region One of the Department of Mental Health,  or .report\nv\nto the Court in writing as to each contract not approved\nthe legal or administrative reasons which require denial of\napproval.\n5.  That the defendants submit to the Court in writing\nno later than April 10, 1981 a plan for increasing the adminis-\ntrative staff of Region One of the Department of Mental Health\nto carry out the reporting and statistical demands of the legis-\nlature and the Central Office of the Department of Mental Health,\nto insure that no member of the plaintiff class is harmed by\n^draining of resources away from program development.\n6.  That the defendants are hereby enjoined forthwith\nfrom employing contract reversions to make up for funding\nshortages caused by their failure to obtain timely release of\nfunds in the 5100-0101 supplementary budget account.\n7.  That the defendants, no later than April 10, 1981,\nresubmit a request to the appropriate legislative committees\nfor release of the necessary funds from the 5100-0101 account.\nThe defendants will, prior to that date, meet with the legis-\nlative committees and ascertain precisely what documentation is\nrequired by the committees to obtain release of these funds.\nThe defendants will further communicate to the legislature the\n- 4 -\n\nfindings of this Court related to the effect of the vague\nand restrictive language attached to this account and the Order\nof this Court preventing use by the defendants of any reversions\nto make up for funding shortages caused by the failure to re-\nlease funds from the 5100-0101 account.  The defendants will\nfurther communicate to the legislative committees the willing-\nness of this Court, and of this Court's appointed Monitor, to\nassure the legislative committees of oversight and accounting\nrequirements to prevent any waste of released funds.\n8.  That the defendants, no later than fourteen  (14)\ndays after release of funds from the 5100-0101 account, submit\nto this Court a written plan specifying all expected expendi-\ntures to be made from this account.  The defendants will also\nprovide this Court, no later than July 31, 1981, with an\naccounting of all expenditures made from this account.\nAll until further Order of this Court.\nUnited States District Judge\n- 5 -",

In addition, since the time \npermitted Grant to believe up to and includ  for  specific  performance  of  the  contract \ning the time of closing that the lease back  during the winter of 1981-82 has passed, it \nset forth in the May 7 letter was agreed to.  would  tentatively seem that damages,  at \nFurther, while Arendsee and others on the  best  as  they  can  be  measured,  for  that \npurchasing side may not like certain of the  period should be awarded to OLI in order to \ncontemplated promotions and other activi  make OLI whole.
