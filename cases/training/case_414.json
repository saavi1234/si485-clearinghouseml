    "summary": "<p>On December 2, 1986, an involuntarily committed patient at the Massachusetts Treatment Center for the Sexually Dangerous (the \"Center\") filed a lawsuit under state contract law against Massachusetts Department of Mental Health (DMH) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, Boston Division.  The plaintiff, represented at first by himself and later by private counsel, asked the court for injunctive relief, alleging that the defendants violated his federal constitutional rights by failing to provide him with minimally adequate treatment.  Specifically, the plaintiff contended that the defendants persisted in rigidly applying the Center's rules and policies to him, despite the defendants' actual knowledge that the strict enforcement of those rules and policies interfered with his ability to respond to treatment.</p><p>Previously, in 1978, the plaintiff pled guilty to charges of rape in Vermont and Massachusetts.  In 1984, while serving at MCI Walpole, the plaintiff was adjudged a sexually dangerous person and committed to the Center in November 1985.  The plaintiff's criminal sentence expired on February 15, 1992.</p><p>After a six-day nonjury trial that commenced November 1991 and ended in January 1992, on February 14, 1992, the District Court (Judge Robert E. Keeton) found for the plaintiff.  Cameron v. Tomes, 783 F. Supp. 1511 (D. Mass. 1992).  The Court held that rigid application of some of the Center's rules and policies was an unconstitutional failure to exercise professional judgment. The Court (a) ordered the Restrictive Integration Review Board to review the plaintiff's commitment to the Center to determine appropriate conditions of confinement and evaluate his current sexual dangerousness, (b) required the defendants to allow the plaintiff to receive treatment from the Veterans Administration for a list of ailments, (c) enjoined the defendants from transporting the plaintiff by armed correctional officers and in shackles, (d) required that a qualified decision-maker consider the plaintiff's appointment requests, (e) enjoined the defendants from using the \"Extraction Team\" against the plaintiff without consulting a clinician, (f) enjoined the defendants from enforcing the current disciplinary system, (g) enjoined the defendants from conducting oral cavity searches, (h) enjoined any requirement of double-bunking, and (i) required the defendants to modify a handicapped accessible room to provide reasonable space for the plaintiff to use his wheelchair and walker.  The defendants appealed.</p><p>On March 31, 1993, the First Circuit Court of Appeals (Judge Michael Boudin) modified and affirmed the District Court's February 14, 1992, order.  Cameron v. Tomes, 990 F.2d 14 (1st Cir. 1993).  The Court held that the plaintiff was entitled to injunctive relief requiring reappraisal of his personal dangerousness and of the general conditions of his confinement.  The Court adjusted and delimited the future effects of the District Court's injunction by removing the transportation security provisions as well as those enjoining the Center from enforcing the current disciplinary system.</p><p>We have no more information on this file.</p><p></p>",

Bureau, Elisabeth J. Medvedow, Atty. General's Office, Crim.\nBureau, Boston, Mass., for defendants.\nOPINION\nKEETON, District Judge.\nThis action for equitable relief is brought by a patient involuntarily committed to the Massachusetts Treatment\nCenter for the Sexually Dangerous (\"Center\"). Plaintiff Robert Cameron (\"Cameron\") alleges that defendants\nhave violated his federal constitutional rights by failing to provide him with minimally adequate treatment. In\nparticular, Cameron contends that defendants persist in rigidly applying the Center's rules and policies to him,\ndespite defendants' actual knowledge that the strict enforcement of those rules and policies interferes with\nCameron's ability to respond to treatment. The court conducted a six-day nonjury trial that commenced in\nNovember 1991 and ended in January 1992.\nI. Background\nOn December 13, 1978 Cameron pled guilty in Vermont to charges of rape. He was subsequently extradited to\nMassachusetts in June of 1979 to plead guilty to a similar crime. In 1983 Cameron was paroled from his Vermont\nsentence and transferred to Massachusetts to begin serving his Massachusetts sentence at MCI Walpole. On\nJune 29, 1984, Cameron was adjudged a sexually dangerous person based on the fact that he had been\nconvicted of two separate violent sexual assaults. Plaintiff's Exhibit 1. He was committed to the Center on\nNovember 14, 1985, as a Sexually Dangerous Person for a term of one day to life, pursuant to Mass.Gen.L. ch.\n123A, § 6, as the law then existed.\nAt the time of trial the Center had a patient population of 232 men, all whom have been adjudged sexually\ndangerous. Most of these men have underlying criminal convictions. As a result, the Center is operated jointly by\nthe Department of Mental Health and the Department of Correction. Cameron's time at the Center is applied to\nhis criminal sentence. See Langton v. Johnston, 928 F.2d 1206, 1210 n. 4 (1st Cir.1991). His criminal sentence\nexpires on February 15, 1992.\n1515  II. Constitutional Rights of the Involuntarily Committed\n*1515\nIn Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982), the Supreme Court held that\ninvoluntarily committed mentally retarded persons enjoy the right, under the due process clause of the fourteenth\namendment, to safe conditions of confinement, id. at 315-16, 102 S.Ct. at 2458, the right to freedom from\nunnecessary bodily restraint, id. at 316, 102 S.Ct. at 2458, and the right to such minimally adequate treatment\n\nand training as is reasonably necessary to protect those interests. Id. at 319, 102 S.Ct. at 2460. A patient does\nnot have a constitutional right to an ideal environment or an ideal treatment plan, or even a guarantee that the\npatient will be cured. See Doe v. Gaughan, 808 F.2d 871, 886 (1st Cir.1986) (quoting Doe by Roe v. Gaughan,\n617 F.Supp. 1477, 1487-88 (D.Mass.1985)); Ohlinger v. Watson, 652 F.2d 775, 779 (9th Cir.1980). Rather, the\ninvoluntarily committed have the constitutional right\n\"to minimally adequate habilitation ... which will tend to render unnecessary the use of chemical\nrestraint, shackles, solitary confinement, locked wards, or prolonged isolation from one's normal\ncommunity; and conditions of life which are normal enough to promote rather than detract from\none's chances of living with fewer restrictions on one's movement.\"\nMihalcik v. Lensink, 732 F.Supp. 299, 303 (D.Conn.1990) (quoting Thomas S. by Brooks, v. Flaherty, 699 F.Supp.\n1178, 1200-01 (W.D.N.C.1988),aff'd,902 F.2d 250 (4th Cir.1990)) (emphasis in original). The First Circuit has\napplied the Youngberg test to involuntarily committed persons in general, rather than limiting Youngberg to\nmentally retarded persons. See Doe, 808 F.2d at 871.\nWhether a patient's due process rights have been violated necessarily depends upon a weighing of his liberty\ninterests against relevant state interests. Id. at 321, 102 S.Ct. at 2461. Accordingly, the Youngberg Court\nestablished a deferential standard, holding that \"the Constitution only requires that the courts make certain that\nprofessional judgment in fact was exercised. It is not appropriate for the courts to specify which of several\nprofessionally acceptable choices should have been made.\" Id. Thus the question is \"not what treatment was\nactually provided, but whether the treatment decision was professionally made and falls within the scope of\nprofessional acceptability.\" Woe v. Cuomo, 729 F.2d 96, 105 (2nd Cir.),cert. denied,469 U.S. 936, 105 S.Ct. 339,\n83 L.Ed.2d 274 (1984). However, only decisions that are made by the \"appropriate professional\" are entitled to a\npresumption of correctness. Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 324, 102 S.Ct. at 2462.\nIn addition, under the eighth and fourteenth amendments a state may not show \"deliberate indifference\" to an\ninmate's mental health needs. See Cortenes-Quinones v. Jimenz-Nettleship, 842 F.2d 556, 558, 560 (1st Cir.),\ncert. denied,488 U.S. 823, 109 S.Ct. 68, 102 L.Ed.2d 45 (1988). \"The extension of the eighth amendment's\nprotection from physical health needs ... to mental health needs is appropriate because, as courts have noted,\nthere is `[n]o underlying distinction between the right to medical care for physical ills and its psychological or\npsychiatric counterpart.'\" Torraco v. Maloney, 923 F.2d 231, 234 (1st Cir.1991) (emphasis in original). The\ndeliberate indifference standard has been held to apply to pretrial detainees who have not been convicted and\nmay not be punished. The jail officials \"violate the due process rights of their detainees if they exhibit a deliberate\nindifference to the medical needs of the detainees that is tantamount to an intent to punish.\" Danese v. Asman,\n875 F.2d 1239, 1243 (6th Cir.1989),cert. denied,494 U.S. 1027, 110 S.Ct. 1473, 108 L.Ed.2d 610 (1990).\nIf Cameron can show that the Center was deliberately indifferent to his mental health needs while he was\ninvoluntarily committed for treatment 00 not punishment 00 then a fortiori he has shown that the Center violated the\n97 97\nYoungberg standard. This is because persons \"who have been involuntarily committed are entitled to more\n1516 considerate treatment and conditions *1516 of confinement than criminals whose conditions of confinement are\ndesigned to punish.\" Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 322, 102 S.Ct. at 2461. A state's decisions about the treatment of an\ninvoluntarily committed patient cannot be constitutionally sufficient if in making them the state has shown\ndeliberate indifference to the patient's mental health needs.\nCameron argues that defendants are violating his constitutional rights because he is not receiving minimally\nadequate treatment at the Center. In particular, he contends that he cannot be treated at the Center because the\nconfrontational and prison-like management of the Center harms his ability to respond to treatment and thus\ninhibits treatment. For the reasons explained below, I find that in certain instances the Center has failed to\nprovide Cameron with the standard of treatment required by Youngberg. Moreover, I find that in certain areas the\nCenter has even acted with deliberate indifference to Cameron's mental health needs.\n\nIII. Defendants' Motion For Directed Verdict\nAt the close of the evidence defendants moved to dismiss the action pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(c) on two\ngrounds. First, defendants contend that this action must be dismissed because there is no constitutional right to\npsychological or psychiatric treatment under the fourteenth amendment. As support for this contention\ndefendants cite Knight v. Mills, 836 F.2d 659 (1st Cir.1987). Second, defendants claim that Cameron's action is\nbarred by res judicata. In particular, defendants contend that Cameron's claims were adjudicated in Langton v.\nJohnston, 928 F.2d 1206 (1st Cir.1991), and thus are barred.\nA. Constitutional Right to Treatment\nDefendants contend that this action must be dismissed because Cameron does not have a constitutional right to\ntreatment. This contention must be rejected. First, as I stated in Part II, supra, the Supreme Court has recognized\nthat involuntarily committed patients do have a constitutional right to minimally adequate treatment based upon\nthe exercise of professional judgment. Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 322, 102 S.Ct. at 2461. Thus, although Cameron\nmay not have a right to any particular treatment 00 including psychological treatment 00 he does have a right to\n97 97\ntreatment that is based, at a minimum, on the exercise of professional judgment.\nSecond, Knight v. Mills, 836 F.2d 659 (1st Cir.1987), does not support defendants' contention that there is no\nconstitutional right to psychological or psychiatric treatment. In Knight a patient at the Treatment Center who, like\nCameron, had been involuntarily committed for a period of one-day-to-life as a sexually dangerous person,\nsought damages from officials at the Center on the ground that they had violated his right to treatment as\nestablished in Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715, 92 S.Ct. 1845, 32 L.Ed.2d 435 (1972). The court affirmed the\ndistrict court's dismissal of the plaintiff's claim on the ground that \"[t]he Supreme Court ... had not resolved the\nissue of a constitutional right to psychological treatment by 1981,\" and thus defendants were entitled to qualified\nimmunity. Knight, 836 F.2d at 668. Thus, the court did not hold that there is no constitutional right to treatment.\nMoreover, to the extent Knight can be read as holding that there is no constitutional right to psychological\ntreatment per se, Knight did not hold that there is no right to minimally adequate treatment as defined in \nYoungberg. A patient may still be entitled to psychological treatment to the extent it is required by the professional\njudgment standard of Youngberg. Accordingly, Knight does not require this court to dismiss Cameron's claims.\nB. Res Judicata\nDefendants next contend that Cameron's fourteenth amendment claim is barred by res judicata. In Langton v.\nJohnson, 928 F.2d 1206 (1st Cir.1991), patients at the Center sought to have the Commonwealth held in\ncontempt for failing to comply with a consent decree governing conditions at the facility. In particular, the plaintiffs\nalleged that the Center failed to (1) provide treatment sufficient to bring about the patients' recovery; (2)\n1517 administer *1517 the treatment actually furnished in the least restrictive manner consistent with security needs;\nand (3) operate the Treatment Center as a mental health facility rather than as a penal institution. In upholding\nthe district court's decision for defendants the First Circuit noted that a finding of compliance with the consent\ndecree was also a finding of compliance with constitutional requirements. Id. at 1217. Thus, defendants contend\nthat the First Circuit has already determined that Cameron's constitutional rights have not been violated.\nDefendants' reliance on Langton is misplaced. Although Cameron was a member of the plaintiff class in that\naction, there was no adjudication of his individual claims. Rather, in Langton the court determined that in general\nthe defendants were in substantial compliance with the consent decree. Moreover, Cameron's claim is that even\nassuming defendants are still in compliance with the consent decree, the defendants have violated his\nconstitutional right to minimally adequate treatment by ignoring his individual treatment needs, and instead\ntreating him in a manner that defendants know is harmful to him.\n\nThe Langton court did not even consider Cameron's individual claims. There was no evidence as to Cameron's\ndiagnosis. There was no evidence as to his treatment needs. There was no evidence that the Center was\nexercising professional judgment in its treatment of Cameron. In other words, although the court found that the\nCenter was in compliance with the consent decree in enacting certain security policies and regulations, there was\nno adjudication as to whether professional judgment was exercised in applying those policies and regulations to\nCameron. Accordingly, defendants' motion to dismiss is denied.\nIV. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\nThe evidence is uncontroverted that Cameron suffers from a borderline or mixed personality disorder and post-\ntraumatic stress disorder. There is also no dispute that as a result of Cameron's psychological disorders he may\noften act in a paranoid and confrontational manner.\nMichael Stevens is the assistant director of clinical programs at the Center and chairman of the Restrictive\nIntegration Review Board (\"RIRB\"). The RIRB annually reviews the records of each patient, determines whether\npatients are still considered sexually dangerous, and recommends whether patients should participate in\ncommunity access programs. Stevens testified that Cameron's pathology inhibits his ability to accept and remain\nin treatment. In his opinion, and in the opinion of the RIRB, Cameron needs to be treated based on a model that\nis nonchallenging and nonconfrontational.\nIn addition, Dr. Seghorn, an expert called by plaintiff, testified that any treatment program that emphasizes rigid\ncompliance, submission, and passivity would be harmful to Cameron, and that because of Cameron's pathology\nhe would be likely to overreact or misinterpret strict application of security rules. Gloria Berman, Cameron's\ntherapist, testified that when Cameron feels threatened it causes him to go back to several traumatic events in his\npast, making it difficult to treat him. The evidence thus showed that a confrontational, rigid approach to treating\nand training Cameron would not be effective, but rather would be harmful to his mental, and even physical health.\nCameron contends that although defendants are aware of his diagnosis and treatment needs, defendants\ncontinue to treat him in the confrontational and rigid approach that the Center's mental health professionals warn\nis unacceptable, and that this treatment decision is not based on the exercise of professional judgment, but rather\nis based on the inflexible application of policies and regulations without any consideration for Cameron's mental\nhealth. In addition, he asserts that the Center's persistent refusal to treat him in a manner consistent with the\nnonconfrontational model recommended by the Center's mental health professionals rises to the level of\n\"deliberate indifference\" to his mental health needs.\n1518 Cameron has presented the court with several examples of defendants' alleged unconstitutional *1518 actions. I\nwill consider each example separately to determine whether Cameron has met his burden of showing that\ndefendants have acted with \"deliberate indifference\" toward Cameron's mental health and/or have failed to\nexercise professional judgment in their treatment of Cameron.\nA. Access to Outside Medical Care\nOne of the main issues in this action is the defendants' refusal to permit Cameron to receive medical treatment\nfrom facilities other than the Center and its affiliated medical centers, except under rigidly restrictive conditions\nthat are not supported by professional judgment. In December of 1987 Cameron contracted blood poisoning in\nhis left foot. He was eventually taken to the Lemuel Shattuck Hospital (\"Shattuck Hospital\"). On March 7, 1988,\nCameron lost the large toe on his left foot. He returned to the Center on April 25 of that same year. On July 12,\n1989, Cameron's right leg became infected and he was again sent to Shattuck Hospital. His toes were amputated\nlater that month. His condition did not improve and on August 15, 1989, his right leg above the knee was\namputated. He was then returned to the Center's Hospital Services Unit where he remained at the time of trial.\nIn early 1990 and again in early 1991, Cameron applied to the Center's Authorized Absence or Community\nAccess program. Under the program patients accompanied by civilian staff are permitted to receive medical care\nfrom facilities outside the Center. In both 1990 and 1991 Cameron's Community Access Review Team (CART)\n\nrecommended Cameron's participation in the program. Gloria Berman, Cameron's therapist and the leader of the\nCART team, testified that she initiated Cameron's application for community access because he had serious\nmedical needs that had to be addressed before she could make any progress with his psychological problems.\nThese medical needs included possible treatment for suspected cancer, continued circulation problems, and a\nnew prosthesis. Plaintiff's Exhibit 22. There was also testimony that because Cameron was wary of the Center's\nmedical facilities due to his experience with losing his leg, he would not receive needed medical attention unless\nhe was permitted to participate in the program.\nNone of the mental health professionals who evaluated Cameron's request for community access in either 1990\nor 1991 felt that in receiving treatment through community access he would be a risk to the community. Both the\n1990 and 1991 CART reports stated that community access would have high treatment value for Cameron and\nthat he was not a risk to the community. In 1990 the CART report was unanimous. Plaintiff's Exhibit 14. In 1991\nthe only dissenting voice was that of an escort counselor. His report states that Cameron poses very little risk to\nthe community but that Cameron has a real sense of entitlement that bothered him and thus Cameron should be\ndenied community access. Plaintiff's Exhibit 22. The RIRB also recommended Cameron's participation in the plan\nin both 1990 and 1991. The Board consists of three outside consultants, one of whom must be an M.D.\npsychiatrist, two others who may be either clinical psychologists or psychiatrists, and two other members of the\nTreatment Center's clinical staff as well as the director of security for the Center. Michael Stevens, chairman of\nthe RIRB, testified that the Board's recommendation was unanimous in both years.\nThe Administrator of the Center makes the final decision on whether a patient may participate in the program. In\nboth 1990 and 1991 the Administrator refused to allow Cameron to participate in the program despite the strong\nrecommendations of the RIRB and CART team. Dr. Jurgela and Michael Stevens testified that the only reason for\nthe denial was that Center policy does not permit a patient to pursue his own medical treatment. This explanation\nis consistent with the memorandum that Ian Tink 00 the Administrator in 1990 00 wrote to Cameron to inform him\n97 97\nthat his application for community access had been denied. Defendants' Exhibit 118. First, the memorandum\nstates that Cameron's \"medical needs can best be addressed through the existing medical procedures at the\n1519 Treatment Center.\" Second, the memorandum *1519 states that he (Tink) could not ensure the safety of the\npublic based on Cameron's treatment status. The memorandum did not explain how Tink came to this conclusion\ndespite the unanimous conclusion of the RIRB and CART team that Cameron was not a risk. At trial Tink\nelaborated and stated that Cameron was a risk to the community because the Center's civilian staff is not well-\ntrained in security issues and there was no way to ensure that when Cameron was on community access he\nwould not have access to children. On his second day of testimony, Tink added that Cameron could become\nverbally assaultive.\nBased on the foregoing, I find that the Center has violated Cameron's due process right to minimally adequate\ntreatment aimed at reducing his time in restraint. The evidence was uncontroverted that Cameron's participation\nin the community access program would have high treatment value for Cameron's physical and mental health. In\nthe opinion of all the mental health staff professionals who evaluated Cameron's request, Cameron had serious\nmedical needs that needed to be addressed and could not be addressed if Cameron was not permitted to receive\ntreatment from an outside facility. In these professionals' judgment, the only appropriate response to Cameron's\nrefusal to receive medical care from the Center was to accommodate his request for outside treatment.\nDefendants failed to provide any evidence that their decision to deny Cameron the treatment unanimously\nrecommended by the Center's mental health professionals was professionally acceptable. First, although there\nwas no dispute that Cameron's 1991 application for community access was denied, defendants did not offer any\nevidence as to who made the 1991 decision 00 let alone any evidence as to the reason for the decision. Thus,\n97\ndefendants utterly failed to show that the 1991 decision to treat Cameron's medical needs in a way other than\nthat recommended by the RIRB and CART team was a decision based on the exercise of professional judgment.\nSecond, Ian Tink's explanation for his decision reveals his failure to exercise professional judgment. The exercise\nof professional judgment involves a weighing of the state's interests with the liberty interests of the patient. Tink\ndid not engage in any such weighing when he applied the Center's medical treatment policy to Cameron without\nany consideration of the unanimous recommendation of all the mental health professionals who reviewed\nCameron's request.\n\nTink's testimony that Cameron was a risk to the community because he would be near children in waiting rooms\ndemonstrates a similar failure to exercise professional judgment. The presence of children may indeed be a\nconcern for those patients at the Center who are pedophiles. However, defendants did not present a shred of\nevidence that Cameron is a threat to children. He has never been convicted or even suspected of abusing\nchildren. Thus the \"risk\" Tink allegedly based his decision upon lacks factual support. Moreover, the RIRB and\nCART team were all aware that Cameron can at times become verbally abusive, yet they did not find him to be a\nrisk. Tink did not explain on what he based his opposite conclusion. The evidence supports the finding that rather\nthan basing their decision to deny Cameron community access on the exercise of professional judgment,\ndefendants were engaging in an unnecessary and harmful battle over control of Cameron's medical treatment.\nCameron also contends that Leonard Mach, the acting Administrator of the Center, is not qualified to make the\nfinal decision regarding Cameron's participation in the community access program. In Youngberg the Court\nexplained that a professional decisionmaker is\na person competent, whether by education, training or experience, to make the particular decision\nat issue. Long-term treatment decisions normally should be made by persons with degrees in\nmedicine or nursing, or with appropriate training in such areas as psychology, physical therapy, or\nthe care and training of the retarded.\nYoungberg, 457 U.S. at 323 n. 30, 102 S.Ct. at 2462 n. 30. A decision about a patient's participation in a\n1520 community access program for medical or psychological care is a *1520 long-term treatment decision. Thus, if\nthe Center's Administrator makes the final decision regarding community access, then \"normally\" the\nAdministrator should be a person having a degree in medicine, nursing or psychology, or training in psychology,\ncounseling, or the care and training of the sexually dangerous. Moreover, even if some basis for departure from\nthe \"norm\" is shown, the Administrator is not free to act with disregard for the advice and judgment of\nappropriately qualified professionals.\nThese findings and conclusions support the judgment I reach in this case, and I explicitly do not make any finding\nabout the qualifications of the Center's present Administrator, Leonard Mach, who did not testify at this trial and\nas to whose qualifications to be the final arbiter of Cameron's long-term treatment needs inadequate evidence\nwas introduced at trial to support a finding.\nB. Transportation Under Armed Guard and in Shackles\nThe former Administrator Ian Tink further defended his decision to disregard the unanimous recommendation of\nthe RIRB and Cameron's CART team on the ground that Cameron is allowed to go to appointments at the VA, as\nlong as he is transported in the company of armed correctional officers. This explanation further reveals Tink's\nfailure to give due attention to the professional judgment of his advisers.\nFirst, as defendants brought to the attention of the court during cross-examination of Cameron, Cameron had to\ngo to court to get a mandatory injunction ordering the Center to allow him to receive medical care from the\nVeterans Administration.\nSecond, under Tink's orders, Cameron was only allowed to go to the VA under armed guard and shackled with\nwaist chains. Because Cameron only has one leg, and his prosthesis does not bend at the knee, he has to crawl\ninto the prison van used to transport him. Gloria Berman testified that being shackled and transported in the\nprison van is harmful to Cameron's mental health because of his psychological problems, most particularly his\npost traumatic stress disorder. Both Gloria Berman and Dr. Jurgela had felt it important enough that Cameron be\ntransported in a different way that they had offered to take him to his appointments themselves.\nBodily restraints are unconstitutional \"`except when and to the extent professional judgment deems this\nnecessary to assure ... safety or to provide needed training.'\" Shaw by Shaw v. Strackhouse, 920 F.2d 1135,\n1142 (3d Cir.1990) (quoting Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 324, 102 S.Ct. at 2462). According to the uncontroverted\nevidence at trial, not only is transporting Cameron under armed guard and in shackles unnecessary 00 it is\n97\nactually harmful to his treatment. The defendants, however, did not offer any testimony that could lead to the\n\ninference that in insisting that Cameron 00 an amputee 00 be transported in shackles in the company of armed\n97 97\ncorrectional officers, defendants exercised professional judgment.\nThe only evidence offered by defendants was that patients have tried to escape in the past and that some\npatients at the Center are violent. It is undisputed in this case that there was no evidence that Cameron had ever\nbeen violent or physically assaultive since his incarceration, or that he had ever attempted to escape. See Doe by\nRoe, 617 F.Supp. at 1487 (finding that restraint of a patient was constitutional because the patient was and\nremains \"an extremely assaultive, dangerous individual\"). The use of bodily restraints must be professionally\nacceptable for the individual patient being restrained. Because defendants did not present any evidence that\narmed correctional officers and shackles are necessary for Cameron, I find that defendants violated Cameron's\ndue process rights by insisting that he could receive outside medical care only if he was transported under armed\nguard and in waist shackles.\nThis finding, and the finding in Part III(A), do not require a conclusion that defendants must approve Cameron's\nparticipation in a particular program. However, if the Center ever does decide to restrict Cameron's liberty through\n1521 shackles and *1521 armed guard, or to deny him treatment that the Center's mental health professionals\ndetermine is appropriate, the decision must be supported by evidence that it is not being done as punishment,\nbut rather as an exercise of professional judgment as to how Cameron can be treated in a way that is consistent\nwith both his needs and the defendants' legitimate interests in security. Defendants have not presented any such\nevidence in this case.\nC. The Maximum Privilege Unit\nThe Treatment Center is divided into different living units with different levels of privilege, or, in other words,\ndifferent levels of restrictions. There are maximum, moderate and minimum privilege units. Certain programs are\navailable only to patients on certain units. For example, anger management therapy is available only to patients\non the maximum privilege unit. Ever since Cameron returned to the Center in the fall of 1989 after losing his leg,\nhe has been residing in the hospital unit. Gloria Berman testified that the hospital unit is more secure, and has\nfewer privileges, than the moderate privilege unit. In addition, there was testimony that, unlike the other units,\nthere is no therapist assigned to the hospital unit. Moreover, although at one time a hospital unit patient was\nallowed to \"satellite\" to other units to participate in its programs, satelliting is no longer allowed.\nDefendants do not contend that the hospital unit is a professionally acceptable placement for Cameron. Rather,\ndefendants contend that Cameron, although invited, has refused to move to the maximum privilege unit. Thus,\nthe argument goes, defendants cannot be unduly restricting Cameron's liberty if he refuses to avail himself of the\nmaximum privilege unit. I find, however, that defendants have not made the maximum privilege unit available to\nCameron.\nFirst, defendants require Cameron to sign an application for the maximum privilege unit that provides that he\nagrees to be double-bunked if necessary. Cameron has steadfastly refused to agree to double bunking because\nof his handicapped condition. Ian Tink and Dr. Yuri Amit testified that the double bunking requirement is not\nenforced, and in any event is voluntary. Cameron, however, presented credible documentary evidence that in\n1988 a patient was denied maximum privilege for the sole reason that the patient refused to agree to double\nbunk. Plaintiff's Exhibit 41. In addition, if not willfully confrontational, it is absurd for defendants to assert that\ndouble bunking is voluntary when they require, in order for a patient to be eligible for maximum privilege status,\nthat the patient formally consent to double bunking, even though they themselves offer evidence that they have a\npolicy and practice not to enforce the double-bunking condition. The application form for maximum privilege now\nin effect provides unequivocally that a patient must consent to doubling bunking. Plaintiff's Exhibit 40.\nSecond, in 1990, when Dr. Amit first invited Cameron to the maximum privilege unit, Cameron told Dr. Amit that\nhis wheelchair would not fit in the room. Cameron then requested that the furniture be cut so that he could fit\nunder the desk, have a closet, and move around with his wheelchair. Dr. Amit asked Cameron to give him a\ndiagram of how the room should be designed and Cameron did so in late 1990. In addition, Cameron testified\nthat he needs a hospital bed because of poor circulation in his leg. As of trial the Center had done nothing to\ncomply, even partially, with Cameron's request to modify his room or to move a hospital bed into the room.\n\nDr. Amit's testimony makes it clear that defendants have not even made an attempt to determine if Cameron can\nfunction in the room with his wheelchair. Dr. Amit testified that the day before his testimony he was shown the\nroom (apparently by a staff member) and was told that Cameron could not move around in his wheelchair, but\nthat he (Amit) was unable to determine whether this was true because it was dark. Thus it appears that in the\nyear since Dr. Amit had requested the proposed modifications from Cameron, up to the day before he testified,\nDr. Amit had not attempted to determine what changes would be needed to make a room suitable for a patient in\n1522 a wheelchair. Finally, no one at the Center has ever *1522 brought Cameron to the room to actually determine\nwhether he can function adequately in the room with his wheelchair.\nDefendants presented no evidence of any medical, psychological, or even security reason for leaving Cameron in\nthe high security, low privilege hospital unit where he has fewer opportunities for treatment, including no\nopportunity for anger management therapy, although both the RIRB and Dr. Jurgela have stated that anger\nmanagement is a necessary component of Cameron's treatment plan. See Clark v. Cohen, 613 F.Supp. 684, 704\n(E.D.Pa.1985) (holding that to be entitled to deference the treatment \"decision has to be based on medical or\npsychological criteria and not on exigency, administrative convenience, or other non-medical criteria\"), aff'd,794\nF.2d 79 (3d Cir.1986). I find that defendants have left Cameron in the hospital unit because they insist he consent\nto double bunking and because they refuse even to inquire about the need to make modifications to\naccommodate Cameron's disability.\nMoreover, by leading Cameron to believe that he must sign a double bunking form, and by refusing to make any\nmodifications to the room despite soliciting Cameron's suggestions over one year ago, defendants have treated\nCameron in precisely the confrontational, nonresponsive manner that defendants know is harmful to Cameron's\nmental health. This kind of administrative action constitutes a failure to exercise professional judgment at best,\nand deliberate indifference to Cameron's mental health needs at worst.\nD. Controlled Movement Regulations\nThe Center maintains a \"Controlled Movement Policy.\" The policy permits the patients to move around the Center\nfor ten minutes at the beginning of certain hours of the day. The rest of the hour the patients must remain where\nthey are, unless they have a special pass. In addition, they must sign out to where they are going and are strictly\nrequired to go to only that one place. If patients are discovered going somewhere other than to where they have\nsigned out, or if they take more than ten minutes to get there, they are subject to discipline.\nCameron presented testimony that the movement control policy is not therapeutic for Cameron, or indeed for any\nof the patients. I cannot find, however, that by applying the movement control policy to Cameron the Center has\nbeen deliberately indifferent to Cameron's mental health or that the Center has failed to exercise professional\njudgment. Michael Stevens, for example, testified that there is some training value in requiring Cameron to\ncomply with the policy. Thus, there was evidence that it is at least professionally acceptable to require Cameron\nto adhere to the regulations.\nI do find, however, that in applying the ten minute restriction to Cameron without any consideration for his\ndisability, defendants have failed to exercise professional judgment. Cameron testified that it is difficult for him to\nmake it to his job answering the telephones on the second floor within the allotted ten minutes because he needs\nto go up stairs. In addition, he testified that he has difficulty dropping off books at the library and then making it to\nhis assigned destination. This undue pressure upsets Cameron and compromises his treatment. Ian Tink, in\nresponse to a question from the court, testified that in developing the policy and the ten minute limitation, he and\nthe others involved did not consider the distinctive needs of disabled patients. Thus it is clear that even if\nprofessional judgment was exercised in adopting the policy, there was no judgment made as to its\nappropriateness for a patient with Cameron's disability and pathology.\nIn response, Ian Tink testified that Cameron chooses to use the stairs rather than to use the elevator. Thus, Tink\nconcluded, Cameron could easily get around in the allotted ten minutes if he was not so stubborn and would use\nthe elevator. Tink's response was less than candid. At trial the next day the defendants' next witness, Dr. Amit,\ntestified that in order to use an elevator a patient must find a sergeant 00 not just any correctional officer 00 with a\n97 97\n\nkey to the elevator who must then escort Cameron while he uses the elevator, because the elevator goes to\n1523 unsecure as well as secure *1523 floors. Dr. Amit's testimony made it perfectly clear why Cameron would choose\nto go up the stairs rather than take the elevator 00 he would seldom if ever be able to do all that is required to use\n97\nan elevator in the allotted ten minutes.\nTink's response to the court about the elevator is disturbingly characteristic of the Center's response to Cameron.\nRather than attempt to accommodate Cameron's mental and physical disabilities, the Center has taken an\nantagonistic attitude toward him 00 blaming everything on Cameron's stubbornness and declining to exercise the\n97\nprofessional judgment that would require some flexibility in the application of the Center's rules and policies, even\nthough the Center's mental health professionals have warned that such inflexibility is harmful to Cameron.\nE. Strip Search Policy\nIn 1986 Cameron refused to submit to a strip search after meeting with his attorney in the visiting room. As a\nresult, an \"extraction team\" was immediately called to the scene. The team consists of eight correctional officers\ndressed in black uniforms and riot gear. The officers proceeded to handcuff Cameron and take him to\nsequestration where his clothing was forcibly removed and he was restrained while the officers conducted an\nanal cavity search.\nThe incident had a debilitating effect on Cameron. A behavioral observation report from a few days later stated\nthat as a result of the incident Cameron's mood fluctuated from helplessness, anger, despair and hopelessness\nand that he should be continued to be monitored. Plaintiff's Exhibit 25. Cameron felt that he had been raped and\neven stated to Center staff that he now knew how his victims felt. Cameron is still subject to strip searches\nalthough it appears that the extraction team has not been used on him since the incident in 1986. Also, the policy\nunder which attorney visits must be followed by strip searches is no longer in effect.\nCameron presented evidence that the use of the extraction team was unnecessary and compromised Cameron's\ntreatment. Dr. Jurgela testified that in his professional judgment the appropriate way to proceed would have been\nto (1) wait for a bowel movement to see if Cameron was hiding anything or (2) call in a clinician to speak to\nCameron and try to reason with him before immediately proceeding with the extraction team. Consultation with\nprofessional staff before proceeding with such a serious invasion of an involuntarily committed patient's liberty is\na constitutional requirement. See Doe, 808 F.2d at 885 (noting that use of restraints on patients was\nconstitutionally permissible because they were only used after approval by a member of the professional staff).\nDefendants did not offer any evidence that proceeding with the extraction team without even consulting a\nclinician was a professionally acceptable decision. Although there was testimony as to the need in general to\nprevent patients from smuggling in contraband, there was no testimony that Cameron posed such a risk,\nespecially after visiting with his attorney. In addition, there was no testimony that defendants could not apply the\nprofessionally acceptable approach suggested by Dr. Jurgela. It does not follow, of course, that Cameron cannot\nbe strip searched. It does follow, however, that defendants failed to weigh its own security interests with\nCameron's liberty interests, and thus to reach a professional judgment. Rather defendants blindly enforced a\nCenter policy without any consideration, any judgment as to how it would affect Cameron, and whether\ndefendants' needs 00 if indeed there were any needs 00 outweighed the known harmful effect on Cameron. Such a\n97 97\nsevere violation of Cameron's liberty, a person committed to the Center for treatment, not punishment, cannot\npass constitutional muster.\nF. Oral Cavity Search\nDefendants often subject Cameron to oral cavity searches after he takes his prescribed medication. Defendants\npresented evidence that the reason for this policy is that some patients have been known to hoard medicine and\n1524 then trade it or sell it to other patients. There was also testimony, however, that subjecting Cameron *1524 to\nthese intrusions is unnecessary, and greatly upsets him and inhibits his ability to be treated. There was no\ntestimony that defendants took Cameron's mental health into consideration when subjecting him to these\nsearches. There was no testimony that a mental health professional is ever consulted before a search is\n\nconducted. Indeed there was no testimony that any weighing of defendants' need to conduct the search with its\neffect on Cameron's mental health occurred. These searches are another example of defendants' rigorously\napplying bright-line security policies to Cameron without any consideration of a policy's effect on Cameron's\nmental health. Such a failure to exercise professional judgment violates Cameron's constitutional rights.\nThis is not to say that oral cavity searches are forbidden. It is to say that a professional judgment must be made\nas to whether they should be instituted against Cameron. It is not enough for defendants to say that some\npatients hoard medicine and therefore all patients will be subjected to this search, even if it is harmful to a\npatient's mental health, and even if there is little or no cause to believe a particular patient will hoard medicine.\nBefore defendants may place this type of bodily restraint on Cameron, defendants must consult with the Center's\nmental health professionals to determine what is the professionally acceptable way to ensure defendants'\nlegitimate interests consistent with Cameron's interest in freedom from unnecessary and harmful restraint.\nG. The System of Discipline\nThe Center monitors disciplinary violations through \"Observation of Behavior Reports.\" These reports are written\nby members of the correctional staff when they observe an alleged disciplinary violation. After the report is filed,\nthe patient may contest the findings of the report at a hearing. If the patient is found to be guilty of the reported\naction, the patient may be punished. For example, at one time Cameron was put on 30 days probation for having\na metal filler in his pen when he was entering the visiting room. Plaintiff's Exhibit 22. In addition, if a patient has a\ngrievance regarding the Center's policies and regulations, the patient is directed to fill out a Department of\nCorrection grievance form. The mental health staff is not officially a part of the disciplinary system.\nFor most patients the Center's disciplinary system may indeed be reasonable and professionally acceptable.\nDefendants presented evidence that the system is needed to maintain safety, and that it provides patients with\nvaluable training in learning to abide by rules. However, I find that even if this system is professionally acceptable\nfor most patients, no professional judgment has been made as to whether it is acceptable for Cameron.\nCameron presented evidence that the confrontational and inflexible way in which alleged disciplinary violations\nare handled by the correctional personnel inhibits his ability to respond to treatment. Dr. Jurgela testified that\nwhen Cameron is confronted by the correctional officers his pathology causes him to become anxious and to\nwant to escape. If he cannot escape, he responds with verbal outbursts. Cameron is often disciplined for showing\ndisrespect to correctional personnel. Plaintiff's Exhibit 22. Michael Stevens testified that such discipline reflects a\nfundamental misunderstanding of Cameron's mental illness. He stated that punishing Cameron for his verbal\noutbursts is similar to punishing a person with Tourette's syndrome for swearing. In both cases the patient is\nbeing punished for the manifestation of psychological problems.\nDefendants did not offer any evidence that it is professionally acceptable to have the Department of Correction\nresponsible for the discipline and punishment of Cameron without any involvement of the Center's mental health\nstaff. Rather, the only defense defendants offered is the general need to maintain safety and security at the\nCenter. There is no doubt that defendants have a strong interest 00 indeed a constitutional duty 00 to maintain a\n97 97\nsafe and secure environment at the Center. However, defendants did not offer any evidence that they exercised\n1525 professional judgment in applying *1525 the disciplinary policy developed for the patient population as a whole to\nCameron.\nOf course, not every incident in which defendants treat Cameron in a way that is harmful to his treatment rises to\nthe level of a constitutional violation. \"The line of demarkation between acts which violate due process and those\nwhich do not is whether the action taken was `reasonable,' i.e., whether the decision was based upon the\nexercise of professional judgment.\" Doe by Roe, 617 F.Supp. at 1486. In this case defendants know that the strict\nenforcement of the Center's policies and regulations against Cameron by Department of Correction personnel is\ndetrimental to Cameron's treatment. Yet defendants continue to discipline Cameron through this system without\never consulting the Center's clinicians on whether it is professionally acceptable to do so. Such treatment is not\nbased on the exercise of professional judgment.\n\nH. Visiting with the Grandchildren\nCameron's attorney indicated at trial that defendants maintain a policy of refusing to allow the patients to visit with\nchildren in the Visiting Room. Thus, Cameron is not allowed to visit with his grandchildren. As defendants point\nout, because this information came from Cameron's attorney, and not from testimony or exhibits, it is not\nevidence, and I make no finding based upon it. I do observe, however, in the hope the observation may be useful\nguidance to the parties in the future, that if defendants do prohibit Cameron from visiting with his grandchildren at\nthe Center they are clearly restricting his liberty. He is at the Center for treatment, not punishment, and\ndefendants may not restrict Cameron's right to be a grandfather without a qualified professional deciding that it is\nprofessionally acceptable to do so. As I have already stated elsewhere in this Opinion, defendants may not justify\nsuch a restraint on the ground that some or even most of the patients are a risk to children. Rather, a qualified\nprofessional must make a determination as to Cameron's particular risk.\nI. The Center's Ability to Treat Cameron\nAt trial Cameron appeared to argue that the mere presence of the correctional staff at the Center hurt his ability\nto be treated. In addition, he presented evidence that the staff at the Center is in flux and that because he cannot\nbe guaranteed that his therapist Gloria Berman will remain on the staff, he is unable to completely open up to her\nas is needed for him to be adequately treated.\nI do not find that the mere presence of Department of Correction personnel prevents Cameron from receiving\nconstitutionally adequate treatment. As has been stated, it is the strict and inflexible application of security rules\nwithout any professional judgment as to their effect on Cameron's mental health that has inhibited his ability to\nreceive treatment. Nor do I find that the instability and general insufficiency of the staffing make it impossible for\ndefendants to provide Cameron with adequate treatment. As was made clear at trial, Cameron is making some\nprogress in his individual therapy with Ms. Berman, and individual therapy is the type of treatment that all\nprofessional opinions expressed at trial say is the most beneficial to Cameron.\nIt is true that the need for security measures at the Center makes it a less than ideal place for Cameron to\nreceive treatment. And it may also be true that Cameron might be treated more quickly and effectively if he were\nplaced in a mental health facility without the presence of Department of Correction personnel and with a more\nconstant staff. However, an involuntarily committed patient does not have a constitutional right to an ideal\nenvironment. Rather, the Constitution requires a state to provide a patient with an environment in which\nprofessional judgment may be exercised. See Doe, 808 F.2d at 886. Although Cameron has proved that\ndefendants have failed in many instances to exercise professional judgment, Cameron has not proved that the\nenvironment at the Center is such that professional judgment cannot be exercised.\n1526  V. Relief\n*1526\nHaving determined that defendants have violated, and in many instances, continue to violate Cameron's due\nprocess rights, I must determine what equitable relief is appropriate. As the Court made clear in Youngberg, it is\nnot appropriate for this court to determine what treatment Cameron should receive. Rather, it is this court's duty\nto ensure that, however defendants choose to treat Cameron, the choice is based on the exercise of professional\njudgment 00 weighing the defendants' interest to protect others and Cameron along with Cameron's interest in\n97\nminimally adequate treatment. In addition, however, when all the qualified professional opinion expressed to a\ncourt is that a patient should be treated in a certain manner, and defendants do not present a shred of evidence\nthat it is professionally acceptable to treat a patient in a different manner, it is appropriate for a court to order the\ndefendants to treat a patient in accordance with the professional judgment expressed at trial.\nBased on the considerations explained above, the findings and conclusions stated in this Opinion, and the parties\nsubmissions regarding the form of judgment, I order the following relief:\n\n1. The RIRB shall immediately review Cameron's commitment to the Center in order to determine the appropriate\ntreatment and conditions of confinement for Cameron, as well as an evaluation of his current sexual\ndangerousness. As part of this review Cameron's community access requests shall be reconsidered. All final\ndecisions on Cameron's long-term treatment, including his participation in the community access program, must\nbe made by a qualified professional, or with due respect and regard for the judgment of a qualified professional.\n2. Defendants shall allow Cameron to receive medical treatment from the Veterans Administration for the\nfollowing: (1) a new prosthesis, (2) his circulation problems, and (3) possible treatment for suspected cancer.\n3. Defendants shall refrain from transporting Cameron to and from his medical appointments by armed\ncorrectional officers and in shackles unless and until a qualified decisionmaker determines through the exercise\nof professional judgment that such restraints are professionally acceptable, based on a weighing of defendants'\nneeds along with Cameron's treatment needs. Unless and until that judgment is made, defendants shall transport\nCameron to his appointments without shackles and without an armed correctional officer.\n4. If and when Cameron, or any member of the Center's clinical staff on Cameron's behalf, applies for further\nmedical or psychological appointments outside of the Center, defendants must have a qualified decisionmaker\nconsider those requests based upon the exercise of professional judgment.\n5. Defendants are enjoined from enforcing the ten minute restriction in the Controlled Movement Policy against\nCameron. Instead, defendants are ordered to consult with Cameron's therapist, other mental health professionals\nat the Center familiar with Cameron's pathology and treatment needs, and Cameron, to make a professional\njudgment as to what time limitations, if any, are appropriate for a patient with Cameron's disability and diagnosis.\n6. Defendants are enjoined from using the \"Extraction Team\" against Cameron without first consulting with a\nCenter clinician as to the professionally acceptable way to handle the situation.\n7. Defendants are enjoined from enforcing the current disciplinary system, run by Department of Correction\npersonnel, against Cameron. Instead, defendants are ordered to consult and confer with Cameron's treating\nclinician and other mental health professionals at the Center familiar with Cameron's treatment needs and\ndiagnosis, to develop a system of discipline for Cameron that is based on a weighing of defendants' legitimate\nsecurity interests, along with Cameron's liberty interest in not being treated in a manner that is harmful to his\nability to respond to treatment.\n1527 8. Defendants are enjoined from conducting oral cavity searches on Cameron *1527 unless and until a qualified\ndecisionmaker determines, based upon the exercise of professional judgment, that such searches are necessary\nand acceptable for Cameron.\n9. Cameron shall not be required to consent to double bunking to be eligible to reside on the maximum privilege\nunit.\n10. A handicapped accessible room in a clinical housing unit at the Center shall immediately be modified to\nprovide reasonable space for Cameron to use his wheelchair and walker. In determining what modifications are\nnecessary, defendants, working with a Center clinician, shall obtain and consider Cameron's requests. In\naddition, defendants shall immediately consult with Cameron's treating physician at the Veterans Administration\nto determine whether Cameron needs a hospital bed. If a hospital bed is needed, defendants shall immediately\nmake arrangements to provide Cameron with a hospital bed in the modified handicapped accessible room. Once\nthe modifications are complete, the handicapped accessible room shall be made available to Cameron.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

CAMERON, Plaintiff, Appellee,\nv.\nHenry TOMES, et al., Defendants, Appellants.\nNo. 92-1343.\nUnited States Court of Appeals, First Circuit.\nHeard October 8, 1992.\nDecided March 31, 1993.\n15 *15 Elisabeth J. Medvedow, Asst. Atty. Gen., Com. of MA, with whom Scott Harshbarger, Atty. Gen., Com. of MA,\nwas on brief, for defendants, appellants.\nDavid M. Rocchio with whom Robert D. Keefe, Mark G. Matuschak, and Hale and Dorr were on brief, for plaintiff,\nappellee.\nBefore SELYA, Circuit Judge, COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge, and BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.\nBOUDIN, Circuit Judge.\nThis case was brought by Robert Cameron, who is currently detained in the Massachusetts Treatment Center for\nthe Sexually Dangerous (\"the Treatment Center\"). The defendants, whom we refer to as \"the state,\" are officials\nwho are responsible for the Treatment Center. In substance, Cameron complains that his conditions of\nconfinement violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and his asserted constitutional \"right\nto treatment.\"\nAfter a bench trial the district court granted injunctive relief and the state appealed. We modify the injunction in\naccordance with this opinion and, with certain clarifications, otherwise affirm most of the relief ordered by the\ndistrict court. Our decision is based upon the district court's findings but rests upon somewhat different legal\ngrounds.\nI. THE FACTS AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS\nOn December 13, 1978, Cameron was convicted in Vermont of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and\nsexual assault 00 apparently attempted rape 00 and sentenced to a term of six to twenty years. He was then\n97 97\nextradited to Massachusetts and convicted on September 12, 1979, for assault with intent to rape, kidnapping,\nand other crimes, and sentenced to a term of ten to twenty years, commencing after the Vermont sentence. On\n16 being paroled by Vermont on July 12, 1982, Cameron began serving his Massachusetts sentence, which *16 at\n[1]\nthe time of trial was set to expire in the year 2002.\nAfter serving several years in a Massachusetts prison, Cameron on November 14, 1985, was adjudged by the\nMassachusetts Superior Court to be a sexually dangerous person under M.G.L.A. c. 123A, and committed to the\nTreatment Center for a period of one day to life. The occasion for the commitment is not described. The\nTreatment Center, one of several facilities located at MCI Bridgewater, has a checkered history, much of it\nembroiled in litigation, e.g., Langton v. Johnston, 928 F.2d 1206 (1st Cir.1991), and M.G.L.A. c. 123A itself has an\n[2]\nuncertain future.  Most of the Treatment Center's inhabitants have underlying criminal convictions, and it is\nadministered jointly by the Departments of Mental Health and Corrections to address both the medical and\nsecurity aims of the Center. Cameron's stay at the Treatment Center appears to have been even more unhappy\nthan normal.\nAlthough the parties agree on little else, it appears that Cameron who is 50 years old and a Vietnam veteran\nsuffers from severe psychological disorders. In the words of the district court, \"Cameron suffers from a borderline\n\nor mixed personality disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. There is also no dispute that as a result ... he\nmay often act in a paranoid and confrontational manner.\" Cameron v. Tomes, 783 F.Supp. 1511, 1517\n(D.Mass.1992). Psychological treatment is available at the Treatment Center 00 indeed, its availability is provided\n97\n[3]\nfor under a consent judgment entered many years ago  00 but Cameron found what was offered unsuitable until\n97\n1989 when he established a working relationship with a therapist.\nIn the meantime, Cameron brought the present suit in 1986 challenging his conditions of confinement. Counsel\nwas assigned, his claims evolved, and in December 1991 and January 1992, the district court conducted a six-\nday bench trial in the case. In his opinion issued on February 14, 1992, the district judge declared that Cameron\nhad a \"constitutional right to minimally adequate treatment [for his mental disorders] based upon the exercise of\nprofessional judgment.\" 783 F.Supp. at 1516. The court rejected a motion to dismiss by the state, which had\nargued that no such constitutional right existed. Id. It also rejected the state's res judicata defense, id. at 1516-17,\nbased on the Langton case where a different district judge had found that the Treatment Center was in general\ncompliance with the consent decree. See Langton, 928 F.2d at 1208-16.\nThe district court then ruled that, on a number of issues, those in charge of the Treatment Center had made\njudgments about Cameron and enforced policies against him without, or contrary to, the advice of the medical\nprofessionals involved in his treatment. 783 F.Supp. at 1518-25. The district court made specific findings relating\nto Cameron's access to outside medical care, the use of shackles and an armed guard in transporting him, his\nhousing in the facility, physical searches of him, and similar matters. The court then granted injunctive relief on\nten different matters. Id. at 1526-27.\nFirst, and most broadly, the court ordered the pertinent administrative board within the Treatment Center to\nconduct an immediate review of his current sexual dangerousness, appropriate treatment and conditions, and his\n17 request to participate in *17 what is called the community access program. 783 F.Supp. at 1526. This injunctive\nprovision ended by stating: \"All final decisions on Cameron's long-term treatment, including his participation in the\ncommunity access program, must be made by a qualified professional, or with due respect and regard for the\njudgment of a qualified professional.\" Id.\nSeveral other decree provisions are similarly qualified. The court suspended the use of shackles and an armed\nguard in transporting Cameron for outside medical care unless and until \"a qualified decision maker determines\nthrough the exercise of professional judgment that such restraints are professionally acceptable, based on a\nweighing of [the state's] needs along with Cameron's treatment needs.\" 783 F.Supp. at 1526. Prohibited, under a\nsimilar condition, were subjecting Cameron to a restrictive internal movement policy, to an intrusive search\nprocedure previously used and so-called \"oral cavity searches,\" and to the \"current disciplinary system\" of the\nTreatment Center. Id. at 1526-27.\nFinally, without any qualification as to professional judgment, the court ordered that Cameron be allowed medical\ntreatment at Veterans Administration facilities for specific medical conditions, that he be allowed housing in the\nmaximum privilege unit of the Treatment Center without consenting to share a room, and that a handicapped\naccessible room be immediately made available to him. 783 F.Supp. at 1526. This last direction, as well as\nseveral of the others, was related to physical disabilities suffered by Cameron, including the amputation of a leg\ndue to infection while Cameron was in the care of the state.\nII. DISCUSSION\nRes Judicata. The state's threshold objection to the suit is that Cameron's claims are encompassed by prior\nlitigation and are therefore barred as res judicata. Emphasizing the \"claim preclusion\" branch of res judicata, the\nstate's brief says that one of the consolidated district court cases embraced by Langton00Bruder v. Johnston 00\n97 97\nwas a class action suit concerning the right to treatment for all persons confined at the Treatment Center as of\n1987. Cameron, says the state, was a member of the class and the state prevailed in that case on the ground\nthat treatment was adequately provided.\nWe agree with the district court that the state has made no showing that Cameron's claim is barred by res\njudicata. Cases on res judicata, ample in many areas, are fairly sparse where preclusion of distinctive individual\n\nclaims is urged based upon an earlier class action judgment. But in Cooper v. Federal Reserve Bank of\nRichmond, 467 U.S. 867, 880, 104 S.Ct. 2794, 2801-02, 81 L.Ed.2d 718 (1984), the Supreme Court confirmed\nwhat common sense would suggest: a class action judgment 00 there, in a discrimination case 00 binds the class\n97 97\nmembers as to matters actually litigated but does not resolve any claim based on individual circumstances that\nwas not addressed in the class action. Id. at 880-82, 104 S.Ct. at 2801-02.\nUnder Cooper, we think that res judicata plainly does not apply in this instance. The several law suits and years\nof proceedings embraced by Langton require pages to describe, but the suits were concerned with fairly general\nissues (e.g., physical plant, sequestration, equality of treatment) and with specific claims of individuals other than\n[4]\nCameron.  The closest that that litigation came to this case was (1) endorsement of a general requirement of\ntreatment set forth in state regulations, (2) rejection of a charge that the authorized absence program was\nunderutilized, and (3) rejection of a general attack on the \"double bunking\" requirement. These claims dealt with\nthe general condition of inhabitants of the Treatment Center. If Langton has anything else in common with this\ncase, the state has not mentioned it.\n18 *18 This case, by contrast, rests primarily on Cameron's claims that his unusual situation requires special\naccommodations: specifically, that his physical disability affects his need for outside medical visits, freer\nmovement within the Treatment Center, and separate bunking arrangements adapted to his handicap, and that\nhis mental condition (what lay people would probably call paranoia) makes ordinary physical searches,\ndisciplinary arrangements and other constraints unsuitable, indeed psychologically dangerous, for him. There is\nno suggestion by the state that these issues peculiar to Cameron were actually litigated in the Langton case.\nThus, the state's claim reduces itself to the argument that Cameron had to litigate those issues in the earlier\ncases or forever hold his peace. To describe this claim is to refute it: class action institutional litigation often\naddresses general circumstances, not the distinctive plight of someone claiming special needs or status. To the\nextent individual concerns were addressed in Langton, Cameron is not even mentioned in the district court\ndecision. Nor could earlier cases deal with later occurring events that are a part of Cameron's present case. In\ntheory, claim preclusion is possible where an earlier class action claim is essentially the same as a later action for\nindividual relief, and issue preclusion is possible where a fact resolved in the class action proves important in the\nlater action. See Cooper, 467 U.S. at 880-82, 104 S.Ct. at 2800-02. No such overlap has been shown here.\nThe Merits. The district court in this case premised its decision on what it deemed to be two established\nconstitutional rights possessed by those at the Treatment Center: \"a constitutional right to minimally adequate\ntreatment [for mental disorders] based upon the exercise of professional judgment,\" 783 F.Supp. at 1516, and a\nright to be free from \"[b]odily restraints\" except \"when and to the extent professional judgment deems this\nnecessary....\" Id. at 1520. It is not entirely clear whose professional judgment 00 medical or administrative 00 the\n97 97\ndistrict court had in mind; but the implication of its discussion is that the administrators of the facility are bound to\nlisten to the judgment of the medical professionals and to heed it unless they offer good reason for refusing to do\nso. Id. at 1519-20.\nBoth sides on this appeal seek a decision on the constitutional \"right to treatment,\" the state urging that none\nexists and Cameron supporting the district court. In our view, a decision on the abstract issue of \"a right to\ntreatment\" is not necessary for a disposition of this case; and the concept has only a remote connection to the\nactual relief sought. We address this point briefly, against the background of prior \"right to treatment\" law, before\nconsidering Cameron's own situation and the proper touchstone for appraising his claims.\nIt is settled that those who are confined by the state, for whatever reason, are entitled under the Constitution to\nfood, clothing, medical care, and reasonable efforts to secure physical safety. Beyond such obvious essentials,\nhowever, guidance from the Supreme Court is largely confined to one cautiously phrased decision. In Youngberg\nv. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982), a mother, unable to care for her retarded child,\nplaced him in a state institution. Then, discovering that he was sometimes physically restrained by \"soft\" shackles\nand taught little in \"basic self-care skills,\" she sued. The Supreme Court held that under those circumstances the\nchild was constitutionally entitled to be free from any but necessary restraints and had a right to basic self-care\ntraining to secure safety and mobility. As for deciding when and how much, the Court said that judges should not\n\ndictate the choice among acceptable alternatives and that a \"presumption\" of correctness must be attached to\n\"professional judgment.\" Id. at 321-23, 102 S.Ct. at 2461-62.\nYoungberg left in limbo a prior line of lower court cases and academic literature that had sought to shape a broad\n19 constitutional \"right to treatment,\" including treatment of the psychological ills of confined *19 persons.[5] Since \n[6]\nYoungberg, a few circuits have ventured into this constitutional territory, returning with different answers.  We\nourselves may have seemed to send mixed signals. In Doe v. Gaughan, 808 F.2d 871 (1st Cir.1986), this court,\nunder the caption \"constitutional right to treatment,\" agreed that Youngberg extended beyond the retarded to\nprotect similar interests of those mentally ill persons civilly committed to a different Bridgewater facility. Id. at 884.\nIn Langton, four years later, this court explicitly refused to decide whether there was a \"constitutional right to\ntreatment\" at the Treatment Center, remarking that \"the trial judge's skirting of the constitutional thicket was\nappropriate\" as such issues should be decided only when necessary. 928 F.2d at 1217. One reason why it was\nunnecessary in Langton was that the consent decree \"set a higher standard than the Constitution\" in affording\n[7]\ntreatment for those in the Treatment Center. Id.\nAlthough the parties seek to litigate the abstract issue of a right to treatment, we prefer to plow a furrow no wider\nthan the case demands. Cameron's claims for the most part are not really \"right to treatment\" claims at all: he is\nreceiving substantial psychological treatment for his condition, and most of the arguments he is making concern\nhousing, mobility, transportation, and security. Further, under existing state law, there is already a regulation-\nbased right to treatment at the Treatment Center that equals or exceeds anything that the Supreme Court would\nlikely impose under the Due Process Clause. See Langton, 928 F.2d at 1217. It is also unclear whether, if the\nSupreme Court did provide a general \"right to treatment\" for civilly committed persons, it would apply that right to\n[8]\nthose held as well under criminal sentence. Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 321-22, 102 S.Ct. at 2461.  At the very\nleast, the Court's approach in Youngberg suggests hewing to the case-by-case approach.\nTaking that approach here, we think the touchstone for Cameron's claims is the Due Process Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment, requiring conditions that do not fall below the minimum standards of civilized decency. \nSee generally Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 72 S.Ct. 205, 96 L.Ed. 183 (1952). Under this rubric, context\nworks in Cameron's favor. While his prison sentence will expire in 2002 or even earlier, his confinement in the\nTreatment Center is from one day to life and will never end unless his condition improves and he is found to be\nno longer sexually dangerous. Thus, Cameron's best argument is that the state's ordinary procedures and\nconstraints are affirmatively and needlessly worsening his mental condition, so that he may well be confined long\n20 after his sentence has expired. This is a claim with some bite, no matter how much latitude *20 states ordinarily\nhave to run their institutions.\nFurther, the findings of the district court, which control unless clearly erroneous, Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a); Doe v.\nGaughan, 808 F.2d at 877, lend support to Cameron's argument. The findings amount to a determination by the\ndistrict court that procedures that might ordinarily be applied 00 such as certain of the searches and the internal\n97\nmovement controls 00 worsen Cameron's condition and may well be unnecessary in this case. See783 F.Supp. at\n97\n[9]\n1523-25.  On both points, effect and necessity, the district court says that this is the judgment of the medical\nprofessionals and that no adequate response has been obtained from the administrators. Id.\nThe state broadly disputes this version of events, pointing to other evidence showing how much it has helped\nCameron and tried to accommodate his special needs. It does not, however, make much effort in its brief to rebut\nspecific findings as to specific episodes. We think there is some conflict in the evidence but also that the district\njudge's findings are not clearly erroneous. It is true that these findings were made in the framework of a legal\nanalysis that we do not adopt, but the findings fit well enough into a due process framework and this court may\naffirm on any grounds supported by evidence. See Doe v. Anrig, 728 F.2d 30, 32 (1st Cir.1984).\nRelief Ordered by the District Court. The immediate relief ordered by the district court is, with one or two\nexceptions, fairly modest, primarily requiring further consideration of Cameron's case and some interim\nmeasures. Importantly, the court has ordered a general reappraisal of Cameron's treatment and conditions, with\ndecisions to be made by the administrators \"with due respect and regard for the judgment of a qualified\n\nprofessional.\" 783 F.Supp. at 1526. But given the district court's use in several contexts of the \"professional\njudgment\" standard, a word is in order for the guidance of the parties and for any future litigation that may ensue.\nIn an institution like the Treatment Center, as in an ordinary prison, security and administrative concerns may\nclash with the welfare and comfort of individuals, as the district court recognized. This was so in the facility at\nissue in Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 320, 102 S.Ct. at 2460, and it is surely so in the Treatment Center where most if\nnot all those detained have been convicted of crimes and many may be dangerous. Any professional judgment\nthat decides an issue involving conditions of confinement must embrace security and administration, and not\nmerely medical judgments.\nThus when it comes to appraising the judgments of the administrators, it does not follow that they are bound to\ndo what the doctors say is best for Cameron even if the doctors are unanimous. The administrators are\nresponsible to the state and to the public for making professional judgments of their own, encompassing\ninstitutional concerns as well as individual welfare. Nothing in the Constitution mechanically gives controlling\nweight to one set of professional judgments. Indeed, when it comes to constitutional rights, none of the\nprofessionals has the last word. Professional judgment, as the Supreme Court has explained, creates only a\n\"presumption\" of correctness; welcome or not, the final responsibility belongs to the courts. See Youngberg, 457\nU.S. at 323, 102 S.Ct. at 2462.\nWith this clarification as to the role of \"professional judgment,\" we sustain the first injunctive relief provision\n21 ordered by the district court directing the general reappraisal *21 of Cameron's personal dangerousness and of\nhis general conditions of confinement. Para. 1 (783 F.Supp. at 1526). The findings noted above and the evidence\nportrayed in the district court's decision support this fairly modest directive. In framing equitable relief, a district\ncourt has substantial latitude, and we think its \"remand\" to the Treatment Center administration is well within its\nauthority.\nWe also conclude that, on the same basis and with the same clarification as to the role of professional judgment,\nthe district court's findings, see783 F.Supp. at 1522-24, support several other conditioned decree provisions: that\nadministrators consider requests by Cameron for treatment outside the Treatment Center, para. 4 (id. at 1526);\nthat the ten-minute movement restriction and oral-cavity searches be suspended as to Cameron unless and until\na qualified decision-maker concludes that they are appropriate for Cameron; and that the \"Extraction Team\"\nsearches of Cameron be barred unless there is prior consultation with a Treatment Center clinician. Paras. 5, 6\nand 8 (id. at 1526).\nOn two other decree provisions, we believe modifications are required. First, the district court ordered that an\narmed guard and shackles no longer be used when transporting Cameron outside the facility unless and until a\nqualified decision-maker determines this to be necessary. Para. 3 (783 F.Supp. at 1526). In matters of security,\nas opposed to administrative convenience, the administrators' discretion is at its zenith and Cameron is still under\n[10]\ncriminal sentence.  An armed guard and shackles may seem needless precautions for an amputee, but we\nthink that the Treatment Center should not be obliged to suspend its specific security measures for outside visits\nwhile Cameron's case is being reexamined. If the district court wishes to require this armed-guard-and-shackles\nrequirement to be re-examined on an expedited basis, that is within its province.\nSecond, we similarly modify the district court's general injunction preventing the Treatment Center \"from\nenforcing the current disciplinary system, run by Department of Correction personnel, against Cameron\" until a\nnew system suitable to his needs is constructed. Para. 7 (783 F.Supp. at 1526). We have no problem with the\ndecree's requirements that the administrators consider whether changes are warranted in the current system as\napplied to Cameron and that medical judgments be weighed in this process. But we think that a generally\nphrased suspension of \"the current disciplinary system\" in the meantime cuts too broadly and may raise security\nissues as well.\nFinally, we sustain three unqualified decree provisions made by the district court: that Cameron be allowed to\ncontinue, as apparently he is at present, visits to Veterans Administration facilities related to his amputation,\ncirculatory problems, and possible cancer; that the \"consent\" to double bunking be waived as to Cameron, the\n\"consent\" being largely symbolic; and that a handicapped accessible room, including a hospital bed if necessary,\n\nbe made available to him. Paras. 2, 9, 10 (783 F.Supp. at 1526-27). These specifics of relief lie largely within the\njudgment of the district court, and the state's brief makes no targeted showing that these provisions are improper.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nNo one who reviews this record can dispute that Cameron has done harm in the past, nor doubt that he has been\nafflicted with serious mental illness. The findings of the district court suggest that, without special attention to his\npeculiar circumstances, further damage will be done to his mental condition. We conclude that the state does\n22 have a Due Process Clause obligation, to be balanced by it with competing *22 demands and interests, to seek\nto limit the extent to which it worsens Cameron's condition and thereby extends his detention indefinitely.\nNeedless to say, there can be no precision in such a Due Process Clause \"standard\" nor any way to avoid further\ndispute about its application, if the parties are bent on dispute.\nThe district judge, we think, had the right idea in directing the Treatment Center to undertake a good faith\nreappraisal of its policies as applied to Cameron. The more swiftly the matter is returned to that forum, with that\nperspective, the better off Cameron will be. As for the state, it may regard the district judge's strictures on its\nattitude as unfair and heedless of its past efforts for Cameron. But the injunction, at least as we have adjusted it\nand delimited its future effect, is not unduly burdensome. Like Cameron, the state has an evident interest in a\nresolution that avoids further litigation.\nThe district court's injunction is modified as set forth above and is otherwise affirmed, with the clarifications and\nupon the grounds stated in this opinion. No costs or attorneys' fees shall be awarded in connection with this\nappeal.\nIt is so ordered.\n[1] The district court opinion recites that the Massachusetts sentence ended in February 1992; but the parties\nadvise us that Cameron's release date at the time of trial was 2002. Cameron's brief says that this period may be\nshortened by good time credits and possible parole.\n[2] The statute is one of the so-called sexual psychopath laws enacted in the 1940s in a number of states. See C.\nTenney, Sex, Sanity and Stupidity in Massachusetts, 42 B.U.L.Rev. 1 (1962). In 1990, the Massachusetts\nlegislature curtailed new admissions into the Treatment Center. See Langton, 928 F.2d at 1209.\n[3] Regulations adopted pursuant to the decree provide that \"[e]very patient shall be offered treatment to effect\nhis early return to public society. Such treatment shall consist of medical, psychiatric [and other services] ... Such\ntreatment shall be administered ... in the least restrictive conditions which are consistent with [the patient's]\nsecurity needs.\" Langton, 928 F.2d at 1211.\n[4] A detailed history of the litigation and the issues decided is contained in the thorough, 171-page, unpublished\ndecision of Judge Mazzone, which this court in Langton affirmed on all issues apart from attorney's fees.\n[5]See Stefan, Leaving Civil Rights to the \"Experts\": From Deference to Abdication Under the Professional\nJudgment Standard, 102 Yale L.J. 639, 686-90 (1992). Treatment, in any curative sense, was not even an issue\nin Youngberg since the retardation was not curable. The Court expressly declined to devise any general rights to\nameliorative programs beyond basic self-help training to assure safety and mobility, saying \"we need go no\nfurther in this case.\" 457 U.S. at 319, 102 S.Ct. at 2460.\n[6]Compare, e.g., Ohlinger v. Watson, 652 F.2d 775 (1980),with Bailey v. Gardebring, 940 F.2d 1150 (8th\nCir.1991),cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 112 S.Ct. 1516, 117 L.Ed.2d 652 (1992). See generally, Woe v. Cuomo,\n729 F.2d 96, 105 (2d Cir.1984) (\"The Supreme Court has not directly addressed the question whether a\nconstitutional right to treatment exists....\").\n[7] In Cortes-Quinones v. Jimenez-Nettleship, 842 F.2d 556 (1st Cir.),cert. denied,488 U.S. 823, 109 S.Ct. 68,\n102 L.Ed.2d 45 (1988), and Torraco v. Maloney, 923 F.2d 231 (1st Cir.1991), this court addressed claims that\nauthorities had not taken the precaution against suicide of individual prisoners. While both decisions spoke of the\n\nstate's obligation to provide for medical needs, the context was very far removed from any generalized right to\ntreatment for psychological conditions.\n[8] Whatever other significance it may have, we think that Cameron's criminal sentence does refute any claim\nthat he is entitled under the Constitution to minimum physical restraint based on the judgment of his doctors.\nQuite unlike the child in Youngberg, Cameron is under criminal sentence of imprisonment for serious and violent\ncrimes. To that extent, he lacks the same \"liberty\" interest as the child in Youngberg.\n[9] For example, the court invoked the testimony of Cameron's therapist that the shackling was \"harmful to\nCameron's mental health\" and the court found it unnecessary based on \"uncontroverted evidence.\" 783 F.Supp.\nat 1520. The court determined that the Treatment Center's internal movement policy, allowing free movement for\nonly 10 minutes each hour, was unworkable for Cameron as an amputee, creating \"undue pressure [that] ...\ncompromises his treatment.\" Id. at 1522. A forcible search of Cameron while handcuffed, which the court found\nmay well have been unnecessary, drove Cameron into moods of \"helplessness, anger, despair and\nhopelessness....\" Id. at 1523.\n[10] M.G.L.A. c. 123A, § 6A, provides that, subject to exceptions entrusted to an administrative board, \"any\nperson committed as a sexually dangerous person ... shall be held in secure custody.\" Discharge from the\nTreatment Center does not \"terminate ... any ... unexpired sentence.\" Id. § 9.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
