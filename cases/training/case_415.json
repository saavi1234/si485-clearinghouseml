    "summary": "<p>On February 15, 1972, Harold Williams and other residents at the Treatment Center for Sexually Dangerous Persons in Bridgewater, Massachusetts filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the center alleging that the conditions of confinement and inadequacy of treatment programs violated their rights under the Fifth, Eight, and Fourteenth Amendments. Conditions included cells which lacked sinks or toilets, inadequate medical care, and a lack of any activities or work release programs. Plaintiffs were represented by private attorneys.</p>\r\n<p>This case was litigated with <a href=\"../../../../case/5470/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">King v. Greenblatt</a>. In 1974, the district court (Judge Charles Edward Wyzanski, Jr.) entered two consent decrees in King and one in this case. The decrees placed the facility under the authority of the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health, prohibited defendants from using solitary confinement for purposes of punishment or discipline, and provided other constitutional guidelines. At the time of the consent decrees, conditions in the facility were very poor as a result of overcrowding, unsafe drinking water, lack of toilet facilities, obsolete heating and ventilation, inadequate staffing, and lack of recreational opportunities and facilities. Inmates brought many cases to enforce these decrees and conditions at the facility gradually improved.</p>\r\n<p>There were tensions over the shared control of the facility by the Department of Corrections and the Department of Mental Health. After the state legislature recommended that control of the facility be with the Department of Corrections solely, the district court (Judge John J. McNaught) appointed a Special Master to consider the viability of the consent decrees. Later, legislation was passed granting control to the Department of Corrections. Judge McNaught officially consolidated the Williams and King cases in 1994 and appointed counsel for a class of 48 inmates who alleged constitutional violations in the facility.</p>\r\n<p>The Department of Corrections presented the court with a proposed plan for administering the facility and in 1995, Judge McNaught directed the parties to reach a consensus on the rules and regulations that would govern the facility. That did not occur.</p>\r\n<p>On October 31, 1996, Judge A. David Mazzone granted Massachusetts's motion to modify the decrees but denied a motion to vacate the previous decrees. On June 21, 1999, Judge Mazzone granted the motion to vacate the consent decrees, holding that that the conditions at the center that had been the basis of the decrees had been remediated. King v. Greenblatt, 53 F. Supp. 2d 117 (D. Mass. 1999). The court also found that the Department of Corrections had demonstrated the intent and ability to operate the facility in a manner consistent with the rights of plaintiff patients and the goals of treatment. Judge Mazzone ordered the case closed on that date.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Gray, Jr., Sp. Asst. Atty. Gen., with whom James M. Shannon, Atty. Gen., Boston, Mass., was\non brief, for defendants, appellants.\nDavid P. Novello with whom Victor Bass, Steven L. Schreckinger and Palmer & Dodge, Boston, Mass., were on\nbrief, for plaintiffs, appellees.\nBefore BOWNES, BREYER and TORRUELLA, Circuit Judges.\nBOWNES, Circuit Judge.\nThis action is the latest stage in a fifteen-year old lawsuit concerned with the remedying of conditions at\nMassachusetts' Treatment Center for Sexually Dangerous Persons. Defendants-appellants are the\nMassachusetts Commissioner of Correction, the Superintendent of the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at\nBridgewater, the Assistant Deputy Superintendent, the Senior Correctional Officer and the Massachusetts\nCommissioner of Mental Health. Plaintiffs-appellees are residents at the Center. Defendants brought this action\nas a Rule 60(b) motion for relief from a January, 1978, order of the district court. The order required defendants\nto administer an Authorized Absence Program (AAP) at the Center in accordance with a set of regulations known\nas Part 408. Defendants now seek to administer the AAP in accordance with a recently adopted Massachusetts\nstatute, Mass.Gen.L. ch. 123A, § 8 (1986). We remand to the district court because the record provides an\ninsufficient basis for us to decide whether the district court's denial of the Rule 60(b) motion was proper.\nI.\nThe Amended Complaint in this case was filed in November, 1972. It alleged, inter alia, that \"work, job training\nprograms and educational facilities (both inside and outside the institution) are almost non-existent for `patients'\nat the Treatment Center.... The programs at the Treatment Center are substantially inferior to those existing at\ncorrectional institutions of the Commonwealth.\" The complaint claimed that these conditions violated the fifth,\neighth and fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution.\nConsent decrees were entered in the district court in 1974 and 1975. The first decree, entered in June, 1974,\nprovided, in general outline, for the division of responsibilities between the Departments of Correction and Mental\nHealth, for the implementation of vocational and other programs, and for the drafting of rules and regulations to\napply to patients at the Center. The second consent decree, entered in January, 1975, ordered the submission of\na plan including\na detailed description of the therapeutic, educational, vocational, and avocational programs to be\nprovided by the Department of Mental Health to patients of the Treatment Center and a provision\nfor the day or other short-term release programs outside the Treatment Center where such\nrelease is deemed appropriate by the Department of Mental Health.\n1225 *1225 In March, 1976, the district court ordered the implementation of regulations that had been drafted pursuant\nto this provision of the 1975 decree:\n\n[D]efendant Commissioner of Mental Health ... [shall] make effective immediately Part 408, the\nprovisions for authorized visits and absences, contained in the proposed regulations for the\nTreatment Center as filed in this action pursuant to the requirement of paragraph 2 of the partial\nconsent decree dated January 2, 1975.\nSeveral court hearings followed this order. The hearings resulted in various changes to Part 408, some stipulated\nby the parties, others ordered by the court. In January, 1978, the district court entered a \"Memorandum and\nOrder Establishing Regulations for Authorized Absences,\" in which the court stated that it finds that the draft of\nOctober 11, 1977, accurately sets forth the parties' stipulations and orders of the court and complies with the\nprovision of the [1975] partial consent decree ... and ORDERS that its provisions be implemented forthwith by the\nseveral parties defendant, their agents and employees.\nThe AAP is governed to this day by this 1978 court order that required the implementation of Part 408.\nIn May, 1980, defendants filed a Rule 60(b) motion for relief from the 1978 order. Defendants sought to\nadminister the AAP under new regulations drafted by the Department of Mental Health. They moved that the\ncourt permit the filing of the proposed regulations with the Secretary of the Commonwealth so that they could\neventually be enacted in accordance with the state Administrative Procedure Act, Mass.Gen.L. ch. 30A (1978). In\nshort, defendants requested \"to be relieved from the [1978] Court Order ... and allowed to promulgate regulations\naccording to the terms and provisions of state law.\"\nThe district court rejected the motion. Rather than discussing the more general request to replace the federal\ncourt order with state-promulgated regulations, the court based its ruling on an analysis of the four specific ways\nin which the draft regulations departed from Part 408. It rejected two of the proposed changes unconditionally. It\ndenied the other two proposed changes on the grounds that defendants had failed to show that circumstances\nhad changed sufficiently to warrant relief under Rule 60(b):\nWe had protracted hearings [prior to the issuance of the 1978 order], and we certainly cannot\nmake changes in the substantive rights that were granted these petitioners after such an\ninvestigation of the facts and the needs and the law without a far greater showing than what has\nbeen made by the defendants here in connection with their motion filed May 5, 1980.\nOn August 8, 1986, the district court denied a motion by plaintiffs for an order again requiring defendants to\noperate the program in accordance with Part 408. The court found that various violations of the regulations had\noccurred in the past, including unwarranted delays in processing applications for participation in the AAP. The\ncourt found, however, that the situation had begun to improve with the appointment of Ian Tink as acting\nadministrator of the Center in March, 1986. The court stated that \"[o]ne may hope with reason that progress will\ncontinue.\" The court also found that control of the Treatment Center had not been transferred to the Department\nof Correction. The court concluded that no additional order was necessary due to Tink's efforts to improve\nconditions.\nOn August 14, 1986, defendants filed another Rule 60(b) motion, the denial of which forms the subject of the\npresent appeal. Defendants sought relief from the 1978 court order to allow them to administer the AAP in\nconformity with a recently enacted Massachusetts statute, St.1985, c. 752, § 1, subsec. 8, codified at\nMass.Gen.L. ch. 123A, § 8 (1986). The statute was approved on January 6, 1986, and went into effect ninety\ndays later.\nFor the first time as a matter of state law, the new statute mandates a program for the \"restrictive integration of\n1226 the patient into a non-custodial environment.\" It thus overlaps with some of the provisions *1226 of Part 408.\nUnlike Part 408, though, the statute, with a few exceptions, does not itself contain detailed regulations for the\nprogram. Rather, the statute describes the program in general terms and states that \"said program shall be\nadministered pursuant to the rules and regulations promulgated by the department of mental health.\"\nIn their Rule 60(b) motion, defendants noted three ways in which the statute conflicts with the 1978 court order.\nFirst, the statute and Part 408 conflict with regard to the status of one member of a board that, according to both,\nis to be involved in the determination of eligibility for the program. Part 408 calls this board the \"Pre-Release\n\nReview Board\"; the statute calls it the \"restrictive integration review board.\" The statute and Part 408 have\nidentical provisions regarding five of the six members of the board. These five members, all with voting status,\ninclude two members of the Center's clinical staff and three other individuals, not employees of the Center, of\nwhom one must be a psychologist, the second a psychiatrist, and the third either a psychologist or a psychiatrist.\nThe sixth member of the board, under both the statute and Part 408, is the head of the Treatment Center\nCustodial Staff, an office affiliated with the Department of Correction. Under Part 408 this individual is a nonvoting\nmember of the board; the statute, however, grants him voting rights.\nThe second conflict concerns the length of time a patient must reside at the Center before he may become\neligible for the training program outside the institution. The statute provides that patients at the Center shall be\neligible for the program of \"restrictive integration into a non-custodial environment\" after at least two years of\ncustody; Part 408 allows participation in the AAP after only one year.\nFinally, defendants claim that the general provision in the statute that rules are to be promulgated by the\nDepartment of Mental Health conflicts with the court order as a whole because the order requires that the\nprogram be run according to the regulations contained in Part 408. This last \"conflict\" between the statute and\nPart 408 is of a more far-reaching nature than the first two differences; it calls into question Part 408 as a whole\nrather than the detail of its provisions.\nDefendants sought two forms of relief from the district court. First, they sought to have the 1978 court order\nmandating the implementation of Part 408 vacated in order to enable the program to be administered wholly\nunder the state statute and the regulations to be promulgated pursuant to the statute. In the alternative, they\nsought to have Part 408 modified with regard to the two specific conflicts with the statute: the two-year eligibility\nrequirement and the voting status for the custodial member of the board. Defendants did not ask, in either\nrequest for relief, that the underlying consent decrees be vacated.\nAt oral argument before us, defendants' counsel stated that he would accept a third, hybrid solution. Under this\nproposal, Part 408 would remain in effect while the Department of Mental Health promulgated regulations under\nstate law. Part 408 would be replaced by the new regulations only after the district court reviewed them to ensure\nthat they were consistent with the consent decrees and constitutional principles.\nII.\nThe parties have vigorously contested the legal standards governing this case. Their disagreement concerns the\nstandard the district court should have applied in considering the Rule 60(b) motion, as well as the standard of\nreview we should apply in examining the district court's decision. In the context of this case, the disputes about\nthe two standards are intertwined. We are required to make a rather extensive analysis because the variety of the\ncontexts in which requests for modification of court orders arise appears to have caused some confusion about\nthe appropriate standards to be applied both in the district court and on review.\nA district court must be accorded wide discretion when it considers a motion to modify or vacate a prior order in a\n1227 complex case. System Federation v. Wright, 364 *1227 U.S. 642, 648, 81 S.Ct. 368, 371, 5 L.Ed.2d 349 (1961); \nFortin v. Commissioner of Massachusetts Department of Public Welfare, 692 F.2d 790, 798-99 (1st Cir.1982). We\nhave recognized that, in cases involving \"public law\" issues of institutional reform, \"`broad judicial discretion may\nwell be crucial' for the district judge to secure `complex legal goals.'\" Massachusetts Ass'n of Older Americans v.\nCommissioner of Public Welfare, 803 F.2d 35, 38 (1st Cir.1986) (quoting AMF, Inc. v. Jewett, 711 F.2d 1096, 1101\n(1st Cir.1983)). The district court's ongoing involvement in such cases requires that it be granted considerable\nlatitude in determining the appropriate response to requests for modification or enforcement of the original order. \nMassachusetts Ass'n of Older Americans, 803 F.2d at 38 (citing Chayes, The Role of the Judge in Public Law\nLitigation, 89 Harv.L.Rev. 1281, 1292-98 (1976)).\nDiscretion, however, has its limits and these limits vary depending on the reasons advanced to justify a request\nfor modification. Thus, courts clearly have the ability to modify their orders due to a change in factual\ncircumstances: \"A continuing decree of injunction directed to events to come is subject always to adaptation as\nevents may shape the need.\" United States v. Swift & Co., 286 U.S. 106, 114, 52 S.Ct. 460, 462, 76 L.Ed. 999\n\n(1932). Where, however, the danger that motivated the provisions of the order is still present, a request for\nmodification or vacation faces a heavy burden:\n\"The inquiry for us is whether the changes are so important that dangers, once substantial, have\nbecome attenuated to a shadow.... Nothing less than a clear showing of grievous wrong evoked\nby new and unforeseen conditions should lead us to change what was decreed after years of\nlitigation with the consent of all concerned.\"\nFortin, 692 F.2d at 799 (quoting United States v. Swift & Co., 286 U.S. at 119, 52 S.Ct. at 464). Of course, where\nthe order has proved to be a faulty method for accomplishing the goal for which it was designed, it would be error\nfor a district court to refuse to grant a modification. See United States v. United Shoe Corp., 391 U.S. 244, 249,\n88 S.Ct. 1496, 1499, 20 L.Ed.2d 562 (1968).\nIn cases involving a change in the statute which the court order was meant to enforce, the order must be\nmodified when a failure to do so would enforce \"rights the statute no longer gives.\" System Federation, 364 U.S.\nat 652, 81 S.Ct. at 373. The limits to a district court's discretion in such cases \"are often far clearer to the\nreviewing court\" than in the context of a change in facts. Id. at 648, 81 S.Ct. at 371. A court would abuse its\ndiscretion if it continued to enforce statutory provisions that have been repealed by the legislature.\nWhile the foregoing principles may be clearly stated, they do not directly govern the present case. Defendants\nhave strenuously argued that this case presents a change in law warranting a modification or vacation of the\norder under System Federation, 364 U.S. 642, 81 S.Ct. 368, 5 L.Ed.2d 349. System Federation and the cases\nrelying on its holding, however, all involved changes in the statutes the court orders were meant to enforce. See,\ne.g., Williams v. Atkins, 786 F.2d 457 (1st Cir.1986). The court order in the present case, by contrast, was based\non rights guaranteed by the fifth, eighth and fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution. The\n\"change in law\" here is a state statute adopted long after the court order, though overlapping it in subject matter.\nTherefore, because of the context of this case, the principles outlined above must be supplemented by other\nconsiderations. We note, first, that a state statute that has the effect of thwarting a federal court order enforcing\nfederal rights \"cannot survive the command of the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.\" \nWashington v. Fishing Vessel Ass'n., 443 U.S. 658, 695, 99 S.Ct. 3055, 3079, 61 L.Ed.2d 823 (1979) (citations\n1228 omitted).[1] Where, however, *1228 the conflict between the goals and provisions of the state statute and the\nfederal court order is less than clear, delicate questions of federalism must enter into our inquiry. Cf. Rizzo v.\nGoode, 423 U.S. 362, 379, 96 S.Ct. 598, 608, 46 L.Ed.2d 561 (1976) (federalism must be considered in\ndetermining the scope of equitable relief). A hybrid inquiry, involving close attention to both factual and legal\ndetail, is required.\nWe have had occasion to conduct such inquiries in Coalition of Black Leadership v. Cianci, 570 F.2d 12 (1st\nCir.1978), and Massachusetts Ass'n for Retarded Citizens v. King, 668 F.2d 602 (1st Cir.1981). Cianci involved a\nconsent decree providing for procedures governing civilians' complaints against police officers. A state statute\nwas subsequently passed covering the same subject and partially conflicting with the consent decree. We\nrefused to vacate the decree. We found that, whereas the decree was intended primarily for the benefit of civilian\ncomplainants, the statute was meant to safeguard the rights of accused police officers. Cianci, 570 F.2d at 14.\nWe noted that there had been no showing that\nthe additional incremental requirements imposed by the consent decree but not mandated by the\nnew state legislation are so onerous that they amount to unfair hardships inflicted on police\nofficers and yet are so marginal that they provide no additional protection to civilian complainants.\nId. We held that the mere \"fact that the new legislation might accomplish much of what a consent decree was\ndesigned to achieve cannot be viewed as justification for vacating the decree.\" Id. Finally, we took note of the\ndistrict court's willingness to safeguard the rights of police officers in its enforcement of the decree; we found\nsignificant the court's \"flexibility\" on this point. Id.\nIn King, on the other hand, we found that a consent decree, when interpreted flexibly, did not conflict with an\noverlapping statute. We, therefore, overturned a preliminary injunction because we found it unlikely that the\n\nstatute would be found unlawful due to the supremacy of the federal court order. We summarized our manner of\ntreating the consent decree by stating that King was a case\nwhere the language of the decree does not conflict with the statute at issue, where the statute\ndoes not appear directly to impede the basic objective of the decree and where a contrary\ninterpretation was likely to provoke a direct confrontation between a federal court and a state\nlegislature exercising its fiscal power....\nKing, 668 F.2d at 610.\nThus, in Cianci and King we outlined a set of considerations for handling overlapping court orders and\nsubsequent state statutes. These considerations all focus on a careful reading of both the order and the statute to\ndiscover whether their objectives and provisions necessarily conflict and to consider the importance of the areas\nof conflict to the overall goals of the litigation. Rather than draw a bright-line rule, we have outlined a careful\ncase-specific inquiry that must be sensitive to the goals of the decree and the legislation, as well as to the values\nof federalism.\nIII.\nDue to the foregoing considerations, we would have to rely heavily on the district court's views on the ways in\nwhich the rather abstract legal issues argued before us relate to the actual administration and goals of the AAP\nas seen against the background of the years of litigation and the various orders and decrees entered in this case.\nThe Massachusetts district court has been handling this case for fifteen years; Judge McNaught, who wrote the\nopinion now on appeal, has been involved in various aspects of the case since 1979. It would be incongruous for\nus to upset the delicate balances struck by the court and the parties during years of litigation without a full\nunderstanding of the stakes underlying the various issues implicated in this appeal. Unfortunately, however, the\n1229 district court's *1229 opinion was exceedingly brief and even, in part, enigmatic.\nThe court rejected defendants' general contention that the objectives of the underlying consent decree would not\nbe frustrated by the modification of the order. The court did not specify, however, the ways in which these\nobjectives would be thwarted by modifying the order to conform with the statute. The court further ruled that this\ncase was governed by our decision in Cianci, 570 F.2d 12. We understand this citation of Cianci to refer, in the\nfirst instance, to the general proposition that the subsequent adoption of an overlapping state statute does not,\nwithout more, constitute justification for modifying a federal court order. The court went on to make two points\nrelated to the Cianci analysis. First, it found that the court-ordered regulations were not burdensome, citing Tink's\ntestimony at the hearing preceding its August, 1986, decision. Secondly, it found that the goals of the court order\nand the state statute were different: while the order was designed to protect the federal constitutional rights of\nplaintiffs, the \"statute enacted recently does nothing by way of preserving or protecting those rights.\" (Emphasis\nadded.) It found, therefore, that the statute was not a sufficient change in circumstances to warrant granting a\nRule 60(b) motion. The court did not explicate its reasoning for concluding that the statute did \"nothing\" to protect\nplaintiffs' rights.\nThe terseness of the district court's opinion necessitates that we conduct an extended analysis of the specific\nconflicts between the statute and the order. The first conflict concerns the status of the custodial member of the\nboard. The statute, unlike the order, would grant that individual voting rights on the board. Plaintiffs contend that\nthis change would conflict not only with the provisions of Part 408 but also with the terms and goals of the first\npartial consent decree, adopted in 1974.\nPlaintiffs' claim appears to be well-grounded in the language of the 1974 decree. The decree states in pertinent\npart:\n1. The Treatment Center at M.C.I. Bridgewater shall be treated as a facility of the Department of\nMental Health.\n2. Primary responsibility and authority for the Treatment Center shall be exercised by the\nDepartment of Mental Health.\n\n3. All personnel at the Treatment Center (clinical, custodial, administrative) shall be subject to the\ncontrol of the Commissioner of Mental Health with respect to the handling of patients.\n4. Custodial personnel, but not patients, shall be under the administrative, operational and\ndisciplinary control of the Commissioner of Correction.\n5. The Department of Mental Health shall exercise the responsibility and authority set forth in\nparagraph 2 above so that the patients at the Treatment Center should have the least restrictive\nconditions necessary to achieve the purpose of commitment. To implement this and other\nprovisions of this decree, the Department of Mental Health shall forthwith take steps jointly and in\ncooperation with the Department of Correction ... to do the following:\n[2]\na. Improve the physical plant....\nb. Implement a meaningful work program and increasing avocational activities....\nc. Have a system of differing security for different categories of patients....\nIt is understood that any budget proposal shall be the result of collaboration and cooperation\nbetween the Departments of Mental Health and Correction.\n6. The Department of Mental Health and the Department of Correction will also act in concert to\ndraw up and promulgate certain rules and regulations to apply to patients at the Treatment\nCenter.... [Emphases added.]\n1230 *1230 Thus, the first four paragraphs of the decree are devoted to stressing that primary authority over patients at\nthe Treatment Center is to be vested in the Department of Mental Health. Indeed, paragraph 4 specifically\nexcludes patients from the \"administrative, operational and disciplinary control of the Commissioner of\nCorrection.\" In light of this clause, the provisions in paragraphs 5 and 6 for the collaboration of the Departments\nof Correction and Mental Health appear to concern only general matters such as budgetary issues and the\ndrawing up of general rules governing the program. The decree appears to have envisaged that day-to-day\nresponsibility for patients would lie exclusively with the Department of Mental Health. We also note that the\ndistrict court's finding that control of the Center had not passed to the Department of Correction entered into its\ndecision not to issue a new order against defendants in August, 1986.\nIn order to determine whether giving voting rights to the custodial member of the board could constitute a\nsignificant violation of the goals of the decree and the provisions of the order, we turn to an examination of the\nexact role prescribed in Part 408 for the Pre-Review Release Board (PRRB). Under Part 408.05, the original\nrecommendation concerning a patient's application to participate in the AAP is made by a staff member at the\nCenter. A negative report by a staff member may be appealed by the patient to the PRRB. Positive\nrecommendations are also passed on to the PRRB. The PRRB may approve or disapprove of the patient's\napplication and may also specify certain \"conditions of release.\" If the PRRB makes a negative finding, the\npatient's application proceeds no further in the administrative process. A positive recommendation is passed on\nto the Administrator. The Administrator may approve or deny the application. The Administrator may also modify\nthe conditions of release recommended by the PRRB \"but only insofar as such modifications make those\nconditions equally or more stringent.\" This examination of Part 408.05 shows that the PRRB can play a\ndeterminative role both in the success of applications and in the specification of the conditions of release.\nThe granting of voting rights to the custodial member of the PRRB might, therefore, make a decisive difference in\nthe processing of individual applications. We, however, find it difficult to determine the likelihood of this and its\nsignificance in the actual administration of the program. For example, although we may engage in speculation,\nwe are offered little guidance in the record as to the precise reasons that the consent decree was so emphatic\nabout vesting authority in the Department of Mental Health and how those reasons would affect the status of the\ncustodial member of the PRRB. Yet, we would need to understand those reasons fully to determine whether the\nstatute threatens to undermine the goals of the decrees. Nor does the record offer anything about the\nconsiderations that have gone into the PRRB's processing of applications in the past and whether they are of a\n\nnature such as to suggest that the custodial member would be likely to evaluate applications in a significantly\ndifferent way than those members affiliated with the Department of Mental Health. A full consideration of these\nissues is crucial for a determination of the reality and significance of the conflict between the goals and essential\nprovisions of the statute, the consent decrees and the court order.\nWe turn to the second conflict between the order and the statute, the extension of the residency requirement to\ntwo years before a patient can be eligible for the AAP. Our attempt to understand the significance of this issue is\nagain frustrated by the district court's failure to make specific factual findings. We do not know whether the\nCenter, operating under Part 408, has in fact allowed any patients to participate in the program before two years\nof residency or whether it would be likely to do so in the future. If it is extremely unlikely that any patient will ever\nbe allowed to do so, and if that fact is based on justifiable considerations, then the difference between the order\n1231 and the statute on this point is largely academic. On the basis of the *1231 record before us, however, we have\nno way of knowing. Defendants' counsel claimed at oral argument that no patient is accepted within that time\nperiod; plaintiffs' counsel thought that some patients were accepted before two years had elapsed. Plaintiffs'\ncounsel also claimed that more patients would have been accepted within that time period but for the Center's\ninefficiency in processing applications. It is clear that specific factual findings are necessary to make possible an\nintelligent resolution of this issue.\nTo be sure, defendants point out that, at the time the suit was brought, plaintiffs did not have a constitutional right\nto a specific AAP but only to a program that passed constitutional muster. Depending on factual details which we\ndo not have, however, the two points of conflict discussed above might be of critical significance. The extent of\ncontrol exercised by the Department of Correction appears to have been an important consideration when the\nfirst decree was formulated. Similarly, the time frame for accepting patients into the AAP has repeatedly been an\nissue during this litigation. Delays in the processing of applications appear to have plagued the implementation of\nthe program at least until March of last year. Increasing the residency requirement to two years might further\nviolate the first consent decree's goal of providing patients with the \"least restrictive conditions necessary to\nachieve the purpose of commitment.\" Again, a factual inquiry, concerned with the significance of the length of the\nresidency requirement, is necessary.\nFurthermore, particularly in the context of institutional reform, the specifics of a court order remedying\nconstitutional violations do not necessarily derive from the Constitution with the rigor of a mathematical proof.\nRather, a whole series of prudential considerations enter into the formulation of such orders.\nIt is these considerations [of efficacy and fairness] that block the attribution of these specifics\n\"back into\" the Constitution. The rights these considerations give rise to might be thought of as\ninstrumental or remedial rights rather than constitutional rights proper, but it is equally important to\nrecognize that these instrumental or remedial rights are created by courts in discharge of their\nconstitutional function.\nFiss, The Supreme Court, 1978 Term, Foreword: The Forms of Justice, 93 Harv.L.Rev. 1, 50 (1979). See also\nChayes, The Role of the Judge in Public Law Litigation, 89 Harv.L.Rev. at 1293-94. The question is not whether\nthe original suit would have succeeded if the current statute had been in place and was functioning according to\nthe letter of the law. Rather, the question is whether the dangers that gave rise to the adoption of Part 408 have\nlessened to such an extent that the constraints of federalism should lead to the modification of the court order.\nThis requires a factual inquiry which we find ourselves unable to conduct on the basis of the record. Such factual\nfindings would provide the starting point for the delicate balancing required in deciding how to resolve the tension\nbetween the state statute and the court order.\nIV.\nThe third \"conflict\" between the 1978 order and the statute is of a more fundamental character than the two\nalready discussed and lies at the heart of this action. The statute provides that the program \"shall be\nadministered pursuant to the rules and regulations promulgated by the department of mental health.\" The court,\non the other hand, ordered in 1978 that the program shall be administered according to Part 408. Defendants\nseek to vacate the 1978 order to allow the state to administer its own program according to rules duly\n\npromulgated by state procedures. Defendants stated at oral argument that they would be willing to submit these\nrules to the district court before their final promulgation.\nOn its face, defendants' request has much to recommend it. Generally, it is preferable that a state program\noperate under constitutional state procedures than under a federal court order. We also appreciate defendants'\n1232 willingness to accept *1232 relief that would involve the submission of any new rules to the district court. Of\ncourse, such an arrangement would not, as a practical matter, differ greatly from the present situation in which\nany request for modification of Part 408 requires a motion before the district court.\nThe policy argument underlying defendants' request has been at issue in this litigation, at least implicitly, since its\ninception. For example, according to defendants' counsel, prior to the 1978 court order, the Part 408 regulations\nwere set to go through the state APA notice and comment process for promulgation. The district court, however,\nordered that Part 408, as modified by the various stipulations and orders, be implemented in its draft form, rather\n[3]\nthan be submitted to the state promulgation process.  Presumably, the court was alert to the issues of\nfederalism implicated by its decision. Nonetheless, the court decided that the other issues raised by the case\nrequired that it order that Part 408 be implemented in its draft form. No appeal was taken from this decision.\nDefendants' 1980 Rule 60(b) motion again implicated the policy argument of allowing the state to run its own\nprogram under its own rules and procedures. The court again apparently thought that the importance of the Part\n408 provisions overrode such policy considerations. Indeed, rather than discuss at length the more abstract issue\nraised by defendants' motion, it focused on the specific ways in which defendants' new proposed regulations\ndeparted from Part 408. The court thus treated the motion as a request for specific modifications of the 1978\norder, rejecting out of hand defendants' more fundamental request to be relieved from the 1978 order in order to\npromulgate state regulations \"according to the terms and provisions of state law.\" In denying the motion, the court\nstressed the detailed inquiries that preceded the adoption of Part 408 in its current form. \"[A]fter such an\ninvestigation of the facts and the needs and the law,\" it declared, any request to modify Part 408 would face a\nheavy burden. The motion was denied and no appeal was taken.\nThe district court's reasoning on the issue of specific modifications of Part 408 applies a fortiori to a blanket\nrequest to vacate Part 408 in favor of a wholly new set of regulations. Assuming such regulations would be\nsubmitted to the district court, that court would be constrained to conduct the same kind of \"protracted hearings\" it\nfound necessary prior to the 1978 court order. We note that over a year and a half elapsed between the inception\nof the lawsuit and the first consent decree. It took an additional three and a half years to translate the generalities\nof that decree into the final court order requiring the implementation of the concrete details of Part 408. Over the\nlast nine years, various judges have been involved in hearings and motions concerned with the enforcement of\nthose regulations. In the absence of a substantial change of circumstances, any proposal to do away with Part\n408, especially if new court hearings are required, would have to justify the reduplication of the considerable time\nand effort already expended in formulating and enforcing regulations for the governance of the AAP.\nWhen read in the light of this history of the district court's treatment of the tension between Part 408 and state\nprocedures, the court's rulings on the present motion take on a sharper focus. The district court stated that the\nnew state statute \"does nothing\" to protect plaintiffs' constitutional rights. The court was undoubtedly comparing\nthe detailed provisions of Part 408, adopted after the extended labor of hearings, stipulations and court orders,\nwith the statute's merely programmatic statement that the AAP would be administered according to not yet\nexisting state regulations. After such a comparison, it is only somewhat hyperbolic to say that the statute \"does\nnothing\" to protect plaintiffs' rights. It is understandable that the district court would be reluctant to scrap existing\n1233 regulations, which the courts and the *1233 parties have been trying to implement since 1978, in favor of some\nhypothetical substitute.\nNevertheless, the considerations of federalism, implicitly at stake throughout this litigation, have become\nconsiderably more important due to the directives of the new statute. We think, therefore, that defendants'\nrequests for relief deserve careful consideration, consideration that would view the legal principles in the context\nof the factual background. We are, however, bereft of the facts necessary to decide whether defendants' requests\nfor relief should be granted.\n\nThe factual findings necessary to make this decision include the history of the administration of the program\nunder Part 408. Defendants state in their brief that \"[t]he wisdom and experience of [programs like the AAP]\nshould be determined by the appropriate state officials.\" It is a matter for a factual inquiry, however, whether the\nhistory of the AAP since 1978 indicates that \"the appropriate state officials\" have shown the requisite \"wisdom\nand experience\" to warrant placing in their hands the authority and responsibility for drafting and implementing\nwholly new regulations governing the program. For example, in its August, 1986, decision, the district court found\nthat, as of February, 1986, the director of clinical services at the Center\napparently shared in an attitude that the Court Orders could be ignored if their implementation\naffected other activities adversely.... [H]e conceded that Center staff COULD have operated the\nauthorized absence program if \"pushed\" to do so. A federal court order is, apparently, not viewed\nas a \"push.\" [Emphases in original.]\nThe court went on to find that the appointment of Tink in March, 1986, began a process of improvement of\ncompliance with the court orders. The court found that it had reason to anticipate that Tink's efforts to implement\nthe goals of the program would be successful; it found that no additional order mandating compliance was\nnecessary.\nA determination of whether state officials should now be allowed to scrap Part 408 and draft and implement\nwholly new regulations demands a stricter investigation than that needed to decide whether to issue an order\nmandating compliance with regulations already existing and required by the court. We note that the improvement\nof compliance with various provisions of the court orders began a little over a year ago; that is not, from the\nperspective of this litigation, a very long time. In particular, we would need to know whether the district court's\nhopes for the new administration of the AAP have been borne out by the experience of the past year. We would\nalso need to know whether the unfortunate \"attitude\" prevailing prior to March, 1986, should be viewed as\nirrevocably a matter of history. Whether state officials should be entrusted with drafting and implementing wholly\nnew regulations depends, in part, on whether they have made the necessary efforts, and thereby gained the\nrequisite knowledge and experience, in running the AAP constitutionally over the past several years under the\n[4]\ncourt orders.\nOn the basis of the sparse factual record submitted to us, we would be loath to intervene precipitously in a case,\nsuch as the present one, involving years of work and delicate balances and negotiations on the part of judges,\ncounsel and parties. Intervention on our part to vacate the court order at the heart of this case, without the\n1234 requisite knowledge of the factual details and a full understanding of the stakes involved, *1234 would surely\nshow an unwarranted lack of respect for the work expended in fifteen years of proceedings before the district\ncourt. We decline, at this stage, to play the role of a bull in a china shop.\nDue to the foregoing considerations, we are remanding this case to the district court on all issues. In\nreconsidering the Rule 60(b) motion, the district court shall make factual findings, including, but not limited to, the\n[5]\ninquiries outlined above.\nRemanded.\n[1]See also Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 352, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 2679, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976) (opinion of Brennan,\nJ.): \"[T]he separation-of-powers principle ... has no applicability to the federal judiciary's relationship to the\nstates.\"\n[2] The terms of subsection 5(a) were superseded by the provisions of the second consent decree, entered in\nJanuary, 1975.\n[3] Regrettably, counsel did not submit the documents showing this sequence of events. Plaintiffs, however, do\nnot appear to contest this procedural history which took place when Judge Garrity was in charge of the case.\n[4] Although it is not directly on point, the case of Morris v. Travisono, 373 F.Supp. 177 (D.R.I.1974),aff'd,509\nF.2d 1358 (1st Cir.1975), may prove useful to the district court in its consideration of this case on remand. In that\n\ncase, court-ordered regulations were promulgated under a state APA. The issue was (a) whether the regulations\ncould be suspended under the provisions of the state APA, and (b) whether an injunction would be moot under\nthe court-ordered regulations because new regulations had been promulgated by defendants. The court rejected\nboth arguments; in reaching its decision, it noted past violations of the regulations and ruled that the \"court's\npower to grant relief survives the discontinuance of the illegal conduct\" if there is a reasonable expectation that\nthe conduct will be repeated. Id. at 184.\n[5] The court is also free to consider the various proposals for relief suggested in the course of the proceedings\non this motion. It may also consider a combination of these proposals. For example, as in the decree in Morris,\n373 F.Supp. at 179, it could order that Part 408 itself be promulgated pursuant to the Massachusetts APA. As in \nCianci, see570 F.2d at 14, the court should be flexible in framing a response to the motion to avoid any conflict\nwith the state statute when unnecessary for the goals underlying this litigation.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Greenblatt and \nWilliams v. Lesiak, and implicates Supreme Court caselaw addressing the circumstances under which such\ndecrees may be modified. See Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 112 S.Ct. 748, 116 L.Ed.2d\n867 (1992). In 1972 then civilly committed patients of the Massachusetts Treatment Center for Sexually\nDangerous Persons (\"Center\") brought constitutional challenges to the conditions of confinement and the\nadequacy of treatment at the Center. After finding that conditions violated the Constitution, the district court in\n1974 entered two consent decrees in King (the \"Original King\" decree and, one week later, the \"Supplemental\"\n[1]\ndecree) and one consent decree in Williams.\nIn 1996, in the orders now on appeal, the district court modified all three decrees. It relied on our decision in King\nv. Greenblatt, 52 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.1995), where we found that Rufo's requirement of a significant change in fact or\nlaw was met as to five provisions of the Original King and Williams decrees by a new Massachusetts statute,\n1993 Mass. Acts ch. 489, which transferred jurisdiction over those in plaintiffs' position from the Department of\nMental Health (\"DMH\") to the Department of Corrections (\"DOC\"). We made no finding, however, as to the\nSupplemental decree.\nIn this appeal, appellants pursue a number of issues stemming from changes to the decrees. As to the Original \nKing and Williams decrees, we are satisfied with the adequacy of the record to enable us to decide the appeal.\nAs for the district court's rationale for modifying the Supplemental decree, however, it is our view that the change\nin law we identified does not, alone, justify modification of the Supplemental decree under Rufo. We therefore\nremand without further delay to the district court for a hearing and findings concerning whether a significant\nchange in fact or law has occurred with respect to the specific issues covered by the Supplemental decree. We\nreserve jurisdiction over the appeal, and will consider all issues together after the district court submits its findings\nto us.\nI.\nWe begin by briefly sketching the legal backdrop for the appeal, and outlining the litigation history of the case. In\nsection II we discuss why we believe the district court erred in approving modification of the Supplemental\ndecree.\nThe principles that guide us were set out in Rufo, which established the standard for evaluating proposed\nmodifications to a consent decree \"that arguably relates to the vindication of a constitutional right.\" Rufo, 502 U.S.\nat 383 n. 7, 112 S.Ct. at 760 n. 7. Under Rufo, a party seeking modification of a consent decree has the burden\n192 of meeting two requirements. The party \"may meet its initial burden by showing ... a significant *192 change\neither in factual conditions or in law.\" Id. at 384, 112 S.Ct. at 760. \"If the moving party meets this standard, the\n[2]\ncourt should consider whether the proposed modification is suitably tailored to the changed circumstance.\" Id.\nThus, the question of whether a modification is suitably tailored will not come into play unless the burden of\ndemonstrating a significant change in factual conditions or law has been carried. Our analysis here concerns only\nwhether the requisite initial showing of significant change in fact or law was made as to the Supplemental decree.\nThis analysis requires a review of the case history directly relevant to the modification of the Supplemental\n[3]\ndecree.\nThe first five provisions of the 1974 Original King and Williams consent decrees contained parallel language\nprohibiting the Department of Corrections from making treatment decisions at the Center, allowing DOC\ngovernance only as to custodial personnel, placing primary responsibility and authority in the Department of\nMental Health, and emphasizing that patients should have the least restrictive conditions necessary to achieve\nthe purposes of commitment. These provisions tracked the language of then Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123A, § 2,\n[4]\nwhich authorized DMH governance of patients and treatment at the Center.\nThe Supplemental decree addressed King's specific complaints concerning use of isolation at the Center. In\naddition to requiring that sequestered patients be afforded minimum standards of due process and human\ndecency, the Supplemental decree stated,\n\nDefendants shall not use or permit the use of solitary confinement at the Treatment Center at\nMassachusetts Correctional Institute, Bridgewater, for the purpose of discipline or punishment,\ndisciplinary and punitive procedures having no place in the care and treatment of civilly committed\n[5]\npatients.\n193 *193\nIn 1994 the Massachusetts state legislature amended chapter 123A with 1993 Mass. Acts ch. 489. Section 2 of\nchapter 489 provides, \"[t]he commissioner of correction shall maintain subject to the jurisdiction of the\ndepartment of correction a treatment program or branch thereof at a correctional institution for the care, custody,\ntreatment and rehabilitation of persons [ad]judicated as being sexually dangerous.\" The law thus shifted\njurisdiction from DMH to DOC.\nResponding to the change in law, defendants sought to modify the Original King and Williams decrees,\nspecifically the first five provisions of the decrees and a sixth provision setting forth a time schedule for DMH to\nimplement requirements of the decrees. They argued that the passage of chapter 489 constituted \"a significant\nchange in circumstances warrant[ing] revision of the decree,\" in satisfaction of Rufo. Judge Mazzone denied the\nmotion to modify, citing in part lack of information and recommending that DOC submit specific details and\ninformation concerning its proposed treatment plans.\nThe defendants appealed the denial to this court. While that appeal was pending, the defendants filed a renewed\nmotion to modify, seeking the same modifications and, for the first time, modification of the Supplemental consent\ndecree. They requested that the court replace the Supplemental decree's language \"for the purpose of discipline\nor punishment, disciplinary and punitive procedures having no place in the care and treatment of civilly committed\npatients\" with \"for the purpose of punishing residents for the acts underlying their commitment.\" The proposed\nchange thus barred punitive sequestration only for the conduct that triggered commitment, permitting its use for\nacts occurring during the patient's stay at the Center. As grounds for altering the Supplemental decree,\ndefendants stated, \"This modification will permit the implementation of a system of behavior management at the\nTreatment Center, and will further the goals of the cognitive treatment program by helping residents to take\nresponsibility for their actions.\"\nIn support of their renewed motion to modify, defendants submitted a lengthy plan for administration and\nmanagement of the Center (\"Plan\"). The Plan sets forth policies for management and staffing, clinical treatment,\neducational and vocational treatment, behavior management, resident management operations, community\naccess, and integration of the Center with the prison's program for sex offenders.\nAbout six months later, while the renewed motion to modify was pending before the district court, we issued our\ndecision in King, 52 F.3d 1. We found that chapter 489 amounted to a significant change in law with respect to\nthe first five provisions of the Original King and Williams decrees. Modification of those decrees therefore was\npermissible under Rufo. Id. at 5-6. However, because Rufo also requires that any \"proposed modification be\nsuitably tailored to the changed circumstance,\" we remanded to the district court for determination as to whether\nthe proposed modifications were suitably tailored. Id. at 7 (citing Rufo, 502 U.S. at 391, 112 S.Ct. at 763-64).\nOn remand, the district court approved all of the requested modifications. After noting that our opinion resolved\nthe question of whether the first prong of Rufo had been met, the district court focused its analysis on whether the\nmodifications met Rufo's second prong. Emphasizing the Plan's comprehensiveness and inclusion of provisions\naddressing potential problems, the court followed our directive to give significant weight to the views of the local\ngovernment officials who would be implementing any modifications. See King v. Greenblatt, No. 72-7888, slip op.\nat 8-9 (D. Mass. June 25, 1995). Finding also that the proposed changes would not create or perpetuate\nconstitutional violations, the district court concluded that the modifications were suitably tailored to the change in\nlaw, and retained, as we recommended, its \"jurisdictional oversight\" to ensure DOC's compliance with the\ndecrees. Id.\nShortly thereafter, in response to plaintiffs' numerous objections to the modifications and their motion to stay\n194 implementation of the changes, the district court suspended five aspects of its order, including *194 modification\nof the Supplemental decree, to allow further briefing and a hearing. King v. Greenblatt, No. 72-788, slip op. at 2-4\n\n(D.Mass. July 31, 1995). Following the hearing, the district court issued an order lifting its stay. See King v.\nGreenblatt, No. 72-788, slip op. (D.Mass. Oct. 31, 1996). All modifications requested by defendants in their\nrenewed motion to modify are now in effect.\nPlaintiffs subsequently filed this appeal, raising numerous challenges to the modification of the decrees. We\nreview the district court's application of Rufo de novo. See Inmates v. Rufo, 12 F.3d 286, 291 (1st Cir. 1993). At\nthis time, we choose to address only the district court's modification of the Supplemental decree, which appears\nto have resulted from its erroneous application of our decision in King. Believing that the court should have the\nopportunity to reconsider the proposed modification in light of the applicable principles, we remand the case for\nreconsideration based on our discussion in the following section. After the district court's ruling, and after\nreceiving comments from the parties, we will review the remaining contentions concerning the modifications.\nII.\nOur earlier decision in this case, finding a significant change in law with respect to the first five provisions of the\nOriginal King and Williams decrees, expressly stated that those were the only terms that the defendants sought\nto modify. See King, 52 F.3d at 2 n. 2, 4. Our remand, therefore, was limited to a consideration of those\nprovisions, which directly concerned DMH and DOC control of the Center.\nThe district court, however, considered all of the proposals presented in defendants' renewed motion to modify,\nincluding the Supplemental decree. In the order lifting its stay of the modification, the court used the following\nstandard to determine whether modification of the Supplemental decree was warranted: \"Given that Chapter 489\nhas been found to be a significant change in law by the First Circuit, analysis of the Commonwealth's argument in\nfavor of modification rightfully starts there. If the modification is unrelated to the change in law, then clearly an\nindependent significant change in circumstances is necessary to justify modification.\" See King, No. 72-788, slip\nop. at 19 (Oct. 31, 1996) (citation omitted).\nThe district court then went on to conclude that the Supplemental decree fell under the change in law we had\npreviously recognized because it was \"sufficiently related\" to that change. Id. In reaching that conclusion, the\ncourt placed great weight on our ruminations concerning the reasons behind the legislative decision to amend\nchapter 123A with chapter 489. It focused particularly on the following statement from our earlier opinion:\nChapter 489 reflects Massachusetts' legislative judgment that one agency rather than two can\nbest perform the conflicting functions of the Treatment Center, i.e., maintain security as well as\nprovide treatment. As the district court noted, no one regards dual administration of the Treatment\nCenter as workable. But why give DOC the run of the place? The legislature apparently accepted\nthe professional opinion that behavior modification or control, rather than traditional mental health\ntreatment, is the most effective way to protect society from sexually dangerous persons and such\npersons from themselves. The correctness of this view is not before us; what matters is whether\nthe goals of ch. 489 necessarily conflict with the rights enforced by the federal consent decree,\nand the importance of any such conflict to the overall goals of the litigation.\nKing, 52 F.3d at 5. The district court read this passage as evidence that we \"clearly viewed the very purpose of\nthe change in law as contemplating that DOC would implement its own policies and procedures.\" See King, No.\n72-788, slip op. at 19 (Oct. 31, 1996). It thus concluded that \"the proposed modifications [to the Supplemental\ndecree] were sufficiently related to the change in law and may properly be reviewed for satisfaction of the second\nprong of Rufo.\" Id. at 19-20.\nWe agree with the district court's threshold analysis that an independent significant change, defined by Rufo as a\n195 change in factual circumstances or in law, is required to *195 justify modification. We disagree, however, with the\ncourt's application of this standard.\nOur earlier decision that enactment of chapter 489, which shifted management of the Center, constituted a\nsignificant change in law with respect to the first five provisions of the Original King and Williams decrees was\ninescapable since each of those provisions concerns administration of the facilities. In our view, however, new\n\nmanagement of the facility does not inevitably require a change in the way solitary confinement is used, and\nchapter 489 therefore does not, at least without further explanation, constitute a significant change in law with\nrespect to the Supplemental decree, which concerns only issues of sequestration.\nThe district court apparently believed there was enough of a connection between chapter 489 and sequestration,\nrelying in large part on our language speculating about the legislature's motivations. Yet our theory as to why the\nlegislature amended chapter 123A cannot, standing alone, form the basis for a finding of change in fact or law.\nThe party seeking to modify a consent decree carries the burden of showing a specific significant change in the\nunderlying factual circumstances or the legal principles integral to the original order. Our speculation as to a\nphilosophical shift in mental health care does not by itself satisfy this burden; while clearly not a change in law, it\nalso does not meet the required showing for a change in fact. \"The sort of factual changes that may qualify\ninclude unanticipated developments that render continuation of the decree `inequitable,' or that, `for reasons\nunrelated to past discrimination or the fault of the parties,' make it extremely difficult or impossible to satisfy\nobligations that, while imposed by the decree, are not part of its fundamental purpose.\" Ensley Branch, NAACP v.\nSeibels, 31 F.3d 1548, 1562-63 (11th Cir.1994) (citations omitted). A party relying on a philosophical shift to justify\nchanges in a consent decree must spell out the fair implications of the shift and must demonstrate that continued\nadherence to the decree will be inequitable, unfair or untenable.\nWhile there may be some circumstances in which discrete practices within an institution will be so intimately and\ninherently related to changes in administration that modification would be warranted, in this case the link between\nthe shift in management of the Center and use of sequestration as punishment is too tenuous, at least without\nfurther development. The record demonstrates no reason why the principles underlying the Supplemental decree\n00 that sequestration not be used to punish patients 00 could not be implemented in a facility where ultimate\n97 97\nauthority rests with DOC. Simply because punishment is a primary element of typical correctional programs does\nnot necessarily mean that it need be the basis for programs designed for civilly committed sexual abusers. The\ndistrict court's approach would result in modification of any substantive treatment or procedure in effect under\nDMH and to which DOC now objects, without an inquiry into whether the particular provisions for which\nmodification is sought are themselves directly impacted by the change in law.\nBecause Rufo applies only when constitutional rights are involved, courts must give punctilious regard to its two-\npart hurdle, carefully and thoroughly analyzing whether the requisite change has occurred and whether the\nproposed modifications are suitably tailored to that change. So that the district court may undertake such an\nanalysis with respect to the Supplemental consent decree, we vacate its order modifying the decree and remand\nthis portion of the appeal to that court for further findings. We expect that the court will schedule a hearing for\npresentation of views on this issue and request written submissions from the parties. We leave it to the court to\ndecide whether any further factual or opinion evidence is necessary. We invite the parties to request the clerk of\nthis court to set a schedule for supplemental briefing to us once the district court has made its finding. We\nreserve the other issues on appeal until such time as we have all issues before us.\nThe order modifying the Supplemental decree is vacated, and the case is remanded for a hearing and findings in\naccordance with this opinion. In the interim, we retain appellate jurisdiction.\n[1] It also entered a Partial consent decree in 1975. This decree arose from issues raised in Williams, but is\ndistinct from the 1974 decree entered in Williams and to which we now refer as the Williams decree. No aspect of\nthe Partial consent decree is explicitly at issue here.\n[2] For modifications to meet the suitably tailored requirement, they must not create or perpetuate a constitutional\nviolation and should address and accommodate difficulties created by the changed circumstances. See Rufo,\n502 U.S. at 391, 112 S.Ct. at 764 (emphasizing that \"[a] court should do no more, for a consent decree is a final\njudgment that may be reopened only to the extent that equity requires\"). Where these conditions are met, the\ncourt should give deference to the local government officials who will be responsible for resolving difficulties and\ncarrying out the provisions of institutional reform. Id.\n[3] In the course of addressing numerous suits seeking to enforce or modify the decrees, we have abundantly\nreviewed the lengthy history of litigation in this case. See In re Pearson, 990 F.2d 653 (1st Cir.1993); Pearson v.\n\nFair, 935 F.2d 401 (1st. Cir.1991); Langton v. Johnston, 928 F.2d 1206 (1st Cir.1991); Williams v. Lesiak, 822 F.2d\n1223 (1st Cir.1987); Pearson v. Fair, 808 F.2d 163 (1st Cir.1986). Accordingly, we present here only a limited\ndescription of the complex litigation history.\n[4] Chapter 123A, entitled \"Care, Treatment and Rehabilitation of Sexually Dangerous Persons,\" provided in\nsection 2, in relevant part: \nThe commissioner of mental health shall establish and maintain, subject to the jurisdiction of the department of\nmental health, a treatment center ... at a correctional institution approved by the commissioner of correction, for\nthe care, custody, treatment and rehabilitation of [sexually dangerous] persons.... The commissioner of correction\nshall appoint such custodial personnel as may be required for such center. Such custodial personnel shall be\nsubject to the control of the commissioner of mental health with respect to the care, treatment and rehabilitation\nof persons in their custody, but shall at all times be under the administrative, operational and disciplinary control\nof the commissioner of correction. The commissioner of mental health shall appoint to such center, in addition to\nthe personnel appointed by the commissioner of correction, adequate personnel for the care, treatment and\nrehabilitation of such persons committed to their care.\n[5] In 1981 six Center patients, known as Pearson et al., sought enforcement of the consent decrees with respect\nto sequestration only. After a series of motions and orders, in 1988 United States District Judge Young issued\ninjunctions \"to provide a more precise order ... to protect the rights of all parties and to implement the thrust of the\nearlier consent decree and supplementary consent decree.\" See Pearson v. Fair, No. 81-3219, slip op. (D.Mass.\nNov. 21, 1988). Among these injunctions were requirements that isolation could be used only in emergency\nsituations (defined as when the patient attempts or does serious harm to himself and others, where the patient\nseriously disrupts the therapeutic environment, or where the patient's conduct presents a serious and imminent\nthreat of the above), and that clinicians review sequestration decisions. Id. In 1989, after reviewing the\ninjunctions, Judge Mazzone stayed any order vacating them until a comprehensive review of their need took\nplace. See Pearson v. Fair, No. 81-3219, slip op. at 169 (D.Mass. Aug. 28, 1989). The injunctions remained in\neffect until Judge Mazzone's 1996 order lifting the stay. See King v. Greenblatt, No. 72-788, slip op. at 32\n(D.Mass. Oct. 31, 1996).\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Bridgewater, Defendants,\nAppellants.\nNo. 94-1751.\nUnited States Court of Appeals, First Circuit.\nHeard February 10, 1995.\nDecided April 6, 1995.\nWilliam L. Pardee, Asst. Atty.

The history of the litigation has been exhaustively covered: In re Pearson, 990 F.2d 653 (1st\nCir.1993) (Pearson III), Pearson v. Fair, 935 F.2d 401 (1st Cir.1991) (Pearson II), Langton v. Johnston, 928 F.2d\n1206 (1st Cir.1991),Williams v. Lesiak, 822 F.2d 1223 (1st Cir.1987), and Pearson v. Fair, 808 F.2d 163 (1st\nCir.1986) (per curiam) (Pearson I). We review the case history only to put this appeal in perspective.\nI.\nKing alleged that he had been deprived of due process and other federal constitutional rights by the defendants,\nspecifically by officials of the DOC, who allegedly placed him in solitary confinement without notice of the charges\nagainst him or a meaningful opportunity to be heard. DOC's actions allegedly interfered with King's treatment by\nthe Department of Mental Health (DMH), the agency vested with primary jurisdiction over the Treatment Center. \n[1]\nSee Mass.Gen.L. ch. 123A, § 2.  Thus, an element of this litigation, present from the very beginning, has been\nDOC's alleged usurpation of DMH's statutory authority over patients at the Treatment Center, during which\nusurpation the patients' constitutional rights were allegedly violated. Invoking both the Federal Constitution and\nstate law, King sought declaratory and injunctive relief from the DOC's sequestration practices.\nIn 1974, the district court held a hearing on King's allegations and entered a consent decree that provided, in\nrelevant part:\n1. The Treatment Center at MCI Bridgewater shall be treated as a facility of the Department of\nMental Health.\n2. Primary responsibility and authority for the Treatment Center shall be exercised by the\nDepartment of Mental Health.\n3. All personnel at the Treatment Center (clinical, custodial, administrative) shall be subject to the\ncontrol of the Commissioner of Mental Health with respect to the handling of patients.\n\n4. Custodial personnel, but not patients, shall be under the administrative, operational and\ndisciplinary control of the Commissioner of Correction.\n5. The Department of Mental Health shall exercise the responsibility and authority set forth in\nsubparagraph 2 above so that patients at the Treatment Center should have the least restrictive\nconditions necessary to achieve the purposes of commitment....\nThe first four paragraphs of the consent decree closely track the requirements of ch. 123A, § 2, the law in effect\n[2]\nwhen the consent decree was entered.\nOver time, the residents of the Treatment Center brought various suits to enforce or to modify the consent\n3 decrees. In 1988, the Commonwealth sought unsuccessfully to vacate *3 the decrees. \"The stream of litigation\noccasionally overflowed the district court,\" Pearson III, 990 F.2d at 655, and this court as well.\nWhile the residents were attempting to enforce the consent decrees, forces on the sidelines of the litigation were\nmobilizing to amend ch. 123A. Beginning in 1986, Massachusetts' executive branch filed a number of legislative\nbills that sought to transfer control of the Treatment Center from DMH to DOC. None of these bills were adopted\nuntil 1994, when the Massachusetts legislature enacted St.1993, ch. 489. Chapter 489 purports to transfer all\nauthority over the Treatment Center to the DOC, in direct contravention of the first five paragraphs of the consent\ndecree. Section 2 of ch. 489 provides that \"[t]he commissioner of correction shall maintain subject to the\njurisdiction of the department of correction a treatment program or branch thereof at a correctional institution for\nthe care, custody, treatment and rehabilitation of persons [ad]judicated as being sexually dangerous.\"\nThe defendants immediately moved under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(5) to modify the decree so that DOC might assume\nplenary authority over the Treatment Center, subject to all other substantive and procedural requirements of the\n[3]\ndecree.  Their sole argument was that the Massachusetts legislature's enactment of ch. 489 constituted \"a\nsignificant change in circumstances warrant[ing] revision of the decree.\" See Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County\nJail, 502 U.S. 367, 383, 112 S.Ct. 748, 759-60, 116 L.Ed.2d 867 (1992) (setting forth standard for modification of\nconsent decrees, and reversing the decision of this circuit).\nThe district court denied the motion from the bench: \"On the record that is now before me, and incorporated into\nthat record, everything that I have learned about the case and found in the case from the trials of the Bruder and\nthe Pearson cases [companion cases], I will conclude at this time that the defendants have not sustained their\nburden of showing a significant change in law or fact under Rufo.\" The court also made the following findings:\nI do find that the consent decrees sought to address federal constitutional violations articulated by \nKing and in Williams [a related case].\nA critical component of the remedy provided by the consent decrees was that the Department of\nMental Health was in control of the Treatment Center which was to provide, in part, a check on the\nDepartment of Correction[,] which compromised treatment.\nI conclude that the Department of Mental Health is an essential part of the decree, and on the\nrecord before me at this time, the Department of Correction has done nothing yet that I can see\nwhich warrants my placing confidence in its ability to deliver ... patient treatment.\nI conclude at this time that the Department of Correction's control of the Treatment Center\ncompromises the federal constitutional remedy which the consent decree sought to impose, and\nwould compromise the federal constitutional rights which the consent decrees sought to protect.\n....\nWill the Department of Correction provide th[e] same treatment [as DMH]? That's not shown. If\nthey were to provide that treatment, if there were to be a case-specific inquiry in what the\nDepartment of Correction was going to do and proposed to do, then perhaps I would be able to\nrule otherwise. But at this point, there is not that showing....\n\nThe district court invited the Commonwealth to propose ways to modify the decree that would preserve the\nfederal constitutional remedies, and yet accommodate the change in the underlying state law. It noted, however,\nthat \"we're not going to go anywhere\" before the defendants have tested the court's interpretation of Rufo on\n4 appeal.[4] Undeterred, *4 the defendants filed a renewed motion for modification and a motion to vacate the\nconsent decrees while this appeal was pending.\nII.\nWe review the district court's application of the Rufo standard, and the more general requirements for granting\nrelief from a final judgment under Rule 60(b)(5), for errors of law or abuse of discretion. See Alexis Lichine & Cie.\nv. Lichine Estate Selections, Ltd., 45 F.3d 582, 586-87 (1st Cir. 1995). Rufo held that \"a party seeking\nmodification of a consent decree bears the burden of establishing that a significant change\" in either factual\nconditions or in law \"warrants revision of the decree.\" 502 U.S. at 383-84, 112 S.Ct. at 760. If the moving party\nmeets this standard, \"the court should consider whether the proposed modification is suitably tailored to the\nchanged circumstance.\" Id. at 383, 112 S.Ct. at 760. This \"standard ... applies when a party seeks modification of\na term of a consent decree that arguably relates to the vindication of a constitutional right.\" Id. at 383 n. 7, 112\nS.Ct. at 760 n. 7.\nRufo instructed district courts to \"exercise flexibility in considering requests for modification of ... institutional\nreform consent decree[s]\" because such decrees \"`reach beyond the parties involved directly in the suit and\nimpact on the public's right to the sound and efficient operation of its institutions.'\" Id. at 381, 383, 112 S.Ct. at\n759, 759-60 (quoting Health v. De Courcy, 888 F.2d 1105, 1109 (6th Cir.1989)). We have echoed these concerns.\nSee, e.g., Pearson III, 990 F.2d at 658 (\"In institutional reform litigation, injunctions should not operate inviolate in\nperpetuity.\"); Mackin v. City of Boston, 969 F.2d 1273, 1275 (1st Cir.1992) (\"we believe that district courts should\nbe flexible in considering requests for relaxation of, or release from, decrees which were initially established to\nbring about needed institutional reforms\"), cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 113 S.Ct. 1043, 122 L.Ed.2d 352 (1993).\nNotwithstanding the application of this \"less stringent, more flexible standard,\" a modification \"must not create or\nperpetuate a constitutional violation.\" Rufo, 502 U.S. at 380, 391, 112 S.Ct. at 758, 763.\nIII.\nWe shall refer to the first five paragraphs of the 1974 consent decree as \"structural\" terms, inasmuch as they\nincorporate the administrative structure mandated by state law. These are the only terms the defendants seek to\nmodify. For the purposes of their motion, the defendants assume that the structural terms \"arguably relate[] to the\nvindication of a constitutional right.\" Id. at 383 n. 7, 112 S.Ct. at 760 n. 7. Of course, if the terms at issue were\ndirectly mandated by the Constitution, a change in state law without more would not warrant a modification.\nModifiable terms will typically fall somewhere along a spectrum: in general, terms that directly implement\nconstitutional requirements 00 e.g., a predeprivation hearing to satisfy procedural due process 00 will be more\n97 97\nclosely related to the vindication of a constitutional right than terms that lay the groundwork for other remedial\nmeasures.\nWe think that the structural terms in this case belong in the latter class. The Constitution itself is indifferent to\nwhether DOC or DMH administers the Treatment Center. If, however, as King alleged, DOC personnel violated\nhis constitutional rights in the process of usurping DMH's authority and interfering with his clinical treatment, then\n5 a decree keeping DOC within its statutory ambit *5 begins to make sense in the context of a constitutional\nremedy. Although we, unlike the district court, would have eschewed the words \"essential\" and \"critical,\" we think\nthe structural terms were clearly, not just arguably, related to the constitutional remedy provided by the decrees.\nThis is not to say that a change in the statutory scheme cannot be a significant change in law that warrants\n[5]\nmodification of the structural terms.  In the context of King, the structural terms may have been a means to a\nconstitutional end; but it was possible to include them in the decree only because Massachusetts law already\nstructured the Treatment Center in the same way. If existing state law had granted DOC exclusive jurisdiction\n\nover the Treatment Center, the parties could not have agreed to insert DMH into the administrative structure.\nThus, a change in the very law underlying the structural terms is likely to be \"significant\" under Rufo, and may\ntherefore require some modification of the structural terms.\nThis preliminary analysis is consistent with our own decisions before and after Rufo. In Rufo, the Supreme Court\noffered several examples of potentially significant changes in federal law. See id. at 388-90, 112 S.Ct. at 762-63\n(\"one or more of the obligations placed upon the parties has become impermissible under federal law\"; \"the\nstatutory or decisional law has changed to make legal what the decree was designed to prevent\"; \"a decision that\nclarifies the law\" has undermined an agreement based on \"a misunderstanding of the governing law\"). Although\nnone of the examples from Rufo is on point here, our decision in Williams, which predated Rufo, suggests the\nproper test for significance in this case. If a subsequent state statute appears to overlap or conflict with a federal\nconsent decree, \"and the conflict ... is less than clear, delicate questions of federalism must enter into our\ninquiry.\" See id.,822 F.2d at 1228 (citing Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362, 379, 96 S.Ct. 598, 608, 46 L.Ed.2d 561\n(1976) (federalism must be considered in determining scope of equitable relief)). The district court should conduct\na \"careful case-specific inquiry\" into both the decree and the statute \"to discover whether their objectives and\nprovisions necessarily conflict and to consider the importance of the areas of conflict to the overall goals of the\nlitigation.\" Id.\nWe think that the nuanced, case-specific approach of Williams is consistent with the strictures of Rufo and with\nthe equitable nature of relief from a decree under Rule 60(b)(5). See Rufo, 502 U.S. at 383, 112 S.Ct. at 760\n(noting that Rule 60(b)(5) permits relief from a court order when \"`it is no longer equitable that the judgment\nshould have prospective application'\"). See also Mackin, 969 F.2d at 1278 (\"the decision as to whether to modify\nor dissolve [a structural decree] is at bottom an exercise of equitable power\" that calls for a \"deferential standard\nof review\").\nChapter 489 reflects Massachusetts' legislative judgment that one agency rather than two can best perform the\nconflicting functions of the Treatment Center, i.e., maintain security as well as provide treatment. As the district\ncourt noted, no one regards dual administration of the Treatment Center as workable. But why give DOC the run\nof the place? The legislature apparently accepted the professional opinion that behavior modification or control,\nrather than traditional mental health treatment, is the most effective way to protect society from sexually\ndangerous persons and such persons from themselves. The correctness of this view is not before us; what\nmatters is whether the goals of ch. 489 necessarily conflict with the rights enforced by the federal consent\ndecree, and the importance of any such conflict to the overall goals of the litigation. Williams, 822 F.2d at 1228.\nThe extent and importance of the conflict can be exaggerated or trivialized, as the parties have tried to do. We\nthink that the conflict is real but not so fundamental that ch. 489 necessarily thwarts the overall goals of the King\n6 litigation. King's primary goal was to ensure that his treatment complied *6 with the Constitution. The structural\nterms of the decree may serve that goal by keeping DOC, allegedly the offending actor, out of DMH's province;\nbut as we have explained, those terms would have been inconceivable without the underlying state law. After all,\nplaintiffs cannot claim that DOC control per se violates the Constitution. With the amendment of ch. 123A, the\ngoverning state law no longer gives DMH any role to play. In light of these federalism concerns, we think there\nhas certainly been a \"significant change ... in law\" within the meaning of Rufo, and that the plaintiffs cannot\nenforce the structural terms of the decree in perpetuity. See Pearson III, 990 F.2d at 658.\nIn holding that the defendants had not shown a significant change in law, the district court apparently relied upon\nour decision in Coalition of Black Leadership v. Cianci, 570 F.2d 12 (1st Cir.1978). The consent decree in Cianci\nestablished a procedure whereby residents of Providence, Rhode Island, could file complaints against their police\nofficers for alleged civil rights violations. The Rhode Island legislature subsequently enacted a \"Law Enforcement\nOfficers' Bill of Rights\" which conflicted in part with the decree. There was an \"obvious subject matter overlap\nbetween the decree and the legislation,\" which served \"dual and partially inconsistent purposes.\" Id. at 14. The\nCity of Providence moved to vacate the decree, and the district court denied the motion. We affirmed, noting that\nthe court had \"ordered both parties to work out modifications in the decree so that the protection of policemen's\nrights mandated by state law and the right of plaintiffs to be free from `racially discriminatory police conduct' could\n[,] to the extent possible, both be achieved.\" Id. at 13 (emphasis added). Moreover, we emphasized the district\ncourt's statement that\n\nthe Court is inclined to look with deference upon the alternate procedural means embodied in the\n1976 Act.... If the Rhode Island legislature has determined that the rights of police officers are in\nneed of protection and that this protection can best be achieved by adoption of certain procedural\nprotections, the Court is not prepared to question this judgment or to stand in the way of its\nimplementation in the absence of any showing that the 1976 Act will hamper the effective\npresentation of civilian complaints which the consent decree has apparently accomplished.\nId. at 14 n. 1. We approved the district court's flexible approach for resolving the conflict between the decree and\nthe Act, even though the decree in Cianci, unlike that in King, did not incorporate an administrative structure\nbased on superseded state law. Cf. Williams, 822 F.2d at 1234 n. 5 (on remand, \"[a]s in Cianci ... the court should\nbe flexible in framing a response to the motion to avoid any conflict with the state statute when unnecessary for\nthe goals underlying this litigation\"). If anything, this case presents the stronger argument for modification, given\nthe source of the structural terms, their relationship to the constitutional remedy, and the legislature's autonomy to\nrestructure the governmental institutions of the Commonwealth.\nIV.\nHaving found a significant change in law, we now \"focus ... on whether the proposed modification is tailored to\nresolve the problems created by the change in circumstances.\" Rufo, 502 U.S. at 391, 112 S.Ct. at 763. \"Of\ncourse, a modification must not create or perpetuate a constitutional violation.\" Id. at 391, 112 S.Ct. at 763.\nThe district court evidently feared that the proposed modification would produce a de facto increase in\nconstitutional violations at the Treatment Center, even if there is nothing unconstitutional de jure about DOC's\nassuming plenary authority. Based on its assessment of the history of this litigation, the court concluded \"at this\ntime\" that DOC's control of the Treatment Center would compromise the federal constitutional remedies imposed\nby the consent decree, and the federal constitutional rights that the decree sought to protect. Critically, the\ndefendants had not shown \"what the Department of Correction ... proposed to do\" to \"provide th[e] same\ntreatment\" as DMH under the remainder of the decree. Had the defendants made such a showing, \"then perhaps\n[the district court] would be able to rule otherwise.\"\n7 *7 This leaves us unsure of the district court's reason(s) for denying the proposed modification. Earlier in the\nhearing, the court had ruled that ch. 489 is not a significant change in law. Perhaps it was now saying that ch.\n489 might be a significant change in law that warrants modification of the consent decree, but the defendants had\nnot yet demonstrated as a practical matter that the modification would be implemented without producing or\nexacerbating constitutional violations at the Treatment Center. In fact, the defendants submitted no testimonial or\ndocumentary evidence of DOC's transfer plans; nor did they request an evidentiary hearing. On the sparse\nrecord before the district court, in light of the court's inconsistent observations, we cannot say whether the court\nproperly denied modification for lack of suitable tailoring. See Rufo, 502 U.S. at 383, 112 S.Ct. at 759-60. The\nprudent course is to remand for a new hearing.\nOn remand, the district court may inquire into DOC's transfer plans. We note, however, that \"once a court has\ndetermined that a modification is warranted, ... principles of federalism and simple common sense require the\ncourt to give significant weight to the views of the local government officials who must implement any\nmodification.\" Id. at 392 n. 14, 112 S.Ct. at 764 n. 14. \"[T]he public interest and considerations based on the\nallocation of powers within our federal system ... require that the district court defer to local government\nadministrators, who have the `primary responsibility for elucidating, assessing, and solving' the problems of\ninstitutional reform, to resolve the intricacies of implementing a decree modification.\" Id. at 392, 112 S.Ct. at 764\n(quoting Brown v. Board of Educ., 349 U.S. 294, 299, 75 S.Ct. 753, 756, 99 L.Ed. 1083 (1955)) (other citations\nand quotation marks omitted). The district court should rely primarily on its jurisdictional oversight to ensure\nDOC's compliance with the decrees.\nRemanded.\n\n[1] Section 2 of ch. 123A (as amended through St.1959, ch. 615) provided in pertinent part: \"The commissioner of\nmental health shall establish and maintain, subject to the jurisdiction of the department of mental health, a\ntreatment center ... at a correctional institution approved by the commissioner of correction, for the care, custody,\ntreatment and rehabilitation of [sexually dangerous] persons.... The commissioner of correction shall appoint such\ncustodial personnel as may be required for such center. Such custodial personnel shall be subject to the control\nof the commissioner of mental health with respect to the care, treatment and rehabilitation of persons in their\ncustody, but shall at all times be under the administrative, operational and disciplinary control of the\ncommissioner of correction. The commissioner of mental health shall appoint to such center, in addition to the\npersonnel appointed by the commissioner of correction, adequate personnel for the care, treatment and\nrehabilitation of such persons committed to their care.\"\n[2] The district court also entered a supplemental consent decree that (1) prohibited defendants from using\nsolitary confinement for the purposes of discipline or punishment; and (2) imposed various procedural and\nsubstantive requirements for the use of sequestration. The defendants do not seek to modify the supplemental\nconsent decree.\n[3] The defendants also moved to reopen Williams v. Lesiak, a related litigation that involved a similar consent\ndecree. See Williams, 822 F.2d at 1224. The district court did not rule on the motion because counsel had not yet\nbeen appointed for the plaintiffs in Williams.\n[4] We asked the parties to brief the issue of our appellate jurisdiction in light of Carson v. AmericanBrands, Inc.,\n450 U.S. 79, 84, 101 S.Ct. 993, 996-97, 67 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981), which, in the context of an appeal from an\ninterlocutory order refusing to enter a consent decree, applied the general rule that an appeal under 28 U.S.C. §\n1292(a)(1) is available only if the order \"might have a `serious, perhaps irreparable consequence,'\" and can be\n\"`effectually challenged' only by immediate appeal\" (citations omitted). Assuming, without deciding, that these\nconditions apply where the district court refuses to modify a longstanding consent decree, we think the appeal is\nproperly before us. In particular, the district court's forecast of a stalemate pending appeal suggests that its order\ncan be effectually challenged only by immediate appeal. \nWe also note that Rufo itself was an interlocutory appeal from the denial of a Rule 60(b)(5) motion to modify a\nconsent decree. Neither the Supreme Court nor we, however, addressed the jurisdictional issues in that case.\n[5] In Rufo itself, the Supreme Court remanded for reconsideration under the standard it had just announced,\neven though \"the agreed-upon decree ... clearly was related to the conditions found to offend the Constitution.\" \n502 U.S. at 389, 112 S.Ct. at 763.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

The history of the litigation has been exhaustively covered: In re Pearson, 990 F.2d 653 (1st\nCir.1993) (Pearson III), Pearson v. Fair, 935 F.2d 401 (1st Cir.1991) (Pearson II), Langton v. Johnston, 928 F.2d\n1206 (1st Cir.1991),Williams v. Lesiak, 822 F.2d 1223 (1st Cir.1987), and Pearson v. Fair, 808 F.2d 163 (1st\nCir.1986) (per curiam) (Pearson I). We review the case history only to put this appeal in perspective.\nI.\nKing alleged that he had been deprived of due process and other federal constitutional rights by the defendants,\nspecifically by officials of the DOC, who allegedly placed him in solitary confinement without notice of the charges\nagainst him or a meaningful opportunity to be heard. DOC's actions allegedly interfered with King's treatment by\nthe Department of Mental Health (DMH), the agency vested with primary jurisdiction over the Treatment Center. \n[1]\nSee Mass.Gen.L. ch. 123A, § 2.  Thus, an element of this litigation, present from the very beginning, has been\nDOC's alleged usurpation of DMH's statutory authority over patients at the Treatment Center, during which\nusurpation the patients' constitutional rights were allegedly violated. Invoking both the Federal Constitution and\nstate law, King sought declaratory and injunctive relief from the DOC's sequestration practices.\nIn 1974, the district court held a hearing on King's allegations and entered a consent decree that provided, in\nrelevant part:\n1. The Treatment Center at MCI Bridgewater shall be treated as a facility of the Department of\nMental Health.\n2. Primary responsibility and authority for the Treatment Center shall be exercised by the\nDepartment of Mental Health.\n3. All personnel at the Treatment Center (clinical, custodial, administrative) shall be subject to the\ncontrol of the Commissioner of Mental Health with respect to the handling of patients.\n\n4. Custodial personnel, but not patients, shall be under the administrative, operational and\ndisciplinary control of the Commissioner of Correction.\n5. The Department of Mental Health shall exercise the responsibility and authority set forth in\nsubparagraph 2 above so that patients at the Treatment Center should have the least restrictive\nconditions necessary to achieve the purposes of commitment....\nThe first four paragraphs of the consent decree closely track the requirements of ch. 123A, § 2, the law in effect\n[2]\nwhen the consent decree was entered.\nOver time, the residents of the Treatment Center brought various suits to enforce or to modify the consent\n3 decrees. In 1988, the Commonwealth sought unsuccessfully to vacate *3 the decrees. \"The stream of litigation\noccasionally overflowed the district court,\" Pearson III, 990 F.2d at 655, and this court as well.\nWhile the residents were attempting to enforce the consent decrees, forces on the sidelines of the litigation were\nmobilizing to amend ch. 123A. Beginning in 1986, Massachusetts' executive branch filed a number of legislative\nbills that sought to transfer control of the Treatment Center from DMH to DOC. None of these bills were adopted\nuntil 1994, when the Massachusetts legislature enacted St.1993, ch. 489. Chapter 489 purports to transfer all\nauthority over the Treatment Center to the DOC, in direct contravention of the first five paragraphs of the consent\ndecree. Section 2 of ch. 489 provides that \"[t]he commissioner of correction shall maintain subject to the\njurisdiction of the department of correction a treatment program or branch thereof at a correctional institution for\nthe care, custody, treatment and rehabilitation of persons [ad]judicated as being sexually dangerous.\"\nThe defendants immediately moved under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(5) to modify the decree so that DOC might assume\nplenary authority over the Treatment Center, subject to all other substantive and procedural requirements of the\n[3]\ndecree.  Their sole argument was that the Massachusetts legislature's enactment of ch. 489 constituted \"a\nsignificant change in circumstances warrant[ing] revision of the decree.\" See Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County\nJail, 502 U.S. 367, 383, 112 S.Ct. 748, 759-60, 116 L.Ed.2d 867 (1992) (setting forth standard for modification of\nconsent decrees, and reversing the decision of this circuit).\nThe district court denied the motion from the bench: \"On the record that is now before me, and incorporated into\nthat record, everything that I have learned about the case and found in the case from the trials of the Bruder and\nthe Pearson cases [companion cases], I will conclude at this time that the defendants have not sustained their\nburden of showing a significant change in law or fact under Rufo.\" The court also made the following findings:\nI do find that the consent decrees sought to address federal constitutional violations articulated by \nKing and in Williams [a related case].\nA critical component of the remedy provided by the consent decrees was that the Department of\nMental Health was in control of the Treatment Center which was to provide, in part, a check on the\nDepartment of Correction[,] which compromised treatment.\nI conclude that the Department of Mental Health is an essential part of the decree, and on the\nrecord before me at this time, the Department of Correction has done nothing yet that I can see\nwhich warrants my placing confidence in its ability to deliver ... patient treatment.\nI conclude at this time that the Department of Correction's control of the Treatment Center\ncompromises the federal constitutional remedy which the consent decree sought to impose, and\nwould compromise the federal constitutional rights which the consent decrees sought to protect.\n....\nWill the Department of Correction provide th[e] same treatment [as DMH]? That's not shown. If\nthey were to provide that treatment, if there were to be a case-specific inquiry in what the\nDepartment of Correction was going to do and proposed to do, then perhaps I would be able to\nrule otherwise. But at this point, there is not that showing....\n\nThe district court invited the Commonwealth to propose ways to modify the decree that would preserve the\nfederal constitutional remedies, and yet accommodate the change in the underlying state law. It noted, however,\nthat \"we're not going to go anywhere\" before the defendants have tested the court's interpretation of Rufo on\n4 appeal.[4] Undeterred, *4 the defendants filed a renewed motion for modification and a motion to vacate the\nconsent decrees while this appeal was pending.\nII.\nWe review the district court's application of the Rufo standard, and the more general requirements for granting\nrelief from a final judgment under Rule 60(b)(5), for errors of law or abuse of discretion. See Alexis Lichine & Cie.\nv. Lichine Estate Selections, Ltd., 45 F.3d 582, 586-87 (1st Cir. 1995). Rufo held that \"a party seeking\nmodification of a consent decree bears the burden of establishing that a significant change\" in either factual\nconditions or in law \"warrants revision of the decree.\" 502 U.S. at 383-84, 112 S.Ct. at 760. If the moving party\nmeets this standard, \"the court should consider whether the proposed modification is suitably tailored to the\nchanged circumstance.\" Id. at 383, 112 S.Ct. at 760. This \"standard ... applies when a party seeks modification of\na term of a consent decree that arguably relates to the vindication of a constitutional right.\" Id. at 383 n. 7, 112\nS.Ct. at 760 n. 7.\nRufo instructed district courts to \"exercise flexibility in considering requests for modification of ... institutional\nreform consent decree[s]\" because such decrees \"`reach beyond the parties involved directly in the suit and\nimpact on the public's right to the sound and efficient operation of its institutions.'\" Id. at 381, 383, 112 S.Ct. at\n759, 759-60 (quoting Health v. De Courcy, 888 F.2d 1105, 1109 (6th Cir.1989)). We have echoed these concerns.\nSee, e.g., Pearson III, 990 F.2d at 658 (\"In institutional reform litigation, injunctions should not operate inviolate in\nperpetuity.\"); Mackin v. City of Boston, 969 F.2d 1273, 1275 (1st Cir.1992) (\"we believe that district courts should\nbe flexible in considering requests for relaxation of, or release from, decrees which were initially established to\nbring about needed institutional reforms\"), cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 113 S.Ct. 1043, 122 L.Ed.2d 352 (1993).\nNotwithstanding the application of this \"less stringent, more flexible standard,\" a modification \"must not create or\nperpetuate a constitutional violation.\" Rufo, 502 U.S. at 380, 391, 112 S.Ct. at 758, 763.\nIII.\nWe shall refer to the first five paragraphs of the 1974 consent decree as \"structural\" terms, inasmuch as they\nincorporate the administrative structure mandated by state law. These are the only terms the defendants seek to\nmodify. For the purposes of their motion, the defendants assume that the structural terms \"arguably relate[] to the\nvindication of a constitutional right.\" Id. at 383 n. 7, 112 S.Ct. at 760 n. 7. Of course, if the terms at issue were\ndirectly mandated by the Constitution, a change in state law without more would not warrant a modification.\nModifiable terms will typically fall somewhere along a spectrum: in general, terms that directly implement\nconstitutional requirements 00 e.g., a predeprivation hearing to satisfy procedural due process 00 will be more\n97 97\nclosely related to the vindication of a constitutional right than terms that lay the groundwork for other remedial\nmeasures.\nWe think that the structural terms in this case belong in the latter class. The Constitution itself is indifferent to\nwhether DOC or DMH administers the Treatment Center. If, however, as King alleged, DOC personnel violated\nhis constitutional rights in the process of usurping DMH's authority and interfering with his clinical treatment, then\n5 a decree keeping DOC within its statutory ambit *5 begins to make sense in the context of a constitutional\nremedy. Although we, unlike the district court, would have eschewed the words \"essential\" and \"critical,\" we think\nthe structural terms were clearly, not just arguably, related to the constitutional remedy provided by the decrees.\nThis is not to say that a change in the statutory scheme cannot be a significant change in law that warrants\n[5]\nmodification of the structural terms.  In the context of King, the structural terms may have been a means to a\nconstitutional end; but it was possible to include them in the decree only because Massachusetts law already\nstructured the Treatment Center in the same way. If existing state law had granted DOC exclusive jurisdiction\n\nover the Treatment Center, the parties could not have agreed to insert DMH into the administrative structure.\nThus, a change in the very law underlying the structural terms is likely to be \"significant\" under Rufo, and may\ntherefore require some modification of the structural terms.\nThis preliminary analysis is consistent with our own decisions before and after Rufo. In Rufo, the Supreme Court\noffered several examples of potentially significant changes in federal law. See id. at 388-90, 112 S.Ct. at 762-63\n(\"one or more of the obligations placed upon the parties has become impermissible under federal law\"; \"the\nstatutory or decisional law has changed to make legal what the decree was designed to prevent\"; \"a decision that\nclarifies the law\" has undermined an agreement based on \"a misunderstanding of the governing law\"). Although\nnone of the examples from Rufo is on point here, our decision in Williams, which predated Rufo, suggests the\nproper test for significance in this case. If a subsequent state statute appears to overlap or conflict with a federal\nconsent decree, \"and the conflict ... is less than clear, delicate questions of federalism must enter into our\ninquiry.\" See id.,822 F.2d at 1228 (citing Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362, 379, 96 S.Ct. 598, 608, 46 L.Ed.2d 561\n(1976) (federalism must be considered in determining scope of equitable relief)). The district court should conduct\na \"careful case-specific inquiry\" into both the decree and the statute \"to discover whether their objectives and\nprovisions necessarily conflict and to consider the importance of the areas of conflict to the overall goals of the\nlitigation.\" Id.\nWe think that the nuanced, case-specific approach of Williams is consistent with the strictures of Rufo and with\nthe equitable nature of relief from a decree under Rule 60(b)(5). See Rufo, 502 U.S. at 383, 112 S.Ct. at 760\n(noting that Rule 60(b)(5) permits relief from a court order when \"`it is no longer equitable that the judgment\nshould have prospective application'\"). See also Mackin, 969 F.2d at 1278 (\"the decision as to whether to modify\nor dissolve [a structural decree] is at bottom an exercise of equitable power\" that calls for a \"deferential standard\nof review\").\nChapter 489 reflects Massachusetts' legislative judgment that one agency rather than two can best perform the\nconflicting functions of the Treatment Center, i.e., maintain security as well as provide treatment. As the district\ncourt noted, no one regards dual administration of the Treatment Center as workable. But why give DOC the run\nof the place? The legislature apparently accepted the professional opinion that behavior modification or control,\nrather than traditional mental health treatment, is the most effective way to protect society from sexually\ndangerous persons and such persons from themselves. The correctness of this view is not before us; what\nmatters is whether the goals of ch. 489 necessarily conflict with the rights enforced by the federal consent\ndecree, and the importance of any such conflict to the overall goals of the litigation. Williams, 822 F.2d at 1228.\nThe extent and importance of the conflict can be exaggerated or trivialized, as the parties have tried to do. We\nthink that the conflict is real but not so fundamental that ch. 489 necessarily thwarts the overall goals of the King\n6 litigation. King's primary goal was to ensure that his treatment complied *6 with the Constitution. The structural\nterms of the decree may serve that goal by keeping DOC, allegedly the offending actor, out of DMH's province;\nbut as we have explained, those terms would have been inconceivable without the underlying state law. After all,\nplaintiffs cannot claim that DOC control per se violates the Constitution. With the amendment of ch. 123A, the\ngoverning state law no longer gives DMH any role to play. In light of these federalism concerns, we think there\nhas certainly been a \"significant change ... in law\" within the meaning of Rufo, and that the plaintiffs cannot\nenforce the structural terms of the decree in perpetuity. See Pearson III, 990 F.2d at 658.\nIn holding that the defendants had not shown a significant change in law, the district court apparently relied upon\nour decision in Coalition of Black Leadership v. Cianci, 570 F.2d 12 (1st Cir.1978). The consent decree in Cianci\nestablished a procedure whereby residents of Providence, Rhode Island, could file complaints against their police\nofficers for alleged civil rights violations. The Rhode Island legislature subsequently enacted a \"Law Enforcement\nOfficers' Bill of Rights\" which conflicted in part with the decree. There was an \"obvious subject matter overlap\nbetween the decree and the legislation,\" which served \"dual and partially inconsistent purposes.\" Id. at 14. The\nCity of Providence moved to vacate the decree, and the district court denied the motion. We affirmed, noting that\nthe court had \"ordered both parties to work out modifications in the decree so that the protection of policemen's\nrights mandated by state law and the right of plaintiffs to be free from `racially discriminatory police conduct' could\n[,] to the extent possible, both be achieved.\" Id. at 13 (emphasis added). Moreover, we emphasized the district\ncourt's statement that\n\nthe Court is inclined to look with deference upon the alternate procedural means embodied in the\n1976 Act.... If the Rhode Island legislature has determined that the rights of police officers are in\nneed of protection and that this protection can best be achieved by adoption of certain procedural\nprotections, the Court is not prepared to question this judgment or to stand in the way of its\nimplementation in the absence of any showing that the 1976 Act will hamper the effective\npresentation of civilian complaints which the consent decree has apparently accomplished.\nId. at 14 n. 1. We approved the district court's flexible approach for resolving the conflict between the decree and\nthe Act, even though the decree in Cianci, unlike that in King, did not incorporate an administrative structure\nbased on superseded state law. Cf. Williams, 822 F.2d at 1234 n. 5 (on remand, \"[a]s in Cianci ... the court should\nbe flexible in framing a response to the motion to avoid any conflict with the state statute when unnecessary for\nthe goals underlying this litigation\"). If anything, this case presents the stronger argument for modification, given\nthe source of the structural terms, their relationship to the constitutional remedy, and the legislature's autonomy to\nrestructure the governmental institutions of the Commonwealth.\nIV.\nHaving found a significant change in law, we now \"focus ... on whether the proposed modification is tailored to\nresolve the problems created by the change in circumstances.\" Rufo, 502 U.S. at 391, 112 S.Ct. at 763. \"Of\ncourse, a modification must not create or perpetuate a constitutional violation.\" Id. at 391, 112 S.Ct. at 763.\nThe district court evidently feared that the proposed modification would produce a de facto increase in\nconstitutional violations at the Treatment Center, even if there is nothing unconstitutional de jure about DOC's\nassuming plenary authority. Based on its assessment of the history of this litigation, the court concluded \"at this\ntime\" that DOC's control of the Treatment Center would compromise the federal constitutional remedies imposed\nby the consent decree, and the federal constitutional rights that the decree sought to protect. Critically, the\ndefendants had not shown \"what the Department of Correction ... proposed to do\" to \"provide th[e] same\ntreatment\" as DMH under the remainder of the decree. Had the defendants made such a showing, \"then perhaps\n[the district court] would be able to rule otherwise.\"\n7 *7 This leaves us unsure of the district court's reason(s) for denying the proposed modification. Earlier in the\nhearing, the court had ruled that ch. 489 is not a significant change in law. Perhaps it was now saying that ch.\n489 might be a significant change in law that warrants modification of the consent decree, but the defendants had\nnot yet demonstrated as a practical matter that the modification would be implemented without producing or\nexacerbating constitutional violations at the Treatment Center. In fact, the defendants submitted no testimonial or\ndocumentary evidence of DOC's transfer plans; nor did they request an evidentiary hearing. On the sparse\nrecord before the district court, in light of the court's inconsistent observations, we cannot say whether the court\nproperly denied modification for lack of suitable tailoring. See Rufo, 502 U.S. at 383, 112 S.Ct. at 759-60. The\nprudent course is to remand for a new hearing.\nOn remand, the district court may inquire into DOC's transfer plans. We note, however, that \"once a court has\ndetermined that a modification is warranted, ... principles of federalism and simple common sense require the\ncourt to give significant weight to the views of the local government officials who must implement any\nmodification.\" Id. at 392 n. 14, 112 S.Ct. at 764 n. 14. \"[T]he public interest and considerations based on the\nallocation of powers within our federal system ... require that the district court defer to local government\nadministrators, who have the `primary responsibility for elucidating, assessing, and solving' the problems of\ninstitutional reform, to resolve the intricacies of implementing a decree modification.\" Id. at 392, 112 S.Ct. at 764\n(quoting Brown v. Board of Educ., 349 U.S. 294, 299, 75 S.Ct. 753, 756, 99 L.Ed. 1083 (1955)) (other citations\nand quotation marks omitted). The district court should rely primarily on its jurisdictional oversight to ensure\nDOC's compliance with the decrees.\nRemanded.\n\n[1] Section 2 of ch. 123A (as amended through St.1959, ch. 615) provided in pertinent part: \"The commissioner of\nmental health shall establish and maintain, subject to the jurisdiction of the department of mental health, a\ntreatment center ... at a correctional institution approved by the commissioner of correction, for the care, custody,\ntreatment and rehabilitation of [sexually dangerous] persons.... The commissioner of correction shall appoint such\ncustodial personnel as may be required for such center. Such custodial personnel shall be subject to the control\nof the commissioner of mental health with respect to the care, treatment and rehabilitation of persons in their\ncustody, but shall at all times be under the administrative, operational and disciplinary control of the\ncommissioner of correction. The commissioner of mental health shall appoint to such center, in addition to the\npersonnel appointed by the commissioner of correction, adequate personnel for the care, treatment and\nrehabilitation of such persons committed to their care.\"\n[2] The district court also entered a supplemental consent decree that (1) prohibited defendants from using\nsolitary confinement for the purposes of discipline or punishment; and (2) imposed various procedural and\nsubstantive requirements for the use of sequestration. The defendants do not seek to modify the supplemental\nconsent decree.\n[3] The defendants also moved to reopen Williams v. Lesiak, a related litigation that involved a similar consent\ndecree. See Williams, 822 F.2d at 1224. The district court did not rule on the motion because counsel had not yet\nbeen appointed for the plaintiffs in Williams.\n[4] We asked the parties to brief the issue of our appellate jurisdiction in light of Carson v. AmericanBrands, Inc.,\n450 U.S. 79, 84, 101 S.Ct. 993, 996-97, 67 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981), which, in the context of an appeal from an\ninterlocutory order refusing to enter a consent decree, applied the general rule that an appeal under 28 U.S.C. §\n1292(a)(1) is available only if the order \"might have a `serious, perhaps irreparable consequence,'\" and can be\n\"`effectually challenged' only by immediate appeal\" (citations omitted). Assuming, without deciding, that these\nconditions apply where the district court refuses to modify a longstanding consent decree, we think the appeal is\nproperly before us. In particular, the district court's forecast of a stalemate pending appeal suggests that its order\ncan be effectually challenged only by immediate appeal. \nWe also note that Rufo itself was an interlocutory appeal from the denial of a Rule 60(b)(5) motion to modify a\nconsent decree. Neither the Supreme Court nor we, however, addressed the jurisdictional issues in that case.\n[5] In Rufo itself, the Supreme Court remanded for reconsideration under the standard it had just announced,\neven though \"the agreed-upon decree ... clearly was related to the conditions found to offend the Constitution.\" \n502 U.S. at 389, 112 S.Ct. at 763.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

They enter their final stage on the defendants' renewed motion to vacate or terminate long-\nstanding consent decrees which were put in place approximately twenty-five years ago to govern operations at\nthe facility. The road to this point has been long and uneven. The twenty-seven years of litigation along the route\nhas been exhaustively described in prior orders of this Court and the Court of Appeals, but a brief overall review\n[1]\nmay be a helpful backdrop to this memorandum.\n\nThe Massachusetts Sexually Dangerous Person Law was passed in 1947, Statute 1947, c. 683, and is found at\nMass.Gen. Laws ch. 123A § 1 et seq. It was premised on the assumption that sex offending was caused by\nsevere mental illness which could be cured if the offender was given a day to life commitment at a psychiatric\n[2]\ninstitution to participate in an intensive treatment regimen.  The statute was amended in 1954 to provide for the\nestablishment of a such a facility. The Treatment Center subsequently opened in 1957 to serve this population.\nIn 1972, residents at the Treatment Center filed complaints alleging that the conditions of confinement and the\ninadequacy of treatment programs, work opportunities, and avocational and educational activities, violated the\n119 fifth, eighth, and fourteenth amendments to the U.S. Constitution.[3] In 1974, the district court entered *119 two\nconsent decrees in King (the \"Original\" decree, and one week later, the \"Supplemental\" decree) and one consent\ndecree in Williams. (It also issued a partial consent decree in 1975 which elaborated on one provision of the \nWilliams decree.) The consent decrees have raised a variety of issues and have led to a stream of litigation over\nthe course of their twenty-five year history.\nIn order to fully evaluate the impact of this litigation, it is important to understand the basis on which these cases\nwere brought and the issues that confronted Judge Wyzanski at the time these decrees were entered. While the\nlater years of litigation tended to focus on specific issues raised in King and Williams, such as inadequacy of\ntreatment and unfair denial of privileges, the full record before Judge Wyzanski went far beyond the claims in\nthose cases. At the time the consent decrees were entered, conditions at the Treatment Center were deplorable.\n[4]\n Residents lived in cramped, poorly furnished cells which were built in 1895. Their water supply came from the\nhighly polluted and inadequately treated Taunton River. At various times in 1972, 1973, and 1974, the bacterial\nlevel of the river water after chlorination failed to meet safe drinking water standards. Even the portable water\nsupply from wells was exposed to danger of pollution from a nearby dump. Moreover, it was continually\ninterrupted due to the Center's antiquated plumbing system which dated back to 1888. The Center's sewerage\nsystem was similarly outmoded and sub-standard, having had no work done on it since 1934. The cells were\nwithout toilets or sinks. Instead, residents were forced to keep small chamber pots in their cells in which to\ndefecate and urinate. Every morning residents lined up and carried their human waste to empty into a service\nsink at the end of their floor. The service sink was located within a few feet of a large cast iron trough used for\nwashing. Washing and shaving took place in open view of urinating and defecating activities. The shower facility\nwas located outside the housing unit, across an outdoor courtyard. Thus, residents seeking to shower were\nforced to walk outside, even during the cold winter months. Heating and ventilation equipment was obsolete, and\nsome cells were without heat for periods of several days. There was only one licensed doctor at the Treatment\nCenter and no nurses. Medication was handed out by correctional officers. There was no library, no educational\nprograms, no gymnasium, no outdoor recreation area, and no work-release or community access program.\nVocational facilities were very limited. Nor was there any tier-system of security. Instead, all residents were\nhoused under maximum security conditions. Movement was restricted as correctional officers on patrol did not\ncarry cell keys. All keys were kept in one location and each cell had to be opened individually. These were the\nconditions that existed at the time of the consent decrees. They are representative of the circumstances that the\nconsent decrees aimed to correct.\nThe first five provisions of the Original King and Williams consent decrees contained parallel language which\nprovided that the Treatment Center would be treated as a Department of Mental Health (\"DMH\") facility. DMH\n120 was granted primary *120 authority over residents and treatment, while the Department of Corrections (\"DOC\")\n[5]\nwas given responsibility for custodial personnel.  Residents were entitled to \"the least restrictive conditions\nnecessary to achieve the purpose of commitment.\" Both DMH and DOC would \"take steps jointly\" to \"improve\nphysical conditions,\" \"implement a meaningful work program,\" and have \"a system of differing security for\ndifferent categories of patients ... to permit less restrictive conditions for those patients not requiring maximum\nsecurity.\" The Supplemental Decree addressed King's specific complaint over his placement in the segregation\nunit. It prohibited the use of solitary confinement \"for the purpose of discipline or punishment\" and required that\nany sequestering conform with the \"minimum standards of due process\" and \"human decency.\" The Williams\nDecree further ordered the defendants to submit a plan to offer therapeutic, educational, vocational, and\navocational programs at the Treatment Center and a provision for a day or other short-term release to allow\nresidents to participate in approved programs outside of the facility.\n\nOver the ensuing years, the consent decrees led to gradual and steady improvements in the general\ncircumstances of confinement and the provision of treatment, as well as to the physical conditions of the facility.\nAs the First Circuit remarked, the course of this litigation \"has accomplished much in a troubled and complex field\nof custody and treatment of institutionalized sexually dangerous persons. During this period, changes have\noccurred in conditions of confinement and treatment, in the problems confronted, and in the institutional setting.\" \nKing v. Greenblatt, 149 F.3d at 12 (1st Cir.1998). Residents are now housed in a modern facility and live under\nconditions which are vastly different from those that residents such as King and Williams were subject to in 1972.\n[6]\n There are a wide-range of therapeutic, educational, vocational and avocational activities available to\nresidents, as compared to what was in place when the complaints were brought. Moreover, there are work\nopportunities available to residents at the Center and a program in place which allows residents to gradually re-\nenter the community outside the facility.\nWhile it is generally acknowledged that physical conditions at the Treatment Center improved dramatically since\n1972, along with the kinds of treatment, programming and work opportunities, the facility was never free from the\ntension that existed as a result of its shared control by DMH and DOC. That tension contributed to years of\nlitigation centered around the inevitable conflicts that arose from the dual management of a hybrid facility whose\npurpose was to provide effective treatment, for which DMH was responsible, in a secure setting, for which DOC\nwas responsible. \"`The stream of litigation occasionally overflowed the district court' Pearson III, 990 F.2d at 655,\nand this court as well.\" King v. Greenblatt, 52 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1995).\n[7]\nFollowing the Pearson and Langton trials,  I heralded my concern that the court would face many more years of\n121 litigation *121 unless some effort was made to address the conflicts and ambiguities raised by the dual agency\ncontrol of this unique institution. In addition to the discreet claims made in those and other cases, there was\nongoing discussion surrounding proposed legislation to abolish the civil commitment statute. In 1988, the\nLegislature authorized a review of ch. 123A and the Treatment Center as part of a broad-based study of the\nCommonwealth's forensic mental health system. The reviewing panel concluded that the mental health approach\nto sex offender treatment was no longer effective because sexual violence is primarily a form of anti-social\nbehavior which can be controlled, but not \"cured.\" It advocated that the mental health approach be abandoned for\na treatment program based more upon cognitive behavioral models. It recommended that the civil commitment\n[8]\nstatute be abolished.  It also recommended that DOC develop a program for voluntary sex offender treatment in\nthe prisons. In 1990, civil commitments were abolished. Shortly thereafter, discussion began about vesting\ncontrol of the Treatment Center solely in DOC. To consider the ramifications of the existing and pending\nlegislation relating to sexually dangerous persons, and acting on my own initiative, I appointed a Special Master\non September 2, 1992, with very specific directions. That order survived a petition for mandamus. See In Re\nPearson, 990 F.2d 653 (1st Cir.1993).\nAt this time there was legislation pending which greatly altered the structure and operation of the Treatment\nCenter by transferring jurisdiction of the Treatment Center from the dual control of DMH and DOC to the sole\ncontrol of DOC and adding \"custody\" to the statutory goals of \"care, treatment, and rehabilitation\" of civilly-\ncommitted sexually dangerous persons. This legislation was eventually enacted as 1993 Mass.Acts. ch. 489,\nwhich amended Mass.Gen.Laws ch. 123A. The amended statute was a significant development for several\nreasons. First, it shifted complete control of the facility to DOC. Second, the consent decrees provided that\nresidents were entitled to the \"least restrictive means necessary to achieve the purposes of commitment.\" Thus,\nwith the enactment of ch. 489 came a recognition that one of the purposes of civil-commitment was custody. It\nalso brought with it defendants' first motion to vacate, or in the alternative, to modify the consent decrees to\nconform them to the statutory change.\nThe ensuing period of time was marked by several fits and starts regarding modifications of the consent decrees.\n[9]\n On March 11, 1994, I appointed counsel for a class of residents naming themselves the Class of 48 + 1 who\n[10]\nalleged additional violations at the facility.  On May 27, 1994, in light of the new legislation and the transfer of\n[11]\ncontrol to DOC, I reopened the Williams case and consolidated it with King.  At the same time, I denied the\nmotion to modify, finding that DOC had not presented the Court with any information demonstrating its ability to\n122 provide treatment in compliance with the consent decrees. I invited DOC to provide specific details in *122 the\n\nform of a plan of how it proposed to operate the facility. The transfer of control of the Treatment Center to DOC\nmarked a critical juncture in the history of the facility. Given the cessation of civil commitments, the legislative\namendments, and changes in the treatment philosophy during this period, there was significant concern about\nhow DOC would ensure treatment for a slowly diminishing resident population. Against this backdrop, DOC\ndeveloped a plan for the management and administration of the Treatment Center (\"Plan\") in an effort to\ndemonstrate how it would fulfill its new responsibilities. DOC filed this Plan with the Court for approval on\nSeptember 26, 1994. On July 31, 1995, I stayed the implementation of central components of the Plan and\ndirected the parties to attempt to reach a consensus on these issues.\nThis period was also marked by the construction of a 300-bed modular unit on the grounds of the Treatment\nCenter to house 300 convicted sex offenders who were participating in the DOC's sex offender treatment\nprogram. Clearly, this event held promise for disruption and, indeed, remains at this time, the greatest challenge\nto DOC's management of the Center. The influx of DOC inmates required the integration of the Treatment Center\nwith the prison program for sex offenders. DOC submitted a plan detailing how it would accommodate the influx\nof inmates to the facility while maintaining its obligations under the statute to keep civilly-committed residents\nseparate and apart. See \"Massachusetts Treatment Center Management Plan To Accommodate 300 New State\nPrison Inmates, August 2, 1996.\" Persuaded that the Treatment Center's program would remain the same, that is,\nremedial, and that DOC's plan provided priority to residents over inmates whenever possible and feasible, I\ndenied the motion to enjoin the construction of the units. King v. Greenblatt, No. 72-788, (D.Mass. September 30,\n[12]\n1996).  Finally, during this period of an emerging Plan and a changing legislative and political landscape, the\nparties were repeatedly urged, with the assistance of the Special Master, to confer and reach agreement on the\nrules and regulations which would henceforth govern the Treatment Center. Unfortunately, those efforts were\nunavailing.\nEventually, the legislative enactments and changes in the approach to the treatment of sexually dangerous\npersons necessitated modifications to the decrees. On October 31, 1996, after a careful scrutiny of the Plan, I\ngranted the Commonwealth's motion to modify the decrees. King v. Greenblatt, No. 72-788, slip op. (D.Mass.\nOctober 31, 1996). The one hundred and thirty-six page Plan set forth in great detail the policies and procedures\nDOC would follow in operating the Center. I found that the Plan was \"a permissible and detailed proposal\" and\nthat the goals of treatment and security and protection of residents' rights were met. Id. at 55. However, I directed\nDOC to submit an updated amended plan that addressed certain concerns the parties had raised. An Amended\nPlan was filed on November 29, 1996. It is that Plan, together with the policies and procedures implemented\nunder that Plan, which are the governing documents for the Treatment Center.\nWhile I allowed the Commonwealth's motion to modify, I denied the Commonwealth's contemporaneous motion\nto vacate the consent decrees without prejudice to renew in one year. During this time, I would evaluate and\nmonitor DOC's implementation of the Plan because what remained to be seen following modification was DOC's\nwillingness and commitment to accomplish the stated goals. In order to provide DOC with the opportunity to\ndemonstrate its commitment to providing effective treatment in a secure setting, I required the Commonwealth to\n123 file monthly *123 reports, providing statistics on population, treatment programs, attendance, transfers,\ncommunity access and other pertinent information. I received 15 monthly reports. The plaintiffs filed an initial\nresponse which generally assailed the reports as unverifiable, predictably self-serving and unreliable as\nevidence, since no discovery had been allowed. Some later responses included affidavits and submissions\n[13]\ncontradicting the information contained in the monthly reports.  During this time, I continued to receive letters\nfrom residents voicing their observations, complaints and concerns about DOC's management of the Treatment\n[14]\nCenter. A great many of their comments centered on the presence of the 360 DOC inmates.  In addition, I\nmade several visits to the Treatment Center with counsel to meet with the Superintendent and JRI and DOC staff\nmembers. I scheduled one visit to the Center for the specific purpose of hearing the views of the residents who\nwere identified by counsel as witnesses. This was all done in an effort to review DOC's willingness and ability to\nsatisfy its statutory obligations and its responsibilities under the consent decrees. The order was appealed.\nOn July 7, 1998, the Court of Appeals affirmed my order granting the Commonwealth's motion to modify the\ndecrees. King v. Greenblatt, 149 F.3d 9 (1st Cir. 1998). I believe that opinion provides valuable guidance,\n\nespecially with respect to specific areas of extensive comment and its assessment of due process concerns in\nthe disciplinary procedure.\nTurning to the modified decrees, in the words of Judge Coffin, \"the substantive essence\" of the Original King and \nWilliams decrees is the provision that \"patients at the Treatment Center should have the least restrictive\nconditions necessary to achieve the purposes of commitment.\" King, 149 F.3d at 15. The remaining provisions\nrequire the following: (1) DOC should \"improve the physical plant\" with particular reference to toilet facilities,\nheating systems, and space; (2) DOC should have a \"system of differing security for different categories\" of\nresidents; and (3) DOC should \"implement a meaningful work program and increase avocational activities.\" For\nthe first time in the history of this litigation, the decrees were modified to permit DOC to use sequestration for the\npurpose of discipline or punishment. This was done by striking the statement from the Supplemental Decree\nwhich said that disciplinary and punitive procedures had \"no place in the care and treatment of civilly committed\npatients\" and replacing it with a prohibition against the use of sequestration as punishment for the acts underlying\na resident's civil commitment. The Supplemental Decree, as modified, (1) prohibits DOC from using solitary\nconfinement \"for the purpose of punishing residents for the acts underlying their commitment,\" and (2) requires\nthat any sequestering or segregation of residents conform to \"minimum standards of procedural due process\"\nand \"human decency.\"\nFollowing that opinion, the Commonwealth filed the renewed motion to vacate or terminate the consent decrees\nwhich is now before me. The plaintiffs and intervenor plaintiffs filed their opposition, a joint status report on\nconditions at the Center, a motion for corrective action and requests for discovery.\nSince November 29, 1996, the date on which the amended Plan was filed with this court, the question has been\n124 whether DOC has administered the Plan in harmony with the essence of the modified consent *124 decrees, that\nis, whether DOC has insured that patients are subject to the least restrictive conditions necessary to achieve the\npurposes of commitment. The defendants contend that the original conditions underlying the consent decrees no\nlonger exist and that they have administered the Plan in accordance with the meaning of the consent decrees.\nThey further suggest that DOC's record in its administration of the Treatment Center demonstrates that there is\nlittle or no likelihood that the original constitutional violations will return once the decree is lifted. Inmates of\nSuffolk County Jail v. Rufo, 12 F.3d 286, 292, (1st Cir.1993), citing Board of Educ. v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 247,\n[15]\n111 S.Ct. 630, 112 L.Ed.2d 715 (1991).  The plaintiffs' opposition alleges that DOC has failed to show that the\nunderlying constitutional wrongs have been remedied, has failed to comply with the decrees in good faith for a\nreasonable period of time, and has failed to demonstrate a willingness and commitment to provide treatment in a\nsecure setting. Plaintiffs sought discovery to test defendants' claims. On January 14, 1999, I granted plaintiffs'\n[16]\nrequest for discovery.  Following discovery, the matter was set for evidentiary hearing on March 16, 1999. At\nthe hearing, I took the testimony of seventeen witnesses, including residents, the plaintiffs' expert, and JRI and\nDOC officials. One day of hearing took place at the Treatment Center and ten residents testified. The testimony\nwas supplemented by affidavits from residents and counter-affidavits from the Commonwealth. Sixty-three\nexhibits were introduced. The evidence adduced at the hearing, plus the full record of these cases since 1972,\ncomprise the basis of my conclusions.\nII\nAs Judge Selya said, speaking for the First Circuit in an earlier case in this litigation, when \"an injunction entered\npursuant to a consent decree has ongoing effects, the issuing court retains authority to enforce it ... [and] to\nmodify or interpret such decrees in light of changed circumstances.\" In Re Pearson, 990 F.2d 653, 657 (1st\nCir.1993), citing United States v. Swift & Co., 286 U.S. 106, 114-15, 52 S.Ct. 460, 462-63, 76 L.Ed. 999 (1932).\nFor nearly twenty-five years, six judges of this court have been called upon to interpret, enforce, and recently, to\nmodify these decrees.\nI repeat the standard to be applied in this case. It is derived from the standard used by courts when deciding\nwhether to end injunctive orders in school desegregation cases. See Board of Educ. v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 111\nS.Ct. 630, 112 L.Ed.2d 715 (1991), and more recently, Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 112 S.Ct. 1430, 118\nL.Ed.2d 108 (1992). The First Circuit has relied on this standard in cases involving consent decrees which pertain\n\nto conditions at correctional facilities, Inmates of Suffolk County v. Rufo, 12 F.3d 286 (1st Cir.1993),In Re\nPearson, 990 F.2d 653 (1st Cir.1993); and to the treatment of mentally ill persons, Consumer Advisory Bd. v.\nGlover, 989 F.2d 65 (1st Cir.1993).\nUnder Dowell, I must determine that the underlying constitutional wrong has been remedied and that the\nauthorities have complied with the decrees in good faith for a reasonable period of time since they were entered. \n125 Dowell, 498 U.S. at 247, 249-50, 111 S.Ct. 630. In Rufo, the *125 First Circuit said that the district court must be\nsatisfied that there is little or no likelihood that the original constitutional violations will return when the decree is\nlifted. Rufo, 12 F.3d at 292, citing Dowell, 498 U.S. at 247, 111 S.Ct. 630. This Circuit also said that the district\ncourt may consider the defendants' past record of compliance; present attitudes towards the reforms mandated\nby the decrees; and the way in which demographic, economic, and political forces may be expected to influence\nlocal authorities and the institution once the shelter of the decrees has been lost. Id.\nAt first reading, the standards appear to require a straightforward application of the law to the factual record. But,\nas usual in the context of the unique and changing environment of the Treatment Center, the application is not so\nstraight-forward. If the issue is whether the consent decrees are necessary to correct the conditions that existed\nat the Treatment Center at the time the decrees were entered, and continue to be necessary to maintain the\nimproved conditions so that the constitutional rights asserted in King and Williams are not violated, I conclude\nthat the evidence clearly shows that the consent decrees have served the purpose of correcting those conditions\nand are no longer necessary to maintain those improvements.\nOn the other hand, if the issue is whether the consent decrees continue to be necessary because of concerns\nthat once the shelter of the decrees has been lost, \"the original constitutional violations will promptly be\nrepeated,\" then the test becomes one of the sincerity, willingness and commitment of DOC to the Treatment\nCenter's mission. The resolution of this issue requires an examination of DOC's past record, its attitude toward\ntreatment and behavior management, and the influence of outside forces. With these issues in mind, I turn to the\nrecord.\nIII.\nFirst, to understand the challenges that face DOC in the future, we consider a decreasing population in view of\nthe physical layout of the Treatment Center. There are currently 177 civilly-committed residents at the facility.\nEleven of these individuals are referred to as \"straight civil\", that is they are residents who never received a\ncriminal sentence or who were civilly-committed in lieu of receiving a criminal sentence. Eighty-nine individuals\nare residents who have completed their criminal sentence but remain civilly-committed. The remaining seventy-\nseven residents are still serving a criminal sentence.\nThe Treatment Center is comprised of 4 units, A, B, C, and D. Each unit contains 54 cells, 30 in one section and\n24 in the other. The cells front on a common area. The maximum capacity of the Treatment Center, single-\n[17]\nbunked then, is 216.  Section D-2 is occupied by the 60 Phase IV DOC inmates, who are double-bunked in 30\ncells. The remaining 186 cells are available for the residents or civils who are not at the Transition House or in the\nMinimum Privilege Unit. At this writing, there are approximately 14 empty cells at the Center. More empty cells\nare anticipated as Section 9 trials are scheduled in the next four months, creating the possibility that more\nresidents may be released from the Center.\nThis decline in resident population was foreseen by the Massachusetts Legislature. Chapter 150, of St.1990,\nSection 104 provides that the Commissioner of Correction may utilize available space at the Treatment Center to\naddress overcrowding at other facilities, provided that the Treatment Center residents remain separate and apart\n126 from DOC inmates.[18] The *126 prospect of housing additional DOC inmates at the Treatment Center, invites\nthe further question of whether the consent decrees are a necessary restraint; a cautionary reminder to DOC that\nits operation of the Treatment Center, particularly with regard to the separation of the civils, will never be immune\nfrom scrutiny. At this point, the record shows that DOC has developed a system of priorities and internal controls\nthat allows it to integrate treatment services for Treatment Center residents and DOC inmates and provide the\nbest current treatment methodology to both populations.\n\nA critical part of the Plan provides for the continuation of the same clinical treatment program which was\npreviously provided under DMH. In 1992, long before DOC assumed control, DMH contracted with the Justice\nResource Institute (\"JRI\") to administer the treatment program at the Center. JRI developed a new treatment\nprogram for the Center which replaced the mental health model with one based upon expanded cognitive\n[19]\nbehavioral methodologies.  The initial contract expired in October 1997, at which point DOC renewed the\ncontract for another five years.\nDr. Barbara Schwartz is the Clinical Director of JRI. She has specialized in sex offender treatment and has\nworked to develop sex offender treatment programs around the country. She has directed the program at the\nTreatment Center since JRI received the contract in 1992. Thus, she has had experience providing sex offender\ntreatment under both DMH and DOC regimes. As Clinical Director, Dr. Schwartz has overall responsibility for the\ntherapy provided to civilly-committed residents at the Center, as well as to inmates in various DOC facilities\nthroughout the Commonwealth which offer sex offender treatment. Her responsibilities at the Center include\nmeeting weekly with JRI and DOC management staff and representatives of the Treatment Advisory Board on\ntreatment issues, and being available to listen to residents' concerns at Tuesday and Thursday \"Happy Hour\"\n[20]\nsessions.  Spending approximately 28 hours a week at the Center, she has an opportunity to observe the\npolicies and practices of Treatment Center staff as well as the participation and progress of residents in\ntreatment. Having worked at the Treatment Center from when it was a DMH facility through to its present day\nexistence as a DOC-operated facility, Dr. Schwartz has been well-situated to observe the effect that the changes\nin legislation and circumstances have had on the provision of treatment in a secure setting.\nDr. Schwartz' testimony is largely corroborated by her associates at JRI, Dr. John Cusack, JRI Director of\nPrograms, and Mr. Gregory Canfield, Director of Justice Programs. Both individuals come with extensive\nexperience and, I believe, an understanding of their responsibilities in this unique institution. Dr. Cusack spends\nthirty-five to forty-two hours a week at the Treatment Center meeting with staff members and residents and\nattending Happy Hour one or two times per month. Mr. Canfield has worked at the Treatment Center in programs\n127 for twelve years. As Director of the Justice Program, *127 Canfield's primary responsibility is supervising JRI's\ncontract with DOC and attending Treatment Center management meetings. He has witnessed and participated in\nthe operation of the Treatment Center from its incarnation as a DMH facility through its transition to a solely DOC-\nrun institution. All three JRI personnel testified at the hearing about a variety of issues having to do with the\noperation of the Treatment Center and the provision of treatment to residents.\nTurning to the testimony of DOC officials, it covered the areas of psychological services and the community\n[21]\naccess committee, classification, and programs and the overall responsibility of the Superintendent.  It could\nfairly be described as predictably positive, but there is ample objective evidence to support their testimony. In\naddition to the testimony of JRI officials, DOC's internal inspections of the Treatment Center's compliance with\nestablished policies and procedures has been acceptable. Sanitary inspections by the Department of Public\nHealth show no deficiencies. Nationally, the Center has been identified as a \"monitoring site\" by the Center for\n[22]\nSex Offender Management and it has received the accreditation of the American Correctional Association.\nOne of the most prominent subjects of discussion by both plaintiffs and defendants in these cases surrounds the\nimposition of discipline at the Center. When Dr. Schwartz began work at the Center, she was surprised to learn\nthat there were no written rules regarding discipline and that discipline was handled informally with sanctions\ndetermined on an ad hoc basis by DMH staff. According to Dr. Schwartz, a disciplinary system, which utilizes\nsequestration as a form of punishment, is a necessary and integral part of any treatment program. She, therefore,\nsupported the implementation of a clear set of rules with consequences and expectations of sanctions as a\nmeans of helping residents better adjust to their community upon release. She then drafted a disciplinary policy\nwhich was based upon a number of prison policies and included a list of defined offenses and corresponding\n[23]\nsanctions. DOC eventually adopted this policy.\nAccording to the policy, there is a code of offenses divided into four categories of severity with corresponding\nsanctions, which extend from an unwritten warning up to a thirty-day placement in the MPU. A staff member who\nobserves a resident committing an offense completes an Observation of Behavior Report (OBR). The OBR is\n\nthen reviewed at the resident's hearing before the Behavior Review Committee (BRC). The BRC is a three-\nmember board consisting of one security staff member, one clinician, and one JRI staff member, who are all\n128 appointed by the *128 Superintendent. The BRC's responsibility is to review alleged offenses and determine any\nsanctions. In addition, the Superintendent is authorized to impose sequestration while a resident is awaiting a\nhearing and while investigation of an offense is pending where the resident has threatened, attempted, or inflicted\nserious harm to others. At the hearing, residents are allowed to present evidence and call and cross-examine\nwitnesses.\nSimilarly, Mr. Canfield testified that the disciplinary policies were appropriate from a treatment and programming\nperspective. He specifically addressed the privilege system in place at the Center. This system consists of three\nlevels of privilege, minimum, moderate, and maximum. Those residents assigned minimum status are allowed a\nmicrowave; those with moderate status are permitted extra movies, room visits within a resident's own unit, and\napproved arts and crafts in their rooms; maximum status residents are allowed all of those privileges in addition\nto periodic special meals in the dining room. There are ongoing discussions about what will be allowed under the\nthree levels. Privilege criteria and status are reviewed by the Administrative Team at the Bi-Annual Review of\nTreatment (BART). Canfield acknowledged differences between what existed when DMH was in control and what\nexists now under DOC's system. For example, under DMH's regime, residents were allowed to keep more\nproperty in their rooms. However, he says, an effort is made to ensure that residents have equal access to the\nhighest level they are capable of achieving as determined by their Unit Team.\nI have already found that the disciplinary policy contained in the Plan \"gives adequate and fair warning of\npunishable offenses and their corresponding sanctions, and provides for notice and a hearing, where the resident\nhas an opportunity to be heard.\" King v. Greenblatt, No. 72-788 slip op. at 17-18 (D.Mass. December 29, 1997)\nSimilarly, the First Circuit has already reviewed the policy and determined that \"the disciplinary system is\nresponsive to both the `treatment' need of residents to learn accountability for their actions and the administrative\nand security concerns of the institution.\" King, 149 F.3d at 18. Moreover, the Court of Appeals found no\nconstitutional defects in the disciplinary procedures set forth in the Plan. According to Dr. Schwartz, the new\ndisciplinary plan continues to be positive and she is satisfied with the current policy as it relates to treatment. She\nnotes the reaction of many residents who say it is much fairer to have a clearly established set of rules to\nunderstand and to follow.\nIn discussing the relationship between discipline and therapy, a significant amount of testimony focused on the\n[24]\nimpact of the Minimum Privilege Unit (\"MPU\") on the lives of residents at the Center.  While in MPU, a resident\ncannot participate in primary group therapy or attend psycho-educational classes, specialty groups, or\navocational/educational classes. However, therapists are available to provide residents in MPU with an\n[25]\nopportunity for individual consultation.  Residents are also entitled to telephone access, the right to receive\nvisitors, as well as access to exercise, library materials and showers. According to Dr. Schwartz, DOC has made\nchanges to MPU procedures which have been positive from a treatment perspective. For instance, DOC has\nchanged the policy to ensure that residents who are sent to MPU are relieved of the long wait of having to go\n129 before the Treatment Directors Board (\"TDB\") for review of their placement. The result is that it takes less *129\ntime for a resident to work his way through MPU. She says the previous policy was inherently unfair because the\nTDB met only once a week and any resident who was sent to MPU was often forced to wait a week for the TDB\nto reconvene. Having reviewed the MPU procedures, the Court of Appeals has already concluded that MPU is\n\"an integral part of the Plan's system of graduated and defined offenses and sanctions\" and that \"the Plan\npreserves clinical treatment programs and procedural safeguards ... [and seems] well within reasonable\nrequirements.\" King, 149 F.3d at 21, 22.\nAs to treatment issues, therapeutic activities have been expanded and specialized. The primary components of\nthe treatment program at the Center are primary groups, specialty groups, and psycho-educational classes.\nThe current therapy participation rate is 65 - 68%. Dr. Schwartz would like to see more residents active in\ntherapy. Socially-inactive, underdeveloped, or cognitively-impaired residents are separated into different units for\nboth security and therapeutic reasons. Therapies are then tailored to each particular group. While Dr. Schwartz\nattested to her satisfaction with the treatment program and DOC's response to some of her concerns, she did not\nconceal her other concerns. She has submitted a plan to DOC on a program designed to encourage those who\n\ndo not participate in the various therapies and classes to become more comfortable in those social interactions\nand to participate in treatment.\nEach term JRI publishes a roster of all of the classes which are offered for that particular quarter. The psycho-\neducational classes currently offered to residents include Relapse Prevention; Addictions and Recovery; Family\nDynamics; Anger Management; Men's Work; Drama Therapy; writing Behavioral Treatment Scripts; Creating\nChange; Domestic Violence; and Gender Differences. However, inmates who are participating in DOC's intensive\nPhase IV program receive priority for Addictions and Recovery and Creating Change classes. In a few instances,\nnot all of the classes offered were listed on the roster form because they were instituted after the roster list was\npublished. Residents and inmates sometimes take classes together. Residents receive priority for classes taught\n[26]\nby JRI staff.  Dr. Schwartz says that if residents were ever prevented from taking a course because of the\nnumber of inmates who signed up, then another class was opened to accommodate them. There was one\ninstance where inmates were enrolled in the \"Negotiating Conflict\" class and residents were left on a waitlist.\nAccording to Dr. Cusack this was an oversight and residents should have received priority. In addition, there was\ntestimony about the fact that residents are sometimes required to retake courses. For example, a resident who\nreceives an OBR, may have to retake a course such as \"Anger Management.\" Also, residents may have to retake\na relapse prevention course if a length of time has passed since they originally passed it.\nAnother integral aspect of the treatment provided at the Center is the avocational and educational classes offered\nto residents. JRI and DOC staff agree that such offerings are important to a meaningful treatment program.\nAvocational/educational programs offered to residents at the Treatment Center include instruction in basic skills;\nspecial education courses; general equivalency degree courses (\"G.E.D.\"); and courses in general interest. This\n130 past winter there were 47 classes offered, including classes in math (pre-G.E.D., G.E.D., and pre-college); social \n*130 studies; history; current events; science; language; reading; African American Culture; English for non-\nEnglish speakers; French; Spanish; Computer Skills; Music; Journalism; Health and Nutrition; sewing; Job Skills;\nWoodshop; Culinary Arts; Strengthening the Family Unit; Creative Problem Solving; Social Skills; Survival Skills/\n[27]\nRelapse Prevention; and Open Art Room.  These classes meet either once or twice a week. For a period of\ntime during the transition from dual agency control to DOC control, aspects of the avocational/educational\nprogram were shut down. The program is now back up and running and the number of classes being offered is\nincreasing.\nA work program is similarly important to a sex offender treatment program. The work program at the Treatment\nCenter offers residents and inmates a variety of jobs which are compensated according to a tiered wage system\nthat pays $1.00, $1.50 or $2.00 per day. There are also some special rate jobs which are funded by vendors.\nApproximately 121 residents have jobs at the Center.\nJob assignments and priorities were a constant complaint reflected in the residents' testimony, but there is a\nprocess in place which gives residents priority for certain jobs. Residents are placed in jobs by the DOC\nAssignment Officer. The Assignment Officer maintains a master list of all of the job positions available at the\n[28]\nTreatment Center and whether they are held by an inmate or resident.  According to the Plan, when there is a\njob vacancy, the Assignment Officer will post a notice in the Housing Units describing the responsibilities, hours,\nand pay for that position, together with a sign up sheet on which inmates and residents may sign up for the job.\nThe Assignment Officer will then interview individuals and make a selection. When there is a vacancy for a\nposition which was previously held by a resident, DOC's priority is to fill the job with another resident. While DOC\nmaintains this is its practice, there is no written policy which provides that residents are entitled to receive priority.\nSuperintendent Murphy acknowledges that it should be formally included in the written policy.\nSome residents allege that DOC has engaged in job-splitting in order to create enough positions to accommodate\nthe influx of inmates. For example, residents complain that a once five-day position has been split into two\npositions, a two-day and three-day, so that two people can have that job. Deputy Superintendent Spataro says\nthat some job-splitting did occur to generate jobs for the new inmates because the Treatment Center budget for\njobs initially stayed the same. Nevertheless, there are a wide variety of jobs available to and presently held by\nresidents. Mr. Murphy says that while all permanent positions should be posted in accordance with the policy, he\nacknowledges that there was an occasion where a job previously held by an inmate was filled by an inmate\nwithout being posted. According to Murphy, this was a mistake which DOC subsequently remedied by creating a\n\n[29]\nposition for a resident.  At least one resident testified that he believes DOC complies with policy in posting all\njobs which become available.\nIn addition, DOC recently instituted a new work policy which requires residents to participate in therapy in order to\n131 be able to take part in the work program.[30]*131 The idea of tying treatment to work was contemplated on page\n5 of the Plan under the section entitled \"Program Goals and Summaries\" which mentions \"the development of\nmethods to utilize preferential work program assignments as an incentive for treatment.\" Dr. Schwartz does not\nhave any objection to this policy.\nOf major concern to Dr. Schwartz was the introduction of 360 inmates into the Treatment Center. Since that time,\nshe has observed policy changes relating to property, security and disciplinary procedures. In particular, there\nhave been problems with delays, job assignments, and interrogations which are clearly reflected in the testimony\nof residents and staff. For example, many residents complain about the increased number of pat searches, strip\nsearches, metal detector searches and random urinalysis testing that are conducted since the inmates arrived at\nthe Treatment Center. Also attributed to the inmate presence is the increased interruptions to therapy classes on\naccount of frequent drills now conducted at the Center. Some residents complain that their therapy time has been\nreduced by as much as twenty-five to fifty percent as a result of these drills. Nevertheless, Dr. Schwartz finds that\nthe presence of inmates brings positive influences to the Center. She specifically notes the increased interaction\nwhich comes with the energy of a new group and the benefits of change for a group that had been resistant to\nchange.\nDr. Schwartz recognized that one of the areas in need of improvement is the Community Access Program\n(\"CAP\"), and she has voiced her concerns to JRI and DOC. The CAP was conceptualized as part of a multi-\nphase community access program which allows residents who are ready for a less restrictive environment to\ntransition from the medium security setting of the Treatment Center to a minimum security phase, then pre-\nrelease phase, and finally to reintegration into the community. Fifty-four pages of the Plan are devoted to the\nCAP. All witnesses agree that an important element of sex offender treatment is to have a community access\nprogram which offers controlled access to the community. Gradual reintegration is particularly important given\nthat residents who have been at the Treatment Center for several years may be especially in need of help in\nreadjusting to the community.\nMs. King who chairs the Community Access Center, outlined the annual review process that each resident\nundergoes to evaluate his sexual dangerousness status and assess his progress in treatment. She spoke at\nlength about the CAP and acknowledged that there are no residents currently in the program and that no\nresidents have applied to the program in the last year. She attributes this to several reasons, namely, that some\nresidents are comfortable at the Center and do not wish to leave because they do not have families or homes to\nreturn to upon release; participation in the CAP is not required in order to participate in the Section 9 hearing\nprocess and have one's sexually dangerous label lifted; residents with criminal sentences pending are no longer\n[31]\neligible for the CAP;  and the sad reality that some residents suffer from a hopelessness and depression and\ndo not wish to participate in the CAP.\nWhile the CAP is more restrictive under the Plan than it was at one time, the Plan is responding to legislative\nchanges, in addition to changes in the thinking about sex offenders. As the First Circuit has already remarked,\n132 CAP represents a \"sensitive *132 area of tension between safety and treatment, and between the individual and\nthe community.\" King, 149 F.3d at 16. The Court acknowledged a shrinkage of numbers in the CAP and that a\n[32]\nsubstantial number of residents refused to participate in treatment programs. Id. However, the Court went on\nto say that this did not constitute any constitutional failure, given the background that \"a substantial number of\nresidents, many of whom are serving very lengthy sentences, simply refuse to participate in or apply to treatment\nprograms.\" Having reviewed the CAP provisions and signaled its approval, the Court of Appeals went on to state\nthat \"whereas access to the community had earlier been approved prior to the designing of a program, careful,\neven meticulous, planning must now precede approval of access ... we cannot say that the CAP is not the least\nrestrictive feasible response.\" Id.\nA community access program is indispensable in a treatment program, but it is not functioning at the capacity it\nwas hoped to at the Treatment Center today. As Mr. Canfield candidly acknowledged, there are difficulties in\n\noperating a sex offender treatment program in Massachusetts at this time. This acknowledgment is especially\nnoteworthy because it underlines the challenge to DOC to operate the Treatment Center amidst a currently\nadverse political climate.\nThe Circuit Court also reviewed transfer procedures which allow DOC to transfer a resident who is still serving an\nunexpired criminal sentence to a correctional institution if the resident is unamenable to treatment, unwilling to\n[33]\nfollow a treatment program, or poses a danger to staff or residents.  The Court of Appeals concluded that the\ntransfer policy contained adequate assurances of treatment in that an effort will be made to transfer the resident\nto an institution where sex offender treatment is available and that the statute requires DOC to make voluntary\ntreatment services available. King, 149 F.3d at 18. There was no testimony at the hearing to indicate that this\nprocedure was not being followed.\nDr. Schwartz testified that her work is not affected by the consent decrees and that she does not consult them in\nsupervising treatment at the Center. Moreover, any concerns she has had about treatment she has shared with\nDOC and has received a satisfactory response. This news is further supported by the Circuit Court's opinion\nwhich stated that the transfer of dual control to exclusive DOC management, combined with the Plan \"does not\nappear likely to undermine the Original Decree or to violate the Constitution.\" King, 149 F.3d at 19.\nBoth Mr. Canfield and Dr. Cusack also testified about their interaction with DOC. Both say that they have worked\nand are continuing to work with DOC to minimize interruptions and to set priorities for residents to benefit from\npyschoeducational, avocational, and job programs. Despite the inevitable \"mistake,\" both are satisfied with\nDOC's attitude and response towards them. While they acknowledge that things at the Treatment Center are not\nperfect, they believe that the overall atmosphere and relationship with DOC is positive. Moreover, the transfer of\ncontrol from DMH to DOC has been helpful they say, because they have found it easier to deal with one agency\nas opposed to two.\nDr. Cusack does not believe that the presence of inmates is adversely affecting therapy. He supports the\ntestimony that residents receive priority for psychoeducational classes and certain jobs. He believes that the\n133 programs are effective and *133 are improving. All in all, he believes that DOC and JRI are providing meaningful\ntreatment. He is familiar with the Plan and believes that DOC has been complying with the Plan as it relates to\nproviding therapy and treatment.\nOf particular note was Mr. Canfield's testimony regarding the resignation of Mr. James Moody as Director of the\n[34]\nTransition House.  Mr. Moody resigned because of what he considered to be DOC's indifference to the CAP.\nMr. Canfield acknowledged the difficulties Mr. Moody encountered during the transfer of authority from DMH to\nDOC, but he split the blame between Mr. Moody and DOC. For example, Canfield refused to fire Mr. Moody at\nDOC's request, yet he felt that Mr. Moody had not performed well in his work with DOC. Compounding the\nsituation, Mr Moody was reprimanded by DOC when he allowed a resident to make a personal call. Mr. Moody\nresented the inquiry and resigned. While Mr. Canfield would not have fired Mr. Moody, he was not satisfied with\nhis performance and accepted the resignation.\nIn summary, the testimony of JRI officials shows a cooperative working relationship and an open line of\ncommunication with DOC and a willingness on the part of DOC to respond to concerns expressed by JRI\npersonnel.\n[35]\nThe testimony of the plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Theoharis Seghorn,  did little to change my assessment of JRI's\ncapability. Dr. Seghorn experienced the Center while it was under the dual control of DMH and DOC. Dr. Seghorn\ndescribed what the conditions were when he began work at the Center in 1977. Regarding the CAP, Dr. Seghorn\nestimated that between 1979 and 1984 there were several thousand individual trips made by residents into the\ncommunity. Five or six DMH employees were available to escort residents into the community and estimated that\nten to fifteen percent of the population participated in these escorted trips. In addition to trips into the community,\nsome residents had their own car, established their own bank accounts and were allowed overnight stays away\nfrom the Treatment Center.\nI accept Dr. Seghorn's views on the importance of a CAP to a treatment program, a view echoed by JRI as well,\nbut he did not testify in light of the legislative constraints which exist on the CAP today. His testimony, overall,\n\nwas favorable to JRI's programs, programs which remain in place under DOC management of the Center.\nDescribing its work as \"effective, highly professional, and state-of-the-art programming,\" he commended JRI for\nsignificant improvement, in \"instituting the most valid treatment models available today,\" a system which \"should\n[36]\nserve as a national model for such programming.\"\nThe most vital testimony in the course of this litigation has come from the residents themselves. Keeping that in\nmind, I have carefully reviewed the affidavits and testimony presented by the men who are civilly-committed to\nthe Center. In addition, I have reviewed the hundreds of letters that I have received from residents over the years,\nwhich address a variety of issues having to do with the Treatment Center.\n134 *134 Residents' complaints about the present conditions of the Treatment Center primarily concern MPU\nplacement; the increased number of searches; the interruption of therapy due to drills and scheduled movements;\nthe atmosphere at the Treatment Center since the introduction of inmates; and the effect that the presence of\ninmates has on classes, work opportunities, the maintenance of property, and the use of the library, gym, and\nrecreation area.\n[37]\nSome of these concerns are reflected in the minutes of the weekly Treatment Advisory Board meetings.\nResident representatives attend these weekly meetings for the purpose of discussing treatment matters with Dr.\nSchwartz. Dr. Schwartz has relayed residents' concerns to DOC and some changes have resulted. For example,\never since a therapist was assaulted by an inmate, all therapy has been conducted within the sight and sound of\na corrections officer. Doors to therapy rooms were left open, leaving the room visible to corrections officers, as\nwell as other residents and inmates. Residents complained about how the presence of guards affected their\ntherapy sessions and in particular, how it disturbed the confidentiality of the session. Under present policy, the\ndoors are not ajar, but are closed to the deadbolt stop, so that while the \"sight and sound\" policy of DOC is\nmaintained for security reasons, privacy is maintained for treatment purposes. According to Dr. Schwartz, therapy\nis better now because the staff feel safer. In another example, to reduce delays in getting to use the gym, DOC\nhas scheduled movements for civils to begin a few minutes earlier than movements for inmates. This also\nlessens the delay in getting other residents to their therapy sessions.\nThis court and the Court of Appeals have already examined many of the same types of criticisms leveled by\nresidents about the management and operation of the Center. Citing residents' complaints about the amount of\nclothing, funds, telephone calls, room visits, stamps, etc., the First Circuit held that \"the Plan justifies some\nreduction in these privileges because of past experiences with security, assault, gambling, coercion and\ninterruptions in treatment,\" and that \"[n]o reduction rises to the level of a constitutional infraction.\" King, 149 F.3d\nat 19.\nTo be sure, there are issues that arise in the day to day management of the Treatment Center. Funds are being\nsought from capital planning funds to install toilet facilities accessible to the yard to attempt to address the\nresidents' complaint about the lack of toilet facilities in the yard. While this complaint was the subject of resident\ntestimony, the records do not show any request by a resident for a special accommodation because of a urinary\n[38]\nor other problem that may force an individual to defecate or urinate while in the yard.\nMoreover, there are differences between the rules governing residents and those governing inmates. For\ninstance, there are differences in the policies which apply to residents and inmates regarding property and MPU\nplacement (inmates have follow-up hearings before the Disciplinary Board while residents appear before the\nBehavior Review Committee). As previously mentioned, residents are allowed to begin their scheduled\n135 movements a few minutes before the inmates. This staggered movement has alleviated some of the *135 delays\nin getting residents to therapy, the gym or other activities.\nIt is not all clear sailing, to say the least. Testimony from the residents shows that sessions are interrupted by\nmandatory drills, but efforts are made to schedule drills in the beginning of sessions so as to have minimum\ninterruptions. Various searches are conducted, however, these are necessary for security reasons. The telephone\nsystem has failed on occasion and once a resident was not reached in time to receive important personal news\nfrom his family, a terribly unfortunate event. Again however, this was not described as a constant problem. Among\nresidents' other complaints are that light bulbs are not replaced and carbon paper is not made available for\n\npurchase. Discipline is alleged to be erratic and unfair, and the assertion was made that a \"mental watch\" was\napplied in some cases as a means of keeping a resident in MPU detention. Residents also say that the release\nprocess is affected and hindered by an ineffective community access program and \"roadblocks\" put in the way of\neligible. An independent letter from resident Eugene Rector deals with issues which he says were overlooked in\ntestimony, but which I believe were covered adequately at the hearing, such as therapy time, interruptions, and\nwork assignments.\nThe question is whether these complaints, taken in their totality, impair, or affect treatment so as to render it\nineffective and, therefore, in violation of the statute and the consent decrees. I conclude they do not, considered\nin their totality, render treatment ineffective. Rather, I conclude that the treatment provided is effective and\nprovided under the least restrictive conditions given all the circumstances that exist at the Treatment Center. I rely\non the testimony summarized above, my oversight over the years, my visits to the Center and most importantly,\nthe Plan as the governing document of the Treatment Center. I repeat the comment of Judge Coffin that the Plan\njustifies some reduction in privileges for security reasons and that \"[no] reduction rises to the level of a\n[39]\nconstitutional infraction.\" King, 149 F.3d at 19.\nThe testimony of the residents, which I credit, shows two major problems confronting the Treatment Center,\nnamely, the state of the Community Access Program and the influx of DOC inmates. A review of the CAP reveals\nthat it is cumbersome and that it requires a maintained effort on a resident's part to complete each phase of the\nprogram. That being said, there is nothing in the record which specifically explains what, if any, \"roadblocks\" exist\nwhich hinder residents' participation in the CAP or otherwise demonstrate that the program is not accessible to\nthem. Of course, there have been isolated instances where mistakes were made on the part of DOC. For\ninstance, one resident testified that he had applied for and received approval from the Community Access Board\nto move to another phase in the CAP and was awaiting final approval from the Superintendent. According to the\nPlan, the Superintendent is required to act within fifteen days of the Board's issuance of its report. The\nSuperintendent thus failed to follow the policy in this particular instance. However, there was nothing in the record\nwhich indicates that this is a repeated failing.\nI recognize the validity of the circumstances which Ms. King says contributes to the low participation rate.\nNevertheless, as all who testified agree, the CAP is an important component of the Treatment Center. Therefore,\n136 it needs attention in *136 such a way as to encourage and facilitate greater participation in the program so that\nresidents receive the benefit of the program before being released to the public. This is not a problem which can\nbe addressed by the micro-management of the federal court. The CAP policies set forth an adequate means for\nproviding community access. We rely on the professional judgment of treatment providers to coordinate efforts\nwith DOC to achieve greater participation.\nClearly, the presence of 360 DOC inmates, and the possibility that more will be sent to the Treatment Center as\nspace becomes available has an effect and in some instances, an adverse affect. And I understand that there\nmay be issues arising out of the administration of the Plan in the future if DOC becomes indifferent to its\nresponsibilities both under the statute and the Plan to keep residents separate and apart from inmates. If ignored,\nthe Plan will simply replace the consent decrees as the basis of future complaints and the parties will be destined\nfor a future generation of litigation. At this point, however, I conclude that the Commonwealth has sustained its\nburden of demonstrating that the underlying conditions that existed when the decrees were entered have been\nremedied and that the Commonwealth has complied with the decrees in good faith since they were entered. I\nconclude further that, after considering the record of the past twenty-five years, the recent legislative enactments,\nand the potential for influence of political attitudes and economic forces in this complex and challenging area of\nlaw and administration, there is little or no likelihood that the Treatment Center will revert to an earlier time, nor\nthat the constitutional violations will be repeated when the decree is lifted.\nAs this Circuit has said in an earlier opinion in this litigation:\nIn institutional reform litigation, injunctions should not operate inviolate in perpetuity. See Rufo v.\nInmates of the Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 112 S.Ct. 748, 762-65, 116 L.Ed.2d 867 (1992); \nBoard of Educ. v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 111 S.Ct. 630, 112 L.Ed.2d 715 (1991); see also Milk\nWagon Drivers Union v. Meadowmoor Dairies, Inc., 312 U.S. 287, 298-99, 61 S.Ct. 552, 85 L.Ed.\n\n836 (1941) (explaining that continuation of an injunction is justified only by continuation of the\ncircumstances which induced it). This must mean that, notwithstanding the parties' silence or\ninertia, the district court is not doomed to some Sisyphean fate, bound forever to enforce and\ninterpret a preexisting decree without occasionally pausing to question whether changing\ncircumstances have rendered the decree unnecessary, outmoded, or even harmful to the public\n[40]\ninterest.\nBased on the full record, these consent decrees should be terminated. They no longer confer any benefit on the\noperation of the Treatment Center other than serving as a constant reminder of the federal court's presence for\nover twenty-five years. A telling point in Superintendent Murphy's testimony came when he was asked his basis\nof reference when he was considering a policy or procedure change and whether he considered the consent\ndecree. In candor, he stated that he did not consider the consent decree but rather, he turned to the Plan and\nwas guided by it. While this appears to be a most damning statement, upon reflection, I believe it is simply candid\ntestimony that these twenty-five year old consent decrees are no longer the tools or rules of governance and are\n137 no longer necessary to the operation of a secure and effective Treatment *137 Center. Effective treatment is\noffered; physical conditions have improved greatly; there are differing levels of security; meaningful work,\neducation, and avocational programs; and discipline, including sequestration, conforms to acceptable standards\nof due process; all under the least restrictive conditions necessary to achieve the purposes of commitment,\nnamely, the care, treatment, rehabilitation, and custody of sexually dangerous persons.\nI believe the Management Plan is an enforceable operating document that recognizes the improvements made\nas a result of the consent decrees over the years and acknowledges DOC's responsibilities to manage the\nTreatment Center accordingly.\nI recognize that residents will continue to voice their complaints about the circumstances of their existence at the\nTreatment Center. This decision does not preclude them from challenging events on the basis of constitutional or\nother protected rights. In the first place, residents may bring an action to enforce the terms of the existing Plan.\nMoreover, as the First Circuit stated in affirming a district court's decision to terminate another consent decree,\nplaintiffs remain \"free to initiate a new round of proceedings designed to show that post-termination conditions\nactually do violate their federally protected rights.\" Rouse, 129 F.3d at 662. I remind the parties again today that\nany new allegations of unconstitutional conditions or treatment will be addressed in separate proceedings.\nIV.\nAn additional argument defendants advance is that the consent decrees must be terminated pursuant to the\nPrison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\"PLRA\"), 18 U.S.C. § 3626, amended by Pub.L. No. 105-119, § 1239(a)(2),\n111 Stat. 2440, 2470 (1997). I address this argument in the interest of completing the record for the purposes of\n[41]\ncross-appeals. Based on a reading of the statute itself, PLRA case law  and the case law that has developed\naround the Treatment Center, I find that the PLRA has no application to the consent decrees.\nThe PLRA reforms the federal courts' adjudicatory powers over prisoner-initiated civil litigation. Among its many\nprovisions, the PLRA limits the power of district courts to grant prospective relief by declaring that \"in any civil\naction with respect to prison conditions, a defendant or intervenor shall be entitled to the immediate termination of\n[42]\nany prospective relief  if the relief was approved or granted in the absence of a finding by the court that the\nrelief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the\nleast intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right.\" 18 U.S.C.A. § 3626(b)(2). Such\nprospective relief shall not terminate, however, \"if the court makes written findings based on the record that\nprospective relief remains necessary to correct a current or ongoing violation of the Federal right, extends no\nfurther than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and that the prospective relief is narrowly\ndrawn and the least intrusive means to correct the violation.\" Id. § 3626(b)(3).\n138 *138 As a matter of statutory interpretation, the PLRA does not extend to cover civilly-committed residents at the\nTreatment Center. In the first place, the Treatment Center is not a facility to which coverage of the PLRA extends.\nThe PLRA applies only to persons who are subject to incarceration, detention or admission to \"prisons\" as\n\ndefined by the statute. The PLRA defines \"prisoner\" as \"any person subject to incarceration, detention, or\nadmission to any facility who is accused of, convicted of, sentenced for, or adjudicated delinquent for, violations\nof criminal law or the terms and conditions of parole, probation, pre-trial release, or diversionary program.\" Id. §\n3626(g)(3). \"Prison\" is defined as \"any Federal, State, or local facility that incarcerates or detains juveniles or\nadults accused of, convicted of, sentenced for, or adjudicated delinquent for, violations of criminal law.\" Id. § 3626\n(g)(5). Civilly-committed patients are not \"prisoners,\" nor is the Treatment Center a \"prison\" within the meaning of\nthe PLRA.\nThe applicability of the PLRA to the Treatment Center is an issue of first impression in this Circuit. However, other\ncourts have addressed the issue and have concluded that the PLRA has no application. In a case which bears\nsimilar analysis to the Treatment Center, West v. Macht, 986 F.Supp. 1141 (W.D.Wis.1997), the district court held\nthat a person who was civilly-committed pursuant to Wisconsin's sexual predator law was not a \"prisoner\" within\nmeaning of the PLRA. While the person had been convicted of a criminal violation, his current detention was not\npart of the punishment for that crime, but was instead a civil commitment imposed upon a judicial determination\n[43]\nthat he was a sexually violent person under Wisconsin law.\nMassachusetts courts have repeatedly stressed that the residents at the Treatment Center are there for\ntreatment, not for punishment and that they were sent there as civilly-committed individuals, not as convicted\ncriminals. Under M.G.L. ch. 123A, patients are committed for \"treatment and rehabilitation\" and not for\npunishment. Commonwealth v. Page, 339 Mass. 313, 318, 159 N.E.2d 82 (1959). Treatment Center case law is\n[44]\nreplete with instances that consistently refer to the non-punitive purpose of the facility.  Further, as noted\nabove, at this writing there are eleven residents at the Center who were sent to the Treatment Center without\never receiving a criminal sentence. Of the remaining 165 residents, 89 have completed their criminal sentences\n139 and remain there solely on the basis of their civil commitment. Given the unique nature of *139 the facility, the\nPLRA should not apply to the consent decrees governing Treatment Center operations.\nIt is for these reasons that I find that the PLRA does not apply to the Treatment Center and therefore provides no\nbasis for terminating the consent decrees.\nV.\nThe Commonwealth has phrased its motion alternatively, to vacate or terminate the consent decrees. In Rufo, the\ndefendants asked the district court to enter an order that vacated the consent decree. In that case, the district\ncourt decided to terminate, but not vacate, the decrees. As the district judge stated in that case, a consent decree\nis \"an adjudication of an ongoing obligation based on a claim of `violation of a Federal right' that was at least one\npart of the subject matter of the civil action in which the Consent Decree was entered. That adjudication may still\nhave pragmatic consequences even after the prospective relief that had earlier been included in the Consent\nDecree has been terminated.\" Rufo, 952 F.Supp. at 883-84. The First Circuit upheld the trial court's decision to\nterminate, rather than vacate, the consent decrees, noting that the distinction between the terms has practical\nsignificance. \"While terminating a consent decree strips it of future potency, the decree's past puissance is\npreserved and certain of its collateral effects may endure.\" Rouse, 129 F.3d at 662. I believe a record of the past\nshould be preserved and, accordingly, I grant the motion to terminate the consent decrees. The King and \nWilliams cases are to be closed by the Clerk.\nSo Ordered.\n[1]See King v. Greenblatt, 149 F.3d 9 (1st Cir. 1998); King v. Greenblatt, 127 F.3d 190 (1st Cir.1997); In Re\nPearson, 990 F.2d 653 (1st Cir.1993); Pearson v. Fair, 935 F.2d 401 (1st Cir.1991); Pearson v. Fair, No. 81-3219\n(D.Mass.1989); Langton v. Johnston, 928 F.2d 1206 (1st Cir.1991); Williams v. Lesiak, 822 F.2d 1223 (1st Cir.\n1987); Pearson v. Fair, 808 F.2d 163 (1st Cir.1986).\n[2] Mass.Gen.Laws ch. 123A § 9 provides for a periodic review of a civilly-committed resident's sexual\ndangerousness in the form of a hearing. Upon a determination that an individual is no longer sexually dangerous,\n\nhe is returned to a correctional institution to complete his criminal sentence, or, where he has not received a\ncriminal sentence, or has completed it, he is released to the public.\n[3] Mitchell King was a Treatment Center resident who alleged that his constitutional rights had been violated by\nbeing placed in solitary confinement, a six by nine foot filthy cell with no toilet, sink, drinking water, visits, nor\nreading material without giving him notice and an opportunity to be heard, for calling a guard a \"dingbat\". Harold\nWilliams, another resident, alleged that his due process rights were violated by the inadequacy of treatment\nprovided at the Treatment Center, specifically by deficiencies in job training, work programs, and education.\n[4] On November 5, 1974, counsel for the plaintiffs and the Commonwealth submitted Stipulations of Fact\nconcerning the Treatment Center which were accepted by Judge Wyzanski. These stipulations provide the basis\nof the consent decrees and describe in great detail the conditions which the decrees were meant to correct. The\nrecord does not reflect any other basis for the entry of the consent decrees; that is, there are no transcribed\nrecords of any hearings or court memoranda to describe the conditions at the Treatment Center.\n[5] These provisions reflected the language of then Mass.Gen.Laws ch. 123A, § 2.\n[6] For example, the Minimum Privilege Unit rooms, once the subject of King's complaint, now measure eight by\nsixteen feet and are equipped with toilets and sinks. Residents in those rooms have access to the telephone,\nlibrary materials, canteen, exercise periods, visitors and treatment.\n[7] Plaintiffs in both cases sought enforcement of the consent decrees and civil contempt for defendants' alleged\nviolations of the terms of the decrees. The Pearson case challenged the use of sequestration and the Langton\ncase challenged the adequacy of treatment. After successive trials in the spring of 1989, I dismissed both\ncomplaints. At that time, I left the King case open, viewing it as the appropriate vehicle within which to resolve\ncomplaints about operations at the Treatment Center.\n[8] See Final Report of the Governor's Special Advisory Panel on Forensic Mental Health, September 1989.\nRepeal of the statute had also been recommended by the American Bar Association in its 1984 proposed\nCriminal Justice Mental Health Standards, citing a report by the American Psychiatry Association which stated\nthat mental disability was no longer considered the underlying basis of sexual offenses.\n[9] That history is chronicled in King v. Greenblatt, 52 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.1995) and King v. Greenblatt, 127 F.3d 190\n(1st Cir.1997).\n[10] I received a letter from forty-eight residents complaining about conditions at the Treatment Center and\ntreated it as a pro se complaint.\n[11] Because Williams focused on treatment issues and programs, I appointed separate counsel for the Williams\nplaintiffs on April 17, 1995.\n[12] A similar effort to enjoin the placement of 48 sentenced sex offenders was also rebuffed in state court. Miller\nv. DuBois, No. 97-P-138 (Mass.App.Ct. June 3, 1998).\n[13] As I have said before, the purpose of the monthly reports was not to make findings, but to observe DOC's\nability to implement the treatment program established in the Plan. See King v. Greenblatt, No. 72-788, slip op. at\n16 (D.Mass, December 29, 1997).\n[14] In the Spring of 1995, DOC moved 60 inmates who were participating in the intensive treatment phase\n(Phase IV) of the DOC sex offender treatment program from the Southeastern Correctional Center to the\nTreatment Center's D-2 unit.\n[15] The defendants also claim that the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3626, amended by Pub.L. No.\n105-119, § 123(a)(2), 111 Stat. 2440, 2470 (1997), mandates termination, a claim I address later in this\nmemorandum.\n[16] The plaintiffs originally requested discovery going back to 1972, a request I considered unnecessary and\nduplicative given the full record developed over the past twenty-seven years. However, since plaintiffs responses\n\nto the monthly reports showed clearly their skepticism of DOC's ability to manage the Treatment Center, I granted\ndiscovery but limited it to the relevant period since DOC assumed control of the facility.\n[17] There are also rooms available to residents in the Transition House. Currently five residents reside in the\nTransition House.\n[18] This also reflects the understanding articulated in Commonwealth v. Page, 339 Mass. 313, 159 N.E.2d 82\n(1959). In that case, the SJC required the release of a civilly-committed person because the facility did not\nconstitute a valid Treatment Center under Mass. Gen.Laws ch. 123A where he was housed with the general\nprison population and was not provided with separate sex offender treatment because the only treatment then\navailable was the therapy available to the total prison population.\n[19] See William D. Pithers, Ph.D., Technical Assistance Report: Massachusetts Department of Correction, June\n8, 1994 at 15.\n[20] According to Dr. Schwartz, Happy Hour was instituted when DOC assumed control of the Treatment Center.\nHappy Hour is a practice common to many security programs. It consists of Treatment Center staff making\nthemselves available outside the dining hall two times a week to listen to residents and speak to them about their\nconcerns.\n[21] Testimony was taken from Marie King, Director of Forensic Psychological Services and Chair of the\nCommunity Access Center; Joseph Murphy, Director of Classification and Programs; Superintendent Robert\nMurphy; and Deputy Superintendent Patricia Spitaro. Deputy Superintendent Spitaro left DOC shortly after this\nhearing.\n[22] The accreditation by the American Correctional Association (\"ACA\") was derided by plaintiffs in their\nresponse to DOC's first monthly report as inapplicable because the ACA was not qualified to deal with \"mental\ninstitutions\", a classification of the Treatment Center which has been asserted repeatedly by the plaintiffs, and\nwhich, I believe is mistaken. See King, 149 F.3d at 18 for the First Circuit's discussion regarding the application of\nYoungberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982) to this case.\n[23] See 103 CMR 431.0 \"It is a basic tenet of sex offender treatment that sex offenders are responsible for their\nbehavior and that they are responsible for knowing and conforming to laws set down by society. To further the\ngoals of a cognitive behavioral treatment program while ensuring fairness to all residents, 103 CMR 431.0\ninstitutes a clear set of rules linked to a clear set of sanctions, which could be modified according to mitigating or\naggravating circumstances.\" Included in the policy is a provision which allows a resident to be placed in MPU\nwhile pending a hearing or the completion of an investigation or while awaiting transfer to another facility.\n[24] The MPU is used to sequester residents for reasons set forth definitively in the Plan.\n[25] 103 MTC 423.07 provides that residents in the MPU will be provided treatment by their regular treatment\nteam unless some modification is dictated by safety and security. They also receive a physical and mental\nassessment conducted by a qualified health professional upon entry to the MPU.\n[26] On the top of the \"Roster of Psychoeducational Classes for Winter 1999\", (Ex. 8), its states \"All SDP/Civil\nResidents have first and last choice of any class offered by SDP staff.\" Also, the Inmate Orientation Handbook,\n(Ex. 53), which is provided to every inmate, states on Page 28, that \"Civil commitments have priority during sign-\nups of educational courses, library space, and recreation.\"\n[27] See \"Roster of Educational and Vocational Classes, Winter 1999\" (Ex. 9).\n[28] The Assignment Officer is required to maintain a monthly record of all of the inmates and residents who\nparticipate in the work program.\n[29] This event was recorded in the JRI staff member meeting notes of January 6, 1999. The minutes state, \"next\njob opening to be given to civil inmate.\"\n\n[30] This is per the recently revised DOC regulation, 103 DOC 450 00 \"Institution Work Assignments\", which\n97\nbecame effective March 8, 1999. It specifically requires residents who wish to hold a work position to be\n\"treatment compliant,\" as shown by an 80 percent participation rate in Primary Group. Participation is monitored\nweekly by Treatment Teams. According to the regulation it is \"the philosophy of the Massachusetts Treatment\nCenter that the primary focus for all inmates/residents housed at the facility shall be directed first to treatment\nprograms, and only then to other activities, e.g. work, recreation, etc.\"\n[31] Based on the Legislature's enactment of Mass.Gen.Laws ch. 123A § 6A. See Martel v. Fridovich, 14 F.3d 1\n(1st Cir.1993).\n[32] The Circuit Court acknowledged that in 1996, only 3 of the 91 eligible residents submitted applications and\nthat as of January 1997, only 2 remained in the program and 12 remained in the Community Transition program.\n[33] Mr. Canfield drafted the Transition Program utilized since November 1992.\n[34] Mr. Moody is a licensed mental health counselor who worked at the Treatment Center from June 1993 until\nhe resigned on October 6, 1996. He was hired by JRI as Program Manager of JRI's Transition Program. His job\nwas to implement what is now referred to as the Community Access Program. He also led therapy sessions and\ntaught psychoeducational classes. He resigned in protest over his belief that DOC was interfering with the CAP\nand that DOC lacked the \"willingness, desire and ability to implement or manage a CAP.\" (Moody Aff. ¶ 4).\n[35] Dr. Seghorn is a licensed psychologist who was employed at the Center from 1977 to 1981 as Director of\nClinical Services and from 1981-1986 as Assistant Administrator. He is now employed by New England Forensic\nAssociates.\n[36] Letter dated March 7, 1997 from Dr. Seghorn to Gregory Canfield, JRI (Ex. 7).\n[37] Minutes of the Treatment Advisory Board Meeting, May 29, 1997 discuss a perception by the new DOC\ninmates that they are better than the civilly committed residents ... because \"they are labeled sexually dangerous\nand ... are considered very sick ... inmates are getting the message from some C.O.s and gym coaches to stay\naway.\" (Ex. 5). Minutes from the Senior Staff Meeting, February 8, 1999 state \"Issue with inmates v.\ncivils00concerning the use of gym equipment. Mike Concaiceo to draft plan to alleviate the problem. Joe to submit\n97\nplan to Superintendent by end of day.\" (Ex. 17).\n[38] This was also alleged in plaintiffs' Motion For Corrective Action as a basis for an Eighth Amendment violation.\n[39] It is, of course, true that the added emphasis on security and safety, together with a new approach to\nbehavior management ... will inevitably effect some retreat from a more permissive atmosphere. But appellants\nsweeping condemnation cannot stand without more precise identification of serious defects in the many\nprovisions regarding varieties of treatment, the extent of clinical supervision, and the safeguards of individual\nrights.

The First Circuit\nrecently upheld its constitutionality in Inmates of Suffolk County Jail v. Rouse, 129 F.3d 649 (1st Cir.1997).\nCongress is not finished with its drive to reform federal courts jurisdiction over prison litigation. H.R.3718, the\nDelay Amendment, provides that any consent decree in effect before PLRA's enactment \"that provides for\nremedies relative to prison conditions shall cease to be effective on the date of the enactment of this Act.\" That\nbill is languishing in the Senate at this writing.\n[42] \"Prospective relief\" includes \"all relief in any form that may be granted or approved by the court ... includ[ing]\nconsent decrees.\" Id. § 3626(g)(7), (9). \"Consent decree\" is defined as \"any relief entered by the court that is\n\nbased in whole or in part upon the consent or acquiescence of the parties but does not include private\nsettlements.\" Id. § 3626(g)(1).\n[43] Wisconsin law, Chapter 980 authorizes \"the civil commitment of persons, previously convicted of a sexually\nviolent offense, who currently suffer from a mental disorder that predisposes them to repeat such acts.\"\n[44]See Commonwealth v.

Pingeon and Beth Eisenberg on brief for the Center for Public Representation, amicus curiae.\nBefore SELYA, Circuit Judge, COFFIN and CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judges.\nCOFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.\n\nThis opinion is a continuation of King v. Greenblatt (\"King II\"), 127 F.3d 190 (1st Cir.1997), which is the latest\njudicial discussion in a group of cases dating back to 1972, concerning a resident population of civilly committed\nsexually dangerous persons in the Treatment Center at the Massachusetts Correctional Institute in Bridgewater,\nMassachusetts (Center). A reference to prior cases is contained in the opinion just cited. Our present review\nconcerns the proposed modifications, granted by the district court, of two longstanding consent decrees, the\nOriginal Decree and the Supplemental Decree.\nThe Original Decree had provided that the Center would be treated as a facility of the Department of Mental\nHealth (DMH), with primary authority to be exercised by DMH and custodial personnel to be controlled by the\nDepartment of Correction (DOC). Patients were to have \"the least restrictive conditions necessary to achieve the\npurpose of commitment.\" Both DMH and DOC were to \"take steps jointly\" to improve physical conditions, carry\nout a meaningful work program, and have \"a system of differing security for different categories of patients\" to\npermit less restrictive conditions for those patients not requiring maximum security.\nIn an earlier opinion we considered challenges to proposed modifications of that decree. See King v. Greenblatt\n12 (\"King I\"), 52 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.1995). We addressed the *12 significance of the recently enacted 1993 Mass Acts.\nch. 489, which gave DOC exclusive jurisdiction of the care, treatment, rehabilitation and 00 an added statutory\n97\ngoal 00 custody of civilly committed sexually dangerous persons in the Center. We held that this statute met the\n97\nfirst prong of Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 384, 112 S.Ct. 748, 116 L.Ed.2d 867 (1992)\n(i.e., it was a significant change of law impacting an existing consent decree, warranting modification of such\ndecree), but remanded the case to the district court to consider whether the proposed modifications met the\nsecond Rufo prong, id. (i.e., whether the modifications were \"suitably tailored\" to the new law). See King I, 52\nF.3d at 7.\nUpon remand, the district court found that the proposed modifications to the Original Degree were \"suitably\ntailored\" to the new law; the court also determined that the proposed modifications to the Supplemental Decree\nmet both prongs of Rufo as they were \"sufficiently related\" to the change in state law and \"suitably tailored.\" The\ncase was then appealed to us. We remanded it to the district court to address only issues relevant to the\nSupplemental Decree, and reserved our \"suitable tailoring\" review and all other issues relating to the Original\nDecree.\nWe recognized that the proposed modifications in the Supplemental Decree went beyond a transfer of exclusive\nauthority to DOC and would effect substantive changes in disciplinary policies, allowing the imposition of\nsequestration for punishment purposes (except for acts underlying commitment) and deleting a ban on all\ndiscipline and punitive procedures in the treatment of inmates civilly committed. See King II, 127 F.3d at 195. We\nopined that the link between a change in administration and sequestration policy was too tenuous, at least\nwithout further development. Id. We also held that neither Chapter 489, \"at least without further explanation,\" nor\nour speculation, standing alone, that the Massachusetts legislature had apparently accepted a preference for\nbehavior modification over mental health treatment would constitute a \"significant change in law\" affecting\nsequestration policy. Id.\nWe therefore sent back the proposed modifications of the Supplemental Decree to the district court for further\nconsideration, leaving it to the court to decide whether additional factual or opinion evidence was needed. The\ncourt has since complied with our directive and, after hearing and submissions, has determined both that the\nchange in control managed by Chapter 489 is a significant change in the law affecting the Supplemental Decree\nand that the modifications were suitably tailored. We now address this determination and all outstanding issues\nrelating to both decrees.\nThis litigation, now in its twenty-seventh year, involving half a dozen district judges, magistrate judges, and many\nconferences, hearings briefings, and appeals, has accomplished much in a troubled and complex field of custody\nand treatment of institutionalized sexually dangerous persons. During this period, changes have occurred in\nconditions of confinement and treatment, in the problems confronted, and in the institutional setting. After\nexhaustive briefings and argument from capable counsel, we conclude that the district court acted sensitively and\nappropriately in conducting the proceedings below, upholding the proposed modifications of both the Original\nDecree and the Supplemental Decree, and signaling its readiness to exercise its oversight when occasion\n\nwarrants. While we cannot expect \"closure\" of tensions and problems, we may hope for problems of smaller\ndimension capable of systematic resolution without the necessity of heroic effort.\nWe first address several issues relating to the Original Decree.\nI. The Original Decree.\nA. Denial of Discovery and Evidentiary Hearing.\nPlaintiffs repeatedly requested the opportunity to engage in discovery and an evidentiary hearing. They sought to\ndiscern whether DOC intended to provide \"meaningful treatment under the Plan\" and whether its treatment plan\nwas consistent with the \"least restrictive conditions\" requirement of the Original Decree. Plaintiffs proposed\n13 accomplishing this by exploring DOC's past *13 behavior, present behavior, and expressions of future intent.\nPlaintiffs' proposal contemplates interviews with all residents, examination of new procedures, expert testimony\ninterpreting the Plan, investigation of current practices, inquiry into internal memos relating to the Plan and the\npersons instrumental in formulating it, and depositions of DOC officials and Joint Resource Institute (JRI)\npersonnel responsible for treatment. As much as six months of time would be needed.\nThe basic response of the court in denying discovery requests was:\nIt may be that the plan won't work, but the Court of Appeals ... [told me not to] prejudge the plan,\nbut they told me ... I should have a hearing, inquire into the DOC plan, giving significant weight to\nthe local government.\n* * * * * *\n... [W]hat would DOC do under this plan? And then I should use my judicial oversight, primarily\nrely on my judicial oversight, to insure that the DOC is complying with the decrees. So it seems to\nme that that's a very clear blueprint.\nThis was an accurate precis of our directives \"to give significant weight to the views of local government officials\"\nand to \"rely primarily on its jurisdictional oversight to ensure DOC's compliance with the decrees.\" King I, 52 F.3d\nat 7. Moreover, even absent these directives, a trial court is vested with broad discretion in granting or denying\ndiscovery. 8 Charles A. Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 2006, at 91 (1994).\nThe task of the district court, following our directives, was to determine whether DOC, which had been given\nauthority under state law, was likely to manage the Center without doing violence to the substantive portions of\nthe Original Decree. In the words of the Special Master appointed by the court, the inquiry being undertaken was\n\"whether DOC is approaching the control of the institution with a treatment modality.\"\nIn support of its proposal for extensive discovery and hearing, plaintiffs relied principally on the extensive\nprocedure which the trial judge adopted on remand in Inmates of the Suffolk County Jail v. Rufo, 844 F.Supp. 31\n(D.Mass.1994). But it does not follow from the fact that a judge allowed discovery and evidentiary hearing in one\ncase that a denial of discovery in a different case is an abuse of discretion.\nAppellants' basic interest in discovery was to elicit views and evidence of DOC's sincerity. To test the viability of\nthis goal in the particular posture in which the district court found itself, we venture the following scenario.\nAssume that a number of witnesses testified in deposition or at a hearing that DOC officials were insincere and\nhad no intention of carrying out the Plan as written. If the court found the witnesses credible, would it then deny\nDOC's request to modify? The consequence would be that the Center would then revert to the earlier dual\nmanagement, despite the passage of Chapter 489. Or, would the court craft, as amicus argued, its own solution,\nsubstituting the Clinical Director for DOC, creating the bizarre situation of an employee of an entity under contract\nwith DOC holding powers denied to DOC? In either case DOC would have no future opportunity to demonstrate\nits fitness to manage.\n\nIt seems clear to us that had the court pursued either course, it would not have accorded \"significant weight to\nthe views of local government officials.\" Indeed, it would have rejected them in their entirety on the ground of\ninsincerity. This would violate not only our guidance but that of the Supreme Court in Rufo, 502 U.S. at 392 n. 14,\n112 S.Ct. 748. It would also violate our directive to rely primarily on continuing oversight.\nWe think it therefore reasonable, at the proposed modifications stage, that the district court declined to allow an\nextensive investigation as to whether DOC was acting in good faith. We are not saying that the court would have\nabused its discretion had it chosen to allow some kind of discovery and evidentiary hearing, but certainly it did not\nabuse its broad discretion in denying such.\nB. Delayed Appointment of Counsel.\nAmong the interests represented in the cluster of lawsuits now collected under the King v. Greenblatt tent are\n14 those raised in *14Williams v. Lesiak, 822 F.2d 1223 (1st Cir. 1987). In that case, the plaintiffs had focused on\ntreatment issues at the Center, particularly the absence or inferior quality of work, job training, and educational\nprograms. On May 27, 1994, the district court reopened Williams and consolidated it with King. Although the\nremaining Williams plaintiffs requested counsel on a number of occasions, counsel was not appointed for them\nuntil August 17, 1995. This delay, they contend, constituted an abuse of discretion and is reason for reversal.\nHere again the review threshold is high. This being a civil case, there is no constitutional right to counsel and the\nstatutory authority, 28 U.S.C. § 1915, is discretionary. See Cookish v. Cunningham, 787 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1986).\nMoreover, we may find reversible error only if \"exceptional circumstances were present such that a denial of\ncounsel was likely to result in fundamental unfairness impinging on [plaintiffs'] due process rights.\" DesRosiers v.\nMoran, 949 F.2d 15, 23 (1st Cir.1991).\nOur review of the evaluation of this complex and multi-faceted litigation during the fifteen months of delay reveals\ncourt actions which manifested a sensitivity to the interests of Williams plaintiffs and a total absence of\nrecognizable unfairness. The first stage during this period began on May 27, 1994, with the reopening of Williams\nand the court's denial of the Commonwealth's motion to modify the Original Decree. At this time the court, having\nrecently appointed counsel for a different group of patients intervening in King, the \"Class of 48 + 1,\" expressed\nthe hope that such counsel would \"look at the global picture.\" The court also indicated that it might look for\nanother person who would represent only the Williams plaintiffs. In December 1994, appointed counsel for the\n\"Class of 48 + 1\" plaintiffs informed a Williams party that he was not representing his interests. From this time,\ntherefore, until August 17, 1995, the Williams plaintiffs knew they were unrepresented.\nAny lack of representation during this period, however, was without any practical effect. As the district court\ndenied the Commonwealth's motion to modify at the hearing on May 27, 1994, the Williams plaintiffs suffered no\ndisadvantage at that time. We did not issue an opinion on the Commonwealth's appeal of that denial until April 6,\n1995. The appeal concentrated on the significance of the enactment of Chapter 489, and did not raise any \nWilliams issue. Our opinion, after holding that the statute had indeed constituted a significant change of law,\nmeeting Rufo's first prong, simply remanded the case to the district court to consider whether the second Rufo\nprong had been met. Again, there was no opportunity for harm to the Williams plaintiffs' interests in the appeal. In\nthe interim period between the denial of the motion to modify and our decision on the appeal, DOC submitted its\nManagement Plan for the Administration of the Treatment Center (Plan), views were exchanged between a\nSpecial Master and DOC, and settlement discussions took place. These discussions generally resulted in an\nimpasse. Moreover, during much of this time, the interests of all residents were identical, since the original motion\nto modify sought only a change in administrative control.\nIn May 1995, the court denied discovery, see supra, resolving to confine its efforts to a close scrutiny of the Plan\nitself. Thus, neither side was allowed to investigate or receive additional documentation on or deposition of the\nother. And although on November 11, 1994, the Commonwealth filed a renewed motion to modify, seeking a\nchange in the Supplemental Decree, no action was taken by the district court until June 29, 1995. At that time,\nthe district court granted the renewed motion, but it also stayed four important parts of the Plan, including the\nCommunity Access Plan (CAP), involving issues prominent in Williams. Six weeks later, on August 17,\n\n199500before any action was taken on the stayed provisions of the Plan, or on any other area concerning which\n97\nthe Williams plaintiffs had expressed concern00counsel was appointed.\n97\nOn this record, not only have counsel been unable to point to any prejudice stemming from the delay in\nappointing counsel for the Williams plaintiffs, but we see no possibility, as the case progressed through its various\n15 *15 stages, of any prejudice or \"fundamental unfairness.\" We are satisfied that their interests were adequately\nprotected by the appointment of counsel in August 1995.\nC. \"Suitable Tailoring\" of Modifications.\nThe second prong of Rufo requires that a consent decree be changed no more than necessary to resolve the\nproblems created by the change of circumstances. The proposed modifications must not defeat the core purpose\nof the consent decree nor, of course, create a constitutional violation. See Rufo, 502 U.S. at 391-92.\nSuperficially, one might say that the changed circumstance is simply the vesting of all authority over the Center in\nDOC and that the proposed modifications for the Original Decree merely parrot Chapter 489 by substituting DOC\nfor joint mention of DOC and DMH. Such a literal approach, however, obscures the reality that the Massachusetts\nlegislature, in vesting unitary control in DOC, was also recognizing that DOC's views of the policies best suited to\nbalance the two objectives of the Center 00 effective treatment of the sexually dangerous persons and the security\n97\nand safety of the patient/inmate and the population as a whole 00 differed from those which had guided DMH\n97\nduring much of the previous quarter of a century. Legislative emphasis on the goal of security and safety is\nevidenced by the addition of \"custody\" in the Chapter 489 amendment to the previous formulation of goals in\nMass. Gen. Laws. ch. 123A § 2 of \"care, treatment and rehabilitation.\" Accordingly, the change in control\ncontemplated change in operations and embraced the grant of some degree of flexibility and initiative to DOC.\nSimilarly, the proposed modifications cannot be limited to the simple change in authority, since, as we have just\nnoted, that change is inevitably overlaid with some expectation of change in some policies and practices. This\ndoes not mean that DOC has carte blanche to do anything it wishes, for the Original Decree remains unmodified\nin its requirement that \"patients at the Treatment Center should have the least restrictive conditions necessary to\nachieve the purposes of commitment.\"\nThis provision is the substantive essence of the Original Decree. The decree does not embrace all the policies\nand practices that have been relied on in the past by DMH to achieve effective treatment under the least\nrestrictive conditions. By the same token, as the district court realized, the \"proposed modifications\" are not the\nhost of provisions in the 138-page Plan, which simply sets forth ways in which DOC aspires to fulfill the\nrequirements of the Original Decree.\nThe task of conducting a \"suitable tailoring\" analysis therefore requires trying to determine if the basic thrust of\nthe new authority is likely to violate \"least restrictive conditions\" or constitutional requirements. While the\nCommonwealth has the burden to demonstrate \"suitable tailoring,\" we have also instructed the district court, as\nwe have noted, to give significant weight to the views of local officials and to rely \"primarily\" on continuing judicial\noversight to rectify violations. King I, 52 F.3d at 7. Accordingly, unless a demonstrably inadequate or erroneous\npolicy undercutting the Original Decree appears from an anticipatory scrutiny of the Plan, DOC should be allowed\nto proceed.\nThe district court had before it not only the Plan but two volumes of appendices, exhibits, and affidavits,\ncomments from the plaintiffs and the Special Master, and responses by DOC. The Plan has seven sections: (1)\nmanagement and staffing; (2) clinical treatment program; (3) educational and vocational treatment; (4) behavior\nmanagement; (5) resident management and operations; (6) CAP; and (7) integration of the Center with the prison\nprogram for sex offenders. The district court reviewed in some detail behavior management provisions\n(specifically, the Behavior Review Committee, the Minimum Privilege Unit, and Transfer Board policies), CAP,\nand resident management and operations (specifically, the restriction of privileges).\nThe court found that the Plan was \"a permissible and detailed proposal\" addressing both the increased emphasis\non security and treatment concerns. With respect to security, the court stated, \"security concerns in the Treatment\n\n16 Center have always been *16 viewed as legitimate.\" As to treatment, the court took note of the fact that treatment\nwas to be provided by JRI, which had been under contract with DMH since 1992, and that its employee, Dr.\nBarbara Schwartz, the Center's Treatment Director, affirmed that DOC would retain the clinical, educational,\nvocational and rehabilitation programs initiated by JRI. It therefore approved the proposed modifications,\nconcluding that the Plan \"appears to properly balance the competing goals of treatment and security and\nadequately protects the rights of the residents.\"\nThe court refused, however, to vacate the Decrees, as the Commonwealth requested, stating:\nWhile the Plan details the provision of treatment and the ability of DOC to address security\nconcerns, at bottom, the potential for conflict between these interests continues to exist. The\nconfusing and conflicting roles of DMH and DOC have been resolved. It is DOC's sole\nresponsibility to provide treatment in a secure setting. The Plan provides them with the rules to\naccomplish this. The Plan does not, and no plan can, provide the willingness and commitment in\ndoing so.\nThus recognizing that only future performance would administer the Plan in harmony with the essence of the\nDecrees, the court denied the motion to vacate without prejudice to review it for one year; following that period,\nduring which the court would monitor Plan implementation, it would reconsider the motion.\nOn appeal, appellants first level the general charge that DOC \"has essentially turned the Treatment Center into a\nprison and fundamentally altered the therapeutic community.\" It is, of course, true that the added emphasis on\nsecurity and safety, together with a new approach to behavior management, featuring definite sanctions for\ndefined unacceptable behavior, will inevitably effect some retreat from a more permissive atmosphere. But\nappellants' sweeping condemnation cannot stand without more precise identification of serious defects in the\nmany provisions regarding varieties of treatment, the extent of clinical supervision, and the safeguards of\nindividual rights.\nAppellants turn specifically to four areas. The first is CAP, where the participants have shrunk from fifty-six in\n1988 to two in 1997. They also criticize the application process that must be completed by an patient/inmate\nbefore being accepted for release into the community. Under the Plan, the patient/inmate must initiate his own\nprogram proposal, then must face review with the prospect that, if once denied acceptance, he must begin again\nafter a six month delay. Appellants also say that the Community Access Board should, under Youngberg v.\nRomeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982), be entirely composed of clinicians.\nThe Plan devotes some forty-four pages to CAP. This has obviously been a subject of intense rethinking. Under a\nchange in the statute, a resident is no longer eligible for participation if he is still serving a sentence; he must now\nhave completed serving any criminal sentence. The introductory section observes that the prior policies did not\nadequately emphasize public safety and states, \"Recent events and improvements in the understanding of both\nthe dynamics of sexual offenses and the realistic objectives for treatment, as well as legislative change to\nChapter 123A, have lead [sic] to the development of a revised program.\" The Plan adopts a cautious approach\nwhich recognizes that \"sexually dangerous persons\" will \"never cease to be `at risk.'\"\nAccordingly, whereas access to the community had earlier been approved prior to the designing of a program,\ncareful, even meticulous, planning must now precede approval of access. The process of plan review and\napproval is indeed a daunting, attenuated one. But we cannot at this juncture rule the new program out of\nbounds. In this most sensitive area of tension between safety and treatment, and between the individual and the\ncommunity, we cannot say that CAP is not the least restrictive feasible response.\nThe shrinkage in numbers of participants must be viewed against the background that a substantial number of\nresidents, many of whom are serving very lengthy sentences, simply refuse to participate in or apply to treatment\n17 programs. Moreover, a JRI analysis *17 reveals that in 1996, three of the ninety-one eligible residents of a total\npopulation of 202 submitted applications and proposed plans. As of January 1997, two remained in the program\nwhile twelve resided in the less restrictive Community Transition House in a \"pre-transition\" program. This does\nnot, in our opinion, point to any obvious constitutional failure. Further adjudication will have to await events.\n\nAs for the Youngberg argument that the entire Community Access Board should consist of clinicians, we refer to\nour discussion, infra, in relation to a similar criticism of decision making in the behavior management area.\nAnother area of specific criticism is the Transfer Board and its policies. The Transfer Board is a creation of\nChapter 489, enacting a new section 2A of Chapter 123, which provides that a resident who is serving under an\nunexpired criminal sentence may be transferred from the Center to a correctional institution. The factors that may\nbe considered are \"unamenability to treatment,\" \"unwillingness to follow treatment recommendations, lack of\nprogress in treatment, danger to other residents or staff, [and] security.\" Appellants say the policies fail to identify\ntreatment and the criteria for \"unamenability of treatment.\" They also contend that the Board is insufficiently\nclinical in composition, and that there are no criteria defining when a patient may be eligible for return to the\nCenter.\nWe preface our consideration of appellants' contentions by recalling the basic rationale that prompted the new\nstatutory provisions. As Dr. Schwartz explained in her affidavit, the earlier transfer provisions allowed transfer\nonly for threat of harm or escape. She observed that some residents refuse treatment; they \"cannot profit from\ntreatment simply because of the length of their underlying sentences.\" Instead of these residents occupying\nlimited places at the Center, it makes \"far more sense\" to allow \"new and motivated admissions.\"\nWe find adequate assurances of treatment. In the first place, the Plan indicates that in placing a resident, the\nclassification process will attempt to identify an institution where sex offender treatment is available. Additionally,\nthe statute itself states that DOC \"shall make available a program of voluntary treatment services.\" Finally, a\nmember of the Center's treatment team will be liaison to prison staff. As for vagueness of \"amenability\" and\n\"security,\" regulations have fleshed out the terms, the former being defined as failure to participate or make\nprogress in six months and the latter as consisting of danger of physical harm to others manifested through\nthreats or assaults.\nWith respect to appellants' claim that the criteria for return to the Center are undefined, we think that the Plan\nproperly addresses the need for criteria. It specifically contemplates the establishment of guidelines, stating, \"the\nTransfer Board will suggest minimum criteria for consideration of the resident's future return to the Treatment\nCenter.\" The provision charges those persons responsible for transferring inmates to the Center00and therefore\n97\nthose persons most knowledgeable about the risks and responsibilities accompanying the return of inmates\n00with determining how best to accommodate the needs of the inmates, the Center and DOC.\n97\nWe have also reviewed appellants' arguments that the transfer policies violated due process, double jeopardy\nand the ex post facto clause. The first claim is based on the assumption, which we have stated is unfounded, that\nsuitable treatment will not be available to any transferred resident. The last claims rest on the assumption that a\ntransferred resident will suffer a belated increase in his sentence. We find it unnecessary to elaborate on the\ndistrict court's opinion resolving these issues as we are satisfied with the judge's analysis and conclusion that, on\nthe record before him, there was no evidence of such increase.\nWith respect to clinical participation, the district court noted in its opinion that\nThe Commonwealth has agreed to modify the composition of the Board so that the Clinical\nDirector of Treatment, the Deputy Superintendent of Programs and the Director of Security will be\n18 equally represented.... In other words, the decision *18 will be made by a vote of the professionals\ncharged with the operation of the Treatment Center.\nAppellants continue to assert that the only \"professionals\" who could fulfill the requirement of Youngberg are\nmental health professionals. We discuss this issue in the following paragraphs involving behavior management.\nOur conclusion is equally applicable to the Community Access Board and the Transfer Board.\nAn appropriate place to start our analysis of the behavior management component of the Plan is to examine\nappellants' criticism of the manner of imposing sanctions. We note that this criticism is levied at the Original\nDecree and is to be distinguished from the substance, punishment and sequestration, which are proscribed by\nthe Supplemental Decree.\n\nThe controlling document, 103 MTC 430A, \"Observation of Behavior Reports,\" sets forth the Center's disciplinary\nsystem, including a \"clear set of rules\" and a \"clear set of sanctions.\" The monitoring and enforcing body is the\nBehavior Review Committee. Appointed by the Superintendent, it consists of one security staff member, one\nclinician and one JRI staff member. This committee deals with violations meriting such sanctions as warnings,\nand room, unit, work, and visitation restrictions. In addition, the Superintendent has the authority to impose\nsequestration awaiting hearing, investigation, prosecution or a transfer hearing in instances where the resident\nhas threatened, attempted, or inflicted serious harm on others.\nAppellants contend that such decisions violate the teaching of Youngberg that only qualified professionals should\nmake treatment decisions regarding involuntarily committed individuals. We begin by noting, as we did in \nCameron v. Tomes, 990 F.2d 14 (1993), that Youngberg was a \"cautiously phrased decision,\" directed to the right\nof a mentally retarded inmate to \"minimally adequate ... training to ensure safety and freedom from undue\nrestraint.\" Id. at 18 (citing Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 319, 102 S.Ct. 2452). Moreover, the Court in Youngberg gave a\nrather flexible, context-related definition of what it meant by \"professional\": \"a person competent, whether by\neducation, training or experience, to make the particular decision at issue.\" 457 U.S. at 323 n. 30, 102 S.Ct. 2452\n. It added the circumscribed caveat that \"[l]ong-term treatment decisions normally should be made by persons\nwith degrees in medicine or nursing, or with appropriate training in such areas as psychology....\" Id. Unlike in \nYoungberg, what is at issue here is not long term treatment decisions but short term disciplinary decisions. We\nlook in our analysis to the guidance we deliberately gave, in Cameron, for the future application of the concept of\nprofessionals and to the role of administrators:\nAny professional judgment that decides an issue involving conditions of confinement must\nembrace security and administration, and not merely medical judgments.... The administrators are\nresponsible to the state and to the public for making professional judgments of their own,\nencompassing institutional concerns as well as individual welfare.\n990 F.2d at 20.\nIn this case, the disciplinary system is responsive to both the \"treatment\" need of residents to learn accountability\nfor their actions and the administrative and security concerns of the institution. The composition of the Behavior\nReview Committee, with one DMH professional, and one security-minded member from DOC, and one JRI\nperson with overall treatment program responsibility seems well suited to the mix of concerns involved in\nsequestration decisions. Indeed, if mental health professionals were to control all decisions, certainty and\nregularity of sanction imposition would necessarily be swallowed up by ad hoc individualized decision making.\nWe know of no case authority that would declare the decision process in applying sanctions described in the Plan\nfacially constitutionally defective. We decline the invitation to extend Youngberg anticipatorily to this case.\nThe authority to sequester \"awaiting action\" wielded by the Superintendent implicates procedural concerns. The\n19 district court was sensitive to these concerns and required DOC to give the due process protections *19 of written\nnotice of reasons for placement and opportunity to respond required by Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 471, 103\nS.Ct. 864, 74 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983), in cases of administrative segregation. The court, in so doing, acknowledged\nthat its action stemmed from its recognition that residents, unlike the prison inmate in Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S.\n472, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995), were entitled to due process protections. Again, on this record we\nare not prepared to declare any breach of procedural due process.\nA final target of the criticism is in the area of resident management and operations. Appellants protest a number\nof privileges which have been truncated. These involve the amount of clothing allowed to be kept by a patient, the\namount of funds, and the number of room visits, telephone calls, stamps, credit cards, etc. The Plan justifies\nsome reduction in these privileges because of past experiences with security, assault, gambling, coercion, and\ninterruptions in treatment. No reduction rises to the level of a constitutional infraction.\nWhen all the smoke has cleared, the legislatively ordered change in command and the directions which it\nproposes to take do not exceed the reasonable latitude implicit in the legislative change of command. Nor does\neither appear likely to undermine the Original Decree or to violate the Constitution.\n\nII. The Supplemental Decree.\nA. Modification.\nWhile modification of the Original Decree involved mainly a change from dual control to exclusive DOC\nmanagement of the Center, the Supplemental Decree and any modifications proposed were substantive. The\nSupplemental Decree barred solitary confinement for punishment, \"disciplinary and punitive procedures having\nno place in the care and treatment of civilly committed patients.\" The requested modifications would strike the\ngeneral proscription of disciplinary and punishment procedures and link solitary confinement to the offense\nunderlying the original commitment of the individual.\nIn King II, we were not persuaded that the mere change in control implicated this substantive change. We\ntherefore remanded the question of justification for modification and left it to the district court to decide whether\nfurther factual development or opinion evidence was needed. The court decided that it did not require an\nevidentiary hearing and scheduled a prompt submission of briefs and a hearing for presentation of views.\nAppellants submitted several affidavits, and appellees rested on the record. The court ruled that a significant\nchange in fact had occurred, based on examination of the Plan and monthly DOC reports which verified DOC's\nadherence to the Plan, a visit to the Center with counsel, discussion with the residents at the Center, and review\nof opinions of the qualified professional in charge of the administration of the Plan, Dr. Schwartz. The court also\nstated that the dramatically changed conditions of segregation that had taken place since 1972 constituted a\nrelevant added factual development.\nWe agree with the district court but would add another factual development called for by our scrutiny of the\nrecord, namely, a significant change in the philosophical approach to treatment of civilly committed sex offenders\nin programs operated by correctional departments. We do not mean that there has been a complete reversal of\nposition under all circumstances from the earlier, more permissive mental health approach to the more restrictive\nbehavior control approach. But the monolithic acceptance of the mental health approach that existed a quarter of\na century ago has yielded to the acknowledgment that there is no royal road to treatment and cure. Behavioral\ncontrol programs including defined offenses and sanctions are now featured in institutions operated by\ncorrections personnel.\nWe begin with the 1989 report of the Governor's Special Advisory Panel on Forensic Mental Health, which\npreceded the passage in 1994 of Chapter 489. We do not rely on opinions expressed by that Panel, but on some\nfactual statements which have never been impugned. Indicative of some kind of sea change is that most of the\n20 thirty-one states that had \"special dispositional provisions\" *20 for sex offenders, i.e., indefinite commitments as\nin Massachusetts, repealed or significantly reformed the statutes. Repeal was recommended by the American\nBar Association in its 1984 proposed Criminal Justice Mental Health Standards on the ground that, inter alia, the\nassumption that mental disability underlay sexual offenses in general was no longer viewed as clinically valid. A\n1977 report of the American Psychiatry Association to the same effect was cited.\nDr. Roger Smith, the impressively credentialed Director of Michigan's Bureau of Forensic Mental Health,\nnarrowed the focus to programs run by correctional personnel. In 1994, he evaluated the Massachusetts DOC\nPlan. In an affidavit, he made the point that in institutions where civilly committed residents and corrections\ninmates are lodged and treated, \"[E]very attempt must be made to apply program rules, and sanctions for\nviolation of such rules, in a uniform and fair manner, and to avoid the perception (or reality) that civilly committed\nresidents have privileges and rights which exceed those of their DOC peers.\" In states that have opted to treat\nsex offenders only in the months prior to parole release, he added, programs generally are provided in minimum\nsecurity settings. As for DOC's Plan, \"[t]he establishment of clear rules and sanctions for rule violations by\nresidents is clearly long overdue, and essential to effective management of the therapeutic program.\" He also\nfound the restrictions on residents' privileges, such as visits and mail, to be \"consistent with standards found in\ncorrectional treatment programs nationwide.\"\n\nTo this we add the unrebutted factual assertions of Dr. Schwartz, who is a JRI employee and the Clinical Director\nof the Center. Having trained staff from most of the prison-based sex offender treatment programs, she made the\nunqualified statement: \"Every sex offender program in the country which is operated by a corrections department\nadheres to the disciplinary policy of the institution.\"\nThese affidavits were filed with the court in November 1994. Only after remand did appellants seek to counter\nsuch statements in any way. In 1997, appellants filed affidavits of clinical directors of treatment programs in\nKansas and Washington. These programs were run by a department of Social and Rehabilitation Services or of\nSocial and Health Services and were available only to persons soon to finish serving their sentences or without\ncriminal sentences, whose release depended solely on their ability to control their conduct. It is understandable\nthat in Kansas sequestration for a period in excess of fifty-nine minutes was rare, and that in Washington there\nhad been only one occasion in thirteen months to keep an inmate in a \"quiet room\" for up to four hours. Clearly,\nthe populations and the problems were quite different from those in the Center. Appellants also submitted a draft\nof a proposed patients' handbook from Wisconsin, but although some twenty-two definitions of \"major\nmisconduct\" were set forth, the Appendix we were furnished did not contain standards for either incapacitation\nmeasures or deterrent sanctions. The program, unlike that we consider here, was confined to those who were\nonly civilly committed. We view appellants' submissions concerning other states' civil-commitments-only\nprograms as essentially comparing oranges to appellees' apples.\nFinally, appellants attempt to demonstrate that there has been no change in basic treatment philosophy by\nsubmitting a 1972 policy statement by Dr. Harry Kozol, then Director of the Center, who did not attribute his policy\neschewing punishment to a mental illness theory but rather to a view of self-discipline and personal accountability\nas focal patient goals. Any similarity with the present treatment philosophy stops at this point. For Dr. Kozol went\non to describe the process of enforcing accountability: when a patient was found to have engaged in \"antisocial\nand inappropriate behavior,\" a clinical study would be made of steps needed to be taken, which could include, not\nsegregation, but \"exclusion from the population and placement in the Special Intensive Treatment Unit.\" This\nwas, he stated, not looked upon as \"lock-up\" but, \"[i]n operation, this program has excluded patients from the\ngeneral population for considerably longer periods than patients ... were excluded in lock-up by the correctional\n21 authority here.\" *21 We think it clear that this system 00 lacking definitions of \"antisocial and inappropriate\n97\nbehavior,\" and with sanctions that vary according to the clinical analysis, indeterminate sequestration, and\nrelease that depends on \"our clinical judgment that the risk of his acting offensively and inappropriately is\nreduced to a reasonable or substantial [sic] level\" 00 differs significantly from the Plan's approach.\n97\nThe factual assertions of the Special Advisory Panel and Dr. Schwartz, together with the observations of\nMichigan's Dr. Smith, lead us to accept as a significant change of fact the adoption of a new treatment approach\nto sex offender treatment programs conducted by corrections departments. Our survey of this record also\nconvinces us that the court did not err in not delaying its consideration pending further discovery. Appellants'\nrequest in their Joint Submission Concerning Supplemental Decree was couched in the alternative. In the event\nthat the court did not deny the motion to modify the Supplemental Decree, they wished discovery, citing as their\nonly objective, \"the deposition of defendants' witnesses.\" What we said in connection with the refusal to extend\ndiscovery relating to the Original Decree applies here. We see little fruitful prospect in such proceedings; the\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in refusing such a request.\nThe district court suitably relied on the Plan, its visit to the Center, its talks with residents who did not complain\nabout discipline, punishment, or conditions in the Minimum Privilege Unit, and on the opinion of Dr. Schwartz who\naverred, \"I consider the institution of a disciplinary policy containing clearly defined offenses carrying definitive\nsanctions as an essential part of a state-of-the-art treatment program.\" The court added that since punishment\nwas clearly contemplated, \"it follows that appropriate punishment may include sequestration of some kind.\" This\nlast proposition may not be self evident. We therefore elaborate.\nA reading of the Code of Offenses and list of sanctions suggests to us the essentiality of sequestration to this\nPlan. There are fifty-nine offenses divided among four categories. There are eleven offenses described in the\ncategory of the greatest severity, such as killing, rape, arson, and taking hostages. In the high category are\nseventeen offenses, including assault, bringing in illegal drugs, demanding protection money, and counterfeiting.\nThe nineteen offenses in the moderate category include refusing a direct order, lying to a staff member, and\n\nthreatening another person. The low category consists of twelve offenses, ranging from use of obscene language\nand unexcused absences, to failure to follow safety regulations.\nIn like manner, the sanctions vary both according to category and to whether the offense is accompanied by\nmitigating or aggravating circumstances 00 or neither. The most severe sanction is placement in the Minimum\n97\nPrivilege Unit for thirty days for a severe offense accompanied by aggravating circumstances. Other sanctions\navailable for severe offenses include loss of privileges from sixty to eighty days, restitution, forfeiture of good\ntime, restitution, and loss of job. The maximum sanction for a high offense, with aggravating circumstances, is\nplacement in the Minimum Privilege Unit for five days with a lesser alternative being room restriction for ten days,\nand, like a severe offense, restitution, loss of privileges, good time, and job.\nIt is obvious that, if placement in the Minimum Privilege Unit were not available as a sanction, the range of\nsanctions would be so telescoped and compressed that a resident could not expect much more severe treatment\nfor a high or severe offense than for a moderate offense. For example, a resident who had taken hostages might\nlose some privileges for eighty days while a resident who refused an order might lose some privileges for five\ndays. The disparity between offenses far exceeds the disparity in sanctions that could be imposed. We therefore\nalso conclude that sequestration is an integral part of the Plan's system of graduated and defined offenses and\nsanctions.\nFinally, we cannot fault the court for relying on the \"vastly different\" conditions of confinement in the Minimum\n22 Privilege Unit today compared to those described in the King complaint. King, placed in solitary *22 confinement\nwithout procedural safeguards for calling a guard a \"dingbat,\" was placed in a six by nine foot cell, without a sink,\nonly a portable chamber pot, no facilities for drinking water, no reading or writing materials, no visits00not even\n97\nfrom his parents00no radio or exercise ... and filthy walls and floor.\n97\nThe Minimum Privilege Unit, on the other hand, is a new building constructed in 1986, with rooms eight by\nsixteen feet, with toilet and sink. Residents are allowed access to telephone, visitors, exercise periods, daily\nshowers, canteen, and library. The regulations, 103 MTC 423.07, provide that residents in the Minimum Privilege\nUnit will be accorded treatment by their regular treatment team, unless some modification is dictated by safety\nand security. Additional or supplemental treatment \"will be provided as necessary.\"\nWe are fully satisfied that this combination of a difference in basic approaches, a detailed Plan maintaining\ntreatment standards accompanied by a detailed disciplinary system, and dramatic changes in conditions of\nconfinement amounts to the significant change in facts required by Rufo.\nAs for the second prong, \"suitable tailoring,\" there is little need for lengthy discussion. The Plan preserves clinical\ntreatment programs and procedural safeguards. Its departures from the Supplemental Decree, inaugurating a\ndisciplinary system and outlining procedures for charging, deciding, and reviewing infractions seem well within\nreasonable requirements. The major area of difference, the Plan's provision for sequestration, reveals a\nrestrained resort to this sanction. Placement in the Minimum Privilege Unit is allowed under only four\ncircumstances: commission of a severe offense with aggravating circumstances (up to thirty days); a severe\noffense without either aggravating or mitigating circumstances (up to twenty days); a severe offense under\nmitigating circumstances (up to ten days); and a high offense under aggravating circumstances (up to five days).\nThe only other kind of confinement is restriction to one's room, which can be imposed for ordinary and\naggravated high offenses for seven and ten days, and for an aggravated moderate offense for five days.\nGiven the legitimacy of a disciplinary system in a treatment program under the auspices of a department of\ncorrection, such utilization of sequestration fulfills the requirement of being suitably tailored to the change of\ncircumstances. We find that modification of the Supplemental Decree is therefore justified.\n* * *\nWe note only briefly an issue that our decision has mooted 00 whether or not the district court erred in vacating\n97\nseveral orders of Judge Young. These orders all dealt with participation of psychologists or psychiatrists in\nvarious kinds of decision and policy making in the use of sequestration. Our holding that the proposed\n\nmodifications in the Supplemental Decree as illustrated by the Plan are both based on significant changes in fact\nand are tailored to those changes leaves no room for the continued survival of Judge Young's orders, which\nserved as interim measures pending a long-term resolution.\nWe have considered the other arguments advanced by appellants, intervenor plaintiffs, and amicus and deem\nthem either to raise issues not presented to the district court or otherwise without merit.\nAt this point we can only say that court and counsel have done their jobs well in what must be one of the most\ncomplex and vexing areas of law and administration. What we have said in upholding modifications of the\nDecrees concerning DOC's Plan should not be construed as rulings foreclosing issues arising out of Plan\nadministration in the future. What we have done is to survey the new regime, its general approach, and to give a\ngreen light. That does not mean that reckless driving will be immune from review. We rely on the district court,\nwhich has commendably shown its readiness to exercise its oversight powers.\nAffirmed.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

      "text": "1993 WL 818811 Page 1of 2\nFOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY \nNot Reported in N.E.2d, 1993 WL 818811 (Mass.Super.) \nOnly the Westlaw citation is currently available. \n \nSuperior Court of Massachusetts. \nJohn BRUDER \nv. \nCOMMISSIONER of Mental Health \nNo. 9205277. \nMarch 31, 1993. \n \n \nLENK. \nDECISION ON RESPONDENT'S OPPOSITION TO PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS AND \nOPPOSITION TO MOTION TO VACATE COMMITMENT TO TREATMENT CENTER \n*1 Petitioner John Bruder filed a petition pursuant to G.L. c. 248, § 1, et seq. seeking his immediate \nrelease from the Massachusetts Treatment Center for the Sexually Dangerous to which he is and has \nbeen committed under G.L. c. 123A, since July 1983. As reasons therefore, Bruder asserts that he is \nbeing subjected to punitive confinement, that he is not receiving any treatment nor being held in the \nleast restrictive available conditions and that a petition for discharge filed by Bruder under c. 123A § \n9 three years prior to the instant petition was not reached for hearing. \nSubsequently, Bruder filed a Motion to Vacate Commitment From Unlawful and Unconstitutional \nRestraint claiming violation of his constitutional right to equal protection of the laws in light of the \nalleged creation, without rational basis, of two classes of sexually dangerous persons in the wake of \nthe repeal in September 1990 of G.L. c. 123A, § 3. \nThe Respondent Commissioner of Mental Health opposed Bruder's petition for writ of habeas corpus, \narguing that it should be dismissed because: (a) Bruder's claims are barred by the doctrine of res \njudicata; (b) this court lacks authority to release Bruder pursuant to a civil habeas corpus petition, \nand (c) Bruder is not entitled to an annual review of his petition for discharge under G.L. c. 123A, § 9. \nThe Respondent also opposed Bruder's Motion to Vacate Commitment, arguing that it should be \ndismissed because: (a) Bruder's only avenue of release from the Treatment Center is pursuant to G.L. \nc. 123A, § 9 and (b) Bruder has not demonstrated a violation of his equal protection rights. The \nRespondent's Oppositions are, as counsel acknowledge, each in the nature of a motion to dismiss \nunder M.R.C.P. 12(b)(6) and shall be treated as such. Both parties agreed to waive oral argument on \nsaid motions and to submit this matter for decision on the papers filed with the court. \nMotions to dismiss for failure to state a claim test the legal sufficiency of a complaint or, here, \npetition. For the purposes of determining such a motion, the facts alleged in the petition are to be \ntaken as true, as are such inferences as may be drawn from the petition in Petitioner's favor. \nDismissal at the pleadings state is disfavored unless it is clear that no provable set of facts would \nentitle Petitioner to relief. See 6 Mass.Rules (Smith and Zobel) § 12.12. Applying this standard, \nRespondent's motions to dismiss must be denied. \nRespondent contends that the doctrine of res judicata requires the dismissal of Bruder's claims \nbecause Bruder was a named plaintiff in Langton v. Johnson, 928 F.2d 1206 (1st Cir.1991), involving \nidentical parties and allegedly identical causes of action. To the extent that Bruder asserts claims \narising from events which postdated the Langton trial, however, it cannot be said at this juncture that \nsuch claims are identical to those previously litigated. Indeed, the First Circuit noted that the District \nCourt had concluded \"that the range of treatments presently offered satisfied the requirements of the \nconsent decrees ...\" Langton, 928 F.2d at 1216. (Emphasis supplied.) Plaintiff alleges inter alia that \ntreatment previously offered at the time of trial has been eliminated. Hence, dismissal of such claims \non the basis of the doctrine of res judicata is unwarranted. \n*2 Respondent contends also that Bruder's only avenue of release from the Treatment Center is via \nG.L. c. 123A, § 9 and that this petition must thus be dismissed. However, the Supreme Judicial Court \nhas recently made plain that habeas corpus, and not the G.L. c. 123A, § 9 process, is the correct \navenue to challenge conditions of confinement at the Treatment Center. Petition of Gagnon, 416 \nMass. 775, 778-79 (1994). \nFinally, it is not clear to the court at this stage that there is no set of facts which plaintiff would be \nable to prove which would entitle him to relief on the claims he has asserted, including the due \nprocess and equal protection claims. \nhttp://web2.westlaw.com/result/documenttext.aspx?sv=Split&service=Find&docsample=F... 7/18/2006\n\n1993 WL 818811 Page 2of 2\nHence, Respondent's Oppositions, construed as motions to dismiss, are denied and this matter should \nproceed, as appropriate, for discovery and trial. \nMass.Super.,1993. \nBruder v.

The defendants are all state officials, including the Secretary of Human Services, the Commissioner\nand Assistant Commissioner of the Department of Mental Health (DMH), the Commissioner of the Department of\nCorrections (DOC), and the superintendent of the Bridgewater State Prison. Three Treatment Center officials, Ian\nTink, Dennis McNamara, and Michael Stevens, are also named defendants. The plaintiffs appeal from the district\ncourt's refusal to hold defendants in contempt of certain preexisting decrees and from the court's denial of\n[1]\nequitable redress. Additionally, both sides challenge the court's order regarding attorneys' fees.\nHaving followed the threads of the parties' variegated arguments through the cumbersome record, we affirm the\ndistrict court's judgment on the merits but vacate the fee award.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIn 1987, appellants filed an amended complaint in the United States District Court for the District of\nMassachusetts claiming that defendants had violated two prior consent decrees and the federal Constitution.\nCharging an institutional failure to provide adequately for the plaintiff class, appellants sought the appointment of\na receiver or a wholesale release of inmates (some to be discharged into society and the rest transferred to state\nprison, depending on their individual circumstances). The district court consolidated plaintiffs' case with an earlier\ncomplex of cases challenging the Treatment Center's sequestration procedure and practices. See generally \nPearson v. Fair, 808 F.2d 163 (1st Cir.1986) (per curiam) (describing Pearson litigation); King v. Greenblatt, 489\nF.Supp. 105 (D.Mass.1980). The cases were tried sequentially before Judge Mazzone in the spring of 1989 and\n\nwere resolved in a single opinion. In a later opinion, Judge Mazzone awarded partial attorneys' fees to the\nplaintiffs. Neither rescript has been published.\nAppeals were taken in all cases. We consolidated the matters for oral argument. Unlike the court below, however,\nwe prefer to write separately about each set of appeals. This opinion will focus on the so-called Bruder appeals,\nthe titles of which are delineated in the caption. The Bruder appeals primarily involve adequacy of treatment and\nmatters ancillary thereto. We will address the so-called Pearson appeals, which deal principally with\nsequestration issues, in a later opinion.\n1209  II. THE ANATOMY OF THE TREATMENT CENTER\n*1209\nIn an effort to bring perspective to the mass of issues, we believe it helpful to sketch an overview of the\nTreatment Center and its purposes.\nA. The Statutory Framework for Commitment.\nUnder Massachusetts law, a sexually dangerous person (SDP) is\nany person whose misconduct in sexual matters indicates a general lack of power to control his\nsexual impulses, as evidenced by repetitive or compulsive sexual misconduct by either violence\nagainst any victim, or aggression against any victim under the age of sixteen years, and who, as a\nresult, is likely to attack or otherwise inflict injury on such victims because of his uncontrolled or\nuncontrollable desires.\nMass.Gen.L. ch. 123A, § 1 (1986). The DMH is directed to establish and maintain a facility for the \"care, custody,\ntreatment and rehabilitation\" of such persons. Id. at § 2. A proceeding to determine whether an individual should\nbe committed as sexually dangerous can be initiated in any of three ways: upon motion of the state trial court or\ncommonwealth (following conviction for some specified sexual offense), id. at § 4; at the request of the head of a\ncorrectional facility (following sexually assaultive behavior on an inmate's part while in custody), id. at § 6; or\n[2]\nupon voluntary application, id. at § 7.\n[3]\nAlthough the preliminary steps differ with respect to different classes of involuntary initiates,  the adjudicative\nprocesses for determining SDP status are largely the same. First, the individual is committed to the Treatment\nCenter for a period of up to sixty days and examined by two qualified specialists. Id. at §§ 4, 6. During this period,\nthe examiners submit a report and recommend a disposition. Id. If the report does not \"clearly indicate\" sexual\ndangerousness, no further proceedings are conducted and the individual is not sent to the Treatment Center. See\nid. at §§ 5, 6. If, however, the report \"clearly indicates\" that the individual is an SDP, the matter goes before the\nstate superior court. Id. at § 5. If the court concludes, after a hearing, that the commonwealth has carried the\nburden of proving sexual dangerousness beyond a reasonable doubt, see Commonwealth v. Walsh, 376 Mass.\n53, 55, 378 N.E.2d 1378 (1978) (discussing burden of proof), it can then \"commit such person to the center ... for\nan indeterminate period of a minimum of one day and a maximum of such person's natural life.\" Mass.Gen.L. ch.\n123A, § 5. Whichever route is followed, the Treatment Center has no authority to reject placements. It is similarly\nwithout authority to expel patients who obstruct, ignore, or resist available treatment, or to remit such patients to\nany other facility.\nBefore 1986, chapter 123A did not allow the superior court to sentence a defendant and commit him to the\n1210 Treatment Center. Rather, the court had to impose the commitment in lieu of sentencing. Hence, if *1210 the\nreferral stemmed from a criminal conviction, the commitment would become, in effect, a part of the individual's\nsentence. If the referral originated in the course of an individual's imprisonment, or after 1986, the criminal\nsentence would run concurrently with the individual's confinement at the Treatment Center. See Mass.Gen.L. ch.\n[4]\n123A, § 5.\nOnce committed, a patient remains at the Treatment Center until the superior court determines that he is no\nlonger an SDP. Mass.Gen.L. ch. 123A, § 9 (Supp.1990). A patient may file a petition for release once a year,\n\nalthough the DMH may file such a petition at any time. Id. The commonwealth receives, and often uses at judicial\nhearings, reports issued by the Restrictive Integration Review Board (RIRB). The RIRB is composed of three\nTreatment Center staffers and three outside clinicians. Its primary duty is to evaluate, no less than annually, each\npatient committed to the Treatment Center in order to determine the progress of therapy and the advisability of\npermitting him to reenter the outside community on a limited basis. See id. at § 8.\nAt a release hearing, the commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the patient is still sexually\ndangerous. Walsh, 376 Mass. at 55, 378 N.E.2d 1378. If the commonwealth does not carry the devoir of\npersuasion, the petitioner, depending on the status of his original conviction, is either released unconditionally or\ntransferred to DOC custody. See Mass.Gen.L. ch. 123A, § 9.\nB. The Patient Population.\nThe Treatment Center population consists exclusively of involuntarily committed males. Every inmate has been\nconvicted of a sexual offense identified by Massachusetts law as indicative of compulsive sexual behavior. The\ntypical accrued duration of stay is around ten years. Approximately 50% of the patients were committed following\nconvictions for child molestation and the remainder were committed after being convicted of rape. In March 1989,\nthere were 286 patients in custody. Their ages ranged from 20 to 78. The class in this case comprises 264\nindefinitely committed patients (a figure which excludes the 22 persons who were being held for temporary\nobservation).\nThe class is divided into two subclasses: those who do, and do not, labor under the added weight of unexpired\ncriminal sentences. The first subclass, numbering 191 men, can be further divided: 75 of the members were\nparole-eligible at time of trial while the remaining 116 were not. As to those persons who were sentenced before\narriving at the Treatment Center, 30 were serving life sentences. The average length of sentence referable to the\nnon-lifers is about 15 years. The second subclass, 73 in number, can also be divided along a more sharply\ndefined axis: 27 men were never sentenced because their convictions and commitments occurred prior to 1986,\nwhereas the other 46 were originally given criminal sentences which expired before March of 1989.\nIII. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nFor purposes of our preliminary discussion, we examine the record from two perspectives. The gravamen of the\nplaintiffs' claims is the defendants' alleged noncompliance with the dictates of the decrees previously entered in\nthe so-called Williams cases. We limn these agreements and succinctly summarize the litigation that produced\nthem. We then turn to the present litigation.\nA. The Earlier Litigation.\nIn November 1972, patients at the Treatment Center filed a federal court complaint alleging that living conditions\nand programs were \"substantially inferior to those existing at correctional institutions of the Commonwealth.\" The\n1211 complaint charged that the dearth of psychiatric treatment, work opportunities, job training programs, *1211 and\neducational facilities violated the fifth, eighth, and fourteenth amendments to the federal Constitution.\nThe case was assigned to Judge Wyzanski, now deceased. Two consent decrees resulted. We have set out the\nrelevant portions of each decree in an appendix. The first, entered in June 1974, provided in substance that\nstewardship of the Treatment Center would be vested in DMH rather than DOC; that a graduated system would\nbe developed to ensure that patients were subjected to the \"least restrictive conditions necessary\" to achieve full\nrecovery; that vocational and other programs would be implemented; and that rules and regulations governing\nthe daily operation of the Treatment Center would be promulgated. In due course, regulations were prepared. \nSee 104 C.M.R. § 8.00 et seq. (1988). The provision governing administration of treatment capsulates the\nimperatives of the 1974 decree in the following way:\n\nEvery patient shall be offered treatment designed to effect his early return to public society. Such\ntreatment shall consist of medical, psychiatric, educational, vocational, rehabilitative, and social\nservices commensurate with the patient's age, background, abilities, and physical and mental\ncondition. Such treatment shall be administered skillfully, safely and humanely, with respect for the\npatient's dignity and personal integrity, and in the least restrictive conditions which are consistent\nwith his security needs.\nId. at § 8.03(3).\nThe second consent decree, entered in January 1975, ordered the defendants to submit a plan describing the\ntherapeutic, educational, vocational, and avocational programs to be offered at the Treatment Center. It also\nordered the commonwealth to develop a short-term release program whereby patients would be allowed to\npartake in outside activities. Shortly after this decree was entered, the case was transferred to Judge Garrity, who\noversaw the litigation with skill and diligence for the next five years. During this period, he entered a decree which\nprovided that the Treatment Center would move into a new facility to be constructed at the Bridgewater\ncorrectional complex. Some two years later, in 1978, Judge Garrity ordered the defendants to promulgate\n[5]\nregulations for a furlough program.\nIn a routine reshuffling of the docket, the case was transferred to Judge McNaught in 1979. It remained under his\ncareful supervision until its completion. None of the orders issued by Judge McNaught have any real bearing on\nthe interpretation to be accorded the consent decrees here at issue. We say this despite our awareness that the\nparties dispute when the original case was formally closed: appellants argue that it ended in September 1986\nwhile appellees place the time of termination in late 1989. We decline to enter this Serbonian bog, believing the\ndate of closure to be immaterial for our purposes.\nB. The Present Litigation.\nIn April 1986, six patients filed a pro se complaint which outlined a golconda of alleged constitutional violations.\nThe plaintiffs' core theses were that (1) no adequate treatment was being provided, and (2) the Treatment Center\nwas being run, impermissibly, as a correctional facility rather than as a mental health institution. The case was\ndrawn by Judge Young. After counsel were appointed to represent them, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary\ninjunction and designation of a special master. They sought, among other things, to restrain defendants from\nconditioning maximum privileges on a patient's consent to \"double-bunking,\" i.e., sharing a cell with another\npatient. The plaintiffs also asked that the court order the commonwealth to fill all clinical staff vacancies, develop\n1212 an individual treatment plan for each patient, *1212 abolish the movement control pass procedure, and scrap the\npackage restriction policy.\nIn June 1987, Judge Young denied this motion for the most part. As to one plaintiff, John Bruder, unique among\nthe five plaintiffs in that his criminal sentence had expired, the court concluded that some interim relief was\nmerited; since Bruder would be free but for his commitment to the Treatment Center, he was entitled to all\navailable treatment whether or not he consented to double-bunking. Accordingly, the court enjoined defendants\nfrom denying Bruder \"any treatment available to individuals at the Bridgewater Treatment Center who are double\nbunked.\"\nIn due season, the plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint and certify a class. Both motions were granted. The\namended complaint alleged that defendants had utterly failed to (1) provide treatment sufficient to bring about the\npatients' recovery; (2) administer the treatment actually furnished in the least restrictive manner consistent with\nsecurity needs; and (3) operate the Treatment Center as a mental health facility rather than as a penal institution.\nThe amended complaint averred that, because patients were not receiving proper treatment, they could not be\nrehabilitated; thus, a person's commitment to the Treatment Center had become tantamount to a life sentence\nwithout prospect of parole. Proceeding on this theory, plaintiffs asserted that, from 1986 onward, the\ncommonwealth had run roughshod over both the Constitution and the Williams decrees. The defendants denied\nthe allegations.\n\nBefore too long, Judge Young was asked to recuse himself pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 455(a). He did so. The case,\nalong with the Pearson litigation, was reassigned to Judge Mazzone. Trial ensued. See supra Part I.\nIV. THE FINDINGS AT TRIAL\nThe lower court concluded that plaintiffs failed to maintain their burden of showing that defendants' conduct was\neither constitutionally deficient or contemptuous. The court based its conclusions on an extensive, well-\nelaborated factual panoply. We set forth below a compressed account of the trial court's integral findings.\nA. In General.\nPrior to negotiation of the consent decrees, conditions at the Treatment Center were medieval 00 worse than\n97\nthose obtaining in the prison system. Patients resided in cramped, poorly furnished cells. They used buckets as\ntoilets (being allowed to dump the buckets periodically into a central depository). The water supply came directly\nfrom the Taunton River and was untreated. The shower facility was located opposite the housing unit, across an\noutdoor courtyard; patients had to walk outside to reach the showers, even during the dead of winter.\nThe Center's rehabilitative effort was in a similar state of disrepair. There was no library. There were no\neducational programs. The vocational facilities were obsolete. There was no furlough or work-release program of\nany kind. The Center had neither a gymnasium nor any outdoor recreational areas. DMH's role in running the\nfacility was limited to providing diagnostic procedures, testifying at section 123A proceedings, and conducting a\nfew psychotherapy programs. There were no nurses on staff. Correctional officers dispensed medication.\nThe consent decrees heralded a fresh start. In due course, a totally new facility was constructed. It opened in\n1986. The district court found enormous improvements in the general conditions of confinement from that time\nforward. After touring the Treatment Center, Judge Mazzone wrote:\nPatients now live in humanly scaled housing units of twenty-four or thirty rooms, with a large multi-\nleveled common area. Depending on the unit's privilege status, washing machines and kitchen\nfacilities may be located in the common area. All individual rooms are well-lit and nicely furnished.\n1213 Unlike their predecessors, they are equipped with modern toilets and sinks, and ... a shower \n*1213 room is located off the common area within each housing unit.\nThe court found these renovations to be of \"inestimable value\" in ameliorating the attitude and demeanor of both\npatients and staff. The modern setting offered a safe and comfortable place to provide care and custody, thereby\nfacilitating treatment. The court acknowledged, of course, that these physical improvements, while important,\nwere not sufficient in themselves to satisfy the dictates of the consent decrees. Therefore, Judge Mazzone\nproceeded to ask, and answer, two discrete questions: (1) Was the treatment provided in the new setting\n\"adequate\" in light of clinical needs and the indefiniteness of the patients' commitment? (2) Did a correctional\nphilosophy so dominate operations as to impede development of an effective therapeutic regime? We describe\nthe court's responses to these questions in the sections that follow.\nB. Adequacy of Treatment.\n[6]\nThe district court organized its adequacy-of-treatment findings along five separate strata.  In synthesizing the\nfindings, we follow the same mode.\n1. Education; Special Needs. The reading proficiency of 75% of the patient population is below the eighth grade\nlevel; only 67 patients (less than 25% of the population) have high school diplomas or the equivalent. Beginning\nin August 1986, the Treatment Center budgeted for an instructor to lead a special education curriculum. Despite\nthe obvious need for such a program, the position went unfilled for at least a year. In August 1987, Tink, the\nadministrator of the Treatment Center, felt compelled to write to DMH's Assistant Commissioner seeking\nadditional funding to enable the Center to fill staff vacancies in educational, and other, programs.\n\nRecognizing this slow start, the court nonetheless found that defendants were on their way toward implementing\na comprehensive educational system. At time of trial, a learning center was up and running and a specialized\ntreatment program was in place for patients with modest intellectual skills. As of mid-March 1989, 102 patients\nwere participating in various special needs/educational programs. Over half of them were enrolled in two or more\ncourses; 34 were receiving classroom instruction for five periods a day, five days a week.\nEducational opportunities were also being provided on a more generalized plane. Above and beyond those\ninvolved in special needs programming, 105 patients were partaking of other educational endeavors. Thirty-one\nwere attending college-level courses taught by visiting faculty from Massasoit Community College and\nBridgewater State College. Twelve were enrolled in a special computer course. Six were taking high school\nequivalency (G.E.D.) courses (an enrollment which, at trial, defendants acknowledged could, and should, be\nexpanded). Classes were also offered in bibliognostic skills, graphic arts, crafts, and other disciplines.\nThe Treatment Center library, headed by a certified librarian, was fully operational, containing over 12,000\npermanent volumes. The inventory included a current and comprehensive law library. Additional materials were\navailable on revolving loan through a standing agreement with the Bridgewater Public Library. In the month prior\nto trial, a daily average of 89 patients visited the library; during that month, 233 different patients borrowed a total\nof 546 books.\nIn the last analysis, the court, although concerned about staffing shortages and the tiny enrollment in the G.E.D./\npre-G.E.D. courses, found the overall improvement in the quantity, quality, and availability of educational\nprograms to be \"impressive.\"\n2. Vocational and Avocational Programs. The Treatment Center's vocational and avocational workshops also\n1214 moved with near glacial slowness after construction *1214 was completed. While an avocational/occupational\ntherapy (AVO/OT) area was built as part of the new complex, it remained largely unused for three years due to\ninsufficient staffing. Tink, in his 1987 letter to DMH, wrote that \"my vocational training component really includes\nonly two [full-time equivalent staff members].... Particularly because of inadequate staffing, I continue to be\nunable to open the AVO/OT program areas....\"\nThe glacier did not really begin to thaw for over two years. By March 1989, 195 patients had enlisted in vocational\nor avocational programs. Various levels of permanent work status were available. A large majority of the\nparticipating patients were usefully involved in the construction of greenhouses at the Bridgewater State Hospital.\nThe Treatment Center itself was a further source of employment for kitchen and canteen workers, clerical help,\nlibrary aides, tutors, and graphic arts assistants. The Brockton Area Private Industry Council was providing career\ncounselling. Nine patients were participating in a work-release program, leaving each day to work at local jobs\nand returning each evening. The Center also started an avocational workshop, targeted to serve 50 patients.\nStaffing shortages impeded full implementation of the program; at time of trial, only eight persons were enrolled.\nNotwithstanding the three year delay in opening the AVO/OT area, the court found recent progress\n\"encouraging.\" It viewed staffing difficulties as the largest obstacle to complete implementation of the\noccupational and avocational programs and instructed the defendants to continue to \"employ their best efforts to\nfund and fill positions which have been allocated for these programs.\"\n3. Recreation. A large gymnasium was built as part of the new complex. It enabled the recreation program to be\noverhauled and rejuvenated. The gymnasium is equipped with basketball courts, a weightlifting area, pool tables,\nand other accoutrements. As late as 1988, due to security and staffing problems, the facility was only open on a\nlimited basis. By 1989, however, the gym was accessible seven days a week and offered a wide range of\nactivities. During February 1989, 146 patients per day, on average, used the facility.\nThe Treatment Center also sports an excellent outdoor recreation area, including a baseball diamond and track.\nSedentary forms of recreation, such as board games, are available in the common areas adjacent to each\nhousing unit. A Recreation Advisory Board, composed of patients, has been established to offer suggestions\nregarding development and administration of additional recreational programs.\n\nIt seems clear that, by 1989, the patients' recreational needs were being more than adequately met. The district\ncourt, in effect, so found.\n4. Therapeutic Programs. Under the new regime, sophisticated intake forms were devised and used. Shortly after\na patient's admission, a review board conducts a formal assessment of his background and needs. This\nassessment ranges from general educational and behavioral evaluations to diagnoses of specific problem areas.\nThe assessment is performed by the Treatment Center's research department, which has a national reputation\nfor excellence. Following completion of the assessment, a treatment protocol is implemented. Monthly progress\nreports are generated as to all patients and a \"patient services information summary\" is compiled, showing, inter\nalia, patient utilization of various therapy and other services within the institution as a whole.\nMost often, treatment is administered in the form of group therapy. Nevertheless, at time of trial, 45 patients were\nreceiving some kind of individualized treatment. Therapeutic modalities ranged from housing unit meetings\n(HUMs) to specialized programs focusing on particular deficiencies, e.g., substance abuse, anxiety management,\nimpulse control.\n1215 Once the new complex was completed in 1986, management made a reasoned professional *1215 decision that\nmany of the one-on-one programs, i.e., those involving individual audiences between patient and clinician, were\nineffective. It was decided to transform most of these programs into group sessions. According to the district\ncourt, this alteration in format, together with the concomitant shift from a psychodynamic treatment model to a\nbehavioral/rehabilitative model, caused \"some upheaval.\" A significant number of unhappy clinical staffers\ndeparted between 1986 and 1989.\nBy the time of trial, most of the turmoil had subsided. Under the aegis of Dr. Jurgela, the new Clinical Director,\nand Mr. Cardoza, the new Director of Rehabilitation Services, the defendants were on the way toward\nestablishing a comprehensive treatment program, emphasizing a cognitive behavioral approach. Each patient's\nspecialized needs and treatment protocol were systematically outlined in an individualized treatment plan (ITP)\nissued by the RIRB. In one form or another, group therapy was being offered to every patient. HUMs were\nuniversally available and 213 patients were participating in them. These sessions allowed patients to ventilate\nand resolve their complaints against their fellow residents. Dr. Jurgela believed that the patients' recalcitrance\nskewed the statistics somewhat. He testified without contradiction that many of the patients were not desirous of\n[7]\nreceiving any treatment.\nWithal, the trial court found that the defendants are often unable to provide all of the care specified by a patient's\nITP:\nUnfortunately, the treatment program outlined in a patient's ITP often bears little relation to the\ntreatment the patient can actually expect to receive. This failure occurs in part because treatments\nare sometimes recommended even though they are not offered at the Treatment Center, and\n[sometimes] because the limited clinical staff at the Treatment Center is overburdened and unable\nto provide all of the recommended treatment. In fact, the RIRB itself has been unable to fulfill\ncompletely its mandate. As many as forty-five patients have not had their ITP's reviewed during\nthe past twelve months....\nThe defendants argued below that, notwithstanding this shortfall, significant progress had been made, particularly\nduring the year preceding trial, toward implementing a comprehensive treatment system. Programs such as\n[8]\nanger management, anxiety management, self control therapy, and relaxation therapy had been instituted.\nDespite the recent increase in program availability, however, the very programs which related most directly to\npatients' sexual dangerousness, e.g., impulse control and systematic desensitization, were in the shortest supply.\n[9]\n1216 The court observed that staff shortages posed the largest obstacle to full implementation *1216 of therapeutic\n[10]\nservices.  Moreover, staff shortages seemed to be worsening; in 1987, the Treatment Center was authorized\nto employ a crew of 72 and fielded 53, whereas two years later, it had 78 authorized positions, only 40 of which\nwere filled. The court found these shortages, by and large, to be beyond the defendants' reasonable control; the\n\nlocation of the facility, anxiety over its future, and the violent nature of the population served to dissuade many\npotential applicants from accepting positions there.\nOn balance, the court concluded that the range of treatments presently offered satisfied the requirements of the\nconsent decrees, reasoning that the defendants were not obligated to provide every conceivable kind of\ntreatment that might have a beneficial effect. This conclusion stands in bold relief against the backdrop of a\nrecord which contains no colorable evidence that the Treatment Center was failing to treat any patients who\ndesired to participate in treatment programs.\n5. The Authorized Absence Program. The Authorized Absence Program (AAP), conceived by Judge Garrity in\n1978, allows patients to live in the outside community on a limited basis. AAP participants are accorded varying\ndegrees of freedom and supervision based on their clinical needs and the administration's assessment of security\nrisks. Soon after taking office in 1985, Tink began working to eliminate a huge backlog in the processing of AAP\napplications. He also secured additional AAP staff positions, at higher salaries, in order to improve the quantity\nand quality of available staffing. By early 1989, 49 patients were enrolled.\nThe district court found that the defendants devoted great effort to ensuring that the AAP ran efficiently and\neffectively; that Tink was personally committed to the program's success; and that satisfactory progress had been\nmade in this area. The court explicitly rejected plaintiffs' contention that Tink was not qualified to make final\ndecisions regarding program participation.\nC. Nature of the Facility.\n[11]\nThe psychiatric profile of the Treatment Center population can be plotted generally along a continuum.  At the\npoles are two relatively small inmate groups: under 15% of the population do not suffer from any known mental\ndisorders whereas, at the opposite pole, perhaps 10% suffer from extreme psychoses (such as schizophrenia\nand bipolar disorders). Individuals in the large \"middle\" group are afflicted by an array of moderate mental\ndisabilities, including problems associated with substance abuse, borderline personality disorders, and paraphilia.\nCommitment to the Treatment Center is intended not only to provide an opportunity for treatment but also to\nprotect society. Knight v. Mills, 836 F.2d 659, 667 n. 11 (1st Cir.1987). Because every patient is a convicted sex\noffender, and a majority of them have some kind of mental deficiency, the defendants face legitimate security\nconcerns. These concerns are exacerbated by the absence of statutory authority to deny commitments or to\ntransfer intractable patients. Thus, the Treatment Center is forced to accommodate patients who are continually\ndisruptive and who show no signs of rehabilitation. According to expert testimony, credited by the lower court, the\nlack of transfer authority, combined with the involuntary nature of the commitment process, distinguishes the\nTreatment Center from every other facility for sexually dangerous persons in the United States.\n1217 *1217 In light of the security risks that the patients pose to the staff and to each other, officials have implemented\nthe movement control pass (MCP) procedure. This procedure enables the administration to keep track of\npatients' locations by requiring them to obtain authorization before entering or leaving certain sections of the\nfacility. The tier system, under which patients are theoretically treated in the least restrictive environment, is also\ndriven by security concerns: a patient is housed in a particular privilege unit according to the threat he is\nperceived as posing to others' safety. To illustrate, persons assigned to the pre-release house or a maximum\nprivilege unit are thought to present the fewest security problems, and so forth. In other words, a patient's\n[12]\nprivilege status is inversely proportional to his status as a security risk.  The evidence was quite clear that\nnone of the criteria under which classification decisions were made countervailed, or were inappropriate in regard\nto, treatment purposes.\nThe trial judge found the MCP procedure and the tier system to be reasonable in light of the \"violent and\naggressive\" nature of certain patients. He also found them in conformity with the consent decrees. He concluded\nthat both policies gave acceptable weight to the professional judgment of the Treatment Center's administrators.\nIn this respect, the judge relied specifically upon Tink's testimony that a security-based classification system\n[13]\nmaterially advanced the therapeutic environment.\n\nV. ISSUES ON APPEAL\nPlaintiffs hawk a bevy of issues on appeal. In view of the district court's exhaustive opinion, we will discuss only a\n[14]\nfew points at any length.  The rest have been fully considered and we reject them as either plainly meritless or\nconclusively rebutted in the opinion below. In some instances, both rubrics apply.\nThe issues which warrant further discussion include (1) the plaintiffs' claim that the district court erred by\nsupposedly using a standard of constitutional adequacy to evaluate defendants' compliance with the consent\ndecrees, and (2) the plaintiffs' two-pronged assault on the court's conclusion that defendants were not in\ncontempt. We address these issues seriatim.\nA. The Proper Measure of Compliance.\nIn deciding the matters before it, the court below wisely abjured the constitutional issues which plaintiffs labored\nto raise. It was unnecessary to consider constitutional standards, the court reasoned, because the existing\nconsent decrees \"require[d] the provision of adequate treatment for patients\" at a level beyond that required by\nany applicable constitutional minima. Accord Twelve John Does v. District of Columbia, 855 F.2d 874, 878 n. 30\n(D.C.Cir.1988). Hence, a finding that the commonwealth was in substantial compliance with the decrees would\nperforce establish the absence of any constitutional abridgement and thus eliminate the need for a separate\nconstitutional inquiry. We think that the trial judge's skirting of the constitutional thicket was appropriate. It has\nbeen long settled that if a court can resolve a dispute without confronting an unsettled constitutional issue, it\nshould proceed in that fashion. See, e.g., Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 692, 99 S.Ct. 2545, 2553, 61\nL.Ed.2d 176 (1979); Hagans v. Lavine, 415 U.S. 528, 547, 94 S.Ct. 1372, 1384, 39 L.Ed.2d 577 (1974); \nAshwander v. TVA, 297 U.S. 288, 341, 346-48, 56 S.Ct. 466, 482-84, 80 L.Ed. 688 (1936) (Brandeis, J.,\nconcurring).\nAcknowledging that the consent decrees set a higher standard than the Constitution, plaintiffs do not seriously\n1218 dispute the *1218 correctness of the district court's announced methodology. Rather, they argue that the court,\ndespite its avowed intention of using the decrees as a yardstick, did the opposite, in reality eschewing the more\ndemanding criterion and measuring defendants' performance by reference solely to constitutional minima.\nWarming to this theme, the plaintiffs tell us that the court's application of a less rigorous standard can be seen in\nits articulation of the cardinal question as involving whether available treatment was \"adequate in light of the\npopulations' clinical needs.\" Because Judge Mazzone's framing of this inquiry focused on the needs of the\npatients, not the requirements of the consent decrees, plaintiffs perceive the court's very choice of words to be a\ntelltale for fundamental error. See supra note 6. In the same vein, the plaintiffs pounce upon the district court's\nuse of a statement from Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982), a case\nadmittedly involving constitutional rights, in the course of arriving at its determination that defendants' provision of\n[15]\ntherapeutic programs was sufficient.\nHaving read Judge Mazzone's opinion with care, we fail to see any transposition of the applicable standards. The\ndefendants' performance was measured against the imperatives of the consent decrees. While the court at times\nemployed language reminiscent of a constitutional analysis, the burden of its findings left no doubt that its primary\nconcern was with the decrees' mandates and the commonwealth's compliance therewith. Indeed, the court's\nstep-by-step delineation of the decree-required programs and its painstaking survey of defendants' efforts to\nimplement them bears reliable witness to the court's unswerving focus on the decrees as its polestar. Plaintiffs'\ncontrary argument represents at best a triumph of hope over reason.\nB. The Supportability of the Court's Conclusions.\nWe come now to the heart of plaintiffs' main appeal: their asseveration that the decision to deny relief was\nsupported by neither the evidence nor the lower court's findings.\n\n1. Sufficiency of the Evidence. Plaintiffs' argument can be broken down into two components. First, they mount a\nsomewhat desultory campaign to convince us that the trial court's findings were flawed. We are unpersuaded.\nWhen, as here, a district court sits as finder of the facts, its determinations are accorded great respect.\n[16]\nConstrained by the Civil Rules,  we review such findings of fact only for clear error. See Henry v. Connolly, 910\nF.2d 1000, 1002 (1st Cir.1990); Jackson v. Harvard University, 900 F.2d 464, 466 (1st Cir.),cert. denied,___ U.S.\n1219 ___, 111 S.Ct. 137, 112 L.Ed.2d 104 (1990); Anderson v.*1219Beatrice Foods Co., 900 F.2d 388, 392 (1st Cir.),\ncert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 111 S.Ct. 233, 112 L.Ed.2d 193 (1990). And in so doing, we are chary of permitting\n\"[a]ppellate review of complex, fact-dominated issues ... to descend to the level of Monday-morning\nquarterbacking.\" Beatrice Foods, 900 F.2d at 392.\nThe clear-error test is a rigorous one. \"It is not enough that [an appellate court] might give the facts another\nconstruction, resolve the ambiguities differently, and find a more sinister cast to actions which the district court\napparently deemed innocent.\" United States v. National Assoc. of Real Estate Boards, 339 U.S. 485, 495, 70\nS.Ct. 711, 717, 94 L.Ed. 1007 (1950); see also Keyes v. Secretary of the Navy, 853 F.2d 1016, 1020 (1st\nCir.1988). Before setting aside findings of fact or conclusions fairly inferable therefrom, the court of appeals must,\n\"on the whole of the record, ... form a strong, unyielding belief that a mistake has been made.\" Cumpiano v.\nBanco Santander Puerto Rico, 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir.1990); accord Reliance Steel Prods. Co. v. National\nFire Ins. Co., 880 F.2d 575, 576 (1st Cir.1989). It follows, then, that \"[w]here there are two permissible views of\nthe evidence, the factfinder's choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\" Anderson v. City of Bessemer\nCity, 470 U.S. 564, 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985).\nTo state the standard of review is, we think, to strip plaintiffs' assertions of any veneer of plausibility. The most\nhotly contested disputes between the parties stem from divergent interpretations of established facts. The\nlitigants disagree, for example, as to matters such as the degree of treatment needed to effect successful\nrehabilitation; the extent of the disruption to patients' progress caused by the changeover from one therapeutic\nmodel to another; the cause of the staff exodus in 1986 and 1987; and whether the turnover-related \"upheaval\" at\nthe Treatment Center was quelled (or merely papered over). Other notable differences of opinion concern\nwhether the defendants were responsible for failing to hire additional staff between 1987 and 1989 or, conversely,\nwhether factors beyond their control prevented them from filling open slots; and, second, whether the security\nmeasures implemented by the defendants were necessary. As a subset of the latter controversy, the parties\nbicker about the extent, if at all, to which the security measures impeded the patients' rehabilitation. The district\ncourt painstakingly addressed and resolved these disputes, by and large in appellees' favor. To be sure, many of\nthese areas pose mixed fact/law questions 00 but the factfinder's answers to such mixed questions must likewise\n97\nbe reviewed under the clear-error test. See Roland M. v. Concord School Comm., 910 F.2d 983, 990 (1st\nCir.1990),cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 111 S.Ct. 1122, 113 L.Ed.2d 230 (1991); New England Anti-Vivisection\nSoc., Inc. v. United States Surgical Corp., 889 F.2d 1198, 1203 (1st Cir.1989).\nGiven the court's thorough treatment of the facts, it would serve no useful purpose to repastinate well-ploughed\nsoil. The plaintiffs have argued forcefully, and well, that their evidence contradicted the commonwealth's evidence\nat several junctures; and that, were plaintiffs' version to be credited, the court's findings could not stand. That is\ntrue 00 but altogether beside the point. We freely concede that the evidence below was conflicting on a wide\n97\nvariety of points, and susceptible to differing inferences. Yet in the Rule 52(a) context, conflicts of this sort are\ngrist for the nisi prius mill. Having failed to limn any issue on which the lower court's factual findings lacked roots\nin the record, the plaintiffs' argument is really that the court, confronted with a series of equally supportable\nchoices, made the wrong ones. That argument must succumb to the jurisprudence and method of Rule 52(a).\nBecause the plaintiffs have given us no persuasive reason to think 00 let alone to form a \"strong, unyielding\n97\nbelief,\" Cumpiano, 902 F.2d at 152 00 that the trial court's findings of fact were in error, we will not disturb those\n97\nfindings.\n1220 2. Supportability of the Conclusions. Appellants' next initiative is somewhat *1220 more nettlesome. They\ncontend that the court's findings, even if swallowed whole, do not justify its ultimate conclusions. To the extent\nthat this asseveration has a patina of plausibility, it calls into question whether the defendants' provision of\n[17]\nprograms surpassed the threshold required by the consent decrees.\n\nIn the court's examination of the various treatment programs, it identified a number of instances in which the\ndefendants were slow in implementing programs (e.g., educational and vocational workshops) or in which they\nhad not yet fully developed existing programs (e.g., certain special needs courses). Pointing to the regulations\npromulgated pursuant to the consent decrees, and particularly to 104 C.M.R. § 8.03(3) (requiring defendants to\nprovide adequate treatment to \"every patient\"), plaintiffs contend that the defendants cannot be in compliance\nwith the consent decrees, and must therefore be in contempt, so long as the defendants' performance falls short\nof perfect compliance. We do not believe, however, that perfection is exigible; progress, after all, should not be\nreduced to a mere numbers game.\nWe begin with three general rules. First, a complainant must prove civil contempt by clear and convincing\nevidence. See, e.g., AMF, Inc. v. Jewett, 711 F.2d 1096, 1100 (1st Cir.1983). Second, substantial compliance can\navert a finding of contempt. That is to say, the decrees here at issue, like most such decrees, were susceptible to\nsatisfaction by diligent, good faith efforts, culminating in substantial compliance. See, e.g., Howard Johnson Co.\nv. Khimani, 892 F.2d 1512, 1516 (11th Cir.1990) (\"Conduct that evinces substantial, but not complete, compliance\nwith the court order may be excused if it was made as part of a good faith effort at compliance.\"); Drywall Tapers,\nLocal 1974 v. Local 530, 889 F.2d 389, 394 (2d Cir.1989) (\"A court may hold a party in civil contempt only if ...\n`the defendant has not been reasonably diligent and energetic in attempting to accomplish what was ordered.'\")\n(citation omitted), cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 110 S.Ct. 1478, 108 L.Ed.2d 615 (1990); Balla v. Idaho State Bd. of\nCorrections, 869 F.2d 461, 466 (9th Cir.1989) (\"Substantial compliance with a court order is a defense to an\naction for civil contempt.\"); see also Board of Educ. v. Dowell, ___ U.S. ___, 111 S.Ct. 630, 638, 112 L.Ed.2d 715\n(1991) (question of whether school board complied with desegregation order depends on whether board acted in\ngood faith and whether vestiges of past discrimination had been eradicated to the extent practicable). Third, an\nappellate court reviews the denial of a contempt motion only for abuse of discretion, Massachusetts Ass'n of\nOlder Americans v. Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, 803 F.2d 35, 38 (1st Cir.1986), a standard which must be\nadministered flexibly, with due regard for the circumstances. AMF, 711 F.2d at 1101.\nTo expand on the last of these tenets, it must be recognized that context is extremely important to appellate\noversight in cases like this one. Where a contempt motion involves an interpretation of a consent decree between\nprivate parties, the court of appeals has comparatively greater freedom to review the trial court's decision (which\nis akin to a contractual interpretation, and is thus largely a conclusion of law). See, e.g., id. at 1100; cf. Fashion\n1221 House, Inc. v. K Mart Corp., 892 *1221 F.2d 1076, 1083 (1st Cir.1989) (discussing standard of review in contract\ncases). In the context of public law litigation, however, the guidelines are much different. In such cases, the\ndistrict court's construction of a consent decree should be accorded considerable deference, because broad\nleeway is often necessary to secure complicated, sometimes conflicting, policy objectives. See United States v.\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts, 890 F.2d 507, 509-10 (1st Cir.1989); Massachusetts Ass'n of Older\nAmericans, 803 F.2d at 38; AMF, 711 F.2d at 1101.\nThis double standard derives from the realities of human experience. Different types of consent decrees are\nordinarily conceived and hatched in markedly different ways. In a commercial setting, a consent decree is treated\nlike a contract because the court assumes that private parties understand the economic realities and business\nconsequences of their agreements. See Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 890 F.2d at 509. The configuration\nbears a family resemblance to the conventional case configuration on the civil side, cf., e.g., AMF, 711 F.2d at\n1101 (\"A civil finding of contempt in the private context essentially triggers a payment of money damages as in\ngarden variety tort or contract litigation.\"), so the court acts essentially in its accustomed role as an umpire/\nadjudicator/assurer of procedural fairness.\nIn public law litigation, courts typically play a proactive role 00 a role which can have nearly endless permutations. \n97\nSee, e.g., Massachusetts Ass'n of Older Americans, 803 F.2d at 38. Frequently, the trial court's adjudicative\nfunction blends with its service as an instrument for change. The relief requested often involves the restructuring\nof a state or city program, requiring the court to fashion equitable remedies 00 sometimes unique and often\n97\ncomplicated 00 in order to secure \"complex legal goals.\" AMF, 711 F.2d at 1101. We agree with Professor Chayes\n97\nthat, in the public law context, the consent decree \"provides for a complex, on-going regime of performance\nrather than a simple, one-shot, one-way transfer.... It prolongs and deepens, rather than terminates, the court's\ninvolvement with the dispute.\" Chayes, The Role of the Judge in Public Law Litigation, 89 Harv.L.Rev. 1281, 1298\n\n(1976). What is more, the due administration of such a decree calls for a certain deftness of touch. After all,\n\"appropriate consideration must be given to principles of federalism in determining the availability and scope of\n[federal] equitable relief.\" Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362, 379, 96 S.Ct. 598, 608, 46 L.Ed.2d 561 (1976).\nIt is with an awareness of the three general rules mentioned above, and with this special understanding of the\ntrial judge's pivotal role in the conduct of public law litigation, that we examine the \"no contempt\" ruling in this\ncase. If a court were to employ tunnel vision and focus solely on the Treatment Center's existing (and admitted)\nshortcomings, in isolation, the argument for reversal might have a certain allure. But, a wider view of the litigation\nis required. At least since the time of Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294, 75 S.Ct. 753, 99 L.Ed. 1083\n(1955), district courts have exercised broad powers and enjoyed great latitude in regulating the operations of\nstate institutions, ranging from school districts, to hospitals, to prisons, as may be necessary to enforce federally\nassured rights. See The Supreme Court00Leading Cases, 104 Harv.L.Rev. 129, 296-97 (1990) (citing cases); see\n97\nalso Missouri v. Jenkins, ___ U.S. ___, 110 S.Ct. 1651, 1666, 109 L.Ed.2d 31 (1990) (upholding district court\norder compelling local government unit to levy taxes in excess of limits set by state statute in order to finance\nschool desegregation plan). And although federal district courts have been allowed 00 indeed, at times\n97\nconstitutionally required 00 to intrude in the affairs of state and local governments, such intervention has been\n97\nconducted with the clear understanding that the autonomy of these governmental entities should be safeguarded\nto the maximum extent possible. As the Court stated in Jenkins, \"one of the most important considerations\ngoverning the exercise of [federal] equitable power is a proper respect for the integrity and function of local\n1222 government institutions.\" Id.*1222110 S.Ct. at 1663; see also Rosario-Torres v. Hernandez-Colon, 889 F.2d 314,\n323 (1st Cir.1989) (en banc).\nThe Court demonstrated this very concern in Spallone v. United States, 493 U.S. 265, 110 S.Ct. 625, 107\nL.Ed.2d 644 (1990), holding that a district court had over-extended its equitable powers. There, the lower court,\nwithout first levying fines against the municipality alone, imposed contempt sanctions on individual city council\nmembers who had failed to comply with a consent decree between the city and the United States. Id.110 S.Ct. at\n634. In setting aside the sanctions, the Spallone Court emphasized that district judges should exercise the \"least\npossible power\" to achieve the remedial end proposed. Id. at 635 (quoting Shillitani v. United States, 384 U.S.\n364, 371, 86 S.Ct. 1531, 1536, 16 L.Ed.2d 622 (1966)).\nIn the case at bar, this panoply of principles is much in evidence. The district court, albeit in the person of a series\nof different judges, has been the central figure in monitoring the extent and adequacy of services provided at the\nTreatment Center over the better part of the last two decades. The court has been assiduous in protecting\npatients' rights. It has entertained numerous enforcement actions brought under the Williams consent decrees.\nThe result has been a tapestry of marked progress, woven more through careful attention to the overall design of\nthe consent decrees than through an unbending insistence on absolutes. The historical record before us is dotted\nwith examples of judicial restraint cast in precisely the mold configured by the Spallone Court: the achievement of\nlegally required goals by methods which, while effective, are among the least onerous and intrusive methods\navailable.\nIn the present litigation, the lower court appears to have trod the well-beaten path. It undertook a detailed review\nof compendious evidence and decided that, in light of the defendants' notable progress, there was substantial\ncompliance with the overall mandate of the consent decrees, and hence, no contempt. The district court\neffectively credited the defendants with exercising their best efforts to comply with the decrees. Considering the\ndistrict court's prolonged institutional involvement with the litigation and its demonstrated willingness to impose\nsignificant demands on the commonwealth when necessary 00 ordering, for example, that a new Treatment\n97\nCenter be built 00 we believe that its decision not to hold the state defendants in contempt is worthy of\n97\nconsiderable deference. Cf. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 890 F.2d at 510 (review of district court's ultimate\nfinding on contempt should be conducted with deference to the court's \"intimate understanding of the history and\ncircumstances of th[e] litigation\").\nViewing matters through this deferential prism leaves us no principled option but to affirm the decision below.\nAbuse of discretion can most easily be found when the weight and pigmentation of the evidence places a matter\nat one end of the spectrum or another. This is not such a case. It is quite plain from both the record as a whole\nand the district court's findings that there was neither letter-perfect compliance with, nor palpable disregard for,\n\nthe demands of the consent decrees. In circumstances where black and white were both submerged in scumbled\nshades of gray, the fact that defendants had not completely implemented the programs specified in the decrees\ncould rationally support two opposite, though equally plausible, inferences: either defendants had not taken\nreasonable steps to comply, or the nature of the institution, coupled with staffing shortages beyond the\ndefendants' control, had prevented defendants from attaining full compliance notwithstanding good faith efforts.\nEspecially given the tangled nature of the issues, deciding which of these inferences to draw was a judgment call\nbest left to the trier.\nCognizant of the heavy burden which a complainant must carry in a contempt proceeding, we conclude that the\n1223 district court's subsidiary findings were adequate to sustain the ultimate ruling on contempt.[18]*1223Compare,\ne.g., Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 890 F.2d at 510-11 (\"[W]hile the Commonwealth has not complied with\nthe decree's staffing ratios, the district court was within its discretion in determining that such non-compliance\ndoes not constitute contempt.\"). We have in mind, particularly, the court's findings (1) that the defendants have\nestablished, or are making substantial progress toward establishing, those programs memorialized in the consent\ndecrees, (2) that the defendants have acted, and are acting, in good faith, (3) that the defendants have made\ngreat \"efforts to achieve better and more enlightened institutional management practices,\" and (4) that staffing\nshortages and security problems beyond defendants' control have been, and are, the most persistent obstacles\nto complete implementation of treatment and programs. Because each of these findings is eminently supportable,\nwe decline the invitation to second-guess the trier's informed choice between competing inferences in this\ncomplex situation.\nWe think that such a conclusion is reinforced by the Supreme Court's recent decision in Dowell. There, the\nJustices held that court-imposed desegregation orders may be lifted when a school board has complied in good\nfaith with the decrees and \"the vestiges of past discrimination ha[ve] been eliminated to the extent practicable.\" \n[19]\n111 S.Ct. at 638. Despite significant differences between this case and Dowell,  the underlying principle is\nequally applicable here: officials operating under a public law decree are required to employ good faith efforts to\nsatisfy its demands, and fault should not be found if they have implemented its dictates to the extent practicable. \nId.\nTo sum up, the court below acted within its proper domain in preferring, at this juncture, the velvet glove to the\nmailed hand. There was no clear and convincing proof that defendants were in contempt of the consent decrees.\nOn this record, it appears entirely plausible that defendants' shortcomings reflected the parlous circumstances\nunder which they were compelled to operate rather than reproachable inadequacies in their efforts. Indeed, the\ncontinued and continuing development of the Treatment Center's programs strongly suggests that defendants'\nlabors are yielding as fruitful a harvest of progress as conditions reasonably allow.\nVI. COUNSEL FEES\nThe merits behind us, we proceed, finally, to the fee award.\nA. The Court's Findings.\nAfter the district court's decision on the merits was announced, the plaintiffs moved for an award of attorneys'\nfees and costs in the amount of $533,021. The defendants objected to any award, contending that the plaintiffs\nhad not prevailed. The district court found that (1) the improvements in the physical plant and treatment programs\n\"were not due to [plaintiffs'] counsel's efforts in any measurable sense\"; (2) counsel's actions did not lead to the\nissuance of any interim order, injunctive relief, or specific programmatic change; and (3) there was no clear\ncausal link between defendants' progress and plaintiffs' remorseless prosecution of the litigation. The court\nsummed up the situation by observing that, although plaintiffs' lawyers had expended much time and effort, they\nhad concentrated on the trees, thereby losing sight of the forest:\n1224 *1224 [C]ounsel, in my judgment, did not pursue the original objective of the pro se plaintiffs to\n\"interpret, clarify and enforce\" the decrees, but pursued a course of long, expensive, contentious\n\nlitigation which, again, in my judgment, prolonged the dispute, heightened the tension and ignored\nthe basic issue, namely, the proper role for the Treatment Center in the correctional system of\nMassachusetts in light of what I termed the inherently inconsistent law designed to treat and\npunish the sexually dangerous person.\nDespite these findings, the court concluded that some unspecified benefit was achieved and that \"[c]ounsel's ...\npresence throughout the period, and at trial, in presenting the issues, should be acknowledged.\" The judge also\n[20]\nwrote that \"[c]ounsel's efforts ... contributed to a resolution of the double-bunking issue....\"  In a somewhat\ndifferent vein, the court noted that defendants had been dilatory at times in responding to discovery requests. In\nlight of this recalcitrance, \"an award of fees is indicated because the delay and uneven course of this litigation is\nattributable in part to defendants' counsel.\" The court, acting under 42 U.S.C. § 1988, proceeded to award fees of\n$35,400 and costs of $10,000. The ruling pleased no one: plaintiffs argue that the award, comprising less than\n10% of the amount requested, was niggardly; defendants argue that no fees were due.\nB. Analysis.\nThe governing statute is the Fees Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1988, which provides in pertinent part that, in actions brought\nunder the aegis of 42 U.S.C. § 1983, \"the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party ... a reasonable\nattorney's fee as part of the costs.\" In Guglietti v. Secretary of HHS, 900 F.2d 397 (1st Cir.1990), we mapped two\n[21]\nroutes to prevailing party status:\n[I]n order to constitute a litigant as \"prevailing,\" ... the party either must have enjoyed some\nbottom-line litigatory success or her suit must have had a catalytic effect in bringing about a\ndesired result.\nId. at 398; accord Exeter-West Greenwich Regional School Dist. v. Pontarelli, 788 F.2d 47, 50 (1st Cir.1986); \nNadeau v. Helgemoe, 581 F.2d 275, 278-79 (1st Cir.1978).\nThe first of these routes permits a court to award fees to plaintiffs only if they succeed on a \"significant issue in\nlitigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.\" Nadeau, 581 F.2d at 278-79; see\nalso Texas State Teachers Ass'n v. Garland Indep. School Dist., 489 U.S. 782, 789, 109 S.Ct. 1486, 1491-92,\n103 L.Ed.2d 866 (1989); Guglietti, 900 F.2d at 400; Exeter-West Greenwich, 788 F.2d at 50. In effect, the merits\ntest \"states the obvious, namely, that a party has prevailed if it wins the litigation.\" Coalition for Basic Human\nNeeds v. King, 691 F.2d 597, 599 (1st Cir.1982). Because this standard requires a plaintiff to succeed on at least\none substantial claim, it is inapplicable here. The plaintiffs did not win on any significant issue in the current\n[22]\nlitigation and no judgment was entered in their favor.\nWe turn, then, to the second route to prevailing party status. The catalyst test \"applies to plaintiffs who have\nsucceeded in achieving favorable results because of the filing of their § 1983 claim, but have not had a final\n1225 judgment on the merits entered in their favor.\" Exeter-West Greenwich, 788 F.2d at 52. It is *1225 invoked in\nthose cases in which plaintiffs do not receive a favorable judgment, yet claim to have succeeded in bringing\nabout a beneficial change in defendants' conduct or in the conditions complained of 00 a change which would not\n97\nhave occurred but for the institution of the suit. The critical inquiry is whether the suit \"prompt[ed] defendants to\ntake action to meet plaintiff's claim....\" Nadeau, 581 F.2d at 279. In this inquiry, \"the litigation's `provocative role' in\nthe calculus of relief is a sine qua non....\" Guglietti, 900 F.2d at 401 (quoting Nadeau, 581 F.2d at 280). If the\ndefendants acted other than in response to the spur of plaintiffs' suit, the catalyst theory does not apply. See id.;\nsee also Nadeau, 581 F.2d at 280-81.\nThe catalyst test, like the merits test, involves not only a causality requirement but a materiality requirement. \"The\ntouchstone of the prevailing party inquiry must be the material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties....\" \nTexas Teachers, 489 U.S. at 792-93, 109 S.Ct. at 1493. Thus, in Texas Teachers, the Court noted that, had the\nplaintiffs only succeeded on an issue of \"minor significance,\" they would not be \"prevailing parties\" within the\nmeaning of section 1988. Id. at 792, 109 S.Ct. at 1493. Excepting for the time being the double-bunking issue,\n\nplaintiffs' application for attorneys' fees founders on both the causality and materiality components of the catalyst\ntest.\nAs to causation, the district court squarely found that plaintiffs did not \"show[ ] a clear causal link between\nchanges made by the defendants and this lawsuit.\" To be sure, plaintiffs argue that this finding was erroneous,\ncontending that the chronological sequence of the various improvements, when viewed in conjunction with the\nprogress of the litigation, proves that defendants were responding to pressures imposed by the lawsuit.\nChronology, however, is neither the be-all nor the end-all. See Nadeau, 581 at F.2d 281 (chronological sequence,\nthough important, is \"clearly not definitive ... in determining whether or not defendant ... guided his actions in\nresponse to plaintiff's lawsuit\"). Put another way, \"the mere existence of a temporal coincidence ... cannot alone\nsuffice\" to engage the gears of the catalyst test. Martinez v. Rhode Island Housing and Mortgage Finance Corp.,\n628 F.Supp. 996, 1001 (D.R.I.1986). The trial court was in the best position to sort out coincidence from effect,\nand hence, appellate appraisal of its findings must be deferential. See Guglietti, 900 F.2d at 399; McDonald v.\nSecretary of HHS, 884 F.2d 1468, 1474 (1st Cir.1989); cf. Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552, 557-63, 108 S.Ct.\n2541, 2546-49, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988) (abuse of discretion standard used in reviewing district court's\ndetermination, in connection with EAJA fee-shifting inquiry, of whether government's position was \"substantially\njustified\"). As to materiality, the district court determined that whatever changes the litigation prompted were not\nsubstantial; and this assessment, too, seems sustainable.\nGiven the standard of review, we are unable to disturb the lower court's findings that neither causation nor\nmateriality was proven. And based on those findings, we have little difficulty in concluding that the court did not\nerr in refusing to grant the bulk of plaintiffs' fee request. Indeed, once the court's succinctly phrased findings are\naccepted, as they must be, any broadscale characterization of the plaintiffs as \"prevailing parties\" would threaten\nthe very integrity of that term. Not only did plaintiffs lose on all their claims, but the positive changes that occurred\nat the Treatment Center, as the district court itself acknowledged, were not triggered by the suit \"in any\nmeasurable sense.\"\nThere is, however, one aspect of the court's fee award which is less than pellucidly clear. On the one hand,\nJudge Mazzone stated: \"I conclude that there have been some minor benefit [sic] achieved, and some minor\nchanges in the parties' relationships that have been brought about as a result of the efforts of counsel....\" He also\nstated that, in his view, \"[t]he Bruder plaintiffs spawned no interim order ... and were rebuffed on virtually every\n1226 issue by Judge Young. On an issue which survived, namely, the double-bunking *1226 of John Bruder, that\nachievement was shortly negated by Judge McNaught.\" These comments seem to denigrate the importance of\nany success the plaintiffs might have attained on double-bunking. And if, indeed, the double-bunking point was of\n\"minor significance\" given the scope and tenor of the litigation as a whole, legal services rendered in respect to it\nwould not be compensable. See Texas Teachers, 489 U.S. at 792, 109 S.Ct. at 1493. Yet, notwithstanding this\nlanguage, the judge appears to have predicated the modest fee award at least in part on plaintiffs' contribution to\nresolving the double-bunking issue and to have identified no other cognizable issue on which the plaintiffs could\nbe said to have prevailed.\nBecause of Judge Mazzone's limited, and perhaps conflicting, characterization of plaintiffs' role in setting double-\nbunking to rest, we think that prudence suggests the desirability of clarification. For one thing, the record is\ninsufficiently developed on this point, see supra note 20, to allow us adequately to evaluate the propriety of the\nfee award vis-a-vis double-bunking. For another thing, the lower court expressed no findings regarding the\nmethods it employed, or the calculations it made, in arriving at the fee it set, thereby frustrating review. See, e.g., \nPeckham v. Continental Casualty Ins. Co., 895 F.2d 830, 842 (1st Cir.1990) (\"Appellate review of fee awards\nordinarily requires that concrete findings be made and that the court below supply a clear explanation of the\nreasons undergirding a particular fee award.\"). These factors counsel strongly in favor of a remand for further\nfindings. See Metrocorps v. Eastern Mass. Jr. Drum & Bugle Corps, 912 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1990); Morgan v. Mass.\nGeneral Hosp., 901 F.2d 186, 195 (1st Cir.1990); Brown v. Bullard Independent School Dist., 640 F.2d 651, 654\n(5th Cir.),cert. denied,454 U.S. 828, 102 S.Ct. 120, 70 L.Ed.2d 103 (1981).\nThere is also another consideration militating in favor of a remand. It appears from what Judge Mazzone wrote\nthat he might very well have made the $45,400 award principally to sanction defendants' counsel for their\n\"recalcitrance and unwillingness ... to move the matter to an expeditious resolution\" and to recompense plaintiffs'\n\ncounsel for the corresponding expense. Although such an essentially punitive purpose has no place in a\nprevailing party analysis under section 1988, the aim of which is to reward successful plaintiffs for their efforts,\nnot to punish victorious defendants for some unspecified degree of recalcitrance, it is beyond cavil that a district\ncourt, acting sua sponte under a variety of other rules and statutes, e.g., Fed.R.Civ.P. 11, 16(f), 37(b); 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1927, may require a party to assume an opponent's fees and costs to punish prolonged foot-dragging. Because\nthe record is murky on what the judge actually intended, and an award under some rule or statute other than\nsection 1988 might be permissible in the circumstances described by the lower court, remand would allow an\nopportunity for needed clarification of this point.\nFor these reasons, we return the case to the district court with instructions that more specific findings be entered\nin connection with plaintiffs' entitlement vel non to fees on the double-bunking issue. If the court should conclude\nthat plaintiffs' achievement with respect thereto was of only \"minor significance,\" Texas Teachers, 489 U.S. at\n792, 109 S.Ct. at 1493, or did not have \"a catalytic effect,\" Guglietti, 900 F.2d at 399, in bringing about\nabandonment of the practice, no fees may be awarded under 42 U.S.C. § 1988. If, however, the court concludes\nthat plaintiffs are deserving of fees with respect to that issue, then the court should make specific findings as to\nthe number of hours reasonably spent and the hourly rate to be employed. Moreover, wholly apart from the\nmatter of double-bunking, the district judge may, if he believes such a course to be indicated, convene a hearing\nto consider whether monetary sanctions should be levied under the aegis of an applicable rule or statute, and if\nso, the extent of any monetary award. Of course, specific findings will also be required if such sanctions are\n1227 imposed. See generally Figueroa-Ruiz v. Alegria, 905 *1227 F.2d 545, 548-49 (1st Cir.1990) (discussing\ndesirability of findings in Rule 11 setting).\nVII. CONCLUSION\nWe need go no further. After close perscrutation of a voluminous record spanning nearly two decades, we are\nsatisfied that the district court's thoughtful resolution of the merits must be upheld. The fee award, however, must\n[23]\nbe vacated and the cause remanded for further proceedings as discussed above.\nThe district court's refusal to hold the defendants in contempt and its denial of equitable relief are affirmed. The\naward of fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 is vacated. The case is remanded to the district court for further\nproceedings not inconsistent herewith. No costs on appeal.\nIt is so ordered.\nAPPENDIX A\nPARTIAL CONSENT DECREE\nPending a hearing on other issues in this action, the parties have agreed to enter into a partial consent decree in\nsaid matter, the provisions of which are as follows:\n1. The Treatment Center at MCI Bridgewater shall be treated as a facility of the Department of Mental Health.\n2. Primary responsibility and authority for the Treatment Center shall be exercised by the Department of Mental\nHealth.\n3. All personnel at the Treatment Center (clinical, custodial, administrative) shall be subject to the control of the\nCommissioner of Mental Health with respect to the handling of patients.\n4. Custodial personnel, but not patients, shall be under the administrative, operational and disciplinary control of\nthe Commissioner of Correction.\n5. The Department of Mental health shall exercise the responsibility and authority set forth in subparagraph 2\nabove so that patients at the Treatment Center should have the least restrictive conditions necessary to achieve\n\nthe purposes of commitment. To implement this and other provisions of this decree, the Department of Mental\nHealth shall forthwith take steps jointly and in cooperation with the Department of Correction including, as\nappropriate, seeking legislative funding, to do the following:\na. Improve the physical plant at the Treatment Center....\nb. Implement a meaningful work program and increasing avocational activities which may, for those patients so\npreferring, be a substitute for the work program.\nc. Have a system of differing security for different categories of patients and modifying the plant if necessary to\npermit less restrictive conditions for those patients not requiring maximum security.\n....\n6. The Department of Mental Health and Department of Correction will also act in concert to draw up and\npromulgate certain rules and regulations to apply to patients at the Treatment Center. These rules and\nregulations shall include but shall not be limited to the following: (a) implementation of the tier system of security;\n(b) application of the rules of the Department of Mental Health governing the civil rights of patients pursuant to\nM.G.L. c. 123 to the patients at the Treatment Center insofar as consistent with M.G.L. 123A....\nAPPENDIX B\nPARTIAL CONSENT DECREE\nThe Court orders, adjudges, and decrees that:\n....\n2. On March 15, 1975, the defendant Commissioner of Correction shall file ... copies of a plan describing in detail\nthe contemplated disposition, on June 30, 1975, of the then existing Treatment Center patients, staff, equipment,\n1228 physical plant, budget, and other resources. The plan *1228 shall include a statement of the precise disposition\nor contemplated alternative dispositions of each person who, on March 15, 1975, is a patient of the Treatment\nCenter. The plan also shall include a detailed description of the therapeutic, educational, vocational, and\navocational programs to be provided by the Department of Mental Health to patients of the Treatment Center, and\na provision for the day or other short-term release of Treatment Center patients for approved programs outside\nthe Treatment Center where such release is deemed appropriate by the Department of Mental Health....\n3. The terms of this decree do hereby supersede and cancel the terms of section 5.a. of the Partial Consent\nDecree previously entered in this case on June 14, 1974, but do not supersede or cancel any other terms of said\nPartial Consent Decree.\n4. The Court retains jurisdiction in this case.\n[*] Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation.\n[1] Although cross-appeals have been docketed, we will for simplicity's sake refer to plaintiffs as appellants and\ndefendants as appellees. We will also sometimes refer to the defendants, collectively, as \"the commonwealth.\"\n[2] Although not directly germane to these appeals, it should be noted that, effective September 1990, the\nlegislature curtailed new admissions to the Treatment Center: \n[N]o person shall be newly committed to the treatment center for sexually dangerous persons or to any branch\nthereof under the provisions of chapter one hundred and twenty-three A of the General Laws on or after\nSeptember first, nineteen hundred and ninety; provided, however, that all persons committed to said treatment\ncenter, as of said date, shall be maintained at said treatment center subject to [preexisting law]....\n\nMass. Acts of 1990 ch. 150, § 104; see also Mass. Acts of 1990 ch. 150, § 304 (repealing §§ 3-7 of Mass.Gen.L.\nch. 123A).\n[3] In the case of an individual who committed a sexual assault while incarcerated, the warden would notify the\nDMH, via the Commissioner, and a screening examination would be arranged. If the examination indicated\nsexual dangerousness, an appropriate corrections official could ask the original sentencing court to commit the\nindividual to the Treatment Center. See Mass.Gen.L. ch. 123A, § 6. In the case of an individual convicted of a sex\noffense (but not yet sentenced), the court or the commonwealth could seek a similar screening examination. Id.\nat § 4. Moreover, with or without such a screen, the court or the commonwealth could have the defendant\ntemporarily committed to the Treatment Center for observation. Id.\n[4] We note in passing that, though section 5 has been repealed, see Mass.Acts of 1990 ch. 150, § 304, we\nbelieve, and the parties do not dispute, that a patient's criminal sentence continues to run concurrently with his\nconfinement at the Treatment Center.\n[5] In 1986, the defendants moved for relief from the 1978 order on the ground that it appeared to conflict with a\nrecently enacted statute, Mass.Gen.L. ch. 123A, § 8 (1986). The district court denied the motion. The\ncommonwealth appealed. We concluded that further factfinding was desirable. See Williams v. Lesiak, 822 F.2d\n1223 (1st Cir.1987). On remand, the district court, in an unpublished opinion dated December 19, 1989, vacated\nthe 1978 order.\n[6] Appellants harangue the district court's focus on \"adequate\" treatment as indicative of an erroneous standard.\nThe record belies the criticism, making it perfectly plain that the court used \"adequate\" as a shorthand reference\nto the level of treatment required by the consent decrees. This was, of course, an accepted use of the adjective. \nSee, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary 36 (5th ed. 1979) (defining \"adequate\" as meaning, inter alia, \"equal to what is\nrequired\").\n[7] One disincentive to participating in treatment, at least for those patients facing unexpired or as-yet-unimposed\nprison terms, is that, after the necessary procedural shoals have been navigated, a cure will lead inexorably to\nthe individual's transfer from the Treatment Center to a correctional facility in order to serve his prison term (or\nthe remainder of it).\n[8] To sum up, the following specialized programs were in operation and were serving the indicated number of\nparticipants: \nAbsence Counselor Info. Group                  13\nAdult Children of Alcoholics Info. Group       13\nAdult Children of Alcoholics Treatment\n  Group                                        12\nADL/Medications Issues Group                   36\nAlcoholics Anonymous                           30\nAnger/Stress Management Group                  51\nCultural Awareness Group                        4\nCurrent Events Group                           23\nDrug/Alcohol Info. Group                        8\nImpulse/Anxiety Management Group                5\nIncest Survivors Group                          5\nIn-Community AA/ACDA                           14\nIn-Community Parent Group                       2\nIn-Community Treatment Group                    6\nPsychodrama/Role Play Groups                   23\nSubstance Abuse Groups                         27\nVeterans' Groups                               10\n\n[9] Plaintiffs argued at trial that staffing shortages also caused delay in the inauguration of other desirable\ntreatment programs, including social skills training, systematic desensitization, orgasmic reconditioning, and\ncovert conditioning. They pointed out that, although a plethysmograph (a diagnostic machine used to measure\nsexual arousal) had been purchased in 1986, the machine had never been incorporated into the Treatment\nCenter's roster of ongoing programs. To the extent that the district court credited these asseverations, it did not\nplace the onus on the commonwealth.\n[10] The defendants did not disagree with this proposition. In his 1987 letter, Tink complained that his \"staff is\nbeing stretched to the limit and is being burned out and exhausted. Responsibilities cannot be carried out at\noptimal and safe levels under these conditions indefinitely.\"\n[11] It must, of course, be borne in mind that the term \"sexually dangerous person\" is not a medical diagnosis. To\nthe contrary, the term describes a particular legal status, not necessarily a condition of mental illness. There is no\nevidence that sex offenders, by and large, suffer from a \"disease\" that can be treated and cured as such.\n[12] At time of trial, 16 patients were at the pre-release house, 149 patients had maximum privilege status, 78\npatients had moderate/maximum privilege status, 21 patients had moderate/moderate privilege status, and 22\npatients had minimum privilege status.\n[13]\nTink also testified, without credible contradiction, that no patient was ever denied access to needed treatment\nservices based on the patient's privilege status.\n[14] We reserve for later consideration the matter of attorneys' fees. See infra Part VI.\n[15]Youngberg held that a retarded patient who was committed to a state institution had certain constitutionally\nprotected liberty interests. Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 315-19, 102 S.Ct. at 2457-60. None of the analysis employed\nby the Supreme Court in fashioning these liberty interests can be found in the district court's Bruder opinion.\nNonetheless, commenting on HUMs and other types of therapy \"directly relate[d] to a patient's sexual\ndangerousness,\" Judge Mazzone, quoting Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 317, 102 S.Ct. at 2459 (citation omitted), did\nwrite: \nI also recognize that \"a State necessarily has considerable discretion in determining the nature and scope of its\nresponsibilities\" and that it need not be forced to \"`choose between attacking every aspect of a problem or not\nattacking the problem at all.'\"\nHe then concluded that \"nothing in the second Williams consent decree requires the defendants to make\navailable every technique or program which might have a beneficial effect.\" It is surpassingly clear that the district\ncourt simply used dictum from Youngberg, embodying an accepted constitutional principle, to assist in\ninterpreting the parties' intent in regard to one of the consent decrees. We totally reject the unwarranted gloss\nthat appellants seek to place on the borrowed language.\n[16] The Civil Rules provide in pertinent part: \nIn all actions tried upon the facts without a jury ... the court shall find the facts specially and state separately its\nconclusions of law thereon.... Findings of fact, whether based on oral or documentary evidence, shall not be set\naside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the\ncredibility of the witnesses.\nFed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).\n[17] We need not linger long over the plaintiffs' effort to broaden the forensic base of this initiative. They contend\nthat, because a policy may be motivated by security concerns, it is necessarily violative of the consent decrees.\nThis ipse dixit sheds much heat but little light. The facts supportably found below indicate all too clearly that,\nwithout appropriate precautions, the Treatment Center would place the safety of patients and staff in jeopardy,\nthus imperiling the setting and mission of the entire institution. Almost by definition, an unsafe environment would\nbe one in which the ability to deliver effective therapeutic services would be drastically reduced. Moreover, the\n\nconsent decrees did not bar consideration of security matters; to the contrary, the decrees required that,\nnotwithstanding the Treatment Center's overriding purpose, all custodial personnel would remain under DOC\ncontrol. For these reasons, the district court's finding that some of the Treatment Center's policies were\n\"correctional\" in their genesis did not in and of itself necessitate a finding of contempt.\n[18] We have already determined that these subsidiary findings are impervious to clear-error attack. See supra\nPart V(B)(1).\n[19] Although Dowell, like the instant case, is the product of public law litigation in which the district court played\nan active and ongoing role in monitoring compliance with a resultant decree, the cases are postured rather\ndifferently. Primarily, the decree in Dowell was imposed to eliminate discrimination found to be unconstitutional; it\ndid not establish, as do the Williams decrees, standards more rigorous than those found in the Constitution. Also,\nthe Dowell desegregation decree was drafted under the assumption that it would one day be lifted (once\nsufficient integration was achieved); the decrees in Williams, on the other hand, may well contemplate a less\ntransient existence. Finally, the relief sought in Dowell was the dissolution of an injunction, whereas plaintiffs here\nseek to have defendants found in contempt.\n[20] Aside from this reference and a terse statement in the principal opinion that the defendants, under pressure\nfrom Judge Young, abandoned the policy of linking maximum privilege status with acquiescence in double-\nbunking, the court did not elaborate on the nature of the suggested contribution.\n[21] To be sure, Guglietti involved fee-shifting under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d),\nrather than under the Fees Act. On this point, however, the distinction is devoid of any meaningful difference;\n\"EAJA's reference to prevailing party status must be read consistently with the phrase's usage in other federal\nfee-shifting statutes.\" Guglietti, 900 F.2d at 399; accord McDonald v. Secretary of HHS, 884 F.2d 1468, 1474 (1st\nCir.1989).\n[22] We leave aside for the moment the double-bunking issue, which we shall consider in terms of the catalyst\ntest. See infra at pp. 1225-1226.\n[23] In remanding, we eschew any suggestion that fees should or should not be awarded in regard to double-\nbunking. Similarly, we take no view anent the appropriateness vel non of monetary sanctions.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
