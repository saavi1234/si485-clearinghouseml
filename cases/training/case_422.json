The plaintiffs asked the district court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that their constitutional rights had been violated by overcrowding, inadequate staffing, poor physical facilities, and discrimination on the basis of race, economic hardship, and voluntary status of committal.  </p><p>On January 16, 1976, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Judge Edward Raymond Neaher) dismissed all of the plaintiffs' claims except the equal protection claim. <a href=\"http://clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/MH-NY-0003-0005.pdf\">Woe v. Mathews, 408 F. Supp. 419 (E.D.N.Y. 1976)</a>.  The plaintiffs appealed.

Califano, 434 U.S. 1048 (1978)</a>.</p><p>In the four years that followed, the parties underwent discovery, amended their pleadings, and negotiated.  On March 1, 1983, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Judge Neaher) granted summary judgment to the defendants and dismissed the case, holding that: 1) the hospital system's accreditation criteria were sufficient to satisfy due process requirements of patients, 2) that involuntary commitment of mental patients, when compared to the private institutionalization of voluntarily committed patients, did not violate the equal protection clause, and 3) that the issue of whether a non-accredited facility could be found to have fallen below constitutional standards did not meet the class-action criteria for this case. <a href=\"http://clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/MH-NY-0003-0003.pdf\">Woe v.

Cuomo, 469 U.S. 936 (1984)</a>.</p><p>On July 1, 1986, the U.S. District Court (Judge Neaher) granted the plaintiffs a permanent injunction, holding that the psychiatric center provided constitutionally inadequate care, noting that the facility was overcrowded and that it did not provide adequate clothing, storage, toothpaste, toothbrushes, toilet paper, paper towels, or bed linens.  The court also noted that the facility was extremely dirty and smelly, infested with vermin, had poor plumbing, posed fire safety problems, and contained inadequate first aid equipment.  The court enjoined the defendants from admitting any additional patients to the facility until these problems had been fixed.  <a href=\"http://clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/MH-NY-0003-0004.pdf\">Woe v.

The defendants appealed.</p><p>On September 29, 1986, the Second Circuit reversed the issuance of the injunction and remanded the case, holding that: 1) the district court acted prematurely in granting a permanent injunction without notice at a hearing on a request for a preliminary injunction, 2) that the evidence supported the issuance of a preliminary injunction, but the court should have given the defendants the opportunity to present alternatives. <a href=\"http://clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/MH-NY-0003-0007.pdf\">Woe v.

In this intervening time, the lead plaintiff (Walter Woe) died, and his place was filled by Frank Foe.  </p><p>On November 17, 1988, the district court (Judge Bartels) approved a settlement agreement between the parties and closed the case. <a href=\"http://clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/MH-NY-0003-0001.pdf\">Foe v.

Gen., New York City\n(New York State Office of Mental Health, New York City by John Petrila, and Seth Abrams, New York City, of\ncounsel), for defendants.\nNEAHER, District Judge.\nThis motion for summary judgment in the class action centers essentially on a single issue: whether a State\nmental hospital which is accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals (\"JCAH\") is necessarily\n[1]\nin compliance with due process requirements.  In addition to resolving that issue, however, a myriad of other\noutstanding procedural and substantive matters pending in this needlessly complex seven-and-one-half year old\naction will be disposed of. For clarification, a review of the lengthy history of this case is necessary.\nBackground\nWalter Woe (a pseudonym) was an involuntarily committed mental patient at Brooklyn State Hospital (since\nrenamed \"Kingsboro Psychiatric Center\"), a New York State public hospital for the mentally ill, when this class\n[2]\naction commenced.  In his amended complaint, he alleged that the hospital was overcrowded, understaffed,\nand lacked adequate facilities, and that its population was more likely to be comprised of individuals who were\nless wealthy, more ill, and black than the population of private hospitals. He further contended that private\nhospitals, which provided adequate care, refused to accept poor, black, involuntarily committed patients. He\nsought an end to what he labelled an invidiously \"sanist\" and racist two-tiered system of mental health care.\nWoe raised multiple legal issues, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against numerous defendants. First, he\nattacked the constitutionality of certain disparities in the award of Medicaid benefits to patients in private and\nState mental hospitals. Next, he asserted that the New York Mental Hygiene Law (\"MHL\") unconstitutionally failed\nto provide for a right to treatment and a means to enforce that right. Finally, and most significant to the current\nmotion, he claimed that an adequate standard of care could be achieved only if the care provided by the State\nmatched the care provided in private hospitals. This claim was grounded in the fourteenth amendment equal\nprotection and due process clauses.\nIn the course of ruling on discovery matters and defining the scope of litigation, orders on multiple motions have\nbeen issued which eliminated certain issues and addressed other matters still at issue in the case. In Woe v.\nMathews, 408 F.Supp. 419 (E.D.N.Y.1976),aff'd sub nom. Woe v. Weinberger, 562 F.2d 40 (2d Cir.),cert. denied,\n434 U.S. 1048, 98 S.Ct. 895, 54 L.Ed.2d 799 (1977), the Court dismissed the Medicaid claims against the federal\ndefendants as meritless based on the Supreme Court's summary affirmance in Legion v. Richardson, 354\n\nF.Supp. 456 (S.D.N.Y.), aff'd sub nom. Legion v. Weinberger, 414 U.S. 1058, 94 S.Ct. 564, 38 L.Ed.2d 465\n(1973),id. at 424-26; upheld the constitutionality of the New York State Mental Hygiene Law (\"MHL\") against an\n1160 inaccurate assertion that it failed to provide for a statutory right to treatment, id. at 426-28; and certified *1160 a\nclass comprised of \"all persons between the ages of 21 and 65 who are or will be involuntarily civilly committed to\nNew York State mental institutions.\" Id. at 429. Denying the State defendants' motions to dismiss the remaining\nclaims, the Court found that the plaintiff had stated two distinct constitutional claims which could not be summarily\ndismissed. Those claims, which remain the heart of this action, were described succinctly:\n\"Plaintiffs seek to end a self-styled `two-tiered' system of mental care in which, they allege, some\npersons, those voluntarily admitted to mental hospitals, receive care in equipped facilities and the\nremainder, involuntary committees, are condemned to custodial care in State mental institutions.\n\"They have constructed the following argument. An involuntarily committed mental patient has a\nright, under the due process clause, to adequate treatment.... Involuntarily civilly committed\npatients are only sent to State mental institutions; voluntary committees go to psychiatric facilities\nin general hospitals. Patients in State mental institutions do not receive adequate treatment;\npatients in general hospitals do receive treatment. Therefore patients in State mental institutions\nhave a right to be committed in general hospitals with adequate funds for treatment, or, at a\nminimum, to adequate care and treatment in State institutions.\" Id. at 428 (citation omitted).\nPlaintiffs' first claim was and is that the \"two-tiered\" system violates their rights under the equal protection clause\nby treating similarly situated mentally ill individuals differently. Plaintiffs sought originally and apparently persist in\ndesiring injunctive relief mandating \"a change in State practices in involuntary commitments from State\ninstitutions to other facilities,\" id., presumably private institutions. As this Court noted in its earlier order, however,\na mental patient does not have a constitutional right to be committed to a private, rather than a State, hospital.\nThus, only the narrower equal protection claim of whether the State is treating \"similarly situated mental patients\nin an evenhanded manner\" remains at issue in this case. Id. at 429.\nPlaintiffs' second claim then and now alleges that certain State hospitals, or possibly the State system in its\nentirety, provide constitutionally inadequate care, treatment, and facilities in violation of plaintiffs' due process\nrights. As this Court noted:\n\"Involuntary commitment to a mental hospital involving, as it does, a deprivation of liberty, must be\nscrutinized under the due process clause. O'Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U.S. 563, 95 S.Ct. 2486,\n2496, 45 L.Ed.2d 396 (1975). The right to a humane and safe living environment, Welsch v. Likins\n[373 F.Supp. 487] at 502-03, the right to the least restrictive alternative in confinement, id. at 501,\nthe right to be protected from harm, New York Association for Retarded Children, Inc. v.\nRockefeller [357 F.Supp. 752] at 764, and most recently, the constitutional obligation of the State\nnot to `confine without more a nondangerous individual who is capable of surviving safely in\nfreedom by himself' or with the help of others, O'Connor v. Donaldson, supra, 95 S.Ct. at 2494,\nhave each been recognized by courts for those civilly confined under State authority.\n\"... As a tentative formulation it would seem encumbent upon the State as confiner to minimize the\nmode of confinement, Welsch v. Likins, supra, and to employ whatever means are necessary,\nincluding such care and treatment as are reasonably possible in the circumstances of the case, to\npromote the speedy release and return to liberty of the person confined. The State defendants'\nmotions to dismiss the constitutional claims are therefore denied.\" Id. at 428-29 (footnote omitted).\nFinally, various motions to amend the complaint to add new plaintiffs, defendants, and causes of action were\ndismissed without prejudice. Most significantly, the joinder of a class of federal defendants based on the\n1161 allegation that the federal accreditation criteria used to determine whether patients *1161 received Social\nSecurity Income benefits was unconstitutional was denied because the program \"was different in nature and\npurpose than those which Woe has attacked, and [the claim involved] a class different from that which Woe\npurports to represent.\" Id. at 430. Also important to the present claims, a motion to add the JCAH and certain of\nits agents and a claim alleging that the JCAH denied plaintiffs their constitutional rights by utilizing disparate\naccreditation standards for public and private mental hospitals was denied because the Court found that \"this\n\nnew claim will be better examined in a separate action as it raises decidedly new issues and a different array of\ndefendants.\" Id.\nA year later, multiple procedural motions were resolved in a second, unpublished Order. Woe v. Mathews, 75 CV\n1029 (E.D. N.Y., Jan. 13, 1977). Plaintiffs had moved to consolidate the apparently related cases of Koe v.\nMathews, 76 CV 64, and Yoe v. Kolb, 75 CV 2178. The Court dismissed Koe as moot because the federal\n[3]\ndefendants had already rescinded the challenged termination of benefits. Id., slip op. at 4-5. The Court then\ndismissed the claims against the federal defendants in Yoe as barred by the first Woe decision, 408 F.Supp. at\n424-26, and by Legion, supra, id., slip op. at 3, and consolidated the claims against the State defendants into the\ninstant case. Id., slip op. at 7.\nPlaintiffs again sought to add new defendants and new causes of action, including a challenge to a State statute\nwhich denied the right to vote to institutionalized mental patients. Finding \"no valid reason for joinder,\" the\nproposed amendment was denied \"in the interests of orderly litigation and the forthright presentation of the\nproposed claim.\" Id., slip op. at 5. Plaintiffs also renewed and were again denied their previous motion to add the\nJCAH defendants. Id.\nFinally, defendants' motions to limit the class to patients at the Kingsboro Psychiatric Center, and plaintiffs' motion\nto enlarge the class to eliminate the age restrictions, were both denied \"pending clarification of the issues which\nwill form the essence of the action as discovery progresses.\" Id. The Second Circuit affirmed the order on March\n29, 1978. In the interim, only one conference was held, resulting in an indefinite adjournment of the case.\nThe case remained dormant until late February, 1980, when plaintiffs brought on an order to show cause why the\nKings Park Psychiatric Center should not be enjoined from further operations. This motion was precipitated by\nKings Park's loss of JCAH accreditation. Papers were filed by all parties. Plaintiffs' papers additionally requested\nan enlargement of the class; joinder as defendants of the directors of the three nonparty departments of the\nMental Health Information Services; certification of several defendant classes, including the directors of all State\nand private mental hospitals, the chairmen of all medical schools within the State, and all State court judges;\n[4]\nreconsideration of the constitutionality of the MHL;  reconsideration of the denial of the motion to amend the\n[5]\ncomplaint to add the right to vote issue and the defendants appropriate to that issue;  and reconsideration of\nthe denial of the motion to add the JCAH as a defendant and to assert new claims against the JCAH, all of which\ndefendants opposed.\n1162 *1162 On May 13, 1980, plaintiffs delivered a letter discussing, amidst numerous discovery matters, their\nintention to seek an injunction of the operation of Hudson River Psychiatric Center. A conference was held the\nnext day and discovery matters, procedural complications, and scope of the litigation were discussed at length.\nThe pending and proposed injunction motions and all related legal motions were held in abeyance to await the\noutcome of discovery and a more definitive focus of the case. See Transcript of Conference dated May 14, 1980.\nBoth the docket sheet and the transcripts of subsequent conferences depict a preoccupation by all parties with\ndiscovery and procedural matters for well over one year. In the interim, Kings Park and Hudson River apparently\nregained their accreditation. The status of certain other institutions was in flux as well.\nFinally, the parties appeared to focus on what they saw as remaining at issue in the case, and on May 24, 1982,\ndefendants filed this summary judgment motion, addressing essentially the same legal issues underlying the\npreliminary injunction motion. The Court established deadlines extending into November for opposing and reply\npapers, indicating an intention to decide finally the long-disputed applicable legal standard.\nIn response, however, the plaintiffs attempted to bring on yet another order to show cause as to why the Court\nshould not enjoin the operations of Manhattan Psychiatric Center, a State facility which had lost its JCAH\naccreditation and HHS certification, and South Beach Psychiatric Center, which had lost its HHS accreditation.\nGiven the numerous pending procedural motions and the anticipated clarification of the legal issues, the Court\nrefused to sign the order but did accept the papers for consideration.\nLegal issues raised and apparently resolved in earlier stages of this action nevertheless seem still to be\ncontested by the parties. This Court intends by this Order to resolve the numerous interrelated legal arguments\n\nraised now for the first time, raised earlier but held in abeyance, and raised for reconsideration despite earlier\nresolution.\nJCAH Accreditation\nPlaintiffs in their amended complaint assert that despite JCAH accreditation, New York State psychiatric centers\nare \"over-crowded, understaffed and [have] inferior physical facilities,\" and that these inadequacies must be\nremedied to ensure that patients \"will regain [their] health, and therefore [their] liberty as soon as possible.... and\nto assure that the staff of the State facility will have the time and skill to properly determine whether or not [a\npatient] needs to be admitted by involuntary commitment and when he can be discharged.\" Amended Complaint\n[6]\nat 4, 5. Each violation alleged by plaintiffs is addressed by one or more of the JCAH accreditation criteria.\nDefendants contend in this summary judgment motion that JCAH accreditation criteria equal or exceed the due\nprocess standard for adequate care. For the reasons that follow, the Court holds that the JCAH accreditation\ncriteria comport with or exceed due process requirements, and that JCAH accreditation is prima facie proof of\nadequate care.\n1163 *1163 The rights of the involuntarily committed have been recently considered by the Supreme Court. In \nYoungberg v. Romeo, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 2458, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982), the Court addressed\nwhether and to what extent an involuntarily committed mental retardate had \"liberty interests ... in safety, freedom\nof movement, and training.\" No question existed but that an involuntarily committed patient had a substantive due\nprocess right to \"adequate food, shelter, clothing, and medical care.\" Id. (footnote omitted). The Court held that\nan involuntarily committed mental retardate has a constitutionally guaranteed right to \"minimally adequate\ntraining\" to ensure his \"liberty interests in safety and freedom from unreasonable restraints.\" Id. at 2461.\nThe Court noted, however, that these liberty interests were not absolute, but had to be balanced with legitimate\nState interests. Recognizing the need for a standard by which courts could determine whether this balance had\nbeen properly struck, the Youngberg Court continued:\n\"In determining what is `reasonable' 00 in this and in any case presenting a claim for training by a\n97\nstate 00 we emphasize that courts must show deference to the judgment exercised by a qualified\n97\nprofessional. By so limiting judicial review of challenges to conditions in state institutions,\ninterference by the federal judiciary with the internal operations of these institutions should be\nminimized. Moreover, there certainly is no reason to think judges or juries are better qualified than\nappropriate professionals in making such decisions.... For these reasons, the decision, if made by\na professional, is presumptively valid; liability may be imposed only when the decision by the\nprofessional is such a substantial departure from accepted professional judgment, practice or\nstandards as to demonstrate that the person responsible actually did not base the decision on\nsuch a judgment.\" Id. at 2461-62 (footnotes and citations omitted).\nWhile Youngberg involved a single patient seeking damages, the instant class action seeks broad injunctive relief\nmandating minimally adequate conditions in the entire State mental health system. Regardless, the judgment of\npsychiatric professionals must still be viewed by this Court as presumptively valid, and judicial interference must\nbe minimized. Defendants have successfully demonstrated that JCAH accreditation constitutes such an exercise\nof professional judgment, and plaintiffs have not given the Court any reason to look further.\nThe JCAH hospital accreditation program began in 1952, evolving from the American College of Surgeons'\nnational hospital standardization program. JCAH 25th Anniversary Brochure, at 1-3, Exhibit C to Errion Aff.\n(hereinafter \"JCAH Brochure\"). The 20-member JCAH Board of Governors is selected by the American College\nof Physicians, the American College of Surgeons, the American Hospital Association, and the American Medical\nAssociation. Errion Aff. at 2. Although its accreditation program is voluntary, JCAH accreditation is required before\na facility will qualify for HHS funding. 42 U.S.C. § 1395x(f)(5).\n\nBy its own description, the JCAH \"provides a professionally recognized benchmark by which a facility may expect\nto be measured in its pursuit of excellence.\" JCAH Brochure at 4. Its criteria are designed to exceed minimally\nadequate standards:\n\"All Joint Commission standards are expected to have certain characteristics; they must be valid,\nthat is related to the quality of care or services provided; they must be optimal, reflecting the\nhighest state of the art; they must be achievable, meaning that compliance with them has been\ndemonstrated at an existing facility; and compliance with them must be measurable.\" Id. at 3\n(emphasis added).\nThe JCAH criteria encompass four broad categories: program management, patient management, patient\nservices, and physical plant management. JCAH Manual at vii. Periodic comprehensive evaluations by JCAH\n1164 surveyors, usually a psychiatrist and *1164 two additional professionals, examine numerous components of a\nfacility's operation under each of these broad categories. Errion Aff. at 4-5.\nThe team of surveyors' on-site inspections usually last three to five days. Id. at 5. Prior to and throughout a\nscheduled inspection, the surveyors solicit comments from the public, consumers, and staff. JCAH Manual at xiii.\nDuring an inspection the team of surveyors routinely interview staff members, and examine a randomly selected\ncrosssection of patient records. Errion Aff. at 5. At the conclusion of the inspection, a summation conference is\nheld between the surveyors and the hospital's staff and administration to discuss any deficiencies and to support\ncorrective measures. Id.\nA review of the surveyors' report and recommendations, and of all other relevant information, is made by the\nAccreditation Program for Psychiatric Facilities staff, which makes a final recommendation to the Board of\nCommissioners Accreditation Commission. Id. at 6. A final accreditation decision is based upon numerous\nconsiderations, including the facility's therapeutic environment, clinical staff, and medical records. Id. at 6-7.\nEssentially, JCAH accreditation must be supported by\n\"evidence of overall compliance with standards, progressive advancement toward more complete\ncompliance, and the absence of any serious impediments to patient safety or the quality of care.\" \nJCAH Brochure at 9.\nSeveral courts have cited the JCAH accreditation criteria as a valid measure of adequate care. For example, in \nEllen S. v. Rhodes, 507 F.Supp. 734 (S.D.Ohio 1981), plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to correct alleged\ninadequacies in an Ohio mental health center. Finding that the patients were receiving minimally adequate care\nand thus had not demonstrated irreparable harm, the court added: \"[T]he Center was accredited by the Joint\nCommission on Accreditation of Hospitals (JCAH), which indicates that said nationally recognized accrediting\nagency was satisfied that the Center was providing certain minimum requirements in patient care.\" Id. at 739.\nOther courts have similarly relied upon compliance with JCAH accreditation criteria as proof of constitutionally\nadequate conditions. See, e.g., Davis v. Hubbard, 506 F.Supp. 915, 920, 923 (N.D.Ohio 1980); Welsch v. Likins,\n373 F.Supp. 487, 503 (D.Minn.1974). In some instances, JCAH standards were held to exceed due process\nrequirements. See, e.g., Davis v. Balson, 461 F.Supp. 842, 853 (N.D.Ohio 1978).\nJCAH is a highly respected organization of psychiatric and medical professionals, and the value of its\naccreditation program has been recognized by Congress and the courts. Defendants' affidavits and exhibits\ndemonstrate that JCAH conducts comprehensive surveys of all aspects of the operations of a facility requesting\naccreditation, and that it reaches accreditation decisions after careful review and based upon valid and even\nadmirable standards. Plaintiffs have come forward with no factual assertions to prevent this Court from\nconcluding that due process standards are satisfied by JCAH accreditation criteria. In fact, plaintiffs' supporting\naffirmation itself concedes that JCAH accreditation and HHS certification are \"prima facie proof of adequacy.\"\nAffirmation of Morton Birnbaum, M.D., Esq., on behalf of Plaintiffs, at 21.\nPlaintiffs vehemently argue, however, that they should be allowed \"`to pierce the accreditation veil' when they can\npresent sufficient data of inadequate care to a court.\" Id. at 22. First, although they continuously maintain that\nvarious State psychiatric centers are not in compliance with due process mandates, plaintiffs have never clearly\n\narticulated what they believe to be \"adequate care.\" Additionally, plaintiffs have never presented any \"data\" to this\nCourt to indicate inadequate care. Instead, in their most recent papers, they state:\n\"Plaintiffs define the right to treatment objectively as at least requiring the same level of care and\nthe same per diem expenditures as that received by similarly afflicted socially advantaged patients\n1165 in voluntary general hospital in-patient psychiatric *1165 facilities in the same community.\"\nBirnbaum Affirmation at 20.\nThe Court agrees with defendants that plaintiffs' definition of a \"right to treatment\" is not supported in the law.\nSimilarly, although plaintiffs have repeatedly made comparisons between the funding of private facilities and the\nfunding of public facilities, these dollar amounts do not give rise to even an inference of the inadequacy of the\nlatter.\nA State has no duty under the Constitution to provide services to the mentally ill. New York Association for\nRetarded Children, Inc. v. Rockefeller, 357 F.Supp. 752, 761 (E.D.N.Y.1973); Welsch, 373 F.Supp. at 498; cf. \nDandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970). Involuntary commitment is a\njustifiable deprivation of liberty; the restrictions the State may impose on the freedom of the involuntarily\ncommitted is clearly limited, however, by their due process rights. Youngberg, 102 S.Ct. at 2458. Due process\nconsiderations require the State to provide minimally adequate services once it undertakes the care of the\ninvoluntarily committed. See New York Association for Retarded Children, Inc. v. Carey, 631 F.2d 162, 165 (2d\nCir.1980); Welsch, 373 F.Supp. at 499. This Court cannot say, however, that once the State chooses to fund\nmental hospitals, that it is required to budget its monies so as to meet the same degree of services as the private\nsector chooses to provide. See New York Association for Retarded Children, Inc., 631 F.2d at 165, 166 n. 3 (2d\nCir.1980); cf. Dandridge, 397 U.S. at 487, 90 S.Ct. at 1162. The question is whether the State services meet the\nConstitution's minimum standards, not whether the State hospitals match the quality of private institutions. See \nYoungberg, 102 S.Ct. at 2461 (\"whether the [patient's] constitutional rights have been violated must be\ndetermined by balancing his liberty interests against the relevant state interests\").\nFinally, plaintiffs have alleged no facts to show that JCAH accreditation is not the result of a careful evaluation\nprocess, but rather a mere \"veil\" hiding due process violations. Plaintiffs do point to two instances where JCAH\nawarded accreditation, but later reevaluated and withdrew the accreditation upon having certain inadequacies\ncalled to its attention. Birnbaum Affirmation at 22. These allegations do nothing to show that the JCAH\naccreditation criteria or procedures are not a valid measure of adequate care. On the contrary, these instances of\nreevaluation demonstrate that plaintiffs could challenge an invalid accreditation of an inadequate facility through\nrecourse to the JCAH itself.\nCircumstances may exist to warrant a court to inquire into whether a JCAH accreditation decision actually\nresulted from a valid exercise of professional judgment, or whether JCAH standards have fallen below what is\nneeded to ensure minimally adequate care. Plaintiffs simply have not come forward with any facts to justify such\nan inquiry at this time. On the contrary, defendants' undisputed supporting affidavits and exhibits demonstrate\nthat New York's compliance with JCAH accreditation criteria, as determined by a valid exercise of professional\njudgment of the impartial JCAH staff, necessitates a conclusion that the State has met its obligation of adequate\ncare under the due process clause.\nFurthermore, plaintiffs' repeated motions to add the JCAH and its agents as defendants and to amend the\ncomplaint to allege a claim of conspiratorial denial of due process rights by the JCAH has been twice denied, and\nis denied again. JCAH's practices in meeting its own standards and procedures were not within the original\ncontemplation of this action, and plaintiffs have long been on notice that redress on those grounds should be\nsought, if at all, in a separate action. See Woe, slip op. at 5; Woe, 408 F.Supp. at 430.\nLoss of JCAH Accreditation\nPlaintiffs have repeatedly argued that loss of JCAH accreditation or HHS certification demonstrates conclusively\nthat a facility is failing to provide adequate care. During the pendency of this suit, plaintiffs have sought\n1166 injunctions halting admissions *1166 to various nonaccredited or noncertified facilities. Recently, plaintiffs have\n\nadded a claim for damages on behalf of the class member State hospital residents for any period of\nnonaccreditation or noncertification. Because the parties have treated plaintiffs' argument for damages and their\nrenewed arguments for injunctive relief as implied cross-motions for partial summary judgment, the Court will\naddress the merits of this claim.\nWhile conformity with JCAH accreditation criteria may demonstrate compliance with due process standards, loss\nof JCAH accreditation or HHS certification does not necessitate a finding that the nonaccredited or noncertified\nfacility is inadequate. The due process clause acts to assure the involuntarily confined that the State will accord\nthem the necessities of life, reasonably safe conditions, reasonably nonrestrictive confinement, and minimally\nadequate training to protect their safety and freedom rights. Youngberg, 102 S.Ct. at 2462-63. Due process\nprotections look to the reasonableness and minimal adequacy; JCAH standards, in contrast, seek to establish\noptimum conditions in accredited facilities. JCAH Brochure at 3; see Davis, 461 F.Supp. at 853. JCAH standards\ncan be expected to demand more in many circumstances than due process would tolerate. Id.\nThe exact contours of a due process right to care and treatment have not been defined. Whether the State has\nfailed in its duty toward one patient, in one institution, or on a State-wide basis is essentially a factual question. \nSee, e.g., Davis v. Watkins, 384 F.Supp. 1196 (1974),supplemented sub nom. Davis v. Balson, 461 F.Supp. 842\n(1978),supplemented sub nom. Davis v. Hubbard, 506 F.Supp. 915 (N.D.Ohio 1980) (three-judge court).\nPlaintiffs have yet to come forward with any articulation of what they believe due process to mandate, other than\nto repeat the unsupportable position that the State is required to expend the same dollar amount as does the\nprivate sector. See Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint at 5, 7; Birnbaum Affirmation at 20; discussed supra. They\nhave alleged no facts which demonstrate that the State care and treatment is inadequate, but merely demand\nimmediate relief whenever the JCAH, a private organization, finds that a State facility is not meeting optimum\noperating standards. They decry \"unnecessary ... morbidity and mortality,\" e.g., Birnbaum Affirmation at 1, but\nthey fail to show that, after years of discovery, they are prepared to link the conceded unfortunate illness and\ndeath found in mental hospitals with inadequacies of a constitutional dimension.\nLoss of JCAH accreditation may signal operational inadequacies sufficient to warrant further judicial inquiry into\npossible due process violations. Plaintiffs' implied motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of whether\nloss of JCAH accreditation per se necessitates a finding of a denial of due process rights must, however, be\ndenied, and partial summary judgment must be granted to defendants. Furthermore, as noted, plaintiffs have\nbrought on injunctive motions to close various State hospitals alleging imminent due process deprivations. To the\nextent that those motions rest on the contention that loss of JCAH accreditation or HHS certification is a per se\ndenial of due process, or on the assertion that the State is constitutionally mandated to expend the same dollar\namount on a mental patient as does the private sector, those motions are denied as precluded by this grant of\npartial summary judgment.\nEqual Protection Clause\nIn addition to their broad due process contentions, plaintiffs have further attempted to support their preliminary\ninjunction motions on equal protection grounds. Plaintiffs assert that involuntarily committed mental patients are\ninvariably confined to State institutions, while voluntarily committed mental patients are admitted to better\nequipped private institutions. They state that involuntarily committed individuals are more often less wealthy and\n1167 members of racial minorities, and, therefore, *1167 they allege that the confinement of the involuntarily committed\nin State institutions violates the equal protection clause. Plaintiffs have argued that the Court should halt\nadmissions to State psychiatric centers because to continue such admissions is \"to invidiously segregate\n[plaintiffs] in an inadequate, separate, unequal and inferior lower tier of a two-tier New York mental hospital\nsystem.\" Plaintiffs' Papers in Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, at 2 (E.D.N.Y., filed in\nchambers on November 2, 1982).\nIn Union Carbide Agricultural Products Co. v. Costle, 632 F.2d 1014, 1017 (2d Cir.1980), the Second Circuit held:\n\"Before a preliminary injunction will be granted in this Circuit, it must pass one of two tests. Both\nrequire a showing of irreparable harm. One requires in addition that the moving party show a\nlikelihood of success on the merits. The other requires that there be sufficiently serious questions\n\ngoing to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation and a balance of hardships tipping\ndecidedly towards the moving party.\"\nFor the reasons that follow, this Court holds that plaintiffs' injunctive motions cannot meet either test. Plaintiffs\nmust fail under either test because they have failed to state a cognizable equal protection claim.\nAs this Court has repeatedly noted, central to plaintiffs' equal protection claim is a showing by plaintiffs that the\nState is discriminating among similarly situated mental patients. E.g., Woe, 408 F.Supp. at 429, discussed supra.\nUpon reviewing MHL's statutory criteria for voluntary and involuntary treatment, this Court concludes that the two\npatient groups are, quite simply, not similarly situated. The involuntarily committed patient presents different and\ngreater care and treatment concerns to the State, and ultimately to the institution in which he is confined, than\ndoes the less ill voluntary patient. These statutory distinctions also supply the obvious rational basis for the\nState's action.\nMHL provides a comprehensive system for the hospital admission of the mentally ill. This Court in its recent\nopinion in Project Release v. Prevost, 551 F.Supp. at 1300, had occasion to outline the standards and procedures\nfor voluntary and involuntary commitment:\n\"`[A]ny suitable person in need of care and treatment' may be admitted as a voluntarily committed\nmental patient upon that person's voluntary, written application. MHL § 9.13. `[P]erson in need of\ncare and treatment' is defined as someone who `has a mental illness for which in-patient care and\ntreatment in a hospital is appropriate.' MHL § 9.01. To be found `suitable,' a patient must be aware\nthat he is applying to a mental hospital, and must understand the consequences of voluntary\ncommitment; especially, the patient must comprehend the limitations governing release and the\npossibility that his status may be converted to involuntary commitment. MHL § 9.17(a).\n* * * * * *\n\"A person `alleged to be mentally ill and in need of involuntary care and treatment' may be a\ncandidate for involuntary commitment. MHL § 9.27(a). Someone `in need of involuntary care and\ntreatment' is a person who `has a mental illness for which care and treatment in a hospital is\nessential to such person's welfare and whose judgment is so impaired that he is unable to\nunderstand the need for such care and treatment.' MHL § 9.01.\n* * * * * *\n\"An involuntary commitment may also result if a director of community services or his designated\nphysician certifies that an individual `has an illness for which immediate care and treatment in a\nhospital is appropriate and which is likely to result in serious harm to himself or others.' MHL §\n9.37(a).\"\nBy statutory definition, a person made subject to involuntary commitment must suffer from mental illness to a\n1168 substantially more serious degree than does a person eligible for voluntary treatment. A voluntary *1168 patient\nmust appreciate the nature and consequences of his commitment; in contrast, an involuntarily committed\npatient's confinement is conditional upon his inability to comprehend the nature of his illness and his need for\ntreatment. Furthermore, in Project Release, 551 F.Supp. at 1301, this Court additionally found that MHL permits\ninvoluntary commitment when and only when a patient has been shown to be unable to survive safely without\nhospital care and treatment or when he poses a manifest danger to himself or others. These criteria anticipate an\nindividual who is far more ill than those patients capable of voluntarily committing themselves.\nThe differences in patient needs were noted by the three-judge district court in Legion in their holding that a\nfederal statute providing Medicaid and Medicare payments to some mental patients but not to others was not\nviolative of the equal protection clause. 354 F.Supp. at 459. Plaintiffs in Legion, who incidentally are represented\nby the same counsel as the plaintiff class in the instant case, had alleged that the patients denied benefits were\nmore likely to be poor blacks. The court rejected the significance of this argument, stating:\n\n\"They offer in support of this contention a bare statistical argument included in their brief, but they\npresent no proof of a racially discriminatory motive on the part of Congress and no proof of\ninvidious discrimination. We are sympathetic with Justice Marshall's caveat 00 that `at some point a\n97\nshowing that state action has a devastating impact on the lives of minority racial groups must be\nrelevant,' [Jefferson v. Hackney] 406 U.S. [535] at 575, 92 S.Ct. [1724] at 1745 [32 L.Ed.2d 285\n(1972)] (dissenting opinion); nevertheless, the majority opinion in Hackney, supra, has dictated\nthat `the standard of judicial review is not altered because of appellants' unproved allegations of\nracial discrimination.' 406 U.S. at 547, 92 S.Ct. at 1732. Here, the challenged legislation\ndistinguishes between medically indigent persons who require short-term care and those who\nrequire long-term care, and does not on its face discriminate against blacks or poor persons. We\ncannot, therefore, conclude that a patently invidious discrimination evolves from this\nclassification.\" Id.\nSimilarly, plaintiffs here have also done nothing more to support their allegations of a racially discriminatory\nmotive than to point to the statistical data detailed in their amended complaint. The State commitment practices\ndistinguish between voluntary and involuntary patients based upon the severity of their illnesses and the extent of\ntheir care and treatment needs. This Court has no reason to infer any invidiously discriminatory racial motivation\nfrom the nature of those practices.\nThis Court originally refused to dismiss plaintiffs' equal protection claim in Woe, 408 F.Supp. at 428-29, to afford\nthem the opportunity to develop support for their contention that some mental patients received a lower level of\ncare by the State than other similarly situated mental patients. After years of litigation, however, plaintiffs do no\nmore now than repeat a patently insufficient allegation that the State is required to treat the involuntarily\ncommitted State patient in the same manner as the private sector treats the voluntary patient. Plaintiffs have thus\nnot only failed to show that their equal protection claim is likely to succeed on the merits, they cannot show that\ntheir claim can succeed at all. Their equal protection claim is accordingly dismissed and their demands for\ninjunctive relief denied.\nClass Status\nThe complexion of this action has changed dramatically since Woe filed his complaint on June 27, 1975. Woe\noriginally complained of conditions in one psychiatric center, and attributed the alleged inadequacies primarily to\nthe lack of Medicaid funding. As the focus of the case shifted to address the alleged equal protection and due\nprocess violations which purportedly permeated the State system, the issues appeared to touch on the needs of\n1169 a statewide class of plaintiffs. See Woe, 408 F.Supp. at 428-29. Recently, however, plaintiffs have *1169 sought\nin this case a means of vindicating any alleged deficiency in care at each specific State facility.\nThe JCAH accreditation criteria has been found to meet or exceed due process standards. Also, plaintiffs have\nalleged no facts sufficient to defeat a grant of summary judgment to defendants holding that all State facilities\nwhich are JCAH accredited are also in compliance with plaintiffs' due process rights. The only issue remaining in\nthis action is whether a non-JCAH accredited facility can be found to have fallen below the standards of minimum\ncare guaranteed by the due process clause. This issue turns on facts unique to a given facility, measured against\nminimum due process standards. Common questions concerning class members are therefore no longer present\nin this action.\nThe conclusion is inescapable that continued maintenance of this class action in its present form would not serve\nthe purposes of Rule 23, F.R.Civ.P., and would embroil this Court in a clearly unmanageable monitoring of the\nentire State mental health system. Indeed, addressing due process violations in only one State mental hospital\nhas involved courts in \"considerable attention to the details of the operation\" of a State facility. New York\nAssociation for Retarded Children, Inc., 631 F.2d at 166 n. 3. A class action employed as a vehicle to vindicate\nalleged violations in every State facility in a system as extensive as New York's mental health program would\nneedlessly burden a single district court and would not afford the parties the most effective relief.\n\nHere, redress of rights for each facility within the State system was not contemplated either in the original\namended complaint or in the grant of class certification. The amended complaint addressed only the alleged\ninadequacies of Kingsboro Psychiatric Center; nothing in the record indicates that Kingsboro has failed to be\n[7]\nJCAH accredited throughout the pendency of this action.  At the time the class was certified, at issue were\nbroad allegations that State policy violated due process and equal protection rights. Woe, 408 F.Supp. at 428-29.\nContinuing this litigation to engage in a facility-by-facility due process analysis would simply require this Court to\npermit another implied amendment of the complaint. At some point a litigation has to end. In view of the Court's\ndismissal of all existing claims and related motions, that point has been reached here.\nAccordingly, all original issues having been resolved, this class action is dismissed.\nSO ORDERED.\n[1] Plaintiffs have also raised allegations of constitutional inadequacy of conditions in a facility that loses Health\nand Human Services (\"HHS\") certification. In light of the findings made herein concerning JCAH accreditation,\nand because HHS certification itself is dependent upon JCAH accreditation, 42 U.S.C. § 1395x(f), it is\nunnecessary to reach the issues concerning loss of HHS certification.\n[2] The record indicates that Woe is now deceased.\n[3] The Social Security Administration had originally indicated that certain benefits to residents of Pilgrim\nPsychiatric Center would be terminated because of the loss of JCAH accreditation. The Court had previously\ndenied plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order seeking to prevent the agency from notifying residents\nof the proposed termination. Woe v. Mathews, 75 CV 1029 (E.D.N.Y., November 21, 1975). Joinder of this claim\nand its additional defendants was then denied in Woe, 408 F.Supp. 419 at 430, discussed supra. In the interim,\nthe agency decided to continue the funds.\n[4] This part of the motion to reconsider must be denied in light of this Court's decision in Project Release v.\nPrevost, 551 F.Supp. 1298 (E.D.N.Y.1982).\n[5] The Court adheres to its prior decision on this issue. Woe v. Mathews, 75 CV 1029, slip op. at 5 (E.D.N.Y.,\nJanuary 13, 1977).\n[6] JCAH publishes a detailed statement of its accreditation criteria. JCAH Consolidated Standards Manual\n(hereinafter \"JCAH Manual\"), Exhibit B to Affidavit of Gerald Errion on behalf of Defendants (hereinafter \"Errion\nAff.). One major category of JCAH accreditation criteria addresses the management of each patient's needs and\nprogress, and a second category details the types of services which must be provided and the acceptable forms\nthese services may take. Id. at 61-132. The specific controls imposed on quality, quantity, size and space\nthroughout these two categories make it impossible for a facility JCAH found to be overcrowded to meet JCAH\nstandards. Similarly, a third category broadly addresses program management and monitors in detail the size,\nqualifications, and continued development of a facility's staff. Id. at 3-59. Concern for an adequate physical plant\nand an appropriate therapeutic environment permeates the criteria addressing patient services, id. at 61-132, and\na fourth category separately regulates physical plant management. Id. at 133-59.\n[7] In fact, the record demonstrates that all facilities within the Eastern District of New York are presently JCAH\naccredited.

Gen., of the State of New York, O.\nPeter Sherwood, Sol. Gen., New York City, of counsel), for defendants-appellees.\nBefore TIMBERS, PIERCE, and MINER, Circuit Judges.\nPER CURIAM:\nDr. Morton Birnbaum, Esq., and Burton Zuckerman, Esq., have brought this appeal on behalf of members of a\nclass of persons between the ages of 21 and 65 who are involuntarily civilly committed in the Bronx Psychiatric\nCenter (the \"BPC\"). Appellants challenge an order of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of\nNew York (Bartels, Judge) approving the settlement of this action insofar as it related to the BPC. See Foe v.\nCuomo, 700 F.Supp. 107 (E.D.N.Y.1988). Birnbaum and Zuckerman served as class counsel for a number of\nyears in this lengthy class action litigation. They purport, on behalf of appellants, to appeal from orders in which\nJudge Bartels found that they had withdrawn from their representation of the plaintiff class and barred them from\nintervening in the action on behalf of Wilma Woe, the mother of the original, now-deceased, lead plaintiff, and\nT.C.L., the mother of R.L., a patient at the BPC.\n198 *198 Assuming appealability, the question of whether the district judge abused his discretion in supervising the\ncounsel before him must be considered in light of the judge's obligation to insure that the plaintiff class is\nadequately represented throughout the litigation. See Cullen v. New York State Civil Service Comm'n, 435\nF.Supp. 546, 563-64 (E.D.N.Y.), appeal dismissed,566 F.2d 846, 848-49 (2d Cir.1977); Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(d); 1 H.\nNewberg, Newberg on Class Actions § 1.07, at 10 (2d ed.1985). To the extent it is claimed that Birnbaum and\nZuckerman had been barred, de facto, from representing the class, we do not believe the district judge exceeded\nthe bounds of his authority and responsibility to supervise counsel. Furthermore, in later determining that\nBirnbaum and Zuckerman had withdrawn from representing the class, the district judge was entitled to rely upon\nthe representation of their co-counsel that this had indeed occurred. We also note that following the district\njudge's decision replacing them as class counsel, Birnbaum and Zuckerman did not attempt to participate in the\ncase for approximately eleven months.\nWhile the district judge may have erred in not permitting Birnbaum and Zuckerman to re-enter the case formally\nto represent the interests of R.L., see Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(d)(2); 7B C. Wright, A. Miller & M. Kane, Federal Practice\n\nand Procedure § 1799, at 441-46 (1986) (urging liberal consideration of motions to intervene in class actions), we\nsee little prejudice to R.L. Indeed, after Birnbaum and Zuckerman indicated a desire \"to participate as co-counsel,\nto review any proposed settlement and ... to inform the court and other plaintiffs' counsel as to what we believe is\njust and proper for our clients,\" they were invited to participate at the hearing on the settlement and they\nsubmitted written objections which were considered by the district judge.\nWith respect to the class settlement itself, the district judge carefully considered and evaluated the settlement in\nlight of the factors set forth in this court's precedents. While the settlement did not incorporate Judge Neaher's\nprevious \"finding\" that the BPC would be overcrowded when holding a population of 580 patients, Woe v. Cuomo,\n638 F.Supp. 1506, 1515 (E.D.N.Y.1986), appellants fail to recognize that the context of the litigation had\nsubstantially changed by the time the settlement was reached. The most significant change was the\nreaccreditation of the BPC by the Joint Committee on Accreditation of Hospitals.\nAppellants further argue that this settlement is not as beneficial as the settlement reached in a similar case in\nanother district. While comparisons between similar actions may be helpful in addressing whether a settlement is\nfair, it is important to recognize distinctions between such actions. Moreover, since the ultimate question is\nwhether this settlement was reasonable under the circumstances, a district judge is not required to make such a\ncomparison. We conclude that the district judge did not abuse his discretion in approving the settlement which\nwas reached by experienced counsel through arm's length negotiations.\nWhile Birnbaum and Zuckerman have yet to submit a fee application, they urge that the matter be remanded to a\ndifferent district judge for consideration of such an application. We see no reason to apply this \"extraordinary\nremedy,\" Sobel v. Yeshiva Univ., 839 F.2d 18, 37 (2d Cir.1988), and we are confident that Judge Bartels will fully\nand fairly evaluate any application which is made by Birnbaum and Zuckerman.\nWe have considered appellants' remaining arguments and believe them to be without merit. The orders of the\ndistrict court are AFFIRMED.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Gen., New\nYork City.\n422  MEMORANDUM AND ORDER\n*422\nNEAHER, District Judge.\nThis individual and class action concerns the constitutionality of federal and New York State statutes and State\npractices affecting persons civilly committed to involuntary confinement in State mental institutions. Since the\ninception of the action plaintiffs have filed one amended complaint and have sought leave to amend the\ncomplaint to add new individual and classes of defendants, new classes of plaintiffs and new claims for relief, and\ndefendants have filed motions to dismiss. In order to keep the myriad claims and potential parties as distinct as\npossible the court will first deal with the matters relating to the original amended complaint.\nI.\n[1]\nPlaintiffs Walter Woe and Wilma Woe, his mother and guardian,  seek to represent patients between the ages\nof 21 and 65 who are involuntarily civilly committed in public mental institutions. As the court understands the\nallegations in the complaint, plaintiffs raise the following claims for relief:\n(1) Woe raises a two-prong constitutional claim against the State defendants. First, Woe claims that as an\ninvoluntarily civilly committed mental patient he has a constitutional right to treatment and that his confinement in\na State mental institution which affords him only custodial care violates his rights under the equal protection and\ndue process clauses. Second, Woe claims that, as part of the right to treatment, he has a constitutional right to\nconfinement in a general hospital which provides psychiatric services and not merely in a public institution which\n[2]\nprovides purely custodial care.\n(2) Woe alleges the unconstitutionality of a State statute against the State defendants. Specifically, Woe attacks\nprovisions of the New York State Mental Hygiene Law for failure to require \"adequate active care and treatment\"\n[3]\nand to provide a means to enforce the alleged right to treatment.\n(3) Woe alleges the unconstitutionality of the federal Medicaid statute against the federal defendants. Specifically,\nWoe claims that the exclusion of inmates of State mental institutions who are between the ages of 21 and 65\n[4]\nfrom the benefits of Medicaid coverage, 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a), is unconstitutional.\n\nPlaintiffs requested declaratory judgments as to the unconstitutionality of (a) State practices in involuntary\ncommitments, (b) the pertinent provisions of the State Mental Hygiene Law, and (c) the Medicaid exclusions for\npatients in State mental hospitals, and preliminary and permanent injunctions to enforce the declaratory\n[5]\njudgments.\nPlaintiffs' motion for class certification was denied without prejudice to renew pending the determination whether\na three-judge court should be convened pursuant to the demand for injunctions against enforcing the federal and\n[6]\nState statutes.  Plaintiffs now assert that they have abandoned their demands for injunctive relief and seek only\ndeclaratory judgments from this court. Therefore, they argue, a single judge may adequately dispose of their\nclaims, strongly urging that nothing impedes class certification.\n423 *423 Despite plaintiffs' arguments, the court is not convinced that plaintiffs have abandoned the injunction\n[7]\naspects of their case. They explicitly request convening a three-judge court in their complaint.  They continue to\n[8]\nask that \"preliminary and permanent injunctions be entered enforcing these declaratory and other judgments.\"\nIn contrast, see Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144, 83 S.Ct. 554, 9 L.Ed.2d 644 (1963) (single judge\nmay grant non-coercive declaratory relief). They also seek mandamus, a form of injunction, in the nature of\n[9]\ncompelling an officer of the United States to perform a duty, 28 U.S.C. § 1361.  The court notes that Kantrowitz\nv. Weinberger, 388 F.Supp. 1127 (D.D.C.1974), which also tested the constitutionality of Medicaid exclusions,\nwas an action \"in the nature of mandamus and for declaratory judgment\" and was decided by a three-judge court.\n[10]\nFinally, in a related pending motion,  plaintiffs have already come into court for a temporary restraining order\nagainst the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) on grounds of unconstitutionality of a federal\nstatute and have asserted they will seek a preliminary injunction in that matter. The court is compelled to\nconclude that plaintiffs are using the declaratory judgment mechanism merely as a label and are actually seeking\ninjunctions against enforcement of federal and State statutes. Thus, this remains an action in which a three-judge\ncourt may be required.\nEven assuming, however, that plaintiffs are correct and a statutory court is unnecessary, defendants have raised\nissues in their motions to dismiss which, if decided in their favor, would obviate any necessity for a three-judge\ncourt. A single judge, in any case, may determine\n\"(1) whether the constitutional question is substantial; (2) whether the complaint at least formally\nalleges a basis for equitable relief; and (3) whether the case comes within the requirement of the\nthree-judge statute.\" Abele v. Markle, 452 F.2d 1121, 1125 (2 Cir. 1971).\nThus the court turns to a consideration of federal and State defendants' motions to dismiss the complaint.\nA. Federal Defendants' Motions to Dismiss\n[11]\nIn his claim against the federal defendants,  plaintiff Woe, a 26-year old inmate of Brooklyn State Hospital, a\nNew York State mental institution, attacks the exclusion of inmates of State institutions who are between the ages\nof 21 and 65 from Medicaid coverage, Title XIX of the Social Security Act as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a).\nThat section defines \"medical assistance\" for purposes of State eligibility for Medicaid payments in such a way as\nto provide reimbursement for services in mental institutions only for patients who are under age 21 or 65 or older.\n424 [12] Thus patients, *424 such as the plaintiff, who are between 21 and 65 are ineligible for medical assistance\nunder the Medicaid statute. In contrast to the provisions excluding mental institutions, the statute does permit\nmedical assistance to individuals, otherwise eligible, for psychiatric services received in general hospitals\nirrespective of age. It is this \"discrimination\" between patients in State mental institutions not receiving Medicaid\nfunds and those in psychiatric facilities in general hospitals, or other Medicaid covered programs, of which\nplaintiffs chiefly complain.\nThe federal defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds, inter alia, that plaintiffs' case is\nforeclosed by controlling precedent and the complaint should be dismissed for lack of a substantial federal\nquestion. Defendants to succeed must establish that plaintiffs' claims are \"constitutionally insubstantial,\" because\n\n\"prior decisions inescapably render the claims frivolous.\" Goosby v. Osser, 409 U.S. 512, 518, 93 S.Ct. 854, 859,\n35 L.Ed.2d 36 (1973); Maggett v. Norton, 519 F.2d 599, 602 (2 Cir. 1975); Brook Hollow Associates v. J. E.\nGreene, Inc., 389 F.Supp. 1322, 1327 (D.Conn.1975).\nThe court believes the federal defendants have met their burden, for as stated by them, \"this case is on all fours,\nfactually and legally, with Legion v. Richardson, 354 F.Supp. 456 (S.D.N.Y.1973),affirmed sub nom. Legion v.\nWeinberger, 414 U.S. 1058, 94 S.Ct. 564, 38 L.Ed.2d 465 (1973) [hereinafter \"Legion\"]; and Legion is itself a\n[13]\nbinding precedent on this court.\"\nContrary to plaintiffs' assertions, it is the rule of this circuit that a summary affirmance by the United States\nSupreme Court of a case within its obligatory appellate jurisdiction is precedent binding on a lower federal court. \nMercado v. Rockefeller, 502 F.2d 666, 673 (2 Cir. 1974); Doe v. Hodgson, 344 F.Supp. 964 (S.D.N.Y.1972),aff'd,\n[14]\n478 F.2d 537 (2 Cir. 1973),applic. dismissed & reaff'd, 500 F.2d 1206 (2 Cir. 1974).\nA summary affirmance is a decision on the merits of the issues on appeal, Ohio ex rel. Eaton v. Price, 360 U.S.\n246, 247, 79 S.Ct. 978, 3 L.Ed.2d 1200 (1959); Mercado v. Rockefeller, supra, although not necessarily an\naffirmance of the rationale by which the decision was reached, Fusari v. Steinberg, 419 U.S. 379, 95 S.Ct. 533,\n541, 42 L.Ed.2d 521 (1975) (Burger, C. J., concurring). Even though the Supreme Court itself might give a prior\nsummary affirmance less precedential value than an opinion of that Court treating the question on the merits, \nEdelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 1359 & n. 14, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974), it does not follow that a\nlower court is free to disregard the decision. Instead this privilege lies with the Supreme Court alone. Doe v.\nHodgson, supra, 500 F.2d at 1207-08.\nThus if Legion v. Richardson is a decision squarely on point, the affirmance of the dismissal of that complaint\n425 renders the plaintiffs' case so insubstantial that *425 it must be dismissed. Plaintiffs have argued that Legion is\ndistinguishable in that the class to be represented and the claims raised by Woe are different and the standard\napplied in Legion, in light of new \"evidence,\" was erroneous. The court cannot agree with plaintiffs that Legion is\neither factually or legally distinguishable.\nLegion was an attack on equal protection and due process grounds of the exclusion of State mental patients from\nboth Medicare and Medicaid benefits. John Legion was an inmate of Brooklyn State Hospital who, with other\nplaintiffs, sought to represent the class of all mentally ill Americans confined in public institutions, including both\nthe mentally ill and retarded. Woe likewise is an inmate of Brooklyn State Hospital, but plaintiffs have pared down\n[15]\nthe prospective class to consist only of those between ages 21 and 65 in State mental hospitals. Legion\nalleged the unconstitutionality of both Medicare and Medicaid; Woe challenges the Medicaid exclusion alone. It is\n[16]\nnonetheless clear that the class and claims presented by Woe are no more than subsets of those in Legion.\nThe essential elements of Legion and Woe are identical 00 constitutional attacks on an exclusion based on\n97\ninstitutional status and type of disease. See Kantrowitz v. Weinberger, supra, at 1129.\nIn holding the challenged federal legislation constitutionally valid and dismissing the complaint on the merits, \nLegion applied the standard of review when a public welfare legislative classification is attacked, stating:\n\"Where a statutory classification is not conceived on peculiarly suspect grounds such as wealth or\nrace, all that is constitutionally required is that the challenged classification or restriction bear a\nreasonable relationship with the objectives sought to be fulfilled by the legislation. See, e. g., \nMcDonald v. Board of Elections Com'rs. of Chicago, 394 U.S. 802, 89 S.Ct. 1404, 22 L.Ed.2d 739\n(1969).\" Legion v. Richardson, supra, at 459.\nThe court then reasoned that a rational justification for the exclusions could be found in the Congressional\ndetermination that care of the mentally ill in State institutions was within the traditional purview of the States and\nshould remain so. Id. See U.S.Code Cong. & Admin. News, pp. 2084-87 (1965). The classification, even if\nimperfect, see Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970), was nonetheless\nfound constitutional. Id.\nPlaintiffs have now come forward to argue that Legion applied the wrong standard of review in that the Medicaid\nexclusion results in arbitrary and invidious discrimination against the poor and the black and assert that there\n\nexists evidence in the form of medical and sociological data, not available when Legion was decided, that the\n[17]\nstatute discriminates against the socially disadvantaged.  It does not appear to this court, however, that\nplaintiffs' contentions are any more substantial than those presented in Legion. Plaintiffs do not assert a racially\n426 discriminatory motive on the part of Congress, see Jefferson v. Hackney, 406 U.S. 535, 92 S.Ct. 1724, 32 *426\nL.Ed.2d 285 (1972), nor is it the function of this court to consider anew the rational judgment of Congress and to\nrequire reexamination of a precedent so squarely controlling as is Legion. See Doe v. Hodgson, supra, 344\nF.Supp. at 968. Where, as here and as set forth in Legion, \"the challenged legislation distinguishes between\nmedically indigent persons who require short-term care and those who require long-term care, and does not on\nits face discriminate against blacks or poor persons [the court cannot] conclude that a patently invidious\ndiscrimination evolves from this classification.\" Id. at 459.\nTo paraphrase Judge Frankel in Doe v. Hodgson, supra, 344 F.Supp. at 968, \"[h]owever it might be viewed as a\nlegislative proposition, and however it might fare were it a new question for the courts, plaintiffs' complaint is\ndefeated by the decision\" in Legion v. Weinberger, 414 U.S. 1058, 94 S.Ct. 564, 38 L.Ed.2d 465 (1973),\nsummarily affirming Legion v. Richardson, 354 F.Supp. 456 (S.D.N.Y.1973). Plaintiffs' federal claims are therefore\nrendered insubstantial and the federal defendants' motions to dismiss that part of the amended complaint will be\ngranted.\nB. State Defendants' Motions to Dismiss\nThe original amended complaint names the State of New York and the following State officials as defendants: the\nGovernor of New York, the Commissioner of New York State Department of Mental Hygiene and the Director of\nBrooklyn State Hospital. Plaintiffs raise therein both (1) the constitutionality of a State statute, the New York\nMental Hygiene Law, and (2) purely constitutional claims revolving around a \"right to treatment.\"\nAt the outset the State defendants contend that plaintiffs' allegations are specious in that plaintiffs' sole\nsubstantial complaint is the deprivation of Medicaid payments under the alleged constitutionally defective\n[18]\nMedicaid exclusion of mental institutions.  It is true that plaintiffs couple the alleged failure of the State to\nprovide adequate treatment of State mental patients with inadequate funding and emphasize that the availability\nof Medicaid to mental institutions would provide the State with the requisite funds, ipso facto raising the standard\nof care. Nevertheless, it cannot be said that plaintiffs have abandoned their claims that the State itself has the\nconstitutional obligation to provide whatever is necessary to insure adequate and active care to individuals it has\n[19]\nvoluntarily committed to State hospitals.  Hence, it would be unfounded to identify these claims as illusory.\nThe State defendants also contend that plaintiff Woe is petitioning for a writ of habeas corpus and therefore must\nfirst exhaust available State remedies. Plaintiffs, however, do not contest the appropriateness of civil commitment\nby reason of mental illness and their claims more properly are characterized as actions to protect their\nconstitutional rights, violated by defendants under color of law, for which they need not first seek redress in a\nState forum. 42 U.S.C. § 1983. See Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973).\n1. Unconstitutionality of New York Mental Hygiene Law\nPlaintiffs' initially considered claim against the State defendants asserts that\n\"Articles 13, 15, 31 and 35 of the New York Mental Hygiene Law [NYMHL] are unconstitutional as\napplied to Woe and other involuntarily civilly committed inmates of state mental hospitals as these\n427 statutes neither provide nor require the constitutionally required *427 minimally adequate active\n[20]\ncare and treatment.\"\nPreliminarily, the court must again determine when the unconstitutionality of a State statute has been alleged\nwhether a three-judge court is required. If injunctive relief is sought on the ground that a statute cannot\nconstitutionally be enforced against a particular person or group, the statutory court must be convened. See \nDept. of Employment v. United States, 385 U.S. 355, 87 S.Ct. 464, 17 L.Ed.2d 414 (1966). But if State officials\n\nhave misapplied State law by \"reason of misconstruction or have exceeded their powers, a single judge may\nhandle the issue.\" Rakes v. Coleman, 318 F.Supp. 181, 189 (E.D.Va. 1970). Plaintiffs have not stated a\nsubstantial claim with respect to the constitutionality of the statute. Although couched in terms of constitutional\ndefects, any viable claim under the Mental Hygiene Law would necessarily rest on the second ground. Plaintiffs\nhave not raised this issue.\nPlaintiffs first deplore the absence of a statutory right to treatment, and argue its absence makes the law\nunconstitutional. As the State defendants point out, any constitutional right would exist irrespective of the\nstatutory provision. See Welsch v. Likins, 373 F.Supp. 487 (D.Minn.1974). Moreover, the State defendants have\n[21]\nin fact admitted there exists a right to treatment in the statute, NYMHL §§ 15.01, 15.03.  It also appears to the\ncourt that NYMHL § 15.03 does exhibit a legislative intention to provide treatment to the mentally ill, even if the\ncontours of that right have not been concretely defined. That section provides:\n\"Each patient in a facility and each person receiving services for mental disability shall receive\ncare and treatment that is suited to his needs and skillfully, safely, and humanely administered\nwith full respect for his dignity and personal integrity.\" NYMHL § 15.03(a).\nThe statute further imposes upon the Department of Mental Hygiene \"the responsibility for seeing that\" the\nmentally ill, among others within its jurisdiction,\n\"are provided with care and treatment, that such care and treatment is of high quality and\neffectiveness, and that the personal and civil rights of persons receiving care and treatment are\nadequately protected.\" NYMHL § 7.05(c).\nNew York courts in similar contexts have ruled this provision incorporates a right to treatment. Renelli v.\nDepartment of Mental Hygiene, 73 Misc.2d 261, 340 N.Y.S.2d 498, 500 (Sup.Ct.1973) (mentally retarded child); \nIn re S, 78 Misc.2d 351, 356 N.Y.S.2d 768 (Fam.Ct. 1974) (dangerous mentally ill child); and have recognized\nthat \"[b]y provisions of Constitution and statute (N.Y.Const., art. XVII, § 4; new Mental Hygiene Law, § 1.03 et\nseq.; . . .), the State is responsible for the `care, treatment, rehabilitation, education, and training of the mentally\nill'.\" Kesselbrenner v. Anonymous, 33 N.Y.2d 167, 350 N.Y.S.2d 889, 893, 305 N.E.2d 903 (Ct.App.1973)\n(dangerously mentally ill). See also Usen v. Sipprell, 71 Misc.2d 633, 336 N.Y. S.2d 848 (Sup.Ct.1972).\nThe plaintiffs also assert that the statute lacks any enforcement mechanism, and therefore the \"right to treatment\"\n[22]\nis merely precatory.  It is sufficient to note the existence of possible statutory enforcement means: (1) an\nArticle 78 Proceeding, CPLR §§ 7801-04; see Renelli v. Dept. of Mental Hygiene, supra; and (2) Habeas Corpus,\nNYMHL § 15.15; even assuming plaintiffs are correct, and it is doubtful, that NYMHL §§ 13.19, 13.21, which\nprovides that\n428 *428 \"No individual who is or appears to be mentally disabled shall be detained, deprived of his\nliberty, or otherwise confined without lawful authority, or inadequately, unskillfully, cruelly, or \nunsafely cared for or supervised by any person.\" NYMHL § 13.19(a) (emphasis supplied).\nand which provides for enforcement of this section by an action in New York State Supreme Court, NYMHL §\n13.21, is inadequate.\nThe New York Mental Hygiene Law does afford the \"right to care and treatment\" for the mentally ill by explicit\nprovision and New York Law does provide and has been employed to enforce that right. Plaintiffs have thus failed\nto sufficiently allege a claim for relief on the asserted grounds of unconstitutionality of the New York statute.\n2. Constitutional Claims\nThe court now comes to what it conceives to be the heart of plaintiffs' case. Plaintiffs seek to end a self-styled\n\"two-tiered\" system of mental care in which, they allege, some persons, those voluntarily admitted to mental\nhospitals, receive care in equipped facilities and the remainder, involuntary committees, are condemned to\ncustodial care in State mental institutions.\n\nThey have constructed the following argument. An involuntarily committed mental patient has a right, under the\ndue process clause, to adequate treatment. Wyatt v. Stickney, 325 F.Supp. 781 (M.D.Ala.1971),implemented in\n344 F.Supp. 373 (1972); aff'd sub nom. Wyatt v. Aderholt, 503 F.2d 1305 (5 Cir. 1975). Involuntarily civilly\ncommitted patients are only sent to State mental institutions; voluntary committees go to psychiatric facilities in\ngeneral hospitals. Patients in State mental institutions do not receive adequate treatment; patients in general\nhospitals do receive treatment. Therefore patients in State mental institutions have a right to be committed in\ngeneral hospitals with adequate funds for treatment, or, at a minimum, to adequate care and treatment in State\ninstitutions.\nAt bottom this court understands that plaintiffs seek to obtain treatment allegedly not now provided by the State\nby (1) the State's assumption of the burden to improve care and provide treatment in State institutions, equalizing\nthe standard of psychiatric care between those confined within and without State institutions, or (2) a change in\nState practices in involuntary commitments from State institutions to other facilities, namely those which provide\ntreatment.\nThe court finds no basis in law for the allegation that, without more, involuntary committees possess the\nconstitutional right not to be committed to State mental institutions, if the State is not discriminating between\nsimilarly situated mentally ill individuals in its provision of services or funds. New York State is not constitutionally\nmandated to provide services to its citizens. Cf. Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 25 L.Ed.2d\n491 (1970). New York Association for Retarded Children, Inc. v. Rockefeller, 357 F.Supp. 752, 761\n(E.D.N.Y.1973); see Welsch v. Likins, supra, at 498. But when a State does assume the burden of providing care\nfor a dependent group, such as the mentally ill, it cannot consonant with the equal protection clause discriminate\namong those similarly situated mentally ill. See New York Association for Retarded Children, Inc. v. Rockefeller,\nsupra, at 762; cf. Montoroula v. Parry, 373 N.Y.S.2d 980 (Sup.Ct.1975).\nInvoluntary commitment to a mental hospital, involving, as it does, a deprivation of liberty, must be scrutinized\nunder the due process clause. O'Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U.S. 563, 95 S.Ct. 2486, 2496, 45 L.Ed.2d 396\n(1975). The right to a humane and safe living environment, Welsch v. Likins, supra at 502-03, the right to the\nleast restrictive alternative in confinement, id., at 501, the right to be protected from harm, New York Association\n429 for Retarded Children, Inc. v. Rockefeller, supra, at 764, *429 and, most recently, the constitutional obligation of\nthe State not to \"confine without more a nondangerous individual who is capable of surviving safely in freedom by\nhimself\" or with the help of others, O'Connor v. Donaldson, supra, 95 S.Ct. at 2494, have each been recognized\n[23]\nby courts for those civilly confined under State authority.\nWhether the State of New York has met its constitutional obligations, whether it has treated similarly situated\nmental patients in an evenhanded manner, and whether it has provided adequate conditions in confinement are\nissues which cannot be summarily determined. As a tentative formulation it would seem encumbent upon the\nState as confiner to minimize the mode of confinement, Welsh v. Likins, supra, and to employ whatever means\nare necessary, including such care and treatment as are reasonably possible in the circumstances of the case, to\npromote the speedy release and return to liberty of the person confined. The State defendants' motions to\ndismiss the constitutional claims are therefore denied.\nC. Class Action Certification\nPlaintiffs have cast this suit in the form of a class action and have repeatedly urged that certification as such be\ngranted. F.R.Civ.P. 23. Having determined that a three-judge court is not required in this matter, plaintiffs' motion\nis now properly before this court for determination. The class sought to be represented is that of \"involuntarily\n[24]\ncivilly committed mental hospital patients and their guardians.\"  Plaintiffs argue a class action is necessary to\nremove any possibility of mootness and to assure that not only will plaintiff Woe be benefited but all those who\n[25]\nsuffer under the same plight.  Defendants have objected that prerequisites of F.R.Civ.P. 23(a) have not been\nmet in that the class is not adequately defined, the interests of the members are antagonistic or diverse and a\nclass action is not necessary.\n\nThe court has decided to certify a Rule 23(b)(2) class, F.R.Civ.P., limited to the class of all persons between the\nages of 21 and 65 who are or who will be involuntarily civilly committed to New York State mental institutions.\nMaintenance of the class will insure that not only is the representative a member of the class at the time the\naction was brought and the class was certified but also at the time a disposition on the merits is reached. See \nSosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 95 S.Ct. 553, 42 L.Ed.2d 532 (1975). The court further believes Woe's claims to be\nrepresentative of the interests of the involuntarily committed mentally ill and in toto the tests are met. Accordingly,\nthe court hereby certifies the above named class of plaintiffs.\nII.\nOther matters for disposition at this time are several motions of plaintiffs to amend their complaint. These motions\nwould add new plaintiffs, defendants and causes of action. The court has decided to deny, without prejudice, the\nmotions to amend.\nFirst, plaintiffs attempt to add a new class of plaintiffs to be represented by Frank Foe, on a new claim against the\n430 Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare *430 (HEW). The claim asserts the unconstitutionality of the federal\nrequirement of accreditation of mental institutions by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals (JCAH)\nas a condition precedent to patients' eligibility for a monthly stipend for \"personal comfort items\" under the federal\nSupplemental Security Income (SSI) program, Title XVI of the Social Security Act as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 1382\n(e)(1)(B); 20 C.F.R. § 405.1036(a).\nThe motion to amend was brought on by order to show cause with an application for a temporary restraining\norder to prevent the Secretary of HEW from sending a letter of intent to the inmates of Pilgrim Psychiatric Center\nadvising that they might become ineligible for the SSI payments due to the loss of accreditation by the institution.\nThe court heard argument on the matter as it was asserted as part of the Woe complaint, although plaintiffs\nsought relief on behalf of what was disclosed to be a different class of patients 00 those over age 65 who stood to\n97\nlose the SSI stipend. The court, in a written order, denied the temporary restraining order on the grounds that\n[26]\nplaintiffs had demonstrated neither the existence of irreparable injury nor possibility of success.\nThe foregoing decision did not touch the merits of the new claim and no amendment of the complaint was\naccepted by the court. The alleged unconstitutionality of the SSI program involves claims different in nature and\npurpose than those which Woe has attacked, and a class different from that Woe purports to represent.\nAccordingly, a consolidation of such different claims and parties in the Woe action is not warranted.\nSecond, the motion to add new defendants presented at that time is also denied. Having been informed of the\nstipulated transfer of a similar action, Yoe v. Kolb, from the Southern District of New York to this court and the\nprobable consolidation of that action with the present one, in which all intended State defendants would be\nnamed, the court perceives no reason to name new State defendants at this time.\nThird, inasmuch as plaintiffs' motion to add new plaintiffs George Goe and Harry Hoe introduces the same class\nas that sought to be represented by Frank Foe and the prior amendment has been denied, the instant motion is\nlikewise denied without prejudice. Goe and Hoe, like Foe, are inmates of Pilgrim Psychiatric Center over age 65\nand their claims more properly should be considered with those of Foe. In view of the denial of the motion to\namend, plaintiffs' application to allow the use of the pseudonyms George Goe and Harry Hoe, which otherwise\nwould have been readily granted, is denied.\nFourth, plaintiffs' motion to add new defendants, the JCAH and certain officers and directors thereof, and a new\nclaim for relief, a conspiracy among the JCAH and State and federal defendants to violate plaintiffs' civil rights, 42\nU.S.C. § 1983, is denied. The claim alleges disparity in accreditation standards used by the JCAH in public and\n[27]\nnon-public institutions and the diversion of funds to \"almost total non-State mental hospital purposes.\"  The\n\"funds\" involved appear to be the federal Medicaid and SSI payments presumably destined for those aided under\nthe statute, patients in mental institutions under 21 and over 65 years of age. The claim concerns those patients\nwho do benefit from federal Medicaid and SSI payments, the members of a class distinct from Woe. Even if the\n\nproposed classes do have members in common, this new claim will be better examined in a separate action as it\nraises decidedly new issues and a different array of defendants, including federal and State officers and private\nindividuals.\nIn sum, despite the liberality with which proposed amendments to complaints are to be viewed, F.R.Civ.P. 15(a),\n431 the proffered additions to the complaint *431 here would unjustifiably interject entirely disparate issues into and\ntend to obfuscate the not insubstantial and difficult questions presented in the main lawsuit. The interests of\nneither the economy of litigation nor the forthright presentation of Woe's claims would be served by the fusion of\ninherently distinct claims and parties. The court thus adheres to its decision to deny, without prejudice, the\nmotions to amend the complaint in their entirety.\nAccordingly, the federal defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint as to those defendants is granted, the State\ndefendants' motion to dismiss the complaint as to them is denied, plaintiffs' motion to amend the complaint is\ndenied, and their motion to certify a class pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2), F.R.Civ.P., is granted but limited to the class\nof persons between the ages of 21 and 65 who are or who will be involuntarily civilly committed to New York\nState mental institutions.\nSo ordered.\n[1] Plaintiffs have been granted permission to use pseudonyms.\n[2] Amended Complaint, filed August 15, 1975, pp. 9-10; Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Motions to\nDismiss, filed September 25, 1975, p. 10.\n[3] Amended Complaint, supra n. 2, at 15; Memorandum in Opposition, supra n. 2, at 10-11.\n[4] Amended Complaint, supra n. 2, at 22; Memorandum in Opposition, supra n. 2, at 11.\n[5] Amended Complaint, supra n. 2, at 2, 56-57.\n[6] Memorandum Order of July 31, 1975.\n[7] Amended Complaint, supra n. 2, at 2.\n[8]Id. at 57.\n[9]Id. at 2.\n[10] Order to Show Cause and Temporary Restraining Order, dated November 18, 1975.

See United States ex rel. Epton v.\nNenna, 446 F.2d 363 (2 Cir.),cert. denied,404 U.S. 948, 92 S.Ct. 282, 30 L.Ed.2d 265 (1971); Heaney v. Allen,\n425 F.2d 869 (2 Cir. 1970); Port Authority Bondholders Protective Committee v. Port of New York Authority, 387\nF.2d 259, 262 & n. 3 (2 Cir. 1967).\n[15] The smaller class still represents all State mental patients excluded from benefits. In 1972, after the decision\nin Legion, the statute was amended to provide Medicaid coverage for those under age 21. See 42 U.S.C. §\n1396d(h). The issue of discrimination based on age has not been raised by Woe, and in any event, was tendered\nin Kantrowitz v. Weinberger, 388 F.Supp. 1127 (D.D.C.1974), and decided on the merits adversely to claimants.\n[16] Although plaintiffs demand benefits for State mental patients only if they receive \"active and adequate\" and\nnot merely \"custodial\" care, they add nothing new to their argument. Medicaid benefits, whether for medical or\npsychiatric services, are designed to accrue only to those receiving active care and treatment. If State mental\npatients were eligible, the institutions would still have to conform to an approved State plan. See, e. g., 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1396d(d) and (h); see generally, id. § 1396a.\n[17] Amended Complaint, supra n. 2, at 46-53; Memorandum in Opposition, supra n. 2 at 23.\n[18] Memorandum of Law in Support of State Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, filed September 13, 1975, at 3-5.\n[19] Memorandum in Opposition, supra n. 2, at 17-18.\n[20] Amended Complaint, supra n. 2, at 15. See id. at 16, 56. The challenged Articles are the following: Art. 13 00\n97\nRegulation and Quality Control of Services for the Mentally Disabled; Art. 15 00 Rights of Patients; Art. 31 00\n97 97\nHospitalization of the Mentally Ill; Art. 35 00 Admission of Alcoholics to Alcoholism Facilities.\n97\n[21] Memorandum of State Defendants, supra n. 18, at 11.\n[22] Amended Complaint, supra n. 2, at 19.\n[23] The asserted \"right to treatment\" has not been universally recognized by courts. The Supreme Court in \nO'Connor v. Donaldson, supra, explicitly refused to affirm the existence of such a right. The difficulties are legion\nin assessing a \"right to treatment\" from defining mentally ill, adequacy or treatment itself, to determining whether\ntreatment is necessary or helpful or the condition is incurable, and to setting standards of care. See id. (Burger,\nC. J., concurring). The statement of dollar figures cannot adequately describe or set the standards of care; an\namount of money spent is merely evidence of what may be constitutionally necessary. But although \"adequacy\"\n\nclearly depends on the circumstances of the case, purely custodial care must, in almost all situations, be\nconsidered inadequate.\n[24] Amended Complaint, supra n. 2, at 7, ¶ VIII.\n[25] Plaintiffs' Second Memorandum in Support of Motion to Maintain a Class Action, filed July 25, 1975, at 2,\n11-12.\n[26] Memorandum and Order of November 20, 1975.\n[27] See Notice of Motion filed December 8, 1975; Affidavit and Brief, p. 10.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Fleischer, Asst. Atty. Gen., New York City (Robert Abrams, Atty. Gen. of N.Y.) for defendants-\nappellants.\nMorton Birnbaum, Brooklyn (Burton Zuckerman, New York City, of counsel), for plaintiffs-appellees.\nBefore CARDAMONE, PIERCE, and ALTIMARI, Circuit Judges.\nALTIMARI, Circuit Judge:\nThis appeal follows this court's decision in Woe v. Cuomo, 729 F.2d 96 (2d Cir.),cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 105\nS.Ct. 339, 83 L.Ed.2d 274 (1984), familiarity with which is assumed. In that decision, we affirmed the district\ncourt's dismissal of plaintiffs' state law and equal protection objections to the adequacy of care at certain mental\nhealth facilities, and reversed and remanded to afford plaintiffs an opportunity to document the due process\ndefects alleged in their complaint.\nOn remand, the district court conducted hearings over a four-month period ending in August, 1985, during which\nplaintiffs presented evidence concerning the adequacy of care at Mid-Hudson Psychiatric Center (\"Mid-Hudson\")\nand Bronx Psychiatric Center (\"BPC\") in support of their motion for preliminary injunctive relief. On July 1, 1986,\nthe district court issued its decision, finding \"that the quality of care at the Bronx [Psychiatric Center] fell below\nconstitutionally adequate standards\" largely as a result of \"chronic and persistent overcrowding.\" The court\nenjoined defendants from admitting additional patients to BPC and directed that the injunction be categorized as\npermanent rather than preliminary because \"to continue to characterize these proceedings as an application for a\npreliminary injunction misperceives the record and the nature of the Court of Appeals remand.\"\nAs to Mid-Hudson, the district court found the record to be \"unenlightening\" on the question of whether\ndefendants provided adequate treatment and, accordingly, denied plaintiffs' application for injunctive relief. The\ndistrict court also recertified the original class and divided that class \"into subclasses consisting of all persons\nbetween the ages of 21 and 65 who are or who will be involuntarily civilly committed to a named New York State\nmental [i]nstitution.\"\nAppellants now seek review of that portion of the district court's order that relates to BPC. In particular, appellants\ncontend that the district court (1) erred by granting appellees permanent injunctive relief without advising\n629 appellants that a final disposition on the merits was at issue; (2) abused *629 its discretion by finding the quality\nof care at BPC to be constitutionally substandard; (3) abused its discretion by enjoining appellants from admitting\nfurther patients to BPC; and (4) exceeded the scope of this court's remand by certifying overinclusive subclasses.\n\nDISCUSSION\n1. Appropriateness of the district court's issuance of a permanent\ninjunction\nAs stated above, the district court in its decision of July 1, 1986, converted appellees' application for a preliminary\ninjunction into a permanent disposition on the merits. Rejecting appellants' \"erroneous assumption\" regarding the\nnature of the extensive 1985 hearings, the district court indicated that it \"did not take evidence and require the\nproduction of witnesses in order to hold the trial on the merits at some future date.\"\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2) provides:\nBefore or after the commencement of the hearing of an application for a preliminary injunction, the\ncourt may order the trial of the action on the merits to be advanced and consolidated with the\nhearing of the application.\nFed.R.Civ.P. 65(a)(2). Courts may consolidate a trial on the merits with a hearing on a motion for preliminary\ninjunctive relief only after \"the parties ... receive clear and unambiguous notice [of the court's intent to do so]\neither before the hearing commences or at a time which will still afford the parties a full opportunity to present\ntheir respective cases.\" Pughsley v. 3750 Lake Shore Drive Cooperative Bldg., 463 F.2d 1055, 1057 (7th\nCir.1972),quoted in University of Texas v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395, 101 S.Ct. 1830, 1834, 68 L.Ed.2d 175\n(1981); see Wohlfahrt v. Memorial Medical Center, 658 F.2d 416, 418 (5th Cir.1981); Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission v. Board of Trade, 657 F.2d 124, 126-27 (7th Cir.1981); Gellman v. State of Maryland, 538 F.2d 603,\n604-05 (4th Cir.1976); Santiago v. Corporacion de Renovacion Urbana, Etc., 453 F.2d 794, 797-98 (1st Cir.1972).\nThe record clearly indicates that appellants' counsel functioned throughout the hearing under the belief that only\na motion for temporary relief and not the merits of the claim was at issue. See Joint App. 107-10, 112, 128, 129,\n133, 142, 145, 147-48, 272, 322, 398-400, 422, 425, 448, 450, 623, 660, 731, 745, 752-53, 794, 807, 814. While\nappellees put on an extensive case in their favor, consisting of six witnesses and numerous exhibits, appellants\npresented no evidence apart from that obtained during cross-examination.\nNeither the district court's oblique references during the hearing to the dispositive nature of the proceedings, see\nJoint App. 119-20 (\"Now, I don't want to waste time. What I want to do is finally close this case.... Once and for\nall, at least at this level.\"), nor the request for permanent relief in appellees' post-hearing memorandum constitute\ntimely, \"clear and unambiguous notice.\" Pughsley, 463 F.2d at 1057.\nThe district court acted prematurely when it granted permanent relief based upon what it viewed as \"undisputed\nevidence\" without notifying appellants of its intent to do so. The giving of formal notice ensures both that a party\nmay avail himself of every opportunity to present evidence pertinent to his position and that all genuine issues of\nfact are before the court. Accordingly, although preliminary injunctive relief may have been proper, the district\ncourt acted prematurely when it purported to make that relief permanent. See Capital City Gas Co. v. Phillips\nPetroleum Co., 373 F.2d 128, 131 (2d Cir.1967) (vacating permanent injunction issued without notice of\nconsolidation). We, therefore, remand the case for the purpose of affording appellants a fair opportunity to\npresent evidence at the trial in chief concerning the constitutionality of the quality of care offered at BPC. This\n630 court leaves it to the discretion of the district court to determine whether and to what extent it is necessary *630\nfor appellees to present again evidence already a part of the record. Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(a)(2).\n2. Appropriateness of preliminary injunctive relief\nA party seeking a preliminary injunction in this circuit has the burden of proving \"`(a) irreparable harm and (b)\neither (1) likelihood of success on the merits or (2) sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them\na fair ground for litigation and a balance of hardships tipping decidedly toward the party requesting the\n\npreliminary relief.'\" Bell & Howell: Mamiya Co. v. Masel Supply Co., 719 F.2d 42, 45 (2d Cir.1983) (quoting \nJackson Dairy, Inc. v. H.P. Hood & Sons, Inc., 596 F.2d 70, 72 (2d Cir.1979) (per curiam)).\nThe record on appeal, particularly the district court's order granting permanent injunctive relief, contains sufficient\nevidence to support issuance of a preliminary injunction. Appellees examined as witnesses three of the\ndefendants: Dr. Steven Katz, Dr. E. Richard Feinberg, and Dr. Ordogan Tekben, as well as experts in the mental\nhealth field: Dr. Stephen Rachlin, a former staff psychiatrist and chief at BPC and presently chairman of the\nDepartment of Psychology and Psychiatry at Nassau County Medical Center; Dr. Henry Pinsker, associate\ndirector of psychiatry at Beth Israel Medical Center; and Charles Pope, program specialist with the Division of\nHealth Standards and Quality of Health Care Financing Administration.\nThe district court methodically reviewed the following exhibits documenting the substandard conditions at BPC:\nreports for May 1984 and February 1985 issued by the New York State Commission on the Quality of Care for the\nMentally Disabled, Department of Health and Human Services reports based on surveys done in December 1984\nand July 1985, and the decisions of the Joint Commission of Accreditation of Hospitals. These reports detail the\nextensive and sundry deficiencies at BPC which include fire safety violations, overcrowding, vermin infestation,\nimproper food storage, and inadequate patient treatment.\nBased on this evidence, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that \"the quality of care at the\nBronx fell below constitutionally adequate standards\" and that \"[t]he deficiencies noted in the living conditions and\ntherapeutic environment (including medical care) are by-products of chronic and persistent overcrowding.\" The\ndistrict court did err, however, in not affording appellants a sufficient opportunity to present alternatives to the\ncourt's extraordinary relief. Although the district court reviewed Exhibit 19, which sets forth appellants' proposals\nfor easing crowding and correcting deficiencies, it failed to conduct an inquiry commensurate with the public\ninterest at stake.\nIn sum, this court accepts the district court's preliminary findings that the state clearly has foresaken its\nobligations as parens patriae, and has been less than forthright in proposing and carrying out corrective\nprograms. The unfortunate plaintiffs, who are burdened by a severe, legally recognized disability and who are\nmost in need of humane treatment, apparently suffer in inhumane and scandalous conditions. Corrective action is\nimperative. Accordingly, we direct that the district court's order be left in force as a preliminary injunction.\nEnforcement of the preliminary injunction, however, is hereby stayed pending remand to the district court for an\nexpedited supplemental hearing concerning (1) the potential implications of preliminary injunctive relief to the\ncommunity and to the patient population in nearby facilities, and (2) the availability of alternatives to extraordinary\n631 relief such as an acceptable corrective program.[1] We leave *631 it to the sound discretion of the district court to\ndetermine whether the expedited supplemental hearing may, upon clear and unambiguous notice to the parties,\nbe consolidated with the trial in chief in accordance with Rule 65.\n3. Subclass Certification\nThis court earlier directed the district court to certify \"subclasses ... as appropriate to press the outstanding claims\nwe have identified.\" Woe v. Cuomo, 729 F.2d at 107.\nThe district court recertified the original class consisting of all persons between the ages of 21 and 65 who are or\nwill be involuntarily civilly committed to New York State mental institutions, and then divided it into subclasses\nconsisting of \"all persons between the ages of 21 and 65 who are or who will be involuntarily civilly committed to\na named New York State mental [i]nstitution.\"\nAppellants object to the district court's division of the original class into subclasses, finding them too broad. We\ndisagree. While somewhat ambiguous, the district court's classification appears to divide the class into\nsubclasses for each institution named at any given time as a defendant in this action. See id., at 108 (noting that\nthe roster of defendants changes each time a state psychiatric facility loses or gains accreditation). Given the\nunusual nature of this case, we decline to hold that the subclasses certified by the district court failed to comport\nwith this court's directions on remand.\n\n[1] As per this court's request during oral argument, appellants submitted information concerning BPC's budget\nfor the fiscal year 1986-87 and the affect that these appropriations will have on BPC's ability to improve\nconditions at its facility. See Letter dated September 5, 1986, Howard L. Zwickel, Ass't Att'y Gen.; Affidavit of\nRobert T. Hettenbach, Acting Executive Director of BPC dated July 8, 1986. In reaching this decision, this court\nhas not considered the submitted material, adjudging it more appropriate to leave to the district court the review,\nif necessary, of this material on remand.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Cuomo, 729 F.2d 96, 108 (2nd Cir. 1984),cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 105 S.Ct. 339, 83 L.Ed.2d 274\n(1984).\nTo comprehend the nature of its responsibility under the Court of Appeals' mandate, the Court must examine the\nentire opinion of the Court of Appeals. See Cherokee Nation v. Oklahoma, 461 F.2d 674, 678 (10th Cir.1972). The\nsignificance of this observation stems from plaintiffs' contention that the Court of Appeals, in essence, has\ndecided the case in their favor by adopting their propostion of law, to wit: absence of JCAH (Joint Commission on\n1508 Accreditation of Hospitals) accreditation of a *1508 hospital for the mentally ill establishes that the hospital is not\nrendering care of a constitutionally adequate quality. See Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73\nL.Ed.2d 28 (1982). To support their contention, they rely on the following passage,\n\"Of course, where a facility lacks accreditation by JCAH, not even a prima facie showing of\nadequacy exists.\"\n729 F.2d at 107.\nTo comply with the Court of Appeals order, this Court held hearings on May 15, 16, and 17, June 5 and 6, and\nAugust 20 and 21, 1985, to receive testimony and documentary evidence on the issue of constitutionally\nadequate care as related to plaintiffs' claims concerning the quality of care at Mid-Hudson Psychiatric Center\n[1]\n(Mid-Hudson) and Bronx Psychiatric Center (BPC).  In accord with the Court of Appeals' order, the following\nconstitutes the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).\n\nAt the outset, the Court is concerned about defendants' posture at the hearings and in their subsequent papers.\nDefendants assert that neither the record nor the law support the granting of the relief proposed by plaintiffs.\nDefendants seemingly overlook that,\n\"The district court has broad discretion to fashion an equitable remedy that meets the practical\ndemands of the situation, as well as the requirements of the Constitution.\"\nFelton v. Secretary, etc., 787 F.2d 35, 37 (2d Cir.1986). Thus, even if the record does not support the precise\nrelief requested by plaintiffs, this Court is not prohibited from granting less or different relief. See Perfect Fit\nIndustries, Inc. v. Acme Quilting Co., 646 F.2d 800, 806 (2d Cir.1981),cert. denied,459 U.S. 832, 103 S.Ct. 73,\n74 L.Ed.2d 71 (1982) (\"It is well settled that the district court's equity jurisdiction empowers it `to mould each\ndecree to the necessities of the particular case.' Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U.S. 321, 329 [64 S.Ct. 587, 591, 88\nL.Ed. 754] (1944); Electronic Specialty Co. v. International Controls Corp., 409 F.2d 937, 947 (2d Cir.1969).\").\nAdditionally, to clarify the record, 729 F.2d at 107, the parties agree that Mid-Hudson has never sought JCAH\naccreditation and that BPC lost its JCAH accreditation, effective August 1984.\nIn the course of the hearings, apart from cross-examination, defendants presented no evidence. As a result,\nplaintiffs reason very simply that the Court of Appeals has adopted JCAH accreditation as the yardstick of\nconstitutionally adequate care, and since BPC and Mid-Hudson are not JCAH accredited, these two factors\nestablish a prima facie case of violation of plaintiffs' right to adequate treatment as recognized in Youngberg,\nsupra. In turn, plaintiffs assert, that the prima facie case thus shifts to defendants the burden of demonstrating\nthat BPC and Mid-Hudson nevertheless deliver constitutionally adequate care but since defendants have never\nattempted to satisfy that burden, plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief. This reasoning does not follow from the\nCourt of Appeals opinion.\nRecognition of JCAH accreditation as prima facie proof of adequate care merely allows plaintiffs to examine and\nprobe the conditions of a JCAH accredited facility. In the context of litigation, the burden of demonstrating\nentitlement to injunctive relief rests upon the applicant, whom, as the Court of Appeals observed, may seek to\nestablish, either in general or as applied to a specific facility, that JCAH standards are below constitutional\nbenchmarks. 729 F.2d at 106. The Court of Appeals said nothing specific about the kind or quality of evidence\nnecessary to establish a prima facie case of constitutionally inadequate care apart from a reference to the\n1509 standard *1509 enunciated in Youngberg, supra. In terms of its anticipation of further proceedings, inferentially\nrelevant to this issue, the Court of Appeals did state,\n\"In any event, we believe the entry of summary judgment, denying appellants [plaintiffs] an\nopportunity to prove their allegations, would be inappropriate as to that or any other institution\nlosing accreditation or approval prior to final judgment.\" (Emphasis supplied)\n729 F.2d at 107. This conclusion is consistent with the earlier statement that,\n\"Although fully cognizant of the critical importance of the rights appellants [plaintiffs] seek to\nvindicate in this action, we are nevertheless persuaded that the district court was correct in\nholding that appellants had failed to assert an adequate factual basis for many of their claims. At\nthe same time, we believe that the dismissal of certain claims was premature. Accordingly, we\nremand so that appellants may have an opportunity to document the constitutional defects they\nallege.\"\n729 F.2d at 98-99.\nIn sum, the Court of Appeals did not decide the issue in plaintiffs' favor. On the contrary, the Court of Appeals, by\nits remand and opinion, has left it to this Court to determine the issue after a hearing in which plaintiffs would\nhave the opportunity to prove their allegations and to document the constitutional defects they allege. Clearly, the\nabsence of JCAH accreditation does not mean that the care rendered by a hospital is constitutionally inadequate.\nTo meet their burden of proof, plaintiffs called Dr. Henry Pinsker, Associate Director of Psychiatry at Beth Israel\nMedical Center in New York, as an expert (curriculum vitae, Pl. Exh. 15). He painted a harsh picture of the\n\nunaccredited institution. He noted that if his facility were to lose its accreditation, it would close in two weeks\nbecause third party payments (e.g., Medicare and Blue Cross) would cease. Concerning the adequacy of medical\ncare, he stated, \"It's hard to imagine.\" He hypothesized nevertheless that an institution could be deficient in\nenvironmental areas (e.g., fire hazards, dangerous conditions, poor heating) yet deliver adequate medical care,\n\"but it might not be an adequate place for anybody to live.\" He opined that JCAH \"bends over backwards\" not to\nwithdraw accreditation and that \"some awfully miserable hospitals throughout the country have their\naccreditation.\"\nAssuming the existence of a deficient environment, he testified that poor conditions would negatively affect\npatients. For example, individuals suffering from a chronic illness whose treatment is poor, are less likely to\nexperience an improvement or periods of remission. He characterized descriptions of chronic schizophrenia in\npsychiatric literature as actually describing \"chronic institutional care and understimulating environment.\" On\ncross-examination he reiterated that there is a possibility that a patient may be receiving satisfactory care in an\nunaccredited institution.\nAlso qualified as an expert (curriculum vitae, Pl. Exh. 3), Dr. Steven Rachlin, currently chairman of clinical\nservices at Nassau County Medical Center, had once worked as a staff psychiatrist at BPC. He oversees a 90\nbed JCAH accredited and HHS (Department of Health and Human Services) certified facility and has testified as\nan expert on individual treatment issues. He identified the JCAH manual, Pl. Exh. 4, and the Consolidated\nStandards manual, Pl. Exh. 5, which pertains more specifically to mental health facilities. These publications\ncontain the standards against which JCAH measures the quality of a hospital's care for purposes of accreditation.\nHe explained that the manual refers to \"substantial compliance\" because no one expects \"perfection\" or \"100%\".\nHe also elaborated that the standards do not set a high level of care.\n\"Q. To your mind, what kind of standards are they?\n\"A. This is the minimal acceptable standards that a hospital or other facility ought to be able to\ncomply with.\n1510 *1510 \"Q. And if a hospital does not comply with those standards, sir, can it provide adequate\npatient care?\n\"A. Probably not.\"\nTr. May 15, 1985 at 82.\nAs Dr. Rachlin elaborated, accreditation occurs after a lengthy process in which a hospital is surveyed. See Woe\nv. Cuomo, 559 F.Supp. 1158, 1163-64 (E.D.N.Y.1983) (describing the JCAH accreditation process). The facility\nhas advance notice of the visit by trained JCAH surveyors who meet with administrative staff and establish a\nschedule for observing programs and services and examining documents. A team of up to 5 individuals drawn\nfrom hospital related professions (e.g., physicians, nurses, social workers, administrators, engineers) conducts\nan inspection over several days, gathering data for transmission to the JCAH staff in Chicago. The Board of\nCommissioners renders a final decision after reviewing the data. Accreditation may be granted with a contingency\nor contingencies, which are deficiencies from the standards. Such deficiencies are not serious enough to deprive\nthe institution of accreditation but do require documentation of subsequent correction, alteration, or elimination.\nAfter confirming that the cutoff of third-party medical services reimbursement follows on the heels of loss of\naccreditation, Dr. Rachlin added that the staff of an unaccredited facility suffers a loss of professional pride, the\nfacility's residency training program is jeopardized, the dissemination of the event through the press damages the\nhospital's reputation, and most pertinent, relatives justifiably worry about the quality of care the patients are\nreceiving.\nThe problem is especially acute for the involuntarily civilly committed patient, who is not in a position to select an\naccredited institution. Such individuals, who are part of the class the court originally certified in this case, enter a\nhospital for emergency care after evaluation by a physician and staff who have concluded that the individual\nmeets the statutory criteria for hospitalization. Involuntary civil commitments also come to a hospital from other\nhospitals on the certificate of two physicians. The receiving hospital evaluates the patient and determines\n\nwhether to grant admission. In either case, patients are not advised of the accreditation status of the hospital they\nare about to enter.\nConcerning BPC, Dr. Rachlin noted that the hospital had received three consecutive 1-year provisional\naccreditations. This indicates that JCAH has encountered a problem or problems of sufficient gravity to warrant a\nresurvey within one year instead of the usual three years. The shorter accreditation period permits the hospital to\nremedy the problem while enjoying the benefits of accreditation. A three year accreditation with contingency\nfollowed the one year accreditations. From the entire set of circumstances, Dr. Rachlin concluded that on their\nreturn, the surveyors had encountered similar problems. He summarized the findings, Pl. Exh. 1, as follows:\n\"A. I think the material from the Joint Commission specifies it specifically. They found significant\ndifficulties in a variety of areas, including treatment planning, chart documentation, progress\nnotes, discharge summaries, medical records, nursing staff, medical evaluations of patients,\nphysical environment, life safety, a whole host.\n\"Q. And the JCAH is the standard professional body in the United States which evaluates whether\npatient care meets minimally adequate standards or not?\n\"A. They are so recognized nationally.\n\"Q. Doctor, you have your own opinion based on what you've seen as to whether or not the Bronx\nfacility provided a minimally adequate care for the patients, don't you?\n\"A. Well, I would have to say based on the documentation available to me, that in all probability,\nthey were not providing adequate care because they had so many problems.\"\nTr. May 15, 1985 at 104.\n1511 Examination of JCAH publications (manuals) for accreditation confirms the testimony *1511 of Dr. Pinsker. There\nis no indication of just which criteria JCAH emphasizes as \"bottom line\" for accreditation and which criteria are\nmore flexible depending on the circumstances and institution under consideration. On this point, Dr. Pinsker\ntestified,\n\"A ... I might add, hospitals that I know of have been in danger of losing accreditation or lost it\nhave usually had environmental problems, and also deficiencies in many aspects of care. The[y]\nare usually not maintaining proper records. They usually don't maintain proper supervision of staff.\nProfessional staff. Non-professional staff. These are the things the commission tends to examine\nextensively. They look at the staff organization, and when accreditation is lost, there is usually 00\n97\nget at specific hospitals involved have not read their reports, but from what I know of hospitals that\nhave had accreditation problems usually many aspects of care have been below par.\"\nTr. June 4, 1985 at 15-16. Although not emanating from JCAH, conceivably this testimony inferentially identifies\nfactors emphasized in the accreditation decision; however, it still does not inform the Court just how much of\nwhich type(s) of deficiencies will be tolerated before JCAH refuses or revokes accreditation. Dr. Steven Katz,\nCommissioner of the Office of Mental Health, confirmed this point.\n\"[O]ne of the shortcomings of the Joint Commission, from its inception, has been that they set\nidentical standards for all facilities regardless of their goals and missions. And it's all well meaning.\nIt has had very good effects in some areas, and it has been disastrous in other areas because all\nsystems were not geared to deliver the same kind of care as an acute hospital system, and they\nstill aren't, and [I] said that it really has been in many cases kind of trying to put a square peg in a\nround hole.\"\nTr. June 5, 1985 at 10. He later added that after consultation with the industry, JCAH has realized that some of its\nstandards need to be changed. Among the changes will be new standards for extended care facilities, which\ninclude many New York state mental hospitals.\n\nThe table of contents of the Consolidated Standards manual illustrates the comprehensive scope of accreditation.\nThe standards, covering 35 categories, are grouped in four broad headings, viz.,\nHospital/Facility management 00 1. Governing Body, 2. Chief Executive Officer, 3. Professional\n97\nStaff Organization, 4. Written Plan for Professional Services and Staff Composition, 5. Personnel\nPolicies and Procedures, 6. Volunteer Services, 7. Fiscal Management, 8. Facility and Program\nEvaluation, 9. Quality Assurance, 10. Utilization Review, 11. Patient Care Monitoring, 12. Staff\nGrowth and Development, 13. Research, 14. Patient Rights, 15. Patient Records; Patient\nManagement 00 16. Intake, 17. Assessment, 18. Treatment Plans (four subheadings), 19. Special\n97\nTreatment Procedures; Patient Services 00 20. Anesthesia Services, 21. Dental Services, 22.\n97\nDietetic Services, 23. Emergency Services, 24. Pastoral Services, 25. Pathology and Laboratory\nServices, 26. Pharmacy Services, 27. Professional Library Services (four subheadings); Hospital\nFacility/Environment 00 31. Plant, Technology, and Safety Management, 32. Therapeutic\n97\nEnvironment, 33. Housekeeping Services, 34. Infection Control, 35. Sterile Supplies and\nEquipment.\nThey are followed by appendices, one of which explains the accreditation process from application through\nappeal.\nGiven the breadth of the standards, it is possible, as both experts testified, for an unaccredited facility to deliver\nconstitutionally adequate care. The Court of Appeals implicitly recognized this reasoning when it observed that\n\"loss of HHS certification may signal inadequate institutional conditions even where JCAH accreditation is in\norder.\" 729 F.2d at 106 n. 11. Unquestionably, however, the lenient manner in which JCAH applies its criteria, as\n1512 evidenced by the testimony and the provisional *1512 accreditations extended to BPC over a four year period,\nreduces the chances of that hypothetical possibility in the case of an actual unaccredited hospital.\nIn determining proper injunctive relief, the Court cannot speculate as to what measures are necessary to bring a\nfacility's quality of care up to constitutionally adequate standards. Cf. Youngberg, supra, 457 U.S. at 321-22, 102\nS.Ct. at 2461. Before the Court may order the defendants to do anything (or cease from doing something), it must\nknow about the conditions prevailing in the facilities at issue. It should know the standards that are in force, their\norigin, and the degree to which the standards are observed in practice. Informed of these factors, the Court may\nthen determine whether the quality of care at an institution falls within the scope of professional acceptability or\nrepresents an exercise of professional judgment. See Woe, supra, 729 F.2d at 105-06 (discussion therein).\nReports of surveys by accrediting agencies such as JCAH and HHS have been recognized as appropriate\nevidence of those conditions. E.g., Woe, supra, 729 F.2d at 106.\nThe evidence discloses that the quality of care at the Bronx fell below constitutionally adequate standards during\nthe pendency of these proceedings. The deficiencies noted in the living conditions and therapeutic environment\n(including medical care) are by-products of chronic and persistent overcrowding documented in the record.\nPl. Exh. 7, a \"Review of Living Conditions in Nine New York State Psychiatic Centers, May 1984\", issued in\nDecember 1984 by the New York State Commission on the Quality of Care for the Mentally Disabled (hereinafter\n\"Commission\") is a copy of the Commission's final report on its survey of conditions at 9 hospitals, including BPC.\n[2]\n In May 1984 two commission staff members visited six randomly selected wards at each facility for a three\nday period. Many of the findings are general and pertain to more than one facility. Specific observations at BPC\nare reproduced verbatim:\n\"Bronx: There was less than 18 inches between beds on all wards. On two wards, patients were\nlodged out to other wards because there were not sufficient beds. Dayrooms and dining halls were\ncrowded and sometimes were without an adequate number of seats for patients. The effects of\novercrowding on the quality of life for patients were only too apparent. The many beds, particularly\nin small dorms, which were only inches apart; the sheer number of patients wandering the halls\nand squeezing into dining rooms that could not accommodate the entire ward population at one\n[3]\ntime, left patients without a sense of their own space.\" [p. 10]\n\n\"Bronx: Many of the 24 sample patients were poorly dressed in shabby, mismatched, and\nsometimes ripped and illfitting clothing during the three-day period. Patients wearing pajama tops\nor bottoms instead of shirts or pants were not uncommon. Patients who did not bring personal\nclothing to the facility got the luck of the draw from the clothing room each morning. Others were\nwearing clothing that was not seasonal; for example, furry winter boots, a wool overcoat during\nour late May visit; and still others wore no underwear.\" [p. 15]\n\"[At Bronx] we observed wards where patients' clothes were stored under beds or piled on top of\nbeds, chairs, or wardrobes for lack of storage space.\" [p. 16]\n\"[S]taff and patients on all six wards reported that toothpaste and toothbrushes were often\nunavailable.\" [p. 19]\n\"[T]oilet paper was lacking in some stalls of all visited bathrooms on all three days of the\n1513 Commission's observations. In addition, *1513 paper towels were absent on five of the six Bronx\nwards.\" [p. 21]\n\"Bronx: Some bed linens on some beds were missing on all wards. Some beds had only one\nsheet, and on four wards some beds lacked pillows or pillowcases. Shabby, worn bedspreads/\nblankets lent a dismal ambiance to dormitories. A towel scarcity was reported by staff and\npatients. Patients, except on laundry day, often used sheets instead of towels for drying.\" [p. 24]\n\"Dayrooms, dormitories, and bathrooms of all six wards were generally dirty. Floors needed\nmopping and were often littered with cigarette butts and scraps of paper. Shower stalls and\nbenches were mildewed or caked with bits of dried soap. Radiators throughout had been stuffed\nwith paper scraps and cigarette butts; and wall fans were dirt encrusted. Seclusion rooms at the\nBronx were especially filthy, with urine on the floors of some and others reeking with urine.\" [p.\n29-30]\n\"[O]ne ward was reportedly infested with lice, as well as roaches and mice.\" [p. 32]\n\"Wall and ceiling maintenance was also a serious problem at Bronx Psychiatric Center. Most\nareas on five of the six wards visited at the Bronx required repainting.\" [p. 34]\n\"[A]ll wards visited had at least one plumbing problem, ranging from toilets which would not flush\nto some sink faucets which were inoperable to plumbing leaks resulting in water on the floors.\" [p.\n37]\n[Report specifically notes fire safety problems at p. 45]\n\"[A]vailable supplies in wards' first aid kits varied substantially, and staff generally were confused\nas to the facility's policy for what constituted required first aid supplies.\" [p. 47]\n\"Bathroom privacy ... was also lacking with several or many toilet and shower stalls without doors\nor curtains.\" [p. 55] \"Most patients' wardrobes at all facilities were unlocked and/or unlockable. At\nthree facilities, Manhattan, Bronx, and Kingsboro Psychiatric Centers, this problem was so\nsignificant that patients were discouraged from keeping any personal belongings, including\nclothing, on the wards.\" [p. 58-59]\nFrom the context of the report, it is apparent that the surveyors also found other deficiencies, e.g., \"At all nine\nvisited facilities many of the basic amenities of daily living that we all count on were absent 00 clocks, calendars,\n97\nposted schedules, free access to drinking water.\" p. 60, which are noted specifically in a report issued April 18,\n1985 by Deborah Blessing, Assistant Director, Quality Assurance Bureau, Pl. Exh. 8.\nAfter receiving the report from the May 1984 survey, the Office of Mental Health (OMH) submitted responses in\nthe nature of corrective actions designed to alleviate the noted problems. Specifically referring to BPC, OMH\nstated,\n\n\"[R]enovations underway at Bronx (requiring one-fourth of the facility be vacant for construction\nwork at all times) have necessitated an even further reduction in patient census until renovations\nare completed. OMH with an agreement with New York City Department of Mental Health is\nproviding intermediate/long-term care to certain groups of Bronx residents in Rockland PC. To\ndate, 47 Bronx residents have been admitted to Rockland.\"\nThe Commission on the Quality of Care resurveyed BPC in February 1985 and issued a report, Pl. Exh. 8,\nreviewing the findings of the May 1984 visit followed by comparison to the findings of the February 1985 visit. In\nthe February 1985 visit, the surveyors also visited two additional wards which had not been part of the prior\nsurvey. The findings for those two wards are noted separately. In general, the report praises the efforts that were\nmade to make BPC a more \"humane\" institution; however, there were still problems with overcrowding, patient\nclothing, insufficient bed and bath linens and personal hygiene supplies, vermin infestation (cockroach),\n1514 attractiveness *1514 of visiting rooms, control of temperatures on the wards (report notes installation of a new\n[4]\nheating system), and patient idleness.\nAs its report states, the Commission surveyed only the living conditions at the facilities with 100 of 130 items\ntaken directly from JCAH standards. In comparison, JCAH standards, Pl. Exhs. 4 and 5, and HHS certification\nregulations, 42 C.F.R. 405.1020 et seq., are much broader in scope. The findings of the Commission's surveyors\ndocument the Bronx's continuing and persistent inability to meet professionally acceptable standards.\nIn December 1984 the Department of Health and Human Services surveyed BPC to determine if the facility were\neligible to participate in the Medicaid program despite its lack of JCAH accreditation. This 42 page report, issued\nNovember 1985, lists noncomplying conditions in nine broad categories 00 Governing Body, Physical\n97\nEnvironment, Medical Staff, Nursing, Dietary, Medical Records, Medical Library, Social Work, and Special\nMedical Records. A resurvey on July 15, 1985 disclosed that of the nine categories only Medical Staff and Social\nWork had been brought into compliance. Among its highlights, the resurvey revealed 18 deficient conditions (not\nin compliance with the state sanitary code) in the rehabilitation cafeteria and that the Executive Director, Dr. E.\nRichard Feinberg, who testified in these proceedings, had not established adequate accountability procedures for\ndepartments that had been cited for deficiencies in the first survey. The lists cover from floor to ceiling and from\nmedical care to the condition of one building's roof. Some of the fire hazards stemmed from the facility's pre-code\nconstruction; however, others regarding portable fire extinguishers, evacuation instruction, the alarm system,\nsmoke detectors, and the regulation of smoking were repeat deficiencies. Given the obvious inability of many of\nthe patients to care for themselves, the potential for a catastrophe from a fire is apparent; consequently, strict\nadherence to precautions against loss of life from fire is imperative. The survey notes improper storage of\nperishable foods, which creates the potential for waste and illness. The quality of medical care was also not\ncomforting. The facility provides no adequate isolation rooms for housing infected patients and has no written\npolicy for reporting infectious cases to the health authorities. Numerous deficiencies were noted in patients'\nmedical records. In addition to failure to record vital signs in several instances, there was no documentation of\nobservations for a least one patient placed in seclusion and no documentation of observations for 3 days prior to\nanother patient's death. Further, medications and treatments were not administered as ordered by physicians.\nMost significantly, the 583 bed capacity established by the Office of Mental Health had been exceeded in every\nmonth of 1985 as follows: January 00 630; February 00 660; March 00 670; April 00 665; May 00 655; June 00 660;\n97 97 97 97 97 97\nJuly 00 669.\n97\nAlthough Dr. Rachlin testified that every facility tolerates a certain amount of overcrowding, Tr. May 16, 1985 at\n135, BPC has been continuously overcrowded since 1983 at the very least. As demonstrated by the evidence,\nthis overcrowding stems in part from demands placed upon BPC as well as from the intent of management.\n\"Begun in April, 1983 and continuing thru March, 1986 a major program of renovation has been\ndesigned to improve substantially the quality of patients' lives by altering living space in the\n1515 direction of creating more privacy, by upgrading the ventilation and heating system, by *1515 the\naddition of air conditioning and by the replacement of defective windows. A census reduction of\n120 (two-thirds by transfer to other psychiatic centers) was necessary in order to meet the\ncontractor's need to have 25% of patient care space empty at all times during the process.\n\n\"This temporary situation, although proceeding according to schedule, has resulted in a lack of\nflexibility as regards the use of patient care space, one result of which is overcrowding and lack of\nprivacy. The rate of progression of the project is contractually fixed and cannot be altered.\"\nPl. Exh. 1 at 273 (letter of Dr. Feinberg of February 20, 1974 to Dr. Myrene McAninch, director of Accreditation\nProgram for Psychiatric Facilities, JCAH, concerning BPC's appeal).\nAs the HHS survey demonstrates, the census reduction was apparently never accomplished, a not unsurprising\nresult in light of the evidence of the staggering demands placed on BPC. For purposes of the examination of Dr.\nFeinberg, the length of patients' stays was divided into short term admissions (less than 90 days), intermediate\nadmissions (90 days to 1 year), and long term admissions (more than 1 year). Dr. Feinberg testified that in 1984\n10% of all admissions were short term and approximately 40% were intermediate. Tr. May 16, 1985 at 175.\nAlthough the question was not asked, it would appear that the remainder of admissions, approximately 50%, are\nlong term. Despite this profile of extensive utilization (almost 1 in every 2 patients admitted will still be there\nduring the entire year following admission), according to Dr. Feinberg, BPC manages to discharge almost as\nmany patients as it admits. Tr. May 16, 1985 at 170. Pl. Exh. 1 at 478 shows 1048 admissions and 811\ndischarges in fiscal year 1983-84 and 1155 admissions and 835 discharges in fiscal year 1982-83. Dr. Pinsker\ntestified that his phenomenon may be attributed to pressure from \"Albany\" (OMH) or as a response to ease\novercrowding. Tr. June 4, 1985 at 43.\nIn theory, defendants are attempting to keep apace of this demand. On August 21, 1985, when the census was at\n670, approximately 90 above the goal of 580 set by OMH, a 60 bed unit at a division of Catholic Charities was in\nthe process of development and efforts to transfer 30 patients to another facility were also being made. As a\nresult, after accomplishing these tasks at some unspecified time in the future, the census should drop to 580. The\nrecord contains no confirmation that in the interim the census has actually decreased to 580, which Dr. Feinberg\ncharacterized as optimal. The basis for labeling 580 optimal was not fully developed except that in computing the\nfigure, OMH had taken the renovations into account. Earlier, Dr. Feinberg had stated that 700-710 \"is the most\nnumber of beds that you can physically put in there.\" Tr. May 16, 1985 at 170. After renovations, capacity would\nbe 750. Despite calling 580 optimal, both Drs. Katz and Feinberg agreed that BPC is overcrowded. This\nconcession, coupled with the Commission's findings about overcrowding, sustains the inference that BPC can\naccommodate the number of patients OMH has determined is \"optimal\" only by lodging patients in areas not\nintended for sleeping quarters. That arrangement reduces the space available for treatment programs and\nsuggests a policy of warehousing and containment rather than rehabilitation, which is the hallmark of the patient's\nright to adequate treatment.\nDespite decreased capacity, BPC continued to relieve municipal hospitals in the Bronx of psychiatric patients\npursuant to a \"trip-wire\" agreement. As Dr. Katz explained, under the agreement in the Bronx, when a municipal\nhospital's psychiatric service, e.g., North Central Bronx, is full (contains the number of patents stipulated in the\nagreement), additional patients are transferred to BPC. Pl. Exh. 14 at 54 shows a total of 586 transfers to BPC\nfrom November 1981 to August 1983. Dr. Katz testified that, \"We are diverting 380 a year plus the transfers.\" Tr.\n1516 June 5, 1985 at 89. *1516 He also agreed that there was a need for more psychiatric beds in Bronx County, and\nfurther stated, \"It's still an absolute necessity. There are plans to begin exploring when [the trip-wire agreement]\ncan be removed as the system becomes more comprehensive and is able to handle the flow of patients.\" Tr.\nJune 5, 1985 at 88.\n\"For the issuance of a preliminary injunction in this Circuit, the moving party has the burden of\nshowing:\n`(a) irreparable harm and (b) either (1) likelihood of success on the merits or (2) sufficiently\nserious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation and a balance of\nhardships tipping decidedly toward the party requesting the preliminary injunctive relief.' Kaplan v.\nBoard of Education of the City School District of the City of New York, 759 F.2d 256 (2d Cir.1985).\"\nLoveridge v. Pendleton Woolen Mills, Inc., 788 F.2d 914, 916 (2d Cir.1986).\n\nThe evidence compels the conclusion that overcrowding at BPC has adversely affected the quality of care\ndelivered to patients at least to the degree that, as plaintiffs contend, the burden of proof has shifted to\ndefendants to demonstrate that the Bronx meets constitutionally adequate standards despite the lack of JCAH\naccreditation. The involuntarily committed patient has a right to decent and humane conditions, Society For Good\nWill To Retarded Children v. Cuomo, 737 F.2d 1239, 1243 (2d Cir.1984), and the uncontradicted evidence reveals\nthat those conditions have not been observed at the Bronx. See Eckerhart v. Hensley, 475 F.Supp. 908, 916-19\n(W.D.Mo.1979); see also Davis v. Watkins, 384 F.Supp. 1196, 1203-12 (N.D.Ohio 1974) (setting out \"minimal\nconstitutional standards for adequate treatment for patients committed to Lima State Hospital\", many of which\n[5]\nstandards are not met at the Bronx).  Given defendants' demonstrated inability over 2½ years to accomplish the\n120 patient reduction required by the renovations, their good intentions do not persuade the Court to give them\nmore time to cope with the problems at BPC entirely at their own discretion.\n1517 In Society, etc., supra, the Court of Appeals ruled that residents of schools for the *1517 mentally retarded have\nrights at least as great as those of prisoners. From the context of this statement, wherein the Court of Appeals\nalso acknowledges that the mentally retarded resident may not be punished, the Court infers that the mentally ill\npatient has rights greater than a prisoner's, or more accurately, different than a prisoner's. At least one Court has\ncharacterized these rights as a humane and therapeutic environment, qualified staff in sufficient numbers, an\nindividual treatment plan for each patient and planned therapeutic activities and programs. Rone v. Fireman, 473\nF.Supp. 92, 119 (N.D.Ohio 1979). In his testimony of May 15, 1985 at 91-92, Dr. Rachlin agreed with these\nstandards. The record discloses an environment which is not humane or therapeutic, no direct evidence of the\nadequacy of staff, except that deficiencies attributable to staff suggest inadequate numbers or inadequate\ntraining, both of which the Court has the power to remedy, Davis v. Balson, 461 F.Supp. 842, 857 (N.D.Ohio\n1978), the absence of individual treatment plans for some patients, and the presence of some therapeutic\n[6]\nactivities and programs (Pl. Exh. 1 at 278-80 and 296-305).\nGiven the history documented in the surveys, it seems unlikely that BPC can furnish a humane and therapeutic\nenvironment as long as it remains overcrowded. Defendants' alternatives, which include seemingly drastic\nmeasures intended either to discourage admission or encourage discharge, Pl. Exh. 19 (goals and objectives to\nreduce and maintain the census at 580 in 1985-86), have not eased the burden or raised the quality of care to\nsatisfy constitutionally adequate standards. Consequently, as an initial step toward improving the quality of care,\nthe population at BPC must be reduced. To the extent that defendants attempted to reduce the number of\npatients, they had not succeeded in the endeavor by August 1985. Additionally, although vital renovations were\nscheduled for completion in March 1986, despite the pendency of these proceedings beyond that time,\ndefendants have submitted nothing concerning the status of the renovations nor their effect upon the quality of\ncare.\nConsistent with the admonition in Society, etc., supra, 737 F.2d at 1251, defendants will be given an opportunity\nto comply with an injunction geared toward remedying a specific constitutional violation prior to more drastic\naction. Accordingly, within ten (10) days of the date of this order, defendants are enjoined from admitting any\nadditional patients to BPC. The ten day delay in the imposition of the injunction will afford defendants an\nopportunity to seek a stay from the Court of Appeals pending appeal. Once the injunction is operative, the Court\nwill consider its extension every 30 days based upon evidence of defendants' progress.\nAccording to Dr. Rachlin, \"closing the gate\" will improve care immediately because as the patient/staff ratio\ndecreases, the time available for staff to attend to each patient increases. This measure is also intended to allow\ndefendants to focus their efforts toward restoring BPC without having to be distracted by the demand of how to\nrespond to and where to place the multitude of new patients. At the outset, the reduction will be accomplished by\nnatural attrition of the patient population, i.e., discharges in the ordinary course of the hospital's operations. On\nthe basis of past rates of discharge, the census should be reduced by at least 60 patients in the first 30 days. Pl.\nExh. 1 at 275. This reduction will permit the staff and management to concentrate on augmenting structures and\nimplementing standards so that BPC can deliver constitutionally adequate care to the population it has been\ndesignated to serve.\n1518\n\n*1518 In entering the above order, the Court recognizes that it has not yet made a finding that irreparable harm\nflows from an involuntarily civilly committed patient's subjection to constitutionally inadequate care.\n\"`Irreparable harm' means injury for which a monetary award cannot be adequate compensation. \nJackson Dairy, Inc. v. H.P. Hood & Sons, Inc., 596 F.2d [70, 72 (2d Cir.1979) (per curiam)].\"\nKamakazi Music Corp. v. Robbins Music Corp., 534 F.Supp. 57, 68 (S.D.N.Y.1981); accord Sperry International\nTrade, Inc. v. Government of Israel, 670 F.2d 8, 12 (2d Cir.1982). Inasmuch as \"[t]he patient committed against\nhis will has a constitutional right only to that treatment as is minimally adequate to provide him a reasonable\nopportunity to be cured or to improve his mental condition\", Eckerhart, supra, 475 F.Supp. at 915, and as Dr.\nPinsker testified, a deficient quality of care adversely affects the patient's opportunity for improvement, the loss\noccasioned by a violation of the constitutional right to adequate treatment is not susceptible of monetary\nevaluation. See Illinois Migrant Council v. Pilliod, 540 F.2d 1062, 1071 (7th Cir.1976),modified on other grounds,\n548 F.2d 715 (7th Cir.1977); Tully v. Orr, 608 F.Supp. 1222, 1225 (E.D.N.Y.1985); see also Northern Penna. Legal\nServices, Inc. v. County of Lackawana, 513 F.Supp. 678, 685 (M.D.Pa 1981) (\"Violations of a litigant's\nconstitutional rights constitute `irreparable harm' per se.\").\nFurthermore, to continue to characterize these proceedings as an application for a preliminary injunction\nmisperceives the record and the nature of the Court of Appeals remand. Contrary to an erroneous assumption\ncontained in defendants' posthearing brief at 8, this Court did not take evidence and require the production of\nwitnesses in order to hold the trial on the merits at some future date. Conditions at a given institution may not be\nstagnant as evidenced by the fact that the director at BPC had proposed corrective actions or plans for almost all\nof the deficiencies noted in the aforementioned surveys. At trial, he specifically related changes made in\nresponse to JCAH criticisms. Tr. May 16, 1985 at 181-94 and 202-03. He has established more and better\nfunctioning treatment teams with the goal that the team leader will better document the patient's progress notes.\nTo remedy problems with discharge summaries, he instituted supervision of the employees preparing the\nsummaries. This supervision includes counseling of personnel who prepare defective summaries. He\nreestablished the position of Director of Nursing and hired 25 staff nurses (5 have since departed, 2 by\ndischarge) and is about to hire 12-20 more nurses through an agency that has contacts with a school in the\nPhilippines. After August 1, 1984 only registered nurses may administer medications. Approximately half of the\npatients have benefitted from new privacy policies designed to segregate bathroom areas by sex. Supervision of\nthe housekeeping staff has increased. The renovations will bring air conditioning and a new heating system to\n350 beds. The ventilation system for the remaining 350 is only being repaired.\nBecause Dr. Feinberg was unable to give an accurate account of the uncompleted proposals, he offered to return\nafter consulting with his subordinates. His subsequent testimony partially diminished the curative effect of his\nprior accomplishments and shed some light on the exact nature of the problem he faces. The issue concerned\nthe appropriation of money to run BPC. Dr. Feinberg explained that he will receive an appropriation for the\ncurrent population along with \"a statement that says by such and such a time your population has to be at a\npredetermined number.\" Tr. Aug. 20, 1985 at 13. By March 21, 1986, the population was supposed to be 600, a\nnumber which the Court believes is unrealistic in light of the consistent 1985 populations. Plaintiffs' counsel\nattempted to learn what would happen to the size of the appropriation if the population goal were not met. At first,\nDr. Feinberg insisted that everyone would be taken care of, but finally he stated,\n1519 *1519 \"If I find that I am running short, then I have to justify why I need more resources and if\nthat's justification that's adequate, then I will get it.\"\nTr. Aug. 20, 1985 at 16. Regrettably, defendants' counsel never clarified the matter; consequently, the record\npermits the inference that budgetary constraints may either reduce the ameliorative impact of Dr. Feinberg's\nchanges or otherwise force him, or any other director of the hospital, to alter those changes.\nWhile Dr. Feinberg's testimony may constitute evidence of the extent to which changes were effectuated, he did\nnot relate whether those changes were effective, see Clark v. Cohen, 613 F.Supp. 684, 707 n. 17 (E.D.Pa.1985),\nexcept that BPC is not yet ready for a reaccreditation survey. Under these circumstances, the Court finds that Dr.\nFeinberg's testimony does not rebut the undisputed evidence of BCP's continuing inability to pass inspection\naccompanied by persistent overcrowding. Cf. Flakes v. Percy, 511 F.Supp. 1325, 1340 (W.D.Wis. 1981); \n\nEckerhart, supra, 475 F.Supp. at 915 (\"[I]t is the duty of this Court to inquire whether the practices or conditions in\na particular institution violate constitutional prohibitions or fail to provide what may be constitutionally required.\").\nApart from specific corrective responses, Dr. Katz related the broader perspective of change at BPC.\n\"A. So, what we have done is try to [integrate] Bronx Psychiatric into the system as a whole, which\nis the only way we are ever going to solve these problems in toto. And what that meant was more\naggressive management, changing the relationship to the medical school, firing 14 doctors, and\nreplacing them with younger people who have [a] different philisophy of treatment, lowering the\nlengths of stay, hiring new nurses, transferring 300 plus patients a year to Rockland before they\nget to Bronx State, until we finish the renovations ... And begin to set up a philisophical value\nsystem in that hospital that moves towards a different kind of care, the problem areas, and the\nreason it takes time is because it's reversing an approach to treatment that's been in place there\nfor 30 years. You need to make significant changes. You need to also build the network in the\nBronx, because you have the least facilities in the Bronx, and the least disposition places to send\npatients. So that, it takes time and it's an entire system problem.\"\nTr. June 5, 1985 at 78-79.\nAs already noted, the results of the July 1985 HHS survey do not suggest that these changes, nor those recited\nby Dr. Feinberg, have eliminated the problems. As a result, and despite their seemingly bonafide efforts, the\nrecord requires defendants to demonstrate when they intend to bring the quality of care at the Bronx up to\n[7]\nconstitutionally adequate standards.  The record also convinces the Court that defendants must have some\nassistance in the nature of a temporary population reduction to return to the delivery of constitutionally adequate\ncare in an expeditious manner. As one judge has observed,\n\"As long as there are present ongoing violations of plaintiff's constitutional rights, prospective\nequitable relief ... is certainly a proper remedy.\"\nClark, supra, 613 F.Supp. at 706 (emphasis added).\nOf course, due to the passage of time during the pendency of this motion, defendants must be given an\n1520 opportunity to demonstrate that they have succeeded in remedying *1520 conditions which prevent BPC from\ndelivering constitutionally adequate care. See Davis, supra, 461 F.Supp. at 848. Whether this opportunity will be\nin the form of a hearing in open court or on the submission of papers or both shall be determined within 20 days\nof this decision.\nIn considering their response, which may well include evidence that at the present time BPC is ready for and/or\nawaiting the results of a resurvey by the JCAH, defendants are reminded of this Court's findings in a suit\nchallenging conditions at Creedmoor State Hospital.\n\"JCAH's ordinary accreditation procedures incorporate a thorough review of an institution, and\ndefendants have submitted affidavits documenting the specific expert inspection conducted at\nCreedmoor. JCAH's governing body and membership are doctors and experts; no panel of\nexperts that this court might appoint could better determine whether Creedmoor provides\nadequate care. Moreover, each of the specific institutional inadequacies alleged in the complaint is\naddressed by one or more of the JCAH criteria.\"\nConcerned Citizens For Creedmoor, Inc. v. Cuomo, 570 F.Supp 575, 576-77 (E.D.N. Y.1983) (emphasis added).\nPerhaps anticipating the Court's view of the evidence, defendants have presented arguments relevant to the\neffects of an injunction and their inability to comply with what they perceive to be plaintiffs' proposed relief.\nPlaintiffs anticipate that the surplus of patients at BPC will be diverted to a surplus of hospital beds located in\nproprietary hospitals, e.g., Montefiore, in Bronx County. As Dr. Katz explained, he has no power to commandeer\nsuch beds for state use. Tr. June 5, 1985 at 120-121. He also related the time consuming and bureaucratic\nprocess involved in converting medical/surgical beds to psychiatric beds, assuming that a proprietary hospital\nwere willing to engage in the necessary alteration and to accept the patients.\n\nDefendants further fear that the surplus will back-up into overcrowded psychiatric wards at municipal hospitals in\nthe Bronx and other state facilities already operating at capacity. Consequently, \"It is not in the public interest to\nleave these individuals without a place to go for treatment, or to exacerbate potential overcrowding at other\nfacilities by diverting them to other hospitals.\" Defendants' post-hearing brief at 16.\nIn assessing these claims, the Court cannot agree with defendants that the record lacks evidence of inadequate\ncare at the Bronx. The conditions described in the surveys evidence a deficient level of care, and the record is\nnot bereft of alternatives to plaintiffs' hospitalization in the Bronx. Dr. Rachlin explained that transfers back and\nforth between his hospital and Pilgrim State Psychiatric Center are common. Usually he sends patients who\nrequire long term care to Pilgrim, and Pilgrim sends patients to him on the basis of clinical characteristics. Dr.\nRachlin also related a case in which he had relieved Pilgrim during an emergency situation.\n\"There was a couple [of] occasions where the State had an early retirement incentive whereby an\nunanticipat[ed] large number of State employees took an early retirement option. Pilgrim then felt\nthe necessity to regroup, to regroup their staffs, their patients, to assess the damages; as it were\nof the early retirement program, and asked that for a period of several weeks I take all admissions\nfrom Nassau County and send no one to Pilgrim Psychiatric Center. It seemed a reasonable thing\nto do. If a facility needs to regroup and get itself together again, it's a little bit tough to do that\nwhen you have a constant parade of very sick people coming in who you have to take care of. For\nthat three-week period, we sent no one to Pilgrim. We admitted them all to Nassau County\nMedical Center. We got a little bit overcrowded doing it, but the overall patient care in Nassau\nCounty benefitted.\n\"Q. ... How did the closing of the gates at Pilgrim help it during the regrouping period?\n1521 *1521 \"A. Let me reiterate what I said. It's a little bit difficult to try and figure out where all the\npatients should go and where all the staff should go when you have a constant pressure of new\nand very sick people who need immediate care and attention. It's an ultra-short term goal to take\ncare of a patient and a short term goal to reorganize, and to reassign staff and to reassign patients\nto different wards. And it's very diffcult, if not impossible, to do both at the same time. It was my\nfeeling that if I gave them some breathing space, we would all be the better for it, especially\npatients.\"\n\"Q. And that is what happened?\n\"A. That's what happened.\"\nTr. May 15, 1985 at 109-11. Even BPC had provided a similar service for Central Islip Hospital in the early 1970's\nbecause,\n\"... one of the buildings at Central Islip had deteriorated to the point where it was uninhabitable\nbecause of fire safety or some other problems with the building, not with the patients or facility\naccreditation. But those people had to go someplace, because it was no longer safe for them in\nthat building at Central Islip.\"\nTr. May 15, 1986 at 113. Dr. Rachlin added that these transfers were accomplished with considerable\nforethought.\nDefendants have presented no evidence that they exercised similar forethought prior to renovating BPC beyond\narranging some transfers to Rockland Psychiatric Center. Nothing in Dr. Katz's testimony contradicts Dr. Rachlin's\ntestimony that,\n\"The Commissioner of Mental Health can apply some gentle muscle to some other general\nfacilities in the area to help out and take extra patients from time to time. I certainly know that to\noccur and used the mechanism myself.\"\nTr. May 16, 1985 at 130-31.\n\nWhile there is considerable reference to a hospital's catchment area, the geographical area for whose residents\nthe hospital is responsible, and the desire to permit patients to be visited by relatives, there was no discussion\nconcerning temporary transfer of long-term or longer-term patients who had become disconnected from the\ncommunity. Dr. Rachlin explained that the staff could match a set of criteria to patients who were no longer visited\nor no longer had contact with relatives, and who were unlikely to be discharged in the foreseeable future.\nOstensibly, this process would permit transfers of patients to hospitals located further from the Bronx than\nRockland Psychiatric Center. Assuming that the number of patients satisfying the criteria was relatively small,\ndefendants still have not explained why they did not transfer patients for 30 or 60 days to permit a period of\nintensive and complete overhaul at BPC after which the patients would return. The record of deterioration of care\nat BPC compels the conclusion that despite their efforts, defendants failed to manage a crisis which they should\nhave anticipated. See Pl. Exh. 14 (Final Report of Governor's Select Commission on the Future of the State-\nLocal Mental Health System, issued November 1984).\nAlthough the possible alternatives may influence the nature of the relief ordered, the violation of plaintiffs'\nconstitutional rights does not hinge on the presence or absence of alternatives. See Benjamin v. Malcolm, 564\nF.Supp. 668, 688 (S.D.N.Y. 1983). Having undertaken to provide governmentally mandated care and treatment to\nthe involuntarily civilly committed patient, defendants must provide constitutionally adequate treatment. They are\nnot relieved of this responsibility by protesting, in essence, that resources, either monetary or creative, are so\nscarce that inadequate care in BPC is preferable to no treatment at all. See Thomas E. by Brooks v. Morrow, 601\nF.Supp. 1055, 1059 (W.D.N.Car. 1984),aff'd 781 F.2d 367, 375 (4th Cir.1986) (\"Lack of funding or of established\nalternatives is not a factor which may be considered in determining the scope of this constitutional right.\"); Lapeer\nOakdale Parents Ass'n, etc. v. Ochberg, 492 F.Supp. 1035, 1037 (E.D.Mich.1980) (\"It is also clear that budget\n1522 cuts cannot under any circumstances justify depriving the residents*1522of their rights.\" (original emphasis)); cf.\nClark, supra, 613 F.Supp. at 707 (\"[D]efendants argument that funding constraints should prevent this court from\nordering the relief sought by plaintiff is contrary to logic and law.\").\nTo receive the deference accorded \"professional judgment\", as derived from Youngberg, \"the decision must be\none based on medical or psychological criteria and not on exigency, administrative convenience, or other non-\nmedical criteria.\" Clark, supra, 613 F.Supp. at 704. In Clark the court rendered this statement in the context of a\nmentally retarded patient's claim for individual relief. In this case, both this Court and the Court of Appeals applied\nthe Youngberg criterion, which formulated a standard for the individual plaintiff's lawsuit, to a lawsuit initially\nchallenging statewide standards and now apparently challenging institution-wide standards. Analogously,\ntherefore, in the institution-wide setting, the quality of care delivered at BPC must be measured by medical or\npsychological criteria and not by exigency, administrative convenience, or other nonmedical criteria. Defendants\ncannot justify inadequate care at BPC on the ground that they are preventing similar inadequacies from\nspreading to other institutions. Cf. Benjamin v. Malcolm, 528 F.Supp. 925, 930 (S.D.N.Y.1981) (\"[W]hat the State\nproposes here is to equalize unconstitutionality by requiring the City to share the burden of impermissible\novercrowding with the State. The remedy does not lie in equalizing unconstitutionality but in eliminating it.\").\nIn contrast to the voluminous quantity of paper relating the recent history of care at BPC, the record contains\nalmost no evidence of the quality of care at Mid-Hudson. Ironically, because defendants have not offered Mid-\nHudson to JCAH for accreditation, they have only partially prevented plaintiffs from discovering the standards\n[8]\ngoverning quality of care at that institution and whether those standards are in fact implemented.  Undaunted,\nplaintiffs' attorney represented in open Court that he premised his application on the lack of JCAH accreditation,\nTr. May 17, 1985 at 302; Tr. June 5, 1985 at 132, a position this Court treated with skepticism at that time. The\nCourt has explained above why it does not accept plaintiff's position; nevertheless, some evidence about Mid-\nHudson was presented.\nThe hospital's description is set out in N.Y. Admin. Code tit. 14 § 57.1:\n1523 \"The Mid-Hudson Psychiatric Center is a hospital in the Department of Mental Hygiene *1523\nwhich offers a range and variety of programs and services for the care, treatment, and\nrehabilitation of the mentally ill of the age of 16 and over comparable with those offered at other\nhospitals in the department. In addition, it has the staff and physical surroundings to enable it to\n\noffer such programs and services to patients requiring closer supervision than can be given at\nother hospitals. Patients whose behavior is such as to raise the likelihood of their causing harm to\nothers cannot be given care and treatment they require at such other hospitals since, for the\nprotection of other patients and staff of such hospitals, they must be kept in closed wards and\neven in seclusion. The Mid-Hudson Psychiatric Center with specially trained staff and perimeter\nsecurity permits freer movement within institutional grounds, of such patients and the possibility of\nrehabilitation, recreation, and therapies which, because of their need for close supervision, would\nnot be available for them at the other hospitals.\"\nPrimarily for the criminally insane, the hospital does admit involuntary civil patients by transfer. The procedure for\nthe transfer is contained in § 57.2, which requires findings that,\n\"(1) there is a substantial risk that such patient may cause physical harm to other persons, as\nmanifested by homicidal or other violent behavior by which others are placed in reasonable fear of\nserious physical harm.\n(2) reasonable efforts at treatment have been made without eliminating such substantial risk of\nphysical harm to others.\n(3) the patient needs the close supervision provided at the Mid-Hudson Psychiatric Center.\"\nDr. Ordogan Tekben, director of Mid-Hudson, testified that of some 360 patients in the hospital on May 16, 1985,\napproximately 20 are involuntary civilly committed patients who were transferred from other hospitals.\nUnfortunately much of the examination of Dr. Tekben concerning the other categories of admissions was\nunfruitful, revealing little of relevance about the quality of care except that patients are not segregated by\ncategory of admission and new admittees are not informed of the hospital's unaccredited status.\nJCAH accreditation has been discussed among Dr. Tekben and other Office of Mental Health officials. See Pl.\nExhs. 11 and 18. Regarding accreditation, Dr. Tekben testified,\n\"A The discussions, in answering the second part of your question, is mostly centered around all\nas follows:\nDo we need to have accreditation? My feeling has been no, I don't need it. I don't need to bring\nfour, five, six people from somewhere else, a good number of them I know are my colleagues, and\nin order to tell me whether or not I'm providing adequate at least adequate care and treatment for\nmy patients, who are my responsibility.\nI could spend energy and channel that energy toward more essential things such as sitting down\nand providing the care, direct care for the patient, instead of piling up the papers, going to all the\n1500 standards.\nSince there was no incentive for the State to obtain, meanwise, the reimbursements, it did appear\nfortuitous and not necessary and I felt I was using my staff energy for something.\nAnd if I may add to that, since we start seeing it, being accredited as being, in quote, \"prestige,\"\nand since frankly speaking, maybe I'm blunt, is a source of irrita[tion] to me, including my being\nhere today because of that, and I'm, at the stage with my staff, we might have 00 I haven't decided,\n97\nwe may apply for a survey in the summer of 19 [8]6, so we will be one of the others.\"\nTr. May 17, 1985 at 261-62.\nThat position seems to be in agreement with Dr. Katz's view concerning JCAH accreditation for Mid-Hudson and\ncontrary to the Commission's goal that all hospitals be JCAH accredited. Dr. Katz testified,\n1524 \"A ... I would restate my feeling about accreditation. I think it provides a *1524 valuable service. It\nis not the sole or most significant measure of quality of patient care. And it's very simple, very\nstraightforward. And I have said that for twenty years. Everybody knows, and it's in print in a lot of\n\n[9]\nplaces ...  Mid-Hudson will seek accreditation if they do, if their decision is they seek\naccreditation, primarily as a reward and moral issue. There is no advantage in Mid-Hudson having\naccreditation from us. It's a superb institution, and I have been there, spent time there, and seen\nthe services they deliver. That unfortunately was built in a different [era] and structurally it makes it\ndifficult to comply with JCAH, but the primary goals for us in that would be primar[il]y to reward the\ninstitution as a moral issue, to show them we really think they are terrific, and they should be\naccreditated, if they want to. It has no other value.\"\n[10]\nTr. June 5, 1985 at 109-10.\nAlthough Mid-Hudson has been inspected by the State Department of Health and the Orange County Fire\nDepartment, no outside entity or individual routinely visits the facility to assure adequate care. Mention was made\nof a survey in March 1985 by a federal employee under the \"Federal Civil Rights Handicapped Act\"; however,\nneither the extent of nor the results of that survey are in evidence.\nAs an example of inadequate care, plaintiffs inquired about the 1979 death of a patient, Mia Martine\n(pseudonym). The findings of the Commission's Medical Review Board concerning her case were reported in a\n1983 newsletter, inserted in plaintiffs' posthearing brief, and are contained in Pl. Exh. 18. At the hearing, the\nCourt did not understand the relevance of that case to establishing grounds for a preliminary injunction, a point\nillustrated by the contents of the newsletter, which states in part,\n\"Commission investigation and Medical Review Board findings in this case included: the extended\nuse of seclusion on four occasions during the last month of this patient's life; absence of\ndocumentation by physicians justifying the continued use of seclusion and restraint or providing\nevidence of attention to the patient's physical condition; transfer of the patient to the infirmary\nwithout examination by a physician prior to transfer or while the patient was in the infirmary,\nalthough the patient exhibited symptoms of a physical illness and a marked change from her usual\nbehavior pattern; lack of sufficient medical information and medical history transferred with the\npatient when she arrived at the hospital; and incomplete and insufficient toxicology and autopsy.\"\nThose findings do not enlighten the Court as to what standards are in existence at Mid-Hudson, whether they are\nemployed, and if so, whether this tragic incident represents an isolated case as opposed to a representative\nsample of the average quality of care delivered to Mid-Hudson patients. Significantly, plaintiffs have not\ndemonstrated that a JCAH accredited Mid-Hudson would be immune from acts of negligence which produce\ndamage that may give rise to a violation of a patient's constitutional rights.\nSignificantly, too, Dr. Tekben's testimony about the use of seclusion, confining a patient in a space behind a\nlocked door, at Mid-Hudson, suggests that the Medical Review Board's findings were adopted.\n1525 *1525 \"Q What form of care do you give to a patient in seclusion?\n\"A They are taken out every two hours to the toilet. They are given a shower. If they need more\nthan that, they are taken out more frequently. They are fed and if they are on medication, the\nmedications are given. They are observed every 15 minutes by the ward personnel. Very\nfrequently by the nurse. At least twice during the day by the psychiatrist and at least once a day by\nthe team, psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, recreation therapist, they see how the\npatient is evaluated. How he or she is doing.\"\nTr. May 17, 1985 at 320.\n\"Q Doctor, how often does a physician have to write an order for seclusion, formally write an order\nfor seclusion on an order sheet?\n\"A Every four hours, except when the patient is sleeping.\"\nTr. May 17, 1985 at 322. This last requirement is part of an Office of Mental Health regulation enacted in the late\n1970's.\n\nIf the procedures related by Dr. Tekben are followed, a reasonable expectation is that a patient placed in\nseclusion should not succumb from neglect; however, as Dr. Tekben commented,\n\"... Since about that case [referring to Martine], with your permission, I'd like to correct that\nbecause counsel said that the patient was not seen. The actual record says it was not\ndocumented.\"\nTr. May 17, 1985 at 324.\nThe probability that staff at Mid-Hudson document what they have done and do not document what they have not\ndone concerning monitoring patients in seclusion has not been raised as an issue. Unlike BPC, moreover, the\nrecord does not show that failure to document is a frequent occurrence at Mid-Hudson so as to permit the\ninference that the standard of care is failure to deliver services illustrative of adequate, if not vital, treatment.\nAfter seclusion, counsel moved to the use of camisoles (strait jackets) and restraint sheets (immobilizing the\npatient by tieing the sheet at the edge of the bed). Like secluded patients, patients in restraints are monitored\n(every two hours) and the monitoring is documented. This practice also emanated from the Office of Mental\nHealth. The purpose of this line of inquiry appears to be the belief that restraint is an overutilized form of\ntreatment at Mid-Hudson. Dr. Tekben admitted that Mid-Hudson probably uses restraints more than other\nhospitals primarily because the transfer patients are \"the most dangerous unmanageable patient group.\" With the\nexception of a Medical Review investigation, which would be prompted by the death of a patient, no outside body\nreviews seclusion orders or the use of restraints.\n\"[I]f a mental patient is involuntarily confined because he is dangerous, due process requires a\nspecific focus to the treatment which is his right. Treatment efforts must be directed to that aspect\nof he behavior which caused him to be classified as dangerous so that he has a reasonable\nopportunity to be eventually discharged from maximum security confinement.\"\nEckerhart, supra, 475 F.Supp. at 915.\nAlthough the dangerousness of Mid-Hudson patients separates them from other involuntarily civilly committed\npatients, especially in view of their potential for violence, that condition should not deprive them of adequate care.\nSee Rone, supra, 473 F.Supp. at 118-19 (discussion therein). Dangerousness, however, inevitably affects the\nnature of the appropriate treatment. See Eckerhart, supra, 475 F.Supp. at 914 n. 16. For reasons possibly related\nto plaintiffs' argument that a non-JCAH accredited facility does not provide constitutionally adequate care, the\nrecord is unenlightening as to whether defendants provide appropriate or inappropriate treatment for the\ninvoluntarily civilly committed patient at Mid-Hudson. Accordingly, plaintiffs' application for injunctive relief at Mid-\nHudson is denied.\nThe disposition of plaintiffs' applications for injunctive relief leaves two issues stemming from the Court of\nAppeals opinion:\n1526 *1526 \"For the reasons we have attempted to articulate with some precision, we believe the\ndistrict judge abused his discretion by decertifying the class.\n\"On remand, subclasses should be certified as appropriate to press the outstanding claims we\nhave indentified.\"\n729 F.2d at 107. Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2), the Court originally certified a class \"of all persons between\nthe ages of 21 and 65 who are or who will be involuntarily civilly committed to New York State mental institutions.\"\nWoe v. Mathews, 408 F.Supp. 419, 429 (E.D.N.Y.1976). To enforce the Court of Appeals' direction with plaintiffs'\nfocus upon JCAH accreditation as the yardstick of constitutionally adequate care, the Court recertifies the original\nclass and divides that class into subclasses consisting of all persons between the ages of 21 and 65 who are or\nwho will be involuntarily civilly committed to a named New York State mental Institution. These subclasses are\nalso intended to effectuate the following portion of the Court of Appeals opinion,\n\n\"In addition, we note that mental institutions within the New York State system have lost and\nregained accreditation even within the course of this litigation. We would expect, of course, that\nthe district judge will reexamine the facts as they exist at the time he revises class certification and\nas they evolve thereafter.\"\n729 F.2d at 108.\nThe second issue concerns attorneys' fees.\n\"Appellants' counsel also seeks an award of attorneys' fees for his efforts to date. Although we\napplaud his efforts on behalf of the unfortunate, forgotten, and all-too-often unrepresented\nmembers of the appellant class, we are barred from making an award in these circumstances. \nSee Hanrahan v. Hampton, 446 U.S. 754 [100 S.Ct. 1987, 64 L.Ed.2d 670] (1980). In any event,\nwe believe this issue is more appropriately left to the discretion of the conscientious district judge,\nwho bears the primary burden for shepherding this litigation.\"\nId. In response, plaintiffs seek what they characterize as \"interim fees\" for their pursuit of preliminary injunctions\nagainst Kings Park Psychiatric Center in 1980 and Manhattan Psychiatric Center in 1982. In both instances, the\nhospitals had lost and later regained JCAH accreditation. Defendants counter that plaintiffs are not prevailing\nparties because the Court never granted either motion for a preliminary injunction. The record, as related by the\nCourt of Appeals, reveals that the Kings Park Motion seemingly evaporated after a conference, 729 F.2d at 100,\nand the Court treated the Manhattan motion as part of defendants' then pending motion for summary judgment.\nThus, in both cases, while the Court did not grant the relief requested, both hospitals eventually obtained\nplaintiffs' sought after result, JCAH accreditation.\n\"In Nadeau [v. Helgemoe, 581 F.2d 275 (1st Cir.1978)], the court held that a person who brings an\naction alleging a civil rights violation, but who does not receive a judgment on the merits, is still a\nprevailing party for purposes of [42 U.S.C.] § 1988 if he shows (1) that his lawsuit is causally\nlinked to securing the relief obtained and (2) that the defendant's conduct in response to the\nlawsuit was required by law.\"\nJ & J Anderson, Inc. v. Town of Erie, 767 F.2d 1469, 1473 (10th Cir.1985); accord Ortiz de Arroyo v. Barcelo, 765\nF.2d 275, 282 (1st Cir.1985).\nInasmuch as the parties have not referred to the above cited relevant authorities, they have not addressed\nwhether plaintiffs should be deemed to have prevailed because defendants capitulated to their demands for care\nin a JCAH accredited facility.\nAlthough this lawsuit began in 1975, nothing in the record suggests that defendants' actions or attitudes\nconcerning JCAH accreditation have been affected by the litigation. Hospitals in the state mental health system\n1527 have lost and regained accreditation in the course of defendants' attempts to deal with a crisis, especially in \n*1527 the New York metropolitan area. For example, although plaintiffs expressed an intent to challenge the\nconstitutionality of care at BPC and Mid-Hudson in December 1984, defendants did not rush to return BPC to a\ncondition meriting reaccreditation. They had no intention of having BPC resurveyed at least until after the\nrenovations scheduled for completion in March 1986. Similarly, the testimony permits the inference that\ndefendants have no intention of ever submitting Mid-Hudson to a JCAH survey.\nThe court also recognizes that defendant'a motivations for their attitudes toward accreditation do not stem from\nthis Court's ruling that JCAH accreditation is not mandatory for constitutional purposes. Under that rule, which\ngoverns this case, in both prior motions, plaintiffs had obtained not only what they sought but also what the law\ndid not require, JCAH accredited hospitals. See California Ass'n of the Physically Handicapped, Inc. v. F.C.C.,\n721 F.2d 667, 672 (9th Cir.1983). Under these circumstances, plaintiffs have not established that they are\n[11]\nprevailing parties in either of their prior motions.\nPlaintiffs also seek attorneys' fees for the instant applications. Concerning Mid-Hudson, they have lost on the\nmerits and therefore may not receive fees. With respect to BPC, however, they have prevailed on the issue of the\n\nquality of care, and accordingly are entitled to injunctive relief as previously noted and therefore as prevailing\nparties are also entitled to fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988. Cf. Paragould Music Co., Inc. v. City of Paragould,\nArkansas, 738 F.2d 973, 975 (8th Cir.1984) (per curiam) (\"The present case differs from those cases cited by\nappellants where the grant of temporary or preliminary relief supported the award of attorney's fees. In those\ncases, the plaintiffs' suit was a catalyst to bring about the relief sought, or the district court made a ruling on the\nmerits.\" (citations omitted)).\nAccordingly, plaintiffs have 20 days from the date of this order to submit their fee application and all supporting\ndocumentation. Thereafter, defendants will have 20 days to respond, and in turn, plaintiffs will have 10 days to\nreply to defendants' response.\nSO ORDERED.\n[1] Specifically, the Court of Appeals noted that remand was necessary for this Court to take evidence concerning\nSouth Beach Psychiatric Center in Staten Island. The parties report that that facility is currently JCAH accredited\nand HHS certified. Another facility mentioned by the Court of Appeals, Manhattan Psychiatric Center, has become\nthe subject of a separate lawsuit in the Southern District of New York, and will be dealt with there.\n[2] The establishment, function, and operation of the Commission on Quality of Care for the Mentally Disabled\nappear in L. 1977, c. 655, codified in N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law § 45.01 et seq.\n[3] Page references in brackets are to Pl. Exh. 7.\n[4] During the testimony of Dr. Katz, there was heated discussion concerning the nature of and extent of any\nnegotiations between the Commission on Quality of Care and the Office of Mental Health. Plaintiffs only\ninferentially suggested that the Office of Mental Health had sought to influence the Commission's findings, which\nwere critical and sweeping. Regardless of any possible interaction between the two agencies, in light of the JCAH\nand HHS surveys, which are lengthly itemizations of the observed deficiencies as opposed to the Commission's\nnarrative style of reporting, plaintiffs had a constitutional right to better treatment and conditions than defendants\nwere providing.\n[5] Defendants assert that \"plaintiffs were unable to show any correlation between census and the provision of\nadequate treatment.\" Defendants' post hearing brief at 8. They rely on Dr. Feinberg's testimony that the Bronx\nhas a capacity of 710 and Dr. Rachlin's testimony on cross-examination as follows, \n\"Q You have spoken of those instances in which patients are deflected or transferred to other accredited facilities\nor care in lieu of being in overcrowded or otherwise unacceptable facilities. What happens to the patient who isn't\nadmitted at all because there is no admission into an unaccredited facility due to a stay, but who needs care?\n\"A He [or] she would be diverted to another hospital., I'm not sure I understand your question.\n\"Q I'm sorry. Assuming that other hospitals are at capacity, and assuming that there were no further admissions\nto Bronx Psychiatric Center, for example, what would happen to the patient who can't get into Bronx Psychiatric\nand for whom there's no capacity in any other state facilities?\n\"A You mean the balloon is going to burst?\n\"Q Yes.\n\"A Again, I've lived through such situations. Each facility takes a certain percentage of overcrowding and lives\nwith it.\nQ. Isn't it a fact that a certain amount of overcrowding is livable.?\n\"A A certain amount is livable.\n\"Q And adequate care can be delivered at a facility notwithstanding a certain degree of overcrowding?\n\n\"A Well, when, for example, my own unit was overcrowded five years ago or so, as I talked about yesterday, and I\nlearned on the State to take some patients, it was quite simply I felt we weren't doing a decent job.\n\"Q How overcrowded were you at that point?\n\"A 20, 25 percent\n\"Q But it was not until you reached a 20 or 25 percent level of overcrowding that you called for help, so to speak?\n\"A My balloon burst when people are sleeping in hallways.\"\nTr. May 16, 1985 at 134-35. The Court infers that the duration of overcrowding at Dr. Rachlin's 90 bed facility was\nrelatively brief, in part because he had an alternative placement for patients. By comparison, plaintiffs at BPC, a\nmuch larger facility, have been attempting to sleep, eat, shower, and recover in much closer, less well appointed\nquarters for almost 3 years.\n[6] While this Court is in no position to run a mental hospital, Eckerhart, supra, 475 F.Supp, at 915, it cannot\nignore the implications of evidence showing plans of corrective action followed by seemingly unsuccessful\nresults. For example, in the appeal to the JCAH Dr. Feinberg lists several steps to remedy problems in nursing\ncare along with completion dates in 1984, plaintiffs' exh. 1 at 310-14; yet, the HHS survey in July 1985 lists\ndeficiencies on pp. 40-42 attributed to the nursing staff.\n[7] On cross-examination of Dr. Rachlin, defendants emphasized the factor of time. Tr. May 16, 1985 at 143-45.\nIn a series of leading questions, their counsel noted the existence of money in the state budget to convert\nmedical/surgical beds to psychiatric beds. Obtaining the required certificate of need for these beds from the\nFederal Government, however, is a time consuming process, which Dr. Rachlin admitted, \"gets bogged down in\nbureaucracy\". In his testimony, Dr. Katz also stressed that it takes time to make changes at BPC due to the\nsystem-wide nature of the reforms. On the basis of the record, plaintiffs have waited sufficiently long enough to\nreap the benefits of change that due process requires more accountability from defendants than, \"You have to\nunderstand, it takes time.\"\n[8] The Court has not overlooked plaintiffs' exhs. 20 and 21, listing some 51 manuals covering BPC, of which\nplaintiffs' exh. 19 is the Hospital Policies and Procedures Manual, and plaintiffs' exh. 16, which is the policy and\nprocedures manual for Mid-Hudson. The existence of standards in the abstract, however, does not insure their\nimplementation as evidenced by the following excerpt from plaintiffs' exh. 10 (memorandum of deputy executive\ndirector P.M. Haeberle), an account of the visit of a member of the Board of Visitors to BPC on April 28, 1985. \n\"When entering the building she found the lobby to be filthy far more cluttered and dirty than her recent\ninspections. But unlike on previous times the patients were inappropriately clothed.\n\"She then went to Ward 30 where she found Frederick Henry not being on one to one and his room not clean.\nClothing was all over the floor and stacks of used plates and eating utensils also. Mr. Henry had not taken a\nshower. In addition he was crying, claiming that staff would not let him out of the room.\n\"In discussions with the staff Mrs. Rosello found them to be pleasant; however stating that they were not going to\nwatch Mr. Henry even from the hallway that `they had children at home to worry about.' The staff said that they\nwere not going into the room to take away the dishes and that someone else should do it.\n\"When questioned about the showering of Mr. Henry then they stated that they were not doing that.\n\"In addition there was a patient by the name of Mark, who supposedly has Hepatitis, and who is being more\nunmanageable because staff is having no relationship whatsoever with him.\n\"She then went to Ward 29 where she found that there were two female Therapy Aides scheduled on duty and\nonly one showed up and one of the Therapy Aides from the previous shift would be starting at 4:30. Thus leaving\none female staff member on a crowded ward of males.\"\n\n[9] Plaintiffs assert that they searched for but could not find the writings to which Dr. Katz referred. While Dr. Katz\nhas not identified the relevant publications, the Court deems this point collateral to the issue of constitutionally\nadequate care at Mid-Hudson. Whatever views Dr. Katz may hold about the value of JCAH accreditation,\ndefendants are obligated to provide constitutionally adequate care to Mid-Hudson patients, and plaintiffs, in the\nfirst instance, bear the burden of demonstrating that defendants have not honored this obligation.\n[10] The Court believes that the word \"moral\" in this excerpt from Dr. Katz's testimony should read \"morale\". Dr.\nKatz also stated that New York is one of the few state mental health systems that has ever aspired to JCAH\naccreditation.\n[11] The Court acknowledges that a different analysis governs in the Fifth Circuit. \n\"When the plaintiff has shown both that he succeeded on the central issue in the litigation and that the lawsuit\ncaused the defendant to act, he has made a prima facie case that he is the prevailing party and entitled to\nattorney's fees. There is no reason to require the plaintiff to prove, in addition, that the defendant's conduct\nfulfilled a legal obligation or otherwise to show the defendant's motivation.\n\"However, a plaintiff who brings an action that has no colorable, or even reasonable, likelihood of success on the\nmerits is not entitled to recover attorney's fees if the defendant simply complies with the plaintiff's demands and\nmoots the case for reasons that have nothing to do with the potential merit of the suit. Whether activated by\neconomic, political, or purely personal concerns, a defendant may choose voluntarily to make the change sought\nin the suit rather than undergo protracted and expensive litigation.\n\"A defendant who contends that his conduct was a wholly gratuitous response to a lawsuit that lacked colorable\nmerit, must demonstrate the worthlessness of the plaintiff's claims and explain why he nonetheless voluntarily\ngave the plaintiffs the requested relief.\"\nHennigan v. Ouachita Parish School Bd., 749 F.2d 1148, 1152-53 (5th Cir.1985). The appropriateness of such a\ndistribution of burdens of proof between the parties on the issue of fees is not before the Court. Putting the\nquestion of defendants' legal obligations to one side, plaintiffs have offered nothing to demonstrate that their\nmotions for preliminary injunctions were the catalysts to reaccreditation at either Kings Park or Manhattan.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Brutten, Asst. Atty. Gen., New York City (Robert Abrams, Atty. Gen., N.Y., Melvyn R. Leventhal, John P.\nPetrila, Seth Abrams, New York City), for defendants-appellees.\nBefore KAUFMAN, OAKES and CARDAMONE, Circuit Judges.\nIRVING R. KAUFMAN, Circuit Judge:\nAlthough some of the mysteries of mental illness have yet to be unravelled, the ability of modern psychiatry to\n[1]\n\"minister to a mind diseased\"  has expanded dramatically in recent years. Through the use of psychotropic\ndrugs and new methods of therapy, psychiatrists and other mental health workers can help their patients to lead\nmore productive lives relatively free from the debilitating effects of mental disturbance. Yet the tragic reality is that\nsociety's allocation of its finite resources often prevents the medical profession from bringing its full expertise to\nbear in combatting psychic afflictions. Revelations that emerged in the Wyatt litigation in Alabama and the\nWillowbrook case in New York, among others, have forced us to acknowledge that institutions for the mentally\nhandicapped often do not provide treatment that remotely accords with contemporary medical standards.\nCourts have long recognized that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not permit states to\ndeprive mentally ill individuals of their freedom for therapeutic purposes unless some level of treatment is actually\nprovided. We are confronted in this case with a broad challenge to the constitutional adequacy of treatment\nprovided to persons civilly committed to New York State mental institutions. Although fully cognizant of the critical\nimportance of the rights appellants seek to vindicate in this action, we are nevertheless persuaded that the district\ncourt was correct in holding that appellants had failed to assert an adequate factual basis for many of their\n99 claims. At the same time, we believe that the dismissal of certain claims was premature. Accordingly, *99 we\nremand so that appellants may have an opportunity to document the constitutional defects they allege.\nI\nWe shall attempt to review the nine-year history of this litigation in a concise manner. In a pseudonymous\ncomplaint filed in 1975, Walter Woe claimed that, as one involuntarily committed to Brooklyn State Hospital (now\nrenamed Kingsboro Psychiatric Center), he was being denied that quality of care and treatment which the\nConstitution required. He contended that the state institution in which he resided was providing care which was\ngrossly inferior to that offered by private hospitals, and, in particular, by Downstate Medical Center situated\ndirectly across from Kingsboro. He also asserted that individuals committed to state institutions were more likely\nto be poor, black, and more seriously ill than those treated in the psychiatric wards of general hospitals. He\nclaimed that, as a quid pro quo for involuntary commitment, he was \"constitutionally entitled to adequate and\n\nactive care and treatment, either in a state mental hospital or in an alternative facility.\" Additionally, he argued that\nthe level of care provided by general medical hospitals was the standard which the Constitution mandated, and\nthe guideline by which his own care should be evaluated.\nWoe also challenged the constitutionality of the New York Mental Hygiene Law (hereinafter \"NYMHL\") on its face\nand as applied, claiming that it failed to provide for State recognition and enforcement of his care and treatment\nrights. He also attacked disparities in the provision of Medicaid benefits to patients in private and state-\nadministered mental hospitals, a claim no longer at issue here. Woe brought his complaint on behalf of a putative\nclass of all similarly situated mental patients, and sought declaratory, injunctive and compensatory relief.\nIn his first order entered on a motion to dismiss, Judge Neaher carefully attempted to refine and focus the\nmultiple issues raised by Woe. Woe v. Mathews, 408 F.Supp. 419 (E.D.N.Y.1976). He held that the Medicaid\nclaim was foreclosed by the Supreme Court's summary affirmance of Legion v. Richardson, 354 F.Supp. 456\n(S.D.N.Y.), aff'd sub nom. Legion v. Weinberger, 414 U.S. 1058, 94 S.Ct. 564, 38 L.Ed.2d 465 (1973), in which a\nvirtually identical claim was rejected. He also upheld the constitutionality of the NYMHL, concluding that it did\n[2]\nprovide a satisfactory right to treatment and mechanisms for enforcing that right.  The judge then discussed\nappellants' constitutional claims, which he viewed as two-fold. He reasoned that when a state assumes \"the\nburden of providing care for a dependent group, such as the mentally ill, it cannot consonant with the equal\nprotection clause discriminate among those similarly situated mentally ill.\" 408 F.Supp. at 428. In addition, as a\nmatter of due process, \"it would seem encumbent upon the State as confiner to minimize the mode of\nconfinement, and to employ whatever means are necessary, including such care and treatment as are\nreasonably possible in the circumstances of the case, to promote the speedy release and return to liberty of the\nperson confined.\" Id. at 429 (citation omitted).\nJudge Neaher concluded that these claims could not be summarily determined. He decided that maintenance of\nthe suit as a class action would assure that class representatives would exist both at the initiation and the\n100 ultimate disposition of the suit.[3] Because Woe's interests were representative *100 of those of the proffered\nclass, the judge certified pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2) a class consisting of \"all persons between the ages of\n21 and 65 who are or who will be involuntarily civilly committed to New York State mental institutions.\" Id. Finally,\nseveral motions to add additional plaintiffs and defendants and to join new causes of action were denied. Most\nrelevant to the current status of the action were the denials of a motion to add as defendants an organization\ncalled the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals (hereinafter \"JCAH\") and certain of its officers and\ndirectors, and a motion to join a new claim alleging conspiracy by the JCAH and government defendants to\nviolate plaintiffs' civil rights. The latter claim was predicated upon the theory that the JCAH uses lower\naccreditation standards in evaluating public than non-public mental hospitals, resulting in approval of substandard\n[4]\nstate institutions. That issue, the judge suggested, could be better examined in a separate action.\nBoth parties sought to challenge the class as certified. Plaintiffs moved to enlarge it by removing the age\nrestrictions, while defendants moved to limit the class to those patients committed to Kingsboro Psychiatric\nCenter. In an unpublished order the following year, Woe v. Mathews, 75 CV 1029 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 13), aff'd by\norder, 562 F.2d 40 (2d Cir.1977), Judge Neaher denied both motions \"pending clarification of the issues which will\nform the essence of the action as discovery progresses.\" Id., slip op. at 6.\nNo further progress appears to have occurred for three years. In February 1980, appellants moved for a\npreliminary injunction barring further admissions to Kings Park Psychiatric Center, which had lost its JCAH\naccreditation. Appellants subsequently sought similar relief with respect to Hudson River Psychiatric Center,\nwhose accreditation had also been revoked.\nThe parties and the judge held a status conference on May 14, 1980. At that session, the judge broached the\npossibility of appointing a panel of amici to assist the court in examining the state institutions and formulating\nconstitutional standards of care and treatment. The judge noted that this procedure had been utilized with\nsuccess by Judge Johnson in handling a challenge to the Alabama mental hospitalization system, Wyatt v.\nStickney, 325 F.Supp. 781 (M.D.Ala.1971),implemented in 344 F.Supp. 373 (1972), aff'd sub nom. Wyatt v.\nAderholt, 503 F.2d 1305 (5th Cir.1974). He indicated particular interest in the participation of the Department of\nJustice in the litigation, and noted that the recently-enacted Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1997 (Supp. IV 1980), afforded that Department a special role in protecting the rights of residents of state\ninstitutions. Appellees, however, objected to the amici procedure, and indicated that if the judge intended to\npursue it, they would seek certification under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) to allow an immediate appeal. For reasons\nwhich do not appear in the record, the proposal was never pursued.\nA period of squabbling between the parties over discovery matters ensued, during which the substantive aspects\nof the litigation remained at a standstill. During that period both Kings Park and Hudson River Psychiatric Centers\nregained their accreditation. On May 24, 1982, appellees moved for summary judgment. Appellants responded\nwith another order to show cause, this time relating to Manhattan Psychiatric Center, which had lost its JCAH\naccreditation, and South Beach Psychiatric Center, which had lost its certification by the Department of Health\n101 and Human Services (hereinafter \"HHS\") as a hospital providing *101 adequate care. The court indicated by\nmemorandum order that it would not entertain the request because it was \"redundant of issues to be determined\nin motions already before this Court,\" Woe v. Carey, 75 CV 1029 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 2, 1982), but would instead treat\nappellants' papers as opposing the motion for summary judgment.\nOn May 16, 1983, Judge Neaher ruled on appellees' motion. Woe v. Cuomo, 559 F.Supp. 1158 (E.D.N.Y.1983).\nHe interpreted the Supreme Court's recent decision in Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73\nL.Ed.2d 28 (1982), to require that the judgment of psychiatric professionals related to institutional care and\ntreatment be accorded presumptive validity. After discussing the JCAH accreditation program, he concluded that\nit represented the exercise of professional judgment about a facility which, under Youngberg, constituted prima\nfacie proof of adequacy. As to the accredited state facilities, he found that appellants had failed to present any\ndata indicating that JCAH approval was \"a mere `veil' hiding due process violations.\" 559 F.Supp. at 1165.\nAccordingly, appellants' claim failed as to the accredited facilities.\nNor, the judge reasoned, does loss of accreditation per se necessitate a finding of due process violation, because\nJCAH standards seek to insure more than the minimal adequacy required by the Constitution under Youngberg.\nMoreover, he found no articulation by appellants of a standard to which JCAH norms could be compared to\ndetermine their conformity with constitutional requirements. Appellants therefore, he held, could not make a\nshowing of liability based solely on non-accreditation.\nAs to the equal protection claims, the judge concluded that the state did not invidiously discriminate among\nsimilarly-situated individuals. Patients in state mental institutions, appellants conceded, tended to be involuntarily\ncommitted, while patients treated in private hospitals were uniformly present there on voluntary status. The\nstatutory criteria for involuntary commitment, as Judge Neaher construed them, \"anticipate an individual who is\nfar more ill than those patients capable of voluntarily committing themselves.\" 559 F.Supp. at 1168. Appellants,\nthe judge held, also failed to make the requisite showing of motive to support a claim of racial discrimination\nunder the equal protection clause.\nThis left only one issue before the court: appellants' claim that, as to a particular state institution, loss of\naccreditation and/or certification might signal inadequacies so great as to amount to a constitutional violation.\nThis \"issue turns on facts unique to a given facility,\" the judge decided, and \"[c]ommon questions concerning\nclass members are therefore no longer present in this action.\" Id. at 1169. A class action so conceived would\n\"embroil this Court in a clearly unmanageable monitoring of the entire State mental health system.\" Id. Rather\nthan assume such a burden which \"was not contemplated ... in the grant of class certification,\" the judge held that\nthe \"dismissal of all existing claims and related motions\" compelled the dismissal of the action in toto, and so\ngranted appellees' summary judgment motion. Woe appeals.\nII\nAppellants invoke several different legal theories in support of their claim that the State is depriving them of their\nright to adequate care and treatment. We shall consider their claims seriatim, and then proceed to resolve\nperipheral matters raised in this litigation.\n\nA. Constitutionality of Mental Health Law\nOur court has recently upheld the NYMHL against a procedural due process challenge to the standards for\nvoluntary, involuntary and emergency civil commitment under that law. Project Release v. Prevost, 722 F.2d 960\n(2d Cir.1983). Appellants' challenge here carries the argument a step further. They allege that the New York civil\ncommitment statutes are unconstitutional \"because they only examine who should be committed and how one\n102 should *102 be committed. They [do] not require, quid pro quo, that adequate care be given the patient after\ninvoluntary civil commitment.\"\nContrary to appellants' assertions, however, the NYMHL explicitly provides a right to care and treatment for\ninstitutionalized mental patients. § 33.03(a), appropriately captioned \"Quality of Care and Treatment,\" states:\nEach patient in a facility and each person receiving services for mental disability shall receive care\nand treatment that is suited to his needs and skillfully, safely, and humanely administered with full\nrespect for his dignity and personal integrity.\nState regulations elaborate upon the requirements of this section, providing inter alia for individual service plans\nfor each patient, nondiscriminatory treatment, an appropriate physical environment, and suitable medical care. \nSee 14 N.Y.C.R.R. Part 27.\nNor is this statutory right merely precatory. The NYMHL vests responsibility for insuring that patients receive\nstatutorily-mandated care at several levels within the administrative hierarchy. The director of each state mental\nhealth facility must \"require the development of a written treatment plan to assure adequate care and treatment\nfor each patient.\" NYMHL § 29.13(a). The State Office of Mental Health is charged with the duty of\nseeing that mentally ill persons are provided with care and treatment, that such care, treatment\nand rehabilitation is of high quality and effectiveness, and that the personal and civil rights of\npersons receiving care, treatment and rehabilitation are adequately protected.\nNYMHL § 7.07. And § 31.19 of the NYMHL requires the Commissioner of Mental Health, whenever he has\nreason to believe that the rights of institutionalized patients are being violated, to \"issue an order directed to the\nperson who has committed the violation directing him to cease and desist.\" If this is unsuccessful, the\nCommissioner may seek an injunction or temporary restraining order from the New York Supreme Court barring\nthe offending conduct.\nThe power to enforce treatment rights does not rest solely within the state government. An individual who\nbelieves his statutory rights have been violated may seek to compel lawful action by means of a proceeding\nunder Article 78 of the New York Civil Practice Law. Or, he may attempt to compel his release from a state\ninstitution through habeas corpus. NYMHL § 33.15. In addition, the state regulations establish a procedure\nwhereby a patient may object to a specific treatment decision. 14 N.Y.C.R.R. § 27.8. This procedure was found to\nconform to constitutional requirements in Project Release v. Prevost, supra, 722 F.2d at 980-81.\nThe NYMHL thus does provide, on its face, for a right to care and treatment for civilly committed residents of\nstate mental institutions. Appellants also charge that the law is invalid as applied. To the extent this suggests that\nstate officials are failing to comply with the state's own treatment requirements, we are foreclosed from\nentertaining the claim by the Supreme Court's second decision in Pennhurst State School and Hospital v.\nHalderman, 8 U.S. 8, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984). Pennhurst II held that the Eleventh Amendment bars\na federal court from ordering a state official to conform his conduct to state law. Alternatively, to the extent\nappellants mean to suggest that state action is consistent with its own law yet in violation of the Federal\nConstitution, that issue is subsumed by appellants' other constitutional claims, to which we now turn.\n\nB. Equal protection claims\nAlthough the claims have evolved as this litigation has haltingly progressed towards its present status, the thrust\nof appellants' complaint has been the disparity between the quality of care furnished to the mentally ill in general\n103 hospital psychiatric wards, and that offered by state mental institutions. *103 They allege as much as a tenfold\ndifferential in per diem/per patient expenditures between the two types of institutions in the state. They also cite\nstatistics demonstrating that, while large numbers of voluntarily hospitalized patients are treated in state\ninstitutions, general hospitals do not treat patients who are involuntarily civilly committed.\nBased upon these data, appellants claim that those who receive inferior state treatment are, generally, more\nseriously ill, poorer, and more likely to be black than those cared for in non-state hospitals. This \"two-tier system,\"\nthey urge, amounts to invidious discrimination in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment.\nA statutory classification scheme does not, however, violate equal protection so long as it is rationally related to a\nlegitimate governmental purpose and does not impinge upon a \"suspect\" class or a fundamental constitutional\nright. Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297, 322-23, 100 S.Ct. 2671, 2690-91, 65 L.Ed.2d 784 (1980); San Antonio\nIndependent School District v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 16-17, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 1287-1288, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973).\n[5]\nAfter setting forth the NYMHL requirements for voluntary and involuntary commitment,  Judge Neaher\nconcluded:\nThe involuntarily committed patient presents different and greater care and treatment concerns to\nthe State, and ultimately to the institution in which he is confined, than does the less ill voluntary\npatient. These statutory distinctions also supply the obvious rational basis for the State's action.\nWoe v. Cuomo, supra, 559 F.Supp. at 1167. It is not necessarily the case that every involuntarily committed\npatient is more seriously ill than his voluntary counterpart; rather, the illnesses may be equally grave, but the\ninvoluntary patient may be unwilling to accept the liberty constraints which would accompany institutionalization,\nvoluntary or involuntary. Nevertheless, the state has, as the judge found, rationally distinguished among mental\npatients based upon the severity of their condition and the type of treatment which is appropriate. The statutory\ndichotomy, it is true, may not guarantee in every case that patients similarly situated as to mental illness will be\n[6]\ntreated identically.  But otherwise valid classifications are not undermined by imperfections of this sort. See \nDandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 485, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 1161, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970).\nThe level of scrutiny we must apply in this context is not heightened by appellants' suggestion that the New York\ncommitment laws discriminate on the basis of wealth and race. The Supreme Court has consistently held that\n104 poverty without more is not a suspect classification. Harris*104v. McRae, supra, 448 U.S. at 323, 100 S.Ct. at\n2691; see James v. Valtierra, 402 U.S. 137, 91 S.Ct. 1331, 28 L.Ed.2d 678 (1971). Appellants have not alleged\nthat the statutory scheme discriminates against a definable class of indigent persons, or that poverty has resulted\nin an absolute deprivation of a government benefit. See San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez,\nsupra, 411 U.S. at 22-25, 93 S.Ct. at 1290-1292. Nor have they made, or attempted to make, the showing of\nracially discriminatory motive necessary to justify stricter scrutiny on that ground. See Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S.\n55, 62-65, 100 S.Ct. 1490, 1497-1499, 64 L.Ed.2d 47 (1980); Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 96 S.Ct. 2040,\n48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1975); Legion v. Richardson, supra, 354 F.Supp. at 459.\nThat appellants have attempted to highlight important inequities in the system of care and treatment for the\nmentally ill, we have no doubt. Under the precedents by which we are bound, however, their claims simply are\nnot cognizable as equal protection violations. We therefore move on to the more troubling aspect of the case: the\nalleged violation of the due process right to treatment.\n\nC. Due process claims\nAppellants argue that when an individual is involuntarily committed to a mental institution, the state has an\nobligation to provide care and treatment adequate to allow that individual to improve his health and regain his\nliberty. They offer five standards by which the constitutional inadequacy of care may be gauged: (1) JCAH non-\naccreditation, (2) HHS non-certification, (3) reports of scandalous care by the media, other professionals, etc., (4)\nthe level of care provided by general hospital inpatient psychiatric facilities, and (5) commitment to the lower tier\nof the alleged \"two-tier\" system of mental health care. By any of these measures, they submit, appellants are\nbeing deprived of due process protection by being forced to accept inadequate treatment.\n1. The Right to Treatment\nThis court suggested some years ago that a constitutional right to treatment might well be an essential condition\nof the state's power of involuntary commitment. Schuster v. Herold, 410 F.2d 1071, 1087-89 (2d Cir.),cert.\ndenied,396 U.S. 847, 90 S.Ct. 81, 24 L.Ed.2d 96 (1969). Since then, numerous federal courts have\nacknowledged the existence of such a right. See, e.g., Scott v. Plante, 641 F.2d 117 (3d Cir.1981),vacated and\nremanded,458 U.S. 1101, 102 S.Ct. 3474, 73 L.Ed.2d 1362,on remand, 691 F.2d 634 (3d Cir.1982); Welsch v.\nLikins, 373 F.Supp. 487 (D.Minn.1974),partially vacated on other grounds, 550 F.2d 1122 (8th Cir.1977); Wyatt v.\nStickney, supra; Davis v. Watkins, 384 F.Supp. 1196 (1974),supplemented sub nom. Davis v. Balson, 461\nF.Supp. 842 (1978),supplemented sub nom. Davis v. Hubbard, 506 F.Supp. 915 (N.D.Ohio 1980); cf. Birnbaum, \nThe Right to Treatment, 46 A.B.A.J. 499 (1960). The recognition of the right to treatment has been based upon\n105 several different grounds.[7] At bottom, *105 however, courts have acknowledged that the \"massive curtailment of\nliberty\" associated with involuntary confinement, Humphrey v. Cady, 405 U.S. 504, 509, 92 S.Ct. 1048, 1052, 31\nL.Ed.2d 394 (1972), dictates that the \"nature and duration of commitment bear some reasonable relation to the\npurpose for which the individual is committed.\" Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715, 738, 92 S.Ct. 1845, 1858, 32\nL.Ed.2d 435 (1972). If the justification for commitment rests, even in part, upon the need for care and treatment,\nas it does under New York law, see NYMHL §§ 9.01, 9.27(a), 9.37(a), then a State which commits must also\ntreat.\nThe Supreme Court has not directly addressed the question whether a constitutional right to treatment exists. \nSee, e.g., Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman (Pennhurst I), 451 U.S. 1, 31, 101 S.Ct. 1531,\n1547, 67 L.Ed.2d 694 (1981); O'Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U.S. 563, 573, 95 S.Ct. 2486, 2492, 45 L.Ed.2d 396\n(1975). In Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982), however, the Court did\nresolve a claim involving an institutionalized mentally retarded individual's right to habilitation 00 that is, to \"training\n97\nand development of needed skills.\" Id. at 317, 102 S.Ct. at 2459. While the Youngberg Court refrained from\ndeciding the existence of a right to treatment per se, see id. at 325-27, 102 S.Ct. at 2463-64 (Blackmun, J.,\n[8]\nconcurring), its analysis can assist us in charting our course through the rough terrain of this case.\nYoungberg involved an individual action by a mentally retarded resident of Pennhurst who claimed injury due to\nhis own behavior, attacks by others, and excessive physical restraint by the staff. He asserted, and the Third\nCircuit agreed, that he possessed Fourteenth Amendment rights to safety, freedom of movement and training.\nBecause the resident, Romeo, was so profoundly retarded that there was no realistic possibility of his ever\nleaving the institution, the Supreme Court addressed his right to training only to the extent necessary to protect\nhis liberty interests in personal security and freedom from restraint. It held that the State was obligated to provide\n\"minimally adequate or reasonable training\" appropriate to Romeo's particular needs. Id. at 319, 102 S.Ct. at\n2460.\nIn determining the reasonableness of training provided by an institution, the Supreme Court said, \"courts must\nshow deference to the judgment exercised by a qualified professional.\" Id. at 322, 102 S.Ct. at 2461. The majority\nelaborated:\n\n... the [training] decision, if made by a professional, is presumptively valid; liability may be imposed\nonly when the decision by the professional is such a substantial departure from accepted\nprofessional judgment, practice, or standards as to demonstrate that the person responsible\nactually did not base the decision on such a judgment.\nId. at 323, 102 S.Ct. at 2462. The question suggested by Youngberg, then, is not what treatment was actually\nprovided, but whether the treatment decision was professionally made and falls within the scope of professional\n[9]\nacceptability.\nWith this formulation in hand, we can now return to the case at bar. Three of appellants' five proffered standards\ndo not retain any viability under the Youngberg analysis. Standards (4) and (5) both turn on the disparity in quality\n106 of care between what appellants have dubbed \"upper tier\" *106 general hospitals and \"lower tier\" state mental\ninstitutions. Assuming the alleged divergence exists, it does not bear on the question whether treatment by the\nlatter is actually informed by professional judgment. Nor do media reports provide any systematic enlightenment\nin that respect, as standard (3) would suggest. Disapproval by JCAH and HHS, however, upon which standards\n(1) and (2) are predicated, does come closer to the mark.\nThe court below held that \"JCAH accreditation criteria comport with or exceed due process requirements, and\nthat JCAH accreditation is prima facie proof of adequate care.\" Woe v. Cuomo, supra, 559 F.Supp. at 1162. We\nagree that JCAH approval represents an \"exercise of professional judgment\" to which we must defer under \nYoungberg. This is true not solely because, as the district court stated, \"JCAH is a highly respected organization\nof psychiatric and medical professionals, and the value of its accreditation program has been recognized by\nCongress and the courts.\" Id. at 1164. It also has merit because many of the JCAH criteria bear directly on the\nlikelihood that professional judgments will govern individual treatment decisions within the institution. JCAH\nstandards address the existence, quality and specificity of patient treatment plans. They require clear procedures\nfor the use of drug and other therapies, including written approval by a physician. They examine the availability of\nmedical care in all respects, and the manner in which it is provided. The JCAH process thus seeks to assure that\n[10]\nthe facility itself is structured so that decisions will be professionally made.\nWe agree with appellants and the district court that JCAH accreditation is merely prima facie proof of adequacy,\nand that a court is not barred from probing behind it if presented with evidence that JCAH has, across-the-board\nor in a given instance, allowed its standards to slip below constitutional benchmarks. Youngberg did not suggest\nthat the judgment of the state's professionals was necessarily conclusive. On the contrary, the Court indicated\nthat the testimony of Romeo's experts should have been admitted as relevant to the professional acceptability of\nthe training he was receiving. Youngberg, supra, 457 U.S. at 323 n. 31, 102 S.Ct. at 2462 n. 31. Thus, on a\nproper showing, a court should be prepared to allow inquiry into the adequacy of treatment even at an accredited\nfacility.\nAfter scrutinizing this record, we find that appellants have made such a showing with respect to only one\ninstitution, South Beach Psychiatric Center. South Beach, although JCAH-accredited, lost its HHS certification in\n[11]\n1982.  The monitoring team's report which led to this action indicated numerous deficiencies which go directly\nto the \"professional judgment\" standard. A few excerpts will demonstrate: \"Psychological evaluations ... were\nconspicuously absent ... Individual comprehensive treatment plans (ITP) were absent ... drug interactions were\nnot adequately monitored ... nurses were administering medications from unclear physicians' orders ...\" This\nsurvey was performed by a team of consultants recommended by the National Institute of Mental Health, and\n107 rebuts the presumption of adequacy which JCAH approval carries. Given these conflicting evaluations, we are \n*107 compelled to conclude that the district judge erred in deciding, on a summary judgment motion, that\nappellants had failed to raise genuine issues of material fact as to the inadequacy of care at South Beach.\nFed.R.Civ.P. 56; see Schering Corp. v. Home Insurance Co., 712 F.2d 4 (2d Cir.1983), and cases cited therein.\nOf course, where a facility lacks accreditation by JCAH, not even a prima facie showing of adequacy exists. At\noral argument, the parties agreed that the other target of appellants' October 1982 motion, Manhattan Psychiatric\nCenter, has since regained its accreditation. They also stated that Mid-Hudson Psychiatric Center, at least some\nproportion of whose residents are class members, had lost JCAH approval. Appellants claim that appellees failed\n\nto inform them or the district court of this fact. In any event, we believe the entry of summary judgment, denying\nappellants an opportunity to prove their allegations, would be inappropriate as to that or any other institution\nlosing accreditation or approval prior to final judgment.\n2. Appropriateness of Class Action\nThe maintenance of this action as it would now be constituted, however, depends upon the issue of class\ncertification. Judge Neaher, noting that the \"complexion of this action has changed dramatically\" since it\noriginated, determined that the class he had originally certified was no longer viable. He acknowledged that the\nissue \"whether a non-JCAH accredited facility can be found to have fallen below the standards of minimum care\nguaranteed by the due process clause\" was still outstanding, Woe v. Cuomo, supra, 559 F.Supp. at 1169. Yet\nfinding the action now \"clearly unmanageable,\" id., he decertified the class and, since no litigating party\nremained, dismissed the action in its entirety.\nWe find it odd that, having initially certified a massive class representing present and future individuals committed\nto all state institutions, the judge should now object to the scaled-down version of the litigation. Moreover, it is\nsimply not the case that appellants \"originally complained of conditions in one psychiatric center,\" id. at 1168; the\nfocus of their complaint has been state-wide since its initiation. It is often proper, as we noted in Green v. Wolf\nCorp., 406 F.2d 291, 298 (2d Cir.1968),cert. denied,395 U.S. 977, 89 S.Ct. 2131, 23 L.Ed.2d 766 (1969), for a\ndistrict court to view a class action liberally in the early stages of litigation, since the class can always be modified\nor subdivided as issues are refined for trial. Indeed, it is an extreme step to dismiss a suit simply by decertifying a\nclass, where a \"potentially proper class\" exists and can easily be created. See Ford v. United States Steel Corp.,\n638 F.2d 753, 760 (5th Cir.1981).\nWe are also concerned about possible prejudice to members of a class who failed or were unable to take\nindependent steps to protect their rights precisely because they were members of the class. We note, for\nexample, that the respondent in Youngberg was forced to drop his claims for injunctive relief prior to trial,\nbecause they were already pending in another class action relating to the facility in which he was housed. \nYoungberg v. Romeo, supra, 457 U.S. at 311, 102 S.Ct. at 2455. For the reasons we have attempted to articulate\nwith some precision, we believe the district judge abused his discretion by decertifying the class.\nOn remand, subclasses should be certified as appropriate to press the outstanding claims we have identified.\nWithout attempting to control the future course of this litigation, we would also suggest that the district judge\nconsider employing more systematic methods of factfinding relating to the institutions still at issue. The services\nof a magistrate acting as special master might well expedite the proceedings. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 53. Discovery\nbetween the parties has done little to move the case forward until now, and the state has appeared reluctant to\nproduce the primary material upon which appellants could construct their case. Placing the investigation under\n108 the aegis of the court and a magistrate *108 might inure to the benefit of both parties.\nIn addition, we note that mental institutions within the New York State system have lost and regained\naccreditation even within the course of this litigation. We would expect, of course, that the district judge will\nreexamine the facts as they exist at the time he revises class certification and as they evolve thereafter. Our\ndiscussion of the implications of nonaccreditation and noncertification should serve as a guide in analyzing the\n[12]\nstatus of the appellants' case with respect to all of the hospitals at issue.\nIII\nAppellants' counsel also seeks an award of attorneys' fees for his efforts to date. Although we applaud his efforts\non behalf of the unfortunate, forgotten, and all-too-often unrepresented members of the appellant class, we are\nbarred from making an award in these circumstances. See Hanrahan v. Hampton, 446 U.S. 754, 100 S.Ct. 1987,\n64 L.Ed.2d 670 (1980). In any event, we believe this issue is more appropriately left to the discretion of the\nconscientious district judge, who bears the primary burden of shepherding this litigation.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court with respect to the state law and equal protection claims,\nand reverse and remand the right-to-treatment claim to the extent we have hitherto indicated.\n[1] W. Shakespeare, Macbeth, Act V, scene iii.\n[2] Judge Neaher later entered a Rule 54(b) certification as to the Medicaid claim against the federal defendants,\nand an appeal was taken to this court, which affirmed. 562 F.2d 40 (2d Cir.1977). No certification was made on\nthe state law claim, which therefore remains part of this appeal.\n[3] On March 18, 1977, the federal defendants filed a \"Suggestion of Death\" with the Court, in which they sought\ndismissal of the action by reason of Woe's death. Appellants submitted an autopsy report indicating that the\ncause of death was an overdose of psychotropic medication. Because the class had already been certified, the\naction proceeded despite the death of the named plaintiff.\n[4] Appellants also sought to add a new class of plaintiffs represented by Frank Foe. This class would have\nasserted the unconstitutionality of the federal requirement that JCAH accreditation of mental hospitals serve as a\ncondition precedent to patients' eligibility for certain Supplemental Security Income benefits. Woe v. Mathews,\nsupra, 408 F.Supp. at 430-31. Joinder of that claim was denied.\n[5] We have previously analyzed these requirements in Project Release v. Prevost, supra, 722 F.2d at 965-66. In\nbrief, voluntary hospitalization requires that a person have a \"mental illness for which in-patient care and\ntreatment in a hospital is appropriate.\" NYMHL § 9.01. Involuntary commitment is possible under three\ncircumstances. The individual must have (1) \"a mental illness for which care and treatment as a patient in a\nhospital is essential to such person's welfare and whose judgment is so impaired that he is unable to understand\nthe need for such care and treatment,\" id. §§ 9.27(a), 9.01; (2) \"a mental illness for which immediate inpatient\ncare and treatment in a hospital is appropriate and which is likely to result in serious harm to himself or others,\" \nid. § 9.37(a); or (3) \"a mental illness for which immediate observation, care, and treatment in a hospital is\nappropriate and which is likely to result in serious harm to himself or others,\" id. § 9.39(a).\n[6] Judge Neaher somewhat overstated the statutory distinction between voluntarily and involuntarily committed\nindividuals: \"A voluntary patient must appreciate the nature and consequences of his commitment; in contrast, an\ninvoluntarily committed patient's confinement is conditioned upon his inability to comprehend the nature of his\nillness and his need for treatment.\" Woe v. Cuomo, supra, 559 F.Supp. at 1168-69. He is certainly correct as to\npersons involuntarily committed pursuant to NYMHL § 9.27(a), see note 5 supra. However, a person involuntarily\ncommitted pursuant to § 9.37 or 9.39 may resist institutionalization for reasons other than lack of comprehension\nof his need for treatment, which is not a statutory requirement for commitment under those subsections.\n[7] Some courts have reasoned that, because treatment is a major if not the only legitimate purpose for\ninvoluntary commitment, committed individuals must be given treatment which has a realistic possibility of\nimproving their condition. See, e.g., Welsch v. Likins, supra; Wyatt v. Stickney, supra. Others have suggested that\ntreatment is an essential quid pro quo because involuntary commitment does not require the rigorous procedural\nsafeguards associated with criminal conviction, yet may result in an equally great deprivation of liberty. See, e.g., \nHarper v. Cserr, 544 F.2d 1121 (1st Cir.1976). Finally, by analogy to the First Amendment analysis of Shelton v.\nTucker, 364 U.S. 479, 488, 81 S.Ct. 247, 252, 5 L.Ed.2d 231 (1960), courts have required that a treatment\nprogram be the \"least restrictive alternative\" available for a particular individual. Rennie v. Klein, 653 F.2d 836 (3d\nCir.1981) (en banc), vacated and remanded,458 U.S. 1119, 102 S.Ct. 3506, 73 L.Ed.2d 1381 (1982),on\nremand, 720 F.2d 266 (1983). It is unclear to what extent any or all of these approaches retains vitality in light of\nthe Supreme Court's recent decision in Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28\n(1982), discussed infra. For differing views on that point, see Rennie v. Klein, supra, 720 F.2d at 268, 271\n(Adams, J., concurring in the result), and 275-77 (Weis, J., concurring).\n[8]Youngberg was evidently not to be confined to its facts. Rennie v. Klein, supra, dealing with the right of\ninvoluntarily committed mental patients to refuse medication, was remanded for reconsideration in light of \nYoungberg. So was Scott v. Plante, supra, which involved claims of inadequate and overly-restrictive treatment.\n\nJust how broadly Youngberg is to be interpreted, however, remains an open question. See Doe v. New York City\nDept. of Social Services, 709 F.2d 782, 789-90 (2d Cir.1983).\n[9] The Supreme Court has emphasized deference to the judgment of psychological professionals in prior cases. \nSee, e.g., Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584, 99 S.Ct. 2493, 61 L.Ed.2d 101 (1979). For a critique of this approach, \nsee \"The Supreme Court, 1981 Term,\" 96 Harv.L.Rev. 62, 84-86 (1982).\n[10]Cf. Society for Good Will to Retarded Children v. Cuomo, 572 F.Supp. 1300, 1345 (E.D.N.Y.1983) (\"Lack of\npersonnel capable of exercising professional judgment in many individual cases itself represents a failure to\nprovide constitutionally safe conditions.\")\n[11] We must respectfully disagree with the district judge that \"because HHS certification itself is dependent upon\nJCAH accreditation, 42 U.S.C. § 1395x(f), it is unnecessary to reach the issues concerning loss of HHS\ncertification.\" Woe v. Cuomo, supra, 559 F.Supp. at 1159. While the statement is superficially true, the Secretary\nof HHS also is statutorily authorized to decertify even a JCAH-accredited facility, if his own survey indicates\n\"significant deficiencies.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1395bb(b) (1976). Thus, loss of HHS certification may signal inadequate\ninstitutional conditions even where JCAH accreditation is in order.\n[12] Subsequent to oral argument, appellants have indicated to us that an additional hospital, Bronx Psychiatric\nCenter, has lost accreditation. We leave consideration of that fact, if true, to the district judge on remand.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Halleck, New York State Office of Mental Health, Albany, N.Y., for defendants.\nOPINION AND ORDER APPROVING SETTLEMENT\nBARTELS, District Judge.\nI. BACKGROUND\nThis case has a long and tortured history. It was commenced on June 27, 1975, on behalf of all patients\ninvoluntarily committed to the care and custody of New York State mental hospitals, as a broadscale challenge to\nthe constitutionality of the policies and operation of the public mental health system in New York State. By\namended complaint filed August 15, 1975, plaintiffs claimed that defendants had deprived involuntary patients of\ntheir constitutional rights to adequate care and treatment while under the care and custody of the State of New\nYork.\nOn January 16, 1976, the Honorable Edward R. Neaher of this District certified the lawsuit as a class action. See \nWoe v. Mathews, 408 F.Supp. 419 (E.D.N.Y.1976),remanded in part and dismissed in part sub nom., Woe v.\nWeinberger, 556 F.2d 563 (2d Cir.1977),aff'd,562 F.2d 40 (2d Cir.1977),cert. denied sub nom., Woe v. Califano,\n434 U.S. 1048, 98 S.Ct. 895, 54 L.Ed.2d 799 (1978). But see Woe v. Cuomo, 559 F.Supp. 1158 (E.D.N.Y.) \nmandamus denied sub nom., In re Woe, 723 F.2d 895 (2d Cir.1983)and723 F.2d 895 (2d Cir.1983),aff'd in part,\nrev'd in part, Woe v. Cuomo, 729 F.2d 96 (2d Cir.1984),cert. denied,469 U.S. 936, 105 S.Ct. 339, 83 L.Ed.2d\n274 (1984). The class certified consisted of all persons between the ages of 21 and 65 who were then or would\ncome to be involuntarily civilly committed to New York State mental institutions. 408 F.Supp. at 429. The persons\naffected by the settlement agreement sub judice are in effect a subclass consisting of involuntarily civilly\ncommitted patients between the ages of 21 and 65 who are being treated at the Bronx Psychiatric Center, Bronx,\nNew York (\"BPC\"). The defendants in the present case are state officials who have varying degrees of\nresponsibility for either the operation of BPC, the promulgation and implementation of policies pertaining to the\nplaintiff class, or the provision of services to the plaintiff class. Plaintiffs' claims against the state officials are\nderived from the first claim of the Amended Complaint dated August 15, 1975, at 9-14, which essentially alleges\ndenial of constitutionally adequate care and treatment in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Plaintiffs claim that, inter alia, a shortage of qualified staff, overcrowding of\nhospital living units, lack of adequate health care, and failure to provide active treatment amount to a denial of the\nright of involuntarily civilly committed patients to constitutionally adequate care and services. Defendants deny\nthese allegations.\nFor nine years, from 1975 to 1984, extensive motion practice ensued, see Woe v. Cuomo, 729 F.2d 96, 99-101,\n109 culminating in the dismissal of the action in toto, including *109 the claims going to institutions that had lost\n\naccreditation by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals (\"JCAH\"). Id. at 101. On February 22, 1984,\nthe Court of Appeals remanded to this Court plaintiffs' claims concerning the adequacy of care and treatment at\nNew York State mental hospitals that lose accreditation either by JCAH or by the federal Department of Health\nand Human Services (\"HHS\"). See Woe v. Cuomo, 729 F.2d 96, 108 (2d Cir.1984).\nOn April 9, 1985, plaintiffs moved for, inter alia, a preliminary injunction against further admissions to BPC, which\n[1]\nat that time had lost JCAH and HHS accreditation.  After seven days of hearings, Judge Neaher found that the\nquality of care at BPC had fallen below constitutionally adequate standards, largely as a result of \"chronic and\npersistant overcrowding....\" Woe by Woe v. Cuomo, 638 F.Supp. 1506, 1512 (E.D.N.Y.), aff'd in part, remanded in\npart,801 F.2d 627 (2d Cir.1986). See also801 F.2d at 628. On July 1, 1986, Judge Neaher enjoined defendants\nfrom admitting any additional patients to BPC. 638 F.Supp. 1506.\nOn September 29, 1986, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's factual findings but stayed\nenforcement of the injunction prohibiting further admissions. 801 F.2d 627. The case was remanded to this Court\nto afford defendants the opportunity to present evidence concerning the constitutionality of care at BPC, to\nconsider the implications of and alternatives to a freeze on admissions to BPC, and for a trial on the merits. Id. at\n630-31.\nHearings on remand commenced November 19, 1986. On December 2, 1986, Judge Neaher recused himself.\nThe case was first reassigned to the Honorable Henry Bramwell, and upon Judge Bramwell's retirement was\nreassigned to the undersigned on January 14, 1986.\nIn May, 1987, Doctor Morton Birnbaum and Mr. Burton Zukerman having withdrawn as plaintiffs' attorney, and Mr.\nMichael Lottman having been substituted in their place, the parties began to explore the possibility of settlement.\nA proposed settlement agreement (the \"Proposed Agreement\") was filed with the Court on August 26, 1988.\nOn October 25 and 27, 1988, hearings were held pursuant to Rule 23(e), Fed.R. Civ.P., for the purpose of\ndetermining whether the Proposed Agreement is fair, reasonable, adequate, and should be approved by the\nCourt. The October 25 hearing was held at BPC and was devoted primarily to the presentation of comments from\nmembers of the plaintiff class, attorneys for both sides, and BPC staff members. No objections were filed at that\nhearing. The October 27 hearing was held at the federal courthouse and was devoted to the presentation of\ncomments by interested parties who are not members of the plaintiff class. Objections were filed at that hearing\nby Dr. Birnbaum and Mr. Zuckerman.\nII. DISCUSSION\n[2]\nRule 23(e), Fed.R.Civ.P., requires Court approval before class actions may be settled.  The role of the Court,\nhowever, is strictly limited in that the settlement hearings may not be turned \"into a trial or a rehersal of the trial,\" \nNewman v. Stein, 464 F.2d 689, 692 (2d Cir.) (internal quotations omitted), cert. denied sub nom., Benson v.\nNewman, 409 U.S. 1039, 93 S.Ct. 521, 34 L.Ed.2d 488 (1972); the Court may not substitute its judgment of what\nis fair for that of the parties, Evans v. Jeff D., 475 U.S. 717, 727, 106 S.Ct. 1531, 1537, 89 L.Ed.2d 747 (1986);\n110 and the Court may not \"reopen and enter into negotiations with the litigants in the hope of improving the *110\nterms of the settlement ...,\" Levin v. Mississippi River Corp., 59 F.R.D. 353, 361 (S.D.N.Y.), aff'd,486 F.2d 1398\n(2d Cir.),cert. denied,414 U.S. 1112, 94 S.Ct. 843, 38 L.Ed.2d 739 (1973). See also In re Agent Orange Product\nLiability Litigation, 597 F.Supp. 740, 760 (E.D.N.Y.1984),aff'd,818 F.2d 145 (2d Cir.1987). See generally 7B\nWright, Miller, & Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure § 1797 at 356-58 (1986). The Court's role consists of\ndeciding whether the Proposed Agreement is \"fair, reasonable and adequate,\" Weinberger v. Kedrick, 698 F.2d\n61, 73 (2d Cir.1982),cert. denied sub nom., Coyne v. Weinberger, 464 U.S. 818, 104 S.Ct. 77, 78 L.Ed.2d 89\n(1983), and, given the plaintiff class in this case, the Court is especially mindful of its additional role as guardian\nto class members who may lack the intellectual resources to press objections to the Proposed Agreement. See\nId. at 69 n. 10; National Super Spuds v. New York Mercantile Exchange, 660 F.2d 9, 20 (2d Cir.1981) (in\n[3]\nreviewing settlement, court has responsibility to protect class members who cannot protect themselves).\n\nKeeping in mind that the law favors settlement, Weinberger, 693 F.2d at 73, especially in class actions, In re\nWarner Communications Securities Litigation, 618 F.Supp. 735, 740 (S.D.N.Y.1985),aff'd,798 F.2d 35 (2d\nCir.1986), the Court must decide whether a proposed settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate, by comparing\nthe terms of the compromise with the likely rewards of litigation, Protective Committee for Independent\nStockholders of TMT Trailer Ferry, Inc. v. Anderson, 390 U.S. 414, 424-25, 88 S.Ct. 1157, 1163-64, 20 L.Ed.2d 1\n(1968); Weinberger, 698 F.2d at 73; City of Detroit v. Grinnell Corp., 495 F.2d 448, 455 (2d Cir.1974); In re Agent\nOrange, 597 F.Supp. at 762. To make this comparison, the Second Circuit has posited several criteria, those\npertinant to cases involving injunctive relief being A) the complexity, expense, and likely duration of the litigation;\nB) the reaction of the class to the settlement; C) the stage of the proceeding and the amount of discovery\ncompleted; D) the risks of establishing liability; E) the ability of plaintiffs to obtain, and of defendants to withstand,\na greater judgment; F) the range of reasonableness of the settlement in light of the best possible recovery; and\nG) the negotiating process that gave rise to the settlement. See Grinnell, 495 F.2d at 463.\nTaking all these criteria into account, and viewing the Proposed Agreement in light of the \"totality of the\ncircumstances,\" In re Agent Orange, 597 F.Supp. at 761 (quoting Grunin v. International House of Pancakes, 513\nF.2d 114, 124 (8th Cir.),cert. denied,423 U.S. 864, 96 S.Ct. 124, 46 L.Ed.2d 93 (1975)), the Court finds the\nProposed Agreement to be fair, reasonable, and adequate.\nA. The complexity, expense, and likely duration of the litigation\nThis case, involving care and services at a large urban psychiatric hospital serving some 650 patients at any\ngiven time, is precisely the kind of case where settlement would serve the plaintiff class and the interests of\njustice. Establishing the unconstitutionality of care at BPC would require a showing that the care at BPC\nconstitutes a substantial departure from accepted professional judgment, practice, or standards, see Youngberg\nv. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 323, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 2462, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1981); Woe v. Cuomo, 729 F.2d at 105, and\nwould, perforce, involve the calling of numerous witnesses to establish a pattern or practice of substandard\nconditions at the BPC, inevitably followed by a \"battle of the experts.\" A trial would be complex, lengthy, and\nexpensive, and, even if favorable to plaintiffs, certainly would not end the matter since defendants have already\n[4]\ndisplayed their interest in resorting to the appellate process. Approval of the Proposed Agreement is indicated.\n111  B. The reaction of the class to the settlement\n*111\nTo date, no written objections to the settlement have been received from or on behalf of members of the plaintiff\nclass although such objections were solicited in the Notice of Proposed Class Action Settlement and Fairness\nHearings. At the hearings held on October 25 and 27, no substantive objections were made to the provisions of\nthe Proposed Agreement (except for the objections of Dr. Birnbaum and Mr. Zuckerman, dealt with infra), and the\nindividualistic concerns that were raised, such as they were, did not raise any serious reasons why the settlement\nmight be unfair. See Wright, Miller, & Kane, supra § 1797.1 at 412 (court must independently evaluate whether\nobjections raised suggest serious reasons why proposal might be unfair).\nC. The stage of the proceedings and the amount of discovery\ncompleted\nThe BPC aspects of this case are three years old and the state-wide class action as a whole is now entering its\nfourteenth year. The conditions at BPC have already been the subject of a trial, appeal of preliminary relief, and\nsix days of further hearings on remand. Mr. Michael Lottman, attorney for the plaintiff class, has reviewed the\nDistrict Court and Court of Appeals decisions in this case; the record of the trial before Judge Neaher and of the\nhearings on remand; the pleadings and appellate briefs; reports on care and conditions at BPC compiled by\nJCAH, HHS, and the New York State Commission of Quality of Care for the Mentally Disabled, as well as internal\ndocuments of BPC and the New York State Office of Mental Health; and, in response to an informal discovery\nrequest, was provided with, and has reviewed, hundreds of pages of additional documentation, including hospital\n\npolicies and manuals, statistics, and external and internal reports. Declaration of Michael Lottman, dated October\n24, 1988 (\"Lottman Affid.\"), ¶ 6. Mr. Lottman estimates that he reviewed a total of 10,000 pages of relevant\nmaterial before making a determination regarding setlement of this case. Id. Furthermore, since becoming\ninvolved in this case Mr. Lottman has personally visited the BPC to meet with administrators, talk to patients, and\ninspect living units and program areas on four separate occasions. Id. Mr. Lottman is also very experienced in\nthis type of case, which gives him a sound foundation for evaluating all this data.\nClearly, then, both the knowledge of plaintiffs' counsel and the proceedings themselves have reached a stage so\nthat an intelligent evaluation of the case and the propriety of settlement can be made.\nD. The risks of establishing liability\nUnder the present set of circumstances it is not at all certain that plaintiffs would prevail in a trial on the merits. \nSee Affidavit of Arnold D. Fleischer, dated October 21, 1988 (\"Fleischer Affid.\"), ¶ 4. Subsequent to Judge\nNeaher's 1986 finding of unconstitutionally inadequate care at BPC conditions have changed materially. The\nmost important of these changes are that the BPC patient poulation in relation to bed space has decreased and\nJCAH accreditation has been restored. Since plaintiff's would be an uphill battle at trial, see Woe v. Cuomo, 729\nF.2d at 106 (JCAH accreditation is prima facie proof of adequacy of care), the risks of establishing liability clearly\ncounsel approval of the Proposed Agreement. See Harris v. Pernsley, supra (inter alia, uncertain outcome of\nlitigation indicated fairness, adequacy, and reasonableness of agreement); Wilder v. Bernstein, 645 F.Supp.\n1292, 1341 (S.D.N. Y.1986) (inter alia, uncertainty of establishing liability indicated fairness of agreement settling\nclass action which challenged as unconstitutional city's statutory scheme for provision of child care services), \n112 aff'd,848 F.2d 1338 (2d Cir.1988); In re Agent*112Orange, 597 F.Supp. at 857 (difficulty in establishing plaintiffs'\ncase and the uncertainties associated with a trial indicated that settlement was in the interest of the plaintiffs and\nthe public).\nE. The ability of plaintiffs to obtain, and of defendants to withstand, a\nmore demanding judgment\nThe Court believes that the Proposed Agreement will result in significant benefits to the plaintiff class and will\nremedy many of the problems at BPC for which relief was demanded in the complaint. The Proposed Agreement\nconfers upon the plaintiff class general rights and entitlements to adequate care and decent treatment; prohibits\ndiscrimination with respect to any rights conferred; requires BPC to maintain JCAH accreditation and to attempt\nto regain HHS accreditation during the lifetime of the settlement agreement; sets specific population limits for\neach ward as a whole; holds BPC to at least the same overall staff-to-patient ratio that existed when JCAH\naccreditation was reinstated; requires adequate treatment and discharge planning, programming designed to\nequip patients for more independent functioning, and enhanced efforts to ensure the quality of such\nprogramming; mandates adequate programs and alternative placements for BPC patients whose primary\ndiagnosis is mental retardation; and provides due process protections with respect to medical and treatment\ndecisions, including ward assignments and limitations on rights and privileges. Foremost, however, the Proposed\nAgreement is actually designed to remedy, not just forbid, BPC's chronic overcrowding: programming and\nalternative placements are to be implemented to expedite the ulitimate goal of getting patients out of the BPC,\nand a schedule of capital improvements incorporated into the Proposed Agreement is designed to make more\nroom for the patients who remain at the BPC. Moreover, the Proposed Agreement provides for continuing\njurisdiction by this Court of the implementation of the agreement.\nThere are constitutional and practical constraints on this Court's ability to fashion a remedy in the present case. \nSee Eckerhart v. Hensley, 475 F.Supp. 908, 915 (W.D.Mo.1979) (citing cases), aff'd,664 F.2d 294 (8th Cir.1981),\nvacated and remanded on other grounds,461 U.S. 424, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983), where the court\nexplained that the role of federal courts is not to sit as the supervisor or administrator of state-run institutions, and\nthat the court is ill-equipped to deal with the complex problems of running a state health care facility. The\nProposed Agreement is reasonably similar, perhaps even better, than the decree the Court could or would have\nissued after a trial on the merits. Furthermore, the extraordinary demands being placed on the public mental\n\nhealth system and the budget crisis that may be facing the state and federal governments, make it highly unlikely\nthat the defendants in the near future will have the capacity to do more than they are undertaking to do in the\nProposed Agreement. As the parties themselves point out, \"[b]y holding out for more, plaintiffs could well wind up\nwith less.\" Joint Memorandum of Law in Support of Proposed Settlement, dated October 25, 1988, at 14.\nF. The range of reasonableness of the settlement in light of the best\npossible recovery\nThe plaintiffs do not want a money judgment and they do not want a court decree. What the plaintiffs want is\nenforceable rights to adequate care and services. As discussed supra, the Court is of the opinion that the\nProposed Agreement definitely confers benefits upon the plaintiff class and confers those benefits now. Further\ndelay would only be inimical to the interests of the plaintiff class. See Jones v. Amalgamated Warbasse Houses,\nInc., 97 F.R.D. 355, 359-60 (E.D.N.Y.1982),aff'd,721 F.2d 881 (2d Cir.1983),cert. denied,466 U.S. 944, 104\nS.Ct. 1929, 80 L.Ed.2d 474 (1984) (value of having benefits accrue from complex litigation now rather than\nreceiving same or lesser benefits at later date must be considered favorably in assessing adequacy of the\nsettlement).\n113 In light of the foregoing, the Court finds that the range of reasonableness of the *113 settlement in light of the\nbest possible recovery is high and favors approval of the Proposed Agreement. See Newman v. Stein, 464 F.2d\nat 693, where the court points out that in any particular case \"reasonableness\" encompasses a range of\npossibilities.\nG. The negotiating process that gave rise to the settlement\nGiven the Court's limited role under Fed. R.Civ.P. 23(e), \"attention has also been paid to the negotiating process\nby which settlement was reached, and courts have demanded that the compromise be the result of arm's length\nnegotiations....\" Weinberger, 698 F.2d at 74. Counsel for both parties aver that the Proposed Agreement is the\nproduct of one year's close and frank settlement negotiations, Fleischer Affid. ¶ 5; Lottman Affid. ¶¶ 11 & 12,\nenabling the parties to make an informed judgment as to the advantages of settling rather than proceeding to\ntrial, Fleischer Affid. ¶ 5; Lottman Affid. ¶ 11.\nAs there were protracted settlement negotiations, and as there is no evidence of collusion, the Court finds the\nProposed Agreement to be the product of arm's length negotiations. See Weinberger, 698 F.2d at 74.\nH. The notice of proposed settlement\nFed.R.Civ.P. 23(e) requires notice of proposed settlement of class actions to be given to members of the class.\nThe notice must fairly apprise the class members of the proposed settlement and of the options that are open to\nthem in connection with the proceeding. Furthermore, the notice must fairly, accurately, and neutrally describe the\nclaims and parties in the litigation as well as the terms of the proposed settlement and the identity of persons\nentitled to participate in it. Weinberger, 698 F.2d at 70.\nThe Notice of Proposed Settlement of Class Action and Fairness Hearings speaks for itself 00 it is accurate,\n97\nneutral, and complete. The painstaking efforts of counsel for plaintiffs to alert the plaintiff class to the Proposed\nAgreement and its terms have been brought to the attention of the Court and need not be recounted here. See\nAttorney's Declaration Re: Notice of Hearing, dated October 19, 1988; Certification of David Cohen, dated\nOctober 25, 1988. Suffice it to say that the Court finds that the notice given to the plaintiff class was more than\nadequate and fulfilled the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e) and due process.\n\nI. The Birnbaum/Zuckerman Objections\nBy letter to the Court dated October 24, 1988, Dr. Morton Birnbaum and Mr. Burton Zuckerman made the\nfollowing objections to the Proposed Agreement: 1) Precatory in nature; 2) Does not address overcrowding and\nunderstaffing; 3) Does not call for an HHS survey; 4) Has only four year estimated duration; 5) Does not provide\nfor adequate, individualized care; 6) Does not provide for the appointment of a master; and 7) Does not prevent\nthe transfer of patients to upstate facilities away from the BPC and continuity of care. Other, more particularized\nobjections were made which may be fairly considered subsumed in the seven objections listed above.\nAt the outset it should be noted that neither Birnbaum nor Zuckerman have standing in this case. They claim to\nrepresent \"R.L.\", who allegedly is a patient at BPC. If R.L. is indeed a member of the plaintiff class as Dr.\nBirnbaum claims, it is clear that Mr. Lottman is the proper representative of R.L.\nNevertheless the Court has carefully considered the proffered objections and, to the extent that they are\nmeritorious, finds that they are adequately addressed by the Proposed Agreement as discussed supra. Many of\nthe objections do not recognize the recent improvements that have taken place at BPC, particularly the\nreinstitution of JCAH accreditation. Furthermore, the underlying basis of certain of the objections is the apparent\nbelief of Dr. Birnbaum and Mr. Zuckerman that the Court must assume the role of managing the BPC ad infinitum.\nThe Court, of course, has no authority to do so.\nDr. Birnbaum and Mr. Zuckerman also object to the Court's alleged refusal to permit the New York Civil Liberties\n114 Union *114 and the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell to participate as co-counsel for the plaintiff class. This\nallegation is false. Sullivan & Cromwell never applied to become counsel in this case, and the Civil Liberties\nUnion, after strenuous solicitation by the Court to represent the plaintiffs, decided it could not enter the case due\nto chronic understaffing.\nFinally, Dr. Birnbaum and Mr. Zuckerman object to the Court's earlier finding that they have withdrawn as counsel\nfor the plaintiff class. This issue, as well as the issue of the Civil Liberties Union and Sullivan & Cromwell, is\nirrelevant here as it does not go to the fairness, reasonableness, or adequacy of the Proposed Agreement. In this\nregard, however, the Court simply reiterates its statements contained in the order of May 11, 1988, and in the\nminutes of the hearings held on May 9 and August 29 of 1988.\nCONCLUSION\nThe Court having considered the foregoing and the submissions and presentations of respective counsel for\nplaintiffs and defendants as well as the statements made at the hearings held on October 25 and 27, 1988, it is\nhereby ORDERED that:\n1. The Court approves the terms of the settlement with respect to the Bronx Psychiatric Center, as embodied in\nthe Stipulation of Settlement dated November 15, 1988, as being fair, reasonable, and adequate;\n2. The parties are directed to implement the settlement in accordance with the terms thereof; and\n3. The Court shall retain continuing jurisdiction over the action for all purposes.\n[1] JCAH accreditation was restored in early 1987.\n[2] Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e) provides in pertinant part: \"A class action shall not be ... compromised without the approval\nof the court, and notice of the proposed ... compromise shall be given to all members of the class in such manner\nas the court directs.\" The purpose of this rule is to protect the plaintiff class from unjust or unfair settlements\nwhen representatives become fainthearted before the action is adjudicated. 7B Wright, Miller, & Kane, Federal\nPractice & Procedure § 1797 at 340 (1986).\n\n[3] In partial satisfaction of its responsibilities as guardian, the Court itself toured the BPC in mid-September,\n1988.\n[4]See Harris v. Pernsley, 654 F.Supp. 1042 (E.D. Pa.1987) (settlement of class action which required adoption\nand implementation of procedures and policies to reduce population of state prison system and maintain\npopulation at agreed-upon levels was fair, adequate, and reasonable, and would be approved when litigation of\nthe constitutionality of the conditions of confinement in the prison system would have been very complex,\nextremely expensive, and most likely of great duration), aff'd,820 F.2d 592 (3d Cir.),cert. denied sub nom., \nCastille v.
