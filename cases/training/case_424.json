    "summary": "<p>On November 25, 1974, patients at the Rio Piedras Psychiatric Hospital (RPPH) in San Juan, Puerto Rico filed a class action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. The plaintiffs, represented by Puerto Rico Legal Services and the Civil Action and Education Corporation, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief. They alleged that their constitutional rights had been violated by overcrowding, inadequacies in the physical facilities, lack of security for personal belongings, lack of pillows, poor laundry service, unpleasant odors, insufficient therapeutic treatment, insufficient staffing, inadequate classification standards, and discrimination on the basis of geographical origin. The plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants would place them naked in isolation rooms, which lacked toilet facilities. Amicus Curae in the case included the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, the Comite De Convergencia Por La Salud Mental En Puerto Rico, and the Colegio De Medicos Cirujanos De Puerto Rico.</p><p>On June 3, 1977, the court issued a consent decree and closed the case.  The decree detailed 86 standards that the parties stipulated would be observed at RPPH in the future, and it included short term plans to remove patients with intellectual disabilities, as well as other long-term patients who didn't require hospitalization to the Cayey and Bayamon Psychosocial and Rehabilitation Centers. It also included the placement of additional patients in a foster care home program. The decree contained no express provisions that any of the 86 standards would be effectuated at any other facility than RPPH.</p><p>There was little activity in the case for seven years. On February 8, 1985, the district court (Judge Hector Manuel Laffitte) appointed Dr. David Helfeld as Special Master in the case and instructed him to report back to the court on the defendants' progress. On August 10, 1987, in response to the Special Master's report detailing the overcrowding at RPPH, the district court (Judge Laffitte) ordered that 144 patients be transferred to the Guerrero facility, noting that the patients should receive care and treatment consistent with the 86 stipulations in the original consent decree.  </p><p>On June 28, 1988, the defendants asked the district court to reclose the case, arguing that they had substantially complied with the court's orders.  On December 8, 1988, the district court (Judge Laffitte) denied this motion, ruling that the defendants were not in full compliance with the decree.  </p><p>On June 12, 1989, the plaintiffs asked the district court to hold the defendants in contempt, alleging that the patients that had been transferred to the Guerrero facility were not receiving adequate treatment. The defendants objected to this, arguing that the district court didn't have jurisdiction over Guerrero because the consent decree only pertained to RPPH. On December 28, 1989, the district court (Judge Laffitte) ruled that the consent decree did apply to RPPH patients being treated at the Guerrero facility.  </p><p>On January 16, 1990, the defendants asked the district court for sanctions, stating that the plaintiff class had never been properly certified by the court.  On March 6, 1990, the district court (Judge Laffitte) dismissed the defendants' request, holding that the action had been maintained as a class action since class certification was satisfied when the court approved the original stipulated agreement. The court also found that the notice requirement had been satisfied because no class member had complained during the entire 14 years of the litigation. The court stated that the defendants' arguments were frivolous and assessed sanctions of $1,500.00 in attorneys' fees against the counsel for the defendants. The defendants appealed this order. On December 18, 1991, the First Circuit (Judge Levin H. Campbell) affirmed the district court's ruling that the lawsuit could proceed as a class action, but reversed and remanded the district court's ruling that the consent decree would apply to the Guerrero facility. Navarro-Ayala v. Hernandez-Colon, 951 F.2d 1325 (1st Cir. 1991).</p><p>On remand, the district court (Judge Laffitte) ordered the parties to submit briefs on an appropriate remedial action for the defendants' systematic denial of rights under the Mental Health Code. The court also ordered the Special Master to investigate whether the medical directors at Guerrero were implementing the provisions of the Mental Health Code at that time. The defendants appealed both orders. On February 7, 1992, the First Circuit dismissed the appeal, holding that the appellate court had no jurisdiction in the matter since the district court's orders were not final orders. Navarro-Ayala v. Hernandez-Colon, 956 F.2d 348 (1st Cir. 1992).</p><p>The plaintiffs asked the district court to impose sanctions on the Assistant Secretary of Mental Health for violating Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by falsely certifying to the court that patients at the institution could leave the hospital \"at any time they want.\" On July 8, 1991, the district court (Judge Laffitte) granted the plaintiffs' request and issued monetary sanctions in the amount of $20,000.00. Navarro-Ayala v. Hernandez-Colon, 143 F.R.D. 460 (D.P.R. 1991). The defendants appealed.  On July 13, 1992, the First Circuit Court of Appeals (Judge Bruce Marshall Selya) affirmed the district court's decision to impose sanctions, but reduced the amount from $20,000.00 to $6,500.00. Navarro-Ayala v. Nunez, 968 F.2d 1421 (1st Cir. 1992).</p><p>In February 1992, the defendants filed a motion asking the district court to reconsider its reappointment of the Special Master. After considering and rejecting the motion, the district court (Judge Laffitte) decided that Colon had violated Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and sanctioned him $500.00. Colon appealed. On August 20, 1993, the First Circuit reversed the district court's sanctions, holding that they were unwarranted. Navarro-Ayala v. Hernandez-Colon, 3 F.3d 464 (1st Cir. 1993).</p><p>As recounted in the District Court Order from January 10, 2005 (Judge H. Laffitte), the parties, on August 11, 2000, filed a Joint Stipulation and Order of Dismissal, asserting substantial compliance with the Consent Decree. The defendants agreed to maintain the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) accreditation, to maintain a yearly appropriated budge of at least $18,929,000.00, and to adequately provide for the health, welfare, safety and treatment of the patients at RPPH. The Court adopted the joint stipulation and order, and on January 28, 2002. The court dismissed the case and retained jurisdiction to enforce the agreement.</p><p>From June 2003 through August 2004, the Special Master filed five compliance reports that described as untrue the allegations regarding the reduction in budget, the diversion of hospital funds, the closure of the San Patricio Mental Health Center, and the use by a managed behavioral health organization of thirty hospital beds. In 2003, the RPPH confronted a budgetary crisis that, according to the Special Master, was not affected by the failure to assign the stipulated budget or diversion of funds, but rather the assumption that the hospital’s prior court ordered budget would suffice to maintain functioning after the consent decree. The parties met with the Special Master following the fourth report to discuss the 1996 Rehabilitation Plan. While the Special Master insisted that the plan had to be followed, the parties of the action thought that it was not legally, procedurally, or substantively required in light of the accomplishments described in the compliance reports. </p><p>In the fifth report, the Special Master indicated that defendants were not in compliance with the 1996 Rehabilitation Plan by continuing to house patients who obtained the maximum benefit of hospitalization and could be moved out of acute care in the hospital and into rehabilitation services (maximum-benefit patients).</p><p>In response to the fifth and final report in 2004, the plaintiffs acknowledged that the Special Master’s reports did not indicate conditions as severe as when patients filed the original 1974 complaint. While highlighting the presence of maximum benefit patients as concerning, the plaintiffs also noted that the Special Master’s reports sought to establish a new remedial agenda that would extend beyond the hospitals at issue in this case to multiple health care facilities in Puerto Rico. Plaintiffs’ counsel explained that the Special Master’s suggestions seek to “straightjacket the Puerto Rico Department of Health” by controlling budgets, staffing, programming, and administrative structures. Plaintiffs’ counsel made clear to the court that they did not agree to adopt any statements with respect to facilities beyond the scope of the current case. The parties therefore asked the court to close the case without full adherence to the 1996 plan or extra considerations posited by the Special Master.  </p><p>On January 10, 2005, the Court (Judge H. Laffitte) entertained a motion asserting that the RPPH budget was reduced beneath the court-ordered amount and that the pre- and post-hospitalization services were inadequate. The Court determined that RPPH had in fact increased its budget and improved its pre- and post-hospitalization services. Nonetheless, the Court increased the budgetary mandate of $18,929,000.00 to $23,000,000.00 per fiscal year. It also reasserted its prior dismissal of the case, concluding that there was no evidence of further constitutional violations that warrant further judicial involvement in the case. </p><p>On September 26, 2014, a group of mental health patients at RPPH moved to reopen the case, claiming that RPPH had failed to maintain adequate staffing and funding levels, and that the patients feared that important services would be eliminated. The case officially reopened on June 18, 2015. The court appointed monitor Daniel Wathen to compile compliance reports.</p><p>In the first compliance report submitted on September 2, 2016, the monitor declared that until 2014, RPPH was a “model operation” and services were based on the 1996 Rehabilitation Plan. Before 2014, RPPH received support by block grants from the United States Government in addition to payments from patients enrolled in the Government Health Plan. During a budget session in 2014, though, the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration informed RPPH that block grant funds could not be used to supplement mental health treatment services. A privately managed care provider then took over those services and part of the premises, resulting in the elimination of a number of previously offered services including partial hospitalization, pharmacy services, recreational therapy, ambulance services, vocational services, and case management. A change in compensation measures for employees also resulted in shorter visits, less continuity of care, delays in appointment scheduling, and no visits for patients without healthcare accepted by the private care provider. The monitor conceded that the plaintiffs were factually correct in alleging that these changes breached court orders.</p><p>After almost an additional year of litigation, Judge Francisco A. Besosa ordered the Commonwealth on February 22, 2016 to pay plaintiffs’ attorney’s and the monitor’s fees accruing from the time the case reopened. Defendants completed payments on December 2, 2016. Judge Besosa denied a motion to reopen the case on October 17, 2017 and the case remains closed.</p>",

    "summary_short": "On November 25, 1974, patients at the Rio Piedras Psychiatric Hospital (RPPH) in San Juan, Puerto Rico, filed a class action lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. §1983 against the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.  The plaintiffs, represented by Puerto Rico Legal Services and the Civil Action and Education Corporation, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that their constitutional rights had been violated by overcrowding, inadequacies in the physical facilities, lack of security for personal belongings, lack of pillows, poor laundry service, unpleasant odors, insufficient therapeutic treatment, insufficient staffing, inadequate classification standards, and discrimination on the basis of geographical origin. On June 3, 1977, the court issued a consent decree and closed the case. Most recently, the Court ordered that the defendants maintain a budget of at least $23,000,000 per fiscal year. The case reopened on June 18, 2015 after a group of patients alleged that RPPH failed to maintain court ordered requirements. Judge. Francisco A. Besosa ordered the Commonwealth to pay attorney's and monitor's fees and closed the case on October 17, 2017.",

I issued document requests to ASSMCA both \nprior to, during and subsequent to the visit and met with Administrator Carmen Graulau as well \nas employees of ASSMCA presently working at the Rehabilitation Center at the San Patricio \nsite.  I also met with officials of APS who currently operate the mental health clinic at the site \nand submitted document requests to supplement the site visit.  At my request counsel completed \na briefing schedule on relevant legal issues on July 15.  Having reconstructed and examined the \nvoluminous record involved in this litigation and having carefully considered the information I \nhave obtained from the site visit, document requests, and interviews, I am prepared to make the \nfollowing report to the Court and do so with the concurrence of my assistants. It should be noted \nthat  I  supplied  a  draft  of this  report  to  counsel  on  August  15,  2016  and  entertained  and \nconsidered all comments received on or before September 1, 2016. \nGeneral Background. \nBefore November of 2014, ASSMCA operated a Mental Health Center at San Patricio \nthat  provided  a  full  schedule  of mental  health  treatment  services  as  well  as  rehabilitation \nservices.  Funded by payments from patients enrolled under the Government Health-Plan, the \nCenter was also supported by block grants from the United States Government.  The funding \nallowed the Center to employ a large staff of professionals, five to eight psychiatrists, a number \nof psychologists,  together  with  support  staff that  included  social  workers,  case  managers, \noccupational and recreational therapists  and a health educator.  All personnel,  including the \n2 \n{W5662043,l} \n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 718   Filed 09/02/16   Page 3 of 79\nprofessional  staff,  were  paid  on  an hourly  basis.  The  Center attracted  approximately  3,000 \nindividual patients  in  its  last year of operation.  By  all  accounts,  the  Center was  a  model \noperation that provided a full range of services to its patients on site.  Former patients attest that \nthe Center provided a sense of community to its patients and staff and achieved a high degree of \ncontinuity in care.  The more intensive services, such as partial hospitalization, the stabilization \nunit and an emergency room,  were designed to keep patients from being hospitalized or re \nhospitalized unnecessarily.  The Center's services were based on a model set forth in the System \nPlan for Mental Health/Rehabilitation Services (the \"1996 Plan\") accepted and approved by this \nCourt on February 27,  1996 (Docket 402).  In 2014 during a budget session, ASSMCA was \ninformed by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration that block \ngrant funds were to be devoted to rehabilitation and could not be used to supplement the mental \nhealth treatment services that were supported by the Government Health Plan which in tum was \nsupported  by  federal  funding.  ASSMCA  responded  to  this  development  by  dividing  the \npremises and ceding the mental health treatment services and part of the premises to APS, a \nprivate managed care provider.  On the remaining portion of the premises AS SM CA organized \nand continues to  operate a free  standing Rehabilitation Center, now known as  the  San Juan \nRecovery  Center  (the  \"Center\"),  to  provide  a  schedule  of rehabilitation  services.  APS  IS \nsupported  by  the  Government  Health  Plan  and  other  insurance  payments.  The  Center  IS \nsupported by block grant funding for its rehabilitation services and thereby avoids what the U.S. \ngovernment described as double-dipping. \nDespite  the  assurances  offered  by  Administrator  Graulau  in  a  letter  to  the  patients \nannouncing  the  change  in  operations,  the  division  of the  Center  and  the  introduction  of a \nmanaged care delivery model for mental health services on the APS side, did result in a change \n3 \n{W5662043.1} \n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 718   Filed 09/02/16   Page 4 of 79\nin the clinical staff and the elimination of a number of services that were previously offered at \nthe site. The MOU that accompanies the November 2014 lease of a portion of the premises from \nASSMCA to APS  states its objectives are for APS to  assume services previously offered by \nASSMCA  and  for  the  patients  to  go  to  the  same  professionals,  same  place  and  minimize \ninconvenience as  well  as  to  maintain continuity of care.  Moreover,  Administrator Graulau \ninformed the patients that current services would be retained, particularly referencing partial \nhospitalization, intensive ambulatory services, individual and group therapies, medical injectable \nclinic, orientation and education for family members and support groups. Finally, she informed \npatients that APS  had agreed to  \"maintain the clinical staff which currently attends to you.\" \nNotwithstanding  these  assurances,  the  clinical  staff turned  over nearly  completely  and  it is \nconceded and beyond dispute that little by little the following services were eliminated:  partial \nhospitalization,  pharmacy  and  injectable  services,  recreational  therapy,  ambulance  services, \nvocational services, and case management.  Although eliminated, most of these services are now \noffered at other facilities and locations in Puerto Rico.  The services that are now provided by \nAPS, however, are subject to a delivery system in which clinicians are compensated on the basis \nof patient encounters rather than on an hourly basis as AS SM CA had provided in the past.  This \nchange has led to shorter visits, less continuity of care, delays in scheduling appointments, and \nno visits for patients without a health plan accepted by APS.  Although the MOU provides that \nAPS  will  provide  care  and  bill  ASSMCA  for  community  patients,  i.e,  those  without  the \ngovernment health plan or insurance, there is no evidence that APS or ASSMCA is discharging \nthis responsibility. Finally, there is no integration of the rehabilitation services provided by the \nCenter with the mental health services provided by APS.  The two operations are completely \nfreestanding and patients' files and treatment plans are not shared in any meaningful way. \n4 \n{WS662043.l} \n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 718   Filed 09/02/16   Page 5 of 79\nGrupo' s Allegations Regarding Changes in the Service Model \nGrupo alleges that the changes made in the service model by the Government in 2014 \nbreached the orders of this Court by failing to maintain San Patricio Mental Health Center as an \nintegrated operation, staffed by an interdisciplinary team, and providing the same services that \nwere offered in the past.  Factually, Grupo is correct.  The mental health services have been \nprivatized, and, although offered on the same site by APS, are no longer integrated with the \nrehabilitation services qffered by the Center.  The treatment teams, at best, are multidisciplinary \nand do not conform to the interdisciplinary approach contemplated by the 1996 Plan.  Finally, it \nis beyond dispute that some of the services previously offered on site have been eliminated, even \nthough they may be offered at other locations to those who are eligible.  Thus, it is certain that, \nas contended by Grupo, the service model at San Patricio was changed substantially in 2014.  It \nis  clear that the changes have a negative impact on the services  afforded the patients.  For \nexample five to eight psychiatrists served 3,000 patients annually in the past.  Currently, two \nAPS  psychiatrists  serve  approximately  2,000  patients  on  an  annual  basis.  Grupo's  counsel, \nhowever, does not contend that service deficits at San Patricio independently rise to the level of a \nviolation of law or result in a deprivation of constitutional rights  and  no  evidence of such \nviolations was noted during the site visit.  Rather, the sole issue presented is whether the changes \nunilaterally made by the Government at San Patricio in 2014 violate the prior orders of this Court \nwhich  were  designed  to  vindicate  the  constitutional  rights  of patients  at  the  Rio  Piedras \nPsychiatric Hospital. \n5 \n{W5662043.l} \n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 718   Filed 09/02/16   Page 6 of 79\nThe Mandates Established by the Prior Orders of This Court. \nBefore setting forth my interpretation of the relevant portions of the record in this case, I \nmust acknowledge that it is difficult to faithfully and accurately reconstruct the complex history \nof institutional reform litigation extending over a forty-two year span, recorded in more than 865 \ndocket entries, with many of those docket entries consisting of lengthy and detailed documents. \nFor example, the 1996 Plan alone contains more than 300 pages of text and detailed exhibits. \nMoreover, I am mindful of the fact that this Court is in a superior position to determine the \nmeaning and intention of its prior orders.  I offer my interpretation of the prior orders in this \nlitigation in the hope that it may be helpful and perhaps persuasive, even though not conclusive. \nThe  class  action  complaint  in  this  matter  was  filed  in  1974  alleging  constitutional \nviolations on the part of the Government in the care afforded to patients at what was then called \nthe San Juan Psychiatric Hospital, also referred to as the Rio Piedras Psychiatric Hospital (the \n\"Hospital\"). On March 20,  1977, the parties stipulated in writing to forty-one standards to be \nobserved at the Hospital together with a schedule for achieving compliance with those standards. \nThe then Presiding Judge approved the stipulation and judgment was entered by agreement on \nJune  3,  1977.  1  On  February  1,  1985,  after  receiving  motions  for  contempt  alleging \nnoncompliance, this Court denied the motion for contempt but granted plaintiffs' motion for the \nappointment of a Special Master to monitor the consent decree and made the appointment on \nFebruary 8, 1985.  At this point the litigation was focused solely on the operation of the Hospital. \nIn the Special Master's first report to the court entered on August 12, 1985, he documented an \nabject lack of compliance with the consent decree at the Hospital and observed that the Hospital \n1 Prior to September of 1987, docket entries were identified only by date.  Thereafter entries are identified by \nsequential numbering. \n6 \n{W5662043.1} \n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 718   Filed 09/02/16   Page 7 of 79\n\"functions  within  an  integrated  system  of mental  health  services  and  that  its  effectiveness \ndepends on the effectiveness of the other components of the system and on how they coordinate \ntheir functions with those of the Hospital.  Hence plans for reforming the Hospital must be part \nof an integrated plan to reform the entire system of state sponsored mental health services.\" Id at \n7.  In 1987, the Government challenged this Court's jurisdiction to entertain recommendations \nfrom the Special Master pertaining to pre and post hospital services provided at the San Patricio \nMental Health Center.  On August 11, 1987, this court entered an order confirming jurisdiction \nover pre  and post hospital  services  \"directly  related to  the  Hospital's  compliance  with the \nConsent Decree.\"  Id at 6.  On February 22, 1996, this Court entered an order (Docket 402) \n(Exhibit 1) 2 in which it accepted and adopted the plan  presented by the Special Master after \nthirty-four reports and years of work with a steering committee made up of a host of experts and \ninterested  persons.  The  1996  Plan  entitled,  \"Plan  for  a  System  of  Mental  Health \nTreatment/Rehabilitation Services\", set forth in detail, requirements for a complete mental health \nsystem for  Puerto  Rico  including pre  and  post hospital  mental  health  services,  specifically \nreferring to those provided by the Government at the San Patricio Mental Health Center.  It was \nthe  judgment  of  the  Special  Master  that  the  Plan's  implementation  \"should  result  m \ndeinstitutionalization  of  the  Rio  Piedras  Psychiatric  Hospital  and  m  keeping  it \ndeinstitutionalized,\" thus making it \"feasible for  reforms resulting from  compliance with the \nStipulations by the Hospital to become institutionalized.\" (Exhibit 1 at 1)  The Court observed \nthat the Plan, although designed for the entire Commonwealth, had legal force only within the \ncatchment area of the Hospital, namely Northeastern Puerto Rico.  San Patricio was the only \nmental health center within the catchment area providing pre and post hospital services.  In \naccepting the Plan the Court made the following observations: \n2 For the convenience of the Court, I have attached the most relevant orders as exhibits to this report. \n7 \n{W5662043.1} \n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 718   Filed 09/02/16   Page 8 of 79\n\"The need for a plan based on a system-wide approach has been palpable at least since \n1989.  This was underscored at the November 30, 1995 status conference in which the \nCourt was informed that, if anything, the problem of institutionalization has worsened: \none in three of the Hospital's beds was being occupied by MBH patients (patients who \nhad received the maximum benefits of hospitalization).  These MBH patients were being \nretained in the Hospital in violation of Stipulations 3-b and 35-b, the stipulations intended \nto secure their rights to receive treatment in compliance with the principles of continuum \nof care and least restrictive environment.  Under these circumstances only two acceptable \nalternatives were open: one, to impose sanctions for persistent failures of compliance, or, \ntwo, to adopt a plan designed to secure compliance within a reasonable time period and, \nthereafter to assure continuing institutional compliance.\" (Exhibit 1 at 5) \nFour and one half years after the Plan went into effect, following considerable effort and \nactivity on the part of all parties and the Court, a Joint Stipulation of Dismissal was presented by \nthe parties on September 11, 2000.  (Docket 494) (Exhibit 2).  Essentially, the parties asserted \nsubstantial compliance with the Consent Decree, pledged to maintain J.C.A.H.C.O. accreditation \nand agreed to maintain an annual budget of at least 18.9 million for the Hospital.  The Court \nadopted and entered the order. (Exhibit 2 at 7).  As entered, the order of dismissal was without \nprejudice to reinstatement of the action upon certain conditions. Thereafter on August 11, 2000, \nthe Court issued a notice of proposed settlement and an opportunity for class members to object. \n(Docket 495) (Exhibit 3).  No objections having been filed, on January 28, 2002, the Court \napproved the joint stipulation and ordered the case dismissed.  In doing so, it made the following \nobservation:  \"The Court's order of March 9, 2000 (Docket 476) and the Joint Stipulation and \nOrder  of  Dismissal  of August  11,  2000  (Docket  494)  shall  remain  in  effect to  ensure  the \ncontinued constitutional protection of the patients of the RPPH.\" (Docket 503) (Exhibit 4 at 5). \nNoticeably, absent from the order of dismissal and the referenced docket entries of 476 and 494, \nis any order relating to the provision of pre and post hospital services provided at San Patricio. \nDocket number 476 (Exhibit 5) pertains to the application of Medicare funds received by the \nHospital and 494 (Exhibit 2), together with the \"Final Draft of a Proposed Consent Decree\" \n8 \n{W5662043.l} \n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 718   Filed 09/02/16   Page 9 of 79\n(Docket 432) (Exhibit 6) which it approves and accepts, makes no reference to pre and post \nhospital  services.  All  three  docket  entries  relate  solely to  mandated  conditions  within the \nHospital.  Based on these documents, I conclude that the Court never entered an order requiring \nthe continued operation of San Patricio in compliance with the operational standards outlined in \nthe Plan.  In short, there is no order of this Court that expressly requires that San Patricio be \nmaintained as an integrated operation, staffed by an interdisciplinary team, offering the schedule \nof mental health services previously offered and referenced in the Plan. \nPlaintiffs' counsel suggests that when the Court \"accepts and adopts the Plan\" as it did in \nDocket 402 (Exhibit  1) ,  the Court in effect orders compliance with the Plan in every detail \nthroughout the system, at least as it applies to San Patricio.  Moreover, it is argued that, despite a \ndismissal  with  prejudice  based  on  substantial  compliance  (Docket  503)  (Exhibit  4),  the \nprovisions of the Plan relating to San Patricio remain binding on the Commonwealth unless and \nuntil altered by the Court.  The Court did observe in its order of dismissal that it \"found and still \nfinds that pre and post Hospital support systems are  essential to  keep  and maintain the Rio \nPiedras Psychiatric Hospital de-institutionalized and constitutionally healthy.\" (Exhibit 4 at 2) \nCounsel correctly notes that the Presiding Judge who entered the order of dismissal, ordered a \nstatus conference in March of 2003 on the basis of concerns about budgetary support for the \nHospital and \"whether the San Patricio Mental Health Center was to be shut down.\"  (Docket \n508) (Exhibit 7 at 1).  Despite being assured that the San Patricio facilities would not be closed \nor privatized, the  Court expressed concern \"with respect to  compliance by the  San Patricio \nMental Health Center'', id at 2, the Court reappointed the  Special Master to  \"determine the \nveracity of the alleged non-compliance by the Psychiatric Hospital and the San Patricio Mental \nHealth Center\".  Id.  Ultimately, on January 10, 2005 (Docket 604) (Exhibit 7), after receiving \n9 \n{W5662043.l} \n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 718   Filed 09/02/16   Page 10 of 79\nfive extensive reports from the Special Master, the Court declined to reopen the case and ratified \nits prior order of January 28, 2005  (Docket No.  503) (Exhibit 4), incorporating the order of \nMarch 9, 2000 (Docket 476) (Exhibit 5), and the joint stipulation of dismissal of August 11, \n2000 (Docket 494) (Exhibit 2).  It is signifi.cant to note that the Court entered this final order \nover the objection of the Special Master who argued specifically in his fifth and final report that \nthe dismissal ordered by the Court did not displace or revoke the provision of the 1996 Plan \npertaining to pre and post hospital services (Docket 585 at 125-127), and called for the Court to \n\"eliminate all doubt about role of the 1996 plan and should order defendants implement the 1996 \nTreatment/Rehabilitation Plan, as the Compliance Plan in this case, subject to whatever proposed \namendments the Court may see fit to adopt.\" Id at 128.  The Special Master specifically pointed \nout the repercussions to the system that would flow from the \"apparent intention of the Secretary \nto embark on a program which would tum over more than 90% of mental health patients to the \nMBHO APS\".  Id at 121. Notwithstanding the recommendations of the Special Master, although \nthe Court increased the yearly budget mandate for the Hospital, it made no reference to  San \nPatricio  other  than  to  state  that  it  \"expects  the  Commonwealth  defendants  to  . . .  continue \ncomplying with pre and post-Hospitalization continuum.\" (Exhibit 7 at 4). Such an expectation \nfalls far short of the request of the Special Master to adopt the 1996 Plan as the compliance plan \nin this case. The language employed by the Presiding Judge does not, in my judgment, rise to the \nlevel of an enforceable court order prohibiting changes in the service model for San Patricio. \nThe model currently in force is undoubtedly not to the liking of Plaintiffs but it conforms in \nbroad outline to a model in use in many states.  APS reports that its psychiatrists see thirteen \npatients a day on average and its psychologists see fourteen.  Average timeframe for a clinical \nappointment is thirteen days.  In FY 2015, within the population of 2,144 patients, there were \n10 \n{W5662043.l} \n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 718   Filed 09/02/16   Page 11 of 79\nsixty five psychiatric hospital admissions for a 3% hospitalization rate. Service deficiencies at \neither of the clinics currently opeIr ated at San Patricio, if any,  could be addressed in separate \nnegotiations or litigation.  I would note for example that the services being provided at the San \nJuan Recovery Center during my visit were rather sparse and poorly attended.  Notwithstanding \nthe concerns about service deficiencies,  I do  not interpret the Court's language in Exhibit 7 \nretaining jurisdiction \"to ensure the continued constitutional protection of the patients at the \nRPPH\" as being broad enough to encompass the Plaintiffs'  claims to enforce the 1996 Plan as \nthe compliance plan for San Patricio in this present litigation, unrelated to any allegation or proof \nof a  direct  relationship  to  the  Hospital's  current  compliance  with  the  Consent  Decree. \nAccordingly, I would recommend that the case be dismissed. \nIn the event that the Court comes to a different conclusion regarding the import of the \nprior orders as they relate to San Patricio, I am prepared, with guidance from my assistants, to \nrecommend how the combined facility could be restructured to comply with the provisions of the \n1996 Plan. \nRespectfully submitted this 2nd day of September, 2016. \ns/Daniel E.

No. 401) recommending that the Court accept and adopt the \"Plan for a System \nof Mental  Health  Treatment/Rehabilitation  Services\"  (\"Plan  Para  Un  Sistema  de \nTratamiento/Rehabilitaci6n para Salud Mental\"} (\"The Plan\"}.  In the Special Master's \njudgment the Plan's implementation \"should result in deinstitutionalization of the Rfo \nPiedras  Psychiatric Hospital  and  in  keeping  it deinstitutionalized,\"  thus making  it \n\"feasible  for the  reforms  resulting  from  compliance  with  the  Stipulations by the \nHospital to become institutionalized.\"  The Court now reviews the Plan. \nOn examining the Plan the Court notes at the outset that it is the product of \ntripartite  consensus.  In  compliance  with  the  August  23,  1994,  Order  and  the \ninstructions given by the Court in the November 30, 1995, Status Conference, and \nfollowing 16 months of meetings and discussions, consensus has emerged on how \nbest to develop a system of mental health treatment and rehabilitation services that \ncomply with the Stipulations. \n!Exhibit 1] \n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 718   Filed 09/02/16   Page 13 of 79\n_ _ \n, \n1-\n1 \n2 \nThe  feasibility  of the  Plan  is  attested  by  the  signatures  of the  principal \nrepresentatives of the government, who are committed to its implementation, the Hon. \nManuel Diaz Saldana, Secretary of the Treasury, in his capacity as the Governor's \npersonal representative; the Hon. Carmen Feliciano de Melecio, Secretary of Health; \nthe Hon. Astrid Oyola Benftez,  Administrator of ASSMCA, in her dual capacity as \nAdministrator and Compliance Officer; and by defendant's counsel. On the other side, \nthe Plan  is  endorsed by plaintiffs'  Counsel  and  his principal  consultant.  Further \nsupport for the Plan is reflected in the signatures of the Deputy Master and of the \nmembers of the Court's AIT {Advisory Interdisciplinary Team).1  Noteworthy, too, is \nthe list of key professionals from the Hospital and ASSMCA who participated directly \nin developing the Plan. \nThe Court genuinely commends the efforts that went into reaching tripartite \nconsensus.  The  Plan  proposes  a  comprehensive  system  of  treatment  and \nrehabilitation  services  that  will  enable  the  Hospital  to  fully  comply  with  the \nrequirements of the Stipulations. \nBecause of the Plan's scope, and its manifold details and commitments, the \nCourt is obliged to fully review the Plan.  What follows are the elements of the Plan \ndeemed  most  significant for  reaching  the  goal  of securing  compliance  with the \nStipulations.  Because the Plan consists of 160 pages plus budgetary data, in seven \nsections,  and  is  accompanied  by  15  supporting  exhibits,  only  the  most salient \nelements of the Plan will be addressed in this opinion. \n11rma Moreira is the only AIT member who did not work on the Plan. \nAO 72A \n(Rev. 8/82) \n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 718   Filed 09/02/16   Page 14 of 79\n,·-\n3 \nSection I of the Plan \nThe  Plan's  steering  committee,  tripartite  in  its  membership,  under  the \nleadership of AIT member Dr.  Cynthia Rodriguez Pares, executed the terms of the \nCourt's August 23,  1994 Order which adopted the recommendation in the Special \nMaster's Thirty-Second Report.  He had recommended that AIT's working plan \"be \nimplemented in accordance with its terms\".  The representatives of the Hospital, \nASSMCA's  community  and  post-hospital  mental  health  services,  consisting  of \nprofessionals at different levels of authority, will be responsible for executing the \npolicies and practices incorporated in the Plan. \nASSMCA's administrator Astrid Oyola participated in the steering committee's \nmeetings and in the final stages of negotiation.  Following the November 30, 1995, \nstatus conference, she played a decisive role in reaching consensus on what became \nthe Plan's fifth and final draft. \nAs evidence of their commitment to implement the Plan, the Secretaries of the \nTreasury  and  Health joined  ASSMCA's Administrator in  their January  10,  1996, \npetition-letter to the Dir~ctor of Management and  Budget, requesting an additional \nappropriation  of eight  million  dollars  to  cover  the  cost  of the  Plan's  first  year. \nAdequate budget~ry support is essential to ensuring the Plan's viability.  The Special \nMaster also wrote to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget in support \nof defendants' petition and related his support to the goal of securing compliance with \nthe  Stipulations.  The  question  of  adequate  budgetary  support  for  the  Plan  is \nconsidered below. \nA072A \n(Rev. 8/82) \n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 718   Filed 09/02/16   Page 15 of 79\nr-\n4 \nIn developing the Plan, the parties went beyond the scope of the terms of the \nAugust 23,  1994 Order,  but they  maintained  the goal  of deinstitutionalizing the \nHospital.  That goal, the Steering Committee concluded, requires establishment of a \nsystem of mental health treatment and rehabilitation services, including the Hospital \nand its pre and post supporting services, a goal required by constitutional principles \nas reflected in the stipulations. \nThough the Plan encompasses all of Puerto Rico, it should be pellucidly clear \nthat there is no legal commitment to provide services outside northeastern Puerto \nRico, the catchment area served by the Hospital as defined by the jurisdictional limits \nof the present case.  Indeed, the only commitment, in terms of time, is limited to what \nis to be accomplished during the first year of implementation.  After the first year of \nimplementation, and after any modifications that may be considered appropriate, it \nmay serve as the model for an  island-wide system of treatment and rehabilitation \nservices. \nWhether the island-wide potential of the Plan is realized at some time in the \nfuture is, of course, entirely for the Commonwealth government, not the Court, to \ndecide.  What is significant is that a plan to which all parties have consented has been \nsubmitted to the Court based on a tripartite process.  The implementation of the Plan \nmay serve as the basis for a finding that compliance with the stipulations has been \nsecured. \nThe full significance of what has been achieved through tripartite process can \nbest  be  appreciated  by  rereading  the  history  of  the  unresolved  problem  of \nAO 72A \n(Rev. 8/82) \n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 718   Filed 09/02/16   Page 16 of 79\ni-· \n5 \ndeinstitutionalization as summarized in the Special Master's Thirtieth Report, submitted \nDecember 22, 1993.  See pages 15-25;  the Special Master's Thirty-Second Report, \nJuly  6,  1994  (recommending  adoption  of  AIT's  proposed  tripartite  method  for \nresolving the problem of deinsti~utionalization, which the Court adopted, and which \nhas resulted in the present Plan). \nThe need for a plan based on a system-wide approach has been palpable at \nleast since 1989. This was underscored at the November 30, 1995 status conference \nin which the Court was informed that, if anything, the problem of institutionalization \nhas worsened:  one in three of the Hospital's beds was being occupied by MBH \npatients (patients who had received the maximum benefits of hospitalization).  These \nMBH patients were being retained in the Hospital in violation of Stipulations 3-b and \n35-b,  the  stipulations  intended  to  secure  their  rights  to  receive  treatment  in \n, \ncompliance with the principles of continuum of care and least restrictive environment. \nUnder these circumstances only two acceptable alternatives were open:  one, to \nimpose sanctions for  persistent failures  of compliance,  or,  two, to  adopt a plan \ndesigned to secure compliance within a reasonable time period and, thereafter, to \nassure continuing institutional compliance. \nThe Court turns now to consider whether the submitted Plan  is  capable of \nachieving its stated goals. \nIt appears that the Plan's principles, guidelines, premises and objectives are \ninternally consistent.  The guiding conceptual thread is the definition of rehabilitation: \nit is to be an  integral component of mental health services at the community pre-\nA072A \n(Rev. 8/82) \n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 718   Filed 09/02/16   Page 17 of 79\nr-\n6 \nhospital stage, during the patient's treatment stage in the Hospital, and in every post-\nhospital facility.  Both in the Hospital and in the pre- and post-hospital facilities, the \napproach is to be interdisciplinary.  The expectation is that in all service components, \npatients will spend less time in the Hospital, as initial patients or recividists, and that \nthe  proposed  system  of treatment/rehabilitation  will  maximize  the  possibility  of \nmentally ill persons achieving their maximum potential for normal autonomous lives. \nA number of the Plan's objectives are appropriately and specifically directed \ntoward compliance with the Stipulations in this case.  Specifically, the Plan seeks to \nreduce  substantially  the  institutionalization  of  Mental  Health  patients-clients;  to \nproceed  with  implementation  following  the  principles  of  from  greater  to  lesser \nrestriction for the patient in accordance with the rigorous evaluation of his condition; \nand to comply with the Stipulations in the case of Navarro Ayala v. Governor of Puerto \nThe \"Premises to Implement the Plan\" read as follows: \n1.  The population which recurs to and receives the services required \nin this plan of treatment/rehabilitation can expect that these (a) \nwill  be  individualized  (in  accordance  with  identified  needs,  (b) \nofferred  by  duly  qualified  mental  health  professionals  and  in \nadequate number, (c) in continuing progress toward habilitation/ \nrehabilitation in the least restrictive environment and (d) based on \nobservations/information  documented  and  specified  in  a  plan \n(which includes the discharge). \n2.  In contrast to the population which existed at the origin of this \ncase,  the present one is  much  younger,  with higher levels  of \neducation, with  more of a psychiatric diagnosis (Axes I and II) \n2 These and other materials quoted from the Plan are translations by the Court \nfrom the Spanish original. \nAO 72A \n(Rev. 8/82) \n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 718   Filed 09/02/16   Page 18 of 79\n7 \nand at risk of social function (Axes IV)  in clear deterioration or \nmoving toward a chronic condition. \n3.  This plan  emphasizes that the treatment/rehabilitation  process \nrequires, at a minimum, the active participation of a close support \ngroup (family, tutor, someone in charge) in each and every of the \nunits of direct services. \n4.  In this plan there is established a series of units of direct service. \nEach  service  specifies  its  justification  (goal),  criteria  of \nadmission/discharge and its staffing pattern, among others. \n5.  The administration and professional staff of each unit of direct \nservice  will  assure  that there  are  identified  and  implemented \nstandards of service with respect to:  ( 1) the care/treatment/ \nrehabilitation of the patient,  (2)  the security of patients, \nfamily members, students and working personnel and (3) \nmaintenance of a P.hysical and working environment that is \ntherapeutic and humane. \n6.  The different components of this plan are subject to significant \nmodifications if the results  of the monitoring  and  evaluations, \nwhether internal or external, should so justify. \n7.  It is recognized that the administrative decisions related to \nstructure  and  process  to  be  implemented  in  order  to \nguarantee compliance with the agreements established in \nthis  Plan  of  Treatment/Rehabilitation  are  within  the \ncompetence of ASSMCA. \n8.  This plan is designed as a system to serve as the paradigm for \nproviding mental health integrated services in the participating \ninstitutions.  The provisions in this plan are directed to orient the \nprofessionals  in  the  mental  health  services  provided  by  the \ngovernment with  respect to  the  norms  of service  which  it is \nintended to  offer to persons  who require  such  service and  to \nfacilitate compliance with the stipulations in the case of Navarro \nAyala. \nThe  section on premises concludes that the Plan  is not intended to create \nindividual rights which can serve as the basis for an individual cause of action alleging \nnoncompliance with the provisions of the Plan. The Court agrees with this conclusion. \nAO 72A \n(Rev. 8/82) \n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 718   Filed 09/02/16   Page 19 of 79\n8 \nThis of course in no way affects the obligation to effectuate the Plan's institutional \nreforms. \nSection II of the Plan \nOf its more than 1 60 pages, one hundred are dedicated to defining the structure \nand  system  of  mental  health ·treatment and  rehabilitation  services  provided  by \nASSMCA and to the coordination ASSMCA must develop  with other government \nagencies such as Police, Education and Social Services.  The system of services is \npresented not as it is presently functioning, but rather how it will function in order to \nsatisfy the Plan's requirements. \nIn the case of the Community Mental Health Centers, for example, the range of \nservices are to include emergency services, screening and evaluation, ambulatory \ntreatment, day care, partial hospitalizations, advice and rehabilitation assistance and \ncommunity education.  Once these services are fully provided, it should have a direct \nimpact on the Hospital's capacity to comply with the Stipulations.  These effects \nshould be felt once the projected plan is implemented to transform the San Patricio \nExternal Clinic into a Mental Health Center because San Patricio is the principal source \nof patients referred to the Hospital. \nAs in the case of the Mental Health Centers, the services to be provided by the \nHospital are defined in terms of what the Hospital is to become.  The continuum of \ncare to be provided includes PIC (Psychiatric Intervention Center), PICU (Psychiatric \nIntensive  Care  Unit),  Acute  and  Subacute  Wards,  and  Day  Hospital-Inn,  which \nprovides a resocialization and  pre-vocational program.  To meet the needs of the \nAO 72A \n(Rev. 8/82) \n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 718   Filed 09/02/16   Page 20 of 79\nI .. \n9 \npersistently aggressive patient, a specialized ward is planned. In addition, the Hospital \nwill continue to provide a small infirmary for non-mental illnesses. \nThe Plan will appreciably strengthen existing services and provide additional \nneeded services.  Especially notable is the prescription for establishing separated but \ncoordinated units for screening incoming potential patients (CCEP, the new acronym \nfor PIC) and the promised intensive care unit (PICU).  PICU should enhance compliance \nwith the Stipulation's standard of least restrictive environment, as those who benefit \nfrom its program will only spend up to twelve treatment days in the Hospital.  The \nprogram for persistently aggressive patients is also a welcome innovation. \nIn  addition to providing for services to assure the involvement of patients' \nfamilies,  the Plan describes the different levels of treatment/rehabilitation and the \ndifferent areas of service.  The programs of the Psychosocial Centers, the network of \npost hospital residences, and the rehabilitation services of the mental health centers, \nshould  reduce  the  need  for  hospitalization  and  should  appreciably  shorten \nhospitalization stays. \nTo deal with the persistent unresolved problems of particular MBH patients the \nPlan  proposes  \"Residential  Facilities  for  Patients,  with  Persistent  Symptoms  of \nProlonged Institutionalization\".  The \"Casita\" is to be the first of those facilities and \nshould serve as the pilot project for filling out the network of post-hospital facilities \nneeded to keep the Hospital permanently deinstitutionalized. \nAO 72A \n(Rev. 8/82) \n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 718   Filed 09/02/16   Page 21 of 79\n\\ ..  ·- . \n10 \nSection Ill of the Plan:  Recruitment and Training of Personnel \nThis section consists of general principles and recommendations on the need \nto  recruit,  retain  and  continuously train  the  specialized  professionals  needed  to \nimplement the  Plan.  The  implementation  of its  general  recommendations  is  the \nASSMCA's responsibility. \nSection IV of the Plan:  System of Evaluation \nThe Plan recognizes the need to establish systematic structures and procedures \nto evaluate its performance.  The Plan proposes three evaluation instruments:  the \nmonitoring of programs, quality control and the evaluation of results. \nThe Plan requires two types of monitoring: internal and external.  The internal \nwould be the responsibility of the Plan's \"Implementor/Monitor,\" a high ranking official \nreporting directly to ASSMCA's Administrator.  How well this official executes his or \nher functions will be one of the decisive factors determining the success of the Plan. \nThe second monitoring will be undertaken by AIT after the close of the first year's \nimplementation.  The  AIT will  report to the Court on the  Plan's implementation. \nFollowing the first year's report, the Court will determine whether additional reports \nare necessary. \nSection V of the Plan \nThis section  of the Plan  provides that implementation is to be  achieved  in \nstages.  The Plan does not explicitly specify any action beyond its first year.  Phase \nI of the Plan calls for actions to be taken by ASSMCA, development of the necessary \ninfrastructure, preparation of manuals for each unit of service, recruitment of essential \nAO 72A \n(Rev. 8/82) \n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 718   Filed 09/02/16   Page 22 of 79\nll \npersonnel,  evaluation  and  reconditioning  of  physical  plant,  and  acquisition  of \nequipment and  maintenance.  Phase  II  provides  for orientation  at every  level  of \nadministration and service of the Plan's provisions, formation of the interdisciplinary \nteams, and design of the instruments for monitoring and determining quality.  In Phase \n111  the Plan is to be implemented in the Hospital, the newly formed  Mental Health \nCenter in San Patricio, the program of residences and the psychosocial centers.  Phase \nIll also provides for a monitoring of the implementation and a determination of whether \nquality assurance has been achieved.  The final stage, Phase IV, is devoted to an \nevaluation of results. \nEach  activity at each  stage is assigned to ASSMCA officials, the  Hospital, \nparticular service units or to AIT.  The entire process is included in a flow chart which \ndepicts who is responsible for what activities.  The time frames and action required \nto implement the four service units directly related to the Hospital's compliance efforts \nare also described.  These four units are the program of post- hospital residences, the \n\"Casita\" for patients with persistent systems or prolonged institutionalization, the San \nPatricio Mental Health Center, and the Psychosocial Centers.3 \n3  Exhibit 15 describes the services to be provided by the San Patricio facility. \nDeputy Special Master, attorney Rita Rodriguez Falciani, AIT member Carmen Col6n, \nand Dr. Marfa Roman of the Hospital's psychiatric faculty developed the \"Casita\" post \nhospital facility.  The tripartite report on conditions in the Psychosocial Centers, and \nrecommendations  for  remedial  action  was  chaired  by  AIT  member  Ora.  Nectar \nTorregrosa, while the study on ·the Program of Residences was undertaken by AIT \nmember Dr. Cynthia Rodriguez Pares, at the request of ASSMCA's Administrator Mrs. \nAstrid Oyola.  In gathering the data for the latter report, Dr. Rodriguez was assisted \nby seven social workers. \nA072A \n(Rev. 8/82) \n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 718   Filed 09/02/16   Page 23 of 79\n12 \nSection VI of the Plan \nThis section sets out the staffing patterns for each unit of direct service.  For \nthe Hospital, this section specifies the composition of the professional staff, the daily \nhourly  schedule,  the  maximum  lengths  of stay  in  each  stage  of treatment,  the \nguidelines for  interrelations between  service  units,  and  the  maximum number of \npatients to be treated in each unit. The proposed staffing patterns nave a connection \nwith the stipulations.  The December 8, 1988, Order eliminated stipulation 40-b, the \nagreed on staffing patterns in 1 977, and ordered defendants to form a task force for \nthe purpose of submitting revised staffing patterns in keeping with changes in the \nHospital. Defendants have yet to form this task force. The parties in their negotiations \non possible modifications of the 1 977 stipulations should consider stipulating that the \nPlan's staffing pattern should also become modified stipulation 40-b. \nThe detailed provisions in Section VI on staffing, maximum stays, maximum \noccupancy and hourly service periods include two categories:  provisions which have \nbeen successfully used in the past and newly formulated requirements which have yet \nto be tested.  The success of this provision will be determined through the evaluation \nsystem set forth in Section IV. \nVII. Budget \nThe Court does not have before it sufficient information on the question of \nwhether there will be a budget for fiscal year 1996-97 adequate to implement the \nPlan.  A budget proposal prepared July 20, 1995 by Mrs. Sixta Concepcion, Director \nof the Area of Rehabilitation Services, was revised August 9, 1995 by Mr. Juan M. \nAO 72A \n(Rev. 8/82) \n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 718   Filed 09/02/16   Page 24 of 79\n13 \nOrtiz  Jackson,  ASSMCA's  Director  of the  Budget  Division.  The  July  20,  1995 \nproposal is a budget of 7. 7 million dollars.  The August 9, 1 995 revision has no total. \nAdditionally, a petition-letter, dated January 10, 1996, to the Director of Management \nand Budget, the Secretaries of the Treasury and Health, together with ASSMCA's \nAdministrator, requested eight million dollars to implement the Plan, in addition to the \nHospital's proposed budget of 14.2 million dollars.  The letter-petition was endorsed \nby the Special Master in his January 26, 1996 letter to OMB's Director transmitted \nthrough the Secretary of the Treasury. \nTo form a judgment on the adequacy of the Plan's budget the Court must know \nwhether the Governor's budget submitted to the Legislature on Februar·y 8,  1996, \nincludes sufficient funds to implement the Plan  or whether a special appropriation \nmeasure is being considered to assure implementation.  More precisely, the Court \nmust be provided with assurance that the budget will provide the funds required by \nSection  V  on  \"Implementation by Stages\"  and  Section  VI  on  \"Staffing  Pattern.\" \nWithout such resources the Plan's promise of contributing substantially to resolving \nthis case becomes entirely illusory and chimeric.  The present budgetary confusion \nmust be clarified.  On the assumption that the necessary budgetary support will be \nprovided, the Court is convinced that the Plan is viable. \nORDER \nHaving  carefully  reviewed  the  \"Plan  for  a  System  of  Mental  Health \nTreatment/Rehabilitation  Services\"  and  having  considered  the  Special  Master's \nA072A \n(Rev. 8/82) \n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 718   Filed 09/02/16   Page 25 of 79\n1-\n1 \n14 \nrecommendation, the Court accepts and adopts the Plan,  subject to the following \nconditions: \n1 .  The Special Master is instructed to establish a monitoring system to keep \nthe Court informed on the progress being made to implement the Plan. \n2.  The Special Master's monitoring reports will be submitted to the Court \nevery 90 days. \n3.  The Special Master will submit the AIT's evaluation of the Plan's first. \nyear of implementation within 60 days following the last trimester report. \n4.  Within 30 days defendants will file with the Court a detailed statement \nof the budget for fiscal year 1996-97 to implement the Plan.  Thereafter, the Special \nMaster will report to the Court on the question of the Plan's adequate funding. \nIn closing, the Court reiterates its praise to the parties for the efforts they have \ntaken in order to develop the Plan through a tripartite process.  If the parties can \nmaintain this effort throughout the implementation of the Plan, this lengthy case \nshould finally be resolved. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nSan Juan, Puerto Rico, February dl_, 1996. \nAO 72A \n(Rev. 8/82) \n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 718   Filed 09/02/16   Page 26 of 79\n. \n._..,.  ---: \n::r:n. \nlh \nRF__ C, __l, \\I' F ~I  -)I,_,  . \nn.,J n- 11111..1. .. 1-~1   11  r'11~ ,.'I.   e·'  r, ..: '~J.  \nIN THE  ,· . -· - . \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  U.:3.·  i°  j /i·i:;:~:i. :_;;;'.:'--RT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO  '.3 /: :~ JI .I/, ; i. r;.

The complaint rightfully asserted that the federally protected constitutional rights of \nthe patients were being violated by overcrowding, inadequate care, and harsh conditions at \n.,-....  RPPH. \n,·~ \nOn April 20, 1977 this Court approved a stipulated consent decree which included \neighty-six standards that the parties consented to observe at the Hospital.  Between 1977 \nand 1984 this case remained in a semidonnant state with little or no activity.  In February \n1985 the Court appointed Dr. David M. Helfeld, former Dean of the University of Puerto \nRico Law School, as a Special Master. The C~~D: directed the Special Master to ensure \nthat the parties comply with the 1977 stipulation agreement and to file periodic reports to \nthe Court.  Taking his commission to heart, the Special Master filed with the Court forty \nvoluminous and thorough reports reCOIIlJP0~ndi:hg improvements and reforms at the RPPH, \nas well as other facilities. \nThe 1974 complaint named as defendants: Rafael Hernandez Colon, then Governor \nof Puerto Rico; Jose Alvarez de Choudens, then Secretary of Health; Eric Santos, then the \nD~rector of the Hospital; and Concepcion Perez, then Administrator of the Hospital.  The \nvarious changes of administration in Puerto RiGo led the Court to change the title of the \ncase to Navarro Ayala v. Governor o'f:pti·~~o::!Zico,'sin:ce this litigation is brought against \n.. \"·.1,: \n:  _, .. \n41 \n!Exhibit \n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 718   Filed 09/02/16   Page 38 of 79\noil \nCivil No. 74-1301 (HL)  2 \ndefendants not in their personal capacities but in their official capacity. Santiago v. \nCornoraci6n de Renovaci6n Urbana y Vivienda de P.R., 554 F.2d 1210, 1213 (151 Cir. \n1977) (holding that a successor in office is automatically substituted under F.R.Civ.P. \n25(d )).  Thereafter, a series of contested and litigated issues followed. There were periods \nof progression and regression, many resulting from the changes in the administration, \ndelays in appointment of administrators, substitution of counsel, and in many occasions, \nwhat appeared to be idiosyncratic attitudes. \nIn 1993, the Governor attended a meeting at this Court to discuss the status of the \ncase with the undersigned Judge, the Special Master, and counsel.  Subsequently, the \nGovernor designated Manuel Diaz Saldana, then Secretary of the Treasury, to see to it that \nthe reforms tl1.lt .. had to be fulfilled were carried out within the shortest period possible. \nThereafter, Secretary Diaz Saldana gave his undivided attention to this case, cooperating \nfully with the Court and the Special Master's recommendations to achieve compliance with \nthe stipulations and the Court's orders. \nII.  Progress and Compliance \nDuring the long and tortuous path of this institutional litigation to vindicate \nplaintiffs' constitutional rights as patients at RPPH, the Court was compeUe(J to assess \nmonetary fines in the amount of $95,000.00 to achieve compliance with the Court's order \nand stipulations. \nthe \nOn June 18, 1997, following a formal hearing where  Governor, then Secretary of \nHealth Carmen Feliciano, the Special Master, and counsel appeared and addressed the \nCourt, the Court entered an order finding that it was satisfied that compliance priorities \nwere recognized by all to be overcrowding, de-institutionalization, physical plan \nremodeling, the need for a compJi@ce plan, and the development of an adequate pre-and-\n,.,  --:=·.  ···-\npost-H~p-~tal support system (the \"Rehabilitation plan\").  The Court found, and still finds, \n[ ---·  ·-·--··-·--- . -··-·- --·····- . \nthat pre-and-post~Hospital support systems are essential to keep and maintain the Rio \nPiedras Psychiatric Hospital de-institutionalized and constitutionally healthy.  The 37lh and \n\\_ _ \n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 718   Filed 09/02/16   Page 39 of 79\nCivil No. 74-1301 (HL)  3 \n40Lh Special Master's reports recognized that defe~dants had made tremendous progress in \ncomplying with the 1977 stipulations; that the much-needed reforms have been \ninstitutionalized; and that substantial compliance with the stipulations embodied in the \nConsent Decree have been accomplished.  In consideration of the progress accomplished, \nthe Court ordered that the $95,000 in fiDcs be returned to the Secretary of the Treasury. \nThe funds were ordered eannarked for the. specific purpose of promoting and enhancing \nthe therapeutic environment at the RPPH for the benefit of the patients and their families. \nPursuant to the Court's order recreational facilities, structures, illumination, signs, and \nsubscriptions for a reading room were provided to the patients. \nIII.  Accreditations \nIn January and March 1999 RI1PH received accreditations by the Joint Commission \ni-· \n.for the Accreditation of Health Care Organizations (J.C.A.H.C.O.) and by Medicare, \nrespectively.  Whereupon the Court entered oil'March 9, 2000, the following order: \nAU monies received by or credited to the Puerto Rico Department \nof Health, the Mental Health and Anti-Addiction Services \nAdministration, or the Dr. Ramon Fernandez Marina Psychiatric \nHospital (\"Hospital\") fr.om l\\1edicare or any private entities in \npayment or reimbursement for medical or psychiatric services \nrendered at the Hospital shall be allocated by the Government .of \n.Puerto Rico to the Hospital's opera;tional account(s) and used ~.s \noperating funds.  Until further ord~rs of the Court, such monies · \nshall not be used by the Department of Health, the Mental Health \nand Anti-Addiction Services Administration, the Hospital, or any \nother Puerto Rico governmental agency or instrumentality for any \npu.rpose other than as  specified herein.  (Docket no. 476. ) \nOn August 11, 2000, the parties filed a Joint Stipulation and Order of Dismissal \nasserting substantial compliance with the Consent Decree, pledging to maintain the \nJ.C.A.H.C.O. accreditation, and agreeing to maintain a yearly appropriated budget of at \nleast $18,929,000.00 to adequately provide for the health, welfare, safety and treatment of \nthe patients at the RPPH.  The parties further stipulated that defendants shall continue to \nhold meetings of the Implementation C..1mmittee and of the Hospital Governing Board, the \n?:  , \n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 718   Filed 09/02/16   Page 40 of 79\nCivil No. 74-1301 (HL)  4 \nlatter as  successor to th~ Steering Committee.  The Court adopted and entered the order. \nDocket no. 49.4. \nIn January 2001 a new administration took office in Puerto Rico.  The Court held in \nabeyance any rulings on the joint stipulation so that the new administration could \nfamiliarize itself with this institutional litigation and demonstrate its willingness and \nconunitment to the constitutional rights of the RPPH's patients.  Dr. Johnny Rullan, the \npresent Secretary of Health, promptly showed his commitment to, and good faith in, \ncomplying with the stipulations and the Court's order.  Dr. Rullan sought and obtained a \nJ.  meeting with the Court on March 28, 2001 fo discuss the status of the case.  Thereafter, Dr. \nRullan an his staff have seen to it that the Hospital continues to comply with the Consent \nDecree and the Court's order, including holding meetings of the Governing Board, the \nImplementation Committee, and notifying the Court with copies of the minutes. \nFinally, on December 13, 2001 the undersigned Judge attended a special meeting of \nthe Governing Board, and thereafter inspected the facilities accompanied by counsel and  . \n1 \nthe former Special Master.  The Court is now ready to rule upon the joint motion to finali2.->=_ \nthis lengthy and at times :frustrating litigation.  The efforts, energy, and time devoted to \nvindicate the patients' constitutional rights at the RPPH have not been in vain. \nThe Court would be remiss if it did not acknowledge the Special Master, Dr. David \nHelfeld, the Deputy Special Master, Rita Rodriguez Falciani, the Advisory \n.! \nInterdisciplinary Team, Manuel Diaz Saldana, and then-Secretary of Health Carmen \nI \nFeliciano for their accomplishments in bringing the conditions at the RPPH to \nconstitutional standards.  This group dedicated their time and efforts over the past years to \nimprove the life of the mentally ill at the RPPH.  Together they have accomplished a \nnoteworthy feat.  Special recognition goes to Dr. Helfeld.  Transforming the Hospital into \na modern institution for the mentally iii h~~f riot\" merely been a job but a passionate personal \nl \ngoal.  On behalf of the Court, the parties, and, most importantly, the patients in the \n..  I  Hospital who suffered under what were medieval living conditions before this case began, \n.l \nI  the Court thanks Dr. David Helfeld for his work.  The Court of Appeals as early as \n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 718   Filed 09/02/16   Page 41 of 79\nD-{ \n..- ---.__  Civil No. 74-1301 (HL)  5 \nDecember 18, 1991 noted the progress made in this institutional reform litigation and \nrecognized that \"the district judge and the court-appointed master have done an outstanding \njob performing the role of policy planners and managers to see that the complex legal goals \ninherently part of this litigation come about ....\" Navarro-Ayala vs. Hernandez Colon, \n951F.2d1325, 1346(l51Cir.1991). \nThe Court also acknowledges the dedication and leadership of Secretary of Health \nJohnny Rullan and his staff in assuring compliance V.:ith the stipulatiQn.§_~~:rrt's \norders, and his pledge to continue the incredible transformation of the Rio Piedras \n-\n~ \nPsychiatric Hospital from its medieval state to a well organized, well respected accredited \ninstitution which carefully treats and respects the constitutional rights of its patients. \nConclusion \nThe reward and satisfaction for providing a less restricted envirorunent, adequate \ntreatment, a therapeutical environment for mental patients - a vulnerable class - at RPPH \nis priceless.  A sense of fairness and respect for human dignity require no less.  Because \nthere no longer appears to be overcrowding, understaffing, poor living conditions or \ninadequate care and treatment of patients at the Rio Piedras Psychiatric Hospital as the \ncomplaint originally asserted, and given the stipulation for dismissal filed by the parties, \nthe Court hereby approves the joint stipulation and hereby orders this case dismissed.\\l.yhe \nCourt's order of March 9, 2000 (docket no. 476) and the Joint Stipulation and Order of  t' \nDismissal of August 11, 2000 (docket no. 494) shall remain in effect to ensure the  ~ \ncontinued constitutional protection of the patients of the RPPH.

Brief History of the Case: \nIn  1974,  Roberto  Navarro  Ayala,  a  mentally retarded  patient  at the  Rio  Piedras \nPsychiatric Ward Hospital (RPPH), filed a civil rights class action in this Court. The complaint \nrightfully asserted that the federally protected constitutional rights of the patients were being \nviolated by overcrowding, inadequate care, and harsh conditions at RPPH.  In April of 1997, \nthe Court approved a stipulated consent decree which included eighty-six standards that the \nparties consented to  observe at the Hospital.  Thereafter, in February of 1985, the Court \nappointed Dr. David M. Helfeld, former Dean of the University of Puerto Rico Law School, \nas a Special Master, in order to  ensure the parties compliance with the  1977 stipulation \nagreement, and to provide the Court with reports on the Hospital's progress.  Slowly but \n7j \n!Exhibit \n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 718   Filed 09/02/16   Page 75 of 79\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB  Document 604  Filed 01/10/05  Page 2 of 6 \n2 \nsurely, the Hospital made tremendous improvements throughout the long and tortuous path of \nthis institutional reform litigation. For example, on June 18, 1997, the Court entered a an order \nfinding that significant progress had been achieved at RPPH.  In March of 1999, RPPH \nreceived  accreditations  by  the  Joint  Commission  for  the  Accreditation  of Health  Care \nOrganization (J.C.A.H.C.O.) and by Medicare, respectively. Thereafter, on August 11, 2000, \nthe parties filed a Joint Stipulation and Order of Dismissal, which the Court adopted, asserting \nsubstantial compliance with the  Consent Decree, pledging to  maintain the J.C.A.H.C.O. \naccreditation, and agreeing to maintain a yearly appropriated budge of at least $18,929,000.00, \nto adequately provide for the health, welfare, safety and treatment of the patients at RPPH. \n(See Docket No. 494). Finally, on January 28, 2002, the Court dismissed the case and issued \nan order providing, in relevant part, that its \"order of March 9, 2000 (docket no. 476) and the \njoint Stipulation and Order of Dismissal of August 11, 2000 (docket no. 494) shall remain in \neffect to ensure the continued constitutional protection of the patients of the RPPH.\" (See \nDocket No. 503.) \nII. The 2003-04 investigation: \nIn March of 2003, the Court received communications from various sources alleging \nviolations of the Court's January 28, 2002 order, specifically that: (1) the budget for the Rio \nPiedras Hospital for the forthcoming fiscal year had been reduced from the $18,929,000.00 \nrequired by the Court's order; (2) that during the present and past fiscal years funds budgeted \nfor the Hospital were transferred to cover costs not related to the Hospital's operations; and \n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 718   Filed 09/02/16   Page 76 of 79\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB  Document 604  Filed 01/10/05  Page 3 of 6 \n3 \n(3) that the decision to close down the San Patricio Mental Health Clinic was in violation of \nthe Court's findings that the existence of pre and post Hospital support systems were essential \nto ensure and safeguard the RPPH's patient's constitutional rights. After conducting a status \nconference with the parties, the Court reappointed Dr. Helfeld on April 29, 2003, as Special \nMaster, to conduct an investigation relative to the allegations of non-compliance by the RPPH. \n(See Docket No. 508). Contrary to the parties' assumptions, the Court did not reopen the case, \nbut rather utilized  its  inherent  powers to  appoint the  Special  Master to  investigate  the \nallegations and report his findings to the Court. Thereafter, the Court conducted numerous \nstatus  conferences  with  the  parties  and  received  a  total  of five  (5)  voluminous  and \ncomprehensive reports by Dr. Helfeld detailing certain deteriorating conditions at the RPPH. \nDefendants, in turn, responded to Dr. Helfeld's reports, detailing the administrative and fiscal \nmeasures that the Hospital had implemented in its efforts to address the Court's concerns as \nto the deteriorating conditions at the Hospital.  The plaintiff class also had an opportunity to \nfile  a reply to the Special Master's Fifth and Final Report. (See Docket No. 594).  Dr. \nHelfeld 's mastership expired on August 30, 2004. \nThe Court has reviewed Dr. Helfeld's reports and the responses of all the parties, and \nconcludes that at this time the RPPH is in substantial compliance with the consent decree and \nthe January 28, 2002 order.  First, it appears from the information contained in the Special \nMaster's Second Report, and the motions filed by the Commonwealth defendants, that the \nbudget for the RPPH was not reduced from the $18, 929,000.00 required by the Court's order \n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 718   Filed 09/02/16   Page 77 of 79\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB  Document 604  Filed 01/10/05  Page 4 of 6 \n4 \nof January 28,  2002, but was increased to  $21,429,000.00.  In addition, the information \npresented to the Court shows that the Commonwealth defendants have no intention to close \ndown the San Patricio Mental Care Health Center, and that the funds budgeted for the Hospital \nhad not been diverted to cover any costs other than those related to the Hospital's operations. \nIn addition,  the Court finds  that the  Commonwealth defendants  have  taken  a  series  of \nadministrative  and  fiscal  measures  to  address  the  RPPH's pre and post-Hospitalization \nservices.  The RPPH is also in the process of ensuring its compliance with the requirements \nfor the upcoming J.C.A.H.C.O. accreditation scheduled in March of 2005. \nPlaintiffs have requested that the Court \"close\" this case.  Since the case has not been \n\"reopened,\" the Court takes plaintiffs' motion as a request to cease further federal judicial \nintervention in this matter, given that the RPPH's current conditions are  consonant with \nconstitutional mandates.  (See Plaintiffs' Response to the Special Master's Fifth and Final \nReport, Docket No. 594 ).  The Court is satisfied that the Commonwealth defendants are \ncognizant of the importance of safeguarding the constitutional rights of the patients at the \nRPPH. The Court expects the Commonwealth defendants to comply with all the requirements \nnecessary to ensure the Hospital's renewed accreditation this upcoming March, and continue \ncomplying with pre and post-Hospitalization continuum.  In an effort to ensure the Hospital's \ncontinued  compliance  with  the  consent  decree,  the  Court hereby increases it previous \n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 718   Filed 09/02/16   Page 78 of 79\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB  Document 604  Filed 01/10/05  Page 5 of 6 \n5 \nbudgetary mandate of$18, 929,000.00 to $23,000,000.00 per fiscal year.1 \nIn summary, the Court hereby ratifies its prior order of January 28, 2002 (Docket No. \n503), incorporating the order of March 9, 2000 (Docket No. 4 76),  and the joint stipulation of \ndismissal of August 11, 2000  (Docket No. 494 ).  Whereupon, the Court hereby ORDERS \nthat: \n(1) All monies received by or credited to the Puerto Rico Department of Health \nand  Anti-Addiction  Services  Administration  or  its  successor,  or  the  monies \nreceived  by  RPPH  from  Medicare  or  any  private  entities  in  payment  or \nreimbursement for medical or psychiatric services rendered at the Hospital shall \nbe allocated by the Government of Puerto Rico  to  the Hospital's operational \naccount(s) and used as operating funds.  Until further order of the Court, such \nmonies shall not be used by the Department of Health, the Mental Health and \nAnti-Addiction Services Administration, the Hospital, or any other Puerto Rico \ngovernmental agency or instrumentality for any purpose other than as specified \nherein; and (2) that in accordance with the joint stipulation, the Commonwealth \npledges to maintain theJ.C.A.H.C.O. accreditation, and shall henceforth maintain \na yearly appropriated budget of at least $23,000,000.00 to adequately provide for \nthe health, welfare, safety and treatment of the patients at the RPPH. \nIn conclusion, the Court finds that there is currently no evidence of constitutional \nviolations at the RPPH  that would warrant further federal judicial involvement in this case. \nAs the First Circuit Court of Appeals has recently stated in another institutional reform \nlitigation case in this District, the court's oversight of the RPPH \"cannot-and should not-last \n1 It is a fact that the Commonwealth defendants had already afforded more funds to \nRPPH's yearly budget as a response to the institution's new financial reality \n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 718   Filed 09/02/16   Page 79 of 79\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB  Document 604  Filed 01/10/05  Page 6 of 6 \n6 \nforever.\"  See e.g., Morales Feliciano v.

NUNEZ, Defendant, Appellant.\nNo. 91-2084.\nUnited States Court of Appeals, First Circuit.\nHeard May 4, 1992.\nDecided July 13, 1992.\n11442223 *1422*1423 Alice Net Carlo, with whom Garcia Rodon, Correa Marquez & Valderas, Hato Rey, P.R., was on\nbrief, for appellant.\nCarlos Garcia Gutierrez, with whom Luis M. Villaronga, San Juan, P.R., Armando Cardona Acaba, and Puerto\nRico Legal Services, Inc., Bayamon, P.R., were on brief, for appellees.\nBefore SELYA, Circuit Judge, COFFIN and CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judges.\nSELYA, Circuit Judge.\nToday marks the third time within the past two years that we have had occasion to visit the garden where this\nhardy perennial of a case continues to bloom. The appeal at hand involves the district court's imposition of a\n$20,000 sanction against defendant-appellant Jose A. Nunez, the Assistant Secretary of Mental Health of the\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that, although the court acted\nappropriately in levying a sanction, the amount of the sanction should be reduced.\nI\nThis litigation started in 1974 when a class action was brought on behalf of patients at the Rio Piedras Psychiatric\nHospital (Hospital), a government-operated facility. The defendants were officials of the Commonwealth. In 1977,\nthe parties executed a settlement stipulation. The district court approved it. Since that time, the Hospital has\nremained subject to the district court's oversight. A Special Master, appointed under the aegis of Fed.R.Civ.P. 53,\n[1]\nhas assisted the district judge for several years.\nII\nThe instant appeal has its genesis in the Special Master's fifteenth report, submitted to the district court on\nDecember 4, 1990. The report focused on the extent of the Commonwealth's progress toward\ndeinstitutionalization of the Hospital's patient population. It mentioned that, as part of the deinstitutionalization\neffort, some patients had been transferred to the Guerrero Therapeutic Community (GTC), a mental health facility\n1424 providing care and *1424 therapy for sub-acute cases.[2] The report then noted that certain court-ordered\ndeadlines would have to be extended because of the time required to \"deinstitutionalize the plaintiffs-patients\nconfined to [the GTC].\"\nOn December 21, 1990, the defendants submitted their objections to Report No. 15. In that pleading, appellant\ntook issue with the portion of the report that spoke of patients being \"confined to\" the GTC. The objection, which\nDr. Nunez signed under oath, stated in pertinent part:\nPatients residents of Guerrero are not confined. Confine means 00 \"restrain within limits; to restrain\n97\nwithin limits; imprison.\" Webster's New International Dictionary 2nd Ed. Unabridged. These\npatients can go back to where they come from, a family 00 at any time they want. The problem is\n97\n\nthat in the majority of the cases, the family does not want the patient to return or the patient\ncannot go back to the family because it is the source of the mental problem and/or triggers a\ndecompensation. These patients have no other alternative just to reside there or go to one of the\nfacilities of the rehabilitation division of the Mental Health Department if it is accepted by the\nresident.\nThis assertion seemed quite plainly to say that inmates were free to leave the GTC at any time they chose. So\nread, it ran counter to a fundamental premise on which the district court's handling of the case had been\npredicated. Noting the conflict, the district court instructed the Special Master \"to investigate the truth of the\nmatter\" and to \"verify whether Hospital patients transferred to [GTC] have been `confined' there ... or whether\nthey have been free to leave at any time.\"\nTo carry out the court's mandate, the Special Master enlisted the aid of his Advisory Interdisciplinary Team (AIT).\nHe also held a hearing at which Dr. Nunez testified. The Special Master's seventeenth report incorporated the\nAIT's comments on the question of confinement. In direct response to the district court's inquiry, the Special\nMaster wrote: \"In light of the investigative record, only one conclusion is possible: there was no factual basis for\nthe Assistant Secretary's December 21, 1990 statement to the court.\"\nThe appellant took exception to this finding, but presented no additional evidence to rebut it. The district court\nratified the finding. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 53(e)(2) (in non-jury actions, the district court \"shall accept the master's\nfindings of fact unless clearly erroneous\"). In so doing, the judge wrote:\nOn the basis of the unrefuted record the Assistant Secretary for Mental Health had no factual\nbasis for his statement to the Court.... The record also demonstrates, irrefutably, that the Assistant\nSecretary did not make \"reasonable inquiry\" before submitting his statement to the Court, that as\nSecretary for Mental Health he was in a position to gather accurate information, but failed to do\nso.... Nor did defendants' ... comments and exceptions to [Report No. 17] present an acceptable\njustification for the failure of the Assistant Secretary to make reasonable inquiry prior to submitting\na sworn statement which subsequent investigation demonstrated to be untrue and misleading.\nAt the same time, the judge ordered Dr. Nunez to \"show cause why he should not be sanctioned for violation of\n[3]\nRule 11 of the Rules of Civil Procedure.\"\n1425 *1425 A show-cause hearing was held on June 17, 1991. After receiving testimony and documentary evidence,\nthe court took the matter under advisement. On July 8, 1991, 1991 WL 353359, the court filed an opinion\nconcluding that appellant violated Rule 11 by submitting a sworn pleading which to his knowledge \"was not well\ngrounded in fact.\" The court imposed a monetary sanction in the sum of $20,000, to be paid personally by Dr.\nNunez. This appeal followed.\nIII\nWe consider, first, the principles controlling appellate review in cases of this stripe. We then proceed to determine\nwhether any sanction was warranted.\nA.\nIt is apodictic that a district court's decision to impose Rule 11 sanctions is reviewable under an abuse-of-\ndiscretion rubric. See Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 2457-61, 110 L.Ed.2d 359\n(1990); Maine Audubon Soc'y v. Purslow, 907 F.2d 265, 267 (1st Cir.1990). Because the decision about whether\na litigant's (or lawyer's) actions merit the imposition of sanctions is heavily dependent upon the district court's\nfirst-hand knowledge of the case and its nuances, appellate review is deferential. See Maine Audubon, 907 F.2d\nat 267-68; Anderson v. Beatrice Foods Co., 900 F.2d 388, 393-94 (1st Cir.),cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 111 S.Ct.\n233, 112 L.Ed.2d 193 (1990). Thus, a party protesting an order in respect to sanctions bears a formidable burden\n\nin attempting to convince the court of appeals that the district judge erred in finding that Rule 11 was, or was not,\nviolated. Maine Audubon, 907 F.2d at 268.\nRule 11 applies foursquare to represented parties. Business Guides, Inc. v. Chromatic Communications Enterps.,\nInc., ___ U.S. ___, 111 S.Ct. 922, 931, 112 L.Ed.2d 1140 (1991). Prior to signing a pleading, a litigant must fulfill\nthe \"affirmative duty to conduct a reasonable inquiry into the facts and the law.\" Id.,111 S.Ct. at 933. Whether or\nnot this duty has been breached depends on the objective reasonableness of the litigant's conduct under the\ntotality of the circumstances. See id.; see also Lancellotti v. Fay, 909 F.2d 15, 18-19 (1st Cir.1990).\nTo determine whether a litigant made a reasonable inquiry into the facts, the district court should examine all the\ncircumstances, including the complexity of the subject matter, the party's familiarity with it, the time available for\ninquiry, and the ease (or difficulty) of access to the requisite information. See Brown v. Federation of State\nMedical Bds., 830 F.2d 1429, 1435 (7th Cir.1987); Century Prods., Inc. v. Sutter, 837 F.2d 247, 250-51 (6th\nCir.1988); Thomas v. Capital Sec. Servs., Inc., 836 F.2d 866, 875 (5th Cir.1988) (en banc); see also Fed.R.Civ.P.\n11, Advisory Committee's Notes, 97 F.R.D. 198, 199 (1983). Litigants, like counsel, are to be held \"to standards\nof due diligence and objective reasonableness 00 not perfect research or utter prescience.\" Maine Audubon, 907\n97\nF.2d at 268. Furthermore, for Rule 11 purposes, a party's pleading must be judged on the basis of what was\nreasonable when the pleading was filed rather than in hindsight. See Cruz v. Savage, 896 F.2d 626, 631 (1st\nCir.1990); Davis v. Crush, 862 F.2d 84, 88 (6th Cir.1988).\nB.\nIn this instance, the district court's finding that appellant slighted his duty of reasonable inquiry is sufficiently\nsupported by the record. The statements contained in the challenged pleading were demonstrably incorrect. For\nexample, the court below pointed out that those patients who had been involuntarily committed to the GTC 00 and\n97\nthere were many 00 were most assuredly not free to depart \"at any time they want.\" The court also observed that,\n97\n1426 even *1426 as to voluntarily committed patients, there was a severe shortage of rehabilitation facilities, with the\nresult that such patients, once cleared to leave, often remained confined to the GTC for years 00 a circumstance\n97\nthat, as a practical matter, negated what appellant had characterized as a viable alternative. The court\nsupportably found that the truth underlying these, and other, discrepancies was easily ascertainable by a person\nin appellant's position. Indeed, at the show-cause hearing, appellant admitted that patients could not simply leave\non demand; that he knew as much when he signed the pleading; that the quoted portion of the objection was \"not\nthe complete truth\"; and that, therefore, he signed it with unexpressed \"reservations.\"\nWe will not paint the lily. The duty of reasonable inquiry perforce requires that the signer of a pleading act upon\nthe knowledge he acquires. After all, courts cannot function if lawyers and litigants are not forthright. Given the\nappellant's admission that he knew the truth, but nevertheless signed and swore to an answer that he had reason\n[4]\nto believe was both incorrect and misleading, no more was required to warrant the imposition of sanctions.\nIV\nAlthough the lower court did not err in finding a violation of Rule 11, our journey continues. The rule provides that\nthe sanction actually imposed must be \"appropriate.\" See Fed.R.Civ.P. 11. We turn, then, to that inquiry.\nA.\nThe primary responsibility for choosing an appropriate sanction rests with the district court. See Lancellotti, 909\nF.2d at 20 (\"It is ... for nisi prius to decide what sanction is `appropriate' anent a particular violation [of Rule 11].\");\nAnderson, 900 F.2d at 394 (\"The trial judge is best positioned to decide what sanction best fits a particular case\nor best responds to a particular episode or pattern of errant conduct.\"). When the district court settles upon a\nmonetary sanction and fixes a dollar amount, a reviewing tribunal should defer, within broad limits, to the district\ncourt's exercise of its informed discretion. Nevertheless, the court of appeals must be careful not merely to\n\"rubber-stamp the decisions of the district court.\" Velazquez-Rivera v. Sea-Land Serv., Inc., 920 F.2d 1072, 1075\n\n(1st Cir.1990) (discussing standard of review for choice of sanctions under Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(f)). Appellate review\nof the appropriateness of a sanction cannot be allowed to deteriorate into a perfunctory ritual.\nThe imposition of a Rule 11 sanction usually serves two main purposes: deterrence and compensation. See \nAnderson, 900 F.2d at 394 (collecting cases); Brown, 830 F.2d at 1437-38; see also Cooter & Gell, 110 S.Ct. at\n2454 (\"the central purpose of Rule 11 is to deter baseless filings\"). Encompassed within these objectives are\nseveral related subsidiary goals, e.g., punishing litigation abuse and facilitating case management. See White v.\nGeneral Motors Corp., 908 F.2d 675, 683 (10th Cir.1990) (citing American Bar Ass'n, Standards and Guidelines\nfor Practice Under Rule 11 (1988)).\n1427 The power to impose sanctions is a potent weapon and should, therefore, be *1427 deployed in a balanced\nmanner. For that reason, proportionality is often a proxy for appropriateness. See Anderson, 900 F.2d at 395 (in\nfashioning a sanction, it is important that \"the punishment should be reasonably suited to the crime\"); Brown, 830\nF.2d at 1439 (similar). That is to say, the trial judge must \"take pains [not] to use an elephant gun to slay a\nmouse.\" Anderson, 900 F.2d at 395.\nB.\nWith due respect for the district court's considerable discretion, we find the imposition of a $20,000 fine in this\n[5]\ncase to be grossly disproportionate and, therefore, inappropriate. We explain briefly.\nDr. Nunez, a civil servant, had no personal stake in the litigation and did not stand to gain from the Rule 11\nviolation. He now stands to lose, having been ordered to pay the impost from his own pocket. We do not fault the\ncourt below for this aspect of its order: when a public official or corporate officer violates Rule 11 in the course of\nperforming agentival duties, it is permissible 00 and frequently wise 00 from the standpoint of deterrence to direct\n97 97\nthat the offender pay a monetary sanction personally. Nevertheless, a monetary sanction aimed at deterrence is\nappropriate only when the amount of the sanction falls within the minimum range reasonably required to deter the\nabusive behavior. See In re Kunstler, 914 F.2d 505, 523 (4th Cir.1990),cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 111 S.Ct.\n1607, 113 L.Ed.2d 669 (1991); White, 908 F.2d at 684-85; Doering v. Union County Bd. of Chosen Freeholders,\n857 F.2d 191, 194 (3d Cir.1988). Having in mind appellant's status, there is no reason to believe that payment of\na sum considerably smaller than $20,000 would not be a fully effective deterrent.\nIn terms of compensation, the record is equally fuliginous. Although the district court made a fleeting reference to\nthe fact that appellant's \"no confinement\" claim \"precipitated a court-ordered investigation at considerable cost ...\nto determine the truth of [appellant's] assertions,\" the court never quantified the cost. For our part, we cannot tell,\neither from the court's rescript or from any other part of the record on appeal, the approximate quantum of\nexpense fairly attributable to the misstatements. We do know, however, that the misstatements, albeit\ndemonstrably inaccurate, were easily provable as such.\nWhen a sanction is designed to be compensatory, it should not compensate the opposing party, or even a court-\nappointed master, for any and all costs and expenses incurred in response to the sanctionable conduct. Rather,\ncompensation, as such, should be awarded only for the fair value of response costs reasonably incurred. See \nThomas, 836 F.2d at 879 (distinguishing between \"reasonable\" expenses and \"actual\" expenses in Rule 11\ncontext); INVST Fin. Group, Inc. v. Chem-Nuclear Sys., Inc., 815 F.2d 391, 404 (6th Cir.) (same), cert. denied,\n484 U.S. 927, 108 S.Ct. 291, 98 L.Ed.2d 251 (1987); cf. United States v. Metropolitan Dist. Comm'n, 847 F.2d 12,\n17 (1st Cir.1988) (in fee-shifting context, \"the law firm's bill need not be swallowed whole by the client's litigation\nadversary just because it is the law firm's bill\"). In the present situation, we cannot conceive how the expense\ninvolved in laying bare so transparent a set of misstatements should have been more than a fraction of the\nsanction actually levied. If the plaintiffs or the Special Master, in the name of thoroughness, inadvertently resorted\n1428 *1428 to overkill, that miscalculation should not increase the appellant's burden.\nNor can we discern any other reason sufficient to justify so large a sanction. The violation deserved punishment,\nbut the sting of the lash could have been communicated emphatically through a more modest penalty. The \"no\nconfinement\" claim involved one small piece of a gargantuan case and was not seriously disruptive of the court's\nongoing efforts to achieve institutional reform. Appellant's conduct was not found by the court below to involve\n\nmalice or bad faith. When called to task, appellant was both candid and remorseful. And, he had some excuse\n(albeit an insufficient one) for his actions. See supra note 4.\nWe conclude, on the record as a whole, that the sanction, whether viewed as a vehicle for deterrence, for\nrecompense, or for the accomplishment of any other permissible purpose, was inappropriate in amount.\nV\nWe are left, then, with the question of remedy. Under ordinary circumstances, we would vacate the award and\nremand to the trial court to fashion a more appropriate sanction. See, e.g., Lancellotti, 909 F.2d at 20. But, we are\nnot necessarily constrained to follow such a course. See, e.g., Coats v. Pierre, 890 F.2d 728, 734 (5th Cir.1989)\n(reducing excessive Rule 11 monetary sanction), cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 111 S.Ct. 70, 112 L.Ed.2d 44 (1990)\n; Cheek v. Doe, 828 F.2d 395, 398 (7th Cir.) (per curiam) (similar), cert. denied,484 U.S. 955, 108 S.Ct. 349, 98\nL.Ed.2d 374 (1987). This litigation has been pending for nearly two decades. The record on appeal is reasonably\ncomplete. Too much time has already been spent on Dr. Nunez's regrettable linguistic lapse. We think that this\nmay properly be classified as one of the rare cases in which an appellate court ought to take the bull by the horns\n[6]\nand, rather than remanding, simply select an appropriate sanction. See, e.g., Eastway Constr. Corp. v. City of\nNew York, 821 F.2d 121, 124 (2d Cir.) (listing other representative cases), cert. denied,484 U.S. 918, 108 S.Ct.\n269, 98 L.Ed.2d 226 (1987); see generally 9 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil § 2577\nat 699-700 (1971) (the court of appeals may decide an appeal without remanding for further findings if it feels that\nit is in a position to do so). Believing, as we do, that an amount of $6,500 stands at the outer periphery of\npermissible sanctions in this case, we affirm the finding of a Rule 11 violation but reduce the amount of the\nsanction from $20,000 to $6,500.\nAffirmed as modified. No costs.\n[1] The contours of this litigation have been painstakingly sculpted in connection with the earlier appeals. We see\nno benefit to repastinating well-ploughed ground, opting instead to refer the reader who may thirst for exegetic\ndetail to the opinions in those cases. See Navarro-Ayala v. Hernandez-Colon, 956 F.2d 348 (1st Cir.1992); \nNavarro-Ayala v. Hernandez-Colon, 951 F.2d 1325 (1st Cir.1991).\n[2] The interface between the GTC and the Hospital is described at some length in our earliest opinion, Navarro-\nAyala v. Hernandez-Colon, 951 F.2d 1325 (1st Cir.1991).\n[3] The rule provides in pertinent part: \nEvery pleading, motion, and other paper of a party represented by an attorney shall be signed by at least one\nattorney of record in the attorney's individual name, whose address shall be stated.... The signature of an\nattorney or party constitutes a certificate by the signer that the signer has read the pleading, motion, or other\npaper; that to the best of the signer's knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry it is well\ngrounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or\nreversal of existing law, and that it is not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause\nunnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.... If a pleading, motion, or other paper is signed\nin violation of this rule, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, shall impose upon the person who signed\nit, a represented party, or both, an appropriate sanction....\nFed.R.Civ.P. 11.\n[4] To be sure, Dr. Nunez testified that he called his attorney's attention to his concerns about the pleading, but\nthat they assured him it should be filed. Rule 11, however, places the obligation of reasonable inquiry squarely\nupon the signer of the disputed pleading. Business Guides, 111 S.Ct. at 928-31. \"The essence of Rule 11 is that\nsigning ... denotes merit. A signature sends a message to the district court that this document is to be taken\nseriously.\" Id. at 930. The resultant obligation cannot be delegated. Thus, while consultation with counsel may\nconstitute an important step toward fulfilling the duty of reasonable inquiry, a represented party who signs a\npleading cannot automatically hide behind an advice-of-counsel defense when the chickens come home to roost. \n\nSee id. at 931. In this case, the signer knew that the disputed statement was incorrect and misleading; thus, no\namount of outside advice can excuse his signing and swearing to it (although, as discussed in Part IV, infra, the\nfact that the signer relied on advice of counsel is a factor to be considered in determining what sanction may be\nappropriate).\n[5] We begin this explication at somewhat of a loss. The district court never made clear the basis for the $20,000\nfigure. By the same token, the court did not specify which goal predominated in its mind. We encourage the\ndistrict courts to make specific findings of this sort in Rule 11 cases in order to help us better understand why a\nparticular sanction has been deemed appropriate in respect to a particular instance of misconduct. See, e.g., \nFigueroa-Ruiz v. Alegria, 905 F.2d 545, 549 (1st Cir.1990) (holding that the district court should give an\nexplanation of its sanction order \"when the reason for the decision is not obvious or apparent from the record\"); \nBrown, 830 F.2d at 1438 (in cases involving substantial monetary sanctions, the judge should \"state with some\nspecificity ... the manner in which the sanction was computed\").\n[6] We have occasionally taken the same approach in fee-shifting cases where the sole remaining issue is how\nmuch should be awarded to the fee-seeker. See, e.g., Jacobs v. Mancuso, 825 F.2d 559, 562-64 (1st Cir.1987)\n(abjuring remand and fixing amount of the fees to be awarded for work at district court level); Rogers v. Okin, 821\nF.2d 22, 31 (1st Cir.1987) (similar); Grendel's Den, Inc. v. Larkin, 749 F.2d 945, 951 (1st Cir.1984) (similar).\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Villaronga, San Juan, P.R., were on brief, for plaintiffs, appellees.\n[*]\nBefore CAMPBELL and TORRUELLA, Circuit Judges, and POLLAK,  Senior District Judge.\nLEVIN H. CAMPBELL, Circuit Judge.\nThis is the second appeal arising out of the district court's oversight of a 1977 settlement stipulation between\nofficials of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and a class of mental patients at the Rio Piedras Psychiatric\nHospital in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The lengthy history of this case was summarized in our opinion in the first\nappeal, see Roberto Navarro-Ayala, et al. v. Rafael Hernandez Colon, et al., 951 F.2d 1325 (1st Cir.1991) (\n\"Navarro I\"), and we discuss here only the facts necessary to our disposition of the present appeal.\nThe lawsuit that initiated these proceedings was brought on behalf of residents of the Rio Piedras Psychiatric\nHospital (\"Rio Piedras\"). Some years after entry of the stipulation, a Master was appointed. Two years later,\nmeasures were begun to reduce the patient population at Rio Piedras. Various persons who had been or would\nhave been assigned to Rio Piedras were placed in other facilities in Puerto Rico, including the Guerrero\nTherapeutic Community (\"Guerrero\") in Aquadilla. On January 9, 1991, the district court ordered, inter alia, that\nthe Master investigate whether patients formerly at Rio Piedras and now at Guerrero had been \"`confined' there\n[i.e., at the latter institution] during the past three years.\" The Commonwealth's Assistant Secretary for Mental\nHealth was directed to provide the Master with information necessary to evaluate \"rehabilitation programs serving\npatients transferred from [Rio Piedras].\"\nOn April 19, 1991, the Master filed his seventeenth report with the district court. That report found that patients at\nGuerrero were in fact \"confined.\" The report went on to conclude that Guerrero patients were not being provided\nwith treatment consistent with the provisions of Puerto Rico's Mental Health Code, P.R.Laws Ann., tit. 24, § 4001,\net seq, and that such failure violated the patients' constitutional right \"not to be denied, without due process, the\nstatutory protections and procedures guaranteed by [the Mental Health Code].\"\nHaving received the Master's report, the court issued an order on May 23, 1991. The order stated that \"the\nconclusions and recommendations of the Special Master's Seventeenth Report in all respects are accepted and\nadopted by the court\" and ordered the following:\n350 1) that the parties submit briefs on \"appropriate remedial action for defendants' *350 systematic\ndenial of the rights\" under the Mental Health Code of former Rio Piedras patients transferred to\nGuerrero;\n\n2) that the \"Master investigate whether defendants are complying with the liberty and treatment\nentitlements mandated by [the Mental Health Code]\" with respect to patients then being treated at\nRio Piedras.\n3) that the \"Master investigate to determine whether the Medical Directors of [Guerrero] and [Rio\nPiedras] are in fact presently implementing the provisions in [the Mental Health Code]\" concerning\nthe procedures for admitting voluntary patients.\nDefendants appeal both from the foregoing orders applying at Guerrero and from those applying at Rio Piedras.\nTheir appeal was argued on December 3, 1991, shortly before we issued our opinion in Navarro I. Now that that\nopinion has issued, it is obvious that the challenged orders, at least insofar as they apply to Guerrero, need, as a\npractical matter, to be reconsidered in light of Navarro I. In that case, we ruled that \"[a]n ongoing oversight of the\n... treatment received by former Rio Piedras patients at Guerrero is outside both the terms of the stipulation and\nany general remedial power that can be implied therefrom.\" Id. at 1347.\nFor reasons set forth below, however, we conclude that all of the orders being challenged in this appeal, including\nthose pertaining to Guerrero, are ones over which this court lacks appellate jurisdiction. To be sure, in different\ncircumstances, we might possibly find authority to review the Guerrero orders within our extraordinary mandamus\npowers. But Navarro I had not come down when these orders were issued, and we are altogether confident that\nthe district court will hereafter act in full conformity to our opinion in Navarro I. We thus see no occasion to\nconsider the possibility of mandamus review.\nWe next consider whether or not we have appellate jurisdiction over the orders from which this appeal was taken.\nAs we find no such jurisdiction, we dismiss the appeal.\nThe question of appellate jurisdiction is most easily analyzed if we consider the separate requirements of the\ndistrict court's orders. First, the district court has required the parties to brief the question of remedies for alleged\nconstitutional violations at Guerrero. Several circuits have held that an order to submit a remedial plan following a\nfinding of unlawful conduct is not a final appealable order under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. See Balla v. Idaho State Board\nof Corrections, 869 F.2d 461 (9th Cir.1989) (citing cases). Here, the defendants were subjected merely to the\nlesser requirement of filing a brief. While, as already indicated, Navarro I may well make the briefing order\nrelative to Guerrero obsolete, we do not think a mere briefing order issued at a time the court believed it had\nauthority in respect to Guerrero, is appealable.\nNor is that portion of the orders appealable either as an injunction under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1) or as a collateral\norder under the doctrine of Cohen v. Beneficial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949).\nEven if we assume the dubious proposition that an order to brief an issue could be considered an injunction, for\nan injunction to be immediately appealable it must have a \"serious, perhaps irreparable consequence.\" Carson v.\nAmerican Brands, 450 U.S. 79, 84, 101 S.Ct. 993, 996-97, 67 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981). Similarly, to be appealable\nunder the collateral order doctrine, an order must involve a \"right incapable of vindication on appeal from final\njudgment.\" United States v. Sorren, 605 F.2d 1211 (1st Cir.1979). Neither of these conditions exists here.\nDefendants suffer no irreparable consequence from submitting a brief to the district court, and their right to\nchallenge the court's finding of constitutional violations could be effectively vindicated at such time as a remedy\n[1]\nwere ordered.\n351 *351 We turn next to the portion of the district court's orders requiring various investigations by the Master. The\nMaster has been ordered to determine whether Rio Piedras patients are being deprived of their \"liberty and\ntreatment entitlements\" under the Mental Health Code of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and whether both\nGuerrero and Rio Piedras patients are being admitted under the procedures provided therein. We fail to see how\nan order that the Master conduct an investigation may be considered final. The district court has not yet even\nconsidered, much less made up its mind about, the violations of the Mental Health Code being investigated. See \nCinerama, Inc. v. Sweet Music, S.A., 482 F.2d 66, 70 (2d Cir.1973) (final judgment rule avoids appellate\nconsideration of \"issue[s] concerning which the trial court has not yet made up its mind\"). That the district court\nhas not even considered the existence of such violations likewise precludes the appeal of its orders under the\ncollateral order doctrine. See Sorren, 605 F.2d at 1213 (collateral issue must have been resolved). Finally, these\n\norders may not be appealed as injunctions. Their only effect on defendants is that the Master's investigation will\npresumably require defendants' to provide information. It is doubtful that an order requiring the provision of\ninformation constitutes an injunction. Cf. Corporacion Insular de Seguros v. Garcia, 876 F.2d 254, 256 (1st\nCir.1989) (discovery order not appealable as injunction). Even if it does, defendants will not suffer any\n\"irreparable consequence,\" Carson, 450 U.S. at 84, 101 S.Ct. at 996, from providing information to the Master.\nAnd, of course, given the recent issuance of Navarro I, we may expect, as a practical matter, that the district court\nwill now make such modifications in its orders as that opinion appears to call for.\nThe appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.\nSo ordered. No costs.\n[*] Of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation.\n[1] It is, of course, doubtful that such a remedy will ever be ordered in light of Navarro I, but, by the same token,\nthe parties are now at liberty to approach the district court for relief from the briefing order in light of Navarro I.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\nROBERTO NAVARRO-AYALA, et al.,\nPlaintiffs,\nv. Civil No. 74-1301 (FAB)\nGOVERNOR OF PUERTO RICO, et al.,\nDefendants.\nOPINION AND ORDER\nBESOSA, District Judge.\nIn 1974, Roberto Navarro-Ayala (“Navarro”), represented by his\nmother, filed this civil rights suit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983\non  behalf  of  himself  and  other  patients  of  the  Rio  Piedras\nPsychiatric Hospital (“RPPH”) claiming that the conditions and care\nprovided by RPPH were insufficient in violation of the patients’\nrights pursuant to the United States Constitution.  (Docket Nos. 0\nat pp. 2-3; 594 at p. 3.)  Defendants are the governor of Puerto\nRico, the secretary and assistant secretary of the Puerto Rico\nDepartment of Health, the director of RPPH, and their successors\n(collectively “the Commonwealth”).  (Docket  No. 0 at p. 2.)\nOn June 8, 2015, the Court appointed attorney Judith Berkan to\nrepresent the San Patricio Community Support Group (in Spanish,\nGrupo  de  Apoyo  Comunitario  San  Patricio)  (“Grupo”),1  (Docket\n1 The Court originally indicated that attorney Berkan was appointed\nto  represent  the  San  Patricio  Community  Mental  Health  Center\n(“SPMHC”), but later clarified the party name.  (Docket No. 689.)\n\nCivil No. 74-1301 (FAB) 2\nNo.  630),  and  ordered  the  Commonwealth  to  pay  her  interim\nattorney’s fees for work performed on behalf of Grupo, a prevailing\nparty, (Docket No. 673).  Before the Court is defendants’ motion\nfor reconsideration of the Court’s order approving attorney’s fees,\n(Docket No. 678), which Grupo opposes, (Docket No. 680).  For the\nfollowing  reasons,  defendants’  motion  for  reconsideration  is\nDENIED.\nProcedural History\nNavarro filed suit on November 25, 1974.  (Docket No. 0 at\np. 2.)  Between 1974-1977, the Court held several hearings which\nresulted in the Court accepting the parties’ joint stipulation on\nJune 3, 1977.  See Docket No. 0 at pp. 3-5.  The Court monitored\nand  ensured  the  Commonwealth’s  compliance  with  the  joint\nstipulation through reports from Court-appointed Monitor, Professor\nDavid Helfeld, and additional Court orders, with special attention\npaid to the deinstitutionalization of RPPH.  See Docket 0 at pp. 9-\n35.  In the early 1990s, several appeals were taken to the First\nCircuit Court of Appeals.  See, e.g., Navarro-Ayala v. Hernandez-\nColon, 3 F.3d 464 (1st Cir. 1993); Navarro-Ayala v. Nuñez, 968 F.2d\n1421 (1st Cir. 1992); Navarro-Ayala v. Hernandez-Colon, 951 F.2d\n1325  (1st  Cir.  1991)  (“Navarro  I”).    In  Navarro  I,  the  First\nCircuit Court of Appeals found that this suit was a class action\neven  though  it  had  not  been  certified  as  one  because  it  “was\ninstituted by a complaint seeking class relief, implicitly granted\n\nCivil No. 74-1301 (FAB) 3\nclass relief, and was conducted for years as a de facto class\naction.”  Navarro I, 951 F.2d at 1334.  The First Circuit Court of\nAppeals defined the class as “all persons who were patients when\nsuit was brought and all persons who may in the future receive\ntreatment or habilitation at [RPPH].”  Id. at 1337.\nIn 1996, the Court ordered acceptance of the “Plan for aSystem\n[sic] of Mental and Health Treatment/Rehabilitation Services” (“the\n1996 Rehabilitation Plan”).  (Docket No. 0 at p. 33.)  In 1997,\nfollowing discussions regarding the 1977 consent decree, the Court\nnoted that the Commonwealth had made significant improvement in\npatient care at RPPH in compliance with the 1977 consent decree and\nreturned $95,000 in fines previously assessed to the Commonwealth.\n(Docket Nos. 425; 432; 439; 443; 594 at p. 4; 604 at p. 2.)  Such\nprogress had been made by 1999 that RPPH achieved accreditation by\nMedicare and a nation-wide health care commission.  (Docket No. 604\nat p. 2.)\nIn March 2000, the Court approved a joint stipulation and\nordered that all money RPPH received from Medicare was to be used\nfor operating the facility.  (Docket No. 476.)  In August 2000, the\nCourt approved a second joint stipulation dismissing the case under\nspecified  conditions,  including  continued  accreditation  and  a\nyearly budget of at least $18,929,000 for patient care at RPPH.\n(Docket Nos.  494;  604  at p.  2.)  In 2002, the Court approved\nanother joint stipulation, which dismissed the case but kept in\n\nCivil No. 74-1301 (FAB) 4\nplace the Court’s March 2000 and August 2000 orders.  (Docket\nNo. 503.)\nIn 2003, the Court opened an investigation and reappointed\nProfessor Helfeld as the Monitor in response to a letter from\nemployees of San Patricio Mental Health Center (“SPMHC”) alleging\ndeficiencies  in  patient  care  at  that  facility,  with  special\nemphasis on RPPH’s budget and SPMHC’s continued existence as a\npublic institution.  (Docket No. 508 at pp. 1-2.)  Following five\nreports  by  the  monitor,  the  Court  concluded  its  investigation\nfinding  the  Commonwealth  in  “substantial  compliance  with  the\nconsent decree and the January 28, 2002 order.”  (Docket No. 604 at\npp. 3-4.)  The Court noted that the budget allowance and usage at\nRPPH would exceed the required $18,929,000 and that outpatient\nservices at SPMHC would not be closed or privatized.2  Id.  The\nCourt  also  instructed  the  Commonwealth  to  ensure  continued\naccreditation, to continue providing outpatient services at SPMHC,\nand to increase RPPH’s annual budget to $23,000,000.  Id. at pp. 4-\n5.\nAgain in 2013, the Court received a letter from mental health\nstaff members alleging violations by the Commonwealth, specifically\nunderstaffing,  an  insufficient  budget,  and  a  possible  loss  of\naccreditation.  (Docket No. 606 at pp. 1-2.)  On September 26,\n2  San  Patricio  outpatient  services  are  connected  to  the\ndeinstitutionalization of RPPH.  See Docket No. 604 at p. 3.\n\nCivil No. 74-1301 (FAB) 5\n2014, Grupo moved to reopen the case, complaining of understaffing\nand threats of closing SPMHC.  (Docket No. 608.)  In response, the\nCourt has reopened the case, (Docket No. 631), appointed Daniel E.\nWathen as the monitor, (Docket No. 657), and held several hearings\nregarding the alleged violations, (Docket Nos. 622; 647; 656). \nAdditionally,  the  Court  appointed  attorney  Judith  Berkan\n(“Berkan”), a civil rights attorney with forty years of experience,\n(Docket No. 668 at p. 2), to represent plaintiff Grupo, (Docket\nNo. 630), and ordered the Commonwealth to pay her attorney’s fees,\n(Docket No. 673).  The Commonwealth did not oppose Grupo’s original\nmotion for payment of attorney’s fees, (Docket No. 668), but now\nseeks reconsideration of the Court’s order for payment, (Docket\nNo. 678).\nLegal Standard for Motions for Reconsideration\n“The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not specifically\nprovide for the filing of motions for reconsideration.”  Sanchez-\nPerez v. Sanchez-Gonzalez, 717 F. Supp. 2d 187, 193-94 (D.P.R.\n2010) (Besosa, J.) (quoting Sanchez-Medina v. UNICCO Serv. Co., 265\nF.R.D.  29,  32  (D.P.R.  2010)).    A  district  court,  through  its\ninherent power, can reconsider interlocutory orders until the entry\nof judgment.  See Mun. of San Sebastian v. Commonwealth of P.R.,\n116  F.  Supp.  3d  49,  53  (D.P.R.  2015)  (Besosa,  J.)  (citing\nFernandez-Vargas v. Pfizer, 522 F.3d 55, 61 n.2 (1st Cir. 2008));\nsee also Geffon v. Micrion Corp., 249 F.3d 29, 38 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nCivil No. 74-1301 (FAB) 6\nHere, defendants move the Court to reconsider an interlocutory3\norder awarding attorney’s fees.\nA district court will alter its original order only if 10it\n“evidenced a manifest error of law, if there is newly discovered\nevidence, or in certain other narrow situations.”  Biltcliffe v.\nCitiMortgage, Inc., 772 F.3d 925, 930 (1st Cir. 2014) (quoting\nGlobal Naps, Inc. v. Verizon New England, Inc., 489 F.3d 13, 25\n(1st  Cir.  2007)).    Because  defendants  here  present  no  newly\ndiscovered information, the Court reviews its grant of attorney’s\nfees to attorney Berkan for a “manifest error of law.”\nDiscussion\nThe “American Rule” for attorney’s fees prescribes that each\nparty will bear its own attorney’s fees “unless there is express\nstatutory authority to the contrary.”  De Jesus Nazario v. Morris\nRodriguez,  554  F.3d  196,  199  (1st  Cir.  2009)  (citing  Alyeska\nPipeline  Serv.  Co.  v.  Wilderness  Soc’y,  421  U.S.  240  (1975)).\nPursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988, a court has discretionary authority\nto compel payment of reasonable attorney’s fees to the “prevailing\n3  There  is  some  debate  over  whether  fee  awards  are  final  or\ninterlocutory.  See Gautreaux v. Chi. Hous. Auth., 491 F.3d 649,\n654 (7th Cir. 2007) (final); Commonwealth of Pa. v. Flaherty, 983\nF.2d 1267, 1277 (3rd Cir. 1993) (interlocutory).\n\nCivil No. 74-1301 (FAB) 7\nparty”4  in  an  action  enforcing  42  U.S.C.  §  1983.  42  U.S.C.\n§ 1988(b).  When evaluating fee requests, “the Court needs to\ndetermine whether:  (1) a party is in fact a ‘prevailing party;’\n(2) the compensation sought is reasonable (i.e.[,] calculation of\nthe lodestar); and (3) there are any additional but exceptional\nconsiderations that may require [the court] to adjust [the fee\namount] upward or downward.”  Rosario-Urdaz v. Rivera-Hernandez,\n451 F. Supp. 2d 305, 307-08 (D.P.R. 2006) (Casellas, J.) (citing\nHensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433-34 (1983)).\nI. Prevailing Party\nA plaintiff prevails “when actual relief on the merits of his\nclaim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties\nby  modifying  the  defendant’s  behavior  in  a  way  that  directly\nbenefits the plaintiff.”  Lefemine v. Wideman, 133 S. Ct. 9, 11\n(2012) (quoting Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 111–12 (1992)).  A\nparty need not succeed in every claim to be a prevailing party, but\nmust “prevail[] on the merits of at least some of his claims.”\nBuckhannon Bd. & Care Home, Inc. v. W.Va. Dep’t of Health & Human\nRes., 532 U.S. 598, 603-04 (2001) (noting that even awards of\nnominal damages are sufficient for awarding attorney’s fees); see\nalso  Hensley,  461  U.S.  at  426-27  (awarding  attorney’s  fees  to\n4 Case law developing the term “prevailing party” is applicable\nregardless of the  underlying statute creating the fee-shifting\nprovision.  Hutchinson ex rel. Julien v. Patrick, 636 F.3d 1, 8 n.1\n(1st Cir. 2011); Smith v. Fitchburg Pub. Sch., 401 F.3d 16, 22 n.8\n(1st Cir. 2005).\n\nCivil No. 74-1301 (FAB) 8\npatients of a psychiatric hospital who won on five of their six\nclaims, including a claim for breach of constitutional rights based\non  substandard  treatment);  De  Jesus  Nazario,  554  F.3d  at  199\n(“[P]laintiffs may be considered prevailing parties for attorney’s\nfees  purposes  if  they  succeed  on  any  significant  issue  in\nlitigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in\nbringing suit.”  (quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 429)).\nA prevailing party must show “both a material alteration of\nthe legal relationship of the parties and there must be judicial\nimprimatur on the change.”  Smith v. Fitchburg Pub. Sch., 401 F. 3d\n16, 22 (1st Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks and citations\nomitted).  A judicial imprimatur requires that the change in the\nparties’ relationship be caused by the court, as opposed to by\nvoluntary  action  by  the  parties.    See  id.  at  27  (voluntary\nsettlement); Race v. Toledo-Davila, 291 F.3d 857, 585-59 (1st Cir.\n2002) (voluntary dismissal).  The United States Supreme Court has\nheld  that  consent  decrees  satisfy  both  the  change  in  legal\nrelationship and judicial imprimatur requirements for obtaining\nprevailing party status.  Buckhannon, 532 U.S. at 598, 604 (citing\nTex. State Teachers Ass’n v. Garland Indep. Sch. Dist., 489 U.S.\n782, 792 (1989) (internal citations omitted)); see also Maher v.\nGagne, 448 U.S. 122, 129 (1980) (establishing that “parties may be\nconsidered to have prevailed when they vindicate rights through a\nconsent judgment”) (quoting S. Rep. No. 94-1011, at 5 (1976)).\n\nCivil No. 74-1301 (FAB) 9\nCourt  orders  other  than  consent  decrees  can  also  satisfy  the\nprevailing party requirements if the court (1) orders a change in\nthe parties’ legal relationship, (2) approves relief based on the\nmerits,  and  (3)  maintains  oversight  to  enforce  the  parties’\nobligations.  Hutchinson ex rel. Julien v. Patrick, 636 F.3d 1, 9\n(1st Cir. 2011).\nA. Origin of Plaintiffs’ Prevailing Party Status\nPlaintiffs qualify for payment of interim attorney’s fees\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988 for work completed by attorney Berkan\nbecause  plaintiffs  qualify  as  a  prevailing  party  in  this\nlitigation.    Plaintiffs’  prevailing  party  status  was  first\nestablished by the Court’s 1977 consent decree.  See Buckhannon,\n532 U.S. at 598, 604 (stating a consent decree is sufficient to\nestablish prevailing party status).  Since 1977, the Court has\ntaken no action to remove the protections or change the legal\nrelationship created by its consent decree and orders.  But see\nSole  v.  Wyner,  551  U.S.  74,  83  (2007)  (revoking  the  party’s\nprevailing  party  status  when  the  court  overturned  a  previous\ndecision in the party’s favor).\nThe order enforcing the 1996 Rehabilitation Plan supports\nplaintiffs’ status as prevailing parties because it meets the three\nHutchinson  requirements  –  (1)  it  reiterates  the  change  in  the\nparties’ legal relationship that was created by the 1977 consent\ndecree; (2) it approves relief based on the merits by ordering\n\nCivil No. 74-1301 (FAB) 10\ndefendants  to  take  specific  actions  to  improve  treatment  and\nconditions  at  RPPH;  and  (3)  the  Court  continued  to  monitor\ndefendants’ actions after the order.  See Hutchinson, 636 F.3d\nat  9.    The  2002  Court  order  dismissing  the  case  also  affirms\nplaintiffs’ prevailing party status pursuant to the Hutchinson test\nbecause (1) it confirms that defendants still have a legal duty to\nplaintiffs to uphold the treatment standards espoused in prior\nCourt orders; (2) it dictates specific actions defendants must\ncontinue to take in compliance with the March 2000 and August 2000\norders;  and  (3)  the  Court  expressly  indicated  it  would  remain\ninvolved in the case to ensure compliance with the 2000 orders.\nSee Docket No. 503; Hutchinson, 636 F.3d at 9.  Similarly, the 2005\norder ending the  Court’s 2003-2005  investigation leaves intact\nplaintiffs’  prevailing  party  status  because  (1)  it  echoes  the\nexisting legal duty that defendants have to plaintiffs; (2) it\ninstructs  defendants  on  specific  actions  required  to  maintain\ntreatment standards (i.e., continued outpatient services at SPMHC,\nbudgetary  allotment  of  $23  million,  and  accreditation);  and\n(3)  despite  a  comment  that  the  Court’s  oversight  “cannot  –and\nshould  not–  last  forever,”  the  Court  retained  jurisdiction  to\nensure compliance with its previous orders.  See Docket No. 604 at\npp. 4-6.\n\nCivil No. 74-1301 (FAB) 11\nB. Grupo’s Prevailing Party Status\nPlaintiffs’  prevailing  party  status  extends  to  Grupo\nbecause Grupo is a part of the plaintiff class.  The plaintiff\nclass consists of “all persons who were patients when suit was\nbrought and all persons who may in the future receive treatment or\nhabilitation  at  [RPPH].”    Navarro-Ayala,  951  F.2d  at  1337.\nAlthough the First Circuit Court of Appeals did not extend the\nclass to patients at a different mental health facility known as\nthe Guerrero Therapeutic Community, located seventy miles west of\nRPPH, id. at 1337, 1343, the Court declines to apply a similar\nrestriction to patients at SPMHC due to its geographic proximity to\nRPPH, its location “within the municipality of San Juan,” see id.\nat 1327, and the increased integration of the two facilities caused\nby this litigation  and  Commonwealth-wide mental health reform.\nThis decision is consistent with the Court’s previous decision to\ninvestigate alleged violations at the SPMHC in 2003.  See Docket\nNo. 508.  Because Grupo is an organization made up of class-member\npatients of SPMHC who were patients when the case was filed or\nbecame patients in the time since, it is part of the plaintiff\nclass.  Accordingly, plaintiffs’ prevailing party status applies to\nGrupo because relief granted to the class applies to members who\njoin the class after the Court’s order.  See Theriault v. Carlson,\n353 F. Supp. 1061, 1066-67 (N.D. Ga. 1973), rev’d on other grounds,\n495  F.2d  390  (5th  Cir.  1974)  (stating  that  plaintiff  class\n\nCivil No. 74-1301 (FAB) 12\nmembership is “not static but consists of, all members of the\n[class] whether or not they were members at the time th[e] lawsuit\nwas brought . . . [because holding] to the contrary would have the\ncourt affirmatively sanction, against new members of the [class],\nthe [constitutional violations] which it condemned against the old”\n(internal citations and italics omitted)).\nC. Defendants’ Challenge to Plaintiffs’ Prevailing Party\nStatus\nDefendants argue that the Court re-opened this case for\nthe  limited  purpose  of  investigating  whether  defendants  had\nviolated  the  parties’  stipulations  or  the  Court’s  subsequent\norders, and that because no ruling has been made by the Court on\nthis “tangent[ial] issue” of stipulation violation, Grupo does not\nqualify  as  a  prevailing  party.    (Docket  No.  678  at  pp.  4-5.)\nEssentially, defendants argue that plaintiffs’ prevailing party\nstatus does not carry over to the current dispute because the\ncurrent dispute is unrelated to the previous proceedings.\nDefendants’  attempt  to  segregate  the  Court’s  current\ninvestigation  from  the  overall  litigation  of  this  case  is\nunavailing.  As one court has stated, the “language [of § 1988 and\nrelated cases] strongly indicates that whether a party ‘prevailed’\nas that term is used in § 1988 is determined by examination of the\nentire  case  and  not  at  various  stages  of  the  litigation.”\nDougherty  v.  Barry,  820  F.  Supp.  20,  25  (D.D.C.  1993)  (“[A]\nproposed bifurcated definition of the prevailing party is lacking\n\nCivil No. 74-1301 (FAB) 13\nin logical force.  Regardless of how many courts consider this\nmatter, it is only one lawsuit with only one prevailing party.”)\n(quoting Clymore v. Far–Mar–Co, Inc., 576 F. Supp. 1161, 1164 (W.D.\nMo. 1983))).\nIn  a  similar  institutional  reform  case,  the  Seventh\nCircuit Court of Appeals awarded attorney’s fees to the plaintiffs\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988 for legal work performed more than\nthree decades after the original consent decree.  Gautreaux v. Chi.\nHous. Auth., 491 F.3d 649, 651-52 (7th Cir. 2007).  In Gautreaux,\nAfrican-American public housing tenants and applicants secured a\nremedial  decree  “designed  to  ban  racially  discriminatory  site\nselection and tenant assignment policies.”  Id. at 652.  As public\nhousing  reform  took  place  in  the  1990s,  the  remedial  decree\nprecluded  certain  efforts  at  progress,  so  the  parties  worked\ntogether to petition the district court, on a case-by-case basis,\nfor waivers to the remedial decree.  Id. at 652-53.  The court\ngranted five such waivers and awarded plaintiffs attorney’s fees\nfor their work on each waiver request, noting that:\n[T]he post-decree proceedings and related work for which\nfees are presently sought are not “clearly separable”\nfrom the original judgment order . . . . [T]his case\ninvolves post-judgment work and proceedings that are all\npart of one active equitable case, in which compliance\nhas  always  been  at  issue,  and  modifications  and\nclarifications  of  the  original  judgment  order  must\ncontinuously be made to account for changing conditions\nand circumstances.\n\nCivil No. 74-1301 (FAB) 14\nId. at 653 (second alteration in original).  The Seventh Circuit\nCourt  of  Appeals  affirmed  the  district  court’s  order  awarding\nattorney’s fees to plaintiffs.  Id. at 651, 662.\nHere, as in Gautreaux, “this case involves post-judgment\nwork and proceedings that are all part of one active equitable\ncase, in which compliance has always been at issue.”  See id.\nat 653.  The Court’s 1996 Rehabilitation plan and 2000, 2002, and\n2005 orders all sought to elicit compliance with provisions of the\noriginal 1977 consent decree, making some modifications in the\nmethods of achieving the consent decree’s goals to account for\nongoing advances in mental health treatment.  While the Court in\nGautreaux  considered  the  fee  award  for  the  fifth  waiver  as  a\nseparate proceeding due to numerous modifications of the original\ndecree  which  each  waived  some  of  the  plaintiffs’  protection\npursuant  to  the  original  consent  decree,  Gautreaux,  491  F.3d\nat 656, it is unnecessary to do so here because the Court’s post-\nconsent decree orders have reinforced the original consent decree\nas opposed to waiving its protections.  Because the Court’s post-\nconsent decree orders reinforced the original consent decree, the\nCourt has taken no action to remove the protections or change the\nlegal relationship created by its consent decree, and Gautreaux\nprovides persuasive authority for awarding attorney’s fees for\nlegal work performed several decades after the original decree, the\n\nCivil No. 74-1301 (FAB) 15\nCourt finds that plaintiffs’ prevailing party status remains intact\ndespite defendants’ argument to the contrary.\nII. Reasonable Compensation\nDefendants also argue that the Court failed to analyze the\nreasonableness  of  attorney  Berkan’s  fees.    (Docket  No.  678  at\np. 6.)  The First Circuit Court of Appeals has established the\nlodestar  method  of  calculating  fees  as  its  method  of  choice.\nMatalon v. Hynnes, 806 F.3d 627, 638 (1st Cir. 2015).  The lodestar\nmethod multiplies the number of hours worked by the prevailing\nparty’s attorneys, excluding “excessive, redundant, or otherwise\nunnecessary” hours, by a reasonable hourly rate, as determined by\ncomparison  to  rates  in  the  community  for  attorneys  of  equal\n“qualifications, experience, and competence.”  Id. (quoting Cent.\nPension Fund of the Int’l Union of Operating Eng’rs & Participating\nEmp’rs v. Ray Haluch Gravel Co., 745 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2014)).\nHere, attorney Berkan has submitted a detailed time record\nwhich documents the date, task description, and amount of time for\neach  task  she  has  performed  pursuant  to  her  representation  of\nplaintiffs.  See Docket No. 674-1; see also Lipsett v. Blanco, 975\nF.2d 934, 938 (1st Cir. 1992) (finding attorney’s billing records\nto be acceptable when they listed “the different tasks performed,\nthe nature of the work, the time consumed, and the dates when\neffort was expended”).  Upon review of her time record, the Court\ndoes not find any excessive or redundant entry.\n\nCivil No. 74-1301 (FAB) 16\n Additionally, the Court finds the rate of $250 per hour to be\ncomparable  to  rates  paid  to  other  experienced  civil  rights\nattorneys  practicing  in  the  San  Juan  metropolitan  area.    See\nGonzalez-Nieves  v.  Mun.  of  Aguadilla,  Civil  No.  3:13-cv-01132\n(JAF), 2016 WL 297432, at *2 (D.P.R. 2016) (Fuste, J.) (finding\n$280 for court appearances and $250 for out-of-court work to be a\nreasonable rate for attorney’s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988\nfor  an  experienced  attorney  in  a  successful  disability\ndiscrimination claim); see also Rosario-Urdaz, 451 F. Supp. 2d\nat  310  (finding  $250  to  be  a  reasonable  rate  for  in-court\nproceedings  for  an  attorney  with  thirty  years  of  civil  rights\nexperience); Anywhere Inc. v. Romero, 344 F. Supp. 2d 345, 348\n(D.P.R. 2004) (Laffitte, J.) (finding $250 to be a reasonable rate\nfor an experienced attorney).  According to the lodestar method,\nthe reasonable attorney’s fees for attorney Berkan’s work completed\nbetween June 9, 2015 and February 24, 2016 equate to $19,087.50.5\nIII. Exceptional Considerations\nFinally, defendants argue that the Court failed to consider\nany  relevant  “exceptional  consideration”  that  may  increase  or\nreduce the fee award.  (Docket No. 678 at p. 6.)  After calculating\nthe lodestar, “[t]he court may . . . adjust the potential award\nbased  on  factors  not  captured  in  the  lodestar  calculation.”\nMatalon,  806  F.3d  at  638.    “[A]  prevailing  plaintiff  should\n5 Lodestar = 76.35 hours x $250 hourly rate = $19,087.50.\n\nCivil No. 74-1301 (FAB) 17\nordinarily recover an attorney’s fee unless special circumstances\nwould render such an award unjust.”  De Jesus Nazario, 554 F.3d\nat 199 (quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 429).  “[T]he burden is on the\ndefendant  to  show  that  unusual  conditions  would  make  an  award\nunjust or inappropriate.”  Id. at 200 (quoting United States v.\nCofield,  215  F.3d  164,  171  (1st  Cir.  2000)).    Examples  of\nexceptional considerations include a fee enhancement for “stellar\nperformance,” a fee reduction for overstaffing a case, Lipsett, 975\nF.2d at 938, 942, and a reduction for time spent on unrelated,\nfailed claims, Rosario-Urdaz, 451 F. Supp. 2d at 310.\nHere, defendants fail to assert any special consideration that\nthe Court may have overlooked.  Because attorney Berkan did not\ncharge for work on unrelated or failed claims and because she is\nnot  overstaffing  this  case.    Accordingly,  the  Court  finds  no\nexceptional circumstances at this time and declines to increase or\ndecrease the amount of her fees as calculated using the lodestar\nmethod.    Whether  she  performs  at  a  “stellar”  level  will  be\ndetermined as the case proceeds.\nConclusion\nPlaintiffs became prevailing parties in 1977 when the Court\nissued a consent decree approving the parties’ joint stipulation to\nimprove conditions at the PRRH.  Plaintiffs retain their prevailing\nparty status despite the 2002 dismissal of the case and 2003-2005\ninvestigation.  Grupo enjoys prevailing party status as part of the\n\nCivil No. 74-1301 (FAB) 18\nplaintiff class.  Furthermore, the amount awarded for attorney\nBerkan’s work is reasonable and no special circumstances exist to\nalter the amount calculated using the lodestar method.  Therefore,\npayment to Grupo for the attorney’s fees of attorney Berkan in the\namount of $19,087.50 is justified and there is no manifest error of\nlaw in the Court’s prior order awarding attorney’s fees, (Docket\nNo. 673).  Accordingly, defendants’ motion for reconsideration,\n(Docket No. 678), is DENIED.  Attorney Berkan’s fees will be paid\nno later than June 15, 2016.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\nSan Juan, Puerto Rico, May 12, 2016.\ns/ Francisco A. Besosa\nFRANCISCO A. BESOSA\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE",

We hold that this suit is\na class action and that the provisions of the stipulation do not apply at the other institution.\n1327  SUMMARY OF FACTS AND ISSUES\n*1327\nIn 1974 Roberto Navarro Ayala (\"Navarro\"), a mentally retarded patient at the Psychiatric Hospital of the\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico, a public mental health institution located in Río Piedras, San Juan (\"Hospital\" or\n\"Río Piedras\"), filed a complaint under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, on\nbehalf of himself and all others at the Hospital, asserting that the inhumane conditions there violated plaintiffs'\nconstitutional rights. Included as defendants were the Governor and other Commonwealth officials having control\nover the Hospital.\nIn 1977, before trial, the parties executed, and the district court approved, a stipulation effectively ending the suit.\nThe stipulation provided for numerous specified improvements in respect to what was termed the \"institution and\nits residents.\" The word \"institution\" was defined in the stipulation as being \"The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\nPsychiatric Hospital as presently constituted or in Decentralized form.\"\nIn the ensuing fourteen years, defendants have taken many steps under the supervision of the district court to\ncomply with the terms of the stipulation. Recently, however, disputes have arisen as to the court's right to force\nthe defendants to apply the stipulated measures at a different facility known as the Guerrero Therapeutic\nCommunity (\"Guerrero\") to which certain of the Hospital's former patients were sent as part of the process of\nrelieving overcrowding at the Hospital. Defendants contend (1) that the district court's jurisdiction is limited to\nordering relief to Navarro personally, the only named plaintiff, because a class of patients was never certified, and\nnotice was never given to the class; and (2) that the stipulation currently governs only the care and treatment of\npatients at the Psychiatric Hospital in Río Piedras, within the municipality of San Juan, and does not regulate the\ncare and treatment of patients at Guerrero.\n\nIn a March 6, 1990 \"Opinion and Order,\" the district court held that this suit was a class action. The court also\nreaffirmed its position that it had \"jurisdiction\" not only over Río Piedras but also over Guerrero in respect to the\ntreatment and living conditions of former Río Piedras patients there. Defendants appealed from these rulings.\nBACKGROUND\nA. The Institution\nDuring the early part of the 1970s, as now, the Psychiatric Hospital in Río Piedras, San Juan, was one of the\nhospitals offering mental health services as part of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico's Department of Health\nMental Health Program. In the words of the 1977 stipulation, the Hospital offered hospitalization 24 hours a day,\nemergency psychiatric services and admissions, and outpatient psychiatric services. According to the stipulation,\nreferrals came \"from the Northeastern Region of Mental Health Centers of Arecibo, Manati, Bayamón, Caguas,\nCarolina, Fajardo, Humacao, San Patricio and Cayey.\" (We take judicial notice that the Guerrero Therapeutic\nCommunity in dispute is located outside and to the west of the above-named communities; its locus, the city of\nAguadilla, is in the northwest corner of Puerto Rico, roughly 70 miles from San Juan.)\nIn the early 1970s the Hospital was badly overcrowded and urgently in need of improvement. According to\nallegations of plaintiffs' complaint, it lacked essential physical facilities, such as lockers where patients could\nsafely keep their personal belongings, clocks in all wards, visible calendars, lamps, night tables, lounging areas\nwith comfortable chairs, pictures, magazines, books and other items of normal daily living. Beds in the wards did\nnot have pillows, the laundry service was faulty, and the bathrooms and hallways were not deodorized. Patients\nwould be placed naked in isolation rooms which lacked toilet facilities. Not only were the facilities faulty, but so,\ntoo, was the treatment. Therapeutic treatment was insufficient, as the Hospital was understaffed. Many patients\n1328 allegedly did not have comprehensive habilitation plans addressed to their individual needs; and, in some wards, \n*1328 patients were grouped according to their geographical origin, regardless of their mental condition and\nneeds.\nB. The Plaintiff\n\"Navarro\" was referred to a social worker at the Psychiatric Hospital in Río Piedras in 1970, when he was 19\nyears old because of \"abnormal behavior.\" After attempts to treat Navarro's mental illness using only out-patient\nservices had failed, his mother had him committed to the Hospital in April of 1974.\nC. Evolution of this Appeal\nOn November 25, 1974, Navarro, represented by his mother, Maria Ayala, filed a complaint in the District Court\nfor the District of Puerto Rico \"on behalf of all allegedly mentally incapacitated persons now residents at the\nPsychiatric Hospital ... or that are receiving mental treatment in said Hospital.\" The complaint contained detailed\nallegations criticizing conditions at the Hospital and the treatment received by patients therein; included were the\nallegations outlined above. The complaint alleged that these conditions at the Psychiatric Hospital violated\nprovisions of the Bill of Rights of the United States Constitution, depriving Navarro of his right to privacy, his right\nnot to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment, his right not to be subjected to involuntary servitude, his\nright to equal protection under the law, and his right to treatment. The complaint alleged that the Psychiatric\nHospital \"is not a therapeutic institution. It resembles a prison....\" It further alleged that the Psychiatric Hospital's\nenvironment \"is inhumane and psychologically destructive\" due to overcrowding and lack of minimal physical and\nhealth facilities. Other inadequacies of the Psychiatric Hospital were delineated. While describing at length the\nwretched conditions at the Psychiatric Hospital, the complaint did not allege similar inadequacies at any other of\nthe Commonwealth's mental health facilities. The prayers in the complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief\nsolely at the Hospital: they requested a declaration that the Psychiatric Hospital did not meet constitutionally\nminimum standards; a judicial determination of what proper standards the Constitution required for residents of\n\nthe Psychiatric Hospital; and an injunction against the unconstitutional conditions there. The court was asked to\nenjoin further admissions to the Hospital until it had determined that the Hospital met such standards as the court\nspecified.\nThe complaint named as defendants: Rafael Hernández Colón, as Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto\nRico; José Alvarez de Choudens, then Secretary of Health of the Commonwealth; José A. Nuñez-López, then\nAssistant Secretary of Health; Erick Santos, then Director of the Commonwealth's Psychiatric Hospital;\nConcepción Pérez, then Administrator of the Hospital Center of Puerto Rico, and their \"agents, employees and/or\nsuccessors in office.\"\n1975 00 June 1977: The Stipulation\n97\nThe defendants answered the complaint on March 21, 1975, denying most of its allegations, including that the\nsuit was properly a class action. The defendants also denied that the district court had jurisdiction. However,\nbefore the case could be set for pretrial in May 1977, all parties engaged in negotiations resulting in agreement\non the terms of a comprehensive stipulation in settlement of the lawsuit. On April 20, 1977, they submitted the\nstipulated agreement for the court's approval. The remedying of the existing conditions at the Psychiatric Hospital\nwas the central theme of the stipulation; it included 86 standards that the parties stipulated would be observed at\nthe Hospital. Short term plans included removal of the mentally retarded and other long term patients who did not\nrequire this type of hospital care to the Cayey and Bayamón Psychosocial and Rehabilitation Centers, and\nincluded the placement of additional patients in the foster home care program. The agreement contained no\nexpress provisions that the 86 standards, or any of them, would be effectuated at the Cayey and Bayamón\n1329 facilities, nor did it mention at all the Guerrero Therapeutic Community in Aguadilla. The *1329 court approved\nthe stipulation and on June 3, 1977 entered judgment \"in accordance with all the agreements made by the\nparties.\"\nAppointment of the Special Master\nBetween July 1977 and 1984, there was little activity in the case. On January 31, 1985, the district court held a\nstatus conference, and, on February 1, 1985, entered an order granting plaintiff's request that a master be\n[1]\nappointed.  On February 8, 1985, the court appointed Dr. David Helfeld, former Dean of the University of Puerto\nRico Law School, as Special Master (\"Master\"). The court charged the Master to see to the carrying out of the\nstipulation within the shortest feasible time period. The Master periodically informed the district court of his\nmonitoring activities, and made recommendations on ways to achieve compliance. The Master asserted in\nseveral of his recommendations that bringing Río Piedras into compliance with the consent decree would require\nimprovements to other facilities as well as to Río Piedras. As of November 1990, a total of thirteen reports had\nbeen filed with the district court.\nOn April 10, 1985, a hearing was held before the Master on plaintiff Navarro's condition. The director of the\nHospital thereafter took measures to provide Navarro with the care required by the consent decree. An individual\ntreatment plan was prepared for him.\n1986 00 1990\n97\nBy April 11, 1986, the Hospital was still overcrowded. The Hospital's total census was 421, not counting 64\npatients out on passes. Only 312 beds were available and, according to the Hospital's medical director, 296 was\nthe ideal number of patients until adequate staffing could be provided. A number of alternatives to solve this\nproblem were discussed by the defendants and the Master. During this period the Commonwealth made\navailable additional funds totaling $8 million for all mental health programs.\nAfter tendering his preliminary fourth report, the Master asked the defendants for a compliance proposal that\nwould bring the case to a close. After several drafts of a compliance plan had been proposed and rejected, on\nJune 29, 1987, the Secretary of Health submitted a third plan (\"Plan 3\"). Plan 3 proposed converting the Hospital\n\n[2]\ninto a 250-bed hospital treating only acute and subacute patients,  and transferring less severe patients to\noutside private facilities paid for by the Department. Pressure on the emergency ward was to be relieved through\nthe use of three ambulatory facilities. Facilities in San Patricio and Caguas, both located in the San Juan\nmetropolitan area, would receive emergency patients from the western and southern parts of the metropolitan\narea, respectively. The Guerrero Therapeutic Community, located on the western side of Puerto Rico in Aguadilla,\n70 miles from San Juan, would take in emergency patients from the Arecibo area. Other Commonwealth mental\nhealth facilities were also to take responsibility for patients previously directed to the Hospital. Overcrowding\nwould thus be eliminated, with care in other Commonwealth or private facilities provided both for many\nemergency and intensive care patients as well as for those patients needing residential facilities or family-care\n[3]\nalternatives.\n1330 *1330 After reviewing this proposal, the Master submitted the final version of his fourth report. The report\nrecommended to the court that Plan 3 \"be incorporated into the Court's Order.\" This report also suggested that\nthe court take a number of actions with respect to \"pre- and post-Hospital programs whose support is essential to\nthe Hospital's compliance with the Court's consent order.\" These actions included requiring the Secretary to\nreport on the budget of such institutions and charging \"[t]he mental health system ... with responsibility for all\npatients who are neither acute or subacute.\" With respect to the Guerrero facility, the Master stated that \"[s]ince\nits initial planning stage the Hospital has had a direct relationship with [Guerrero],\" and therefore recommended\nthat the court direct the defendants to set aside 144 beds in Module 7 of Guerrero for patients transferred from\n[4]\nthe Hospital.\nOn August 5, 1987, the defendants filed exceptions and commentaries to the Master's fourth report. While noting\nthat \"[t]he class in the present action is composed of the patients of the Psychiatric Hospital and the institutions\nwherever they may be referred to in a descentralization [sic] program,\" the defendants asked that the court\n\"maintain the scope of the class in the above captioned case and the stipulations agreed on by admitting from\nPlan 3 those portions that apply to the Psychiatric Hospital.\" The defendants now claim that, through this filing,\nthey objected to the application of the stipulation beyond Río Piedras.\nOn August 10, 1987, in response to the Master's fourth report and the defendants' exceptions thereto, the court\nissued an order. As suggested by the Master, the order \"incorporated\" Plan 3, instructed the Secretary to report\non the budgets for \"the Hospital and the pre- and post-Hospital programs whose support is essential to the\nHospital's compliance,\" and stated that the Commonwealth's mental health system would be \"charged\" with care\nand treatment of patients who were \"neither acute or subacute.\" With respect to the issue of \"jurisdiction,\" the\ncourt treated the defendants' exceptions and commentaries as an objection to its \"jurisdiction\" over the \"network\nof pre- and post-Hospital services.\" In response to this objection, the court stated that it had no intention of\nconcerning itself with matters not directly related to the Hospital's compliance with the stipulation. The court\nadded, however, that \"this translates principally into a concern that pre- and post-Hospital facilities be adequately\nfunded. There is also the related concern that patients transferred from the Hospital to transitional and psychiatric\nrehabilitation services receive care and treatment consistent with the 86 stipulations.\" The defendants did not\nappeal from this order.\nThe transfer of 144 patients to Module 7 of Guerrero took place as ordered. This transfer appears to have been\npart of a large scale exodus of patients from Río Piedras. According to the Master's tenth report, during the eight\nmonths following the court's August 10, 1987 order, 904 patients left the Hospital. Of these, 343 were \"transferred\nto the transitional services suited to their individual needs,\" and the balance apparently left the Puerto Rico\n[5]\nmental health system.\nAt the same time these transfers were occurring, the Master, with the consent of the defendants, conducted\nseveral visits to various facilities, including Guerrero, (the \"tripartite visits\") to assess the defendants' progress.\nThe Master indicated that by April 27, 1988 overcrowding at the Río Piedras Emergency Ward had been\n1331 eliminated and the PIC (Emergency) unit inaugurated. *1331 On May 23, 1988, the Master submitted his sixth\nreport to the court. The Master stated that the acute system of care was functioning in substantial compliance\nwith the stipulation, and that the process of deinstitutionalization had continued at a good pace and was in its final\nphase. Notwithstanding these improvements, plaintiffs argued in 1988 that the tripartite visits had revealed that\n\nthe transitional services offered at several facilities other than Rio Piedras, including Guerrero, were in need of a\nstrengthened program of occupational therapy. The Master, however, questioned his own authority to address\nthat contention, stating:\n[t]hat the program of Transitional Services can be strengthened also is undoubtedly true, but in my\nopinion questions of that sort are not covered by the Consent Decree's ... stipulations and,\ntherefore, it would be inappropriate for this report to make findings exceeding the limited standard\nof comparing the Hospital and post hospital conditions of the 343 transferred patients.\nOn June 28, 1988, the defendants submitted a motion claiming that the case should be closed because the\n[6]\ngovernment had substantially complied with the 1977 stipulation.  The court denied this motion on December 8,\n1988, ruling that the Hospital was not in \"full compliance.\"\nOn May 12, 1989, the Master submitted his eighth preliminary report covering the period of October 1988 to April\n18, 1989. The report noted the problems faced by the Hospital in its effort to achieve full compliance. The\nDepartment of Health had not made available a sufficient number of transitional or post-hospitalization residential\nfacilities. According to the report, the failure to provide sufficient units of transitional services was one of the\nprincipal causes for the Hospital's failure to achieve full compliance.\nA number of meetings were then held between the parties and the Master to determine the substantive criteria\nand procedure to be followed in assessing whether full compliance had been achieved. Since no consensus was\nreached, each party submitted its own proposal to the Master. The Master, in his eighth preliminary report\nrecommended to the court that an \"interdisciplinary team,\" consisting of a psychiatrist, a social worker, a nurse,\nand an occupational therapist, be assembled to evaluate the substantive and procedural criteria for determining\ncompliance. On April 15, 1989, the court issued an order appointing the members of the interdisciplinary team\nand providing for their compensation.\nOn June 12, 1989, plaintiffs submitted to the Master a \"Motion Seeking Remedies,\" alleging that former Hospital\npatients transferred to Guerrero were not receiving adequate treatment. The motion alleged that there was\novercrowding at Guerrero, that the facilities were unsanitary and more akin to a concentration camp than a\ntherapeutic community. The Master's interdisciplinary team was instructed to visit Guerrero on June 19, 1989 and\nthereafter report to the court on its findings and recommendations regarding treatment at Guerrero. The\ninterdisciplinary team subsequently reported that former Rio Piedras patients at Guerrero lacked complete\nindividualized treatment plans and were not receiving the benefits of an adequate psychiatric rehabilitation\nprogram. Several meetings were held between the Master and Commonwealth officials to discuss this report.\nThe Commonwealth officials alleged that they faced problems in the recruitment and retaining of personnel due\nto the scarcity of professionals in the vicinity of Guerrero and the low government salaries.\nThe defendants then, in a September 6, 1989 letter, objected to the Court's \"jurisdiction\" over Guerrero. This\nobjection was formally raised before the court in an October 20, 1989 motion. On December 28, 1989, the district\n1332 court issued an opinion and order, addressing two questions. First *1332 was \"whether the court has jurisdiction\nover patients of the Rio Piedras Psychiatric Hospital who have been transferred to the Therapeutic Community at\nGuerrero.\" Second was whether those patients had \"received, or [were then receiving] adequate psychiatric\nrehabilitation services.\"\nWith respect to the first question, the court concluded that:\nThe Court's August 10, 1987 Order clarified that it had jurisdiction over Rio Piedras Psychiatric\nHospital patients transferred to Guerrero. In response to defendant's November 20, 1989 motion,\nthe Court now reaffirms its jurisdiction over the latter patients.\nThis \"jurisdiction\" empowered the court to \"secure compliance with the 86 stipulations in the Consent Decree,\nwith the terms of the August 10, 1987 order, and all other pertinent orders issued by the Court.\" Although the\ncourt stated that this conclusion was consistent with the language of the stipulation, it did not engage in any\ndetailed analysis of that language. Instead, it based its conclusion largely on Guerrero's role in relieving\novercrowding at Rio Piedras, the parties' actions subsequent to the drafting of the stipulation and its previous\n\norder of August 10, 1987. Thus the court stated that its conclusion was grounded on the Master's view that the\nHospital \"could only comply with the stipulations if it were conceived as an integral part of a system of mental\nhealth care which, besides the Hospital, necessarily included a network of pre- and post-hospital services.\" The\ncourt further stated that Plan 3, and the letter commitments of the Secretary concerning Guerrero, were proposed\nby the Secretary, at his initiative, accepted by the plaintiffs, adopted by the court and incorporated in the August\n10, 1987 order. The court therefore held that, because of its August 10 order \"incorporating\" Plan 3, Plan 3 was\nas much a binding legal obligation as the stipulated agreement once it was incorporated in the\nConsent Decree. The Court's August 10, 1987 Order does not modify the stipulated agreements,\nas defendants claim, but rather represents an instrument proposed by the Secretary and accepted\nby the court. It also serves to clarify the scope of the court's jurisdiction, which in the case of\nGuerrero is explicitly included.\nIn addition, the court found that the defendants had manifested their consent to its \"jurisdiction\" by failing to\nobject to several early reports of the Master concerning the reach of the stipulations, the tripartite visits, or the\nvisits of the interdisciplinary team.\nHaving found that it had \"jurisdiction\" over former Rio Piedras patients transferred to Guerrero, the court went on\nto address the plaintiffs' contention that those patients were not receiving adequate rehabilitation services. The\ncourt determined that those patients \"were not receiving adequate psychiatric rehabilitation services on June 19,\n1987 and for an indeterminate period of time prior to that date.\" However, the court was unable to determine\nwhether those services had been adequate since September 6, 1989. Therefore, the court ordered the Master to\ndevelop \"criteria for evaluating Guerrero's rehabilitation services ... based on the stipulations, the court's August\n10, 1987 Order, and, as well, the concept of a therapeutic community as enunciated by the Mental Health\nSecretariat.\" The court postponed its decision to fine the defendants, as requested by the Master, to a later date.\n[7]\nOn January 16, 1990, the defendants moved the court under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e)  to alter or amend the\nDecember 28, 1989 opinion and order. The defendants argued in their motion that the district court's \"jurisdiction\"\ncould not extend beyond the scope of the stipulated agreement, that the stipulation was limited to conditions of\nconfinement and treatment at the Rio Piedras Psychiatric Hospital and, thus, that the court lacked \"jurisdiction\"\n1333 over the network of pre- and post-hospitalization services. *1333 The defendants also argued, for the first time\nsince their answer to the complaint in 1975, that a class of plaintiffs had never been certified as required by Fed.\nR.Civ.P. 23(c)(1). Plaintiffs opposed the defendants' motion under Rule 59(e) and moved for sanctions under\nFed.R.Civ.P. 11, stating that the defendants' motion under Rule 59(e) was frivolous.\nOn March 6, 1990, the district court issued another opinion and order reaffirming its \"jurisdiction\" over the\nnetwork of pre-and post-hospitalization services and over former Hospital patients transferred to Guerrero for\nlargely the same reasons as those set forth in its December 28 opinion and order. The court stated that \"the\nstipulated agreement was never understood as limited to conditions and services exclusively within the Hospital,\"\nand that, even if the stipulation's application to Guerrero \"is characterized as a modification, it was the\n[defendants'] doing in the first instance.\" The district court also rejected the defendants' assertion that it did not\nhave \"jurisdiction\" over these facilities based on principles of federalism. It found the defendants' arguments\n\"largely irrelevant.\"\nIn the March 6, 1990 opinion and order, the court also ruled that this action had been maintained as a class\naction since class certification was satisfied when the court approved the stipulated agreement in April of 1977.\nAs to notice to the class members, the district court found that the provision under Rule 23 requiring notice\nexisted essentially to permit individuals to request exclusion from the class, or to enter an appearance through\ntheir own counsel. Even if all the patients had been notified directly or through their respective guardians, the\ndistrict court found it inconceivable that any of them would have asked to be excluded from the benefits\nmandated by the agreement. The record reflects, the court said, that in thirteen years no patient nor his\nrespective guardian had come forth to complain that his rights under the stipulated agreement had in any way not\nbeen represented adequately by counsel for plaintiffs in the class action, nor had any member of the class sought\nto be represented by his or her own counsel. Finally, the court agreed with plaintiffs' view that the defendants'\n\narguments were frivolous and, pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 11 and 28 U.S.C. § 1927, assessed sanctions totaling\n[8]\n$1,500 in attorney's fees against counsel for the defendants.\nIt is from the March 6, 1990 order that the defendants appeal.\nI. CLASS ACTION\nDefendants contend that the suit Navarro instituted below never became a class action because a class was\n[9]\nnever certified as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(1).  Defendants point out that the purported members of the\nclass and their guardians were never notified of the proceedings in the case, either by counsel for plaintiff or by\nthe court-appointed Master. Finally, defendants argue that \"even though the parties entered into a stipulated\nagreement which the court approved, neither the stipulated agreement nor the court's judgment approving it\ndescribe the members of the class.\" Under defendants' view, only Navarro, the individual plaintiff, was a party to\nthe stipulated agreement, limiting defendants' duties to providing to Navarro alone whatever services he was\nentitled to receive.\n1334 *1334 The district court rejected this narrow characterization of the action. In its March 6, 1990 opinion and order,\nit held that the class action nature of this suit was implicitly certified by the court when, in 1977, it entered a\njudgment in accordance with the terms of the consent decree. While conceding that the court did not at the time\nor thereafter notify the members of the class, the district judge stated that it \"would not only be inequitable, it\nwould be absurd\" to declare, thirteen years after the stipulated agreement, that a class action had not been\nestablished.\nThe question of class certification here is not simple. See generally Pasadena City Board of Education v.\nSpangler, 427 U.S. 424, 430, 96 S.Ct. 2697, 2702, 49 L.Ed.2d 599 (1976) (absent certification, where named\nplaintiffs lost their interest in the lawsuit, case would have become moot, infra). In important public interest\nlitigation like this, we do not know how the parties and the original judge could have overlooked a key step like\nclass certification. Nonetheless, we are persuaded that because this case was instituted by a complaint seeking\nclass relief, implicitly granted class relief, and was conducted for years as a de facto class action, it should and\nmay be recognized as such. We shall address defendants' contrary arguments.\nA. Class Certification under Fed. R.Civ.P. 23(c)(1)\nIt was an egregious omission for the district court not to have determined explicitly, as soon as practicable after\nthis action commenced, whether it could be maintained as a class action and, if so, the proper description of the\n[10]\nclass. See Fed. R.Civ.P. 23(c)(1).  Certifying the class \"as soon as practicable\" under Rule 23(c)(1) is not a\nminor formality, but is necessary to give the action a clear definition. See Fed. R.Civ.P. 23(c)(1), advisory\ncommittee's notes to 1966 amendment. By focusing on the class issue early on, the district court identifies the\nplaintiffs, demarcates the boundaries of the legal dispute and makes provision to protect absent class members.\nIn so doing, of course, the district court may take advantage, to the extent appropriate, of the parties' own\nagreements and stipulations describing the nature of the suit and the existence of a class. See Willie M. v. Hunt,\n657 F.2d 55 (4th Cir.1981).\nWhile express class certification is a fundamental requirement, uncertified actions have on occasion been\nrecognized as class actions. When the parties stipulate that the action is a class action and clearly define the\nmembers of the class, and the court enters judgment pursuant to the stipulated terms, this may sufficiently imply\ncertification for purposes of Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(1). See Oburn v. Shapp, 393 F.Supp. 561 (E.D.Pa.) (holding that\nwhere the action was filed as a class action and a consent decree was entered into, entry of the consent decree\nwas sufficient certification of the action as a class action under Rule 23), aff'd on other grounds,521 F.2d 142 (3d\nCir.1975); Bing v. Roadway Express, Inc., 485 F.2d 441, 447 (5th Cir.1973) (where the plaintiff brought an action\nas a class action and the district court granted class relief, but neglected to certify the class, the district court\nnevertheless \"implicitly determined that th[e] suit would be maintained as a class action\").\n\nWhile the Supreme Court has yet to rule directly on the issue of implied certification, the Court has suggested, in\ndicta, that parties may not be able to rely on implicit class certification. Pasadena City Board of Education v.\nSpangler, 427 U.S. 424, 96 S.Ct. 2697, 49 L.Ed.2d 599 (1976). In Spangler, several students of a public school\nsystem sued the school board and several of its officials, alleging unconstitutional segregation. After trial, the\ndistrict court entered a judgment holding that the defendants' educational policies violated the Fourteenth\nAmendment, and, pursuant to the court's order, the defendants submitted a plan for systemwide relief. Four years\n1335 later, the defendants moved to modify *1335 the district court's order. This motion was denied on the merits by\nthe district court, 375 F.Supp. 1304 (1975), whose decision was affirmed by the Ninth Circuit, 519 F.2d 430\n(1975). Before considering the merits, however, the Supreme Court noted that, because the original plaintiffs had\ngraduated and no class had ever been certified under Rule 23, the case would be moot had the United States not\nintervened. The Court thus rejected the plaintiffs' argument 00 raised, insofar as appears from the published\n97\nopinions, for the first time in the Supreme Court 00 that \"th[e] litigation was filed as a class action, that all the\n97\nparties have until now treated it as a class action, and that the failure to obtain the class certification required\nunder Rule 23 is merely the absence of a meaningless `verbal recital.'\" 427 U.S. at 430, 96 S.Ct. at 2702. The\nCourt stated that \"while counsel may wish to represent a class of unnamed individuals still attending the\nPasadena public schools ... there has been no certification of any such class which is or was represented by a\nnamed party to this litigation. Except for the intervention of the United States, we think this case would clearly be\nmoot.\" Id. (citations omitted).\nAny expression by the Supreme Court, whether or not in dicta, must be taken seriously. Events here, however,\ncome much closer than in Spangler to actual class certification. Unlike in Spangler, the parties have executed,\nand the court has approved, a written stipulation providing not only for class-wide relief but describing those who\nconstitute the class. The named plaintiff, Navarro, sued expressly on behalf of himself and \"all allegedly mentally\nincapacitated persons now residents at the Psychiatric Hospital ... or that are receiving treatment in said\nHospital.\" The defendants, in their answer, denied, inter alia, that the suit was properly a class action. On April 8,\n1975, the plaintiffs filed a memorandum of law containing detailed arguments in support of treating the case as a\nclass action, but before the district court could rule on this motion, the parties submitted to the court on April 20,\n1977 a stipulated agreement in resolution of the case. After reviewing the provisions of the stipulation, the court\nentered judgment on June 2, 1977 \"in accordance with all the agreements made by the parties in said\nstipulation.\" One of the agreements so made by the parties was the stipulated definition of \"residents\" of the\nHospital (for whose benefit the operative clauses of the consent decree were drafted) as \"[a]ll persons who are\nnow patients and all persons who may in the future receive treatment or habilitation at such institution.\"\nOnce the plaintiffs and defendants stipulated to these matters, and the court entered judgment in accordance\nwith their written stipulation, the class nature of the suit was, in practical effect, \"established.\" The remedies in the\nstipulation clearly went far beyond the individual needs of the named plaintiff. It was fashioned as an instrument\nfor Hospital-wide change, affecting all patients at Rio Piedras, not just one patient. Consistent with the stipulation,\nthe sweeping hospital improvements later undertaken by the court, Master and parties were directed at benefiting\nthe entire patient class, not simply at helping the named plaintiff. Had defendants or the court not believed this\nwas a class action, they would hardly have taken the measures they did for thirteen years nor would defendants\n[11]\nhave failed to raise the issue until now.\nThe stipulation, moreover, specifically describes the class members who are to benefit from the stipulated relief. \nSupra. No stipulated agreement or definition appeared in Spangler. Thus, the stipulation served the purpose of\n1336 Rule 23 00 \"to give clear definition to the action,\" Fed.R.Civ.P. *1336 23(c)(1) advisory committee's notes to 1966\n97\namendment 00 even though it did not use the words \"class\" as such.\n97\nAnother difference between this case and Spangler is that, in the proceeding from which this appeal was taken,\nthe question of whether this was a class action was presented to the district court, which found that it was. The\ndefendants had argued the contrary position to the court. The court concluded that, while the original judge had\nnever expressly certified a class, a class had been intended and was defined in the stipulation, and that the court,\nthe parties and the Master had continuously viewed and treated the case as a class action. Thus the court of\nappeals is not being asked to imply certification for the first time on appeal from whatever it can discern of the\nactions of the parties below, as in Spangler. Rather the matter of class certification comes to us, after adversarial\n\npresentation below, with the benefit of a district court finding. The situation is close to that where a district court\ncertifies a class retroactively after judgment, having inadvertently failed to act earlier on a certification motion. \nSee Gurule v. Wilson, 635 F.2d 782, 790 (10th Cir.1980); Marshall v. Kirkland, 602 F.2d 1282, 1301 (8th Cir.1979)\n. Thus, notwithstanding the concerns Spangler raises, we think it proper to uphold the district court's ruling\n[12]\nsustaining the class nature of this suit.  We hold that the action may proceed as a class action.\nB. Notice to the Members of the Class\nDefendants also complain that neither the patients nor their guardians were given any notice regarding the\nproceedings in this case, either by counsel for the plaintiff or by the court-appointed Master. Defendants appear\nto focus on Rule 23(e), but since Rule 23(d)(2) as well as Rule 23(e) refers to notice, we review the arguments\nunder both.\n[13]\nRule 23(d)(2)  indicates that notice is not mandatory, but may be required by the court.\n\"Subdivision (d)(2) does not require notice at any stage, but rather calls attention to its availability\nand invokes the court's discretion. In the degree that there is cohesiveness or unity in the class\nand the representation is effective, the need for notice to the class will tend toward a minimum....\"\nFed.R.Civ.P. 23(d), advisory committee's notes to 1966 amendment. Hence, the notice contemplated under Rule\n23(d)(2) is discretionary. Penson v. Terminal Transport Co., 634 F.2d 989, 993 (5th Cir.1981); United States v.\nAllegheny-Ludlum Industries, Inc., 517 F.2d 826, 878 n. 86 (5th Cir.1975),cert. denied,425 U.S. 944, 96 S.Ct.\n1684, 48 L.Ed.2d 187 (1976). Commentators have stated that adequate representation alone will comply with the\ndue process demands of the rule, obviating constitutional need for notification of class certification. H. Newberg, \nNewberg on Class Actions, § 8.16 (2d ed. 1985). Thus, Rule 23(d)(2) did not require the district court to give\nnotice of class certification to the patients or their guardians.\n[14]\nThe language of Rule 23(e),  on the other hand, directs that notice be given to \"all members of the class\"\nbefore dismissal or compromise of a class action. Here, although the stipulation effectively compromised the\n1337 case, the district court *1337 entered judgment under the stipulation without first giving notice to class members.\nBut while Rule 23(e) directs the giving of notice, it leaves the form of the notice to the court's discretion; for this\nreason, courts have sometimes overlooked the absence of notice where there was clearly no prejudice to class\nmembers. See, e.g., Larkin General Hospital, Ltd. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 93 F.R.D. 497, 502 (E.D.Pa.1982)\n(dismissal of class action without notice said to be without prejudice to class). More important, where a cohesive\nclass is certified under Rule 23(b)(2), notice may suffice if given to a suitable class representative. See Walsh v.\nGreat Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., Inc., 726 F.2d 956, 962 (3d Cir.1983). We think that Puerto Rico Legal Services,\nwhich was counsel for Navarro and the class, may be considered a suitable representative for notice purposes\nhere, at least where, as found, there have never been complaints from putative class members. Counsel\nmonitored and actively participated in the settlement, which has resulted in significant benefits to the patient\nclass. Counsel obviously saw itself as representing the entire patient class at the Hospital, and not just the\nnamed plaintiff.\nThe lack of notice argument is particularly inappropriate coming, as it does, not from injured class members but\nfrom officials seeking to use the lack of notice as a basis for resisting the granting of relief to the plaintiff class. To\nuphold defendants for failure of notice to class members would be to wield the notice requirement as a sword\nagainst those it was meant to help.\nWe hold, in sum, that this suit is properly a class action brought in behalf of all persons who were patients when\nsuit was brought and all persons who may in the future receive treatment or habilitation at the Psychiatric\nHospital in Río Piedras.\n\nII. APPLICATION OF THE STIPULATION TO GUERRERO\nThe second issue is whether the district court correctly determined that the terms of the stipulation can be\nenforced in respect to former Hospital patients now residing at the Guerrero Therapeutic Community, a separate\ninstitution located in the city of Aguadilla, approximately 70 miles from the Hospital. The court ruled that the\nstipulation entered in 1977 applied to Guerrero in respect to the approximately 144 patients transferred there\nfrom Rio Piedras. The court therefore concluded that it had \"jurisdiction\" over Guerrero, and that the Master\nshould consider how the stipulation (although written chiefly in terms of the needs of Rio Piedras) should be\napplied to the rehabilitation services offered at Guerrero.\nWe hold that neither the terms of the stipulation nor the subsequent actions of the parties make the stipulation\napplicable at Guerrero.\nA. Standard of Review\n[15]\nThe present case was not resolved by judicial rulings and findings but by a court-approved stipulation.\nWhether the remedial provisions of the stipulation, and the district court's oversight, extend to Guerrero are,\ntherefore, matters of interpreting that stipulation. This, in turn, raises the question whether, on appeal, this court\nowes special deference to the district court's interpretation, over and above the deference we would normally\ngive to a lower court's construction of a contract. We think not, as the institutional coverage of the stipulation goes\nto the very heart of the parties' original bargain.\nWe recognize that this court has said that district courts enforcing public law consent decrees have, in general,\nbroad discretion in determining such matters as whether the objectives of the decree have been substantially\nachieved. United States v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 890 F.2d 507, 509 (1st Cir.1989). Unlike consent\n1338 decrees entered into in commercial litigation, which are to be construed *1338 throughout like a contract, id., the\ninterpretation of broad, programmatic decrees entered into in public law litigation will often warrant a more flexible\napproach. AMF, Inc. v. Jewett, 711 F.2d 1096, 1101 (1st Cir.1983). Thus, \"in examining a decree issued in public\nlaw litigation ... the appellate court should recognize that broad `judicial discretion may well be crucial' for the\ndistrict judge to secure complex legal goals.\" Massachusetts Association of Older Americans v. Commissioner of\nPublic Welfare, 803 F.2d 35, 38 (1st Cir.1986) (citations omitted).\nIn Langton v. Johnston, 928 F.2d 1206 (1st Cir.1991), we elaborated the rationale behind these two different\nstandards for interpreting consent decrees:\nThis double standard derives from the realities of human experience. Different types of consent\ndecrees are ordinarily conceived and hatched in markedly different ways. In a commercial setting,\na consent decree is treated like a contract because the court assumes that private parties\nunderstand the economic realities and business consequences of their agreements....\nIn public law litigation, courts typically play a proactive role 00 a role which can have nearly endless\n97\npermutations.... Frequently, the trial court's adjudicative function blends with its service as an\ninstrument for change. The relief requested often involves the restructuring of a state or city\nprogram, requiring the court to fashion equitable remedies 00 sometimes unique and often\n97\ncomplicated 00 in order to secure `complex legal goals.' ... We agree with Professor Chayes that, in\n97\nthe public law context, the consent decree `provides for a complex, ongoing regime of\nperformance rather than a simple, one-shot, one-way transfer.... It prolongs and deepens, rather\nthan terminates, the court's involvement with the dispute.' Chayes, The Role of the Judge in Public\nLaw Litigation, 89 Harv.L.Rev. 1281, 1298 (1976)....\nId. at 1221.\nThe above might at first glance appear to require deference to the judgment of the district court in this case as to\nthe scope of coverage of the present stipulation. However, we see a critical distinction here based on the nature\n\nof the question. The rule of broad discretion in public interest cases is designed to give the district court flexibility\nin deciding exactly how the numerous conditions of a complex consent decree are to be implemented in practice.\nIn overseeing broad institutional reform litigation, the district court becomes in many ways more like a manager or\npolicy planner than a judge. Over time, the district court gains an intimate understanding of the workings of an\ninstitution and learns what specific changes are needed within that institution in order to achieve the goals of the\nconsent decree. In Commonwealth of Massachusetts, for example, the district court needed considerable leeway\nto decide whether the Commonwealth's remedial plan for providing periodic evaluations of the patients was\nsufficiently specific. 890 F.2d at 509. In Older Americans the district court, in ruling on a contempt motion, needed\ndiscretion to decide whether a state's new policy for deciding whether to terminate AFDC benefits would suffer\nfrom the same deficiencies as the former termination policy which had given rise to the litigation. 803 F.2d at 39.\nAnd the Langton district court, also ruling on a contempt motion, required discretion to decide whether a\ntreatment center had sufficiently implemented the educational, vocational, recreational and therapeutic programs\n[16]\nrequired by a consent decree. 928 F.2d at 1211-17.\nHowever, the issue now presented differs markedly from the issues that were before the district courts in \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts, Older Americans and Langton. Here the issue is at what public institution or\n1339 institutions the *1339 Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, in agreement with plaintiffs, consented to sponsor and\nfinance sweeping remedial measures under the aegis of the federal court. The rationale for deferring to the\ndecision of a district court, that its involvement with the ongoing case makes it best able to decide issues\nconcerning institutional management and compliance, should not control an issue, like this one, which involves\n[17]\ndetermining the scope of the parties' original bargain.  If this were not so, the making of a consent decree\nwould, from the government's point of view, be a game of Russian roulette, since there could be no predicting the\ncircumstances which might lead the judge, a decade or so later, to enlarge the areas of his own control. Ordinary\ncontract principles, involving determination of the parties' intent when they entered into the stipulation, are the\nappropriate interpretative guideposts here.\nEspecially is this so given that the reach of the stipulation brings along with it the oversight jurisdiction of the\nfederal courts. Principles of federalism weigh against a rule of district court deference which could result in\nenlarging federal jurisdiction beyond the parties' original understanding. One of the contracting parties here was,\nin effect, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, which now strenuously objects to the district court's interpretation.\nEspecially where there has been no trial finding of unconstitutionality at any institution, the stipulation must limn\n[18]\nthe proper boundaries of the federal writ and must be scrupulously honored.  The Supreme Court has\nemphasized that \"although the `remedial powers of an equity court must be adequate to the task, ... they are not\nunlimited,' Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U.S. 124, 161, 91 S.Ct. 1858, 1878, 29 L.Ed.2d 363 (1971). One of the most\nimportant considerations governing the exercise of equitable power is a proper respect for the integrity and\nfunction of local government institutions.\" Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U.S. 33, 110 S.Ct. 1651, 1663, 109 L.Ed.2d 31\n(1990). In enforcing a consent decree, a district court must remain \"aware of ... the need to strike a proper\nbalance between the integrity of the Consent Decree and the principles of federalism.\" Duran v. Elrod, 713 F.2d\n292, 297 (7th Cir.),cert. denied,465 U.S. 1108, 104 S.Ct. 1615, 80 L.Ed.2d 143 (1983). Here, our concern for\nprinciples of federalism is at its highest because we are dealing not with the details of implementing a clearly\napplicable consent decree, but with the question of whether the consenting parties, including officials of the\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico, ever understood that the relief set out would apply at another, unmentioned\ninstitution. The issue is not, as in other cases, whether the defendants have conceded to the court authority to\nimplement a particular policy in an institution already surrendered to the general authority of the court. Rather, the\n1340 issue concerns a much greater threat to the Commonwealth's sovereignty, whether it has *1340 voluntarily\nsurrendered to the federal court its authority over the institution at all.\nWe conclude that the question of the district court's power over Guerrero is an issue to be decided under ordinary\ncontract rules. Appellate review of contract interpretation is ordinarily plenary, Fashion House, Inc. v. K Mart\nCorp., 892 F.2d 1076, 1083 (1st Cir.1981). We, therefore, proceed carefully to scrutinize the stipulation and the\nactions of the parties to determine whether the stipulation applies at Guerrero.\n\nB. What the Stipulation Originally Provided\nThe stipulation defines the term \"institution\" as \"[t]he Commonwealth of Puerto Rico Psychiatric Hospital as\npresently constituted or in Decentralized form\" and then goes on to specify 86 conditions that must be met at the\n\"institution.\" The question is whether this definition of the term \"institution\" includes Guerrero.\nIt is clear that neither in 1977 nor at any later time was Guerrero the \"... Hospital as presently constituted.\" Can it\nbe viewed as having become the \"... Hospital ... in Decentralized form?\"\nThe plaintiffs suggest that when the definition of \"institution\" was drafted in 1977, the parties had in mind the\n\"decentralizing\" of Rio Piedras Hospital by transferring some of its emergency and other outpatient services to\nother facilities, placing some of its existing patients elsewhere, and diverting others who might become new\npatients. Plaintiffs go on to urge that such actions would cause the Hospital in \"decentralized form\" to become,\nbesides Rio Piedras itself, any and all pre- and post-Hospital facilities within Puerto Rico serving or receiving\npatients who would formerly have been served by the Hospital or might have stayed there. Thus, Guerrero, which\nparticularly (but by no means exclusively) came to serve a \"post-Hospital\" or \"transitional\" function, thereby\nrelieving demands on Rio Piedras, is said to have become, functionally, a \"decentralized form\" of Rio Piedras\n[19]\nPsychiatric Hospital, and hence subject to all the relief imposed by the stipulation upon that institution.\nWe have fundamental difficulty with this reasoning. First, we do not think that a distant mental health facility,\ndistinct from the Hospital, and with no administrative connection therewith, would normally be considered the \"...\nHospital ... in Decentralized form.\" There is no evidence of any special relationship between the Hospital and\nGuerrero other than an arrangement, tendered initially by defendants and now enforced by the court, that it would\nprovide 144 places to accommodate Hospital overflow. If the mere receipt of patients from the Hospital, or\notherwise destined for the Hospital, is sufficient to transform an institution into \"[t]he Commonwealth of Puerto\nRico Psychiatric Hospital ... in Decentralized form,\" then every other public facility receiving one or more such\npatients becomes theoretically subject to the 86 reform standards set out in the stipulation, or, at least, to a visit\nfrom the Master to determine how much of the stipulation it is possible to apply there. Such a construction would\n1341 cause the tail to wag *1341 the dog. As we discuss below, most of the stipulation was drafted rather obviously for\napplication at the Hospital. Any such construction as we have mentioned would result in placing the federal court\nin essentially standardless control of many of the mental health institutions around Puerto Rico, simply because\n[20]\nof the presence there of one or more former Rio Piedras patients.\nA further reason to doubt this unnatural reading of the stipulation is that it far exceeds the relief sought by the\nplaintiffs in their complaint. The chief evidence of what plaintiffs were seeking when they agreed to the stipulation\nlies in the complaint, in which plaintiffs outlined the relief sought in their lawsuit. The complaint speaks of\novercrowding, understaffing, poor living conditions, and inadequate care and treatment of patients at \"the\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico Psychiatric Hospital\" (i.e., what we also call the \"Hospital\" or \"Rio Piedras\"). In its\nprayers, the complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief at (specifically and repeatedly) the Psychiatric\nHospital alone. Far from mentioning the treatment of patients outside the Hospital, or the treatment of removed\nHospital patients at other places, it seeks an injunction against further admission of patients to the Psychiatric\nHospital until conditions there are improved. There is no reference whatever to decentralized facilities or\ndecentralization in the complaint. The complaint makes clear that the sole object of the lawsuit is to improve\nconditions at the Psychiatric Hospital. It seems reasonable, therefore, to assume that this, too, was the object of\nthe stipulation entered into by way of settlement of that suit. If so, we think the term \"... Hospital ... in\nDecentralized form\" deserves a less ambitious reading than is now urged. The parties might simply have meant a\nreconstituted Hospital composed of separate administratively linked components. Or they may have thought that\nseveral quasi-independent facilities would operate bearing the original name of the Psychiatric Hospital. The fact\nis, no one knows. Lacking any further explanation of what was meant, we do not believe that this curious and\ntotally unclear terminology can now bear the burden of including facilities around Puerto Rico whose only link with\nthe Hospital is the receipt or diversion of some of its former or would-be patients.\n\nThe substantive provisions of the stipulation likewise offer little support for the proposition that it was meant to\napply beyond the Hospital proper. To the contrary, the stipulation bears overwhelming evidence that the\n1342 standards therein were drafted to apply at the Hospital 00 understandably, since conditions at the Hospital *1342\n97\nwere the sole target of plaintiffs' complaint.\nFirst, several of the stipulation's provisions equate the \"institution\" 00 the entity to which the stipulation applies 00\n97 97\nwith Rio Piedras. In section \"B-III\", describing habilitation plans, the stipulation states that\nThe Mental Health Centers which refer patients to the San Juan Psychiatric Hospital shall make a\npreliminary evaluation of the mental condition of such patient. Each patient who is referred to the \ninstitution must be preliminarily evaluated by the Emergency Room Physician prior to admission to\ndetermine whether he should be admitted.\nIn this passage the parties appear to have used \"San Juan Psychiatric Hospital\" and \"institution\" interchangeably.\nIf the term \"institution\" were not synonymous with Rio Piedras, then these two sentences would refer to two\ndifferent entities, which, in context, would not make sense.\nLikewise, Section \"B-IV\" contains a detailed description of the Rio Piedras facility, discussing the number of\nwards there and the number of patients, showers and toilets in each ward. It then goes on to state that \"[u]ntil\nsuch time as the physical facilities at the institution can be habilitated to provide in each ward multi-resident\nrooms of no more than 10 patients, and one toilet, lavatory, and shower for every 10 patients, the following\nphysical improvements shall be provided....\" (emphasis added). By following the description of deficiencies at Rio\nPiedras with a specific proposal for improving conditions at the \"institution,\" this paragraph, like that discussed\nabove, equates the term \"institution\" with the Rio Piedras Hospital alone.\nNot only does the stipulation equate the \"institution\" with Rio Piedras in two places, several of its substantive\nprovisions underscore the intention to apply to Rio Piedras. For example, as noted above, the stipulation contains\na detailed description of the existing physical facilities at Rio Piedras immediately preceding the list of physical\nstandards to be observed prospectively. This indicates that the physical standards (and, by implication, the rest of\nthe standards) were thought of as applying to Rio Piedras. Even assuming the standards are general enough to\napply to any facility, the drafter would not likely have preceded these general standards with a detailed\ndescription of Rio Piedras if he had intended the standards to apply anywhere but at Rio Piedras. Moreover, this\nphysical description of Rio Piedras cannot be viewed as some sort of boilerplate language merely intended to\nintroduce a set of general physical standards. The stipulation is divided into two overall parts, part \"A,\" containing\nan introductory description of conditions then existing at Rio Piedras, and part \"B,\" containing a list of standards\nto be observed in the future. Thus, if the physical description of Rio Piedras were merely boilerplate, one would\nexpect it to appear somewhere in part \"A,\" not immediately preceding the operative physical standards in part\n\"B.\"\nAnother part of Section \"B-IV\" makes specific reference to two other facilities, Cayey and Bayamón, mandating\nthat 200 patients be moved from Rio Piedras to those named facilities. Yet the stipulation does not state that its\nstandards are to apply to those facilities. If it were the intent of the parties that Cayey and Bayamón be regarded\nas part of a decentralized Río Piedras, and hence subject to the stipulation, surely a draftsman would have made\nthis point more clearly than by the single use of the term \"decentralized form\" in the definitional section. Indeed,\nthis would have been the logical place in the agreement to clarify the requirements applicable to an institution\nsuch as Guerrero. The total lack of mention of this concept in reference to Cayey and Bayamón seriously\nundercuts the plaintiffs' current arguments on this score.\nIn addition to these particular provisions, the entire structure of the stipulation indicates that it is aimed specifically\nat the Rio Piedras Hospital. The stipulation is divided by two headings: \"A. FACT SITUATION\" and \"B. \nSTANDARDS TO BE OBSERVED AT THEPSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALAND TIME SCHEDULE FOR\n1343 COMPLIANCE\" (boldface added). The definition *1343 of \"institution\" and the entire list of standards are\ncontained under heading \"B,\" whose title indicates that the definition and standards are to apply only to the\n\"Psychiatric Hospital,\" i.e., Rio Piedras. As one of two organizational headings, and the heading which preceded\nall of the specific stipulations, heading \"B\" was a fairly important piece of language. If the drafter had been\n\nconcentrating on producing a document designed to cover other facilities, he would likely have used a term such\nas \"Standards to be Observed at all Covered Facilities,\" or something to that effect. That the stipulations begin\nwith the term \"Standards to be Observed at the Psychiatric Hospital ...\" indicates that the drafter was concerned\nwith the existing Rio Piedras facility or, at least, some later aggregate of facilities constituting a recognizable\nsuccessor to the current Hospital.\nWe conclude, therefore, that the stipulation, as drafted, did not encompass Guerrero. While Guerrero and many\nother institutions have taken overflow from the Hospital, they have not, in any meaningful sense, become its\noperational components. They are not now the \"Commonwealth of Puerto Rico Psychiatric Hospital ... in\nDecentralized form.\" This is not to question the right of the court to require the Commonwealth to accept Hospital\npatients at other facilities, as part of the necessary plan to bring the Hospital in conformity with the stipulation. A\ndistrict court has extensive equitable powers to enforce stipulated goals. But neither the stipulation nor the court's\nauthority extends to the conditions at such places in the absence of further agreement or another lawsuit\nestablishing the existence of unconstitutional conditions at these separate institutions. State officials entering into\na consent decree are entitled to rely on courts to apply the decree only to its agreed objects. Consent decrees\nare not like the camel's proverbial nose in the tent, which, once inserted, gives the animal free rein to come and\ngo at will. The improvement of mental health facilities will not be advanced by giving state officials reason to\navoid entering into such arrangements in the future for fear they will be expanded beyond their language.\nC. Construction of the Stipulation in Light of the Parties' Actions\nHaving decided that the stipulated agreement as drafted in 1977 did not, by its terms, apply to Guerrero, we next\nconsider whether it now applies to Guerrero because of the actions taken by the parties to implement the\nagreement. An argument that the actions of the parties make the stipulation applicable to Guerrero may be\nconstructed in a number of different ways. First, in the view of the district court, the defendants' actions gave rise\nto an equitable estoppel, so that they were estopped to deny that the stipulations applied to Guerrero. Second,\nthe district court also held that \"norms of judicial responsibility\" dictated the same result, which might be thought\nof as an application of the doctrine of judicial estoppel. See United States v. Levasseur, 846 F.2d 786, 792 (1st\nCir.1988). Third, our dissenting colleague argues that the defendants' actions may be used as extrinsic evidence\nto indicate that the defendants, in drafting the original agreement, intended that it would apply to facilities such as\n[21]\nGuerrero.\nAll three of these arguments hinge upon the proposition that the defendants, through their actions, have\nrepresented that the stipulations would apply to Guerrero. Equitable estoppel contains a representation element, \n1344 see Phelps v. Federal*1344Emergency Management Agency, 785 F.2d 13 (1st Cir.1986). Judicial estoppel\nrequires inconsistency between a position taken earlier before a court and a later one (the earlier position here\nwould be the defendants' purported representation that the agreement applied to Guerrero). See generally \nLevasseur, 846 F.2d at 792. The extrinsic evidence argument supposes that the defendants revealed their actual\nintent at the time they entered into the stipulation through subsequent conduct in carrying it out. We reject all\nthree approaches because we do not construe the defendants' subsequent actions as clearly representing that\nthe stipulations applied at Guerrero.\nTo be sure, the defendants have taken numerous actions aimed at using the Guerrero facility, as well as others,\nto help alleviate overcrowded conditions at Rio Piedras. They have done so at the court's urging, and, as we\nhave said, we believe the court properly exerted pressure upon defendants to provide facilities to reduce\novercrowding at the Hospital. See Inmates of Suffolk County Jail v. Eisenstadt, 494 F.2d 1196 (1st Cir.1974). The\nmere transfer of patients to Guerrero and elsewhere, however, did not constitute a representation by defendants\nthat they agreed to operate Guerrero in conformity with the 86 conditions set forth in the stipulation. Nor did\ndefendants' suggestions that the quality of care provided at these places would be high amount to any such\nrepresentation.\nPlaintiffs contend that before the adoption of Plan 3, defendants did not object to, and supposedly by their silence\nacquiesced in, certain statements by the Master relating to the need for improvements at institutions other than\n[22]\nRío Piedras.  Then, in 1987 the defendants submitted Plan 3, which called for the transfer of some patients at\n\nRío Piedras to Guerrero and other facilities. These and similar actions undoubtedly evidenced a willingness on\nthe part of the defendants to use Guerrero to help relieve pressures on Río Piedras. But they fell far short of\nrepresenting agreement that the terms of the stipulation applied henceforth at Guerrero.\nIt is true that after submitting Plan 3, the defendants, on August 5, 1987, submitted \"exceptions and\ncommentaries\" to the Master's fourth report, parts of which may be read as assuming the stipulations will apply\nbeyond Río Piedras. The exceptions and commentaries state that\nSaid plan [Plan 3] includes a description of the Mental Health Program of the Commonwealth of\nPuerto Rico to illustrate this Honorable Court and the Master as to the scope of the program. The\nPsychiatric Hospital of Rio Piedras is only a part of said program and is the institution under the\nstipulations before this Honorable Court, with whatever facilities may be used to descentralize [sic]\nthe care of said hospital's patients. As before stated the individuals that come in contact with the\nprimary units of the mental health program are not patients of the Psychiatric Hospital and most of\nthe time do not become so. The class in the present action is composed of the patients of the\nPsychiatric Hospital and the institutions wherever they may be referred to in a descentralization\n[sic] program. Defendants respectfully reiterate their request to maintain the scope of the class in\nthe above captioned case and the stipulations agreed on by admitting from Plan # 3 those\nportions that apply to the Psychiatric Hospital.\nWe find it difficult to discern any precise meaning from this language. Even if the reference to \"whatever facilities\nmay be used to descentralize [sic] the care of said hospital's patients\" may be viewed as acknowledging that\nGuerrero is \"under\" the stipulations, that language is contradicted by the apparent attempt to limit the court's\nauthority to Rio Piedras by asking it to \"admit [] from Plan # 3 those portions that apply to the psychiatric\n1345 hospital.\" Moreover, throughout the course of this litigation, *1345 the defendants' \"exceptions and\ncommentaries\" have been treated as an objection to the court's \"jurisdiction\" over Guerrero. The district court\nresponded to the motion by issuing an order referring to the defendants \"objection\" to the scope of its\n\"jurisdiction\" and attempting to clarify that jurisdiction. Moreover, the district court's December 28, 1989 order\nstates that its August 10, 1987 order was necessary \"because defendants' ... motion, taking exceptions to the\nMaster's fourth report, requested the court to restrict the scope of the stipulations to the physical premises of the\nhospital and to the patients residing there.\" We therefore decline to treat this motion as a representation by the\ndefendants that the stipulation would apply to Guerrero.\nNor can the defendants' failure to appeal from the court's August 10, 1987 opinion and order, issued in response\nto the \"exceptions and commentaries,\" be treated as such a representation. The court stated in that opinion and\norder that it intended to see that patients transferred to Guerrero received treatment consistent with the\nstipulation. Defendants' failure to appeal from this order did not, however evidence acquiescence that the\n[23]\nstipulation applied at Guerrero.  The August 10 order did not require the defendants to do anything other than\nwhat they had been doing all along 00 use Guerrero to house patients transferred from Rio Piedras. The order\n97\nrequired defendants to set aside 144 beds in Guerrero for former Rio Piedras patients, submit certain budgetary\ninformation and take several specific actions at Rio Piedras. Compliance with these directives said nothing about\ndefendants' willingness to conform the internal management of Guerrero with the stipulation. It was not until\nDecember 28, 1989 that the court issued an order requiring defendants to take a particular action with regard to\ntheir internal management of Guerrero in supposed compliance with the terms of the stipulation. When the court\nissued this order, defendants promptly objected, resulting in the present appeal.\nFinally, like their previous actions, the defendants' participation in the \"tripartite visits\" and the \"interdisciplinary\nvisits\" to Guerrero and their submission of a report on the status of patients transferred to Guerrero cannot be\nconstrued as tantamount to a representation that the stipulation applied to Guerrero. In the words of the Master,\nthe \"tripartite visits\" were undertaken for the limited purpose of \"evaluat[ing] if transferred patients were better off\nthan if they had remained in the hospital.\" An agreement to determine whether the patients were better off in\nGuerrero does not evidence an agreement that their treatment was regulated by the 86 stipulations. Indeed,\nwhen the \"interdisciplinary group\" reported that patients transferred from Rio Piedras to Guerrero were receiving\n1346 inadequate rehabilitative care, the defendants, *1346 in a letter of September 6, 1989, raised their objections to\n\nthe decree's application to Guerrero. This letter began the series of motions and court orders which culminated in\nthe court's opinion and order of March 6, 1990, now on appeal.\nWe do not find, therefore, that defendants ever acknowledged that the remedial requirements of the stipulation\nwere applicable at Guerrero. Instead, defendants' actions seem simply to have reflected the view that they were\nobligated to improve Río Piedras by reducing overcrowding there, and should do so in a generally cooperative\n[24]\nand progressive manner.  The Master noted in 1987 that the current administration (which took office in 1985)\nhad considerably increased the Puerto Rican mental health budget and that, for the first time, a genuine mental\nhealth system was taking shape in Puerto Rico. The district court's order of March 6, 1990 (affirming its\nDecember 28, 1989 order) went far beyond any previous order. For the first time, the district court, instead of\nordering the defendants to move patients from Río Piedras to Guerrero or to determine whether such patients\nwere better off at Guerrero, has ordered defendants to operate Guerrero's rehabilitation program under its\nsupervision. The court, moreover, made clear that it was asserting full jurisdiction over conditions at Guerrero. To\nhold that the defendants are now bound to run the Guerrero facility under court supervision merely because they\nearlier made improvements there and accepted patients from Rio Piedras would be to punish them for their\n[25]\ncooperation.\nThus, while we believe that the district judge and the court-appointed Master have done an outstanding job\nperforming the role of policy planners and managers to see that the complex legal goals inherently part of this\nlitigation come about, a direct intervention to regulate the operation of the Guerrero facility was neither included in\nthe terms of the stipulation nor made appropriate by the subsequent endorsement of the parties. As such\nintervention is not authorized, it must terminate.\nIn so holding, we do not deny that the district court has broad remedial powers to effectuate the provisions of the\nstipulation. See generally Morgan v. McDonough, 548 F.2d 28, 31 (1st Cir.1977) (district court's \"equity power is\nbroad and flexible and the propriety of an order turns on a balancing of individual and collective interests in the\nparticular case\"). For example, if former members of the plaintiff class now resident at Guerrero still lack the\nindividual habilitation plans required by Section B-III(8)(c) of the stipulation because such plans were denied\nthem when they were patients at the Hospital, the court even now could act to correct and remedy that earlier\nviolation of the stipulation by ordering that the omitted plans be provided. In so doing, the court could not oversee\n1347 current care and treatment at Guerrero, but would be entitled to order the patient *1347 to be given the individual\nevaluation and diagnosis that he or she should have been given while still at the Hospital. And, as previously\nnoted, the court may direct that outside facilities be used temporarily or permanently to house patients and/or to\noffer services not provided by the Hospital if this is the only way to ensure compliance at the Hospital itself with\nthe stipulation. However, the district court may not, as a general matter, regulate the rehabilitation programs\noffered at Guerrero, or require that institution to comply generally with the stipulated agreement. An ongoing\noversight of the rehabilitation services or other treatment received by former Río Piedras patients at Guerrero is\noutside both the terms of the stipulation and any general remedial power that can be implied therefrom. To the\nextent inmates of institutions other than the Hospital (whether or not formerly patients at Río Piedras) believe that\nthey are now being forced to endure unconstitutional conditions, they must bring another lawsuit making such\nallegations and seeking relief appropriate in their situation.\nCONCLUSION\nTo summarize, we find, first, that this suit is properly a class action. Second, we hold that the district court may\n[26]\nnot impose the terms of the stipulation on, or regulate, the Guerrero facility.\nThe opinion and order of March 6, 1990 is affirmed in part and reversed in part. Orders of the district court\ninconsistent with this opinion are vacated, and the case shall proceed in the district court in a manner consistent\nwith this opinion.\nCYR, Circuit Judge (concurring, in part; dissenting, in part).\n\nI concur in Part I of the opinion, but respectfully dissent from the conclusion reached in Part II. The majority\nopinion concludes that the consent decree definition of \"institution\" is too vague or ambiguous to permit the\ninterpretation given it by the district court. The majority seems most concerned that appropriate respect for the\nintegrity of Commonwealth governmental institutions and the principles of federalism would be disserved by the\ndistrict court's interpretation of its jurisdiction under the consent decree. Although federalism concerns and the\nintegrity of Commonwealth governmental institutions merit earnest consideration, the threat perceived by the\nmajority is exaggerated.\n[27]\nThe district court, plainly mindful of the attendant implications,  fairly interpreted the negotiated consent\ndecree, employing entirely appropriate interpretive standards, and reasonably concluded that the language of the\ndecree and the long-term course of performance by the parties evince an intention on the part of the\nCommonwealth to undertake a broad-based legal obligation from which it never dissented until the district court\nproceedings were about to be closed. The language of the consent decree, and the well-informed findings of the\ndistrict court regarding the parties' post-decree course of compliance with the decree, demonstrate that the\nCommonwealth intended, at the time the decree was approved in 1977, to submit to the jurisdiction of the United\nStates District Court all collateral mental health facilities involved in the contemplated decentralization of mental\nhealth services previously provided at Rio Piedras. The majority's analysis, on the other hand, seems rooted in its\nconcern that the district court may have loosed itself from the jurisdictional constraints imposed by the language\nof the consent decree, armed with its own charter to regulate all public mental health facilities and patients in the\nCommonwealth. While there can be no doubt that such an arrogation of power would warrant firm remediation,\n1348 neither the district court *1348 nor the plaintiffs have interpreted the consent decree to confer any such unlimited\nor ambiguous jurisdictional license as the majority suggests.\nThe majority proceeds on the doubtful assumption that the decentralization provision operated ab initio as an\n[28]\nunmitigated burden on the Commonwealth.  On the contrary, the Commonwealth gained the benefits of\nflexibility, affording it the option either to upgrade facilities at Rio Piedras to accommodate its initial patient\npopulation, or to convert Rio Piedras to a downscaled facility through periodic patient transfers to alternate sites\nof its own choosing. Under the majority's view, the Commonwealth would have been faced with a new lawsuit,\nwith all its attendant litigational burdens, as to each different collateral facility to which a member of the plaintiff\nclass was transferred. The consent decree, on the other hand, contemplated from its inception that certain as-yet \nunidentifiable patient services then being provided at the overcrowded Rio Piedras facility might no longer be\noffered at those premises by the time the litigation was brought to a conclusion. At the present time, Rio Piedras\napparently is in compliance with the stipulations in the consent decree. Compliance was achieved, however, as\nunderstood and agreed by all concerned, only through the transfer of numerous former Rio Piedras patients to\nvarious collateral support facilities, such as the 144-bed module at Guerrero 00 the facility at issue on appeal.\n97\nFurthermore, no other Puerto Rico mental health facility will be brought under the jurisdiction of the court in the\nfuture. Rio Piedras and its support facilities now constitute the fixed-size, decentralized form of the Hospital, and\nthe plaintiff class includes only present and future residents of the \"institution\" as it is presently composed. As the\ndistrict court itself noted, \"persons treated in their community mental health centers who have never been\npatients of the Hospital, do not fall under the court's jurisdiction.\"\nUnder the explicit language of the consent decree, the plaintiff class is comprised of present and future\n\"residents\" of the \"institution.\" The jurisdiction of the district court consequently extended to Rio Piedras and all\ncollateral facilities utilized to depopulate and decentralize Rio Piedras in order to bring it into compliance with the\nminimum physical standards prescribed by the consent decree. The restrictive interpretation advanced by the\nmajority is dependent entirely on the unrealistic assumption that a significant subset of the plaintiff class, namely\nall patients transferred from Rio Piedras, accepted a consent decree requiring improvements at Rio Piedras but\nimposing no obligation on the Commonwealth regarding the quality of care available at the collateral facilities to\nwhich those same patients were to be transferred. Viewed in its litigation context, I believe that the consent\ndecree requires the interpretation given it by the district court and that the interpretation adopted by the majority\nis unwarranted by either the language of the decree, the extended course of compliance and superintendence\nunder the decree, or the nature and aims of the class action.\n\nI. Plain Language of Consent Decree\nAlthough federalism concerns offer an arguable basis for de novo appellate review of the jurisdictional reach of a\n1349 consent decree governing public institutional reform litigation,[29] the majority's plenary *1349 scanning of the\nplain language of the consent decree substitutes appellate interpretation of the stipulations of the parties for the\ninterpretation of the superintending court, unconstrained even by the \"ordinary contract principles\" alluded to by\nthe majority.\nThe proper interpretation of a consent decree basically presents a question of law, as does the preliminary\ndetermination whether the disputed language is ambiguous. See AMF, Inc. v. Jewett, 711 F.2d 1096, 1100-01\n(1st Cir.1983); Massachusetts Ass'n for Retarded Citizens, Inc. v. King, 668 F.2d 602, 607 (1st Cir.1981) (citing \nUnited States v. ITT Continental Baking Co., 420 U.S. 223, 238, 95 S.Ct. 926, 935, 43 L.Ed.2d 148 (1975)); see\nalso Fashion House, Inc. v. K Mart Corp., 892 F.2d 1076, 1083 (1st Cir.1989). The majority suggests that the\nterms \"institution\" and \"Rio Piedras Hospital\" were used interchangeably and synonymously throughout the\ndecree, and that perhaps the definition of \"institution\" 00 as consisting of the \"Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\n97\nPsychiatric Hospital as presently constituted or in Decentralized form\" 00 was included merely to ensure that an\n97\ninternally-restructured facility at Rio Piedras, or any other mental health facilities subsequently placed under the \ndirect administrative control of the Rio Piedras Hospital, would be covered by the terms of the decree.\nThe massive overcrowding at the Rio Piedras facility in 1977 manifested to all the parties that the system of care\nprovided at Rio Piedras in 1977 might well be \"decentralized\" over time. Yet the parties could not then know, with\nany precision, which or how many collateral mental health facilities would be needed to accommodate the\n[30]\npatients who would have to be transferred from Rio Piedras.  Plaintiffs contend that the definition of\n\"institution\" incorporated in the decree was deliberately phrased in broad terms because the parties needed to\nmake express allowance for future contingencies as to what form the systemic \"institution\" ultimately would take.\nSuch inherent flexibility is one of the major advantages of utilizing consent decrees in public institutional reform\nlitigation. Thus, even assuming that we are to confine ourselves to a \"four corners\" interpretation of the decree,\nas advocated by the majority, I cannot agree that the majority has demonstrated that its interpretations of\n\"institution\" and \"decentralized form\" are permissible in light of the explicit language of the consent decree.\nFirst, the majority converts the pivotal definition of \"institution\" into virtual surplusage by suggesting two\nimplausible reasons for its inclusion in the consent decree. Because the particular array of services provided at\nthe Rio Piedras facility was almost certain to change during the course of the Commonwealth's compliance, the\nmajority posits the theory that the parties included the definition of \"institution\" only to ensure that the stipulations\nin the decree would continue to apply to this internally-restructured facility. We should be very reluctant to\nconclude that prominent language in a decree, which has received the imprimatur of the parties and the\nsuperintending court, is superfluous and without legal import. See, e.g., Systemized of New England, Inc. v.\nSCM, Inc., 732 F.2d 1030, 1034 (1st Cir.1984); J.E. Faltin Motor Transp., Inc. v. Eazor Express, Inc., 273 F.2d\n444, 445 (3d Cir.1960). The majority fails to explain why, if the Rio Piedras facility were to remain an intact entity\n1350 at its original location, the simple phrase \"Rio *1350 Piedras Hospital\" would not have sufficed to ensure the\napplication of the stipulations to the restructured facility. Under the majority's interpretation, any further\nelaboration of the term \"institution\" would have been superfluous.\nThe majority next suggests that the parties may have included the definition of \"institution\" to encompass any\nnew branches of the Rio Piedras facility opened by the Commonwealth at other locations throughout Puerto Rico\nand placed under the same administrative control as Rio Piedras. See supra at n. 4. The suggested interpretation\nis totally at odds with the underlying goal of the litigation and the consent decree, which was to fix the obligations\nof the Commonwealth to all members of the plaintiff class. We cannot plausibly suppose that the parties would\nhave had any reason to insert in the decree a prominent provision whose only purpose would be to govern the\nCommonwealth's unilateral decision to \"reshuffle\" the organization within its Department of Health. After all, the\nCommonwealth ultimately controls all public mental health facilities in Puerto Rico, regardless of the number of\ndiscrete administrative units into which it might choose to parcel its mental health program. Given that reality, the\nmajority fails to explain how such administrative reshuffling would even be material to the resolution of the\n\nproblems to be addressed by the present litigation. By emphasizing the bureaucratic form of the Hospital, rather\nthan the substantive goals of the litigation and the consent decree as a whole, the majority interpretation renders\nthe Commonwealth's obligation totally illusory. See, e.g., Shakey's Inc. v. Covalt, 704 F.2d 426, 434 (9th Cir.1983)\n(preference given to contract interpretation that does not render obligations illusory). According to the majority\nview, the Commonwealth would be free at any time to redefine its obligations under the consent decree, \nartificially, by placing various facilities under the nominal control of an administrative unit of the Department of\nHealth separate from the Rio Piedras facility. Furthermore, under the majority's thesis, the Commonwealth would\nhave been permitted to effect a unilateral shutdown of the entire Rio Piedras facility, transferring all its patients to\nother facilities, without any further obligation to former Rio Piedras patients. I believe it inappropriate to trivialize a\njudicial decree in this manner, particularly a consent decree.\nSecond, the majority emphasizes that the decree specifically describes physical conditions at the Rio Piedras\nfacility, while omitting any description of the physical conditions at other facilities mentioned in the decree, such\nas the mental health programs at Cayey and Bayamon. The majority proposes to interpret the absence of such\ndescriptions as an indication that the stipulations in the consent decree were not meant to apply to any facility\nother than Rio Piedras.\nThe significance of the asserted \"omission\" must be viewed in conjunction with the broad definition of \"institution\"\nset out earlier in the consent decree. It is a common drafting technique (expressio unius est exclusio alterius) to\nomit specific examples (Cayey and Bayamon) where their inclusion might imply that the specific examples\ncompletely exhaust the scope of a broader category previously defined. See generally 2A Norman J. Singer, \nSutherland Statutory Construction §§ 47.23, 47.24 n. 6, at 194, 203, 205 (4th ed. 1984) (discussion of exclusio\ndoctrine in interpreting statutes and contracts). The inclusion of a specific description of the physical conditions at\nCayey and Bayamon might well have been considered a reasonable basis for inferring that Cayey and Bayamon\ncomprised the entire fixed \"decentralized form\" of the Hospital, and that no other collateral facilities, such as\nGuerrero, could have been considered part of the \"institution\" in the future. Thus, the \"omission\" relied on as\nsupport for the narrower interpretation advanced by the majority provides persuasive support for the\ninterpretation given by the district court.\nFurthermore, as previously noted, the particular physical conditions at Cayey and Bayamon were not the primary\n1351 or immediate focus of the consent decree. The decree requires that the Rio Piedras facility *1351 be brought into\ncompliance with the stipulations in the decree. At such time as the Commonwealth were to achieve compliance at\nthe Rio Piedras facility, the court would be required to determine that the collateral support facilities to which Rio\nPiedras patients had been transferred in order to achieve compliance at Rio Piedras were also in compliance with\nthe minimum standards stipulated in the consent decree. Conceivably, the Cayey and Bayamon facilities might\nnot have remained as permanent parts of the \"institution\" if, between 1977 and 1989, the Commonwealth\ndecided that the patients initially transferred to those facilities would be better placed in some other collateral\nfacility. Thus, the decree envisioned that the ultimate scope of the \"institution\" would remain open to final\ndefinition through reference to its culminating eventuality, the achievement of full compliance with the consent\ndecree by the Rio Piedras facility.\nThird, the majority suggests that the provisions of the decree relating to the internal procedures for screening the\nmedical requirements of incoming and transferring patients demonstrate that the terms \"institution\" and \"Hospital\"\nare used interchangeably by the parties. The interpretation of a pivotal provision in a consent decree should not\nbe approached under the assumption that it is the product of poor draftsmanship or an indiscriminate use of\nterms. Instead, at least when the resulting interpretation fully accords with the language and context of the\nconsent decree, it is appropriate to credit the parties with a mutual intention to use different terms to import\ndistinctive meanings. Read in context, the language cited by the majority does not equate the terms \"Hospital\"\nand \"institution.\" Rather, it is clear that the screening provision prescribes distinct requirements for intra-\ninstitutional patient transfers, namely transfers of patients between Rio Piedras and its collateral component\nfacilities, and inter-institutional patient transfers, namely transfers of patients from outside the \"institution\" into Rio\n[31]\nPiedras or one of its collateral facilities.\nFinally, the majority notes that Section B, which contains both the definition of \"institution\" and the list of\nstipulations, is prefaced by the heading \"Standards to be Observed at the Psychiatric Hospital.\" By equating the\n\nheading's reference to \"Psychiatric Hospital\" with \"Rio Piedras,\" the majority suggests that the parties would have\nused the term \"institution\" or \"covered facilities\" in the heading if they had intended to apply the stipulations to\nfacilities other than Rio Piedras, which constituted the entire psychiatric hospital at the time of the decree.\n1352 *1352 Contrary to the majority's contention, heading \"B\" refers generically to the \"Psychiatric Hospital,\" and not to\nthe \"San Juan Psychiatric Hospital,\" the term reserved elsewhere in the decree to denote the Rio Piedras facility.\nIf indicative at all, heading \"B\" merely suggests that the parties contemplated, at the time of the decree, a basic\nhospital structure different than the one then existing at Rio Piedras. Moreover, a cardinal rule of contract\ninterpretation requires that no individual provision, even a heading, be interpreted in isolation from its context\nwithin the document as a whole. See Spartan Industries v. John Pilling Shoe, 385 F.2d 495, 499 (1st Cir.1967); cf.\nUnited States v. Roemer, 514 F.2d 1377, 1380 (2d Cir.1975) (rule of statutory construction gives precedence to\ndetailed text over generalized headings). The definition of \"institution\" is the first substantive provision following\nheading \"B,\" a prominence further emphasized by the fact that the lengthy list of definitions of which it is part is\nnot arranged alphabetically. It seems almost certain that the only reasonable justification for placing the definition\nof \"institution\" in section B was to define the coverage and reach of the stipulations contained in the very same\nsection. This definition makes clear that the form of the hospital at the time of the consent decree (i.e., Rio\nPiedras) might not be determinative of the scope of the stipulations should the Hospital ultimately decentralize its\nservices.\nThe district court interpretation ascribes meaningful import to the disputed language, consistent with the overall\npurposes of the other provisions of the consent decree. The majority has not demonstrated that the decree is\nambiguous, so as to warrant an alternative interpretation of the terms \"institution\" and \"decentralized form.\"\nII. Ambiguity and Extrinsic Evidence of Intent\nAssuming, arguendo, that the disputed terms of the decree are ambiguous, however, I cannot agree that the\ndistrict court interpretation is not due considerable deference. The majority asserts that our normal deferential\nstance toward district court interpretations in public institutional reform litigation is inappropriate when the\ndisputed language in the consent decree involves the important question of jurisdiction, rather than mere modes\nof compliance with the terms of the decree. If an ambiguous decree must be interpreted as any other contract,\nhowever, the majority does not explain why the district court cannot be permitted to employ \"ordinary contract\nprinciples\" which look beyond the confines of the \"four corners\" of the contract or decree to determine the true\nintent underlying the parties' use of the disputed language. Our customary \"deference\" to the trial court in every\nother case of contract interpretation is based on the recognition that the trial court is better situated to appraise\nthe probative value of this type of extrinsic evidence. I believe that the majority opinion not only unnecessarily\nrestricts the interpretive inquiry to the \"four corners\" of the consent decree, but discards appropriate interpretive\ntools for discovering the intent of the parties as expressed in their consent decree and undervalues the district\ncourt's superior opportunity to evaluate the pertinent extrinsic evidence developed during the course of its\n[32]\nsuperintendence of public institutional reform litigation.\n1353 *1353 I cannot agree that the district court improperly relied on the parties' post-decree conduct either to \"revise\"\nretrospectively the terms of the decree or to deprive the Commonwealth of its original bargain. Concededly,\nalthough the court was at all times acutely mindful of the parties' understanding of the scope of the decree, its\n[33]\nopinion does not contain a detailed analysis of the language of the decree.  Instead, the district court chose\nnot to base its decision on the ground that the phrase \"decentralized form\" was unambiguous as a matter of law.\nAssuming some latent ambiguity, the court opted to examine extrinsic evidence to determine the intent underlying\nthe jurisdictional provisions in the consent decree.\nIn earlier cases treating the proper interpretation of an ambiguous consent decree, the Supreme Court implicitly\nconfined the proper focus to the \"four corners\" of the decree, abjuring recourse to extrinsic evidence. See United\nStates v. Armour & Co., 402 U.S. 673, 681-82, 91 S.Ct. 1752, 1757-58, 29 L.Ed.2d 256 (1971). In later caselaw,\nhowever, the Supreme Court disparaged such a narrow reading of Armour:\n\nSince a consent decree or order is to be construed for enforcement purposes basically as a\ncontract, reliance upon certain aids to construction is proper, as with any other contract. Such aids\ninclude the circumstances surrounding the formation of the consent order, any technical meaning\nwords used may have had to the parties, and any other documents expressly incorporated in the\ndecree. Such reliance does not in any way depart from the \"four corners\" rule of Armour.\nUnited States v. ITT Continental Baking Co., 420 U.S. 223, 238, 95 S.Ct. 926, 935, 43 L.Ed.2d 148 (1975)\n(emphasis added). As noted, this type of \"extrinsic evidence\" analysis does not seek to modify the terms of the\noriginal consent decree without the parties' consent. Rather, as with all other methods of contract interpretation,\nthe court may use extrinsic evidence to discover the original intent of the parties in settling upon the particular\nlanguage used in the consent decree. See, e.g., Raymond Keith Foster, Keith Foster Mfg. Co. v. Hallco Mfg. Co.,\n947 F.2d 469, 482 (Fed.Cir. 1991); United States v. O'Rourke, 943 F.2d 180, 187 (2d Cir.1991); North Shore\nLabs. Corp. v. Cohen, 721 F.2d 514, 519, 520 n. 5 (5th Cir.1983).\nUnder a well-established rule of contract interpretation, the court may look to the parties' post-contract course of\nconduct and performance to ascertain the \"practical interpretation and application\" that the parties themselves\nattached to ambiguous contract language:\nIn the process of interpretation of the terms of a contract, the court can frequently get great\nassistance from the interpreting statements made by the parties themselves or from their conduct\nin rendering or in receiving performance under it. ... The process of practical interpretation and\napplication, however, is not regarded by the parties as a remaking of the contract; nor do the\ncourts so regard it. Instead, it is merely a further expression by the parties of the meaning that\n1354 they give and have given to the terms of their contract previously made. There is no good reason \n*1354 why the courts should not give great weight to these further expressions by the parties, in\nview of the fact that they still have the same freedom of contract that they had originally. In cases\nso numerous as to be impossible of full citation here, the courts have held that evidence of\npractical interpretation and construction by the parties is admissible to aid in choosing the\nmeaning to which legal effect will be given. Oral testimony is admissible and frequently is\nabsolutely necessary, even in cases where the terms are fully \"integrated\" in writing, to\ndemonstrate the application of the terms to the property, persons, and events to which they are\nrelated. The parties may employ language the application of which they know to be uncertain and\nto which they are too indifferent at the time of executing the contract to take the trouble to make\ncertain. This does not prevent the existence of a valid contract; but it causes much greater\ndependence to be put upon their subsequent practical interpretation and construction.\n3 Arthur L. Corbin, Corbin on Contracts § 558, at 249-253 (1960) (emphasis added). Through the performance\nrendered by the parties, the court gains invaluable insight into the practical interpretation mutually intended by the\ncontract language. See, e.g., U.S.I. Properties Corp. v. M.D. Constr. Co., Inc., 860 F.2d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 1988),cert.\ndenied,490 U.S. 1065, 109 S.Ct. 2064, 104 L.Ed.2d 629 (1988).\nUnlike a simple contract action where the post-contract conduct of the parties usually must be presented to the\ncourt in the form of controverted extrinsic evidence, much relevant post-consent decree conduct in public\ninstitution reform litigation takes place before the district court in the course of its ongoing superintendence of the\nperformance required under the decree. During the required performance, the district court is uniquely positioned\nto evaluate typical modes of expression by the parties and the significance of their silence or acquiescence in the\nface of representations by the court and the conduct and representations of opposing parties. It seems most\nappropriate that district court findings based on extrinsic evidence should be reviewed for clear error only. See,\ne.g., Fox v. United States Dept. of Hous. & Urban Dev., 680 F.2d 315, 319 (3d Cir.1982) (resort to use of extrinsic\nevidence in interpretation of consent decree converts issue to one of fact). Thus, it seems particularly\ninappropriate in the present context to deny deference to the district court's interpretation of the consent decree.\nThe record provides overwhelming support for the district court findings in this case. The court found that the\nCommonwealth, by its course of compliance over a period of twelve years, indicated that it intended to accede to\n\ndistrict court jurisdiction over any support facilities needed to decentralize services previously administered on the\nRio Piedras premises. The court based its findings on several factors.\nFirst, the court noted that in several reports made prior to the Secretary of Health's submission of Plan 3, the\n[34]\nSpecial Master repeatedly emphasized \"the systemic approach to securing compliance [with the decree].\"  In\nfact, immediately prior to the submission of Plan 3, the Secretary provided the Master with budgetary information\nthat covered the entire public mental health network in Puerto Rico. The Master responded with a letter, stating\nthat\n1355 the report's budgetary information is apparently based on a misconception of*1355the scope of\nthe Court's jurisdiction. The Court's authority does not encompass the entire mental health system\nof Puerto Rico, but only the following: the Rio Piedras Psychiatric Hospital, pre-hospital facilities\nsuch as mental health centers and out-patient clinics which service patients who otherwise would\nbe treated by the Hospital, and post-hospital transitional and related services which receive the\nHospital's discharged patients.\nThus, the district court reasonably found that Plan 3 contained a commitment by the Commonwealth to\n\"deinstitutionalize\" the Hospital, which included the later transfer of patients to Guerrero.\nSecond, while the Commonwealth contends that it immediately filed a timely objection to the scope of the district\ncourt's jurisdiction as proposed by the Secretary in Plan 3, its so-called \"objection\" merely challenged the\npossible extension of the court's jurisdiction to every public mental health facility in Puerto Rico. Moreover, the \nCommonwealth's own exception continued to treat the \"institution\" as including both Rio Piedras and its support\n[35]\nfacilities.  Unquestionably, the district court appropriately treated the Commonwealth's \"objection\" as strong\nextrinsic evidence that the Commonwealth itself intended that the consent decree cover Rio Piedras and\nwhatever facilities were used to decentralize the care of Rio Piedras patients.\nThird, when the district court finally entered its order incorporating Plan 3, thereby defining its jurisdiction to\ninclude Rio Piedras' support facilities generally and Guerrero specifically, the Commonwealth neither objected\nnor appealed. This telltale silence on the part of the Commonwealth further reinforced the district court's reading\nof the Commonwealth \"objection\" to Plan 3 as an objection to any extension of jurisdiction to all mental health\nfacilities in the Commonwealth, and not as a challenge to district court jurisdiction over Rio Piedras and its\n[36]\ndecentralized support system.\n1356 *1356 Finally, the district court noted that the Commonwealth continued to allow tripartite evaluation visits to\nthese transitional facilities after 1987, clearly indicating that the physical conditions at these facilities would be\n[37]\nmaterial to the issue of full Commonwealth compliance with the consent decree.  The majority dismisses these\ntripartite visits by concluding that they were \"undertaken for the limited purpose of `evaluat[ing] if transferred\npatients were better off than if they remained in the hospital.'\" (emphasis added). Assuming, arguendo, that the\ndistrict court possessed only the very limited authority to compel transfers out of Rio Piedras solely to ensure\ncompliance with the stipulations at Rio Piedras, the majority offers no explanation for the Commonwealth's\nacquiescence to any such comparative study of conditions at the collateral facilities. The only conceivable\npurpose to be served by such a comparative study would have been to ensure that the minimum conditions\nprescribed in the stipulations were being applied throughout the \"institution.\"\nSince the case simply has not been made that the district court's findings are clearly erroneous, and its findings\ncomport with a reasonable interpretation of \"decentralized form,\" I believe we are required to defer to the district\ncourt's \"intimate understanding of the history and circumstances of the litigation,\" United States v. Commonwealth\nof Massachusetts, 890 F.2d 507, 510 (1st Cir.1989), especially in a case where there can be no doubt that the\ndistrict court engaged in a sensitive analysis of the principles of federalism implicated by its decision. Therefore,\nalthough I concur in Part I of the majority opinion, I must respectfully dissent from Part II.\n[1] Rafael Hernández Colón was governor at the time this suit commenced in 1974, but was replaced by\nGovernor Carlos Romero Barceló in 1977. Governor Romero's tenure lasted until January of 1985 when a new\nadministration led again by Governor Rafael Hernández Colón replaced him.\n\n[2] Eight hundred and ninety patients a month and an average of 10,704 a year would be treated at the Hospital,\nincluding PIC, Emergency Ward and Triage patients.\n[3] Defendants represent that, as a result of the successful operation of this plan, there is currently no\novercrowding in the Río Piedras Psychiatric Hospital, that all the patients there have individual treatment plans,\nand that an adequate staffing pattern has been implemented. These criteria, according to the Master's own\nstatements in his fourth preliminary report, are the most significant ones for determining compliance. Plaintiffs do\nnot appear to deny that conditions at the Hospital are largely, if not entirely, in compliance with the stipulation.\nWhether or not this is so is a matter for the district court, subject to the rulings herein.\n[4] The basis for the Master's statement that the Hospital had \"direct relationship\" with Guerrero appears to be\nonly that the Assistant Secretary for Mental Health had decided to set aside Module 7 of Guerrero, with 144 beds,\nfor former Río Piedras patients. The Master did not find that there was any direct administrative connection\nbetween the two facilities nor did he find any other relationship between them, apart from this reservation of beds\nin Guerrero.\n[5] It appears that 383 was the total number of patients transferred from Río Piedras to other facilities, and that\nthe 144 transferred to Guerrero were included in this total.\n[6] The Commonwealth's basis for this motion was the Master's judgment, expressed in his fifth report, that \"with\nthe pace and degree of the deinstitutionalization process only one conclusion is possible: as of November 13\n[1987], the Secretary had more than fulfilled the commitments of Plan 3.\"\n[7] Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) reads \nA motion to alter or amend the judgement shall be served no later than 10 days after entry of the judgment.\n[8] In April of 1990, after the defendants had filed the notice of appeal before this court, the district court\nrequested that this court remand the issue of sanctions as it appeared from the record filed by the defendants.\nWe remanded and on April 26, 1990 a hearing was held before the district court for reconsideration of the Rule\n11 sanctions. In an order dated April 27, 1990, the district court vacated the Rule 11 and 28 U.S.C. § 1927\nsanctions. The issue of sanctions is no longer part of this appeal.\n[9] Navarro's original complaint alleged that suit was brought on behalf of himself and \"all allegedly mentally\nincapacitated persons now residents at the Psychiatric Hospital ... or that are receiving mental treatment in said\nhospital....\" The class plaintiffs now contend exists is coextensive with the definition of resident of the hospital in\nthe stipulated agreement, to wit, \"all persons who are now patients and all persons who may in the future receive\ntreatment or habilitation at such institution [viz. the Hospital].\"\n[10] Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(1) states: \n(1) As soon as practicable after the commencement of an action brought as a class action, the court shall\ndetermine by order whether it is to be so maintained....\n[11]\nIndeed, the defendants have on at least two occasions subsequent to signing the 1977 stipulations described the\nplaintiffs as a class. See Commonwealth's \"Post Trial Memorandum\" dated September 28, 1978 (containing in its\ntitle the term for plaintiffs \"Roberto Navarro Ayala, et al., plaintiffs\") (emphasis added); the Commonwealth's\n\"Motion Submitting Defendant's Exceptions and Commentaries to the Master's Report Filed on July 22, 1987\"\n(\"Defendants respectfully reiterate their request to maintain the scope of the class ... by admitting those portions\nthat apply to the Psychiatric Hospital\").\n[12] Since Spangler was decided, the Fifth Circuit (which decided Bing v. Roadway Express, supra), has\ncontinued to hold that a class action may proceed despite the district court's failure to certify a class where the\n\"defendant[s] ... knew of the class nature of th[e] action and acquiesced in it.\" Graves v. Walton County Board of\nEducation, 686 F.2d 1135, 1139 (5th Cir.1982).\n\n[13] Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(d) reads in relevant part \nIn the conduct of actions to which this rule applies, the court may make appropriate orders: ... (2) requiring, for\nthe protection of the members of the class or otherwise for the fair conduct of the action, that notice be given in\nsuch manner as the court may direct to some or all of the members of any step in the action, ...\n[14] Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e) reads \nA class action shall not be dismissed or compromised without the approval of the court, and notice of the\nproposed dismissal or compromise shall be given to all members of the class in such manner as the court directs.\n[15] The agreement in this case, which was entitled a \"stipulation\" by the parties, approved by the court, and\nupon which judgment was entered, was no different in legal effect from a consent decree. Thus we refer without\ndistinction to precedent involving consent decrees.\n[16]Jewett was a trademark infringement case which merely discussed the standard for interpreting public law\nconsent decrees by way of contrast to the commercial law standard applicable to the case.\n[17] To be sure, a district judge's knowledge about the working realities of Puerto Rico's mental health system\nmay be useful background in construing the stipulation and determining its coverage. But deciding what the\nparties' meant by their writing in 1977 necessitates a more disciplined and traditional inquiry than does\nascertaining whether the current efforts of officials were sufficient to meet broad programmatic goals. Wide\ndeference to the district court's judgment is appropriate to the latter decision but not to the former. Parties to a\nconsent decree are entitled to know that their negotiated choices will be respected 00 that a consent decree will\n97\nnot be treated as a mere entering wedge which, once entered, gives a district court untrammeled discretion to\nincrease the number of public entities it supervises. \nWe do not suggest that a district court's special knowledge concerning the parties' intentions when entering into a\nconsent decree might not, in a proper case, provide material guidance about the decree's meaning. There is no\nissue of that sort here, however. The present district judge was not involved in the parties' negotiations in 1977\nand makes no representations of possessing special knowledge about what transpired then.\n[18] The stipulation was substituted for defendants' right to an adjudication of unconstitutional conduct before\nbeing compelled to remedy conditions at a particular institution. If the Commonwealth defendants did not agree\ntherein to remedy conditions at Guerrero, to force Guerrero to operate under federal court control now amounts\nto imposing unagreed upon federal sanctions without any adjudication of liability in respect to Guerrero.\n[19] The Master and district court never, in so many words, stated that Guerrero was a decentralized form of the\nHospital. They did, however, emphasize the essential role of pre- and post-Hospital \"transitional\" institutions in\nrelieving the Hospital's overload, and thereby enabling the stipulated reforms to proceed at the Hospital. Guerrero\nwas noted as a facility which could, in particular, provide 144 beds for former Hospital patients. (There are figures\nindicating that this number was slightly under half of the Hospital's \"transitional\" patients at a given time, the rest\nbeing sent elsewhere.) The court fought successfully to force the defendants to honor their offer to provide 144\nspaces at Guerrero to relieve overcrowding at the Hospital. We do not question the district court's authority to\nidentify such spaces, and require the Commonwealth to accommodate the Hospital's overflow, as part of its\npower to implement the stipulation meaningfully. See Inmates of Suffolk County Jail v. Eisenstadt, 494 F.2d 1196\n(1st Cir.1974) (in enforcing consent decree requiring only one pretrial detainee per jail cell, district court could\norder some detainees transferred to a separate institution). The question here is not the court's power to force the\nCommonwealth to relocate excess Hospital patients and, if need be, to identify receiving institutions, but its\npower, having done so, to exercise oversight over the care and conditions at such other facilities.\n[20] We have held that \"it is fundamental that for a contract to be enforceable it must be of sufficient explicitness\nso that a court can perceive what are the respective obligations of the parties.\" Soar v. National Football League\nPlayers Ass'n, 550 F.2d 1287, 1289-90 (1st Cir.1977). The reasoning behind this principle is that a contract is an\nagreement between two parties, and a court should not require one of them to do something unless it can be\nreasonably certain that the party agreed to do it. See Corbin on Contracts § 95 (3d Ed.1963). \n\nWe think that this principle should guide our interpretation of the agreement in this case. Were we to hold that\nGuerrero, whose only connection to Rio Piedras is that 144 patients have been transferred to Module 7, is a\n\"decentralized form\" of Rio Piedras, we would be left with an agreement the requirements of which would be\nextremely difficult to determine. First, it would have to be determined what other institutions, besides Guerrero,\nwere also covered. Would all public institutions receiving former Rio Piedras patients be subject to the\nstipulation? What about private contract facilities and foster homes receiving such former patients? What about\nfacilities treating patients who, formerly, would have gone to Rio Piedras? All such places would fit within the\nconcept of pre- and post Hospital facilities. Second, what programs and spaces at such institutions and facilities\nwould be subject to the stipulation? If, say, three former Rio Piedras patients were at a facility housing 100 other\npatients, would the court's jurisdiction extend to the entire place or just to programs and spaces affecting the\nthree transferees? If the latter, how could such a separation be effected, practically? Third, it would be unclear\nwhich parts of the stipulation applied to those other facilities, programs and parts thereof. Some provisions do not\nappear capable of application anywhere but at Rio Piedras, and the court would be left to decide how to modify\nthe stipulations to apply them to other facilities.\n[21] We agree with the dissent that ordinary contract principles should be used to interpret the terms of the\nstipulation. We also agree that one such principle is that evidence extrinsic to the decree may be used to\ndetermine the meaning of the stipulation. We entirely disagree, however, with the dissent's understanding and\ndescription of the extrinsic evidence in this case. The only record evidence of relevant events and documents\nexisting at the time the stipulation was drafted is the complaint, which strongly suggests that the parties were\nconcerned solely with reforming Rio Piedras. See supra, p. 1341. And while our brother evidently believes\notherwise, we are at a loss to see how defendants' actions since the drafting of the stipulation indicate that they\nintended the stipulations to apply to Guerrero. See infra, pp. 1343-1346. We believe that the record simply fails to\nprovide support for this interpretation.\n[22] Typical of such statement was the Master's statement in his report covering the period from August 1985 to\nApril 1986 that \"appreciable reform during fiscal 1986-87 cannot be anticipated unless adequate funding is\nprovided, not just for the Hospital, but also for the entire network of mental health services on which the\neffectiveness of the Hospital ... depends.\"\n[23] Although neither party raises the issue, we have also considered whether the August 10, 1987 order could\nbe considered res judicata. We held in Morgan v. Nucci, 831 F.2d 313 (1st Cir.1987), that reconsideration of a\ndistrict court's injunction in an ongoing institutional reform case can be barred on appeal by the doctrines of issue\npreclusion or \"law of the case.\" However, that case involved an appeal from a district court's order reinstating an\nearlier order which had itself been affirmed on appeal to this court. Where no appeal is taken and decided, the\nunappealed order is ordinarily nonpreclusive. \nWe think such a result follows from the need, in a complex, ongoing case of this nature, that the district court\nretain flexibility to modify its orders to deal with changing circumstances. Thus, where a higher court has not\nconsidered and upheld an interlocutory order, a district court should generally be free to reconsider that order. As\none authority has noted, \"[t]he fact that appeal might have been taken from various intermediate orders under an\ninterlocutory appeal statute or an expanded version of the final judgment rule should not preclude reconsideration\nby the trial court or review on appeal from a traditional final judgment.\" 18 C. Wright, A. Miller and E. Cooper \nFederal Practice and Procedure § 4433 (1981). In this case, the district court did in fact reconsider its August 10\norder on the merits in both the December 28, 1989 opinion and order and the March 6, 1990 opinion and order,\nalthough it ended up concluding that the first order was correct. To hold that the August 10 order was res judicata\nwould mean that the district court had erred in reconsidering its earlier order on the merits. This result would deny\nto the district court the flexibility it thought necessary at least consider the modification of its earlier interlocutory\norders. Thus, the August 10 order was not res judicata.\n[24] In institutional litigation, assertions by the court and its agents, as well as the parties, must often be\nunderstood as part of an extended negotiating process: statements are not always made for their literal truth but\nto encourage or cajole. By the same token, silence in the face of what may appear to be overclaiming by the\ncourt may seem to be prudent policy where matters generally are proceeding satisfactorily. Defendants should\n\nnot have to fear that their willingness to cooperate to a degree greater than required by a consent decree will\nlater be taken as proof that they agreed to more than the decree provides on its face.\n[25] With respect to the equitable estoppel argument, the plaintiffs have not demonstrated that they relied upon\nany purported representations to their detriment. There is no showing that the patients at Guerrero would have\nbeen better off had they remained at the Río Piedras facility in its overcrowded state. There is, indeed, no\nshowing that the plaintiffs \"agreed\" to remove to Guerrero in reliance on some misrepresentation that their\ntreatment there would be governed by the stipulation. In fact, as there is no indication they had any choice about\nmoving, any \"misrepresentation\" could not \"change [their] position for the worse,\" Heckler v. Community Health\nServices of Crawford County, 467 U.S. 51, 59, 104 S.Ct. 2218, 2223, 81 L.Ed.2d 42 (1984) (footnote omitted).\nAbsent a second constitutional suit at Guerrero, this court cannot second guess the means chosen to improve\nthe Rio Piedras facility by asking whether, if the defendants had adopted some other plan for alleviating\novercrowding at Rio Piedras, patients who were transferred to Guerrero would have been better off than they are\nnow.\n[26] The plaintiffs move for sanctions under Fed. R.App.P. 38. As we reverse the district court's decision\nconcerning the applicability of the consent decree and find the defendants to have raised a legitimate argument\nconcerning class certification and notice, we do not consider the appeal to have been \"frivolous.\" The motion is\ntherefore denied.\n[27] The district court devoted twelve pages of its forty-nine page opinion to a reasoned discussion of the\nCommonwealth's federalism claims.\n[28] The majority concludes that the district court had the authority to compel the Commonwealth to transfer\npatients from Rio Piedras, but had no jurisdiction to require that the quality of the treatment provided to\ntransferred patients at the collateral facilities would conform to the stipulations in the consent decree. Thus,\nironically, the majority would give the district court more authority over the Commonwealth than it would have\nunder plaintiffs' interpretation, which would leave the Commonwealth with the unfettered right to determine for\nitself whether to achieve compliance through on-premises improvements or patient transfers, or, as the\ndefendants in fact elected to do, by a combination of means.\n[29] The majority posits the theory that federalism concerns are heightened when a federal court purports to\ninterpret a provision defining the number of institutions with respect to which a State accedes to the exercise of\nfederal court jurisdiction, but not when the federal court defines the \"details\" of the implementation of a particular\npolicy set out in a decree. The reality is, however, that a federal court's definition of the physical reach of its\njurisdiction may pose less unforeseen burdens on the State than may result from the broad brush policy\nimplementation permitted by the majority.\n[30] The majority asserts that plaintiffs' proposed interpretation of \"decentralized form\" is far broader than the\ndefinition of the remedy demanded in the complaint. This assertion overlooks the dynamic of the negotiation\nprocess that typically follows the commencement of public institutional reform litigation. Moreover, at the outset\nthe plaintiffs were seeking to correct conditions at the hospital, but could not be expected to outline in their \ncomplaint the particular means the Commonwealth would elect or be required to utilize to bring about the\nnecessary improvements.\n[31] The first sentence provides that \"Mental Health Centers which refer patients to the San Juan Psychiatric\nHospital shall make a preliminary evaluation of the mental condition of such patient.\" This provision ensures that\nnon-acute patients will no longer be transferred to the Rio Piedras facility from other collateral facilities of the\n\"institution\" unless they need the type of intensive care provided at Rio Piedras. \nThe second sentence, broader in scope, provides that \"[e]ach patient who is referred to the institution must be\npreliminarily evaluated by the Emergency Room Physician prior to admission to determine whether he should be\nadmitted.\" Under this provision, if a patient is transferred into the \"institution,\" as defined in the decree, from any\nfacility outside the institution, the patient must be evaluated at Rio Piedras to ensure that he is placed in the\nappropriate component facility (pre-hospital facility, hospital facility, post-hospital facility), or that he is denied\nadmission if he will not benefit from any of these treatment programs.\n\nThe third sentence provides that \"[i]f admitted, within two weeks days [sic] of his or her admission to the\ninstitution each patient is to be evaluated by the physician assigned to the ward where the patient has been\nplaced.\" This provision merely requires that the institution place admitted patients in appropriate \"wards\" within a\nparticular component facility. It is designed to prevent repetition of the problems previously encountered at Rio\nPiedras where patients often were grouped together \"according to their geographical origin, regardless of their\nmental condition and needs.\" The term \"ward,\" which is not defined in the decree, certainly is not so precise or\nexclusive that it could only refer to sections or divisions at the Rio Piedras facility. Presumably, other collateral\nfacilities of the \"institution\" might segregate patients into different sections according to their medical needs. For\nexample, the Guerrero facility apparently is divided into modules containing fixed numbers of patients and beds,\nsince a 144-bed module has been set aside to receive patients transferred from Rio Piedras.\n[32] We consistently have held that its more direct exposure to public institutional reform litigation entitles the\ndistrict court to considerable deference, even in cases where the particular district court judge whose ruling is\nbefore us on appeal is not the judge who approved the original consent decree: \nAppellants argue that deference is not warranted here because the ... decrees were entered by one judge, and\nthree other judges have presided over this case. Furthermore appellants argue, the trial judge was \"entirely\nuninvolved\" in the case until the eve of trial. This argument is without substance. It is the district court as an\ninstitution that merits deference. We are unwilling to develop a litmus test for use in analyzing the depth of a trial\njudge's familiarity with a case in order to determine the resulting deference to which he or she is entitled.\nPearson v. Fair, 935 F.2d 401, 409 (1st Cir.1991) (emphasis added); see also Langton v. Johnston, 928 F.2d\n1206, 1222 (1st Cir.1991) (\"The district court, albeit in the person of a series of [five] different judges, has been\nthe central figure in monitoring the extent and adequacy of services provided at the Treatment Center over the\nbetter part of the last two decades.\").\n[33] The district court opinion did note, however: \nPlaintiffs claim that the term \"in decentralized form\" demonstrates that the parties understood, when they\nnegotiated the stipulated agreement, that the Hospital might in the future be decentralized by relocating its pre\nand post hospital services, that this process was in fact begun and is continuing under Plan 3, and that the\nparties intended from the beginning that Hospital patients decentralized or deinstitutionalized would continue to\nbe members of the Class covered by the stipulations. The Court considers plaintiffs' interpretation of the parties'\nintent to have considerable merit, but finds no need to rely on it in view of the analysis which is fully developed in\nthis opinion of the acceptance by the parties since 1985, until October 1989, that the Hospital's full compliance\ndepended on a systemic approach, covering not only the services it rendered directly, but as well its support\nsystem of pre and post hospital services.\n(Emphasis added.)\n[34] In his third report filed in 1986, the Master described the Commonwealth's recent evaluation of a \"model\"\nmental health program in Boston (the Massachusetts Mental Health Center), which consisted of \"a complex of\nintensive care units, a day-hospital, an inn and an array of residential facilities scattered throughout the\ncommunity designed to satisfy the needs of the individual patient.\" The Master concluded that the Massachusetts\nmodel \"can be incorporated into the Hospital's plan to comply with the consent decree.\" The Master also stated\nthat the Commonwealth's budget for fiscal year 1986-87 \"was entirely inadequate to bring the Hospital and its\nsupporting mental health services into compliance with the consent decree,\" and again, later in that report, stated\nthat \"[a]t that budgetary level neither the Hospital nor the mental health programs on which it must rely could\npossibly come into compliance.\"\n[35] The Commonwealth's exception to Plan 3's jurisdictional provisions states, in pertinent part: \nSaid plan includes a description of the Mental Health Program of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to illustrate\nthis Honorable Court and the Master as to the scope of the program. The Psychiatric Hospital of Rio Piedras is\nonly a part of said program and is the institution under the stipulations before this Honorable Court, with whatever\nfacilities may be used to descentralize [sic] the care of said hospital's patients. As before stated the individuals\n\nthat come in contact with the primary units of the mental health program are not patients of the Psychiatric\nHospital and most of the time do not become so. The class in the present action is composed of the patients of\nthe Psychiatric Hospital and the institutions wherever they may be referred to in a descentralization [sic] program\n* [*See definitions of the stipulations 00 June 27, 1987] Defendants respectfully reiterate their request to maintain\n97\nthe scope of the class in the above captioned case and the stipulations agreed on by admitting from Plan # 3\nthose portions that apply to the Psychiatric Hospital.\nDespite the Commonwealth's clear reference to the definition of the term \"institution,\" the majority concludes that\nthe reference was later contradicted and limited by the Commonwealth's final request that the court \"admit[] from\nPlan 3 those portions [of the jurisdictional provisions] that apply to the psychiatric hospital.\" The word \"admit\"\nrefers to the impending order of August 10, 1987, in which the district court would either admit or reject the\nindividual provisions proposed in Plan 3. The objection demonstrates that the defendants would not challenge the\ninclusion of Plan 3's jurisdictional provisions if interpreted so as to include only the \"psychiatric hospital,\" therein\ndefined by the Commonwealth, in perfect agreement with the language of the consent decree, as \"the institution\n... with whatever facilities may be used to decentralize the care of said hospital's patients.\"\nFinally, the majority states that the district court, in its order of August 10, 1987, interpreted the Commonwealth's\nchallenge as an objection to the expansion of the court's jurisdiction beyond Rio Piedras, rather than as a\nnarrower objection to an extension of jurisdiction beyond the \"institution\" to all mental health facilities in Puerto\nRico. After generally noting that the Commonwealth had never before questioned the scope of the court's\njurisdiction as opined by the Master, the district court merely concluded that the defendants had \"waived \nwhatever claim that they might have had about ... the scope of the stipulations.\" The court decided that\ndefendants could raise no jurisdictional objection of any kind at that late stage of the litigation, and it never\naddressed the nature of the jurisdictional \"objection\" advanced in the exception.\n[36] In rejecting the plaintiff's equitable estoppel argument, the majority states that the transferred patients did not\nrely to their detriment on the Commonwealth's acquiescence or its representations regarding the court's\njurisdiction. On the contrary, transferred patients, as members of the plaintiff class, were contracting parties for\npurposes of the consent decree and must be deemed to have relied on the definition of \"institution\" contained in\nthe consent decree. If patients who were to be transferred had been alerted that, once transferred from Rio\nPiedras, they would be beyond the reach of the district court's equitable powers, the plaintiff class could have\nprevented the Commonwealth from transferring them from Rio Piedras, thereby keeping them under the\nprotection of the decree. Once their reasonable reliance on the Commonwealth's course of compliance with the\nconsent decree caused transferred patients to become stranded beyond the district court's equitable powers,\ntransferred patients inarguably suffered a legal detriment of significant proportions under the jurisdictional\ninterpretation adopted by the majority.\n[37] There is no inequity in using the post-decree acquiescence or the practical interpretation of the consent\ndecree by successive officials of the Commonwealth to determine the original intent of the consent decree. The\ngeneral rule that one administration cannot bind its successors by its stated positions does not apply to\ngovernment officials in the context of public institutional reform litigation. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 25(d); see also \nNewman v. Graddick, 740 F.2d 1513, 1517-18 (11th Cir.1984) (current state officials have authority to enter into\nconsent decree and bind incoming successors, who upon taking office become parties to decree through\nautomatic substitution) (citing United States v. Swift, 286 U.S. 106, 52 S.Ct. 460, 76 L.Ed. 999 (1932)). The\npractical interpretation given the original terms of the consent decree by each successive Commonwealth\nadministration, as a substituted party to the proceedings, bears directly on our inquiry into the meaning of the\nconsent decree.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Del Valle Cruz with whom Ramirez & Ramirez, Jorge E. Perez Diaz, Secretary of Justice, Com. of P.R.,\nand Anabelle Rodriguez, Sol. Gen., Com. of P.R., Hato Rey, PR, were on brief for defendants, appellants.\nCarlos Garcia Gutierrez with whom Armando Cardona Acaba, Puerto Rico Legal Services, Inc., and Luis M.\n465 Villaronga, San *465 Juan, PR, were on brief, for plaintiffs, appellees.\nBefore BREYER, Chief Judge, TORRUELLA and BOUDIN, Circuit Judges.\nBREYER, Chief Judge.\nKenneth Colon, an attorney, appeals a $500 sanction that the district court imposed after finding that he had\nviolated Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The district court based the sanction upon a motion that\nColon signed, on behalf of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, which asked the court to reduce the compensation\npaid to a special master. After reviewing the motion and the record, we find no violation of Rule 11. We conclude\nthat the sanction is without basis in law, and reverse the order imposing it.\nI\nBackground\nThe sanction arose in the context of lengthy litigation seeking to reform part of Puerto Rico's mental health\nsystem. See, e.g., Navarro-Ayala v. Hernandez-Colon, 956 F.2d 348 (1st Cir.1992). In 1974, a group of patients\nat Rio Piedras Hospital filed suit, claiming that conditions there violated the federal Constitution. In 1977, the\ndistrict court entered a Stipulation, agreed upon by the parties, which prescribes reforms and sets standards for\ncare and treatment. In 1985, the district court appointed a Special Master who, assisted by a staff, was to monitor\ncompliance with the Stipulation. In 1987, the district court began to interpret the Stipulation as applying to other\nhospitals in Puerto Rico (at least insofar as they treated patients transferred from Rio Piedras). The Special\nMaster began to monitor treatment conditions and seek compliance with the Stipulation at, at least, one other\nhospital.\nIn late 1991, this court held that the Stipulation applied only to conditions at Rio Piedras; in the court's view, the\nparties had not agreed to its application elsewhere. Navarro-Ayala v. Hernandez-Colon, 951 F.2d 1325, 1346 (1st\nCir.1991) (\"Navarro I\"). The court's opinion also observed that Rio Piedras Hospital seemed to be close to\nachieving full compliance with the Stipulation's conditions. Id. at 1329 n. 3. About one month later, in January\n1992, the district court reappointed the Special Master, and his monitoring staff, to serve until the end of the year.\nIn February 1992, the Commonwealth filed the motion, signed by attorney Colon, that is the subject of this\nappeal. The motion asked the district court to reconsider its January 1992 reappointment of the Special Master,\nto reduce the length of the term of that reappointment, to reduce the level of compensation paid the Master and\nhis staff, and to relieve the Commonwealth of the burden of paying for a year's worth of monitoring services in\n\nadvance. After considering and rejecting the motion, the district court decided that its signer had violated Rule 11.\nThe district court ordered a sanction of $500. The sanctioned attorney, Kenneth Colon, now appeals.\nII\nReview of the Sanction Order\nUnder Rule 11 (in relevant part), an attorney's signature on a motion paper certifies that \"to the best of the\nsigner's knowledge, information and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, [the motion] is well grounded in fact\nand is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing\nlaw ...\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 11. The district court concluded that the signer of the motion paper before us failed in his\nduty to undertake reasonable inquiry. In reviewing that holding, we must take account of that court's greater\nfamiliarity with relevant context, and \"apply an abuse-of-discretion standard.\" Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp.,\n496 U.S. 384, 399, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 2457, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990); see also Muthig v. Brant Point Nantucket, Inc.,\n838 F.2d 600, 603 (1st Cir.1988). Applying that standard, we have found no lawful basis for applying a sanction in\nthis case.\nThe reader can most easily understand why we reach this conclusion by examining attorney Colon's motion\n466 paper, attached to *466 this opinion as an Appendix. Just what is it about this paper, one might rightly ask, that\nwould violate Rule 11? The document makes three requests. First, the motion asks the district court to reappoint\nthe Special Master to a term shorter than an additional (nearly) full year. It relies on the fact that our then-recent \nNavarro I opinion both 1) limited the Stipulation's scope to conditions at Rio Piedras Hospital, and 2) referred to\nRio Piedras' conditions as close to compliance. In light of those reasons, the motion asserts that the Master's\nduties under the Stipulation may be less extensive in the coming year than the district court had previously\nthought. And, it claims that the parties' briefs discussing the implications of Navarro I (scheduled for submission\nin mid-March) would clarify the more limited scope of those future duties.\nSecond, the motion asks the district court not to require the Commonwealth to \"pre-pay[]\" a year's worth of\nmonitoring services, for such payment would be \"premature\" given that \"the need for and extent of these services\nhas not been defined.\" It adds that there \"is no reason why the required monitoring services cannot be\ncompensated after their performance....\" As authority, it cites Rule 53(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\nwhich gives federal courts broad authority to structure a special master's compensation. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 53(a)\n(compensation shall be paid \"as the court may direct\").\nThird, the motion opposes the rates of compensation for the Special Master and staff set forth in the court-\napproved budget. The motion, in an Appendix A, presents a chart which says, in effect, that the Commonwealth\ncompensates its judges, inferior judicial officers, and comparable health care personnel at much lower rates of\npay. And the motion, in referring to Rule 53(a), makes clear that the district court has wide discretion to set the\nproper amount of compensation. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 53(a) (compensation \"shall be fixed by the court\").\nThe district court based its Rule 11 finding primarily upon the motion's third request, seeking a reduction in\ncompensation. The January 1992 order reappointing the Special Master provided for compensation at the\nfollowing hourly rates:\nSpecial Master                $100.00\nSpecial Master's assistant      30.00\nPsychiatrist                    75.00\nPsychologist                    75.00\nSocial worker                   60.00\nOccupational therapist          25.00\nQuality assurance director      25.00\nThe appellant's motion in opposition set forth (in its Appendix A) a different and much lower set of hourly rates at\nwhich, it said, the Commonwealth paid comparable employees:\n\nSuperior Court judge          $ 27.00\nSuperior Court law clerk        10.00\nPsychiatrist                    11.20\nPsychologist                    11.20\nSocial worker                    9.80\nOccupational therapist           7.90\nQuality assurance director       7.90\nThe district court took objection to this latter schedule. The court said that this schedule did not reflect the pay\nthat many health care professionals in the Commonwealth's employ actually receive. The court said further that\nColon had failed to make a reasonable prefiling inquiry into the actual pay of such professionals before\nsuggesting Appendix A's pay scales, which were \"drastically below the staff's current rates.\" These suggested\npay scales, the court added, were \"insulting to the professionals on the Special Master's staff.\"\nIn our view, the record does not support the district court's conclusion that Rule 11 required attorney Colon to\nmake a further inquiry. For one thing, the object of Rule 11's inquiry requirement is to avoid filings that are\nbaseless. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 11 (signature certifies that \"to the best of the signer's knowledge ... formed after\nreasonable inquiry, [the motion] is well grounded in fact and is warranted\" by law) (emphasis added); Cooter &\nGell, 496 U.S. at 393, 110 S.Ct. at 2454 (\"the central purpose of Rule 11 is to deter baseless filings\"). Here, the\ninquiry that the district court believed the appellant should have made would not have shown the motion to be\nbaseless (i.e. legally unwarranted, or without adequate factual grounding). It would simply have weakened,\nwithout destroying, the Commonwealth's argument.\n467 *467 More specifically, the inquiry would have shown 1) that the motion's Appendix A accurately reflects an official\nCommonwealth pay scale, set by its central personnel agency, for permanent health care professionals, but 2)\nthat the Commonwealth hires many (perhaps most) health care professionals, not as permanent employees, but\nunder special contractual arrangements at higher rates. In light of that showing, the Commonwealth might have\nfound it more difficult, but not at all impossible, to proceed with its claim for lower compensation on the basis of\nAppendix A. The legal standards governing special master compensation leave much to the district court's\ndiscretion. Fed.R.Civ.P. 53(a). And, an effort to tie the Special Master and staffs' compensation more directly to\njudicial compensation and to an \"official\" (though frequently skirted) Commonwealth pay scale is plausible, and\nwithin the realm of reasonable argument, even if that argument eventually would not carry the day. Cf. Newton v.\nConsolidated Gas Co., 259 U.S. 101, 105, 42 S.Ct. 438, 439, 66 L.Ed. 844 (1922) (special master's\ncompensation should be \"liberal, but not exorbitant\"; salaries \"for judicial officers performing similar duties are\nvaluable guides,\" but a \"higher rate of compensation is generally necessary\").\nFor another thing, the motion paper's failure to set forth a more complete account of Commonwealth pay\npractices did not impose significant additional costs upon the opposing party. See, e.g., Unioil, Inc. v. E.F. Hutton\n& Co., 809 F.2d 548, 557 (9th Cir.1986) (cost of foreseeable response by opposing parties relevant for\ndetermining what constitutes reasonable inquiry), cert. denied,484 U.S. 822, 108 S.Ct. 83, 98 L.Ed.2d 45 (1987);\nJerold S. Solovy et al., Sanctions in Federal Litigation § 2.04 at 2-18 (1991) (magnitude of burden in responding\nto filing affects thoroughness of investigation that must be performed). That party, the Special Master, and the\nMaster's staff, all had ready access to the relevant compensation-related facts and quickly brought them to the\ncourt's attention. Of course, presenting these facts did cost the opposing party some time and effort. But Rule 11\nnormally does not require one party to uncover and to set forth the facts that support the other side's position. Cf. \nContinental Air Lines, Inc. v. Group Systems International Far East, Ltd., 109 F.R.D. 594, 598 (C.D.Cal.1986)\n(Rule 11 does not impose general duty to call all important facts to court's attention).\nFinally, the motion, read fairly and as a whole, contains no significant false statement that significantly harmed\nthe other side. We emphasize the word \"significant\" because the district court found one sentence literally false.\nThat sentence says that the \"rates of pay\" for the Master's staff \"outpace by a factor of 6 or more to 1, the rates of\npay of their counterparts in the Public Health System.\" This statement is not literally false, if one uses the \"official\"\npay scale for permanent employees as a comparison; in light of actual pay practices, we would characterize it as\n\"overstatement\" or \"one-sided characterization.\" But were it literally inaccurate, it would not matter, for Rule 11\n\nneither penalizes overstatement nor authorizes an overly literal reading of each factual statement. Forrest Creek\nAssoc., Ltd. v. McLean Sav. and Loan Ass'n, 831 F.2d 1238, 1244-45 (4th Cir.1987) (Rule 11 \"does not extend to\nisolated factual errors, committed in good faith, so long as the pleading as a whole remains `well grounded in\nfact.'\"); Gregory P. Joseph, Sanctions: The Federal Law of Litigation Abuse § 9(D) at 133-34 (1989) (\"The focus\nof ... Rule [11] is the court paper as a whole, not individual phrases or sentences construed separately or taken\nout of context.... [A]t some level of analysis, every unsuccessful litigation paper contains an unsupported\nallegation or flawed argument.\").\nThe district court provided several other justifications for its sanctions. It said that Colon, in the motion paper, (1)\nshould not have used the word \"bilking,\" (2) should not have called the payments \"burdensome\" without first\ninvestigating the actual \"effects of these payments on the Department of Health's budget,\" (3) should not have\nsaid the litigation was in the \"final stage of proceedings\" without asking government officials \"if full compliance\nand an end to this case were in fact close at hand,\" and (4) should not have asked to change the budgeting\n468 process without *468 first finding out \"how the Special Master had been paid in the past.\"\nIn our view, these circumstances do not justify a Rule 11 sanction, whether considered separately or all together.\n(1) We concede that the word \"bilking\" is pejorative and, insofar as it implies cheating, without justification. We\nalso concede the obvious point that argument made to a judge is more appropriate (and usually works better)\nwithout pejoratives. But to find support for a Rule 11 sanction in appellant's use of a single, rather mild (albeit\nunjustified) pejorative, is to impose a standard of perfection that few lawyers or judges would meet. We are not\naware of any reason or authority suggesting that Rule 11 imposes such a standard.\n(2) The motion paper does call the Special Master's budget \"burdensome,\" but we do not understand where, or\nhow, Rule 11 forbids such a characterization. No one disputes that the total amount of the Special Master's court-\napproved budget is $171,000. Nothing in the record suggests that the Commonwealth found this amount\ninsignificant; nor do we understand either how further consultation with government officials would have led\nattorney Colon to change the characterization, or how the use of the word \"burdensome\" made a significant\ndifference to the litigation.\n(3) Neither do we understand how, or why, Rule 11 would forbid attorney Colon to characterize the litigation as in\nthe \"final stage of proceeding.\" Our opinion in Navarro I curtailed the scope of the Stipulation and also observed\nthat \"conditions\" at Rio Piedras may be \"largely ... in compliance.\" The motion paper made clear that the\nCommonwealth would soon file a brief arguing in favor of significantly limiting the Special Master's monitoring\nactivity. Thus the statement seems to amount to an argument, reasonable in its context, that might, or might not,\nhelp convince a court. The record does not make clear how further \"inquiry\" or further consultation with\ngovernment officials would have shown the argument to have lacked adequate \"ground[ing] in fact.\"\n(4) We agree with the district court that the motion paper, in requesting that \"monitoring services be compensated\nafter their performance,\" does not take account of the fact that the current budgeting system provided for\ndisbursement of budget funds (on a monthly basis) to the Special Master only after he performed services.\nNonetheless, we do not see how the motion's possible misstatement can justify a sanction. Read fairly, and in\ncontext, the paper's request indicates that the Commonwealth objected to having to budget for a year's worth of\nmonitoring services in advance, a portion of which might turn out to have been unnecessary. At worst, the paper's\nstatement reflects a minor, technical confusion about the budgeting process, and one which apparently caused\nno harm. (After all, the opposing party, the Special Master, and the court, all understood, and could readily\nexplain, how current budgeting worked.) See Forrest Creek Associates, Ltd., 831 F.2d at 1244-45; Joseph, \nSanctions § 9(D) at 133-34.\nIn sum, the district court, at most, could have found a few isolated instances of noncritical statements that further\ninquiry might have shown to be inaccurate or overstated. That further inquiry would not have shown the motion's\nrequests to have been baseless. And, failure to make that inquiry did not unfairly impose upon the other party\nsome special litigation cost or burden. This case differs significantly from the kinds of cases in which this court\nhas upheld a district court's imposition of Rule 11 sanctions. Cf. Muthig, 838 F.2d at 605 (no reasonable inquiry\nwhere counsel could have readily learned from clients facts that would have shown their claim for intentional\ninfliction of emotional distress lacked validity); Ryan v. Clemente, 901 F.2d 177, 179-81 (1st Cir.1990)\n(sanctioning harmful allegation that state officials failed to investigate illegal scheme where available record\n\nshowed the contrary); Cruz v. Savage, 896 F.2d 626, 632-34 (1st Cir.1990) (sanctioning attorney for\nunreasonably bringing and pursuing nine frivolous claims, including some with either no supporting evidence or\nwhere record directly contradicted claim); Bay State Towing Co. v. Barge American 21, 899 F.2d 129, 131 (1st\n469 Cir.1990) (no reasonable inquiry where extensive record contains nothing to suggest why or how a *469 person\ncould have believed most of filing's claims). We do not see how the district court could find a failure to undertake\nthe \"reasonable inquiry\" that Rule 11 requires. The order of the district court is\nReversed.\nAPPENDIX\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF\nPUERTO RICO\nROBERTO NAVARRO, et al., Plaintiffs,\nvs.\nRAFAEL HERNANDEZ COLON, et al., Defendants.\nCIVIL NO. 74-1301 (HL)\nMOTION FOR RELIEF FROM ORDER PURSUANT TO RULE 60(b)(5)\nAND (6)\nTO THE HONORABLE COURT:\nCOME NOW the defendants, Hon. Rafael Hernández Colón, Dr. José Soler Zapata, Dr. Luis M. Polo, and Ms.\nJudith Mark, through the undersigned attorney and respectfully move the Court for relief from the Order of\nJanuary 31, 1992 on the grounds that the judgment upon which it is based has been partially vacated, that it is no\nlonger equitable that the order should have prospective application and that the proposed budgetary requests\nwould unduly burden the Treasury of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\nMEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR RELIEF\nI. In View of the Circuit Court of Appeals Judgment Entered December\n18, 1991 (No. 90-1339) The Prospective Appointment of the Master is\nPremature.\nThe Appeals Court decision of December 18, 1991 states that, \"Orders of the district court inconsistent with the\nopinion of this Court issued this date are vacated.\" Said opinion has raised substantial questions regarding the\nbreadth of the District Court's authority to implement institutional reform in Puerto Rico. The parameters of the\nDistrict Court's authority over places and persons related to this class action will require a careful reconsideration\nof all past and current District Court orders whether these be in the form of a Consent Decree, unilateral\ncommitments, or Master's recommendations adopted by the court. Until such an overview of the boundaries of\nthis action is established, the long term re-appointment of the Master is premature. Such an overview will only be\npossible after March 16, 1992 when the parties will submit, for the Court's consideration, their responses to the\nCourt's inquiries and their briefs interpreting the appellate decision.\n\nII. The Request for Prospective Funding and The Proposed Budgetary\nOutlays Serve to Impose an Undue Financial Burden.\nAlthough a more comprehensive brief addressing the current compliance requirements is scheduled for\nsubmission to the Court by March 16, 1992, the defendants now object vehemently to the prospective subsidy of\nmonitoring activities represented by the Certification of January 30, 1992 and the Appendices thereto. The extent\nof monitoring not yet determined, the prepayment of these services is premature and burdensome on the\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico Treasury. There is no reason why the required monitoring services cannot be\ncompensated after their performance especially when the need for and extent of these services has not been\ndefined. Rule 53(a) specifically allows for such a post-service compensation system.\nMoreover, the budget outlays requested are completely incommensurate with the economies of public\nadministration. The objection to the budget requests are as follows: 1) The Special Master's compensation of\n$50,000 far exceeds a fair compensation for the services required at this final stage of the proceedings; 2) The\nSpecial Master's Assistant's compensation of $40,000 far exceeds a fair compensation for services at this final\nstage of the proceedings; 3) The rates of pay for the Advisory Interdisciplinary Team outpace, by a factor of 6 or\n470 more to 1, the rates of pay of their counterparts in the Public *470 Health System of Puerto Rico; and 4) the\npurchase of top of the line office equipment is inconsistent with the monitoring services to be performed and the\nbudgetary limitations which must be considered. These budgetary requests would occasion a bilking of the public\ntreasury and are inconsistent with the opinion of the Court of Appeals. What is a reasonable monitoring\nexpenditure will be evident only following the submission of the parties' briefs by March 16, 1992.\nWHEREFORE, the defendants respectfully ask for the above described relief from the Order of January 31, 1992\nand pray that any future budgetary expenditures should reflect the current income levels of the health care\nprofessionals who dutifully serve the people of Puerto Rico (Please See Exhibit A), that the purchase of office\nequipment be limited to the minimum, necessary items at reasonable cost, that the Special Master and Assistant\nbe permitted an hourly compensation commensurate with the hourly income of a Commonwealth District Court\nJudge and Law Clerk (Please See Exhibit A), and that the services of all persons engaged in monitoring be\ncompensated post-performance instead of as an advance as permitted by Rule 53(a) and originally stated in the\nOrder of February 8, 1985 in this case.\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that on this date, a true copy of the foregoing document has been sent by mail to: DAVID M.\nHELFELD, MASTER, Special Master, Box 22712, University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico 00961,\nALICE NET CARLO, GARCIA RODON, CORREA MARQUEZ & VALDERAS, Citibank Tower, Eighth Floor, Hato\nRey, Puerto Rico 00917 and ARMANDO CARDONA, ESQ., Legal Services Corporation, Box 21486, Rio Piedras,\nPuerto Rico 00928.\nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED.\nIn San Juan, Puerto Rico, this 20th day of February, 1992.\nJORGE E.

Brief History of the Case:\nIn 1974, Roberto Navarro  Ayala, a mentally retarded patient at the Río Piedras\nPsychiatric Ward Hospital (RPPH), filed a civil rights class action in this Court.  The complaint\nrightfully asserted that the federally protected constitutional rights of the patients were being\nviolated by overcrowding, inadequate care, and harsh conditions at RPPH.  In April of 1997,\nthe Court approved a stipulated consent decree which included eighty-six standards that the\nparties consented to observe at the Hospital.  Thereafter, in February of 1985, the Court\nappointed Dr. David M. Helfeld, former Dean of the University of Puerto Rico Law School,\nas a Special Master, in order to ensure the parties compliance with the 1977 stipulation\nagreement, and to provide the Court with reports on the Hospital’s progress.   Slowly but\n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 604   Filed 01/10/05   Page 2 of 6\n2\nsurely, the Hospital made tremendous improvements throughout the long and tortuous path of\nthis institutional reform litigation.  For example, on June 18, 1997, the Court entered a an order\nfinding that significant progress had been achieved at RPPH.  In March of 1999, RPPH\nreceived  accreditations  by  the  Joint  Commission  for  the  Accreditation  of  Health  Care\nOrganization (J.C.A.H.C.O.) and by Medicare, respectively. Thereafter, on August 11, 2000,\nthe parties filed a Joint Stipulation and Order of Dismissal, which the Court adopted, asserting\nsubstantial compliance with the Consent Decree, pledging to maintain the J.C.A.H.C.O.\naccreditation, and agreeing to maintain a yearly appropriated budge of at least $18,929,000.00,\nto adequately provide for the health, welfare, safety and treatment of the patients at RPPH.\n(See Docket No. 494).  Finally,  on January 28, 2002, the Court dismissed the case and issued\nan order providing, in relevant part, that its “order of March 9, 2000 (docket no. 476) and the\njoint Stipulation and Order of Dismissal of August 11, 2000 (docket no. 494) shall remain in\neffect to ensure the continued constitutional protection of the patients of the RPPH.” (See\nDocket No. 503.)   \nII. The 2003-04 investigation: \nIn March of 2003, the Court received communications from various sources alleging\nviolations of the Court’s January 28, 2002 order, specifically that: (1) the budget for the Rio\nPiedras Hospital for the forthcoming fiscal year had been reduced from the $18,929,000.00\nrequired by the Court’s order; (2) that during the present and past fiscal years funds budgeted\nfor the Hospital were transferred to cover costs not related to the Hospital’s operations; and\n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 604   Filed 01/10/05   Page 3 of 6\n3\n(3) that the decision to close down the San Patricio Mental Health Clinic was in violation of\nthe Court’s findings that the existence of pre and post Hospital support systems were essential\nto ensure and safeguard the RPPH’s patient’s constitutional rights. After conducting a status\nconference with the parties, the Court reappointed Dr. Helfeld on April 29, 2003, as Special\nMaster, to conduct an investigation relative to the allegations of non-compliance by the RPPH.\n(See Docket No. 508).  Contrary to the parties’ assumptions, the Court did not reopen the case,\nbut rather utilized its inherent powers to appoint the Special Master to investigate the\nallegations and report his findings to the Court. Thereafter, the Court conducted numerous\nstatus  conferences  with  the  parties  and  received  a  total  of  five  (5)  voluminous  and\ncomprehensive reports by Dr. Helfeld detailing certain deteriorating conditions at the RPPH.\n Defendants, in turn, responded to Dr. Helfeld’s reports, detailing the administrative and fiscal\nmeasures that the Hospital had implemented in its efforts to address the Court’s concerns as\nto the deteriorating conditions at the Hospital.  The plaintiff class also had an opportunity to\nfile a reply to the Special Master’s Fifth and Final Report. (See Docket No. 594).   Dr.\nHelfeld’s mastership expired on August 30, 2004.  \nThe Court has reviewed Dr. Helfeld’s reports and the responses of all the parties, and\nconcludes that at this time the RPPH is in substantial compliance with the consent decree and\nthe January 28, 2002 order.  First, it appears from the information contained in the Special\nMaster’s Second Report, and the motions filed by the Commonwealth defendants, that the\nbudget for the RPPH was not reduced from the $18, 929,000.00 required by the Court’s order\n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 604   Filed 01/10/05   Page 4 of 6\n4\nof January 28, 2002, but was increased to $21,429,000.00.  In addition, the information\npresented to the Court shows that the Commonwealth defendants have no intention to close\ndown the San Patricio Mental Care Health Center, and that the funds budgeted for the Hospital\nhad not been diverted to cover any costs other than those related to the Hospital’s operations.\nIn addition, the Court finds that the Commonwealth defendants have taken a series of\nadministrative and fiscal measures to address the RPPH’s  pre and post-Hospitalization\nservices.  The RPPH is also in the process of ensuring its compliance with the requirements\nfor the upcoming J.C.A.H.C.O. accreditation scheduled in March of 2005. \nPlaintiffs have requested that the Court “close” this case.  Since the case has not been\n“reopened,” the Court takes plaintiffs’ motion as a request to cease further federal judicial\nintervention in this matter, given that the RPPH’s current conditions are consonant with\nconstitutional mandates.   (See Plaintiffs’ Response to the Special Master’s Fifth and Final\nReport, Docket No. 594).   The Court is satisfied that the Commonwealth defendants are\ncognizant of the importance of safeguarding the constitutional rights of the patients at the\nRPPH.  The Court expects the Commonwealth defendants to comply with all the requirements\nnecessary to ensure the Hospital’s renewed accreditation this upcoming March, and continue\ncomplying with  pre and post-Hospitalization continuum.   In an effort to ensure the Hospital’s\ncontinued  compliance  with  the  consent  decree,  the  Court  hereby increases  it  previous\n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 604   Filed 01/10/05   Page 5 of 6\n5\nbudgetary mandate of $18, 929,000.00 to $23,000,000.00 per fiscal year.1    \nIn summary, the Court hereby ratifies its prior order of January 28, 2002 (Docket No.\n503), incorporating the order of March 9, 2000 (Docket No. 476),  and the joint stipulation of\ndismissal of August 11, 2000  (Docket No. 494).  Whereupon, the Court hereby ORDERS\nthat:  \n(1) All monies received by or credited to the Puerto Rico Department of Health\nand  Anti-Addiction  Services  Administration  or  its  successor,  or  the  monies\nreceived  by  RPPH  from  Medicare  or  any  private  entities  in  payment  or\nreimbursement for medical or psychiatric services rendered at the Hospital shall\nbe allocated by the Government of Puerto Rico to the Hospital’s operational\naccount(s) and used as operating funds.  Until further order of the Court, such\nmonies shall not be used by the Department of Health, the Mental Health and\nAnti-Addiction Services Administration, the Hospital, or any other Puerto Rico\ngovernmental agency or instrumentality for any purpose other than as specified\nherein; and (2) that in accordance with the joint stipulation, the Commonwealth\npledges to maintain the J.C.A.H.C.O. accreditation, and shall henceforth maintain\na yearly appropriated budget of at least $23,000,000.00 to adequately provide for\nthe health, welfare, safety and treatment of the patients at the RPPH.\nIn conclusion, the Court finds that there is currently no evidence of constitutional\nviolations at the RPPH  that would warrant further federal judicial involvement in this case.\nAs the First Circuit Court of Appeals has recently stated in another institutional reform\nlitigation case in this District, the court’s oversight of the RPPH “cannot –and should not– last\n1 It is a fact that the Commonwealth defendants had already afforded more funds to\nRPPH’s yearly budget as a response to the institution’s new financial reality\n\nCase 3:74-cv-01301-FAB   Document 604   Filed 01/10/05   Page 6 of 6\n6\nforever.”  See e.g., Morales Feliciano v. Rullan, 378 F.3d 42, 60 (1st Cir. 2004).  Copy of this\nOrder shall be notified to the Secretary of Health, the Director of the Commonwealth’s Budget\nBureau, the Hospital’s Medical Director, and the Hospital’s Executive Director.\n  IT IS SO ORDERED.\nIn San Juan, Puerto Rico, this 10th day of January 2005.\n  \n  S/ HECTOR M.
