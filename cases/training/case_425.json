    "summary": "<p>On March 15, 1996, the United States filed a lawsuit under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 1997, against the State of Tennessee, the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation (DMH/MR) and the Memphis Mental Health Institute (MMHI), in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, Memphis Division.  The government asked the court for injunctive relief, alleging that the defendants were depriving patients of MMHI of constitutional rights, privileges and immunities.  Specifically, the plaintiff contended that the defendants failed to provide adequate medical care, failed to provide individualized psychiatric care and treatment, and failed to provide adequate trained direct care and professional staff.</p><p>The CRIPA investigation began in 1990.  On November 2, 1990, the Department of Justice (DOJ) began sending internal memoranda recommending a CRIPA investigation of conditions at MMHI.  The preliminary findings indicated that conditions there included inadequate psychiatric care and treatment, inadequate supervision and neglect caused by an inadequate number of professional and direct care staff, as well as general medical care deficiencies, including overuse and misuse of medication and an unsafe and unsanitary environment.  On December 12, 1990, the DOJ sent the Governor of Tennessee a letter indicating an intention to investigate.  And, on April 4, 1991, the DOJ sent another letter to the Governor presenting interim findings.  In that letter, the DOJ indicated it found MMHI did not have a sufficient number of psychiatrists, nurses, or psychiatric technicians, and that DMH/MR planned to cut additional staff positions at MMHI.  On February 6, 1992, the DOJ sent another letter to the Governor presenting its findings.  In that letter, the DOJ indicated it found that MMHI failed to provide patients with adequate general and emergency medical care, had inadequate psychiatric care and medication practices, and employed improper and excessive use of physical restraints.  Further, in its findings letter, DOJ demanded implementation of certain remedial measures.</p><p>Apparently, the parties began negotiating a settlement before the CRIPA lawsuit was filed.  On March 15, 1996, the same day as the complaint was filed, the parties submitted a joint motion for entry of a consent decree.  Under the settlement agreement the defendants agreed to implement all policies, systems, procedures and rules currently in place, to provide quarterly status reports, provide the government access to the facilities, records, patients, and employees of MMHI, and to confer in good faith on the provisions of the consent decree.  Further, the consent decree contained provisions detailing staffing requirements, patient treatment and discharge plans, and non-psychiatric medical care. </p><p>On March 27, 1996, the District Court (Judge Julia S. Gibbons) approved the consent decree, and retained jurisdiction of the action until the consent decree was terminated with respect to all requirements.  And, on May 21, 1997, the Court entered judgment in accordance with the consent decree and terminated the case, retaining jurisdiction for necessary enforcement of the decree.  And, on September 18, 1998, the District Court (Judge Gibbons) granted the parties' joint motion for a stipulation and order, effectuating the consent decree.</p><p>On June 21, 2005, the District Court (Judge Bernice B. Donald) granted the parties' joint motion for an order partially terminating the consent decree and approved the parties' stipulation for supplemental relief.</p><p>We have no more information on this file.</p><p></p>",

As\nyou are aware, we have been investigating conditions at MMHI\nsince December 1990, pursuant to the Civil Rights of\nInstitutionalized Persons Act  (\"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 1997 et sea.\nIn April 1991, we first informed state officials that\nconditions at MMHI, including a lack of professional and direct\ncare staff, posed unreasonable risks to the health and safety of\nMMHI patients in violation of their constitutional rights.  In\nFebruary 1992, we informed you in further detail of the many\nconditions and practices at the facility which were endangering\nthe health and safety of MMHI patients.  Copies of these letters\nare attached for your further information and convenience.\nOur most recent tour of MMHI was completed in June of this\nyear.  Unfortunately, many of the most serious conditions\nidentified throughout the course of our multi-year investigation\nof MMHI still exist.  For example, medical care remains grossly\ndeficient and endangers MMHI patients.  Our expert physician,\nmaking his third visit in as many years to MMHI, determined that\nMMHI patients are denied timely and adequate medical care and  -\nidentified practices that result in harm to patients and are\npotentially life-threatening.\n\n- 2 -\nMedical staff at MMHI fail to appropriately examine ar.d\nassess patients' medical status and needs, fail to interver.e\nto treat patients' serious medical problems, neglect\nlife-threatening medical conditions and often administer\ncontra-indicated medications.  Such practices are inconsistent\nwith generally accepted medical standards or practice.\nPsychiatric care is also critically deficient.  Inadequate\ncare results primarily from an inadequate number of competent\nand qualified psychiatrists.  A high rate of admissions and\ndischarges creates a work load too great for the few\npsychiatrists at MMHI.  Thus, psychiatrists are not adequately\nassessing patients to determine \"their needs, are not sufficiently\ninvolved in developing appropriate, individualized treatment\nplans for patients which address their mental conaTition, and are\nnot adequately involved in providing direct patient care.  As\nwell, treatment programs for patients are inadequate.\nMedication practices at MMHI pose great risks to patients.\nMedications are often administered without sufficient clinical\njustification and absent adequate consideration of the dangerous\nside effects of these medications, given a patients' psychiatric\nand medical status.\nFinally, we determined that mental health patients are being\nprematurely released from the hospital before their psychiatric\ncondition has been stabilized and without appropriate monitoring\nor placement in community programs.  During our June tour we\nreviewed records of patients who were discharged even though\nprofessionals at MMHI indicated in their records that they were\nstill dangerous or not stabilized.  Absent adequate treatment,\nsuch patients are subjected to repeated admissions and discharges\nand a repetitious cycle of harm.  A review of records indicated\nthat recidivism is a significant issue at MMHI due to inadequate\ntreatment.  For example, we noted numerous patients who had\nmultiple admissions to MMHI.  Indeed, we found -- in an extreme\ncase -- that one patient was on his 3 5th inpatient admission.\nOur nursing consultant, also making her third trip to MMHI\nin June, found that nursing services had not improved, but had\ndeteriorated since her last visit to MMHI.  She found that MMHI\nis not adequately staffed to provide therapeutic nursing care\nto its patients.  Nursing care plans are not adequately\nindividualized to reflect the needs of patients and, due to the\nlack of nursing staff, what plans are written are often not\nimplemented.\nIn sum, both medical and psychiatric care at MMHI fail \"to\nmeet constitutional standards.  Patients continue to be subjected\nto harm or unreasonable risks to their health and safety.'\n\n- 3 -\nI hope you find this information helpful in your\nconversations with the Governor-elect.  If anything further\nis needed, please advise me.\nSincerely,\nArthur E. Peabodyr*or.\nChief\nSpecial Litigation Section\nEnclosures",

The  continuation of the \nrestraints each four-hour  period requires  a  new  order by the phyaician.  The \nphysician may  renew the -order one time without reasaessing the patient.  The \nsecond renewal  requires reassessment by the physician. \nD.  The  Nursing  ataff checks the patient' a  pockets  for hazards  a·,-::h  aa matches, \nlighter,  pencils or other aharp objects. \nE.

The patient must  be placed on 1.1 observation with the door opened \nand the technician sitting in the doorway. \n[Follow this Nursing Policy and Procedure  for  locked-door seclusion or restraint.] \n5.  The  RN  initiates a  special Care Record.  Locked-Door  Seclusion or Restraint  (see \nAttachment A).  The  nurse describes the patient's behavior that necessitated the use \nof  restraints,  verbal responses,  the use of the least restrictive mep.ures  and that \npatient was  placed on 1.1.  This entry should be very detailed and descriptive.  A \nnote  is also made  by the nurse in the progress notes stating briefly that the patient \nwas  placed in restraints and  \"aee Special Care Record\". \n6.

Nursing  staff will serve meals  in unbreakable containers,  paper plates and  paper cUF \nto the patient in restraints;  Trays  are not to be  left in the room.  When  removing \narticles,  Nursing  staff should account  for  all items that were  brought  into the \nroo~ \nespeCially utensils. \n\nCase 2:96-cv-02312-BBD     Document 8     Filed 09/18/1998     Page 9 of 10(cid:10)\n'SING SERVICES POLICY AND PROCEDURE MANUAl:  Locked-Door Seclusion or Restraint  (Pege 3) \n11.  Nursing  staff will take vital signs every shift and  prn as  soon  as  the patient de \nescalates  and document  on the blue  sheet. \n12.  The  RN  assesses the patient and documents  on the special Care Record:  Locked-Door \nSeclusion or  Restraint  every two  hours  and  reviews  all previous entries  for \ncompleteness  and  accuracy.  Documentation should reflect specific behaviors, \nresponses,  affect and  the  justification for continued use of restraints. \n13.  The  nurse will administer  routine medicines  and  prn's  as  needed. \n14.  When  the patient  is calmer,  the RN  will explain to the patient the reason as  to why \nlocked-door  seclusion or restraint  occurred. \n15.  The  nurse  has  the discretion of  reducing the number  of points of restraints and \nremoving  the patient  from  locked-door  seclusion or  restraints within the points and \ntime  as  ordered restraint  if this decision is made. \n16.  The  Nursing Supervisor and/or the  Nurse Manager  documents  on the Special Observation \nRecord every eight hours  and reviews  all previous  entries  for completeness  and \naccuracy. \n17.  When  a  patient  is released,  the RN  makes  a  final entry on the Special Observation \nCare Record documenting his/her behavior.  A note  is made  in the progress  notes \nstating that locked-door  seclusion or restraint has  been discontinued. \nAll restraints are to be  removed,  bagged and  sent to Central Medical Supply  (CMS). \nThe  restraint bed  is to be sprayed with disinfectant.  Clean  linens and  restraints \nare to be put on the bed. \nlB.  If the patient is removed  from  locked-door seclusion or restraints but escalates \n(requiring locked-door  seclusion or restraints),  the physician must  give  a  new  order \nand assess the patient within two  (2)  hours. \n19.  If the patient has  shown  a  pattern of aggressive  behavior,  the RN  discusses the \npatient  in unit team staffing.  On  an existing Master Treatment  Plan,  appropriate \nNursing  interventions will be  included. \n20.  The  nurse  reports to the Nursing Office on  the B-hour  reports.  The  carbon of  the \nphysician's order  is stapled to the  B-Hour  Report. \n21.  The  Director of NurSing Services or designee  reports all incidents of patient locked \ndoor  seclusion or restraint to the Superintendent  each day.

      "text": "U.S. v. Tennessee\nMemorandum\nMH-TN-001-001\nJRD:AEP:BPS:VH:drb\nDJ  168-72-0\nSubject Recommendations to Investigate Dale\nMemphis Mental Health Institute NOV 2  I99C\nMemphis, Tennessee\nTo John R. Dunne From -7 Arthur E. Peabody, Jr.\nAssistant Attorney General ft Chief\nCivil Rights Divisionv * Special \"Eltigation Section\nIntroduction\nWe recommend initiation of an investigation into conditions\nof confinement at the Memphis Mental Health Institute (MMHI)\nin Memphis, Tennessee, pursuant to the Civil Rights of\nInstitutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. Section 1997.\nThe information we have obtained indicates that conditions at\nMMHI deprive residents there of their constitutional rights.\nThese conditions include inadequate psychiatric care and\ntreatment, inadequate supervision of patients and neglect caused,\nat least in part, by an inadequate number of professional and\ndirect care staff.  Other allegations suggest general medical\ncare deficiencies, including overuse and misuse of medication,\nand an unsafe and unsanitary environment.  These conditions may\nbe subjecting MMHI residents to undue bodily restraint and undue\nrisks to personal safety as well as denying them of their\nconstitutional rights to adequate medical care and reasonable\nsafety.  Cf. Youngberg v. Romeo. 457 U.S. 307 (1982).\nBackground\nThe Memphis Mental Health Institute is located in northern\nMemphis.  The facility is approximately 27-30 years old and\nserves a population of 160-175 patients.  There are presently 217\nbeds at the facility although there are plans to reduce that\nnumber by 44 beds. 1/ Although currently certified by the Health\nCare Financing Administration  (HCFA), an October 1989 report\nfollowing a review of the facility by HCFA surveyors cited major\nproblems. 2/\n1/  The Commercial Appeal, July 15, 1990, at p.Bl.\n2/  Although MMHI is currently HCFA certified, such certification\ndoes not conclusively determine whether a facility meets\nconstitutional standards.  See Woe v. Cuomo. 729 F.2d 96 (2d Cir.\n1984), cert, denied. 105 S.Ct. 339 (1984).  The HCFA Survey\nReport is dated October 3 0-31, 1989.\n\n- 2 -\nSources of Information\nAllegations regarding alleged inadequate conditions at MMHI\nfirst came to our attention when attorneys traveled to Memphis to\nconduct investigatory activities at the Arlington Developmental\nCenter.  During the course of the Arlington investigation,\nnumerous allegations of grossly inadequate conditions of\nconfinement at MMHI came to our attention.  We obtained further\ninformation from a variety of sources including a 1989 HCFA\nreport of MMHI, interviews with present and former members of the\nstaff at MMHI and parents of MMHI patients and former patients,\nnumerous articles from the local newspaper xn Memphis, documents\nfrom the Alliance for the Mentally 111 (AMI) of Memphis, and\ndocuments from the facility itself from present and former\nemployees.\nInadequate Supervision and Unsafe Environment\nOur information indicates that there are insufficient\nnumbers of qualified professional and direct care staff to\nadequately supervise residents.  Because of these deficiencies,\nMMHI appears to be unable to protect its residents from harm.\nBased on our information, environmental conditions at MMHI also\nendanger the health of residents.\nThe failure to have sufficient numbers of staff has resulted\nin physical harm to patients.  A parent of a former patient told\nus that her daughter was raped and that the facility has been\ntrying to cover up the incident since it occurred. 3/  The\npatient had been admitted to MMHI only a short time before the\nincident.  A local rape crisis center confirmed that the patient\nhad, in fact, been raped.  The patient's mother believes the rape\nto have resulted directly from the inadequate supervision of\npatients due to insufficient staff at MMHI. 4/  The facility did\nnot contact the patient's parents until the day after the\nincident and refused to allow the patient go to a rape crisis\ncenter until after the police intervened in the matter. 5/\nThe sister of another former patient also informed us of a\nsexual incident at the facility. 6/  The source's sister was\n2/  Telephone interview with Joanne Woodford, mother of a former\nMMHI patient, August 30, 199 0.\n4/  Id.\n5/  Id.\n6/  Telephone interview with Diane Billings, sister of a former\npatient at MMHI, August 13, 1990.\n\n- 4 -\nhave been fired due to their own drug abuse and mental illnesses. 15/\nThe shortage of staff members and the lack of training for\nthe facility personnel continue to be primary concerns of our\nsources.  As one source stated, \"MMHI is one of the worst\ninstitutions in the South\" and also that she believes that \"very\nfew patients are actually helped by receiving treatment\nthere.\" 16/  Many of our sources indicated that the staff seems\ninadequately trained to handle even minor situations at the\nfacility and is generally ineffective in helping the\npatients. 17/\nAdditionally, one former employee of MMST told us that he\nwas criticized by the MMHI Joy the administration for being \"too\ninvolved and overly concerned about his patients.\"  Furthermore,\nhe alleges that often patients are intimidated and threatened by\nthe staff and that the overall attitude of the staff toward\npatients is \"deplorable.\" 18/  This source stated that many\nemployees are \"totally insensitive to patient needs and didn't\ntreat patients as people.\" 19/  He also notes that staff members\noften sleep or watch television while on duty and that, at least\nin one unit, patients allegedly find it very easy to buy drugs\nfrom staff members. 2 0/\nStaffing shortages are exacerbated by excessive and\nunnecessary crowding at MMHI.  One source told us that most of\nthe eight units are only able to accommodate 25 patients but\noften have up to 30 patients at one time.  Furthermore, the same\nsource indicated that while some units are overcrowded, often\nother units have extra room but will not \"accept\" patients from\nother units to accommodate the overcrowding, nor will\nadministration move beds to change the cramped conditions on\novercrowded units. 21/\n15/  Telephone interview with Marianne Finely, Effective Advocacy\nfor Citizens with Handicaps, Inc. (EACH) representative at MMHI,\nAugust 14, 1990.\n16/  Telephone interview with Dee Green, mother of a former MMHI\npatient, August 15, 1990.\n17/  Green interview, Billings interview, Woodford interview.\n18/  Telephone interview with Billy Henderson, former MMHI\ntechnician, August 13, 1990.\n19/  Id.\n20/  Id.\n21/  Id.\n\n- 5 -\nOur information suggests that the physical environment at\nMMHI poses health and safety risks to MMHI patients.  The most\nserious allegations involve the failure to maintain sanitary\nconditions.  One source we spoke with indicated that the facility\nis not cleaned on a regular basis.  Also, that source was quite\nconcerned about roach infestation at the facility.  She indicated\nthat when she checks patients at night and turns on the lights in\npatient rooms, she sees roaches \"scurry everywhere.\" 22/  She\nsaid that when food is being served, roaches are visible in the\nrooms and around the tables where patients eat their meals. 23/\nIn sum, serious allegations meriting investigation have been\nraised with respect to the adequacy of staff—and the safety of\nthe general environment.\nInadequate Psychiatric Treatment\n.Beyond the problems already noted resulting from MMHI's\nacute staffing shortages, there is evidence that patients are not\nreceiving adequate psychiatric treatment.  Our sources indicated\nthat a primary problem at MMHI is the lack of adequate treatment\nprograms for patients in that the programs are not individualized\nto meet patient needs. 24/  Further, it is alleged that what\ntreatment programs exist are not monitored to determine whether\nthey are benefitting the patients. 25/  The failure to properly\nreview residents' treatment programs allows patients' drug\nschedules to go unmonitored.  In at least one case, this\napparently resulted in brain damage to one MMHI patient when two\npotent antipsychotic medications were inappropriately used in\ncombination. 26/\nOne source told us that patients who have an acute need to\nbe seen by a psychiatrist have little or no chance of being seen\non a timely basis. 27/  Another source told us patients have\nextremely limited access to physicians and that, for patients,\n\"it is literally impossible to talk to a doctor at the facility.\" 28/\n22/  Collier interview.\n23/  Id.\n24/  Id.\n25/  Id.\n26/  Scott interview.

The mother of a former patient at\nMMHI informed us that her son has possible irreversible brain\ndamage that her son's present doctor has told her is linked to\na dangerous mixture of mind-altering drugs used at the facility. 34/\nThe same source claims that drug schedules are not closely\nmonitored.\nWe were told that there has been at least one death at MMHI\nthat resulted from the mismanagement of drugs.  A current MMHI\nemployee told us that a 15-16 year old patient died in July of\n1989, allegedly after a wrong medication was given the patient by\nan MMHI physician. 35/  Apparently the medication blocked his\nbowels and led to his death.  According to our sources, MMHI\nstaff were told by the administration that if they \"talked\" they\nwould be fired. 3 6/\n29/  Green interview.\n30/  Collier interview.\n31/  Id.\n32/  Collier interview, Scott interview, Woodford interview,\nGreen interview.\n33/  Collier interview.\n34/  Scott interview.\n35/  Scott interview, and telephone interview with Richard Mark,\nMMHI employee, August 20, 1990.\n36/  Mark interview.\n\n- 7 -\nAnother source told us that her son's medication had so\nadversely affected him that he could not sit still, was therefore\ncontinuously walking and, as a result, had lost 25 pounds in one\nmonth.  That same source told us she suspected her son was being\nover-medicated because prior to her son's recent release hearing,\nhe was talking and walking normally, but at the court hearing the\nnext day, her son could not speak or lift his head. 37/\nAnother source reported to us that her son was so heavily\nmedicated that he spent 22 or 23 hours a day in bed during his\n1989 stay at the facility. 38/  These allegations strongly\nsuggest overuse and misus'e\" of psychotropic ffiSdications.\nMoreover, these allegations indicate that insufficient\npsychiatric care is available to avoid unreasonable use of\nchemical restraints.\nConclusion\nOur information indicates that conditions at MMHI are\ndepriving patients of their constitutional rights.  If the\nallegations and information we have received are true, patients\nat MMHI may be being deprived of, inter alia, their right to\nadequate medical care, including psychiatric treatment a\nprofessional would consider reasonable to avoid undue risks to\npersonal safety and unreasonable bodily restraint, reasonably\nsafe conditions of confinement, and freedom from undue\nbodily restraint.  Therefore, we recommend that an investigation\nof Memphis Mental Health Institute be instituted under our CRIPA\nauthority.

      "text": "U.S. Department of Justice\nU.S. v. Tennessee Civil Rights Division\nMH-TN-001-002\nOffice of the Assistant Attorney General Washington, D.C. 20530\nREGISTERED MAIL\nRETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED APR  4\nI99I\nHonorable Ned McWherter\nGovernor of Tennessee\nState Capitol\nGovernor's Office\nNashville, TN  37243\nInterim Findings Letter Regarding Memphis Mental Health\nInstitute. Memphis. Tennessee\nDear Governor McWherter:\nOn December 12, 1990, we informed you that, pursuant to the\nCivil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. §1997 et\nseg., we were commencing an investigation into conditions of\npatient care and treatment at the Memphis Mental Health Institute\n(\"MMHI\") in Memphis, Tennessee.  On February 19 - 21, 1991, the\nDepartment conducted a tour of MMHI with experts in the fields of\npsychiatry and psychiatric nursing.  Our touring team examined\npatient records, interviewed MMHI's superintendent and numerous\nstaff and spoke with patients.  We also reviewed voluminous\ndocuments provided by the facility concerning a wide range of\nactivities and procedures.  During the tour, we were treated\ngraciously by staff from the Department of Mental Health and\nMental Retardation, the Attorney General's office and MMHI.\nEven though our investigation into conditions at MMHI is\nstill ongoing as of the date of this letter, our tour uncovered\ncertain conditions which we believe are violating the\nconstitutional rights of MMHI patients.  For reasons that are\nexplained below, we thought it important to immediately inform\nyou of these conditions.  This letter is, therefore, only an\ninterim finding as the Department's investigation is still\ncontinuing.  At a future date, we will provide you with a letter\nthat will set forth in detail our complete findings and\nsupporting facts.\nInstitutionalized mentally ill persons are constitutionally\nentitled to adequate food, clothing, shelter, medical and nursing\ncare, a reasonably safe environment and such treatment programs\nas an appropriate professional would consider reasonable to..\n\n- 2 -\nensure a patient's safety and freedom from undue bodily and\nchemical restraint.  Cf_. Younqbera v. Romeo. 457 U.S. 307, 324\n(1982).  Staffing deficiencies at MMHI are precluding the full\nenjoyment of.these rights by patients at the facility.\nMMHI does not have a sufficient number of psychiatrists,\nnurses, or psychiatric technicians to provide even minimally\nadequate psychiatric treatment to MMHI patients.  At the time of\nour tour, MMHI had only four psychiatrists providing services to\npatients.  We were told that several psychiatrists had left MMHI\nwithin the past few months.  There are simply too few\npsychiatrists to provide adequate treatment to MMHI patients.\nThe ability of the psychiatrists at MMHI to provide appropriate\ntreatment is further compromised by the fact they are supervising\nnon-psychiatrist physicians who are prescribing psychotropic\nmedications and treating seriously mentally ill patients.\nThere are as well an insufficient number of nurses and\npsychiatric technicians to implement and monitor patient\ntreatment plans or to provide necessary patient supervision and\nensure patient safety.  This has resulted, among other things, in\npatients being subjected to undue physical and chemical restraint\nin violation of the patients' Youngbera rights.\nIt is our understanding that the Tennessee Department of\nMental Health and Retardation is planning to cut 24 direct\npatient service positions at MMHI as of July 1, 1991.  As stated\nabove, we found the current complement and ratio of professional,\nnursing and direct care staff to the patient population at MMHI\nto be insufficient.  Further cuts in staff will exacerbate these\nshortages that already result in conditions that are depriving\npatients of their constitutional rights.  In sum, additional  —\nnot fewer -- staff are required at MMHI.\nAt a future date we will provide you with our complete\nfindings and supporting facts regarding conditions or practices\nat MMHI which violate the constitutional rights of the patients\nthere, along with the minimal remedial measures that may be\nrequired to correct those conditions.\nAgain, we appreciate the cooperation extended to us during\nthe initial stages of our CRIPA investigation of MMHI.  I hope\nand trust that this cooperation will continue.\nJohn R. Dunne\nfistant Attorney General\nCivil Rights Division",

      "text": "U.S. Department of Justice\nCivil Rights Division\nOffice of the Assistant Attorney  General Washington. D.C. 20530\nU.S. v. Tennessee\nMH-TN-001-003\nFebruary  6, 1992\nREGISTERED  HAIL\nRETURN  RECEIPT  REQUESTED\nHonorable Ned McWherter\nGovernor of Tennessee\n.State Capitol\n' Governor's Office\nNashville, TN 37243\nRe:  Findings Letter Regarding Memphis Mental Health\nInstitute, Memphis. Tennessee\nDear Governor McWherter:\nOn December 12, 1990, we informed you that, pursuant to the\nCivil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act  (\"CRIPA\"), 42\nU.S.C. § 1997 et seq., we were commencing an investigation into\nconditions relating to patient care and treatment at the Memphis\nMental Health Institute (\"MMHI\") in Memphis, Tennessee.  As\nspecified by CRIPA, we are now writing to inform you of our\nconclusions that the conditions at MMHI deprive patients there of\ntheir constitutional rights.  We also outline the minimum\nmeasures we believe necessary to remedy those unconstitutional\nconditions.  Finally, in the Attachment to this letter, we set\nforth the facts supporting the findings of constitutional\nviolations.  •\nBased on our extensive investigation, we conclude that\nconditions at MMHI deprive patients of their constitutional\nrights to adequate medical care and sAich treatment as an\nappropriate professional would consider reasonable to ensure\ntheir safety and freedom from undue bodily and chemical\nrestraints.  Cf.. Youngberg v. Romeo. 457 U.S. 307, 324  (1982).\n\n- 2 -\nAs you will recall, on April 4, 1991, following our  initial\ntours at MMKI, we informed you in\" writing that.MMHI was\nsubjecting its patients to grossly substandard psychiatric care\nand treatment caused, in significant part, by the failure to\nprovide a sufficient number of staff, including psychiatrists,\nnurses and psychiatric technicians.  In our letter, we\nspecifically requested reconsideration of the State's decision to\ncut 24 staff positions at MMHI.  By letter dated May 22, 1991,\nyou responded to our findings by stating, among other things,\nthat the State was studying this issue.  No further response has\nbeen received.  We subsequently learned that 24 -staff positions\nat MMHI were' cut.  While we further understand that the unit\ncovered by these 24 positions was ultimately closed, these cuts\nhave exacerbated staffing shortages at the facility.  The lack of\na sufficient number of adequately trained staff contributes\nsubstantially to the unconstitutional conditions we find at MMHI.\nWe have identified the following conditions and practices\nwhich we believe violate the constitutional rights of MMKI\npatients:\n1)  Failure to provide patients with adequate general and\nemergency medical care;\n2)  Inadequate psychiatric care and medication practices\nincluding:\na)  Lack of psychiatric staff;\nb)  Dangerous medication regimens; and\nc)  Inadequate development and implementation of\nindividualized treatment plans.\n3)  Improper and excessive use of physical restraints,\nincluding restraining patients in locked-door  seclusion\nrooms without adequate supervision.\nThese deficiencies subject patients at MMHI to harm, both\npotential and real.  ,\nIn order to eliminate the egregious or- flagrant conditions\nthat deprive MMHI residents of their constitutional rights, the\nfollowing measures, at a minimum, must be implemented:\n1)  MMHI must hire and deploy a sufficient number of\nqualified direct care and professional staff, including\npsychiatrists, psychologists, registered nurses and psychiatric\ntechnicians, to ensure that patients receive adequate medical and\npsychiatric care, including the development and implementation of\nindividualized patient treatment plans;\n\n- 3 -\n2)  MMHI must institute improvements in its medication\npractices, including monitoring medications and medication\ninteractions and side-effects, to remedy departures from  accepted\nprofessional standards;\n3)  MMHI must improve its medical health care delivery\nsystem to ensure that patients have timely access to adequate\nemergency and general medical care;\n4)  Restraints must be employed only pursuant to the\nexercise of professional judgment by a qualified professional.\nThe practice of using restraint for the convenience of staff  or\nin lieu of adequate staffing or 'the implementation of treatment\nprograms must cease immediately.  The practice of  restraining\npatients and then placing patients in a locked-door  seclusion\nroom must cease immediately.  Patients must be released  from\n/seclusion as soon as their physical and mental condition will\nallow for safe release;\n5)  MMHI must institute recordkeeping practices that will\nensure documentation sufficient to enable staff to render\nprofessional judgments as to medical, psychiatric,  psychological\nand nursing treatment services; and\n6)  MMHI must immediately halt the practice of using\nuntrained unit clerks as psychiatric technicians.\nTo remedy the deficiencies at MMHI and to ensure that\nconstitutionally  adequate conditions are maintained  thereafter,\nwe propose, as an amicable resolution of this matter and based\nupon the principles of conciliation and negotiation embodied  in\nCRIPA, to negotiate an agreement with the State of Tennessee to\nbe entered as an order of a federal court.  Any such  agreement\nshall provide, at a minimum, that the above referenced  remedies\nbe implemented at MMHI.\nWe suggest you contact the appropriate regional office of\nthe Departments of Health and Human Services and the  Department\nof Education to ensure that the State is maximizing its use of\nfederal financial assistance  assistance that may be utilized\nto correct the deficiencies  identified  in this letter.\nOur attorneys will be contacting  legal counsel for the\nTennessee Department of Mental Health and Mental  Retardation\nshortly to discuss this matter in greater detail.  In the\nmeantime, should you or your staff have any questions  regarding\n\n- 4 -\nthis matter, please feel free to .call Arthur E. Peabody, Jr.,\nChief, Special Litigation Section, at (202) 514-6255.  We\ncontinue to hope and trust that this matter can be resolved in an\namicable manner.\nSincerely,\nJohn R. Dunne\nAsvci4tant Attorney General\n\"Civil Rights Division\ncc:  Honorable Charles Burson\nAttorney General\nState of Tennessee\nMr. Evelyn C. Robertson, Jr.\nDirector\nDepartment of Mental Health and\nMental Retardation\nMr. Walter Diggs\nSuperintendent\nMemphis Mental Health Institute\nEd Bryant, Esq.\nUnited States Attorney\nWestern District of Tennessee •\nMr. Anthony Tirone\nDirector ~  . . . •\nOffice of Survey and Certification\nHealth Care Financing Administration\n\n- 5 -\nATTACHMENT\nFACTS SUPPORTING FINDINGS OF CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATIONS\nOur investigation consisted of three separate tours of MMHI\nwith four expert consultants:  a psychiatrist, a psychiatric\nnurse, a psychologist, and a physician.  We observed conditions\non the various patient units, interviewed administrators, staff\nand patients and examined a variety of records concerning a wide\nrange of facility operations. -Throughout \"the investigation, we\nwere treated graciously and received complete cooperation from\nthe administrators and staff of MMHI and from attorneys of the\nDepartment of Mental Health and Retardation.\nThe following paragraphs set forth the facts supporting our\nfindings.\n1.  Failure to provide patients with adequate general and\nemergency medical care and nursing care.\nMajor deficiencies exist in the medical care delivery system\nat MMHI, including the inability to recognize and treat\nlife-threatening or dangerous medical conditions, deficient\nfollow-up of recognized problems, inadequate physical\nexaminations, including inadequate neurological examinations,\ndeficient interpretations of abnormal laboratory findings,\ndeficient formulation of medical treatment plans and deficient\nmedical recordkeeping.\nMany of the deficiencies in medical services can be traced\ndirectly to inadequate numbers of trained staff.  Specifically,\nit is our consultant physician's opinion that MMHI staff are not\nadequately trained to recognize the serious medical needs of\npatients.  As a result, patient ailments or illnesses can\ndeteriorate to the point where such conditions become life\nthreatening.\nDeficiencies in the medical care, service delivery system at\nMMHI have resulted in physical harm -DO MMHI. patients.  Our\nmedical consultant believes such deficiencies may have\ncontributed to the deaths of two MMHI patients.  His review of\nthese charts suggests that MMHI staff members failed to recognize\nthe severity of these patients' worsening conditions prior to the\ntime such conditions presented medical emergencies.  Furthermore,\nvarious members of the nursing and medical staffs we interviewed\nwere unfamiliar with \"crash cart\" emergency medical equipment.\nSome of MMHI's emergency equipment was also faulty.\n\n— 6 —\nMMHI's physicians are not proficient, trained or certified\nin advanced cardiac life support;  In reviewing code blue calls\nfor the previous six months, our consultant physician notes\nnumerous examples of inadequate responses.  In one instance, the\ncode blue physician failed to arrive until 16 minutes after the\ncode blue was called.  In other instances, physicians failed to\ninstitute even the most basic life saving measures, such as the\nadministration of oxygen or intravenous fluids, when the\npatient's condition required such treatment.  It is our\nconsultant's opinion that, in at least one instance, poor\nresponse to a code blue call contributed to a patient's death.\nSignificantly, while touring MMHI we observed staff\nparticipating in an unscheduled code blue exercise in which the\nhospital administrator played the role of a patient who had\nsuffered a seizure and was'aspirating.  The MMHI response team\n-made several serious mistakes.  First, hospital operators\nannounced the code blue as taking place on the wrong unit,  :\nresulting in a delay in the arrival of the code blue team.\nSecond, the nursing staff who were instituting basic life support\nfailed to take appropriate action to establish an adequate airway\nin the victim's throat.  If the exercise had been a real\nemergency, the \"victim\" \"might have suffered serious brain damage\nor even death.\nResources and expertise to provide general medical care are\nlikewise deficient.  MMHI lacks a sufficient number of registered\nnurses to provide adequate, professional nursing care to\npatients.  Current nurse staffing is inadequate to provide\nnecessary patient assessments, treatment planning, supervision\nand evaluation of patients' conditions, including any untoward\nchange in patients7 conditions.  Further, although MMHI does have\nin place a policy relating to severity of illness and assignment\nof staff accordingly, which includes adult service minimum safe\nstaffing standards, MMHI was unable to meet its own recognized\nminimum safe standards for the several weeks before our\nconsultant nurse's tour.  Nurse staffing appears to be based on\nthe number of positions approved by the State rather than on any\nsystem related to patient need.\ni\nThe ratio of registered nursing 'to non.-registered nursing\npatient care positions at MMHI  (27% to 73%)' is inadequate to\nprovide for appropriate supervision of the non-licensed direct\ncare staff.  This ratio is an especially critical deficiency at\nMMHI given that psychiatric technicians  (PTs) at MMHI are hired\nwithout any previous psychiatric background and often receive\nonly \"on the job\" training.  We find instances where psychiatric\ntechnicians are hired and assigned to patient wards without -~\nprevious psychiatric experience and without receiving MMHI's own\n120-hour PT training program.  This is particularly dangerous\ngiven that inadequately trained staff are responsible for placing\npatients in restraints.\n\n- 7 -\nWe also find that MMHI is using untrained ward clerks  —\nessentially clerical personnel —  as substitute PTs on night\nshifts.  This practice must stop immediately because unit clerks\nhave absolutely no training in providing psychiatric nursing\ncare.\nMMHI's policies and procedures regarding the identification,\ntreatment and follow-up of active medical problems are\ninadequate.  Moreover, MMHI's infectious disease/isolation\npractices are so deficient as to threaten the health and safety\nof MMHI patients.  Our consultant finds practices in the areas of\nthe prevention of hepatitis transmission, HIV precautions,\ntuberculosis screening, and immunization to be especially\nproblematic.\nIn addition, neurologic exams performed by MMHI staff are\n• grossly inadequate.  Only the most basic and rudimentary exams\nare performed.  There is no systematic evaluation for the extra-\npyramidal side effects of psychotropic medications.  It is our\nconsultant's opinion that the neurological exams performed at\nMMHI represent a significant departure from accepted practice in '\nthat they provide neither an accurate assessment of neurological\nfunction nor an evaluation for medication side effects.\nMedical recordkeeping at MMHI is also inadequate.\nPhysicians' findings, assessments, and plans are not adequately\ndocumented.  From a review of the records, it is often impossible\nto determine if a physician actually examines a given patient or\nmerely observes the patient from a distance.  There are also\nindications in patient records that suggest that physician and\nnursing notes are written at a later date, backdated, and\ninserted into the medical record without being clearly identified\nas such.  While we do not, at the moment, ascribe any improper\nmotive to these backdated records, such a practice is clearly not\nin keeping with accepted standards of practice.\n2.  Inadequate psychiatric care and medication practices,\na.  Lack of psychiatric staff.\nThe lack of professional resources, including appropriate\nstaffing, results in the failure to provide' constitutionally\nadequate psychiatric care and treatment.  Simply put, there are\ntoo few psychiatrists at MMHI to provide necessary care and\ntreatment to patients.  During the time of our psychiatrist's\nvisit, there were only four psychiatrists providing service to\napproximately 170 patients.  This psychiatrist-to-patient ratio\nis woefully inadequate —  especially in light of the severe\npsychiatric conditions of MMHI patients.\n\n- 8 -\nb.  Dangerous medication reainens.\nA major problem resulting from the shortage of psychiatrists\nat MMHI is that non-psychiatric trained physicians prescribe\npsychotropic medications and attempt to provide psychiatric care\nwithout adequate supervision by trained psychiatrists.  As a\nresult, many aspects of drug usage at MMHI represent substantial\ndepartures from generally accepted medical standards.  For\nexample, a review of records reveals numerous instances where\npatients are misdiagnosed or exposed to inappropriate dosages of\ndrugs used in the treatment of mental illness and dangerous drug\ninteractions'. • Other patients are subjected to both inappropriate\ndrug combinations and physical restraint, or treated for\npsychiatric symptoms when their illnesses have organic origins.\nWe also note patients who are started on abnormally large doses\nof potent medications without any justification in the patients'\n.records.  Deficiencies of this kind are aggravated by the\n'inadequacy of MMHI's policies and practices pertaining to the\nmonitoring of drug side effects.  Adverse medication reactions/\nare, by MMHI's admission, underreported.\nc.  Inadequate development and implementation of\nindividualized treatment plans.\nWe find consistent evidence that MMHI patients are not\nreceiving individualized treatment based on plans designed to\nmeet specific patient needs.  This is especially true of, and a\ncritical deficiency for, patients who exhibit aggressive\nbehaviors and patients who are in need of behaviorally-oriented\nprogramming.  The development of such a plan —  and its\nconsistent implementation —  is central to the provision of\nprofessionally-based psychiatric care.  Such a planning process\nrequires sufficient staff to collect data, observe the outcome of\ninterventions, coordinate the results, and, if necessary, re-\nformulate the plan.  MMHI does not have sufficient staff\navailable to perform these necessary treatment functions.  We\nfind examples of patients who have certain problems identified in\nan initial screening, but whose treatment plan fails to address\nthem.\nConsequently, MMHI patients are subjected to the possibility\nof increased hospital stays due to lack of progress, increased\nexposure to risk of harm from the patients' own illnesses or from\nother patients' illnesses, and the-continued exposure to the\nside-effects of medications.\nProgress notes are also not properly maintained.  If a\npatient has more than one psychiatric problem, notes are written\nin such a manner that it is often not clear which problem a given\nnote might be addressing.  Other notes are often so vague as to\nbe worthless.\n\n- 9 -\n3.  Misuse and excessive use of physical restraints,\nincluding restraining pa~tients in locked-door seclusion\nrooms.\nPatients at MMHI are subjected to both an undue amount of\nbodily restraint and dangerous restraint practices.  It is the\nconsensus of our consultants that the lack of adequate staffing\nand the failure to develop and consistently implement treatment\nplans have led MMHI staff to resort to inappropriate and\nexcessive restraint practices in order to control patients.\nThe routine practice at MMHI is to put patients into five-\npoint restraints  (a practice where a patient is restrained on a\nbed and bound by the ankles, by the wrists with the arms to the\nside, and by a strap across.the waist) and to place them into a\nlocked seclusion room.  Monitoring is done via closed circuit\n,-television and the monitors are located in a separate hallway\noutside the nurses' station.\nThis practice is inappropriate and dangerous.  Indeed, •\nsuch a practice can seldom, if ever, be justified.  When asked\nwhy a patient in a five-point restraint is also locked in a room,\nMMHI staff consistently reply that it is to protect the\nrestrained patient from possible injury from other patients.  The\nprotection of a patient from other patients is not an acceptable\nrationale for placing a restrained patient into a locked room.  A\npatient so restrained and secluded is at great risk of harm.\nThere are myriad health and safety related problems that\nrestrained patients can experience —  including choking and\nasphyxiation —  and the risk of harm is only increased when, as\nhere, the patients are locked up and not under direct observation\nof staff.\nFurther, staff members are placing patients inappropriately\nin physical restraints simply because they are confused or\ndisoriented.  For example, patients are placed in restraints for\n\"confusion,\" \"getting out of bed,\" \"tumbling, ataxia  [muscular\nincoordination], and being unable to care for self needs,\" and\n\"disrobing, stumbling and not following directions.\"  These are\nnot professionally justifiable reasons for subjecting patients to\nrestraints.  '\nWe also note numerous instances where patients are kept in\nrestraints for longer than what appears warranted by professional\njudgment.  For example, patients are placed into five-point\nrestraints, then released from a portion of those restraints to\neat a meal or for some other purpose, then placed back into the\nfive-point restraint.  In general, if a patient is calm enough to\neat a meal, putting the patient back into full, five-point\nrestraint after eating without restraints —  an indication that\nthe patient is calm —is unnecessary and excessive.  We also find\n\n-10-\nincidents where a patient is reported as \"very sedated\" and\n\"confused,\" during times when he-is in restraint.  Restraining a\nsedated patient is a substantial departure from accepted\nstandards of psychiatric care.\nPhysicians' notes often do not justify why a given restraint\nis necessary.  MMHI has no separate policy concerning the use of\nrestraints on patients with medical illnesses.  Finally, it does\nnot appear from the documentation that staff are consistently\noffering patients fluids or toileting while patients are in\nrestraints.\nOur consultants conclude that the excessive reliance on\nrestraints is due to a lack of sufficient numbers of adequately\ntrained staff.  Too few psychiatrists and other professional and\ndirect care staff translates into a failure to provide and\n'implement individualized treatment plans, which, in turn, results\nin over-reliance on restraints to control behavior.  The lack of\nappropriate training of staff results in patients remaining in\nrestraints longer than professionally justifiable or being\nrestrained unnecessarily.  As well, the failure to properly\nmonitor patients in restraints is due to insufficient numbers of\ndirect care staff to provide such monitoring.\nIn sum, based on the above stated findings, MMHI residents\nare subjected to egregious and flagrant conditions that deprive\nthem of their constitutional rights pursuant to a pattern and\npractice of resistance to the full enjoyment of those rights.",

This case was instituted by the United States on\nMarch 15, 1996, pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized\nPersons Act (\"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 1997 et sea.\n2.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. § 1345.\n3.  Venue is appropriate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b).\n4.  The United States is authorized to institute this civil\naction by 42 U.S.C. § 1997a, and has met all the prerequisites\nfor the institution of this civil action prescribed by the\nstatute.\n5.  The Defendants are the State of Tennessee; the Honorable\nDon Sundquist, Governor of the State of Tennessee; Marjorie Nelle\nCardwell, Commissioner of the Department of Mental Health and\nMental Retardation; and Elizabeth A. Banks, Superintendent,\nMemphis Mental Health Institute (\"MMHI\"), who are sued in their\nrespective official capacities.\n\n6.  The individual Defendants are officers of the Executive\nDepartment of the State of Tennessee who have authority and\nresponsibility for the operation of MMHI.\n7.  On December 12, 1990, the Attorney General of the United\nStates, through the Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights\nDivision, notified the Governor of Tennessee, the Attorney\nGeneral and Reporter of Tennessee  (the \"Attorney General\"), the\nCommissioner of Mental Health and Mental Retardation (the\n\"Commissioner\"), and the Superintendent of MMHI (the\n\"Superintendent\") of his intent to investigate allegations of\nunconstitutional conditions at MMHI pursuant to CRIPA.\n8.  Following the United States' initial investigation tour,\nthe Attorney General of the United States, by and through the\nAssistant Attorney General, Civil Rights Division, on April 4,\n1991, notified the Governor of Tennessee, the Attorney General,\nthe Commissioner, and the Superintendent that he had determined\nthat certain conditions at MMHI  (i.e.. the lack of professional\nand direct care staff) were depriving persons residing in or\nconfined to MMHI of their constitutional rights.\n9.  Following further tours and a thorough investigative\neffort of MMHI, on February 6, 1992, the Attorney General of the\nUnited States, by and through the Assistant Attorney General,\nCivil Rights Division, notified the Governor, the Attorney\nGeneral, the Commissioner, and the Superintendent that he had\ndetermined that numerous conditions in addition to those listed\n- 2 -\n\nin Paragraph 8 were depriving persons residing in or confined to\nMMHI of their constitutional rights.\n10.  The parties agree that the care, conditions of\nconfinement, and the treatment of MMHI residents implicate rights\nof these residents that are secured or protected by the\nConstitution of the United States.  The parties entering into\nthis Consent Decree recognize these rights and, for the purpose\nof avoiding protracted and adversarial litigation, agree to the\nprovisions set forth herein.  This Consent Decree provides for\nactions, practices, and procedures that the State has agreed to\nimplement.\n11.  Each and every provision of this Decree is entered into\nby clear agreement of the parties, after lengthy and thorough\nnegotiations.\n12.  In entering into this Consent Decree, the Defendants do\nnot admit any violation of law, and this Consent Decree may not\nbe used as evidence of liability in any other legal proceeding.\n13.
