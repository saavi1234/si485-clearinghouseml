    "summary": "<p>On July 1, 1994, the Department of Justice (DOJ) sent a letter to the Governor of Virginia under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 1997, indicating an intention to investigate conditions at the Northern Virginia Mental Health Institute (NVMHI) in Falls Church, Virginia.  In the letter, the government indicated an intention to investigate conditions at the facility including the adequacy of medical care, psychiatric care, staffing, and the use of physical and chemical restraints.</p><p>Shortly after a document request on August 19, 1994, with which staff at NVMHI did comply, attorneys for Virginia informed DOJ they had decided not to grant access to the facility.  At a meeting on January 31, 1995, representatives from Virginia again denied the DOJ access to NVMHI.  And at a follow-up meeting on February 14, 1995, they refused to grant DOJ access to the facility for a third time.  In a March 17, 1995, letter, the representatives from Virginia informed DOJ access might be granted by the end of the year provided it accepted numerous demands, including accepting Virginia's views regarding other unresolved investigations.</p><p>On April 20, 1995, DOJ sent a findings letter to the Governor.  In the findings letter, the government outlined Virginia's unacceptable refusal to cooperate and facts indicating that conditions at the facility deprived NVMHI patients of their constitutional rights and violated the American with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794, the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1395i, and various implementing regulations for those statutes.  Specifically, DOJ found inadequate mental health care, inadequate staffing, inadequate medical care and dangerous medication practices, failure to protect patients from harm, inadequate physical conditions.  DOJ further outlined minimum remedial measures required to bring NVMHI into compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.</p><p>Apparently, in June 1995, just before a meeting between the United States Attorney General and the Attorney General of Virginia, Virginia submitted a Continuous Improvement Plan and finally agreed to allow DOJ to inspect the facility.  That inspection took place on July 25-27, 1995.</p><p>On April 3, 1996, DOJ sent a supplemental findings letter to the Governor.  In the letter, DOJ outlined continued violations at NVMHI respecting (a) inadequate mental health care, discharge planning, and community services, (b) deficient staffing and staff supervision, (c) inadequate medical care and medication practices, (d) inadequate protection from harm, (e) inappropriate use of restraints and seclusion, (f) unsafe physical conditions, and (g) inadequate quality assurance and recordkeeping.  As in the April 20, 1995, letter, DOJ again outlined minimum remedial measures required to bring NVMHI into compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.</p><p>We have no more information on this file and thus do not know what measures, if any, NVMHI took to address the issues.</p><p></p>",

Patrick  Arthur E. Peabody, Jr.\nTo   From\n0 Assistant Attorney General  c  Chief\nCivil Rights Division  V-  Special Litigation Section\nRECOMMENDATION\nWe recommend sending the attached supplemental findings\nletter to the Commonwealth of Virginia pursuant to the Civil\nRights of Institutionalized Persons Act  (\"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1997 e_t seq. , regarding our investigation of the Northern\nVirginia Mental Health Institute  (\"NVMHI\").\nWe were initially denied access to the facility, and, as a\nresult, our April 20, 1995 letter of findings was issued without\nthe benefit of an on-site investigation.  In June 1995, just\nprior to a meeting between Attorney General Reno and Virginia\nAttorney General Gilmore, the Commonwealth finally agreed to\nallow a Justice Department inspection of the facility.  That\ninspection took place on July 25-27, 1995.  During the\ninspection, Justice Department experts in the areas of\npsychiatry, psychology, and psychiatric nursing reviewed\ndocuments, interviewed staff, interviewed patients, and toured\nthe facility.\nThe result of our on-site investigation is a finding that\nconditions at the NVMHI continue to deprive NVMHI patients of\ntheir constitutional rights and violate the Americans with\nDisabilities Act  (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et sea., and ADA\nimplementing regulations.\nThese continuing violations should be considered in light of\nthis investigation's long history.  Our April 20, 1995 letter\npreviously cited the Commonwealth for deficiencies in the\nfollowing areas:  1) mental health treatment; 2) staffing;\n3) medical care; 4) medication practices; 5) protection of\npatients from harm; and 6) physical plant.\nIn response to our findings, the Commonwealth submitted a\n\"Continuous Improvement Plan\" on June 7, 1995.  This Continuous\nImprovement Plan details a number of reforms which the\nCommonwealth assured us were in the process of being implemented.\nAt the time of our tour, many of the Commonwealth's self-imposed\ndeadlines for implementing reforms had either passed or were fast\n\n- 2 -\napproaching.  Yet, our inspection revealed continued\nconstitutional violations regarding matters previously identified\nin our April 20 letter and supposedly addressed by the\nCommonwealth's Continuous Improvement Plan.  This fact suggests\nthat the Commonwealth is either unable or unwilling to rectify\ninstitutional deficiencies on its own.  The proposed findings\nletter puts the Commonwealth on notice of the continuing\nviolations and gives them two weeks to respond to our findings\nand indicate a willingness to enter into a consent decree to\nremedy the conditions that violate NVMHI patients' constitutional\nand federal statutory rights.\nThis proposed supplemental findings letter, as well as our\nfirst findings letter, contains our conclusion that the\nCommonwealth is violating NVMHI patients' rights under the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et. seq.  We\nhave conferred with Philip Breen, Special Counsel to the\nDisability Rights Section, who concurs with our including this\nviolation.\nAttachments\nApproved:\nDisapproved:\nComments:\n\nU.S. Department of Justice\nCivil Rights Division\nOffice of the Assistant Attorney  General  Ubshington,  D.C.  20035\nApril 3, 1996\nThe Honorable George Allen\nGovernor of Virginia\nCommonwealth Capitol Building\nNinth & Grace Streets\nRichmond, VA  23212\nDear Governor Allen:\nOn July 1, 1994, we notified you of our intent to\ninvestigate the Northern Virginia Mental Health Institute\n(\"NVMHI\" or \"Institute\") pursuant to the Civil Rights of\nInstitutionalized Persons Act  (\"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 1997 et seq.\nWe were initially denied acces's to the facility, and, as a\nresult, our April 20, 1995 letter of findings was issued without\nthe benefit of an on-site investigation.  In June 1995, just\nprior to a meeting between Attorney General Reno and Virginia\nAttorney General Gilmore, the Commonwealth finally agreed to\nallow a Justice Department inspection of the facility.  That\ninspection took place on July 25-27, 1995.  During the\ninspection, Justice Department experts in the areas of\npsychiatry, psychology, and psychiatric nursing reviewed\ndocuments, interviewed staff, interviewed patients, and toured\nthe facility.  Your staff was cooperative during the tour, and we\nappreciate the assistance they provided.\nWe are now writing to advise you of our supplemental\nfindings, based on the on-site inspection, that conditions at the\nNVMHI continue to deprive NVMHI patients of their constitutional\nrights and violate the Americans with Disabilities Act  (\"ADA\"),\n42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 e_t seq. , and the ADA'S implementing\nregulations.\nThese continuing violations should be considered in light of\nthis investigation's long history.  Our April 20, 1995 letter\npreviously cited the Commonwealth for deficiencies in the\nfollowing areas:  1) mental health treatment; 2) staffing;\n3) medical care; 4) medication practices; 5) protection of\npatients from harm; and 6) physical plant.  In response to our\nfindings, the Commonwealth submitted a \"Continuous Improvement\n\n- 2 -\nPlan\"  (\"Continuous Improvement Plan\" or \"Plan\") on June 7, 1995.\nThis Continuous Improvement Plan details a number of reforms\nwhich the Commonwealth assured us were in the process of being\nimplemented.  At the time of our tour, many of the Commonwealth's\nself-imposed deadlines for implementing reforms had either passed\nor were fast approaching.  Yet, our inspection revealed continued\nconstitutional violations regarding matters previously identified\nin our April 20, 1995 letter and supposedly addressed by the\nCommonwealth's Continuous Improvement Plan.\nMore specifically, our supplemental findings are as follow:\nI.  Inadequate mental health care, discharge planning, and\ncommunity services.\nThe Commonwealth's Continuous Improvement Plan identifies\nremedial measures NVMHI has developed to address our earlier\nfindings and to improve care and treatment at the Institute.\nSection A of the Continuous Improvement Plan calls for\n\"appropriate, comprehensive individualized treatment\" based on\nadequate evaluations and multidisciplinary assessments.  Our\nconsultants found that the Commonwealth has been unable to meet\nmany of the Plan's key elements and that the treatment process at\nNVMHI remains inadequate.  From the point of admissions to the\npoint of discharge, the inadequate mental health care provided at\nthe facility increases the risk of -harm to patients, fails to\nprovide them with a reasonable opportunity to be cured and\nfunction as independently as their psychiatric conditions permit,\nand violates professional standards.\nThe Continuous Improvement Plan promises that \"... NVMHI\nwill evaluate and assess each patient consistent with generally\naccepted professional standards to develop an appropriate,\naccurate diagnosis....  A new assessment process will be\ndeveloped by an interdisciplinary team and will be piloted in the\nadmissions suite for all new admissions.\"  Accepted professional\nstandards require that psychological evaluations be part of this\nassessment.  In the last year, however, only about 10 percent of\nNVMHI patients received psychological assessments at the point of\nadmission.  The failure to provide psychological assessments is\nespecially troubling because NVMHI recently assured the Health\nCare Financing Administration that staff would provide all\npatients with such assessments by July 1, 1995.  NVMHI clearly\nhas not met its own deadline; since at the time of our visit, at\nleast eight individuals admitted in July had not received a\npsychological assessment as part of the admissions process.  Even\nfor patients who repeatedly engage in maladaptive behaviors, the\nfacility fails to complete a psychological assessment or develop\nan adequate behavioral plan.  For example, one patient had a\nseries of self-abusive injuries, but received no psychological\nassessment or intervention.  Psychological assessments, even when\ndone, are often inadequate.  Assessments reiterate symptoms\n\n- 3 -\nwithout providing any suggested psychological interventions.\nImportant considerations, such as prior hospitalizations and\nfamily background, are not adequately explored.  Our expert\nconsultants found patient diagnoses that bore no relationship to\nsymptoms identified in the few assessments conducted.\nSection A of the Commonwealth's Continuous Improvement Plan\nalso requires that NVMHI \"... provide each of its patients an\nappropriate, comprehensive, individualized treatment program\nbased on  [a] history and physical examination, psychiatric\nevaluations, and multidisciplinary assessments designed to\nmaximize each patient's opportunity for recovery and integration\ninto full community life.\"  In reality, patient treatment is not\nappropriate, multidisciplinary, individualized, or properly\nmanaged in accordance with accepted professional standards.\nTreatment planning is inadequate.  There is little or no evidence\nof multidisciplinary thinking in treatment planning, and patients\nhave little involvement in the process.  The process is so\ndisorganized that our expert consultants were unable to ascertain\nwhat the treatment plans are meant to accomplish.  Records show\nthat staff are providing treatment without an adequate\nunderstanding of the patient's problems.  Treatment goals are too\nvague and fail to provide an objective, measurable basis for\ngauging patient progress.  Treatment objectives refer to such\nmatters as whether a patient has attended his \"groups,\" rather\nthan substantive issues involving patient functioning.  Treatment\nplanning is not individualized.  Although patients attend classes\nor \"groups,\" many of the supposedly \"individualized\" treatment\nschedules are actually standard, preprinted forms that have\nlittle to do with the needs of the patient.  For example, some\npatients who need to avoid excessive stimulus are assigned to\ngroup therapy even though such therapy is contraindicated by\nprofessional standards.  Similarly, NVMHI has patients who are\nmentally retarded; yet their needs are not met and -they are\ninappropriately placed at NVMHI.\nTreatment is also not adequately coordinated between\ndisciplines.  In particular, master treatment and nursing care\nplans are inconsistent.  Additionally, nursing care plans suffer\nsimilar defects to treatment plans.  For instance, initial\nnursing care plans are not individualized.  Patients are placed\nin categories, and then all patients in the same category receive\nthe same rote nursing care plan without adequate regard to their\nindividual needs.  Thus, one nursing care plan made no mention of\na patient's epilepsy, and another plan failed to address a\npatient's spastic colon.  Because standardized forms are used,\npatient problems which are not on the forms, such as sleep and\neating disturbances, are not addressed by nursing care plans.\nThe defective treatment process results in patients not\nreceiving a reasonable opportunity to be cured and function as\nwell as possible.  NVMHI policies do not require completion of\n\n- 4 -\nindividualized, comprehensive treatment plans until ten days have\npassed, which is a substantial period of the time that patients\nstay at NVMHI.  The average length of stay at NVMHI is\napproximately 40-50 days, an exceptionally long period for\nstabilizing patients in an acute care hospital.  The treatment\nprocess has built-in delays which prevent prompt treatment and\nsubsequent discharge of patients.  For example, the first review\nof a patient's stay does not occur until 21 days after admission.\nThis built-in delay means the system is inherently tilted in\nfavor of excessively long, and often unnecessarily protracted,\nhospitalizations.  This unnecessary delay places patients at\ngreat risk of harm.\nBehavioral management planning is also grossly inadequate\nand reflects the general absence of adequate psychology services\nat NVMHI.  Of the records reviewed, our expert psychologist found\nonly one patient with recurrent self-injury who had even been\nsent to a psychologist for behavioral management planning.  This\npatient's behavioral plan was not established until nine months\nafter her admission and occurred at the same time hospital staff\ntook the extreme measure of having her arrested for assaulting a\nstaff person.  A token economy plan was subsequently put in place\nfor this patient, but it was not based on any recorded behavioral\nanalysis, psychological exam, or appraisal of baseline\nfunctioning.\n~J» -\nThe Continuous Improvement Plan assures that \"Discharge\nplanning will continue to be appropriately carried out for all\npatients who are discharged from the Institute.\"  Instead, our\nconsultants found that NVMHI's discharge planning is inadequate\nand violates professional standards.  The discharge planning\nfails to ensure that appropriate professional judgments about the\nmost integrated setting appropriate to meet each patient's needs\nare made and implemented.  To begin with, NVMHI does not provide\nadequate discharge criteria in patient charts.  Without such\ncriteria, it is impossible to exercise professional judgment\nabout readiness for discharge.  As a result, NVMHI's discharge\nsystem is arbitrary, with some patients released too soon while\nothers are hospitalized for too long.  Of the 3 0 records reviewed\nby our psychologist, not one contained even a general statement\nas to the level of functioning which would demonstrate a\npatient's readiness for discharge.  Second, discharge planning is\ngiven low priority at NVMHI and discharge plans are often\ndeveloped only shortly before a patient is about to be released\nrather than being incorporated into treatment objectives.\nDischarge planning should be, but is not, an integral part of\ntreatment at the facility.  Third, discharge decisions are not\nbeing implemented due to inadequate community services.  One\nglaring example involves a mentally retarded NVMHI patient who\nstaff thought should live in a community group home, but decided\nthat was impractical because it would take several years before a\nspot opened up for any patient on the waiting list.  Since there\n\n- 5 -\nwere no community placements available, the staff had to keep the\npatient hospitalized instead.  Finally, discharge planning is\ninadequate to ensure that appropriate aftercare services are\nprovided to help the patient remain in the community.  Our\nconsultant found 3 6 percent of July 1995 admissions were\nreadmissions occurring within 76 days of discharge.  One of these\npatients was discharged with no clear plan to address basic\nliving needs other than to live with another patient.  High\nreadmission rates indicate the State is not providing integrated\nhospital and community services in order to ensure adequate\npatient transition into the community.  Without adequate\nfollow-through and community treatment options, NVMHI is unable\nto sustain patients in the community and prevent their\nrehospitalization.\nII.  Deficient staffing and staff supervision.\nSection B of the Commonwealth's Continuous Improvement Plan\nof correction claims that \"NVMHI currently maintains an\nappropriate number of qualified staff....\"  Our consultants\nfound, however, and we concur, that NVMHI does not have a\nsufficient number of qualified staff to meet patient needs.\nAt the time of our tour, virtually the entire management\nhierarchy, including the facility director and medical director,\nwas serving in an acting capacity. --The failure to fill these\ncritical positions on a permanent basis is especially problematic\nin a facility which already has serious supervision problems.\nAdditionally, the acting clinical director, who has recently been\nplaced in charge of the entire psychology department, has a\nnursing background, rather than one in psychology.  For all\npractical purposes, the psychology department is currently\nfunctioning without professional supervision.  The problems with\nleadership at the facility are especially troubling since NVMHI\ndoes not have a clearly defined mission.  Although it is designed\nas an acute care psychiatric facility, it operates in many ways\nlike a long-term care facility.  Solid leadership is essential if\nthe facility is to achieve any meaningful reforms.\nDirect care, including nursing care, is generally\nunderstaffed.  Based upon the hospital's own classification\nsystem, our nursing consultant found that NVMHI is short 18.61\nfull-time direct care staff.  Additionally, much of the nursing\nstaff's time is spent on ineffective \"special observations\"\nrather than therapeutic activities.  In the past year, NVMHI used\nmore than 47 of the 67 direct care staff budgeted for \"special\nobservations.\"  In contrast, direct care staff spend little time\nworking directly with patients in any meaningful way.  NVMHI's\npractice of relying on one to one interventions for three to five\nminutes four times per week is not adequate for supervision or\ntreatment.  Although the understaffing has been reduced in the\npast year, it remains troubling.  To make up for the lack of\n\n- 6 -\ndirect care coverage, the facility has had to use at least 4000\nhours of overtime in the past fiscal year.  This excessive use of\novertime in an acute care mental health facility is dangerous and\ndoes not comport with accepted professional standards.\nAt NVMHI, psychologist resources are stretched too thin.\nPatient and staff interviews show that psychologists see their\npatients only on rounds and then for only a few minutes.  The\npsychologists are occupied with a variety of duties and do not\nproperly address important matters such as patient admissions,\npsychotherapy, and treatment.  Moreover, psychologists are not\nadequately supervised.  Some actions by psychologists are highly\nquestionable.  For example, one psychologist recommended\nrestraints for a patient with an eating disorder.  Such an\ninappropriate recommendation should not have occurred if there\nhad been adequate supervision.\nNVMHI also is not meeting the psychiatrist to patient\nstaffing ratios outlined in the Continuous Improvement Plan.\nPresently, one of the five staff psychiatrist positions is\nvacant.  Given the many, arguably excessive, number of\nsupervisory responsibilities placed on psychiatrist staff, even\none vacancy seriously increases the workload on the other staff.\nIt is therefore imperative that psychiatrist staffing operate at\nfull capacity.  Patients rarely see psychiatrists on a one-to-one\nbasis.  Instead, psychiatrists may--see patients only during\nrounds and then just for a few minutes.  These sessions take\nplace in the patient's room, often in the presence of the\npatient's roommate.  This practice undermines treatment-by\ncompromising patient confidentiality.\nNVMHI's close proximity to the Northern Virginia Medical\nCenter provides good, physical access to emergency medical\nservices.  The facility, however, does not have a full-time\ninternist or family practitioner even though some patients have\nchronic medical problems.\nMore generally, it appears NVMHI sometimes counts\nadministrators as full-time staff.  There is a significant\ndifference between a full-time doctor, nurse, or other staff\nperson who provides patient services, and an administrator who\nprovides such services only occasionally.\nIn sum, NVMHI is not providing adequate direct care and\nprofessional staffing in accordance with its Plan or accepted\nprofessional standards.  This failure has directly resulted in\ndeficient patient care.\nIll.  Inadequate medical care and medication practices.\nSection C of the Continuous Improvement Plan seeks to ensure\nthat NVMHI has taken and will continue to take steps to eliminate\n\n- 7 -\nintra-class polypharmacy and generally ensure that medication\npractices are \"professionally justified.\"  Yet, medication\npractices at NVMHI remain deficient and violate professional\nstandards.  Intra-class polypharmacy continues to be a serious\nproblem, with 19 of 76 patients on more than one drug of the same\nclass.  In addition, 55 of 76 patients are on benzodiazepines,\nwhich are potentially addictive, sleep-inducing, hypnotics.\nNVMHI staff are using these powerful drugs for their sedative\neffect in a professionally inappropriate manner.  In addition,\nthe rationale for prescribed medications is not specified except\nin the most rudimentary and unacceptable terms.\nIV.  Inadequate protection from harm.\nAbove all else, a hospital must be safe; yet, NVMHI is an\nunsafe facility.  When patients and staff are not safe, the\nhospital environment is not conducive to treatment.  Last year,\nthere were at least 70 patient elopements.  In an average month,\nthere are at least 27 incidents of patient self-injury and 17\nincidents of patient on patient violence.  In addition, there\nwere 39 staff injuries last year which were sufficiently serious\nto require use of sick leave.  Moreover, NVMHI apparently has a\ncontraband problem which requires close scrutiny.  The hospital\nhas conducted drug sweeps, regularly searches patients after\nvisitation, and has even brought in drug dogs.  Use of such\nmeasures in a civilian hospital is.^highly irregular.  All of\nthese are indications of an unsafe environment.  They also help\nexplain why our consultants concluded that NVMHI has a \"siege\" or\n\"prison\" like mentality which is inconsistent with professional\nstandards.\nPatients are hurt even when they are supposedly under\ncareful supervision.  We found at least five cases where patients\nengaged in multiple incidents of self-inflicted injuries, many\ntimes even while they were under suicide watch.  One patient\ncommitted approximately 12 such acts of self-injury while on\n\"special observation\" status.  We even found cases where patients\ninjured themselves while in both seclusion and restraints.  One\npatient somehow managed to obtain a knife while in the seclusion\nroom.  Another patient was in full restraints and helmet, yet\nstill managed to pull tape from his helmet and tie it around his\nneck.  Such severe lapses in supervision suggest that NVMHI\nsuicide and safety precautions do not meet professional\nstandards.\nEven though NVMHI has a practice of arresting patients who\nassault staff, there is no attempt to monitor and evaluate this\ntrend or develop a constructive plan of action to address the\nissue.  Management committee notes make no mention of the\nproblem.  For example, there should be some attempt to evaluate\nwhy some staff seem to call the police more than others, why some\naggressive patients are not responding to treatment, and whether\n\n- 8 -\nstaff are using techniques, such as \"hands on\" approaches, which\ncan trigger violent outbursts in some patients.  Instead, the\nfacility has a policy which sanctions the practice of calling the\npolice when a patient is unruly, which merely encourages\nconfrontation between patients and staff.\nV.  Inappropriate use of restraints and seclusion.\nSection D of the Commonwealth's Continuous Improvement Plan\npromises that \"NVMHI will develop and implement seclusion and\nrestraint policies that comport with generally accepted\npsychiatric standards by October 1, 1995.\"  At the time of our\ntour, NVMHI had not made adequate progress in addressing numerous\ndeficiencies in facility policies and practices.\nRestraint and seclusion practices do not meet accepted\nprofessional standards.  Seclusion and restraints are used\ncontinually over many months even when they are seemingly\nineffective.  One patient was secluded/restrained for 840 hours\nover an eight-month period.  Another patient was\nsecluded/restrained for 1160 hours over a nine-month period.  The\ninappropriate and excessive use of restraints and seclusion for\npatients is related to the facility's generally inadequate\ntreatment process.  As noted earlier, the facility has had so\nmany problems with some patients, staff have resorted to calling\nthe police and having patients arrested rather than addressing\nthe underlying psychological issues.  At least one patient has\nalso called 911 in order to report being injured during physical\ncontainment by staff.\nDocumentation regarding the use of restraints and seclusion\nis lax.  Patients are kept in restraints and seclusion without\nany objective, recorded criteria for their release or explanation\nof the problem behavior that is being addressed by the use of\nrestraints.  NVMHI has a policy of secluding and physically\nrestraining a patient at the same time.  This policy indicates a\nmechanical device  (a locked door) is being substituted for a\nstaff member due to understaffing.  Patients are kept in\nrestraints even after they exhibit sufficient control\n(e.g.. ability to use common bathrooms and eat on the unit) to be\nreleased.\nVI.  Unsafe physical conditions.\nSignificant physical defects involving \"suicide-safe\"\nfixtures exist at NVMHI, even though the facility's Continuous\nImprovement Plan calls for a \"safe and sanitary environment.\"\nThese defects pose a serious risk of harm to suicidal patients.\nFor example, clothes hangers, which are supposedly\n\"suicide-safe,\" are connected so tightly to the closet walls,\nthat they do not actually break away when someone puts weight on\nthem, thereby posing a serious risk to patients attempting\n\n- 9 -\nsuicide.  Additionally, light fixtures in housing areas lack\ninstitutional safety covers.  Thus, patients have repeatedly been\nable to injure themselves by removing covers and cutting\nthemselves with glass shards.  There is a long, hand-held shower\nin one community bathroom which could be used by a patient to\ncommit suicide.\nThe seclusion room on H Unit has a blind spot which prevents\nadequate patient observation.  There is no seclusion room on F\nUnit.  Thus, a patient who is acting out has to be moved to H\nUnit before he or she can be secluded.  This transfer increases\nthe risk of injury.\nIn addition, there is only a male bathroom on one unit, and\nonly a female bathroom on the other unit.  Since each unit houses\nboth males and females, this arrangement inhibits necessary\naccess to bathroom facilities, reduces patient privacy, and\nincreases the risk of untoward sexual events.\nIn terms of sanitation, NVMHI was clean and appeared\nadequately maintained at the time of our tour.  There have been\nlimited problems in the past with vermin, such as dead squirrels\nin the ceiling.\nVII.  Quality assurance and recordkeeping.\nThe Continuous Improvement Plan promises that \"NVMHI will\nimplement an adequate Quality Improvement Plan.\"  Certainly at\nthe time of our tour, this element of the Plan had not been met.\nQuality control at NVMHI is deficient and violates professional\nstandards.  The data collected in key areas is often poor.  NVMHI\nreported six 1995 patient suicide attempts to the Justice\nDepartment.  This number appears to be inaccurate.  For example,\nwe found a patient record which showed a patient attempted\nsuicide with a wire hanger while under 15 minute checks; yet this\nincident was not reported to the Department.  The failure\nadequately to track suicide incidents increases the risk of harm\nto suicidal patients and is troubling given the other\ndeficiencies in suicide prevention discussed in previous\nsections.\nThe data collected are frequently irrelevant to those who\nneed to use them.  For instance, quality improvement reports\nregarding seclusion and restraint usage do not provide the\ninformation needed by the nursing department to evaluate the\nnursing staff's use of such seclusion and restraints.  The\nnursing monitoring and evaluation plan is inadequate and is not\nimplemented as written.  Only four of the nine aspects of care\nidentified in the plan are actually monitored.\nPatient records are disorganized.  For example, we tried to\nfind one patient's psychosocial assessment.  The present records\n\n- 10 -\nreferred to an older record, which referred to an even older\nrecord, and so forth.  Finally, we learned the assessment was in\nthe state archives.  Ad hoc codes are used to cite to other\nsections of patient records.  Nursing care plans are often\ninconsistent with the Master Treatment Plan.  Disorganized\nrecords exacerbate supervision and treatment deficiencies.\nMINIMUM REMEDIAL MEASURES\nWe are providing copies of our consultant reports under\nseparate cover.  These reports and our original findings letter\ndetail numerous remedial measures.  A summary of the\nrecommendations follows:\nI.  Mental health care.\nNVMHI must evaluate, diagnose, treat, and discharge patients\nconsistent with generally accepted professional standards.\nIndividualized patient psychological assessments must be\nperformed promptly in accordance with professional standards.  In\nparticular, such assessments must be conducted for patients who\nrepeatedly engage in problem behaviors.\nThe treatment process must be reformed.  Patient treatment\nmust be appropriate, individualized, coordinated, and properly\nmanaged.  Such programs must give each patient a reasonable\nopportunity to be cured and function as independently and\neffectively as possible given his or her individual condition.\nTo that end, treatment planning should reflect multidisciplinary\nthinking.  Patients should have input in the treatment process.\nTreatment must be based on objective data and clearly established\ngoals.  Staff require training on how to write professionally\nappropriate behavioral goals and objectives.  Staff must interact\ntherapeutically with patients, and NVMHI should seriously\nconsider using staff currently assigned to \"groups\" for providing\nmore focused, individual treatment.  Data collected by staff for\ntreatment decisions should be adequately incorporated into the\ntreatment planning process.  Master treatment and nursing care\nplans need to be consistent and adequately organized for staff\nreview.  Special observations should be included in master\ntreatment and nursing care plans.  Mentally retarded patients\nshould not be admitted to NVMHI, and appropriate alternative\nplacements must be developed for these patients.\nNVMHI must provide adequate discharge planning, including\nappropriately integrated community-based mental health services,\nto meet the needs of patients upon discharge.  NVMHI must develop\na quality assurance/improvement system to oversee the discharge\nprocess.  This system must ensure that patient discharge plans\nare implemented and that appropriate aftercare services in the\ncommunity are provided.  Discharge criteria need to be adequately\ndeveloped and discharge planning should be a consideration long\n\n- 11 -\nbefore a patient is about to be discharged.  In previous\ncorrespondence, the Commonwealth has taken the position that such\nrequirements are equivalent to a demand for closure of state\ninstitutions.  We have never demanded the closure of any of\nVirginia's hospitals, and we do not do so in this case.  What is\nrequired is individualized, professionally justified placement\ndecisions which reflect consideration of a patient's needs,\nrather than just administrative convenience or inadequate funding\nof appropriate services.\nII.  Staffing and staff supervision.\nNVMHI must fill vacant management positions with permanent\nemployees to ensure adequate leadership at the institution.  The\npsychology department needs to be supervised by a qualified\nindividual with psychology expertise.  NVMHI must hire adequate\nnumbers of additional full-time, qualified, direct care staff and\nuse them to provide appropriate supervision and treatment.  The\nvacant psychiatrist's position must be filled as soon as\npossible.  Direct care and professional staff must spend more\ntime working directly with patients in an appropriate setting.\nIII.  Medical care and medication practices.\nMedical staffing must include at least one full-time\ninternist or family practitioner. ^Patients should receive prompt\nprofessional evaluation of medical problems.  All use of drugs\nmust be professionally justified, carefully monitored,\ndocumented, and reviewed by qualified staff.\nIV.  Seclusion and restraint and protection from harm.\nSeclusion and restraint policies must comport with\nprofessional standards and be implemented in a safe and\nappropriate manner.  The average hours per patient in seclusion\nand restraints should be reduced.  All restrained patients should\nbe on constant observation, rather than being left alone in a\nlocked seclusion room.  Use of seclusion and restraints must be\nproperly documented and must be reviewed in a timely fashion by\nqualified staff.  Criteria for release from seclusion and\nrestraints must be clearly identified, and use of seclusion and\nrestraints as part of any treatment process must be\nprofessionally appropriate and regularly reviewed.  NVMHI must\nprovide adequate supervision of suicidal residents, and\nmechanical devices should not be used in order to make up for\ninadequate staffing.\nNVMHI needs to create an environment which ensures\nreasonable safety for both staff and patients.  The policy\nallowing the arrest of aggressive patients should be revamped\nfrom a unilateral, confrontational approach to one which\naddresses the underlying problems associated with working with\n\n- 12 -\ndifficult patients.  Training must be provided to ensure that\nonly appropriate interventions are used with patients who are\nacting out.\nV.  Unsafe physical conditions.\nThe facility must be maintained in good physical condition.\nSuicide precautions, such as shielded light fixtures and\nbreakaway closet hangers, need to be installed.  NVMHI should\nconsider a new housing system to minimize the risk of sexual\nincidents between male and female patients and reduce the\nproblems associated with moving F Unit patients to the H Unit\nseclusion room.\nVI.  Recordkeepina and quality assurance.\nThe Commonwealth must keep adequate data and patient records.\nData regarding suicide attempts, use of restraints and seclusion,\nand patient incidents are especially important.  Data collected\nshould be available in a form that is useful to appropriate\nstaff.\nNVMHI needs to develop an adequate quality improvement\nmechanism which collects and distributes useful data.  The system\ndeveloped must encourage the development and implementation of\nconstructive solutions where data indicate problems in patient\ncare and treatment.  The QA/QI process should monitor both\nstandardized aspects of care and non-standardized variables that\nmay indicate potential problems in the delivery of care..\nPursuant to CRIPA, the Attorney General may initiate a\nlawsuit to correct deficiencies at an institution 49 days after\nappropriate officials are notified of them.  42 U.S.C.\n§ 1997b(a)(1).  Our original findings letter generally identified\nthe same deficiencies as this one.  Since that letter was issued\nin April 1995, the 49 day response period has already passed.  We\nwill, however, give the Commonwealth an opportunity to respond to\nthis findings letter.  We anticipate hearing from you within two\nweeks with any response you may have to our findings.  If you do\nnot respond within the stated time period, we will consider\ninitiating an action to remedy the conditions that violate\npatients' constitutional and other federal statutory rights.  We\nlook forward to working with you and other Commonwealth officials\nin an effort to resolve this matter in a reasonable and\nexpeditious manner.\n\n- 13 -\nIf you or any member of your staff have any questions,\nplease feel free to contact attorneys David Deutsch at\n(202) 514-6270 or Christopher Cheng at (202) 514-8892.\nDeval L.

      "title": "Supplemental Findings Letter re: Northern Virginia Mental Health Institute, Falls Church, VA",
      "text": "U.S. Department of Justice\nCivil Rights Division\nOffice of the Assistant Anorruy  General  Hhshington.  D.C.  20035\nCRIPA Investigation\nMH-VA-001-005\nApril 3, 1996\nThe Honorable George Allen\nGovernor of Virginia\nCommonwealth Capitol Building\nNinth & Grace Streets\nRichmond, VA  23212\nDear Governor Allen:\nOn July 1, 1994, we notified you of our intent to\ninvestigate the Northern Virginia Mental Health Institute\n(\"NVMHI\" or \"Institute\") pursuant to the Civil Rights of\nInstitutionalized Persons Act  (\"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 1997 e_t seq.\nWe were initially denied access to the facility, and, as a\nresult, our April 20, 1995 letter of findings was issued without\nthe benefit of an on-site investigation.  In June 1995*; just\nprior to a meeting between Attorney General Reno and Virginia\nAttorney General Gilmore, the Commonwealth finally agreed to\nallow a Justice Department inspection of the facility.  That\ninspection took place on July 25-27, 1995.  During the\ninspection, Justice Department experts in the areas of\npsychiatry, psychology, and psychiatric nursing reviewed\ndocuments, interviewed staff, interviewed patients, and toured\nthe facility.  Your staff was cooperative during the tour, and we\nappreciate the assistance they provided.\nWe are now writing to advise you of our supplemental\nfindings, based on the on-site inspection, that conditions at the\nNVMHI continue to deprive NVMHI patients of their constitutional\nrights and violate the Americans with Disabilities Act  (\"ADA\"),\n42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 e_t sea. . and the ADA'S implementing\nregulations.\nThese continuing violations should be considered in light of\nthis investigation's long history.  Our April 20, 1995 letter\npreviously cited the Commonwealth for deficiencies in the\nfollowing areas:  1) mental health treatment; 2) staffing;\n3) medical care; 4) medication practices; 5) protection of\npatients from harm; and 6) physical plant.  In response to our\nfindings, the Commonwealth submitted a \"Continuous Improvement\n\n- 2 -\nPlan\"  (\"Continuous Improvement Plan\" or \"Plan\") on June 7, 1995.\nThis Continuous Improvement Plan details a number of reforms\nwhich the Commonwealth assured us were in the process of being\nimplemented.  At the time of our tour, many of the Commonwealth's\nself-imposed deadlines for implementing reforms had either passed\nor were fast approaching.  Yet, our inspection revealed continued\nconstitutional violations regarding matters previously identified\nin our April 20, 1995 letter and supposedly addressed by the\nCommonwealth's Continuous Improvement Plan.\nMore specifically, our supplemental findings are as follow:\nI.  Inadequate mental health care, discharge planning, and\ncommunity services.\nThe Commonwealth's Continuous Improvement Plan identifies\nremedial measures NVMHI has developed to address our earlier\nfindings and to improve care and treatment at the Institute.\nSection A of the Continuous Improvement Plan calls for\n\"appropriate, comprehensive individualized treatment\" based on\nadequate evaluations and multidisciplinary assessments.  Our\nconsultants found that the Commonwealth has been unable to meet\nmany of the Plan's key elements and that the treatment process at\nNVMHI remains inadequate.  From the point of admissions to the\npoint of discharge, the inadequate\"mental health care provided at\nthe facility increases the risk of harm to patients, fails to\nprovide them with a reasonable opportunity to be cured and\nfunction as independently as their psychiatric conditions permit,\nand violates professional standards.\nThe Continuous Improvement Plan promises that \"... NVMHI\nwill evaluate and assess each patient consistent with generally\naccepted professional standards to develop an appropriate,\naccurate diagnosis....  A new assessment process will be\ndeveloped by an interdisciplinary team and will be piloted in the\nadmissions suite for all new admissions.\"  Accepted professional\nstandards require that psychological evaluations be part of this\nassessment.  In the last year, however, only about 10 percent of\nNVMHI patients received psychological assessments at the point of\nadmission.  The failure to provide psychological assessments is\nespecially troubling because NVMHI recently assured the Health\nCare Financing Administration that staff would provide all\npatients with such assessments by July 1, 1995.  NVMHI clearly\nhas not met its own deadline; since at the time of our visit, at\nleast eight individuals admitted in July had not received a\npsychological assessment as part of the admissions process.  Even\nfor patients who repeatedly engage in maladaptive behaviors, the\nfacility fails to complete a psychological assessment or develop\nan adequate behavioral plan.  For example, one patient had a\nseries of self-abusive injuries, but received no psychological\nassessment or intervention.  Psychological assessments, even when\ndone, are often inadequate.  Assessments reiterate symptoms\n\n- 3 -\nwithout providing any suggested psychological interventions.\nImportant considerations, such as prior hospitalizations and\nfamily background, are not adequately explored.  Our expert\nconsultants found patient diagnoses that bore no relationship to\nsymptoms identified in the few assessments conducted.\nSection A of the Commonwealth's Continuous Improvement Plan\nalso requires that NVMHI \"... provide each of its patients an\nappropriate, comprehensive, individualized treatment program\nbased on [a] history and physical examination, psychiatric\nevaluations, and multidisciplinary assessments designed to\nmaximize each patient's opportunity for recovery and integration\ninto full community life.\"  In reality, patient treatment is not\nappropriate, multidisciplinary, individualized, or properly\nmanaged in accordance with accepted professional standards.\nTreatment planning is inadequate.  There is little or no evidence\nof multidisciplinary thinking in treatment planning, and patients\nhave little involvement in the process.  The process is so\ndisorganized that our expert consultants were unable to ascertain\nwhat the treatment plans are meant to accomplish.  Records show\nthat staff are providing treatment without an adequate\nunderstanding of the patient's problems.  Treatment goals are too\nvague and fail to provide an objective, measurable basis for\ngauging patient progress.  Treatment objectives refer to such\nmatters as whether a patient has attended his \"groups,\" rather\nthan substantive issues involving patient functioning.  Treatment\nplanning is not individualized.  Although patients attend classes\nor \"groups,\" many of the supposedly \"individualized\" treatment\nschedules are actually standard, preprinted forms that have\nlittle to do with the needs of the patient.  For example, some\npatients who need to avoid excessive stimulus are assigned to\ngroup therapy even though such therapy is contraindicated by\nprofessional standards.  Similarly, NVMHI has patients who are\nmentally retarded; yet their needs are not met and they are\ninappropriately placed at NVMHI.\nTreatment is also not adequately coordinated between\ndisciplines.  In particular, master treatment and nursing care\nplans are inconsistent.  Additionally, nursing care plans suffer\nsimilar defects to treatment plans.  For instance, initial\nnursing care plans are not individualized.  Patients are placed\nin categories, and then all patients in the same category receive\nthe same rote nursing care plan without adequate regard to their\nindividual needs.  Thus, one nursing care plan made no mention of\na patient's epilepsy, and another plan failed to address a\npatient's spastic colon.  Because standardized forms are used,\npatient problems which are not on the forms, such as sleep and\neating disturbances, are not addressed by nursing care plans.\nThe defective treatment process results in patients not\nreceiving a reasonable opportunity to be cured and function as\nwell as possible.  NVMHI policies do not require completion of\n\n- 4 -\nindividualized, comprehensive treatment plans until ten days have\npassed, which is a substantial period of the time that patients\nstay at NVMHI.  The average length of stay at NVMHI is\napproximately 40-50 days, an exceptionally long period for\nstabilizing patients in an acute care hospital.  The treatment\nprocess has built-in delays which prevent prompt treatment and\nsubsequent discharge of patients.  For example, the first review\nof a patient's stay does not occur until 21 days after admission.\nThis built-in delay means the system is inherently tilted in\nfavor of excessively long, and often unnecessarily protracted,\nhospitalizations.  This unnecessary delay places patients at\ngreat risk of harm.\nBehavioral management planning is also grossly inadequate\nand reflects the general absence of adequate psychology services\nat NVMHI.  Of the records reviewed, our expert psychologist  found\nonly one patient with recurrent self-injury who had even been\nsent to a psychologist for behavioral management planning.  This\npatient's behavioral plan was not established until nine months\nafter her admission and occurred at the same time hospital staff\ntook the extreme measure of having her arrested for assaulting a\nstaff person.  A token economy plan was subsequently put in place\nfor this patient, but it was not based on any recorded behavioral\nanalysis, psychological exam, or appraisal of baseline\nfunctioning.  \"'\nThe Continuous Improvement Plan assures that  \"Discharge\nplanning will continue to be appropriately carried out'for all\npatients who are discharged from the Institute.\"  Instead, our\nconsultants found that NVMHI's discharge planning is inadequate\nand violates professional standards.  The discharge planning\nfails to ensure that appropriate professional judgments about the\nmost integrated setting appropriate to meet each patient's needs\nare made and implemented.  To begin with, NVMHI does not provide\nadequate discharge criteria in patient charts.  Without such\ncriteria, it is impossible to exercise professional judgment\nabout readiness for discharge.  As a result, NVMHI's discharge\nsystem is arbitrary, with some patients released too soon while\nothers are hospitalized for too long.  Of the 3 0 records reviewed\nby our psychologist, not one contained even a general statement\nas to the level of functioning which would demonstrate a\npatient's readiness for discharge.  Second, discharge planning is\ngiven low priority at NVMHI and discharge plans are often\ndeveloped only shortly before a patient is about to be released\nrather than being incorporated into treatment objectives.\nDischarge planning should be, but is not, an integral part of\ntreatment at the facility.  Third, discharge decisions are not\nbeing implemented due to inadequate community services.  One\nglaring example involves a mentally retarded NVMHI patient who\nstaff thought should live in a community group home, but decided\nthat was impractical because it would take several years before a\nspot opened up for any patient on the waiting list.  Since there\n\n- 5 -\nwere no community placements available, the staff had to keep the\npatient hospitalized instead.  Finally, discharge planning is\ninadequate to ensure that appropriate aftercare services are\nprovided to help the patient remain in the community.  Our\nconsultant found 36 percent of July 1995 admissions were\nreadmissions occurring within 76 days of discharge.  One of these\npatients was discharged with no clear plan to address basic\nliving needs other than to live with another patient.  High\nreadmission rates indicate the State is not providing integrated\nhospital and community services in order to ensure adequate\npatient transition into the community.  Without adequate\nfollow-through and community treatment options, NVMHI is unable\nto sustain patients in the community and prevent their\nrehospitalization.\nII.  Deficient staffing and staff supervision.\nSection B of the Commonwealth's Continuous Improvement Plan\nof correction claims that \"NVMHI currently maintains an\nappropriate number of qualified staff....\"  Our consultants\nfound, however, and we concur, that NVMHI does not have a\nsufficient number of qualified staff to meet patient needs.\nAt the time of our tour, virtually the entire management\nhierarchy, including the facility .director and medical director,\nwas serving in an acting capacity.  The failure to fill these\ncritical positions on a permanent basis is especially problematic\nin a facility which already has serious supervision problems.\nAdditionally, the acting clinical director, who has recently been\nplaced in charge of the entire psychology department, has a\nnursing background, rather than one in psychology.  For all\npractical purposes, the psychology department is currently\nfunctioning without professional supervision.  The problems with\nleadership at the facility are especially troubling since NVMHI\ndoes not have a clearly defined mission.  Although it is designed\nas an acute care psychiatric facility, it operates in many ways\nlike a long-term care facility.  Solid leadership is essential if\nthe facility is to achieve any meaningful reforms.\nDirect care, including nursing care, is generally\nunderstaffed.  Based upon the hospital's own classification\nsystem, our nursing consultant found that NVMHI is short 18.61\nfull-time direct care staff.  Additionally, much of the nursing\nstaff's time is spent on ineffective \"special observations\"\nrather than therapeutic activities.  In the past year, NVMHI used\nmore than 47 of the 67 direct care staff budgeted for \"special\nobservations.\"  In contrast, direct care staff spend little time\nworking directly with patients in any meaningful way.  NVMHI's\npractice of relying on one to one interventions for three to five\nminutes four times per week is not adequate for supervision or\ntreatment.  Although the understaffing has been reduced in the\npast year, it remains troubling.  To make up for the lack of\n\n- 6 -\ndirect care coverage, the facility has had to use at least 4000\nhours of overtime in the past fiscal year.  This excessive use of\novertime in an acute care mental health facility is dangerous and\ndoes not comport with accepted professional standards.\nAt NVMHI, psychologist resources are stretched too thin.\nPatient and staff interviews show that psychologists see their\npatients only on rounds and then for only a few minutes.  The\npsychologists are occupied with a variety of duties and do not\nproperly address important matters such as patient admissions,\npsychotherapy, and treatment.  Moreover, psychologists are not\nadequately supervised.  Some actions by psychologists are highly\nquestionable.  For example, one psychologist recommended\nrestraints for a patient with an eating disorder.  Such an\ninappropriate recommendation should not have occurred if there\nhad been adequate supervision.\nNVMHI also is not meeting the psychiatrist to patient\nstaffing ratios outlined in the Continuous Improvement Plan.\nPresently, one of the five staff psychiatrist positions is\nvacant.  Given the many, arguably excessive, number of\nsupervisory responsibilities placed on psychiatrist staff, even\none vacancy seriously increases the workload on the other staff.\nIt is therefore imperative that psychiatrist staffing operate at\nfull capacity.  Patients rarely see psychiatrists on a one-to-one\nbasis.  Instead, psychiatrists may see patients only during\nrounds and then just for a few minutes.  These sessions take\nplace in the patient's room, often in the presence of the\npatient's roommate.  This practice undermines treatment by\ncompromising patient confidentiality.\nNVMHI's close proximity to the Northern Virginia Medical\nCenter provides good, physical access to emergency medical\nservices.  The facility, however, does not have a full-time\ninternist or family practitioner even though some patients have\nchronic medical problems.\nMore generally, it appears NVMHI sometimes counts\nadministrators as full-time staff.  There is a significant\ndifference between a full-time doctor, nurse, or other staff\nperson who provides patient services, and an administrator who\nprovides such services only occasionally.\nIn sum, NVMHI is not providing adequate direct care and\nprofessional staffing in accordance with its Plan or accepted\nprofessional standards.  This failure has directly resulted in\ndeficient patient care.\nIll.  Inadequate medical care and medication practices.\nSection C of the Continuous Improvement Plan seeks to ensure\nthat NVMHI has taken and will continue to take steps to eliminate\n\n- 7 -\nintra-class polypharniacy and generally ensure that medication\npractices are \"professionally justified.\"  Yet, medication\npractices at NVMHI remain deficient and violate professional\nstandards.  Intra-class polypharmacy continues to be a serious\nproblem, with 19 of 76 patients on more than one drug of the same\nclass.  In addition, 55 of 76 patients are on benzodiazepines,\nwhich are potentially addictive, sleep-inducing, hypnotics.\nNVMHI staff are using these powerful drugs for their sedative\neffect in a professionally inappropriate manner.  In addition,\nthe rationale for prescribed medications is not specified except\nin the most rudimentary and unacceptable terms.\nIV.  Inadequate protection from harm.\nAbove all else, a hospital must be safe; yet, NVMHI is an\nunsafe facility.  When patients and staff are not safe, the\nhospital environment is not conducive to treatment.  Last year,\nthere were at least 70 patient elopements.  In an average month,\nthere are at least 27 incidents of patient self-injury and 17\nincidents of patient on patient violence.  In addition, there\nwere 39 staff injuries last year which were sufficiently serious\nto require use of sick leave.  Moreover, NVMHI apparently has a\ncontraband problem which requires close scrutiny.  The hospital\nhas conducted drug sweeps, regularly searches patients after\nvisitation, and has even brought in drug dogs.  Use of such\nmeasures in a civilian hospital fs highly irregular.  All of\nthese are indications of an unsafe environment.  They also help\nexplain why our consultants concluded that NVMHI has a \"siege\" or\n\"prison\" like mentality which is inconsistent with professional\nstandards.\nPatients are hurt even when they are supposedly under\ncareful supervision.  We found at least five cases where patients\nengaged in multiple incidents of self-inflicted injuries, many\ntimes even while they were under suicide watch.  One patient\ncommitted approximately 12 such acts of self-injury while on\n\"special observation\" status.  We even found cases where patients\ninjured themselves while in both seclusion and restraints.  One\npatient somehow managed to obtain a knife while in the seclusion\nroom.  Another patient was in full restraints and helmet, yet\nstill managed to pull tape from his helmet and tie it around his\nneck.  Such severe lapses in supervision suggest that NVMHI\nsuicide and safety precautions do not meet professional\nstandards.\nEven though NVMHI has a practice of arresting patients who\nassault staff, there is no attempt to monitor and evaluate this\ntrend or develop a constructive plan of action to address the\nissue.  Management committee notes make no mention of the\nproblem.  For example, there should be some attempt to evaluate\nwhy some staff seem to call the police more than others, why some\naggressive patients are not responding to treatment, and whether\n\n- 8 -\nstaff are using techniques, such as \"hands on\" approaches, which\ncan trigger violent outbursts in some patients.  Instead, the\nfacility has a policy which sanctions the practice of calling the\npolice when a patient is unruly, which merely encourages\nconfrontation between patients and staff.\nV.  Inappropriate use of restraints and seclusion.\nSection D of the Commonwealth's Continuous Improvement Plan\npromises that \"NVMHI will develop and implement seclusion and\nrestraint policies that comport with generally accepted\npsychiatric standards by October 1, 1995.\"  At the time of our\ntour, NVMHI had not made adequate progress in addressing numerous\ndeficiencies in facility policies and practices.\nRestraint and seclusion practices do not meet accepted\nprofessional standards.  Seclusion and restraints are used\ncontinually over many months even when they are seemingly\nineffective.  One patient was secluded/restrained for 840 hours\nover an eight-month period.  Another patient was\nsecluded/restrained for 1160 hours over a nine-month period.  The\ninappropriate and excessive use of restraints and seclusion for\npatients is related to the facility's generally inadequate\ntreatment process.  As noted earlier, the facility has had so\nmany problems with some patients, s-taff have resorted to calling\nthe police and having patients arrested rather than addressing\nthe underlying psychological issues.  At least one patient has\nalso called 911 in order to report being injured during physical\ncontainment by staff.\nDocumentation regarding the use of restraints and seclusion\nis lax.  Patients are kept in restraints and seclusion without\nany objective, recorded criteria for their release or explanation\nof the problem behavior that is being addressed by the use of\nrestraints.  NVMHI has a policy of secluding and physically\nrestraining a patient at the same time.  This policy indicates a\nmechanical device (a locked door) is being substituted for a\nstaff member due to understaffing.  Patients are kept in\nrestraints even after they exhibit sufficient control\n(e.g. . ability to use common bathrooms and eat on the unit) to be\nreleased.\nVI.  Unsafe physical conditions.\nSignificant physical defects involving \"suicide-safe\"\nfixtures exist at NVMHI, even though the facility's Continuous\nImprovement Plan calls for a \"safe and sanitary environment.\"\nThese defects pose a serious risk of harm to suicidal patients.\nFor example, clothes hangers, which are supposedly\n\"suicide-safe,\" are connected so tightly to the closet walls,\nthat they do not actually break away when someone puts weight on\nthem, thereby posing a serious risk to patients attempting\n\n- 9 -\nsuicide.  Additionally, light fixtures in housing areas lack\ninstitutional safety covers.  Thus, patients have repeatedly been\nable to injure themselves by removing covers and cutting\nthemselves with glass shards.  There is a long, hand-held shower\nin one community bathroom which could be used by a patient to\ncommit suicide.\nThe seclusion room on H Unit has a blind spot which prevents\nadequate patient observation.  There is no seclusion room on F\nUnit.  Thus, a patient who is acting out has to be moved to H\nUnit before he or she can be secluded.  This transfer increases\nthe risk of injury.\nIn addition, there is only a male bathroom on one unit, and\nonly a female bathroom on the other unit.  Since each unit houses\nboth males and females, this arrangement inhibits necessary\naccess to bathroom facilities, reduces patient privacy, and\nincreases the risk of untoward sexual events.\nIn terms of sanitation, NVMHI was clean and appeared\nadequately maintained at the time of our tour.  There have been\nlimited problems in the past with vermin, such as dead squirrels\nin the ceiling.\nVII.  Quality assurance and recordkeepinq.\nThe Continuous Improvement Plan promises that \"NVMHI will\nimplement an adequate Quality Improvement Plan.\"  Certainly at\nthe time of our tour, this element of the Plan had not been met.\nQuality control at NVMHI is deficient and violates professional\nstandards.  The data collected in key areas is often poor.  NVMHI\nreported six 1995 patient suicide attempts to the Justice\nDepartment.  This number appears to be inaccurate.  For example,\nwe found a patient record which showed a patient attempted\nsuicide with a wire hanger while under 15 minute checks; yet this\nincident was not reported to the Department.  The failure\nadequately to track suicide incidents increases the risk of harm\nto suicidal patients and is troubling given the other\ndeficiencies in suicide prevention discussed in previous\nsections.\nThe data collected are frequently irrelevant to those who\nneed to use them.  For instance, quality improvement reports\nregarding seclusion and restraint usage do not provide the\ninformation needed by the nursing department to evaluate the\nnursing staff's use of such seclusion and restraints. The\nnursing monitoring and evaluation plan is inadequate and is not\nimplemented as written.  Only four of the nine aspects of care\nidentified in the plan are actually monitored.\nPatient records are disorganized.  For example, we tried to\nfind one patient's psychosocial assessment.  The present records\n\n- 10 -\nreferred to an older record, which referred to an even older\nrecord, and so forth.  Finally, we learned the assessment was in\nthe state archives.  Ad hoc codes are used to cite to other\nsections of patient records.  Nursing care plans are often\ninconsistent with the Master Treatment Plan.  Disorganized\nrecords exacerbate supervision and treatment deficiencies.\nMINIMUM REMEDIAL MEASURES\nWe are providing copies of our consultant reports under\nseparate cover.  These reports and our original findings letter\ndetail numerous remedial measures.  A summary of the\nrecommendations follows:\nI.  Mental health care.\nNVMHI must evaluate, diagnose, treat, and discharge patients\nconsistent with generally accepted professional standards.\nIndividualized patient psychological assessments must be\nperformed promptly in accordance with professional standards.  In\nparticular, such assessments must be conducted for patients who\nrepeatedly engage in problem behaviors.\nThe treatment process must be reformed.  Patient treatment\nmust be appropriate, individualized, coordinated, and properly\nmanaged.  Such programs must give \"each patient a reasonable\nopportunity to be cured and function as independently and\neffectively as possible given his or her individual condition.\nTo that end, treatment planning should reflect multidisciplinary\nthinking.  Patients should have input in the treatment process.\nTreatment must be based on objective data and clearly established\ngoals.  Staff require training on how to write professionally\nappropriate behavioral goals and objectives.  Staff must interact\ntherapeutically with patients, and NVMHI should seriously\nconsider using staff currently assigned to \"groups\" for providing\nmore focused, individual treatment.  Data collected by staff for\ntreatment decisions should be adequately incorporated into the\ntreatment planning process.  Master treatment and nursing care\nplans need to be consistent and adequately organized for staff\nreview.  Special observations should be included in master\ntreatment and nursing care plans.  Mentally retarded patients\nshould not be admitted to NVMHI, and appropriate alternative\nplacements must be developed for these patients.\nNVMHI must provide adequate discharge planning, including\nappropriately integrated community-based mental health services,\nto meet the needs of patients upon discharge.  NVMHI must develop\na quality assurance/improvement system to oversee the discharge\nprocess.  This system must ensure that patient discharge plans\nare implemented and that appropriate aftercare services in the\ncommunity are provided.  Discharge criteria need to be adequately\ndeveloped and discharge planning should be a consideration long\n\n- 11 -\nbefore a patient is about to be discharged.  In previous\ncorrespondence, the Commonwealth has taken the position that such\nrequirements are equivalent to a demand for closure of state\ninstitutions.  We have never demanded the closure of any of\nVirginia's hospitals, and we do not do so in this case.  What is\nrequired is individualized, professionally justified placement\ndecisions which reflect consideration of a patient's needs,\nrather than just administrative convenience or inadequate funding\nof appropriate services.\nII.  Staffing and staff supervision.\nNVMHI must fill vacant management positions with permanent\nemployees to ensure adequate leadership at the institution.  The\npsychology department needs to be supervised by a qualified\nindividual with psychology expertise.  NVMHI must hire adequate\nnumbers of additional full-time, qualified, direct care staff and\nuse them to provide appropriate supervision and treatment.  The\nvacant psychiatrist's position must be filled as soon as\npossible.  Direct care and professional staff must spend more\ntime working directly with patients in an appropriate setting.\nIIT.  Medical care and medication practices.\nMedical staffing must include at least one full-time\ninternist or family practitioner.\"\" Patients should receive prompt\nprofessional evaluation of medical problems.  All use of drugs\nmust be professionally justified, carefully monitored,\ndocumented, and reviewed by qualified staff.\nIV.  Seclusion and restraint and protection from harm.\nSeclusion and restraint policies must comport with\nprofessional standards and be implemented in a safe and\nappropriate manner.  The average hours per patient in seclusion\nand restraints should be reduced.  All restrained patients should\nbe on constant observation, rather than being left alone in a\nlocked seclusion room.  Use of seclusion and restraints must be\nproperly documented and must be reviewed in a timely fashion by\nqualified staff.  Criteria for release from seclusion and\nrestraints must be clearly identified, and use of seclusion and\nrestraints as part of any treatment process must be\nprofessionally appropriate and regularly reviewed.  NVMHI must\nprovide adequate supervision of suicidal residents, and\nmechanical devices should not be used in order to make up for\ninadequate staffing.\nNVMHI needs to create an environment which ensures\nreasonable safety for both staff and patients.  The policy\nallowing the arrest of aggressive patients should be revamped\nfrom a unilateral, confrontational approach to one which\naddresses the underlying problems associated with working with\n\n- 12 -\ndifficult patients.  Training must be provided to ensure that\nonly appropriate interventions are used with patients who are\nacting out.\nV.  Unsafe physical conditions.\nThe facility must be maintained in good physical condition.\nSuicide precautions, such as shielded light fixtures and\nbreakaway closet hangers, need to be installed.  NVMHI should\nconsider a new housing system to minimize the risk of sexual\nincidents between male and female patients and reduce the\nproblems associated with moving F Unit patients to the H Unit\nseclusion room.\nVI.  Recordkeepina and quality assurance.\nThe Commonwealth must keep adequate data and patient records.\nData regarding suicide attempts, use of restraints and seclusion,\nand patient incidents are especially important.  Data collected\nshould be available in a form that is useful to appropriate\nstaff.\nNVMHI needs to develop an adequate quality improvement\nmechanism which collects and distributes useful data.  The system\ndeveloped must encourage the development and implementation of\nconstructive solutions where data \"indicate problems in patient\ncare and treatment.  The QA/QI process should monitor both\nstandardized aspects of care and non-standardized variables that\nmay indicate potential problems in the delivery of care.\nPursuant to CRIPA, the Attorney General may initiate a\nlawsuit to correct deficiencies at an institution 49 days after\nappropriate officials are notified of them.  42 U.S.C.\n§ 1997b(a)(1).  Our original findings letter generally identified\nthe same deficiencies as this one.  Since that letter was issued\nin April 1995, the 49 day response period has already passed.  We\nwill, however, give the Commonwealth an opportunity to respond to\nthis findings letter.  We anticipate hearing from you within two\nweeks with any response you may have to our findings.  If you do\nnot respond within the stated time period, we will consider\ninitiating an action to remedy the conditions that violate\npatients' constitutional and other federal statutory rights.  We\nlook forward to working with you and other Commonwealth officials\nin an effort to resolve this matter in a reasonable and\nexpeditious manner.\n\n- 13 -\nIf you or any member of your staff have any questions,\nplease feel free to contact attorneys David Deutsch at\n(202) 514-6270 or Christopher Cheng at (202) 514-8892.\nDeval L.

      "text": "U.S. Department of Justice\nCivil Rights Division\nOffice of the Assistant Attorney  General  Washington, D.C.  20530\nCRIPA Investigation\n•IlllUIIIlllI\nMH-VA-001-001\nApril 20, 1995\nThe Honorable George Allen\nGovernor of Virginia\nState Capitol\nNinth & Grace Streets\nRichmond, VA  23212\nDear Governor Allen:\nOn July 1, 1994, we notified you of our intent to\ninvestigate the Northern Virginia Mental Health Institute\n(\"NVMHI\") pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized\nPersons Act  (\"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 1997 et seq.  Consistent with\nstatutory requirements, we are now writing to advise you of the\nfindings of this investigation.\nBy way of background, after notifying you of our intent to\ninvestigate NVMHI, we contacted Commonwealth officials to arrange\nan inspection of the facility.  Such inspections are routinely\nconducted in CRIPA investigations and enable us to impartially\nand independently evaluate allegations regarding a facility.  We\nthen submitted a document request on August 19, 1994.  Facility\nstaff assembled the documents and sent them to Virginia's Office\nof the Attorney General.  Shortly afterwards, we were informed by\nattorneys for the Commonwealth that Virginia had decided not to\ngrant us access to NVMHI or provide the requested documents.\nRepresentatives from the Commonwealth met with me on\nJanuary 31, 1995, to resolve certain Commonwealth concerns\nregarding this investigation and other pending investigations.\nAt this meeting, access to NVMHI was again denied.  In an effort\nto resolve this matter amicably, we agreed to again meet with\nVirginia officials and discuss in greater detail the basis for\nour investigation of NVMHI.  On February 14, 1995, attorneys met\nwith Virginia officials and provided a more detailed summary of\nthe reasons for our investigation of NVMHI.  Commonwealth\nofficials once again refused to grant access to the facility.\nThroughout the course of this investigation, Commonwealth\nofficials have refused to cooperate with this investigation and\nhave acted to frustrate its conduct.  Most recently, on\n\n- 2 -\nMarch 17, 1995, Commonwealth officials, through counsel, advised\nus that access might be granted by the end of the year provided\nwe agreed to accept numerous demands, including accepting your\ncounsel's views regarding other unresolved investigations.\nDuring the time that we have endeavored to work cooperatively\nwith Commonwealth officials, nine months have passed since\nissuance of our investigation notice letter.  Yet, Virginia\nofficials now ask that we wait until the end of 1995, at least\neighteen months since issuance of our notice letter, before they\nwill grant access to NVMHI.  This course of conduct is\nunacceptable.\nNotwithstanding lack of access, we have gathered numerous\nfacts which indicate that conditions at the facility deprive\nNVMHI patients of their constitutional rights and violate the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act  (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et\nsea.,  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (\"Section\n504\"), 29 U.S.C. § 794 et sea.. Title XVIII of the Social\nSecurity Act  (\"Medicare\"), 42 U.S.C. § 1395i et sea., and\nimplementing regulations for those statutes.\nPatients of state operated psychiatric facilities have a\nfundamental Fourteenth Amendment due process right to reasonable\nsafety and adequate medical care, including psychiatric services.\nYounqberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307  (1982).  Patients have a right\nto adequate psychiatric treatment which includes treatment  ..\nprograms designed to protect their Liberty interests.  Such\ntreatment programs must be sufficient to permit each patient an\nopportunity to improve or be cured and to function as\nindependently as their psychiatric conditions permit.  See, e.g.,\nWvatt v. Sticknev, 325 F.Supp. 781, 784  (M.D. Ala. 1971) .  Such\nprograms must provide opportunities for patients to acquire and\nmaintain skills that will enable them to cope more effectively\nwith the demands of their own person, their environment, and to\nraise the level of their mental, behavioral, physical, and social\nefficiency.  Gary W. v. Louisiana, 437 F.Supp. 1209, 1219 (E.D.\nLa.  1976); see also, Thomas S. by Brooks v. Flaherty, 699 F.S.\n1178  (W.D. N.C. 1988), aff'd, 902 F.2d 250  (4th Cir. 1990), cert,\ndenied. Flaherty v. Thomas S. bv Brooks. 498 U.S. 951  (1990) .\nMoreover, a state cannot constitutionally confine, without more,\na nondangerous individual who is capable of surviving safely in\nthe community either independently or with assistance.  0'Connor\nv. Donaldson. 422 U.S. 563, 576  (1975).  Federal statutes and\nregulations also create rights and place obligations on state\ninstitutions.\nThe numerous constitutional and statutory deficiencies,\nwhich were previously summarized during the February 14, 1995\nmeeting with officials in the Virginia Attorney General's Office,\ninclude:\n\n- 3 -\nI.  Inadequate mental health care.\nNVMHI does not provide adequate mental health care.  Due to\nthe absence of such basics as patient histories, memory and\nintelligence appraisals, adequate and consistent diagnoses,\nevaluations, and treatment plans, psychiatric care is grossly\ninadequate.  Those treatment plans which exist are often not\nindividualized, lack essential elements, and are not consistently\nimplemented.  In these circumstances, patients are kept in\nidleness where they frequently are victimized by other patients\nwho, likewise, are not engaged in any professionally based\nprogram of psychiatric treatment.  Such idleness and lack of\ntreatment exacerbate their mental illnesses and serve to make\npatients more withdrawn, aggressive, or suicidal -- all of which\npresent direct threats to their health and safety.\nLack of staffing contributes.to lack of adequate treatment,\ndelaying prompt and adequate evaluation and precluding the\ndelivery of necessary care.  Lack of professional staff has\nprecluded the functioning of appropriately composed inter-\ndisciplinary teams which professional standards require for\ncritical treatment decisions.  Significantly, patients seldom are\nseen by a psychiatrist.  It is reported that treatment sessions\noften consist of little more than once.a month meetings between a\ngroup of psychiatrists and a patient.\nThere are numerous indications that there are too few\navailable psychiatrists to direct patient care.  Their progress\nnotes are too sparse to be meaningful.  Staff do not share\ncritical information or coordinate treatment efforts and .attempts\nto monitor and evaluate the quality of services have been\nhaphazard at every level.\nAbsent adequate treatment, discharge planning is seriously\ncompromised.  Moreover, there is no indication that those\npatients who are discharged receive appropriate follow-up care or\nthat there is a system in place in the community which can\neffectively monitor them or meet their needs when discharged.\nIn sum, psychiatric care at NVMHI fails to comport with\ngenerally accepted professional standards.  Indeed, the absence\nof care is so severe that it poses direct threats to the health\nand safety of patients.\nII.  Inadequate staffing.\nThe facility also lacks adequate numbers of qualified\nprofessional and direct care staff.  For several years, NVMHI has\nhad a chronic nursing shortage and has at times been unable to\nensure that a nurse is available during all shifts.  There are\nnot enough psychologists or psychiatrists to provide consistent,\ntimely, and meaningful treatment of patients.  Some NVMHI\n\n- 4 -\npsychologists have lacked the necessary credentials for providing\ntherapy.  Psychiatrists who are counted as full-time employees\nare not actually available to provide treatment at NVMHI because\nthey work at other facilities.  There is no full-time, regular\nmedical doctor on site.  The turnover rate for other professional\nstaff, such as social workers, is high, compromising continuity\nof care.  Direct care staffing is inadequate as well.\nThe staffing and other problems at NVMHI have become so\nsevere that staff have repeatedly resorted to calling the police\nwhen patients become unruly.  Several patients have been arrested\nat the request of staff after various incidents.  This unorthodox\nmethod of dealing with patients indicates that staffing is\ngrossly inadequate, and those staff available are ill-equipped to\naddress the needs of these patients.\nIn sum, the lack of staff at NVMHI is severe and precludes\nadequate care and treatment of patients.\nIII.  Inadequate medical care and dangerous medication practices.\nA county hospital is located only a few hundred yards from\nNVMHI, yet there have been a number of -well-publicized deaths\nwhich are linked to substantial delays in providing adequate\nmedical care.  Within the past few years, one,patient died partly\nbecause of a toxic buildup of antidepressants. in her body.\nAnother patient died from meningitis_a-fter a psychiatrist\nrequested that she be seen by an internist who failed to\" appear\nto assess her life-threatening condition.  More generally,\nmedical records are incomplete and lack basic information.,\nresulting in inappropriate treatment.\" For example, patients are\nplaced on medications without any evaluation' of their medical\nhistories.\nDrugs are prescribed without adequate explanation in the\nrecords.  Polypharmacy has been a problem at NVMHI, with some\npatients on more than a dozen drugs during their stay at the\nfacility.  Blood testing and monitoring for medication side\neffects is haphazard, and patients have been placed at risk of\nharm from tardive dyskinesia and toxic drug side effects.\nThe lack of adequate medical care is systemic at NVMHI, and\nespecially severe in the area of emergency medical services.\nDeaths of the kind described above call into serious question the\nability of current staff to address life threatening illnesses.\nIV.  Failure to protect patients from harm.\nPatients are excessively restrained and secluded, and\nrecords do not adequately explain the reasons for such actions.\nPatients, including suicidal patients, have been left in\nrestraints or seclusion for hours at a time, without being\n\n- 5 -\nregularly checked or having their needs attended to by qualified\nstaff.  Due to inadequate staffing, NVMHI is unable to provide\none-on-one monitoring for many residents who are suicidal or are\nin restraints or seclusion and require such close supervision.\nPatients have been injured while being restrained and are then\nleft unattended by medical personnel.\nStaff have been quick to call the police when a patient\nbehaves violently towards staff, but fail to take action when one\npatient attacks another.  Many incidents are occurring without\nanyone noting them accurately in incident reports.  The\nfacility's environment has been inimical to therapy, with staff\nand patients verbally and physically harassing other patients.\nStaff supervision is inadequate, and NVMHI has had problems\nwith escapes and suicides.  Patients, identified by professional\nstaff as suicidal, have been allowed to wander off the grounds\nwithout supervision.  Patients under suicide watch have committed\nsuicide under circumstances which indicate staff neglect.\nIn sum, the lack of supervision and care is so grave that\npatients have been subjected to severe harm, including death.\"\nSuch conditions violate the constitutional rights of patients.\nV.:  Inadequate physical conditions.  •  •\nNVMHI has a roach and rodent problem.  Such problems\nindicate environmental health and safety problems at NVMHI, to\nwhich the Commonwealth has not responded.  The Commonwealth's\nunwillingness to provide documents regarding environmental health\nand safety concerns indicates a-high degree of indifference to\nissues, such as fire safety and sanitation, which are.easily\naddressed and documented.\nMINIMUM REMEDIAL MEASURES  .  \" /  ~\nThe following remedial measures need to be implemented in\norder to meet constitutional and statutory requirements:\nI.  Mental health care.\nNVMHI must evaluate, diagnose, treat, and discharge patients\nconsistent with generally accepted professional standards.\nPatient treatment must be appropriate, individualized,\ncoordinated, and properly managed.  Such programs must allow each\npatient a reasonable opportunity to be cured, function as\nindependently as possible, and cope as effectively as possible\nwith his or her needs.  Patient records should be complete and\nproperly updated.  NVMHI must provide adequate discharge\nplanning, including appropriate community-based mental health\nservices, to meet the needs of the patient upon discharge.  In\naddition, the Commonwealth must develop adequate quality\n\n- 6 -\nassurance mechanisms to ensure the appropriateness of post-\ndischarge services.\nII.  Staffing.\nNVMHI must retain adequate numbers of qualified professional\nand direct care staff to develop and implement treatment programs\nand care for patients and provide appropriate supervision.\nIII.  Medical care and medication practices.\nMedical staffing must be adequate to ensure prompt\nprofessional evaluation of medical problems by a regular medical\ndoctor.  All use of drugs must be professionally justified,\ncarefully monitored, documented, and reviewed.\nIV.  Protection from harm.\nSeclusion and restraint policies must comport with\nprofessional standards and must-be conducted in a safe and\nappropriate manner. .Use of seclusion and restraints must be\nproperly\"documented and must be reviewed in a\"'timely fashion by :\nqualified staff.  NVMHI must provide .adequate, including one-on-\none, supervision of suicidal residents.  ... -  -  -  .\nV.
