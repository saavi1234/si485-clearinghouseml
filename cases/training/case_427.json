    "summary": "<p>On September 30, 1992, the United States Department of Justice initiated an investigation of Eastern State Hospital, a psychiatric hospital in Williamsburg, Virginia, pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 1997.  In May 1993, the Department of Justice toured and inspected the facilities, which included the Hancock Geriatric Center.  The Department of Justice found that EHS failed to provide adequate psychiatric treatment to patients as required under the Fourteenth Amendment and notified the Governor of Virginia of these findings on May 6, 1994.</p><p>According to the Department of Justice, diagnostic methods at EHS did not reflect commonly accepted professional standards in that patients' symptoms, histories, and cognitive assessments were not used.  As a result, many patients were misdiagnosed repeatedly during their institutionalization.  Individualized planning suffered both from incorrect diagnoses and insufficient staff numbers and training.  Understaffing also forced patients to live in more restrictive environments than necessary and fostered overuse of physical restraint.  General medical care was inadequate and people with too little experience regularly made dosing decisions for patient care.  Finally, the facility's fire prevention was substandard. </p><p>It appears that the Department of Justice was dissatisfied with Virginia's attempts to remedy the problems because, on February 8, 1995, the Department of Justice issued another findings letter, which detailed the statutory violations in addition to constitutional violations.  Specifically, the Department of Justice charged that conditions at EHS violated the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq., § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. §§ 794 et seq., Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1395i et seq. (establishing the Health Insurance Program for the Aged and Disabled, or Medicare), and Virginia state law, Va. Code Ann. § 37.1 ñ 84.1 (Mitchie 1994).  The Department of Justice solicited Virginia's cooperation in improving conditions at ESH.  </p><p>On March 4, 1996, the United States filed a CRIPA lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on behalf of individuals institutionalized at ESH against the Commonwealth of Virginia, its Governor, and its Departments of Health and Human Resources and of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Substance Abuse Services, and Eastern State Hospital.  On May 10, 1996, the court (Judge Leonie M. Brinkema) denied the United States' request to consolidate this lawsuit with United States v. Commonwealth of Virginia, No. 96-283, ID-VA-002.  On May 21, 1996, the court dismissed the action for improper venue.  That judgment was stayed to encourage settlement.</p><p>On July 18, 1996, the parties filed a settlement agreement.  On June 10, 1997, the parties modified the settlement.  On March 25, 1999, the parties jointly asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit with prejudice based on defendants' substantial implementation of the plan agreed to in the settlement agreement; the court agreed to that dismissal.  The Justice Department seems to have held the case as open until October 4, 2001.</p>",

      "text": "U.S. Department of Justice\nCivil Rights Division\n£//\niV o> ilu  H..<;...-ii\nFebruary  8,  1995\nThe •Ho norable  Ge,orge  All.en   11111J1.S1  J 11jjf1111\nwu\nRichmond, Virginia  23219  MH-VA-002-002\nRe:  Eastern State Hospital\nDear Governor Allen:\nMy staff and I appreciated the opportunity to meet with\nyour Deputy Attorney General, William Hurd, and his staff on .\nJanuary 31, 1995, to discuss our investigations pursuant to the\nCivil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act of three\ninstitutions  (Northern Virginia Training Center, Eastern State\nHospital, and Northern Virginia Mental Health Institute) operated\nby the Commonwealth.  We have agreed to meet once again on or\nbefore February 10, 1995, in order to determine whether we can\ncome to some agreements in these matters.\nPrior to that meeting, we thought it appropriate to further\napprise you of our most recent findings and our determination\nthat federal statutory violations exist at the Eastern State\nHospital and the Hancock Geriatric Center (\"ESH\").  Our\ninvestigation of ESH was initiated on September 30, 1992 and has\nbeen pending absent any resolution for a protracted period of\ntime.\nFollowing a full evaluation of conditions at ESH, we most\nrecently advised Commonwealth officials of our findings of\ncontinuing constitutional violations at the facility in a letter\naddressed to you dated May 6, 1994.  In summary, we found\nunconstitutional conditions of confinement at the facility.\nSpecifically, we found deficiencies in psychiatric treatment,\nincluding treatment programs, the design and implementation of\ntraining programs, excessive and unjustifiable use of physical\nrestraints, inadequate numbers of direct care and professional\nstaff, inadequate medical care, including medication practices,\nand a facility that as a whole, represents an outdated and\nineffective node of caring for individuals with mental illness.\nA copy of our letter is attached for your further information.\n\n- 2 -\nIn addition, our review of this matter has led us to\ndetermine that the federal statutory rights of patients are being\nviolated.  More specifically, patients' rights pursuant to the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101\net seq.. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (\"Section\n504\"), 29 U.S.C. § 794 et sea., the provisions of the Medical\nAssistance Program  (\"Medicaid\") established under Title XIX of\nthe Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396r et sea., and the\nregulations promulgated pursuant thereto, and the Health\nInsurance Program for the Aged and Disabled  (\"Medicare\")\nestablished under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act,\n42 U.S.C. § 1395i e_t seq.., and the regulations promulgated\npursuant thereto, are being violated by various acts, practices,\nand conditions at ESH.  Our review also indicates that the rights\nof the patients guaranteed by Virginia state law are also being\nviolated.  See, e.g., Va. Code Ann. § 37.1 - 84.1 (Mitchie 1994).\nESH fails to provide constitutionally required treatment and\ntraining to its mentally ill and geriatric population, due in\nlarge part to inadequate numbers of and inadequately trained\nstaff to provide care.  The inadequate staffing and lack of staff\ntraining have resulted in a high number of unnecessary patient\ninjuries and accidents.  Our review of patient accidents and\ninjuries confirmed that inadequate staffing and insufficient\ntraining and supervision are serious deficiencies at ESH.\nPatients are also being denied adequate psychiatric\ntreatment, including treatment programs.  In the absence of\nadequate treatment programs, patients are subjected to\nunreasonable and undue physical restraint.  Our consultants found\nthe use of vest and wrist restraints in the Hancock Geriatric\nUnit to. be excessive.  Moreover, ESH's use and monitoring of\npsychotropic and psychoactive medications represent significant\ndepartures from accepted medical practice.  It is common practice\nat ESH to simply add drugs when the patients fail to respond\nto the current drug therapy —  a professionally unjustified\npractice —  resulting in inappropriate polypharmacy.  Our\nconsultant psychiatrist estimated that at least a quarter of all\nESH patients are receiving unnecessary drugs.\nFinally, as noted in our May 6, 1994, findings letter, ESH\nas a whole \"represents an antiquated, outmoded instrument for\nindividuals with mental illness.\"  ESH fails to provide patients\ntreatment in an environment which meets their individualized\nneeds.  Specifically, the facility fails to provide patients\ntreatment in an environment that promotes their individualized\ngrowth, development, and social well-being and permits the\nexercise of judgment and contact with family members, society and\nmainstream social institutions.  Where mentally ill persons can\nbenefit frcn placement in community based programs and\nfacilities, and especially where professionals have deternir-ed\nthat such placement is appropriate, this unnecessary segregation\n\nof such persons within an institution violates both the ADA and\nSection 504.  Moreover, the Commonwealth has failed to provide\nadequate ccrr.nunity services to prevent the need for continued\nhospitalization and/or repeat hospitalizations due to a lack of\nappropriate alternatives.\nAs we have specified in other correspondence, the remedies\nset forth ir. our letter of May 6, 1994, are necessary to\neliminate continuing constitutional violations as well as the\nfederal statutory and state law violations set forth here.  ESH\nmust be reorganized to:  (1) structure the hospital to serve as\nan acute care facility for individuals requiring evaluation and\nstabilization and  (2) design and expand, as appropriate,\ncommunity-based mental health services for patients who should be\nserved in the community.\nIn closing, I can only express my hope- that we can wor>:\ntogether to resolve this long outstanding matter to the benefit\nof the patients of ESH.\nDeval L.

      "text": "U.S.  Department  of Justice\nCivil Rights Division\nf~xf:.\\' :'f rhr  Itiiinmr  At: •—•\"  Ofir-nl  llti.\\liiti\\tt<m. D.C. 2OOS5\nMAY  6  1994\nThe Honorable George Allen\nGovernor\nCommonwealth of Virginia\nState Capitol\nRichmond, Virginia  23219\nRe: Eastern State Hospital and Hancock Geriatric Center\nDear Governor Allen:\nI am writing in reference to our ongoing investigation of\nthe Eastern State Hospital and the Hancock Geriatric Center\n(hereinafter \"Eastern State\"), Williamsburg, pursuant to the\nCivil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act  (hereinafter\n\"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 1997 et geg.  The purpose of this letter is\nto advise you of the constitutional violations ascertained during\nthis investigation, the supporting facts, and recommended minimum\nremedial measures.\nPatients of state operated psychiatric facilities have a\nfundamental Fourteenth Amendment due process right to reasonable\nsafety and adequate medical care, including psychiatric services.\nYounabera v. Romeo. 457 U.S. 307  (1982).  Patients have a right\nto adequate psychiatric treatment which includes treatment\nprograms designed to protect their liberty interests.  Such\ntreatment programs must be sufficient to permit each resident\nan opportunity to improve or be cured and to function as\nindependently as their psychiatric conditions permit.  See, e.g.,\nWyatt v. Sticknev, 325 F. Supp. 781 (M.D. Ala. 1971).  Such\nprograms must provide opportunities for patients to acquire and\nmaintain skills that will enable each of them to cope more\neffectively with the demands of their own person, their\nenvironment, and to raise the level of their mental, behavioral,\nphysical, and social efficiency.  S_ee, e.g. , Gary W. v.\nLouisiana. 437 F. Supp. 1209, 1219  (E.D. La. 1976).\nThe facts disclosed during the course of our investigation\nsupporting our findings of unconstitutional conditions are set\nforth below.  These facts are based upon tours conducted by our\nconsultants during May, 1993.  The reports of these consultants\nare being sent to the Commissioner of Mental Health, Mental\nRetardation and Substance Abuse under separate cover.\nU.S. v. Virginia\nMH-VA-O62-O6T\n\nI.  Patients are being denied adequate psychiatric treatment,\nincluding treatment programs.\nA.  Patient diagnoses are not developed consistent with\ngenerally accepted professional standards.\nDiagnoses of patients fail to comport with generally\naccepted professional standards.  First, little consideration is\ngiven to patient symptoms, history, or cognitive assessments in\nthe development of a diagnosis.  Psychiatrists appear to rely\nprimarily upon an interview of the patient.  Moreover, to the\nextent relevant assessments are performed, they are superficial\nand do not reflect information professionals generally rely upon\nin utilizing such assessments.  For example, for elderly patients\ncalcium levels were not consistently taken even though inadequate\namounts of calcium can lead to psychiatric symptoms.  Similarly,\ndementia work-ups are often incomplete due to the absence of\nneuroimaging studies which can reveal evidence of a tumor,\nhematoma, or a stroke.  Without complete and adequate\nassessments, a correct diagnosis becomes problematic.\nIn addition, patients often have inconsistent, unreconciled,\ndiagnoses.  For example, while at the facility, one patient had\nbeen diagnosed as suffering from a bipolar disorder and, at a\nlater time, as schizophrenic, paranoid type with mild mental\nretardation.  In another case, a patient had been diagnosed at\nvarious times as suffering from a schizoaffective disorder,\nborderline personality disorder, intermittent explosive disorder,\nand, then, depression.  There was no evidence in the record to\nreconcile these widely varying, conflicting diagnoses.  Absent a\nproper diagnosis, proper treatment is not possible.\nInadequacies in Eastern State's diagnostic procedures,\ncoupled with inadequate assessments, have led to erratic,\ninconsistent, or inaccurate diagnoses of patients.  Although it\nhas been generally accepted in the psychiatric profession for\nmany years that treatment decisions, including diagnoses, should\nbe developed utilizing a multi-disciplinary approach reflecting\nthe direct involvement of the array of professionals involved\nin the treatment of the individual patient, our consulting\npsychiatrist found little, if any evidence that the multi-\ndisciplinary approach was being followed at Eastern State.\nIn sum, defective diagnostic practices fail to reflect compliance\nwith generally accepted medical standards and result in erroneous\ndiagnoses and inadequate treatment.\n\nB.  Treatment plans for patients are inadequate.\nInadequate diagnostic procedures, including the absence of\ninterdisciplinary team involvement, have resulted in treatment\nplans for patients which fail to meet their needs.  The standard\nof care requires the development of comprehensive individualized\nplans for patients by a team of treating professionals, including\npsychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, social workers, various\nrelevant therapists, and direct care workers.  The failure to\ninclude a competent and qualified psychologist in the development\nof a patient's treatment plan is a gross departure from generally\naccepted practice and is unacceptable.\nMoreover, our consulting psychiatrist found that those plans\nin existence do not reflect an integrated treatment approach.\nThe use of medications is not properly integrated with non-drug\ntreatment therapies.  In addition, our psychologist found\ntreatment programs to be deficient.  Significantly, not all\npatients have a treatment plan.  Our psychologist also determined\nthat the goal of the hospital to provide each patient with 4\nhours of psychosocial programming each day is not being met  —\nand would be inadequate in any event.  In addition, he observed a\nsignificant number of residents engaging in inappropriate\nbehaviors who did not have behavior management plans, a\nsubstantial departure from generally accepted practice.\nIn sum, treatment programs, including psychosocial programs,\nrecreation, occupational therapy, and other therapy programs are\ninadequate.\nC.  staffing is inadequate to afford adequate treatment\nprograms.\nDuring the course of his review of treatment and other\ntherapeutic activities at Eastern State, our consulting\npsychologist determined that many patients were not involved in\ntreatment programs due to the absence of adequate staff.  For\nexample, he noted entries in records which indicated that\npatients were not in various activities due to insufficient\nstaff.  In addition, he found that various patients were on units\nmore restrictive than their psychiatric conditions warranted due\nto staffing shortages.  Indeed, he found two female, patients\nliving on an otherwise all male ward because staff on the female\n\n- 4 -\npatients' original living unit was insufficient to protect them.\nFurthermore, he observed rocking and other stereotypic behaviors\nin residents which could be addressed by additional staff.\nD.  In the absence of adequate treatment programs, patients\nare subjected to unreasonable physical restraint.\nHospital policy permits physical restraint or the use of\nseclusion, i.e.. the placement of a patient alone in a locked\nroom, for up to 8 hours.  This policy, especially in light of\nthe absence of any requirement for psychiatric evaluations at\nacceptable intervals, is professionally unacceptable.  Further,\nphysicians' orders for restraint and seclusion are deficient in\nthat they fail to consistently state the behaviors or conditions\nthat would dictate the release of the patient.  Our consultant\nalso found the use of vest and wrist restraints in the Hancock\nUnit to be excessive.  Finally, our psychiatrist noted that the\nseclusion room in Building 12 revealed three dangers: 1) areas\nwhere a patient cannot be observed; 2) ceiling fixtures that\ncould facilitate suicide; and 3) unsafe window screens.\nII.  Medication practices are deficient.\nA.  Pharmacological treatment fails to comport with\nprofessional standards.\nPharmacological treatment at Eastern State is characterized\nby frequent dose changes, drug changes, drug add-ons, and PRNs\n(\"pro  re nata\" or as needed), absent a professionally required\nevaluation of patient need, including an appropriate assessment\nof the use of particular drugs.  Our consultant found\nunacceptable polypharmacy, the use of drugs where there was no\nprofessionally acceptable justification for their use,\ninappropriate dosages, and other deficient practices.\nPsychiatrists at the facility rarely, if ever, devise a\npsychopharmacological plan for a patient and then evaluate drug\neffects at appropriate intervals.  According to our psychiatrist,\nthis leads to the chronic, unnecessary administration of\npsychotropic drugs, including drugs which have not proved\neffective.  It is common practice at Eastern State to simply add\ndrugs when the patient fails to respond to the current drug\ntherapy —  a professionally unjustifiable practice —  resulting\nin inappropriate polypharmacy. . For example, a patient on eight\n\n- 5 -\npsychotropic medications suffered a cardiac arrest.  The\ncardiologist at the facility determined that the cardiac arrest\nwas caused by the multiple medications.  Our psychiatrist\nestimated that at least a quarter of all patients in the facility\nare receiving unnecessary drugs.  In addition, the lack of\nsystematic medication practices has led to inappropriate\npolypharmacy as well as to an inappropriately high rate of PRN\nuse of medication.\nB.  Monitoring of drug usage is deficient.\nMonitoring of drug treatment is deficient in at least two\nrespects.  First, blood level monitoring of psychotropic\nmedication is untimely or not done at all.  For example, when\nlithium blood levels were finally taken for one patient after an\nunreasonable delay, his levels were in the toxic range.  In those\ncases where the levels are taken, physicians often fail to act\nupon the results.  For example, when a patient's level was not in\nthe presumed therapeutic range, no action was taken to increase\nthe medication or change to a different drug.\nIn addition, monitoring of side effects of psychotropic\nmedications is not performed adequately.  Although this problem\nwas noted throughout the facility, it was particularly acute in\nthe Hancock Unit housing elderly patients.  Generally, side\neffects in elderly persons may be more acute due to increased\npharmacosensivity to drugs.  A major side effect of many\npsychoactive medications is a drop in blood pressure upon\nstanding which may cause dizziness, a particular hazard for\nelderly persons who may already be susceptible to falling.  Yet,\nthere is no indication in any patient record that this common\nside effect of psychotropic drugs is being,.monitored.  Moreover,\nthere was no evidence of postural blood pressures or\nelectrocardiograms for elderly patients at varying dosage levels\nto evaluate the effects of the medication on general health.\nFinally, the reporting of adverse drug indications appears\ndeficient.  Eastern State's records indicate that only two\nadverse drug reactions are reported per month.  However, our\npsychiatrist observed that given the present scope of use of\npsychotropic medication at the facility, the system for reporting\nadverse drug reactions is inadequate.\nIn sum, our consultant determined that the use and\nmonitoring of psychotropic drugs represent a significant\ndeparture from generally accepted practice, expose patients to\n\n- 6 -\nharm, and particularly threaten the elderly patients of the\nHancock Unit.\nIII.  General medical care is inadequate.\nOur consultant concluded based upon a review of patient\ncharts and interviews of staff that medical staff fail to respond\nin a timely manner to the serious medical needs of patients.  The\nfailure to intervene in a timely manner ranges from such things\nas the failure to follow-up abnormal lab reports, adjust\nmedications for patients at risk of suicide, perform lab tests\nwhen ordered, or act when patients exhibit severe weight loss, to\nsituations where patients are not transferred to general hospital\nfacilities when necessary.  Our consultant also found excessive\nmortality due to choking and aspiration.  Slow responses in\nevaluating serious medical problems place patients at grave risk.\nAlthough Eastern State has a protocol in place for\nevaluating geriatric patients with a history of falls, physicians\ndo not consistently participate in such evaluations.  Our\nconsultant found numerous cases where a patient was confined to a\ngerichair for unsteadiness but no evaluation or assessment had\nbeen done by a physician as to the cause.  Especially where, as\nhere, patients already at risk of falling are prescribed drugs\nwhere unsteadiness is a recognized side effect, the failure to\ndetermine the reasons for their unsteadiness poses a significant\nthreat to their health and well-being.\nFinally, physician coverage on nights and weekends is\ninadequate.  Presently, one physician is on-site and one is\non-call during these periods of time.  Neither physician,\nhowever, is necessarily a psychiatrist and,  as a result, there\nv\nare significant intervals of time where no 'psychiatrist is\non-duty or on-call.  Moreover, having only one physician on duty\nfor such periods of time is likewise inadequate in light of the\nsize of the population and their complex medical and psychiatric\nproblems.  In addition, due to the lack of psychiatrists, general\nphysicians serve as psychiatrists in the Hancock Unit —  a\nsignificant departure from generally accepted professional\npractice.\nIV.  Fire safety precautions are inadequate.\nAlthough a number of systems are in place to ensure the\nsafety and evacuation of patients in the event of fire, we noted\nthe absence of smoke detectors in the old wing of the hospital.\n\n- 7 -\nThis is a serious deficiency which needs to be remedied in order\nto provide proper, early warning of any fire.\nV.  Minimum remedial measures\nThe following measures need to be implemented at Eastern\nState in order to protect the constitutional rights of patients\nconfined there.\nA.  Psychiatric care:\n1.  Evaluate or assess each patient consistent with\ngenerally accepted psychiatric standards to develop an\nappropriate, accurate diagnosis.\n2.  Based upon an appropriate diagnosis, develop\nthrough a multi, inter-disciplinary approach a professionally\nbased treatment program.  Such programs must be sufficient to\nprovide each patient a reasonable opportunity to be cured,\nimprove, or function as normally as their psychiatric condition\npermits.\n3.  Hire, train, and maintain an appropriate number of\nboth professional and direct care staff to implement such\nprograms, monitor progress, and modify such plans, as\nappropriate.\n4.  Revise seclusion and restraint policies to comport\nwith generally accepted psychiatric standards; modify seclusion\nrooms, as necessary, to ensure reasonable safety.\nB.  Medication practices:  ,.\n1.  Evaluate the drug regimen of each patient to ensure\ncompliance with generally accepted psychiatric standards; develop\na psychopharmacological plan for each patient; ensure that the\nuse of all drugs is professionally justified; eliminate intra-\nclass polypharmacy.\n2.  Develop and implement a professionally based system\nto monitor the use of all psychoactive medication, including\ntimely blood-levels, general monitoring of side-effects, and\nreporting and responding to adverse drug indications.\n\n- 8 -\nC.  General medical:\n1.  Develop and implement an overall system of medical\ncare which is sufficient to respond to the medical needs of all\npatients in a timely manner.\n2.  Hire and retain additional physicians and\npsychiatrists to ensure appropriate physician coverage at all\ntimes; specifically have a psychiatrist on duty at the hospital\nat all times and assign sufficient psychiatrists to the Hancock\nUnit to ensure adequate psychiatric treatment.\n3.  Ensure that geriatric patients at risk of falls are\nadequately evaluated by a physician.\nD.  Fire Safety:\nInstall smoke detectors in the old wing- of Eastern\nState Hospital.\nE.  Re-organization of hospital and services:\nWhile our consultants recognized that the current management\nof the facility is striving to improve conditions, we must note\nthat the facility as a whole represents an antiquated, outmoded\ninstrument for caring for individuals with mental illness.  The\nfacility fails to provide patients treatment in an environment\nthat permits contacts with the rest of society and mainstream\nsocial institutions, demands independent functioning and permits\nthe exercise of judgment, and contact with family members.  In\nre-organizing Eastern State to implement the remedies outlined\nabove, state officials must act to (1) structure the hospital to\nserve as an acute care facility for individuals requiring\nevaluation and stabilization and  (2) design and expand, as\nappropriate, community-based mental health services to serve most\nother patients.\nOur consultants concluded that, with some exceptions, the\nfacility did not provide nor seek to provide more than basic\ncustodial care.  Treatment programs, an appropriate therapeutic\nenvironment, and other activities needed to provide opportunities\nto patients to be cured or improve their mental condition simply\ndid not exist.  In these circumstances, immediate steps need to\nbe taken to develop a plan which will, as outlined above,\nmaterially alter the operation of the hospital and develop\n\n-  9  -\nalternate, community based services which offer a reasonable\npromise of protecting the liberty interests of patients on the\nmost cost efficient basis.\nPursuant to CRIPA, the Attorney General may initiate a\nlawsuit to correct deficiencies at an institution or otherwise\nact to protect the rights of patients 49 days after appropriate\nofficials have been notified of the relevant violations of law.\n42 U.S.C. § 1997b(a)(l).  Therefore, we anticipate hearing from\nyou as soon as possible and not later than 49 days after the date\nof this letter with any response you may have to our findings and\na description of the specific steps you have taken or intend to\ntake on both a long and short term basis to implement the\nremedies identified in this letter.  If you do not respond within\nthe designated time period, we will consider initiating an action\nagainst your jurisdiction to remedy the unconstitutional\nconditions we have identified.  In your response, please indicate\nyour willingness to enter into a judicially enforceable agreement\nto memorialize any agreement we may subsequently reach in this\nmatter.\nWe look forward to working with you to resolve this matter\nin a reasonable and practical manner.
