    "summary": "<p>On November 22, 1983, a lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas against the Governor of Arkansas, the Arkansas Department of Human Services (DHS), and its Division of Mental Health Services (MHS), Mental Health Board, Division of Developmental Disability Services (DDS), and Developmental Disability Service Board.  On September 24,1984, the court certified the class, which it defined as all institutionalized persons in the custody of DHS now and in the future.  The plaintiffs, represented by Central Arkansas Legal Services, sought injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 alleging that the State had failed to properly treat and train institutionalized persons.  </p><p>On January 17, 1985, the parties entered a consent decree.  Under the part pertaining to developmental disability services, Arkansas agreed to have a psychologist (Dr. John Marr) evaluate and recommend changes to their disability services.  The court approved the psychologist's comprehensive recommendations, submitted to the court on May 23, 1985, and ordered the State to retain the psychologist as a monitor and consultant for at least a year.</p><p>On July 1, 1986, only three of the psychologist's fourteen recommendations regarding developmental disability services had been satisfied.  The plaintiffs asked the court to find the State in contempt of the consent decree.  Before a ruling was announced, however, the parties entered into a second consent decree on March 12, 1987.  Under the terms of the second consent decree, the State would solicit funds from the State legislature to (1) renovate and build new facilities, (2) hire psychologists, and (3) improve the wages of direct care workers.  </p><p>The legislature denied the State's request for additional funds for disability services.  On November 24, 1987, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas (Judge Henry Woods) found that the State had satisfied the terms of the second consent decree by requesting the funds, but vacated the second consent decree.  Baldridge v. Clinton, 674 F. Supp. 665 (E.D. Ark. 1987).  The court reasoned that the second consent decree did not properly address compliance problems because it was developed without the input of the psychologist monitor, did not comport with the psychologist's recommendations, and implied that the State's duty to serve individuals with developmental disabilities was limited by funding.  The court disagreed with this proposition, holding that a shortage of funds does not eliminate the State's duty to provide comprehensive and meaningful services for persons with developmental disabilities.</p><p>On February 4, 1991, the Advocates for Human Development Center Residents, an organization comprised of many of the people included in the class description, sought to intervene on behalf of the defendants.  The court recognized the motion to intervene as evidence of a fissure in the interests of the class members and proposed decertifying the class on May 8, 1991.  On September 13, 1991, the court formally decertified the class for three reasons.  Baldridge v. Stockley, 139 F.R.D. 119 (D. Ark. 1991).  First, common circumstances were not sufficient to unite the class in place of a common issue of law or fact, neither of which existed anymore.  Second, the interests of the named plaintiffs, all living in the community by 1991, were no longer typical of institutionalized persons.  Although the plaintiffs argued that one named plaintiff received respite care from an institution, the court held that institutional respite care did not constitute institutionalization.  Third, the court expressed concerns about the strength of the plaintiffs' claims.  Specifically, the court found that only one claim, challenging the constitutionality of restraints, was properly stated but that even it was not supported by evidence of the widespread misuse of restraints.</p><p>In dismissing the Complaint, the court noted that its judgment did not preclude individuals from pursuing their own claims of constitutional violations.  We do not know, however, whether any of the individual class members filed their own lawsuits.</p><p></p>",

Arkansas, W.D.\nNovember 24, 1987.\n666 *666 Griffin J. Stockley, Central Arkansas Legal Services, Little Rock, Ark., for plaintiffs.\nDebby Thetford Nye, General Counsel, R.B. Friedlander, Sp. Counsel to the Atty. Gen., Little Rock, Ark., for\ndefendants.\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\nHENRY WOODS, District Judge.\nOn October 5, 1987, the court held an evidentiary hearing on the plaintiffs' May 1 and May 26, 1987, motions for\ncontempt, in which the plaintiffs alleged the defendants to be in violation of the March 12, 1987, consent decree\nentered herein and the court's order of May 23, 1985, respectively. For the reasons that follow, these motions are\ndenied.\nI. BACKGROUND\nThis case was filed in November, 1983, as a class action on behalf of patients confined at the Arkansas State\nHospital, residents of the Human Development Centers (HDC), and residents of the Benton Services Center\n(BSC). The complaint was brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, to redress alleged deprivations of rights\n[1]\nsecured by the First, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution,  and pursuant to 29\nU.S.C. § 794 and 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(c). It alleged that the Department of Human Services (DHS), and its\ndivisions of Mental Health (DMH) and Developmental Disabilities Services (DDS), failed to provide adequate\ntreatment, training and appropriate placement for certain individuals within its institutions. Both declaratory and\ninjunctive relief were prayed for.\nA class was certified and defined to include the named plaintiffs and all other institutionalized persons who now,\nor in the future, are in the custody of the DHS, including DMH and DDS, and who have been identified by\nappropriate professionals as receiving inadequate treatment, care and/or training, or being inappropriately\nplaced. The parties stipulated to the relevant facts on May 18, 1984, and on January 17, 1985, they entered into\na consent order. That order was based in part on the stipulations (1) that some of the named plaintiffs were\nidentified by appropriate professionals as requiring services and training in a behavioral disorder unit, and (2) that\na certain number of residents within the institutions had been identified by qualified professionals as requiring\ndifferent placements and services.\nAs a method of resolving the plaintiffs' claims, the defendants agreed to employ Dr. John Marr, a psychologist at\n667 the University of Arkansas, to review the adequacy of DMH treatment and the DDS training *667 plan developed\nfor day service, habilitation and training for developmentally disabled individuals residing in the Arkansas State\nHospital. Dr. Marr was also to review the final survey report of the Health Care Financing Administration to be\nreceived by DDS for the purpose of determining the appropriateness of services and programs for mentally\n\nretarded persons residing at BSC, and to evaluate the need for a special treatment unit (STU) for women.\nFollowing these reviews Dr. Marr filed his report with the court.\nOn May 23, 1985, the court entered an order which endorsed the comprehensive recommendations in Dr. Marr's\nReport and required the defendants to incorporate those recommendations into their plans. That order also\nrequired that Dr. Marr be retained for at least one additional year to monitor the defendants' progress and report\nto the court on a quarterly basis. In Dr. Marr's fourth quarterly report, dated July 1, 1986, he found that, to date,\nonly three of his original fourteen recommendations had been fulfilled. It was this conclusion which prompted the\nplaintiffs to file their first motion for contempt, on which a hearing was set for March 16, 1987. That hearing did\nnot take place, however, because on March 12, 1987, the parties entered into a second consent decree which is\nthe subject of the present motion for contempt.\nIn the March 12, 1987, order the defendants agreed to take the steps necessary to bring themselves into\ncompliance with Dr. Marr's recommendations, and by implication with the court's May 23, 1985, order.\nSpecifically, the defendants agreed to:\n(1) immediately request the 76th Arkansas General Assembly to appropriate sufficient funds for\nconstruction or renovation of Rogers Hall;\n(2) request immediately the 76th Arkansas General Assembly to amend the proper appropriation\nbill(s) to allow DHS to hire psychologists (L 124) at a special entry rate of Grade 23, Step 8; and\n(3) request immediately the 76th Arkansas General Assembly to amend the proper appropriation\nbill(s) to allow DHS to hire, at an increase of two grade levels, employees classified as MR Aide\nTrainee, MR Aide I and II, MR Aide Supervisor, Mental Health Aide and MH Worker.\n[2]\nThe order further provided that Dr. Marr was to continue to monitor each of the six areas stated therein  and\nreport to the court on a semiannual basis.\nThe plaintiffs now move the court to hold the defendants in contempt for their alleged failure to comply with the\nterms of the May 23, 1985, order requiring them to implement Dr. Marr's recommendations, and the March 12,\n1987, order setting forth the steps to be taken toward achievement of that goal. The motion alleges that the\nArkansas Legislature failed to fund the Rogers Hall project and to increase salaries of direct care personnel and\npsychologists as described in the consent decree. The plaintiffs argue that because of these failures the\ndefendants are unable to provide adequate treatment, training and care. The defendants respond that they\nagreed to take certain steps in the March 12, 1987, consent order and that they have fully complied with its\nprovisions.\nII. DISCUSSION\nTo prevail on their motion for civil contempt, the plaintiffs must prove with clear and convincing evidence that the\ndefendants have failed to use reasonable energy and diligence to comply with a clear and unambiguous court\norder. EEOC v. Local 28 of Sheet Metal Workers International Association, 753 F.2d 1172 (2nd Cir.1985),cert.\ngranted, 474 U.S. 815, 106 S.Ct. 58, 88 L.Ed.2d 47 (1985), aff'd, ___ U.S. ___, 106 S.Ct. 3019, 92 L.Ed.2d 344\n(1986). The scope of the consent order at issue here must be discerned within its four corners, and not by\nreference to what might satisfy the purposes of one of the parties to it. United States v. Armour & Co., 402 U.S.\n668 673, 681-82, 91 S.Ct. 1752, 1757-58, 29 L.Ed.2d 256 (1971). It must be construed *668 as it is written, and not\nas it might have been written had the plaintiffs established their factual claims and legal theories in litigation. Id.\n402 U.S. at 682, 91 S.Ct. at 1757. The consent order sets forth three specific affirmative acts which were to be\nperformed by the defendants. Each will be discussed in turn.\nFirst, under the terms of the consent order, the defendants were to \"immediately request\" the Arkansas\nLegislature to appropriate funds for the renovation of Rogers Hall. At the outset the court notes that the language\nused by the parties in their drafting of the consent order, which is very specific, requires only that a request be\n\nmade. It does not require that the defendants' request be granted. The court must now determine whether the\nclause in question, as interpreted, has been complied with by the defendant.\nHerman Harley, Deputy Director of Mental Health, testified that the inadequacies of Rogers Hall have been\nbrought to the attention of every General Assembly for the last ten years. He further testified that, pursuant to the\nconsent order, twelve million dollars ($12 million) was requested from the 76th General Assembly, of which five\nmillion dollars ($5 million) was actually appropriated. Harley related that the appropriation for Rogers Hall was\nplaced in \"category `B'\" by the Legislature and has not yet been funded. Bill Goodman, Assistant Director for\nResearch and Fiscal Services, Bureau of Legislative Research of the Arkansas Legislative Council, testified that\nmoney for the Rogers Hall appropriation must come from the General Improvement Fund and that, within that\nfund, the Governor has no authority to release \"B\" funds until all of \"category `A'\" has been funded. In response\nto the court's question, Goodman conceded that no \"category `B'\" projects were likely to be funded this biennium.\nThus, although there will be no funding for the much needed renovation of Rogers Hall, the court cannot\nconclude that the defendants failed to comply with the agreed terms of the March 12, 1987 order. They agreed\nonly to request funding from the Arkansas Legislature and that agreement was honored.\nThe defendants' second obligation under the March 12, 1987, order was to \"immediately request\" the Arkansas\nLegislature to amend appropriation bills to allow DHS to hire psychologists at a special entry rate of Grade 23,\nStep 8. The evidence at the hearing showed that this provision was fully complied with, in that the request was\nmade and approved.\nAnita Curtis, Deputy Director of the Division of Management Services within DHS, testified that, on the advice of\nthe Legislative Personnel Committee, the special rate of compensation for psychologists was reduced to Grade\n23, Step 5 statewide, but for DHS and MH the psychologist's salary will be paid at Step 8. No evidence was\nintroduced to rebut this testimony, although Dr. Marr did take issue with the initial decision to set the entry rate at\nsuch a high step rather than seeking an entry rate starting at a lower step within a higher grade. Dr. Marr's\nobjections go to the substance of the agreement, however, and not to its interpretation which is, at this point, all\nthe court is concerned with.\nFinally, the defendants were to \"request immediately\" that the Arkansas Legislature amend the proper\nappropriation bills to allow DHS to hire direct care employees classified as MR Aide Trainee, MR Aide I and II,\nMR Aide Supervisor, Mental Health Aide and MH Worker, all at an increase of two grade levels. Anne Majure,\nDeputy Director for the Division of Developmental Disability Services testified that she was not sure why the\nabove classifications were singled out, because they were only one segment of people in the Human\nDevelopment Centers that were in direct contact with clients, but stated that a salary increase for the specified\nclassifications had already been implemented. She testified that the increase implemented was a two-step\nincrease, rather than a two-grade increase as requested, because DHS was bound by the provisions of the\nClassification Compensation Act established by the legislature. Further testimony indicated that it was the\n669 Legislative Personnel Committee's *669 determination that the two-grade increase was not appropriate.\nBased on the testimony summarized above, the court finds that the defendants have complied with the provision\nof the March 12, 1987, consent order requiring them to request a two-grade salary increase for the enumerated\nclasses of direct-care employees. Again, Dr. Marr took issue with the decision to limit the increases to the\nenumerated classes, but that criticism does not affect the court's interpretation of the agreed language of the\norder.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nThe defendants have fully complied with the agreed terms of the March 12, 1987, consent order which, by\nimplication, superceded the May 23, 1985, order requiring the defendants to implement Dr. Marr's\nrecommendations. Accordingly, the court finds that the plaintiffs' motion for contempt should be, and is hereby\nordered denied.\n\nNotwithstanding the court's finding that the defendants are not in contempt, there remain severe and disturbing\nproblems with regard to inadequate care, treatment, training and placement of the plaintiff class. Dr. Marr, the\ncourt-appointed expert agreed to by the parties, testified that he was not consulted in a meaningful way by either\nparty prior to the negotiation, drafting or submission of the March 12, 1987, consent order to the court. He further\ntestified that the terms of the order were inconsistent with his earlier recommendations. The court finds this to be\ninexcusable.\nDr. Marr's report to the court dated September 25, 1987, which was received in evidence and is incorporated\nherein by reference, discusses: (1) the existing needs of dually-diagnosed clients (those having emotional\nproblems and requiring habilitation, training and services) at Rogers Hall; (2) the inadequate therapeutic\nenvironment at Rogers Hall, including both the physical structure and staff-provided services; (3) problems of\nhigh turnover and low morale of direct care and professional staff associated with inadequate compensation, and\nthe dangerous climate created thereby; (4) the lack of an alternative programming policy to the locked facility\nmodel; (5) inadequacy of the referral process policy of women requiring an STU program; and (6) continuing\nproblems in the delivery of adequate treatment and services for patients at Rogers Hall, Benton Services Center\nand the Human Development Centers.\nDr. Marr's report concludes with the following statement and recommendations:\nDDS and DMHS central offices are caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place. They\nare told there is no more money available from above but that they better make sure that their\ninstitutions and services receive favorable evaluations from Federal Inspection Teams and Class\nAction Monitors. Yet there is no way to adequately treat, train, or provide services to the persons\nunder their care with the money available. Innovative planning and provision of services must be\nsuspended while they attempt to mask the tragedy that is taking place.\nIt is recommended that:\n1. This fiscal year every full-time employee who delivers treatment, training, or services to clients\nor who supervises and trains direct care employees receive an increase in compensation that is\ncompetitive with the marketplace. No person who supervises these persons should receive less\nmoney than those they supervise.\n2. This fiscal year the number of positions necessary to adequately treat, train, or care for clients\nwho have behavioral problems be increased and the number of supervisors and professionals\nwho supervise those positions be increased.\n3. The construction funds necessary for Rogers Hall be obtained this fiscal year.\n4. A behaviorally trained psychologist be appointed to coordinate services for dually-diagnosed\nclients at Rogers Hall.\n5. The Agreement between DMHS and DDS concerning dually-diagnosed clients at Rogers Hall\nbe revised,\na. To include a provision for monitoring by a qualified team within DHS.\n670 *670 b. To include a provision that dually-diagnosed clients will begin receiving services for each\ndiagnosed need within 30 days of their dual diagnosis.\n6. The treatment and programming policy as an alternative to the STU model be developed by\nDHS (Section IV) and a copy submitted to me before January, 1988.\n7. Until such an alternative is approved and in operation, the STU at Alexander HDC and ITP at\nWarren HDC be staffed so that they can deliver adequate services to clients in those units.\n8. That the Referral Policy for admission to the STU and ITP be followed in all cases.\n\n9. That psychologists receive a Grade increase equivalent to the step increase requested by the\nState in the last Legislative Session.\nWhile the court agrees with Dr. Marr that the fundamental problem is lack of money and not the defendants' lack\nof good-faith efforts, the court also recognizes that what is appropriate care, treatment and placement must be\ndetermined by a qualified professional based upon medical and psychological criteria, not upon what resources\nare available. Lelsz v. Kavanagh, 824 F.2d 372 (5th Cir.1987) (citing Clark v. Cohen, 613 F.Supp. 684, 704 N. 13\n(E.D.Penn.1985)). The obligation of the defendants to eliminate existing unconstitutionalities cannot depend upon\nwhat the Governor or the Legislature may do. Rather, if Arkansas is going to operate a state hospital system, it is\ngoing to have to be one countenanced by the constitution of the United States. Welsch v. Likins, 550 F.2d 1122\n(8th Cir.1977); Holt v. Sarver, 309 F.Supp. 362, 385 (E.D.Ark.1970),aff'd,442 F.2d 304 (8th Cir.1971) (Henley,\nC.J., addressing conditions of the Arkansas Prison System).\nDr. Marr has concluded, and the court agrees, that treatment, care and placement decisions within DMH are\ncontrolled by the availability of funding (or lack thereof) and not by professional judgment. Moreover, his\nassessment of the quality and availability of care and treatment leads the court to believe that the plaintiff class is\nbeing deprived of minimal constitutional liberties. See Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73\nL.Ed.2d 28 (1982); Vitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480, 491-94, 100 S.Ct. 1254, 1262-64, 63 L.Ed.2d 552 (1980); Mills\nv. Rogers, 457 U.S. 291, 298-302 (1982); Lelsz v. Kavanagh, 807 F.2d 1243, 1249-51 (5th Cir. 1987),reh'g\ndenied en banc,815 F.2d 1034. The Eighth Circuit has held that lack of funds or facilities cannot justify lack of\ncompetent medical care for prison inmates. Finney v. Arkansas Board of Correction, 505 F.2d 194 (8th Cir.1974). \nSee also Jackson v. Bishop, 404 F.2d 571, 580 (8th Cir. 1968) (humane considerations and constitutional\nrequirements are not, in this day, to be measured or limited by dollar considerations....). Neither should lack of\nfunding be available as an excuse for the defendants' failure to provide the plaintiff class, who through no fault of\ntheir own are clients of the state hospital system, with minimally adequate care, treatment and placement.\nAccordingly, the consent order of March 12, 1987, is hereby ordered vacated. The parties are directed to consult\nwith Dr. Marr for the purpose of formulating a plan to implement the recommnendations contained in his\nSeptember 25, 1987, report to the court. A proposed plan shall be drafted by the plaintiffs, with the assistance\nand counsel of Dr. Marr, and served upon the defendants within sixty (60) days of this order. The defendants'\nobjections are to be served on the plaintiffs within the thirty (30) days following service. An additional thirty (30)\ndays shall be granted during which time the parties, with the counsel of Dr. Marr, shall attempt to reach an\nagreement on contested issues. At the expiration of that time the proposed plan shall be submitted to the court\nfor ruling.\n[1]Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982), holds that all involuntary residents\nof state-operated institutions for the mentally retarded possess constitutionally protected liberty interests\nguaranteed by the due process clause of the 14th Amendment.
