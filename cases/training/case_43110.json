The court provided the parties with feedback and potential avenues to resolve their disagreement without the need for formal motion practice, and directed them to further meet and confer to discuss those options. The court further directed the parties that, if they are still unable to reach agreement, they should contact the undersigned's chambers to request a follow-up discovery conference.

    "summary": "<p>This is a case challenging the Wichita Police Department&rsquo;s (WPD) usage of gang lists, alleging that they imposed a disparate impact on Black and Latinx residents and that they were unconstitutional in their implementation. The plaintiffs, Progeny (a community-based organization seeking to prevent the incarceration of young people) and Wichita residents who had been impacted by these policies, were represented by Kansas Appleseed Center for Law &amp; Justice and the ACLU of Kansas. The plaintiffs filed suit against the City of Wichita and WPD on April 15, 2021, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983. They sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief striking down WPD's use of gang lists and enjoining future usage and a declaratory judgment that the Gang Member Designation statute (K.S.A. 21-6313, &ldquo;the Statute&rdquo;) and related policies were unconstitutional. The case was assigned to Chief Judge Eric F. Melgren.</p>\r\n<p>WPD was provided discretionary authorization to designate individuals as gang members or affiliates pursuant to the Statute. The plaintiffs alleged that the Statute and WPD&rsquo;s internal policy disproportionately affected Black and Latinx communities&mdash;Black people comprised 10% of Wichita&rsquo;s total population yet represented 60% of the gang list, while Latinx individuals comprised 17% of the total population and 25% of the gang list. For comparison, the plaintiffs noted that while white people comprised an overwhelming majority of total population, they only comprised 6% of the gang list.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Statute designated anyone who met 3 out of 10 factors to be a gang member. The factors outlined by the Statute and adopted by WPD in making determinations were activities that the plaintiffs alleged were generally innocuous on their face. Simply being seen in particular colors, talking to previously identified individuals on the gang list, or being spotted in certain areas of the city were considered factors in the determination. Additionally, WPD officers were provided discretionary power to tack on an additional factor on the basis of their suspicions.</p>\r\n<p>Regardless of if they were minors, individuals placed on the gang list were given no notice of their status; and, if they became aware, were provided no recourse to contest the determination. Once on the list, the plaintiffs alleged that individuals often found themselves subject to harassment and frequent encounters with local law enforcement. Further, if someone on the gang list was arrested in the course of committing a felonious act, the minimum bail was set at $50,000, regardless of the severity of the charges. Presence on the gang list lasted for 3 years, but this time-frame was reset anytime an officer noted that an individual had engaged in any activities under the Statute. If someone went 3 years without engaging in any of these activities, they were not removed from the list, but rather labeled &ldquo;inactive&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs contended that the Statute and WPD&rsquo;s procedures constituted a violation of substantive due process rights by subjecting them to unlawful interrogations, searches, surveillance, and detention based on gang list status. They further asserted that these policies and procedures denied them their rights to free association and assembly under the First Amendment, and had a chilling effect on free association and assembly amongst the community at-large. They asserted that their due process rights had been infringed upon due to the vagueness of the Statute and their inability to contest placement on the gang list. They further alleged that the gang lists had a disparate impact on Black and Latinx communities in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. To these ends, plaintiffs sought class certification, a class-wide judgment that the Statute and WPD procedures violated the Constitution, a preliminary and permanent injunction forbidding the use of gang lists, attorneys&rsquo; fees, and further relief as the court deemed necessary.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on July 9, 2021, citing a lack of standing and failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The court partially granted this motion on January 10, 2022. Judge Melgren concluded that Progeny had standing to bring a First Amendment claim on its own behalf because the Statute effectively prohibited the organization from hosting town halls or other large-scale meetings, since the attendance of an individual on the gang list put all attendees at risk of being placed on the list. The court determined, however, that Progeny did not have associational standing to bring Due Process or First Amendment claims on behalf of its members because the claims relied on \"individualized proof.\" 2022 WL 93406.</p>\r\n<p>The court further found that the individual plaintiffs had satisfied the \"stigma plus\" test and plausibly alleged that they had been deprived of a protected liberty by the defendants' actions. Judge Melgren dismissed the plaintiffs' Substantive Due Process claims, however, finding that the allegations did not implicate fundamental rights or were \"more appropriately analyzed under the framework of a different amendment.\" The court summarily dismissed the Equal Protection claims, finding that the plaintiffs had failed to plausibly allege that WPD intentionally discriminated against Black and Latinx communities. Because the suit was brought against the relevant government entity, the court additionally dismissed the claims against the WPD Chief of Police and Lieutenant in their official capacity as redundant.</p>\r\n<p>After the court&rsquo;s ruling, the parties began settlement negotiations while the litigation continued into the discovery phase.&nbsp;On June 30, 2023, the plaintiffs moved for class certification. The plaintiffs reasoned that, since the core of their complaints in the lawsuit was the Gang List and WPD's alleged refusal to change it, all members of the Gang List ought to be part of the class.</p>\r\n<p>On September 30, 2023, both parties moved for summary judgment. The defendants argued that the maintenance of a gang list did not deprive anybody of a constitutionally protected interest. The plaintiffs conversely argued that there was no genuine issue of material fact and that the evidence was overwhelmingly on their side, citing the life-altering effect that being labeled a gang member has on people on the list.</p>\r\n<p>On October 10, 2023, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification, certifying a class of &ldquo;[a]ll living persons included in the Wichita Police Department's Gang List or Gang Database[] as an Active or Inactive Gang Member or Gang Associate.&rdquo; 2023 WL 6597768.</p>\r\n<p>The court ruled on the summary judgment motions on January 30, 2024. The court held that Progeny lacked standing to bring a due process claim based on the law's vagueness, and that all plaintiffs lacked standing to bring First Amendment claims based on the alleged direct prohibition of expressive conduct. However, as to the other claims, the court denied summary judgment to both parties because genuine issues of material fact existed. Therefore, the claims that survived were 1) the individual plaintiffs' vagueness due process claims, 2) the individual plaintiffs' procedural due process claims, and 3) all plaintiffs' the First Amendment claim based on chilled speech and association. 2024 WL 359345.</p>\r\n<p>Trial was scheduled for May 2024, but the parties settled a month before that. Under the settlement agreement, Wichita agreed to various changes to the Gang List, including:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>removing some of the criteria that would cause someone to be on the list, and clarifying other criteria</li>\r\n<li>allowing negotiated intervention agreements for juveniles to avoid being put on the Gang List</li>\r\n<li>changing the minimum duration that a person stays on the Gang List from three years to two</li>\r\n<li>removing the \"inactive\" and \"associate\" portions of the Gang&nbsp;List</li>\r\n<li>notifying anyone added to the list in the future</li>\r\n<li>allowing people on the list to see the evidence and appeal the designation</li>\r\n<li>annually auditing the Gang List to make sure it complies with revised policies</li>\r\n<li>training WPD on the revised Gang List policies</li>\r\n<li>immediately reviewing whether the named plaintiffs should be on the Gang List</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The settlement agreement also required the defendants to pay the plaintiffs $550,000 in attorneys' fees. It stated that a Special Master would monitor Wichita's compliance for three years.</p>\r\n<p>The court granted final approval of the settlement on August 26, 2024. 2024 WL 3936466. The case is ongoing as of October 20, 2024.</p>",

In January, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion to dismiss, finding that the plaintiffs failed to sufficiently allege Substantive Due Process and Equal Protection violations, but allowing the First Amendment, vagueness, and Procedural Due Process claims to go forward. The court granted partial summary judgment for the defendants on January 30, 2024, leaving three categories of live claims: vagueness (Due Process), procedural due process, and chilled speech/association (First Amendment). The parties settled in May 2024, and the court granted final approval of the settlement on August 26, 2024.

On April 15, 2021, Plaintiffs filed a civil action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 against the \nCity in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas (โthe Courtโ), captioned Progeny \net al. v. City of Wichita, Kansas, Case No. 21-cv-1100-EDM (โthe Actionโ). \n \n2.  In the Action, Plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of K.S.A. ยง 21-6313 et seq. and \nassert that the Wichita Police Departmentโs (โWPDโ) policies and practices \nimplementing K.S.A. ยง 21-6313 et seq. through the creation and maintenance of a \ndatabase and/or list of individuals believed to be gang members or associates (โthe Gang \nDatabaseโ or โGang Listโ) violate Plaintiffsโ rights to due process, equal protection, and \nfreedom of expression and association under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nU.S. Constitution.  \n \n3.  On October 10, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiffsโ motion for class certification pursuant \nto Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 (Doc. 212). The Court certified the following class: \nโAll living persons included in the Wichita Police Departmentโs Gang List or Gang \nDatabase as an Active or Inactive Gang Member or Gang Associate.โ \n \n4.  On January 30, 2024, the Court denied the Partiesโ cross-motions for summary judgment \n(Doc. 234).  \n \n5.  This Agreement is neither an admission of liability by the City nor a concession by \nPlaintiffs that their claims are not well founded.   \n \n6.  This Agreement is conditioned on approval by the Court, as required by Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 23. In the event the Court fails to approve settlement, this Agreement \nshall be null and void.   \n \n7.  To avoid the delay, uncertainty, inconvenience, and expense of protracted litigation of the \nabove claims, and in consideration of the mutual promises and obligations of this \nAgreement, the Parties agree and covenant as follows: \n \nTERMS \n \n  The City hereby agrees to implement the following revisions to existing WPD policies \nand practices and to enact new policies and practices that effectuate the terms of this Agreement. \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 254-1   Filed 05/09/24   Page 3 of 24\nI.  WPD POLICY 527, SECTION E.  \n \nThe City shall revise WPD Policy 527, Section E, to state as follows: \n \nInitial identification will be based upon the criteria outlined in this Policy. The identified \nindividual will remain listed as a โcriminal street gang memberโ for a minimum of two (2) years. \nIf the identified individual is incarcerated, either by a City, County, State, or Federal agency, the \ntwo (2) year limit will stop until the identified individual is released from custody. If after the \ninitial two (2) year period there is no documented activity, the individual will be removed from \nthe WPD Gang Database (also known as the WPD Master Gang List) and the flag will be \nremoved from Niche or any successor records management software. However, the two (2) year \nperiod will start over if: \n \na.  There is documentation indicating the person continues to meet the criteria to be \nlisted as a โcriminal street gang memberโ according to this policy, or  \n \nb.  The person is involved in Criminal Street Gang Activity or a Gang Related incident \nas defined by this policy. \n \nWPD personnel shall not refer to an individualโs gang status in eJustice or any legacy software to \nsupport identification of individuals to the Gang Database.  \n \nII.  WPD POLICY 527, SECTION F. \n \nThe City shall revise WPD Policy 527 to add a new Section F, which shall state as \nfollows: \n \n1.  A person may be added to the WPD Gang Database if they self-admit to being a member \nof a criminal street gang. \n \na.  If a WPD officer or other law enforcement official requests to add a person to \nthe WPD Gang Database based only on the criteria that the person self-\nadmitted to criminal street gang membership, the official must complete a \nsigned, sworn affidavit attesting to the circumstances surrounding the personโs \nadmission. \n \n2.  A WPD officer or other Sedgwick County or City of Wichita law enforcement official \nmay nominate a person 13 years or older for inclusion in the WPD Gang Database only if \nthe person meets three (3) of the following criteria within a twelve-month period. \n \na.  A parent or guardian provides a documented statement to Sedgwick County or \nCity of Wichita law enforcement personnel that the person is 13 years of age \nor older and is a member of a particularly named criminal street gang. \n \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 254-1   Filed 05/09/24   Page 4 of 24\nb.  The person is identified as a criminal street gang member by a federal, state, \ncounty, or city law enforcement officer or correctional officer or documented \nreliable informant and such identification is corroborated by independent \ninformation.  For purposes of this criteria, โindependent informationโ must \nconcern activity within 3 years prior to the individualโs nomination to the \nGang Database, and must be of the type described in criteria (a) or (c)-(g) of \nthis Policy.  The same information may not be used to satisfy more than one \ncriteria for inclusion in the WPD Gang Database.  \n \nc.  The person is observed in a business or residence two or more times in six \nmonths that has a prior documented pattern of gang violence or activity, and \nthere is no good faith basis for the person to be at that business or residence, \nsuch as to purchase goods or services, attend school, for employment \npurposes, or to participate in recreational activities, unless such activities are \norganized for the purpose of engaging in criminal street gang activity; \n \nd.  The person adopts two or more of the following as observed in person by a \nSedgwick County or City of Wichita law enforcement officer, or as \ndocumented by physical evidence including but not limited to photographs, \nsocial media posts, or other documents: (1) a particular color of attire, (2) \nattire with gang insignia, (3) the use of hand signs, or (4) particular tattoos, \nand the nominating officer can articulate a reasonable basis for the belief that \nthe particular display is associated with membership in a criminal street gang;  \n \ne.  The person has been arrested more than once in the company of individuals \npresently listed as criminal street gang members in the WPD Gang Database; \n \nf.  The person has participated in or undergone activities self-identified or \nidentified by a reliable informant to be part of a gang initiation ritual; \n \ng.  The person has been observed in the company of known criminal street gang \nmembers two or more times while participating in criminal street gang \nactivity. The observing Sedgwick County or City of Wichita officer must \narticulate a reasonable basis for their belief that each the person was observed \nparticipating in criminal street gang activity. There is a presumption that \npresence at or engagement in the following activities does not constitute \ncriminal street gang activity for purposes of this criteria: funerals, weddings, \nfamily celebrations, large public gatherings for entertainment purposes, \neducational functions, and religious or political gatherings. \n \n3.  In the event that an individual 13 through 17 years of age is found to meet the criteria \nnecessary to be listed in the Gang Database: \n \na.  The WPD will use best efforts to notify the juvenile and the juvenileโs parent \nor guardian that the juvenile has met the criteria to be added to the Database, \nand attempt to enter into an agreement with the juvenile and the juvenile's \n3 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 254-1   Filed 05/09/24   Page 5 of 24\nparent or guardian (โintervention agreementโ) to correct the behavior that has \nled to the meeting of the criteria within 12 months.    \n \nb.  If such an intervention agreement is reached, in the interim, the juvenileโs \nnomination in the Gang Database will be considered provisional, and in the \nevent the juvenile successfully completes the terms of the intervention \nagreement, the juvenile will not be added to the Gang Database.   \n \nc.  If the juvenile is not successful in meeting the terms of the intervention \nagreement within the agreed upon timeframe, WPD may, in its discretion, \ninclude the juvenile in the Gang Database, or agree to an extension of the \nintervention agreement. In the event any juvenile is ultimately included in the \nGang Database, the attempts to enter an agreement and the bases for \ndetermining that the agreement has not been fulfilled will be documented in \nthat juvenileโs Gang Database entry. \n \nIII.  WPD POLICY 527, SECTION G. \n \nThe City shall revise WPD Policy 527 to add a new Section G, which shall state as \nfollows:  \n \n1.  When a juvenile at or above the age of 13 meets the Criminal Street Gang Member \ncriteria found in this Policy, a supervisor from the Gang/Felony Assault Section will \nattempt to contact the parent and/or guardian of the juvenile. The parent and/or guardian \nwill be told how the juvenile met the gang criteria and will be informed of intervention \noptions and resources, including a potential intervention agreement pursuant to Section F. \nA juvenile younger than 13 may not be identified as a criminal street gang member \npursuant to Section F unless that juvenile has engaged in activities that could be charged \nas a violent crime. All notification efforts and results will be documented by WPD. \n \n2.  When a person over the age of 18 is identified as a criminal street gang member and \nadded to the WPD Gang Database, a supervisor from the Gang/Felony Assault Section \nwill send a written notification to that individual at their last known address. If the \nGang/Felony Assault Section and/or another unit of WPD is in communication with the \nperson through other means, the supervisor will also attempt to utilize those \ncommunication channels to inform the person that they were added to the WPD Gang \nDatabase.

However, the Special Master may request to see supporting \ndocumentation for a subset of those individuals added or renewed on the Gang \nDatabase as a result of the annual audit, consistent with Paragraph 2, above. \n \n8.  The Special Masterโs first review of the above documents shall occur in person at a WPD \noffice to be specified by the City, at a date and time mutually agreed upon by the Special \nMaster and the City. Subsequent document reviews may be conducted virtually if the \nParties agree to do so. To that end, at the Special Masterโs request, WPD shall produce to \nSpecial Master the entries and supporting documentation described above, pursuant to the \nProtective Order. \n \n9.  The Special Master shall report to the Parties the results of his or her review of the above \nmaterials, including any deficiencies the Special Master has identified regarding the \nCityโs compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, within thirty (30) days of the \nconclusion of each review.

The City shall have six (6) weeks to implement any necessary corrective action plan \nidentified by the Special Master. \n \n12. The Special Master shall review the implemented corrective action within one week of \nreceiving notice from the City that the corrective action has been implemented, and \nwithin one week of review, issue notice to the Parties regarding the sufficiency of the \ncorrective action. \n \n13. If Plaintiffs are dissatisfied that the Cityโs corrective action plan is sufficient to remedy \nany deficiencies identified by the Special Master, Plaintiffs may, at their election, \ncontinue attempting to resolve the issue with the City and/or the Special Master or file for \nenforcement of the Agreement with the Court. \n \n14.

Named Plaintiffs agree not to file a future facial challenge to K.S.A. ยง 21-6313 et seq.  \nagainst the City or its current employees in any such action. \n \nXIV.  PRESS RELEASE LANGUAGE. \n \nThe Parties agree that the following language shall be included in each Partyโs respective \npress release announcing the settlement of the Action: \n \nThis mediated agreement narrows and clarifies the criteria the Wichita Police Department \ncan use to place a person on the gang list/database, with increased oversight on the gang \nlist/database process to review when and how someone can be listed. In addition, the WPD \nwill create a method for members of the public to check and see if they are included on the \ngang list/database and an appeal process if the person believes their designation is incorrect. \n13 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 254-1   Filed 05/09/24   Page 15 of 24\nThis mediated agreement is intended to protect the constitutional rights of the citizens of \nWichita and allow law enforcement to conduct effective investigations for public safety. \n \nXV.

The  named  Plaintiffsโ\nChristopher Cooper, Elbert Costello, Martel Costello and Jeremy Levy, Jr.โ filed this class action \nasserting claims under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 for declaratory and injunctive relief against Defendant \nthe City of Wichita (the โCityโ). Plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of K.S.A. ยง 21-6313 et \nseq.  and  asserted  that  the  Wichita  Police  Departmentโs  (โWPDโ)  policies  and  practices \nimplementing K.S.A. ยง 21-6313 et seq. through creating and maintaining a database and/or list of \nindividuals the WPD has designated as gang members or associates (โthe Gang Databaseโ or \nโGang Listโ) violate Plaintiffsโ First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process, equal \nprotection, and freedom of expression and association. The Court preliminarily approved the \npartiesโ proposed Settlement Agreement (โthe Settlement Agreementโ).1  \n \n1 Doc. 256. \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 273   Filed 08/26/24   Page 2 of 8\nThe parties provided Court-approved notice to class members, the Court held a final \nfairness hearing on August 23, 2024, and the Court now considers the Settlement Agreement for \nfinal approval and entry. Having reviewed the Motion, the Settlement Agreement, the Proposed \nOrder, the objections, and all other documents and exhibits attached to the Motion, as well as \nhaving  considered  the  statements  made  at  the  August  23  hearing,  the  Court  finds  that  the \nAgreement is fair, reasonable, and adequate, and grants the Motion. \nI.  Factual and Procedural Background \nThe parties notified the Court of settlement on April 4, 2024. Soon after, the parties filed \nthe proposed Settlement Agreement. In short, the Settlement Agreement resolves all claims \nbrought on behalf of the Class in exchange for detailed actions to be taken by the City as set forth \nin full in Exhibit A to the Motion. Among other things, the new procedures remove from the Gang \nList all gang associates and inactive gang members or associates, institute a notice requirement for \npersons added to the Gang List, create an appeals process for those challenging their inclusion on \nthe Gang List, and create a method for minors to avoid having their names added to the Gang List. \nFurthermore, the Settlement Agreement provides for the appointment of a Judge, Paul Gurney, as \nSpecial Master to oversee the implementation of the Settlement Agreementโs terms for a period of \nthree years.  The Settlement Agreement itself will be binding on the City for three years, with \nPlaintiffs retaining the option to request the leave of the Court to extend that period. \nThe Court reviewed and preliminarily approved these terms, with instruction to give notice \nby publication via Court-approved Long Form and Short Form Notices of Settlement.2 The Notices \nincluded a brief explanation of the lawsuit, a description of the proposed terms of the Agreement, \ninstructions  for  submitting  comments  in  support  of  or  in  objection  to  the  settlement,  and \n \n2 Doc. 256. \n2 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 273   Filed 08/26/24   Page 3 of 8\ninstructions for requesting to appear at the fairness hearing. While the notice period was pending, \nthe parties stipulated to appoint Robert J. Moody of Martin Pringle Oliver Wallace & Bauer LLP \nas the first Gang Review Ombudsperson.   \nClass members were given approximately 70 days to submit written comments. The Court \nreceived written comments from 19 individuals, 7 of whom objected. Following the end of the \nobjection period, the Court held a fairness hearing on August 23, 2024. The Court considered the \nsubmitted objections and additional statements from affected individuals with argument from the \nparties. \nII.  Legal Standard \nFederal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  23(e)  authorizes  a  court  to  approve  a  class  action \nsettlement after notice, a hearing, and โon finding that [the settlement] is fair, reasonable, and \nadequate.โ Courts within the Tenth Circuit determine whether a proposed settlement is fair, \nreasonable, and adequate by considering: \n1.  whether  the  proposed  settlement  was  fairly  and  honestly  negotiated; \n \n2.  whether serious questions of law and fact exist, placing the ultimate outcome \nof the litigation in doubt; \n \n3.  whether the value of an immediate recovery outweighs the mere possibility of \nfuture relief after protracted and expensive litigation; and \n \n4.  the judgment of the parties that the settlement is fair and reasonable.3 \n \nThese inquiries do not require the court to โconduct a foray into the wilderness in search of \nevidence that might undermine the conclusion that the settlement is fair.โ4 But the court also may \nnot โrely solely upon the assertions of the proponents of the settlement as to what the evidence \n \n3 Rutter & Wilbanks Corp. v. Shell Oil Co., 314 F.3d 1180, 1188 (10th Cir. 2002) (quoting Gottlieb v. Wiles, 11 F.3d \n1004, 1014 (10th Cir. 1993), abrogated on other grounds by Devlin v. Scardelletti, 536 U.S. 1 (2002)). \n4 Gottlieb, 11 F.3d at 1015. \n3 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 273   Filed 08/26/24   Page 4 of 8\nshows.โ5 Rather, the court must undertake an independent analysis of โthe evidence before itโ to \nreach its conclusion.6 The proponents of the settlement bear the burden to provide sufficient \nevidence to enable the court to conclude that the settlement is fair.7 \nIII.  Analysis \nA.  Settlement Approval Factors Support the Agreement \nThe evidence presented to the Court supports adoption of the Agreement.  \nFirst, the Court has no reason to believe that the parties did not fairly and honestly negotiate \nthe proposed settlement. As discussed in the Motion and at the May 16, 2024 preliminary approval \nhearing, the parties engaged in lengthy and detailed settlement negotiations beginning in March \n2022. The parties first retained former Kansas City Mayor Sly James, a mediator experienced both \nin city government and plaintiff-side civil litigation, to assist them in exploring settlement. The \nparties engaged in four sessions with James from October 13, 2022, to April 10, 2023. In addition, \nthe parties exchanged numerous revised proposals and met again without James on November 1, \n2022, and April 12 and 21, 2023. Though not immediately successful, the parties agree these \nnegotiations were productive and resulted in consensus on the majority of the terms ultimately \nmemorialized in the Settlement Agreement with the further assistance of a second mediator, retired \nJohnson County District Court Judge Paul Gurney, over two more additional mediation sessions. \nFurthermore, nothing in the Settlement Agreement, the partiesโ briefing, or the history of this case \nsuggests impropriety or dishonesty. The Settlement Agreement does not preferentially favor the \nnamed Plaintiffs and appears to be the product of serious, informed, non-collusive negotiations. \nTherefore, this factor favors approving the Settlement Agreement. \n \n5 Id. \n6 Id. \n7 Id.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 273   Filed 08/26/24   Page 5 of 8\nSecond, serious questions of law and fact exist, as set out in this Courtโs order denying the \npartiesโ cross motions for summary judgment.8 Such questions place the ultimate outcome of the \nlitigation in doubt. This factor likewise favors approval. \nThird, the value of an immediate recovery heavily outweighs the mere possibility of future \nrelief after protracted and expensive litigation. This is particularly true because the Settlement \nAgreement provides injunctive relief to remedy the ongoing issues protested by Plaintiffs on behalf \nof the class. \nFinally, the parties agree that the Settlement Agreement is fair and reasonable. Class \nCounsel for Plaintiffs reached this conclusion based on their long track record of overseeing \nmultiple class settlements, and the named Plaintiffs likewise approve. Defendant also represented \nthrough counsel that the Settlement Agreement is fair and reasonable. Therefore, this factor favors \nfinal approval of the Settlement Agreement. \nB.  Objections by Class Members Overruled \nFinding that the evidence presented supports approval of the settlement, the Court now \nconsiders whether the filed objections otherwise require disapproval. The Court received  written \ncomments from 19 individuals.  Of those 19 individuals, the Court construes 7 of them as objecting \nto the settlement. Two of those seven do not appear to be Class members, but rather family \nmembers of Class members.  \nThe objections fault the settlement for the following reasons: not eliminating the Gang \nList/Database entirely; not requiring the City to issue an apology or admission of wrongdoing; not \nrequiring the City to pay more in attorneysโ fees and costs; not providing financial compensation \nto individual Class members; not adequately addressing the objectorsโ individual circumstances \n \n8 Doc. 234.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 273   Filed 08/26/24   Page 6 of 8\nby removing them from the Gang List/Database or providing retroactive alteration of prison \nsentences; requiring incarcerated Class members to challenge their inclusion through an attorney; \nand general unspecified dissatisfaction with the proposed changes to WPD Policy 527.  \nUltimately, these objections do not address the four factors the Court is required to evaluate \nin assessing whether a settlement is fair, reasonable, or adequate.9 In particular, the objections do \nnot address the third factor of whether the value of an immediate recovery outweighs the mere \npossibility of future reliefโand here, the Court finds that the immediate recovery offered in the \nSettlement  Agreement  heavily  outweighs  the  mere  possibility  of  the  complete  victory  the \nobjections insist upon. Furthermore, the objections either misapprehend the terms of the Settlement \nAgreement, or they criticize the Agreement for not requiring more onerous terms or even total \ncapitulation from the City. โThe test is whether the settlement is adequate and reasonable and not \nwhether a better settlement is conceivable.โ10 To the extent these objectors seek individual money \ndamages or other relief beyond the equitable remedies that Plaintiffs requested in this case, the \nproposed settlement does not bar objectors from independently bringing such claims. Accordingly, \nthe Court overrules these objections. \nIV.  Conclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court FINDS and ORDERS as follows: \n1.  The class action settlement, as memorialized in the Settlement Agreement, is fair, \nreasonable, and adequate. It resulted from extensive armโs length, good faith negotiations between \nthe parties through experienced counsel, with the assistance of independent mediators, and meets \nall other requirements of the Federal Rules.   \n \n9 Rutter & Wilbanks, 314 F.3d at 1188. \n10 Williams Foods, Inc. v.

Organizational \nPlaintiff Progeny, along with individual Plaintiffs Christopher Cooper, Elbert Costello, Martel \nCostello and Jeremy Levy, Jr., bring this putative class action on behalf of themselves and others \nsimilarly situated.  Broadly speaking, they seek relief from Defendant City of Wichitaโs โGang \nList,โ along with the statutes and local policies that enable it.  The Gang List is purportedly a list \nof persons, created and maintained by the Wichita Police Department (โWPDโ), whom WPD \npersonnel have determined meet the definition of a โcriminal street gang memberโ under the \ncriteria set out in K.S.A. ยง 21-6313(b). The individual Plaintiffs allege they were wrongfully \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 212   Filed 10/10/23   Page 2 of 19\ndesignated as โcriminal street gang member[s]โ and added to the Gang List, which has negatively \naffected their lives in a host of ways.  Ultimately, Plaintiffs seek as relief a declaration that K.S.A. \nยง 21-6313 is unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments and injunctive relief \neffectively dismantling the Gang List.  In their present Motion, Plaintiffs request certification as a \nclass under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2).  For the reasons stated below, the Court \ngrants Plaintiffsโ Motion and appoints Plaintiffsโ counsel as class counsel under Rule 23(g). \nI.  Factual and Procedural Background \nAt the heart of this constitutional quagmire is a relatively brief definitional statute.  K.S.A. \nยง 21-6313 defines several terms relevant to criminal gangs, including a definition of a โcriminal \nstreet gangโ1 and โcriminal street gang activity.โ2  But for present purposes, the most important \nparts of ยง 21-6313 are its definitions of โcriminal street gang memberโ and โcriminal street gang \nassociate.โ  A โcriminal street gang memberโ is a person who either admits to their membership \nin a gang or meets three of the following statutory criteria, while a โcriminal street gang associateโ \nis someone who admits to gang associateships or meets only meet two: \n(A) Is identified as a criminal street gang member by a parent or guardian; \n(B) is identified as a criminal street gang member by a state, county or city law \nenforcement officer or correctional officer or documented reliable informant; \n(C) is identified as a criminal street gang member by an informant of previously \nuntested  reliability  and  such  identification  is  corroborated  by  independent \ninformation; \n(D) frequents a particular criminal street gangโs area; \n(E) adopts such gangโs style of dress, color, use of hand signs or tattoos; \n(F) associates with known criminal street gang members; \n(G) has been arrested more than once in the company of identified criminal street \ngang members for offenses which are consistent with usual criminal street gang \nactivity; \n \n1 K.S.A. ยง 21-6313(a). \n2 Id. ยง 21-6313(c). \n-2- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 212   Filed 10/10/23   Page 3 of 19\n(H) is identified as a criminal street gang member by physical evidence including, \nbut not limited to, photographs or other documentation; \n(I) has been stopped in the company of known criminal street gang members two \nor more times; or \n(J) has participated in or undergone activities self-identified or identified by a \nreliable informant as a criminal street gang initiation ritual.3 \n \nThe various definitions of ยง 21-6313 apply both to the statute itself and subsequent \nstatutory sections.  For example, K.S.A. ยง 21-6316 sets a minimum bail of $50,000 for โcriminal \nstreet gang membersโ arrested for a person felony, subject to a few exceptions. \nWPD policy puts ยง 21-6313 into practice on the streets of Wichita.  Specifically, Policy \n527 defines the procedures for an individualโs inclusion on the Gang List.  โAny state, county, or \ncity law enforcement officer or correctional officer may nominateโ an individual for inclusion on \nthe Gang List.  After this nomination, the individual will be added to the Gang List if they meet \nthe criteria of ยง 21-6313.  Once on the Gang List, Policy 527 provides that the individual will \nremain on either โactiveโ or โassociateโ status for a minimum of three years.  If, after three years, \nthe individual has not engaged in documented criminal street gang activity, the individual will be \ndesignated โinactiveโ in the Gang List.  But this three-year period starts over if an officer \ndocuments that the individual either meets the criteria set out in ยง 21-6313(b) or that the individual \nhas been involved in criminal street gang activity or a gang-related incident, as defined by the \nstatute.  Officers of the WPD monitor members of the Gang List for any violations of probation \nconditions, bond, and pretrial restrictions.  Policy 527 further specifies that the Gang List is \nconfidential and will only be released to commissioned law enforcement, correctional officers, and \nthose authorized to receive Gang List information by various high-level supervisors within the \n \n3 Id. ยง 21-6313(b)(2)(A)โ(J). \n-3- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 212   Filed 10/10/23   Page 4 of 19\nWPD.  Once on the Gang List, Policy 527 does not provide an opportunity for an individual to \nremove their name the Gang List entirely.  Rather, the individual simply may be labeled โinactive.โ   \nFour  individuals  and  one  nonprofit  entity  make  up  the  named  Plaintiffs.  Plaintiff \nChristopher Cooper first learned he was on the Gang List in 2014 when he was arrested for first \ndegree murder.  Plaintiff Elbert Costello first learned he was on the Gang List in 1997, when he \nwas arrested in connection with a shooting.  Plaintiff Martel Costello believes he was first added \nto the Gang List in 2016 because of his association with relatives, presumably also members of \nthe Gang List, rather than any conduct on his part.  On two separate occasions, Martel was \nattending funeral services for a family member when he was found to have violated his parole \nbecause family members on the Gang List were also in attendance.  Martel is incarcerated for these \nviolations until at least 2023.  Plaintiff Jeremy Levy, Jr., believes he was added to the Gang List \nat 13 years old when he was pulled over by the WPD while riding in a car with one of his cousins, \nwho was already on the Gang List.  Five years later, Levy was charged with first-degree felony \nmurder.  Levy was convicted and is currently incarcerated until at least 2042. \nRounding out the named Plaintiffs, Progeny is a nonprofit organization in Wichita, Kansas, \nthat operates โas a youth/adult partnership focused on reimagining the juvenile justice system and \nreinventing in community-based alternatives.โ  Progeny states that, because K.S.A. ยง 21-6313 and \nPolicy 527 list โassociat[ing] with known criminal street gang membersโ as one of the criteria for \nbeing designated or renewed as a โcriminal street gang member,โ it is strongly discouraged from \nhosting town halls or meetings of any kind, as they might result in even more people being added \nto the Gang List.  Progeny believes ยง 21-6313 and Policy 527 effectively prohibit it from providing \nservices to those individuals known to be on the Gang List, as doing so may result in Gang List \ndesignations for Progeny members working with those perons. \n-4- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 212   Filed 10/10/23   Page 5 of 19\nTogether, named Plaintiffs asserted a putative class action against the City of Wichita4 on \nApril 15, 2021.  Plaintiffs allege that ยง 21-6313 and Defendantโs policies and practices violated \ntheir rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  They \nseek certification as a class under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), and injunctive and declaratory relief.  \nFor a class definition, Plaintiffs propose, โAll persons included in the Wichita Police Departmentโs \nGang List as an Active or Inactive Gang Member or Gang Associate.โ  In total, the Gang List and \nGang Database list 5,245 personsโ1,728 active gang members, 3,296 inactive gang members, and \n221 gang associates. \nPlaintiffs present six common questions they claim apply to all proposed class members: \n(1) Whether Kan. Stat. Ann. ยง 21-6313 and WPD Policy 527 are unconstitutionally \nvague because they โfail[] to provide people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable \nopportunity to understand what conduct [they] prohibit[]โ or they โauthorize[] or \neven encourage[] arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.โ \n \n(2) Whether people on the Gang List โpossess a protected interest such that the due \nprocess protections were applicable.โ \n \n(3) Whether Kan. Stat. Ann. ยง 21-6313 and WPD Policy 527 fail to provide \nprocedural protections required by Due Process and the Constitution before adding \nsomeone to the Gang List. \n \n(4) Whether being on the Gang List deprives people of their liberty interest in their \nโgood name, reputation, honor, or integrity.โ \n \n(5) Whether Kan. Stat. Ann. ยง 21-6313 and WPD Policy 527 deprive people on the \nGang List of their liberty interest in freedom pending trial based on the increased \nbail requirement. \n \n(6) Whether Kan. Stat. Ann. ยง 21-6313 and WPD Policy 527 have a chilling effect \non the freedoms of expression and association of people on the Gang List and \nunconstitutionally prohibit people on the Gang List from freely associating with \nfriends, family, or community members. \n \n4 WPD Chief Gordon Ramsey, and WPD Gang Unit Supervisor, Lieutenant Chad Beard were also named as \ndefendants in their official capacities but were dismissed pursuant to this Courtโs order on Defendantsโ partially \nsuccessful motion to dismiss on January 10, 2022 (Doc. 28). \n-5- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 212   Filed 10/10/23   Page 6 of 19\n \nWithin their Motion, Plaintiffs request that the Court appoint the following persons as class \ncounsel under Rule 23(g): Jordan Carmichael Baehr, Mitchell F. Engel, Paul Monroe Vogel, and \nThomas J. Sullivan of Shook, Hardy & Bacon LLP; Karen Ellen Leve, Kunyu L. Ching, and \nSharon Brett of the ACLU Foundation of Kansas; and Teresa A. Woody of Kansas Appleseed \nCenter for Law and Justice, Inc.  Each of these attorneys have represented Plaintiffs throughout \nthe course of this case. \nII.  Legal Standard \nFed. R. Civ. Proc. 23 governs the certification of class actions.  โIn determining the \npropriety of a class action, the question is not whether the plaintiff or plaintiffs have stated a cause \nof action or will prevail on the merits, but rather whether the requirements of Rule 23 are met.โ5  \nIn ruling on a motion for class certification, courts must accept the facts contained within the \nplaintiffโs complaint as true.6  Although โa courtโs class-certification analysis must be rigorous \nand may entail some overlap with the merits of the plaintiffโs underlying claim, Rule 23 grants \ncourts no license to engage in free-ranging merits inquiries at the certification stage.โ7  Thus, \nโ[m]erits questions may be considered to the extentโbut only to the extentโthat they are relevant \n \n5 DG ex rel.

In this case, Plaintiffs seek to proceed under Rule 23(b)(2), which \nstates โ[a] class action may be maintained if Rule 23(a) is satisfied and if . . . the party opposing \nthe class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final \ninjunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.โ  \n \n8 Id. at 466. \n9 See id.

Analysis \n   Plaintiffs seek to certify a class under Rule 23(b)(2).  As an initial matter, Defendant is \nripping, roaring, and raring to adjudicate Plaintiffsโ claims on the merits, dedicating nearly the \nentirety of their Response to this end.  The Court, however, is mindful of the stage of this case.  To \nthe extent Defendant wants a battle over the substantive issues of Plaintiffsโ claims, it is free to \nassert substantive arguments in a motion for summary judgment.14  Here, the Court will only \naddress substantive matters to the extent they are relevant under Rule 23โs standards for class \ncertification. \nA.  Class definition \nIn determining whether to certify a class, the Court first addresses the proposed class \ndefinition.15  โDefining the class is of critical importance because it identifies the persons (1) \nentitled to relief, (2) bound by a final judgment, and (3) entitled under Rule 23(c)(2) to the best \nnotice practicable in a Rule 23(b)(3) action.โ16  Therefore, the definition must be โprecise, \nobjective, and presently ascertainable.โ17 \nHere, Plaintiffs seek to certify the following class: โAll persons included in the Wichita \nPolice Departmentโs Gang List as an Active or Inactive Gang Member or Gang Associate.โ  \nDefendant objects to this definition on two grounds.18  First, Defendant claims the definition is \noverbroad by including inactive and even deceased gang members and gang associates contained \n \n14 At the time of writing, cross motions for summary judgment have already been filed by the parties. \n15 Eatinger v. BP Am. Prod. Co., 271 F.R.D. 253, 257โ58 (D. Kan. 2010). \n16 In re Urethane Antitrust Litig., 237 F.R.D. 440, 444 (D. Kan. 2006) (quoting Manual for Complex \nLitigation ยง 21.222, at 270 (4th ed.2005)) (further quotations omitted). \n17 Id. \n18 That is, Defendant objects on two grounds that do not delve into substantive arguments best left for \nsummary judgment. \n-8- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 212   Filed 10/10/23   Page 9 of 19\nin the WPDโs Gang Database.19  Including deceased persons within the class definition would be \nnonsensical.  Therefore, the Court agrees that including deceased gang members as members of \nthe class definition is unnecessarily overbroad.  However, Defendants offer no real argument as to \nhow persons classified as โinactiveโ on the Gang List transforms the proposed class definition \nanything other than precise, objective, and presently ascertainable.   \nSecond,  Defendant  argues  that  the  definition  improperly  includes  juveniles.    While \nDefendant  claims  that  juveniles  on  the  Gang  List  have  extra  procedural  protectionsโthus \nrendering them less susceptible to Plaintiffsโ claimed injuriesโthis is irrelevant to whether the \nclass is objective, precise, and presently ascertainable.  Furthermore, in making this argument, \nDefendant relies on facts outside the pleadings.  At this stage of the case, the Court relies on \nPlaintiffโs factual allegations instead of Defendantโs own contended facts.   \nIn sum, the Court finds the following definition to be precise, objective, and readily \nascertainable: โAll living persons included in the Wichita Police Departmentโs Gang List or Gang \nDatabased as an Active or Inactive Gang Member or Gang Associate.โ  The addition of โlivingโ \nand  โGang  Databaseโ  sufficiently  address  Defendantโs  concerns  regarding  the  definitionโs \noverbreadth as proposed by Plaintiffs.  Accordingly, the Court will utilize this definition when \nanalyzing Plaintiffsโ proposed class under Rule 23. \nB.  Rule 23(a)โs requirements \nNext, the Court must determine whether Plaintiffs can establish a prima facie case under \nRule 23(a)โs four requirements: (1) numerosity; (2) commonality; (3) typicality; and (4) adequacy.  \nThe Court will examine each requirement in turn. \n \n19 The Court notes that Defendantโs Response appears to be the first time in this case that Defendant \ndistinguishes between the โMaster Gang Listโ and the WPD Gang Database. \n-9- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 212   Filed 10/10/23   Page 10 of 19\n1.  Numerosity \nUnder Rule 23(a), the proposed class must be so โnumerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable.โ20  To show numerosity, plaintiffs โmust produce some evidence or otherwise \nestablish by reasonable estimate the number of class members who may be involved.โ21  This Court \nhas held that โa good faith estimate of at least 50 members is a sufficient size to maintain a class \naction.โ22 Even so, the numerosity inquiry looks beyond the sheer number of proposed class \nmembers.23  Courts should also examine โfactors like the practical viability of individual suits in \nterms of inconvenience, inefficiency and the size of the individual claims, requests for injunctive \nor declaratory relief, and the location and distribution of class members.โ24  For example, classes \nwith a โfluid natureโ that โmakes identifying class members difficult, if not impossibleโ  favor \nfinding sufficient numerosity.25 \nHere, Plaintiffs have sufficiently established numerosity.  Plaintiffs wish to include every \nperson listed on the Gang Listโ5,245 persons total with 1,728 active gang members, 3,296 \ninactive gang members, and 221 gang associates.  Individual suits are not practically viable \nbecause there are thousands of class members.  Furthermore, the class members are presumably \nlocated around the Wichita area, and thus geographically condensed.  Finally, Plaintiffs request \n \n20 Fed. R. Civ.

Moreover, Defendant neglects to argue that Plaintiffs fail \nto establish numerosity in this case.  Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have adequately \nshown that the class size is sufficiently numerous under Rule 23(a)(1). \n2.   Commonality \n  To establish commonality of issues, plaintiffs must show that a โcommon contention [is] \nof such a nature that it is capable of classwide resolution.โ26  The inquiry here  is not โwhether \ncommon questions predominate, but in order to determine (as Rule 23(a)(2) requires) whether \nthere is even a single common question.โ27  As such, the emphasis of Rule 23โs commonality \nrequirements is not the existence of โcommon questionsโ but rather whether those common \nquestions would result in โcommon answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.โ28  What \nmatters is whether โdetermination of [the common questionโs] truth or falsity will resolve an issue \nthat is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.โ29   \n  Defendant argues that Plaintiffs fail to show that even a single common question capable \nof generating a common answer is available to Plaintiffs here.30  Plaintiffs identify six common \nquestions that they claim are capable of resolution regarding all proposed class members: \n(1) Whether Kan.

(further citation and quotations omitted). \n30 Defendant primarily takes issue with the merits of these questions, arguing that Plaintiffs cannot prevail \non them.  However, the Court will not conduct an in-depth inquiry into the merits of Plaintiffsโ claims at the class \ncertification stage.  Rather, the Court will focus its inquiry on whether even a single question presented by Plaintiff \nwould result in a common answer for all class members.   \n-11- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 212   Filed 10/10/23   Page 12 of 19\nopportunity to understand what conduct [they] prohibit[]โ or they โauthorize[] or \neven encourage[] arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.โ \n \n(2) Whether people on the Gang List โpossess a protected interest such that the due \nprocess protections were applicable.โ \n \n(3) Whether Kan. Stat. Ann. ยง 21-6313 and WPD Policy 527 fail to provide \nprocedural protections required by Due Process and the Constitution before adding \nsomeone to the Gang List. \n \n(4) Whether being on the Gang List deprives people of their liberty interest in their \nโgood name, reputation, honor, or integrity.โ \n \n(5) Whether Kan. Stat. Ann. ยง 21-6313 and WPD Policy 527 deprive people on the \nGang List of their liberty interest in freedom pending trial based on the increased \nbail requirement. \n \n(6) Whether Kan. Stat. Ann. ยง 21-6313 and WPD Policy 527 have a chilling effect \non the freedoms of expression and association of people on the Gang List and \nunconstitutionally prohibit people on the Gang List from freely associating with \nfriends, family, or community members. \n \nAt a bare minimum, Plaintiffsโ first proposed question necessitates an answer common to \nevery one of Plaintiffsโ proposed class members.  Indeed, it is difficult to conceive of a more \ngenerally  applicable  question  than  whether  a  statuteโhere,  K.S.A.  ยง 21-6313โis \nunconstitutionally vague.  Unconstitutionally vague statutes by their very nature impart the same \ninjury to all persons.  Furthermore, whether persons on the Gang List possess a protected interest \nis a question capable of a common answer which will apply to each of Plaintiffsโ proposed class \nmembers.  The same is true regarding Plaintiffsโ question of whether K.S.A. ยง 21-6313 and WPD \nPolicy 527 fail to provide procedural protections to persons on the Gang List.  Finally, if inclusion \nin the Gang List has a chilling effect on personsโ freedom of association, that will be true across \nthe board.  If not, that will also be a common answer for every class member.   \nIn  contrast,  the  fourth  question  requires  individualized  proof  of  reputational  harm.  \nSimilarly, the fifth question is incapable of providing a common answer because not every person \n-12- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 212   Filed 10/10/23   Page 13 of 19\non the Gang List awaits trial or will ever do so.  Still, the existence of individualized questions \ndoes not preclude the certification of Plaintiffsโ proposed class.  Holding otherwise would ignore \nexplicit precedent stating only one common question is necessary to certify a class under Rule 23.  \nThus, the Court finds that Plaintiffs sufficiently meet the commonality test under Rule 23(a)(2). \n3.  Typicality \n  Under Rule 23(a)(3), plaintiffs must show that the โclaims or defenses of the representative \nparties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class.โ  The test for this requirement looks past \ndiffering factual situations โso long as the claims of named plaintiffs and class members are based \non the same legal or remedial theory.โ31  Thus, โ[a] named plaintiffโs interests and claims do not \nneed to be identical to class membersโ interests and claims to satisfy typicality, but they must not \nbe significantly antagonistic.โ32  While conclusory allegations of typicality are insufficient to meet \nRule 23(a)(3)โs requirement, โ[d]emonstrating typicality is not an onerous burden.โ33  Indeed, \nplaintiffs  who  demonstrate  commonality  will  usually  meet  the  typicality  standard  as  โ[t]he \ncommonality and typicality requirements of Rule 23(a) tend to merge.โ34 \n  As above in the commonality analysis, the individual Plaintiffs present claims and interests \nclosely aligned with those of each class member.  The core of each Plaintiffsโ case is that inclusion \non the Gang List violates their constitutional rights, thus exposing each to the same risk of harm.  \nTherefore, Plaintiffsโ claims stem from facts common to all class members (inclusion on the Gang \n \n31 In re Motor Fuel Temperature Sales Pracs.

Jiffy Lube Intโl, Inc., 250 F.R.D. 607, 622 (D.

Plaintiffsโ claims are in no way antagonistic to the proposed class \nmembersโ  interests.    This  is  true  despite  the  differing  factual  circumstances  between  class \nmembers, such as being added to the Gang List based on different criteria, not undergoing criminal \nprosecution, or not being aware of their inclusion on the Gang List.   \nRegarding Progeny, which as an entity is not on the Gang List, Defendant makes no attempt \nto  show  that  Progenyโs  interests  are  antagonistic  to  those  of  the  proposed  class  members.  \nAccordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have met their burden of showing that their claims \nare typical of the class membersโ claims.   \n4.  Adequacy \n  Rule 23(a)(4) inquires into whether the named plaintiffs โwill fairly and adequately protect \nthe interests of the class.โ35  Under this analysis, two questions are significant.36  First, courts must \nexamine whether conflicts of interest exist between the named plaintiffs and the other class \nmembers.37  Second, courts must examine the adequacy of the named plaintiffs and their counsel \nsuch that the class members can expect vigorous prosecution of the action.38  As this Court has \npreviously stated: \nMinor conflicts between class members do not prevent certification.  Only a \nfundamental conflict about the specific issues in controversy will prevent a named \nplaintiff from representing the interests of the class adequately.  A fundamental \nconflict exists where some class members claim an injury resulting from conduct \nthat benefited other class members.39 \n \n35 Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 23(a)(4). \n36 See Tripp, 310 F.R.D. at 506. \n37 Id. \n38 Id. \n39 Id. (citations omitted). \n-14- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 212   Filed 10/10/23   Page 15 of 19\n \n  Here, neither party has identified any conflicts of interest that might exist between the \nnamed Plaintiffs and proposed class members.  Indeed, Defendant fails to substantively address \nRule 23(a)(4) at all in their Response.  It seems clear that Plaintiffsโ interests closely align with the \ninterests of the proposed class members such that Plaintiffs are motived to litigate this case.  Thus, \nPlaintiffs have met the first part of the adequacy test. \n  Similarly,  the  parties  do  not  contest  the  named  Plaintiffsโ  investment  and  vigorous \nprosecution of this case.  For over two years, Plaintiffs have consistently submitted and responded \nto motions and participated in discovery.  Nothing in Plaintiffsโ behavior during the course of this \ncase gives the Court any reason to doubt the sincerity and motivation of Plaintiffs to vigorously \nprosecute this case.   Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiffs meet Rule 23(a)(4)โs adequacy \nstandard. \nB.  Plaintiffs sufficiently fulfill Rule 23(b)(2)โs requirements. \n  Having concluded that Plaintiffs meet Rule 23(a)โs requirements, the Court must determine \nwhether Plaintiffs can also show that their proposed class qualify under one of Rule 23(b)โs \ncategories.  Plaintiffs seek class certification under Rule 23(b)(2), which states โ[a] class action \nmay be maintained if Rule 23(a) is satisfied and if . . . the party opposing the class has acted or \nrefused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or \ncorresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.โ  The Tenth Circuit \nhas characterized Rule 23(b)(2)โs standard as requiring โcohesiveness,โ which has two distinct \nelements: \nFirst, plaintiffs must illustrate the class is sufficiently cohesive that any classwide \ninjunctive relief satisfies Rule 65(d)โs requirement that every injunction state its \nterms specifically; and describe in reasonable detail . . . the act or acts restrained or \nrequired. Second, cohesiveness also requires that class membersโ injuries are \n-15- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 212   Filed 10/10/23   Page 16 of 19\nsufficiently  similar  that  they  can  be  remedied  in  a  single  injunction  without \ndifferentiating between class members.40 \n \n  โRule 23(b)(2)โs bottom line, therefore, demands at the class certification stage plaintiffs \ndescribe in reasonably particular detail the injunctive relief they seek such that the district court \ncan at least conceive of an injunction that would satisfy Rule 65(d)โs requirements, as well as the \nrequirements of Rule 23(b)(2).โ41  In other words, Rule 23(b)(2) โrequire[s] that a class must be \namenable to uniform group remedies.โ42  The Tenth Circuit has further stated \n[a] class action may not be certified under Rule 23(b)(2) if relief specifically \ntailored to each class member would be necessary to correct the allegedly wrongful \nconduct of the defendant.  So, if redressing the class membersโ injuries requires \ntime-consuming inquiry into individual circumstances or characteristics of class \nmembers or groups of class members, the suit could become unmanageable and \nlittle value would be gained in proceeding as a class action . . . .  In short, under \nRule 23(b)(2) the class membersโ injuries must be sufficiently similar that they can \nbe addressed in a[] single injunction that need not differentiate between class \nmembers.43 \n \n  Here, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant acted or refused to act by applying the Gang List \ncriteria under K.S.A. ยง 21-6313 and WPD Policy 527 to add persons to the Gang List without \nprocedural protections for those persons.  These grounds apply to the entire class of persons added \nto the Gang List as a gang member or gang associates.  Furthermore, Plaintiffsโ requested relief is, \nat its core, simpleโto enjoin Defendant from enforcing ยง 21-6313 and WPD Policy 527 in their \n \n40 DG, 594 F.3d at 1199โ1200 (further citation and quotations omitted). \n41 Id. at 1200 (further citation, quotations, and brackets omitted). \n42 Shook v. Bd. of Cnty. Commโs of Cnty. of El Paso, 543 F.3d 597, 604 (10th Cir. 2008) (citation and \nquotations omitted). \n43 Id. \n-16- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 212   Filed 10/10/23   Page 17 of 19\ncurrent forms.  This requested injunction is appropriate to the class as a whole because all class \nmembers are persons whose names appear on the Gang List.44  \n  Turning to first cohesiveness element, Plaintiffsโ requested injunction is specific and \ndescribes in reasonable detail what Plaintiffs seekโno more use of the Gang List or enforcement \nof ยง 21-6313.  As to cohesivenessโs second element, the alleged injuries of all the class membersโ\ni.e., injury to their freedom of association, freedom of expression, due process, reputation, etc.โ\nare sufficiently similar such that enjoining Defendant from using the Gang List would address \nthem all.  Returning to Rule 23(b)(2)โs โbottom line,โ enjoining Defendant from utilizing the Gang \nList is a conceivable injunction that satisfies Rule 65(a)โs specificity requirements and Rule \n23(b)(2)โs cohesiveness elements.  Accordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs meet their \nburden to show that class certification is warranted here.   \n  Plaintiffs demonstrate that their proposed class meets the requirements under both Rule \n23(a) and Rule 23(b)(2).  Thus, the Court grants Plaintiffsโ Motion for Class Certification. \nC.  The Court appoints Plaintiffsโ proposed counsel as class counsel. \n  Under Rule 23(g)(1), the Court must appoint class counsel whenever it certifies a class.  In \nso doing, the Court must consider: โ(i) the work counsel has done in identifying or investigating \npotential claims in the action; (ii) counselโs experience in handling class actions, other complex \n \n44 Although Plaintiffs list various proposed reforms in their Motion, those proposals do not appear as \nrequested relief in their Complaint.  Furthermore, these reforms would appear to be (1) requests for affirmative \ninjunctive relief, which bears a much higher standard and (2) at odds with the simple request in Plaintiffsโ Complaint \nthat the Court enjoin Defendant from maintaining the Gang List and declaring K.S.A. 21-6313 and WPD Policy 51 \nunconstitutional.  Therefore, the Court will only consider Plaintiffsโ proposed injunction as stated in their Complaint \nin ruling on this Motion. \n-17- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 212   Filed 10/10/23   Page 18 of 19\nlitigation, and the types of claims asserted in the action; (iii) counselโs knowledge of the applicable \nlaw; and (iv) the resources that counsel will commit to representing the class.โ45 \nPlaintiffs request that the Court appoint the following attorneys as class counsel: Jordan \nCarmichael Baehr, Mitchell F. Engel, Paul Monroe Vogel, and Thomas J. Sullivan of Shook, \nHardy & Bacon LLP; Karen Ellen Leve, Kunyu L. Ching, and Sharon Brett of the ACLU \nFoundation of Kansas; and Teresa A. Woody of Kansas Appleseed Center for Law and Justice, \nInc.  Defendant offers no objection to any of the proposed class counsel.  Still, the Court must \nanalyze the four factors under Rule 23(g) instead of simply relying on the partiesโ agreement in \nthis matter. \nRelevant to the first and fourth factors, Plaintiffsโ counsel has already invested significant \nresources in pursuing this litigation and identifying or investigating potential claims over the past \nthree years.  Likewise, the second factor favors appointing Plaintiffsโ counsel because the ACLU, \nKansas Appleseed, and Shook, Hardy, & Bacon all are well-known entities with significant \nexperience litigating civil rights claims as well as class actions.  Third, there is little doubt based \non counselโs wide experience and intelligent briefing in this case that they possess knowledge of \nthe applicable law for Plaintiffsโ claims.  Therefore, each of the factors favor appointing Plaintiffsโ \ncounsel as class counsel in this case.   \nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Plaintiffsโ Motion for Class Certification (Doc. \n175) is GRANTED.   \n \n45 Fed.

Organizational Plaintiff Progeny, along with individual \nPlaintiffs Christopher Cooper, Elbert Costello, Martel Costello and Jeremy Levy, Jr., bring this \nputative class action on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated. Collectively, Plaintiffs \nseek as relief a declaration that K.S.A. ยง 21-6313 is unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth \nAmendments  and  injunctive  relief  effectively  dismantling  the  Wichita  Police  Department \n(โWPDโ)โs Gang List.  The Gang List is purportedly a list of persons whom WPD personnel have \ndetermined meet the definition of a โcriminal street gang memberโ under the criteria set out in \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 234   Filed 01/30/24   Page 2 of 27\nK.S.A. ยง 21-6313(b).  The individual Plaintiffs contend they were wrongfully designated as \nโcriminal street gang member[s]โ and added to the Gang List, which has negatively affected their \nlives in a host of ways.  At this stage in the litigation, only four claims remain: Count I (due \nprocessโvagueness), Count III (procedural due process), Count VI (First Amendmentโdirect \nprohibition), and Count VII (First Amendmentโchilling effect). \n  For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that Progeny lacks standing for Count I and \nall Plaintiffs lack standing for Count VI.  However, genuine issues of material fact prevent \nsummary judgment in favor of either side on the remaining Counts.  Accordingly, the Court \ndismisses Count I as to Progeny and Count VI as to all Plaintiffs without prejudice and otherwise \ndenies the partiesโ Motions. \nI.  Factual and Procedural Background1 \nA.   The parties \n  The WPD is a department of the City of Wichita (โthe Cityโ) government and is responsible \nfor enacting the Cityโs policies.  It is the WPDโs Policy 527, and subsequent enactment into state \nlaw as K.S.A. ยง 21-6313, which comprises the subject of this lawsuit.   \n  The individual Plaintiffs and class representatives are Christopher Cooper, Elbert Costello, \nMartel Costello and Jeremy Levy, Jr., each of whom are listed on the WPDโs Gang List as active \ngang members.  All four testified in depositions and declarations that they are not and have never \nbeen gang members. \n \n1 The facts are those uncontroverted by the parties unless otherwise noted and are accepted as true for the \npurposes of this Order. \n-2- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 234   Filed 01/30/24   Page 3 of 27\nCooper was arrested in 2014 on the charge of first-degree murder after driving a shooter \naway from a party.  At that time, Cooper learned that he was an โactive gang memberโ on the Gang \nList.  The magistrate set his pre-trial bail at $50,000.  He was afterward convicted for obstruction \nof justice and sentenced to time in prison. \nMartel Costello (โMartelโ) first learned of his own gang designation in either 2017 or 2018 \nwhen he was arrested for possession of a firearm and marijuana in violation of his parole.  On two \nseparate occasions, Martel violated his parole while attending funeral services for a family member \nbecause family members also on the Gang List were in attendance.  \nElbert Costello (โElbertโ) was added to the Gang List in 1997.2  In 2011, Elbert plead guilty \nto possession of drug paraphernalia and received one year probation.  Because of his gang \ndesignation, Elbert incurred additional conditions of release while on probation.  Elbert repeatedly \nviolated those conditions, resulting in six months in jail and three additional yearsโ probation.  \nElbert believes that his association with family members, several of whom are also designated \ngang members or associates, led to his own gang designation.  He also believes that his presence \nat a funeral while wearing a red Phillies hat led to the WPD renewing his active status on the Gang \nList. \nLevy believes he was added to the Gang List at 13 years old when the WPD pulled over a \ncar driven by one of his cousins who was already on the Gang List.  Five years later, Levy was \ncharged and ultimately convicted of first-degree felony murder.  The magistrate assigned to Levyโs \ncase set his bail at $50,000.  Levy is currently serving his sentence. \n \n2 The reasons for the WPD doing so are not before this Court. \n-3- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 234   Filed 01/30/24   Page 4 of 27\nRounding out the named Plaintiffs, Progeny is a nonprofit organization in Wichita, Kansas, \nthat operates as a youth/adult partnership focused on reimagining the juvenile justice system and \nreinventing in community-based alternatives.  Progeny staff and members are on the Gang List, \nincluding  D.B.W.  (inactive  gang  member),  D.B.  (active  gang  member),  K.C.  (active  gang \nmember), and A.M. (active gang member). \nProgeny maintains that K.S.A. ยง 21-6313 and Policy 527 list strongly discourage it from \nhosting town halls or meetings of any kind, as they might result in Progeny staff or attendees being \nadded to the Gang List.  Progeny believes ยง 21-6313 and Policy 527 effectively prohibit it from \nproviding services to those individuals known to be on the Gang List, as doing so may result in \ngang designations for Progeny members working with those persons. \nB.  K.S.A. ยง 21-6313 et. seq.  \n  Plaintiffs challenge K.S.A. ยงยง 21-6313 through 21-63163 as unconstitutional.  Together, \nthese statutes define several terms relevant to criminal gangs, criminalize criminal street gang \nrecruitment and intimidation, and mandate a higher bond for any criminal street gang members.  \nUpon passage by the Kansas legislature, Governor Kathleen Sebelius signed the relevant statutes \ninto law on May 19, 2006. \nK.S.A. ยง 21-6313 functions as the definitional statute.  Under K.S.A. ยง 21-6313(a), a \nโcriminal street gangโ means any organization, association, or group, whether formal or informal:  \n(1) Consisting of three or more persons;  \n \n(2) having as one of its primary activities the commission of one or more person \nfelonies, person misdemeanors, felony violations of K.S.A. 21-5701 through 21-\n5717, and amendments thereto, any felony violation of any provision of the uniform \n \n3 Plaintiffs challenge K.S.A. ยงยง 21-6314 and 21-6315 without making any arguments specific to these \nstatutes.  Rather, Plaintiffs main concern stems from the use of ยง 21-6313โs definitions within those sections.  \nTherefore, the Court will not address them here. \n-4- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 234   Filed 01/30/24   Page 5 of 27\ncontrolled substances act prior to July 1, 2009, or the comparable juvenile offenses, \nwhich if committed by an adult would constitute the commission of such felonies \nor misdemeanors;  \n \n(3) which has a common name or common identifying sign or symbol; and  \n \n(4) whose members, individually or collectively, engage in or have engaged in the \ncommission, attempted commission, conspiracy to commit or solicitation of two or \nmore person felonies, person misdemeanors, felony violations of K.S.A. 21-5701 \nthrough 21-5717, and amendments thereto, any felony violation of any provision \nof the uniform controlled substances act prior to July 1, 2009, or the comparable \njuvenile offenses, which if committed by an adult would constitute the commission \nof such felonies or misdemeanors or any substantially similar offense from another \njurisdiction. \n \nThe  statute  also  defines  โcriminal  street  gang  memberโ  and  โcriminal  street  gang \nassociate.โ  Persons must meet three or two, respectively, of the following conditions or self-admit \ngang membership/association: \n(A) Is identified as a criminal street gang member by a parent or guardian; \n \n(B) is identified as a criminal street gang member by a state, county or city law \nenforcement officer or correctional officer or documented reliable informant; \n \n(C) is identified as a criminal street gang member by an informant of previously \nuntested  reliability  and  such  identification  is  corroborated  by  independent \ninformation; \n \n(D) frequents a particular criminal street gangโs area; \n \n(E) adopts such gangโs style of dress, color, use of hand signs or tattoos; \n \n(F) associates with known criminal street gang members; \n \n(G) has been arrested more than once in the company of identified criminal street \ngang members for offenses which are consistent with usual criminal street gang \nactivity; \n \n(H) is identified as a criminal street gang member by physical evidence including, \nbut not limited to, photographs or other documentation; \n \n(I) has been stopped in the company of known criminal street gang members two \nor more times; or \n-5- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 234   Filed 01/30/24   Page 6 of 27\n \n(J) has participated in or undergone activities self-identified or identified by a \nreliable informant as a criminal street gang initiation ritual.4 \n \n  Finally, K.S.A. ยง 21-6316 governs increased bail for criminal street gang members.  In full, \nit states: \nWhen a criminal street gang member is arrested for a person felony, bail shall be at \nleast $50,000 cash or surety, and such person shall not be released upon the personโs \nown recognizance pursuant to K.S.A. 22-2802, and amendments thereto, unless the \ncourt determines on the record that the defendant is not likely to reoffend, an \nappropriate intensive pre-trial supervision program is available and the defendant \nagrees to comply with the mandate of such pre-trial supervision.  \n \nC.  WPD Policy 527 \nPolicy 527 puts ยง 21-6313 into practice on the streets of Wichita.  In documenting gang \nmembers, the WPD maintains two separate but related databases: the Gang Database and the \nMaster Gang List.5  The Gang Database contains records of all active and inactive gang members \nand associates, whereas the Master Gang List consists solely of active gang members.   \nAny state, county, or city law enforcement officer or correctional officer may nominate an \nindividual for inclusion on the Master Gang List.  However, only Gang Intelligence Officers can \ndesignate a person as a gang member or associate after reviewing whether they meet criteria of \nยง 21-6313.  Likewise, only Gang Intelligence Officers can add, remove, activate, or inactivate a \nperson from the Gang List.  WPD officers monitor members of the Master Gang List for any \nviolations of probation conditions, bond, and pretrial restrictions.   \nOnce on the Master Gang List, Policy 527 provides that the individual will remain \ndesignated as โactiveโ for a minimum of three years, not including time served in custody.  If after \n \n4 Id. ยง 21-6313(b)(2)(A)โ(J). \n5 When referring to these lists together, the Court simply uses โthe Gang List.โ \n-6- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 234   Filed 01/30/24   Page 7 of 27\nthree years the individual has not met any of the criteria under ยง 21-6316(b), they will be marked \ninactive with their names removed from the Master Gang List.  However, their entries remain \nvisible in the Gang Database, which is only accessible by Gang Intelligence Officers.  Policy 527 \ndoes not provide an opportunity for an individual to remove their name the Gang Database entirely.  \nIn fact, WPD has removed a personโs name from the Gang List only once.  On that occasion, the \nWPD instructed a juvenile with an inactive gang member status to โhave good grades in schoolโ \nand โdo well at homeโ for a certain time.  After several months of apparent success, Chief Gordon \nRamsay directed that the juvenile be removed from the Gang List. \nPolicy 527 further specifies that the Master Gang List is confidential and will only be \nreleased to commissioned law enforcement, correctional officers, and those authorized to receive \nMaster Gang List information by various high-level supervisors within the WPD.  In contrast, the \nGang Database has not been shared with any other agency since 2009 and is not accessible through \nany of the shared criminal databases WPD utilizes, such as EJustice, SPIDER, or NICHE.  \nPractically speaking, only the Master Gang List plugs into the WPDโs EJustice system, a criminal \ndatabase accessible by multiple law enforcement agencies.  Thus, information within the Master \nGang List is available to other law enforcement agencies.  The WPD also shares the Master Gang \nList with the prosecutorโs office.  Furthermore, Policy 527 requires WPD officers to identify, in \nan arrest affidavit for a person felony, whether a person is documented on the Gang Database as a \ngang member or gang associate.   \nIn addition to the official intragovernmental sharing of the Master Gang List, former WPD \nCaptain Wendell Nicholson also shared information from the Gang Database with the public at \nleast 22 times.  When this unauthorized dissemination was discovered, Nicholson lost his job, \nfaced criminal charges, and ultimately received diversion.   \n-7- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 234   Filed 01/30/24   Page 8 of 27\nThe WPD does not notify adults of their placement on the Master Gang List.  However, \nWPD policy requires supervisors from the Gang Unit to attempt to contact the parent or guardian \nof any juvenile placed on the Master Gang List.  If contact is successful, the supervisor will inform \nthe parent or guardian how the juvenile met the gang criteria and advise them of intervention \noptions and resources.  The WPDโs successful notification rate is roughly 50%. \nAs of May 2022, at least 5,507 individuals had entries in the Gang Database. Of these, \n1,725 are documented as active gang members, 3,293 are documented as inactive gang members, \n221 are listed as gang associates, and 261 are documented as deceased. \nD.  Contested facts \nPlaintiffs contend that the WPD disseminates information contained in the Master Gang \nList and Gang Database to the public.  First, they claim a printed copy of entries identifying all \nindividuals on the Gang List was once disclosed publicly after being left on the trunk of a WPD \nsquad car. They next point to a complainant in 2011 who informed the WPD that her two sonsโ \nnames and address listed in a โGang Activity Informational Bulletinโ distributed at a liquor store.  \nOpposed to this characterization of the facts, Defendants staunchly assert that the public does not \nhave access to either the Master Gang List or the Gang Database.  In support, Defendant points to \nevidence  that  two  of  the  three  instances  of  leaked  Gang  List  information  originated  from \nunauthorized sources outside WPD.  The third instance, unauthorized disclosure by Captain \nNicholson, resulted in criminal charges.   \nSeveral of the individual Plaintiffs complain that they lost jobs or scholarships because of \nthe  background  checks  which  purportedly  revealed  their  gang  designations.    In  contrast, \nDefendants challenge Plaintiffsโ claimed harms as subjective and without basis in the record.  For \n-8- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 234   Filed 01/30/24   Page 9 of 27\ninstance, Defendant points to the lack of evidenceโbesides Plaintiffsโ own testimonyโshowing \nthat they have lost any jobs or scholarships because of their gang designations.   \nThe parties also disagree over the criteria the WPD employs to add or renew a person as \nan active gang member or associate.  For example, Plaintiffs claim that persons have had their \nactive gang member status renewed for as little as wearing a red Phillies hat.  In contrast, \nDefendants offer evidence from WPD personnel that the more broadly applicable criteria are \napplied in contextโi.e., wearing a red Phillies hat while flashing known gang signs or doing so in \na video with other designated gang members.   \nPlaintiffs further claim that they have been either placed or renewed on the Gang List solely \nfor interacting with family members at funerals, concerts, or other locations.  For instance, on two \nseparate occasions, Martel violated his parole by attending funeral services because family \nmembers on the Gang List also attended.  Because of this and similar events, Plaintiffs claim that \nthey must shun family members and friends who may be on the Gang List, in order to avoid \nmeeting K.S.A. ยง 21-6313(b)(2)(F). \nProgeny likewise claims that it has also suffered associational harms.  For example, \nProgeny cancelled a planned protest after the WPD contacted Progeny.6  Furthermore, Progeny \nclaims it suffered associational harms from police presence outside one of its meetings.  Progenyโs \nfounder and Rule 30(b)(6) witness, Atkins, submitted a declaration stating that Progenyโs members \nand staff consistently fear placement on the Gang List due to the possible attendance of those \nalready having gang designations.  This fear then, according to Atkins, discourages Progeny from \n \n6 Further detail regarding the WPDโs โcontactโ with Progeny is not before this Court. \n-9- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 234   Filed 01/30/24   Page 10 of 27\nholding in person meetings of any kind.  Defendants, however, challenge Atkinsโ testimony and \nthe true reasons for Progeny canceling the protest. \nWhile acknowledging that applying K.S.A. ยง 21-6313(b)โs criteria leaves room from \nindividual discretion, Defendants rely on evidence showing that officers generally adhere to the \nsame general unspoken policies.  For instance, Defendant offers testimony from officers showing \nthat the WPD does not consider association with family members, even those designated as active \ngang members, relevant under K.S.A. ยง 21-6313(b)(2)(F).  Furthermore, Defendant point to \nevidence showing that other considerations besides interaction with family played a role in each \nof Plaintiffsโ active gang member status renewal.  \nE.  Procedural history \nPlaintiffs initiated this lawsuit on April 15, 2021, naming the City of Wichita, Gordon \nRamsay, and Chad Beard as Defendants and alleging seven counts for various constitutional \nviolations.  On January 10, 2022, the Court issued its order granting in part and denying in part \nthen-Defendantsโ motion to dismiss.7  The Court dismissed Ramsay and Beard from the case, as \nwell as Counts II, IV, and V.  What remained were Count I (due processโvagueness), Count III \n(procedural due process), Count VI (First Amendmentโdirect prohibition), and Count VII (First \nAmendmentโchilling effect) asserted against the City. \nOn October 10, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiffsโ motion for class certification under \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2).  The present class definition covers โall living persons \nincluded in the Wichita Police Departmentโs Gang List or Gang Database as an Active or Inactive \nGang Member or Gang Associate.โ   \n \n7 Progeny v.

Defendantโs focuses its \narguments on Plaintiffโs perceived lack of standing.  In contrast, Plaintiffs contend that they not \nonly have standing but are entitled to summary judgment on the merits for each of their claims.  \nAs these Motions have been fully (and voluminously) briefed, they are now ripe for adjudication \nby this Court. \nII.  Legal Standard \n  Summary judgment is appropriate if the moving party demonstrates that there is no genuine \nissue as to any material fact, and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.8  A fact is \nโmaterialโ when it is essential to the claim, and issues of fact are โgenuineโ if the proffered \nevidence permits a reasonable jury to decide the issue in either partyโs favor.9  The movant bears \nthe initial burden of proof and must show the lack of evidence on an essential element of the \nclaim.10  The nonmovant must then bring forth specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial.11  \nThese facts must be clearly identified through affidavits, deposition transcripts, or incorporated \nexhibitsโconclusory allegations alone cannot survive a motion for summary judgment.12  The \ncourt views all evidence and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving \nparty.13 \n \n8 Fed.

Standing \nBefore  addressing  the  substantive  issues  of  the  case,  the  Court  must  ensure  it  has \njurisdiction to adjudicate Plaintiffsโ claims.  Defendant challenges the Courtโs jurisdiction based \non standing.  It argues the evidence fails to show any Plaintiff: (1) suffered an injury in fact; (2) \nthat is fairly traceable to the WPDโs Policy 527 and maintenance of the Gang Database and Master \nGang List; and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision. \n  โFederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction; they are empowered to hear only those \ncases authorized and defined in the Constitution which have been entrusted to them under a \njurisdictional grant by Congress.โ14  โArticle III of the United States Constitution restricts the \njurisdiction of federal courts to the adjudication of โCasesโ or โControversies.โโ15  โTo satisfy \nArticle  IIIโs  case-or-controversy  requirement,  a  plaintiff  must  demonstrate  standing  by \nestablishing (1) an injury-in-fact, (2) a sufficient causal connection between the injury and the \nconduct complained of, and (3) a likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable \ndecision.โ16 \nโTo establish injury in fact, a plaintiff must show that he or she suffered โan invasion of a \nlegally protected interestโ that is โconcrete and particularizedโ and โactual or imminent, not \nconjectural or hypothetical.โโ17  โAlthough โimminenceโ is concededly a somewhat elastic concept, \nit cannot be stretched beyond its purpose, which is to ensure that the alleged injury is not too \n \n14 Henry v.

Due process claims \n  The individual Plaintiffs assert two separate Fourteenth Amendment Due Process claims \nthrough 28 U.S.C. ยง 1983: vagueness (Count I) and procedural due process (Count III).  Progeny \njoins in only Count I.  The standing inquiry for both claims is identical because Plaintiffs assert \nthe same injury for eachโspecifically, reputational damage due to being designated โgang \nmembers.โ  \nDamage to oneโs reputation may implicate โa protectible liberty interest . . . that requires \nprocedural due process in the form of a hearing to clear his name.โ29  However, โstigmatization or \nreputational damage alone, no matter how egregious, is not sufficient to support a ยง 1983 cause of \naction.โ30  This is because โreputation alone, apart from some more tangible interests such as \nemployment, is [n]either โlibertyโ or โpropertyโ by itself sufficient to invoke the procedural \nprotection of the Due Process Clause.โ31 \nInstead,  a  plaintiff  must  meet  what  courts  commonly  describe  as  the  โstigma  plusโ \nstandard.32   The stigma plus standard contains two distinct elements: โ(1) the government made a \nfalse statement about the plaintiff that was sufficiently derogatory to injure his reputation, and that \n \n28 The Court has already held that based on the types of Progeny has organizational standing to bring   \n29 Gwinn v.

First, there is \nthe disputed fact of whether the WPD wrongfully designated Plaintiffs as gang members.  Plaintiffs \nclaim complete innocenceโDefendant disagrees.  This is an issue best left for trial where the Court \nmay make credibility determinations and consider the weight of evidence.   \nFurthermore, whether the โpublicโ has access to the Gang List is a genuine issue of fact at \nthis point.  Plaintiffs cite evidence showing at least two public disclosures of the Gang List.  \nDefendants counter by stating that one of the leaks by former Captain Nicholson resulted in \ncriminal charges and the other came via non-WPD personnel.  However, the fact remains that the \npublic at large was informed of gang designations. \n  Regardless, the Master Gang List is accessible by various other law enforcement agencies, \nincluding the Kansas Department of Corrections.  The WPD also provides a suspectโs gang \ndesignation in an arrest warrant, which is provided to the magistrate, the prosecutors, and the \ndefendantโs attorney.  As noted by this Court in its previous order, the consensus among courts \nappears to be that intra-governmental disclosures of an individualโs gang-member designation are \nsufficiently public to damage oneโs reputation.41  Defendants have not pointed to a single case \nwhere the court expressly required publication to laypeople, the typical โpublic.โ  Thus, the Court \n \n41 See Pedrote-Salinas v. Johnson, 2018 WL 2320934, at *5 (N.D. Ill. 2018) (citing Larry v. Lawler, 605 \nF.3d 954, 958 (7th Cir. 1978) and Castillo v. County of Los Angeles, 959 F. Supp. 2d 1255, 1261โ62 (C.D. Cal. 2013)); \nMedrano v. Salazar, 2020 WL 589537, at *6 n.3 (W.D. Tex. 2020) (โA stigmatizing label can be sufficiently public \neven when the government shares it only with other governmental entities and agencies on a โneed to knowโ basis.โ) \n(citations omitted); Bank of Jackson Cnty. v. Cherry, 980 F.2d 1362, 1367โ68 (11th Cir. 1993) (โAs in Bishop and \nSutton, where the courts found no deprivation of liberty, appellees did not disclose any negative information about \nBJC to the public. And, although appellees discussed BJCโs case with government lawyers, they did not communicate \nthe allegations of BJCโs misconduct to any other government agency.โ). \n-16- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 234   Filed 01/30/24   Page 17 of 27\nconcludes that Plaintiffs show a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Defendant published \na derogatory statement by including them on the Gang List.42 \n  This initial showing, however, is not enough to establish standing.  Plaintiffs must also \ndemonstrate that they have suffered a significant material change in their legal status because of \ntheir inclusion on the Gang List.  Only one injury is necessary to establish standing for Plaintiffsโ \ndue process claims.   \nHere, K.S.A. ยง 21-6316 imposes a minimum bond of $50,000 for criminal street gang \nmembers.  The Court is unwilling at this stage in the litigation to hold that an altered minimum \nbail amount is insufficient as a matter of law to constitute a significant altered legal status.  \nAccordingly, the individual Plaintiffs have adequately established a genuine issue of material fact \nas  to  whether  they  suffer  an  injury-in-fact  traceable  to  their  placement  on  the  Gang  List.  \nFurthermore, that injury is fully redressable should they receive a favorable decision from this \nCourt.  Therefore, the Court finds that for the purposes of this Order, Plaintiffs have standing to \nassert their due process claims against Defendant.   \nThe same cannot be said for Progeny.  An association has standing bring suit on behalf of \nits members when โ(a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) \nthe interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization's purpose; and (c) neither the claim \nasserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.โ43  \nThe third element becomes a matter of individualized proof.44   \n \n42 Notably, those solely in the Gang Database do not suffer this harm, as that information is only accessible \nto WPD personnel via a name search.   \n43 Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Advert. Commโn, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977). \n44 Id. at 344. \n-17- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 234   Filed 01/30/24   Page 18 of 27\nAs previously discussed by the Court, Progeny can meet the first two elements quite \neasily.45  But any stigma-plus standing analysis necessarily involves individualized proof of any \ninjury-in-fact.  Indeed, the Court already dismissed Plaintiffsโ Count IIโviolation of due process \nbrought by Progeny on behalf of its membersโon the basis of standing.46  Progenyโs lacks \nstanding on Count I for the exact same reason.  Therefore, the Court dismisses without prejudice \nCount I as brought by Progeny for lack of standing.  \n2.  First Amendment \nPlaintiffs also assert two First Amendment claims, each containing two distinct parts.  In \nCount VI, Plaintiffs assert that K.S.A. ยง 21-6316 and Policy 527 directly prohibit them from \nexercising their rights to freedom of expression and freedom of association.  And in Count VII, \nPlaintiffs claim that K.S.A. ยง 21-6316 and Policy 527 impermissibly chill the same.   \na.  Freedom of expression through symbolic conduct \nBefore reaching the individual Counts, the Court must address Plaintiffsโ freedom of \nexpression claim so far as it relies on symbolic speech.  In its prior order, the Court concluded that \nโthis issue, though framed under the First Amendment, is actually a different species of the \nprocedural due process claim.โ47  There, the Court realized it \nmust address a threshold issue in First Amendment cases involving expressive \nconduct or โsymbolic speech,โ rather than written or verbal expression.  Namely, \ndoes the plaintiffโs conduct actually constitute protected speech under the First \nAmendment?  A necessary element to transform conduct into protected speech is \nthat the plaintiff had the โintent to convey a particularized message.โ  It is in \naddressing this element that the Court concludes this issue, though framed under \n \n45 See Progeny, 2022 WL 93406, at *9. \n46 Id. (โProgeny does not have associational standing for those claims that require individualized proof. \nBecause in Count II, Progeny relies entirely on associational standing to bring its procedural due process claim on \nbehalf of its members, and that claim will require individualized proof, that Count is dismissed.โ). \n47 Id. at *17. \n-18- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 234   Filed 01/30/24   Page 19 of 27\nthe First Amendment, is actually a different species of the procedural due process \nclaim discussed above. \n \nIn theory, there are two possible messages Elbert [Costello] could have been \nintending to convey by wearing his Phillies hat. He could have been trying to \ncommunicate โI like the Philadelphia Phillies and think they are an excellent \nbaseball team.โ  And if this is the case, Defendantsโ decision to renew his Gang List \ndesignation  on  this  basis  was  not  a  punishment  based  on  his  communicated \nmessage.  There is no allegation that Defendants intend to place persons on the \nGang List simply because they are Phillies fans.  Rather, if this was Elbertโs \nmessage in wearing the Phillies cap, Defendants made a mistake about his message, \nand Elbertโs grievance centers around the lack of opportunity to challenge the \ngrounds underlying the renewal of his designation as a gang member.  This, of \ncourse, is a feature of procedural due process. \n \nThe second possible message Elbert may have been trying to convey by wearing \nthe hat is โI am a gang member.โ  This is certainly the message Defendants \nunderstood Elbert to convey. But this is foreclosed by Elbertโs own statements, \naccepted as true at this stage, that he is not, and has never been, a gang member.  \nAccordingly, this cause of action, though brought under the First Amendment, is \nmerely a facet of Plaintiffsโ procedural due process claim.48 \n \nAlthough Plaintiffs reasserted their freedom of expression claims in the Pretrial Order, the \nCourtโs characterization of those claims remains the same.  To the extent Plaintiffsโ claim rely on \nsymbolic speech, they are nothing more than a facet of Plaintiffsโ procedural due process claims.  \nThroughout this litigation, Plaintiffs have consistently maintained that they are not gang members.  \nAnd yet, to prevail on any standalone freedom of expression claim regarding symbolic speech, \nPlaintiffs must argue that they intended to communicate gang affiliation through their expressive \nconduct.  Obviously, that could not be further from Plaintiffsโ position.  Therefore, the Court once \nagain concludes that any freedom of expression claim based on symbolic speech really is just a \nprocedural due process claim repackaged.  Accordingly, the Court need not address whether \nPlaintiffs have standing to assert this claim. \n \n48 Id. (citations omitted). \n-19- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 234   Filed 01/30/24   Page 20 of 27\nb.  Count VIโdirect prohibition \nPlaintiffs argue that their First Amendment expressive conduct claims are not limited solely \nto symbolic speech.  Rather, they claim โthe WPDโs enforcement of K.S.A. 21-6313 through \nPolicy 527 targets and punishes written expression in the form of tattoos and social media posts \nand through pretrial, probation, or parole gang conditions of release in a content-discriminatory \nmanner.โ   \nA problem arises under Plaintiffsโ theory of the case because K.S.A. ยง 21-6313 and Policy \n527 do not prohibit anything.  Therefore, Plaintiffs face no real threat of prosecution from engaging \nin any speech or association.  Plaintiffs admit as much, instead framing the alleged โprohibitionโ \nas stemming from the โharmsโ inflicted on designated gang members and associates.  Plaintiffs \nfail to cite any caselaw where the court found a statute to directly prohibit speech despite lacking \nany threat of prosecution, i.e., an unenforceable definitional statute such as K.S.A. ยง 21-6313.  \nRather, those facts form the classic example of a โchilling effectโ scenario where some indirect \nthreat of harm prevents plaintiffs from engaging in speech not directly prohibited.49  From the \nbrunt of Plaintiffsโ arguments, it seems clear that their direct prohibition claim really is just another \nfacet of their First Amendment chilling effect claim. \nThe same logic holds true for Plaintiffsโ argument regarding โgang conditions of release,โ \nby which they refer any manner of release conditions, whether pretrial, supervised release, \n \n49 Plaintiffs briefly note that a โcriminal street gang member or criminal street gang associateโ as defined by \nK.S.A. ยง 21-6313โs is a โcovered personโ under the Kansas RICO Act, ยง 21-6313.  This, they argue, effectively \nprohibits and punishes any speech used by the WPD to designate someone as a gang member or associate.  Plaintiffsโ \nreasoning goes a step too far.  The Kansas RICO statute, K.S.A. ยง 21-6329, makes clear that simply being a โcovered \npersonโ is insufficient to constitute a crime or incur punishment.  A covered person only incurs criminal liability upon \nmeeting the other elements under ยง 21-6329(a).  Thus, Plaintiffs cannot show that K.S.A. ยง 21-6313 directly prohibits \nspeech.   \n-20- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 234   Filed 01/30/24   Page 21 of 27\nprobation, parole, etc.  Such release conditionsโwhich may limit speech by restricting tattoos \ncontaining text, certain social media posts, association with other designated gang members, etc.โ\nremain within the sole discretion of the courts, the secretary of corrections, and prisoner review \nboards who impose them.  No party responsible for imposing any gang conditions of release is \nbefore this Court.  Of course, the gang release conditionsโ โharmsโ may constitute consequences \ncapable of chilling a personโs exercise of First Amendment privileges.  However, the Court cannot \nreasonably hold that K.S.A. ยง 21-6313 and Policy 527 directly prohibit First Amendment activities \nthrough Plaintiffsโ gang release conditions. \nRegardless,  Plaintiffs  lack  standing  to  assert  any  claim  against  Defendant  for  gang \nconditions of release imposed by other parties.  This is because such a claim fails the third element \nof standingโredressability.  Even if the Court were to find K.S.A. ยง 21-6313 and Policy 527 \nunconstitutional, that would not prevent courts or other parties from imposing the very gang \nconditions of release of which Plaintiffs now complain.  Furthermore, Plaintiffsโ requested relief \ndoes not include prohibiting the WPD from having input in those partiesโ decisions regarding \nconditions of release.    Without showing redressability, Plaintiffs lack standing to assert any claim \nagainst Defendant that K.S.A. ยง 21-6313 and Policy 527 directly prohibit any speech or associative \nrights through the gang conditions.  And, as discussed above, Plaintiffs do not truly allege any \nother colorable basis for their direct prohibition claim.  Accordingly, the Court dismisses Plaintiffsโ \nCount VI without prejudice for lack of standing. \n \n-21- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 234   Filed 01/30/24   Page 22 of 27\nc.  Count VIIโchilling effect50 \nPlaintiffsโ Count VII asserts a First Amendment chilling effect claim for both freedom of \nexpression and association.  As no doubt predicted by the reader at this point, Defendant argues \nthat Plaintiffs lack standing to assert this claim.   \nFirst Amendment claims based on perceived chilling effects necessarily present an inherent \ndifficulty in showing injury-in-fact โbecause such injuries are, by definition, inchoate: the speech \nhas not yet occurred and might never occur, yet the government may have taken no formal \nenforcement action.โ51  Therefore, โan injury-in-fact exists where a chilling effect arises from an \nobjectively justified fear of real consequences, which can be satisfied by showing a credible threat \nof prosecution or other consequences following from the statuteโs enforcement.โ52  In contrast, \nโ[a]llegations of a subjective โchillโ are not an adequate substitute for a claim of specific present \nobjective harm or a threat of specific future harm.โ53 \nOnce again, only one injury is necessary.  Here, the Court concludes that there is a genuine \nissue of material fact as to whether an increased presumptive bail amount constitutes โother \nconsequencesโ sufficient to create a cognizable injury in fact.  Therefore, the individual Plaintiffs \nhave standing to assert their First Amendment chilling effect claim. \nLikewise, Progeny also submits evidence creating a genuine issue of material fact as to \nwhether it has standing to bring its First Amendment chilled speech and association claims.  \n \n50   As per the Pretrial Order, Progeny only joins in Count VIโnot Count VII.  However, since the Court \nconstrues Count VI as simply restating a First Amendment chilling effect claim, it seems clear that Progeny intends \nto assert such a claim.  Thus, the Court concludes Progeny joins in Count VII. \n51 Rio Grande Found., 57 F.4th at 1160 (further citation and quotations omitted). \n52 Id. (cleaned up). \n53 Citizen Ctr. v.

Whether they rise to the level \nof a concrete injury or merely subjective fear is a factual issue for which evidence on both sides \nexists.  At this stage, the Court must conclude that Progeny has created a genuine issue of material \nfact as to whether it has suffered an injury-in-fact.   \nFurthermore, Plaintiffs submit evidence that this injury is fairly traceable to Defendantโs \nconduct in creating and maintaining the Gang List and may be redressed by favorable injunctive \nrelief dismantling the Gang List.  The Court concludes for the purposes of this Order that genuine \nissues of material fact preclude summary judgment on the basis of standing.  Therefore, the Court \ndenies Defendantโs Motion on this ground. \nB.  Merits \nHaving concluded that genuine issues of material fact regarding Plaintiffsโ standing remain \non Counts I, III, and VII, the Court must now examine the partiesโ competing arguments as to why \nthey deserve summary judgment on the merits.  However, genuine issues of material fact as to \neach claim once again demonstrate that this case is one best left for trial.   \n1.  Count Iโvagueness \nA basic feature of Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment is that a law must clearly \ndefine what it prohibits, or otherwise be held โvoid for vagueness.โ54  โWhere a law deals with \nareas of First Amendment import, there is the additional concern that the uncertain terms will \ninhibit those First Amendment freedoms, as โcitizens will steer far wider of the unlawful zone than \n \n54 Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108 (1972). \n-23- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 234   Filed 01/30/24   Page 24 of 27\nif the boundaries of the forbidden areas were clearly marked.โโ55  Thus, stricter standards apply \nwhen vagueness concerns overlap with First Amendment protections.56   \nA statute is unconstitutionally vague in two circumstances: (1) โit fails to provide people \nof ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits,โ or (2) \nโit authorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.โ57  Void for vagueness \nchallenges come in two species.  First, a plaintiff may challenge the statute as vague as applied to \nhis particular circumstances.58  The analysis of an as-applied claim is tethered to the factual context \nin which the statute was applied to the plaintiff.59  Second, a plaintiff may allege that a statute is \nfacially vague.60  Finding a statute facially vague is โstrong medicine,โ and requires a plaintiff to \nshow that โthe challenged law would be vague in the vast majority of its applications.โ61   \nPlaintiffsโ claims as set forth in the Pretrial Order do not specify whether they challenge \nK.S.A. ยง 21-6313 facially or as applied.  Their briefing, however, indicates that they seek to \nchallenge it on both grounds.   \na.  Facial challenge \nPlaintiffsโ vagueness challenge implicates First Amendment concerns because K.S.A. \nยง 21-6313 allows WPD officers to consider potential gang membersโ speech and associates.  \nโ[T]he overbreadth doctrine permits the facial invalidation of laws that inhibit the exercise of First \n \n55 Dr. Johnโs, Inc. v.

Because these genuine issues of material \nfact remain, the Court denies the partiesโ Motions on this claim. \nb.  As-applied challenge. \nโAs-applied  vagueness  challenges  involve  a  factual  dimension  in  that  vagueness  is \ndetermined in light of the facts of the case at hand.โ65  Plaintiffs contend that, as applied to them, \nK.S.A. ยง 21-6313โs provisions are vague and arbitrarily enforced by the WPD.  This, however, is \nwhere the partiesโ controverted facts differ wildly.

Accordingly, the Court denies both partiesโ \nMotions as to Count I. \n2.  Count IIIโprocedural due process \nHere, the analysis for Plaintiffsโ procedural due process claim comports exactly with the \nabove standing analysis.  After all, a key issue for both standing and Plaintiffsโ procedural due \nprocess on the merits is whether Plaintiffs have alleged the deprivation of a liberty interest in their \nreputations.  Genuine issues of material fact remaining in this analysis include; (1) whether the \nWPDโs designation of Plaintiffs as โgang membersโ was false; (2) whether Plaintiffs suffered an \nalteration of a significant legal status; and (3) whether any process exists at all for challenging \nPlaintiffsโ  gang  designations.    Because  the  facts  key  to  answering  these  questions  remain \ncontroverted, the Court concludes that summary judgment is inappropriate.  Accordingly, both \npartiesโ Motions are denied as to this claim.   \n3.  Count VIIโFirst Amendment chilled speech and association \nAs noted above, Plaintiffsโ First Amendment claim relies on the chilling effect of K.S.A. \nยง 21-6313 and Policy 527.  Fundamentally, the core factual issue over which the parties disagree \nis whether Plaintiffsโ fear is merely subjective or amounts to an objectively justified fear of real \nconsequences.  The proper course of action is to allow the parties to contest the issue at trial, after \nwhich the Court may make findings of fact necessary to reach a conclusion on this issue.  For now, \ngenuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment.  Accordingly, the Court denies both \npartiesโ Motions on Plaintiffsโ First Amendment chilling effect claims. \nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Count I as to Progeny and Count VI as to all \nPlaintiffs are DISMISSED without prejudice for lack of standing. \n-26- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM   Document 234   Filed 01/30/24   Page 27 of 27\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendantsโ Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. \n205) is DENIED.   \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Plaintiffsโ Motion for Summary Judge (Doc. 206) is \nDENIED.   \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nDated this 30th day of January, 2024. \n \n \n           \n          ERIC F.

The WPDโs1 practices and policies surrounding its Gang List disproportionately \ntarget and harm individuals and communities of color and violate the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution. \n3.  The WPD maintains the Gang List pursuant to K.S.A. 21-6313 and WPD Policy \n527, a true and correct copy of which is incorporated as Exhibit A.  \n4.  Police officers within the WPDโs Gang Unit routinely exercise unilateral and \nvirtually unchecked power to designate individual Wichita residents as โgang membersโ or โgang \nassociatesโ based on scant and unreliable evidence, or, indeed, no evidence at all. K.S.A. 21-6313 \nand WPD Policy 527 do not require that a person be convicted of a crime, charged with a crime, \nor even suspected of being involved in criminal activity in order to be designated as a gang member \nor gang associate. The WPD continuously tracks the individuals it designates as gang members or \nassociates, and even tracks constitutionally protected activity.  \n5.  Adult individuals placed on the Gang List are provided no notice of their inclusion \non the list, or what prompted that inclusion, nor do they have the opportunity to challenge such \ndesignation either under the terms of the statute or as it is applied in practice. Because there are no \n                                                 \n1 The City of Wichita acts, with respect to its use and maintenance of the Gang List, through its governmental sub-\nunit the WPD, and the WPDโs divisions and units; thus, Plaintiffsโ references to the WPD or its Gang Unit \nencompass allegations against the City. \n2 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 3 of 62\nprovisions within the WPD policies to remove anyone from the Gang List, those listed remain \nbranded as gang members or associates for life, even if they never come into contact with the \ncriminal justice system.  \n6.  Inclusion on the Gang List subjects an individual to a wide range of severe civil \nand criminal consequences, including enhanced bail and probation and parole terms, limited plea \nopportunities,  extreme  prejudice  at  criminal  trials,  widespread  reputational  harm,  denial  of \nassociative and assembly rights, and discrimination in housing, licensing, and employment.  \n7.   The Gang List is discriminatory in that it targets primarily Black and Brown \nindividuals: the overwhelming majority of those listed are Black or Latinx, despite those groups \nrepresenting only a small minority of the greater Wichita community. The racial disparities in the \nmakeup of the Gang List, and the geographic concentration of those listed, demonstrate that the \nWPD is explicitly targeting minority communities for its gang enforcement work, in violation of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment. For instance, Black residents make up only 10.9% of Wichitaโs \npopulation, but comprise 60% of Wichitaโs Gang List. Latinx individuals account for only 17.2% \nof Wichitaโs population, but make up 25% of the Gang List. In contrast, White residents make up \n62.8% of Wichitaโs population, but account for only 6% of the Gang List.2  \n8.  Upon information and belief, WPD officers include on the Gang List a small \nnumber of certain โbiker groupsโ and โwhite supremacistsโ comprised mainly of white individuals, \nbut do not make the same efforts to surveil those individuals, nor to categorize the individuals they \nassociate with as gang members or gang associates. While all of those listed on the Gang List are \n                                                 \n2 See U.S. Census Bureau, QuickFacts: Wichita city, Kansas, https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/wichitacitykansas \n(accessed Apr. 5, 2021); Gregg W. Etter Sr. & Warren G. Swymeler, Examining the Demographics of Street Gangs \nin Wichita, Kansas, 16 Journal of Gang Research, at 7-8 (2008). \n3 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 4 of 62\nharmed by the lack of procedural and substantive due process, the statute and the WPD policies \nare used to disproportionately target racial minorities. \n9.  These staggering racial disparities are the product of unconstitutionally vague and \nprocedurally deficient policies codified in K.S.A. 21-6313 and implemented in WPD Policy 527.  \n10.  K.S.A. 21-6313 is unconstitutionally vague. K.S.A. 21-6313 sets out ten criteria for \nlaw enforcement to consider when determining whether an individual may be designated as a street \ngang member or associate under Kansas law. A person need only meet three of these ten criteria \nto be considered a criminal street gang โmemberโ under the statute. K.S.A. 21-6313(b)(2). Even \nworse, a person need only fulfill two of the ten criteria to qualify as a criminal street gang \nโassociateโ under the statute. K.S.A. 21-6313(d)(2). There is no meaningful distinction between \nthe label of member or associateโthe consequences that flow from either designation are the same. \nThe criteria to qualify as a gang member or associate are vague and broad, and encompass a wide \nrange of innocuous, innocent, and constitutionally protected behavior. The criteria include:  \n๏ง  Frequenting a particular criminal street gangโs area \n๏ง  Wearing a criminal street gangโs color \n๏ง  Associating with criminal street gang members \n๏ง  Being identified as a criminal street gang member by a law enforcement officer \n๏ง  Being identified as a criminal street gang member by โphotographs or other \ndocumentationโ and \n๏ง  Being  identified  as  a  criminal  street  gang  member  by  any  informant  โof \npreviously untested reliabilityโ where โsuch identification is corroborated by \nindependent information.โ \n \n11.  The WPDโs Policy 527 is a direct result of the unchecked and far-reaching authority \nthat K.S.A. 21-6313 grants to Kansas police departments. Under Policy 527, an individual may be \nnominated as a gang member or associate by any state, county, or city law enforcement or \ncorrectional officer and โwill be added to the Gang List if they meet the criteria defined in K.S.A. \n4 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 5 of 62\n21-6313.โ The statute provides no opportunity to challenge that nomination, no due process, and \nno process for removal from a Gang List. \n12.  K.S.A. 21-6313 does not define or limit what a police department can define as a \ngangโs โareaโ or โcolor,โ contains no parameters or exceptions regarding associating with gang \nmembers (e.g., for family, co-workers, classmates, etc.), and does not establish any standards or \ngrounds for identification of gang members by law enforcement or others, or for corroborating \nsuch identification.  \n13.  Under the statute, a person may be designated as a gang member or associate based \non tenuous connections or even a single contact with others so designated. A person may engage \nin behaviors or contacts meeting these criteria without knowing or having any way to avoid such \nconduct. The criteria of K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527 are so vague and expansive that the \nmajority of Wichita citizens, including most judges, lawyers, clergy, union members, and other \nprofessional and social service providers, could be discretionally designated as a gang member or \nassociate and added to the Gang List. Indeed, under the statute and policy, most WPD officers \nthemselves qualify as gang members. The criteria could encompass entire schools, neighborhoods, \nand communities where the WPD claim gang presence, thereby implicating anyone who lives or \nlearns there. Both the statute and policy are also written in such a way that anyone in Wichita \nwearing a gang โcolorโโsuch as red (Bloods), orange (Hoover Criminals), yellow (Latin Kings), \ngreen (Trinitarios), blue (Crips), or purple (Los Solidos)โalso meets half the criteria for being a \ngang associate. Thus, for a child attending a school in a โgang area,โ going to class in any one of \nthese colors permits a Wichita police officer to add that child to the Gang List without ever \nspeaking to the child.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 6 of 62\n14.  K.S.A. 21-6313 also offers police offices a single-criterion, fast-track loophole to \nadd an individual to the Gang List if that individual has โself-identifiedโ as a gang member or \nassociate. K.S.A. 21-6313(b)(1); K.S.A. 21-6313(d)(1). There is no requirement to corroborate \nsuch self-identification. Thus, K.S.A. 21-6313 effectively vests plenary authority to designate and \nbrand  โgang  membersโ  under  Kansas  law  in  the  hands  of  individual  police  officers  and \ndepartments like the WPD. \n15.  Once the WPD adds an individual to the Gang List, that individual is automatically \nsubject to enhanced monitoring and surveillance by Wichita police officers. Policy 527 prescribes \nfrequent records checks to identify Gang List designees and instructs certain members of the \nDepartmentโs Records Bureau to โnotify officers by use of Signal 33 [radio message consisting of \nthe number 33] if a records check reveals an individual is listed in the Wichita Police Department \ncomputer as a gang member or associate.โ  \n16.  Upon information and belief, a Signal 33 is communicated directly to an officer in \nthe field who calls in identifying information such as a license plate number or a driverโs license, \nand is understood to mean that the individual so identified is a gang member. \n17.  The information obtained through such Signal 33 notifications can then be used by \nofficers during the course of a traffic or street stop, even if the person stopped is unaware that they \nare on the Gang List. On information and belief, this results in officers approaching stopped \nindividuals identified through Signal 33 notifications in potentially more combative or escalating \nmanners, including with weapons drawn.  \n18.  Once a WPD officer adds a person to the Gang List, Wichita police officers are not \njust encouraged, but procedurally required, to intermittently monitor multiple facets of that \npersonโs daily life, including reviewing their social media accounts and running a โGoogle Searchโ \n6 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 7 of 62\non the individual. Upon information and belief, this procedural obligation is consistently carried \nout on persons of color on the Gang List, but not nearly to the same extent on white gang members \nand associates. \n19.  Further, Wichita police officers routinely target people currently on the Gang List, \nor those whom the Police Department would like to add to the Gang List, for traffic enforcement. \nIndividuals on the list report that WPD officers repeatedly watch, stop, search, harass, and \nintimidate them for engaging in noncriminal, innocent conduct. \n20.  Neither  K.S.A.  21-6313  nor  WPD  Policy  527  establishes  any  procedure  for \nproviding listed persons with notice or an opportunity to contest their designation on the Gang List \nas either a gang member or associate. On the contrary, Policy 527 states that the Gang List is \nโconfidentialโ and โwill only be released to commissioned law enforcement/correctional officersโ \nor those authorized by certain Department leaders.  \n21.  In only one circumstance does Policy 527 outline some sort of notice. This occurs \nwhen a juvenile meets the gang member or associate criteria under K.S.A. 21-6313. In this case, a \nDepartment supervisor โwill attempt to contact the parent and/or guardian of the juvenile,โ who \nโwill be told how the juvenile met the gang criteria and will be informed of intervention options \nand resources.โ However, Policy 527 requires only that there be an โattemptโ made to contact the \nparent or guardian, with no explanation of how extensive the โattemptโ should be.  \n22.  Meanwhile, for adults, neither Policy 527 nor K.S.A. 21-6313 provides any notice \nto those designated as gang members or associates.  \n23.  As a general matter, most individuals never know they are included in Wichitaโs \nGang List until it negatively affects them. Often, the first time a person becomes aware they are \non the Gang List occurs during a bond hearing or arraignment following his or her arrest when \n7 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 8 of 62\ninclusion on the Gang List is listed on the probable cause affidavit, a point at which it is too late \nto challenge his or her inclusion on the list before suffering harm. For both juveniles and adults \nwho know they are on the Gang List, there is no procedure to challenge the designation and demand \nremoval from the List.  \n24.  As a result of the surveillance and harassment that comes with being placed on the \nGang List, many individuals find it difficult to obtain or maintain jobs, access housing, or \nparticipate in various aspects of daily life. Members of the Wichita community have been afraid \nto leave their homes, interact with friends, or be around loved ones for fear of either being harassed \nby the WPD or placed or reinstated as active on the Gang List.  \n25.  When an individual is arrested on a person felony, the arresting officer is instructed \nto search the Gang List records for the arresteeโs name and to document the arresteeโs gang \nmember or associate status in an arrest affidavit. If the individual is listed on the Gang List and \narrested for a person felony, K.S.A 21-6316 mandates that judges set a cash or surety bail at a \nminimum of $50,000, regardless of the severity of the charge or the bond that would otherwise be \nappropriate. The only exception to this $50,000 minimum is if the reviewing court determines the \ndefendant is not likely to re-offend and the defendant agrees to submit to an โintensive pre-trial \nsupervision program.โ In such a case, designated WPD officers are then instructed to โmonitor \ndocumented gang members and associates for any violations of their probation/parole, bond, and \npretrial restrictions and will immediately report this to the proper supervising authorities with the \nintent of removing the offender from the community.โ \n26.  Once designated as a criminal street gang member or associate, an individual \nremains โactiveโ on the Gang List for a minimum of three years. If at any time during those three \nyears, the WPD document an individual engaging in a single criterion of K.S.A. 21-6313, the \n8 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 9 of 62\nthree-year period will start over. For instance, if a police officer observes a person on the Gang \nList wearing a particular โgang color,โ the police officer could extend the three-year period from \nthe date of that observation. Likewise, if the person has a documented โgang tattoo,โ then a police \nofficer could extend his or her three-year period if that person fails to conceal his or her tattoo, \nregardless of any actual ongoing gang affiliation.  \n27.  If an individual somehow manages to go three years without meeting any of the \nK.S.A.  21-6313โs  broad,  vague  criteria,  that  individualโs  Gang  List  status  is  changed  to \nโINACTIVEโโbut they are not removed from the Gang List. Indeed, Policy 527 provides no \nprocedure for any individual to ever be removed from the Gang List. The WPD agrees that there \nis no process by which an individualโs name is ever actually โremovedโ from the Gang List. \n28.  The result of the facial deficiencies and discretionary nature of K.S.A. 21-6313 and \nPolicy 527 is that Wichita Police place a large number of people, disproportionately people of \ncolor, on the Gang List each year without notice, without recourse, and in the absence of confirmed \nconnections between those individuals and criminal street gangs. Most of these individuals who \nare added to the Gang List have not been accused of, or charged with, criminal activity connected \nto a gang. \n29.  The  result  of  this  careless  and  unconstitutional  designation,  guided  by  an \nunconstitutionally vague and discretionary statute, is severe, ongoing, and  lifelong harm to \nindividuals included on the Gang List in violation of their constitutional rights. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n30.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffsโ claims pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. ยง 1331 because Plaintiffs seek a remedy under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.

Venue in this Court is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391. \nPARTIES \n32.  Organizational Plaintiff Progeny, a nonprofit organization in Wichita, Kansas, \noperates as a youth/adult partnership focused on reimagining the juvenile justice system and \nreinvesting in community-based alternatives.3 Progeny is run by a small executive staff and a team \nof Youth Leaders who help guide, shape, and execute the vision and mission of the organization. \nProgeny is an affiliate of Destination Innovations, Inc., a 501(c)(3) organization. \n33.  Progenyโs goals are to prevent incarceration of young people, to break the school-\nto-prison  pipeline,  and  to  direct  state  funds  into  community-based  programs  that  provide \nalternatives to incarceration.  \n34.  To fulfill its mission, Progeny hosts town halls, educates and works with members \nof the Kansas government, provides feedback to local and state leaders regarding their policy \npriorities, and organizes youth and community leaders around reform. Progeny also creates and \npublishes reports and other documents that translate youthsโ insights and needs into calls for \ngovernment action.  \n35.  Progeny seeks to empower young people who have come into contact with the \ncriminal justice system and provide these young people with counseling and support. Most of the \nyouth leaders for Progeny started out as young people who came up through its programs. \n36.  The WPDโs Gang List is completely contrary to Progenyโs mission and programs \nand directly impacts Progenyโs staff and youth leaders. Members of Progeny are on the Gang List, \n                                                 \n3 Progeny, Who We Are, https://www.progenyks.com/about-us.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 11 of 62\nand the existence of the Gang List makes it more difficult for Progeny to fulfill its mission and \nhelp Wichita youth who are involved in the justice system. Moreover, Progeny has had to divert \nresources away from its other work to provide assistance and resources to those who are suffering \nfrom the consequences of being on the WPDโs Gang List. \n37.  Plaintiff Christopher Cooper is a 26-year-old Black man residing in Wichita. He is \ncurrently listed as an โactiveโ gang member in the WPD Gang List. He has been on the Gang List \nsince at least 2015, when he was 18 years old. Mr. Cooper has suffered continuous harassment by \nDefendants, who routinely stop him for minor traffic violations. Upon information and belief, Mr. \nCooper has been denied employment of his choice because of Defendantsโ sharing of the Gang \nList with other entities. Mr. Cooper brings this action on behalf of himself and a class of similarly \nsituated individuals who are subjected to Defendantsโ unconstitutional actions connected to the \nGang List, and seeks injunctive and declaratory relief. \n38.   Plaintiff Elbert Costello is a 45-year-old Black man residing in Wichita, Kansas. \nHe is currently listed as an โactiveโ gang member on the WPD Gang List. He has been on the Gang \nList since at least 1997, when he was 22 years old. Mr. Costello has been continuously marked as \nโactiveโ on the Gang List because he gathers with friends his age, who are also on the Gang List. \nHe fears harassment or, worse, additional punishment, if he gets together with othersโincluding \nfamily membersโfor a beer, a barbecue, a family dinner, or a funeral. Mr. Costello brings this \naction on behalf of himself and a class of similarly situated individuals who are subjected to \nDefendantsโ  unconstitutional  actions  connected  to  the  Gang  List  and  seeks  injunctive  and \ndeclaratory relief. \n39.  Plaintiff Martel Costello is a 25-year-old Black man from Wichita. Mr. Martel \nCostello is incarcerated until 2025, currently in the Ellsworth Correctional Facility, because of a \n11 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 12 of 62\nprobation violation. Mr. Martel Costello was convicted of a marijuana offense and possession of \nfirearms. He learned he was on the Gang List for the first time when he was charged with these \ncrimes. He was released pre-trial and eventually sentenced to probation. While on probation, Mr. \nMartel Costello was forced to abide by certain special conditions  of probation, due to his \ndesignation as a gang member on WPDโs Gang List. These conditions included not having any \ncontact with any other known gang members, abiding by a strict curfew, and more. Mr. Martel \nCostello was repeatedly harassed by WPD while awaiting trial and while on probation, returned to \njail on several occasions due to alleged probation violations. Most notably, he was punished on \ntwo occasions for attending the funeral of a loved oneโfirst, his nieceโs funeral and later, his \nbrotherโs funeralโbecause other people listed on the WPDโs Gang List were also present. He was \nconsidered an active gang member on the WPD Gang List, but will be considered inactive as long \nas he is incarcerated. Once he is released, he will be considered an active gang member once again, \nand will again be subject to the extremely harsh gang conditions while on parole. He has been on \nthe Gang List since at least 2016. Mr. Martel Costello brings this action on behalf of himself and \na class of similarly situated individuals who are subjected to Defendantsโ unconstitutional actions \nconnected to the Gang List, and seeks injunctive and declaratory relief.  \n40.  Plaintiff  Jeremy  Levy,  Jr.  is  a  22-year-old  Black  man  from  Wichita.  He  is \nincarcerated until at least 2042, currently in the Hutchison Correctional Facility, because of a \nconviction of first-degree felony murder in 2017, when he was 18. Prior to being charged in that \ncase, Mr. Levy was listed on the WPDโs Gang List. Because of that, the prosecutor at his trial was \nallowed to introduce to the jury Mr. Levyโs alleged gang status and multiple alleged โgang \nincidentsโ of an alleged โgang feudโ for over six months prior to the alleged incident in which Mr. \nLevy was charged. There was no evidence that Mr. Levy had participated in those alleged gang \n12 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 13 of 62\nfeud events, nor any evidence that the incident with which Mr. Levy was chargedโwhich involved \nhim and another individualโwas gang-related. Mr. Levy is one of many individuals for whom \ntheir presence on the Gang List allows the prosecution to introduce irrelevant and prejudicial \ninformation at trial. Mr. Levy brings this action on behalf of himself and a class of similarly \nsituated individuals who are subjected to Defendantsโ unconstitutional actions connected to the \nGang List and seeks injunctive and declaratory relief. \n41.

K.S.A. 21-6313 defines โcriminal street gangโ and lays out the criteria that \nlaw enforcement agencies may use to designate someone a โcriminal street gang member.โ \nUnder 21-6313(b): \nโcriminal street gang memberโ is a person who: \n \n(1) Admits to criminal street gang membership; or \n(2) Meets three or more of the following criteria:  \n(A) Is identified as a criminal street gang member by a parent or guardian; \n(B) Is identified as a criminal street gang member by a state, county or city \nlaw enforcement officer or documented reliable informant; \n(C) Is identified as a criminal street gang member by an informant of \npreviously untested reliability and such identification is corroborated by \nindependent information; \n(D) Frequents a particular criminal street gangโs area; \n(E) Adopts such gangโs style of dress, color, use of hand signs or tattoos; \n(F) Associates with known criminal street gang members; \n(G) Has been arrested more than once in the company of identified criminal \nstreet  gang  members  for  offenses  which  are  consistent  with  usual \ncriminal street gang activity; \n(H) Is identified as a criminal street gang member by physical evidence \nincluding, but not limited to, photographs or other documentation; \n(I) Has  been  stopped  in  the  company  of  known  criminal  street  gang \nmember two or more times; or \n14 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 15 of 62\n(J) Has participated in or undergone activities self-identified or identified \nby a reliable informant as a criminal street gang initiation ritual.โ \n47.  WPD  Policy  527  was  drafted  to  be  consistent  with  K.S.A.  21-6313. \nHowever, the WPD had a functioning Gang List for decades before K.S.A. 21-6313 was \nenacted in 2006. Upon information and belief, the criteria in K.S.A. 21-6313 derived \nlargely from the criteria the WPD was already using, with the addition of K.S.A. 21-\n6313(b)(2)(J). After K.S.A. 21-6313 was enacted, however, the WPD went back and \naltered entries in its older records to conform with the statutory criteria listed in K.S.A. 21-\n6313. Thus, for those entries in the gang records prior to 2006, the entries may have been \naltered from what was there originally. \n48.  K.S.A. 21-6313 and WPD Policy 527 suffer from numerous constitutional \ndefects. For example, they provide no limitation on what type of clothing or paraphernalia \nmay satisfy the color criteria at K.S.A. 21-6313(b)(2)(E), permitting the WPD to identify \npeople as gang members, for example, if they wear certain professional sports team jerseys, \nschool uniforms, or common colors that they simply like. Further, there is no limit on or \nenumeration of which or how many colors may be considered gang-affiliated; as a result, \npeople are unable to conform their style of dress to K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527 to avoid \nbeing classified as gang members.  \n49.  As  another  example,  K.S.A.  21-6313  also  allows  the  WPD  to  place \nsomeone on the Gang List if that person is identified as a gang member by another law \nenforcement  officer.  Yet  there  is  no  limitation  or  process  required  for  such  an \nidentification, and no requirement that such an identification be verified or otherwise \ncorroborated in any way. Nor is there any requirement that the officer document the reasons \n15 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 16 of 62\nfor his or her belief that the individual is a gang member. Furthermore, there is no \nrequirement that a record of the name of the identifying officer be maintained, making it \nvirtually impossible to confirm or dispute the validity of any such identification. \n50.  There is no definition of โgang areaโ in either K.S.A. 21-6313 or WPD \nPolicy 527 and no way for an individual to know what that means in order to avoid such \nareas. \n51.  There is no way for an individual who is associating with another individual \nto know if that person is already on the Gang List; there is therefore no way for a person to \nknow whether or not they are meeting the criteria of K.S.A. 21-6313(b)(2)(F). \n52.  Under K.S.A. 21-6313(a), the WPD may place someone on the Gang List \nif the person self-identifies as a gang member. However, there is no requirement in policy \nor practice that a personโs โself-identificationโ as a gang member be verified. It is therefore \npossible for an officer to falsely claim that an individual admitted to being a gang member \nand place them on the list as a result.  \n53.  There is no way to know who is on the Gang List, no requirement for \nnotification that a person has been listed, no way to challenge the designation, and no way \nto be removed from the Gang List.  \n54.  These  almost  infinitely  broad  criteria  allowโeven  inevitably  causeโ\nrampant  discrimination  and  other  unconstitutional  practices  in  law  enforcement \napplication.  \n55.  This is borne out by the racial distribution of the Wichita Gang List itself. \nBased on information provided publicly by the WPD, there are currently 1,833 Active \nGang Members, 298 Associate Gang Members, and 239 Deceased Gang Members listed \n16 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 17 of 62\nin the Gang List. The racial disparities of membership on the list are stunning: 60% Black, \n25% Latinx, 9% other racial minorities such as Asian and Indigenous Peoples, and only \n6% White. \n56.  The statutory criteria included in K.S.A. 21-6313 are so broad and vague \nthat they are incapable of putting people on notice that their conduct or style of dress may \nresult in them being labeled a gang member. People are therefore unable to conform their \nconduct to avoid the consequences of meeting the statutory criteria and being placed on the \nGang List. \n57.  The consequences of being named in the Gang List are severe. They range \nfrom being denied employment, housing, and licenses; to being frequently surveilled and \nharassed; to having a high bail amount assessed upon arrest and exceedingly harsh \nprobation and parole conditions; to having irrelevant and prejudicial evidence admitted at \ntrial; to experiencing harsher and longer incarceration conditions.  \nUnconstitutionality of WPD Policy 527 \n58.  The WPDโs maintenance and use of a Gang List is governed by Kansas state \nlaw and WPD policy.  \n59.  WPD Policy No. 527 identifies procedures for how the WPD administers \nthe Gang List. Members of the WPDโs Gang/Felony Assault Section or Violent Crimes \nCommunity  Response  Team  are  responsible  for  monitoring  and  documenting  gang \nmembers in accordance with WPD Policy No. 527. \n60.  Virtually all of the criteria for identification as a criminal street gang are \nnon-criminal,  lawful  activities.  Many  of  these  criteriaโincluding  those  regarding \nassociation,  expression,  or  movement  within  the  communityโare  protected  First \nAmendment activities. \n17 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 18 of 62\n61.  The criteria that WPD officers use to determine gang affiliation are almost \nentirely unrelated to actual criminal conduct or active participation in gang activities.  \n62.  According to the WPD Gang Unit Supervisor, certain colors and symbols \nare associated with gangs. The WPD will consider individuals wearing these colors or \nsymbolsโincluding clothing associated with certain professional sports teamsโto be \nwearing a โgang style of dress or colorโ sufficient to meet the criteria listed in K.S.A. 21-\n6313.  \n63.  Upon information and belief, the WPD has a practice of falsely indicating \nthat individuals self-admitted to gang membership when entering them into the Gang List \nwithout corroboration of the admission, particularly when the officer cannot substantiate \nthe individualโs gang membership. This practice was documented in a video news story by \nWichitaโs KSN TV in May 2012. In the video, available on YouTube,4 two officers of the \nWPDโs Gang Unit are shown conducting a traffic stop because a passenger is not wearing \na seatbelt. After speaking with the men inside the car, an officer claims that the passenger \nself-identified as a gang member and appears to add the man to the Gang List on the spot. \nIn response to KORA requests, the WPD has refused to disclose statistics or information \nregarding the bases for including individuals on its Gang List, obscuring the full extent of \nthis practice. \n64.  The WPD frequently add people to the Gang List merely because such \npeople are related to, work with, or attend school with someone already on the Gang List. \nEven a single interaction with someone already on the Gang List may lead to an individual \nbeing designated a gang member or associate. Again, the WPDโs refusal to disclose its \n                                                 \n4\n Wichita Police Work to Slow Gang Violence - KSN TV, YouTube (May 10, 2012), \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUhRPu2Chao. Documented traffic stop begins at 2:48. \n18 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 19 of 62\nbases for including individuals on the Gang Listโeven as aggregate dataโobscures the \nfull extent of this practice.  \n65.  Individuals  can  be  included  on  the  Gang  List  merely  because  they \nโassociateโ with other people listed on the Gang List. This can include classmates, co-\nworkers, or even family members. \n66.  According to the WPDโs Standard Operating Procedure for Entries into the \nGang List, a person can be added to the Gang List as a โcriminal street gang associateโ if \nhe or she only meets two criteria listed in K.S.A. 21-6313, rather than the three criteria \nrequired to be listed as a โmember.โ \n67.  In practice, WPD officers often include individuals in the Gang List without \nany justification or evidence proving that they are in fact members of street gangs. \n General Parameters of the WPD Gang List \n68.  Pursuant to WPD Policy No. 527, if a WPD officer identifies a person for \ninclusion in the Gang List based on the criteria in K.S.A. 21-6313, the person will be listed \nin the Gang List as โactiveโ for a minimum of three years. If a person is listed as active, \nand then later becomes incarcerated, that person will be returned to active status upon \nrelease from custody.  \n69.  If a person is listed in the Gang List as active, but has โno documented \nactivityโ for three years, the personโs status will be changed to โinactive.โ However, \npursuant to WPD policy, the three-year period will start over if the person meets the criteria \nlisted in K.S.A. 21-6313, is involved in โcriminal street gang activity,โ or if there is  \nโdocumentation of criminal street gang member or associate criteria.โ \n70.  This means two things. First, a person can be listed in the Gang List for \nrelatively  innocuous  behavior,  such  as  wearing  a  particular  color,  appearing  in  a \n19 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 20 of 62\nphotograph with someone else listed on the Gang List, and/or living in a community with \nknown gang members. And second, once a person is listed in the Gang List, in order to be \nplaced as โinactive,โ that person would have to refrain from meeting a single Gang List \ncriteria for a three-year period. A person included on the Gang List for any reason would \nhave to avoid wearing any gang color, being seen or photographed with anyone on the \nGang List, and potentially move from his or her community to avoid being accused of \nโfrequenting a particular criminal street gangโs area.โ \n71.  For this reason, the WPD rarely moves people from โactiveโ to โinactiveโ \non the Gang List.  \n72.  Instead, people can remain on the Gang List for decades based on what they \nwear, whom they live near, whom they are related to, and myriad other examples of \ninnocent behavior.  \n73.  Elbert Costello, for example, has been on the Gang List for several decades. \nAlthough he is in his mid-40s and has children of his own, he is still friends with people \nfrom high school on the Gang List, and is therefore still labeled as a gang member. He is \nstill subject to surveillance and harassment and often has to endure needless and invasive \ntraffic stops. And his designation as a gang member is routinely extended for an additional \nthree years because of what he is wearing or whom he is seen with. In March 2021, Mr. \nCostelloโs placement on the Gang List as an active gang member was extended until March \n2024 because he was observed by WPD officers wearing a red โPhilliesโ hat in a photo on \nFacebook. \n74.  Other individuals on the Gang List have been pulled over by Wichita Police \nofficers while driving with their families and have had those officers refer to them by old \n20 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 21 of 62\nnicknames listed in the Gang List. These nicknames, like the individuals themselves, need \nnot have ever been gang-related in order for the individual to be included on the Gang List. \nThese individuals are now grown adults with children and grandchildren, having long left \nbehind adolescent nicknames and personas. Those individuals report feeling humiliated \nand degraded by the WPDโs insistence that they are gang members and by the WPDโs \nreference to them as gang members in front of their grandchildren.  \nLack of Notice and Ability to Contest Gang Membership  \n75.  The WPD provides no notice to the vast majority of people when they are \nfirst listed in the Gang List, provides no ongoing notice to anyone who is added or removed \nfrom the Gang List, and provides no notice to anyone who is moved from โinactiveโ back \nto โactive.โ \n76.  Many individuals find out they are on the list for the first time when they \napply for and are denied employment, housing, or licenses based on being on the Gang \nList, or when they are arrested or charged with a crime. \n77.  WPD Policy No. 527 does not include any provisions related to these vital \ncomponents of due process, with the sole exception being that the WPD will โattempt to \ncontactโ the parent or guardian of any juvenile listed in the Gang List. \n78.  Upon information and belief, however, the WPD does not in practice \ncontact the parents or guardians of juveniles when they are listed in the Gang List. Rather, \nmost youth (and their parents) remain unaware they are on the Gang List. \n79.  Even if the WPD does notify a parent of a juvenile they are on the Gang \nList, the parent is not given any opportunity to contest their childโs inclusion. The letter the \nWPD sends informing the parents of the juvenileโs inclusion merely offers to provide the \nfamily with โintervention options and resources.โ \n21 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 22 of 62\n80.  For many juveniles, the first time they learn they are on the Gang List is \nwhen they are arrested and their inclusion on the Gang List is listed in the Probable Cause \nAffidavit for their arrest. \n81.  The WPD also provides no process for challenging oneโs inclusion on the \nGang List or requesting to be removed from the Gang List. WPD Policy No. 527 offers no \nprocess or procedure regarding removal or challenging the listing, and the WPD posts no \nother relevant policies or procedures on its website nor makes such policies or procedures \npublicly available or known.  \n82.  Even if there were a publicly available policy or procedure for contesting \ninclusion on the Gang List or requesting removal, members of the public would not be able \nto avail themselves of it because the WPD does not notify people when they are added to \nthe Gang List. \n83.  The WPD shares its Gang List with other local, state, and national law \nenforcement  agencies,  including  the  Kansas  Bureau  of  Investigation,  pursuant  to  a \nConfidentiality  and  Usage  agreement.  These  other  entities  may  have  notice  of  an \nindividualโs placement on the Gang List, even though the individual does not know he or \nshe is on the Gang List. \n84.  Upon information and belief, entities with whom this information is shared \nare often contacted for background checks by potential employers, landlords, or licensing \nagents. Disclosure of the information that an individual is considered a member of a \ncriminal street gang has a huge negative effect on that individualโs employment, housing, \nand licensing prospects. \n22 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 23 of 62\nTargeting Innocent, Constitutionally-Protected Activity \n85.  The WPD has a policy or practice of encouraging its officers to surveil \nparticular communities and groups in order to add people to the Gang List.  \n86.  In particular, members of the WPDโs Gang Unit are instructed to surveil \ncommunity membersโ social media accounts to find photographs of people with known \ngang members, patrol and stop individuals in particular communities to question them as \nto whether they might meet the criteria for inclusion in the Gang List, and use traffic stops \nto identify drivers or occupants who are currently listed or qualify to be added to the Gang \nList. \n87.   Community members and Plaintiffs have experienced repeated examples \nof being subjected to this surveillance and targeting by WPD officers who are interested in \nadding more people to the Gang List. \n88.  When WPD officers pull over a vehicle for a traffic infraction, they will \nradio in a โSignal 33โ to check whether the driver or passengers are listed in the Gang List. \nIf they are listed, WPD officers may interrogate the driver and passengers, threaten them, \nor attempt to get information out of them regarding gang activity. If some of the passengers \nare not listed, but others are, the WPD may use that as evidence that the non-listed \npassengers should be added to the Gang List. \n89.  WPD policies, including their Instructions for New Gang Intel Form, directs \nWPD officers to document all interactions for documented gang members so that the Gang \nUnit will have a running list of the โvehicles they drive and who they associate with.โ This \nform also instructs officers to โdocument new addresses, vehicles, girlfriends, phone \nnumbers, and hang out locations,โ which then allows the WPD to surveil and closely track \nthose individuals and their friends and family. \n23 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 24 of 62\n90.  The WPD also regularly monitors the social media accounts of community \nmembers to identify evidence that could be used to label individuals as gang members. \nWPD Standard Operating Procedures provides instructions for how officers can save \nimages and videos from Facebook and YouTube that meet one of the criteria listed in \nK.S.A. 21-6313.  \n91.  Upon  information  and  belief,  assignment  to the  WPDโs  Gang  Unit  is \nconsidered  a  desirable  job  and  a  promotion  from  the  street  patrol  position.  When \nconsidering officers to promote to positions within the Gang Unit, the WPD considers how \nwell the officer is able to identify individuals to be added to the Gang List, including the \nofficerโs ability to covertly identify community members through social media and track \ntheir postings and shared photographs.  \n92.  Upon information and belief, some WPD officers maintain fake social \nmedia profiles in order to befriend members of the community to more easily have access \nto photos and other information that would allow the officers to add more people to the \nGang List and qualify for promotion to the Gang Unit. \n93.  Upon information and belief, WPD officers often pull people over, tell them \nthat they โjust want to talk,โ and then ask them a series of leading questions in an attempt \nto collect enough information that would justify adding those individuals to the Gang List. \n94.  These practices profoundly affect how Plaintiffs interact with their friends \nand families and move about the community. Community members report that they cannot \nride in the car with certain friends or go to certain public places in their neighborhoods \nbecause they are afraid it will cause them to be labeled as a gang member. \n24 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 25 of 62\nIncreased Punishment as a Result of Inclusion on Gang List \n \n95.  Inclusion in the Gang List can have profound impacts on a personโs daily \nlife, especially if they become involved in the criminal justice system. \n96.  In particular, if a person is listed in the Gang List and charged with a person \nfelony (whether or not the charged felony is connected with any of the criteria for Gang \nList inclusion), state law mandates that bail be set at a minimum of $50,000. K.S.A. 21-\n6316. The only exception is if the judge makes a finding on the record that the defendant \nis not likely to reoffend and will be subject to intensive pretrial supervisionโwhich often \ncomes at great personal and financial cost.  \n97.  Conviction of certain offenses also carry higher sentences if the person \nconvicted is a โknown criminal street gang member.โ See, e.g., K.S.A. ยงยง 21-6804, 21-\n6301, 21-6315, 21-6811. \n98.  Upon information and belief, prosecutors in the Sedgwick County District \nAttorneyโs office will also use a personโs inclusion on the Gang List as a reason to offer \nless attractive plea offers. \n99.  When a person is on the Gang List and sentenced to probation or released \non parole, they must abide by specific special conditions, including the following:5 \na.  Not associating with anyone affiliated in a gang; \nb.  Not wearing any clothing with the primary color being red; \nc.  Abiding by a curfew from 9:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m.; \nd.  Not riding in a car with more than one person unless those people are \nsiblings, parents, or children; \n                                                 \n5 A true and correct copy of the Sedgwick County Department of Corrections Gang Conditions Attachment is \nprovided as Exhibit B to this complaint. \n25 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 26 of 62\ne.  Not engaging in โthrowing or showing gang hand signsโ; \nf.  Not associating with a family member or extended family member who \nis a documented gang member (exception being immediate family \nonlyโbrother, sister, or parents); and \ng.  Not using social media to post โstatements having any relationship to . \n. . any gang whatsoeverโ or posting any photos or images โthat can in \nany way be associated with . . . any gang.โ \n100.  Because many of these conditions are inherently vague, proscribe innocent, \nconstitutionally protected conduct, and significantly curtail peopleโs ability to live and \nmove freely in their communities, the gang conditions imposed on those listed on the \nWPDโs Gang List create a significant risk of probation or parole violations. \n101.  Being on the WPDโs Gang List therefore results in significantly more \npunitive restrictions on a personโs liberty while on probation or parole than individuals not \non the Gang List, and may result in an increased risk that the WPD or the Sedgwick County \nDepartment of Corrections will charge that person with a probation violation and revoke \ntheir community supervision. \nDisparate Impact on Minority Communities \n102.  The  racial  and  ethnic  makeup  of  those  listed  in  the  Gang  List  is \noverwhelmingly Black and Latinx.  \n103.  According to the most recent census data, only 10.9% of the greater Wichita \ncommunity is Black, and only 17.2% is Hispanic. \n104.  However, roughly 60% of those listed in the Gang List are Black, and over \n25% are Latinx.  \n26 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 27 of 62\n105.  It is clear that inclusion in the WPD Gang List disproportionately impacts \nBlack and Latinx communities, suggesting that the WPD systematically targets Black and \nBrown neighborhoods and community members for gang enforcement activities and \nsurveillance.  \nProgeny and its Members are Negatively Impacted by the Gang List \n106.  Progeny is an organization that seeks to assist individuals who are involved \nin the criminal-legal system and work towards reducing, and eventually eliminating, the \nmyriad harms caused by the juvenile justice system. For example, Progeny holds town \nhalls, facilitates conversations with impacted youth, provides support and services to youth \nwho are involved in the criminal legal system or transitioning back to the community, and \nengages with elected officials regarding their policies and reform efforts that may impact \nsystem-involved youth. The Gang List is a direct impediment to carrying out that mission, \nas it stigmatizes Progenyโs members and Youth Leaders and their families, and prevents \nProgeny from assisting individuals listed in the Gang List to move away from any criminal-\nlegal system involvement. \n107.  Many  of  Progenyโs  members  and  Youth  Leaders  have  been  directly \nimpacted by the Gang List; they are either listed themselves, or have family members and \nfriends who are listed in the Gang List. \n108.  Other Progeny members have experienced repeated harassment by WPD \nofficers, including being pulled over while on their way to school or work and questioned \nabout gang activity. \n109.  Plaintiff Mr. Elbert Costello is a member of Progeny and works with \nProgeny  staff  to  help  advance  Progenyโs  mission  of  juvenile  justice  reform  and \nreinvestment. As discussed elsewhere in this Complaint, Mr. Costello is listed as an active \n27 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 28 of 62\ngang member on the WPD Gang List. Other members of Progeny are or previously were \nlisted as gang members on the WPDโs Gang List and have suffered harassment and \nsurveillance by the WPD as a result. And, given the broad and vague criteria of K.S.A. 21-\n6313, many other members of Progeny likely meet the criteria for being labeled as gang \nmembers or associates, yet do not know whether or not they are included on the Gang List.  \n110.  Because associating with individuals listed on the Gang List is a criteria for \ndesignation as a gang member or associate, K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527 strongly \ndiscourage Progeny from holding meetings of any kind. Most individuals have no way of \nknowing whether they are included on the Gang Listโor whether others affiliated with \nProgeny are. Meeting in large groups or even one-on-one thus puts Progeny members at \nrisk of causing each other to be designated as gang members or associates by the WPD. \n111.  Even worse, for individuals whose inclusion on the Gang List is known (due \nto an arrest affidavit, background check, or otherwise) or who have truly been connected \nwith street gang activity, K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527 in effect forbid anyone from \nproviding services or support to such persons. Interaction of any kind with such individuals \ncarries the risk of life-long gang member or associate designation, and the many criminal \nand civil consequences of that designation. In this way, both Progeny members and the \nindividuals and communities they seek to serve are discouraged from, punished for, and \ndeprived of fundamental rights of association and assembly. \n112.  The WPDโs policies prevent Progeny from successfully carrying out its \nwork helping juveniles involved in the criminal justice system. The Gang List consistently \nwraps up Progeny members in its throes, subjecting them to ongoing punishment and \n28 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 29 of 62\ndistracting Progeny from its ability to help those youth positively readjust to life in the \ncommunity.  \n113.  Progeny has had to divert resources away from other projects and direct \nindividual assistance to aid members who are facing repercussions associated with their \ninclusion in the Gang List. \n114.  Eliminating, the Gang List would allow Progeny to fulfill its mission of \nassisting youth in the justice system and helping the greater Wichita community reinvest \nin community-based alternatives. \nChristopher Cooper is Negatively Impacted by the Gang List \n \n115.  In 2014, Mr. Cooper was a college student at Highland Community College. \nHe had received a scholarship to K-State, and was preparing to transfer there. \n116.  While on break from school, he attended a party. At the party, there was an \naltercation and shooting ensued. As Mr. Cooper was leaving the party in his car, one of the \nindividuals involved in the shooting jumped into Mr. Cooperโs car, and Mr. Cooper drove \naway. \n117.  In the next few days, Mr. Cooper was arrested and charged with First \nDegree Murder. At his arrest, he learned for the first time that he had been included on the \nGang List. Mr. Cooper denies that he was ever a gang member or associate at any time. \n118.  Mr. Cooper had no criminal history prior to this event. \n119.  Mr. Cooperโs bail was set at $50,000 because he was on the WPDโs Gang \nList. Mr. Cooper remained in jail because he and his family could not afford the bail or \nbond amount. Eventually, the prosecution offered Mr. Cooper a plea deal: he could plead \nto obstruction of justice and accept probation. Ultimately, believing he had no choice, Mr. \n29 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 30 of 62\nCooper accepted the plea. He was incarcerated in jail for a year prior to accepting the plea \nand being sentenced.  \n120.  At  sentencing,  Mr.  Cooper  was  placed  on  strict  probation  with  gang \nconditions. He had a 6 p.m. curfew for over a year. He had to live away from his family \nbecause some of them were on the Gang List. Despite the hard conditions, Mr. Cooper \ncompleted his probation. \n121.  Mr. Cooper lost his scholarship to K-State and has never been able to go \nback to college. \n122.  Mr. Cooper has had no criminal charges or offenses since that incident in \n2014. He is employed in the aircraft manufacturing business. \n123.  Even though Mr. Cooper has had no further criminal events, he has been \nsurveilled and harassed by the WPD. He has been stopped repeatedly for traffic infractions, \nalmost always for failure to signal within 100 feet of an intersection. When officers \napproach his car, they already know his name and treat him like a criminal. This harassment \nwas consistent until Mr. Cooper began driving a car that is registered in the name of a \nfamily member. Since that time, he has not been stopped by the WPD. \n124.  Recently, Mr. Cooper applied for a job with another company that would \nhave been a promotion in position and salary. He believed that he was going to be offered \nthe job, but after a background check, he was turned down. Mr. Cooper believes that he \nwas turned down because the background check identified him as an active gang member.  \n125.  Mr. Cooper has never been and is not currently involved in or associated \nwith a criminal street gang in Wichita or anywhere else. \n30 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 31 of 62\n126.  Mr. Cooperโs presence on the Gang List has been extremely damaging to \nhim. Upon information and belief, he was treated more harshly than he would have been \nas a college student with no prior criminal history who was not on the Gang List. Because \nof this, he lost his scholarship and his chance to complete college. He is subject to \ncontinuous harassment to the point that he had to discontinue driving his own car. He has \nlost employment opportunities and the chance to advance in his career. The damages he \nsuffers are ongoing. \nElbert Costello is Negatively Impacted by the Gang List \n127.  Mr. Costello first learned that he was on the Gang List when he was arrested \nin connection with a shooting in Salina, Kansas, in 1997, and the charging documents listed \nhim as a known gang member. Prior to that, Mr. Costello was never told that he was on the \nGang List. \n128.  Mr. Costello was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and sentenced to a \nperiod of imprisonment. He was placed in a higher level custodial setting because of his \ninclusion on the Gang List.  \n129.  Following Mr. Costelloโs incarceration, he served three years on parole \nwhere he was subjected to punitive gang conditions and increased surveillance because of \nhis inclusion on the Gang List. \n130.  Mr. Costello was never given the opportunity to contest his inclusion on the \nGang List, nor notified of the reasons why he was placed on the list.  \n131.  Mr. Costello is not, nor has he ever been, a member of a criminal street gang \nin Wichita or anywhere else. Mr. Costello admits that he had relatives who were involved \nwith gangs, but he himself was never associated with a gang. \n31 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 32 of 62\n132.  Both  during  and  following  his  parole,  Mr.  Costello  was  subjected  to \nincreased surveillance and harassment by WPD officers. Mr. Costello wasโand continues \nto beโroutinely stopped by the WPD for minor traffic violations. For example, WPD \nofficers routinely pull Mr. Costello over for infractions such as โnot signaling within 100 \nfeet,โ and then subject Mr. Costello to invasive questioning.  \n133.  While Mr. Costello was on parole, the police would search his car anytime \nhe was stopped because he was on the Gang List and subject to special conditions of parole \nfor gang members. \n134.  Mr. Costello experiences fear and anxiety on a daily basis because he knows \nthat the WPD is watching him and will pull him over for any minor rule violation so that \nthey can intimidate and harass him. \n135.  Mr. Costello cannot get together with many of his lifelong friends because \nhe knows that they are also on the Gang List. Being together would give the WPD an \nexcuse to further target or harass Mr. Costello and his friends and change any of their \nstatuses on the Gang List from inactive to active. Mr. Costello also tries to avoid taking \nany photographs with his friends because he is afraid that the WPD will find them on social \nmedia and use them to continue to claim that he is in a gang. \n136.  Mr. Costello also avoids visiting certain businesses or establishments in his \ncommunityโincluding gas stationsโthat he thinks the WPD has identified as โgang \nhangouts.โ He therefore drives out of his way to get gas to avoid being further targeted by \nthe police. \n137.  In Mr. Costelloโs WPD gang record, which counsel was allowed to view \nbut was not provided copy of, there are approximately 30 entries pertaining to Mr. \n32 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 33 of 62\nCostelloโs actions over the last 25 years. The majority of those entries concern photos of \nhim or notations of him socially interacting with others on the Gang List. Each instance \nhas led to Mr. Costello being โrenewedโ on the Gang List for an additional three years as \nan โactive gang member.โ  \n138.  Most recently, on January 16, 2021, there is a notation that an officer \nobserved Mr. Costello in a photo on social media wearing a red โPhiladelphia Philliesโ \nMajor League Baseball cap. Because the color red is associated with a gang, the WPD \ndeemed this a gang related activity and extended Mr. Costelloโs period of โactiveโ gang \nmembership until January 2, 2024.  \n139.  On March 10, 2021, Mr. Costello was identified as a โknown gang memberโ \nin a story in The Wichita Eagle about a shooting that did not involve him at all.6 Apparently, \na parole officer stated to the reporter that the alleged perpetrator of the shooting had been \nseen in January 2021 with Mr. Costello, who was a โknown gang member.โ The occasion \nof which the parole officer was speaking was the funeral of a friend of Mr. Costelloโs. Mr. \nCostello exchanged pleasantries with the other individual, and that was all, but it was \nconsidered an incidence of gang association. Mr. Costello was embarrassed and humiliated \nthat he had been publicly identified as a known gang member in a publication available \nthroughout his home town of Wichita. The Wichita Eagle has since revised its article to \nremove Mr. Costelloโs name, after receiving complaints from Mr. Costelloโs friends and \nfamily. \n140.  Mr. Costelloโs inclusion on the Gang List has had a profound impact on his \nlife. It has prevented him from maintaining meaningful relationships, prevented him from \n                                                 \n6 A true and correct copy of the news article, as it appeared in The Wichita Eagle on March 10, 2021, is attached as \nExhibit C. \n33 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 34 of 62\nfrequenting  businesses,  and  has  subjected  him  to  unrelenting  and  unconstitutional \nsurveillance and enforcement activity by the WPD, which causes him significant anxiety \nand fear. Because Mr. Costello sometimes socializes with friends his age, who were also \nput on the Gang List in their youth, it appears that the WPD intends to list him as an active \ngang member throughout his life. \nMartel Costello is Negatively Impacted by the Gang List \n141.  Plaintiff  Martel  Costello  was  charged  with  marijuana  offenses  and \npossession of firearms offenses in September 2016. He had no prior adult criminal history \nand only one juvenile offense on his record. He learned that he was on the WPDโs Gang \nList at the time of his arrest.  \n142.  Mr. Martel Costello was released pretrial following his arrest. While on \npretrial release, he was repeatedly stopped by the WPD for traffic violations and then \narrested for unknown outstanding warrants. At no point during any of these stops did the \nWPD issue Mr. Martel Costello a ticket for a traffic infraction. Instead, the WPD used these \ntraffic stops as a reason to search Martelโs car and arrest him.  \n143.  When arrested, Mr. Martel Costelloโs bond amounts were set very high due \nto his status on the WPDโs Gang List. His mother had to place her home up as collateral in \norder to bond him out of jail. \n144.  In  October  2017,  Mr.  Martel  Costello  reached  a  plea  deal  with  the \nprosecutor for his underlying charges. At sentencing, the judge gave him an initial sentence \nof 18 monthsโ probation, with 79 months underlying should he violate the terms of his \nprobation. The judge also assigned him special conditions of probation due to Mr. Martel \nCostelloโs status on the WPDโs Gang List. These conditions included a restrictive curfew \nand prohibition on associating with anyone else listed on the Gang List.  \n34 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 35 of 62\n145.  From  October  2017  to  April  2018,  Mr.  Martel  Costello  lived  in  the \ncommunity and abided by these conditions, with the exception of two minor infractionsโ\nusing alcohol on one occasion, and being six minutes late for curfew on another occasion.  \n146.  In  April  2018,  Mr.  Martel  Costello  was  attending  a  family  gathering \nfollowing the death of his niece. A drive-by shooting occurred while he was in the home; \nthe shooter fired at the houseโs garage. When the WPD came to investigate the drive-by \nshooting, they found that Mr. Martel Costello was in the home with another person listed \non the Gang Listโ Mr. Martel Costelloโs cousinโand that his aunt had her handgun in \nher purse. As a result of this, Mr. Martel Costello was charged with firearm possession (for \nhis auntโs gun, which he did not bring and was not on his person) and with a probation \nviolation for being with a known gang member. He was incarcerated for this on April 25, \n2018. \n147.  Between June 2018 and June 2019, Mr. Martel Costello served time in \nvarious settings. Ten days after being released from custody in June 2019, the WPD pulled \nhim over again, claiming that the car he had recently bought had bad tags. The WPD \nimpounded the car and searched it, thereby leading to a new charge of possession of \nparaphernalia and a traffic ticket for the bad tag. The WPD arrested Mr. Martel Costello \nand incarcerated him again, pending adjudication of these new charges.  \n148.  In late August 2019, Mr. Martel Costelloโs brother passed away. On August \n21, 2019, his family posted Mr. Martel Costelloโs bond so that he could be with the family \nfor his brotherโs funeral. The funeral was held on August 23, 2019, and Mr. Martel Costello \nattended in person.  \n35 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 36 of 62\n149.  The following Monday, Mr. Martel Costelloโs probation officer told him \nthat he needed to come in to take a urinalysis screen. When Mr. Martel Costello showed \nup for the screen, he was placed under arrest for violating his conditions of releaseโ\nnamely, being at his own brotherโs funeral, because other people on the WPDโs Gang List \nwere also present. \n150.  Mr. Martel Costello was eventually sentenced to prison for the probation \nviolation charges, plus the possession of paraphernalia charge from June 2019. His earliest \nrelease date is 2023, but if he loses his good time credit for any reason, he will remain \nincarcerated through 2025. \n151.  On information and belief, the WPD placed Mr. Martel Costello on its Gang \nList in 2016 because of whom Mr. Martel Costello was related to, rather than any particular \nconduct by Mr. Martel Costello. Since then, the WPD has taken every opportunity to \nharass, surveil, and punish Mr. Martel Costello simply because he is on the Gang List.  \n152.  Mr. Martel Costello has had to abide by strict conditions of probation and \npretrial release every time he is bonded out of jail because of the WPDโs designation that \nhe is a gang member. These conditions are so punitive that on two occasions Mr. Martel \nCostello has been sent back to an incarceration setting simply for attending the funeral of \na loved one. \n153.  Mr. Martel Costello has never been involved in any gang activity and was \nnever told why he was placed on the Gang List in the first place. \n154.  Whenever Mr. Martel Costello is living in Wichita, such as when he has \nbeen released pretrial or on probation, he is subjected to consistent harassment by the WPD, \nincluding multiple traffic stops and searches. Despite these unrelenting traffic stops, Mr. \n36 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 37 of 62\nMartel Costello has yet to receive a ticket for an alleged traffic offense, except the โbad \ntagโ ticket detailed above. \n155.  Mr. Martel Costello fears that because of his arbitrary placement on the \nGang List, he will never be able to interact with his friends and family or conform his \nconduct in a way that will keep the WPD from labeling him as a gang member. \n156.  Because of Defendantsโ actions, Mr. Martel Costello has been subjected to \nsignificantly harsher punishment than he would have experienced had he not been on the \nGang List. \nJeremy Levy, Jr. is Negatively Impacted by the Gang List \n157.  Plaintiff Jeremy Levy, Jr. was charged with first-degree felony murder in \n2017 when he was 18 years old. The charges involved an incident where Mr. Levy and \nanother individual were involved in an altercation that involved shots being fired in a \nparking lot, and a bystander in a car in the parking lot was killed. \n158.  The altercation involved a dispute between Mr. Levy and another individual \nover the affection of a young woman. \n159.  There was no scientific evidence that the shot that killed the bystander came \nfrom Mr. Levy. \n160.  Prior to this incident, Mr. Levy had never been charged with a crime. As a \njuvenile, Mr. Levy had some interaction with the juvenile justice system, but only in a few \nincidents that would have constituted misdemeanors for an adult.  \n161.  Mr. Levy believes the WPD added him to its Gang List when he was 13 \nyears old. Mr. Levy was riding in a car with his cousins when the car was pulled over by \nthe WPD. Mr. Levy believes he was added to the Gang List then because one of his cousins \nwas already on the Gang List.  \n37 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 38 of 62\n162.  Mr. Levy is not, nor has he ever been, a member or associate of a criminal \nstreet gang in Wichita or elsewhere. \n163.  During his trial for felony murder, the prosecutor moved the court to allow \nthe entry of Mr. Levyโs gang status into evidence of a motive for an โotherwise inexplicable \nevent,โ on the theory that the shooting was part of a gang feud. \n164.  The prosecutorโs evidence of the alleged theory was that Mr. Levy was \nlisted on the Gang List as a Folk Gang Disciple and the other individual was listed on the \nGang List as being a member of a different gang. \n165.  Over  Mr.  Levyโs  objection  both  pre-trial  and  during  the  trial,  the \nprosecution introduced evidence of at least 13 different โgang related incidents.โ These \nalleged incidents included several shootings and other serious criminal offenses. It was not \nalleged that Mr. Levy was present or involved during any of these events except one event \nin which Mr. Levy was himself injured, which was not related to any gang activity.  \n166.  The introduction of the gang-related incidents was extremely prejudicial to \nMr. Levy, and it guaranteed that he could not receive a fair trial for the one incident with \nwhich he was charged. Even though he was not alleged to have personally participated in \nthe  โgang-related  events,โ  these  events  were  put  before  the  jury  as  background  to \ndemonstrate that the incident with which he was charged was not an isolated event. The \njury convicted him of first-degree felony murder, and he received a harsh sentence, in \nwhich he will not be eligible for parole at least until 2042.  \n167.  Mr. Levy is one of many individuals for whom their presence on the Gang \nList has allowed prosecutors to introduce irrelevant and prejudicial information at trial.  \n38 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 39 of 62\n168.  Presence on the Gang List has additional consequences for such individuals, \nincluding a mandatory bail of at least $50,000, longer sentences in higher security prisons, \nfar harsher probation and parole conditions, and, upon information and belief, negative \neffects on their ability to obtain favorable pleas or diversions. \n169.  Upon information and belief, individuals on the Gang List with stricter \nconditions of probation are more likely to be found in violation of their probation and \nincarcerated as a result, even if their original offense of conviction did not justify a prison \nsentence. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n170.  Pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(2), the individually \nnamed Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and all other persons similarly situated \nas members of the proposed class. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief against the \nDefendants on behalf of the class. \n171.  This  action  satisfies  the  numerosity,  commonality,  typicality,  and  adequacy, \nrequirements of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a).  \n172.  Plaintiffs bring this class action on behalf of the following classes, as set forth \nbelow: \nListed Gang Member or Gang Associate Class \nAll persons included in the Wichita Police Departmentโs Gang List as an Active or \nInactive Gang Member or Gang Associate. \n \nEqual Protection Class \nAll persons included in the Wichita Police Departmentโs Gang List as an Active or \nInactive Gang Member or Gang Associate who are Black, Latinx, or a member of \nanother racial minority group, such as Asian or Indigenous Peoples. \n \n39 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 40 of 62\n173.  Plaintiffs reserve the right to amend the class definition if discovery or further \ninvestigation reveals that the class should be expanded, divided into subclasses, or modified in any \nway. \nNumerosity \n174.  Although the exact number of class members is uncertain and can be determined \nonly through appropriate discovery, the number is great enough such that joinder is impracticable. \nBased on information provided publicly by the WPD, there are currently 1,833 Active Gang \nMembers and 298 Associate Gang Members listed in the Gang List. The class is sufficiently \nnumerous to warrant class treatment, and the disposition of the claims of these class members in a \nsingle action will provide substantial benefits to all parties and to the Court. \n175.  Plaintiffs do not currently know the identities of all class members. Plaintiffs are \ninformed and believe the identities of class members may be obtained from information collected \nand maintained by the WPD.  \nTypicality \n176.  Plaintiffsโ claims are typical of the claims of the class in that Plaintiffs, like all class \nmembers, have been placed on the WPDโs Gang List in violation of their constitutional rights.  \n177.  Thus, Plaintiffs have the same interests and have suffered the same type of harm as \nthe class members. Plaintiffsโ claims are based upon the same or similar legal theories as the claims \nof the class members.  \n178.  Moreover, the factual bases of Defendantsโ misconduct are common to all class \nmembers and represent a common thread of misconduct resulting in similar injury to all members \nof the class. \n40 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 41 of 62\nAdequate Representation \n179.  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent and protect the interests of the classes. \nPlaintiffs have retained counsel with substantial experience litigating civil rights issues and class \nactions. Plaintiffs and their counsel are committed to vigorously prosecuting this action on behalf \nof the class and have adequate resources to do so.  \n180.  Neither Plaintiffs nor their counsel has interests adverse to the classes. \nCommonality  \n181.  There are numerous questions of law and fact common to Plaintiffs and the class \nmembers. The legal harms suffered by Plaintiffs and class members are identical. The answers to \nthese common questions will thus advance resolution of the litigation as to all class members. \nThese common legal and factual issues include: \na.  Whether K.S.A. 21-6313 is unconstitutionally broad and vague. \nb.  Whether K.S.A. 21-6313 and the actions of Defendants violate the Due Process \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. \nc.  Whether K.S.A. 21-6313 and the actions of Defendants violate the Equal \nProtection  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  of  the  United  States \nConstitution. \nd.  Whether K.S.A. 21-6313 and the actions of Defendants violate the Right of \nAssociation and Expression Clause of the First Amendment of the United States \nConstitution. \ne.  Whether  Plaintiffsโ  constitutional  rights  were  violated  as  a  result  of  a \nlongstanding or widespread custom or practice that was the moving force \nbehind the constitutional violations.  \n41 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 42 of 62\nRule 23(b)(2) Injunctive or Declaratory Relief \n182.  Plaintiffs and members of the class request certification of a class under Rule \n23(b)(2) because Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the \nclass, such that final injunctive relief or declaratory relief is appropriate with respect to the class \nas a whole. Defendantsโ policies, practices, customs, and conduct have resulted in, and will \ncontinue to result in, irreparable injury to Plaintiffs and class members, including, but not limited \nto, violations of their constitutional and statutory rights. Plaintiffs have no plain, adequate, or \ncomplete remedy at law to address the wrong described herein.  \n183.  The injunctive relief requested by Plaintiffs and class members includes, but is not \nlimited to, an injunction striking down the WPDโs use of the Gang List and enjoining Defendants \nfrom operating a Gang List in the future. \n184.  Plaintiffs  and  the  class  also  seek  a  declaration  (1)  that  K.S.A.  21-6313  is \nunconstitutionally vague and overbroad, (2) that Defendantsโ maintenance and use of a Gang List \npursuant to Policy No. 527 violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States \nConstitution, and (3) adjudging Defendantsโ policies and actions to be unconstitutional. \n185.  Further, Plaintiffs and the class seek a declaration that Defendants acted with \nnegligence, gross negligence, and willful, wanton, and careless disregard for the constitutional \nrights of Plaintiffs and members of the class.  \nRule 23(c)(4) Certification of Particular Issues \n186.  In the alternative to certification under Rule 23(b)(2), Plaintiffs and the class seek \nto maintain a class action with respect to particular issues under Rule 23(c)(4). \n42 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 43 of 62\n187.  Specifically, the questions of whether K.S.A. 21-6313 is unconstitutionally broad \nand vague, violates the First Amendment, or violates the Fourteenth Amendment are suitable for \nissue certification under Rule 23(c)(4). \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCount I: Violation of Fourteenth Amendment Right to Due Process \nVagueness \nAll Plaintiffs and Class Members \n \n188.  Plaintiffs incorporate each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully restated herein.  \n189.  K.S.A. 21-6313, et seq., violates Plaintiffs right to due process of law under the \nFourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution by failing to give Plaintiffs fair notice of \nthe requirements they must meet under the statute.  \n190.  K.S.A. 21-6313, et seq., is unconstitutionally broad and vague in that it allows \nindividuals to be designated as criminal street gang members based on innocent, non-criminal \nactivities, such as what they wear, where they live, and whom they are related to. \n191.  K.S.A. 21-6313, et seq., is unconstitutionally vague because the statute includes \nbroad undefined language including, inter alia, terms such as โgang area,โ โstyle of dress,โ โhand \nsignals or tattoos,โ โoffenses consistent with criminal street gang activity,โ and โphysical evidence \nsuch as photographs or other documentationโ that are capable of multiple interpretations and \nprovide virtually unfettered discretion for police to designate an individual as a gang member or \nassociate. \n192.  K.S.A. 21-6313, et seq., is unconstitutionally vague because individuals do not \nknow whether or not they are on the Gang List, or whether their clothing choices, neighborhood \nof residence, or other elements of everyday life would qualify them for inclusion on the Gang List. \n43 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 44 of 62\nPeople therefore cannot conform their conduct to avoid being identified as an associate or member \nof a gang and placed on the Gang List. \n193.  The unconstitutional vagueness of K.S.A. 21-6313, et seq. causes significant injury \nand damage to all named Plaintiffs. Because Wichita residents are unable to conform their conduct \nto avoid inclusion on Wichitaโs Gang List, Progeny Kansas is unable to operate in a way that \navoids  placing  its  members  at  risk  of  List  membership  and  resulting  civil  and  criminal \nconsequences. Mr. Elbert Costello is unable to make basic life decisionsโsuch as where to buy \ngas or what clothing to wearโin a way that ensures he will not be re-identified by the WPD as an \nactive gang member. Mr. Martel Costello and Mr. Levy will be unable to avoid violating probation \nand pretrial release conditions that are premised on their own Gang List membership because they \ndo not know who else is on the Gang List. Like all Wichita residents, Mr. Cooper is unable to \nconform his conduct to the WPDโs vague gang membership criteria and avoid the consequences \nof Gang List membership. \nCount II: Violation of Fourteenth Amendment Right to Due Process \nFailure to Provide Procedural Due Process to Progeny (42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \nProgeny  \n \n194.  Plaintiffs incorporate each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully restated herein. \nProgenyโs members not named as individual Plaintiffs in this lawsuit would have standing to sue \nin their individual capacities if named as Plaintiffs. These members have suffered injuries in fact, \nincluding the deprivation of constitutional rights to expression and assembly and procedural and \nsubstantive due process, as well as unlawful police detentions, interrogations, searches, and \nsurveillance, and reputational and financial harms including denial of employment, housing, and \nparticipation in social groups. \n44 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 45 of 62\n195.  By bringing this lawsuit, Progeny seeks to protect interests that are germane to \nProgenyโs  purpose.  Progenyโs  mission  and  operations  center  on  the  assembly,  expression, \nassociation and support of at-risk youth. By precipitating civil and criminal punishments on \nWichita residents for, among other things, entering certain neighborhoods and associating with \ncertain individuals, K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527 directly obstruct Progenyโs purpose and \noperations. Progeny seeks the invalidation of K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527 so that it may carry \nout its philanthropic and constitutionally-protected mission. \n196.  Neither the claims asserted nor the relief requested in this complaint requires the \nparticipation of Progenyโs individual members in this lawsuit. Individual participation would be \nprohibitively cumbersome and would amplify the unnecessary reputational harm caused by the \nWPDโs erroneous and improper designation of Progeny members as gang members. Moreover, \nthe constitutional defects of K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527 may be adjudicated, and the statute \nand Policy invalidated, without the participation of unnamed individual Progeny members. \n197.  The foregoing actions by Defendants violate 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and the Fourteenth \nAmendment of the United States Constitution.  \n198.  The Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees that no \ncitizen will be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. \n199.  The Gang List and Defendantsโ policies and practices of (1) not providing notice to \nindividuals that they are listed in the Gang List, (2) not allowing individuals to contest their \naddition to the Gang List, (3) not providing a clear process for individuals to petition for removal \nfrom the Gang List, and (4) renewing individuals as Active Gang Members on the Gang List \nwithout notice or any opportunity to challenge interfere with Progenyโs mission of keeping Kansas \nyouth out of the criminal justice system. \n45 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 46 of 62\n200.  The criteria for gang membership set forth in of K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527 do \nnot reliably identify members of criminal street gangs for inclusion on the Gang List. As such, \nthese criteria are arbitrary and capricious, and serve no legitimate government interest. In fact, the \nuse of arbitrary criteria leading to consistently inaccurate gang membership designations frustrates \nany conceivable legitimate government interest in combating gang violence or crime generally. \n201.  The Gang List interferes with Progenyโs mission of keeping Kansas youth out of \nthe criminal justice system because the inability to petition for removal from the Gang List keeps \nKansas youth tied indefinitely to the criminal justice system and interferes with the ability of these \nyouth to get education and employment. \n202.  Complications  resulting  from  the  WPDโs  Gang  List  policies  absorb  Progeny \nresources that would otherwise be devoted to its philanthropic mission, further damaging Progeny \nand its members. \n203.  The  Gang  List  further  interferes  with  Progenyโs  mission  because  it  restrains \nProgeny from hosting events or associating with Kansas youth. Because individuals are unable to \ndetermine whether they are listed on the Gang List, Progeny and the youth attending Progeny-\nhosted events risk being added to the Gang List based on the innocent, non-criminal activity of \nbeing in contact with others at such an event who are listed in the Gang List. \nCount III: Violation of Fourteenth Amendment Right to Due Process \nFailure to Provide Procedural Due Process (42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \nPlaintiffs Christopher Cooper, Elbert Costello, Martel Costello, Jeremy Levy, Jr., and \nAll Class Members \n \n204.  Plaintiffs incorporate each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully restated herein.  \n205.  The foregoing actions by Defendants violate 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and the Fourteenth \nAmendment of the United States Constitution.  \n46 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 47 of 62\n206.  The Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees that no \ncitizen will be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. \n207.  The Gang List and Defendantsโ policies and practices of (1) not providing notice to \nindividuals that they are listed in the Gang List, (2) not allowing individuals to contest their \naddition to the Gang List, (3) not providing a clear process for individuals to petition for removal \nfrom the Gang List, and (4) renewing individuals as Active Gang Members on the Gang List \nwithout notice or any opportunity to challenge violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Unilateral \naction by one WPD officer is sufficient to place Plaintiffs on the Gang List. Unilateral WPD action \nis also sufficient to renew Plaintiffsโ and othersโ inclusion on the Gang List indefinitely, with no \nprocess to allow them to protect their constitutional rights by challenging their inclusion or \npetitioning to be removed. \n208.  Plaintiff Christopher Cooper received no notice of his designation as a gang \nmember on the WPDโs Gang List by WPD officers. He only learned that he had been designated \nas a gang member on the WPDโs Gang List at some previous time after he was arrested following \na shooting at party he attended. He has never been informed of the basis for his designation as a \ngang member, nor has he been provided an opportunity to challenge his designation or petition for \nremoval  from  the  Gang  List.  Likewise,  he  has  never  received  notice  or  been  provided  an \nopportunity to challenge subsequent renewals of his gang member status. Plaintiff Mr. Cooper is \nnot and has never been a member of a criminal street gang. \n209.  Plaintiff Elbert Costello likewise received no notice of his designation as a gang \nmember on the WPDโs Gang List by WPD officers. He only learned that he had been designated \nas a gang member on the WPDโs Gang List at some previous time after he was arrested in \nconnection with a shooting in Salina, Kansas, in 1997. Prior to his involvement in this lawsuit, he \n47 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 48 of 62\nhad never been informed of the basis for his designation as a gang member, nor has he ever been \nprovided an opportunity to challenge his designation or petition for removal from the Gang List. \nLikewise, he has never received notice or been provided an opportunity to challenge subsequent \nrenewals of his gang member status. As a result, he has been designated as an โactiveโ gang \nmember on the WPDโs Gang List for over 20 yearsโeffectively a perpetual lifetime designation. \nMr. Costello is not and has never been a member of a criminal street gang. \n210.  Plaintiff Martel Costello likewise received no notice of his designation as a gang \nmember on the WPDโs Gang List by WPD officers. He only learned that he had been designated \nas a gang member on the WPDโs Gang List at some previous time when he was arrested in \nconnection with marijuana offenses and firearm possession in 2016. He has never been informed \nof the basis for his designation as a gang member, nor has he been provided an opportunity to \nchallenge his designation or petition for removal from the Gang List. Likewise, he has never \nreceived notice or been provided an opportunity to challenge subsequent renewals of his gang \nmember status. Mr. Martel Costello is not and has never been a member of a criminal street gang. \n211.  Plaintiff Jeremy Levy, Jr. likewise received no notice of his designation as a gang \nmember on the WPDโs Gang List by WPD officers. He only learned that he had been designated \nas a gang member on the WPDโs Gang List at some previous time when he was arrested in \nconnection with a shooting in 2017. He has never been informed of the basis for his designation \nas a gang member, nor has he been provided an opportunity to challenge his designation or petition \nfor removal from the Gang List. Mr. Levy is not and has never been a member of a criminal street \ngang. Moreover, the incident with which he was charged and is now incarcerated was not gang-\nrelated. \n48 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 49 of 62\n212.  The criteria for gang membership set forth in of K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527 do \nnot reliable identify members of criminal street gangs for inclusion on the Gang List. As such, \nthese criteria are arbitrary and capricious, and serve no legitimate government interest. In fact, the \nuse of arbitrary criteria leading to consistently inaccurate gang membership designations frustrates \nany conceivable legitimate government interest in combating gang violence or crime generally. \n213.  Inclusion on the Gang List entails significant deprivations of liberty and property \nconsequences including detention, arrest, increased bond, criminal liability and incarceration or \nenhanced sentencing, restrictive probation conditions, and loss of employment, housing, and social \nopportunities. These deprivations significantly damage Plaintiffs and are effected without notice \nor an opportunity to be heard in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. \nCount IV: Violation of Fourteenth Amendment Right to Due Process \nFailure to Provide Substantive Due Process (42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \nAll Plaintiffs and Class Members \n214.  Plaintiffs incorporate each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully restated herein. \n215.  Under K.S.A. 21-6313, an individual may be included on the WPDโs Gang List \nbased entirely on lawful, innocuous, and constitutionally protected conduct. Once on the Gang \nList, individuals may be and regularly are renewed as โactiveโ members of the list due to lawful, \ninnocuous and constitutionally protected conduct. \n216.  Inclusion on the WPDโs Gang List leads to significant deprivations of life, liberty \nand property. These deprivations include:  \n๏ง  frequent, prolonged, intrusive, and hostile encounters with law enforcement; \n๏ง  unreasonable searches of property; \n๏ง  unjustified arrests; \n๏ง  unwarranted online and in-person surveillance; \n49 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 50 of 62\n๏ง  identification by and increased attention from WPD officers using โSignal 33โ; \n๏ง  allegations of gang membership in arrest affidavits and news media; \n๏ง  increased bail leading to prolonged imprisonment and financial hardship; \n๏ง  severely restrictive probation, pretrial release, and parole conditions; \n๏ง  re-arrest, detention, and incarceration for violations of restrictive release conditions; \n๏ง  diminished plea offers in connection with criminal charges; \n๏ง  introduction of gang membership as evidence in criminal proceedings, leading to \nextreme prejudice, conviction, and incarceration; \n๏ง  representation of gang membership to other public and private entities, leading to \nmisidentification of Plaintiffs as gang members in background checks and news articles \nor other public sources; and \n๏ง  loss of educational, employment, and housing opportunities. \nPlaintiffsโincluding Progeny and its members, individual named Plaintiffs, and Plaintiff \nclass membersโhave experienced and been damaged by these deprivations. \n217.  Additionally,  inclusion  on  the  Gang  List  is  stigmatizing.  Because  other  law \nenforcement entities have access to the Gang List, and inclusion on the Gang List may come up in \nbackground checks for employment, housing, or benefits, individuals face reputational harm and \ndisparate treatment as a result of Defendantsโ actions. \n218.  Because of his inaccurate designation as a gang member on the WPDโs Gang List, \nPlaintiff Christopher Cooper has experienced significant deprivations of life, liberty and property \nincluding frequent, prolonged, hostile and unjustified police stops; identification by and increased \nattention  from  WPD  officers;  heightened  punishment  leading  to  prolonged  imprisonment, \nfinancial hardship, and ultimately an unwarranted criminal plea and conviction; severely restrictive \n50 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 51 of 62\nprobation conditions including a 6 p.m. curfew and prohibition on contact with family members; \nloss of his college scholarship; and loss of an employment promotion in position and salary. \n219.  Because of his inaccurate designation as a gang member on the WPDโs Gang List, \nPlaintiff Elbert Costello has experienced significant deprivations of life, liberty and property \nincluding frequent, prolonged, intrusive, and hostile police stops; unreasonable searches of his car; \nidentification by and increased attention from WPD officers; unwarranted surveillance; severely \nrestrictive parole conditions; representation of gang membership to other public and private \nentities including The Wichita Eagle newspaper, and perpetual renewal of his inaccurate gang \nmember designation on the Gang List for reasons such as innocuous social interactions and \nwearing professional sports team paraphernalia. \n220.  Because of his inaccurate designation as a gang member on the WPDโs Gang List, \nPlaintiff Martel Costello has experienced significant deprivations of life, liberty and property \nincluding  frequent,  prolonged,  intrusive,  and  hostile  police  stops;  increased  bail  leading  to \nprolonged imprisonment and financial hardship; severely restrictive probation and pretrial release \nconditions including a curfew and ban on contact with family members and others (who in many \ninstances he has no way of identifying); re-arrest and incarceration for violations of restrictive \nrelease conditions; unreasonable searches of property; unjustified arrests; unwarranted police \nsurveillance; and identification by and increased attention from WPD officers. \n221.  Because of his inaccurate designation as a gang member on the WPDโs Gang List, \nPlaintiff Jeremy Levy, Jr. has experienced significant deprivations of life, liberty and property \nincluding introduction of gang membership as evidence in criminal proceedings, leading to \nextreme prejudice, conviction, and incarcerationโwhich continues to this day. \n51 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 52 of 62\n222.   Progeny members have experienced significant deprivations of life, liberty, and \nproperty including those described above. These deprivations interfere with Progenyโs essential \nfunctions and prevent it from accomplishing its mission of serving Wichita youth. \n223.  Causing and imposing significant deprivations of life, liberty, and property on the \nbasis of lawful, innocuous, and constitutionally protected behavior substantively violates the Due \nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.  \n224.  The WPDโs policies and practices therefore unconstitutionally impede individualsโ \nliberty interests without due process of law. \nCount V: Violation of Fourteenth Amendment Right to Equal Protection \nDisparate Impact on Minority Communities (42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \nPlaintiffs Christopher Cooper, Elbert Costello, Martel Costello, Jeremy Levy, Jr., and \nEqual Protection Class Members \n \n225.  Plaintiffs incorporate each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully restated herein. \n226.  Defendants have implemented, enforced, encouraged, and sanctioned policies, \npractices, and customs of using discriminatory policing tactics to target the named Plaintiffs and \nmembers of the Plaintiff class for inclusion in the Gang List based solely on their race and national \norigin, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The WPD intentionally \napplies a facially neutral policy in a discriminatory manner. As a result, Defendantsโ policy, \npractice, and/or custom of maintaining the Gang List violates the Equal Protection Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment.  \n227.  Data indicates that Defendantsโ Gang List-related policies and practices have a \ndiscriminatory effect on Black and Latinx communities and that Black and Latinx people are \nincluded in the Gang List at far higher rates than are similarly situated white people.  \n228.  On information and belief, the WPD created its Gang List to track and surveil Black \nand Latinx neighborhoods as part of an anti-gang enforcement strategy. \n52 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 53 of 62\n229.  The Kansas Legislature then codified the WPDโs harmful gang surveillance policy \nand  practices  by  passing  K.S.A.  21-6313,  basing  that  statute  on  the  WPDโs  practices  of \ncategorizing predominately Black and Latinx Wichita community members as gang members or \nassociates based on whom they hang out with, the businesses they frequent, and the color of \nclothing they wear. \n230.  By its acts and omissions, Defendants have acted under color of state law to deprive \nPlaintiffs of their Fourteenth Amendment rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.  \n231.  Defendants intend to discriminate against people when they violate peoplesโ rights \nthrough placement in the Gang List. Defendants pursued this policy precisely because of the \nadverse effects it has on Black and Latinx individuals.  \n232.  Defendants do not subject similarly situated white individuals and communities to \nthe same level of surveillance, harassment, and monitoring for inclusion on the Gang List as they \ndo Black and Latinx individuals and communities.  \n233.  Plaintiffs Christopher Cooper, Elbert Costello, Martel Costello, and Jeremy Levy, \nJr., have suffered injury and damage as a result of Defendantsโ racially discriminatory policies and \npractices. Each of these Plaintiffs is a Black male who is not, and has never been a member of a \ncriminal street gang, yet they have been included in the WPDโs Gang List. Each of these Plaintiffs \nhave suffered significant civil and criminal consequences as a result of their inclusion on the Gang \nList. Upon information and belief, similarly situated white residents of Wichita are not targeted \nfor inclusion on the WPDโs Gang List, and do not suffer the same civil and criminal consequences \nfor inclusion, such as enhanced surveillance and police harassment, deliberate perpetual renewal \nof Gang List status, unjustified arrests and searches, and introduction of Gang List status as \nevidence in criminal proceedings for non-gang-related charges. \n53 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 54 of 62\n234.  Defendants were and remain deliberately indifferent to the harm created through \nthe implementation of the Gang List. Defendants have carried out this policy at least in part \nbecause of the adverse effects it has had on Black and Latinx individuals, and a reasonable \ninference can be drawn that supervisors have intended those effects to occur. Despite notice of \nracial disparities in the Gang List, Defendantsโ policies and practices concerning the Gang List \nremain unchanged.  \n235.  Defendants have implemented, enforced, encouraged, and sanctioned the WPDโs \npolicy, practice, and custom of using and maintaining a Gang List in a manner that constitutes \nracial and/or ethnic discrimination against the Plaintiff class in violation of the Fourteenth \nAmendment. As a direct and proximate result of the aforesaid acts and omissions of the City of \nWichita, the Fourteenth Amendment rights of the Plaintiffs have been violated.  \n236.  Unless restrained by order of this Court, a real and immediate threat exists that the \nFourteenth Amendment rights of Plaintiffs will be violated by Defendants in the future. Plaintiffs \nseek injunctive and declaratory relief against Defendants to prevent the continued violation of their \nconstitutional rights. \nCount VI: Violation of First Amendment \nRight of Association and Expression ((42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) โ Direct Prohibition \nAll Plaintiffs and Class Members \n \n237.  Plaintiffs incorporate each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully restated herein. \n238.  K.S.A.  21-6313  and  Policy  527  unconstitutionally  proscribe  expressive  and \nassociative activity in violation of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  \n239.  K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527โs criteria for inclusion on the WPD Gang List \ninclude expressive and associative activities protected by the First Amendment. Such activities \ninclude, but are not limited to: contact with family members, friends, and others; residence in, or \n54 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 55 of 62\ntravel to, certain neighborhoods; participation in political, religious, and other social groups; and \ndisplay of colors and symbols on oneโs person or clothing. \n240.  Inclusion on the WPDโs Gang List under K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527 leads to \nadverse criminal consequences and enhanced punishment. Such consequences include, but are not \nlimited, to: mandatory minimum bail for certain offenses, enhanced probation conditions and \nintensive pre-trial monitoring, police surveillance, repeat detainment, questioning and arrest, \nenhanced criminal charges and diminished plea offers, and prejudicial admission of Gang List \nmembership  information  in  criminal  proceedings  leading  to  increased  conviction  and \nincarceration. \n241.  Plaintiff Progeny Kansas and its members are and have been damaged by K.S.A. \n21-6313 and Policy 527โs unconstitutional proscription of expressive and associative behaviors. \nProgeny and its members are directly restricted from organizing, conducting, and attending \npeaceable assemblies because doing so creates grounds for the WPD to add Progeny members and \nevent attendees to its Gang List and to harass, detain, search, and surveil them pursuant to K.S.A. \n21-6313 and Policy 527. Moreover, under K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527, attendance at such \npeaceable assemblies subjects Progeny members to increased bail for person offenses, more \nrestrictive probation and parole restrictions, and enhanced criminal charges and consequences, \nincluding the admission of highly prejudicial Gang List information as evidence in criminal \nproceedings. Upon information and belief, Progeny members and clients have been added to the \nWPDโs Gang List and subjected to these enhanced criminal consequences due to participation in \nProgeny activities and/or contact with other Progeny members and clients. \n242.  Plaintiff Christopher Cooper has been damaged by K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy \n527โs unconstitutional proscription of expressive and associative behaviors. As a result of his \n55 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 56 of 62\nunjustified inclusion on the WPDโs Gang List, Mr. Cooper was subjected to enhanced probation \nconditions which forced him to move away from and cease contact with members of his family. \nHis inclusion on the Gang List under K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527 meant that he was directly \nproscribed from associating with his own family members, in violation of the First Amendment to \nthe United States Constitution. \n243.  Plaintiff Elbert Costello has been damaged by K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527โs \nunconstitutional proscription of expressive and associative behaviors. His unjustified โactiveโ \ngang member status was recently renewed for an additional three years based on a photograph of \nhim wearing a hat in support of the Philadelphia Phillies baseball team. In the past, Mr. Costello \nhas been renewed on the Gang List for constitutionally protected, non-criminal associations with \nothers on the WPDโs Gang List. As his more than 20 years on the WPDโs Gang List has shown, \ninclusion on the Gang List subjects Mr. Costello to significant criminal consequences including \npolice harassment, arrest, unreasonable search, and surveillance. Moreover, should Mr. Costello \nbe arrested or charged with a person crime or other offense, he would be subject to increased bail, \nrestrictive probation or parole conditions, and the potential for his gang member status to be \nintroduced as highly prejudicial evidence in any criminal trialโconsequences not faced by \nindividuals facing identical charges who are not on the WPDโs Gang Listโbecause of how he \ndressed and the people with whom he was photographed. Mr. Costelloโs renewal on the WPDโs \nGang List for the expressive conduct of wearing a Philadelphia Phillies cap, and for the associative \nconduct of non-criminal interactions with others on the WPDโs Gang List, violates the First \nAmendment of the United States Constitution. \n244.  Plaintiff Martel Costello has been damaged by K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527โs \nunconstitutional proscription of expressive and associative behaviors. As a result of his unjustified \n56 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 57 of 62\ninclusion on the WPDโs Gang List, Mr. Martel Costello was subjected to enhanced probation \nconditions including prohibition on contacts with members of his family. Pursuant to these \nconditionsโa direct consequence of his inclusion on the Gang ListโMr. Martel Costello has been \narrested and incarcerated on two separate occasions specifically for being present at events with \nother family members who are included on the WPDโs Gang List. Both events were non-criminal \nin nature (K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527 are indifferent to whether such contacts have any \ncriminal purpose) and both were commemorations of recent family deaths: Plaintiff Costelloโs \nniece in one instance, and his brother in the other. Mr. Martel Costello is currently incarcerated for \nviolating his probation prohibition on contacts with certain family members by being present at \nhis brotherโs funeral. His inclusion on the Gang List under K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527 meant \nthat he was directly proscribed from associating with his own family membersโand arrested and \nincarcerated for doing soโin violation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n245.  Plaintiff Jeremy Levy Jr. has been damaged by K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527โs \nunconstitutional proscription of expressive and associative behaviors. As a result of his unjustified \ninclusion on the Gang List, Mr. Levy was subjected to increased punishment at his criminal trial \nbecause of his association with other people on the Gang List who may or may not have been \ninvolved in other, unrelated crimes. Moreover, once Mr. Levy is released on parole, he will be \nsubject to highly restrictive supervision conditions that will prevent him from associating with his \nfamily and friends, in violation of the First Amendment. \n246.  These and other enhanced criminal consequences are carried out by state and local \nlaw enforcement and corrections officers and constitute government action. \n247.  By  attaching  enhanced  criminal  consequences  to  constitutionally  protected \nactivities, K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527 directly and impermissibly prohibit and punish those \n57 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 58 of 62\nactivities with the force of state law and are invalid under the First Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution. \nCount VII: Violation of First Amendment  \nRight of Association and Expression (42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) โ Chilling Effect \nAll Plaintiffs and Class Members \n \n248.  Plaintiffs incorporate each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully restated herein. \n249.  K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527 unconstitutionally chill expressive and associative \nactivity among persons within the jurisdiction in which Defendants employ the Gang List in \nviolation of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \n250.  K.S.A.  21-6313  and  Policy  527  unconstitutionally  chill  intimate  associations \namong  private  individuals  including  associations  among  family  members,  friends,  school \nclassmates, co-workers, religious adherents, and others.  \n251.  Plaintiffs avoid engaging in such activities as contact with family members, friends, \nand others; residence in, or travel to, certain neighborhoods; participation in political, religious, \nand other social groups; and display of colors and symbols on oneโs person or clothing in order to \navoid being placed on the WPDโs Gang List. \n252.  K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527 chill expressive associations among members of \nnon-gang social and political groups. Any member of any group (including political parties, \nreligious organizations, and civic and educational bodies) could be added to the Gang List due to \ncontacts with others in the group who are listed in the Gang Listโwhether or not that person has \nin fact ever been connected with a gang. \n253.  Inclusion on the WPDโs Gang List under K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527 causes \nreputational harm, precipitating concrete injuries. \n58 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 59 of 62\n254.  Inclusion on the WPDโs Gang List leads to increased, extended and intensified \ninteractions with law enforcement. Designation as a gang member or associate leads to improper \npolice stops, detentions, interrogations, searches, surveillance, suspicion, and arrest. \n255.  Inclusion on the WPDโs Gang List leads to financial and physical harms including \ndenial and loss of employment, discrimination in housing, stigmatization and exclusion from social \ngroups, and harmed personal relationships. \n256.  As a result of K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527โs unconstitutional restrictions, \nOrganizational Plaintiff Progeny has been chilled and discouraged from constitutionally protected \nexpressive and associative behaviors. Progeny and its members have refrained from organizing, \nconducting, and attending peaceable assemblies where those included on the WPDโs Gang List are \nlikely to be present. \n257.  As a result of K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527โs unconstitutional restrictions, \nPlaintiff Christopher Cooper has been chilled and discouraged from constitutionally protected \nexpressive and associative behaviors. Mr. Cooper has refrained from associating with certain \nfamily members and intimate friends for peaceful purposes due to fear that such association might \ncause himself or others to be arrested, included or renewed on the WPDโs Gang List and subjected \nto continued or increased police harassment or other criminal consequences.  \n258.  As a result of K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527โs unconstitutional restrictions, \nPlaintiff  Elbert  Costello  has  been  chilled  and  discouraged  from  constitutionally  protected \nexpressive and associative behaviors. Mr. Costello has refrained from associating with certain \nfamily members and intimate friends for peaceful purposes due to fear that such association might \ncause himself or others to be included or renewed on the WPDโs Gang List and subjected to \ncontinued or increased police harassment or other criminal consequences. He has refrained from \n59 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 60 of 62\ncertain non-criminal commercial interactionsโincluding buying gas in his own neighborhoodโ\nfor fear that patronizing businesses in certain parts of town might cause himself or others to be \nincluded on the WPDโs Gang List and subjected to continued or increased police harassment or \nother criminal consequences. He has also refrained from the expressive conduct of taking or \nposting photographs to social media for fear that some non-criminal and non-gang related clothing \nor conduct will be used as grounds to renew his unjustified โactiveโ gang member status. This fear \nand restraint are well-founded, as he has repeatedly been renewed on the WPDโs Gang List and \nsubjected to police harassment and criminal consequences for precisely these types of non-\ncriminal, constitutionally protected associative and expressive actions. \n259.  As a result of K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527โs unconstitutional restrictions, \nPlaintiff  Martel  Costello  has  been  chilled  and  discouraged  from  constitutionally  protected \nexpressive and associative behaviors. Martel Costello has refrained from associating with certain \nfamily members and intimate friends for peaceful purposes due to fear that such association might \ncause himself or others to be arrested, included or renewed on the WPDโs Gang List and subjected \nto continued or increased police harassment or other criminal consequences.  \n260.  As a result of K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527โs unconstitutional restrictions, \nPlaintiff Jeremy Levy, Jr. has been chilled and discouraged from constitutionally protected \nexpressive and associative behaviors. Plaintiff Mr. Levy has refrained from associating with \ncertain family members and intimate friends for peaceful purposes due to fear that such association \nmight cause himself or others to be arrested, included or renewed on the WPDโs Gang List and \nsubjected to continued or increased police harassment or other criminal consequences. \n261.  The Federal Constitution protects Plaintiffsโ right to associate with others and to \nexpress themselves. See U.S. Const. Amend. I. \n60 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 61 of 62\n262.  Defendantsโ maintenance and use of the Gang List therefore unconstitutionally \nchills Plaintiffsโ First Amendment rights to associate and express themselves. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs on behalf of themselves and the putative class they seek to \nrepresent, request that this Court grant the following relief:  \na.  Issue an Order certifying this case as a class action pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure 23(a) and(b)(2);  \nb.  Issue a class-wide judgment declaring that K.S.A. 21-6313, et seq., and the policies, \npractices,  and  conduct  of  Defendants,  as  described  in  this  Complaint,  constitute \nviolations of the rights of Plaintiffs and the class they represent under the U.S. \nConstitution; \nc.  Issue a Preliminary and Permanent Injunction preventing Defendants from maintaining \nthe Gang List, implementing a Gang List or adding any individual to the Gang List in \nthe future, and removing from the Gang List all individuals currently or in the past \ndesignated as Gang Members or Gang Associates, whether characterized as Active or \nInactive; \nd.  Award Plaintiffs reasonable attorneysโ fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988; \nand \ne.  Allow such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper. \n \nDESIGNATION PLACE OF TRIAL \nPlaintiffs designate Wichita, Kansas as the place of trial for this action.  \n \n61 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 62 of 62\nDated this 15th day of April, 2021. \n              Respectfully submitted, \n              KANSAS APPLESEED CENTER FOR \n              LAW AND JUSTICE, INC. \n               \n              /s/ Teresa A.

STAT. ANN. \nยงยง 21-6313 to -6316.  This matter is now before the court on defendant City of Wichita, Kansasโs \n(โthe Cityโ) Motion for Protective Order.  (ECF 52.)  By way of this motion, the City asks the \ncourt to find that the City does not need to produce certain documents that are responsive to \nplaintiffsโ discovery requests because they are protected by the law enforcement privilege.  As \nexplained in further detail below, the court denies the motion because the court finds that the City \nhas not properly invoked this qualified privilege and, even if the court were to find that it applies, \nplaintiffs would overcome it.  \nI.  BACKGROUND \nUnder Kansas law, persons identified as members of โcriminal street gangsโ are subject to \ndifferent and greater penalties upon arrest.  KAN. STAT. ANN. ยงยง 21-6313 to -6316.  The WPD has \ncreated a โGang List,โ which is a list of persons whom WPD personnel have determined meet the \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 59   Filed 06/29/22   Page 2 of 15\ndefinition of a โcriminal street gang memberโ under the criteria listed in KAN. STAT. ANN. \nยง 21-6313(b).  WPD Policy 527 puts ยง 21-6313 into practice by defining the procedures for \nincluding an individual on the Gang List.  WPD Policy 527 provides that, after WPD adds an \nindividual to the Gang List, the individual will remain on either โactiveโ or โassociateโ status for \na minimum of three years.  (ECF 1-1, at 3.)   If after three years the individual has not engaged in \ndocumented criminal street gang activity, the individual will be designated โinactiveโ on the Gang \nList.  (Id.)  But this three-year period starts over if a WPD officer documents that the individual \neither meets the criteria set out in ยง 21-6313(b) or that the individual has been involved in criminal \nstreet gang activity or a gang-related incident. \nIn April 2021, plaintiffs filed this lawsuit against the City, which supervises and is \nresponsible for the WPD.  (ECF 1, at 13.)  The lead named plaintiff is Progeny, a Wichita nonprofit \norganization whose stated purpose is โreimagining the juvenile justice system and reinvesting in \ncommunity-based alternatives.โ  (Id. at 10.)  Progeny claims the Gang List is contrary to its mission \nand programs.  The other four named plaintiffsโChristopher Cooper, Elbert Costello, Martel \nCostello, and Jeremy Levy, Jr.โare individuals who claim they have been wrongfully designated \nas โcriminal street gang membersโ and added to the Gang List.  They assert that they have been \nsubjected to unconstitutional actions by the WPD by virtue of being placed on the Gang List, and \nthat this has negatively affected their lives in a host of ways.   \nPlaintiffs allege that ยง 21-6313 is facially unconstitutional and that the WPDโs practices \nand procedures regarding the Gang List violate their constitutional rights of due process, equal \nprotection, and free association and expression.  As pertinent to the current discovery dispute, \nplaintiffs assert that ยง 21-6313(b)โs criteria for placing or keeping individuals on the Gang List \ncan lead to persons being labeled as criminal gang members for innocuous conduct, such as \n2 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 59   Filed 06/29/22   Page 3 of 15\nwearing certain clothes, visiting certain places, and associating with family and friends.  (Id. at 4-\n5.)  Plaintiffs allege that โmembers of the WPDโs Gang Unit are instructed to surveil community \nmembersโ social media accounts to find photographs of people with known gang membersโ and \nthat WPD โregularly monitors the social media accounts of community members to identify \nevidence that could be used to label individuals as gang members.โ  (Id. at 23-24.)  Additionally, \nplaintiffs allege that โsome WPD officers maintain fake social media profiles in order to befriend \nmembers of the community to more easily have access to photos and other information that would \nallow the officers to add more people to the Gang List.โ  (Id. at 24.)  Plaintiffs state that such \nsocial-media surveillance โprofoundly affect[s] how Plaintiffs interact with their friends and \nfamilies and move about the communityโ because they fear close proximity to certain people or \nplaces will lead the WPD to label them as gang members.  (Id. at 24, 32-34, 58.)  Likewise, they \nsay it has a chilling effect on their expression because wearing certain colors or sport-team clothing \nare criteria that lead to placement on the Gang List.  (Id. at 33, 51, 58, 60.)   \nOn January 27, 2022, plaintiffs served their First Requests for Production of Documents \n(โRFPsโ) on the City.  (ECF 32 & 52-2.)  In response, the City objected to producing two categories \nof documents: (1) documents responsive to RFPs 19, 20, and 23 โregarding [WPDโs] use of social \nmedia in criminal investigations and collection of criminal intelligenceโ; and (2) documents or ESI \nresponsive to RFP 36 โthat relate to the Mongols Motorcycle Gang.โ  (ECF 52, at 2-3.)  At the \npartiesโ request, the court convened a discovery conference on May 4 to discuss the partiesโ dispute \nover whether the City must produce the subject documents.  (ECF 51.)  The City asserted it was \nwithholding the documents under the law enforcement privilege, which is a qualified privilege that \nprotects confidential criminal intelligence and investigation materials.  After consultation with the \nparties, the court set the issue for motion practice.  (Id.)   \n3 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 59   Filed 06/29/22   Page 4 of 15\nThe City now moves for a protective order pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n26(b)(2)(C) allowing it to withhold information pursuant to the law enforcement privilege.  (ECF \n52.)  Plaintiffs oppose the motion, arguing the City has failed to follow the procedure required to \ninvoke the privilege and, even if the City had properly invoked the privilege, that plaintiffsโ need \nfor the information overrides the privilege.  (ECF 54.)   \nII.  LEGAL STANDARDS GOVERNING THE LAW ENFORCEMENT PRIVILEGE \n  Federal common law recognizes a qualified โlaw enforcement investigative privilege,โ \nwhich is โbased primarily on the harm to law enforcement efforts which might arise from public \ndisclosure of investigatory files.โ  United States v. Winner, 641 F.2d 825, 831 (10th Cir. 1981) \n(quotation omitted).  โIts purpose โis to prevent disclosure of law enforcement techniques and \nprocedures, to preserve the confidentiality of sources, to protect witness and law enforcement \npersonnel, to safeguard the privacy of individuals involved in an investigation and otherwise to \nprevent interference with an investigation.โโ  United States v. Malik, No. 15-CV-9092-CM, 2016 \nWL 3167307, at *10 (D. Kan. June 7, 2016) (quoting Natโl Union Fire Ins. Co. v. F.D.I.C., No. \n93-2471-GTV, 1995 WL 104835, at *1 (D. Kan. Mar. 7, 1995), which in turn quoted In re Depโt \nof Investigation, 856 F.2d 481, 483-84 (2d Cir. 1988)); Estate of Lillis v. Bd. of Cnty. Commโrs, \nNo. 16-CV-03038-KLM, 2019 WL 3416268, at *2 (D. Colo. July 29, 2019) (same). \n  โTo assert the privilege, โthe responsible official in the department must lodge a formal \nclaim of privilege, after actual personal consideration, specifying with particularity the information \nfor which protection is sought, and explain why the information falls within the scope of the \nprivilege.โโ  Malik, 2016 WL 3167307, at *10 (quoting Winner, 641 F.2d at 831); Natโl Union \nFire Ins. Co., 1995 WL 104835, at *1 (same).  This requirement โmust be strictly adhered to.โ  \nWinner, 641 F.2d at 831.  โGeneral allegations that information is protected from disclosure are \n4 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 59   Filed 06/29/22   Page 5 of 15\nnot sufficient.โ  Callahan v. Unified Govโt., No. 11-2621-KHV, 2013 WL 2151579, at *4 (D. Kan. \nMay 16, 2013). \n  Because the law enforcement privilege is a qualified privilege, it โmay be overridden by [a \npartyโs] substantial need for the documents and its inability to obtain their substantial equivalent \nby other means.โ  Lillis, 2019 WL 3416268, at *2 (quoting In re M & L Bus. Mach. Co., Inc., 161 \nB.R. 689, 693 (D. Colo. 1993)).  This involves โweighing the competing interests.โ  Natโl Union \nFire Ins. Co., 1995 WL 104835, at *4 (quoting In re Sealed Case, 856 F.2d 268, 272 (D.C. Cir. \n1988)).  โThe privilege โcan be overcome if there is a compelling need for the information that \noutweighs the need for confidentiality.โโ  Id. (quoting In re Telecomms., Inc. Sec. Litig., 799 F. \nSupp.  1206,  1208  (D.D.C.  1992));  see  also  Malik,  2016  WL  3167307,  at  *10  (โThe  law \nenforcement privilege is a qualified privilege, and thus can be overcome if the party seeking the \ninformation establishes โa compelling need for the information that outweighs the need for \nconfidentiality.โโ (quoting Natโl Union Fire Ins. Co., 1995 WL 104835, at *4)).  โThe party \nseeking documents protected by the law enforcement privilege has the burden to establish a need \nfor the documents.โ  Natโl Union Fire Ins. Co., 1995 WL 104835, at *4 (citing Collins v. \nShearson/Am. Express, Inc., 112 F.R.D. 227, 228 (D.D.C. 1986)).  Relevance alone does not \nestablish need.  Id. \nIII.  THE CITY HAS NOT PROPERLY INVOKED THE PRIVILEGE \n  As noted above, the Tenth Circuit in United States v. Winner set forth what is required to \nassert the law enforcement privilege: โthe responsible official in the department must lodge a \nformal claim of privilege, after actual personal consideration, specifying with particularity the \ninformation for which protection is sought, and explain why the information falls within the scope \nof the privilege.โ  641 F.2d at 831.  In National Union Fire Insurance Co. v. F.D.I.C., U.S. \n5 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 59   Filed 06/29/22   Page 6 of 15\nMagistrate Judge Gerald Rushfelt ruled that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (โFDICโ) \nproperly invoked the privilege by submitting a declaration from its regional counsel stating that he \nexercised personal consideration in invoking the privilege and that the agency had given him \nauthority to invoke the privilege, and he described five categories of documents being withheld \nโin sufficient detail to enable the court to establish a link between the nature of the documents and \nthe interference with a pending investigation.โ  1995 WL 104835, at *4.  By comparison, in \nCallahan v. Unified Government, U.S. Magistrate Judge Karen M. Humphreys determined that, at \na minimum, the party invoking the privilege โmust provide a privilege logโ in support.  2013 WL \n2151579, at *4.  Both approaches conform with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(5)(A)โs \nmandate that โ[w]hen a party withholds information otherwise discoverable by claiming that the \ninformation  is  privileged  .  .  .  the  party  must  .  .  .  describe  the  nature  of  the  documents, \ncommunications, or tangible things not produced or disclosedโand do so in a manner that, without \nrevealing information itself privileged . . . will enable other parties to assess the claim.โ    \n  Here, the City has not even minimally met Winnerโs invocation requirement.  The City has \nnot submitted a sworn declaration or affidavit of any โresponsible official in the departmentโ \nspecifying with particularity the information over which the privilege is asserted.  Nor has the City \nsubmitted a privilege log indicating documents it is withholding under the privilege.  Instead, the \nCity relies on a bare statement in its opening brief that it objected to RFPs 19, 20, 23, and 36 โafter \nconsultation with, and at the request of Lt. Chad Beard, supervisor of the Gang/Felony Assault \nSection & Crime Gun Intelligence Center.โ  (ECF 52, at 3.)  The brief states that โLt. Beard has \nbeen  the  primary  contact  for  defendantsโ  counsel  in  responding  to  plaintiffsโ  requests  for \nproduction and has repeatedly advised counsel of his objection to producing the materials over \nwhich privilege is asserted.โ  (Id.)  No matter how broadly the court were to interpret the \n6 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 59   Filed 06/29/22   Page 7 of 15\nrequirement of โlodg[ing] a formal claim of privilege,โ such a generalized statement in an unsworn \nlegal brief does not meet the requirements to assert the privilege as set forth in Winner.  The City \nhas therefore failed to properly assert the law enforcement privilege.   \nFirst, although Lt. Beard may be the correct WPD official to assert the privilege, he has not \nโlodged a formal claim of privilege.โ  And nothing in the record indicates he โpersonally \nconsideredโ whether particular documents responsive to plaintiffsโ discovery requests fall within \nthe scope of the privilege.  He has not explained, for example, why particular informationโor \neven what particular informationโshould be withheld to safeguard law enforcement efforts. \n  Second, even if the court were to accept the unsworn representations of counsel that Lt. \nBeard โadvised counsel of his objection to producing the materials over which privilege is \nasserted,โ the City has not provided enough detail about the materials for the court to determine \nthat they fall within the scope of the privilege.  The Cityโs brief broadly describes the withheld \ninformation as (1) โtraining and instruction documents pertaining to the use of social media for \nsurveillance of persons and the use of undercover social media accounts to do so,โ and (2) \ninformation about the actual โundercover use of social media for criminal investigation and \nsurveillance.โ  (ECF 52, at 3, 7.)  This description does not provide the court with enough \ninformation to find a link between documents being withheld and any pending investigation(s).  It \nlacks any explanation as to how disclosing the documents would โharm law enforcement efforts.โ  \nWinner, 641 F.2d at 831; see, e.g., Callahan, 2013 WL 2151579, at *4 (โgeneral allegationsโ that \ninformation is subject to the privilege are inadequate). \n  The Cityโs brief also includes the conclusory statement that it โcannot provide a privilege \nlog of its undercover use of social media without compromising its investigatory and intelligence \nefforts and assets.โ  (ECF 52 at 4.)  But again, these are simply hollow words unaccompanied by \n7 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 59   Filed 06/29/22   Page 8 of 15\nexplanation or support.  Surely it is common for a party to feel its privileged information is \nโcompromisedโ when it must reveal the types of high-level facts (such as the date of a document, \na general description of content, and length) required by a privilege log.  See In re Syngenta AG \nMIR 162 Corn Litig., No. 14-md-2591-JWL, 2017 WL 1106257, at *4-*5 (D. Kan. Mar. 24, 2017) \n(describing privilege-log requirements).  However, courts continue to require adherence to Rule \n26(b)(5)(A)โs description requirementsโbe it by production of a privilege log or by another \nmanner.  These requirements are necessary to enable both courts and other parties to assess the \nprivilege claim.  See Martley v. City of Basehor, No. 19-2138-DDC, 2021 WL 1210013, at *15 \n(D. Kan. Mar. 31, 2021).  In this case, the City has not even indicated the number of documents it \nis withholding, let alone any basic description of their nature that would allow the court or plaintiffs \nto assess whether the law enforcement privilege applies.1 \n  The City has failed to assert the law enforcement privilege by formally lodging its privilege \nclaim, specifying with particularity the information withheld, and explaining why the information \nfalls within the scope of the privilege.  The court therefore denies the Cityโs motion for a protective \norder on this basis because the invocation requirement โmust be strictly adhered toโ for the law \nenforcement privilege to apply.  Winner, 641 F.2d at 831.   \n \n  1 Plaintiffs note, for example, that it was their understanding from the Cityโs objection to \nRFP 23 and subsequent meet-and-confer discussions that no documents exist relating to any audit \nof the Gang Database other than the Standard Operating Procedure that the City already produced.  \n(See ECF 54-1.)  So plaintiffs were surprised that the Cityโs motion asserted privilege over \ndocuments responsive to this RFP.  (ECF 54 at 2.)  The City has given no indication at all of what \nresponsive documents it is withholding on privilege grounds.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 59   Filed 06/29/22   Page 9 of 15\nIV.  EVEN IF THE PRIVILEGE APPLIES, IT IS OVERCOME BY PLAINTIFFSโ \nSUBSTANTIAL NEED FOR THE INFORMATION \n \n  The court will also briefly address plaintiffsโ argument that their need for the requested \ninformation overrides any law enforcement privilege that applies.  This argument is well-taken.  \nAs the court discussed above, the law enforcement privilege is a qualified privilege that a party \nmay overcome by demonstrating a substantial need for the documents that outweighs the agencyโs \nneed for confidentiality.  See Lillis, 2019 WL 3416268, at *2; Natโl Union Fire Ins. Co., 1995 WL \n104835, at *4; Malik, 2016 WL 3167307, at *10.  Plaintiffs may demonstrate a substantial need \nfor the documents by showing that the documents are related to the โprincipal and material issues \nof the case,โ Natโl Union Fire Ins. Co., 1995 WL 104835, at *5, and that plaintiffs cannot โobtain \ntheir substantial equivalent by other means,โ Lillis, 2019 WL 3416268, at *2.  If plaintiffs establish \nthis need, then the court must weigh plaintiffsโ interests in the documents against the Cityโs \ninterests in non-disclosure.  Natโl Union Fire Ins. Co., 1995 WL 104835, at *4. \n  This case is unique in that the law enforcement agency asserting the privilege has not \nspecified the documents it is withholding based on its assertion of the privilege.  This places \nplaintiffs in the untenable position of demonstrating a need for documents about which they know \nvery little.  But, after reviewing the record, the court finds plaintiffs have demonstrated a \nsubstantial need for the two categories of documents over which the City asserts the privilege: (1) \ndocuments regarding the training, policies, procedures, or records of WPDโs social-media use in \ncollecting criminal intelligence, at least insofar as the documents relate to the Gang List, and (2) \ndocuments related to the Mongols Motorcycle Gang (โMongolsโ).    \n  First, the way in which WPD uses social media to determine whether a person should be \nplaced on, or remain on, the Gang List is central to plaintiffsโ constitutional claims.  As discussed \nabove, a main allegation in plaintiffsโ complaint is that WPD monitors community membersโ \n9 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 59   Filed 06/29/22   Page 10 of 15\nsocial media accounts to identify evidence that could be used to label individuals as gang members \nand, further, maintains fake social media profiles in order to befriend members of the community \nand gain access to photos and other information that allow officers to add people to the Gang List.  \nPlaintiffs allege that their innocuous conduct revealed on social mediaโsuch as wearing certain \nclothes, visiting certain places, and associating with certain peopleโleads WPD to place them on \nthe Gang List.  In just one of many examples, plaintiffs state that WPD added plaintiff Christopher \nCooper to the Gang List based on WPDโs surveillance of his Facebook account and pictures \nthereon showing him allegedly wearing โgang colorsโ and associating with โgang members.โ  \n(ECF 54 at 3.)  Plaintiffs state that, according to a document the City produced, WPD changed 24 \nindividualsโ status from โinactiveโ to โactiveโ on the Gang List based on such social media \nmonitoring in the past five years.  (Id.)   \n  WPDโs use of social media to place individuals on the Gang Listโallegedly without \nevidence of any criminal behavior and without notice to the individualsโis at the crux of \nplaintiffsโ claims challenging the constitutionality of ยง 21-6313, both facially and as applied by \nWPD.  Plaintiffsโ Fourteenth Amendment vagueness claim asserts that WPDโs application of \nยง 21-6313  via  Policy  527,  particularly  by  social  media  monitoring,  results  in  arbitrary  and \ndiscriminatory enforcement of the law.  (ECF 1, at 24, 43-44.)  Plaintiffsโ First Amendment claims \nsimilarly allege that WPDโs use of social-media surveillance to determine that an individual meets \na criterion for inclusion on the Gang List has a chilling effect on their constitutional rights of free \nexpression and association.  (Id. at 55-56, 58.)  And finally, plaintiffsโ due process claims allege \nthat WPD places individuals on the Gang List without their knowledge or a process for contesting \ninclusion.  (Id. at 45-52.)  Information about how WPD uses social media to place someone on the \nGang List is relevant to these claims.  Plaintiffs explain that โthe documents [the City] has \n10 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 59   Filed 06/29/22   Page 11 of 15\nproduced to date only prove that social media monitoring occurs.  The context and guiding \ndocuments showing how the WPD goes about its monitoring are crucialโ for plaintiffs to prove \ntheir constitutional claims.  (ECF 54 at 8.)  The court agrees. \n  The second category of documents at issue, those relating to the Mongols, appears to \noverlap the first category.  The court says โappearsโ because the City has not indicated, even \ngenerally, what Mongols-related documents it seeks to withhold under the law enforcement \nprivilege.  Rather, the Cityโs entire argument for application of the privilege states, โOther than \ndisclosing that law enforcement does conduct surveillance and intelligence operations regarding \nthe activities of the Mongols, it is unable to further disclose the nature of those activities without \ndisclosure of law enforcement techniques and procedures or otherwise interfering with law \nenforcement  intelligence and investigation activities.โ  (ECF 52, at 8-9.)  Understandably, then, \nplaintiffsโ argument that they have a substantial need for documents related to the Mongols is \nsparse.  But plaintiffs explain that previously produced documents show WPD used social media \nmonitoring to find Facebook posts by Mongols members and used those posts to support placing \nthe members on the Gang List.  Thus, to the extent the City is asserting the law enforcement \nprivilege over documents related to monitoring the social media accounts of Mongol members, the \ncourt finds the documents related to โthe principal and material issues of the caseโ for the same \nreasons laid out above. \n  In sum, plaintiffs have demonstrated that the categories of WPD documents the City is \nwithholding under the law enforcement privilege are central to the issues in this case, these \ndocuments are in the WPDโs possession, and they are not available to plaintiffs by other means.  \nAccordingly, the court finds plaintiffs have demonstrated a substantial need for the documents.  \n11 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 59   Filed 06/29/22   Page 12 of 15\nThe court therefore goes on to weigh plaintiffsโ interests in the documents against the Cityโs \ninterests in confidentiality. \n  As  analyzed  above,  plaintiffsโ  interest  in  the  documents  is  substantial  because  the \ndocuments go to the crux of the issues in the case, such that plaintiffsโ ability to succeed without \nthem would be undermined.  In contrast, the weight of the Cityโs interest in withholding the \ndocuments is unclear.  The City suggests that producing the documents would โcompromis[e] its \ninvestigatory  and  intelligence  efforts  and  assetsโ  and  โinterfere[e]  with  law  enforcement \nintelligence and investigation activities.โ  (ECF 52, at 4, 8.)  But the City does not elaborate on \nthese broad statements.  The City has not, for example, โexplained the negative impact on law \nenforcement activities that would result from disclosure of this information.โ  United States v. \nMalik, No. 15-9092-CM, 2016 WL 3167307, at *11 (D. Kan. June 7, 2016) (holding an FBI \nSection  Chiefโs  declaration  adequately  explained  the  FBIโs  interest  in  keeping  a  document \nconfidential  and  that  the  interest  was  not  overcome  by  opposing  partyโs  demonstration  of \nsubstantial need).  Nor has the City, for example, offered any cogent explanation regarding the \nextent of the alleged potential interference with WPDโs intelligence efforts.  To that extent, \nplaintiffs point out that the Protective Order contains an โattorneysโ eyes onlyโ provision.  (See \nECF 41, at 4 (โConfidential documents containing highly sensitive or confidential information the \ndisclosure of which to another party would pose a risk of serious physical injury to . . . persons \n(whether parties or non-parties), or harm to the defendantโs investigative and enforcement efforts \nmay be further designated โATTORNEYSโ EYES ONLY.โโ (emphasis added)).)  Although this \nprovision may not be enough to overcome the privilege, it does call into question the Cityโs \nassertion that producing the documents would harm law enforcement efforts.  Given all of these \n12 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 59   Filed 06/29/22   Page 13 of 15\nconsiderations, the court can find no valid reason to attribute much weight to the Cityโs conclusory \nassertion regarding its interest in protecting the documents. \n  In weighing the partiesโ competing interests, the court finds that plaintiffsโ substantial need \nfor the withheld documents in order to properly support their constitutional claims overcomes any \ninterest the City may have in not disclosing the documents under the protective order.  Thus, even \nif the court were to find that the City properly invoked the law enforcement privilege, the court \nwould find that plaintiffs have overcome the qualified privilege and therefore deny the Cityโs \nrequest for a protective order on this basis.   \n V.  THE CITYโS OTHER, BOILERPLATE OBJECTIONS ALSO FAIL TO SUPPORT \n  ENTRY OF A PROTECTIVE ORDER \n \n  The bulk of the Cityโs request for a protective order focuses on its assertion of the law \nenforcement privilege.  But the City also relies on boilerplate objections of overbreadth, relevance, \nand proportionality in arguing the motion.  In all but one instance, the Cityโs statements in this \nregard are wholly conclusive and not supported by argument or authority.  See ECF 52, at 3 (โโFor \nRequest No. 36, Plaintiffs have not narrowed their request to any degree.โ), 5 (โFurther, the \nrequested information is either not relevant to the claims or defenses in this case or is not \nproportional to the needs of the case.โ), and 8 (โDefendant first asserts an overbreadth objection \nto [RFP 36.] . . .  Plaintiffs have not refined or narrowed the request in any respect.โ).  Such \nconclusory statements are insufficient to support the Cityโs request for a protective order.  See \nEnsminger v. Credit L. Ctr., LLC, No. 19-2147-JWL, 2019 WL 6327421, at *2 (D. Kan. Nov. 26, \n2019) (party moving for a protective order โmust show a particular and specific demonstration of \nfact, as distinguished from stereotyped and conclusory statementsโ (internal quotation and citation \nomitted)). \n13 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 59   Filed 06/29/22   Page 14 of 15\n  The lone exception is the Cityโs overbreadth objection to RFP 19, which sought documents \nregarding โsocial media tracking or monitoring by the Gang Unit or any other departments, units, \nor divisions of the Wichita Police Department.โ  (ECF 52-2, at 12 (emphasis added).)  The City \nargues the use of social media by other units within the WPD would encompass the investigation \nof โsex crimes and human trafficking and those looking for fugitives or persons with active \nwarrantsโ and โis beyond the scope of discovery directed at defendantโs Gang Database.โ  (ECF \n52, at 7.)  Plaintiffs concede that RFP 19 is overbroad in that it could be construed to require the \nproduction of โinformation regarding sex crimes or human trafficking,โ but plaintiffs assert this \nargument is a โred herringโ and plaintiffs โdid not even know that the WPD used social media \nsurveillance in that respect.โ  (ECF 54, at 10 n.2.)  Plaintiffs suggest that the City โis best positioned \nto propose any limitations of productionโ responsive to this RFP.  (Id.)  The court agrees.  It is \napparent that the parties have not adequately met and conferred in an attempt to narrow the scope \nof RFP 19, so this issue is premature.  See FED. R. CIV. P. 26(c)(1) (requiring good-faith conferral); \nD. Kan. Rule 37.2 (same); see also ECF 52, at 1 (certifying the parties โmet and conferred on \nThursday, April 21, 2022โ) and ECF 54-1, at 1 (summarizing the partiesโ April 21 conversation \nabout RFP 19 only as โno responsive documents have yet been producedโ).     \n  The City has not shown good cause for the entry of a protective order based on its \nboilerplate, unsupported objections.  The Cityโs motion for a protective order on this basis also is \ndenied. \n  IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Cityโs Motion for Protective Order (ECF 52) \nis denied. \n14 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 59   Filed 06/29/22   Page 15 of 15\n  IT IS SO ORDERED. \nDated June 29, 2022, at Kansas City, Kansas.   \n                s/ Angel D.

Broadly speaking, they seek relief from Defendant City \nof Wichitaโs โGang List,โ along with the statutes and local policies that enable it.  The Gang List \nis purportedly a list of persons, created and maintained by the Wichita Police Department \n(โWPDโ), whom WPD personnel have determined meet the definition of a โcriminal street gang \nmemberโ under the criteria set out in K.S.A. ยง 21-6313(b).  The individual Plaintiffs allege they \nwere wrongfully designated as โcriminal street gang member[s]โ and added to the Gang List, \nwhich has negatively affected their lives in a host of ways.  Plaintiffs seek (1) certification as a \nclass under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2); (2) a declaration that K.S.A. ยง 21-6313 is \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 28   Filed 01/10/22   Page 2 of 39\nunconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments; (3) a declaration that Defendants \nCity of Wichita, Chief Gordan Ramsey in his official capacity as Chief of the WPD, and Lieutenant \nChad Beard in his official capacity as supervisor of the Gang Unit of the WPD, violated their First \nand Fourteenth Amendment rights through their policies, practices, and conduct related to the \nGang List; and (4) both preliminary and permanent injunctive relief effectively dismantling the \nGang List.  Defendants now move to dismiss this action, alleging that Plaintiffs do not have \nstanding to seek this relief under Article III of the United States Constitution, and that Plaintiffs \nfail to state plausible claims for relief.  The Court finds that Plaintiffs do have standing, but because \nsome of the proposed legal theories rest on constitutionally infirm ground, the Court grants in part \nand denies in part Defendantsโ Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 14).  \nI.  Factual and Procedural Background1 \nAt the heart of this constitutional quagmire is a relatively brief definitional statute.  K.S.A. \nยง 21-6313 defines several terms relevant to criminal gangs, including a definition of a โcriminal \nstreet gangโ2 and โcriminal street gang activity.โ3  But for present purposes, the most important \npart of ยง 21-6313 are its definitions of โcriminal street gang memberโ and โcriminal street gang \nassociate.โ4  A โcriminal street gang memberโ is a person who either admits to their membership \n \n1 The following facts, assumed to be true for the purposes of this Order, are taken from Plaintiffsโ Complaint \nand Exhibit A attached thereto.  Though normally the Court only considers the plaintiffโs complaint in ruling on a \nmotion to dismiss, the Court may consider documents of undisputed authenticity that are โcentral to the complaint.โ \nDunmars v. Ford Cnty., Kan. Bd. of Commโrs, 2019 WL 3817958, at *3 (D. Kan. 2019) (citations omitted).  The \nauthenticity of Exhibit A is not disputed by the parties and it is central to Plaintiffsโ claims, as it represents at least \npart of the challenged policy on which Plaintiffsโ claims rest.  \n2 K.S.A. ยง 21-6313(a). \n3 Id. ยง 21-6313(c).  \n4 Id. ยง 21-6313(b), (d).  \n-2- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 28   Filed 01/10/22   Page 3 of 39\nin a gang or meets three of the following statutory criteria, while a โcriminal street gang associateโ \nneed only meet two: \n(A) Is identified as a criminal street gang member by a parent or guardian; \n(B) is identified as a criminal street gang member by a state, county or city law \nenforcement officer or correctional officer or documented reliable informant; \n(C) is identified as a criminal street gang member by an informant of previously \nuntested  reliability  and  such  identification  is  corroborated  by  independent \ninformation; \n(D) frequents a particular criminal street gangโs area; \n(E) adopts such gangโs style of dress, color, use of hand signs or tattoos; \n(F) associates with known criminal street gang members; \n(G) has been arrested more than once in the company of identified criminal street \ngang members for offenses which are consistent with usual criminal street gang \nactivity; \n(H) is identified as a criminal street gang member by physical evidence including, \nbut not limited to, photographs or other documentation; \n(I) has been stopped in the company of known criminal street gang members two \nor more times; or \n(J) has participated in or undergone activities self-identified or identified by a \nreliable informant as a criminal street gang initiation ritual;5 \nThe various definitions of ยง 21-6313 are relevant internally to that statute, as several of the criteria \nlaid out above rely on those definitions, but they are also relevant to subsequent statutory sections.  \nFor example, K.S.A. ยง 21-6316 sets a minimum bail of $50,000 for โcriminal street gang membersโ \narrested for a person felony, subject to a few exceptions.6 \nWPD policy puts ยง 21-6313 into practice on the streets of Wichita.  Specifically, Policy \n527 defines the procedures for an individualโs inclusion on the Gang List.  โAny state, county, or \ncity law enforcement officer or correctional officer may nominateโ an individual for inclusion on \nthe Gang List.7  After this nomination, the individual will be added to the Gang List if they meet \n \n5 Id. ยง21-6313(b)(2)(A)โ(J).  \n6 K.S.A. ยง 21-6316.  \n7 Pls.โ Compl.

Once on the Gang List, Policy 527 provides that the individual will \nremain on either โactiveโ or โassociateโ status for a minimum of three years.8  If, after three years, \nthe individual has not engaged in documented criminal street gang activity, the individual will be \ndesignated โinactiveโ in the Gang List.9  But this three-year period starts over if an officer \ndocuments that the individual either meets the criteria set out in ยง 21-6313(b) or that the individual \nhas been involved in criminal street gang activity or a gang-related incident, as defined by the \nstatute.  Officers of the WPD monitor members of the Gang List for any violations of probation \nconditions, bond, and pretrial restrictions.  Policy 527 further specifies that the Gang List is \nconfidential and will only be released to commissioned law enforcement or correctional officers, \nalong with those persons or entities authorized to receive Gang List information by various high-\nlevel supervisors within the WPD.  \nPlaintiffs allege that both ยง 21-6313 and Policy 527 are problematic by their own terms.  \nFor instance, Plaintiffs complain that ยง 21-6313 and Policy 527 largely have no requirements that \nan individual receive notice that their name has been added to the Gang List, and even if they are \naware of it, the WPD provides no procedures by which the individual could challenge such \ndesignation.10  Further, Plaintiffs believe that the criteria laid out in ยง 21-6313(b), on which Policy \n527 relies, can lead to persons being labeled as criminal gang members for otherwise innocuous \nconduct such as what they wear, the places they visit, and for associating with family and friends.  \nIndeed, Plaintiffs go on to say that because of these expansive criteria, โthe majority of Wichita \ncitizens, including most judges, lawyers, clergy, union members, and other professional and social \n \n8 Id. at 3.  \n9 Id.  \n10 Plaintiffs concede that Policy 527 does provide for notice when the individual in question is a juvenile.  \n-4- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 28   Filed 01/10/22   Page 5 of 39\nservices providers, could be discretionally designated as a gang member or associate and added to \nthe Gang List.โ11  Once on the Gang List, Policy 527 does not provide an opportunity for an \nindividual to leave the Gang List entirely.  Rather, the individual simply may be labeled โinactiveโ \nwith no clear definition of what this designation means.12  And though Policy 527 provides that \nthe Gang List should remain confidential, it allows certain high-level members of the WPD to \nshare the list at their discretion, which Plaintiffs allege occurs with some frequency. Plaintiffs \nbelieve the list is shared with other local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies, as well as \npotential employers, landlords, and licensing agents of those persons on the Gang List.  \nEven beyond the explicit terms of ยง 21-6313 and Policy 527, Plaintiffs believe that each \npermits conduct by police officers that is largely unchecked and extends beyond the pale in a \nvariety of ways.  According to Plaintiffs, WPD officers have nearly unlimited discretion in \ndetermining whether an individual meets the criteria of ยง 21-6313(b), and thus whether to add that \nindividual to the Gang List.  Plaintiffs believe that the WPD has a practice of falsely reporting that \nan individual admitted to criminal street gang membership and will perform hostile and intrusive \ntraffic  stops  with  individuals  on  the  Gang  List,  in-person  and  online  surveillance  of  such \nindividuals, and searches of the individualโs person and property.  Plaintiffs allege that all of these \nWPD actions affect persons of color on the Gang List more so than white persons, as WPD officers \nmake less of an effort to surveil or stop white persons on the Gang List.  Plaintiffs further suggest \nthat the demographic make-up of the Gang List is itself indicative of unchecked officer discretion \nand discrimination.

Plaintiff Christopher Cooper first learned he was on the Gang List in 2014 \nwhen he was arrested for first degree murder, though he denies he was a gang member at that or \nany other time.  His bail was set at $50,000, which he attributes to the requirements of ยง 21-6316.14  \nCooper accepted a plea deal and at sentencing was placed on probation with special gang-related \nconditions.  He alleges these conditions forced him to live away from his family because some of \nthem were on the Gang List.  Cooper states that though he has not had any criminal charges or \noffenses since 2014, he has repeatedly been stopped for minor traffic infractions and harassed by \nWPD officers, who know his name and treat him like a criminal during these interactions.  These \ninteractions ceased when Cooper began driving a car registered in the name of a family member.  \nRecently, Cooper applied for a new job, but after a background check, was rejected.  Cooper \nbelieves he was rejected because the background check identified him as an active gang member.  \nPlaintiff Elbert Costello first learned he was on the Gang List in 1997, when he was arrested \nin connection with a shooting.  He states that, though he had relatives involved with gangs, he has \nnever been a gang member.

Both during and following his supervised release, \nElbert alleges he has been subject to increased surveillance and traffic stops by WPD officers, \nwhich were often for minor traffic violations but led to invasive questioning.  Elbert alleges he has \navoided spending time with lifelong friends because they may also be on the Gang List and \nassociating with each other can lead โinactiveโ designations to become โactiveโ or can renew the \nthree-year clock for already โactiveโ Gang List designations.  He further alleges he has avoided \ncertain businesses because he believes the WPD has identified them as โgang hideouts.โ16  Still, \nthese precautions have apparently not been enough, as Elbert has repeatedly been renewed as \nโactiveโ on the Gang List, often for photos or other instances of him associating with others on the \nGang List.  Most recently, Elbert was renewed because he appeared in a social media photo \nwearing a red โPhiladelphia Philliesโ baseball cap, and because the color red is associated with a \ngang.   \nPlaintiff Martel Costello believes he was first added to the Gang List in 2016 because of \nhis association with relatives, presumably also members of the Gang List, rather than any conduct \non his part.  Around that time, Martel was arrested for drug and firearm offenses.  He was released \npending trial after posting bond, which he believes was set high because of his Gang List \ndesignation.  During his pretrial release, Martel alleges he was stopped and harassed numerous \ntimes by WPD officers for minor traffic infractions.  Martel ultimately pled guilty and received a \nsentence of 18 monthsโ probation, subject to a condition that he not associate with anyone else on \n \n15 Pls.โ Compl., Doc. 1, at ยถ 128.  \n16 Id. at ยถ 136.  \n-7- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 28   Filed 01/10/22   Page 8 of 39\nthe Gang List.  This condition proved troublesome for Martel.  On two separate occasions, Martel \nwas attending funeral services for a family member when he was found to have violated his parole \nbecause also in attendance were family members on the Gang List.  Martel is incarcerated for these \nviolations until at least 2023.  \nPlaintiff Jeremy Levy, Jr., believes he was added to the Gang List at 13 years old when he \nwas pulled over by the WPD while riding in a car with one of his cousins, who was already on the \nGang List.  Levy states that he was not a gang member at that or any other time.  Five years later, \nLevy was charged with first-degree felony murder.  During his trial, the prosecutor was allowed \nto introduce evidence of Levyโs gang membership, based on the Gang List, and other gang-related \nincidents that Levy believes were irrelevant and extremely prejudicial.  Levy was convicted and is \ncurrently incarcerated until at least 2042. \nRounding out the named Plaintiffs, Progeny joins this case from a position distinct from \nthe individuals discussed above.  Progeny is nonprofit organization in Wichita, Kansas, that \noperates โas a youth/adult partnership focused on reimagining the juvenile justice system and \nreinventing in community-based alternatives.โ17  Its goals are to โprevent the incarceration of \nyoung people, break the school-to-prison pipeline, and direct state funds into community-based \nprograms that provide alternatives to incarceration.โ18  As an organization, obviously Progeny is \nnot an active gang member on the Gang List.  But Progeny still alleges that the Gang List has \ncaused it direct harm and has harmed its members.  Progeny alleges that some of its members are \non the Gang List, and that the Gang List has caused it to divert resources away from its other work \n \n17 Id. at ยถ 32.  \n18 Id. at ยถ 33.  \n-8- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 28   Filed 01/10/22   Page 9 of 39\nto provide services to those on the Gang List.  Progeny states that, because ยง 21-6313 and Policy \n527 list โassociat[ing] with known criminal street gang membersโ as one of the criteria for being \ndesignated or renewed as a โcriminal street gang member,โ it is strongly discouraged from hosting \ntown halls or meetings of any kind, as it might result in even more people being added to the Gang \nList.  When an individualโs Gang List designation is known, Progeny believes ยง 21-6313 and \nPolicy 527 effectively prohibit it from providing services to those individuals, as doing so may \nresult in Gang List designations for those Progeny members working with that afflicted individual.  \nTogether, these named Plaintiffs bring a putative class action against the City of Wichita, \nWPD Chief Gordon Ramsey, and WPD Gang Unit Supervisor, Lieutenant Chad Beard, both in \ntheir official capacities.  Plaintiffs allege that ยง 21-6313 and Defendantsโ policies and practices \nhave violated their rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution.  They seek certification as a class under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), and injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief.  Defendants move to dismiss, under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), on \nthe grounds that (1) Plaintiffs do not have standing to seek the relief requested, and (2) Plaintiffs \nfail to state a plausible claim for relief. \nII.  Legal Standard \nA.  Lack of Subject-Matter Jurisdiction \nโFederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction; they are empowered to hear only those \ncases authorized and defined in the Constitution which have been entrusted to them under a \njurisdictional grant by Congress.โ19  A standing challenge is an attack on the Courtโs subject matter \n \n19 Henry v. Off. of Thrift Supervision, 43 F.3d 507, 511 (10th Cir. 1994) (citations omitted). \n-9- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 28   Filed 01/10/22   Page 10 of 39\njurisdiction and is analyzed under Rule (12)(b)(1).20  Rule 12(b)(1) motions come in two types: (1) \na facial attack on the sufficiency of complaintโs allegations as to the courtโs jurisdiction or (2) a \nfactual attack on the facts upon which subject matter is based.21  This case involves a facial attack,22 \nand therefore, the Court must view the factual allegations in the Complaint as true but viewed \nthrough the Iqbal/Twombly plausibility standard, cited below.23  The burden of proof is on the \nparty asserting the Court has jurisdiction.24 \nB.  Failure to State a Claim \nUnder Rule 12(b)(6), a defendant may move for dismissal of any claim for which the \nplaintiff has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.25  Upon such motion, the \ncourt must decide โwhether the complaint contains โenough facts to state a claim to relief that is \nplausible on its face.โ โ26  A claim is facially plausible if the plaintiff pleads facts sufficient for the \ncourt to reasonably infer that the defendant is liable for the alleged misconduct.27  The plausibility \nstandard reflects the requirement in Rule 8 that pleadings provide defendants with fair notice of \n \n20 Hill v. Vanderbilt Cap. Advisors, LLC, 702 F.3d 1220, 1224 (10th Cir. 2012) (โOur court has repeatedly \ncharacterized standing as an element of subject matter jurisdiction.โ). \n21 Stuart v. Colo. Interstate Gas Co., 271 F.3d 1221, 1225 (10th Cir. 2001) (citations omitted).  \n22 The Court notes that Defendants are not explicitly clear about which type of attack they intend to bring.  \nBut after reviewing their arguments on standing, the Court finds they do not challenge the factual basis of Plaintiffโs \nstanding.  This case thus necessarily involves a facial attack.  \n23 See Stuart, 271 F.3d at 1225 (โIn reviewing a facial attack, the district court must accept the allegations in \nthe complaint as true.โ) (citation omitted).  \n24 Kokkonen v.

Analysis \n  Plaintiffs challenge ยง 21-6313 and Defendantsโ policies and practices on a number of \nconstitutional grounds.  Under the Fourteenth Amendment, Plaintiffs contend that (1) ยง 21-6313 \nis void for vagueness, (2) Defendants have failed to provide Plaintiffs with procedural due process, \n(3) Defendants have failed to provide Plaintiffs with substantive due process, and (4) Defendants \nhave violated Plaintiffsโ rights to equal protection under the law.  Under the First Amendment, \nPlaintiffs contend that ยง 21-6313 and Policy 527 violate Plaintiffsโ rights of freedom of expression \nand association, both by a direct prohibition and a chilling effect on the same.  Defendants move \nto dismiss on the grounds that (1) no named Plaintiff has Article III standing to bring the \naforementioned claims, (2) Plaintiffsโ constitutional claims fail to state a plausible claim for relief, \n(3) the claims against Chief Ramsey and Lieutenant Beard are redundant, and (4) the City of \nWichita may not be held liable under Monell v. New York City Department of Social Services.31  \nThe Court examines each line of argument in turn.  \n \n28 See Robbins v. Oklahoma, 519 F.3d 1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2008) (citations omitted); see also Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 8(a)(2). \n29 Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. \n30 See id. (โThe plausibility standard is not akin to a โprobability requirement,โ but it asks for more than a \nsheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.โ) (citation omitted). \n31 436 U.S. 658 (1978). \n-11- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 28   Filed 01/10/22   Page 12 of 39\nAt the outset, the Court notes that Plaintiffs bring their constitutional claims under 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 1983.  That statute permits persons to sue those who violate their constitutional rights \nwhile acting โunder color ofโ state law.32  At this stage, other than its argument under Monell, \nDefendants do not dispute the propriety of ยง 1983 as a vehicle for Plaintiffsโ constitutional claims \nagainst them. The Court thus focuses on the constitutional standards underlying each claim.  \nA.   Article III Standing   \n  1.  Individual Plaintiffsโ Standing \n  The doctrine of standing follows from the clear language of Article III of the United States \nConstitution, which states that the โjudicial power of the United Statesโ extends only to โCasesโ \nand  โControversies.โ33    The  Supreme  Court  has  interpreted  this  to  require  an  โirreducible \nconstitutional minimumโ of three elements before a plaintiffโs suit can proceed in federal court.34  \nโThe plaintiff must have (1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged \nconduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.โ35  \nDefendants focus somewhat interchangeably on the first and second elements in their motion to \ndismiss, but the Court believes it is first necessary to discuss Plaintiffsโ alleged injury in fact with \nprecision.  \nTo demonstrate an injury in fact, a plaintiff must establish he or she โsuffered โan invasion \nof a legally protected interestโ that is โconcrete and particularizedโ and โactual or imminent, not \n \n32 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.

Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 338 (2016) (citations omitted).  \n-12- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 28   Filed 01/10/22   Page 13 of 39\nconjectural or hypothetical.โ โ36  A โconcreteโ injury โmust actually exist,โ while a particularized \ninjury โmust affect the plaintiff in a personal and individual way.โ37  At this stage, Defendants \ncontend that Plaintiffsโ alleged injuries are either merely hypothetical or are insufficient to confer \nstanding for the prospective relief sought.  \n Crucially for this case, the injury in fact required is different when the plaintiff seeks \npurely prospective relief.  While a plaintiffโs โstanding for retrospective relief may be based on \npast injuries . . . claims for prospective relief require a continuing injuryโ or a credible threat of \nimminent future harm.38  This is because โ[p]ast exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show \na present case or controversy regarding injunctive relief . . .  if unaccompanied by any continuing, \npresent adverse effects.โ39  Similarly, a plaintiff seeking relief from the alleged chilling effect of a \nstatute or policy must allege more than mere subjective chill;40 rather, they must โshow[] a credible \nthreat of prosecution or other consequences following from the statuteโs enforcement.โ41  Plaintiffs \nsolely seek injunctive and declaratory relief: in other words, prospective relief.  Thus, to establish \nstanding to seek this relief, Plaintiffs must show a continuing injury or that they are under a credible \nthreat of future harm.   \nPlaintiffs plausibly allege they suffer from continuing injuries.  Plaintiffs allege that their \ndesignation as โcriminal street gang membersโ on WPDโs Gang List is itself an ongoing injury \nbecause  of  the  constitutional  deprivations  that,  in  their  view,  inevitably  follow  from  such \n \n36 Id. at 339 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560).  \n37 Id. at 339โ40 (citations omitted).  \n38 PeTA v.

They further allege that their First Amendment rights are being \nviolated, again on a continuing basis, because ยง 21-6313 and Policy 527 directly restrict their \nfreedoms of expression and association in that they cannot engage in expressive conduct or \nassociate with family and close friends without the risk that their designation as a gang member \nwill be extended or that their family and friends will be similarly designated.  These restrictions \nextend as long as the Gang List and ยง 21-6313 endure.  \nPlaintiffs also allege that they, in choosing to engage in certain types of expression or \nassociate with certain persons, face a credible threat of real and immediate consequences from \nยง 21-6313 and the Gang List.  A person can be added to the Gang List based, at least in part, on \ntheir โstyle of dress, color [of clothes], use of hand signs or tattoosโ as well as their associations \nwith family and friends who happen to be on the Gang List.  Plaintiffs further allege a number of \nconsequences that flow directly from being on the Gang List, such as those described above.  Thus, \na person by his choices in the way he dresses, or his associations with family and friends, faces a \ncredible threat that he may be added to the Gang List and then must confront the real, immediate \nconsequences of that designation.  \nThese allegations alone are sufficient to distinguish this case from City of Los Angeles v. \nLyons,43 on which Defendants rely.  In Lyons, the Supreme Court concluded the plaintiff, who had \n \n42 Importantly, โ[f]or purposes of the standing inquiry, the question is not whether the alleged injury rises to \nthe level of a constitutional violation. That is the issue on the merits.โ  Initiative & Referendum Inst. v. Walker, 450 \nF.3d 1082, 1088 (10th Cir. 2006).  \n43 461 U.S. 95 (1983).  \n-14- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 28   Filed 01/10/22   Page 15 of 39\nin the past had been subjected to a police chokehold during a traffic stop, did not have standing to \nseek an injunction against the City preventing the use of such chokeholds.44  The Court stated that \nthe plaintiffโs โstanding to seek the injunction requested depended on whether he was likely to \nsuffer future injury from the use of the chokeholds by police officers,โ and found that there was \nno real and immediate threat of such injury.45  Based on this, Defendants attack Plaintiffsโ \nallegations of what they view as โpast injuries,โ such as restrictive probation conditions and high \nbonds in past criminal cases, and past stops by law enforcement viewed as harassing by Plaintiffs.   \nWhile it is true that these past injuries, standing alone, cannot support a request for purely \nprospective relief, Plaintiffs do not solely allege past injuries.  Rather, as discussed, Plaintiffs \nallege a number of continuing injuries and credible future injuries as a direct result of ยง 21-6313 \nand Gang List.  Plaintiffs allege continuing restrictions to their speech and expression and \nstigmatizing designations as gang members that will continue so long as do ยง 21-6313 and the \nGang List.  They also allege a credible threat of consequences if they engage in certain types of \nexpression or association.  For that reason, Plaintiffs have properly alleged injuries in fact \nsufficient to seek prospective and declaratory relief.  \n  Moving to the second element of standing, Defendant contends that a number of Plaintiffsโ \nalleged injuries are not fairly traceable to its conduct.  These include bond decisions, employment \nrejections, designation of custodial facilities, and other decisions that lie with parties not before \nthis Court.  This would be a relevant and even persuasive argument if those were the challenged \ninjuries in this action.  But as this Court discussed above, Plaintiffs allege their injury is the \n \n44 Id. at 98, 105.  \n45 Id. at 105 \n-15- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 28   Filed 01/10/22   Page 16 of 39\ndesignation itself as gang members in the Gang List, not solely the past criminal consequences of \nthat designation.  Looking at the Gang List designation as each Plaintiffโs injury in fact, along with \nthe continuing constitutional violations that Plaintiffs allege as a result of that designation, it is \nclear these are fairly traceable to Defendants, who maintain and control the Gang List.  \nFinally, it is immediately clear that the third element of standing is also met for the \nindividual, named Plaintiffs.  Their injuries can be redressed by a favorable decision here, as \ninjunctive and declaratory relief could remove them from the Gang List and dismantle it, along \nwith the statutes and policies that give life to the list.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs have standing to seek \nthe prospective relief requested.  \n  2.   Progenyโs Standing \nProgeny contends it has standing both directly to seek redress for an injury in fact it has \nsuffered as a result of the Gang List, as well as standing as an association to seek relief on behalf \nof its members.  The Court examines each in turn.   \nAn organization must meet the same three-part test applicable to individuals to have \nstanding to sue on its own behalf.46  That is, the organization โmust have (1) suffered an injury in \nfact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to \nbe redressed by a favorable judicial decision.โ47  Defendants dispute only the first of these \nelements, contending that Progeny has not suffered an injury in fact sufficient to give it a โpersonal \nstake in the outcomeโ 48 of this litigation.  \n \n46 Colo.

Progeny itself states that one of its goals is to โempower young people who have \ncome into contact with the criminal justice system and provide these young people with counseling \nand support.โ53  Providing assistance and resources to individuals beleaguered by the criminal \njustice system is then part of Progenyโs ordinary operations.  It does not matter that these problems \nwithin the criminal justice system are amplified, at least in part, by the personโs designation as a \ngang member.  Spending resources to assist these individuals remains within the ordinary purpose \nof Progeny, and thus such expenditures are ordinary as well.  This is not an injury in fact sufficient \nto confer standing.  \n \n49 Pls.โ Compl., Doc. 1, at ยถ 36.  \n50 Havens Realty Corp., 455 U.S. at 379. \n51 Animal Legal Def. Fund v. Kelly, 434 F.

Like the individual \nPlaintiffs, Progeny alleges its First Amendment rights have been violated by ยง 21-6313 and \nDefendantsโ  related  policies.    Nonprofit  organizations  are  also  protected  by  the  First \nAmendment,54  but at this stage the Court does not ask whether Progenyโs alleged injury rises to \nthe level of a constitutional violation.55  Rather, the Court asks, as before, whether Progeny has \nsufficiently alleged a continuing injury that is concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent.   \nProgenyโs alleged First Amendment injuries fit that bill.  Progeny suggests a clear and \nplausible injury to its right of association owing to the statutory criteria, and attendant WPD policy, \nthat a person may be added to the Gang List simply by associating with the other persons already \non the list.  Because of this, Progeny alleges it is effectively prohibited from hosting town halls or \nother large-scale meetings because of the risk that persons already on the Gang List will be in \nattendance and cause other attendees to either be added to the Gang List or have their designation \nextended, and thus face the consequences of being on the list.  This injury is continuing and actual, \nrather than hypothetical, and affects Progeny in an individual way as it is prevented from \nundertaking  certain  activities  as  an  organization.    This  injury  in  fact  is  fairly  traceable  to \nDefendantsโ conduct in creating and maintaining the Gang List and may be redressed by favorable \ninjunctive relief dismantling the Gang List.  Progeny, therefore, has standing to seek relief on its \nown behalf.  \nProgeny also contends it has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members for the same \ntypes of harm alleged by the named Plaintiffs.  An association may bring suit on behalf of its \n \n54 Citizens United v. Fed.

The Court determined \nabove that at least one of its members, Elbert Costello, has standing to sue on his own behalf, and \nthe interests Progeny seeks to protect by fighting the Gang List are germane to its overall purpose \nof extricating its members from involvement in the criminal justice system.  But Progenyโs claim \nfor associational standing runs into difficulties because many of the claims asserted require the \nparticipation of its individual members.   \nLegal claims generally require individual participation when they rely on elements of \nโindividualized proof.โ57  Progeny asserts that claims for injunctive relief typically do not require \nindividual participation,58 and thus this prong is satisfied.  This may be true, but the third prong of \nassociational standing requires not only consideration of whether the relief requested requires \nindividual participation, but also whether the claims asserted so require.  The claims at issue here \nwill require, at least in part, elements of โindividualized proof.โ  For instance, the procedural due \nprocess claim will require each individual member to assert that they are improperly on the Gang \nList because they are not gang members.  The as-applied vagueness and First Amendment \nchallenges require consideration of the particular circumstances in which an individual was added \nor renewed on the Gang List, because as-applied challenges must be tethered to the factual context \nof the alleged violation.  And the substantive due process claim requires consideration of how the \n \n56 Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Advert.

Some claims, such as First Amendment overbreadth and facial vagueness, \nwill not require individualized proof, and Progeny may assert those claims on behalf of its \nmembers.    But  Progeny  does  not  have  associational  standing  for  those  claims  that  require \nindividualized proof.  Because in Count II, Progeny relies entirely on associational standing to \nbring its procedural due process claim on behalf of its members, and that claim will require \nindividualized proof, that Count is dismissed. \nIn conclusion, all named individual Plaintiffs have standing to bring their various claims \nfor prospective relief.  Progeny has standing to sue for direct injuries it has allegedly suffered as a \nresult of the Gang List but does not have standing to sue as an association on behalf of its members.  \nWith the introductory issue of Plaintiffsโ standing now resolved, the Court turns to the issue of \nwhether the substantive claims properly state a claim for relief.  \nB.  Fourteenth Amendment Claims \n  1.  Void for Vagueness โ Count I \n  A basic feature of Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment is that a law must clearly \ndefine what it prohibits, or otherwise be held โvoid for vagueness.โ59  โWhere a law deals with \nareas of First Amendment import, there is the additional concern that the uncertain terms will \ninhibit those First Amendment freedoms, as โcitizens will steer far wider of the unlawful zone than \nif the boundaries of the forbidden areas were clearly marked.โ โ60  As such, stricter standards may \n \n59 Grayned v.

First, a plaintiff may challenge the \nstatute as vague as applied to his particular circumstances.63  The analysis of an as-applied claim \nis tethered to the factual context in which the statute was applied to the plaintiff.64  Of course, a \nthe motion to dismiss stage, the plaintiffโs plausible factual allegations are presumed true.65  \nSecond, a plaintiff may allege that a statute is facially vague.66  Such a claim is โstrong medicine,โ \nand requires a plaintiff to show โthe challenged law would be vague in the vast majority of its \napplications.โ67  Plaintiffs do not explicitly state whether they bring an as-applied or facial \nchallenge, but it appears from the Complaint that they bring both.  \n   Defendants, instead of discussing the legal standards for as-applied or facial challenges to \npurportedly vague statutes, base their motion to dismiss on two grounds.  First, Defendants believe \nthat the Supreme Court has limited vagueness challenges to statutes which define a crime or fix a \nsentence.  They base this argument on Beckles v. United States,68  but Defendants misread Beckles.  \nIn Beckles, the Court identified โtwo kinds of criminal lawsโ that it had previously invalidated \n \n61 Id.

Ct. 886 (2017).  \n-21- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 28   Filed 01/10/22   Page 22 of 39\nunder the void for vagueness doctrine: โlaws that define criminal offenses and laws that fix the \npermissible sentences for criminal offenses.โ69  But the Court did not say these are the only two \nkinds of laws that could be invalidated under the doctrine.  Rather, the Court has previously held \nthat,  whether  or  not  it  is  labeled  as  penal,  a  statute  โmust  meet  the  challenge  that  it  is \nunconstitutionally  vague.โ70    Further,  laws  that  impinge  on  First  Amendment  freedoms,  as \nPlaintiffs allege K.S.A 21-6313 does, are subject to stringent standards in vagueness challenges.71  \nThus, the fact that this statue does not define a criminal offense or fix permissible criminal \nsentences does not mean it is immune from a vagueness challenge.  \n  Defendantsโ second argument essentially asks this Court to analogize ยง 21-6313 to other \nstatutes that have survived void for vagueness challenges, such as the federal RICO statute and the \nViolent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. But Defendants draw no parallels \nbetween the challenged criteria of ยง 21-6313(b) and these statutes. For instance, under ยง 21-6313, \na person can be designated a โcriminal street gang memberโ if he or she โ(D) frequents a particular \ncriminal street gangโs area; (E) adopts such gangโs style of dress, color, use of hand signs or tattoos; \n[or] (F) associates with known criminal street gang members,โ just to name a few.72  These \nprovisions are at the heart of Plaintiffsโ vagueness challenge, but Defendants fail to suggest how \neither statute parallels these particular provisions, and thus why the Court should dismiss the \nvagueness claim out of hand.   \n \n69 Id. at 892 (emphasis removed).  \n70 Giaccio v. Pennsylvania, 382 U.S. 399, 402 (1966). See also Sessions v. Dimaya, 138 S.

For instance, in \nUnited States v. Vega,75 the Ninth Circuit upheld the probation condition prohibiting the defendant \nfrom associating โwith any member of any criminal street gang as directed by the Probation \nOfficer, specifically, any member of the Harpys street gangโ against a vagueness challenge.โ76  \nThe court there relied on precedent specific to the probation context, in which the Supreme Court \nreasoned that the word โassociationโ in parole restrictions did not apply to โincidental contacts.โ77  \nBy contrast, there is no such limiting construction yet applied to โassociatesโ under ยง 21-6313.  \nAnd Plaintiffs allege that they have been put on the Gang List precisely for incidental contacts \nwith friends and family members.  The court in Vega further relied on the fact that the probation \nrestriction was limited by reference to a particular gang.78  This also is not present in the language \nof subsection (F). The cases cited by Defendants are thus inapposite.  \n \n73 See, e.g., United States v. Green, 618 F.3d 120 (2d Cir. 2010); United States v.

Their motion as to that Count is denied.  \n  2.  Procedural Due Process โ Count III \n  The Fourteenth Amendment states that โ[n]o state shall . . . deprive any person of life, \nliberty, or property, without due process of law.โ79  The Supreme Court has identified two unique \ndue process rights under this Amendment: procedural due process and substantive due process.80  \nA plaintiffโs claim that he or she has been denied procedural due process requires a two-step \ninquiry: โ(1) did the individual possess a protected interest such that the due process protections \nwere applicable; and, if so, then (2) was the individual afforded an appropriate level of process.โ81 \n  The three interests explicitly protected by the Due Process Clause are โlife, liberty, [and] \nproperty.โ82  Individual Plaintiffs make no claim that their interests in life or property are at stake.  \nRather, each individual Plaintiff believes his liberty interest in his โgood name, reputation, honor, \nor integrityโ is in the crosshairs because of a โbadge of infamyโ pinned on him by Defendantsโ \ninclusion of his name on the Gang List.83  In so arguing, Plaintiffs invoke doctrine commonly \nreferred to as โstigma plus.โ84  To show an affected liberty interest under the stigma plus doctrine, \na Plaintiff must show that: โ(1) the government made a statement about him or her that is \nsufficiently derogatory to injure his or her reputation, that is capable of being proved false, and \n \n79 U.S. Const. amend.

This statement is clearly capable of \nbeing proved false, and each Plaintiff assets that it is false.  The question, then, is whether the \nstatement  that  a  person  is  a  gang  member  is  โsufficiently  derogatory  to  injure  his  or  her \nreputation.โ86  The Court is inclined to agree with the several other courts who have considered \nthis question and answered it in the affirmative.87  In particular, the Court is persuaded that \ndesignation as a gang member inescapably implies that a person is involved, at least in some \ncapacity, with criminal activity,88 which is generally recognized as defamatory per se under \nrelevant state law.89  Further, Plaintiffs plausibly allege that the Gang List is made sufficiently \npublic to injure their reputations.  They allege not only that the list was shared within various local, \nstate, and federal law enforcement agencies, but that it was also distributed to other parts of the \nlocal and federal government, as well as to potential employers, landlords, and licensing agents of \nPlaintiffs.  Thus, Plaintiffs plausibly allege the government defamation element of stigma plus.  \n \n85 Id. (quoting Paul v.

There \nis no clear definition of what โstatusโ is relevant for this inquiry, but the Court discerns that it often \nboils down to a question of whether the plaintiff is restricted from doing something significant, \nbecause of the governmentโs defamation, that he or she could otherwise do โin common with the \nrest of the citizenry.โ90   Damage to the plaintiffโs reputation alone, by contrast, will not constitute \na significant change of status under state law.91  Nor will impairment of prospective employment \nopportunities.92  \nInclusion in the Gang list does not, by its explicit terms, create an absolute legal bar \npreventing Plaintiffs from doing some things.  In theory, Plaintiffs can still choose to visit \nbusinesses,  associate  with  their  friends  and  families,  and  choose  their  wardrobe  without \ngovernment decrees imposing an explicit legal bar on their choices.  But Plaintiffs allege that in \npractice, they are prohibited from doing these things. They allege they cannot visit certain \nbusinesses for fear that they have been designated as โgang hideoutsโ and will subject them to \nrenewal on the List or increased surveillance and unwanted interaction with law enforcement \nofficers.  They allege they cannot associate with friends and family for fear of causing these \n \n90 Paul, 424 U.S. at 708; see also Constantineau, 400 U.S. at 435โ39 (finding a protected liberty interest \nwhen the plaintiff, by a posting of the police chief, was forbidden from purchasing or receiving liquor within her \nhometown for a year); Larry v.

And they \nallege they cannot wear certain clothes or colors because of feared renewal on the Gang List and \nincreased surveillance from law enforcement.  Assuming these allegations are true, the Gang List \ndesignation has the effect of restricting Plaintiffsโ ability to do significant things that they \notherwise have the right to do freely.  These tangible consequences of being on the Gang List \nrefute Defendantsโ contention that Plaintiffs only suffer โreputational harmโ under Paul because \nof their inclusion on the list.  Plaintiffs thus satisfy the โstigma plusโ test and have plausibly alleged \nthat they have been deprived of a protected liberty interest by Defendantsโ actions.  \n  Moving to the second part of the procedural due process inquiry, the Court is required to \nconsider whether the government provided the appropriate level of process for the deprivation of \nthe plaintiffโs protected interest.93  Process due is typically some form of notice and an opportunity \nto be heard, though the level of each depends on the demands of a particular situation.94  The \nbalance of certain enumerated factors aids in making this determination,95 but the Court need not \nengage in such an inquiry at this time.  Plaintiffs allege that they were provided with no procedures, \nno notice or opportunity to be heard, before or after being added to the Gang List.

After this careful determination \nof the rights at play, the Court must determine whether these rights count as โfundamental,โ or \nโobjectively, deeply rooted in this Nationโs history and tradition.โ103  Even with fundamental rights \nthough, โ[w]here a particular Amendment โprovides an explicit textual source of constitutional \nprotectionโ against a particular sort of government behavior, โthat Amendment, not the more \ngeneralized notion of substantive due process, must be the guide for analyzing these claims.โ โ104 \n  It  is  here  that  Plaintiffsโ  substantive  due  process  claim  falls  short.

The Supreme Court has recognized a few narrowly defined fundamental \nrights under the rubric of privacy, such as โthose relating to marriage, family life, child rearing, \nand reproductive choices.โ108  But police surveillance and attention are poles apart from the \naforementioned rights, and the Court would be straying far from the basic guideposts in this area \nby recognizing a fundamental right to be free from unwanted police surveillance and attention.  \nAnd to the extent such surveillance and attention is believed to implicate a search under the \nmeaning of the Fourth Amendment, naturally it should be examined under the framework of that \namendment rather than the more generalized notion of substantive due process.  \n  The sixth, twelfth and thirteenth items on Plaintiffsโ list do not implicate a fundamental \nright that is โobjectively, deeply rooted in this Nationโs history and tradition.โ109  Those items \nconcern the publication of Plaintiffsโ status as gang members to various entities, which Plaintiffs \nbelieve resulted in losses of employment, educational, and licensing opportunities.

Plaintiffsโ complaints \nabout restrictive pretrial release and probation conditions, as well as diminished plea offers and \nprejudicial introduction of evidence of their membership on the Gang List, do not implicate a \nfundamental right.  While Plaintiffs urge the Court to conclude that Due Process is implicated in \nthese contexts, the only support they offer for this position are two cases in which prisoners were \nsubjected to โdeprivations of liberty which are not among those generally authorized by [their] \nconfinement.โ110  The Court does not fathom how Plaintiffsโ situation is at all similar to that present \nin those cases.  Further, Plaintiffsโ claim that they suffered โincreased bailโ seems to fit more \nappropriately under the Eighth Amendmentโs prohibition on โexcessive bail,โ if in fact Plaintiffs \nclaim the bail set in their individual cases was excessive.111  Finally, Plaintiffsโ claims regarding \ntheir ability to associate with whom they want and express themselves in the way they choose are \nmore appropriately analyzed under the First Amendment, as Plaintiffs seem to recognize, having \nraised these claims separately.   \nIn sum, Plaintiffs ask this Court, throughout their substantive due process claim, to leave \nbehind the โguideposts for responsible decisionmakingโ112 staked out by the Supreme Court and \n \n110 DeShaney v.

Plaintiffs do so without even an inkling of discussion of why these purported rights are \ndeeply rooted in our Nationโs history and tradition, nor why the Court should not be hesitant to \nexpansively recognize fundamental rights when the Supreme Court itself has been extremely \ncautious in doing so.113  Plaintiffs also prefer to vindicate their allegedly violated rights through \nthe rubric of substantive due process rather than the more specific standards applicable to those \nrights.  The Court declines to join Plaintiffs on this ill-thought-out journey.  Count IV is dismissed.  \n  4.   Equal Protection โ Count V \nPlaintiffsโ  Equal  Protection  claim  alleges  that  the  Gang  List  and  Defendants \nimplementation thereof constitute discrimination because of each Plaintiffโs race and national \norigin.  The Equal Protection Clause under the Fourteenth Amendment provides that โ[n]o state \nshall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.โ114  This is \nโessentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike,โ115 whether by \nlegislation or the conduct of state actors.116  An equal protection claim proceeds in two steps.  First, \nthe Court asks โwhether the challenged state action intentionally discriminates between groups of \n \n113 See Does v. Munoz, 507 F.3d 961, 964 (6th Cir .2007) (โ[I]dentifying a new fundamental right subject to \nthe protections of substantive due process is often an โuphill battle,โ as the list of fundamental rights โis short.โ โ) \n(internal citation omitted).  \n114 U.S. Const. amend.

Discriminatory intent requires that โthat \nthe decisionmaker . . . selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part โbecause \nof,โ not merely โin spite of,โ its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.โ120  Though this intent \nmay be proved circumstantially based on an inference from the relevant facts,121 evidence of the \nracially disproportionate impact of a particular government policy or course of conduct will not, \nstanding alone, satisfy the requirement that the official action was taken with a discriminatory \nintent.122  โDisproportionate impact is not irrelevant, but it is not the sole touchstone of an invidious \nracial discrimination forbidden by the Constitution.โ123 \nPlaintiffs contend they have plausibly alleged Defendantsโ discriminatory intent with \nrespect to the Gang List.  The Complaint alleges that Defendants created the Gang List โto track \nand surveil Black and Latinx neighborhoods,โ that Defendantsโ policing focuses on communities \nof color, and that persons of color on the list are subject to more severe surveillance and \npunishment than white persons on the list.124  These allegations, however, do not plausibly allege \n \n117 SECSYS, LLC, 666 F.3d at 685 (citations omitted).  \n118 Ashaheed, 7 F.4th at 1250 (citations omitted).  \n119 See Free the Nipple-Fort Collins v.

Because these allegations are not entitled to the presumption of truth, the \nCourt disregards them and examines Plaintiffsโ remaining factual allegations to determine if they \nplausibly state an equal protection claim.  \nPlaintiffsโ remaining allegations solely concern the alleged discriminatory impact of the \nGang List.  In particular, they cite a 2008 study finding that Black and Latinx persons formed an \noutsized proportion of the Gang List as compared to their respective shares of the general \npopulation of Wichita.125  Even assuming this is true, allegations of the discriminatory impact of a \nparticular policy are not enough, standing alone, to state an equal protection claim.  Because \nPlaintiff fails to plausibly allege a discriminatory intent behind the Gang List, the Court need not \ntest it against one of the tiers of scrutiny.  Count V is dismissed for failure to state a claim.  \nC.  First Amendment Claims \n  1.  Freedom of Expression โ Counts VI & VII \n  Plaintiffs bring a variety of claims that their right to freedom of speech under the First \nAmendment has been restricted by ยง 21-6313 and Defendantsโ policies with respect to the Gang \nList.  Plaintiffs believe ยง 21-6313(b)(2)(E) directly prohibits expressive conduct because a person \ncan be added or renewed on the Gang List, at least in part, because he or she โadopts such gangโs \nstyle of dress, color, use of hand signs or tattoos.โ  This, Plaintiffs allege, directly prohibits and \nchills speech, and is facially overbroad to boot, as evidenced by Plaintiff Elbert Costelloโs renewal \non the Gang List simply because he was wearing a red Philadelphia Phillies hat.   \n \n125 Id. at ยถ 7 (citing Gregg W. Etter Sr & Warren G. Swymeler, Examining the Demographics of Street Gangs \nin Wichita, Kansas, 16 J. of Gang Rsch, at 7โ8 (2008)).   \n-34- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 28   Filed 01/10/22   Page 35 of 39\nBefore diving into these related claims, the Court must address a threshold issue in First \nAmendment cases involving expressive conduct or โsymbolic speech,โ rather than written or \nverbal expression.126  Namely, does the plaintiffโs conduct actually constitute protected speech \nunder the First Amendment? A necessary element to transform conduct into protected speech is \nthat the plaintiff had the โintent to convey a particularized message.โ127  It is in addressing this \nelement that the Court concludes this issue, though framed under the First Amendment, is actually \na different species of the procedural due process claim discussed above.  \n  In theory, there are two possible messages Elbert could have been intending to convey by \nwearing his Phillies hat.  He could have been trying to communicate โI like the Philadelphia \nPhillies and think they are an excellent baseball team.โ  And if this is the case, Defendantsโ decision \nto renew his Gang List designation on this basis was not a punishment based on his communicated \nmessage.  There is no allegation that Defendants intend to place persons on the Gang List simply \nbecause they are Phillies fans.  Rather, if this was Elbertโs message in wearing the Phillies cap, \nDefendants made a mistake about his message, and Elbertโs grievance centers around the lack of \nopportunity to challenge the grounds underlying the renewal of his designation as a gang member. \nThis, of course, is a feature of procedural due process.    \nThe second possible message Elbert may have been trying to convey by wearing the hat is \nโI am a gang member.โ  This is certainly the message Defendants understood Elbert to convey.  \nBut this is foreclosed by Elbertโs own statements, accepted as true at this stage, that he is not, and \n \n126 See, e.g., Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503 (1969) (wearing armband for purpose \nof expressing certain political view constitutes symbolic speech protected under the First Amendment).  \n127 Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 404 (1989) (quoting Spence v.

Accordingly, this cause of action, though brought under the First \nAmendment, is merely a facet of Plaintiffsโ procedural due process claim.  \n  2.   Freedom of Association โ Counts VI & VII \n  The First Amendment does not explicitly enumerate the right to freedom of association, \nbut the Supreme Court has held that it protects such a right in certain circumstances.128  Among \nthese are the right to โenter into and maintain certain intimate human relationships,โ129  including \nโfamily relationships, which by their nature, involve deep attachments and commitments to the \nnecessarily few other individuals with whom one shares not only a special community of thoughts, \nexperiences, and beliefs but also distinctly personal aspects of oneโs life.โ130  The First Amendment \nalso protects the โright to associate for the purpose of engaging in those activities protected by the \nFirst Amendmentโspeech, assembly, petition for the redress of grievances, and the exercise of \nreligion.โ131  Government action that restricts a personโs ability to associate in these ways must \nface strict judicial scrutiny.132  Even beyond direct restrictions of these associational rights, First \nAmendment protections are triggered by โ[t]he risk of a chilling effect on association โbecause \nFirst Amendment freedoms need breathing space to survive.โ โ133 \n  Plaintiffs allege that both of the above associational rights are directly restricted and chilled \nby ยง 21-6313 and Defendantsโ policies.  To be clear, Plaintiffs do not allege that statutes and \n \n128 City of Dallas v. Stanglin, 490 U.S. 19, 23 (1989).  \n129 Roberts v. U.S. Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 617โ18 (1984). \n130 Trujillo v.

Button, \n371 U.S. 415, 433 (1963)).  \n-36- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 28   Filed 01/10/22   Page 37 of 39\nDefendantsโ policies, by their terms, create a legal bar preventing Plaintiffs from exercising their \nassociational rights.  Rather, they contend that the unavoidable effect of the statute and policies is \nto keep them from exercising their associational rights.  Several criteria allowing designation as a \nโcriminal street gang memberโ under ยง 21-6313 involve associations with other known criminal \nstreet gang members.134  The individual Plaintiffs each allege that these criteria have kept them \nfrom associating with family, or resulted in their punishment if they have, because either they \nfeared having their own designation as a gang member renewed because their family members \nwere already on the Gang List, or because they did not want their family members to end up on \nthe List because they associated with Plaintiffs.  Further, Progeny alleges it is restricted from \nholding town halls for the purpose of getting community members involved with its mission of \nadvocating for change in the juvenile criminal justice system because the criteria of ยง 21-6313, \nand Defendants application thereof, will create the risk that such a gathering will cause attendees \nto either be designated as gang members or have an already existing designation renewed.  \n  Defendants  contend  that  these  are  restrictions  are  self-imposed  choices  and  do  not \nautomatically follow from the application of ยง 21-6313.  The individual Plaintiffs choose not to \nassociate with their family members, and Progeny chooses not to host town halls.  This, they \nbelieve, does not implicate the First Amendment.  But contrary to Defendantsโ description, the \nsituation alleged by Plaintiffs does not present Plaintiffs with much of a choice.  That choice is \nbetween seeing their family members and subjecting those individuals and themselves to the \nconsequences of being on the Gang List or foregoing such association and sparing themselves and \ntheir families the consequences.  The First Amendment protects individuals from being forced by \n \n134 See K.S.A. ยง 21-6313(b)(2)(F), (I).  \n-37- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 28   Filed 01/10/22   Page 38 of 39\nthe government to make choices such as this.135  Thus, Plaintiffs state a plausible claim for relief \nthat that their associational rights are restricted by ยง 21-6313 and Defendantsโ related policies.  \nD.  Claims Against Chief Ramsay and Lieutenant Beard in Their Official Capacities \n  Defendants ask the Court to dismiss the suits against Chief Ramsay and Lieutenant Beard \nin their official capacities.  Official capacity suits โgenerally represent only another way of \npleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an agent.โ136  If the government entity \nreceives notice and an opportunity to respond, the suit is essentially treated as one against the \nentity.137  This Court has previously dismissed official capacity suits as redundant when the \ngovernment entity is itself a party.138  Plaintiffs urge the Court not to do so here, citing the doctrine \nof Ex parte Young, which permits suits against state officers in their official capacities to enjoin \naction violative of federal law.139  So it does.  But it does not require official capacity suits to be \nheard alongside suits against the government entity itself.  Following its past practice of dismissing \nindividual defendants sued in their official capacity when the relevant government entity is itself \na party, the Court dismisses Chief Ramsay and Lieutenant Beard.  \n \n135 Cf. Koontz v. Watson, 283 F. Supp. 3d 1007, 1026 (D.

Her harm is ongoing \nbecause the Kansas Law is currently chilling plaintiffโs and other putative state contractorsโ speech rights.โ) \n136 Kentucky v.

Municipal Liability \n  Defendant City of Wichita contends that it may not be held liable under Monell v. New \nYork City Department of Social Services.140  In that case, the Supreme Court held:  \n[A] local government may not be sued under ยง 1983 for an injury inflicted solely \nby its employees or agents. Instead, it is when execution of a governmentโs policy \nor custom, whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may \nfairly be said to represent official policy, inflicts the injury that the government as \nan entity is responsible under ยง 1983.141   \nPlaintiffs do not allege they were injured solely by the employees or agents of the City.  Rather, \nthey allege its official policy creating and maintaining the Gang List causes them ongoing injury.  \nThe City is therefore a proper defendant under Monell and ยง 1983.  \nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Defendantsโ Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 14) is \nGRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nCounts II, IV, and V are dismissed.

Broadly speaking, they seek relief from Defendant City \nof Wichitaโs โGang List,โ along with the statutes and local policies that enable it.  The Gang List \nis purportedly a list of persons, created and maintained by the Wichita Police Department \n(โWPDโ), whom WPD personnel have determined meet the definition of a โcriminal street gang \nmemberโ under the criteria set out in K.S.A. ยง 21-6313(b).  The individual Plaintiffs allege they \nwere wrongfully designated as โcriminal street gang member[s]โ and added to the Gang List, \nwhich has negatively affected their lives in a host of ways.  Plaintiffs seek (1) certification as a \nclass under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2); (2) a declaration that K.S.A. ยง 21-6313 is \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 28   Filed 01/10/22   Page 2 of 39\nunconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments; (3) a declaration that Defendants \nCity of Wichita, Chief Gordan Ramsey in his official capacity as Chief of the WPD, and Lieutenant \nChad Beard in his official capacity as supervisor of the Gang Unit of the WPD, violated their First \nand Fourteenth Amendment rights through their policies, practices, and conduct related to the \nGang List; and (4) both preliminary and permanent injunctive relief effectively dismantling the \nGang List.  Defendants now move to dismiss this action, alleging that Plaintiffs do not have \nstanding to seek this relief under Article III of the United States Constitution, and that Plaintiffs \nfail to state plausible claims for relief.  The Court finds that Plaintiffs do have standing, but because \nsome of the proposed legal theories rest on constitutionally infirm ground, the Court grants in part \nand denies in part Defendantsโ Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 14).  \nI.  Factual and Procedural Background1 \nAt the heart of this constitutional quagmire is a relatively brief definitional statute.  K.S.A. \nยง 21-6313 defines several terms relevant to criminal gangs, including a definition of a โcriminal \nstreet gangโ2 and โcriminal street gang activity.โ3  But for present purposes, the most important \npart of ยง 21-6313 are its definitions of โcriminal street gang memberโ and โcriminal street gang \nassociate.โ4  A โcriminal street gang memberโ is a person who either admits to their membership \n \n1 The following facts, assumed to be true for the purposes of this Order, are taken from Plaintiffsโ Complaint \nand Exhibit A attached thereto.  Though normally the Court only considers the plaintiffโs complaint in ruling on a \nmotion to dismiss, the Court may consider documents of undisputed authenticity that are โcentral to the complaint.โ \nDunmars v. Ford Cnty., Kan. Bd. of Commโrs, 2019 WL 3817958, at *3 (D. Kan. 2019) (citations omitted).  The \nauthenticity of Exhibit A is not disputed by the parties and it is central to Plaintiffsโ claims, as it represents at least \npart of the challenged policy on which Plaintiffsโ claims rest.  \n2 K.S.A. ยง 21-6313(a). \n3 Id. ยง 21-6313(c).  \n4 Id. ยง 21-6313(b), (d).  \n-2- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 28   Filed 01/10/22   Page 3 of 39\nin a gang or meets three of the following statutory criteria, while a โcriminal street gang associateโ \nneed only meet two: \n(A) Is identified as a criminal street gang member by a parent or guardian; \n(B) is identified as a criminal street gang member by a state, county or city law \nenforcement officer or correctional officer or documented reliable informant; \n(C) is identified as a criminal street gang member by an informant of previously \nuntested  reliability  and  such  identification  is  corroborated  by  independent \ninformation; \n(D) frequents a particular criminal street gangโs area; \n(E) adopts such gangโs style of dress, color, use of hand signs or tattoos; \n(F) associates with known criminal street gang members; \n(G) has been arrested more than once in the company of identified criminal street \ngang members for offenses which are consistent with usual criminal street gang \nactivity; \n(H) is identified as a criminal street gang member by physical evidence including, \nbut not limited to, photographs or other documentation; \n(I) has been stopped in the company of known criminal street gang members two \nor more times; or \n(J) has participated in or undergone activities self-identified or identified by a \nreliable informant as a criminal street gang initiation ritual;5 \nThe various definitions of ยง 21-6313 are relevant internally to that statute, as several of the criteria \nlaid out above rely on those definitions, but they are also relevant to subsequent statutory sections.  \nFor example, K.S.A. ยง 21-6316 sets a minimum bail of $50,000 for โcriminal street gang membersโ \narrested for a person felony, subject to a few exceptions.6 \nWPD policy puts ยง 21-6313 into practice on the streets of Wichita.  Specifically, Policy \n527 defines the procedures for an individualโs inclusion on the Gang List.  โAny state, county, or \ncity law enforcement officer or correctional officer may nominateโ an individual for inclusion on \nthe Gang List.7  After this nomination, the individual will be added to the Gang List if they meet \n \n5 Id. ยง21-6313(b)(2)(A)โ(J).  \n6 K.S.A. ยง 21-6316.  \n7 Pls.โ Compl.

Once on the Gang List, Policy 527 provides that the individual will \nremain on either โactiveโ or โassociateโ status for a minimum of three years.8  If, after three years, \nthe individual has not engaged in documented criminal street gang activity, the individual will be \ndesignated โinactiveโ in the Gang List.9  But this three-year period starts over if an officer \ndocuments that the individual either meets the criteria set out in ยง 21-6313(b) or that the individual \nhas been involved in criminal street gang activity or a gang-related incident, as defined by the \nstatute.  Officers of the WPD monitor members of the Gang List for any violations of probation \nconditions, bond, and pretrial restrictions.  Policy 527 further specifies that the Gang List is \nconfidential and will only be released to commissioned law enforcement or correctional officers, \nalong with those persons or entities authorized to receive Gang List information by various high-\nlevel supervisors within the WPD.  \nPlaintiffs allege that both ยง 21-6313 and Policy 527 are problematic by their own terms.  \nFor instance, Plaintiffs complain that ยง 21-6313 and Policy 527 largely have no requirements that \nan individual receive notice that their name has been added to the Gang List, and even if they are \naware of it, the WPD provides no procedures by which the individual could challenge such \ndesignation.10  Further, Plaintiffs believe that the criteria laid out in ยง 21-6313(b), on which Policy \n527 relies, can lead to persons being labeled as criminal gang members for otherwise innocuous \nconduct such as what they wear, the places they visit, and for associating with family and friends.  \nIndeed, Plaintiffs go on to say that because of these expansive criteria, โthe majority of Wichita \ncitizens, including most judges, lawyers, clergy, union members, and other professional and social \n \n8 Id. at 3.  \n9 Id.  \n10 Plaintiffs concede that Policy 527 does provide for notice when the individual in question is a juvenile.  \n-4- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 28   Filed 01/10/22   Page 5 of 39\nservices providers, could be discretionally designated as a gang member or associate and added to \nthe Gang List.โ11  Once on the Gang List, Policy 527 does not provide an opportunity for an \nindividual to leave the Gang List entirely.  Rather, the individual simply may be labeled โinactiveโ \nwith no clear definition of what this designation means.12  And though Policy 527 provides that \nthe Gang List should remain confidential, it allows certain high-level members of the WPD to \nshare the list at their discretion, which Plaintiffs allege occurs with some frequency. Plaintiffs \nbelieve the list is shared with other local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies, as well as \npotential employers, landlords, and licensing agents of those persons on the Gang List.  \nEven beyond the explicit terms of ยง 21-6313 and Policy 527, Plaintiffs believe that each \npermits conduct by police officers that is largely unchecked and extends beyond the pale in a \nvariety of ways.  According to Plaintiffs, WPD officers have nearly unlimited discretion in \ndetermining whether an individual meets the criteria of ยง 21-6313(b), and thus whether to add that \nindividual to the Gang List.  Plaintiffs believe that the WPD has a practice of falsely reporting that \nan individual admitted to criminal street gang membership and will perform hostile and intrusive \ntraffic  stops  with  individuals  on  the  Gang  List,  in-person  and  online  surveillance  of  such \nindividuals, and searches of the individualโs person and property.  Plaintiffs allege that all of these \nWPD actions affect persons of color on the Gang List more so than white persons, as WPD officers \nmake less of an effort to surveil or stop white persons on the Gang List.  Plaintiffs further suggest \nthat the demographic make-up of the Gang List is itself indicative of unchecked officer discretion \nand discrimination.

Plaintiff Christopher Cooper first learned he was on the Gang List in 2014 \nwhen he was arrested for first degree murder, though he denies he was a gang member at that or \nany other time.  His bail was set at $50,000, which he attributes to the requirements of ยง 21-6316.14  \nCooper accepted a plea deal and at sentencing was placed on probation with special gang-related \nconditions.  He alleges these conditions forced him to live away from his family because some of \nthem were on the Gang List.  Cooper states that though he has not had any criminal charges or \noffenses since 2014, he has repeatedly been stopped for minor traffic infractions and harassed by \nWPD officers, who know his name and treat him like a criminal during these interactions.  These \ninteractions ceased when Cooper began driving a car registered in the name of a family member.  \nRecently, Cooper applied for a new job, but after a background check, was rejected.  Cooper \nbelieves he was rejected because the background check identified him as an active gang member.  \nPlaintiff Elbert Costello first learned he was on the Gang List in 1997, when he was arrested \nin connection with a shooting.  He states that, though he had relatives involved with gangs, he has \nnever been a gang member.  Elbert was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and sentenced to a \nperiod of imprisonment, which he served in a โhigher-level custodial settingโ because, he alleges, \n \n13 Pls.โ Compl., Doc. 1, at ยถ 7 (citing Gregg W.

Both during and following his supervised release, \nElbert alleges he has been subject to increased surveillance and traffic stops by WPD officers, \nwhich were often for minor traffic violations but led to invasive questioning.  Elbert alleges he has \navoided spending time with lifelong friends because they may also be on the Gang List and \nassociating with each other can lead โinactiveโ designations to become โactiveโ or can renew the \nthree-year clock for already โactiveโ Gang List designations.  He further alleges he has avoided \ncertain businesses because he believes the WPD has identified them as โgang hideouts.โ16  Still, \nthese precautions have apparently not been enough, as Elbert has repeatedly been renewed as \nโactiveโ on the Gang List, often for photos or other instances of him associating with others on the \nGang List.  Most recently, Elbert was renewed because he appeared in a social media photo \nwearing a red โPhiladelphia Philliesโ baseball cap, and because the color red is associated with a \ngang.   \nPlaintiff Martel Costello believes he was first added to the Gang List in 2016 because of \nhis association with relatives, presumably also members of the Gang List, rather than any conduct \non his part.  Around that time, Martel was arrested for drug and firearm offenses.  He was released \npending trial after posting bond, which he believes was set high because of his Gang List \ndesignation.  During his pretrial release, Martel alleges he was stopped and harassed numerous \ntimes by WPD officers for minor traffic infractions.  Martel ultimately pled guilty and received a \nsentence of 18 monthsโ probation, subject to a condition that he not associate with anyone else on \n \n15 Pls.โ Compl., Doc. 1, at ยถ 128.  \n16 Id. at ยถ 136.  \n-7- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 28   Filed 01/10/22   Page 8 of 39\nthe Gang List.  This condition proved troublesome for Martel.  On two separate occasions, Martel \nwas attending funeral services for a family member when he was found to have violated his parole \nbecause also in attendance were family members on the Gang List.  Martel is incarcerated for these \nviolations until at least 2023.  \nPlaintiff Jeremy Levy, Jr., believes he was added to the Gang List at 13 years old when he \nwas pulled over by the WPD while riding in a car with one of his cousins, who was already on the \nGang List.  Levy states that he was not a gang member at that or any other time.  Five years later, \nLevy was charged with first-degree felony murder.  During his trial, the prosecutor was allowed \nto introduce evidence of Levyโs gang membership, based on the Gang List, and other gang-related \nincidents that Levy believes were irrelevant and extremely prejudicial.  Levy was convicted and is \ncurrently incarcerated until at least 2042. \nRounding out the named Plaintiffs, Progeny joins this case from a position distinct from \nthe individuals discussed above.  Progeny is nonprofit organization in Wichita, Kansas, that \noperates โas a youth/adult partnership focused on reimagining the juvenile justice system and \nreinventing in community-based alternatives.โ17  Its goals are to โprevent the incarceration of \nyoung people, break the school-to-prison pipeline, and direct state funds into community-based \nprograms that provide alternatives to incarceration.โ18  As an organization, obviously Progeny is \nnot an active gang member on the Gang List.  But Progeny still alleges that the Gang List has \ncaused it direct harm and has harmed its members.  Progeny alleges that some of its members are \non the Gang List, and that the Gang List has caused it to divert resources away from its other work \n \n17 Id. at ยถ 32.  \n18 Id. at ยถ 33.  \n-8- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 28   Filed 01/10/22   Page 9 of 39\nto provide services to those on the Gang List.  Progeny states that, because ยง 21-6313 and Policy \n527 list โassociat[ing] with known criminal street gang membersโ as one of the criteria for being \ndesignated or renewed as a โcriminal street gang member,โ it is strongly discouraged from hosting \ntown halls or meetings of any kind, as it might result in even more people being added to the Gang \nList.  When an individualโs Gang List designation is known, Progeny believes ยง 21-6313 and \nPolicy 527 effectively prohibit it from providing services to those individuals, as doing so may \nresult in Gang List designations for those Progeny members working with that afflicted individual.  \nTogether, these named Plaintiffs bring a putative class action against the City of Wichita, \nWPD Chief Gordon Ramsey, and WPD Gang Unit Supervisor, Lieutenant Chad Beard, both in \ntheir official capacities.  Plaintiffs allege that ยง 21-6313 and Defendantsโ policies and practices \nhave violated their rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution.  They seek certification as a class under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), and injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief.  Defendants move to dismiss, under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), on \nthe grounds that (1) Plaintiffs do not have standing to seek the relief requested, and (2) Plaintiffs \nfail to state a plausible claim for relief. \nII.  Legal Standard \nA.  Lack of Subject-Matter Jurisdiction \nโFederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction; they are empowered to hear only those \ncases authorized and defined in the Constitution which have been entrusted to them under a \njurisdictional grant by Congress.โ19  A standing challenge is an attack on the Courtโs subject matter \n \n19 Henry v. Off. of Thrift Supervision, 43 F.3d 507, 511 (10th Cir. 1994) (citations omitted). \n-9- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 28   Filed 01/10/22   Page 10 of 39\njurisdiction and is analyzed under Rule (12)(b)(1).20  Rule 12(b)(1) motions come in two types: (1) \na facial attack on the sufficiency of complaintโs allegations as to the courtโs jurisdiction or (2) a \nfactual attack on the facts upon which subject matter is based.21  This case involves a facial attack,22 \nand therefore, the Court must view the factual allegations in the Complaint as true but viewed \nthrough the Iqbal/Twombly plausibility standard, cited below.23  The burden of proof is on the \nparty asserting the Court has jurisdiction.24 \nB.  Failure to State a Claim \nUnder Rule 12(b)(6), a defendant may move for dismissal of any claim for which the \nplaintiff has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.25  Upon such motion, the \ncourt must decide โwhether the complaint contains โenough facts to state a claim to relief that is \nplausible on its face.โ โ26  A claim is facially plausible if the plaintiff pleads facts sufficient for the \ncourt to reasonably infer that the defendant is liable for the alleged misconduct.27  The plausibility \nstandard reflects the requirement in Rule 8 that pleadings provide defendants with fair notice of \n \n20 Hill v. Vanderbilt Cap. Advisors, LLC, 702 F.3d 1220, 1224 (10th Cir. 2012) (โOur court has repeatedly \ncharacterized standing as an element of subject matter jurisdiction.โ). \n21 Stuart v. Colo. Interstate Gas Co., 271 F.3d 1221, 1225 (10th Cir. 2001) (citations omitted).  \n22 The Court notes that Defendants are not explicitly clear about which type of attack they intend to bring.  \nBut after reviewing their arguments on standing, the Court finds they do not challenge the factual basis of Plaintiffโs \nstanding.  This case thus necessarily involves a facial attack.  \n23 See Stuart, 271 F.3d at 1225 (โIn reviewing a facial attack, the district court must accept the allegations in \nthe complaint as true.โ) (citation omitted).  \n24 Kokkonen v.

Schneider, 493 F.3d 1174, 1177 (10th Cir. 2007) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)); see also Ashcroft v.

Analysis \n  Plaintiffs challenge ยง 21-6313 and Defendantsโ policies and practices on a number of \nconstitutional grounds.  Under the Fourteenth Amendment, Plaintiffs contend that (1) ยง 21-6313 \nis void for vagueness, (2) Defendants have failed to provide Plaintiffs with procedural due process, \n(3) Defendants have failed to provide Plaintiffs with substantive due process, and (4) Defendants \nhave violated Plaintiffsโ rights to equal protection under the law.  Under the First Amendment, \nPlaintiffs contend that ยง 21-6313 and Policy 527 violate Plaintiffsโ rights of freedom of expression \nand association, both by a direct prohibition and a chilling effect on the same.  Defendants move \nto dismiss on the grounds that (1) no named Plaintiff has Article III standing to bring the \naforementioned claims, (2) Plaintiffsโ constitutional claims fail to state a plausible claim for relief, \n(3) the claims against Chief Ramsey and Lieutenant Beard are redundant, and (4) the City of \nWichita may not be held liable under Monell v. New York City Department of Social Services.31  \nThe Court examines each line of argument in turn.  \n \n28 See Robbins v. Oklahoma, 519 F.3d 1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2008) (citations omitted); see also Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 8(a)(2). \n29 Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. \n30 See id. (โThe plausibility standard is not akin to a โprobability requirement,โ but it asks for more than a \nsheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.โ) (citation omitted). \n31 436 U.S. 658 (1978). \n-11- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 28   Filed 01/10/22   Page 12 of 39\nAt the outset, the Court notes that Plaintiffs bring their constitutional claims under 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 1983.  That statute permits persons to sue those who violate their constitutional rights \nwhile acting โunder color ofโ state law.32  At this stage, other than its argument under Monell, \nDefendants do not dispute the propriety of ยง 1983 as a vehicle for Plaintiffsโ constitutional claims \nagainst them. The Court thus focuses on the constitutional standards underlying each claim.  \nA.   Article III Standing   \n  1.  Individual Plaintiffsโ Standing \n  The doctrine of standing follows from the clear language of Article III of the United States \nConstitution, which states that the โjudicial power of the United Statesโ extends only to โCasesโ \nand  โControversies.โ33    The  Supreme  Court  has  interpreted  this  to  require  an  โirreducible \nconstitutional minimumโ of three elements before a plaintiffโs suit can proceed in federal court.34  \nโThe plaintiff must have (1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged \nconduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.โ35  \nDefendants focus somewhat interchangeably on the first and second elements in their motion to \ndismiss, but the Court believes it is first necessary to discuss Plaintiffsโ alleged injury in fact with \nprecision.  \nTo demonstrate an injury in fact, a plaintiff must establish he or she โsuffered โan invasion \nof a legally protected interestโ that is โconcrete and particularizedโ and โactual or imminent, not \n \n32 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.

While a plaintiffโs โstanding for retrospective relief may be based on \npast injuries . . . claims for prospective relief require a continuing injuryโ or a credible threat of \nimminent future harm.38  This is because โ[p]ast exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show \na present case or controversy regarding injunctive relief . . .  if unaccompanied by any continuing, \npresent adverse effects.โ39  Similarly, a plaintiff seeking relief from the alleged chilling effect of a \nstatute or policy must allege more than mere subjective chill;40 rather, they must โshow[] a credible \nthreat of prosecution or other consequences following from the statuteโs enforcement.โ41  Plaintiffs \nsolely seek injunctive and declaratory relief: in other words, prospective relief.  Thus, to establish \nstanding to seek this relief, Plaintiffs must show a continuing injury or that they are under a credible \nthreat of future harm.   \nPlaintiffs plausibly allege they suffer from continuing injuries.  Plaintiffs allege that their \ndesignation as โcriminal street gang membersโ on WPDโs Gang List is itself an ongoing injury \nbecause  of  the  constitutional  deprivations  that,  in  their  view,  inevitably  follow  from  such \n \n36 Id. at 339 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560).  \n37 Id. at 339โ40 (citations omitted).  \n38 PeTA v.

They further allege that their First Amendment rights are being \nviolated, again on a continuing basis, because ยง 21-6313 and Policy 527 directly restrict their \nfreedoms of expression and association in that they cannot engage in expressive conduct or \nassociate with family and close friends without the risk that their designation as a gang member \nwill be extended or that their family and friends will be similarly designated.  These restrictions \nextend as long as the Gang List and ยง 21-6313 endure.  \nPlaintiffs also allege that they, in choosing to engage in certain types of expression or \nassociate with certain persons, face a credible threat of real and immediate consequences from \nยง 21-6313 and the Gang List.  A person can be added to the Gang List based, at least in part, on \ntheir โstyle of dress, color [of clothes], use of hand signs or tattoosโ as well as their associations \nwith family and friends who happen to be on the Gang List.  Plaintiffs further allege a number of \nconsequences that flow directly from being on the Gang List, such as those described above.  Thus, \na person by his choices in the way he dresses, or his associations with family and friends, faces a \ncredible threat that he may be added to the Gang List and then must confront the real, immediate \nconsequences of that designation.  \nThese allegations alone are sufficient to distinguish this case from City of Los Angeles v. \nLyons,43 on which Defendants rely.  In Lyons, the Supreme Court concluded the plaintiff, who had \n \n42 Importantly, โ[f]or purposes of the standing inquiry, the question is not whether the alleged injury rises to \nthe level of a constitutional violation.

Walker, 450 \nF.3d 1082, 1088 (10th Cir. 2006).  \n43 461 U.S. 95 (1983).  \n-14- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 28   Filed 01/10/22   Page 15 of 39\nin the past had been subjected to a police chokehold during a traffic stop, did not have standing to \nseek an injunction against the City preventing the use of such chokeholds.44  The Court stated that \nthe plaintiffโs โstanding to seek the injunction requested depended on whether he was likely to \nsuffer future injury from the use of the chokeholds by police officers,โ and found that there was \nno real and immediate threat of such injury.45  Based on this, Defendants attack Plaintiffsโ \nallegations of what they view as โpast injuries,โ such as restrictive probation conditions and high \nbonds in past criminal cases, and past stops by law enforcement viewed as harassing by Plaintiffs.   \nWhile it is true that these past injuries, standing alone, cannot support a request for purely \nprospective relief, Plaintiffs do not solely allege past injuries.  Rather, as discussed, Plaintiffs \nallege a number of continuing injuries and credible future injuries as a direct result of ยง 21-6313 \nand Gang List.  Plaintiffs allege continuing restrictions to their speech and expression and \nstigmatizing designations as gang members that will continue so long as do ยง 21-6313 and the \nGang List.  They also allege a credible threat of consequences if they engage in certain types of \nexpression or association.  For that reason, Plaintiffs have properly alleged injuries in fact \nsufficient to seek prospective and declaratory relief.  \n  Moving to the second element of standing, Defendant contends that a number of Plaintiffsโ \nalleged injuries are not fairly traceable to its conduct.  These include bond decisions, employment \nrejections, designation of custodial facilities, and other decisions that lie with parties not before \nthis Court.  This would be a relevant and even persuasive argument if those were the challenged \ninjuries in this action.  But as this Court discussed above, Plaintiffs allege their injury is the \n \n44 Id. at 98, 105.  \n45 Id. at 105 \n-15- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 28   Filed 01/10/22   Page 16 of 39\ndesignation itself as gang members in the Gang List, not solely the past criminal consequences of \nthat designation.  Looking at the Gang List designation as each Plaintiffโs injury in fact, along with \nthe continuing constitutional violations that Plaintiffs allege as a result of that designation, it is \nclear these are fairly traceable to Defendants, who maintain and control the Gang List.  \nFinally, it is immediately clear that the third element of standing is also met for the \nindividual, named Plaintiffs.  Their injuries can be redressed by a favorable decision here, as \ninjunctive and declaratory relief could remove them from the Gang List and dismantle it, along \nwith the statutes and policies that give life to the list.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs have standing to seek \nthe prospective relief requested.  \n  2.   Progenyโs Standing \nProgeny contends it has standing both directly to seek redress for an injury in fact it has \nsuffered as a result of the Gang List, as well as standing as an association to seek relief on behalf \nof its members.  The Court examines each in turn.   \nAn organization must meet the same three-part test applicable to individuals to have \nstanding to sue on its own behalf.46  That is, the organization โmust have (1) suffered an injury in \nfact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to \nbe redressed by a favorable judicial decision.โ47  Defendants dispute only the first of these \nelements, contending that Progeny has not suffered an injury in fact sufficient to give it a โpersonal \nstake in the outcomeโ 48 of this litigation.  \n \n46 Colo.

Progeny itself states that one of its goals is to โempower young people who have \ncome into contact with the criminal justice system and provide these young people with counseling \nand support.โ53  Providing assistance and resources to individuals beleaguered by the criminal \njustice system is then part of Progenyโs ordinary operations.  It does not matter that these problems \nwithin the criminal justice system are amplified, at least in part, by the personโs designation as a \ngang member.  Spending resources to assist these individuals remains within the ordinary purpose \nof Progeny, and thus such expenditures are ordinary as well.  This is not an injury in fact sufficient \nto confer standing.  \n \n49 Pls.โ Compl., Doc. 1, at ยถ 36.  \n50 Havens Realty Corp., 455 U.S. at 379. \n51 Animal Legal Def. Fund v. Kelly, 434 F.

Like the individual \nPlaintiffs, Progeny alleges its First Amendment rights have been violated by ยง 21-6313 and \nDefendantsโ  related  policies.    Nonprofit  organizations  are  also  protected  by  the  First \nAmendment,54  but at this stage the Court does not ask whether Progenyโs alleged injury rises to \nthe level of a constitutional violation.55  Rather, the Court asks, as before, whether Progeny has \nsufficiently alleged a continuing injury that is concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent.   \nProgenyโs alleged First Amendment injuries fit that bill.  Progeny suggests a clear and \nplausible injury to its right of association owing to the statutory criteria, and attendant WPD policy, \nthat a person may be added to the Gang List simply by associating with the other persons already \non the list.  Because of this, Progeny alleges it is effectively prohibited from hosting town halls or \nother large-scale meetings because of the risk that persons already on the Gang List will be in \nattendance and cause other attendees to either be added to the Gang List or have their designation \nextended, and thus face the consequences of being on the list.  This injury is continuing and actual, \nrather than hypothetical, and affects Progeny in an individual way as it is prevented from \nundertaking  certain  activities  as  an  organization.    This  injury  in  fact  is  fairly  traceable  to \nDefendantsโ conduct in creating and maintaining the Gang List and may be redressed by favorable \ninjunctive relief dismantling the Gang List.  Progeny, therefore, has standing to seek relief on its \nown behalf.  \nProgeny also contends it has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members for the same \ntypes of harm alleged by the named Plaintiffs.  An association may bring suit on behalf of its \n \n54 Citizens United v. Fed.

The Court determined \nabove that at least one of its members, Elbert Costello, has standing to sue on his own behalf, and \nthe interests Progeny seeks to protect by fighting the Gang List are germane to its overall purpose \nof extricating its members from involvement in the criminal justice system.  But Progenyโs claim \nfor associational standing runs into difficulties because many of the claims asserted require the \nparticipation of its individual members.   \nLegal claims generally require individual participation when they rely on elements of \nโindividualized proof.โ57  Progeny asserts that claims for injunctive relief typically do not require \nindividual participation,58 and thus this prong is satisfied.  This may be true, but the third prong of \nassociational standing requires not only consideration of whether the relief requested requires \nindividual participation, but also whether the claims asserted so require.  The claims at issue here \nwill require, at least in part, elements of โindividualized proof.โ  For instance, the procedural due \nprocess claim will require each individual member to assert that they are improperly on the Gang \nList because they are not gang members.  The as-applied vagueness and First Amendment \nchallenges require consideration of the particular circumstances in which an individual was added \nor renewed on the Gang List, because as-applied challenges must be tethered to the factual context \nof the alleged violation.  And the substantive due process claim requires consideration of how the \n \n56 Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Advert.

Some claims, such as First Amendment overbreadth and facial vagueness, \nwill not require individualized proof, and Progeny may assert those claims on behalf of its \nmembers.    But  Progeny  does  not  have  associational  standing  for  those  claims  that  require \nindividualized proof.  Because in Count II, Progeny relies entirely on associational standing to \nbring its procedural due process claim on behalf of its members, and that claim will require \nindividualized proof, that Count is dismissed. \nIn conclusion, all named individual Plaintiffs have standing to bring their various claims \nfor prospective relief.  Progeny has standing to sue for direct injuries it has allegedly suffered as a \nresult of the Gang List but does not have standing to sue as an association on behalf of its members.  \nWith the introductory issue of Plaintiffsโ standing now resolved, the Court turns to the issue of \nwhether the substantive claims properly state a claim for relief.  \nB.  Fourteenth Amendment Claims \n  1.  Void for Vagueness โ Count I \n  A basic feature of Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment is that a law must clearly \ndefine what it prohibits, or otherwise be held โvoid for vagueness.โ59  โWhere a law deals with \nareas of First Amendment import, there is the additional concern that the uncertain terms will \ninhibit those First Amendment freedoms, as โcitizens will steer far wider of the unlawful zone than \nif the boundaries of the forbidden areas were clearly marked.โ โ60  As such, stricter standards may \n \n59 Grayned v.

First, a plaintiff may challenge the \nstatute as vague as applied to his particular circumstances.63  The analysis of an as-applied claim \nis tethered to the factual context in which the statute was applied to the plaintiff.64  Of course, a \nthe motion to dismiss stage, the plaintiffโs plausible factual allegations are presumed true.65  \nSecond, a plaintiff may allege that a statute is facially vague.66  Such a claim is โstrong medicine,โ \nand requires a plaintiff to show โthe challenged law would be vague in the vast majority of its \napplications.โ67  Plaintiffs do not explicitly state whether they bring an as-applied or facial \nchallenge, but it appears from the Complaint that they bring both.  \n   Defendants, instead of discussing the legal standards for as-applied or facial challenges to \npurportedly vague statutes, base their motion to dismiss on two grounds.  First, Defendants believe \nthat the Supreme Court has limited vagueness challenges to statutes which define a crime or fix a \nsentence.  They base this argument on Beckles v. United States,68  but Defendants misread Beckles.  \nIn Beckles, the Court identified โtwo kinds of criminal lawsโ that it had previously invalidated \n \n61 Id. (quotation omitted).  \n62 Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703, 732 (2000) (citing Chicago v. Morales, 527 U.S. 41, 56โ57 (1999)).  \n63 See Galbreath v. City of Oklahoma City, 568 F.

Rather, the Court has previously held \nthat,  whether  or  not  it  is  labeled  as  penal,  a  statute  โmust  meet  the  challenge  that  it  is \nunconstitutionally  vague.โ70    Further,  laws  that  impinge  on  First  Amendment  freedoms,  as \nPlaintiffs allege K.S.A 21-6313 does, are subject to stringent standards in vagueness challenges.71  \nThus, the fact that this statue does not define a criminal offense or fix permissible criminal \nsentences does not mean it is immune from a vagueness challenge.  \n  Defendantsโ second argument essentially asks this Court to analogize ยง 21-6313 to other \nstatutes that have survived void for vagueness challenges, such as the federal RICO statute and the \nViolent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. But Defendants draw no parallels \nbetween the challenged criteria of ยง 21-6313(b) and these statutes. For instance, under ยง 21-6313, \na person can be designated a โcriminal street gang memberโ if he or she โ(D) frequents a particular \ncriminal street gangโs area; (E) adopts such gangโs style of dress, color, use of hand signs or tattoos; \n[or] (F) associates with known criminal street gang members,โ just to name a few.72  These \nprovisions are at the heart of Plaintiffsโ vagueness challenge, but Defendants fail to suggest how \neither statute parallels these particular provisions, and thus why the Court should dismiss the \nvagueness claim out of hand.   \n \n69 Id. at 892 (emphasis removed).  \n70 Giaccio v. Pennsylvania, 382 U.S. 399, 402 (1966). See also Sessions v. Dimaya, 138 S.

For instance, in \nUnited States v. Vega,75 the Ninth Circuit upheld the probation condition prohibiting the defendant \nfrom associating โwith any member of any criminal street gang as directed by the Probation \nOfficer, specifically, any member of the Harpys street gangโ against a vagueness challenge.โ76  \nThe court there relied on precedent specific to the probation context, in which the Supreme Court \nreasoned that the word โassociationโ in parole restrictions did not apply to โincidental contacts.โ77  \nBy contrast, there is no such limiting construction yet applied to โassociatesโ under ยง 21-6313.  \nAnd Plaintiffs allege that they have been put on the Gang List precisely for incidental contacts \nwith friends and family members.  The court in Vega further relied on the fact that the probation \nrestriction was limited by reference to a particular gang.78  This also is not present in the language \nof subsection (F). The cases cited by Defendants are thus inapposite.  \n \n73 See, e.g., United States v. Green, 618 F.3d 120 (2d Cir. 2010); United States v.

Their motion as to that Count is denied.  \n  2.  Procedural Due Process โ Count III \n  The Fourteenth Amendment states that โ[n]o state shall . . . deprive any person of life, \nliberty, or property, without due process of law.โ79  The Supreme Court has identified two unique \ndue process rights under this Amendment: procedural due process and substantive due process.80  \nA plaintiffโs claim that he or she has been denied procedural due process requires a two-step \ninquiry: โ(1) did the individual possess a protected interest such that the due process protections \nwere applicable; and, if so, then (2) was the individual afforded an appropriate level of process.โ81 \n  The three interests explicitly protected by the Due Process Clause are โlife, liberty, [and] \nproperty.โ82  Individual Plaintiffs make no claim that their interests in life or property are at stake.  \nRather, each individual Plaintiff believes his liberty interest in his โgood name, reputation, honor, \nor integrityโ is in the crosshairs because of a โbadge of infamyโ pinned on him by Defendantsโ \ninclusion of his name on the Gang List.83  In so arguing, Plaintiffs invoke doctrine commonly \nreferred to as โstigma plus.โ84  To show an affected liberty interest under the stigma plus doctrine, \na Plaintiff must show that: โ(1) the government made a statement about him or her that is \nsufficiently derogatory to injure his or her reputation, that is capable of being proved false, and \n \n79 U.S. Const. amend.

This statement is clearly capable of \nbeing proved false, and each Plaintiff assets that it is false.  The question, then, is whether the \nstatement  that  a  person  is  a  gang  member  is  โsufficiently  derogatory  to  injure  his  or  her \nreputation.โ86  The Court is inclined to agree with the several other courts who have considered \nthis question and answered it in the affirmative.87  In particular, the Court is persuaded that \ndesignation as a gang member inescapably implies that a person is involved, at least in some \ncapacity, with criminal activity,88 which is generally recognized as defamatory per se under \nrelevant state law.89  Further, Plaintiffs plausibly allege that the Gang List is made sufficiently \npublic to injure their reputations.  They allege not only that the list was shared within various local, \nstate, and federal law enforcement agencies, but that it was also distributed to other parts of the \nlocal and federal government, as well as to potential employers, landlords, and licensing agents of \nPlaintiffs.  Thus, Plaintiffs plausibly allege the government defamation element of stigma plus.  \n \n85 Id. (quoting Paul v.

And they \nallege they cannot wear certain clothes or colors because of feared renewal on the Gang List and \nincreased surveillance from law enforcement.  Assuming these allegations are true, the Gang List \ndesignation has the effect of restricting Plaintiffsโ ability to do significant things that they \notherwise have the right to do freely.  These tangible consequences of being on the Gang List \nrefute Defendantsโ contention that Plaintiffs only suffer โreputational harmโ under Paul because \nof their inclusion on the list.  Plaintiffs thus satisfy the โstigma plusโ test and have plausibly alleged \nthat they have been deprived of a protected liberty interest by Defendantsโ actions.  \n  Moving to the second part of the procedural due process inquiry, the Court is required to \nconsider whether the government provided the appropriate level of process for the deprivation of \nthe plaintiffโs protected interest.93  Process due is typically some form of notice and an opportunity \nto be heard, though the level of each depends on the demands of a particular situation.94  The \nbalance of certain enumerated factors aids in making this determination,95 but the Court need not \nengage in such an inquiry at this time.  Plaintiffs allege that they were provided with no procedures, \nno notice or opportunity to be heard, before or after being added to the Gang List.

Substantive Due Process โ Count IV \n  Substantive  due  process  under  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  guarantees  that  โcertain \ndeprivations wonโt take place without a sufficient justification.โ97  The Supreme Court has \ncautioned against nonchalant application and expansion of this area of law, often called โmurkyโ \nby courts attempting to apply it,98 โbecause guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this \nunchartered area are scarce and open-ended.โ99 Still, precedent instructs that this Court begin \nanalysis of a substantive due process claim by making a โ โcareful descriptionโ of the allegedly \nviolated right.โ100 \n  Plaintiffs helpfully offer a laundry list of what they call โsignificant deprivations of life, \nliberty, and propertyโ visited upon them because of Defendantsโ policies and conduct.101  These \nare: \n1.  frequent, prolonged, intrusive, and hostile encounters with law enforcement; \n2.  unreasonable searches of property; \n3.  unjustified arrests; \n4.  unwarranted online and in-person surveillance; \n5.  identification by and increased attention from WPD officers using โSignal 33โ; \n6.  allegations of gang membership in arrest affidavits and news media; \n7.  increased bail leading to prolonged imprisonment and financial hardship; \n8.  severely restrictive probation, pretrial release, and parole conditions; \n9.  re-arrest,  detention,  and  incarceration  for  violations  of  restrictive  release \nconditions; \n10. diminished plea offers in connection with criminal charges; \n \n97 Browder v.

After this careful determination \nof the rights at play, the Court must determine whether these rights count as โfundamental,โ or \nโobjectively, deeply rooted in this Nationโs history and tradition.โ103  Even with fundamental rights \nthough, โ[w]here a particular Amendment โprovides an explicit textual source of constitutional \nprotectionโ against a particular sort of government behavior, โthat Amendment, not the more \ngeneralized notion of substantive due process, must be the guide for analyzing these claims.โ โ104 \n  It  is  here  that  Plaintiffsโ  substantive  due  process  claim  falls  short.

The Supreme Court has recognized a few narrowly defined fundamental \nrights under the rubric of privacy, such as โthose relating to marriage, family life, child rearing, \nand reproductive choices.โ108  But police surveillance and attention are poles apart from the \naforementioned rights, and the Court would be straying far from the basic guideposts in this area \nby recognizing a fundamental right to be free from unwanted police surveillance and attention.  \nAnd to the extent such surveillance and attention is believed to implicate a search under the \nmeaning of the Fourth Amendment, naturally it should be examined under the framework of that \namendment rather than the more generalized notion of substantive due process.  \n  The sixth, twelfth and thirteenth items on Plaintiffsโ list do not implicate a fundamental \nright that is โobjectively, deeply rooted in this Nationโs history and tradition.โ109  Those items \nconcern the publication of Plaintiffsโ status as gang members to various entities, which Plaintiffs \nbelieve resulted in losses of employment, educational, and licensing opportunities.

Plaintiffsโ complaints \nabout restrictive pretrial release and probation conditions, as well as diminished plea offers and \nprejudicial introduction of evidence of their membership on the Gang List, do not implicate a \nfundamental right.  While Plaintiffs urge the Court to conclude that Due Process is implicated in \nthese contexts, the only support they offer for this position are two cases in which prisoners were \nsubjected to โdeprivations of liberty which are not among those generally authorized by [their] \nconfinement.โ110  The Court does not fathom how Plaintiffsโ situation is at all similar to that present \nin those cases.  Further, Plaintiffsโ claim that they suffered โincreased bailโ seems to fit more \nappropriately under the Eighth Amendmentโs prohibition on โexcessive bail,โ if in fact Plaintiffs \nclaim the bail set in their individual cases was excessive.111  Finally, Plaintiffsโ claims regarding \ntheir ability to associate with whom they want and express themselves in the way they choose are \nmore appropriately analyzed under the First Amendment, as Plaintiffs seem to recognize, having \nraised these claims separately.   \nIn sum, Plaintiffs ask this Court, throughout their substantive due process claim, to leave \nbehind the โguideposts for responsible decisionmakingโ112 staked out by the Supreme Court and \n \n110 DeShaney v.

Plaintiffs do so without even an inkling of discussion of why these purported rights are \ndeeply rooted in our Nationโs history and tradition, nor why the Court should not be hesitant to \nexpansively recognize fundamental rights when the Supreme Court itself has been extremely \ncautious in doing so.113  Plaintiffs also prefer to vindicate their allegedly violated rights through \nthe rubric of substantive due process rather than the more specific standards applicable to those \nrights.  The Court declines to join Plaintiffs on this ill-thought-out journey.  Count IV is dismissed.  \n  4.   Equal Protection โ Count V \nPlaintiffsโ  Equal  Protection  claim  alleges  that  the  Gang  List  and  Defendants \nimplementation thereof constitute discrimination because of each Plaintiffโs race and national \norigin.  The Equal Protection Clause under the Fourteenth Amendment provides that โ[n]o state \nshall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.โ114  This is \nโessentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike,โ115 whether by \nlegislation or the conduct of state actors.116  An equal protection claim proceeds in two steps.  First, \nthe Court asks โwhether the challenged state action intentionally discriminates between groups of \n \n113 See Does v.

Discriminatory intent requires that โthat \nthe decisionmaker . . . selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part โbecause \nof,โ not merely โin spite of,โ its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.โ120  Though this intent \nmay be proved circumstantially based on an inference from the relevant facts,121 evidence of the \nracially disproportionate impact of a particular government policy or course of conduct will not, \nstanding alone, satisfy the requirement that the official action was taken with a discriminatory \nintent.122  โDisproportionate impact is not irrelevant, but it is not the sole touchstone of an invidious \nracial discrimination forbidden by the Constitution.โ123 \nPlaintiffs contend they have plausibly alleged Defendantsโ discriminatory intent with \nrespect to the Gang List.  The Complaint alleges that Defendants created the Gang List โto track \nand surveil Black and Latinx neighborhoods,โ that Defendantsโ policing focuses on communities \nof color, and that persons of color on the list are subject to more severe surveillance and \npunishment than white persons on the list.124  These allegations, however, do not plausibly allege \n \n117 SECSYS, LLC, 666 F.3d at 685 (citations omitted).  \n118 Ashaheed, 7 F.4th at 1250 (citations omitted).  \n119 See Free the Nipple-Fort Collins v.

Because these allegations are not entitled to the presumption of truth, the \nCourt disregards them and examines Plaintiffsโ remaining factual allegations to determine if they \nplausibly state an equal protection claim.  \nPlaintiffsโ remaining allegations solely concern the alleged discriminatory impact of the \nGang List.  In particular, they cite a 2008 study finding that Black and Latinx persons formed an \noutsized proportion of the Gang List as compared to their respective shares of the general \npopulation of Wichita.125  Even assuming this is true, allegations of the discriminatory impact of a \nparticular policy are not enough, standing alone, to state an equal protection claim.  Because \nPlaintiff fails to plausibly allege a discriminatory intent behind the Gang List, the Court need not \ntest it against one of the tiers of scrutiny.  Count V is dismissed for failure to state a claim.  \nC.  First Amendment Claims \n  1.  Freedom of Expression โ Counts VI & VII \n  Plaintiffs bring a variety of claims that their right to freedom of speech under the First \nAmendment has been restricted by ยง 21-6313 and Defendantsโ policies with respect to the Gang \nList.  Plaintiffs believe ยง 21-6313(b)(2)(E) directly prohibits expressive conduct because a person \ncan be added or renewed on the Gang List, at least in part, because he or she โadopts such gangโs \nstyle of dress, color, use of hand signs or tattoos.โ  This, Plaintiffs allege, directly prohibits and \nchills speech, and is facially overbroad to boot, as evidenced by Plaintiff Elbert Costelloโs renewal \non the Gang List simply because he was wearing a red Philadelphia Phillies hat.   \n \n125 Id. at ยถ 7 (citing Gregg W. Etter Sr & Warren G. Swymeler, Examining the Demographics of Street Gangs \nin Wichita, Kansas, 16 J. of Gang Rsch, at 7โ8 (2008)).   \n-34- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 28   Filed 01/10/22   Page 35 of 39\nBefore diving into these related claims, the Court must address a threshold issue in First \nAmendment cases involving expressive conduct or โsymbolic speech,โ rather than written or \nverbal expression.126  Namely, does the plaintiffโs conduct actually constitute protected speech \nunder the First Amendment? A necessary element to transform conduct into protected speech is \nthat the plaintiff had the โintent to convey a particularized message.โ127  It is in addressing this \nelement that the Court concludes this issue, though framed under the First Amendment, is actually \na different species of the procedural due process claim discussed above.  \n  In theory, there are two possible messages Elbert could have been intending to convey by \nwearing his Phillies hat.  He could have been trying to communicate โI like the Philadelphia \nPhillies and think they are an excellent baseball team.โ  And if this is the case, Defendantsโ decision \nto renew his Gang List designation on this basis was not a punishment based on his communicated \nmessage.  There is no allegation that Defendants intend to place persons on the Gang List simply \nbecause they are Phillies fans.  Rather, if this was Elbertโs message in wearing the Phillies cap, \nDefendants made a mistake about his message, and Elbertโs grievance centers around the lack of \nopportunity to challenge the grounds underlying the renewal of his designation as a gang member. \nThis, of course, is a feature of procedural due process.    \nThe second possible message Elbert may have been trying to convey by wearing the hat is \nโI am a gang member.โ  This is certainly the message Defendants understood Elbert to convey.  \nBut this is foreclosed by Elbertโs own statements, accepted as true at this stage, that he is not, and \n \n126 See, e.g., Tinker v.

Accordingly, this cause of action, though brought under the First \nAmendment, is merely a facet of Plaintiffsโ procedural due process claim.  \n  2.   Freedom of Association โ Counts VI & VII \n  The First Amendment does not explicitly enumerate the right to freedom of association, \nbut the Supreme Court has held that it protects such a right in certain circumstances.128  Among \nthese are the right to โenter into and maintain certain intimate human relationships,โ129  including \nโfamily relationships, which by their nature, involve deep attachments and commitments to the \nnecessarily few other individuals with whom one shares not only a special community of thoughts, \nexperiences, and beliefs but also distinctly personal aspects of oneโs life.โ130  The First Amendment \nalso protects the โright to associate for the purpose of engaging in those activities protected by the \nFirst Amendmentโspeech, assembly, petition for the redress of grievances, and the exercise of \nreligion.โ131  Government action that restricts a personโs ability to associate in these ways must \nface strict judicial scrutiny.132  Even beyond direct restrictions of these associational rights, First \nAmendment protections are triggered by โ[t]he risk of a chilling effect on association โbecause \nFirst Amendment freedoms need breathing space to survive.โ โ133 \n  Plaintiffs allege that both of the above associational rights are directly restricted and chilled \nby ยง 21-6313 and Defendantsโ policies.  To be clear, Plaintiffs do not allege that statutes and \n \n128 City of Dallas v. Stanglin, 490 U.S. 19, 23 (1989).  \n129 Roberts v. U.S. Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 617โ18 (1984). \n130 Trujillo v.

Rather, they contend that the unavoidable effect of the statute and policies is \nto keep them from exercising their associational rights.  Several criteria allowing designation as a \nโcriminal street gang memberโ under ยง 21-6313 involve associations with other known criminal \nstreet gang members.134  The individual Plaintiffs each allege that these criteria have kept them \nfrom associating with family, or resulted in their punishment if they have, because either they \nfeared having their own designation as a gang member renewed because their family members \nwere already on the Gang List, or because they did not want their family members to end up on \nthe List because they associated with Plaintiffs.  Further, Progeny alleges it is restricted from \nholding town halls for the purpose of getting community members involved with its mission of \nadvocating for change in the juvenile criminal justice system because the criteria of ยง 21-6313, \nand Defendants application thereof, will create the risk that such a gathering will cause attendees \nto either be designated as gang members or have an already existing designation renewed.  \n  Defendants  contend  that  these  are  restrictions  are  self-imposed  choices  and  do  not \nautomatically follow from the application of ยง 21-6313.  The individual Plaintiffs choose not to \nassociate with their family members, and Progeny chooses not to host town halls.  This, they \nbelieve, does not implicate the First Amendment.  But contrary to Defendantsโ description, the \nsituation alleged by Plaintiffs does not present Plaintiffs with much of a choice.  That choice is \nbetween seeing their family members and subjecting those individuals and themselves to the \nconsequences of being on the Gang List or foregoing such association and sparing themselves and \ntheir families the consequences.  The First Amendment protects individuals from being forced by \n \n134 See K.S.A. ยง 21-6313(b)(2)(F), (I).  \n-37- \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 28   Filed 01/10/22   Page 38 of 39\nthe government to make choices such as this.135  Thus, Plaintiffs state a plausible claim for relief \nthat that their associational rights are restricted by ยง 21-6313 and Defendantsโ related policies.  \nD.  Claims Against Chief Ramsay and Lieutenant Beard in Their Official Capacities \n  Defendants ask the Court to dismiss the suits against Chief Ramsay and Lieutenant Beard \nin their official capacities.  Official capacity suits โgenerally represent only another way of \npleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an agent.โ136  If the government entity \nreceives notice and an opportunity to respond, the suit is essentially treated as one against the \nentity.137  This Court has previously dismissed official capacity suits as redundant when the \ngovernment entity is itself a party.138  Plaintiffs urge the Court not to do so here, citing the doctrine \nof Ex parte Young, which permits suits against state officers in their official capacities to enjoin \naction violative of federal law.139  So it does.  But it does not require official capacity suits to be \nheard alongside suits against the government entity itself.

Municipal Liability \n  Defendant City of Wichita contends that it may not be held liable under Monell v. New \nYork City Department of Social Services.140  In that case, the Supreme Court held:  \n[A] local government may not be sued under ยง 1983 for an injury inflicted solely \nby its employees or agents. Instead, it is when execution of a governmentโs policy \nor custom, whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may \nfairly be said to represent official policy, inflicts the injury that the government as \nan entity is responsible under ยง 1983.141   \nPlaintiffs do not allege they were injured solely by the employees or agents of the City.  Rather, \nthey allege its official policy creating and maintaining the Gang List causes them ongoing injury.  \nThe City is therefore a proper defendant under Monell and ยง 1983.  \nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Defendantsโ Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 14) is \nGRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nCounts II, IV, and V are dismissed.

This is an action under the U.S. Constitution and 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 challenging the \nconstitutionality of K.S.A. 21-6313, et seq., and the City of Wichitaโs maintenance and use, \nthrough its police department, of a discriminatory, erroneous, harmful, and unconstitutional Gang \nList to unlawfully track, surveil, prosecute, and punish large swaths of the Wichita community \nunder the guise of public safety.  \n2.  The WPDโs1 practices and policies surrounding its Gang List disproportionately \ntarget and harm individuals and communities of color and violate the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution. \n3.  The WPD maintains the Gang List pursuant to K.S.A. 21-6313 and WPD Policy \n527, a true and correct copy of which is incorporated as Exhibit A.  \n4.  Police officers within the WPDโs Gang Unit routinely exercise unilateral and \nvirtually unchecked power to designate individual Wichita residents as โgang membersโ or โgang \nassociatesโ based on scant and unreliable evidence, or, indeed, no evidence at all. K.S.A. 21-6313 \nand WPD Policy 527 do not require that a person be convicted of a crime, charged with a crime, \nor even suspected of being involved in criminal activity in order to be designated as a gang member \nor gang associate. The WPD continuously tracks the individuals it designates as gang members or \nassociates, and even tracks constitutionally protected activity.  \n5.  Adult individuals placed on the Gang List are provided no notice of their inclusion \non the list, or what prompted that inclusion, nor do they have the opportunity to challenge such \ndesignation either under the terms of the statute or as it is applied in practice. Because there are no \n                                                 \n1 The City of Wichita acts, with respect to its use and maintenance of the Gang List, through its governmental sub-\nunit the WPD, and the WPDโs divisions and units; thus, Plaintiffsโ references to the WPD or its Gang Unit \nencompass allegations against the City. \n2 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 3 of 62\nprovisions within the WPD policies to remove anyone from the Gang List, those listed remain \nbranded as gang members or associates for life, even if they never come into contact with the \ncriminal justice system.  \n6.  Inclusion on the Gang List subjects an individual to a wide range of severe civil \nand criminal consequences, including enhanced bail and probation and parole terms, limited plea \nopportunities,  extreme  prejudice  at  criminal  trials,  widespread  reputational  harm,  denial  of \nassociative and assembly rights, and discrimination in housing, licensing, and employment.  \n7.   The Gang List is discriminatory in that it targets primarily Black and Brown \nindividuals: the overwhelming majority of those listed are Black or Latinx, despite those groups \nrepresenting only a small minority of the greater Wichita community. The racial disparities in the \nmakeup of the Gang List, and the geographic concentration of those listed, demonstrate that the \nWPD is explicitly targeting minority communities for its gang enforcement work, in violation of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment. For instance, Black residents make up only 10.9% of Wichitaโs \npopulation, but comprise 60% of Wichitaโs Gang List. Latinx individuals account for only 17.2% \nof Wichitaโs population, but make up 25% of the Gang List. In contrast, White residents make up \n62.8% of Wichitaโs population, but account for only 6% of the Gang List.2  \n8.  Upon information and belief, WPD officers include on the Gang List a small \nnumber of certain โbiker groupsโ and โwhite supremacistsโ comprised mainly of white individuals, \nbut do not make the same efforts to surveil those individuals, nor to categorize the individuals they \nassociate with as gang members or gang associates. While all of those listed on the Gang List are \n                                                 \n2 See U.S. Census Bureau, QuickFacts: Wichita city, Kansas, https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/wichitacitykansas \n(accessed Apr. 5, 2021); Gregg W. Etter Sr. & Warren G. Swymeler, Examining the Demographics of Street Gangs \nin Wichita, Kansas, 16 Journal of Gang Research, at 7-8 (2008). \n3 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 4 of 62\nharmed by the lack of procedural and substantive due process, the statute and the WPD policies \nare used to disproportionately target racial minorities. \n9.  These staggering racial disparities are the product of unconstitutionally vague and \nprocedurally deficient policies codified in K.S.A. 21-6313 and implemented in WPD Policy 527.  \n10.  K.S.A. 21-6313 is unconstitutionally vague. K.S.A. 21-6313 sets out ten criteria for \nlaw enforcement to consider when determining whether an individual may be designated as a street \ngang member or associate under Kansas law. A person need only meet three of these ten criteria \nto be considered a criminal street gang โmemberโ under the statute. K.S.A. 21-6313(b)(2). Even \nworse, a person need only fulfill two of the ten criteria to qualify as a criminal street gang \nโassociateโ under the statute. K.S.A. 21-6313(d)(2). There is no meaningful distinction between \nthe label of member or associateโthe consequences that flow from either designation are the same. \nThe criteria to qualify as a gang member or associate are vague and broad, and encompass a wide \nrange of innocuous, innocent, and constitutionally protected behavior. The criteria include:  \n๏ง  Frequenting a particular criminal street gangโs area \n๏ง  Wearing a criminal street gangโs color \n๏ง  Associating with criminal street gang members \n๏ง  Being identified as a criminal street gang member by a law enforcement officer \n๏ง  Being identified as a criminal street gang member by โphotographs or other \ndocumentationโ and \n๏ง  Being  identified  as  a  criminal  street  gang  member  by  any  informant  โof \npreviously untested reliabilityโ where โsuch identification is corroborated by \nindependent information.โ \n \n11.  The WPDโs Policy 527 is a direct result of the unchecked and far-reaching authority \nthat K.S.A. 21-6313 grants to Kansas police departments. Under Policy 527, an individual may be \nnominated as a gang member or associate by any state, county, or city law enforcement or \ncorrectional officer and โwill be added to the Gang List if they meet the criteria defined in K.S.A. \n4 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 5 of 62\n21-6313.โ The statute provides no opportunity to challenge that nomination, no due process, and \nno process for removal from a Gang List. \n12.  K.S.A. 21-6313 does not define or limit what a police department can define as a \ngangโs โareaโ or โcolor,โ contains no parameters or exceptions regarding associating with gang \nmembers (e.g., for family, co-workers, classmates, etc.), and does not establish any standards or \ngrounds for identification of gang members by law enforcement or others, or for corroborating \nsuch identification.  \n13.  Under the statute, a person may be designated as a gang member or associate based \non tenuous connections or even a single contact with others so designated. A person may engage \nin behaviors or contacts meeting these criteria without knowing or having any way to avoid such \nconduct. The criteria of K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527 are so vague and expansive that the \nmajority of Wichita citizens, including most judges, lawyers, clergy, union members, and other \nprofessional and social service providers, could be discretionally designated as a gang member or \nassociate and added to the Gang List. Indeed, under the statute and policy, most WPD officers \nthemselves qualify as gang members. The criteria could encompass entire schools, neighborhoods, \nand communities where the WPD claim gang presence, thereby implicating anyone who lives or \nlearns there. Both the statute and policy are also written in such a way that anyone in Wichita \nwearing a gang โcolorโโsuch as red (Bloods), orange (Hoover Criminals), yellow (Latin Kings), \ngreen (Trinitarios), blue (Crips), or purple (Los Solidos)โalso meets half the criteria for being a \ngang associate. Thus, for a child attending a school in a โgang area,โ going to class in any one of \nthese colors permits a Wichita police officer to add that child to the Gang List without ever \nspeaking to the child.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 6 of 62\n14.  K.S.A. 21-6313 also offers police offices a single-criterion, fast-track loophole to \nadd an individual to the Gang List if that individual has โself-identifiedโ as a gang member or \nassociate. K.S.A. 21-6313(b)(1); K.S.A. 21-6313(d)(1). There is no requirement to corroborate \nsuch self-identification. Thus, K.S.A. 21-6313 effectively vests plenary authority to designate and \nbrand  โgang  membersโ  under  Kansas  law  in  the  hands  of  individual  police  officers  and \ndepartments like the WPD. \n15.  Once the WPD adds an individual to the Gang List, that individual is automatically \nsubject to enhanced monitoring and surveillance by Wichita police officers. Policy 527 prescribes \nfrequent records checks to identify Gang List designees and instructs certain members of the \nDepartmentโs Records Bureau to โnotify officers by use of Signal 33 [radio message consisting of \nthe number 33] if a records check reveals an individual is listed in the Wichita Police Department \ncomputer as a gang member or associate.โ  \n16.  Upon information and belief, a Signal 33 is communicated directly to an officer in \nthe field who calls in identifying information such as a license plate number or a driverโs license, \nand is understood to mean that the individual so identified is a gang member. \n17.  The information obtained through such Signal 33 notifications can then be used by \nofficers during the course of a traffic or street stop, even if the person stopped is unaware that they \nare on the Gang List. On information and belief, this results in officers approaching stopped \nindividuals identified through Signal 33 notifications in potentially more combative or escalating \nmanners, including with weapons drawn.  \n18.  Once a WPD officer adds a person to the Gang List, Wichita police officers are not \njust encouraged, but procedurally required, to intermittently monitor multiple facets of that \npersonโs daily life, including reviewing their social media accounts and running a โGoogle Searchโ \n6 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 7 of 62\non the individual. Upon information and belief, this procedural obligation is consistently carried \nout on persons of color on the Gang List, but not nearly to the same extent on white gang members \nand associates. \n19.  Further, Wichita police officers routinely target people currently on the Gang List, \nor those whom the Police Department would like to add to the Gang List, for traffic enforcement. \nIndividuals on the list report that WPD officers repeatedly watch, stop, search, harass, and \nintimidate them for engaging in noncriminal, innocent conduct. \n20.  Neither  K.S.A.  21-6313  nor  WPD  Policy  527  establishes  any  procedure  for \nproviding listed persons with notice or an opportunity to contest their designation on the Gang List \nas either a gang member or associate. On the contrary, Policy 527 states that the Gang List is \nโconfidentialโ and โwill only be released to commissioned law enforcement/correctional officersโ \nor those authorized by certain Department leaders.  \n21.  In only one circumstance does Policy 527 outline some sort of notice. This occurs \nwhen a juvenile meets the gang member or associate criteria under K.S.A. 21-6313. In this case, a \nDepartment supervisor โwill attempt to contact the parent and/or guardian of the juvenile,โ who \nโwill be told how the juvenile met the gang criteria and will be informed of intervention options \nand resources.โ However, Policy 527 requires only that there be an โattemptโ made to contact the \nparent or guardian, with no explanation of how extensive the โattemptโ should be.  \n22.  Meanwhile, for adults, neither Policy 527 nor K.S.A. 21-6313 provides any notice \nto those designated as gang members or associates.  \n23.  As a general matter, most individuals never know they are included in Wichitaโs \nGang List until it negatively affects them. Often, the first time a person becomes aware they are \non the Gang List occurs during a bond hearing or arraignment following his or her arrest when \n7 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 8 of 62\ninclusion on the Gang List is listed on the probable cause affidavit, a point at which it is too late \nto challenge his or her inclusion on the list before suffering harm. For both juveniles and adults \nwho know they are on the Gang List, there is no procedure to challenge the designation and demand \nremoval from the List.  \n24.  As a result of the surveillance and harassment that comes with being placed on the \nGang List, many individuals find it difficult to obtain or maintain jobs, access housing, or \nparticipate in various aspects of daily life. Members of the Wichita community have been afraid \nto leave their homes, interact with friends, or be around loved ones for fear of either being harassed \nby the WPD or placed or reinstated as active on the Gang List.  \n25.  When an individual is arrested on a person felony, the arresting officer is instructed \nto search the Gang List records for the arresteeโs name and to document the arresteeโs gang \nmember or associate status in an arrest affidavit. If the individual is listed on the Gang List and \narrested for a person felony, K.S.A 21-6316 mandates that judges set a cash or surety bail at a \nminimum of $50,000, regardless of the severity of the charge or the bond that would otherwise be \nappropriate. The only exception to this $50,000 minimum is if the reviewing court determines the \ndefendant is not likely to re-offend and the defendant agrees to submit to an โintensive pre-trial \nsupervision program.โ In such a case, designated WPD officers are then instructed to โmonitor \ndocumented gang members and associates for any violations of their probation/parole, bond, and \npretrial restrictions and will immediately report this to the proper supervising authorities with the \nintent of removing the offender from the community.โ \n26.  Once designated as a criminal street gang member or associate, an individual \nremains โactiveโ on the Gang List for a minimum of three years. If at any time during those three \nyears, the WPD document an individual engaging in a single criterion of K.S.A. 21-6313, the \n8 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 9 of 62\nthree-year period will start over. For instance, if a police officer observes a person on the Gang \nList wearing a particular โgang color,โ the police officer could extend the three-year period from \nthe date of that observation. Likewise, if the person has a documented โgang tattoo,โ then a police \nofficer could extend his or her three-year period if that person fails to conceal his or her tattoo, \nregardless of any actual ongoing gang affiliation.  \n27.  If an individual somehow manages to go three years without meeting any of the \nK.S.A.  21-6313โs  broad,  vague  criteria,  that  individualโs  Gang  List  status  is  changed  to \nโINACTIVEโโbut they are not removed from the Gang List. Indeed, Policy 527 provides no \nprocedure for any individual to ever be removed from the Gang List. The WPD agrees that there \nis no process by which an individualโs name is ever actually โremovedโ from the Gang List. \n28.  The result of the facial deficiencies and discretionary nature of K.S.A. 21-6313 and \nPolicy 527 is that Wichita Police place a large number of people, disproportionately people of \ncolor, on the Gang List each year without notice, without recourse, and in the absence of confirmed \nconnections between those individuals and criminal street gangs. Most of these individuals who \nare added to the Gang List have not been accused of, or charged with, criminal activity connected \nto a gang. \n29.  The  result  of  this  careless  and  unconstitutional  designation,  guided  by  an \nunconstitutionally vague and discretionary statute, is severe, ongoing, and  lifelong harm to \nindividuals included on the Gang List in violation of their constitutional rights. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n30.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffsโ claims pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. ยง 1331 because Plaintiffs seek a remedy under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง \n9 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 10 of 62\n2201 and 2202, this Court has jurisdiction to declare the rights of the parties, to grant injunctive \nrelief, and to grant all further relief deemed necessary and proper.  \n31.  Venue in this Court is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391. \nPARTIES \n32.  Organizational Plaintiff Progeny, a nonprofit organization in Wichita, Kansas, \noperates as a youth/adult partnership focused on reimagining the juvenile justice system and \nreinvesting in community-based alternatives.3 Progeny is run by a small executive staff and a team \nof Youth Leaders who help guide, shape, and execute the vision and mission of the organization. \nProgeny is an affiliate of Destination Innovations, Inc., a 501(c)(3) organization. \n33.  Progenyโs goals are to prevent incarceration of young people, to break the school-\nto-prison  pipeline,  and  to  direct  state  funds  into  community-based  programs  that  provide \nalternatives to incarceration.  \n34.  To fulfill its mission, Progeny hosts town halls, educates and works with members \nof the Kansas government, provides feedback to local and state leaders regarding their policy \npriorities, and organizes youth and community leaders around reform. Progeny also creates and \npublishes reports and other documents that translate youthsโ insights and needs into calls for \ngovernment action.  \n35.  Progeny seeks to empower young people who have come into contact with the \ncriminal justice system and provide these young people with counseling and support. Most of the \nyouth leaders for Progeny started out as young people who came up through its programs. \n36.  The WPDโs Gang List is completely contrary to Progenyโs mission and programs \nand directly impacts Progenyโs staff and youth leaders. Members of Progeny are on the Gang List, \n                                                 \n3 Progeny, Who We Are, https://www.progenyks.com/about-us.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 11 of 62\nand the existence of the Gang List makes it more difficult for Progeny to fulfill its mission and \nhelp Wichita youth who are involved in the justice system. Moreover, Progeny has had to divert \nresources away from its other work to provide assistance and resources to those who are suffering \nfrom the consequences of being on the WPDโs Gang List. \n37.  Plaintiff Christopher Cooper is a 26-year-old Black man residing in Wichita. He is \ncurrently listed as an โactiveโ gang member in the WPD Gang List. He has been on the Gang List \nsince at least 2015, when he was 18 years old. Mr. Cooper has suffered continuous harassment by \nDefendants, who routinely stop him for minor traffic violations. Upon information and belief, Mr. \nCooper has been denied employment of his choice because of Defendantsโ sharing of the Gang \nList with other entities. Mr. Cooper brings this action on behalf of himself and a class of similarly \nsituated individuals who are subjected to Defendantsโ unconstitutional actions connected to the \nGang List, and seeks injunctive and declaratory relief. \n38.   Plaintiff Elbert Costello is a 45-year-old Black man residing in Wichita, Kansas. \nHe is currently listed as an โactiveโ gang member on the WPD Gang List. He has been on the Gang \nList since at least 1997, when he was 22 years old. Mr. Costello has been continuously marked as \nโactiveโ on the Gang List because he gathers with friends his age, who are also on the Gang List. \nHe fears harassment or, worse, additional punishment, if he gets together with othersโincluding \nfamily membersโfor a beer, a barbecue, a family dinner, or a funeral. Mr. Costello brings this \naction on behalf of himself and a class of similarly situated individuals who are subjected to \nDefendantsโ  unconstitutional  actions  connected  to  the  Gang  List  and  seeks  injunctive  and \ndeclaratory relief. \n39.  Plaintiff Martel Costello is a 25-year-old Black man from Wichita. Mr. Martel \nCostello is incarcerated until 2025, currently in the Ellsworth Correctional Facility, because of a \n11 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 12 of 62\nprobation violation. Mr. Martel Costello was convicted of a marijuana offense and possession of \nfirearms. He learned he was on the Gang List for the first time when he was charged with these \ncrimes. He was released pre-trial and eventually sentenced to probation. While on probation, Mr. \nMartel Costello was forced to abide by certain special conditions  of probation, due to his \ndesignation as a gang member on WPDโs Gang List. These conditions included not having any \ncontact with any other known gang members, abiding by a strict curfew, and more. Mr. Martel \nCostello was repeatedly harassed by WPD while awaiting trial and while on probation, returned to \njail on several occasions due to alleged probation violations. Most notably, he was punished on \ntwo occasions for attending the funeral of a loved oneโfirst, his nieceโs funeral and later, his \nbrotherโs funeralโbecause other people listed on the WPDโs Gang List were also present. He was \nconsidered an active gang member on the WPD Gang List, but will be considered inactive as long \nas he is incarcerated. Once he is released, he will be considered an active gang member once again, \nand will again be subject to the extremely harsh gang conditions while on parole. He has been on \nthe Gang List since at least 2016. Mr. Martel Costello brings this action on behalf of himself and \na class of similarly situated individuals who are subjected to Defendantsโ unconstitutional actions \nconnected to the Gang List, and seeks injunctive and declaratory relief.  \n40.  Plaintiff  Jeremy  Levy,  Jr.  is  a  22-year-old  Black  man  from  Wichita.  He  is \nincarcerated until at least 2042, currently in the Hutchison Correctional Facility, because of a \nconviction of first-degree felony murder in 2017, when he was 18. Prior to being charged in that \ncase, Mr. Levy was listed on the WPDโs Gang List. Because of that, the prosecutor at his trial was \nallowed to introduce to the jury Mr. Levyโs alleged gang status and multiple alleged โgang \nincidentsโ of an alleged โgang feudโ for over six months prior to the alleged incident in which Mr. \nLevy was charged. There was no evidence that Mr. Levy had participated in those alleged gang \n12 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 13 of 62\nfeud events, nor any evidence that the incident with which Mr. Levy was chargedโwhich involved \nhim and another individualโwas gang-related. Mr. Levy is one of many individuals for whom \ntheir presence on the Gang List allows the prosecution to introduce irrelevant and prejudicial \ninformation at trial. Mr. Levy brings this action on behalf of himself and a class of similarly \nsituated individuals who are subjected to Defendantsโ unconstitutional actions connected to the \nGang List and seeks injunctive and declaratory relief. \n41.  Defendant the City of Wichita is a municipal government body within the state of \nKansas. The City is a โpersonโ within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \n42.  The City of Wichita is the largest city in Kansas, with a population of approximately \n389,965 people. It is run by a Mayor and a six-member City Council, which collectively conduct \nall legislative functions for the City and establish policies that are executed by the City Manager. \nThe City of Wichita has supervision over and responsibility for the WPD. \n43.  The WPD is a sub-unit of the City of Wichita municipal governmental body, \nresponsible for law enforcement activities within the City of Wichita. The WPD is the main law \nenforcement agency responsible for policing activities within the City of Wichita. It employs \nroughly 900 people in both civilian and sworn officer roles. \n44.  Defendant  Chief  Gordon  Ramsay,  in  his  official  capacity,  is  the  top  law \nenforcement officer within the WPD. He is responsible for the policies and procedures of the WPD, \ntheir use and maintenance, and the general oversight of the WPD. \n45.  Defendant Lieutenant Chad Beard, in his official capacity, is the Supervisor of the \nGang  Unit  within  the  WPD.  He  is  responsible  for  the  use  and  maintenance,  policies  and \nprocedures, and oversight of the Gang List. He reports directly to Deputy Chief Jose Salcido, \nInvestigations Division Commander, who reports to Chief Gordon Ramsay. \n13 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 14 of 62\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nUnconstitutionality of K.S.A. 21-6313 \n46.  K.S.A. 21-6313 defines โcriminal street gangโ and lays out the criteria that \nlaw enforcement agencies may use to designate someone a โcriminal street gang member.โ \nUnder 21-6313(b): \nโcriminal street gang memberโ is a person who: \n \n(1) Admits to criminal street gang membership; or \n(2) Meets three or more of the following criteria:  \n(A) Is identified as a criminal street gang member by a parent or guardian; \n(B) Is identified as a criminal street gang member by a state, county or city \nlaw enforcement officer or documented reliable informant; \n(C) Is identified as a criminal street gang member by an informant of \npreviously untested reliability and such identification is corroborated by \nindependent information; \n(D) Frequents a particular criminal street gangโs area; \n(E) Adopts such gangโs style of dress, color, use of hand signs or tattoos; \n(F) Associates with known criminal street gang members; \n(G) Has been arrested more than once in the company of identified criminal \nstreet  gang  members  for  offenses  which  are  consistent  with  usual \ncriminal street gang activity; \n(H) Is identified as a criminal street gang member by physical evidence \nincluding, but not limited to, photographs or other documentation; \n(I) Has  been  stopped  in  the  company  of  known  criminal  street  gang \nmember two or more times; or \n14 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 15 of 62\n(J) Has participated in or undergone activities self-identified or identified \nby a reliable informant as a criminal street gang initiation ritual.โ \n47.  WPD  Policy  527  was  drafted  to  be  consistent  with  K.S.A.  21-6313. \nHowever, the WPD had a functioning Gang List for decades before K.S.A. 21-6313 was \nenacted in 2006. Upon information and belief, the criteria in K.S.A. 21-6313 derived \nlargely from the criteria the WPD was already using, with the addition of K.S.A. 21-\n6313(b)(2)(J). After K.S.A. 21-6313 was enacted, however, the WPD went back and \naltered entries in its older records to conform with the statutory criteria listed in K.S.A. 21-\n6313. Thus, for those entries in the gang records prior to 2006, the entries may have been \naltered from what was there originally. \n48.  K.S.A. 21-6313 and WPD Policy 527 suffer from numerous constitutional \ndefects. For example, they provide no limitation on what type of clothing or paraphernalia \nmay satisfy the color criteria at K.S.A. 21-6313(b)(2)(E), permitting the WPD to identify \npeople as gang members, for example, if they wear certain professional sports team jerseys, \nschool uniforms, or common colors that they simply like. Further, there is no limit on or \nenumeration of which or how many colors may be considered gang-affiliated; as a result, \npeople are unable to conform their style of dress to K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527 to avoid \nbeing classified as gang members.  \n49.  As  another  example,  K.S.A.  21-6313  also  allows  the  WPD  to  place \nsomeone on the Gang List if that person is identified as a gang member by another law \nenforcement  officer.  Yet  there  is  no  limitation  or  process  required  for  such  an \nidentification, and no requirement that such an identification be verified or otherwise \ncorroborated in any way. Nor is there any requirement that the officer document the reasons \n15 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 16 of 62\nfor his or her belief that the individual is a gang member. Furthermore, there is no \nrequirement that a record of the name of the identifying officer be maintained, making it \nvirtually impossible to confirm or dispute the validity of any such identification. \n50.  There is no definition of โgang areaโ in either K.S.A. 21-6313 or WPD \nPolicy 527 and no way for an individual to know what that means in order to avoid such \nareas. \n51.  There is no way for an individual who is associating with another individual \nto know if that person is already on the Gang List; there is therefore no way for a person to \nknow whether or not they are meeting the criteria of K.S.A. 21-6313(b)(2)(F). \n52.  Under K.S.A. 21-6313(a), the WPD may place someone on the Gang List \nif the person self-identifies as a gang member. However, there is no requirement in policy \nor practice that a personโs โself-identificationโ as a gang member be verified. It is therefore \npossible for an officer to falsely claim that an individual admitted to being a gang member \nand place them on the list as a result.  \n53.  There is no way to know who is on the Gang List, no requirement for \nnotification that a person has been listed, no way to challenge the designation, and no way \nto be removed from the Gang List.  \n54.  These  almost  infinitely  broad  criteria  allowโeven  inevitably  causeโ\nrampant  discrimination  and  other  unconstitutional  practices  in  law  enforcement \napplication.  \n55.  This is borne out by the racial distribution of the Wichita Gang List itself. \nBased on information provided publicly by the WPD, there are currently 1,833 Active \nGang Members, 298 Associate Gang Members, and 239 Deceased Gang Members listed \n16 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 17 of 62\nin the Gang List. The racial disparities of membership on the list are stunning: 60% Black, \n25% Latinx, 9% other racial minorities such as Asian and Indigenous Peoples, and only \n6% White. \n56.  The statutory criteria included in K.S.A. 21-6313 are so broad and vague \nthat they are incapable of putting people on notice that their conduct or style of dress may \nresult in them being labeled a gang member. People are therefore unable to conform their \nconduct to avoid the consequences of meeting the statutory criteria and being placed on the \nGang List. \n57.  The consequences of being named in the Gang List are severe. They range \nfrom being denied employment, housing, and licenses; to being frequently surveilled and \nharassed; to having a high bail amount assessed upon arrest and exceedingly harsh \nprobation and parole conditions; to having irrelevant and prejudicial evidence admitted at \ntrial; to experiencing harsher and longer incarceration conditions.  \nUnconstitutionality of WPD Policy 527 \n58.  The WPDโs maintenance and use of a Gang List is governed by Kansas state \nlaw and WPD policy.  \n59.  WPD Policy No. 527 identifies procedures for how the WPD administers \nthe Gang List. Members of the WPDโs Gang/Felony Assault Section or Violent Crimes \nCommunity  Response  Team  are  responsible  for  monitoring  and  documenting  gang \nmembers in accordance with WPD Policy No. 527. \n60.  Virtually all of the criteria for identification as a criminal street gang are \nnon-criminal,  lawful  activities.  Many  of  these  criteriaโincluding  those  regarding \nassociation,  expression,  or  movement  within  the  communityโare  protected  First \nAmendment activities. \n17 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 18 of 62\n61.  The criteria that WPD officers use to determine gang affiliation are almost \nentirely unrelated to actual criminal conduct or active participation in gang activities.  \n62.  According to the WPD Gang Unit Supervisor, certain colors and symbols \nare associated with gangs. The WPD will consider individuals wearing these colors or \nsymbolsโincluding clothing associated with certain professional sports teamsโto be \nwearing a โgang style of dress or colorโ sufficient to meet the criteria listed in K.S.A. 21-\n6313.  \n63.  Upon information and belief, the WPD has a practice of falsely indicating \nthat individuals self-admitted to gang membership when entering them into the Gang List \nwithout corroboration of the admission, particularly when the officer cannot substantiate \nthe individualโs gang membership. This practice was documented in a video news story by \nWichitaโs KSN TV in May 2012. In the video, available on YouTube,4 two officers of the \nWPDโs Gang Unit are shown conducting a traffic stop because a passenger is not wearing \na seatbelt. After speaking with the men inside the car, an officer claims that the passenger \nself-identified as a gang member and appears to add the man to the Gang List on the spot. \nIn response to KORA requests, the WPD has refused to disclose statistics or information \nregarding the bases for including individuals on its Gang List, obscuring the full extent of \nthis practice. \n64.  The WPD frequently add people to the Gang List merely because such \npeople are related to, work with, or attend school with someone already on the Gang List. \nEven a single interaction with someone already on the Gang List may lead to an individual \nbeing designated a gang member or associate. Again, the WPDโs refusal to disclose its \n                                                 \n4\n Wichita Police Work to Slow Gang Violence - KSN TV, YouTube (May 10, 2012), \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUhRPu2Chao. Documented traffic stop begins at 2:48. \n18 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 19 of 62\nbases for including individuals on the Gang Listโeven as aggregate dataโobscures the \nfull extent of this practice.  \n65.  Individuals  can  be  included  on  the  Gang  List  merely  because  they \nโassociateโ with other people listed on the Gang List. This can include classmates, co-\nworkers, or even family members. \n66.  According to the WPDโs Standard Operating Procedure for Entries into the \nGang List, a person can be added to the Gang List as a โcriminal street gang associateโ if \nhe or she only meets two criteria listed in K.S.A. 21-6313, rather than the three criteria \nrequired to be listed as a โmember.โ \n67.  In practice, WPD officers often include individuals in the Gang List without \nany justification or evidence proving that they are in fact members of street gangs. \n General Parameters of the WPD Gang List \n68.  Pursuant to WPD Policy No. 527, if a WPD officer identifies a person for \ninclusion in the Gang List based on the criteria in K.S.A. 21-6313, the person will be listed \nin the Gang List as โactiveโ for a minimum of three years. If a person is listed as active, \nand then later becomes incarcerated, that person will be returned to active status upon \nrelease from custody.  \n69.  If a person is listed in the Gang List as active, but has โno documented \nactivityโ for three years, the personโs status will be changed to โinactive.โ However, \npursuant to WPD policy, the three-year period will start over if the person meets the criteria \nlisted in K.S.A. 21-6313, is involved in โcriminal street gang activity,โ or if there is  \nโdocumentation of criminal street gang member or associate criteria.โ \n70.  This means two things. First, a person can be listed in the Gang List for \nrelatively  innocuous  behavior,  such  as  wearing  a  particular  color,  appearing  in  a \n19 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 20 of 62\nphotograph with someone else listed on the Gang List, and/or living in a community with \nknown gang members. And second, once a person is listed in the Gang List, in order to be \nplaced as โinactive,โ that person would have to refrain from meeting a single Gang List \ncriteria for a three-year period. A person included on the Gang List for any reason would \nhave to avoid wearing any gang color, being seen or photographed with anyone on the \nGang List, and potentially move from his or her community to avoid being accused of \nโfrequenting a particular criminal street gangโs area.โ \n71.  For this reason, the WPD rarely moves people from โactiveโ to โinactiveโ \non the Gang List.  \n72.  Instead, people can remain on the Gang List for decades based on what they \nwear, whom they live near, whom they are related to, and myriad other examples of \ninnocent behavior.  \n73.  Elbert Costello, for example, has been on the Gang List for several decades. \nAlthough he is in his mid-40s and has children of his own, he is still friends with people \nfrom high school on the Gang List, and is therefore still labeled as a gang member. He is \nstill subject to surveillance and harassment and often has to endure needless and invasive \ntraffic stops. And his designation as a gang member is routinely extended for an additional \nthree years because of what he is wearing or whom he is seen with. In March 2021, Mr. \nCostelloโs placement on the Gang List as an active gang member was extended until March \n2024 because he was observed by WPD officers wearing a red โPhilliesโ hat in a photo on \nFacebook. \n74.  Other individuals on the Gang List have been pulled over by Wichita Police \nofficers while driving with their families and have had those officers refer to them by old \n20 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 21 of 62\nnicknames listed in the Gang List. These nicknames, like the individuals themselves, need \nnot have ever been gang-related in order for the individual to be included on the Gang List. \nThese individuals are now grown adults with children and grandchildren, having long left \nbehind adolescent nicknames and personas. Those individuals report feeling humiliated \nand degraded by the WPDโs insistence that they are gang members and by the WPDโs \nreference to them as gang members in front of their grandchildren.  \nLack of Notice and Ability to Contest Gang Membership  \n75.  The WPD provides no notice to the vast majority of people when they are \nfirst listed in the Gang List, provides no ongoing notice to anyone who is added or removed \nfrom the Gang List, and provides no notice to anyone who is moved from โinactiveโ back \nto โactive.โ \n76.  Many individuals find out they are on the list for the first time when they \napply for and are denied employment, housing, or licenses based on being on the Gang \nList, or when they are arrested or charged with a crime. \n77.  WPD Policy No. 527 does not include any provisions related to these vital \ncomponents of due process, with the sole exception being that the WPD will โattempt to \ncontactโ the parent or guardian of any juvenile listed in the Gang List. \n78.  Upon information and belief, however, the WPD does not in practice \ncontact the parents or guardians of juveniles when they are listed in the Gang List. Rather, \nmost youth (and their parents) remain unaware they are on the Gang List. \n79.  Even if the WPD does notify a parent of a juvenile they are on the Gang \nList, the parent is not given any opportunity to contest their childโs inclusion. The letter the \nWPD sends informing the parents of the juvenileโs inclusion merely offers to provide the \nfamily with โintervention options and resources.โ \n21 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 22 of 62\n80.  For many juveniles, the first time they learn they are on the Gang List is \nwhen they are arrested and their inclusion on the Gang List is listed in the Probable Cause \nAffidavit for their arrest. \n81.  The WPD also provides no process for challenging oneโs inclusion on the \nGang List or requesting to be removed from the Gang List. WPD Policy No. 527 offers no \nprocess or procedure regarding removal or challenging the listing, and the WPD posts no \nother relevant policies or procedures on its website nor makes such policies or procedures \npublicly available or known.  \n82.  Even if there were a publicly available policy or procedure for contesting \ninclusion on the Gang List or requesting removal, members of the public would not be able \nto avail themselves of it because the WPD does not notify people when they are added to \nthe Gang List. \n83.  The WPD shares its Gang List with other local, state, and national law \nenforcement  agencies,  including  the  Kansas  Bureau  of  Investigation,  pursuant  to  a \nConfidentiality  and  Usage  agreement.  These  other  entities  may  have  notice  of  an \nindividualโs placement on the Gang List, even though the individual does not know he or \nshe is on the Gang List. \n84.  Upon information and belief, entities with whom this information is shared \nare often contacted for background checks by potential employers, landlords, or licensing \nagents. Disclosure of the information that an individual is considered a member of a \ncriminal street gang has a huge negative effect on that individualโs employment, housing, \nand licensing prospects. \n22 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 23 of 62\nTargeting Innocent, Constitutionally-Protected Activity \n85.  The WPD has a policy or practice of encouraging its officers to surveil \nparticular communities and groups in order to add people to the Gang List.  \n86.  In particular, members of the WPDโs Gang Unit are instructed to surveil \ncommunity membersโ social media accounts to find photographs of people with known \ngang members, patrol and stop individuals in particular communities to question them as \nto whether they might meet the criteria for inclusion in the Gang List, and use traffic stops \nto identify drivers or occupants who are currently listed or qualify to be added to the Gang \nList. \n87.   Community members and Plaintiffs have experienced repeated examples \nof being subjected to this surveillance and targeting by WPD officers who are interested in \nadding more people to the Gang List. \n88.  When WPD officers pull over a vehicle for a traffic infraction, they will \nradio in a โSignal 33โ to check whether the driver or passengers are listed in the Gang List. \nIf they are listed, WPD officers may interrogate the driver and passengers, threaten them, \nor attempt to get information out of them regarding gang activity. If some of the passengers \nare not listed, but others are, the WPD may use that as evidence that the non-listed \npassengers should be added to the Gang List. \n89.  WPD policies, including their Instructions for New Gang Intel Form, directs \nWPD officers to document all interactions for documented gang members so that the Gang \nUnit will have a running list of the โvehicles they drive and who they associate with.โ This \nform also instructs officers to โdocument new addresses, vehicles, girlfriends, phone \nnumbers, and hang out locations,โ which then allows the WPD to surveil and closely track \nthose individuals and their friends and family. \n23 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 24 of 62\n90.  The WPD also regularly monitors the social media accounts of community \nmembers to identify evidence that could be used to label individuals as gang members. \nWPD Standard Operating Procedures provides instructions for how officers can save \nimages and videos from Facebook and YouTube that meet one of the criteria listed in \nK.S.A. 21-6313.  \n91.  Upon  information  and  belief,  assignment  to the  WPDโs  Gang  Unit  is \nconsidered  a  desirable  job  and  a  promotion  from  the  street  patrol  position.  When \nconsidering officers to promote to positions within the Gang Unit, the WPD considers how \nwell the officer is able to identify individuals to be added to the Gang List, including the \nofficerโs ability to covertly identify community members through social media and track \ntheir postings and shared photographs.  \n92.  Upon information and belief, some WPD officers maintain fake social \nmedia profiles in order to befriend members of the community to more easily have access \nto photos and other information that would allow the officers to add more people to the \nGang List and qualify for promotion to the Gang Unit. \n93.  Upon information and belief, WPD officers often pull people over, tell them \nthat they โjust want to talk,โ and then ask them a series of leading questions in an attempt \nto collect enough information that would justify adding those individuals to the Gang List. \n94.  These practices profoundly affect how Plaintiffs interact with their friends \nand families and move about the community. Community members report that they cannot \nride in the car with certain friends or go to certain public places in their neighborhoods \nbecause they are afraid it will cause them to be labeled as a gang member. \n24 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 25 of 62\nIncreased Punishment as a Result of Inclusion on Gang List \n \n95.  Inclusion in the Gang List can have profound impacts on a personโs daily \nlife, especially if they become involved in the criminal justice system. \n96.  In particular, if a person is listed in the Gang List and charged with a person \nfelony (whether or not the charged felony is connected with any of the criteria for Gang \nList inclusion), state law mandates that bail be set at a minimum of $50,000. K.S.A. 21-\n6316. The only exception is if the judge makes a finding on the record that the defendant \nis not likely to reoffend and will be subject to intensive pretrial supervisionโwhich often \ncomes at great personal and financial cost.  \n97.  Conviction of certain offenses also carry higher sentences if the person \nconvicted is a โknown criminal street gang member.โ See, e.g., K.S.A. ยงยง 21-6804, 21-\n6301, 21-6315, 21-6811. \n98.  Upon information and belief, prosecutors in the Sedgwick County District \nAttorneyโs office will also use a personโs inclusion on the Gang List as a reason to offer \nless attractive plea offers. \n99.  When a person is on the Gang List and sentenced to probation or released \non parole, they must abide by specific special conditions, including the following:5 \na.  Not associating with anyone affiliated in a gang; \nb.  Not wearing any clothing with the primary color being red; \nc.  Abiding by a curfew from 9:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m.; \nd.  Not riding in a car with more than one person unless those people are \nsiblings, parents, or children; \n                                                 \n5 A true and correct copy of the Sedgwick County Department of Corrections Gang Conditions Attachment is \nprovided as Exhibit B to this complaint. \n25 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 26 of 62\ne.  Not engaging in โthrowing or showing gang hand signsโ; \nf.  Not associating with a family member or extended family member who \nis a documented gang member (exception being immediate family \nonlyโbrother, sister, or parents); and \ng.  Not using social media to post โstatements having any relationship to . \n. . any gang whatsoeverโ or posting any photos or images โthat can in \nany way be associated with . . . any gang.โ \n100.  Because many of these conditions are inherently vague, proscribe innocent, \nconstitutionally protected conduct, and significantly curtail peopleโs ability to live and \nmove freely in their communities, the gang conditions imposed on those listed on the \nWPDโs Gang List create a significant risk of probation or parole violations. \n101.  Being on the WPDโs Gang List therefore results in significantly more \npunitive restrictions on a personโs liberty while on probation or parole than individuals not \non the Gang List, and may result in an increased risk that the WPD or the Sedgwick County \nDepartment of Corrections will charge that person with a probation violation and revoke \ntheir community supervision. \nDisparate Impact on Minority Communities \n102.  The  racial  and  ethnic  makeup  of  those  listed  in  the  Gang  List  is \noverwhelmingly Black and Latinx.  \n103.  According to the most recent census data, only 10.9% of the greater Wichita \ncommunity is Black, and only 17.2% is Hispanic. \n104.  However, roughly 60% of those listed in the Gang List are Black, and over \n25% are Latinx.  \n26 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 27 of 62\n105.  It is clear that inclusion in the WPD Gang List disproportionately impacts \nBlack and Latinx communities, suggesting that the WPD systematically targets Black and \nBrown neighborhoods and community members for gang enforcement activities and \nsurveillance.  \nProgeny and its Members are Negatively Impacted by the Gang List \n106.  Progeny is an organization that seeks to assist individuals who are involved \nin the criminal-legal system and work towards reducing, and eventually eliminating, the \nmyriad harms caused by the juvenile justice system. For example, Progeny holds town \nhalls, facilitates conversations with impacted youth, provides support and services to youth \nwho are involved in the criminal legal system or transitioning back to the community, and \nengages with elected officials regarding their policies and reform efforts that may impact \nsystem-involved youth. The Gang List is a direct impediment to carrying out that mission, \nas it stigmatizes Progenyโs members and Youth Leaders and their families, and prevents \nProgeny from assisting individuals listed in the Gang List to move away from any criminal-\nlegal system involvement. \n107.  Many  of  Progenyโs  members  and  Youth  Leaders  have  been  directly \nimpacted by the Gang List; they are either listed themselves, or have family members and \nfriends who are listed in the Gang List. \n108.  Other Progeny members have experienced repeated harassment by WPD \nofficers, including being pulled over while on their way to school or work and questioned \nabout gang activity. \n109.  Plaintiff Mr. Elbert Costello is a member of Progeny and works with \nProgeny  staff  to  help  advance  Progenyโs  mission  of  juvenile  justice  reform  and \nreinvestment. As discussed elsewhere in this Complaint, Mr. Costello is listed as an active \n27 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 28 of 62\ngang member on the WPD Gang List. Other members of Progeny are or previously were \nlisted as gang members on the WPDโs Gang List and have suffered harassment and \nsurveillance by the WPD as a result. And, given the broad and vague criteria of K.S.A. 21-\n6313, many other members of Progeny likely meet the criteria for being labeled as gang \nmembers or associates, yet do not know whether or not they are included on the Gang List.  \n110.  Because associating with individuals listed on the Gang List is a criteria for \ndesignation as a gang member or associate, K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527 strongly \ndiscourage Progeny from holding meetings of any kind. Most individuals have no way of \nknowing whether they are included on the Gang Listโor whether others affiliated with \nProgeny are. Meeting in large groups or even one-on-one thus puts Progeny members at \nrisk of causing each other to be designated as gang members or associates by the WPD. \n111.  Even worse, for individuals whose inclusion on the Gang List is known (due \nto an arrest affidavit, background check, or otherwise) or who have truly been connected \nwith street gang activity, K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527 in effect forbid anyone from \nproviding services or support to such persons. Interaction of any kind with such individuals \ncarries the risk of life-long gang member or associate designation, and the many criminal \nand civil consequences of that designation. In this way, both Progeny members and the \nindividuals and communities they seek to serve are discouraged from, punished for, and \ndeprived of fundamental rights of association and assembly. \n112.  The WPDโs policies prevent Progeny from successfully carrying out its \nwork helping juveniles involved in the criminal justice system. The Gang List consistently \nwraps up Progeny members in its throes, subjecting them to ongoing punishment and \n28 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 29 of 62\ndistracting Progeny from its ability to help those youth positively readjust to life in the \ncommunity.  \n113.  Progeny has had to divert resources away from other projects and direct \nindividual assistance to aid members who are facing repercussions associated with their \ninclusion in the Gang List. \n114.  Eliminating, the Gang List would allow Progeny to fulfill its mission of \nassisting youth in the justice system and helping the greater Wichita community reinvest \nin community-based alternatives. \nChristopher Cooper is Negatively Impacted by the Gang List \n \n115.  In 2014, Mr. Cooper was a college student at Highland Community College. \nHe had received a scholarship to K-State, and was preparing to transfer there. \n116.  While on break from school, he attended a party. At the party, there was an \naltercation and shooting ensued. As Mr. Cooper was leaving the party in his car, one of the \nindividuals involved in the shooting jumped into Mr. Cooperโs car, and Mr. Cooper drove \naway. \n117.  In the next few days, Mr. Cooper was arrested and charged with First \nDegree Murder. At his arrest, he learned for the first time that he had been included on the \nGang List. Mr. Cooper denies that he was ever a gang member or associate at any time. \n118.  Mr. Cooper had no criminal history prior to this event. \n119.  Mr. Cooperโs bail was set at $50,000 because he was on the WPDโs Gang \nList. Mr. Cooper remained in jail because he and his family could not afford the bail or \nbond amount. Eventually, the prosecution offered Mr. Cooper a plea deal: he could plead \nto obstruction of justice and accept probation. Ultimately, believing he had no choice, Mr. \n29 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 30 of 62\nCooper accepted the plea. He was incarcerated in jail for a year prior to accepting the plea \nand being sentenced.  \n120.  At  sentencing,  Mr.  Cooper  was  placed  on  strict  probation  with  gang \nconditions. He had a 6 p.m. curfew for over a year. He had to live away from his family \nbecause some of them were on the Gang List. Despite the hard conditions, Mr. Cooper \ncompleted his probation. \n121.  Mr. Cooper lost his scholarship to K-State and has never been able to go \nback to college. \n122.  Mr. Cooper has had no criminal charges or offenses since that incident in \n2014. He is employed in the aircraft manufacturing business. \n123.  Even though Mr. Cooper has had no further criminal events, he has been \nsurveilled and harassed by the WPD. He has been stopped repeatedly for traffic infractions, \nalmost always for failure to signal within 100 feet of an intersection. When officers \napproach his car, they already know his name and treat him like a criminal. This harassment \nwas consistent until Mr. Cooper began driving a car that is registered in the name of a \nfamily member. Since that time, he has not been stopped by the WPD. \n124.  Recently, Mr. Cooper applied for a job with another company that would \nhave been a promotion in position and salary. He believed that he was going to be offered \nthe job, but after a background check, he was turned down. Mr. Cooper believes that he \nwas turned down because the background check identified him as an active gang member.  \n125.  Mr. Cooper has never been and is not currently involved in or associated \nwith a criminal street gang in Wichita or anywhere else. \n30 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 31 of 62\n126.  Mr. Cooperโs presence on the Gang List has been extremely damaging to \nhim. Upon information and belief, he was treated more harshly than he would have been \nas a college student with no prior criminal history who was not on the Gang List. Because \nof this, he lost his scholarship and his chance to complete college. He is subject to \ncontinuous harassment to the point that he had to discontinue driving his own car. He has \nlost employment opportunities and the chance to advance in his career. The damages he \nsuffers are ongoing. \nElbert Costello is Negatively Impacted by the Gang List \n127.  Mr. Costello first learned that he was on the Gang List when he was arrested \nin connection with a shooting in Salina, Kansas, in 1997, and the charging documents listed \nhim as a known gang member. Prior to that, Mr. Costello was never told that he was on the \nGang List. \n128.  Mr. Costello was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and sentenced to a \nperiod of imprisonment. He was placed in a higher level custodial setting because of his \ninclusion on the Gang List.  \n129.  Following Mr. Costelloโs incarceration, he served three years on parole \nwhere he was subjected to punitive gang conditions and increased surveillance because of \nhis inclusion on the Gang List. \n130.  Mr. Costello was never given the opportunity to contest his inclusion on the \nGang List, nor notified of the reasons why he was placed on the list.  \n131.  Mr. Costello is not, nor has he ever been, a member of a criminal street gang \nin Wichita or anywhere else. Mr. Costello admits that he had relatives who were involved \nwith gangs, but he himself was never associated with a gang. \n31 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 32 of 62\n132.  Both  during  and  following  his  parole,  Mr.  Costello  was  subjected  to \nincreased surveillance and harassment by WPD officers. Mr. Costello wasโand continues \nto beโroutinely stopped by the WPD for minor traffic violations. For example, WPD \nofficers routinely pull Mr. Costello over for infractions such as โnot signaling within 100 \nfeet,โ and then subject Mr. Costello to invasive questioning.  \n133.  While Mr. Costello was on parole, the police would search his car anytime \nhe was stopped because he was on the Gang List and subject to special conditions of parole \nfor gang members. \n134.  Mr. Costello experiences fear and anxiety on a daily basis because he knows \nthat the WPD is watching him and will pull him over for any minor rule violation so that \nthey can intimidate and harass him. \n135.  Mr. Costello cannot get together with many of his lifelong friends because \nhe knows that they are also on the Gang List. Being together would give the WPD an \nexcuse to further target or harass Mr. Costello and his friends and change any of their \nstatuses on the Gang List from inactive to active. Mr. Costello also tries to avoid taking \nany photographs with his friends because he is afraid that the WPD will find them on social \nmedia and use them to continue to claim that he is in a gang. \n136.  Mr. Costello also avoids visiting certain businesses or establishments in his \ncommunityโincluding gas stationsโthat he thinks the WPD has identified as โgang \nhangouts.โ He therefore drives out of his way to get gas to avoid being further targeted by \nthe police. \n137.  In Mr. Costelloโs WPD gang record, which counsel was allowed to view \nbut was not provided copy of, there are approximately 30 entries pertaining to Mr. \n32 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 33 of 62\nCostelloโs actions over the last 25 years. The majority of those entries concern photos of \nhim or notations of him socially interacting with others on the Gang List. Each instance \nhas led to Mr. Costello being โrenewedโ on the Gang List for an additional three years as \nan โactive gang member.โ  \n138.  Most recently, on January 16, 2021, there is a notation that an officer \nobserved Mr. Costello in a photo on social media wearing a red โPhiladelphia Philliesโ \nMajor League Baseball cap. Because the color red is associated with a gang, the WPD \ndeemed this a gang related activity and extended Mr. Costelloโs period of โactiveโ gang \nmembership until January 2, 2024.  \n139.  On March 10, 2021, Mr. Costello was identified as a โknown gang memberโ \nin a story in The Wichita Eagle about a shooting that did not involve him at all.6 Apparently, \na parole officer stated to the reporter that the alleged perpetrator of the shooting had been \nseen in January 2021 with Mr. Costello, who was a โknown gang member.โ The occasion \nof which the parole officer was speaking was the funeral of a friend of Mr. Costelloโs. Mr. \nCostello exchanged pleasantries with the other individual, and that was all, but it was \nconsidered an incidence of gang association. Mr. Costello was embarrassed and humiliated \nthat he had been publicly identified as a known gang member in a publication available \nthroughout his home town of Wichita. The Wichita Eagle has since revised its article to \nremove Mr. Costelloโs name, after receiving complaints from Mr. Costelloโs friends and \nfamily. \n140.  Mr. Costelloโs inclusion on the Gang List has had a profound impact on his \nlife. It has prevented him from maintaining meaningful relationships, prevented him from \n                                                 \n6 A true and correct copy of the news article, as it appeared in The Wichita Eagle on March 10, 2021, is attached as \nExhibit C. \n33 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 34 of 62\nfrequenting  businesses,  and  has  subjected  him  to  unrelenting  and  unconstitutional \nsurveillance and enforcement activity by the WPD, which causes him significant anxiety \nand fear. Because Mr. Costello sometimes socializes with friends his age, who were also \nput on the Gang List in their youth, it appears that the WPD intends to list him as an active \ngang member throughout his life. \nMartel Costello is Negatively Impacted by the Gang List \n141.  Plaintiff  Martel  Costello  was  charged  with  marijuana  offenses  and \npossession of firearms offenses in September 2016. He had no prior adult criminal history \nand only one juvenile offense on his record. He learned that he was on the WPDโs Gang \nList at the time of his arrest.  \n142.  Mr. Martel Costello was released pretrial following his arrest. While on \npretrial release, he was repeatedly stopped by the WPD for traffic violations and then \narrested for unknown outstanding warrants. At no point during any of these stops did the \nWPD issue Mr. Martel Costello a ticket for a traffic infraction. Instead, the WPD used these \ntraffic stops as a reason to search Martelโs car and arrest him.  \n143.  When arrested, Mr. Martel Costelloโs bond amounts were set very high due \nto his status on the WPDโs Gang List. His mother had to place her home up as collateral in \norder to bond him out of jail. \n144.  In  October  2017,  Mr.  Martel  Costello  reached  a  plea  deal  with  the \nprosecutor for his underlying charges. At sentencing, the judge gave him an initial sentence \nof 18 monthsโ probation, with 79 months underlying should he violate the terms of his \nprobation. The judge also assigned him special conditions of probation due to Mr. Martel \nCostelloโs status on the WPDโs Gang List. These conditions included a restrictive curfew \nand prohibition on associating with anyone else listed on the Gang List.  \n34 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 35 of 62\n145.  From  October  2017  to  April  2018,  Mr.  Martel  Costello  lived  in  the \ncommunity and abided by these conditions, with the exception of two minor infractionsโ\nusing alcohol on one occasion, and being six minutes late for curfew on another occasion.  \n146.  In  April  2018,  Mr.  Martel  Costello  was  attending  a  family  gathering \nfollowing the death of his niece. A drive-by shooting occurred while he was in the home; \nthe shooter fired at the houseโs garage. When the WPD came to investigate the drive-by \nshooting, they found that Mr. Martel Costello was in the home with another person listed \non the Gang Listโ Mr. Martel Costelloโs cousinโand that his aunt had her handgun in \nher purse. As a result of this, Mr. Martel Costello was charged with firearm possession (for \nhis auntโs gun, which he did not bring and was not on his person) and with a probation \nviolation for being with a known gang member. He was incarcerated for this on April 25, \n2018. \n147.  Between June 2018 and June 2019, Mr. Martel Costello served time in \nvarious settings. Ten days after being released from custody in June 2019, the WPD pulled \nhim over again, claiming that the car he had recently bought had bad tags. The WPD \nimpounded the car and searched it, thereby leading to a new charge of possession of \nparaphernalia and a traffic ticket for the bad tag. The WPD arrested Mr. Martel Costello \nand incarcerated him again, pending adjudication of these new charges.  \n148.  In late August 2019, Mr. Martel Costelloโs brother passed away. On August \n21, 2019, his family posted Mr. Martel Costelloโs bond so that he could be with the family \nfor his brotherโs funeral. The funeral was held on August 23, 2019, and Mr. Martel Costello \nattended in person.  \n35 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 36 of 62\n149.  The following Monday, Mr. Martel Costelloโs probation officer told him \nthat he needed to come in to take a urinalysis screen. When Mr. Martel Costello showed \nup for the screen, he was placed under arrest for violating his conditions of releaseโ\nnamely, being at his own brotherโs funeral, because other people on the WPDโs Gang List \nwere also present. \n150.  Mr. Martel Costello was eventually sentenced to prison for the probation \nviolation charges, plus the possession of paraphernalia charge from June 2019. His earliest \nrelease date is 2023, but if he loses his good time credit for any reason, he will remain \nincarcerated through 2025. \n151.  On information and belief, the WPD placed Mr. Martel Costello on its Gang \nList in 2016 because of whom Mr. Martel Costello was related to, rather than any particular \nconduct by Mr. Martel Costello. Since then, the WPD has taken every opportunity to \nharass, surveil, and punish Mr. Martel Costello simply because he is on the Gang List.  \n152.  Mr. Martel Costello has had to abide by strict conditions of probation and \npretrial release every time he is bonded out of jail because of the WPDโs designation that \nhe is a gang member. These conditions are so punitive that on two occasions Mr. Martel \nCostello has been sent back to an incarceration setting simply for attending the funeral of \na loved one. \n153.  Mr. Martel Costello has never been involved in any gang activity and was \nnever told why he was placed on the Gang List in the first place. \n154.  Whenever Mr. Martel Costello is living in Wichita, such as when he has \nbeen released pretrial or on probation, he is subjected to consistent harassment by the WPD, \nincluding multiple traffic stops and searches. Despite these unrelenting traffic stops, Mr. \n36 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 37 of 62\nMartel Costello has yet to receive a ticket for an alleged traffic offense, except the โbad \ntagโ ticket detailed above. \n155.  Mr. Martel Costello fears that because of his arbitrary placement on the \nGang List, he will never be able to interact with his friends and family or conform his \nconduct in a way that will keep the WPD from labeling him as a gang member. \n156.  Because of Defendantsโ actions, Mr. Martel Costello has been subjected to \nsignificantly harsher punishment than he would have experienced had he not been on the \nGang List. \nJeremy Levy, Jr. is Negatively Impacted by the Gang List \n157.  Plaintiff Jeremy Levy, Jr. was charged with first-degree felony murder in \n2017 when he was 18 years old. The charges involved an incident where Mr. Levy and \nanother individual were involved in an altercation that involved shots being fired in a \nparking lot, and a bystander in a car in the parking lot was killed. \n158.  The altercation involved a dispute between Mr. Levy and another individual \nover the affection of a young woman. \n159.  There was no scientific evidence that the shot that killed the bystander came \nfrom Mr. Levy. \n160.  Prior to this incident, Mr. Levy had never been charged with a crime. As a \njuvenile, Mr. Levy had some interaction with the juvenile justice system, but only in a few \nincidents that would have constituted misdemeanors for an adult.  \n161.  Mr. Levy believes the WPD added him to its Gang List when he was 13 \nyears old. Mr. Levy was riding in a car with his cousins when the car was pulled over by \nthe WPD. Mr. Levy believes he was added to the Gang List then because one of his cousins \nwas already on the Gang List.  \n37 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 38 of 62\n162.  Mr. Levy is not, nor has he ever been, a member or associate of a criminal \nstreet gang in Wichita or elsewhere. \n163.  During his trial for felony murder, the prosecutor moved the court to allow \nthe entry of Mr. Levyโs gang status into evidence of a motive for an โotherwise inexplicable \nevent,โ on the theory that the shooting was part of a gang feud. \n164.  The prosecutorโs evidence of the alleged theory was that Mr. Levy was \nlisted on the Gang List as a Folk Gang Disciple and the other individual was listed on the \nGang List as being a member of a different gang. \n165.  Over  Mr.  Levyโs  objection  both  pre-trial  and  during  the  trial,  the \nprosecution introduced evidence of at least 13 different โgang related incidents.โ These \nalleged incidents included several shootings and other serious criminal offenses. It was not \nalleged that Mr. Levy was present or involved during any of these events except one event \nin which Mr. Levy was himself injured, which was not related to any gang activity.  \n166.  The introduction of the gang-related incidents was extremely prejudicial to \nMr. Levy, and it guaranteed that he could not receive a fair trial for the one incident with \nwhich he was charged. Even though he was not alleged to have personally participated in \nthe  โgang-related  events,โ  these  events  were  put  before  the  jury  as  background  to \ndemonstrate that the incident with which he was charged was not an isolated event. The \njury convicted him of first-degree felony murder, and he received a harsh sentence, in \nwhich he will not be eligible for parole at least until 2042.  \n167.  Mr. Levy is one of many individuals for whom their presence on the Gang \nList has allowed prosecutors to introduce irrelevant and prejudicial information at trial.  \n38 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 39 of 62\n168.  Presence on the Gang List has additional consequences for such individuals, \nincluding a mandatory bail of at least $50,000, longer sentences in higher security prisons, \nfar harsher probation and parole conditions, and, upon information and belief, negative \neffects on their ability to obtain favorable pleas or diversions. \n169.  Upon information and belief, individuals on the Gang List with stricter \nconditions of probation are more likely to be found in violation of their probation and \nincarcerated as a result, even if their original offense of conviction did not justify a prison \nsentence. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n170.  Pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(2), the individually \nnamed Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and all other persons similarly situated \nas members of the proposed class. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief against the \nDefendants on behalf of the class. \n171.  This  action  satisfies  the  numerosity,  commonality,  typicality,  and  adequacy, \nrequirements of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a).  \n172.  Plaintiffs bring this class action on behalf of the following classes, as set forth \nbelow: \nListed Gang Member or Gang Associate Class \nAll persons included in the Wichita Police Departmentโs Gang List as an Active or \nInactive Gang Member or Gang Associate. \n \nEqual Protection Class \nAll persons included in the Wichita Police Departmentโs Gang List as an Active or \nInactive Gang Member or Gang Associate who are Black, Latinx, or a member of \nanother racial minority group, such as Asian or Indigenous Peoples. \n \n39 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 40 of 62\n173.  Plaintiffs reserve the right to amend the class definition if discovery or further \ninvestigation reveals that the class should be expanded, divided into subclasses, or modified in any \nway. \nNumerosity \n174.  Although the exact number of class members is uncertain and can be determined \nonly through appropriate discovery, the number is great enough such that joinder is impracticable. \nBased on information provided publicly by the WPD, there are currently 1,833 Active Gang \nMembers and 298 Associate Gang Members listed in the Gang List. The class is sufficiently \nnumerous to warrant class treatment, and the disposition of the claims of these class members in a \nsingle action will provide substantial benefits to all parties and to the Court. \n175.  Plaintiffs do not currently know the identities of all class members. Plaintiffs are \ninformed and believe the identities of class members may be obtained from information collected \nand maintained by the WPD.  \nTypicality \n176.  Plaintiffsโ claims are typical of the claims of the class in that Plaintiffs, like all class \nmembers, have been placed on the WPDโs Gang List in violation of their constitutional rights.  \n177.  Thus, Plaintiffs have the same interests and have suffered the same type of harm as \nthe class members. Plaintiffsโ claims are based upon the same or similar legal theories as the claims \nof the class members.  \n178.  Moreover, the factual bases of Defendantsโ misconduct are common to all class \nmembers and represent a common thread of misconduct resulting in similar injury to all members \nof the class. \n40 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 41 of 62\nAdequate Representation \n179.  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent and protect the interests of the classes. \nPlaintiffs have retained counsel with substantial experience litigating civil rights issues and class \nactions. Plaintiffs and their counsel are committed to vigorously prosecuting this action on behalf \nof the class and have adequate resources to do so.  \n180.  Neither Plaintiffs nor their counsel has interests adverse to the classes. \nCommonality  \n181.  There are numerous questions of law and fact common to Plaintiffs and the class \nmembers. The legal harms suffered by Plaintiffs and class members are identical. The answers to \nthese common questions will thus advance resolution of the litigation as to all class members. \nThese common legal and factual issues include: \na.  Whether K.S.A. 21-6313 is unconstitutionally broad and vague. \nb.  Whether K.S.A. 21-6313 and the actions of Defendants violate the Due Process \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. \nc.  Whether K.S.A. 21-6313 and the actions of Defendants violate the Equal \nProtection  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  of  the  United  States \nConstitution. \nd.  Whether K.S.A. 21-6313 and the actions of Defendants violate the Right of \nAssociation and Expression Clause of the First Amendment of the United States \nConstitution. \ne.  Whether  Plaintiffsโ  constitutional  rights  were  violated  as  a  result  of  a \nlongstanding or widespread custom or practice that was the moving force \nbehind the constitutional violations.  \n41 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 42 of 62\nRule 23(b)(2) Injunctive or Declaratory Relief \n182.  Plaintiffs and members of the class request certification of a class under Rule \n23(b)(2) because Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the \nclass, such that final injunctive relief or declaratory relief is appropriate with respect to the class \nas a whole. Defendantsโ policies, practices, customs, and conduct have resulted in, and will \ncontinue to result in, irreparable injury to Plaintiffs and class members, including, but not limited \nto, violations of their constitutional and statutory rights. Plaintiffs have no plain, adequate, or \ncomplete remedy at law to address the wrong described herein.  \n183.  The injunctive relief requested by Plaintiffs and class members includes, but is not \nlimited to, an injunction striking down the WPDโs use of the Gang List and enjoining Defendants \nfrom operating a Gang List in the future. \n184.  Plaintiffs  and  the  class  also  seek  a  declaration  (1)  that  K.S.A.  21-6313  is \nunconstitutionally vague and overbroad, (2) that Defendantsโ maintenance and use of a Gang List \npursuant to Policy No. 527 violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States \nConstitution, and (3) adjudging Defendantsโ policies and actions to be unconstitutional. \n185.  Further, Plaintiffs and the class seek a declaration that Defendants acted with \nnegligence, gross negligence, and willful, wanton, and careless disregard for the constitutional \nrights of Plaintiffs and members of the class.  \nRule 23(c)(4) Certification of Particular Issues \n186.  In the alternative to certification under Rule 23(b)(2), Plaintiffs and the class seek \nto maintain a class action with respect to particular issues under Rule 23(c)(4). \n42 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 43 of 62\n187.  Specifically, the questions of whether K.S.A. 21-6313 is unconstitutionally broad \nand vague, violates the First Amendment, or violates the Fourteenth Amendment are suitable for \nissue certification under Rule 23(c)(4). \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCount I: Violation of Fourteenth Amendment Right to Due Process \nVagueness \nAll Plaintiffs and Class Members \n \n188.  Plaintiffs incorporate each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully restated herein.  \n189.  K.S.A. 21-6313, et seq., violates Plaintiffs right to due process of law under the \nFourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution by failing to give Plaintiffs fair notice of \nthe requirements they must meet under the statute.  \n190.  K.S.A. 21-6313, et seq., is unconstitutionally broad and vague in that it allows \nindividuals to be designated as criminal street gang members based on innocent, non-criminal \nactivities, such as what they wear, where they live, and whom they are related to. \n191.  K.S.A. 21-6313, et seq., is unconstitutionally vague because the statute includes \nbroad undefined language including, inter alia, terms such as โgang area,โ โstyle of dress,โ โhand \nsignals or tattoos,โ โoffenses consistent with criminal street gang activity,โ and โphysical evidence \nsuch as photographs or other documentationโ that are capable of multiple interpretations and \nprovide virtually unfettered discretion for police to designate an individual as a gang member or \nassociate. \n192.  K.S.A. 21-6313, et seq., is unconstitutionally vague because individuals do not \nknow whether or not they are on the Gang List, or whether their clothing choices, neighborhood \nof residence, or other elements of everyday life would qualify them for inclusion on the Gang List. \n43 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 44 of 62\nPeople therefore cannot conform their conduct to avoid being identified as an associate or member \nof a gang and placed on the Gang List. \n193.  The unconstitutional vagueness of K.S.A. 21-6313, et seq. causes significant injury \nand damage to all named Plaintiffs. Because Wichita residents are unable to conform their conduct \nto avoid inclusion on Wichitaโs Gang List, Progeny Kansas is unable to operate in a way that \navoids  placing  its  members  at  risk  of  List  membership  and  resulting  civil  and  criminal \nconsequences. Mr. Elbert Costello is unable to make basic life decisionsโsuch as where to buy \ngas or what clothing to wearโin a way that ensures he will not be re-identified by the WPD as an \nactive gang member. Mr. Martel Costello and Mr. Levy will be unable to avoid violating probation \nand pretrial release conditions that are premised on their own Gang List membership because they \ndo not know who else is on the Gang List. Like all Wichita residents, Mr. Cooper is unable to \nconform his conduct to the WPDโs vague gang membership criteria and avoid the consequences \nof Gang List membership. \nCount II: Violation of Fourteenth Amendment Right to Due Process \nFailure to Provide Procedural Due Process to Progeny (42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \nProgeny  \n \n194.  Plaintiffs incorporate each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully restated herein. \nProgenyโs members not named as individual Plaintiffs in this lawsuit would have standing to sue \nin their individual capacities if named as Plaintiffs. These members have suffered injuries in fact, \nincluding the deprivation of constitutional rights to expression and assembly and procedural and \nsubstantive due process, as well as unlawful police detentions, interrogations, searches, and \nsurveillance, and reputational and financial harms including denial of employment, housing, and \nparticipation in social groups. \n44 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 45 of 62\n195.  By bringing this lawsuit, Progeny seeks to protect interests that are germane to \nProgenyโs  purpose.  Progenyโs  mission  and  operations  center  on  the  assembly,  expression, \nassociation and support of at-risk youth. By precipitating civil and criminal punishments on \nWichita residents for, among other things, entering certain neighborhoods and associating with \ncertain individuals, K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527 directly obstruct Progenyโs purpose and \noperations. Progeny seeks the invalidation of K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527 so that it may carry \nout its philanthropic and constitutionally-protected mission. \n196.  Neither the claims asserted nor the relief requested in this complaint requires the \nparticipation of Progenyโs individual members in this lawsuit. Individual participation would be \nprohibitively cumbersome and would amplify the unnecessary reputational harm caused by the \nWPDโs erroneous and improper designation of Progeny members as gang members. Moreover, \nthe constitutional defects of K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527 may be adjudicated, and the statute \nand Policy invalidated, without the participation of unnamed individual Progeny members. \n197.  The foregoing actions by Defendants violate 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and the Fourteenth \nAmendment of the United States Constitution.  \n198.  The Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees that no \ncitizen will be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. \n199.  The Gang List and Defendantsโ policies and practices of (1) not providing notice to \nindividuals that they are listed in the Gang List, (2) not allowing individuals to contest their \naddition to the Gang List, (3) not providing a clear process for individuals to petition for removal \nfrom the Gang List, and (4) renewing individuals as Active Gang Members on the Gang List \nwithout notice or any opportunity to challenge interfere with Progenyโs mission of keeping Kansas \nyouth out of the criminal justice system. \n45 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 46 of 62\n200.  The criteria for gang membership set forth in of K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527 do \nnot reliably identify members of criminal street gangs for inclusion on the Gang List. As such, \nthese criteria are arbitrary and capricious, and serve no legitimate government interest. In fact, the \nuse of arbitrary criteria leading to consistently inaccurate gang membership designations frustrates \nany conceivable legitimate government interest in combating gang violence or crime generally. \n201.  The Gang List interferes with Progenyโs mission of keeping Kansas youth out of \nthe criminal justice system because the inability to petition for removal from the Gang List keeps \nKansas youth tied indefinitely to the criminal justice system and interferes with the ability of these \nyouth to get education and employment. \n202.  Complications  resulting  from  the  WPDโs  Gang  List  policies  absorb  Progeny \nresources that would otherwise be devoted to its philanthropic mission, further damaging Progeny \nand its members. \n203.  The  Gang  List  further  interferes  with  Progenyโs  mission  because  it  restrains \nProgeny from hosting events or associating with Kansas youth. Because individuals are unable to \ndetermine whether they are listed on the Gang List, Progeny and the youth attending Progeny-\nhosted events risk being added to the Gang List based on the innocent, non-criminal activity of \nbeing in contact with others at such an event who are listed in the Gang List. \nCount III: Violation of Fourteenth Amendment Right to Due Process \nFailure to Provide Procedural Due Process (42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \nPlaintiffs Christopher Cooper, Elbert Costello, Martel Costello, Jeremy Levy, Jr., and \nAll Class Members \n \n204.  Plaintiffs incorporate each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully restated herein.  \n205.  The foregoing actions by Defendants violate 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and the Fourteenth \nAmendment of the United States Constitution.  \n46 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 47 of 62\n206.  The Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees that no \ncitizen will be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. \n207.  The Gang List and Defendantsโ policies and practices of (1) not providing notice to \nindividuals that they are listed in the Gang List, (2) not allowing individuals to contest their \naddition to the Gang List, (3) not providing a clear process for individuals to petition for removal \nfrom the Gang List, and (4) renewing individuals as Active Gang Members on the Gang List \nwithout notice or any opportunity to challenge violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Unilateral \naction by one WPD officer is sufficient to place Plaintiffs on the Gang List. Unilateral WPD action \nis also sufficient to renew Plaintiffsโ and othersโ inclusion on the Gang List indefinitely, with no \nprocess to allow them to protect their constitutional rights by challenging their inclusion or \npetitioning to be removed. \n208.  Plaintiff Christopher Cooper received no notice of his designation as a gang \nmember on the WPDโs Gang List by WPD officers. He only learned that he had been designated \nas a gang member on the WPDโs Gang List at some previous time after he was arrested following \na shooting at party he attended. He has never been informed of the basis for his designation as a \ngang member, nor has he been provided an opportunity to challenge his designation or petition for \nremoval  from  the  Gang  List.  Likewise,  he  has  never  received  notice  or  been  provided  an \nopportunity to challenge subsequent renewals of his gang member status. Plaintiff Mr. Cooper is \nnot and has never been a member of a criminal street gang. \n209.  Plaintiff Elbert Costello likewise received no notice of his designation as a gang \nmember on the WPDโs Gang List by WPD officers. He only learned that he had been designated \nas a gang member on the WPDโs Gang List at some previous time after he was arrested in \nconnection with a shooting in Salina, Kansas, in 1997. Prior to his involvement in this lawsuit, he \n47 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 48 of 62\nhad never been informed of the basis for his designation as a gang member, nor has he ever been \nprovided an opportunity to challenge his designation or petition for removal from the Gang List. \nLikewise, he has never received notice or been provided an opportunity to challenge subsequent \nrenewals of his gang member status. As a result, he has been designated as an โactiveโ gang \nmember on the WPDโs Gang List for over 20 yearsโeffectively a perpetual lifetime designation. \nMr. Costello is not and has never been a member of a criminal street gang. \n210.  Plaintiff Martel Costello likewise received no notice of his designation as a gang \nmember on the WPDโs Gang List by WPD officers. He only learned that he had been designated \nas a gang member on the WPDโs Gang List at some previous time when he was arrested in \nconnection with marijuana offenses and firearm possession in 2016. He has never been informed \nof the basis for his designation as a gang member, nor has he been provided an opportunity to \nchallenge his designation or petition for removal from the Gang List. Likewise, he has never \nreceived notice or been provided an opportunity to challenge subsequent renewals of his gang \nmember status. Mr. Martel Costello is not and has never been a member of a criminal street gang. \n211.  Plaintiff Jeremy Levy, Jr. likewise received no notice of his designation as a gang \nmember on the WPDโs Gang List by WPD officers. He only learned that he had been designated \nas a gang member on the WPDโs Gang List at some previous time when he was arrested in \nconnection with a shooting in 2017. He has never been informed of the basis for his designation \nas a gang member, nor has he been provided an opportunity to challenge his designation or petition \nfor removal from the Gang List. Mr. Levy is not and has never been a member of a criminal street \ngang. Moreover, the incident with which he was charged and is now incarcerated was not gang-\nrelated. \n48 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 49 of 62\n212.  The criteria for gang membership set forth in of K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527 do \nnot reliable identify members of criminal street gangs for inclusion on the Gang List. As such, \nthese criteria are arbitrary and capricious, and serve no legitimate government interest. In fact, the \nuse of arbitrary criteria leading to consistently inaccurate gang membership designations frustrates \nany conceivable legitimate government interest in combating gang violence or crime generally. \n213.  Inclusion on the Gang List entails significant deprivations of liberty and property \nconsequences including detention, arrest, increased bond, criminal liability and incarceration or \nenhanced sentencing, restrictive probation conditions, and loss of employment, housing, and social \nopportunities. These deprivations significantly damage Plaintiffs and are effected without notice \nor an opportunity to be heard in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. \nCount IV: Violation of Fourteenth Amendment Right to Due Process \nFailure to Provide Substantive Due Process (42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \nAll Plaintiffs and Class Members \n214.  Plaintiffs incorporate each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully restated herein. \n215.  Under K.S.A. 21-6313, an individual may be included on the WPDโs Gang List \nbased entirely on lawful, innocuous, and constitutionally protected conduct. Once on the Gang \nList, individuals may be and regularly are renewed as โactiveโ members of the list due to lawful, \ninnocuous and constitutionally protected conduct. \n216.  Inclusion on the WPDโs Gang List leads to significant deprivations of life, liberty \nand property. These deprivations include:  \n๏ง  frequent, prolonged, intrusive, and hostile encounters with law enforcement; \n๏ง  unreasonable searches of property; \n๏ง  unjustified arrests; \n๏ง  unwarranted online and in-person surveillance; \n49 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 50 of 62\n๏ง  identification by and increased attention from WPD officers using โSignal 33โ; \n๏ง  allegations of gang membership in arrest affidavits and news media; \n๏ง  increased bail leading to prolonged imprisonment and financial hardship; \n๏ง  severely restrictive probation, pretrial release, and parole conditions; \n๏ง  re-arrest, detention, and incarceration for violations of restrictive release conditions; \n๏ง  diminished plea offers in connection with criminal charges; \n๏ง  introduction of gang membership as evidence in criminal proceedings, leading to \nextreme prejudice, conviction, and incarceration; \n๏ง  representation of gang membership to other public and private entities, leading to \nmisidentification of Plaintiffs as gang members in background checks and news articles \nor other public sources; and \n๏ง  loss of educational, employment, and housing opportunities. \nPlaintiffsโincluding Progeny and its members, individual named Plaintiffs, and Plaintiff \nclass membersโhave experienced and been damaged by these deprivations. \n217.  Additionally,  inclusion  on  the  Gang  List  is  stigmatizing.  Because  other  law \nenforcement entities have access to the Gang List, and inclusion on the Gang List may come up in \nbackground checks for employment, housing, or benefits, individuals face reputational harm and \ndisparate treatment as a result of Defendantsโ actions. \n218.  Because of his inaccurate designation as a gang member on the WPDโs Gang List, \nPlaintiff Christopher Cooper has experienced significant deprivations of life, liberty and property \nincluding frequent, prolonged, hostile and unjustified police stops; identification by and increased \nattention  from  WPD  officers;  heightened  punishment  leading  to  prolonged  imprisonment, \nfinancial hardship, and ultimately an unwarranted criminal plea and conviction; severely restrictive \n50 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 51 of 62\nprobation conditions including a 6 p.m. curfew and prohibition on contact with family members; \nloss of his college scholarship; and loss of an employment promotion in position and salary. \n219.  Because of his inaccurate designation as a gang member on the WPDโs Gang List, \nPlaintiff Elbert Costello has experienced significant deprivations of life, liberty and property \nincluding frequent, prolonged, intrusive, and hostile police stops; unreasonable searches of his car; \nidentification by and increased attention from WPD officers; unwarranted surveillance; severely \nrestrictive parole conditions; representation of gang membership to other public and private \nentities including The Wichita Eagle newspaper, and perpetual renewal of his inaccurate gang \nmember designation on the Gang List for reasons such as innocuous social interactions and \nwearing professional sports team paraphernalia. \n220.  Because of his inaccurate designation as a gang member on the WPDโs Gang List, \nPlaintiff Martel Costello has experienced significant deprivations of life, liberty and property \nincluding  frequent,  prolonged,  intrusive,  and  hostile  police  stops;  increased  bail  leading  to \nprolonged imprisonment and financial hardship; severely restrictive probation and pretrial release \nconditions including a curfew and ban on contact with family members and others (who in many \ninstances he has no way of identifying); re-arrest and incarceration for violations of restrictive \nrelease conditions; unreasonable searches of property; unjustified arrests; unwarranted police \nsurveillance; and identification by and increased attention from WPD officers. \n221.  Because of his inaccurate designation as a gang member on the WPDโs Gang List, \nPlaintiff Jeremy Levy, Jr. has experienced significant deprivations of life, liberty and property \nincluding introduction of gang membership as evidence in criminal proceedings, leading to \nextreme prejudice, conviction, and incarcerationโwhich continues to this day. \n51 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 52 of 62\n222.   Progeny members have experienced significant deprivations of life, liberty, and \nproperty including those described above. These deprivations interfere with Progenyโs essential \nfunctions and prevent it from accomplishing its mission of serving Wichita youth. \n223.  Causing and imposing significant deprivations of life, liberty, and property on the \nbasis of lawful, innocuous, and constitutionally protected behavior substantively violates the Due \nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.  \n224.  The WPDโs policies and practices therefore unconstitutionally impede individualsโ \nliberty interests without due process of law. \nCount V: Violation of Fourteenth Amendment Right to Equal Protection \nDisparate Impact on Minority Communities (42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \nPlaintiffs Christopher Cooper, Elbert Costello, Martel Costello, Jeremy Levy, Jr., and \nEqual Protection Class Members \n \n225.  Plaintiffs incorporate each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully restated herein. \n226.  Defendants have implemented, enforced, encouraged, and sanctioned policies, \npractices, and customs of using discriminatory policing tactics to target the named Plaintiffs and \nmembers of the Plaintiff class for inclusion in the Gang List based solely on their race and national \norigin, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The WPD intentionally \napplies a facially neutral policy in a discriminatory manner. As a result, Defendantsโ policy, \npractice, and/or custom of maintaining the Gang List violates the Equal Protection Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment.  \n227.  Data indicates that Defendantsโ Gang List-related policies and practices have a \ndiscriminatory effect on Black and Latinx communities and that Black and Latinx people are \nincluded in the Gang List at far higher rates than are similarly situated white people.  \n228.  On information and belief, the WPD created its Gang List to track and surveil Black \nand Latinx neighborhoods as part of an anti-gang enforcement strategy. \n52 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 53 of 62\n229.  The Kansas Legislature then codified the WPDโs harmful gang surveillance policy \nand  practices  by  passing  K.S.A.  21-6313,  basing  that  statute  on  the  WPDโs  practices  of \ncategorizing predominately Black and Latinx Wichita community members as gang members or \nassociates based on whom they hang out with, the businesses they frequent, and the color of \nclothing they wear. \n230.  By its acts and omissions, Defendants have acted under color of state law to deprive \nPlaintiffs of their Fourteenth Amendment rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.  \n231.  Defendants intend to discriminate against people when they violate peoplesโ rights \nthrough placement in the Gang List. Defendants pursued this policy precisely because of the \nadverse effects it has on Black and Latinx individuals.  \n232.  Defendants do not subject similarly situated white individuals and communities to \nthe same level of surveillance, harassment, and monitoring for inclusion on the Gang List as they \ndo Black and Latinx individuals and communities.  \n233.  Plaintiffs Christopher Cooper, Elbert Costello, Martel Costello, and Jeremy Levy, \nJr., have suffered injury and damage as a result of Defendantsโ racially discriminatory policies and \npractices. Each of these Plaintiffs is a Black male who is not, and has never been a member of a \ncriminal street gang, yet they have been included in the WPDโs Gang List. Each of these Plaintiffs \nhave suffered significant civil and criminal consequences as a result of their inclusion on the Gang \nList. Upon information and belief, similarly situated white residents of Wichita are not targeted \nfor inclusion on the WPDโs Gang List, and do not suffer the same civil and criminal consequences \nfor inclusion, such as enhanced surveillance and police harassment, deliberate perpetual renewal \nof Gang List status, unjustified arrests and searches, and introduction of Gang List status as \nevidence in criminal proceedings for non-gang-related charges. \n53 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 54 of 62\n234.  Defendants were and remain deliberately indifferent to the harm created through \nthe implementation of the Gang List. Defendants have carried out this policy at least in part \nbecause of the adverse effects it has had on Black and Latinx individuals, and a reasonable \ninference can be drawn that supervisors have intended those effects to occur. Despite notice of \nracial disparities in the Gang List, Defendantsโ policies and practices concerning the Gang List \nremain unchanged.  \n235.  Defendants have implemented, enforced, encouraged, and sanctioned the WPDโs \npolicy, practice, and custom of using and maintaining a Gang List in a manner that constitutes \nracial and/or ethnic discrimination against the Plaintiff class in violation of the Fourteenth \nAmendment. As a direct and proximate result of the aforesaid acts and omissions of the City of \nWichita, the Fourteenth Amendment rights of the Plaintiffs have been violated.  \n236.  Unless restrained by order of this Court, a real and immediate threat exists that the \nFourteenth Amendment rights of Plaintiffs will be violated by Defendants in the future. Plaintiffs \nseek injunctive and declaratory relief against Defendants to prevent the continued violation of their \nconstitutional rights. \nCount VI: Violation of First Amendment \nRight of Association and Expression ((42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) โ Direct Prohibition \nAll Plaintiffs and Class Members \n \n237.  Plaintiffs incorporate each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully restated herein. \n238.  K.S.A.  21-6313  and  Policy  527  unconstitutionally  proscribe  expressive  and \nassociative activity in violation of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  \n239.  K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527โs criteria for inclusion on the WPD Gang List \ninclude expressive and associative activities protected by the First Amendment. Such activities \ninclude, but are not limited to: contact with family members, friends, and others; residence in, or \n54 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 55 of 62\ntravel to, certain neighborhoods; participation in political, religious, and other social groups; and \ndisplay of colors and symbols on oneโs person or clothing. \n240.  Inclusion on the WPDโs Gang List under K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527 leads to \nadverse criminal consequences and enhanced punishment. Such consequences include, but are not \nlimited, to: mandatory minimum bail for certain offenses, enhanced probation conditions and \nintensive pre-trial monitoring, police surveillance, repeat detainment, questioning and arrest, \nenhanced criminal charges and diminished plea offers, and prejudicial admission of Gang List \nmembership  information  in  criminal  proceedings  leading  to  increased  conviction  and \nincarceration. \n241.  Plaintiff Progeny Kansas and its members are and have been damaged by K.S.A. \n21-6313 and Policy 527โs unconstitutional proscription of expressive and associative behaviors. \nProgeny and its members are directly restricted from organizing, conducting, and attending \npeaceable assemblies because doing so creates grounds for the WPD to add Progeny members and \nevent attendees to its Gang List and to harass, detain, search, and surveil them pursuant to K.S.A. \n21-6313 and Policy 527. Moreover, under K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527, attendance at such \npeaceable assemblies subjects Progeny members to increased bail for person offenses, more \nrestrictive probation and parole restrictions, and enhanced criminal charges and consequences, \nincluding the admission of highly prejudicial Gang List information as evidence in criminal \nproceedings. Upon information and belief, Progeny members and clients have been added to the \nWPDโs Gang List and subjected to these enhanced criminal consequences due to participation in \nProgeny activities and/or contact with other Progeny members and clients. \n242.  Plaintiff Christopher Cooper has been damaged by K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy \n527โs unconstitutional proscription of expressive and associative behaviors. As a result of his \n55 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 56 of 62\nunjustified inclusion on the WPDโs Gang List, Mr. Cooper was subjected to enhanced probation \nconditions which forced him to move away from and cease contact with members of his family. \nHis inclusion on the Gang List under K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527 meant that he was directly \nproscribed from associating with his own family members, in violation of the First Amendment to \nthe United States Constitution. \n243.  Plaintiff Elbert Costello has been damaged by K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527โs \nunconstitutional proscription of expressive and associative behaviors. His unjustified โactiveโ \ngang member status was recently renewed for an additional three years based on a photograph of \nhim wearing a hat in support of the Philadelphia Phillies baseball team. In the past, Mr. Costello \nhas been renewed on the Gang List for constitutionally protected, non-criminal associations with \nothers on the WPDโs Gang List. As his more than 20 years on the WPDโs Gang List has shown, \ninclusion on the Gang List subjects Mr. Costello to significant criminal consequences including \npolice harassment, arrest, unreasonable search, and surveillance. Moreover, should Mr. Costello \nbe arrested or charged with a person crime or other offense, he would be subject to increased bail, \nrestrictive probation or parole conditions, and the potential for his gang member status to be \nintroduced as highly prejudicial evidence in any criminal trialโconsequences not faced by \nindividuals facing identical charges who are not on the WPDโs Gang Listโbecause of how he \ndressed and the people with whom he was photographed. Mr. Costelloโs renewal on the WPDโs \nGang List for the expressive conduct of wearing a Philadelphia Phillies cap, and for the associative \nconduct of non-criminal interactions with others on the WPDโs Gang List, violates the First \nAmendment of the United States Constitution. \n244.  Plaintiff Martel Costello has been damaged by K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527โs \nunconstitutional proscription of expressive and associative behaviors. As a result of his unjustified \n56 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 57 of 62\ninclusion on the WPDโs Gang List, Mr. Martel Costello was subjected to enhanced probation \nconditions including prohibition on contacts with members of his family. Pursuant to these \nconditionsโa direct consequence of his inclusion on the Gang ListโMr. Martel Costello has been \narrested and incarcerated on two separate occasions specifically for being present at events with \nother family members who are included on the WPDโs Gang List. Both events were non-criminal \nin nature (K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527 are indifferent to whether such contacts have any \ncriminal purpose) and both were commemorations of recent family deaths: Plaintiff Costelloโs \nniece in one instance, and his brother in the other. Mr. Martel Costello is currently incarcerated for \nviolating his probation prohibition on contacts with certain family members by being present at \nhis brotherโs funeral. His inclusion on the Gang List under K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527 meant \nthat he was directly proscribed from associating with his own family membersโand arrested and \nincarcerated for doing soโin violation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n245.  Plaintiff Jeremy Levy Jr. has been damaged by K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527โs \nunconstitutional proscription of expressive and associative behaviors. As a result of his unjustified \ninclusion on the Gang List, Mr. Levy was subjected to increased punishment at his criminal trial \nbecause of his association with other people on the Gang List who may or may not have been \ninvolved in other, unrelated crimes. Moreover, once Mr. Levy is released on parole, he will be \nsubject to highly restrictive supervision conditions that will prevent him from associating with his \nfamily and friends, in violation of the First Amendment. \n246.  These and other enhanced criminal consequences are carried out by state and local \nlaw enforcement and corrections officers and constitute government action. \n247.  By  attaching  enhanced  criminal  consequences  to  constitutionally  protected \nactivities, K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527 directly and impermissibly prohibit and punish those \n57 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 58 of 62\nactivities with the force of state law and are invalid under the First Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution. \nCount VII: Violation of First Amendment  \nRight of Association and Expression (42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) โ Chilling Effect \nAll Plaintiffs and Class Members \n \n248.  Plaintiffs incorporate each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully restated herein. \n249.  K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527 unconstitutionally chill expressive and associative \nactivity among persons within the jurisdiction in which Defendants employ the Gang List in \nviolation of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \n250.  K.S.A.  21-6313  and  Policy  527  unconstitutionally  chill  intimate  associations \namong  private  individuals  including  associations  among  family  members,  friends,  school \nclassmates, co-workers, religious adherents, and others.  \n251.  Plaintiffs avoid engaging in such activities as contact with family members, friends, \nand others; residence in, or travel to, certain neighborhoods; participation in political, religious, \nand other social groups; and display of colors and symbols on oneโs person or clothing in order to \navoid being placed on the WPDโs Gang List. \n252.  K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527 chill expressive associations among members of \nnon-gang social and political groups. Any member of any group (including political parties, \nreligious organizations, and civic and educational bodies) could be added to the Gang List due to \ncontacts with others in the group who are listed in the Gang Listโwhether or not that person has \nin fact ever been connected with a gang. \n253.  Inclusion on the WPDโs Gang List under K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527 causes \nreputational harm, precipitating concrete injuries. \n58 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 59 of 62\n254.  Inclusion on the WPDโs Gang List leads to increased, extended and intensified \ninteractions with law enforcement. Designation as a gang member or associate leads to improper \npolice stops, detentions, interrogations, searches, surveillance, suspicion, and arrest. \n255.  Inclusion on the WPDโs Gang List leads to financial and physical harms including \ndenial and loss of employment, discrimination in housing, stigmatization and exclusion from social \ngroups, and harmed personal relationships. \n256.  As a result of K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527โs unconstitutional restrictions, \nOrganizational Plaintiff Progeny has been chilled and discouraged from constitutionally protected \nexpressive and associative behaviors. Progeny and its members have refrained from organizing, \nconducting, and attending peaceable assemblies where those included on the WPDโs Gang List are \nlikely to be present. \n257.  As a result of K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527โs unconstitutional restrictions, \nPlaintiff Christopher Cooper has been chilled and discouraged from constitutionally protected \nexpressive and associative behaviors. Mr. Cooper has refrained from associating with certain \nfamily members and intimate friends for peaceful purposes due to fear that such association might \ncause himself or others to be arrested, included or renewed on the WPDโs Gang List and subjected \nto continued or increased police harassment or other criminal consequences.  \n258.  As a result of K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527โs unconstitutional restrictions, \nPlaintiff  Elbert  Costello  has  been  chilled  and  discouraged  from  constitutionally  protected \nexpressive and associative behaviors. Mr. Costello has refrained from associating with certain \nfamily members and intimate friends for peaceful purposes due to fear that such association might \ncause himself or others to be included or renewed on the WPDโs Gang List and subjected to \ncontinued or increased police harassment or other criminal consequences. He has refrained from \n59 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 60 of 62\ncertain non-criminal commercial interactionsโincluding buying gas in his own neighborhoodโ\nfor fear that patronizing businesses in certain parts of town might cause himself or others to be \nincluded on the WPDโs Gang List and subjected to continued or increased police harassment or \nother criminal consequences. He has also refrained from the expressive conduct of taking or \nposting photographs to social media for fear that some non-criminal and non-gang related clothing \nor conduct will be used as grounds to renew his unjustified โactiveโ gang member status. This fear \nand restraint are well-founded, as he has repeatedly been renewed on the WPDโs Gang List and \nsubjected to police harassment and criminal consequences for precisely these types of non-\ncriminal, constitutionally protected associative and expressive actions. \n259.  As a result of K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527โs unconstitutional restrictions, \nPlaintiff  Martel  Costello  has  been  chilled  and  discouraged  from  constitutionally  protected \nexpressive and associative behaviors. Martel Costello has refrained from associating with certain \nfamily members and intimate friends for peaceful purposes due to fear that such association might \ncause himself or others to be arrested, included or renewed on the WPDโs Gang List and subjected \nto continued or increased police harassment or other criminal consequences.  \n260.  As a result of K.S.A. 21-6313 and Policy 527โs unconstitutional restrictions, \nPlaintiff Jeremy Levy, Jr. has been chilled and discouraged from constitutionally protected \nexpressive and associative behaviors. Plaintiff Mr. Levy has refrained from associating with \ncertain family members and intimate friends for peaceful purposes due to fear that such association \nmight cause himself or others to be arrested, included or renewed on the WPDโs Gang List and \nsubjected to continued or increased police harassment or other criminal consequences. \n261.  The Federal Constitution protects Plaintiffsโ right to associate with others and to \nexpress themselves. See U.S. Const. Amend. I. \n60 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 61 of 62\n262.  Defendantsโ maintenance and use of the Gang List therefore unconstitutionally \nchills Plaintiffsโ First Amendment rights to associate and express themselves. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs on behalf of themselves and the putative class they seek to \nrepresent, request that this Court grant the following relief:  \na.  Issue an Order certifying this case as a class action pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure 23(a) and(b)(2);  \nb.  Issue a class-wide judgment declaring that K.S.A. 21-6313, et seq., and the policies, \npractices,  and  conduct  of  Defendants,  as  described  in  this  Complaint,  constitute \nviolations of the rights of Plaintiffs and the class they represent under the U.S. \nConstitution; \nc.  Issue a Preliminary and Permanent Injunction preventing Defendants from maintaining \nthe Gang List, implementing a Gang List or adding any individual to the Gang List in \nthe future, and removing from the Gang List all individuals currently or in the past \ndesignated as Gang Members or Gang Associates, whether characterized as Active or \nInactive; \nd.  Award Plaintiffs reasonable attorneysโ fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988; \nand \ne.  Allow such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper. \n \nDESIGNATION PLACE OF TRIAL \nPlaintiffs designate Wichita, Kansas as the place of trial for this action.  \n \n61 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-01100-EFM-ADM   Document 1   Filed 04/15/21   Page 62 of 62\nDated this 15th day of April, 2021. \n              Respectfully submitted, \n              KANSAS APPLESEED CENTER FOR \n              LAW AND JUSTICE, INC. \n               \n              /s/ Teresa A.
