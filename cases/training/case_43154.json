That part of Defendant's motion seeking expedited relief is denied. The subject of this motion is a matter of considerable importance to the State and its citizens and involves complicated issues of procedural and substantive law. The Court finds that granting this motion with only two days consideration is unreasonable and unwarranted. However, Defendant's motion to dissolve the permanent injunction in this matter is denied without prejudice. The Court will take up this issue after full briefing is submitted by the parties in compliance with and within the deadlines established by this Courts local rules.

    "summary": "<p>This is a case challenging an abortion restriction in the state of Louisiana. Act 620 prevented doctors from providing abortion services in the state unless they secured admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of where they provide abortion care.</p>\r\n<p>On August 22, 2014, three women's reproductive health clinics and two individual doctors who perform abortions filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana. The plaintiffs sued the Attorney General of Louisiana, the Louisiana State Health Officer, the Medical Director of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, and the President of the Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners. Plaintiffs brought suit under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, alleging that Act 620 violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights and two private law firms, plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment, a permanent injunction, and attorneys' fees.&nbsp;On August 26, 2014, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint to add the Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals as a defendant.</p>\r\n<p>On August 31, 2014, Judge John W. deGravelles granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) enjoining enforcement of Act 620 until a hearing could be held to determine whether a preliminary injunction should issue. The TRO required plaintiffs to continue to seek admitting privileges, and allowed the Act to take effect. However, it mandated that plaintiffs would not be subject to the penalties and sanctions allowed in the statute. <em>June Medical Services, LLC v. Caldwell</em>, 2014 WL 4296679 (M.D.La., 2014).</p>\r\n<p>On February 16, 2015, defendants' filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. After hearings on the matter, on May 12 Judge deGravelles granted the motion in part and denied the motion in part. The Court found as a matter of law that Act 620 passed rational basis review, thereby rejecting that portion of plaintiffs' argument. But summary judgment was denied on all other claims. <em>June Medical Services, LLC v. Kliebert</em>, 105 F.Supp.3d 611 (M.D. La., 2015).</p>\r\n<p>On January 26, 2016, Judge deGravelles declared unconstitutional the active admitting privileges requirement of the Act as violating the substantive due process rights of Louisiana women seeking abortions. As such, the court granted a preliminary injunction to enjoin enforcement of the Act as to the plaintiffs. The injunction was ordered to remain in effect until further notice from the court.</p>\r\n<p>On February 10, 2016, defendants appealed the order granting preliminary injunction to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. On that same day, defendants also filed a motion to stay the injunction pending appeal. Concluding that the defendant&rsquo;s probability of success was too low relative to the likely harms that would be inflicted upon Plaintiffs (and others) and in light of the public interest, Judge deGravelles denied the motion for the stay on February 16, 2016. Less than two weeks later, on February 25, 2016, the Fifth Circuit granted defendants' motion for a stay pending appeal, and stayed the district court's injunction. Writing for the panel, Judge Jennifer W. Elrod concluded that defendants had made a strong showing that they were likely to succeed on the merits.</p>\r\n<p>In response to defendants' appeal, the Fifth Circuit remanded the case on August 25, 2016 for the&nbsp;district court to engage in additional fact finding required by the decision in <em>Whole Womans Health v. Hellerstedt</em>. The district court did, and on April 26, 2017, Judge deGravelles declared unconstitutional the active admitting privileges of the Act as a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Judge deGravelles also entered a permanent injunction barring enforcement of the Act. The court entered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendant. On May 10, 2017, Judge deGravelles ordered defendants to pay plaintiffs' reasonable attorney&rsquo;s fees.</p>\r\n<p>However, on May 5, 2017, defendants appealed to the Fifth Circuit and on September 26, 2018, Judges Jerry E. Smith and Edith B. Clement reversed the District Court's decision. Applying the undue burden test and <em>Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt</em>, the majority concluded that the Act and relevant circumstances significantly diverged from <em>Whole Womans Health. </em>The majority found that the Louisiana Act would result in a potential increase of 54 minutes at one of the state's clinics for at most 30% of women. Thus, the Fifth Circuit concluded that the Act did not impose enough of a substantial challenge as required, and upheld the law. <em>June Med. Servs., L.L.C. v. Gee</em>, 905 F.3d 787, 815 (5th Cir. 2018). In his dissent, Judge Patrick E. Higginbotham concluded that the majority failed to meaningfully apply the undue burden test.&nbsp;<em>Id.&nbsp;</em>at 16. In response to the majority's decision, plaintiffs sought an <em>en banc</em> hearing from the full Fifth Circuit, but this request was denied on January 18, 2019.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 4, 2019, the Supreme Court granted petition for writ of certiorari. On June 29, 2020, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, writing for the plurality, reversed the Fifth Circuit's judgment. The plurality concluded that the district court correctly applied the tests established by <em>Casey&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Whole Woman's Health</em>, and that the Fifth Circuit disagreed with the lower court, not as to the legal standard, but as to the factual findings. Because an appellate court can only set aside factual findings if they are \"clearly erroneous,\" and the district court's findings were not clearly erroneous, the plurality upheld the district court's conclusion as proper.&nbsp;Chief Justice John Roberts concurred in the judgment, finding the Louisiana law to be nearly identical to the Texas law struck down in <em>Whole Woman's Health</em>, and thus stare decisis applied even though Chief Justice Roberts dissented in <em>Whole Woman's Health</em>. However, Chief Justice Roberts' concurrence contended that the undue burden standard does not require courts to weigh the law's asserted benefits against the burdens it imposes on abortion access. Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh each authored separate dissents. <em>June Med. Servs. L.L.C. v. Russo</em>, 591 U.S. 299 (2020).</p>\r\n<p>On August 7, 2020, the Fifth Circuit closed the case in light of the Supreme Court opinion. Since then, the parties have continued to dispute two issues: which documents should remain sealed and attorney's fees. On March 22, 2021, plaintiffs filed a renewed motion for attorney's fees in the amount of $8,654,348.18. Nearly a year and a half later, on June 10, 2022, Judge deGravelles approved the joint settlement as to plaintiffs' petition for attorneys' fees and expenses. Under the settlement, plaintiffs accepted $3,800,000.00 as the full and final satisfaction of all claims or demands for attorneys' fees, expenses, or costs arising from the litigation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>That seemed to be the end of the case, but then the Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em><a href=\"../../../../case/43153/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jackson Women's Health Organization v. Dobbs</a></em>. In <em>Dobbs</em>, the Supreme Court held that abortion is not a fundamental right under the United States Constitution. In so holding, the Supreme Court overruled both <em>Roe </em>and <em>Casey</em>, cases relied on in prior <em>June Medical </em>decisions. Three days after the <em>Dobbs&nbsp;</em>decision was released, on June 27, 2022, defendant filed an emergency motion to vacate the court's prior permanent injunction. Defendant argued that because of&nbsp;<em>Dobbs</em>, there was no legal or equitable basis for the permanent injunction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Two days after the emergency motion was filed, the court held that the subject of the motion was of such considerable importance to the State and its citizens and that it involves complicated issues of procedural and substantive law. Therefore, the court refused to grant the motion with only two days consideration, and denied the motion without prejudice, thereby allowing the parties to submit full briefing before issuing a decision on the motion. Defendant filed a motion for reconsideration, which the court denied.</p>\r\n<p>On July 12, 2022, defendant appealed the reconsideration denial to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. On September 21, 2022, the Fifth Circuit dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, because district courts have administrative discretion to manage their dockets and choose to hear full briefing before deciding an issue.</p>\r\n<p>After full briefing, the district court did indeed make a decision. On November 14, 2022, Judge deGravelles vacated the prior permanent injunction, finding that it would not be equitable to maintain the injunction as it stood due to <em>Dobbs</em>.&nbsp;</p>",

Grady Jolly, Circuit Judge:*\nThis case concerns two orders. Following Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s \nHealth Org., 142 S. Ct. 2228 (2022), the State of Louisiana filed an “emer-\ngency Rule 60(b) motion to vacate permanent injunction” concerning the \nenforcement of Act 620, which requires physicians performing abortions to \nhave “active admitting privileges” within thirty miles of the facility at which \nthe abortions are performed. La. R.S. 40:1299.35.2(A)(2). It requested relief \nforthwith or, alternatively, relief within two days of filing its motion. Two \ndays later, the district court denied the State’s motion. The State immedi-\nately filed an “emergency motion for reconsideration” and requested a ruling \nby the next day. The district court again denied the State’s motion. The State \nhas appealed the two orders, but because this court lacks appellate jurisdic-\ntion, we DISMISS.   \nThe question before us is whether this court has jurisdiction over this \nappeal. To address this question, we must look to the scope of the district \ncourt’s orders.    \nThe State first contends that we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1292(a)(1), which gives this court jurisdiction over interlocutory orders \n“continuing . . . or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions.” We disagree. \n“An order by a federal court that relates only to the conduct or progress of \nlitigation  before  that  court . . .  is  not  appealable  under  §  1292(a)(1).” \nGulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., 485 U.S. 271, 279 (1988) \n(citing Switzerland Cheese Ass’n. v. E. Horne’s Mkt., Inc., 385 U.S. 23, 25 \n(1966)). We read the district court’s orders as such.  \n \n* Pursuant to 5th Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this \nopinion  should  not  be  published  and  is  not  precedent  except  under  the  limited \ncircumstances set forth in 5th Circuit Rule 47.5.4. \n2 \n\nCaseC:a 2s2e- 330:1442-5c v  - 0  0D5o2c5u-mJWenDt:- R0L0B51  6  4 D8o7c4u2m3 e  n  tP 5a0g0e :   3 1  0  / 0D3a/2te2  F  iPleadg: e0 96/ 2o8f /82022\nNo. 22-30425 \nIn the first order, the district court stated that it would not grant the \nState the requested relief but would “take up [this] issue after full briefing . . . \nin compliance with and within the deadlines established.” In our view, this \norder constitutes “an administrative decision by the district court to manage \nits docket.” Int’l Ass’n of Machinists & Aerospace Workers Loc. Lodge 2121 \nAFL–CIO v. Goodrich Corp., 410 F.3d 204, 210 (5th Cir. 2005) (holding that \nthis court lacked jurisdiction over orders staying cases pending arbitration). \nOur reading is only bolstered by the district court’s clarification in its second \norder, in which it specifically stated that it “did not deny [the State] the \nunderlying relief it sought” and would not grant the State relief until both \nsides had “an opportunity for full briefing.” We do not construe either of \nthese orders, together or separately, to deny the State’s request for vacatur \non the merits. Instead, we construe the orders as denying only expedited relief. \nSee  e.g.,  Shanks  v.  City  of  Dallas,  752  F.2d  1092,  1095  (5th  Cir.  1981) \n(distinguishing “between those orders that dispose of the claim for relief on \nthe merits or on jurisdictional grounds and those that relate only to pretrial \nprocedures,” since the § 1292(a)(1) exception does not apply to the latter). \nIt is true that the district court stated that it denied without prejudice \nthe State’s motion to dissolve the permanent injunction. But to interpret this \nas a denial of the State’s motion on the merits requires a selective reading of \nboth orders, which this court has previously cautioned against. E.E.O.C. v. \nKerrville Bus Co., 925 F.2d 129, 132 (5th Cir. 1991) (“[T]here must be some \nadditional, substantial indication—whether from the language of the order, \nor the grounds on which it rests, or the circumstances in which it was \nentered—that the district court was acting specifically to deny injunctive \nrelief.”).  In  context,  the  district  court’s  words  do  not  constitute  an \nappealable order. The first order indicates that the district court would defer \nruling on the State’s underlying motion until after full briefing by both \n3 \n\nCaseC:a 2s2e- 330:1442-5c v  - 0  0D5o2c5u-mJWenDt:- R0L0B51  6  4 D8o7c4u2m3 e  n  tP 5a0g0e :   4 1  0  / 0D3a/2te2  F  iPleadg: e0 97/ 2o8f /82022\nNo. 22-30425 \nparties.1 The district court goes even further in its second order by explicitly \nclarifying that its first order did not deny “the underlying relief sought.”2 \nThe district court’s orders cannot be read to have denied the underlying \nrequest for relief when the district court implicitly and explicitly stated its \nintent to defer a ruling on the matter.3 \nAlternatively, the State urges jurisdiction because the district court’s \norders have the “practical effect” of refusing to dissolve an injunction, which \ncontinues to cause irreparable harm that can only be effectively challenged by \nimmediate appeal. We cannot agree.  \nTo have the “practical effect” of refusing to dissolve an injunction, \nthe State must show that the orders have a “direct impact on the merits of \nthe controversy.” See Shanks, 752 F.2d at 1095. We again note that the \ndistrict court’s orders did not touch the merits of the State’s underlying \nrequest  for  relief  but,  for  the  same  reasons  stated  earlier,  acted  as  the \nfunctional equivalent of a scheduling order. See Switzerland Cheese Ass’n, Inc. \n \n1 The district court’s first order states in relevant part:   \nThat part of Defendant’s motion seeking expedited relief is denied.  The subject \nof this motion is a matter of considerable importance to the State and its citizens and \ninvolves complicated issues of procedural and substantive law. The Court finds that \ngranting this motion with only two days consideration is unreasonable and unwarranted. \nHowever, Defendant’s motion to dissolve the permanent injunction in this matter is denied \nwithout prejudice. The Court will take up this issue after full briefing is submitted by the \nparties in compliance with and within the deadlines established by this Courts local rules. \n2 The relevant text in the second order reads: “The Court did not deny Defendant \nthe underlying relief it sought; it merely found that, considering the importance of this \nmatter and the procedural issues involved with Rule 60(b), the Court would not grant \nDefendant relief without an opportunity for full briefing, by both sides.”  \n3 To the extent the district court did address the merits of the State’s request for \nrelief, it noted that “Plaintiffs appear to have an uphill battle,” as recent cases “severely \nundercut” the law on which the injunction stood. Nevertheless, the district court said this \nwas “a question for another day.”  \n4 \n\nCaseC:a 2s2e- 330:1442-5c v  - 0  0D5o2c5u-mJWenDt:- R0L0B51  6  4 D8o7c4u2m3 e  n  tP 5a0g0e :   5 1  0  / 0D3a/2te2  F  iPleadg: e0 98/ 2o8f /82022\nNo. 22-30425 \nv. E. Horne’s Market, Inc., 385 U.S. 23, 25 (1966) (“Orders that in no way \ntouch on the merits of the claim but only relate to pretrial procedures are not \nin our view ‘interlocutory’ within the meaning of § 1292(a)(1).”). \nLastly,  we  hold  that  the  State  has  not  shown  it  is  entitled  to \nmandamus.4 “Only a showing of exceptional circumstances amounting to a \njudicial usurpation of power or a clear abuse of discretion will justify granting \na mandamus petition.” In re Depuy Orthopaedics, Inc., 870 F.3d 345, 350 (5th \nCir. 2017) (cleaned up) (listing permissible scenarios warranting mandamus). \nEven if the district court’s initial order and its reconsideration denial are not \nthe functional equivalent of a scheduling order, the district court did not \nabuse its discretion denying the only motion presented to it—one to vacate \nforthwith  or  within  two  days.  A  district  court  “has  broad  discretion  and \ninherent authority to manage its docket.” In re Deepwater Horizon, 988 F.3d \n192, 197 (5th Cir. 2021) (per curiam). This district court acted prudently, \nwith no evident dilatory purpose. The State has not persuaded this court that \nthe district court abused its discretion when the district court refused to rule \non the State’s motion in the expedited fashion requested.  \nFor  the  reasons  stated  above,  we  dismiss  this  appeal  for  lack  of \nappellate  jurisdiction  and  deny  the  State’s  alternative  petition  for \nmandamus.5 To be sure, however, we respectfully direct the district court to \nexpeditiously  address  any  merits  claims  that  may  be  submitted  by  the \nrespective parties and to enter an order accordingly.  \nAPPEAL DISMISSED; MANDAMUS DENIED.  \n \n4 This court has already considered and denied the State’s mandamus petition. The \nState has again presented this issue as an alternative request to its appeal.  \n5 The motion of June Medical to dismiss this appeal is denied as moot.  \n5 ",

But he certainly is wrong to suggest that my position is in any way inconsistent with that \ndisavowal. Applying strict scrutiny would require “any regulation touching upon the abortion decision” to be the \nleast restrictive means to further a compelling state interest. Casey, 505 U.S. at 871, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality \nopinion) (emphasis added). Casey however recognized that such a test would give “too little acknowledgement and \nimplementation” to the State’s “legitimate interests in the health of the woman and in protecting the potential life \nwithin her.” Ibid. Under Casey, abortion regulations are valid so long as they do not pose a substantial obstacle and \nmeet the threshold requirement of being “reasonably related” to a “legitimate purpose.” Id., at 878, 112 S.Ct. 2791; \nid., at 882, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (joint opinion). \n \n3  Justice GORSUCH considers this is a “nonexistent ruling” nowhere to be found in Whole Woman’s Health. Post, at \n  2181 (dissenting opinion). I disagree. Whole Woman’s Health first surveyed the benefits of Texas’s admitting \nprivileges requirement. 579 U. S., at –––– – ––––, 136 S.Ct. (slip op., at 23–24). The Court then transitioned to \nexamining the law’s burdens: “At the same time, the record evidence indicates that the admitting-privileges \nrequirement places a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman’s choice.” Id., at ––––, 136 S.Ct. (slip op., at 24) \n(internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added). And the Court made clear that a law which has the purpose or \neffect of placing “a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains \nviability” imposes an “undue burden” and therefore violates the Constitution. Id., at ––––, 136 S.Ct. (slip op., at 1) \n(internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis deleted).

But my analysis, like Casey, is limited to the law’s effect on the availability of \nabortion. \n \n6  I agree with Justice ALITO that the validity of admitting privileges laws “depend[s] on numerous factors that may \n  differ from State to State.” Post, at 2157 (dissenting opinion). And I agree with Justice GORSUCH that “[w]hen it \ncomes to the factual record, litigants normally start the case on a clean slate.” Post, at 2178 (dissenting opinion). \nAppreciating that others may in good faith disagree, however, I cannot view the record here as in any pertinent \nrespect sufficiently different from that in Whole Woman’s Health to warrant a different outcome. \n \n1  In practice, this doctrine’s application has been unconvincing and unpredictable, which has long caused me to \n  question its legitimacy. See, e.g., United States v. Sineneng-Smith, 590 U. S. ––––, –––– – ––––, 140 S.Ct. 1575, ––– \nL.Ed.2d –––– (2020) (THOMAS, J., concurring) (slip op., at 6–9); Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, 579 U. S. \n––––, –––– – ––––, 136 S.Ct. 2292, 195 L.Ed.2d 665 (2016) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 2–5); Kowalski, 543 \nU.S. at 135, 125 S.Ct. 564 (THOMAS, J., concurring). For example, the Court has held that attorneys cannot bring suit \nto vindicate the Sixth Amendment rights of their potential clients due to the lack of a current close relationship, id., \nat 130–131, 125 S.Ct. 564, but the Court permits defendants to seek relief based on the Fourteenth Amendment \nequal protection rights of potential jurors whom they have never met, Powers, 499 U.S. at 410–416, 111 S.Ct. 1364; \nJ. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B., 511 U.S. 127, 129, 114 S.Ct. 1419, 128 L.Ed.2d 89 (1994). And today, the plurality \nreaffirms our precedent allowing beer vendors to assert the Fourteenth Amendment rights of their potential \ncustomers. Ante, at 2118 – 2119, 114 S.Ct. 1419 (citing Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 192, 97 S.Ct. 451, 50 L.Ed.2d 397 \n(1976)). But it is fair to wonder whether gun vendors could expect to receive the same privilege if they seek to \nvindicate the Second Amendment rights of their customers. Given this Court’s ad hoc approach to third-party \nstanding and its tendency to treat the Second Amendment as a second-class right, their time would be better spent \nwaiting for Godot. \n \n2  Common-law courts’ recognition of prochain ami or “next friend” standing is not inconsistent with this point. In \n  those cases, the third party was “no party to the suit in the technical sense” but rather served as “an officer of the \ncourt” and was legally “appointed by [the court] to look after the interests of [the party lacking legal capacity],” who \nremained the real party in interest on “whom the judgment in the action [was] consequently binding.” Blumenthal v. \nCraig, 81 F. 320, 321–322 (CA3 1897) (internal quotation marks omitted). In contrast, the real parties in interest \nhere—women seeking abortions in Louisiana—cannot be bound by a judgment against abortionists and abortion \nclinics. \n \n3  Although the Court concluded that the abortionists had standing to challenge the constitutionality of abortion \n  regulations in Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179, 93 S.Ct. 739, 35 L.Ed.2d 201 (1973), it did so only in dicta, id., at 188–189, \n93 S.Ct. 739. The abortionists’ coplaintiffs were pregnant women whom the Court determined had standing to \nassert their own rights, and thus whether the abortionists had standing was “a matter of no great consequence.” Id., \nat 188, 93 S.Ct. 739. Even so, the Court only cursorily considered the question whether the threat of prosecution \nfaced by the abortionists was a sufficiently direct injury under the Court’s then-existing standing doctrine, id., at \n188–189, 93 S.Ct. 739, which was considerably more lenient than our current understanding. The Court did not \nengage in any meaningful Article III analysis or refer to this Court’s third-party standing doctrine. Ibid.; see also \nAkron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U.S. 416, 440, n. 30, 103 S.Ct. 2481, 76 L.Ed.2d 687 (1983) \n(concluding without any analysis that an abortionist had standing to raise a claim on behalf of his minor patients). \nAnd notably, the abortionists in that case had brought suit to vindicate their own constitutional rights to “practic[e] \ntheir ... professio[n].” Doe, supra, at 186, 93 S.Ct. 739; see also Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 \n55 \n \n\n \n \nJune Medical Services L. L. C. v. Russo, 140 S.Ct. 2103 (2020)   \n207 L.Ed.2d 566, 20 Cal. Daily Op. Serv. 6012, 2020 Daily Journal D.A.R. 6456... \n \nU.S. 52, 62, 96 S.Ct. 2831, 49 L.Ed.2d 788 (1976) (concluding, without any analysis of Article III or the third-party \nstanding doctrine, that abortionists had standing in a suit alleging violations of both their own constitutional rights \nand those of their clients). \n \n4  Three Justices of this Court have recently taken the position that this rule from Marks, 430 U.S. 188, 97 S.Ct. 990, 51 \n  L.Ed.2d 260, does not necessarily apply in all 4–1–4 cases, and that such decisions can sometimes produce “no \ncontrolling opinion at all.” Ramos v. Louisiana, 590 U. S. ––––, ––––, 140 S.Ct. 1390, 206 L.Ed.2d 583 (2020) \n(principal opinion) (slip op., at 18). But even under their view, Justice Blackmun’s plurality in Singleton would not be \nconsidered binding precedent. \n \n5  Notably, plaintiffs point to no evidence in the record of women who seek abortions in Louisiana actually opposing \n  this law on the ground that it violates their constitutional rights. \n \n6  Although plaintiffs initially argued that Louisiana’s law also violated their procedural due process rights by requiring \n  them to obtain admitting privileges in an unreasonably short time, App. 24, 28, they have since abandoned that \nclaim. And even if they had asserted violations of their own rights before this Court, those legal injuries would be \ninsufficient to establish standing for a distinct claim based on their clients’ putative rights.

Because plaintiffs lack standing under Article III, I would instead remand with instructions to \ndismiss for lack of jurisdiction. Alternatively, if I were to reach the merits because a majority of the Court concludes \nwe have jurisdiction, I would affirm, as plaintiffs have failed to carry their burden of demonstrating that Act 620 is \nunconstitutional, even under our precedents. \n \n1  Quality  Check,  Find  a  Gold  Seal  Health  Care  Organization  (2020), \n  https://www.qualitycheck.org/search/?keyword=louisiana#keyword=louisiana&accreditationprogram=Hospital \n(listing “[o]rganizations that have achieved The Gold Seal of Approval from the Joint Commission”). \n \n2  Ryan, Negligent Credentialing: A Cause of Action for Hospital Peer Review Decisions, 59 How.

Brief for Petitioners in No. 181323, p. 41, n. 7. As the record in this case shows, there is reason \nto doubt that the prospect of rejection provides a sufficient incentive for doctors to pursue privileges vigorously. See \ninfra, at 2160 – 2165. Perhaps that is because only rejections for lack of “professional competence or professional \nconduct” need to be disclosed to the relevant federal database. 45 C.F.R. §§ 60.12, 60.3 (2019). Petitioners also have \nnot explained how a non-competence-based rejection would have any bearing on future applications for privileges. \n \n8  The plurality claims that my criticism of the District Court’s “good faith” standard “is not a legal argument,” and \n  instead reflects a view of the facts—namely that the Does acted in “bad faith.” Ante, at 2124 – 2125. But the District \nCourt used “good faith” as the legal standard to assess whether Act 620 would cause the Does to stop performing \nabortions. Neither the District Court nor the plurality has defined “good faith.” Unless that term reflects what the \ndoctors would have done if the incentives had been reversed—and the plurality does not argue that it does—there \nis a legal issue. \n \n9  The Fifth Circuit concluded that it would be “nearly impossible” for Doe 1 to get privileges, June Medical Services L. \n  L. C. v. Gee, 905 F.3d 787, 812 (2018), and for this reason, the plurality does not linger on Doe 1. Ante, at 2124. \nUnder the correct legal standard, however, it is not at all clear that Doe 1 made the effort required, at least with \nrespect to Christus Health in Shreveport. He applied there for courtesy privileges, received letters instructing him to \npick up a badge, and when he called to clarify the meaning of letters sent to him, an unnamed doctor supposedly \ntold him that he should apply for “some kind of a nonstaff caregiver type” position, App. 725, and he then ceased all \nefforts to get courtesy staff privileges at Christus, id., at 728. A person with a strong personal incentive to obtain \ncourtesy privileges would not necessarily have taken this somewhat cryptic advice as a definite rejection of his \napplication. \n \n10  The suggestion that Doe 2’s abortion practice could have eluded Christus (and therefore that it would be an \n  impediment to obtaining privileges again) blinks reality. There is no evidence that the hospital was unaware of Doe \n2’s abortion practice when he was on staff. Nor is there reason to believe that Christus would not have reviewed \nDoe 2’s professional practice history, Record 12190–12191, or demanded disclosure of past malpractice claims at \nthe time he held privileges there, id., at 12194; App. 374 (medical malpractice claim against Doe 2 arising from \npractice at June Medical); see also supra, at 2154 – 2156 (reviewing hospital credentialing). \nThe notion that Doe 3’s abortion practice has escaped attention for 30 years is even harder to believe. Christus has \nreappointed Doe 3 in recent years based on a biennial process that assesses “[p]erformance and conduct in each \nhospital and/or other healthcare organizatio[n]” outside of Christus. Record 12136; see also ibid. (requiring staff \nmembers to submit “reapplication form [with] complete information to update his/her file on items listed in his/her \noriginal application”). Doe 3 spends “Thursday afternoon” and “all day on Saturday” at the abortion clinic, App. 206, \nand therefore presumably is unavailable for his on-call duties at Christus at those times, Record 12123. Doe 3 is \naffiliated with the National Abortion Federation and has attended “many” of their national conferences to obtain \ncontinuing medical education credits. App. 203. And Doe 3 indicated that all eight OB/GYNs in Bossier City learned \nof his abortion practice when discussing a possible on-call rotation system. See id., at 200–202. If those facts did not \ntip off the hospital, perhaps Christus learned about Doe 3’s abortion practice when one of his patients was \n57 \n \n\n \n \nJune Medical Services L. L. C. v. Russo, 140 S.Ct. 2103 (2020)   \n207 L.Ed.2d 566, 20 Cal. Daily Op. Serv. 6012, 2020 Daily Journal D.A.R. 6456... \n \ntransferred directly from June Medical to Christus, bleeding and in need of a hysterectomy, id., at 217–218, or when \nDoe 1’s privileges application named Doe 3 as a peer reference, Record 13025. Whatever the Christus bylaws say, \nabortion practice does not appear to have presented an obstacle to a successful association with the hospital. \n \n11  Each year, a physician with courtesy staff privileges at WKBC may have as many as 49 “patient contacts,” which are \n  defined as “any admission and management, consultation, procedure, response to emergency call, and newborns.” \nRecord 9628, 9642 (capitalization omitted). And contrary to the plurality’s suggestion, the fact that WKBC imposes \nthe same “[f]actors for [e]valuation” for courtesy and active staff-applicants says little, since those factors do not set \nout any quantum of patient records, and require only “relevant ... experience” for the position sought. Id., at 9669. \n \n12  The plurality suggests that, if Doe 3 were to leave abortion practice, it would be attributable to Act 620. But even \n  the most ardent opponents of Act 620 did not contemplate that the law would prompt abortion doctors who \nsatisfied the law’s requirements to quit. Record 11231–11234, 11291. And if this outcome was not foreseeable at \nthe time of enactment, it is hard to see how the District Court could blame Act 620 for causing Doe 3 to leave \nabortion practice. Cf. Restatement (Second) of Torts § 440, §442A (1964). \n \n13  See, e.g., ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct 1.7–1.9, 1.18 (2016). \n   \n14  See Brief for 2,624 Women Injured by Abortion et al. as Amici Curiae 14–22 (firsthand accounts of abortion \n  procedures in Louisiana); Brief for Priests for Life et al. as Amici Curiae 7–8, and App. (accounts from Louisiana and \nother States). \n \n15  Four cases to reach this Court have featured exclusively women plaintiffs. See Beal v. Doe, 432 U.S. 438, 97 S.Ct. \n  2366, 53 L.Ed.2d 464 (1977); Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464, 97 S.Ct. 2376, 53 L.Ed.2d 484 (1977); Poelker v.

But there are a number of cases in which women have been co-plaintiffs along with abortion \nclinics or providers. See Leavitt v. Jane L., 518 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 2068, 135 L.Ed.2d 443 (1996) (per curiam); Ohio v. \nAkron Center for Reproductive Health, 497 U.S. 502, 110 S.Ct. 2972, 111 L.Ed.2d 405 (1990); Hodgson v. Minnesota, \n497 U.S. 417, 110 S.Ct. 2926, 111 L.Ed.2d 344 (1990); Williams v. Zbaraz, 448 U. S. 358, 100 S.Ct. 2694, 65 L.Ed.2d \n831 (1980); Harris v. McRae, 448 U.

More recently, \nabortion patients have litigated in the lower courts using their names, those of legal guardians, or pseudonyms. Brief \nfor Respondent/Cross-Petitioner 39; see also Brief for State of Arkansas et al. as Amici Curiae 3, and n. 1. \n \n1  The State has not asked the Court to depart from the Casey standard. \n   \n2  In my view, the District Court on remand should also address the State’s new argument (raised for the first time in \n  this Court) that these doctors and clinics lack third-party standing. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n58 \n ",

This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief brought under the United \nStates Constitution and 42 U.S.C. § 1983, to challenge the constitutionality of Louisiana \nHouse Bill 388, Regular Session (2014), to be codified at La. Rev. Stat. § 40:1299.35.2 \n(“H.B. 388” or the “Act”).   \n2.  The Act requires that every doctor who provides abortions have active admitting \nprivileges at a hospital not more than thirty miles from where the abortion is performed, and \ngives doctors a mere eighty-one days to comply, an impossible task in light of the fact that \nthe hospitals within the area proscribed by the statute can take anywhere from 90 days to \nseven months to decide on a doctor’s privileges application. \n3.  Despite this and other obstacles, each doctor who does not currently have such \nprivileges at Clinic Plaintiffs has submitted at least one application at a hospital within thirty \nmiles of the clinic.  \n4.  Upon information and belief, if the statute is enforced on its effective date of \nSeptember 1, 2014, it is not at all clear that any doctor currently providing abortions at a \nclinic in Louisiana will be able to continue providing those services, thereby eliminating \naccess to legal abortion in Louisiana.   \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 14    08/26/14   Page 3 of 11\n5.  As such, the admitting privileges requirement threatens irreparable injury to the \nClinic Plaintiffs, their staff, and their patients, including, but not limited to, by depriving \nPlaintiff’s patients’ of their constitutional right to an abortion. \n6.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief from these constitutional \ndeprivations. \n \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims under 28 U.S.C. § \n1331 and 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3)-(4). \n8.  Plaintiffs’ action for declaratory and injunctive relief is authorized by 28 U.S.C. §§ \n2201 and 2202 and by Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n9.  Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because a substantial part of the \nevents giving rise to this action occurred in this district, and the majority of Defendants, who \nare sued in their official capacities, carry out their official duties at offices located in this \ndistrict.  \nPARTIES \n10.  Plaintiffs are 3 of only 5 clinics that provide abortions in the entire state of \nLouisiana.   \n11.  Hope is a women’s reproductive health clinic located in Shreveport, Louisiana, and \nhas been providing care since 1980.  Hope is a member of the National Abortion Federation, \nand is licensed and inspected annually by DHH.

James David Caldwell is the Attorney General of the state of Louisiana.  As \nAttorney General, Defendant Caldwell has the authority to enforce the Act.  He is sued in his \nofficial capacity. \n17.  Kathy Kliebert is the Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Health and \nHospitals.  The Department of Health and Hospitals has the authority to revoke or deny \nclinics’ licenses for violation of this or any other law.  La. Rev. Stat. § 40:2175.6.  She is \nbeing sued in her official capacity. \n18.  Jimmy Guidry is the Louisiana State Health Officer and Medical Director of the \nLouisiana Department of Health and Hospitals.  He is being sued in his official capacity. \n19.  Mark Henry Dawson, MD, is the President of the Louisiana State Board of Medical \nExaminers (the “Board”).  The Board has the authority to take disciplinary action against any \nphysician.  La. Rev. Stat. § 37:1263 et seq.  He is being sued in his official capacity. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n20.  Legal abortion is one of the safest procedures in medical practice.  Abortion \ncomplications are exceedingly rare: nationwide, less than 0.3% of abortion patients \nexperience a complication that requires hospitalization.  The Clinic Plaintiffs’ hospitalization \nrates are even lower: at Hope, over the last 20 years, just 0.007% of patients experienced \ncomplications requiring hospitalization.  At Bossier, the complication rate is only 0.004% for \nthe past 5 years, and Causeway’s complication rate for the past 5 years was just 0.0009%. \n21.   Even though abortion is exceedingly safe, Plaintiffs provide high quality care in the \nrare event of complications requiring hospitalization.  Although most complications related \nto abortions are safely and appropriately managed in the clinic setting, in the rare event that a \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 14    08/26/14   Page 6 of 11\npatient needs to be transferred to a hospital, Plaintiffs have robust policies in place to ensure \na high level of care.   \n22.  Complications from abortion are not only rare, but the few complications that do \noccur may not present until after a patient has left the clinic.  Upon discharge, Plaintiffs \nprovide their patients with phone numbers to call if they experience complications or have \nconcerns at any time after they have left the clinic.  In rare cases where emergency care is \nrequired, Plaintiffs’ staff will refer the patient to a local emergency room, as is also \nconsistent with the standard of care. \n23.  Many of Plaintiff Clinics’ patients travel from other parts of the state, or from \nneighboring states, to reach the clinic.  If these patients experience a complication that \nrequires emergency treatment after they have returned home, it is the standard of care to refer \nthe patient to the hospital closest to her, rather than to require the patient to travel in an \nemergency situation to a hospital where her physician may have admitting privileges.   \n24.  In the event that a patient does require post-procedure care at a hospital, patients \ntypically are treated by the emergency room doctors on an outpatient basis and released.  To \nthe extent complications arise, the majority are similar to those encountered by women \nexperiencing miscarriage, which emergency room doctors can, and routinely do, handle. \n25.  Requiring abortion providers to have hospital admitting privileges, therefore, does \nnot increase patient safety and is medically unnecessary. \nTHE ACT AND ITS IMPACT \n26.  The Act provides that every doctor who provides abortions must “have active \nadmitting privileges at a hospital that is located not further than thirty miles from the location \nat which the abortion is performed or induced and that provides obstetrical or gynecological \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 14    08/26/14   Page 7 of 11\nhealth care services (“admitting privileges requirement”).   Exhibit 11 at § (A)(2)(a) \n(amending La. Rev. Stat. § 1299.35.2).  “Active admitting privileges” means that “the \nphysician is a member in good standing of the medical staff of a hospital that is currently \nlicensed by the department, with the ability to admit a patient and to provide diagnostic and \nsurgical services to such patient.”  Id. \n27.  Any doctor who violates this provision is subject to a fine of not more than four \nthousand dollars.  Id. at § (A)(2)(c).  Furthermore, failure to comply with the admitting \nprivileges requirement will subject a clinic to adverse licensure action, up to and including \nlicense revocation.  Id. at § (A)(1). \n28.  No physician who provides abortions at Bossier City or Causeway has admitting \nprivileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic. Although one physician at Hope has \nadmitting privileges, the physician who provides the majority of abortions at Hope does not.   \n29.  Although all of Clinic Plaintiffs’ physicians who do not have admitting privileges \nhave applied for such privileges at a local hospital, there is not enough time for the hospitals \nto consider and decide the submitted applications before the Act takes effect.  The process of \napplying for privileges and receiving a decision from a hospital on such an application can \nand generally does take months. \n30.  Hospitals have discretion in granting admitting privileges to doctors, and can deny \nprivileges for reasons unrelated to qualification, such as a minimum number of guaranteed \nhospital admissions per year; political, ideological, or religious reasons; or based on \nresidency requirements. \n31.  If the Act takes effect, Plaintiffs Hope, Bossier, and Causeway will stop providing \nabortion services.  It is not at all clear that either of the other two clinics in Louisiana who \n                                                 \n1 Exhibit 1 to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction, filed August 22, 2014. \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 14    08/26/14   Page 8 of 11\ncurrently provide abortions will able to continue to do so as of September 1, because none of \nthe doctors who perform abortions there currently have admitting privileges at a qualifying \nhospital.  The Act, therefore, will make legal abortion unavailable in the state of Louisiana.  \n32.  Louisiana law does not require a physician providing any type of medical procedure \nother than abortion to have admitting privileges at a local hospital.  Physicians perform \nsimilar, and often higher risk, outpatient procedures in their offices without admitting \nprivileges. \nIRREPARABLE INJURY \n33.  Plaintiffs and their patients will suffer irreparable harm from the violation of their \nconstitutional rights if the Act goes into effect. \n34.  The Act will force Plaintiffs to close their clinics and will prevent them from \nproviding comprehensive reproductive health care to their patients.  It is not at all clear that \neither of the other two clinics currently providing abortions in Louisiana could continue to do \nso as of September 1. \n35.  The Act will jeopardize women’s health, shutting down health centers that provide \nabortions without medical justification, and either eliminate or severely limit the availability \nof abortions in the state.  As a result, many Louisiana women will be forced to carry their \npregnancies to term, while other may resort to self-abortion. \n36.  Even if some women are able to obtain an abortion in Louisiana after the Act takes \neffect, by severely reducing the number of legal abortion providers in the state, the Act will \nforce women to incur additional travel costs and delays in obtaining an abortion.  Although \nabortion is one of the safest surgical procedures, the risk of complications, as well as the cost \nof the procedure, increases as the pregnancy advances.  Given that many of Plaintiffs’ \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 14    08/26/14   Page 9 of 11\npatients live below the federal poverty line, the increased costs alone will make it impossible \nfor some women to obtain an abortion. \n37.  The Act will therefore irreparably harm Plaintiffs’ patients in two ways: threatening \nthe health of women seeking abortions, and depriving women of their constitutionally \nprotected right to obtain a pre-viability abortion. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \n(Procedural Due Process) \n38.  The allegations of paragraphs 1 through 34 are incorporated as though fully set \nforth herein. \n39.  The Act violates Plaintiffs’ rights not to be deprived of liberty and property without \ndue process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \nCOUNT II \n(Substantive Due Process – Right to Privacy) \n40.  The allegations of paragraphs 1 through 34 are incorporated as though fully set \nforth herein. \n41.  The Act violates Plaintiffs’ patients’ right to liberty and privacy as guaranteed by \nthe due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution because it has \nthe unlawful purpose and effect of imposing an undue burden on women’s right to choose \nabortion before viability. \n \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court: \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 14    08/26/14   Page 10 of 11\n1.  declare Louisiana House Bill 388, Regular Session (2014), unconstitutional \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; \n2.  without bond, enjoin Defendants, their employees, agents, and successors in \noffice from enforcing H.B. 388; \n3.  award Plaintiffs costs and attorneys’ fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988; and \n4.  grant Plaintiffs such other, further, and different relief as the Court may deem \njust and proper. \nRespectfully submitted this 26th day of August, 2014. \n            /s/ William E.

KLIEBERT, Secretary,   \nLouisiana Department of Health and   \nHospitals, \n   \nDefendant.\n \n \n \nRULING ON DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR STAY PENDING APPEAL, FOR \nEXPEDITED CONSIDERATION, AND FOR TEMPORARY STAY \n \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nBefore the Court is the Defendant’s Motion for Stay Pending Appeal, for Expedited \nConsideration, and for Temporary Stay (“Motion for Stay”), (Doc. 229), as well as the \nDefendant’s Memorandum in Support of Her Motion for Stay Pending Appeal, for Expedited \nConsideration, and for Temporary Stay (“Supporting Memorandum”), (Doc. 229-1) \n(collectively, “Defendant’s Motions”). These documents were filed by Doctor Rebekah Gee \n(“Gee,” “Secretary,” or “Defendant”) in her official capacity as Secretary of the Louisiana \nDepartment of Health and Hospitals (“DHH”), who has replaced her predecessor, Ms. Kathy H. \n1 of 30 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 234    02/16/16   Page 2 of 30\nKliebert (“Kliebert”).1 To the request sought in the Motion for Stay and the points made in the \nSupporting Memorandum, Plaintiffs—June Medical Services LLC, d/b/a Hope Medical Group \nfor Women (“Hope”); Bossier City Medical Suite (“Bossier”); Choice, Inc., of Texas, d/b/a \nCauseway Medical Clinic (“Causeway”);2 Doctor John Doe 1 (“Doe 1”); and Doctor John Doe 2 \n(“Doe 2”), (collectively, “Plaintiffs”)—have responded with the Memorandum in Opposition to \nDefendant’s Motion to Stay the Preliminary Injunction Pending Appeal (“Opposition”). (Doc. \n232; see also Doc. 216 at 5, 9.)  \nSo as to win her requested stay, Defendant bore the burden of proving four separate \nelements: (1) a strong showing that she will likely prevail on the merits, (2) proof that she will be \nirreparably harmed in a stay’s absence, (3) the relative unlikelihood that other parties and \npersons interested in the proceeding would be substantially injured, and (4) that the public \ninterest favors a stay’s issue. Generally, a stay is an extraordinary remedy, and the burden to \ndemonstrate that a stay is warranted is rather heavy, with the need to balance equities paramount. \nHaving evaluated the arguments raised by Plaintiffs and Defendant (collectively, “Parties”), both \nat the telephonic conference held on February 10, 2016, and in their most recent filings, this \nCourt concludes that Defendant has not shown she is likely to prevail. The Court’s application of \nthe undue burden test is amply supported by existing precedent and the weight of the evidence. \nHer other ground for reversal, that this Court must grant absolute deference to Defendant’s \nstatutory interpretation at odds with the plain and unambiguous wording of the statute, is \n                                                      \n1 This recent change may induce some confusion. Whenever this Ruling refers to the actions of \nthe Secretary prior to Gee’s appointment on January 5, 2016, Kliebert was the “Secretary.” This \nRuling will distinguish between the two women whenever practical.  \n2 The three clinics are suing on behalf of themselves and their patients, physicians, and staff. \n(See, e.g., Doc. 14 at 1–2; see also Doc. 232 at 1.) By stipulation, the Ruling covers Doctor John \nDoe 4. (Doc. 224.) \n2 of 30 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 234    02/16/16   Page 3 of 30\nlikewise unlikely to succeed. With her showing on these two points insufficiently convincing, \nprecedent compels the preservation of the status quo, “the last, peaceable, noncontested status of \nthe parties,” Kos Pharms., Inc. v. Andrx Corp., 369 F.3d 700, 708 (3d Cir. 2004). The harm to all \npersons and parties will thereby be minimized, substantial injuries to many likely prevented, \nuntil a final legal determination regarding the proper application of a well-established \nconstitutional right can definitively be made.  \nFor these reasons, as more fully stated below, this Court DENIES the Defendant’s \nMotion for Stay Pending Appeal, for Expedited Consideration, and for Temporary Stay, (Doc. \n232). \n \nII.  BACKGROUND3 \nA.  RELEVANT FACTS  \nOn January 26, 2016, this Court issued its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law \n(“Ruling”). (Doc. 216.) Briefly put, after reviewing the Parties’ extensive evidentiary \nsubmissions and six days’ worth of testimony, this Court preliminarily enjoined Defendant from \nenforcing Section A(2)(a) of Act Number 620 (“Act” or “Act 620”), which amended Louisiana \nRevised Statutes § 40:1299.35.2. (Id. at 5.) The Court did so upon finding Act 620 to violate “the \nsubstantive due process rights of Louisiana women to obtain an abortion, a right guaranteed by \nthe Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution as established in Roe v. Wade, 410 \nU.S. 113, 93 S. Ct. 705, 35 L. Ed. 2d 147 (1973) . . ., and pursuant to the test first set forth in \nPlanned Parenthood of Se. Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 112 S. Ct. 2791, 120 L. Ed. 2d 674 \n                                                      \n3 Only the facts relevant to the instant dispute are here recapped. An exhaustive summary \nappears in the Court’s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. (Doc. 216.)  \n3 of 30 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 234    02/16/16   Page 4 of 30\n(1992), and subsequently refined by the Fifth Circuit.” (Id. at 8.) The Supreme Court’s major \ncases total three: Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124, 127 S. Ct. 1610, 167 L. Ed. 2d 480 (2007); \nCasey, 505 U.S. 833; and Roe, 410 U.S. 113. The key Fifth Circuit cases number at least five: \nWhole Woman’s Health v. Cole, 790 F.3d 563 (5th Cir. 2015); Whole Woman’s Health v. Lakey, \n769 F.3d 285 (5th Cir. 2014); Jackson Women’s Health Org. v. Currier, 760 F.3d 448 (5th Cir. \n2014); Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex. Surgical Health Servs. v. Abbott, 748 F.3d 583 (5th \nCir. 2014) (“Abbott II”); and Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex. Surgical Health Servs. v. \nAbbott, 734 F.3d 406 (5th Cir. 2013) (“Abbott I”).  \nOn February 10, 2016, upon Defendant’s request, “[f]or the reasons stated” in the Ruling \n(Doc. 216), and pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58,4 the Judgment (“Judgment”) \nissued. (Doc. 227.) Its second paragraph preliminarily enjoined  \nDefendant Kathy H. Kliebert and her successors, as well as any and all \nemployees, agents, entities, or other persons acting in concert with her,  . . . from \nenforcing LA. R.S. § 40:1299.35.2 et seq. against the following persons: Doctor \nJohn Doe 1; Doctor John Doe 2; June Medical Services, LLC, d/b/a Hope \nMedical Group for Women, and its physicians and staff; Bossier City Medical \nSuite, as well as its physicians and staff; Choice, Inc. of Texas, d/b/a Causeway \nMedical Clinic, and its physicians and staff, including Doctor John Doe 4; and \nany and all others encompassed by the Parties’ stipulations. \n \n(Id. at 1–2.) \n  On that same day, Defendant filed two separate documents. The first—Defendant’s \nNotice of Appeal (“Notice”)—simply gave the required notice that the Defendant has appealed \nthe Judgment and the Ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. (Doc. \n228.) The second was the Motion for Stay and the Supporting Memorandum, its requests three in \n                                                      \n4 Unless otherwise noted, any and all references to “Rules” or “Rule []” in this order are to the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n4 of 30 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 234    02/16/16   Page 5 of 30\nnumber: (1) “for a stay of the Court’s judgment (Doc. 227) and ruling (Doc. 216),” pending their \nappeal; (2) “for expedited consideration” of the Motion for Stay; and (3) “for a temporary stay \npending the Court’s disposition” of the Motion for Stay and, if denied, “pending disposition of \nany stay motion filed in the court of appeals.” (Doc. 229 at 1.) At the telephonic conference held \non February 10, 2016, bearing in mind both Plaintiffs’ explicit opposition as well as the \nexpiration of the temporary restraining order—and thus any protection that it afforded any and \nall parties and persons—upon the Ruling’s release, (Doc. 233 at 8–9), this Court denied \nDefendant’s request for a temporary stay pending consideration of the Motion for Stay. (Doc. \n231 at 1–2.) In addition, with Defendant’s consent, this Court authorized Plaintiffs to more \nformally respond to the Motion for Stay and the Supporting Memorandum on or before February \n12, 2016, (Id. at 2), effectively denying Defendant’s second request for a ruling on its recent \nmotions on or before that date, (Doc. 229 at 1).  \nFollowing the hearing, one issue, the subject of this order, remained: whether this Court \nshould stay its own Ruling and Judgment. (See, e.g., Doc. 229-1.)  \n \nB.  PARTIES’ ARGUMENTS \n1.  Defendant’s Points \nThe Defendant correctly states the four factors which must be considered in determining \nwhether a stay should issue —“(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he \nis likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a \nstay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the \nproceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies,” Abbott I, 734 F.3d at 410 & n.10 (internal \n5 of 30 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 234    02/16/16   Page 6 of 30\nquotation marks omitted)—and now maintains that all four favor her request. (Doc. 229-1 at 5–\n14.)  \nInitially, Defendant contends reversal of the Ruling and Judgment on “either of two \ngrounds” is “likely.” (Id. at 6.) First, as she has read the Ruling and this circuit’s precedent, this \n“Court’s ‘large fraction’ analysis departs from the Fifth Circuit’s ‘large fraction’ analysis.” (Id. \nat 6.) In making this conclusion, Defendant describes this Court’s two alternative methods for \ncalculating large fraction in the following terms. At first, the Court took the annual number of \nabortions provided in 2013 by the four Louisiana-based doctors who have yet to obtain the \nadmitting privileges required by Act 620, divided by the total number of abortions provided in \nLouisiana in 2013 (“Method 1”). As an additional calculation, this Court then took the number of \nLouisiana women of reproductive age, minus the number of abortions performed in 2013 by non-\nprivileged Louisiana doctors, divided by the Louisiana reproductive-age women (“Method 2”). \n(Id. at 7–8.) The controlling standard, by Defendant’s reckoning, mandated that this Court \n“determine[] the fraction of women burdened by an admitting privileges law by (1) taking the \nnumber of women who must travel significantly farther to reach a qualified provider, and (2) \ndividing by all women of reproductive age in the state.” (Id. at 6 (citing to Abbott I, 734 F.3d at \n415, and Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 598, 600). \nDefendant discerns fatal flaws in the Court’s two methods. (Id.) In her view, this Court’s \nMethod 1 employed an “incorrect” numerator as well as an “incorrect” denominator. (Id. at 8.) \nThe numerator should not have incorporated the actual and documented number of abortions \nprovided by the relevant doctors in 2013. (See Doc. 216 ¶¶ 308, 311, at 82.) Instead, it should \nhave used the number of abortions that these doctors could theoretically provide while working \n“at a considerably higher rate” and at a “higher capacity.” (Doc. 229-1 at 8.) Next, the \n6 of 30 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 234    02/16/16   Page 7 of 30\ndenominator should not have been the total number of abortions provided in Louisiana. (See \nDoc. 216 ¶¶ 308, 311, at 82.) Rather, the number of abortions provided to non-Louisiana women \nin every Plaintiff clinic should have been subtracted. (Doc. 229-1 at 8.) Such a subtraction, she \nargues, would have necessarily led to a “significantly lower” denominator. (Id.) As to Method 2, \nDefendant contends it exhibits one defect. In Defendant’s words, “[t]he numerator should have \nbeen the number of Louisiana women required to travel significantly farther to reach a qualified \nprovider,” (Id. at 7), not the number of women of reproductive age, (See Doc. 216 ¶ 311, at 82). \nIn sum, Defendant concludes that reversal is likely “because the Court’s analyses used incorrect \nnumbers that significantly inflated the percentages of Louisiana women allegedly denied \nabortion access.” (Doc. 229-1 at 8.)  \nMoving beyond the large fraction test, Defendant adds that she is likely to prevail due to \nthis Court’s incorrect application of administrative law’s pendent principle. In her words, this \nCourt “legally erred in disregarding the Secretary’s determination that Doe 2 had qualifying \nprivileges at Tulane” and “exceeded its jurisdiction” by doing so. (Id. at 9.) In support of this \nsecond “likely” ground, Defendant makes three points.  \nFirst, because the Secretary determined that one doctor, Doe 2, could continue legally \nproviding abortions” at one of the three party clinics, this Court overstepped its rightful bounds. \n(Id.) Thus, even as she denies the applicability of this body of law’s seminal case, Chevron \nU.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Defense Council, 467 U.S. 837, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 \n(1984), describing any “Chevron analysis”5 as “inappropriate,” (Doc. 229-1 at 9, 10), she \nmaintains that her interpretive decision “should have settled the question of the Act’s impact on \n                                                      \n5 The Supporting Memorandum leaves it unclear whether this phrase is being used as a shorthand \nfor all forms of agency deference, a fact noted by this Court in the Ruling. (See Doc. 216 ¶ 236, \nat 64.) \n7 of 30 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 234    02/16/16   Page 8 of 30\nDoe 2’s ability to continue providing abortions.” (Id. at 9–10.) In other words, the law’s \n“indisputable” practical effect resolved any constitutional issues, for the then-Secretary, “the \nstate official charged with enforcing the Act, made a sworn declaration that Doe 2’s privileges \nwere satisfactory and allowed him to continue providing abortions at Causeway.” (Id. at 9 \n(referring to JX 191 ¶ 6).)  Even while this decision merited deference as the official charged \nwith enforcing Act 620, then, this case did not present the classic scenario suitable for the \napplication of a “Chevron-type analysis”: “[A]ggrieved plaintiffs challeng[ing] an agency’s \ninterpretation of a law as exceeding the agency’s statutory authority.” (Id. at 9 & n.2 (citing to \nUtil. Air Regulatory Grp. v. EPA, 134 S. Ct. 2427, 2439, 189 L. Ed. 2d 372 (2014), and Women’s \n& Children’s Hosp. v. State, 2007-1157 (La. App. 1 Cir. 02/08/09); 984 So. 2d 760, 762, 766).)  \nSecond, Defendant contends that this Court should have still accepted her interpretation \nof the law as incontestable and unreviewable, her interpretive declaration obviating this Court’s \nauthority to review Act 620’s constitutionality. This is so, Defendant argues, because “[a] federal \ncourt lacks independent authority to interpret state law or to bind state officials to its \ninterpretation of state law.” (Id. at 10 (quoting Pennhurst v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 106, 104 S. \nCt. 900, 911, 79 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1984)), 10 n.3 (citing for support Earles v. State Bd. of Certified \nPub. Accountants of La., 139 F.3d 1033, 1039 (5th Cir. 1998)); Saahir v. Estelle, 47 F.3d 758, \n761 (5th Cir. 1995); and Hughes v. Savell, 902 F.2d 376, 378 & n.2 (5th Cir. 1990)). \nConcededly, “a federal court has limited authority to interpret state law in a diversity case,” but, \n“[i]n a federal question case like this one, . . . a federal court has no authority to tell a state \nofficial how to interpret state law, even if the court would reach a different conclusion on its \nown.” (Id. (citing to Lelsz v. Kavanaugh, 807 F.2d 1243, 1252 (5th Cir. 1987)).) By not \naccepting the Secretary’s interpretation of Act 620 in preliminarily adjudicating its apparent \n8 of 30 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 234    02/16/16   Page 9 of 30\nunconstitutionality, Defendant contends that this Court therefore defied the rule set forth in \nPennhurst.  \nThird, Defendant argues that this Court lacked any jurisdiction because Doe 2 himself has \nno standing to challenge the Secretary’s application of Act 620 and even benefitted from her then \nchosen construction. (Id. at 10–11.) Doe 2 “merely speculated that a future Secretary might \nchange her mind. . . . [, b]ut plaintiffs lack standing to challenge unknowable future applications \nof a law.” (Id. at 11 (citing to Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 133 S. Ct. 1138, 1147, 185 L. Ed. \n2d 264 (2013)). Like Doe 2, she argues, this Court “lacked jurisdiction to enjoin the Act based on \nspeculation about how future Secretaries might apply it [to Doe 2 as well as other doctors]—\nespecially on a facial challenge.” (Id. at 10–11.) To summarize, the Court’s alleged error was not \nto “accept[] as fact the Secretary’s approval of Doe 2’s . . . privileges” as consistent with Act \n620’s mandate or treat her construction of a plain law, as encapsulated in a single declaration, \n(Id. at 9), as that statute’s singularly binding and conclusive reading. (Id. at 11.) \nThereupon, Defendant contends that the other three factors required for a stay pending \nappeal, when set against this professed likelihood, militate in her favor. As to the second—\nwhether she will be irreparably harmed—she insists no reasonable doubt about this possibility \ncan be raised, as “[w]hen a statute is enjoined, the State necessarily suffers the irreparable harm \nof denying the public interest in the enforcement of its laws.” (Id. at 12 (citing Abbott I, 734 F.3d \nat 419).) As to the fourth—the public’s interest—Louisiana’s “interest and harm” has “merge[d] \nwith that of the public,” by implication rendering any other public concern irrelevant. (Id. \n(quoting Abbott I, 734 F.3d at 419).) She explicitly discounts the pertinence of the third factor—\n9 of 30 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 234    02/16/16   Page 10 of 30\n“whether the issuance of a stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the \nproceeding”—based on her perceived likelihood of appellate success.6 (Id.) \n \n2.  Plaintiffs’ Opposition \nFiled on February 12, 2016, pursuant to this Court’s order, (Doc. 231), the Opposition \ncounters Defendant’s every point with Plaintiffs’ own ten reasons for why a stay must not be \nallowed, “[n]one of the relevant factors, nor consideration of equity, weigh[ing] in favor of a \nstay.” (Doc. 232 at 2.)  \nThe first five deal with the validity of this Court’s large-fraction analyses. First, Plaintiffs \nargue that, since “this Court need[ed] only find that the challenged statute imposes an undue \nburden on the women whom Plaintiff serves,” the large fraction test “need not even be met in \norder for the Fifth Circuit to affirm this Court’s injunctive relief.” (Id. at 3.) For this reason, \nDefendant’s attack, (Doc. 229-1 at 6–8), on this Court’s two mathematical computations, (See \nDoc. 216 ¶¶ 305–15, at 81–83), “misses the mark.”  (Doc. 232 at 2.) Second, regardless of the \nforegoing, Plaintiffs contend that this Court properly applied the large fraction test. While \nDefendant “argues that the ‘large fraction’ test requires an analysis of distance traveled by \nwomen to reach an abortion provider,” (Id. at 3 (construing Doc. 229-1 at 6)), she has \n“mistaken[ly]” construed this test, since “a substantial obstacle in the undue burden analysis can \ntake different forms.” (Id. at 3.) Rather, Casey “had nothing to do with driving distances.” (Id. at \n                                                      \n6 The Supporting Memorandum’s final substantive paragraph states the reasons for the Motion \nfor Stay’s expedited consideration. (Doc. 229-1 at 12.) Though this order was not issued by \nFriday, February 12, 2016, as requested, it was issued on the first business day thereafter so as to \nallow Plaintiffs to respond in the interest of fairness and justice. Cf. FED. R. CIV. P. 1. \nRegardless, the reasons summarized therein have no bearing on the Motion for Stay’s substantive \nmerits, as analyzed in this order. See infra Part III.B.  \n10 of 30 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 234    02/16/16   Page 11 of 30\n3–4 (construing Casey, 505 U.S. at 887–95).) As the Fifth Circuit has recognized, “Casey \ncounsels against striking down a statute solely because women may have to travel long distances \nto obtain abortions,” (Id. at 4 (emphasis added) (quoting Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 598).)   \nThird, Plaintiffs characterize “Defendant’s assertion that a ‘large fraction’ of women who \nseek abortions from Louisiana” will not be impacted when one doctor, rather than six, can \nlegally provide such operations as “def[ying] common sense.” (Id. at 4–5.) Fourth, the Court’s \ncalculations (and related findings) “were supported by substantial record evidence.” (Id. at 5.) \nFifth, Plaintiffs address Defendant’s argument that this Court should have excluded non-\nLouisiana women from its calculations by stressing Casey’s focus on “women for whom the law \nis a restriction, not women of a particular state for whom the law is a restriction.” (Id. (emphasis \nin original)) Casey did not even “mention[] the residency of the women affected by the \nchallenged requirements.” (Id. (construing Casey, 505 U.S. at 894).) Thus, because “Act 620 \nrestricts the rights of all Americans seeking an abortion in the state of Louisiana” and because \nthe large fraction test “contains no residency test,” Defendant’s reading lacks any legal support. \n(Id.) As further support for this proposition, Plaintiffs note that the Constitution forbids a state \nfrom infringing on the fundamental rights of out-of-state residents. (Id. (citing U.S. CONST. art. \nIV, § 2, and Corfield v. Coryell, 6 F. Cas. 546, (C.C. E.D. Pa. 1823)).) Defendant has essentially \nasked this Court to treat such women as “having no weight” for ascertaining the constitutionality \nof a restriction on a fundamental right, (Id.), though “[a] law that deprives out-of-state women of \ntheir constitutional rights is flatly unconstitutional,” (Id. (citing Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179, \n200, 93 S. Ct. 739, 751–52, 35 L. Ed. 2d 201 (1973)).)  \nThe next two reasons concern Defendant’s second argued ground for reversal. While \nDefendant insists that this Court should have given “due deference” to the Secretary’s “opinion,” \n11 of 30 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 234    02/16/16   Page 12 of 30\nwhich would have in turn diminished its large fractions, Plaintiffs first recount the nature of this \nopinion. (Id. at 6.) The declaration came only “one business day before the [relevant] evidentiary \nhearing,” and the Secretary later testified that she had “limited knowledge and understanding of \nthe hospital admitting privileges process, including what type of hospital admitting privileges \nmeet Act 620’s requirements.” (Id. (referencing Doc. 191 at 202–07).) In fact, argue Plaintiffs, \nDefendant’s own expert contradicted her construction. (Id. at 7.) Second, pursuant to well-\nestablished principles of administrative law and statutory interpretation,7 this Court was bound to \nconstrue Act 620 according to “its plain meaning” and, if it found the law to be both plain and \nunambiguous, this alone determines its constitutionality. (Id.) Because the Court did so, Plaintiffs \nmaintain that precedent did not compel this Court to “uncritically defer to Secretary Kliebert’s \nflawed interpretation of the law” or to disregard its terms “solely on the basis of . . . [her] \nassertions.” (Id.) For these two reasons, the perception that this Court exceeded its jurisdiction is \n“frivolous.” (Id. at 8.)  \nPlaintiffs’ last three arguments focus on the remaining three elements for a stay’s issue,8 \nPlaintiffs holding that “Defendant cannot establish that any of these factors weigh in her favor.” \n(Id. (emphasis in original).) Frist, Defendant has not hinted at any “damage” that would follow \nfrom the injunction’s imposition.9 (Id. at 9 (citing to Doc. 216 ¶ 408, at 110).) Second, regardless \nof the harm to Defendant effected by the Ruling, a stay of the injunction would harm numerous \n                                                      \n7 These principles are discussed below, see infra Part III.B.2, as well as in the Ruling, (Doc. 216 \n¶¶ 235–49, at 64–69).   \n8 Plaintiffs also disparage Defendant’s attempt to address these issues in “two desultory \nsentences.” (Doc. 232 at 8.) \n9 This statement is somewhat inaccurate. While Defendant did not prove any type of damages at \ntrial, she does now maintain that she will suffer a form of irreparable harm. (Doc. 229-1 at 12.) \nWhether that form of harm outweighs others’ injuries or the totality of the public interest is an \nentirely separate question. See infra Part III.B.2–5. \n12 of 30 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 234    02/16/16   Page 13 of 30\nparties and persons, including the Plaintiffs, their physicians, and their patients. (Id. (citing to \nDoc. 216 ¶¶ 403–06, at 109–10).) Third, even as Defendant states that the public interest has \nmerged with the Secretary’s own and “offers a circular complaint,” “the public interest is best \nserved by not enforcing an unconstitutional state law.” (Id. (emphasis added) (citing to Doc. 216 \n¶ 409, at 111).)  \nAs Plaintiffs ultimately conclude, with only compelling circumstances sufficient to \nsupport a stay, Defendant’s purported failure to make a “strong showing that she is likely to \nsucceed on the merits” and “to meaningfully address the remaining factors” compels denial of \nthe Motion for Stay. (Id. at 9–10.)  \n \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nA.  GOVERNING STANDARD \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 8(a)(1)(A), “[a] party must ordinarily \nmove first in the district court for . . . a stay of the judgment or order of a district court pending \nappeal.” FED. R. APP. P. 8(a)(1)(A); Rivera-Torres v. Ortiz Velez, 341 F.3d 86, 95 (1st Cir. \n2003). The district court must thereupon consider four factors in deciding whether to grant such a \nstay: “(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on \nthe merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether \nissuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) \nwhere the public interest lies.” Abbott I, 734 F.3d at 410 & n.9 (relying on, among others, Nken \nv. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 425–26, 129 S. Ct. 1749, 1756, 173 L. Ed. 2d 550 (2009)); see also, \ne.g., Wilde v. Huntington Ingalls, Inc., 616 F. App’x 710, 712 (5th Cir. 2015) (quoting id.); \nWoodfox v. Cain, 789 F.3d 565, 568–69 (5th Cir. 2015) (same). The movant bears the burden of \n13 of 30 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 234    02/16/16   Page 14 of 30\nshowing each and every circumstance, and a stay “is not a matter of right, even if irreparable \ninjury might otherwise result to the appellant.” Nken, 556 U.S. at 433–34; see also, e.g., Lair v. \nBullock, 697 F.3d 1200, 1203 (9th Cir. 2012) (citing id.). Although a particularly strong \nlikelihood of success may negate the need to prove extensive harm, “an adequate showing” as to \nall factors must still be made. Abbott I, 734 F.3d at 419; cf.  Golden Gate Rest. Ass’n v. City & \nCnty. of San Francisco, 512 F.3d 1112, 1119 (9th Cir. 2008) (“[T]he standard for granting a stay \nis a continuum.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). \nLike the injunctive remedy that it so resembles, a stay is “always an extraordinary \nremedy.” Bhd. of Ry. & S.S. Clerks, etc. v. Nat’l Mediation Bd., 374 F.2d 269, 275 (D.C. Cir. \n1966); accord, e.g., Nabers v. Morgan, No. 3:09-cv-00070-CWR-FKB, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n28408, at *3, 2011 WL 830217, at *3 (S.D. Miss. Mar. 4, 2011) (quoting id.). The burden upon \nthe movant is accordingly a heavy one. United States v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., 449 F. Supp. 2d \n988, 990 (D.D.C. 2006); see also, e.g., Phoenix Global Ventures, LLC v. Phoenix Hotel Assocs., \nLtd., No. 04 Civ. 4991 (RJH), 2004 U.S. Dist.

In the course of this analysis, imperfectly and roughly, equities \nmust be balanced. See, e.g., Winter v. NRDC, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 23, 129 S. Ct. 365, 376, 172 L. \nEd. 2d 249 (2008) (“Even if plaintiffs have shown irreparable injury . . . , any such injury is \noutweighed by the public interest and the [balance of the equities].”); Cuomo v. U.S. Nuclear \nRegulatory Comm’n, 772 F.2d 972, 978 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (denying motion for stay when “the \npetitioners . . . failed to establish that they have a substantial case on the merits, and . . . further \nfailed to demonstrate that the balance of equities or the public interest strongly favors the \ngranting of a stay”).   \n14 of 30 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 234    02/16/16   Page 15 of 30\nB.  APPLICATION \n1.  Likely Success on the Merits  \n(a)  Likelihood of Reversal for Failure to Apply Defendant’s Version of the Undue Burden \nTest \nFor Defendant to merit a stay on this first ground, she must prove that the Court’s \napplication of the standard set forth in Roe, Casey, and their Fifth Circuit descendants was in \nerror. Under that precedent, the ultimate question for the Court was whether a likely effect of Act \n620 is to place an undue burden or substantial obstacle in the path of women’s right to an \nabortion. As noted above, see infra Part II.B.1, Defendant reduces the relevant test to a single \nformulation: “the Fifth Circuit determines the fraction of women burdened by an admitting \nprivileges law by (1) taking the number of women who must travel significantly farther to reach \na qualified provider, and (2) dividing by all women of reproductive age in the state.” (Doc. 229-1 \nat 6 (citing to Abbott I, 734 F.3d at 415).) Her entire brief as to the probability of success on this \nfirst ground depends upon the incontestable soundness of this particular construction.  \nWhen Roe, Casey, Abbott I, Abbott II, and other recent cases are examined in toto, \nhowever, one conclusion follows: Defendant has read too narrowly the Fifth Circuit’s test for \ndetermining whether the burden is “undue” or the obstacle “substantial” by arguing that the sole \nmethod for determining undue burden or substantial obstacle rests on the distance a woman must \ntravel to reach a qualified provider. (Doc. 229-1 at 6.)  While it is true that the Fifth Circuit’s \nrecent jurisprudence considered distance travelled as a factor, see, e.g., Abbott I, 734 F.3d at 415; \nAbbott II, 748 F.3d at 597–98, these cases do not hold or suggest that this is the only way that \nundue burden can be measured, see, e.g., Currier, 760 F.3d at 457–58 (holding that where the \neffect of the law is to remove all access to abortions within a state, the law is unconstitutional). \n15 of 30 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 234    02/16/16   Page 16 of 30\nInstead, since Casey, whether an undue burden exists has always been more than just a question \nof miles traveled. See, e.g., Casey, 505 U.S. at 878 (“Unnecessary health regulations that have \nthe purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion impose \nan undue burden on the right.”). The full panoply of “effects within the regulating state” must be \nconsidered; distance is only one salient factor. See Currier, 760 F.3d at 457, 458.  \n  Here, the critical issue is not distance but availability and access. In this case, the \nevidence showed that the effect of implementing Act 620’s admitting privileges requirement \nwould be to eliminate altogether the ability at least four of Louisiana’s six abortion providers to \nperform abortions in Louisiana. (Doc. 216 ¶¶ 305–21, at 405–06.)10 Of the two remaining \ndoctors able to perform abortions, one would be unable to do so at one of the two facilities where \nhe now performs abortions. (Id.)  \nFurther, no fewer than three of Louisiana’s five abortion facilities would be left without \nany provider and therefore would likely close. (Id.)11 This would leave, at most, two facilities \nwith half their normal staff of physicians to serve the entire state which, the evidence showed, \ncould not be done. (Id.) This would result, regardless of the distances to be travelled, in a large \nfraction of women being unable to get an appointment at a Louisiana abortion facility at all. This \nwould cause significant and potentially dangerous delays for women seeking an abortion which, \nin turn, would cause an increased health risk for the patient. (Id.) It would also result in an \n                                                      \n10 In its Ruling, the Court found as a matter of fact that Act 620 would cause the loss of five of \nLouisiana’s six abortion physicians. (Doc 216 ¶¶ 298–302 at 78–80, ¶ 305 at 81.) However, \nbecause the reasons given by Dr. Doe 3 for discontinuing his abortion practice cannot be \nconsidered under Fifth Circuit precedent, Doe 3’s likely departure from abortion practice was not \nconsidered. (Id. ¶ 363, at 98.) \n11 If Doe 3’s likely departure could be considered, four of five of Louisiana’s six abortion \nfacilities would close. (Doc. 216 ¶¶ 305–21, at 81–85.) However, for reasons stated above, it was \nnot. \n16 of 30 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 234    02/16/16   Page 17 of 30\nincreased risk of self-performed, unlicensed and unsafe abortions. (Id.) These are but some of the \ndeleterious effects likely to flow from Act 620’s enforcement, all of which must be borne in \nmind pursuant to Casey’s clear terms.  \n  In sum, the Court rejects Defendant’s suggestion that distance travelled is the sole criteria \nfor gauging undue burden. Regardless of the issue of travel distance, Act 620’s admitting \nprivileges requirement would place a substantial obstacle in the path of a large fraction of \nwomen seeking an abortion in Louisiana. Casey itself, as Plaintiffs persuasively stress, (See Doc. \n232 at 5), did not make distance the sole lodestar for measuring an undue burden; even in \nhighlighting the usefulness of distance in this limited regard, neither has the Fifth Circuit. As \nsuch, Defendant’s first argument seems unlikely to prevail on appeal.  \n \n(b)  Viability of Defendant’s Proposed Numerator and Denominators  \nWithout citing to a single case so holding, (See Doc. 229-1 at 7–8), Defendant next \nargues that comparing the number of women no longer able to get an abortion in Louisiana \n(because of the probable loss of two thirds of the abortion physicians in Louisiana) to either the \nnumber of women seeking abortions in Louisiana or the number of women of reproductive age is \nnot an “analysis prescribed by circuit law.” (Id. at 7.) As this Court explained in the Ruling, (Doc \n216 ¶¶ 35–58), in determining whether a law has caused a substantial obstacle to be placed in the \npath of a large fraction of women seeking an abortion, the Fifth Circuit’s “binding precedent” \nrequires that the number of women of reproductive age be used as the denominator. Cole, 790 \nF.3d at 589 (citing Abbott I, 734 F.3d at 414; Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 598; and Lakey, 769 F.3d at \n299). But, because there is some suggestion that the denominator can consist only of women \n17 of 30 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 234    02/16/16   Page 18 of 30\n“seek[ing] an abortion,” Cole, 790 F.3d at 589 (quoting Lakey, 769 F.3d at 299), this Court used \nboth numbers, the results equally unconstitutional. \n  Defendant begins with criticism of the numerator used by the Court: the number of \npatients who would no longer have ready access to an abortion because of the severely reduced \nnumber of available physicians and clinics. (Doc. 229-1 at 7–8). This number was calculated by \nsubtracting the number of women being treated by doctors who would no longer be able to \nprovide abortions because of Act 620, from the number of women who seek abortions in \nLouisiana annually. Alternatively, the Court subtracted that number of women from the total \nnumber of women of reproductive age in Louisiana.  \nThe first basis for Defendant’s attack is factual: Defendant’s contention that “undisputed \ntestimony” shows that the two doctors unaffected by Act 620, Doctors John Doe 3 (“Doe 3”) and \nJohn Doe 5 (“Doe 5”), could have performed more abortions than they were actually performing. \n(Id. at 8.) This, argues Defendant, “significantly inflate[s]” the percentage of women denied \naccess to abortion. (Id. at 7.) The Court is unpersuaded by this argument.  \n  The source for the Court’s finding that Doe 5 performed  2,950 abortions in 2013, (Doc. \n216 ¶ 308, at 82), was Doe 3’s Declaration, (JX 110 ¶ 7), in which he stated that he performed \napproximately 2,000 abortions at Delta Clinic and 950 abortions at Woman’s Clinic. (JX 110 ¶ \n7). The testimony cited by Defendant is not inconsistent with this conclusion. Doe 5 testified \nthat, “in a typical week” he performed between 40 to 60 surgical abortions and 20 to 30 chemical \nabortions. (Doc 168-6 at 8.) At another point of his testimony, he lowered his estimate to 40 to \n60 procedures per week “on average.” (Id. at 15.) Given the fact that it is likely that Doe 3 is not \nperforming abortions 52 weeks per year, the estimated ranges given in his deposition are \nconsistent with the yearly estimate given in his Declaration. The Court carefully weighed the \n18 of 30 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 234    02/16/16   Page 19 of 30\nevidence on this point and concludes that this number used in the Court’s calculation is well \nsupported in the record.  \n  Doe 3 has an active general obstetrical practice in addition to his abortion practice. (Doc. \n216 ¶ 56, at 22.) In his abortion practice, he testified that he sees approximately 20-30 abortion \npatients per week. This testimony was the basis for the Court’s conclusion that, (assuming a 50 \nweek work year), Doe 3 was seeing approximately 1,000 to 1,500 patients per year (Id. ¶ 58, at \n22.) Defendant points to Doe 3’s testimony that “there have been occasions at Hope when you’ve \nprovided between 40 and 50 abortions in one day [],” (Doc. 190 at 155), to argue that the Court’s \nconclusion was in error. However, to base Doe 3’s yearly abortion rate on an aberrational single \nday number, as Defendant suggests, would fly in the face of the weight of the evidence, \ncontravene both common sense and reality, and unrealistically deflate the number of women \ndenied access to abortion. It is the Court’s duty to predict the realistic effect of Act 620 on the \nright of women to obtain an abortion in Louisiana. It is not for the Court (or for the Defendant) to \npresume that a party will choose to make the exceptional into the typical or to somehow force a \nperson to abandon their every other professional effort just so as to manufacture a better number. \nRather than indulging in speculation, the Court carefully weighed the evidence on this point and \nconcludes that its calculation is well supported by the record.  \nDefendant thereafter contends that the Court erred in its alternative use of the total \nnumber of abortions performed in Louisiana in calculating the numerator because this population \nincludes some patients from outside Louisiana. (Doc. 229-1 at 8.) Defendant points to evidence \nthat non-Louisiana residents make up 31% of the patient population at one of the six clinics, \n(Hope in Shreveport). (Doc. 216 ¶ 31, at 18.) The cogency of this ground is undermined by three \nfacts. \n19 of 30 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 234    02/16/16   Page 20 of 30\nThe first two are evidentiary. First, Defendant herself provided no additional evidence as \nto what percentage, if any, the other clinics’ patients are from out of state, her present argument \npredicated on extrapolation. Relatedly, unless Louisiana somehow intends to bar its borders to \nout-of-state residents, Hope’s capacity (and that of the other clinics) will remain practically \ncircumscribed by its (and their) total number of patients, whether they come from within or \nwithout this state. Certainly, neither logic nor law compel this Court to pretend that such visits \nboth do not happen and do not affect the ability of the clinics to provide abortion services to \nwomen in Louisiana as well as the women of Louisiana. Cf. Cole, 790 F.3d at 597–98 \n(describing it as “wholly inequitable to ignore . . . reality”). Second, even if one were to remove \nnon-residents from the large fraction analysis, the percentage of Louisiana women denied access \nto an abortion remains the same, roughly 55%.12 Mathematically, a fraction greater than 50% is \nstill a large one. \nThird (and more importantly), Defendant provides no legal support for her contention \nthat non-residents must be excluded in the large fraction analysis, Casey holding to the contrary. \nAs the Supreme Court there observed, “[l]egislation is measured for consistency with the \n                                                      \n12 For this analysis, the Court accepts Defendant’s premise that 31% of the total annual patient \npopulation for all abortion facilities were nonresidents. This means that 69% of the total annual \npatient population for all abortion facilities were Louisiana residents. The total annual patient \npopulation for all abortion facilities was 9,976. 69% of this number is 6,883. The total number of \nwomen obtaining an abortion by Does 3 and 5 after Act 620 is enacted is 4,500. Critically, the \nsame 31/69% ratio must be applied again at this point; this is critical because Louisiana women \nwould have to compete with non-residents for the limited number of available abortion \nphysicians, and access would likely be in the same proportion as with the total patient \npopulation. This means that 69% percent of women obtaining an abortion after Act 620 is \nimplemented are Louisiana residents, and this total (69% of 4,500) is 3,105. Thus, the total \nnumber of women denied access to abortions after Act 620 - that is, 3,105 (total number of \nLouisiana women obtaining abortions after the Act) divided by 6,883 (total number of Louisiana \nwomen obtaining abortions before the Act) - is about 55%. 55% is, by any reasonable measure, a \nlarge fraction. \n20 of 30 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 234    02/16/16   Page 21 of 30\nConstitution by its impact on those whose conduct if affects”; as it explicitly stated, “[t]he proper \nfocus of constitutional inquiry is the group for whom the law is a restriction.” Casey, 505 U.S. at \n894. Similarly telling language appears in Lakey. See Lakey, 769 F.3d at 299 (emphasizing that \nthe appropriate denominator includes “includes all women affected by these limited options,” as \nthe relevant requirement “applie[d] to every abortion clinic in the State, limiting the options for \nall women in Texas who seek an abortion” (emphases added)). Not to be understated, this \nunderstanding of the inviolability of a constitutional right can be partly justified by the \nConstitution’s Privileges and Immunities Clause. U.S. CONST. art. IV, § 2, cl. 1; see, e.g., Sup. \nCt. of N.H. v. Piper, 470 U.S. 274, 281 n.11, 105 S. Ct. 1272, 1277, 84 L. Ed. 2d 205 (1985) \n(“The Court has never held that the Privileges and Immunities Clause protects only economic \ninterests.” (citing Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179 (1973) (concluding that a Georgia statute \npermitting only residents to secure abortions violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause))); \nBach v. Pataki, 408 F.3d 75, 90 (2d Cir. 2005) (“The Supreme Court has never held that the \nPrivileges and Immunities Clause protects only economic interests.” (internal quotation marks \nomitted)). In fact, Cole itself cited to Doe, 790 F.3d at 569 n.5, in which the Supreme Court \nforbade a state from restricting the abortion access of out-of-state residents on the basis of this \nclause, Doe, 410 U.S. at 200.  \nFor these reasons, this Court does not find that Defendant has made the strong showing of \nlikely success on the merits as to this issue required for a stay to be granted. \n \n(c)  Likelihood of Reversal on Basis of Non-deference  \nLastly, this Court finds that Defendant’s administrative law argument is not a likely \nground for reversal. In Defendant’s view, the fact that she has once declared her intent to \n21 of 30 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 234    02/16/16   Page 22 of 30\ninterpret Act 620 in a way that minimizes its effects upon Doe 2 “settle[s] the question of the \nAct’s impact,” her authority to enforce the law affording her discretion to do so, and has \ndeprived this Court of the power to deem the law as written to be unconstitutional. (Doc. 229-1 \nat 9–10.) To do otherwise, Defendant argues, is to impermissibly “bind state officials to . . . [a \nfederal court’s] interpretation of state law.” (Id. at 10.)  \nDefendant’s first point, however, cannot be squared with the binding principle that \n“[a]gencies exercise discretion only in the interstices created by statutory silence or ambiguity.” \nUtil. Air Regulatory Grp., 134 S. Ct. at 2442; see also, e.g., Sexton v. Panel Processing, Inc., 754 \nF.3d 332, 336 (6th Cir. 2014) (rejecting an agency interpretation as contrary to the statutory \nlanguage as interpreted). As this Court stressed in the Ruling, “no deference is owed to an \nopinion contrary to . . . [a] law’s unambiguous and plain meaning.” (Doc. 216 ¶ 236, at 64.) \nUnder both Louisiana and federal law, deference is hence only given when the statute is truly \n“ambiguous” regarding the precise “question at issue” and if the agency’s interpretation is a \n“reasonable” and hence “permissible construction of the statute” at hand. (Id. ¶¶ 237–38, at 65–\n66.) In other words, if the law’s certain meaning can be discerned via the standard array of \ninterpretive tools, Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 341, 117 S. Ct. 843, 846, 136 L. Ed. \n2d 808 (1997), an administrative actor cannot imbue its text with any other meaning by \nexercising its supposed discretionary prerogative, see, e.g., Doctors Hosp. of Augusta v. Dep’t of \nHealth & Hosps., 2013 1762 (La. App. 1 Cir. 09/17/14); 2014 La. App. Unpub. LEXIS 481, at \n*19–20, 2014 WL 4658202, at *7. Despite the rise of the administrative state, then, what was \nsaid in 1803 remains equally true today: “It is the province and duty of the judicial department to \nsay what the law is,” Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 177, 2 L. Ed. 60 (1803), an agency \naccorded deference solely when a law’s plain and unambiguous import is not susceptible to \n22 of 30 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 234    02/16/16   Page 23 of 30\ndefinite derivation, see Salazar-Regino v. Rominski, 415 F.3d 436, 448 (5th Cir. 2005) (citing \nthis maxim in the context of weighing the reasonableness of an agency’s particular \ninterpretation). Plainly and unambiguously, Act 620 does not recognize Doe 2’s privileges as \nsufficient. Notwithstanding the Secretary’s assessment, that plain meaning must control when a \ncourt must classify a physician’s so-called “admitting privileges” for its purposes, a fact that \ndepletes Defendant’s second ground of its essential likelihood.  \nDefendant’s second claim, meanwhile, misconstrues the modest effect of the Ruling and \nJudgment. In deeming the Secretary’s interpretation unpersuasive due to its inconsistency with \nthe Act’s express text, her own expert’s statements, and her less than clear testimony, this Court \ndid not order her to conform to its own view of state law, as Pennhurst and its progeny forbid, \nsee, e.g., Pennhurst, 465 U.S. 89. Whether she would or would not act as the statute plainly \ncommands was not relevant to whether Act 620, as written and enacted, imposed an undue \nburden upon the exercise of a recognizable constitutional right. As such, this Court did not order \nthe Secretary to adhere to a particular state law or enforce its own construction of that statute. \nSubject to a later trial, it preliminarily held the admitting privileges requirement to be \nunconstitutional. The result of such a determination—that the Secretary cannot enforce an \nunconstitutional state law—does not mean she was ordered to enforce it in accordance with this \nCourt’s own terms, as no enforcement was actually demanded.  \nIn addition, Defendant has misread Pennhurst. In this seminal case, the Supreme Court \nheld that the Eleventh Amendment bars federal injunctive relief against a state official if (1) “the \njudgment sought would expend itself on the public treasury or domain, or interfere with the \npublic administration, or if the effect of the judgment would be to restrain the Government from \nacting, or to compel it to act,” and (2) “if the conduct to be restrained is within the scope of \n23 of 30 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 234    02/16/16   Page 24 of 30\nauthority delegated to the official by state law.” Pennhurst, 465 U.S. at 101 n.11, 102 (internal \nquotation marks omitted). Thus, in other circumstances, federal jurisdiction over a claim based \non the existence of a federal question is not barred under Pennhurst even when “the resolution of \n. . . constitutional issues . . . requires this court to ascertain what state law means.” Coalition of \nN.J. Sportsmen, Inc. v. Whitman, 44 F. Supp. 2d 666, 673 (D.N.J. 1999). For this very reason, in \nsoundly rejecting an argument akin to Defendant’s own, the Third Circuit has observed—“The \nascertainment of state law is an everyday function of the federal court”—and clarified: \n“[A]scertaining state law is a far cry from compelling state officials to comply with it.” Everett v. \nSchramm, 772 F.2d 1114, 1119 (3d Cir. 1985); cf., e.g., Okpalobi v. Foster, 190 F.3d 337, 349 \n(5th Cir. 1999) (“We are convinced that Article III does not require a plaintiff to plead or prove \nthat a defendant state official has enforced or threatened to enforce a[n abortion-related] statute \nin order to meet the case or  controversy requirement when that statute is immediately and \ncoercively self-enforcing.”), superseded on other grounds, 244 F.3d 405 (5th Cir. 2001). No less \nand no more was done by this Court in the Ruling when it rejected Kliebert’s construal, \nembodied in a single declaration lacking in the formal trappings of the most considered agency \ninterpretations.   \nThree more observations are in order. First, even as she makes a plea for deference based \non her role as Secretary of DHH, Defendant simultaneously demands to be released from the \nobligations to earn such deference. As emphasized above, as a matter of state and federal law, \nsuch deference can only come when the law in question has a meaning neither plain nor \nunambiguous. (See also Doc. 216 ¶ 236, at 64 (collecting the relevant cases).) The Secretary, \nhowever, has insisted upon such deference without meeting a single predicate; more colloquially \nput, she wishes to have her cake and eat it too. Second, no exercise of discretion can suddenly \n24 of 30 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 234    02/16/16   Page 25 of 30\ntransform an unconstitutional law into a constitutional stricture, and no administrative agent can \ninsulate a plain law from constitutional scrutiny by demanding that a court forsake its duty under \nArticle III. Cf., e.g., Int’l Soc’y for Krishna Consciousness v. Eaves, 601 F.2d 809, 818 (5th Cir. \n1979) (noting that “there is clear Supreme Court authority that the probability of enforcement is \nnot relevant to a court'’ jurisdiction over an anticipatory challenge” to a statute). Due to this \nreason, the extent to which the Secretary’s interpretation benefitted Doe 2 is irrelevant, as is his \npossible lack of standing to sue her. Regardless of her opinion, his privileges still do not satisfy \nthe law as naturally construed, and as this Court is bound to apply the law’s plain and \nunambiguous meaning, the beneficent effects of her construction cannot justify disregarding Act \n620’s language. Just as surely, the questionable claim that Doe 2 may lack standing to sue the \nSecretary13 does not mean he was not impacted by Act 620’s passage or enforcement,14 and the \nfact that Kliebert’s successor could change her mind about how to enforce the law does not \ndeprive this Court of the power to declare it unconstitutional. Cf., e.g., Virginia v. Am. \n                                                      \n13 “[W]here the plaintiff faces a credible threat of enforcement,” standing exists. Consumer Data \nIndus. Ass’n v. King, 678 F.3d 898, 907 (10th Cir. 2012); cf. Babbitt v. UFW Nat’l Union, 442 \nU.S. 289, 298 99 S. Ct. 2301, 2308, 60 L. Ed. 2d 895 (1979) (finding standing where “a realistic \ndanger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of a statute’s operation or enforcement” existed \n(emphasis added)). In these situations, a plaintiff is typically “not . . . required to await and \nundergo [enforcement] as the sole means of seeking relief.” Consumer Data Indus. Ass’n, 678 \nF.3d at 907; see also, e.g., Sindicato Puertorriqueño de Trabajadores v. Fortuño, 699 F.3d 1, 9 \n(1st Cir. 2012) (“[T]he Supreme Court has made clear that when a plaintiff alleges an intention \nto engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest, but proscribed \nby a statute, and there exists a credible threat of prosecution thereunder, he should not be \nrequired to await and undergo a criminal prosecution as the sole means of seeking relief.” \n(internal quotation marks omitted)); R.I. Ass’n of Realtors v. Whitehouse, 199 F.3d 26, 33 (1st \nCir. 2002) (“[T]he Supreme Court repeatedly has found standing to mount pre-enforcement \nchallenges to laws that had never been enforced.”).  \n14 In fact, that possibility strengthens the argument for denying deference to the Secretary’s \ndecision. To wit, if he could not “challenge the Secretary’s application of the Act under \nChevron,” (Doc. 229-1 at 10–11), whatever it is, the legal foundation for her exercise of \ndiscretion should be clearly defined. Otherwise, injury with impunity may follow though both \nLouisiana and federal law bar “arbitrary” and “capricious” administrative action. \n25 of 30 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 234    02/16/16   Page 26 of 30\nBooksellers Ass’n, Inc., 484 U.S. 383, 392-93, 108 S. Ct. 636, 98 L. Ed. 2d 782 (1988) (holding \nthat the injury-in-fact requirement was met, in part, because “plaintiffs have alleged an actual \nand well-founded fear that the law will be enforced against them”); Steffel v. Thompson, 415 \nU.S. 452, 459, 94  S. Ct. 1209, 39 L. Ed. 2d 505 (1974) (“[I]t is not necessary that [a party] first \nexpose himself to actual arrest or prosecution to be entitled to challenge a statute that he claims \ndeters the exercise of his constitutional rights.”). That variability is irrelevant when the plain \nmeaning leaves no other course open. Finally, even as it is still unclear what kind of deference \nthe Secretary would like this Court to give her, her opinion appears in a single declaration \nsubmitted to this Court shortly before a hearing as a tool of litigation.15 (See Doc. 232 at 6.)  \nEven putting aside its dubiousness in light of the Secretary’s subsequent questioning, it simply \ndoes not resemble the kind of formal agency opinions to which the greatest deference is owed. \nSee United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 121 S.Ct. 2164, 150 L. Ed. 2d 292 (2001) \n(explicating the various forms of agency deference). \nWhen controlling principles are applied, it is clear that Act 620, as drafted and signed, \ndoes “pose[]” a “present barrier to Doe 2’s abortion practice in the New Orleans area,” (Doc. \n229-1 at 11), an interpretation consistent with that of Defendant’s own expert, (See, e.g., Doc. \n193 at 94, 123; Doc. 216 ¶¶ 241–42, at 67), and not strongly alleviated by her one declaration. \nWhile well-established law compels this result, binding precedent clinches it: as the Fifth Circuit \nitself has written, “[t]o determine the constitutionality of a state law, we ask whether the Act, \nmeasured by its text in this facial attack, imposes a substantial obstacle to . . . previability[] \nabortions.” Lakey, 769 F.3d at 293 (alteration in original) (emphasis added) (internal quotation \n                                                      \n15 The relevant declaration was submitted on June 19, 2015, (Doc. 154), and her entire opinion is \nembodied in a single paragraph, (Id. ¶ 6, at 3).  \n26 of 30 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 234    02/16/16   Page 27 of 30\nmarks omitted). Hence, upon careful scrutiny, this final purported error thus does not form a \nlikely ground for reversal. \n \n2.  Irreparable Harm to the Appellant  \n  On this issue, the law is clear. “When a statute is enjoined, the State necessarily suffers \nthe irreparable harm of denying the public interest in the enforcement of its laws.” Abbott I, 734 \nF.3d at 419; see also, e.g., Veasey v. Perry, 769 F.3d 890, 895 (5th Cir. 2014). The second \nelement for a stay pending appeal has thus been suitably shown. \n \n3.  Injury to Others  \n  Yet, as the Ruling makes clear, Plaintiffs and other persons will also endure great harm if \nAct 620 is enforced and thus if the Motion for Stay is granted. (Doc. 216 ¶¶ 364–91 at 99–106, \n¶¶ 404–06 at 110.) The plaintiff clinics will face nearly insurmountable hurdles and may find \nthemselves without a doctor able to provide abortions to a single woman, operations so sharply \ncurtailed as to possibly prompt their closure; logically, their medical and administrative staff will \nsuffer derivative yet equally harmful effects. See, e.g., Jackson Women’s Health Org. v. Currier, \n940 F. Supp. 2d 416, 424 (S.D. Miss. 2013), aff’d in part, 760 F.3d 448. Most significantly, the \nwomen of Louisiana will face irreparable harms from the burdens associated with finding an \nabortion clinic with sufficient capacity to perform their abortions; “unreasonable and dangerous \ndelays in scheduling abortion procedures” will likely follow from a decrease in the total number \nof available doctors. (Doc. 216 ¶¶ 404–06 at 110.) Crucially, “the deprivation of [any and all] \nconstitutional rights,” whether arising from the First, Second, or Fourteenth Amendment, has \nalways “constitute[d] irreparable harm as a matter of law.” Cohen v. Coahoma Cnty., Miss., 805 \n27 of 30 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 234    02/16/16   Page 28 of 30\nF. Supp. 398, 406 (N.D. Miss. 1992) (citations omitted); see also, e.g., Deerfield Med. Ctr. v. \nDeerfield Beach, 661 F.2d 328, 338 (5th Cir. 1981). Consequently, as with Act 620, the issuance \nof a stay will likely inflict an array of substantial injuries on the sundry parties interested in this \nproceeding, likely subjecting many to economic and physical injury and thousands of women to \nharm as irreparable as Defendant’s own.16 These are harms to which Defendant has given no \npersuasive response, (See Doc. 232 at 8–9), no “adequate” demonstration of this factor made, \n(See Doc. 229-1 at 12).    \n \n 4.  Public Interest  \nIn addressing the final factor, Defendant maintains that its interest in enforcing Act 620 \n“merge[s] with that of the public.” (Doc. 229-1 at 12 (citing Abbott I, 734 F.3d at 419).) True, \n“[a]ny time a State is enjoined by a court from effectuating statutes enacted by representatives of \nits people, it suffers a form of irreparable injury.” Maryland v. King, 133 S. Ct. 1, 3, 183 L. Ed. \n2d 667 (2012). But the public interest, for purposes of ordering a stay, is never so monolithic. In \ndeclaring its apparent desire, no state entity, whether legislature or governor or both, annuls the \ncountervailing concerns and rights of a state’s every citizen. If so, this final factor will always \nfavor the issuance of a stay when a state law, though found to be likely unconstitutional, is \n                                                      \n16 Thus, the Defendant misapplies Abbott I when she says that “[g]iven the State’s likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits, any showing of harm plaintiffs might make is not enough, standing alone \nto outweigh the other factors.” (Doc. 229-1 at 12 (emphasis added) (citing Abbott I, 734 F.3d at \n419).) First, Defendant has failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits. Further, in \nAbbott I, the Fifth Circuit expressly stated that the appellant had “adequate[ly]” shown every \nother factor, including “whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties \ninterested in the proceeding.” 734 F.3d at 419. The Fifth Circuit did not suggest that a strong \nlikelihood of success, even if found, somehow made “any showing of harm” irrelevant. (Doc. \n229-1 at 12.) It simply stated the “strong harm” shown by a plaintiff was not itself enough \nconsidering defendant’s sufficient showing of every other factor. (Id.) \n28 of 30 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 234    02/16/16   Page 29 of 30\nchallenged, no further analysis ever required. As case law well shows, however, the public \ninterest to be weighed is broader than a state’s asserted claim. Indeed, as the Fifth Circuit has \nnoted, “it is always in the public interest to prevent the violation of a party’s constitutional \nrights,” Currier, 760 F.3d at 458 n.9 (quoting Awad v. Ziriax, 670 F.3d 1111, 1132 (10th Cir. \n2012)), and not too much forbearance is required when the relevant law has never gone into \neffect, cf. R.I. Med. Soc’y v. Whitehouse, 66 F. Supp. 2d 288, 303 (D.R.I. 1999). Thus, two \ndifferent public interests here exist and must be set against each other, the state’s asserted claim \nbut one amidst many equally viable others.  \n \n5.  The Balance \nAs the foregoing shows, the balance of factors clearly calls for the denial of the Motion \nfor Stay. Defendant has failed to make the required strong showing of a likelihood of success on \nthe merits, and thus the first factor favors denial. Per binding precedent, the second factor favors \nDefendant, but the third favors Plaintiffs as the injuries which others will endure with a stay’s \ngranting are likely to be substantial in comparison to Defendant’s lone form of irreparable injury. \nAs to the fourth factor, while there are competing public interests involved, preventing the \nviolation of a constitutional right, in this case, prevails, especially since denying the Motion for \nStay merely maintains the status quo.  \n \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, the overall balance of factors and justice counsels against a \nstay of the Ruling and Judgment. Based on the Supporting Memorandum, Defendant’s \nprobability of success is too low relative to the likely harms that will be inflicted upon Plaintiffs \n29 of 30 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 234    02/16/16   Page 30 of 30\n(and others) and in light of the public interest, fully and holistically considered. Accordingly, \nDefendant’s Motion for Stay Pending Appeal, for Expedited Consideration, and for \nTemporary Stay, (Doc. 229), is DENIED.  \n  Signed in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on February 16, 2016. \n \n \n \n   S \nJUDGE JOHN W. deGRAVELLES \n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nMIDDLE DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA \n \n30 of 30 \n ",

This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief brought under the United \nStates Constitution and 42 U.S.C. § 1983, to challenge the constitutionality of Louisiana \nHouse Bill 388, Regular Session (2014), to be codified at La. Rev. Stat. § 40:1299.35.2 \n(“H.B. 388” or the “Act”).   \n2.  The Act requires that every doctor who provides abortions have active admitting \nprivileges at a hospital not more than thirty miles from where the abortion is performed, and \ngives doctors a mere eighty-one days to comply, an impossible task in light of the fact that \nthe hospitals within the area proscribed by the statute can take anywhere from 90 days to \nseven months to decide on a doctor’s privileges application. \n3.  Despite this and other obstacles, each doctor who does not currently have such \nprivileges at Clinic Plaintiffs has submitted at least one application at a hospital within thirty \nmiles of the clinic.  \n4.  Upon information and belief, if the statute is enforced on its effective date of \nSeptember 1, 2014, it is not at all clear that any doctor currently providing abortions at a \nclinic in Louisiana will be able to continue providing those services, thereby eliminating \naccess to legal abortion in Louisiana.   \ndc-767422  \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 1    08/22/14   Page 3 of 10\n5.  As such, the admitting privileges requirement threatens irreparable injury to the \nClinic Plaintiffs, their staff, and their patients, including, but not limited to, by depriving \nPlaintiff’s patients’ of their constitutional right to an abortion. \n6.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief from these constitutional \ndeprivations. \n \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims under 28 U.S.C. § \n1331 and 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3)-(4). \n8.  Plaintiffs’ action for declaratory and injunctive relief is authorized by 28 U.S.C. §§ \n2201 and 2202 and by Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n9.  Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because a substantial part of the \nevents giving rise to this action occurred in this district, and the majority of Defendants, who \nare sued in their official capacities, carry out their official duties at offices located in this \ndistrict.  \nPARTIES \n10.  Plaintiffs are 3 of only 5 clinics that provide abortions in the entire state of \nLouisiana.   \n11.  Hope is a women’s reproductive health clinic located in Shreveport, Louisiana, and \nhas been providing care since 1980.  Hope is a member of the National Abortion Federation, \nand is licensed and inspected annually by DHH.  In addition to abortion services, Hope \nprovides contraception, pregnancy testing and counseling, adoption referrals, community and \nhealth professional education programs, and speaker services available to high schools, \ndc-767422  \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 1    08/22/14   Page 4 of 10\ncolleges, and organizations to present information on birth control, abortion, adolescent \nsexuality and decision-making, and sexually transmitted diseases. Hope sues on its own \nbehalf and on behalf of its physicians, staff and patients. \n12.  Bossier is a women’s reproductive health clinic that has been operating in Bossier \nCity since 1980, and provides both first and second trimester abortion services.  In addition \nto abortion services, Bossier City offers pregnancy tests, ultrasounds, and pap smears to \nreturning patients. Bossier City sues on its own behalf and on behalf of its physicians, staff \nand patients. \n13.  Causeway has been providing abortion and reproductive health services to the \nwomen of Louisiana since 1999.  It is located in Metairie, Louisiana, and provides both first \nand second trimester abortions services.  In addition to abortion services, Causeway offers \npregnancy testing, ultrasounds, and pap smears to returning patients.  Causeway sues on its \nown behalf and on behalf of its staff and patients. \n14.  Plaintiff Dr. John Doe 1, M.D., is a board-certified medical doctor specializing in \nobstetrics and gynecology with over 8 years of experience.  He is one of two clinic \nphysicians at Hope providing women’s health services to the clinic’s patients, including \nproviding abortion services.  Plaintiff Doe 1 sues on his own behalf and on behalf of his \npatients.   \n15.  Plaintiff Dr. John Doe 2, M.D., is a board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist (“ob-\ngyn”) with over 34 years of experience in women’s health. He is one of two clinic physicians \nat Causeway, and the only clinic physician at Bossier who provides abortion services.  \nPlaintiff Doe 2 sues on his own behalf and on behalf of his patients. \ndc-767422  \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 1    08/22/14   Page 5 of 10\nDEFENDANTS \n16.  James David Caldwell is the Attorney General of the state of Louisiana.  As \nAttorney General, Defendant Caldwell has the authority to enforce the Act. He is sued in his \nofficial capacity. \n17.  Jimmy Guidry is the Louisiana State Health Officer and Medical Director of the \nLouisiana Department of Health and Hospitals.  The Department of Health and Hospitals has \nthe authority to revoke or deny clinics’ licenses for violation of this or any other law. La. \nRev. Stat. § 40:2175.6.  He is being sued in his official capacity. \n18.  Mark Henry Dawson is the President of the Louisiana State Board of Medical \nExaminers.  The State Board of Medical Examiners has the authority to take disciplinary \naction against a physician who violates this or any other law. La. Rev. Stat. § 37:1263 et seq. \nHe is being sued in his official capacity. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n19.  Legal abortion is one of the safest procedures in medical practice.  Abortion \ncomplications are exceedingly rare: nationwide, less than 0.3% of abortion patients \nexperience a complication that requires hospitalization.  The Clinic Plaintiffs’ hospitalization \nrates are even lower: at Hope, over the last 20 years, just 0.007% of patients experienced \ncomplications requiring hospitalization.  At Bossier, the complication rate is only 0.004% for \nthe past 5 years, and Causeway’s complication rate for the past 5 years was just 0.0009%. \n20.   Even though abortion is exceedingly safe, Plaintiffs provide high quality care in the \nrare event of complications requiring hospitalization.  Although most complications related \nto abortions are safely and appropriately managed in the clinic setting, in the rare event that a \ndc-767422  \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 1    08/22/14   Page 6 of 10\npatient needs to be transferred to a hospital, Plaintiffs have robust policies in place to ensure \na high level of care.   \n21.  Complications from abortion are not only rare, but the few complications that do \noccur may not present until after a patient has left the clinic.  Upon discharge, Plaintiffs \nprovide their patients with phone numbers to call if they experience complications or have \nconcerns at any time after they have left the clinic.  In rare cases where emergency care is \nrequired, Plaintiffs’ staff will refer the patient to a local emergency room, as is also \nconsistent with the standard of care. \n22.  Many of Plaintiff Clinics’ patients travel from other parts of the state, or from \nneighboring states, to reach the clinic.  If these patients experience a complication that \nrequires emergency treatment after they have returned home, it is the standard of care to refer \nthe patient to the hospital closest to her, rather than to require the patient to travel in an \nemergency situation to a hospital where her physician may have admitting privileges.   \n23.  In the event that a patient does require post-procedure care at a hospital, patients \ntypically are treated by the emergency room doctors on an outpatient basis and released.  To \nthe extent complications arise, the majority are similar to those encountered by women \nexperiencing miscarriage, which emergency room doctors can, and routinely do, handle. \n24.  Requiring abortion providers to have hospital admitting privileges, therefore, does \nnot increase patient safety and is medically unnecessary. \nTHE ACT AND ITS IMPACT \n25.  The Act provides that every doctor who provides abortions must “have active \nadmitting privileges at a hospital that is located not further than thirty miles from the location \nat which the abortion is performed or induced and that provides obstetrical or gynecological \ndc-767422  \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 1    08/22/14   Page 7 of 10\nhealth care services (“admitting privileges requirement”).   Exhibit 11 at § (A)(2)(a) \n(amending La. Rev. Stat. § 1299.35.2).  “Active admitting privileges” means that “the \nphysician is a member in good standing of the medical staff of a hospital that is currently \nlicensed by the department, with the ability to admit a patient and to provide diagnostic and \nsurgical services to such patient.”  Id. \n26.  Any doctor who violates this provision is subject to a fine of not more than four \nthousand dollars.  Id. at § (A)(2)(c).  Furthermore, failure to comply with the admitting \nprivileges requirement will subject a clinic to adverse licensure action, up to and including \nlicense revocation.  Id. at § (A)(1). \n27.  No physician who provides abortions at Bossier City or Causeway has admitting \nprivileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic. Although one physician at Hope has \nadmitting privileges, the physician who provides the majority of abortions at Hope does not.   \n28.  Although all of Clinic Plaintiffs’ physicians who do not have admitting privileges \nhave applied for such privileges at a local hospital, there is not enough time for the hospitals \nto consider and decide the submitted applications before the Act takes effect.  The process of \napplying for privileges and receiving a decision from a hospital on such an application can \nand generally does take months. \n29.  Hospitals have discretion in granting admitting privileges to doctors, and can deny \nprivileges for reasons unrelated to qualification, such as a minimum number of guaranteed \nhospital admissions per year; political, ideological, or religious reasons; or based on \nresidency requirements. \n30.  If the Act takes effect, Plaintiffs Hope, Bossier, and Causeway will stop providing \nabortion services.  It is not at all clear that either of the other two clinics in Louisiana who \n                                                 \n1 Exhibit 1 to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction, filed August 22, 2014. \ndc-767422  \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 1    08/22/14   Page 8 of 10\ncurrently provide abortions will able to continue to do so as of September 1, because none of \nthe doctors who perform abortions there currently have admitting privileges at a qualifying \nhospital.  The Act, therefore, will make legal abortion unavailable in the state of Louisiana.  \n31.  Louisiana law does not require a physician providing any type of medical procedure \nother than abortion to have admitting privileges at a local hospital.  Physicians perform \nsimilar, and often higher risk, outpatient procedures in their offices without admitting \nprivileges. \nIRREPARABLE INJURY \n32.  Plaintiffs and their patients will suffer irreparable harm from the violation of their \nconstitutional rights if the Act goes into effect. \n33.  The Act will force Plaintiffs to close their clinics and will prevent them from \nproviding comprehensive reproductive health care to their patients.  It is not at all clear that \neither of the other two clinics currently providing abortions in Louisiana could continue to do \nso as of September 1. \n34.  The Act will jeopardize women’s health, shutting down health centers that provide \nabortions without medical justification, and either eliminate or severely limit the availability \nof abortions in the state.  As a result, many Louisiana women will be forced to carry their \npregnancies to term, while other may resort to self-abortion. \n35.  Even if some women are able to obtain an abortion in Louisiana after the Act takes \neffect, by severely reducing the number of legal abortion providers in the state, the Act will \nforce women to incur additional travel costs and delays in obtaining an abortion.  Although \nabortion is one of the safest surgical procedures, the risk of complications, as well as the cost \nof the procedure, increases as the pregnancy advances.  Given that many of Plaintiffs’ \ndc-767422  \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 1    08/22/14   Page 9 of 10\npatients live below the federal poverty line, the increased costs alone will make it impossible \nfor some women to obtain an abortion. \n36.  The Act will therefore irreparably harm Plaintiffs’ patients in two ways: threatening \nthe health of women seeking abortions, and depriving women of their constitutionally \nprotected right to obtain a pre-viability abortion. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \n(Procedural Due Process) \n37.  The allegations of paragraphs 1 through 34 are incorporated as though fully set \nforth herein. \n38.  The Act violates Plaintiffs’ rights not to be deprived of liberty and property without \ndue process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \nCOUNT II \n(Substantive Due Process – Right to Privacy) \n39.  The allegations of paragraphs 1 through 34 are incorporated as though fully set \nforth herein. \n40.  The Act violates Plaintiffs’ patients’ right to liberty and privacy as guaranteed by \nthe due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution because it has \nthe unlawful purpose and effect of imposing an undue burden on women’s right to choose \nabortion before viability. \n \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court: \ndc-767422  \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 1    08/22/14   Page 10 of 10\n1.  declare Louisiana House Bill 388, Regular Session (2014), unconstitutional \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; \n2.  without bond, enjoin Defendants, their employees, agents, and successors in \noffice from enforcing H.B. 388; \n3.  award Plaintiffs costs and attorneys’ fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988; and \n4.  grant Plaintiffs such other, further, and different relief as the Court may deem \njust and proper. \nRespectfully submitted this 22nd day of August, 2014. \n            /s/ William E.

(Doc. 87). Plaintiffs oppose the motion. (Doc. 104). Defendants \nhave filed a Reply Brief. (Doc. 107). The Court has reviewed the briefs (Docs. 87, 104 and 107) \nand heard and reviewed the oral argument of March 19, 2015. (Doc. 137). For the reasons which \nfollow, the motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. \nI.  BACKGROUND & PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nPlaintiffs  are  June  Medical  Services,  LLC  d/b/a  Hope  Medical  Group  for  Women \n(hereinafter  “Hope”),  Bossier  City  Medical  Suite  (“Bossier”),  Choice,  Inc.,  of  Texas  d/b/a \nCauseway Medical Clinic (“Choice”) and Drs. John Doe 1 and 2.1 Defendant is Kathy Kliebert \n(“Kliebert”) sued in her official capacity as the Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Health \nand Hospitals (“DHH”).2  \n \n                                                            \n1 A Protective Order (Doc. 24) was issued protecting the identity of all doctors performing abortions in Louisiana, \nincluding those who are plaintiffs herein (Drs. Doe 1 and 2) and those who are not (Drs. Doe 3, 4, 5 and 6). \n \n2 Secretary Kliebert was added as a defendant in an Amended Complaint. (Doc. 14). Since the filing of this motion, \nDr. Mark Dawson was dismissed based on a stipulation and Joint Motion and Order to Dismiss. (Docs. 110 and \n111). In the original Complaint, Plaintiffs sued James David Caldwell in his official capacity as Louisiana Attorney \nGeneral and Dr. Jimmy Guidry his official capacity as Louisiana State Health Officer and Medical Director of DHH. \nThe Court dismissed both Caldwell and Guidry. (Doc. 31). \n1 \n \n\nOn August 22, 2014, Plaintiffs filed a Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief \n(Doc. 1) and an Application for Temporary  Restraining Order and Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction (Doc. 5) seeking to enjoin Defendants from enforcing Section (A)(2)(a) of La. House \nBill 388, Regular Session (La. 2014), Act 620 (hereinafter “Act 620\" or the “Act”). (Doc. 5-2, p. \n1). This Act is codified at La. Rev. Stat. § 40:1299.35.2. Section A(2)(a) requires every doctor \nwho performs abortions in Louisiana to have “active admitting privileges” at a hospital within 30 \nmiles of the facility where abortions are performed. (Doc. 5-2, p. 3). While the Act contains \nother requirements, this provision is the only one being challenged. (Doc 5-1, p. 8, n.1). Act 620 \nwas signed into law on June 12, 2014. Its effective date was September 1, 2014. (Doc. 5-2, p. 6). \nPlaintiffs  Hope,  Bossier  and  Choice  are  three  of  five  licensed  abortion  clinics  in \nLouisiana. They are located in Shreveport, Bossier City and Metairie respectively. Drs. Doe 1 \nand 2 are two of six physicians performing abortions in Louisiana. Dr. Doe 1 performs abortions \nat Hope. Dr. Doe 2 performs abortions at Bossier and Choice.  \nThe Court issued a Temporary Restraining Order on August 31, 2014, enjoining Act 620 \n“until a hearing is held for the purpose of determining whether a preliminary injunction should \nissue. Plaintiffs will continue to seek admitting privileges. The Act will be allowed to take effect \nbut Plaintiffs will not be subject to the penalties and sanctions allowed in the statute at this time \nor in the future for practicing without the relevant admitting privileges during the application \nprocess. Plaintiffs will be allowed to operate lawfully while continuing their efforts to obtain \nprivileges.” (Doc. 31, p. 18).  \nOn September 19, 2014, a separate Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief was \nfiled by Women’s Health Care Center, Inc., Delta Clinic of Baton Rouge, Inc., Dr. John Doe 5 \nand Dr. John Doe 6 (referred to hereafter as “Women’s Health Plaintiffs”). (No. 3:14-cv-00597, \n2 \n \n\nDocs. 1 and 5 respectively). These two cases were consolidated on September 24, 2014. (No. \n3:14-cv-00597, Doc. 8) \nAll parties agreed in briefs and orally at a status conference held on September 30, 2014, \nthat significant discovery would need to be done to prepare for the hearing; therefore, the Court \nset the preliminary injunction hearing for March 30, 2015. A Joint Proposed Scheduling Order \nwas submitted by the parties on October 8, 2014 (Doc. 49) and made the order of the Court on \nOctober 21, 2014. (Doc. 56).  \nOn November 3, 2014, following the addition of the Women’s Health Plaintiffs, this \nCourt issued an Order Clarifying Temporary Restraining Order of August 31, 2014 (Doc. 57) in \nwhich, for the reasons given therein, the Court ruled that “It was and is the intention of this Court \nthat the TRO remain in effect as to all parties before it until the end of the Preliminary Injunction \nHearing.” (Doc. 57, at p.6). \nOn December 5, 2014, the Women’s Health Plaintiffs filed a Motion For Voluntary \nDismissal (Doc. 70), and with the consent of all remaining parties, the Court dismissed their suit \nwithout prejudice on December 14, 2014. (Doc. 77). In light of that dismissal, the Court on \nJanuary 15, 2015, issued a Second Order Clarifying Temporary Restraining Order of August 31, \n2014 (Doc. 84) in which it, for reasons explained therein, ruled that “the TRO of August 31, \n2014 remains in force until the Preliminary Injunction hearing on March 30, 2015.” \nOn  February  16,  2015,  Defendants  filed  the  present  Motion  for  Partial  Summary \nJudgment (Doc. 87) and a briefing schedule on the motion was set. On February 24, 2015, \nDefendants filed a Motion for Oral Argument on Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Doc \n90). On March 3, 2015, the Court granted that motion (Doc 92), and oral argument was set and \nheard on March 19, 2015. \n3 \n \n\nBased on a stipulation reached among the parties, a Joint Motion to Dismiss Defendant \nMark Dawson was filed on March 17, 2015 (Doc. 110) and granted the same day. (Doc. 111). On \nMarch 20, 2015, the parties conferred with the Court and agreed to a continuance of the hearing \non the preliminary injunction until the week of June 22, 2015. (Doc. 129). The parties agreed that \nthe Temporary Restraining Order would remain in effect until the completion of the trial and \nruling on the merits of the preliminary injunction. (Doc. 129) \nOn April 1, 2015, oral argument was heard on motions in limine filed by the parties. In its \nruling (Doc. 136), the Court denied Plaintiffs’ Motion in Limine to Preclude Expert Testimony \nof Dr. Tumulesh Solanky (Doc 96) and Defendant’s Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony of \nSheila Katz, Ph.D. (Doc. 99). Plaintiffs’ Motion in Limine to Preclude Expert Testimony of Dr. \nMcMillan (Doc. 97) was denied as moot. Because of their connection to Defendant’s Motion for \nSummary Judgment, Defendant’s Motion in Limine to Exclude Irrelevant Evidence (Doc. 95) \nand Plaintiffs’ Motion in Limine to Preclude Evidence of DHH Deficiency Reports and Related \nEvidence (Doc. 98) were taken under advisement.  \nII.  CONTENTIONS OF THE PARTIES \nIn Plaintiffs’ Application for Temporary Restraining Order and Motion For Temporary \nRestraining  Order,  Plaintiffs  challenge  Act  620  as  an  unconstitutional  abridgment  of  their \npatients’ right to an abortion guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment. (Doc. 5, p. 2). \nPlaintiffs contend that Act 620 does not have a rational basis, and its purpose and effect is to \nplace an undue burden on the right of Louisiana women to receive an abortion. (Docs. 5, 5-1 and \n102).  \n“[F]or more than forty years, it has been settled constitutional law that the Fourteenth \nAmendment protects a woman’s basic right to choose an abortion.” Jackson Women’s Health \n4 \n \n\nOrg. v. Currier, 760 F.3d 448, 453 (5th Cir. 2014), petition for cert. pending, No. 14-997 (filed \nFebruary 19, 2015) (citing Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 153, 93 S. Ct. 705 (1973)). The Supreme \nCourt has held that this right can be regulated by a state consistent with the state’s interest in \nprotecting potential life and health, but only if the regulation does not place an “undue burden” \non the basic right to terminate a pregnancy by abortion prior to the fetus’s viability. Planned \nParenthood of S.E. Penn. v. Casey,  505  U.S.  833,  877,  112  S.  Ct.  2791  (1992)  (plurality \nopinion). An “undue burden . . . exists if a regulation’s ‘purpose or effect is to place a substantial \nobstacle in the path of a woman seeking a[] [pre-viability] abortion.’” Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 \nU.S. 124, 146, 127 S. Ct. 1610 (2007) (quoting Casey, 505 U.S. at 878).  \n  In addition to the “undue burden” test, abortion restrictions must pass rational basis \nreview. Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex. Surgical Health Servs. v. Abbott (“Abbott II”),748 \nF.3d 583 (5th Cir. 2014), reh’g & reh’g en banc denied, 769 F.3d 330 (5th Cir. 2014); Currier, \n760 F.3d at 453 (“In addition to creating no undue burden, an abortion restriction must pass a \nrational basis test.”); see also Whole Woman’s Health v. Lakey, 769 F.3d 285 (5th Cir. 2014), \nvacated in part, 135 S. Ct. 299 (2014).   \n  The issue of whether the effect of Act 620 places an undue burden on a woman’s right to \nan  abortion  is  not  raised  in  Defendant  Kliebert’s  Motion  for  Partial  Summary  Judgment.  \nDefendant concedes that the Preliminary Injunction hearing can properly consider the issue of \nthe Act’s effect. (Doc. 137, pp. 32-33). Rather, Defendant contends that she is entitled to \nsummary  judgment  on  two  specific  claims  made  by  Plaintiffs:  1)  that  Act  620  imposes  a \nmedically unreasonable requirement, and 2) that Act 620 has the improper purpose of placing an \nundue burden on abortion access in Louisiana. (Doc. 87-1, p. 7). Defendant argues that the Fifth \nCircuit’s Abbott II and Currier decisions rejecting a rational review challenge to statutes similar \n5 \n \n\nto Act 620 are binding on this Court and dispositive of these two claims (See, e.g., Doc. 87-1, pp. \n9-10 (citing Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 594 and Currier, 760 F.3d at 454)).  \n  Furthermore, Defendant argues that the rational review test applied by the Fifth Circuit, \nalthough admittedly different from that used in other circuits (See, e.g., Planned Parenthood of \nAriz. v. Humble, 753 F.3d 905, 913 (9th Cir. 2014)), does not permit the introduction of evidence \nof the kind that Plaintiffs believe creates a factual issue in this case. Defendant points to Abbott \nII’s suggestion that the taking of evidence on the issue of rational review is unnecessary and \ninappropriate. Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 596 (“[T]here is ‘never a role for evidentiary proceedings’ \nunder rational basis review.” (quoting Nat’l Paint & Coatings Ass’n v. City of Chicago, 45 F.3d \n1124, 1127 (7th Cir. 1995))). Thus, Defendant argues, while there may be issues of fact, these \nfact issues are no longer material to the Plaintiffs’ rational review challenge, and therefore \nsummary judgment should be granted in her favor as a matter of law. In conclusion, Defendant \nargues that Currier and Abbott II “compel[] the conclusion that Louisiana Act 620 reasonably \nfurthers valid interests in protecting the safety of women who seek abortion.” (Doc 87-1 at p. \n11). \n  As to Plaintiffs’ claim that Act 620 was passed with the unlawful purpose of placing an \nundue burden on a woman’s right to an abortion, Defendant argues that this too is foreclosed by \nAbbott II and Currier, both of which held that laws identical to Act 620 furthered valid interests. \n(Doc. 87-1, p. 18). Defendant concedes that “[t]he Fifth Circuit has not clarified the relationship \nbetween the rational basis inquiry and Casey’s purpose prong.” (Id.). However, Defendant posits \nthat “whether an abortion regulation furthers legitimate interests is highly relevant to whether the \nregulation has a valid purpose under Casey.” (Id.). Therefore, “given [the] binding Fifth Circuit \nprecedent finding identical privileges laws from other states further . . . valid interests, it is \n6 \n \n\nlegally untenable for plaintiffs to argue that Act 620 has some other, hidden purpose that runs \nafoul of Casey.” (Id.). \nPlaintiffs argue that Act 620 is not rationally related to a legitimate state interest. (See, \ne.g., Doc. 102, pp. 5-7; Doc. 104, pp. 7-10). They argue that, despite the holdings in Abbott II \nand  Currier,  this  Court  must  make  an  independent  and  “context–specific”  examination  of \nwhether Act 620 has a relationship to the State’s purported goals and must therefore “examine \nthe State[’s] . . . rationale informed by the setting and history of the challenged rule.” (Doc. 104, \np. 9 (quoting St. Joseph Abbey v. Castille, 712 F.3d 215, 223 (5th Cir. 2013), cert denied, 134 S. \nCt. 423 (2013))).  \n  Plaintiffs believe that evidence regarding undue burden is relevant to and intertwined \nwith the rational basis review and that Plaintiffs’ proposed evidence raises a substantial question \nof whether the admitting privileges requirement is reasonably designed to further the state’s \ninterest in women’s health or whether, to the contrary, it “would result in a net harm to women \nseeking abortions.” (Doc. 104, p. 11). Because this evidence raises factual issues which are in \ndispute, Plaintiffs argue that the Motion for Partial Summary Judgment should be denied.  \n  Even if the rational review prong is foreclosed by Abbott II and Currier (which they \ndispute), Plaintiffs contend that the evidence on the issue of “medical justification is crucial to \nthe undue burden analysis” because “[t]he undue burden standard, properly understood, is highly \nfact-dependent and requires this Court to evaluate whether the particular law, in the factual \ncontext in which it operates: (a) actually furthers a valid state interest, (b) has a valid purpose, \ntaking into account its practical operation and the fit between the means and the purported ends \nof the restriction, and (c) places a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an \n7 \n \n\nabortion.” (Id. at p. 6). Thus, argue Plaintiffs, “such evidence is crucial in the analysis of the \neffects under the undue burden standard.” (Id. at p. 23). \nIII.  STANDARD \n“The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” \nFed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). If the mover bears his burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of \nfact, “its opponent must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to \nthe material facts. . . . [T]he nonmoving party must come forward with ‘specific facts showing \nthat there is a genuine issue for trial.’” See  Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., \n475 U.S. 574, 586–587, 106 S.Ct. 1348 (1986) (internal citations omitted). The non-mover's \nburden is not satisfied by “conclusory allegations, by unsubstantiated assertions, or by only a \n‘scintilla’ of evidence.” Little v. Liquid Air Corp., 37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir.1994) (citations \nand internal quotations omitted). “Where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational \ntrier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no ‘genuine issue for trial.’” Matsushita \nElec. Indus. Co., 475 U.S. at 587. Further: \nIn resolving the motion, the court may not undertake to evaluate the credibility of \nthe witnesses, weigh the evidence, or resolve factual disputes; so long as the \nevidence  in  the  record  is  such  that  a  reasonable  [fact-finder]  drawing  all \ninferences in favor of the nonmoving party could arrive at a verdict in that party's \nfavor, the court must deny the motion. \n \nInternational Shortstop, Inc. v. Rally's, Inc., 939 F.2d 1257, 1263 (5th Cir.1991). \n \n  The procedures in a Rule 65(a) preliminary injunction hearing are “less formal \nand [the] evidence . . . is less complete than in a trial on the merits.” Jonibach Mgmt. \nTrust  v.  Wartburg  Enterprises,  Inc.,  750  F.3d  486,  491  (5th  Cir.  2014)  (quoting \nUniversity of Tex. v. Comenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395, 101 S. Ct. 1830 (1981)). This less \n8 \n \n\nformal standard is in accordance with the primary purpose of a preliminary injunction, \nnamely “to preserve the relative positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be \nhad.” Id.; see also 11A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, & Mary Kay Kane, \nFederal Practice and Procedure §2947 (3d ed. 2013) (“[A] preliminary injunction is an \ninjunction that is issued to protect plaintiff from irreparable injury and to preserve the \ncourt's power to render a meaningful decision after a trial on the merits.”). \nIV.  DISCUSSION \n  Plaintiffs challenge Act 620 as unconstitutional on three broad grounds. First, under the \nrational review prong of the Casey test, Act 620 does not serve a legitimate state interest. (Doc. \n102, pp. 5-7). Second, the effect of Act 620 imposes an undue burden on the right of Louisiana \nwomen to have an abortion. (Id. at 7-16). And third, the purpose of Act 620 is to create a \nsubstantial obstacle to a Louisiana woman’s right to an abortion. (Id. at 16-19). Both sides agree \nthat the question of whether the effect of Act 620 creates an undue burden is properly before the \nCourt for consideration in the upcoming preliminary injunction hearing. In her Motion for \nSummary Judgment, Defendant seeks to eliminate two discrete issues from consideration at the \nhearing:  1) whether Act 620 imposes a medically unreasonable requirement, and 2) whether Act \n620 has the improper purpose of placing an undue burden on abortion access in Louisiana. (Doc. \n87-1, p. 7).   \n  The essence of Defendant’s argument is that both issues were decided in Abbott II and \nCurrier,  which  are  binding  on  this  Court  and  require  the  granting  of  Defendant’s  motion. \nFurther, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs have failed to offer admissible and relevant evidence in \nsupport of their position that Act 620 has an improper purpose. The essence of Plaintiffs’ \nresponse is that: 1) Abbott II and Currier do not bind this Court on rational review because that \n9 \n \n\nanalysis is fact-specific and must be evaluated in the context of this specific statute as applied in \nthis specific state; 2) that medical justification is relevant to the issue of the statute’s alleged \nundue burden; and 3) that medical justification is relevant to the statute’s purpose, an issue \nrelated to but separate from rational basis or the statute’s effect, and one not addressed in Abbott \nII or Currier. \nA.  Recent Fifth Circuit Precedent Governing Abortion Regulations  \nThe Court must start with an evaluation of Abbott II, Currier and Lakey because, if \napplicable to the issues of this case, this Court is bound to follow them. \ni.  Abbott II \n  Abbott II involved a challenge to two provisions of 2013 Texas House Bill No. 2 (“Texas \nH.B. 2\"). Abbott II, 748 F.3d 583. One of those provisions is similar to Act 620 in that it requires \na physician performing or inducing an abortion to have admitting privileges at a hospital no more \nthan thirty miles from the location where the abortion is provided. Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 587.3 \nPlaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of Texas H.B. 2 as a violation of patients’ substantive \ndue  process  rights,  a  violation  of  physicians’  procedural  due  process  rights,  an  unlawful \ndelegation of authority to hospitals and as being impermissibly vague. \n  After a bench trial, the district court found parts of the admitting privileges requirement \nunconstitutional as lacking a rational basis and placing an undue burden on a woman’s right to an \nabortion and issued an opinion permanently enjoining that provision of the statute. Planned \nParenthood of Greater Tex. Surgical Health Servs. v. Abbott, 951 F. Supp. 2d 891, 909 (W.D. \nTex. 2013), rev'd in part, 748 F.3d 583 (5th Cir. 2014). The State filed an emergency motion to \nstay the district court’s injunction pending the resolution of the State’s appeal, which the Court \n                                                            \n3 Texas H.B. 2 also mandates that the administration of abortion producing drugs comply with the protocol \nauthorized by the Food and Drug Administration, with limited exceptions. Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 587. There is no \ncomparable provision in Act 620. This opinion deals only with the admitting privileges issue. \n10 \n \n\nof Appeals granted in part. Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex. Surgical Health Servs. v. Abbott \n(“Abbott I”), 734 F.3d 406 (5th Cir. 2013).  In a five-four decision, the Supreme Court refused to \nvacate the Court of Appeals’ stay. Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex. Surgical Health Servs. \nOf Greater Tex. v. Abbott, ___ U.S. ___, 134 S. Ct. 506 (2013).   \n  On appeal of the district court’s judgment, the Fifth Circuit held that the issue of an \nabortion  regulation’s  constitutionality  is  decided  in  two  parts:  it  “must  pass  rational  basis \nreview” and also must not place an undue burden on a woman’s right to an abortion. Abbott II, \n748 F.3d at 590 (citing Gonzales, 550 U.S. at 158). In Abbott II, the plaintiffs challenged Texas \nH.B. 2 as unconstitutional both facially and as-applied. Id. at 589. As to the facial challenge, the \nCourt noted that the “[s]tandard principles of constitutional adjudication require courts to engage \nin  facial  invalidation  only  if  no  possible  application  of  the  challenged  law  would  be \nconstitutional.” Id. at 588. However, the Court stated that “whether the Supreme Court applies \nthis rule in the same way in abortion cases as in others is uncertain.” Id. (“[A]n abortion-\nregulating statute . . . fail[s] constitutional muster if it erect[s] an undue burden on women’s \ndecisions to choose abortion in a ‘large fraction’ of the cases.” (citing Casey, 505 U.S. at 895; \nGonzales, 550 U.S. at 168)). \n  In terms of sequencing, the Court said that “[t]he first-step of the analysis of an abortion \nregulation . . . is rational basis review, not empirical basis review.” Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 596 \n(emphasis  in  original)  (citing  Gonzales,  550  U.S.  at  158).4  As  to  this  first-step,  the  Court \nreversed the district court’s holding that the admitting privileges requirement failed rational basis \n                                                            \n4 In Currier, the Fifth Circuit acknowledged that there is disagreement as to whether the rational review test is \nindependent from and precedes the undue burden test but found it unnecessary to resolve the dispute. Currier, 760 \nF.3d at 454. Lakey, however, clearly reaffirms Abbott II in what it calls the Fifth Circuit’s “two-step approach, first \ndetermining whether the law at issue satisfies rational basis, then whether it places a substantial obstacle in the path \nof a large fraction of women seeking abortions.” Whole Woman’s Health v. Lakey, 769 F.3d 285, 297 (5th Cir. \n2014), vacated in part, 135 S. Ct. 299 (2014). \n \n11 \n \n\nreview. Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 591. The Court took issue with the district court’s conclusion \nbecause it was based on the failure of the State to produce evidence that a rational relationship \nexisted between this requirement and improved patient care and the failure of the State to \nproduce evidence that the requirement “address[ed] issues of patient abandonment, hospital costs \nor accountability.” Id. at 593-94. In support of its conclusion, the Court pointed to “the Supreme \nCourt’s oft-repeated guidance, that there is ‘never a role for evidentiary proceedings’ under \nrational basis review.” Id. at 596 (quoting  Nat’l Paint & Coatings Ass’n v. City of Chicago, 45 \nF.3d 1124, 1127 (7th Cir. 1995)).5 “[L]egislative choice is not subject to courtroom fact-finding.” \nAbbott II, 748 F.3d at 594 (quoting F.C.C. v. Beach Commc’ns, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 315, 113 S. \nCt. 2096 (1993)). \n  The  Court  set  out  a  number  of  principles  to  observe  in  deciding  whether  abortion \nregulation passes rational review, i.e. whether it is rationally related to a legitimate state interest. \nThe rational basis test seeks only to determine whether there is any conceivable basis for the \nenactment. Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 594 (citing Beach Commc’ns, 508 U.S. at 313). A district court \nshould not relitigate the facts that led to the passage of the law. Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 594 (citing \nHeller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 320, 113 S. Ct. 2637 (1993)). Rather, “[a] law based on rational \nspeculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data’ satisfies rational basis review.” Abbott II, \n748 F.3d at 594 (quoting Beach Commc’ns, 508 U.S. at 315). \n  As to Plaintiffs’ contention that the Texas H.B. 2 had an impermissible purpose, the \nCourt found that the district court erred in placing the burden on the State to disprove improper \npurpose. This, said the Court, is “plainly backwards.” Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 597 (the burden of \n                                                            \n5  It is interesting, however, that the Court did discuss testimony and other evidence introduced at the trial in \nconnection with its conclusion that the law passed rational review by serving a medical purpose and that the thirty \nmile geographic restriction requirement also passed rational review. Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 594-96 (“There is \nsufficient evidence here that the geographic restriction has a rational basis.”). \n12 \n \n\nproving the unconstitutionality of the abortion statute rests with the plaintiff (citing Mazurek v. \nArmstrong, 520 U.S. 968, 972, 117 S. Ct. 1865 (1997))). The Court then found that the plaintiffs \nproduced no evidence to show that the admitting privileges requirement was passed to limit \nabortions or for any other improper purpose. Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 597. Plaintiffs “did not attack \nthe State’s purpose at all. There is thus no basis for a finding of impermissible purpose under \nCasey.” Id.  \n  The  Court  also  reversed  the  district  court’s  conclusion  that  the  admitting  privileges \nrequirement created an undue burden on the right of women to obtain an abortion. Id. Because \nthe effect prong of the undue burden test is not the subject of the motion before this Court, it is \nnot necessary to review the Court’s conclusions except that it found that the plaintiffs failed to \ncarry their burden of proof on the facts. Id. at 600 (“[T]he regulation will not affect a significant \n(much less ‘large’) fraction of such women . . . .”). \nii.  Currier \n  At issue in Currier was Mississippi House Bill 1390 (“Miss. H.B. 1390”) passed by the \nMississippi Legislature in April of 2102 which took effect in July of 2012. Jackson Women’s \nHealth Org. v. Currier, 760 F.3d 448, 450 (5th Cir. 2014), petition for cert. pending, No. 14-997 \n(filed February 19, 2015). Miss. H.B. 1390 requires that “[a]ll physicians associated with the \nabortion facility must have admitting privileges at a local hospital and staff privileges to replace \nlocal hospital on-staff physicians.” Id. The district court held that the statute created an undue \nburden  and  therefore  did  not  address  the  rational  basis  issue  because  to  do  so  would  be \n“superfluous.” Currier, 760 F.3d at 454. The Fifth Circuit, “assum[ed] that a rational basis \nreview is a necessary first step.” Id. Acting on that assumption, the Fifth Circuit found that \n13 \n \n\nbecause Abbott II held that “a virtually identical law” had a rational basis, “we are bound by that \nprecedent to accept that the Mississippi statute has a rational basis.” Id.  \n  The Court then moved to whether the purpose or effect of the law created an undue \nburden. Because the district court had not reached the “purpose inquiry,” and the parties did not \nargue it, the Court did not consider or decide this prong of the test. Id. at 454-55. The district \ncourt’s finding that the effect of the law would be to close Mississippi’s only abortion clinic was \nnot contested by the State. Id. at 452. The Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s finding \nthat this effect created an undue burden and affirmed the preliminary injunction against the \nenforcement of that portion of Miss. H.B. 1390.  \niii.  Lakey \n  In Lakey, Plaintiffs challenged the admitting privileges requirement of Texas H.B. 2 as \napplied to two specific abortion clinics. Whole Woman’s Health v. Lakey, 769 F.3d 285 (5th Cir. \n2014), vacated in part, 135 S. Ct. 299 (2014). In addition, they challenged the law’s requirement \nthat abortion clinics existing on or after September 1, 2014, comply with the same minimum \nstandards required of ambulatory surgical centers (hereinafter “ASC”). Id. at 290. The district \ncourt  held  that,  together,  these  two  requirements  “create[d]  a  brutally  effective  system  of \nabortion regulation” and issued a final judgment enjoining these two portions of the law and \nothers as to all abortion facilities in Texas. Id. at 289. Although Plaintiffs’ challenge to the \nadmitting privileges requirement was limited to an as-applied challenge, the district court held \nthat both the admitting privileges and the ASC provision were unconstitutional on their face. Id.  \n  “To alleviate confusion and to fairly address the State’s emergency motion and the \nPlaintiffs’ response, [the Court of Appeals] consider[ed] whether to stay injunctions of both the \nadmitting privileges requirement and the ambulatory surgical center provision on their face . . . .” \n14 \n \n\nId. at 292. As to the admitting privileges part of the law, the Court of Appeals found that the \nState had shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits and, therefore, granted the \nState’s emergency motion for stay pending the resolution of the State’s appeal. Id. at 301. \n  In reaching its conclusion, the Court used what it called a “two-step approach,” applying \nfirst a rational basis inquiry followed by an undue burden analysis. Id. at 297. As to the first step, \nthe Court reaffirmed its test for rational basis, stating that “if the State establishes that a law is \nrationally related to a legitimate state interest, we do not second guess the legislature regarding \nthe law’s wisdom or effectiveness.” Id. at 294.  \n  The Court then turned to the second step – the undue burden analysis. “The undue burden \ninquiry looks to whether the challenged provision has either ‘the purpose or effect of placing a \nsubstantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus.’ If it does, it \nis unconstitutional.” Id. (emphasis in original) (quoting Casey, 505 U.S. at 877).  \n  In evaluating the possible undue burden of the ASC requirement, the Court separately \nconsidered “purpose” and “effect,” making the “purpose inquiry” first. Id. In reversing the \ndistrict court on the ASC provision, the Fifth Circuit emphasized that the district court “cited no \nrecord evidence to support its determination that [this] provision was enacted for the purpose of \nimposing an undue burden on women seeking abortions, nor did it make any factual finding \nregarding an improper purpose.” Id. at 294-95 (emphasis added).  \n  The Court then proceeded to examine the “effect” of the ASC provision. In doing so, it \nreemphasized its uncertainty as to the proper test to measure the extent of the burden. Id. at 295-\n96. While the general rule requires the plaintiff making a facial challenge to show that there is no \nset of circumstances under which the statute could be held constitutional, “as we noted in Abbott \nII, it is not clear whether the Supreme Court applies this general rule in abortion cases.” Id. \n15 \n \n\n(citing Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 588). Thus, the Court measured the effect utilizing both the \ntraditional standard and what the Court saw as the standard used in Casey: a statute regulating \nabortion will “fail constitutional muster if, ‘in a large fraction of the cases . . . it will operate as a \nsubstantial obstacle to a woman’s choice to undergo an abortion.’” Id. at 296 (emphasis in \noriginal) (quoting Casey, 505 U.S. at 895).6  \n  The Fifth Circuit rejected the district court’s use of a test followed by other circuits \nwherein the court measures the burden of the statute on a woman’s right to abortion by balancing \nthe efficacy of the provision against the burdens that it imposes. Id. at 296-97 (comparing \nPlanned Parenthood Ariz., Inc. v. Humble, 753 F.3d 905, 914 (9th Cir. 2014) and Planned \nParenthood of Wisc., Inc. v. Van Hollen, 783 F.3d 786, 791-99 (7th Cir. 2013), with Abbott II, \n748 F.3d at 593-94, 597, Planned Parenthood Sw. Ohio Region v. DeWine, 696 F.3d 490, 515 \n(6th Cir. 2012), Greenville Women’s Clinic v. Bryant, 222 F.3d 157 (4th Cir. 2000) and Women’s \nHealth Center of W. Cnty., Inc. v. Webster, 871 F.2d 1377 (8th Cir. 1989)); see also Lakey, 769 \nF.3d at 305 (“[O]ur circuit does not incorporate a balancing analysis into the undue burden \nanalysis.”). The Court also took issue with the district court’s failure to use the “large fraction” \ntest. Lakey, 769 F.3d at 298. \n  As to the admitting privileges requirement, the Court found that the unconstitutional as-\napplied challenge was likely barred by res judicata because the plaintiffs “could have brought, \nbut chose not to bring, as-applied challenges” in their suit. Id. at 301. In dicta, the Court found \nthat State was likely to succeed in proving that the effect of this and the ASC provisions had not \nproduced an undue burden on a woman’s right to an abortion as applied to the McAllen, Texas, \n                                                            \n6 In Judge Higginson’s separate concurring and dissenting opinion, he notes that Casey invalidated the spousal-\nnotification statute because it would prevent a “significant number” as well as a “large fraction” of women from \nobtaining an abortion. Lakey, 769 F.3d at 308 (Higginson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (citing Casey, \n505 U.S. at 893-95). \n16 \n \n\nclinic but had not so proved that likelihood of success regarding the El Paso clinic. Id. at 302-04. \nIn its review of the undue burden of the admitting privileges provision, the Court did not engage \nin a separate “purpose inquiry.”  \nB.  Analysis \n  In applying these principles to the case at hand, the Court notes that unlike any of the \ncases previously discussed, this is a motion for partial summary judgment.7 As such, the burden \nis on mover, Defendant Kliebert, to show that there is no material issue of fact and that she is \nentitled to judgment on her motion as a matter of law.  \n  Defendant contends that she is entitled to summary judgment on two specific claims \nmade by Plaintiffs: 1) that Act 620 imposes a medically unreasonable requirement, and 2) that \nAct 620 has the improper purpose of placing an undue burden on abortion access in Louisiana. \n(Doc. 87-1, p. 7). The two are related and therefore analyzed together.  \n  The admitting privileges requirement of Act 620 is substantially similar to both Texas \nH.B. 2 and Miss. H.B. 1390. To the extent that Plaintiffs contend that Act 620 is not rationally \nrelated to a legitimate state interest because it is medically unreasonable or unnecessary, this \nCourt is bound by the Fifth Circuit’s previous rulings in Abbott II, Currier and Lakey.  Abbott II, \nCurrier and Lakey make clear that the admitting privileges provision in Act 620 passes rational \nbasis review. Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 599-600; Currier, 760 F.3d at 454; Lakey, 769 F.3d at 293. \n  Plaintiffs argue, however, that Fifth Circuit jurisprudence allows for the introduction of \nevidence to negate the statute’s alleged rational basis in the context of this specific statute. (Doc. \n104, p. 9 (“[A]lthough rational basis review places no affirmative evidentiary burden on the \ngovernment,  plaintiffs  may  nonetheless  negate  a  seemingly  plausible  basis  for  the  law  by \n                                                            \n7 Abbott II was an appeal from a trial on the merits. Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 587-88. Currier was an appeal from a trial \nin which the district court granted a preliminary injunction. Currier, 760 F.3d at 451. And Lakey was an emergency \nmotion to stay the district court’s injunctions following a four day trial. Lakey, 769 F.3d at 289, 298. \n17 \n \n\nadducing evidence of irrationality.… [T]he State[‘s] … chosen means must rationally relate to \nthe state interests …. Our analysis does not proceed with abstraction for hypothesized ends[,] and \nmeans do not include post hoc hypothesized facts. Thus, we will examine the State[‘s] … \nrationale informed by the setting and history of the challenged rule.”) (quoting St. Joseph’s \nAbbey v. Castille, 712 F.3d 215, 233 (5th Cir. 2013), cert. denied, 134 S. Ct. 423 (2013))). \n  But in considering the similar Mississippi statute, the Court of Appeals in Currier held \nthat,  \n[O]ur court in Abbott [II] has addressed the rational basis of a virtually identical \nlaw, and we are bound by that precedent to accept that the Mississippi statute has \na rational basis.… [W]e … held that the Texas regulation satisfied a rational basis \nreview because it was based on the rational speculation that it would ‘assist in \npreventing patient abandonment’ by the doctor providing the abortion. We see no \nbasis for distinguishing the rational basis of [Mississippi] H.B. 1390. None of the \nother rationales discussed in Abbott [II] was state specific, and each would be \nequally applicable to H.B. 1390. Accordingly, we hold that H.B. 1390 satisfies the \nrational basis review upon our binding precedent in Abbott [II]. \n \nCurrier, 760 F.3d at 454 (footnote omitted).  \nThis Court is likewise bound by this precedent and therefore finds that Act 620 passes \nrational  basis  review.  Accordingly,  Defendant’s  Motion  for  Partial  Summary  Judgment  is \ngranted in part. The issue of medical reasonableness – as it pertains to the issue of Act 620’s \nrational review – is decided as a matter of law.  \n  Rational basis review, however, is only one part of the test for constitutionality. The \nstatute must not place an undue burden on a woman’s right to an abortion. “The undue burden \ninquiry looks to whether the challenged provision has either ‘the purpose or effect of placing a \nsubstantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus.’ If it does, it \nis unconstitutional.” Lakey, 769 F.3d at 294 (emphasis in original) (quoting Casey, 505 U.S. at \n877).  \n18 \n \n\n  Plaintiffs contend that the statute’s alleged medical unreasonableness is relevant to the \nundue burden question. (e.g., Doc. 104, pp. 10-11). They also argue that the statute’s purpose is \nan integral part of the undue burden analysis, that the purpose inquiry is fact sensitive and that it \nis  informed  by,  among  other  fact  issues,  the  question  of  whether  the  statute  is  medically \nnecessary or medically unreasonable. (Id.). Plaintiffs’ contested factual issues are listed in Doc. \n104-1, pp. 2-16. Plaintiffs also point the Court to the evidence attached to their opposition (a \nlisting of these exhibits is found at Doc. 104-2). \n  Defendant argues the issue of medical necessity is relevant only to the rational basis \ninquiry, which has been decided by Abbott II. (Doc. 87-1, p. 7). Further, Defendant contends that \nwhile “[t]he Fifth Circuit has not clarified the relationship between the rational basis inquiry and \nCasey’s purpose prong.… Abbott II’s statements on that issue are dicta.” (Doc 87-1, p. 18 and p. \n18, n.2). She argues that Abbott II’s holding that the admitting privileges statute furthered a \nlegitimate state interest is “highly relevant to whether the regulation has a valid purpose under \nCasey.” (Id.). In any event, Defendant points to the exhibits attached to its motion showing Act \n620’s legislative history (a listing of these exhibits is found at Doc. 87-1, p. 2). Defendant \ncontends that the Plaintiffs have not offered sufficient admissible evidence to raise a material \nissue of fact regarding any alleged improper purpose. (Doc. 107, pp. 7-11).  \n  In resolving these issues, the Court is required to follow the test set out in Abbott II, \nCurrier and Lakey. While Plaintiffs urge this Court to apply the undue burden balancing test \nused by other circuits in such cases as Planned Parenthood Ariz., Inc. v. Humble, 753 F.3d 905, \n914 (9th Cir. 2014), Planned Parenthood of Wisc., Inc. v. Van Hollen, 783 F.3d 786, 791-99 (7th \nCir. 2013), Planned Parenthood Se, Inc. v. Strange, 33 F. Supp. 3d 1330, 1338-39 (2014), Lakey \nspecifically rejected this test. Lakey, 769 F.3d  296-97, 305. Applying the Fifth Circuit test, the \n19 \n \n\nCourt finds that there are questions of material fact which preclude granting Defendant’s Motion \nfor Partial Summary Judgment in its entirety.  \n  Abbott II instructs that the rational basis review is conducted without evidence. Abbott II, \n748 F.3d at 596 (“[T]here is ‘never a role for evidentiary proceedings’ under rational basis \nreview.”) (quoting  Nat’l Paint & Coatings Ass’n v. City of Chicago, 45 F.3d 1124, 1127 (7th \nCir. 1995)).8 “[L]egislative choice is not subject to courtroom fact-finding.” Abbott II, 748 F.3d \nat 594 (quoting F.C.C. v. Beach Commc’ns, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 315, (1993)). While the Court \nagrees with the Defendant that there may be some lack of clarity in the Fifth Circuit’s view of the \nrelationship between the rational basis and purpose prong of the test, it is clear that the Fifth \nCircuit treats these prongs separately and that, as to the latter, proof is allowed and, indeed, \nrequired.  \n  After having held that Texas H.B. 2 was rationally related to a legitimate state interest, \nthe Lakey Court then turned to the separate and distinct “purpose inquiry.” Lakey, 769 F.3d at \n294.  It is instructive to this Court that Lakey did not consider its holding that the statute passed \nrational basis review as dispositive of whether the statute had a legitimate purpose under Casey. \nIndeed, in evaluating the possible undue burden of the ambulatory surgical center requirement, \nthe Court separately considered “purpose” and “effect,” first making the “purpose inquiry.” Id. In \nreversing the district court, the Fifth Circuit emphasized that the district court “cited no record \nevidence  to  support  its  determination  that  [this]  provision  was  enacted  for  the  purpose  of \nimposing an undue burden on women seeking abortions, nor did it make any factual finding \nregarding an improper purpose.” Id. at 294-95 (emphasis added).  \n                                                            \n8 It is interesting, however, that the Court pointed to testimony and other evidence introduced at the trial to bolster \nits conclusion that the thirty mile geographic restriction requirement passed rational review. Abbott II, 748 F.3d at \n595-96 (“There is sufficient evidence here that the geographic restriction has a rational basis.”). \n20 \n \n\n  Abbott II also separated the purpose prong of the undue burden test from the rational \nbasis review. It noted that “plaintiffs offered no evidence implying that the State enacted the \nadmitting privileges provision in order to limit abortions; in fact, as their reply brief states, they \ndid not attack the State’s purpose at all.” Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 597. \n  This Court draws three conclusions from the approach taken in Abbott II and Lakey to the \npurpose inquiry: first, that the purpose inquiry is separate and distinct from the rational basis \nreview; second, the fact that a statute passes the rational basis review does not, by itself, answer \nthe question of whether it has a legitimate purpose for purposes of measuring undue burden; and \nfinally, the purpose inquiry is fact sensitive and a plaintiff challenging a statute on this basis \nmust offer evidence in order to prevail. The question here is whether the evidence offered by \nPlaintiffs in opposition to Defendant’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is sufficient to \nraise issues of material fact so as to require the denial of the motion. This begs the question of \nwhat kind of evidence the Court can consider for purposes of the present motion and the \npreliminary injunction hearing.  \n  In answering this question, we get little help from Abbott II, Lakey and Currier. In Lakey, \nthe Court found that as to the ASC requirement, Plaintiffs had offered no evidence on the \npurpose issue. Lakey, 769 F.3d at 299, n.15. As to the admitting privileges provision, the Lakey \nCourt did not separately consider the purpose inquiry but, in evaluating the evidence introduced \nat  preliminary  injunction  trial,  found  that  the  State  was  likely  to  ultimately  win  on  both \nrequirements as to the McAllen clinic but not as to the El Paso clinic. Id. at 303-04.  In Currier, \n“[t]he district court did not reach the purpose inquiry, and the parties [did] not address it [on \nappeal].” Currier, 760 F.3d at 455. In Abbott II, the Court found that “plaintiffs offered no \nevidence implying that the State enacted the admitting privileges provision in order to limit \n21 \n \n\nabortions; in fact, as their reply brief states, they did not attack the State’s purpose at all.” Abbott \nII, 748 F.3d at 597. All three decisions were rendered not at the summary judgment stage, as in \nthe present case, but after a preliminary injunction trial where testimony and evidence were \npresented and weighed by the district court. \n  Defendant concedes that the Fifth Circuit “has not clarified the relationship between the \nrational basis inquiry and Casey’s purpose prong” (Doc. 87-1, p. 18), but argues that in finding \nthat Act 620 furthers a legitimate state interest, Abbott II has answered the purpose inquiry and \nfinally determined that the statute has a valid purpose (Id. at pp. 13, 17-18). To the extent that the \npurpose inquiry has not already been decided by Abbott II, Defendant contends in the alternative \nthat  the  only  relevant  evidence  of  the  statute’s  purpose  is  the  language  of  the  statute,  its \nlegislative history and its furtherance of a legitimate state interest, (Id. at pp. 19-22) and that \nevidence offered by Plaintiffs to show an improper purpose is irrelevant or, at the very least, \ninsufficient, to overcome Act 620’s legislative text and history for purposes of the summary \njudgment motion. (Id. at pp. 9-13, 22-24). \n  Plaintiffs  argue  that  the  Court  must  consider  the  following  kinds  of  evidence  in \ndetermining whether Act 620's purpose is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman \nseeking an abortion: 1) evidence that the Act will have the effect of creating this substantial \nobstacle (i.e. evidence of its effect is relevant to its purpose) (Doc. 104, p. 14); 2) evidence of the \nlack of medical necessity of Act 620, the Plaintiffs again arguing that this informs the question of \nthe  Act’s  effect  and  purpose  (Doc.  104,  pp.  10-11,  23);  and  3)  evidence  regarding  the \ncircumstances of the Act 620's creation and passage. (Doc. 104, pp. 22-23) \n  In deciding the scope of evidence which is relevant to the purpose (as well as the effect) \nprong of the undue burden summary judgment analysis, this Court is bound by this circuit’s \n22 \n \n\nrejection of the undue burden balancing test used by other circuits. Lakey, 769 F.3d at 296-97, \n305. Therefore, this Court follows only the test set forth in Abbott II, Currier and Lakey.  \n  In her Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, Defendant does not challenge the right of \nPlaintiffs to offer evidence on the “effect” prong of the undue burden analysis. Therefore, the \neffect of Act 620 will clearly be an issue at the trial of the preliminary injunction, and evidence \non the issue of the Act’s effects, if any, on a woman’s right to an abortion will be admissible and, \nindeed, extremely important to the outcome of the trial. That inquiry will necessarily be fact \nspecific to Louisiana, and this Court will obviously not be bound by any factual findings on how \nthe similar statutes in Texas and Mississippi affected the women in those states. Clearly, the \nfactual differences on this question can lead to very different legal results on the constitutional \nquestion. Compare Abbott II, 748 F.3d 583 and Lakey, 769 F.3d 285 with Currier, 760 F.3d 488.  \n  And while Defendant argues that the “purpose inquiry” is foreclosed or, at the very least, \nthe evidence on this issue should be limited to the statute’s text and legislative history, the Court \nagrees with the Plaintiffs that other kinds of evidence may also inform this inquiry. In Okpalobi \nv. Foster, 190 F.3d 337, 337, 354-56 (5th Cir. 1999), superseded on other grounds on rehearing \nen banc, 244 F.3d 405 (5th Cir. 2001), the Court addressed the issue of the “type of inquiry lower \ncourts should undertake to determine whether a regulation has the ‘purpose’ of imposing an \nundue burden on a woman’s right to seek an abortion.” Okpalobi, 190 F.3d at 354. The Court \nfound that a district court is “not to accept the government’s proffered purpose if it is a mere \n‘sham.’” Id. (quoting Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578, 586-87 (1987)), and can look to \n“various types of evidence, including the language of the challenged act, its legislative history,  \n23 \n \n\nthe social and historical context of the legislation, or other legislation concerning the same \nsubject matter as the challenged measure.” Id.9 \nFurthermore, evidence of the effect of the statute is relevant not only to the “effect \nprong,” but also relevant, albeit indirectly, to the purpose inquiry. If for instance, after hearing \nthe evidence, this Court concludes that the effect of Act 620 produces no undue burden, this \nfinding would not necessarily be dispositive of whether the Act’s purpose is legitimate. This \nfinding, however, would certainly be relevant and support the argument that there was no \nimproper purpose. The converse is also true.  Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of \nHialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 535, 113 S. Ct. 2217 (1993) (“[T]he effect of a law in its real operation is \nstrong evidence of its object.”). \n  The same rationale applies with respect to  evidence  of  the  alleged  lack  of  medical \nreasonableness of the admitting privileges requirement. If after hearing evidence on this issue, \nthis Court were to conclude as a matter of fact that the admitting privileges requirement is \nmedically  reasonable,  this  finding  would  certainly  inform  and  support  (albeit  indirectly)  a \nfinding that the statute has a legitimate purpose. And the converse is also true.10 \nThe Court in Abbott II discussed evidence presented by the State to the Texas Legislature \nand at trial in support of the State’s argument that the admitting privileges requirement was \nmedically reasonable. Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 594-95. But this evidence was considered by the \nCourt in the context of its rational basis inquiry which asks only whether the law, “‘based on \nrational speculation[,]  unsupported by evidence or empirical data[,]’ satisfies rational basis \n                                                            \n9 See also, Roy G. Speece, Jr., The Purpose Prong of Casey’s Undue Burden Test and Its Impact on the \nConstitutionality of Abortion Insurance Restrictions in the Affordable Care Act Or Its Progeny, 33 Whittier L. Rev. \n77, 99, where, reviewing Okpalobi and other cases, the author lists a “broad array of factors” considered by courts to \ndetermine purpose, including “a bill’s social and historical context.” \n \n10 The Court again emphasizes that it finds these matters relevant not for purposes of weighing the severity of the \nobstacle against the state’s justification for passing the law, but rather, as bearing simply on the question of the \nstatute’s purpose. \n24 \n \n\nreview.” Id. at 594 (emphasis added). Given the Abbott II Court’s emphatic insistence that “there \nis never a role for evidentiary proceedings under rational basis review,” its finding relative to \nmedical reasonableness in the context of rational review does not foreclose this Court’s fact \nbased examination of this issue for the separate and distinct “purpose inquiry.”  \nOn this issue of purpose, like the issue of effect, the parties have attached evidence to the \nmotion and opposing memoranda which points in very different directions. For this reason, the \nCourt finds that there are material issues of fact as to the statute’s purpose as it relates to the \nundue burden inquiry. There are also issues of fact as to the Act’s medical reasonableness as it \nrelates to the purpose and effect prongs of the undue burden test. Therefore, summary judgment \non the issue of purpose and medical reasonableness, as it pertains to both the purpose and effect \nprongs of the undue burden test, is inappropriate and is denied. \nV.  Conclusion \nAccordingly,  \nIT IS ORDERED that the Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Defendants Kathy \nKliebert, is GRANTED IN PART. The Court finds as a matter of law that Act 620 is rationally \nrelated to a legitimate State interest; and therefore, Defendant’s Motion for Partial Summary \nJudgment to eliminate Plaintiffs’ claim of Act 620’s medical unreasonableness as it pertains to \nAct  620’s  rational  basis  review  is  GRANTED.  Defendant’s  Motion  for  Partial  Summary \nJudgment is in all other respects DENIED.  \n  Signed in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on May 12, 2015. \n   S \n \nJUDGE JOHN W. deGRAVELLES \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nMIDDLE DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA \n25 \n ",

Introduction\nBefore the Court is Plaintiffs’ Application for Temporary Restraining Order and Motion\nfor Preliminary Injunction (“Application”), filed by five persons: June Medical Services LLC,\nd/b/a Hope Medical Group for Women (“Hope” or “Hope Clinic); Bossier City Medical Suite\n(“Bossier” or “Bossier Clinic”); Choice Inc., of Texas, d/b/a Causeway Medical Clinic (“Choice”\nor “Causeway”) (collectively, “Plaintiff Clinics”); including two natural persons, Doctor Doe 1\n(“Doe 1”)1 and Doctor Doe 2 (“Doe 2”) (collectively, “Plaintiff Doctors”) (collectively,\n“Plaintiffs”). (Doc. 5.) The Application sought to bar enforcement of Section A(2)(a) of Act\nNumber 620 (“Act” or “Act 620”),2 amending Louisiana Revised Statutes § 40:1299.35.2.3\nAlthough Plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction in this\nsingle document, this Court issued the requested temporary order on August 31, 2014, and\ndeferred ruling on their conjoined motion for a preliminary injunction (“TRO”), (Doc. 31 at 1–2),\na distinction subsequently clarified by this Court’s later order, (Docs. 57, 84). This Ruling and\n1 The identities of the Plaintiff Doctors as well as the other Louisiana abortion physicians\nwho are not parties–Doctors Doe 3, 4, 5, and 6 (individually, “Doe 3,” “Doe 4,” “Doe 5,” “Doe\n6”)–are protected by virtue of two protective orders. (Docs. 24, 55.) Rather than repeating the\nformulation “Dr. Doe [],” this Court opts for the simpler “Doe []” and, only occasionally, “Dr.\nDoe [].”\n2 A copy of the final bill appears as a joint exhibit, (JX 115), and in other filings, (See,\ne.g., Doc. 168-10 at 39–43). As the statute was subsequently codified, and as a statute’s language\nneed not be evidenced to be known, this Court will cite to Act 620 as codified. See infra note 3.\nThe Court does so throughout this opinion unless it is recounting, as it later does, see infra Part\nVI, Act 620’s pre-enactment’s history.\n3 In this Ruling, any and all references to “Section []” or “§ []” are to Act 620 as codified\nin Louisiana Revised Statutes. Act 620 also amended Sections 1299.35.2.1 and 2175.3(2) and\n(5). See infra Part VI.\n5 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 6 of 112\nOrder (“Ruling”) now addresses this latter request (“Motion for Preliminary Injunction”). Also\nbefore the Court is Defendant’s Motion to Reconsider Rulings on Summary Judgment and Motion\nin Limine (“Motion for Reconsideration”), (Doc. 144), filed by Ms. Kathy Kliebert (“Defendant,”\n“Kliebert,” “Secretary,” or “Secretary Kliebert”), who is being sued by Plaintiffs in her official\ncapacity as then Secretary of Department of Health and Hospitals of the State of Louisiana\n(“DHH”).4 \nThe hearing on the Motion for Preliminary Injunction was held from June 22, 2015,\nthrough June 29, 2015. (Docs. 163–64, 166, 169, 174.) At the hearing, the Court received\nevidence in the form of live witness testimony, exhibits, stipulations, and designated deposition\ntestimony agreed by Plaintiffs and Defendant (collectively, “Parties”) to be received in lieu of\ncertain witness’ live testimony.  Plaintiffs presented live testimony from the following witnesses:\n- Doe 1;\n- Doe 2;\n- Doe 3; \n- Ms. Kathaleen Pittman (“Pittman”), June’s administrator; and\n- Kliebert; and\n- Three experts, specifically: \n- Doctor Christopher M. Estes (“Estes”), Chief Medical Officer of Planned\nParenthood of South Florida and the Treasure Coast, (PX 92);\n4 As permitted by precedent, Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 152, 28 S. Ct. 441, 451, 52 L.\nEd. 714 (1908); accord Guillemard-Ginorio v. Contreras-Gomez, 585 F.3d 508, 530 n.24 (1st\nCir. 2009), Plaintiffs sue for injunctive relief against Kliebert in her official capacity, (Doc. 1 at\n5). To wit, the true defendant here is Louisiana, not Kliebert or even DHH. See Will v. Mich.\nDep’t of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S. Ct. 2304, 2312, 105 L. Ed. 2d 45 (1989).\n6 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 7 of 112\n- Doctor Sheila Katz (“Katz”), an assistant professor at the University of\nHouston, (JX 91); and \n- Doctor Eva Karen Pressman (“Pressman”), the Henry A. Thiede Professor\nand Chair of The Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at The\nUniversity of Rochester, (PX 94).\nDefendant presented live testimony at trial from the following witnesses:\n- Ms. Cecile Castello (“Castello”), Director of Health Standards Section (“HSS”) for\nDHH; and\n- Three other experts, specifically: \n- Doctor Robert Marier (“Marier”), Chairman of the Department of Hospital\nMedicine at Ochsner Medical Center in New Orleans, (DX 146);\n- Doctor Tumulesh Kumar Singh Solanky (“Solanky”), a professor and the\nchair of the Mathematics Department at the University of New Orleans,\n(DX 148); and\n- Doctor Damon Thomas Cudihy (“Cudihy”), an obstetrician-gynaecologist\n(“OB/GYN,” “Ob/Gyn,” “OBG,” or “O&G”) currently licensed to practice\nmedicine in Louisiana and Texas, (DX 147). \nA record of the exhibits admitted into evidence was filed. (Doc. 165.) A record of the deposition\ntestimony designated by the Parties and offered into evidence was also docketed. (Doc. 168.5) In\n5 Cochran’s deposition appears in Document 168-4, Doe 4’s in Document 168-5, Doe 5’s\nin Document 168-6, Ms. Hedra Dubea’s in Document 168-7, Mr. Robert Gross’ in Document\n168-8, Ms. Dora Kane’s in Document 168-9, Doctor Cecilia Mouton’s in Document 168-10, and\nMs. Jennifer Christine Stevens in Document 168-11. \n7 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 8 of 112\naddition, the Parties submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, (Docs. 196,\n200), and responses to each other’s proposed findings and conclusions, (Docs. 201, 202). \nIn making the following findings of fact and conclusions of law, the Court has considered\nthe record as a whole. The Court has observed the demeanor of witnesses and has carefully\nweighed their testimony and credibility in determining the facts of this case and drawing\nconclusions from those facts. All findings of fact contained herein that are more appropriately\nconsidered conclusions of law are to be so deemed.6 Likewise, any conclusions of law more\nappropriately considered a finding of fact shall be so classified.7\nAfter having considered the evidence, briefing, and record as a whole, for the reasons\nwhich follow, Defendant’s Motion for Reconsideration, (Doc. 144), is DENIED. The active\nadmitting privileges requirement of Section A(2)(a) of Act 620 is found to be a violation of the\nsubstantive due process right of Louisiana women to obtain an abortion, a right guaranteed by the\nFourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution as established in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S.\n113, 93 S. Ct. 705, 35 L. Ed. 2d 147 (1973) (“Roe”), and pursuant to the test first set forth in\nPlanned Parenthood of Se. Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 112 S. Ct. 2791, 120 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1992)\n(“Casey”), and subsequently refined by the Fifth Circuit, see infra Part XI. Act 620 is therefore\ndeclared unconstitutional, its enforcement constitutionally barred. As such, the Motion for\nPreliminary Injunction is GRANTED IN PART, and any enforcement of § 40:1299.35.2 is\nenjoined as to Does 1 and 2, Hope, Bossier, and Causeway. \n6 For an example of such an approach, see Doc. 14021, No. 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS\n(E.D. La. Jan. 15, 2015).  \n7 Id.\n8 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 9 of 112\nFurthermore, because applications for “active admitting privileges”8 by several doctors\ntechnically remain “pending,” the Court orders Plaintiffs to provide to the Court and Defendant\nwith a written notification of any changes in the status of these applications on a monthly basis,\nbeginning on March 1, 2016. Should the status of any application change, the Parties are free to\nrequest any other relief that they may deem appropriate. Finally, so as to discuss any outstanding\nissues and schedule this case’s course, the Court will hold a telephonic status conference with\ncounsel for all Parties on January 29, 2016, at 11:30 a.m.\n \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nII.  Background and Procedural History\n1.  Plaintiffs are: \n- Hope, a licensed abortion clinic located in Shreveport, Louisiana, suing on behalf\nof its physicians, staff and patients; \n- Bossier, a licensed abortion clinic located in Bossier City, Louisiana, suing on\nbehalf of its physicians, staff, and patients;\n- Choice, a licensed abortion clinic suing on behalf of its physicians, staff, and\npatients; \n- Doe 1, a physician licensed to practice medicine in the State of Louisiana and\nboard-certified in Family Medicine and Addiction Medicine, suing on his own\nbehalf and that of his patients; and\n- Doe 2, a physician licensed to practice medicine in the State of Louisiana and\n8 For a definition of this term, see infra Part V.D.\n9 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 10 of 112\nboard-certified in OB/GYN, suing on his own behalf and that of his patients.\n2. Kliebert, the Secretary of DHH.9 Pursuant to § 40:2175.6, Kliebert “has the authority to\nrevoke or deny clinics’ licenses for violation of this or any other law.”(Doc. 109 at 5 (citing LA.\nR.S. § 40:2175.6).)10 \n3. On August 22, 2014, Plaintiffs filed the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive\nRelief, (Doc. 1), and the Application, (Doc. 5), seeking to enjoin various defendants from\nenforcing Act 620’s Section (A)(2)(a). (Doc. 5-2 at 2–5.) \n4. Act 620 has been codified at an amended Section 40:1299.35.2. LA. R.S. §\n40:1299.35.2. Section A(2)(a) requires every doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana to have\n“active admitting privileges” at a hospital within 30 miles of the facility where abortions are\nperformed. Id. § 40:1299.35.2A(2)(a). While the Act contains other requirements, this provision\nis the only one being challenged. (Doc 5-1 at 8 n.1.) Act 620 was signed into law by the Governor\n9  In the original Complaint, Plaintiffs sued Mr. James David Caldwell (“Caldwell”) in\nhis official capacity as Louisiana’s Attorney General and Doctor Jimmy Guidry (“Guidry”) in\nhis official capacity as the State Health Officer of Louisiana and Medical Director of DHH.\n(Doc. 1 at 1.) The Court dismissed both Caldwell and Guidry. (Doc. 31.) Kliebert was added as a\ndefendant in an Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. (Doc. 14.)  Doctor\nMark Henry Dawson, President of the Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners (“Board”),\nwas sued because Act 620 purports to make the Board an enforcement arm of the Act. LA. R.S. §\n40:1299.35.2.1(E). In addition, the Board has the authority to take disciplinary action against any\nphysician, LA. R.S. § 37:1263 et seq. (Doc. 109 at 6.)  However, Dawson was subsequently\ndismissed at the Parties’ joint request. (Docs. 110, 111.) As a part of the joint motion, the Board\nagreed to be bound by any injunction issued by the Court regarding Act 620. (Doc. 110 ¶ 1(b) at\n1.) \n10 In accordance with The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation, the documents filed\nin this case’s docket, but not later submitted as exhibits at the June hearing, will be cited by\ndocument number alone, e.g. Doc. 109. Conversely, the evidence introduced by the Parties,\neither individually or jointly, as exhibits will be identified by their precise exhibit number even if\nlater filed as a document on this case’s docket, see Doc. 196. For example, joint exhibit 10 will\nbe cited as “JX 10,” Defendant’s exhibit five as “DX 5,” and Plaintiffs’ exhibit six as “PX 6.” \n10 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 11 of 112\nof Louisiana, the Honorable Piyush “Bobby” Jindal (“Jindal” or “Governor”), on June 12, 2014.\n(Doc. 138 at 2; see also, e.g., H.B. 388, 2014 Leg., Reg. Sess. (La. 2014) (signed by Governor,\nJune 12, 2014).) Its effective date was set as September 1, 2014. (See, e.g., Doc. 5-1 at 8; Doc.\n5-2 at 6.)\n5. Hope, Bossier, and Choice are three of five licensed abortion clinics in\nLouisiana. (See, e.g., Doc. 109 at 4–5; Doc. 14 ¶ 10 at 3.) They are located in Shreveport, Bossier\nCity, and Metairie, respectively.  (Doc. 109 at 4–5; see also, e.g., Doc. 14 ¶¶ 11–13 at 3–4.) Does\n1 and 2 are two of six physicians performing abortions in Louisiana. (Doc. 109 at 5; see also, e.g.,\nDoc. 14  ¶¶ 14–15 at 4.) Doe 1 performs abortions at Hope; Doe 2 performs abortions at Bossier\nand Choice. (Doc. 109 at 5; see also, e.g., Doc. 14  ¶¶ 14–15 at 4.) \n6. The Court issued the TRO on August 31, 2014, enjoining enforcement of Act 620 “until\na hearing is held for the purpose of determining whether a preliminary injunction should issue.”\n(Doc. 31 at 18.) Per this order, Plaintiffs were expected to continue seeking admitting privileges\nat the relevant hospitals. (Id. at 1–2.) Thus, the Act would be allowed to take effect, but the\nPlaintiffs would not be subject to its  penalties and sanctions for practicing without the relevant\nadmitting privileges during the application process. (Id. at 2, 18.) The Plaintiff Clinics were\nallowed to operate lawfully while the Plaintiff Doctors continued their efforts to obtain privileges.\n(Id.) \n7. On September 19, 2014, three other plaintiffs–Women’s Health Care Center, Inc.\n(“Women’s Health” or “Women’s Clinic”); Delta Clinic of Baton Rouge, Inc. (“Delta”); Doctor\nJohn Doe 5 (“Doe 5”); and Doctor John Doe 6 (“Doe 6”) (collectively, “Women’s Health\nPlaintiffs”)–filed the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, thereby initiating a\n11 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 12 of 112\nseparate case, and a Motion for Preliminary Injunction. (Docs. 1, 5, No.  3:14-cv-00597-JWD-\nRLB.) On that same day, these parties tendered a motion to consolidate their case with this earlier\nproceeding. (Doc. 2, No. 3:14-cv-00597-JWD-RLB.) By this Court’s order, these two cases were\nconsolidated on September 24, 2014. (Doc. 8, No. 3:14-cv-00597-JWD-RLB.)\n8. All the Parties agreed in briefs and orally at a status conference held on September 30,\n2014, that significant discovery would need to be done to prepare for the hearing; therefore, the\nCourt set the preliminary injunction hearing for March 30, 2015. (Doc. 45.) A Joint Proposed\nScheduling Order was submitted by the Parties on October 8, 2014, (Doc. 49), and adopted as this\nCourt’s order on October 21, 2014, (Doc. 56).\n9. On November 3, 2014, following the addition of the Women’s Health Plaintiffs, this\nCourt issued the Order Clarifying Temporary Restraining Order of August 31, 2014. (Doc. 57.)\nFor the reasons given therein, the Court ruled: “It was and is the intention of this Court\nthat the TRO remain in effect as to all parties before it until the end of the Preliminary Injunction\nHearing.” (Id. at 6.)\n10. On December 5, 2014, the Women’s Health Plaintiffs filed the Motion for Voluntary\nDismissal. (Doc. 70.) With the consent of the Parties, the Court dismissed this suit\nwithout prejudice on December 14, 2014. (Doc. 77.) In light of that dismissal, the Court on\nJanuary 15, 2015, issued the Second Order Clarifying Temporary Restraining Order of August 31,\n2014. (Doc. 84.) In this order, for reasons explained therein, this Court ruled that “the TRO of\nAugust 31, 2014 (Doc. 31) remains in force until the Preliminary Injunction hearing on March 30,\n2015 or as otherwise modified by this Court.” (Id. at 4.) \n11. On February 16, 2015, Defendants filed the Motion for Partial Summary\n12 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 13 of 112\nJudgment (“Partial MSJ”), (Doc. 87), which was opposed, (Doc. 104). On February 24, 2015,\nDefendants filed an Unopposed Motion to Set Oral Argument on Motion for Partial Summary\nJudgment (Doc. 90.) On March 3, 2015, the Court granted that motion, (Doc. 92), and oral\nargument was set and heard on March 19, 2015, (Docs. 128, 137). \n12. On May 12, 2015, the Partial MSJ was granted in part, finding that under binding Fifth\nCircuit jurisprudence, the admitting privileges requirement of Act 620 is rationally related to a\nlegitimate State interest. (Doc. 138 at 125.) In all other respects, the motion was denied. (Id.)\n13. Based on a stipulation reached among the Parties, the Joint Motion to Dismiss\nDefendant Mark Dawson was filed on March 17, 2015, (Doc. 110), and granted the same day,\n(Doc. 111). On March 20, 2015, the Parties conferred with the Court and agreed to a continuance\nof the hearing on the preliminary injunction until the week of June 22, 2015. (Doc. 129.) The\nParties agreed that the TRO would remain in effect until the completion of the trial and ruling on\nthe merits of the preliminary injunction. (Id.)\n14. On April 1, 2015, oral argument was heard on motions in limine filed by the Parties.\n(Docs. 136, 151.) In the ruling issued that same day, the Court denied Plaintiffs’ Motion in\nLimine to Preclude Expert Testimony of Dr. Tumulesh Solanky, (Doc. 96), and Defendant’s\nMotion to Exclude Expert Testimony of Sheila Katz, Ph.D., (Doc. 99). (Doc. 136.) Plaintiffs’\nMotion in Limine to Preclude Expert Testimony of Dr. McMillan, (Doc. 97), was denied as moot.\n(Doc. 136.) Because of their connection to the Partial MSJ, Defendant’s Motion in Limine to\nExclude Irrelevant Evidence (“Defendant’s Motion in Limine”), (Doc. 95), and Plaintiffs’ Motion\nin Limine to Preclude Evidence of DHH Deficiency Reports and Related Evidence, (Doc. 98),\nwere taken under advisement. (Doc. 136.) These two motions were ultimately denied. (Docs. 139,\n13 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 14 of 112\n140.)\n15. On June 11, 2015, Defendant filed the Motion to Reconsider Rulings on Summary\nJudgment and Motion in Limine. (Doc. 144.) Plaintiffs submitted their response in opposition on\nJune 16, 2015. (Doc. 150.) Because this was submitted for consideration only six days before\ntrial, the motion was taken under advisement and deferred to trial. \n16. Trial on the Motion for Preliminary Injunction began on June 22, 2015, and ended on\nJune 29, 2015. (Docs. 163, 164, 166–69, 174). The Redacted Transcript11 of the trial was later\ndocketed.12 (Docs. 190–95.)  \nIII. Contentions of the Parties\n17. In broad terms,13 Plaintiffs contend that Act 620 is facially14 unconstitutional first,\nbecause the Act places an undue burden on the right of Louisiana women seeking an abortion by\n11 The unredacted transcript was sealed on the joint motion of the Parties. (Doc. 183.) \n12 Each of the six volumes of testimony corresponds to the trial day in which the evidence\nwas  received: Document 190 is Volume I, June 22; Document 191 is Volume II, June 23;\nDocument 192 is Volume III, June 24; Document 193 is Volume IV, June 25; Document 194 is\nVolume V, June 26; and Document 195 are Volume VI, June 29. Document 190 (or Volume I)\ncontains the testimony of Pittman, Doe 3, and Estes; Document 191 (or Volume II), that of Doe\n2, Katz, and Kliebert; Document 192 (or Volume III), that of Doe 1 and Castello; Document 193\n(or Volume IV), that of Marier and Solanky; Document 194 (or Volume V), that of Cudihy;\nDocument 195 (or volume VI), that of Pressman. \n13 The Parties’ specific contentions underlying these broad positions are discussed in\nconnection with the individual issues to which they are relevant.  \n14 Plaintiffs state emphatically that they are not making an “as-applied” challenge and\nthat their only challenge is facial. (Doc. 202 at 53.) \n14 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 15 of 112\nplacing substantial obstacles in their path, (See, e.g., Doc. 202 at 46–53);15 second, because the\npurpose of the Act is to create those obstacles, (See, e.g., id. at 53–58) and third, because Act 620\ndoes not further a valid state interest, (See, e.g., id. at 58–65). \n18. Plaintiffs argue that a preliminary injunction should issue enjoining the enforcement of\nAct 620 because Plaintiffs are likely to succeed at trial, (Doc. 196 at 67–85); absent an injunction,\nirreparable harm will occur, (Id. at 85–86); the balance of hardships weighs in Plaintiffs’ favor,\n(Id. at 86–87); and finally, granting the preliminary injunction will not adversely affect the public\ninterest, (Id.).\n19. Defendant counters broadly that Act 620 places no substantial burden on a woman’s\nright to seek an abortion in Louisiana, (See, e.g., Doc. 200 at 59–66), and that the Act serves a\nvalid purpose, (See, e.g., id. at 66–74). Further, Defendant argues that this Court has already ruled\nthat Act 620 serves a valid state interest and has a rational basis. (See, e.g., id. at 6–7.) \n20. Defendant argues that Plaintiffs have failed to carry their burden that they are likely to\nsucceed at trial and further, urge that no irreparable harm will occur by allowing the enforcement\nof Act 620. (See, e.g., id. at 88–90.)\n21. Finally, Defendant contends that the balance of hardships weighs in her favor and that\nthe enforcement of Act 620 will not adversely affect the public interest.

The Factual Issues\n22. Four main issues of fact were tried at the June hearing: \n(A) What is the purpose of Act 620? \n(B) Is Act 620 medically necessary and reasonable? \n(C) How, if at all, will the implementation of Act 620 affect the physicians and clinics\nwho perform abortions in the state of Louisiana? \n(D) How, if at all, will the implementation of Act 620 affect the ability of Louisiana\nwomen to obtain an abortion? \n23. Whether these factual issues and their resolution are relevant under the applicable\nlegal standard, and whether they play a role in this Court’s ruling, is discussed in the Conclusions\nof Law section. See infra Parts XI–XII.\nV. Abortion in Louisiana\nA. Generally\n24. According to DHH, approximately 10,000 women obtain abortions in Louisiana\nannually. (DX 148 ¶ 11.) \n25. Nationally, approximately 42% of women who have abortions fall below the federal\npoverty level, and another 27% fall below 200% of that level. (JX 124 at 480; Doc. 191 at\n190–91.)16 That number is likely significantly higher for Louisiana women seeking abortions.\n(Id.) The expert and lay testimony on this issue are consistent. (See, e.g., Doc. 190 at 34\n16 The Court accepted Katz as an expert in the sociology of gender and the sociology of\npoverty. (Doc. 191 at 123–26.) The Court found Katz well qualified and credible.\n16 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 17 of 112\n(Testimony of Pittman) (testifying that 70% to 90% of patients at Hope are below the federal\npoverty level).)\n26. Under Louisiana law, a patient must receive state-mandated counseling and an\nultrasound at least 24 hours before an abortion. (JX 109 ¶ 18; JX 116 ¶ 11; JX 117 ¶ 8.) \n27. Due to this notification and waiting period, patients who wish to obtain an abortion\nmust make two trips to the clinic: the first to receive the ultrasound and state-mandated\ncounseling, and the second to obtain the sought abortion. (JX 109 ¶ 19.) \nB. The Clinics\n28. There are currently five women’s reproductive health clinics in Louisiana that provide\nabortion services. (E.g., Doc. 109 at 4; JX 109 ¶ 13.)\n(1) Hope\n29. Hope is a women’s reproductive health clinic located in Shreveport, Louisiana, that\nhas been operating since 1980 and offers abortion services. (Doc. 109 at 4; see also  Doc. 14 ¶ 11\nat 5.) Hope is a licensed abortion clinic suing on its own behalf and on behalf of its physicians,\nstaff and patients. (Doc. 14 ¶ 11 at 5; Doc. 190 at 14.)\n30. Hope provides medication abortions through eight weeks and surgical abortions\nthrough 16 weeks, six days LMP.17 (Doc. 190 at 35, 119, 132.) Hope employs two doctors who\nperform abortions, Does 1 and 3. (Id. at 21.) Doe 1 performs approximately 71% of the abortions\n17 Throughout this opinion, the Court will define the length of pregnancy based on the\ntime elapsed since the first day of a woman’s last menstrual period, or LMP.\n17 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 18 of 112\nprovided by Hope, and Doe 3 performs the remaining 29%. (Doc. 190 at 21; JX 116 ¶ 5.) \n31. 69% of Hope’s patients are Louisiana residents, but the remainder travel from outside\nthe state to Hope. (JX, 116 ¶ 10; Doc. 190 at 19, 34.)\n(2) Bossier\n32. Bossier is a women’s reproductive health clinic that has been operating in Bossier City\nsince 1980 and provides first and second trimester abortions. (Doc. 109 at 4; Doc. 14 ¶ 12.)\nBossier is a licensed abortion clinic and a plaintiff suing on its own behalf and on behalf of its\nphysicians, staff, and patients. (Doc. 14 ¶ 12.) \n33. Bossier provides medication abortions through eight weeks and surgical abortions\nthrough the state’s legal limit of 21 weeks, six days LMP. (Doc. 191 at 22–23, 55–56; JX 117 ¶\n4.)\n34. Bossier employs one doctor, Doe 2, who performs first and second trimester surgical\nprocedures as well as medication abortions. (Doc. 191 at 21; JX 117 ¶ 5.) Doe 2 is the only doctor\nin Louisiana who performs abortions after 16 weeks, six days LMP. (JX 187 ¶ 4; Doc. 191 at\n21–22.)18 \n35. Bossier’s patients are primarily from Louisiana, but also travel to the clinic from\nsurrounding states. (Doc. 191 at 20.) \n18  There is testimony that Doe 5 has also performed abortions up to 18 weeks although it\nis unclear whether he is referring to the present or what he has done in the past. (Doc. 168-6 at\n7–8.) The resolution of this issue is not critical to the Court’s ruling. \n18 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 19 of 112\n(3) Causeway\n36. Causeway is a women’s reproductive health clinic located in Metairie, Louisiana, and\nhas provided abortion and reproductive health services since 1999. (Doc. 109 at 2–5; Doc. 14 ¶\n13.) Causeway is a licensed abortion clinic suing on its own behalf and that of its physicians,\nstaff, and patients. (Doc. 14 ¶ 14). \n37. Causeway offers surgical abortions through 21 weeks, six days LMP, and does not\noffer medication abortions. (JX 117 ¶ 4.) \n38. Causeway employs two doctors who perform abortions, Does 2 and 4. (See, e.g., Doc.\n168-5 at 8.) Doe 2 performs approximately 25% of the abortions provided at Causeway, and Doe\n4 performs the remaining 75%. (JX 117 ¶ 5.) \n(4) Women’s Health\n39. Women’s Health is a women’s reproductive health care clinic located in New Orleans,\nLouisiana, and has provided abortion and women’s reproductive health services since 2001. (Doc.\n109 at 5; JX 168 ¶ 1; JX 110 ¶ 1.)\n40. Women’s Health employs two doctors who perform abortions, Does 5 and 6. (JX 110\n¶ 3; JX 168 ¶ 4.) Doe 5 performs approximately 40% of the abortions provided at Women’s\nClinic, and Doe 6 performs the remaining 60%. (JX 110 ¶ 3; JX 168 ¶ 4.)\n41. Women’s Health provides surgical abortions for women through 16 weeks and\nmedication abortions through eight weeks. (Doc. 168-4 at 19.19) Doe 6 provides only medication\n19 The designated deposition testimony appears within the larger docketed document.\n(Doc. 168.) For the sake of consistency and ease, the Court continues to use the page numbers of\nthe uploaded document and not of the deposition transcript itself. \n19 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 20 of 112\nabortions. (Id. at 55.)20  \n(5) Delta\n42. Delta is a women’s reproductive health care clinic located in Baton Rouge, and has\nprovided abortion and women’s reproductive health services since 2001. (Doc. 109 at 5.)\n43. Delta employs one doctor who performs abortions, Doe 5. ( JX 110 ¶ 35.)\n44. Delta provides surgical abortions for women through 16 weeks LMP, and medication\nabortions through eight weeks. (Doc. 168-4 at 13–14, 19.)21\n45. The northern part of Louisiana is served by Hope in Shreveport and by Bossier Clinic\nin Bossier City. (Doc. 191 at 17; Doc. 190 at 110.) The southern part of this state is served by\nCauseway in Metairie, Delta in Baton Rouge,  and Women’s Health in New Orleans. (JX 110 ¶ 1;\nJX 114 ¶ 1; JX 109 ¶ 13.) \nC. The Doctors \n46. There are currently six doctors who perform all abortions in Louisiana. (Doc. 109 at 4;\nsee also, e.g., JX 109 ¶ 14.)\n(1) Doe 1\n47.  Doe 1 is a board-certified physician in Family Medicine and Addiction Medicine and\nis one of two clinic physicians at Hope. (Doc. 109 at 5).\n20 See supra note 18.\n21 Id. \n20 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 21 of 112\n48. Doe 1 has over 10 years of experience, seven of those as an abortion provider. (Doc.\n190 at 139–40; Doc. 14 ¶ 14.) He provides medication abortions through eight weeks and surgical\nabortions through 13 weeks, six days LMP. (Doc. 192 at 21; Doc. 190 at 132.) \n49. Doe 1 was trained to provide abortion services by Doe 3, the medical director of the\nHope Clinic, where they both work. (Doc. 192 at 140–41.)\n50. Despite beginning his efforts to get admitting privileges at a nearby hospital in July\n2014, (Id. at 52),  Doe 1 still does not have active admitting privileges at a hospital within 30\nmiles of Hope Clinic. (Doc. 190 at 21.) The efforts of all six doctors to gain active admitting\nprivileges and the results of those efforts are reviewed in more detail in another section of this\nRuling. See infra Part VIII. \n(2) Doe 2\n51. Doe 2 is a board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist and is one of two clinic physicians\nat Causeway and the only clinic physician at Bossier who provides abortion services. (Doc. 109 at\n5.) He is the medical director of Causeway and Bossier. (Id.)\n52. Doe 2 has been performing abortions since 1980. (Doc. 191 at 13-14.) Doe 2 performs\nmedication abortions through eight weeks and surgical abortions up through the state’s legal limit\nof 21 weeks, six days LMP. (Doc. 191 at 22–23, 55–56; JX 187 ¶ 4.) He performs medication and\nsurgical abortions at Bossier Clinic, but only surgical abortions at Causeway Clinic. (Id. at\n21–23.) Last year, Doe 2 performed approximately 550 abortions at Bossier and 450 abortions at\nCauseway Clinic. (Id. at 17–18.) \n53. Doe 2 performs first and second trimester surgical abortions through 21 weeks, six\n21 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 22 of 112\ndays LMP, and is the only one of two physicians in Louisiana to offer abortion after 16 weeks, six\ndays LMP. (Id. at 21–22.)22 \n54. Doe 2 has been unsuccessful in getting active admitting privileges within 30 miles of\nBossier and has been able to obtain only limited privileges, which do not meet the requirements\nof Act 620, within 30 miles of Causeway. (See, e.g., id.)\n(3) Doe 3\n55. Doe 3 is a board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist and one of two clinic physicians at\nHope. (Doc. 109 at 5.) He is also the medical director at Hope. (Id.)\n56. Doe 3 has been licensed to practice medicine in Louisiana since 1976. (Doc. 190 at\n109.) In addition to his abortion practice, he has an active general OB/GYN practice, where he\ndelivers babies and routinely performs gynecological surgery including hysterectomies,\nlaparoscopies, and dilation and curettages (“D&Cs”). (Id. at 110.)\n57. Doe 3 is the chief medical officer of Hope Clinic, where he has worked since 1981.\n(Doc. 190 at 108, 117, 21.) He provides medication abortions through eight weeks and surgical\nabortions through 16 weeks, six days LMP. (Id. at 35, 119, 132.)\n58. Doe 3 performs abortions at Hope Clinic on Thursday afternoons and all day on\nSaturday. He sees approximately 20 to 30 abortion patients a week. (Id. at 117–18, 153.) On\noccasion, he will cover for Doe 1 and will see more patients in those instances. (Id.)\n59. Doe 3 currently has admitting privileges at Willis-Knighton Hospital in Bossier\n(“WKB”) and at Christus Highland Medical Center in Bossier (“Christus”), both of which are\n22 Id.\n22 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 23 of 112\nwithin 30 miles of Hope Clinic. (Id. at 21–22, 120, 148–49.) Doe 3’s current privileges at\nChristus require him to admit approximately 50 patients per year. (Id. at 150–52; JX 59.)\n60. Doe 3 has his current admitting privileges because he regularly admits patients to the\nhospital as part of his private OB/GYN practice, not because of his work at Hope Clinic. (Id. at\n124, 147.) \n(4) Doe 4\n61. Doe 4 is a board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist and one of two clinic physicians at\nCauseway. (Doc. 109 at 5.)\n62. Doe 4 obtained his license to practice medicine in Maryland in 1959 and has been\npracticing medicine for 56 years and in Louisiana since 1965. (Doc. 168-5 at 5–6.) He served as\nan assistant professor or assistant instructor in obstetrics and gynecology for seventeen years at\nEarl K. Long Hospital. (Id. at 12.)\n63. When Doe 4 maintained a full OB/GYN practice, he had admitting privileges at four\nhospitals in the Baton Rouge area. (Id. at 6.) He was required to have admitting privileges to do\nOB/GYN surgery and, in his words, “to deliver babies.” (Id.) The existence of these privileges did\nnot benefit his pregnancy termination patients because, to his knowledge, none of his abortion\npatients experienced any problem and required hospital admission. (Id. at 19–20.)\n64. Doe 4 performs abortions at Causeway in Metairie. (Doc. 109 at 5; see also, e.g., Doc.\n168-5 at 8.) He does not currently have and has been unable to get admitting privileges at a\nhospital within 30 miles of Causeway. (Doc. 191 at 18; see also, e.g., Doc. 168-5 at 16.) \n23 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 24 of 112\n(5) Doe 5\n65. Doe 5 is a board certified obstetrician-gynecologist. (Doc. 109 at 5; see also Doc. 168-\n6 at 4–5.) He is one of two clinic physicians at Women’s Clinic and the only clinic physician at\nDelta Clinic. (Doc. 109 at 5; see also Doc. 168-6 at 4, 13–14, 22.)\n66. Doe 5 has been licensed to practice medicine in Louisiana since 2005. (Doc. 168-6 at\n5.) He provides surgical abortions at Delta Clinic and Women’s Health through 16 weeks LMP.\n(Id. at 20; see also JX 110 ¶ 1.)23  \n67. Doe 5 has been successful in getting active admitting privileges within 30 miles of\nWomen’s Health in New Orleans but has been unsuccessful in his efforts to get active admitting\nprivileges within 30 miles of Delta in Baton Rouge. (Doc. 168-6 at 11–13; see also, e.g.,  JX 109\n¶¶ 33–34; JX 110 ¶¶ 15–19.)\n(6) Doe 6\n68. Doe 6 is a board certified obstetrician-gynecologist and one of two clinic physicians at\nWomen’s Health. (Doc. 109 at 5; see also Doc. 168-4 at 13.)\n69. Doe 6 has been practicing medicine for 48 years. (JX 109 ¶ 8.) He is currently the\nmedical director of Women’s Clinic and Delta Clinic. (Id.) Dr. John Doe 6 provides only\nmedication abortions and does so only at Women’s Clinic. (Id. ¶¶ 8–9.)\n70. Doe 6 has been unsuccessful in his efforts to get active admitting privileges within 30\nmiles of Women’s. (Id. ¶¶ 23–26.)\n23 Id.\n24 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 25 of 112\nD. Admitting Privileges in Louisiana\n71. In order to perform abortions legally in Louisiana, Act 620 requires an abortion doctor\nto have “active admitting privileges” at a hospital within 30 miles of the facility where he or she\nperforms abortions. LA. R.S. § 40:1299.35.2A(2)(A). To have “active admitting privileges”  the\nphysician must be a “member in good standing of the medical staff” of a hospital “with the ability\nto admit a patient and to provide diagnostic and surgical services to such patient . . . .” Id. The\nphrase “member in good standing of the medical staff” is not separately defined. (Cf. Doc. 193 at\n12.) \n72. Thus, how a physician may obtain “medical staff” and “active admitting” privileges\nfrom a Louisiana hospital is critical in determining the effect, if any, that Act 620 has on abortion\nproviders and, in turn, the women that they serve.\n73. The expert testimony regarding hospital admitting privileges came primarily from two\nexperts–Pressman, Plaintiffs’ expert, (Doc. 195 at 11–96), and Marier, Defendant’s (Doc. 193 at\n4–124)–and, to a lesser extent, from the other physicians, including Does 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, who\ntestified. See supra Part I. On the issue of admitting privileges and hospital credentialing, the\nCourt found both Pressman and Marier to be generally well qualified.\n74. Additional information about the credentialing process and the specific requirements\nof various hospitals came from certain hospital by-laws introduced into evidence. (See, e.g., JX\n46, 48, 67, 72, 76, 78–79, 81, 138, 140–43.)\n75. Credentialing is a process that hospitals employ to determine what doctors will be\nallowed to perform what tasks within that hospital. (Doc. 193 at 11; see also, e.g., Doc. 195 at\n23–27; Doc. 168-5 at 24.)\n25 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 26 of 112\n76. Part of this process involves the hospital’s granting or denying “admitting privileges.”\n(See, e.g., Doc. 193 at 20; Doc. 195 at 17, 23–25.)  These privileges govern whether or not a\nphysician is authorized to admit and treat a patient at that hospital and what care, services and\ntreatment the physician is authorized to provide. (See, e.g., Doc. 193 at 20–21; Doc. 195 at 23,\n25–26.)\n77. Admitting privileges are related to but not the same as being on the “medical staff” of\na hospital. (Doc. 193 at 11; Doc. 195 at 25–26.)\n78. There is no requirement that a physician have admitting privileges or be on the\nmedical staff at a hospital in order to practice medicine. (See, e.g., Doc. 195 at 26.) Many\nphysicians who do not have a hospital based practice, i.e. do not intend to admit and treat their\npatients in a hospital setting, have neither as there is no need for staff or admitting privileges\nunder those circumstances. (See, e.g., Doc. 175 at 75; Doc. 192 at 41–42; Doc. 195 at 75.)\n79. There is no state or federal statute which governs the rules for the granting or denial of \nhospital admitting privileges in Louisiana.24 Cf. Planned Parenthood of Wis., Inc. v. Van Hollen,\n738 F.3d 786, 792 (7th Cir. 2013) (“The criteria for granting admitting privileges are multiple,\nvarious, and unweighted.”). Rather, partly as a consequence of this absence, these rules vary from\nhospital to hospital and are governed by each one’s distinct by-laws.25 (See, e.g., Doc. 193 at 12,\n24 While one statute, commonly known as the Church Amendment, does impose a type of\ngermane privileges requirement on hospitals accepting federal funds, 42 U.S.C. §\n300a-7(c)(1)(B), this statute was not shown to apply to the hospitals involved in this case, see\ninfra note 32.\n25 Cf. AM. MED. ASS’N, OPINION 4:07 - STAFF PRIVILEGES (June 1994) (“Privileges should\nnot be based on numbers of patients admitted to the facility or the economic or insurance status\nof the patient. . . . Physicians who are involved in the granting, denying, or termination of\nhospital privileges have an ethical responsibility to be guided primarily by concern for the\n26 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 27 of 112\n15; Doc. 195 at 28.) \n80. Specifically, there is no state or federal statute which defines or sets uniform standards\nfor the categories of admitting privileges a hospital may grant. (Doc. 193 at 11–12.) Like other\nrules, these are therefore set by each hospital’s by-laws. (Id.; see also, e.g., Doc. 195 at 28; JX 81\nat 1798.) To make matters more confusing, the terms used to describe those categories (e.g.\n“active admitting privileges”, “courtesy admitting privileges”, “clinical admitting privileges”)\nvary from hospital to hospital. (See, e.g., Doc. 190 at 167; Doc. 191 at 104; Doc. 193 at 11–12;\nDoc. 195 at 28.)\n81. Similarly, terms like “medical staff”, “active staff”, “courtesy staff”, “clinical staff”\nvary among hospitals. (Doc. 191 at 35; Doc. 193 at 12; Doc. 195 at 28; cf. JX 79 at 1707–12.)\n82. For example, at some hospitals, an “active” staff appointment does not, alone,\nautomatically entitle the physician to admit patients. (See, e.g., JX 46 at 185; JX 79 at 1673; JX\n141 at 3259–60.)\n83. Because of the varying definitions given to the categories of admitting privileges and\nthe varying requirements for the attainment of same, whether a physician has been given “active\nadmitting privileges” or is a “member in good standing on the medical staff” within the meaning\nof Act 620 entirely depends upon the specific definition, requirements and restrictions imposed by\na given hospital in a given circumstance. (See, e.g., Doc. 193 at 12.)\nwelfare and best interests of patients in discharging this responsibility.”). The evidence presented\nin this case shows that these aspirational goals are not reflected in the by-laws of the Louisiana\nhospitals whose rules and practices are before the Court. \n27 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 28 of 112\n84. Unlike some states,26  there is also no statute or rule in Louisiana which sets a\nmaximum time period within which a physician’s application for admitting privileges must be\nacted upon. Thus, unless there is such a time limit in the hospital’s by-laws, a hospital can\neffectively deny a doctor’s application of privileges by never acting on it, a decision on any one\ndoctor’s application permanently delayed without a consequence being effected or a reason being\ngiven. A definite decision stays unreached–but, with his or her request suspended, the relevant\ndoctor’s privileges remain, as a matter of fact and law, nonexistent. In this Ruling, the Court uses\nthe term “de facto denial” of privileges to describe this circumstance.27\n85. At some hospitals in Louisiana, there are suggested time frames in which hospitals\nshould review admitting privileges applications. (JX 72 at 1320–23; see also, e.g., JX 67 at\n857–58; JX 76 at 1444–47.) However, those guidelines are not requirements, and there is no legal\n26 Texas sets a 170 day time limit within which a hospital’s credentialing committee must\ntake final action on a completed application for medical staff membership or privileges.

Seemingly, though also in other contexts, the Fifth Circuit\nhas recognized such a possibility. See Chevron USA, Inc. v. Sch. Bd. of Vermilion Parish, 294\nF.3d 716, 720 (5th Cir. 2002) (“Arguably, the district court’s order was a de facto denial of class\ncertification (although the parties have not treated it as such, and no motion for class certification\nwas ever filed).”). \n28 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 29 of 112\nrecourse for an applicant if the hospital fails to act on the application within the suggested time\nperiod. (See, e.g., JX 67 at 858–59; JX 72 at 1320–24; JX 109 ¶ 27.) For example, Tulane\nUniversity Medical Center (“Tulane”) has an expectation, but has adopted no requirement, that\napplications will be processed within 150 days. (JX 78 at 1554.) If the Board of Trustees has not\ntaken action on the application within 150 days, the applicant must repeat the verification process\nto ensure the information contained therein is still accurate. (Id.)\n86. A hospital’s failure to act on an application by either approving or denying it may\nresult in the hospital considering the application withdrawn. (See, e.g., Doc. 195 at 93; JX 71 at\n1279.) In this additional respect, a hospital’s failure to act is, in effect, a de facto denial of the\napplication.\n87. While a physician’s competency is a factor in assessing an applicant for admitting\nprivileges, it is only one factor that hospitals consider in whether to grant privileges. (See, e.g.,\nDoc. 190 at 158–59; Doc. 195 at 25–26; Doc. 192 at 50–51; Doc. 168-5 at 17; Doc. 168-6 at 12;\nJX 110 ¶ 10; JX 168 ¶¶ 11–13, 17; PX 183.)\n88. Defendant argues: “When Louisiana hospitals decide whether to grant a physician\nstaff membership, privileges to admit patients, or privileges to perform particular procedures,\nhospital by-laws indicate that they may make such determinations based on the physician’s prior\nand current practice, and indicia of the physician’s clinical competence.”28 (Doc. 200 ¶ 114 at 38\n(citing to JX 2873; JX 1838; JX 1542–43; JX 852–53).)\n89. The Court finds that this is only partly true because both by virtue of by-laws and how\n28 The Defendant’s briefing cites exhibits by Bates page numbers rather than exhibit\nnumbers. \n29 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 30 of 112\nprivileges applications are handled in actual practice, hospitals may deny privileges or decline to\nconsider an application for privileges for myriad reasons unrelated to competency. Examples\ninclude the physician’s expected usage of the hospital and intent to admit and treat patients there,\nthe number of patients the physician has treated in the hospital in the recent past, the needs of the\nhospital, the mission of the hospital, or the business model of the hospital. Furthermore, hospitals\nmay grant privileges only to physicians employed by and on the staff of the hospital. And\nuniversity-affiliated hospitals may grant privileges only to faculty members. These possible\nvariances in causes and justification for any particular denial are attested to by this case’s\nevidentiary submissions and testimony. (See, e.g., Doc. 195 at 25–26; Doc. 190 at 123, 168–70;\nDoc. 193 at 82–83; JX 109 ¶¶ 27–28; JX 110 ¶ 10; JX 168 ¶¶ 11–13, 17; Doc. 168-5 at 6, 23.)\n90. An apparently benign example of such a non-competency based, business driven\nreason for denying privileges is the denial of Doe 1’s application to the Minden Medical Center\n(“Minden”). (JX 50 at 318; Doc. 192 at 50–51.) In declining his application for staff membership\nand clinical privileges, Minden’s Medical Staff Coordinator wrote to Doe 1: “Since we do not\nhave a need for a satellite primary care physician at this time, I am returning your application and\ncheck.” (JX 50 at 318; see also JX 72 at 1323.)\n91. When they had full OB/GYN practices delivering babies and performing\ngynecological surgery, Does 2, 4, and 6 had no problem obtaining and maintaining admitting\nprivileges at a number of hospitals. (See, e.g., Doc. 168-5 at 6–8; JX 109 ¶ 30.) However, under\nAct 620, for reasons unrelated to competency, they are now unable to secure active admitting\nprivileges. (See, e.g., Doc. 191 at 24–26; Doc. 168-5 at 16–17; JX 109 ¶¶ 23, 30, 31–34.)\n92. Another example of a non-competency based application criteria is that some hospitals\n30 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 31 of 112\nrequire the physician seeking privileges to live and/or practice within a certain distance of the\nhospital. (JX 83 at 1865; JX 139-a at 2925; JX 79 at 1679–83.) Does 2 and 5 travel significant\ndistances from their respective homes to provide abortion services and would not be able to meet\nthis criteria for hospitals within 30 miles of some or all of the clinics where they provide\nabortions. (Doc. 191 at 20–21; Doc. 168-6 at 4, 11–13; JX 109 ¶¶ 31–36.)\n93. Defendant argues that “[t]here is no evidence suggesting that, in making the\ndeterminations about staff membership or privileges, Louisiana hospitals discriminate against\nphysicians based on whether they provide elective abortions.” (Doc. 200 ¶ 115 at 38 (citing\nMarier’s testimony, as it appears on Doc. 193 at 83–86).) In his testimony, however, Marier only\nacknowledged that he personally knew of no hospitals which refused to extend privileges to a\ndoctor “simply because he or she performs an abortion.” (Doc. 193 at 83–85.) Regardless, to the\nextent Marier’s testimony can be so construed, the Court finds his testimony on this point to be\nnot credible and contradicted by an abundance of evidence introduced at the hearing\ndemonstrating that hospitals can and do deny privileges for reasons directly related to a\nphysician’s status as an abortion provider. (See, e.g., Doc. 168-6 at 12; Doc. 190 at 53; JX 109 ¶¶\n28, 30, 39.)\n94. For instance, Doe 1 contacted the director of the Family Medicine Department at\nUniversity Health Hospital in Shreveport (“University” or “University Health”)29 where he had\ndone his residency in family medicine. Dr. Doe 1 was initially told that he would be offered a job\nas a faculty member teaching sports medicine which would “take care of the admitting privileges\n29 This hospital is a teaching hospital associated with LSU Medical School and is\nsometimes referred to as LSU Shreveport Hospital. (See, e.g., JX 79; Doc. 192 at 19, 47.)\n31 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 32 of 112\nthing.” (Doc. 192 at 45.) Doe 1 was told that the application forms for admitting privileges would\nbe forwarded to him. (Id.)\n95. When Doe 1 did not get the application forms and inquired, he was told by the director\nof the department that he would not be offered a position because “there was some objection from\ncertain staff about [Doe 1] coming to work there because of where [he] work[ed], at Hope\nMedical.” (Id. at 45–46.)30\n96. This same essential response was also given to Doe 2 when he attempted to upgrade\nhis courtesy privileges at University Health. (Doc. 191 at 24–26.)\n97. There is no Louisiana statute which prohibits a Louisiana hospital or those individuals\ncharged with credentialing responsibilities from declining an application for admitting privileges\nbased on the applicant’s status as an abortion provider.31\n98. Section 40:1299.32 provides: “No hospital, clinic or other facility or institution of any\nkind shall be held civilly or criminally liable, discriminated against, or in any way prejudiced or\n30 This testimony was objected to as hearsay, which objection was overruled. (Doc. 192 at\n46.) It was overruled for two reasons. First, the ordinary rules of admissibility are relaxed in a\npreliminary injunction hearing and hearsay may be admitted. E.g., Fed. Savings & Loan Ins.\nCorp. v. Dixon, 835 F.2d 554, 558 (5th Cir. 1987); Sierra Club, Loan Star Chapter v. F.D.I.C.,\n992 F.2d 545, 551 (5th Cir. 1993); see also 11A CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT & ARTHUR R. MILLER,\nFEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 2949 (3d. 2015). Second, as this testimony was presented\nso as to explain Doe’s failure to make formal application for privileges at University, the\ntestimony was not offered to prove its truth and was thus, for this limited purpose, not hearsay.\nFED. R. CIV. P. 801(c)(2).\n31 Texas law, in contrast, “specifically prohibits discrimination by hospitals or health care\nfacilities against physicians who perform abortions.” TEX. OCC. CODE § 103.002(b). Texas law\nfurther provides a private cause of action for an individual to enforce this non-discrimination\nclause.

R.S. § 40:1299.32.32\n99. The Court was surprised that Defendant’s credentialing expert, Marier, was unaware\nof this provision, but Marier agreed that, by virtue of this provision, “a hospital, if it chooses to,\nmay discriminate against any abortion provider with no consequence under Louisiana law.” (Doc.\n193 at 84.)\n100. Section 40:1299.33(C) states: “No hospital, clinic, or other medical or health facility,\nwhether public or private, shall ever be denied government assistance or be otherwise\ndiscriminated against or otherwise be pressured in any way for refusing to permit facilities, staff\nor employees to be used in any way for the purpose of performing any abortion.” LA. R.S. §\n40:1299.33(C).33\n101. While Doe 2 ultimately received limited privileges at Tulane, the negotiations that\nled to these privileges being granted clearly demonstrate that Doe 2’s status as an abortion\nprovider was a central issue in the decision making process over whether to grant him privileges\nand the limitations those privileges would have. (See JX 161–81; see infra Part VIII.)\n102. There are ways in which the hospital staff’s and/or the general public’s hostility to\nabortion and abortion providers can be injected into the credentialing process. For instance, many\n32 The statute was introduced as an exhibit. (PX 183.) Not before the Court is the efficacy\nof this state statute in the face of the Church Amendment, which prohibits a hospital which\nreceives funding under the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. § 201 et seq., from\ndiscriminating in employment against those who perform abortions.  42 U.S.C. § 300a-7.\nFurthermore, no evidence was introduced as to whether any of the hospitals where credentials\nwere sought in this case, or in Louisiana generally, receive such funds. The text of the Church\nAmendment was submitted as an exhibit. (DX 162.) \n33 This subsection was introduced as an exhibit. (PX 182.)\n33 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 34 of 112\napplications for privileges require references from at least two physicians who recently have\nobserved the applying physician as to applicant’s medical skill and “character.” (JX 143 at 3357;\nJX 79 at 1680–81; JX 83 at 1873; JX 143 at 3351.) For example, Minden prefers that an\napplicant’s peer recommendations come from physicians already on staff at that hospital. (JX 72\nat 1300.) Although competent, an abortion provider can face difficulty in getting the required staff\nreferences because of staff opposition to abortion. (See, e.g., Doc. 168-6 at 12; Doc. 190 at 53; JX\n109 ¶¶ 28, 30, 39.)\n103. Other hospitals’ admitting privileges applications require the applying physician to\nidentify another physician on staff who will “cover” his or her patients if the applying physician\nis unavailable, frequently called a “covering physician.” (JX 78 at 1539; JX 79 at 1677; JX 138 at\n2855; JX 83 at 1866.) As summarized below, the evidence shows that opposition to abortion can\npresent a major, if not insurmountable hurdle, for an applicant getting the required covering\nphysician.\n104. For example, Doe 5 has applied for admitting privileges at three hospitals in the\nBaton Rouge area: Woman’s Hospital in April or May of 2014 and Lane Regional Medical\nCenter and Baton Rouge General Medical Center in July of 2014. (Doc. 168-6 at 11.)  Doe 5 has\nbeen unable to find a local physician who is willing to provide coverage for him when he is not in\nBaton Rouge, which all three hospitals require. (JX 109 ¶¶ 32–33; JX 110; Doc. 51; Doc. 168-6 at\n11–12.)34 Doe 3 also has had difficulty finding physicians to cover for him due to the animosity\n34 This continues to be an obstacle to Doe 5 getting privileges in Baton Rouge. (JX 193.) \nWhile Dr. Doe 2 was ultimately able to get limited privileges, it appears that this difficulty may\nhave played a role in the limitations imposed on his privileges.\n34 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 35 of 112\ntowards him as an abortion provider. (Doc. 190 at 11–13.) While Doe 2 ultimately got limited\nprivileges at Tulane, (JX 183), the evidence therefore demonstrates that staff physicians who\noppose abortion present a real obstacle, see infra Part VIII.B. \n105. Some other non-competency based admitting privileges requirements create a\nparticular obstacle for abortion providers whose practice is not hospital based, who do not admit\npatients to a hospital as a part of their practice, and who do not perform surgeries at a hospital.\n106. As one example, hospitals often grant admitting privileges to a physician because the\nphysician plans to provide services in the hospital. (See, e.g., Doc. 195 at 24–25; Doc. 193 at 66.) \nIn general, hospital admitting privileges are not provided to physicians who never intend to\nprovide services in a hospital. (Doc. 195 at 23–25, 27, 74–75; Doc. 193 at 66–67.)\n107. Thus, in connection with the applications of Does 1 and 2 at Willis-Knighton\nMedical Center (“WKMC”), Willis-Knighton South (“WKS”), and Willis-Knighton Pierremont\nHealth Center (“WKP”) in Shreveport, (JX 53, 144), the Willis-Knighton Health System (“Willis-\nKnighton”), which runs these three (as well as other) entities, has required these doctors to submit\ndata on hospital admissions, patient management and consultations of patients in the past 12\nmonths in a hospital. (Doc. 192 at 75–76; JX 128; JX 89 at 1950.)\n108. Because their abortion practice is not hospital based, neither doctor can possibly\ncomply with that requirement. In the case of Doe 1, since he formally responded to a hospital’s\nrequest for more information regarding his history of admitting patients during the preceding\ntwelve months, saying he had no such information, he has never again heard from the hospital -\nthere being neither a denial nor an approval of his application. (Doc. 192 at 75–78.) Similarly,\nwhen Doe 2 gave the hospital the only information in his possession, he received formal notice\n35 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 36 of 112\nthat this was insufficient and “[w]ithout that [additional] information, your application remains\nincomplete and cannot be processed.” (JX 89 at 1950.) Doe 2 could do nothing else, explaining,\n“I’m in a Catch-22 basically. I can’t provide information I don’t have.” (Doc. 191 at 79–80.)\n109. Even if these Does and similar practitioners somehow got admitting privileges, it is\nunlikely they would be able to keep them. If over a period of two to three years, a physician has\nnot admitted any patients to the hospital, a hospital credentialing committee is likely to\nunderstand that this physician no longer requires admitting privileges. (See, e.g., Doc. 195 at 91.)\nBecause, by all accounts, abortion complications are rare, (See, e.g., Doc. 168-5 at 14, 16, 20–21;\nDoc. 193 at 81–82; Doc. 195 at 38–39), an abortion provider is unlikely to have a consistent need\nto admit patients.\n110. Furthermore, surgical privileges are meant for providers who plan to perform\nsurgeries at the hospital. (Doc. 195 at 95–96.)\n111. For the reasons outlined above, the Court finds that the Louisiana practice of\ncredentialing, i.e. a hospital’s consideration of and acting (or not acting) upon applications for\nadmitting privileges, creates particular hardships and obstacles for abortion providers.\n112. The efforts made by Does 1–6 to comply with the admitting privileges requirement of\nAct 620, and the result of those efforts, is reviewed in another section of this Ruling. See infra\nPart VIII. \nE. The Climate\n113. The evidence is overwhelming that in Louisiana, abortion providers, the clinics\nwhere they work and the staff of these clinics, are subjected to violence, threats of violence,\n36 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 37 of 112\nharassment and danger.\n114. Defendant offered no evidence to counter Plaintiffs’ evidence on this point. Rather,\nDefendant makes two arguments: first, some of the Plaintiffs’ evidence on this point is hearsay,\nand second, the violence is “legally irrelevant” to the undue burden analysis. (Doc. 201 at 14–15.)\nThe issue of legal relevance is addressed in the Conclusions of Law section of this Ruling. See\ninfra Parts XI–XII.\n115. Defendant objects to the testimony and exhibits cited in Plaintiffs’ proposed findings\nand conclusions (Doc. 196 ¶¶ 79, 84, 87, 89), as hearsay. However, almost all of this testimony\nwas not objected to by Defendant at the time it was introduced. Moreover, in some instances, this\ntestimony came in by way of exhibits offered jointly by the Parties or in questions asked by\ncounsel for the Defendant. \n116. But even if the objected-to evidence were excluded, there is a mountain of\nuncontradicted and un-objected to evidence supporting this conclusion, some of which is\nsummarized below. \n117. In addition to the harassment and violence, as was discussed briefly in the previous\nsection and will be discussed in more detail in the section reviewing the doctors’ efforts to gain\nadmitting privileges, the personal and/or religious feelings against abortion by the public, some\nmembers of the medical profession and hospital administrators has had a negative effect on the\ndoctors’ efforts to gain admitting privileges. (See, e.g., Doc. 168-6 at 12; Doc. 190 at 53; Doc.\n191 at 24–26; Doc. 192 at 45–46; JX 109 ¶¶ 28, 30, 39.)\n118. Indeed, after reviewing Plaintiffs’ motion to allow the Plaintiff doctors to use\npseudonyms as well as their supporting affidavits, the United States Magistrate Judge concluded:\n37 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 38 of 112\n“The Court is satisfied that the potential for harassment, intimidation and violence in this case,\nparticularly recent instances of such conduct, both nationwide and in Louisiana, justifies the\nunusual and rare remedy of allowing the individual Plaintiffs to proceed anonymously.” (Doc. 24\nat 3; see also Doc 190 at 108; Doc. 191 at 12; Doc. 192 at 6.) A similar order was signed when\nDoes 3–6 were added as parties. (Doc. 55.)\n119. Also recognizing these legitimate safety concerns, Defendant joined with Plaintiffs in\na Joint Consent Motion Regarding Confidential Trial Procedures, (Doc. 158), granted on June 23,\n2015, (Doc. 161). These procedures included allowing Does 1–3 to testify from behind a screen.35\n(Doc. 158 at 1.)\n120. The security concerns even went beyond the Parties, however. A request for\nanonymity was made on behalf of a hospital which had granted privileges to Doe 5 and the non-\nparty doctors who assisted in the privileges request. No objection was made by any party and the\nCourt ordered this hospital to be called “Hospital C” and the doctor involved for that hospital,”\nDr. C.” (Id.) Other doctors involved in granting the limited privileges to Doe 2 were ordered to be\ncalled “Dr. A” and “Dr. B.” (Id.)\n121. In order to insure the use of the pseudonyms and protect the identities of Plaintiff\ndoctors as well as certain non-party doctors and hospitals, the Plaintiffs and Defendant filed a\njoint motion to redact portions of the trial transcript, which the Court granted. (Doc. 180.) By\ntheir filings in this case, therefore, Defendant and Plaintiffs have implicitly acknowledged the\ncharged emotions generated by this particular issue within and outside this state.    \n35 The screen was positioned so as to protect the identity of the witness from the public\nbut allowed the Court to see and judge the demeanor of the witnesses.\n38 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 39 of 112\n122. The evidence, in turn, leaves no question about the dangers and hostility regularly\nendured by Plaintiffs. \n123. Each of Louisiana’s five clinics experiences frequent demonstrations by anti-abortion\nactivists. (Doc. 190 at 24, 108; Doc. 191 at 13; JX 109 ¶¶ 10–12; JX 117 ¶ 6; JX 112 ¶ 2;  JX 113\n¶ 2; Doc. 168-6 at 25.) These demonstrations require some clinics to have additional security on\nsite. (Doc. 190 at 23.)\n124. Hope Clinic in Shreveport has been the subject of three violent attacks: once by a\nman wielding a sledgehammer, once by an arsonist who threw a Molotov cocktail at the clinic,\nand once by having a hole drilled through the wall and butyric acid poured through it. (Doc. 190\nat 23; JX 116 ¶ 8.)\n125. In the fall of 2014, following passage of the Act, anti-abortion activists attempted to\ninterfere with Doe 5’s admitting privileges application at Woman’s Hospital in Baton Rouge by\nsending threatening letters to the hospital. (JX 110 ¶ 14; JX 109 ¶ 29.) Woman’s Hospital also\nhad to remove anti-abortion activists from its medical staff offices due to the activists’ disruptive\nconduct. (JX 110 ¶ 14.)\n126. When Doe 5 worked as a hospital employed physician, protests outside the hospital\ncaused the hospital administration to give him an ultimatum: quit performing abortions or resign\nfrom the hospital staff. (JX 110 ¶ 21; see also Doc. 168-6 at 23–24.) In his words, he “was\ntherefore forced to stop working at the hospital so that . . . [he] could continue providing services\nat Women’s Clinic and Delta Clinic.” (JX 110 ¶ 21; see also JX 109 ¶ 30.)\n127. After Doe 5 recently acquired privileges at a local hospital (Hospital C), anti-abortion\nactivists began sending threatening letters to that hospital causing him to fear that he might lose\n39 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 40 of 112\nthe privileges that he acquired. (JX 110 ¶ 20; see also JX 109 ¶ 39.)\n128. Anti-abortion activists picketed the school of the children of a doctor formerly\naffiliated with Delta, after which that doctor quit. (Doc. 168-4 at 23–24.)\n129. A physician quit working at Causeway after receiving harassing telephone calls at his\nprivate practice and anti-abortion activists demonstrated outside the hospital where he worked.\n(Doc. 168-8 at 8.)\n130. Doe 1 works at Hope–but he does so in fear of violence. (Doc. 192 at 78–79.)\n131. Doe 2 has received threatening phone calls, has been followed into restaurants and\naccosted, and has been shouted at with profanity and told that he was going to hell. (Doc. 191 at\n12–13.)\n132. Doe 2 was forced to leave a private practice when the practice’s malpractice insurer\nrefused to cover him if he continued to perform elective pregnancy terminations. (Id. at 16–17.)\n133. Doe 3 has been threatened as a result of his work at Hope Clinic. (JX 113 ¶ 3.) Last\nyear, anti-abortion activists from outside Louisiana left fliers on neighbors’ mailboxes calling him\nan abortionist and saying they wanted to convert him to Jesus. (Doc 190 at 108–09.) Local police\nhave had to patrol his neighborhood and search his house before he entered. (JX 113 ¶ 4.)\n134. These individuals also approached Doe 3’s regular medical practice patients as they\ntried to enter his office, requiring the building security officers to escort the activists off the\npremises. (Id. ¶ 3.)  These individuals told Doe 3’s patients that he killed babies and that they\nshould not see him. (Doc. 190 at 109.)\n135. Doe 3 fears that, if the other Louisiana abortion providers are not able to obtain\nadmitting privileges, he will become an even greater target for anti-abortion violence. (JX 113 ¶¶\n40 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 41 of 112\n6–7.)  He specifically testified that “all [these individuals] have to do is eliminate [him] as they\nhave Dr. Tiller and some of the other abortion providers around the country” to eliminate abortion\nentirely in northern Louisiana. (Doc. 190 at 174.)\n136. Doe 3 also explicitly emphasized that he is concerned that such individuals could\n“cause a lot of other . . . problems that would affect [his] ability to perform the rest of [his]\npractice.” (Id. at 174–75; cf. JX 113 ¶¶ 6–7.)\n137. Doe 3 has difficulty arranging coverage for his OB/GYN practice because other\nOB/GYN doctors in the Shreveport area refuse to cover his practice as a result of his work at\nHope. (Doc. 190 at 111–13.)\n138. As a result of his fears, and the demands of his private OB/GYN practice, Doe 3 has\ntestified that if he is the last physician performing abortion in either the entire state or in the\nnorthern part of the state, he will not continue to perform abortions. (Id. at 174–76.)\n139. Anti-abortion activists have picketed the homes – and neighbors’ homes – of Does 5\nand 6, also distributing threatening flyers. (Doc. 168-6 at 24; JX 109 ¶ 11.)\n140. Anti-abortion activists have targeted at least one physician who agreed to provide\nemergency care for abortion complications, even though he did not provide abortions himself.\n(Doc. 168-6 at 11, 24–25; JX 110 ¶ 20.)\nVI. Act 620\nA. Text of Act 620 and Related Provisions\n141. The challenged statute is Act 620. LA. R.S. § 40:1299.35.2. \n142. Act 620 amended Louisiana Revised Statutes § 40:1299.35.2(a), 1299.35.2.1, and\n41 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 42 of 112\n2175.3(2) and (5). (Id.)\n143. On June 12, 2014, Governor Bobby Jindal signed Act 620 into law, with an effective\ndate of September 1, 2014. (See, e.g., Doc. 109 at 4.)\n144. Act 620 provides that every physician who performs or induces an abortion shall\n“have active admitting privileges at a hospital that is located not further than thirty miles from the\nlocation at which the abortion is performed or induced and that provides obstetrical or\ngynecological health care services.” LA. R.S. § 40:1299.35.2A(1). \n145. The Act defines “active admitting privileges” to mean that “the physician is a\nmember in good standing of the medical staff of a hospital that is currently licensed by the\ndepartment, with the ability to admit a patient and to provide diagnostic and surgical services to\nsuch patient . . . .” Id. § 40:1299.35.2A(2)(a).\n146. Regulations connected to the Act and promulgated after the commencement of this\nlitigation by DHH use the same definition of “active admitting privileges.” LA. ADMIN CODE tit.\n46, § 4401.36 These regulations note that federal litigation is pending on the issue of admitting\nprivileges and that licensing provisions regarding admitting privileges will only be enforced\npursuant to an order, judgment, stipulation, or agreement issued in this case. Id. § 4423.\n147. The Act provides that any outpatient abortion facility that knowingly or negligently\nprovides abortions through a physician who does not satisfy the Act is subject to denial,\nrevocation, or non-renewal of its license by DHH. LA. R.S. § 40:1299.35.2A(1). \n148. The Act provides that a physician who fails to comply with the admitting privileges\nrequirement can be fined $4,000 per violation. Id. § 40:1299.35.2A(2)(c). \n36 A copy of this regulation was submitted as a joint exhibit. (JX 137.)\n42 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 43 of 112\n149.  In addition, discipline by the Board is made an enforcement provision in Act 620. \nId. § 40:1299.35.2.1E. The Board has the authority to take disciplinary action against any\nphysician. Id. § 37:1261 et seq. The Board has the authority to investigate physicians for\nviolations of law, such as Act 620. Id. § 40:1299.35.2E. By violating this law, physicians could be\nsubjected to fines or other sanctions, including the suspension or revocation of the physician’s\nlicense to practice medicine. (Doc. 168-10 at 12, 14–15; see also Doc. 31 at 4 n.4.) \nB. Louisiana’s Policy and Other Legislation Regarding Abortion\n150. The Louisiana legislature has codified a statement of opposition to legalized\nabortion, stating: \nIt is the intention of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana to regulate abortion\nto the extent permitted by the decisions of the United States Supreme Court. The\nLegislature does solemnly declare and find in reaffirmation of the longstanding\npolicy of this State that the unborn child is a human being from the time of\nconception and is, therefore, a legal person for purposes of the unborn child’s\nright to life and is entitled to the right to life from conception under the laws and\nConstitution of this State. Further the Legislature finds and declares that the\nlongstanding policy of this State is to protect the right to life of the unborn child\nfrom conception by prohibiting abortion impermissible only because of the\ndecisions of the United States Supreme Court and that, therefore, if those\ndecisions of the United States Supreme Court are ever reversed or modified or the\nUnited States Constitution is amended to allow protection of the unborn then the\nformer policy of this State to prohibit abortions shall be enforced.\nLA. R.S. § 40:1299.35.0; see also State v. Aguillard, 567 So. 2d 674, 676 (La. Ct. App. 1990)\n(observing that “the Louisiana legislature has expressed its disfavor for abortion” with this\nprovision).\n151. Consistent with this explicit statement of legislative intent, as shown below,\nLouisiana has enacted other laws that place restrictions on women seeking abortion in the state,\n43 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 44 of 112\nand doctors and clinics who perform abortions.\n152. In 2006, the Louisiana legislature passed a “trigger” ban – banning abortion with\nonly a limited exception to save a woman’s life – to take immediate effect should Roe v. Wade be\noverturned or a constitutional amendment be adopted to allow states to ban abortion. S.B. 33,\n2006 Leg., Reg. Sess. (La. 2006) (codified as LA. R.S. §§  40:1299.30, 14.87). The trigger ban\ncarries a criminal penalty of up to 10 years’ imprisonment “at hard labor” for a physician\nperforming an abortion. LA. R.S. §§ 40:1299.30D, 14:87D(1).\n153. Another law mandates that every woman undergo an ultrasound before an abortion,\neven when not medically necessary, and that she be required to listen to an oral description of the\nultrasound image. Id. §§ 40:1299.35.2B–D, 40:1299.35.6, 40:1299.35.12.\n154. Louisiana requires a two-trip, 24-hour waiting period for women, and further\nmandates that a physician – and not another medical professional – give certain state-mandated\ninformation designed to discourage abortion to his patient; violation of this provision carries\ncriminal penalties. Id. §§ 40:1299.35.2D(2), 40:1299.35.6, 40:1299.35.19.\n155. The Louisiana legislature prohibits public funding of abortion for victims of rape or\nincest unless the victim reports the act to law enforcement and certifies a statement of rape or\nincest that is witnessed by the physician. Id. §§ 40.1299.34.5, 40:1299.35.7.\n156. Physicians who provide for the “elective termination of an uncomplicated viable\npregnancy” are expressly excluded from malpractice reform provisions afforded to all other\nhealth care practitioners under the state’s medical malpractice protection laws. Id. §§\n40.1299.31–39A, 40:1299.41(K).\n157. The legislature has passed laws prohibiting insurance coverage of abortion in state\n44 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 45 of 112\nexchanges under the Affordable Care Act. Id. § 22:1014. Louisiana does not allow women to\nobtain insurance coverage for abortion even when a woman’s life is endangered or when the\npregnancy is a result of rape or incest. Id.\n158. The Louisiana legislature permits hospitals to refuse to accommodate the\nperformance of abortions. Id. § 40:1299.31–33. \n159. Louisiana has no law which prohibits a hospital from discriminating against a\nphysician applying for privileges there based on that physician’s status as an abortion provider.\nCompare TEX. OCC. CODE § 103.002(b).\n160. The effect of Act 620 is thus significantly different from admitting privileges\nrequirements in states where physicians are protected from discrimination. See, e.g., Cole, 790\nF.3d at 563; see also Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 598 n.13.  \nC. Drafting of Act 620\n161. Act 620 was modeled after similar laws which have had the result of closing abortion\nclinics in other states. On May 5, 2014, Ms. Dorinda Bordlee (“Bordlee”), the Vice President and\nExecutive Counsel of the Bio Ethics Defense Fund, an anti-abortion advocacy group, sent the\ndraft’s primary legislative sponsor, Representative Katrina Jackson (“Jackson”), an email\nregarding a similar statute passed in Texas that had “tremendous success in closing abortion\nclinics and restricting abortion access in Texas.”  (Doc. 191 at 200; Doc. 196-5 at 2; Doc. 196-10\nat 1.)37 Bordlee told Jackson that “[Act 620] follows this model.” (Doc. 191 at 200; Doc. 196-5 at\n37 Many of the Joint Exhibits mentioned in this section, including email exchanges to and\nfrom pro-life advocacy groups and others participating in the drafting of what came to be Act\n620, were the subject of Defendant’s Motion in Limine, (Doc. 95). Defendant argues that this\n45 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 46 of 112\n2; Doc. 196-10 at 1.)\n162. Evidence received demonstrates the coordination among advocacy groups, Jackson,\nand DHH employees regarding efforts to restrict abortion. (See, e.g., Doc. 191 at 199–202,\n211–13, 215–16, 220–21; JX 3, 6–16.)\n163. In a press release regarding Act 620 released on March 7, 2014, Jindal declared his\nposition that Act 620 was a reform that would “build upon the work . . . done to make Louisiana\nthe most pro-life state in the nation.” (PX 174 at 1; Doc. 191 at 224–27.) Jindal stated: \nPromoting a culture of life in Louisiana has been an important priority of mine\nsince taking office, and I am proud to support [Act 620] this legislative session. In\nthis state, we uphold a culture of life that values human beings as unique creatures\nwho were made by our Creator. [Act 620] will build upon all we have done the\npast six years to protect the unborn.\n(PX 174 at 1.)\n164. Indirectly referencing the legislation just summarized, Jackson is quoted in this press\nrelease as saying that Act 620 “will build on our past work to protect life in our state.” (Id. at 2.)\n165. Similarly, in her testimony before the Louisiana House Committee in support of Act\n620, Kliebert testified that Act 620 would strengthen DHH’s ability to protect “unborn children.”\n(Doc. 191; JX 140 at 1.)\n166. The talking points prepared for Secretary Kliebert by Representative Jackson’s office\nstated that DHH was “firmly committed to working with Representative Jackson and the\nevidence is legally irrelevant to the purpose of Act 620. For reasons stated in its ruling, (Doc.\n138), and reiterated in this Ruling’s Conclusions of Law, see infra Parts XI–XII, the Court\ndenied the motion. The Court finds that while this evidence is insufficient under Fifth Circuit\njurisprudence for Plaintiffs to meet their burden under the purpose prong of the undue burden\ntest, it is nonetheless relevant and admissible.   \n46 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 47 of 112\nLegislature to continue to work to protect the safety and well-being of Louisiana [women] and the\nmost vulnerable among us, unborn children.” (Doc. 191 at 222–23; see also JX 24 at 2–4.) \nD. Official Legislative History of Act 62038\n167. Act 620 (at the time known as HB 388) was considered by the House Health and\nWelfare Committee on March 9, 2014, and the Senate Health and Welfare Committee on May 7,\n2014. The House and Senate Committees heard extensive testimony regarding the purposes of\nproposed statute. (DX 119 at 1–30, 39–67.)\n168. More specifically, the House and Senate Committees heard testimony that the\nproposed statute was intended to safeguard the health and safety of women undergoing abortions\nin outpatient clinics in Louisiana. (Id.)\n169. For example, the House and Senate Committees heard testimony that:\n- Abortion carries the risk of serious complications that could require immediate\nhospitalization. (Id. at 3, 5.)\n- Women who experience abortion complications frequently rely on the care of\nemergency room physicians, who often must call on the assistance of a specialist\nin obstetrics or gynecology. (See id. at 4, 5, 8.)\n- “[M]ost emergency departments lack adequate on-call coverage for medical and\n38 The official legislative history, submitted as one document, (DX 119), contains the\nreports of the House and Senate as well as a transcript of various senators’ comments, each of\nwhich commence with their own page number. Thus, for the sake of easy location, this Court\ncites to the page number of the pdf document itself. Within Document Number 119, the House\nreport appears on pages 2 through 30, the Senate report on pages 33 through 67, and the\ntranscript of the Senate floor debate on pages 69 through 73.\n47 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 48 of 112\nsurgical specialists, including obstetricians and gynecologists.” (Id. at 48.)\n- The history of health and safety violations by Louisiana abortion clinics raises\nconcerns about the potential for serious abortion-related complications. (Id. 119 at\n10.)\n- Requiring outpatient abortion providers to have admitting privileges benefits the\nsafety of women seeking abortion and also enhances regulation of the medical\nprofession. (Id. at 3, 48.)\n- For instance, the admitting privileges requirement improves the “credentialing\nprocess” for physicians by “provid[ing] a more thorough evaluation mechanism of\nphysician competency than would occur otherwise.” (Id. at 48.)\n- The requirement also “acknowledges and enables the importance of continuity of\ncare” for an abortion patient. (Id.)\n- Additionally, the requirement “enhances inter-physician communication and\noptimizes patient information transfer and complication management.” (Id.)\n- Finally, the requirement “supports the ethical duty of care of the operating\nphysician to prevent patient abandonment.” (Id. at 3, 48.)\n- A virtually identical admitting privileges requirement in Texas had recently been\nupheld by the U.S. Fifth Circuit as a reasonable measure for achieving these health\nand safety goals. (Id. at 48.)\n- There was no obstacle preventing abortion providers from obtaining admitting\nprivileges at Louisiana hospitals. (Id. at 9 (testimony that one Louisiana abortion\nprovider already had admitting privileges).)\n48 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 49 of 112\n- Louisiana hospitals grant or deny admitting privileges “based entirely on [the \napplicant’s] medical training and experience.” (Id. at 50.)\n- Louisiana hospitals have recognized categories of staff membership to\naccommodate physicians who are expected to admit low numbers of patients for a\nvariety of reasons. (Id. at 50.)\n170. Additionally, the House and Senate Committees also heard testimony that, unlike\nphysicians performing surgical procedures in ambulatory surgical centers in Louisiana, physicians\nperforming abortions in outpatient clinics had not previously been required to have any kind of\nhospital privileges. The committees heard testimony explaining that the proposed statute was\ndesigned to close that loophole and thus achieve greater consistency in the overall regulation of\noutpatient surgical procedures in Louisiana. (See id. at 2–4 (House committee testimony\nregarding goal of achieving greater consistency with ASC regulations), 41–43 (Senate committee\ntestimony regarding same subject).)\n171. For example, the House and Senate Committees heard testimony that:\n- The Act was intended to bring outpatient abortion facilities in line with “the\nstandard that is currently in place for [ASCs] as set forth in Louisiana\nAdministrative Code, Chapter 45 … Section 4535.” (Id. at 4.)\n- The Act intended to “close a loophole” in Louisiana regulation by requiring\noutpatient abortion providers to have privileges comparable to those required for\nphysicians performing outpatient surgery in ASCs. (Id. at 41–42.)\n- The Act’s requirement of admitting privileges is consistent with requiring surgical\nprivileges for ASC physicians. (Id. at 49 (explaining that “the effect is the same\n49 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 50 of 112\nboth in terms of … the credentialing process itself and in the application of the\nstandards by the state”).)\n- In both cases, the privileges requirement is based on the “well-established\nprinciple … that a provider should not undertake a procedure unless he is qualified\nand able to take care of whatever complications there might be.” (Id. at 49.)\n172. The full House and Senate heard statements in support of HB 388 explaining that it\nwas intended to protect “the safety of women” and ensure that “every physician performing any\nsurgery, including abortions, does so in a prudent manner and with the best interest of each\nwoman’s health in mind,” (Id. at 34–35), and also that it was intended to safeguard “the lives and\nsafety of pregnant women who may experience short-term risk[s] of abortion, which can include\nhemorrhaging, uterine perforation, or infection,” (Id. at 48).\n173. The full House was informed that the proposed law tracked the Texas\nadmitting-privileges law, HB 2, which had been upheld as constitutional by the U.S. Fifth Circuit\nCourt of Appeals a week earlier. (Id. at 34–35 (referring to Abbott II).) \n174. The Senate approved one amendment to the proposed statute, concerning\nthe definition of admitting privileges, and rejected another amendment that would\nhave eliminated the 30-mile radius requirement. (Id. at 69–70.) \n175. The proposed statute passed both chambers, with 85 House members and 34 Senators\nvoting in favor, and 88 House members concurring in the Senate amendment. See\nhttps://www.legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=887948 (House final passage);\nhttps://www.legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=903997 (Senate final passage);\nhttps://www.legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=903981 (Senate amendment);\n50 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 51 of 112\nhttps://www.legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=906861 (House concurrence) (all\nlegislative websites last visited Aug. 24, 2015).\nVII.  The Purpose and Medical Need for and Reasonableness of Act 620\n176. The evidence introduced to show the purpose of Act 620 came in several forms. The\nPlaintiffs offered: (1) press releases, public statement, emails, and similar evidence produced by\npublic officials, lobbyists, advocacy groups and others involved or interested in the drafting and\npassage of Act 620; (2) the testimony of some of those involved in these communications; (3)\nLouisiana’s legislatively stated “longstanding policy . . . to protect the right to life of the unborn\nchild from conception by prohibiting abortion impermissible only because of the decisions of the\nUnited States Supreme Court . . . .,” La. R.S. § 40:1299.35.0; and (4) expert testimony  purporting\nto show two things: first, there is no medical need for Act 620 because legal abortion is safe, and\nsecond, that Act 620 is medically unreasonable in that Act 620 does not advance the health and\nsafety of women undergoing abortions. \n177. In support of her position, Defendant offered: (1) the text and legislative history of\nthe Act, including testimony considered during the legislature’s deliberations, and (2) expert\ntestimony at trial purporting to show that the  admitting privileges requirement is needed because\nof potential complications from abortions and that the Act is medically necessary and beneficial\nfor the health and safety of a woman undergoing an abortion.\n178. The Court carefully considered all the evidence introduced on this issue and makes\nthe following findings of fact: \n(A)  A purpose of the bill is to improve the health and safety of women undergoing an\n51 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 52 of 112\nabortion.39\n(B) Another purpose of the bill is to make it more difficult for abortion providers to\nlegally provide abortions and therefore restrict a woman’s right to an abortion.40\n(C) There is a dispute medically and scientifically as to whether Act 620 serves a\nlegitimate medical need and is medically reasonable.41\n(D) Legal abortions in Louisiana are very safe procedures with very few\ncomplications.42\n(E) The vast majority of women who undergo abortions in Louisiana are poor. (See,\ne.g., JX 124 at 2480; Doc. 191 at 190–91; Doc. 190 at 34.) As a result of that\npoverty, the burden of traveling farther to obtain an abortion would be significant,\n39 The Court relies primarily on the legislative history of the statute, (DX 119 at 1–30,\n39–67), for this finding. While the Court had serious concerns about the credibility and bias of\ndefense expert Dr. Damon Cudihy and Marier’s expertise  as it pertained to the subject of\nabortion practice, the Court forgoes a detailed analysis of this testimony for one simple reason.\nPursuant to binding jurisprudence, the Court must find that Act 620 meets the purpose prong of\nthe undue burden analysis based on the Court’s finding that there is medical uncertainty as to the\nhealth benefits of the legislation. See infra Parts XI–XII.\n40 The Court forgoes a detailed discussion of this evidence since, under Fifth Circuit law,\nAct 620 would fail the purpose prong of the undue burden test only if Act 620 “serve[s] no\npurpose other than to make abortions more difficult.” Cole, 790 F.3d at 586 (emphasis added)\n(quoting Casey, 505 U.S. at 900–01). Since the Court has found that one purpose of the Act is to\npromote the health and safety of women seeking an abortion, it need go no further. \n41 Plaintiffs and Defendant presented conflicting expert testimony on this issue. It is\nunnecessary to resolve this conflicting testimony since, under Fifth Circuit jurisprudence, the\nCourt must find that Act 620 meets the purpose prong of the undue burden analysis given the\nevidence showing medical uncertainty on the merits of the legislation. See infra Parts XI–XII.\n42 The Court was impressed with the expertise and credibility of Plaintiffs’ experts, Estes\nand Pressman, most especially Pressman. However, the Court foregoes a detailed discussion of\nthe testimony since,  under Fifth Circuit jurisprudence, the Court must find that Act 620 meets\nthe purpose prong of the undue burden analysis given the evidence showing medical uncertainty\non the merits of the legislation. See infra Parts XI–XII. \n52 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 53 of 112\nfall harder on these women than those who are not poor and cause a large number\nof these women to either not get an abortion, perform the abortions themselves, or\nhave someone who is not properly trained and licensed perform it.  (See, e.g., JX\n124 at 2480; Doc. 191 at 190–91; Doc. 190 at 34.)  \n(F) The medical benefits which would flow from Act 620 are minimal and are\noutweighed by the burdens which would flow from this legislation.43\n179. The relevance and weight of these factual findings in the context of the prevailing\nFifth Circuit test is discussed in more detail in this Ruling’s final substantive sections. See infra\nParts X–XI. \nVIII. Efforts of Doctors to Comply With Act 620 and the Results of Those Efforts    \nA. Doe 1 \n180. For over a year prior to his trial testimony on June 24, 2015, Doe 1 has been trying,\nin various ways, to gain active admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of Hope where\nhe performs abortions and thereby comply with Act 620. (Doc. 192 at 42–44.)\n181. The Court finds that Doe 1 is a well qualified physician and a credible witness. (See,\ne.g., Doc. 192 at 7–14; JX 111 ¶ 1; 116 ¶ 5.)\n182.  The Court finds that despite his good faith efforts to comply with Act 620, Doe 1 has\nfailed to get active admitting privileges at five different hospitals for reasons unrelated to his\n43 The burdens which would flow from Act 620 are discussed in more detail below. See\ninfra Part IX. The Court forgoes a discussion weighing these burdens against the benefits of the\nAct since such a weighing is not legally relevant under Fifth Circuit jurisprudence. See infra\nParts XI–XII.\n53 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 54 of 112\ncompetence. (See, e.g., JX 116 ¶ 27.)\n183. Doe 1 has attempted to get privileges at five separate nearby hospitals and, despite\nhis efforts and his qualifications, has not been given active admitting privileges at any of these\nhospitals, including University Health, Minden, North Caddo Regional (“North Caddo”),\nChristus, and Willis-Knighton. (See, e.g., Doc. 192 at 47–51.)\n184. Doe 1 contacted the director of the Family Medicine Department at University Health\nin Shreveport where he had done his residency in family medicine. Doe 1 was initially told that he\nwould be offered a job as a faculty member teaching sports medicine which would “take care of\nthe admitting privileges thing.” Doe 1 was told that the application forms for admitting privileges\nwould be forwarded to him. (Id. at 45; see also JX 186 ¶ 7.)\n185. When Doe did not get the application forms and inquired, he was told by the director\nof the department that he would not be offered a position because “there was some objection from\ncertain staff about [Doe 1] coming to work there because of where [he] work[ed], at Hope\nMedical.” (Doc. 192 at 44–45; see also JX 186 ¶ 7.)44\n186. The director suggested that he try with the OB/GYN Department but when that route\nwas explored, Doe 1 was advised by email that it would be “inappropriate” to have a family\nmedicine doctor on the OB/GYN staff. (Doc. 192 at 47.)\n187. Based on these communications, Doe 1 did not file a formal application for admitting\nprivileges to University. (Id.)\n188. When Pittman, Hope’s Administrator, made inquiries about admitting privileges to\n44 This testimony was objected to as hearsay, (Doc. 192 at 46), which objection was\noverruled for the reasons summarized above. See supra note 30.\n54 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 55 of 112\nNorth Caddo on behalf of Doe 1, she was told that they did not have the capacity for and could\nnot accommodate transfers. (JX 116 ¶ 22; see also Doc. 192 at 49.) Therefore, Doe 1 did not file a\nformal application. (Doc. 192 at 49; cf. JX 116 ¶ 22.)\n189. Doe 1 filed a formal application for privileges at Minden. (JX 50; Doc. 192 at\n50–51.) Minden’s Medical Staff Coordinator wrote to Doe 1 declining his application: “Since we\ndo not have a need for a satellite primary care physician at this time, I am returning your\napplication and check.” (JX 50 at 318; see also Doc. 192 at 50–51).\n190. While the Court, like Doe 1, does not understand the meaning of the stated reason for\ndeclining the application, it is clear that the denial of privileges is unrelated to the qualifications\nand competence of Doe 1. (See Doc. 192 at 51.)\n191. Doe 1’s efforts to get admitting privileges at Christus reads like a chapter in Franz\nKafka’s The Trial. (See, e.g., JX 71; Doc. 192 at 52–66.)\n192. Doe 1 submitted his application for courtesy privileges to Christus on July 25, 2014,\non a form provided by Christus. (JX 132 at 2772; JX 116 ¶ 23; Doc. 192 at 52.) Courtesy\nprivileges gives a physician with such privileges the ability to admit patients. (Doc. 192 at\n52–53.)\n193. On August 25, 2014, Christus asked for additional information, (JX 71 at 1254; see\nalso Doc. 192 at 54–55), which he provided on September 17, 2014, (JX 71 at 1267; JX 133; Doc.\n192 at 55–56).\n194.  Via a letter dated October 14, 2014, yet more information was sought from Doe 1 by\nChristus, (JX 71 at 1268; see also, e.g., Doc. 192 at 58–59), which he supplied on October 20,\n2014, (JX 71 at 1273; Doc. 192 at 59–60), and October 25, 2014, (JX 134 at 2802–03).\n55 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 56 of 112\n195. When Pittman called Christus to make an appointment for Doe 1 to get an\nidentification badge, also a requirement of the application process, an appointment was refused\nbecause, Pittman was told, Doe 1 had submitted the wrong kind of application and that he should\nbe submitting a “non-staff care giver” application. (Doc. 192 at 62; cf. JX 71 at 1268, 1270,\n1276.)\n196. On December 17, 2014, Doe 1 then received a letter stating that his application was\nincomplete because Doe 1 hadn’t gotten the badge (the same badge Christus would not give him\nan appointment to get) and because more than 90 days had elapsed since his application was\nsubmitted, the application was “deemed withdrawn.” (JX 71 at 1279; Doc 192 at 63.)\n197. In a follow up conversation initiated by Doe 1 and in a subsequent email from\nChristus, Doe 1 was told that he needed to file an application for non-staff care giver privileges, a\ntype of privilege that would not allow him to admit patients and therefore would not qualify as\n“active admitting privileges” under Act 620. (JX 190 at 3662; Doc. 192 at 63–66.)\n198. While there was never a formal denial of Doe’s application, Christus’s delays and\nfailure to formally act, as outlined above, constitutes a de facto denial of his application for the\nprivileges required by Act 620.\n199. Doe 1’s experience was similar when he applied for courtesy privileges at Willis-\nKnighton beginning on June 15, 2014. (JX 53; JX 116 ¶ 27; Doc. 192 at 67–78.) These privileges\nwould have allowed Doe 1 to admit patients. (Doc. 192 at 68–69.) \n200. Because of his Board Certification in addiction medicine and because Willis-\nKnighton has an addiction recovery center, Doe 1 filed his application for privileges as an\naddiction medicine specialist. (Id. at 70.)\n56 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 57 of 112\n201. Doe 1’s application was denied because he had not undergone a residency program in\naddiction medicine, despite his board certification in addiction medicine and even though there\nwas no residency program available when he got his board certification. (JX 51 at 508; Doc. 192\nat 72–73.)\n202. On February 1, 2015, Doe 1 re-submitted an application, this time as a Family\nPractice specialist. (JX 97 at 2069–2117; Doc. 192 at 73–74.)\n203. On March 11, 2015, Willis-Knighton requested information regarding documentation\nof “hospital admissions and management of patients 18 years old of age or older in the past 12\nmonths.” (JX 128; Doc. 192 at 75–76.)\n204. On March 24, 2015, Doe 1 provided the requested information. (JX 189; Doc. 192 at\n77–78.) Because of the nature of his practice, he had not admitted any patients in the last 12\nmonths, but he did provide detailed information about his training and procedures done during\nthat same time period. (Id.)\n205. Despite the lapse of more than eight months since his second application and more\nthan five months since he provided the information requested in support of that application,\nWillis-Knighton has neither approved nor denied his application. (See, e.g., id. at 78.) Under these\ncircumstances, the Court finds that this application has been de facto denied.\nB. Doe 2\n206. Currently, Doe 2 performs abortions at Bossier and Causeway Clinics. (Doc. 191 at\n17; JX 112 at 2216.)\n207. The Court finds Doe 2 to be a well qualified and competent physician and a credible\n57 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 58 of 112\nwitness. (Id. at 13–17; JX 112 ¶ 1; see also infra.)\n208. Doe 2 does not currently have active admitting privileges at a hospital within 30\nmiles of Bossier Clinic. (Doc. 191 at 19.)\n209. Doe 2 has been unsuccessful in his good faith efforts to get admitting active\nadmitting privileges within 30 miles of the Bossier Clinic. (See, e.g., Doc. 191.)\n210. Doe 2 worked as an Assistant Clinical Professor of Medicine at LSU Medical School,\nnow known as University Health, at various times for approximately 18 years total, leaving LSU\nin 2004. (Id. at 14–15.)\n211. While he was on staff at University and during the years in which he engaged in a\ngeneral OB/GYN practice, Doe 2 had admitting privileges at various hospitals. (Id. at 24, 95.)\n212. When he left the University staff in 2004, Doe 2 was given consulting privileges,\nwhich allow him to consult but not to admit patients. (Doc. 191 at 23–24, 84–88; JX 79 at\n1708–09; JX 185.)45\n213. Following the passage of Act 620, Doe 2 attempted to upgrade his privileges at\nUniversity to allow him to admit patients in order to comply with the requirements of the Act.\n(Doc. 191 at 24–25.)\n214. When he spoke to Dr. Lynne Groome (“Groome”), the head of the OB/GYN\nDepartment at University, about upgrading his privileges, he was told this would not happen\nbecause of his abortion practice. (Id. at 25–26; cf. JX 116 ¶ 27.) \n215. In his testimony before this Court, he thusly described his communication with\n45 While Doe 2 initially thought that these were called “courtesy privileges,” he corrected\nhis mistake on cross examination. (Doc. 191 at 23, 81–87; JX 185.)\n58 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 59 of 112\nGroome:\nQ.  What’s your understanding of why you were not able to upgrade your privileges at\nLSU?\nA.  Well, Dr. Groome told me that he was reluctant to even consider that, because it\nwas such a controversial topic, but he would take it to the Dean and ask, which he\ndid and he essentially said that you’re not going to go beyond your [clinical]\nprivileges.\nQ. Were you surprised by that response?\nA. No.\nQ. Why weren’t you surprised?\nA. Just because of the political nature of what I do and the controversy of what I do. \n(Id. at 25–26.)46\n216. During the summer of 2014, Doe 2 also applied for privileges at WKB. (Id. at\n26–27.)\n217. On August 11, 2014, the Department of OB/GYN and Pediatrics Performance Peer\nReview Panel (“PPRP”) at WKB wrote to Doe 2 asking for additional information: “In order for\nthe Panel to sufficiently assess your clinical competence, you will need to submit documentation,\nwhich should include operative notes and outcomes, of cases performed within the last 12 months\nfor the specific procedures you are requesting on the privilege request form.” (JX 144 at 3445–46;\nsee also, e.g., Doc. 191 at 29.)\n46 This testimony was objected to as hearsay. (Doc. 191 at 25.) For the same reasons\nsummarized above, see supra note 30, the objection was overruled.\n59 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 60 of 112\n218. After Doe 2 made information regarding his prior outpatient operations available to\nWKB, (Doc. 191 at 30), he received another letter from WKB dated November 19, 2014, stating\nin pertinent part: \nThe data [you] submitted supports the outpatient procedures you perform, but\ndoes not support your request for hospital privileges. In order for the panel to\nevaluate and make recommendations for hospital privileges [,] they must evaluate\npatient admissions and management, consultations and procedures performed.\nWithout this information your application remains incomplete and cannot be\nprocessed.\n(JX 89 at 1950; see also Doc. 191 at 30–31.)\n219. Because of the nature of his non-hospital based practice, Doe 2 was and is unable to\nprovide the requested information. (See, e.g., Doc. 191 at 29–31.) Thus, while Defendant is\ncorrect in arguing that Doe 2’s application has not been formally denied, (Doc. 201 at 11), Doe\n2’s application cannot and will never be approved according to WKP’s own letter, (JX 89; see\nalso, e.g., JX 144 at 3445–46).\n220. As explained by Doe 2, “You know, they haven’t formally denied me. . . . I’m in a\nCatch-22 basically. I can’t provide information I don’t have.” (Doc. 191 at 79–80.)\n221. This situation mirrors Doe 1’s experience with three other Willis-Knighton-branded\nentities. Specifically, the Court also notes that although Doe 1, in response to a similar letter from\nWK Medical Center, WK South, and WK Pierremont, (JX 128), formally responded showing he\nhad not had any hospital admissions in the last 12 months, (JX 189 at 3579; Doc. 192 at 77–78),\nWK still has not denied or approved his application, (Doc. 192 at 78).\n222. The Court finds that, under these circumstances, Doe 2’s inability to gain privileges\nat WKB are unrelated to his competence and that his application to WKB has been de facto\n60 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 61 of 112\ndenied. \n223. While Defendant argues that Willis-Knighton’s inaction is related to Dr. Doe 2's\ncompetence because, due to the nature of his practice, he cannot demonstrate “current clinical\ncompetence” (Doc. 201 at 11), the Court is not persuaded. The reality is different. Doe 2, a Board\nCertified OB/GYN who spent many years as an Assistant Clinical Professor at LSU Medical\nSchool and who, by Willis-Knighton’s admission, has demonstrated his ability regarding\noutpatient surgeries, is in what he correctly describes a “Catch-22” created by a combination of\nthe Act’s requirement and the nature of his practice as an abortion provider.\n224. Because Doe 2 also practices at Causeway Clinic in Metairie, he applied for\nadmitting privileges at Tulane, within 30 miles of Causeway. (See, e.g., Doc. 191 at 32–35, 230;\nJC 180.)\n225. While Defendant has argued that the admitting privileges requirement is only about\ninsuring competency of doctors who perform abortions and the process of gaining admitting\nprivileges is neutral and devoid of considerations of the political, religous and social hostility\nagainst abortion, the email exchanges between Doe 2 and Dr. A at Tulane demonstrate a very\ndifferent reality, even in a metropolitan, university-based hospital. (JX 169–78;47 see also Doc.\n191 at 49–54.)\n226. In this exchange, Dr. A first feels the need to discuss Doe 2’s request for privileges\n“with our lobbyists.” (JX 169.) Because Doe 2 is a “low/no provider” in hospitals in the New\nOrleans area, Dr. A states: “This is truly a rock and a hard place.” (JX 172.) When Doe 2\nexpresses frustration with the lack of success in the application process, Dr. A states: “This is just\n47 These exhibits, being jointly submitted, were admitted into evidence. (Doc. 191 at 54.)\n61 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 62 of 112\nridiculous. I can’t believe the state has come to this.” (JX 174; cf. JX 170.) Dr. A continues: “I am\nworking on an approach where you would get admitting privileges only for your patients . . . .”\n(JX 175.) When a proposed solution is found and Doe 2 expresses doubt that this will meet the\nrequirements of the law, Dr. A responds: “Technically, you will have admitting privileges. Isn’t\nthat what the law says?” (JX 177). When discussing the need for a covering physician, Dr. A\nclarifies some of the problems surrounding Doe 2’s application: “There were a few faculty who\nwere not comfortable with covering; they were also concerned that ‘Tulane as back up for an\nabortion clinic might not help our referrals.’ Given this concern, Dr. B will cover for you\nformally.” (JX 178.)\n227. When privileges were finally granted by Tulane, Doe 2 was notified by Dr. A that the\nproposed privileges would have “the following limitations: ‘Admissions of patients from the\nphysician’s clinical practice with complications of first and second trimester abortions with\nreferral of those patients to an attending physician on the Tulane staff credentialed for OB/Gyn\nprivileges who has agreed to provide for such care for the physician’s patients.’” (JX 181; see\nalso Doc. 191 at 57, 60–61.)\n228. Consistent with this email, Tulane’s formal grant circumscribed Doe 2’s privileges in\nthese terms: “Admission of patients from the physician’s clinical practice . . . with referral of\nthose patients to an attending physician on staff at [Tulane Medical Center] credentialed for\nOb/Gyn privileges who has agreed to provide care for the physician’s patients at TMS.” (JX 183\nat 3652–3; see also Doc. 191 at 33, 55–58.) \n229. The Parties disagree as to whether these admitting privileges qualify as “active\nadmitting privileges” within the meaning of Act 620. (Compare Doc. 200 at 46–47, with Doc. 196\n62 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 63 of 112\nat 19–20.)\n230. Defendant has filed an affidavit in which she states that the admitting privileges\ngranted to Dr. Doe 2 by Tulane “are sufficient to comply with the Act.” (JX 191 at 3668; see also\nDoc. 196 at 20; Doc. 200 at 48.) \n231. Plaintiffs argue:\nAlthough Secretary Kliebert has taken the position that Dr. John Doe 2’s\nprivileges at Tulane satisfy Act 620, Dr. John Doe 2 has concerns that her\nposition is inconsistent with the plain language of the Act, which requires that\n‘the physician is a member in good standing of the medical staff of a hospital . . .\nwith the ability to admit a patient and to provide diagnostic and surgical services\nto such patient.’ . . . Based on Tulane’s letters, Dr. John Doe 2 cannot provide\ndiagnostic and surgical services to patients admitted to Tulane as required by the\nplain language of the statute.\n(Doc. 196 ¶ 47  at 20 (citing to Doc. 193 at 123; Doc. 191 at 38–40).) \n232. Plaintiff further argues:\nDr. John Doe 2 has concerns that the position Secretary Kliebert has taken\nregarding his privileges at Tulane during the course of this litigation may change\nat a later date. As a result, he will not risk his medical license by performing\nabortions in Metairie if Act 620 is allowed to take effect.\n(Id. ¶ 48 at 20 (citing Doc. 191 at 38–40; JX 191).) \n233. Defendant makes two counters: \nPlaintiffs’ ‘concerns’ about the Defendant’s determination that Dr. Doe\n2’s privileges at Tulane satisfy the Act are legally irrelevant, because\nDefendant is the state official charged with interpretation and enforcement\nof the Act. Furthermore, Plaintiffs’ assertions regarding the nature of Dr.\nDoe 2’s privileges at Tulane Medical Center are clearly wrong because\nthey are contradicted by the overwhelming weight of the evidence.\n(Doc. 201 ¶ 47 at 12.)\n63 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 64 of 112\n234. Defendant further argues: \nPlaintiffs’ ‘concerns’ that the Defendant’s determination that Dr. Doe 2’s Tulane\nprivileges satisfy the Act “may change at a later date” are legally irrelevant.\nPlaintiffs have produced no evidence indicating that any such “change” in\nposition by Defendant with respect to Dr. Doe 2’s Tulane privileges is likely to\noccur. The evidence therefore does not show that the Act or the Defendant pose\nany credible, concrete threat to Dr. Doe 2’s ability to continue his practice at\nCauseway clinic. If Dr. Doe 2 voluntarily ceases to perform abortions at\nCauseway because of his fears that the Defendant (or some future Secretary) will\nchange her position, that cessation would be attributable to Dr. Doe 2 alone and\nnot to the Act itself. \n(Id. ¶ 48 at 12.)\n235. In light of Defendant’s argument, so as to resolve this dispute and determine whether\nDoe 2 has “active admitting privileges” at Tulane, the Court must first determine whether it is\nbound by the interpretation given by Defendant and, if not, compare the privileges granted by\nTulane with Act 620’s definition of “active admitting privileges.”\n236. Whatever discretion the Secretary may have in a law’s enforcement, no deference is\nowed to an opinion contrary to the law’s unambiguous and plain meaning. See, e.g., Util. Air\nRegulatory Grp. v. EPA, 134 S. Ct. 2427, 2442, 189 L. Ed. 2d 372 (2014) (observing that “an\nagency interpretation that is inconsisten[t] with the design and structure of the statute as a whole .\n. . does not merit deference” (alteration in original) (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks\nomitted)); Talk Am., Inc. v. Mich. Bell Tel. Co., 564 U.S. 50, 131 S. Ct. 2254, 2260–61, 180 L.\nE.d 2d 96 (2011) (reaffirming the interpretive principle that only “[i]n the absence of any\nunambiguous statute or regulation” does a court turn to an agency’s interpretation”); Robinson v.\nShell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 341, 117 S. Ct. 843, 846, 136 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1997) (emphasizing that\na court’s inquiry “must cease if the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is\n64 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 65 of 112\ncoherent and consistent” and explaining that“[t]he plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is\ndetermined by reference to the language itself, the specific context in which that language is used,\nand the broader context of the statute as a whole” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Quite\nsimply, if the legislative intent is clear, as evidenced by the use of an unambiguous word, “that is\nthe end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to th[at]\nunambiguously expressed intent.” Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842–43,\n104 S. Ct. 2778, 2781, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984) (“Chevron”); see also Miss. Poultry Ass’n v.\nMadigan, 992 F.2d 1359, 1363 (5th Cir. 1993) (quoting id.).\n237. If the relevant statute is ambiguous, however, at least some deference is owed. See\nNat’l Cable & Telecommc’ns Ass’n v. Brand X Internet Servs., 545 U.S. 967, 980, 125 S. Ct.\n2688, 2699, 162 L. Ed. 2d 820 (2005). But such deference is only accorded if the statute is truly\n“ambiguous” regarding the precise “question at issue” and if the agency’s interpretation is a\n“reasonable” and hence “permissible construction of the statute” at hand. Orellana-Monson v.\nHolder, 685 F.3d 511, 517 (5th Cir. 2012); see also, e.g., Siew v. Holder, 742 F.3d 603, 607 n.27\n(5th Cir. 2014) (citing id.); United States v. Baptiste, 34 F. Supp. 3d 662, 670 (W.D. Tex. 2014)\n(same). Thus, even if the pertinent statute is ambiguous, an agency’s interpretation may be denied\n“controlling weight” if “arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.” Rodriguez-\nAvalos v. Holder, 788 F.3d 444, 449 (5th Cir. 2015) (quoting Orellana-Monson, 685 F.3d at 517).\n238. Critically, as federal courts are bound to “interpret a state statute as that state’s courts\nwould construe it,” Newman, 305 F.3d at 696, the same type of measured deference is afforded to\nagency interpretations by this state’s courts. Compare Silva-Trevino v. Holder, 742 F.3d 197,\n199–200 (5th Cir. 2014), with Zeringue v. State Dep’t of Public Safety, 467 So. 2d 1358, 1361\n65 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 66 of 112\n(La. Ct. App. 1985). Like their federal counterparts, Louisiana state agencies are “entitled to\ndeference regarding . . .  interpretation and construction of the rules and regulations that . . .\n[they] promulgate[].” Women’s & Children’s Hosp. v. State, 2007 1157 (La. App. 1 Cir.\n02/08/08); 984 So. 2d 760, 768–69; see also Oakville Cmty. Action Grp. v. La. Dep’t of Envtl.\nQuality, 2005 1365 (La. App. 1 Cir. 5/5/06); 935 So. 2d 175, 186 (La. Ct. App. 2006) (“A state\nagency is charged with interpreting its own rules and regulations and great deference must be\ngiven to the agency’s interpretation.”) \n239. However, as with Chevron, the statute itself must be ambiguous for such respect to\nbe accorded. Clark v. Bd. of Comm’rs, 422 So. 2d 247, 251 (La. Ct. App. 1982) (“[A]lthough an\nagency’s interpretation of a statute under which it operates is entitled to some deference, such\ndeference is constrained by the court’s obligation to honor the clear meaning of a statute, as\nrevealed by its language, purpose and history.”); cf. Comm-Care Corp. v. Bishop, 96-1711 (La.\n07/01/97); 696 So. 2d 969, 973 (“The meaning and intent of a law is to be determined by\nconsideration of the law in its entirety and all other laws on the same subject matter, and a\nconstruction should be placed on the provision in question which is consistent with the express\nterms of the law and with the obvious intent of the lawmaker in enacting it.”). \n240. Moreover, again as with a federal statute, “agency[] interpretations” lose any\npersuasive value, forfeiting any right to judicial deference, if “arbitrary, capricious or manifestly\ncontrary to its rules and regulation.” In re Recovery I, 93-0441 (La. App. 1 Cir. 04/08/94); 635\nSo. 2d 690, 696; see also, e.g., Doctors Hosp. of Augusta v. Dep’t of Health & Hosps., 2013 1762\n(La. App. 1 Cir. 09/17/14); 2014 La. App. Unpub. LEXIS 481, at *19–20, 2014 WL 4658202, at\n*7 (refusing to accord any deference to an interpretation by the same agency here, deeming it “an\n66 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 67 of 112\nabuse of discretion” that effectively rewrote the relevant statute); Bowers v. Firefighters’ Ret.\nSys., 2008-1268 (La. 03/17/09); 6 So. 3d 173, 176 (“Under the arbitrary and capricious standard,\nan agency decision is entitled to deference in its interpretation of its own rules and regulations;\nhowever, it is not entitled to deference in its interpretation of statutes and judicial decisions.”\n(emphasis added)).\n241. The Court finds that Defendant’s interpretation of Act 620 is contradicted by its plain\nlanguage. Expressly and unambiguously, the statute defines “active admitting privileges” to\ninclude “the ability to admit a patient and to provide diagnostic and surgical services to such\npatient consistent with the requirements of Paragraph (A)(1) of this Subsection [requiring a\nphysician performing abortions to be licensed and have completed or be enrolled in an OB/GYN\nor family residency program].” LA. R.S. § 40:1299.35.2A(2)(a).48\n242. Because the validity of Defendant’s interpretation arose during trial, the Court asked\nthe following question to Marier, Defendant’s expert witness, a physician who helped draft Act\n620, (Doc. 193 at 94): “And I understood you to say that the doctor, in order to meet Act 620\nwould have to - - would not have to be able to perform all diagnostic and surgical services, but\nwould have to perform some diagnostic and surgical services. Did I understand that correctly?”\n(Doc. 193 at 123 (emphasis added).) To this question, Marier answered: “Yes. Yes, Your Honor.”\n(Id.)\n243. Because Doe 2’s privileges are limited to “admission of patients” with the obligation\nto refer his patient to a “Tulane staff Ob/Gyn” for surgery and other kinds of treatment as well as\n48 As already noted, see supra note 2, the text of Act 620 can be found in a joint exhibit.\n(JX 115.)\n67 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 68 of 112\ndiagnostic services, this arrangement does not allow Doe 2 to perform any (let alone “some”)\ndiagnostic, surgical or other kinds of treatment himself. Regardless of that fact that Tulane has\nchosen to label him an “admitting physician,” (JX 184), he cannot “provide diagnostic and\nsurgical services,” and Act 620 expressly defines “active admitting privileges” as encompassing\nthe ability to do so, LA. R.S. § 40:1299.35.2A(2)(a). Hence, Doe 2’s privileges do not and cannot\nmeet the plain language of Act 620. \n244. Here, as Defendant’s own expert testified and as the statute’s plain meaning makes\nclear, the Secretary’s interpretation flies in the face of the law’s basic text. The words are clear,\ntheir meaning patent, and, under these circumstances, the Defendant’s interpretation is not\nentitled to deference. “It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say\nwhat the law is.” Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 177, 2 L. Ed. 60 (1803); see, e.g., Harrah’s\nBossier City Inv. Co., LLC v. Bridges, 2009-1916 (La. 05/11/10); 41 So. 3d 438, 449 (“Although\ncourts may give due consideration to the administrative construction of a law, we are certainly not\nbound by them.”); Salazar-Regino v. Rominski, 415 F.3d 436, 448 (5th Cir. 2005) (citing this\nmaxim in the context of weighing the reasonableness of an agency’s particular interpretation);\nSexton v. Panel Processing, Inc., 754 F.3d 332, 336 (6th Cir. 2014) (rejecting an agency\ninterpretation as contrary to the statutory language as interpreted). \n245. The Court also notes that the Defendant’s interpretation allowing (and, in the case of\nDr. Doe 2 and Tulane, requiring) the abortion provider to turn over the actual care of the patient\nto another doctor, flies in the face of one of Act 620’s main purposes and purported medical\nbenefits: “continuity of care,” the ability of a the abortion provider to treat his patient in the\n68 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 69 of 112\nhospital if admission to the hospital is necessary.  (See, e.g., Doc. 193 at 21–23; Doc. 200 ¶¶ 91 at\n98–101.)\n246.  While Defendant is correct that Secretary Kliebert is the person charged with\nenforcing this provision, it is also true that the Secretary of DHH often changes every few years.49\n(Doc. 191 at 198–99, 195–96.) \n247. It is also true that the new Secretary may disagree with her predecessor and reverse\ncourse on her current interpretation of Act 620.50 \n248. The Court finds that Doe 2 has legitimate concerns about relying on the declaration\nof Defendant to practice as an abortion provider if Act 620 were to go into effect.\n249. More importantly, the Court finds that Doe 2 does not have active admitting\nprivileges within the meaning of Act 620 at a hospital within 30 miles of Causeway Clinic. \n49 Indeed, in the wake of the recent gubernatorial election, Doctor Rebekah Gee has\nbecome DHH’s new head.\n50 At the time, Kliebert did not even say she will bind herself to this interpretation during\nher time in office. While not directly relevant to this matter, the Court notes that in a recent case,\nthis same agency has submitted multiple inconsistent declarations and abruptly changed legal\npositions without much  explanation. Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, Inc. v. Kliebert, No. 15-\ncv-00565-JWD-SCR, 2015 WL 6551836, at *8–9, *33, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 146988, at\n*27–29, *109–10 (M.D. La. Oct. 29, 2015). Though these inconsistencies do not appear in this\ncase, this Court may take judicial notice of its own public docket. FED. R. EVID. 201; see, e.g.,\nEduMoz, LLC v. Republic of Mozambique, 968 F. Supp. 2d 1041, 1049 (C.D. Cal. 2013);\nRichardson v. Monaco (In re Summit Metals, Inc.), 477 B.R. 484, 488 n.1 (Bankr. D. Del. 2012); \nLeBlanc v. Salem (In re Mailman Steam Carpet Cleaning Corp.), 196 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1999).   \n69 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 70 of 112\nC. Doe 3\n250. Doe 3 currently has admitting privileges at the WKB and Christus, both of which are\nwithin 30 miles of Hope Clinic where he performs abortions. (Doc. 190 at 21–22, 120, 148–49;\nJX 188 ¶ 6; JX 116 ¶ 18.)\n251. The Court finds that Doe 3 is a well qualified physician and a credible witness. (See,\ne.g., JX 188 ¶ 1; Doc. 190 at 109–11.)\n252. Doe 3’s current privileges at Christus require him to admit approximately 50 patients\nper year. (Doc. 190 at 150–52; JX 59.)\n253. Doe 3 has had admitting privileges at Christus since the 1990’s and at WKB since\nlate 1997 or early 1998. (Doc. 190 at 120–21.)\n254. Doe 3 uses his admitting privileges primarily in connection with his busy obstetrics\npractice delivering babies and, to a lesser extent to his private practice in gynecology, not because\nof his work at Hope Clinic. (Id. at 124, 147; see also JX 188 ¶ 7.)\n255. As a result of his fears of violence and harassment, Doe 3 has credibly testified that if\nhe is the last physician performing abortion in either the entire state or in the northern part of the\nstate, he will not continue to perform abortions. (Doc. 190 at 174–76; see also, e.g., JX 188 ¶¶\n10–11.)\nD. Doe 4\n256. Doe 4 performs abortions only at Causeway in Metairie. (See, e.g., JX 114  ¶ 1; Doc.\n168-5 at 8.)  \n70 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 71 of 112\n257. He does not currently have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of that\nclinic. (Doc. 191 at 18.)\n258. Doe 4 testified by deposition, (Doc. 168-5), and so the Court did not have the\nopportunity to directly measure his demeanor. However, the Court finds that Doe 4 is a well\nqualified physician, (See, e.g., JX 114 ¶ 1; Doc. 168-5 at 5–6, 9, 12), and that his testimony is\ncredible and consistent with the other testifying doctors who perform abortions. \n259. On August 6, 2014, Dr. John Doe 4 applied for admitting privileges at\nOchsner-Kenner Medical Center (“Ochsner”). (JX 57 at 762–808; see also Doc. 168-5 at 16–17.) \n260. Doe 4 chose to apply to Ochsner because he knew a physician there who agreed to\nprovide coverage for him. (Doc. 168-5 at 17.) Ochsner was the only hospital where Doe 4 knew a\nphysician who would cover for him and who met the hospital’s criteria to be a covering\nphysician. (Id. at 85, 109–10.)\n261. Ochsner requested additional information, which Doe 4 provided, (JX 98 at 2118;\nDoc. 121 at 3–4; JX 60 at 824), but he has not received a response at this time. (Doc. 168-5 at 17.)\n262. Doe 4 did not apply for admitting privileges at Touro Infirmary or LSU New Orleans\nbecause both hospitals required Doe 4 to find an OB/GYN to cover for him, which Doe 4 has\nbeen unable to do. (Id. at 23.)\n263. The Court finds that, despite a good faith effort to gain admitting privileges at a\nhospital within 30 miles of where he performs abortions, and given the fact that it has been well\nover a year since he applied for privileges with no response, the Court finds that Doe 4’s inability\nto meet the requirements of Act 620 is unrelated to his competence and his request for privileges\nhas been de facto denied.\n71 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 72 of 112\nE. Doe 5\n264. Doe 5 performs abortions at two facilities: Woman Health’s in New Orleans and\nDelta in Baton Rouge. (See, e.g., Doc. 168-6 at 4; JX 109 ¶ 7.) \n265. Like Doe 4, Doe 5 testified by deposition, and this Court hence did not have the\nopportunity to directly measure his demeanor. However, in reviewing his deposition and related\ndocumentation, (See, e.g., Doc. 168-6; JX 109), the Court finds the testimony to be credible and\nconsistent with the other testifying doctors who perform abortions. \n266. The Court finds that Doe 5 has active admitting privileges at Hospital C, a hospital\nwithin 30 miles of the Women’s Clinic in New Orleans, but that he has been unable to get\nadmitting privileges within 30 miles of Delta. (See, e.g., JX 109 ¶ 32–5.) \n267. On July 24, 2014, Doe 5 received admitting privileges at Hospital C, which is within\n30 miles of Women’s Clinic where he performs abortions. (Doc. 168-4 at 25–26; Doc. 168-6 at\n11; JX 109 ¶ 34.)\n268. The Parties have stipulated that Doe 5’s privileges at Hospital C are “active admitting\nprivileges” as defined in Act 620. (Doc. 176; Doc. 168-4 at 26; Doc. 168-6 at 11–13.)\n269. Doe 5 does not currently have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of\nDelta in Baton Rouge. (See, e.g., Doc. 168-6 at 22; JX 109 ¶ 23.) \n270. Doe 5 has applied for admitting privileges at three hospitals in the Baton Rouge area:\nWoman’s Hospital in April or May of 2014 and Lane Regional Medical Center and Baton Rouge\nGeneral Medical Center in July of 2014. (Doc. 168-6 at 11; JX 109 ¶¶ 32–33.)\n72 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 73 of 112\n271. Doe 5 has been unable to find a local physician who is willing to provide coverage\nfor him when he is not in Baton Rouge, which all three hospitals require. (JX 109 ¶¶ 32–33; Doc.\n51; Doc. 168-6 at 11–12.)\n272. The Court finds that Doe 5, despite good faith efforts to meet the requirements of Act\n620, has been unable to do so in the Baton Rouge area for a period of well over a year for reasons\nunrelated to his competence. Under these circumstances, while his applications have not been\nfinally acted upon and are therefore technically “pending,” the Court finds that they have been de\nfacto denied.\nF. Doe 6\n273. Doe 6 is a Board Certified OB/GYN with 48 years of experience who is the Medical\nDirector of Woman’s Clinic in New Orleans and Delta Clinic in Baton Rouge. (JX 168 ¶ 1; see\nalso JX 109 ¶ 8.)\n274. Doe 6 provided his testimony by declaration, (JX 168), and so the Court did not have\nthe opportunity to directly measure his demeanor. However, in reviewing his Declaration, the\nCourt finds the testimony to be credible and consistent with the other testifying doctors who\nperform abortions in Louisiana.\n275. While Doe 6 is Medical Director at both Women’s and Delta, “[d]ue to [his] age and\nthe demands of traveling back and forth between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, along with [his]\nprivate gynecology practice in New Orleans, [he is] no longer able to provide abortion[s] in Baton\nRouge.” (JX 168 ¶ 3; see also JX 109 ¶ 8.)\n73 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 74 of 112\n276. As a result, Doe 6 ceased performing abortions at Delta in Baton Rouge in April of\n2012, leaving only Doe 5 performing abortions at that facility. (JX 168 ¶ 3; see also JX 109 ¶ 9.)\n277. Doe 6 does not currently have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of\nWomen’s Clinic or Delta Clinic. (JX 168 ¶¶ 15, 21.)\n278. From approximately 1973 to 2005, when he had an OB/GYN practice, Doe 6 had\nadmitting privileges at various hospitals in New Orleans. (Id. ¶ 13.) As his private practice\nbecame solely a gynecology practice, and due to the low rate of abortion complications, he was\nunable to meet the hospitals’ requirements to admit a minimum number of patients each year.\n(Id.) Doe 6 also did not need admitting privileges because he was not admitting patients to the\nhospital. (Id.) Consequently, when his admitting privileges expired, he did not apply to renew\nthem. (Id.) \n279. Doe 6 contacted Tulane about the possibility of obtaining admitting privileges and\nwas told not to bother applying because he would not be granted privileges, as he had not had\nadmitting privileges at any hospital since 2005. (JX 168 ¶ 12.)51 Defendant argues that this\ntestimony is inconsistent with that of Doe 2, who was able to get courtesy privileges at Tulane.\n(Doc. 201 at 14.) Especially given Doe 6’s age and other differences in the professional\ncircumstances of these two doctors, (Compare JX ¶ 8, and JX 168 ¶ 13, with Doc. 191 at 14–16,\n22–23), this assertion is not supported and unpersuasive. In addition, Doe 6’s limited privileges,\nlike Doe 2’s, do not meet the requirements of Act 620, read and construed as enacted. (See supra\nPart VIII.)\n51 While Defendant argues that this testimony is hearsay, (Doc. 201 at 14), Defendant did\nnot make this objection prior to or at trial. Even if the objection would have been made, it would\nhave been overruled for the same reasons as her other similar objections. See supra note 30.\n74 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 75 of 112\n280. Prior to September 1, 2014, Doe 6 applied for admitting privileges at East Jefferson\nHospital in New Orleans, which is within 30 miles of Women’s Clinic. (JX 109 ¶¶ 31–33; JX 168\n¶ 15.) On September 17, 2014, East Jefferson requested additional information, which he then\nprovided. (Doc. 51 at 2.) Since that time, no action has been taken. (Id.; see also, e.g., JX 168 ¶\n15.) That application, now pending for over a year, is considered by the Court to have been de\nfacto denied.\n281. Doe 6 testified that he did not apply to other hospitals within 30 miles of Women’s\nClinic because, due to the nature of his practice as an abortion provider, he did not admit a\nsufficient number of patients to receive active admitting privileges. (JX 168 ¶ 11.)\nG. Post-Hearing Updates\n282. On September 17, 2015, the Court requested that Plaintiffs update the Court on or\nbefore September 24, 2015, on the status of the admitting privileges of the doctors and, if there\nwere any changes, to provide the details of same. (Doc. 206.) \n283. By letter of September 25, 2015, the Plaintiffs informed the Court and Defendants\nthat, after making inquiries, they were unaware of any material changes in the status of the\napplications of Does 1–6. (Doc. 209.) \n284. At a telephone status conference of September 28, 2015, this letter was received into\nevidence without objection as JX 193. (Doc. 210.)\n75 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 76 of 112\nIX. Effects of Act 620\nA. The Effect of Act 620 on Does 1-6 \n285. The number and location of doctors and clinics providing abortions varies widely\nfrom state to state. The effect of an admitting privileges requirement on those providers and the\nconcomitant effect on women’s right to an abortion has also varied state to state.52\n286. Before the passage of Act 620, doctors performing abortions in Louisiana were not\nrequired to and, for their practices, did not need to have admitting privileges at any hospital, let\nalone a nearby hospital, in order to safely provide services for their patients. (Doc. 190 at 25,\n36–37, 39, 127, 197–98; Doc. 191 at 46; Doc. 195 at 32; JX 135 at 2804; JX 110 ¶ 7; JX 168 ¶ 8.)\n287. As summarized above, at the time Act 620 was passed, only one of the six doctors\nperforming abortions, Doe 3, had admitting privileges at a hospital and he maintained these\nadmitting privileges for years in order to facilitate his general OB/GYN practice which was and is\nunrelated to that portion of his practice performing abortions at Hope.\n288. Since the passage of Act 620, all five remaining doctors have attempted in good faith\nto comply with Act 620. All five have attempted to get admitting privileges at a hospital within 30\nmiles of where they perform abortions. All five have made formal applications to at least one\nnearby hospital and three of the five doctors have filed applications at multiple hospitals within\nthirty miles. \n52 Compare, e.g., Jackson Women’s Health v. Currier, 760 F.3d 448 (5th Cir. 2014)\n(“Currier”) (where the admitting privileges statute was found to place an undue burden on the\nconstitutionally protected right to an abortion), petition for cert. filed, No. 14-997 (filed February\n19, 2015), with Cole, 790 F.3d at 563 (where, at least as to the facial challenge, the plaintiffs\nwere found to have failed to establish a constitutional violation).\n76 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 77 of 112\n289. Two of the doctors, Does 2 and 5, perform abortions in two separate cities and thus,\neach had to apply at hospitals in two different locales.\n290. Based on a careful review of the evidence, the Court finds that, notwithstanding the\ngood faith efforts of Does 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 to comply with the Act by getting active admitting\nprivileges at a hospital within 30 miles of where they perform abortions, they have had very\nlimited success for reasons related to Act 620 and not related to their competence.\n291. The five doctors have filed thirteen separate formal applications at nearby hospitals.\nIn only one of those cases–Doe 5 at Hospital C53–were active admitting privileges granted. In\nanother case, that of Doe 2 at Tulane, he was given admitting privileges that do not comport with\nthe plain language of Act 620.  \n292. Of the thirteen formal applications filed, only one has been frankly denied, the\napplication of Doe 1 at Minden.\n293. The remaining ten applications have never been finally acted upon because the doctor\napplying, given the nature of his practice as an abortion provider, either cannot provide the\ninformation required or the information has been provided and the application remains in limbo\nfor undisclosed reasons. In almost every instance, more than a year has passed since the original\napplications were filed.54 \n53 It is noteworthy that Hospital C, a hospital in a major metropolitan area and not a party\nto this action, is so concerned about the ramifications of having its identity publically revealed,\nthat it requested that it be named only through a pseudonym and, with the consent of all the\nParties, this was allowed. See supra Part V.E.\n54 As of September 25, 2015, the status of “pending” applications is unchanged. (Doc.\n209.)\n77 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 78 of 112\n294. Defendant argues that where these applications are  “pending,” the applications have\nnot been denied and therefore Plaintiffs have failed to prove that Act 620 has caused the failure of\nthese doctors to get admitting privileges. \n295. The Court disagrees. Because Louisiana has no statutorily prescribed time limit\nwithin which a hospital must act on a physician’s application, see supra Part V.D, a hospital can\neffectively deny the application by simply not acting upon it. Given the length of time involved in\nthese applications, the Court finds that this is precisely what has occurred here. \n296. Doe 3 has been threatened as a result of his work at Hope Clinic. (See, e.g., JX 113 ¶\n3.)  Last year, anti-abortion activists from outside Louisiana left fliers on neighbors’ mailboxes\ncalling him an abortionist and saying they wanted to convert him to Jesus. (Doc. 190 at 108–09;\nsee also JX 113 ¶ 3.)\n297. These individuals also approached Doe 3’s regular medical practice patients as they\ntried to enter his office, requiring the building security officers to escort the activists off the\npremises. (Doc. 190 at 109; see also JX 113 ¶ 3.) These individuals told Doe 3’s patients that he\nkilled babies and that they should not see him. (Doc. 190 at 109.)\n298. Doe 3, the only abortion doctor who had privileges at the time Act 620 was passed,\n(See, e.g., JX 116 ¶ 18), fears that, if the other Louisiana abortion providers are not able to obtain\nadmitting privileges, he will become an even greater target for anti-abortion violence. (See, e.g.,\nJX 113 ¶¶ 3–7.) He specifically testified that “all [these individuals] have to do is eliminate [him]\nas they have Dr. Tiller and some of the other abortion providers around the country” to eliminate\nabortion entirely in Northern Louisiana. (Doc. 190 at 174–75.)\n78 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 79 of 112\n299. Doe 3 is also concerned that such individuals could “cause a lot of other . . . problems\nthat would affect [his] ability to perform the rest of [his] practice.” (Id. at 174–75; cf. JX 113 ¶ 8.)\n300. Doe 3 has difficulty arranging coverage for his OB/GYN practice because other\nOB/GYN doctors in the Shreveport area refuse to cover his practice as a result of his work at\nHope Clinic performing abortions. (Doc. 190 at 111–13.)\n301. Dr. Doe 3 testified that, as a result of his fears, and the demands of his private\nOB/GYN practice, if he is the last physician performing abortion in either the entire state or in the\nnorthern part of the state, he will not continue to perform abortions. (Id. at 174–76; see also JX\n116 ¶ 19.) The Court finds his testimony credible and supported by the weight of other evidence\nin the record.55\n302. To summarize, \n- If Act 620 takes effect, Doe 1 will no longer be allowed to provide abortions in\nLouisiana because he does not have admitting privileges pursuant to the Act within\n30 miles of Hope.\n- If Act 620 takes effect, Doe 2 will no longer be allowed to provide abortions in\nLouisiana, because he does not have active admitting privileges pursuant to the\nAct within 30 miles of Bossier. His privileges at Tulane are limited such that they\ndo not comply with Act 620 so that he does not have active admitting privileges\nwithin 30 miles of Causeway Clinic.\n55 The issue of whether this fact is legally relevant to the undue burden analysis is\ndiscussed in this Ruling’s Conclusions of Law.

The Court finds that the inability of Does 1, 4 and 6 to get active admitting privileges\nat any hospital is directly related to the requirements of Act 620 as they apply in concert with\nexisting Louisiana law and the Louisiana rules and practices for getting admitting privileges.\n304. The Court finds that the inability of Doe 2 to get active admitting privileges within\n30 miles of Bossier and only limited privileges (not “active admitting privileges”) within 30 miles\n56 Id.\n80 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 81 of 112\nof Causeway as well as Doe 5’s inability to get active admitting privileges within 30 miles of the\nDelta are also directly attributable to the requirements of Act 620 as they apply in concert with\nthe rules and practices for getting admitting privileges in Louisiana.\nB. The Effect of Act 620 on the Clinics and Women of Louisiana\n305. If Act 620 were to be enforced, four of the six doctors–Doe 1, 2, 4, and 6–would not\nmeet the requirements of Act 620. If Doe 3 quits the abortion practice, as he has testified he will,\nLouisiana would be left with one provider and one clinic. As is analyzed in more detail below,\nthis would result in a substantial number of Louisiana women being denied access to an abortion\nin this state.57\n306. If Act 620 were to be enforced, four of the five clinics–Hope, Bossier, Delta, and\nCauseway– would have no abortion provider, with the one remaining clinic (Woman’s) without\none of the two doctors that normally serves its patients.\n307. Women’s Clinic would have only Doe 5 to handle not only all patients at that facility\nbut the patients at the other four. According to Cochran, the Administrator at Women’s Health,\nDoe 6 provided 60% of the abortion services at this center. As she testified, “[e]ven if Dr. Doe 5\nwere to commit all of his time to serving patients at Women’s Clinic, I do not see how we could\nserve all of the patients who [would] be coming to our doors once Delta Clinic closes . . . .” (JX\n109 ¶ 37.)\n57 The question of whether this substantial number translates into a “large fraction” for\npurpose of the undue burden analysis is discussed later in this Ruling. See infra Parts XI–XII.\n81 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 82 of 112\n308. Furthermore, since Women’s Health would be the only clinic to serve all the women\nof Louisiana, it clearly could not perform that task as a logistical matter. Doe 5 performed a total\napproximately 2,950 abortions in the year 2013 at Delta and Women’s. (JX 110 ¶ 7.) Given the\n9,976 abortions performed in Louisiana in that same year,58 and putting aside the issue of the\ndistance which would need to be traveled by women in north Louisiana, approximately 70% of\nthe women in Louisiana seeking an abortion would be unable to get an abortion in Louisiana. \n309. Given that the total number of women of reproductive age in Louisiana is 938,719\naccording to Defendant expert mathematician and statistician, Solanky, (DX 148; DX 151; Doc.\n193 at 138–39),59 this would mean that over 99% of women of reproductive age in Louisiana,\nregardless of location or distance to the physician, would be without any physician within the\nactual borders of this state to perform an abortion.\n310. Even if one were to conclude that Doe 3 will not quit or that his quitting is legally\nirrelevant, Act 620’s will nonetheless result in the inability of a substantial number of  Louisiana\nto obtain an abortion in this state. Just the loss of Doe 1 on Hope would be, according to Pittman,\nHope’s administrator, “devastating” to its operations and viability. (Doc 190 at 29.)\n311. Doe 3 sees about 20 to 30 abortion patients per week, or roughly 1,000 to 1,500 per\nyear. (Id. at 118.) This would leave roughly 5,500 Louisiana women seeking an abortion (or 55%)\nwithout the ability to get one. When one uses women of reproductive age as the denominator, the\npercentage of Louisiana women unable to get an abortion is still over 99%.\n58 This data is taken from the affidavit of Defendant’s expert, Solanky, who, in turn, took\nit from DHH’s website. (DX 148 at 5.)\n59 This represents Louisiana women between the ages of 15 and 44. (DX 148 at 28–29.)\n82 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 83 of 112\n312. Even if one additionally assumes that Defendant’s interpretation of Doe 2’s\nprivileges at Tulane is correct, so that he meets the requirements of Act 620 at Tulane, the Act’s\nnegative impact upon a woman’s right to abortion in Louisiana would still be significant. Doe 2\nperformed a total of approximately 1,000 abortions last year at the two clinics where he worked.\n(Doc. 191 at 17–18.) Thus, if you combine his procedures with those of Does 3 and 5, there\nwould still be some 4,500 women seeking an abortion (or about 45% of women seeking an\nabortion in a given year) who would otherwise be able to get abortion and who could not do so\nupon Act 620’s enforcement. Utilizing the women of reproductive age as the denominator, that\npercentage would rise to over 99%. \n313. Even if Doe 3 continued to practice and Doe 2’s limited privileges at Tulane met the\nrequirements of Act 620, two of Louisiana’s five abortion clinics–Bossier and Delta–would be\nwithout an abortion provider.\n314. The remaining three–Hope, Causeway and Woman’s–would each be without one of\nthe two providers who normally perform abortions, an insufficient number to service the patients\nin the region, let alone the number of patients who might come from other parts of the state\nbecause of similar insufficient capacity.\n315. Analyzed regionally, if Act 620 were to be enforced, the Baton Rouge and\nShreveport areas would have no facility, and the New Orleans area would have only one provider,\nrather than the two who currently work there. If, as Defendant argues, Doe 3’s quitting is legally\nirrelevant and the Defendant’s interpretation of Doe 2’s privileges at Tulane is correct, Baton\nRouge would be left with no facility, Shreveport with one (Hope) and New Orleans with two\n83 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 84 of 112\n(Causeway and Woman’s). But each remaining facility would have only half the previous number\nof providers.\n316. Abortion clinics in Louisiana routinely make efforts to recruit doctors to work at the\nclinics, such as placing advertisements throughout the state and working with reproductive health\nspecialists to identify potential candidates. (Doc. 190 at 22, 24–25, 33, 87; Doc. 168-8 at 7–8.) \n317. The anticipated admitting privileges requirement of Act 620 has made it difficult to\nrecruit new doctors. (Doc. 190 at 24.)  In Pittman’s words, “It definitely has.” (Id.)\n318.  For example, Hope recently identified an interested doctor, but this potential\nphysician ultimately proved to be an unviable candidate as a result of Act 620’s admitting\nprivileges requirement. (Id. at 24–25.)\n319. In addition, doctors who appear to be good candidates consistently express reluctance\nto be hired in Louisiana because of the numerous restrictions placed on abortion providers by\nLouisiana’s existing laws and regulations. (See id. at 22–25.)\n320. For the same reasons that Does 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 have had difficulties getting active\nadmitting privileges, reasons unrelated to their competence, the Court finds that it is unlikely that\nthe effected clinics will be able to comply with the Act by recruiting new physicians who have or\ncan obtain admitting privileges. A significant contributing factor to that inability is Act 620 and\nthe difficulties it creates for a doctor with an abortion practice gaining active admitting privileges\nin the context of Louisiana’s admitting privileges rules and practices.60 \n60 While there was credible testimony that the hostile environment against abortion\nproviders in Louisiana and nationally is another factor making recruiting difficult, (Doc. 190 at\n22–25; JX 110 ¶¶ 16, 23 n.1; JX 109 ¶ 14), the Court did not consider this factor as being legally\nrelevant under Firth Circuit jurisprudence. See infra Parts XI–XII.\n84 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 85 of 112\n321. The Court finds that the enforcement of Act 620 and the concomitant effect on\nrestricted access to abortion doctors and clinics would result in delays in care, causing a higher\nrisk of complications, as well as a likely increase in self-performed, unlicensed and unsafe\nabortions. (See, e.g., id. at 222–24; Doc. 191 at 157–62.)\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\nX. Summary of Legal Arguments\n322. Plaintiffs challenge Act 620 as unconstitutional on three broad grounds. First, under\nthe rational review prong of the Casey test, Act 620 does not serve a legitimate state interest.\n(Doc. 102 at 5–7; Doc. 196 ¶¶ 322–34). Second, the effect of Act 620 is to place an undue burden\non the right of Louisiana women to have an abortion. (Doc. 102 at 7–16; Doc. 196 ¶¶ 297–307).\nAnd third, the purpose of Act 620 is to create a substantial obstacle to a Louisiana woman’s right\nto an abortion. (Doc. 102 at 16–19; Doc. 196 ¶¶ 308–21). \n323. In her Partial MSJ, (Doc. 87), Motion for Reconsideration, (Doc. 144), and post-trial\nbriefs, (Docs. 200–01), Defendant argues that three issues should be eliminated as a matter of\nlaw: (1) whether Act 620 serves a legitimate state interest under the Casey rational review test;\n(2) whether Act 620 imposes a medically unreasonable requirement; and (3) whether Act 620 has\nthe improper purpose of placing an undue burden on abortion access in Louisiana. \n324. The essence of Defendant’s argument is that  all three issues were decided as a matter\nof law in five recent Fifth Circuit decisions which are binding on this Court and require the\ngranting of Defendant’s motion for partial summary judgment. These decisions include: Planned\nParenthood of Greater Tex. Surgical Health Servs. v. Abbott, 734 F.3d 406 (5th Cir. 2013)\n85 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 86 of 112\n(“Abbott I”); Abbott II, 748 F.3d 583; Currier, 760 F.3d 448; Whole Woman’s Health v. Lakey,\n769 F.3d 285 (5th Cir. 2014) (“Lakey”), vacated in part, 135 S. Ct. 399, 190 L. Ed. 2d 247(2014);\nand Cole, 790 F.3d 563. Further, in the alternative, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs failed on the\nmerits to offer admissible and relevant evidence in support of their position that Act 620 has an\nimproper purpose. \n325. In addition, Defendant argues that the above cited cases set the legal standard for\ndetermining whether and to what extent Plaintiffs have shown that an undue burden exists and, as\nthat standard is properly applied in this case, Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden of\nshowing either improper purpose or undue burden.\n326. The essence of Plaintiffs’ response is that: (1) Currier, Abbott I and II, Lakey, and\nCole do not bind this Court on rational review because that analysis is fact-specific and must be\nevaluated in the context of this specific statute as applied in this specific state; (2) that the medical\nneed and reasonableness of Act 620 are relevant to the issue of the statute’s alleged undue\nburden; and (3) that medical need and reasonableness of Act 620 are relevant to the statute’s\npurpose, an issue related to but separate from rational basis or the statute’s effect, and one not\naddressed in these Fifth Circuit cases or at least not addressed in the context of the specific facts\nof this case.\n327. Both sides agree that the question of whether the effect of Act 620 is to create an\nundue burden was properly ripe for the preliminary injunction hearing. Plaintiffs argue that, under\nthe proper standard, Plaintiffs have shown both improper purpose and undue burden. Defendant\nargues they have proven neither.\n86 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 87 of 112\nXI. Test for Determining the Constitutionality of Act 620\n328. “[F]or more than 40 years, it has been settled constitutional law that the Fourteenth\nAmendment protects a woman’s basic right to choose an abortion.” Currier, 760 F.3d at 453\n(citing Roe, 410 U.S. 113).\n329. The test to be applied in this circuit to determine the constitutionality of a law which\narguably restricts a woman’s right to an abortion is set out in five recent cases: Currier, Abbott I,\nAbbott II, Lakey and Cole. All five cases dealt, in part, with an admitting privileges requirement\nvery similar to Act 620 as written and enacted. Compare LA. R.S. § 40:1299.35.2, with, e.g., H.B.\n2, 83d Legis., 2d Spec. Sess. (Tex. 2013); H.B. 1390, 2012 Legis., Reg. Sess. (Miss. 2012).   \n330. In order to be deemed unconstitutional, a statute restricting a woman’s right to\nabortion must fail at least one of two different tests: the “rational basis” test or the “undue\nburden” test. Currier, 760 F.3d at 453 (“In addition to creating no undue burden, an abortion\nrestriction must pass a rational basis test.” (relying in part on Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124,\n158, 127 S. Ct. 1610, 1633, 167 L. Ed. 2d 480 (2007) (“Carhart”)); see also Cole, 790 F.3d at\n576, 576 (citing the “trio of widely-known Supreme Court decisions [which] provide[] the\nframework for ruling on the constitutionality” of an abortion law–Roe, Casey, and Gonzalez–and\ndistinguishing between the rational basis and undue burden tests).\n331. In making this dual analysis, the Court must use a “two-step approach,” first making\na rational basis inquiry followed by an analysis of whether the statute creates at undue burden.\nLakey, 769 F.3d at 293, 297.\n87 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 88 of 112\nA. Rational Basis Review\n332. “The first-step of the analysis of an abortion regulation . . . is rational basis review,\nnot empirical basis review.” Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 596 (emphasis in original) (citing Carhart, 550\nU.S. at 158).61\n333. A statute passes the rational basis test if it  “is rationally related to a legitimate state\ninterest [and, in deciding if it is], we do not second guess the legislature regarding the law’s\nwisdom or effectiveness.” Lakey, 769 F.3d at 294 (citing Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 594).\n334. Crucially, while the Parties introduced a great deal of evidence on the effects of Act\n620, that evidence is not relevant in the rational basis review. “[T]here is ‘never a role for\nevidentiary proceedings’ under rational basis review.” Abbott II, 748 F.3d 596 (quoting Nat’l\nPaint & Coatings Ass’n v. City of Chicago, 45 F.3d 1124, 1127 (7th Cir. 1995)). “[L]egislative\nchoice is not subject to courtroom fact-finding.” Id. at 594 (quoting F.C.C. v. Beach Commnc’ns,\nInc., 508 U.S. 307, 315, 113 S. Ct. 2096, 2102, 124 L. Ed. 2d 211, (1993) (citing cases)). In\napplying this part of the test, a district court is not to relitigate the facts that led to the passage of\nthe law. Id. (citing Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 320, 113 S. Ct. 2637, 2462, 125 L. Ed. 2d 257\n(1993)).62\n61 In Currier, the Fifth Circuit acknowledged that there is disagreement as to whether the\nrational review test is independent from and precedes the undue burden test but found it\nunnecessary to resolve the dispute. 760 F.3d at 454. Lakey, however, clearly reaffirmed Abbott II\nin what it calls the Fifth Circuit’s “two-step approach: first determining whether the law at issue\nsatisfies rational basis, then whether it places a substantial obstacle in the path of a large fraction\nof women seeking abortions.” Lakey, 769 F.3d at 297 (citing Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 593, 597).\n62  It is interesting, however, that the Fifth Circuit did discuss testimony and other\nevidence introduced at the trial in connection with its conclusion that the law passed rational\nreview by serving a medical purpose and that the thirty mile geographic restriction requirement\nalso passed rational review. Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 595 (“There is sufficient evidence here that\n88 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 89 of 112\n335. Rather, “the rational basis test seeks only to determine whether there is any\nconceivable basis for the enactment.” Id. (citing Beach Commc’ns, 508 U.S. at 313). “A law\n‘based on rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data’ satisfies rational basis\nreview.” Id. (emphasis added) (quoting Beach Commc’ns, 508 U.S. at 315).\nB. Undue Burden Test - Generally\n336. Even if the law regulating abortion has a rational basis, it can still be unconstitutional\nif it “has the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an\nabortion of a nonviable fetus.” Casey, 505 U.S. at 877; see also, e.g., Lakey, 769 F.3d at 294;\nCole, 790 F.3d at 572, 576.\n337. Whether the law’s “purpose” is to create an undue burden, or its “effect” does so\nunintentionally, are two different inquiries and are to be considered separately. See Lakey, 769\nF.3d at 294 (emphasizing that this inquiry looks to whether the provision has “ either ‘the purpose\nor effect’ of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a\nnonviable fetus” (emphasis in original)); cf. Jane L. v. Bangerter, 102 F.3d 1112, 116 n.5 (10th\nCir. 1996) (commenting that “[n]either the district court nor the [s]tate has focused on the fact\nthat under Casey, a law is invalid if either its purpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in\nthe path of a woman seeking to abort a nonviable fetus”). \n338. Unlike the rational basis test, proof is not only allowed, but is required, in order to\nsatisfy the two prongs of the undue burden test. Lakey, 769 F.3d at 294–95 (reversing the district\nthe geographic restriction has a rational basis.”); see also Cole, 790 F.3d at 584 (in which the\nFifth Circuit noted that Texas supported the rational basis of Texas H.B. 2 with evidence at trial).\n89 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 90 of 112\ncourt’s finding that the admitting privilege requirement had an improper purpose because the\ncourt “cited no record evidence to support its determination that [this] provision was enacted for\nthe purpose of imposing an undue burden on women seeking abortions, nor did it make any\nfactual finding regarding an improper purpose” (emphasis added)); Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 597\n(“[P]laintiffs offered no evidence implying that the State enacted the admitting privileges\nprovision in order to limit abortions . . . .” (emphasis added)); Cole, 790 F.3d at 585 (“Plaintiffs\nbore the burden of proving . . . an improper purpose . . . [and] failed to proffer competent evidence\ncontradicting the legislature’s statement of a legitimate purpose.” (emphasis added) (citation\nomitted)).\n339. Therefore, two issues central to the undue burden test are (1) what kind of evidence is\nadmissible to satisfy the purpose and effect prongs and (2) by what standard is this evidence to be\nmeasured in determining if the plaintiffs have met their burden?\n340. As a threshold matter, the Court observes that the answer to these two questions is\ndramatically different depending on the circuit in which the issue is considered. In utilizing this\nmeasure, some require the regulation to be examined in a “real-world context.”  Planned\nParenthood Se., Inc. v. Strange , 33 F. Supp. 3d 1330, 1337 (M.D. Ala. 2014) (“Strange”); see\nalso Planned Parenthood of Wis., Inc. v. Van Hollen, 94 F. Supp. 3d 949, 963 & n.14 (W.D. Wis.\n2015) (“Van Hollen”) (specifically rejecting the conclusion that the Fifth Circuit’s reasoning in\nAbbott II is consistent with Casey and emphasizing that the Seventh Circuit, as well as the Ninth,\nfavor “balancing of benefits and burdens”), aff’d, 806 F.3d 908 (7th Cir. 2015). As explained by\none court, this kind of “careful, fact-specific analysis” focuses on “how the restrictions would\nimpede women’s ability to have an abortion, in light of the circumstances in their lives.” Strange,\n90 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 91 of 112\n33 F. Supp. 3d at 1338 (quoting the earlier Planned Parenthood Se., Inc. v. Strange, 9 F. Supp. 3d\n1272, 1285 (M.D. Ala. 2014)); see also, e.g., Planned Parenthood of Heartland, Inc. v. Iowa Bd.\nof Med., 865 N.W. 2d 252, 268–69 (Iowa 2015) (holding undue burden test must be “context-\nspecific”); Planned Parenthood of Ariz., Inc. v. Humble, 753 F.3d 905, 914 (9th Cir. 2014)\n(criticizing the Fifth and Sixth Circuit approaches for not being context-specific).\n341. Under this approach, “real-world” factors must be considered by the court, including \nthe role of poverty in creating increased obstacles for poor women who seek abortions, and the\nnegative effects of violence against abortion providers on the granting of admitting privileges and\nrecruiting of doctors. See, e.g., Strange, 33 F. Supp. 3d at 1351–53, 1356–58; Van Hollen, 94 F.\nSupp. 3d at 965, 976. \n342. Under the Fifth Circuit approach, however, poverty related issues, e.g. increased\nchallenges for poor women to get an abortion far from their home caused by lack of availability of\nchild care, unreliability of transportation, unavailability of time off from work, etc., cannot be\nconsidered in the undue burden analysis because these issues were not caused by or related to the\nadmitting privileges requirement. See Cole, 790 F.3d at 589. \n343. Similarly, the Fifth Circuit has found “fear [of] anti-abortion violence” to be\nunrelated to the abortion regulation at issue; such fears are therefore legally irrelevant. Abbott II,\n748 F.3d at 599.\n344. This Court, therefore, has not considered the evidence presented on these “real\nworld” issues in reaching its decision.\n345. A second major difference in the approach taken by the circuits in applying the undue\nburden test is the standard by which the evidence is measured. The Seventh and Ninth Circuits as\n91 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 92 of 112\nwell as a district court in the Eleventh Circuit have applied a test whereby “the extent of the\nburden a law imposes on a woman’s right to abortion” must be compared to and weighed against\n“the strength of the state’s justification for the law.” Humble, 753 F.3d at 912; see also, e.g.,\nPlanned Parenthood of Wisconsin, Inc., 738 F.3d at 798; Iowa Bd. of Med., 865 N.W.2d at 264;\nStrange, 33 F. Supp. 3d at 1337.\n346. The Fifth Circuit has specifically rejected this balancing or weighing test: “[O]ur\ncircuit does not incorporate a balancing analysis into the undue burden analysis.” Lakey, 769 F.3d\nat 305; accord, e.g., Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 593–94; Cole, 790 F.3d at 587 n. 33; see also, e.g.,\nPlanned Parenthood Sw. Ohio Region v. DeWine, 696 F.3d 490, 513 (6th Cir. 2012) (Moore, J.,\ndissenting in part) (noting that “a ‘substantial obstacle’ has never been defined as a total obstacle”\nand that “in evaluating the impact of restrictions, rarely do courts rely exclusively on\npercentages”); Greenville Women’s Clinic v. Bryant, 222 F.3d 157, 170 (4th Cir. 2000) (“In\nmaking this undue-burden assessment, the Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized that the\nfocus must be aimed more directly at the ability to make a decision to have an abortion as distinct\nfrom the financial cost of procuring an abortion.” (emphasis in original)).\n347. Rather, the Fifth Circuit has adopted another test which is detailed below. This Court\nhas used the Fifth Circuit test in reaching its decision.\nC. Undue Burden - Purpose Prong\n348. Casey suggests that one challenging the statute’s purpose must show that the statute\n“serve[s] no purpose other than to make abortions more difficult.” 505 U.S. at 901; accord Cole,\n790 F.3d at 585–86; see also Mazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U.S. 968, 972, 117 S. Ct. 1865,\n92 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 93 of 112\n1866–67, 138 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1997) (per curium) (stressing that “[w]e do not assume\nunconstitutional legislative intent even when statutes produce harmful results” and faulting\nplaintiff for not offering at least “some evidence of that improper purpose” (emphasis in\noriginal)).\n349. While Defendant argues that evidence of the purpose prong should be limited to the\nstatute’s text and official legislative history, (Doc. 87-1 at 18–22), the Court disagrees. In\nOkpalobi v. Foster, the Fifth Circuit found that a district court is “not to accept the government’s\nproffered purpose if it is a mere ‘sham.’” 190 F.3d 337, 354–56 (5th Cir. 1999) (quoting Edwards\nv. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578, 586–87, 107 S. Ct. 2573, 2579, 96 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1987) (specifying\nthe requirements for a law’s analysis under the Constitution’s Establishment Clause)), superceded\non other grounds, 244 F.3d 405 (5th Cir. 2001); see also, e.g., Croft v. Perry, 624 F.3d 157, 166\n(5th Cir. 2010) (“[W]e do review to ensure that the alleged secular purpose is the actual\npurpose[.]”); cf. Planned Parenthood of Kan. & Mid-Mo. v. Moser, 747 F.3d 814, 841 (10th Cir.\n2014) (“[T]he Supreme Court has considered legislative motive or purpose in assessing whether a\nstatute is valid under the Establishment Clause and the Equal Protection Clause.”).  As stated by\nthe Supreme Court in its most recent abortion case, a court should not “place dispositive weight\non [legislative] factual findings . . . where constitutional rights are at stake.” Carhart, 550 U.S. at\n165; see also Latta v. Otter, 771 F.3d 456, 469 (9th Cir. 2014) (“Unsupported legislative\nconclusions as to whether particular policies will have societal effects of the sort at issue in this\ncase—determinations which often, as here, implicate constitutional rights—have not been\nafforded deference by the Court.”), cert. denied, 135 S. Ct. 2931 (2015). Instead, all federal courts\n“retain[] an independent constitutional duty to review . . . [those] findings, (Id.), for “the judicial\n93 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 94 of 112\npower of the United States,” a power wielded by all Article III judges, “necessarily extends to the\nindependent determination of all questions, both of fact and law, necessary to the performance of\nthat supreme function,” Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22, 60, 52 S. Ct. 285, 296, 76 L. Ed 598\n(1932), cited in Carhart, 550 U.S. at 165. As such, “[u]ncritical deference to . . .  [a legislature’s]\nfactual findings in these cases is inappropriate.” 550 U.S. at 166; see also Bowen v. Kendrick, 487\nU.S. 589, 601, 108 S. Ct. 2562, 2570, 101 L. Ed. 2d 520 (1988) (commenting that “in the course\nof determining the constitutionality of a statute, referred not only to the language of the statute but\nalso to the manner in which it had been administered in practice”); Northland Family Planning\nClinic, Inc. v. Cox, 487 F.3d 323, 332 (6th Cir. 2007) (citing Carhart, 550 U.S. at 166). \n350. Therefore, in searching for a law’s purpose as a part of the undue burden analysis, a\ncourt can look to “various types of evidence, including the language of the challenged act, its\nlegislative history, and the social and historical context of the legislation or other legislation\nconcerning the same subject matter as the challenged measure.” Okpalobi, 190 F.3d at 354–56;  \nsee also, e.g., Roy G. Speece, Jr., The Purpose Prong of Casey’s Undue Burden Test and Its\nImpact on the Constitutionality of Abortion Insurance Restrictions in the Affordable Care Act or\nIts Progeny, 33 WHITTIER L. REV. 77, 99 (2011) ( where, reviewing Okpalobi and other cases, the\nauthor lists a “broad array of factors” considered by courts to determine purpose, including “a\nbill’s social and historical context”).\n351. However, the Fifth Circuit in Cole ruled that evidence that the statute has no health\nbenefits does not prove that the statute “must have had an invalid purpose.” 790 F.3d at 585\n(quoting Mazurek, 520 U.S. at 973). Furthermore, evidence that shows “medical and scientific\n94 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 95 of 112\nuncertainty” about the statute’s health benefits, “does not lead to the conclusion that a law is\nunconstitutional.” Id. (citing Carhart, 550 U.S. at 163).\n352. Under the Fifth Circuit standard, an abortion regulation satisfies the purpose prong\nunless the regulation serves “no purpose other than to make abortions more difficult.” Id. at 586\n(quoting Casey, 505 U.S. at 901); see also, e.g., Women’s Med. Prof’l Corp. v. Baird, 438 F.3d\n595, 607 (6th Cir. 2006) (quoting this same language from Casey).\nD. Undue Burden - Effect Prong\n353. In order for the plaintiffs to prevail under Fifth Circuit jurisprudence, they must\nprove, “at a minimum,” that a “large fraction” of women of reproductive age in Louisiana have a\nsubstantial obstacle to an abortion placed in their paths as a result of the challenged law. Cole,\n790 F.3d at 586, 588–89 (emphasis added) (relying on Lakey, 769 F.3d at 296, and Abbott II, 748\nF.3d at 600); see also, e.g., Gonzales, 550 U.S. at 167–68; Casey, 505 U.S. at 895.\n354. This test begs two critical questions: what is a “large fraction”? And what is a\n“substantial obstacle”?\n355. The Fifth Circuit has not provided a definition of the term “large fraction.”  Rather,\nits  guidance comes by how that term has been applied.  \n356. As to the proper denominator, the Fifth Circuit’s “binding precedent” requires this\nCourt to use “all women of reproductive age or women who might seek an abortion . . . .” Cole,\n790 F.3d at 589 (citing Abbott I, 734 F.3d at 414; Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 598; and Lakey, 769 F.3d\nat 299). However, language quoted from Lakey and relied upon by Cole suggests that the proper\ndenominator might be the number of women who actually seek abortions, not the number who\n95 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 96 of 112\n“might” seek one, i.e. the entire population of women of reproductive age.63 In any event, this\nCourt has considered both.64 \n357. In Cole, the Court found that neither 16.7% nor 7.4% of Texas women of\nreproductive age constituted a large fraction. Id. at 588. Abbott II found that 10% did not. See 748\nF.3d at 598. Lakey found that 17% was insufficient. 769 F.3d at 298 & n.13. Currier involved the\nclosure of Mississippi’s only abortion clinic, resulting in 100% of Mississippi women being\nadversely affected. 760 F.3d at 458–59. This was found sufficient. Thus, this Court has no\nspecific mandate from the Fifth Circuit as to what percentage between 17% and 100% qualifies as\na “large fraction.”\n358. In Casey, the Court also used the phrase “significant number” in describing the\nnumber of women who must be unduly burdened in order to render the statute unconstitutional.\n505 U.S. at 894 (“The spousal notification requirement is thus likely to prevent a significant\nnumber of women from obtaining an abortion.”).65 Cole suggests that the two terms were used\n63 “Here, the ambulatory surgical center requirement applies to every abortion clinic in\nthe State, limiting the options for all women in Texas who seek an abortion. The appropriate\ndenominator thus includes all women affected by those limited options.” Lakey, 769 F.3d at 299\n(emphasis added), quoted in Cole, 790 F.3d at 589.\n64 This Court agrees with Cole’s holding that the denominator should not be the\npopulation of women upon whom an undue burden is placed (as urged by the Cole plaintiffs)\nbecause this, as the Court points out, is a tautology and guarantees that 100% of women so\ndescribed will be adversely affected. Cole, 790 F.3d at 589.  However, it seems to this Court that\nthe most appropriate denominator would be the number of women who typically seek abortions; \nin Louisiana, that number is about 10,000 per year, (DX 148 ¶ 11). Regardless, “[h]owever much\na district court may disagree with an appellate court, . . . [it] is not free to disregard the mandate\nor directly applicable holding of the appellate court.” Cole, 790 F.3d at 581 (citing United States\nv. Teel, 691 F.3d 578, 582–83 (5th Cir. 2012)).\n65 Judge Stephen A. Higginson’s concurring and dissenting opinion in Lakey notes that\nCasey used both terms, invalidating the spousal notification statute because it would prevent a\n“significant number” as well as a “large fraction” of women from obtaining an abortion. 769\n96 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 97 of 112\nsynonymously, Casey stating that “significant number” amounted to a “large fraction.” 790 F.3d\nat 586 n. 30 (citing Casey, 505 U.S. at 895). Unfortunately, neither term is defined. Nonetheless,\nthis Court has considered both in the Ruling.\n359. If the law results in the inability of all women of a given state to get an abortion\nwithin that state, the law has created a substantial obstacle, and the law is unconstitutional, even if\nthose women can get an abortion in an adjoining state. See Currier, 760 F.3d at 457–58 (so\nholding, but cautioning that “[n]othing in this opinion should be read to hold that any law or\nregulation that has the effect of closing all abortion clinics in a state would inevitably fail the\nundue burden analysis”). Cole creates an exception to that rule where the out of state abortion\nfacility is in “the same metropolitan area [as  the closed facility], though separated by a state\nline.” 790F.3d at 597. A further complication arises from the first of the two concluding\nobservations in Currier: “Whether . . . [a s]tate . . . regulation would impose an undue burden . . .\nis not a question that can be answered without reference to the factual context in which the\nregulation arose and operates.” Currier, 760 F.3d at 458 (emphasis added).\n360. In measuring “substantial obstacle”, the recent Fifth Circuit cases have primarily\nconsidered the increased travel distance required for a woman to get an abortion caused by the\nclosure or anticipated closure of abortion facilities within the state. For instance, the court in Cole\nfocused on “women who would face travel distances (one way) of over 150 miles in light of\nAbbott II’s holding that ‘an increase of travel of less than 150 miles for some women is not an\nundue burden under Casey.’” Cole, 790 F.3d at 588 (quoting Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 598).\nF.3d at 308 (Higginson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (citing Casey, 505 U.S. at\n893-95).\n97 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 98 of 112\n361. However, Cole “recognize[d] that any statement of ‘how far is too far’ will involve\nsome imprecision.” Id. at 594. Cole also suggested that “no distance, standing alone, could be too\nfar.” Id. at 594 (citing Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 598 (so reading Casey)). In holding the ambulatory\nsurgical center provision unconstitutional as applied to a clinic in McAllen, Texas, Cole held that\nthe 235 mile distance to the nearest clinic, combined with the “difficulties” and “practical\nconcerns”66 of McAllen women after the closure of that clinic, was a sufficient basis for finding\nthe statute unconstitutional. Cole, 790 F.3d at 593–594, 585 n.29, 594 n.42.\n362. Fifth Circuit jurisprudence does not allow this Court to consider the poverty of many\nLouisiana women and its effect in creating additional burdens and obstacles to utilizing an\nabortion facility farther away from their home. Cole, 790 F.3d 589 (citing Lakey, 769 F.3d at 299,\nand Abbott I, 734 F.3d at 415 (holding that “obstacle[s] that are unrelated to the hospital-\nadmitting-privileges requirement” are irrelevant to the undue-burden inquiry in a facial\nchallenge)).\n363. This same jurisprudence, moreover, does not allow the Court to consider the very\nreal violence and threats of violence towards abortion providers and its effect in the decision of\nDoe 3 to quit his abortion practice if Act 620 becomes effective. Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 599.  Nor\ncan the Court consider the very real difficulties this violence creates on the ability of abortion\nclinics to recruit new doctors. Id.\n66 These “difficulties” and “practical concerns” included evidence that some women\nwould be unable to make the trip from McAllen to San Antonio or Houston to obtain an abortion\nand, further, that the closure of the McAllen clinic would result in an increase in self-attempted\nabortions. Cole, 790 F.3d at 593; see also supra Part V. The Fifth Circuit provided no more\nguidance as to what other kinds of difficulties and practical concerns might properly be\nconsidered.\n98 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 99 of 112\nXII. Analysis\nA. Rational Basis\n364. Plaintiffs argue that Act 620 does not further a valid state interest. (Doc. 196 ¶¶\n322–27; Doc. 202 ¶¶ 153–57.) This issue was disposed of in the Court’s earlier ruling on\nDefendant’s Partial MSJ. (Doc. 138.)\n365. In particular, this Court there held:\nThe admitting privileges requirement of Act 620 is substantially similar to both Texas\nH.B. 2 and Miss. H.B. 1390. To the extent that Plaintiffs contend that Act  620 is not\nrationally related to a legitimate state interest because it is medically unreasonable or\nunnecessary, this Court is bound by the Fifth Circuit’s previous rulings in Abbott II,\nCurrier and Lakey. . . . [These cases] make clear that the admitting privileges provision of\nAct 620 passes rational basis review. Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 599-600; Currier, 760 F.3d at\n454; Lakey, 769 F.3d at 293. \n(Doc. 138 at 17.)\n366. In Cole, the Fifth Circuit reaffirmed its position on this issue, as summarized by this\nCourt. 790 F.3d at 584. \n367. Therefore, this Court holds (again) that Act 620 passes rational basis review.67\nB. Undue Burden - Purpose of Act 620\n368. Plaintiffs argue that the true purpose of Act 620 is to eliminate or unduly burden\nLouisiana women’s access to abortions by imposing a medically meaningless requirement that\n67 However, in its argument on this point, (Doc. 201 at 3–4), Defendant mischaracterizes\nthis Court’s earlier ruling. The Court did not, as suggested by Defendant, “reject Plaintiffs’ claim\nthat Act 620 imposes a medically unreasonable requirement that fails to protect women’s\nhealth.” (Id.) Rather, using the non-evidence-based “rational speculation” standard, the Court\nfound that Act 620 meets rational basis review without regard to evidence on this issue. (Doc.\n138 at 17–21.) \n99 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 100 of 112\nmost, if not all, abortion doctors can not meet for reasons which are unrelated to their\ncompetency. Thus, Plaintiffs argue, the statute violates the purpose prong of the undue burden test\nand is unconstitutional. \n369. Plaintiffs argue that the Court is not required to accept at face value Act 620's official\npurpose as stated in the legislation and that its true and improper purpose was proven at trial by a)\npublic statements by the Governor and the author of the bill which demonstrate that the true\npurpose of the legislation is to eliminate, not regulate, abortion; b) evidence that those\nparticipating in the drafting of the bill are associated with groups dedicated to the elimination of\nabortion; c) evidence that Act 620 is medically unnecessary and unreasonable; and, finally, d)\nevidence that any limited medical benefits brought by the Act are far outweighed by the burden\nthat it places on a woman’s right to an abortion.\n370. Defendant argues that (1) the Act’s legislative history, including the medical\ntestimony received by the Legislature, shows that the true purpose of the bill is to further the\nhealth and safety of women undergoing an abortion; (2) the intention of individual legislators or\nlobbyists is legally irrelevant to the bill’s purpose and cannot be considered by this Court; (3) the\nevidence at trial proved that the bill was medically necessary, beneficial and reasonable; (4) even\nif there is a legitimate debate about the Act’s medical necessity and reasonableness, this “medical\nuncertainty” cannot render the Act unconstitutional and (5) Fifth Circuit jurisprudence forecloses\nthis Court from weighing the Act’s benefits against its harms.\n371. The Court’s factual findings on these issues have been summarized above. See supra\nParts V–IX.\n100 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 101 of 112\n372. The rule in the Fifth Circuit, which this Court is bound to follow, is where there is\nmedical and scientific uncertainty about the need or benefits of an abortion restricting law,\nPlaintiffs have failed to meet their burden in establishing an improper purpose. The Court is not\npermitted to weigh the benefits of the law against its burdens. It is only where the sole purpose of\nthe law is an improper one, can Plaintiffs succeed on this prong. Plaintiffs have failed to make\nthis showing.\nC. Undue Burden - Effect of Act 620\n373. The Court finds that Act 620 will have the effect of placing an undue burden on (i.e.\nplacing a substantial obstacle in the path of) a large fraction of Louisiana women of reproductive\nage seeking an abortion. \n374. As summarized in the Findings of Fact, see supra Parts V–IX, Act 620 will have the\neffect of making abortions unavailable to approximately 55% of women seeking abortion in\nLouisiana and over 99% of women of reproductive age. The Court concludes that either\npercentage is a large fraction and a significant number.\n375. Even if one were to assume that Doe 2’s privileges at Tulane meet the requirements\nof Act 620, which this Court finds is not the case, see supra Part VIII.B, this undue burden would\nstill exist. Under this scenario, the reduced number of abortion providers would result in some\n45% of women seeking abortions–and over 99% of Louisiana women of reproductive age–being\nunable to get an abortion at a Louisiana facility. The Court concludes that either percentage is a\nlarge fraction and a significant number.\n101 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 102 of 112\n376. In addition to the increased distance some women would have to travel to find a\nfacility with the capacity to perform their abortion, there are the practical concerns and difficulties\nof increased risk of complications caused by delays in care, as well as a likely increase in self-\nperformed, unlicensed and unsafe abortions. (Doc. 190 at 223–24.)\n377. Defendant argues that Act 620 is not unconstitutional because any undue burden that\nit has created is not caused by or related to the statute. \n378. In order for an undue burden or substantial obstacle to render a law unconstitutional,\nthat burden or obstacle must be created by or related to the statute in question, in this case, the\nadmitting privileges requirement. K. P. v. LeBlanc, 729 F.3d 427, 442 (5th Cir. 2013) (relying on,\namong others, Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297, 316, 100 S. Ct. 2671, 2688, 65 L. Ed. 2d 784\n(1980)); accord, e.g., Collins v. Hoke, 705 F.2d 959, 962 (8th Cir. 1983) (quoting and applying\nHarris, 448 U.S. at 316); W. Va. Ass’n of Cmty. Health Ctrs. v. Sullivan, 737 F. Supp. 929, 944\n(S.D. W. Va. 1990) (same).\n379. Consequently, a facial challenge can be sustained only if “the law itself imposes an\nundue burden on at least a large fraction of women.”  Cole, 790 F.3d at 589 (quoting Lakey, 769\nF.3d at 299; Abbott I, 734 F.3d at 415; Harris, 448 U.S. at 316; and Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464,\n474, 97 S. Ct. 2376, 2382–83, 53 L. Ed. 2d 484 (1977)).\n380. Where the relevant obstacle was “neither created nor in any way affected by the . . .\nregulation,” then it is not the law itself which imposes the burden. Maher, 432 U.S. at 474\n(emphasis added). Stated another way, “although government may not place obstacles in the path\nof a woman’s exercise [of her right], it need not remove those not of its own creation.” Harris,\n448 U.S. at 316 (quoting Maher, 432 U.S. at 474).\n102 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 103 of 112\n381. In this case, Act 620 requires abortion doctors to get “active admitting privileges,”\nincluding being admitted as a member in good standing of the medical staff, at a nearby hospital.\nLA. R.S. § 40:1299.35.2; see also supra Part VI. However, the Act does not set the criteria\nnecessary for obtaining those privileges and there is no state law or other uniform standard that\nsets these criteria. See supra Parts V–VI, IX. Instead, the law relies on the highly variable\nrequirements set in the by-laws of each hospital. Id.\n382. The Act therefore anticipates and relies upon existing private hospital’s varying by-\nlaws’ admitting privileges requirements as allowed under Louisiana law. It delegates to private\nhospitals the duty of granting (or withholding) active admitting privileges and thereby utilizes by-\nlaws and private hospital credentialing committees as instruments for the implementation of the\nAct. Unquestionably then, the admitting privileges law and practices existing in Louisiana before\nAct 620 are “related to” Act 620. As is discussed in detail above, it is the two working in concert\nthat has created the inability of Doe 1, 2, 4, 5 (in Baton Rouge), and 6 to get the kind of active\nadmitting privileges which the Act itself mandates. See supra Parts V.D, IX.\n383. While not raised by Plaintiffs in this case, another court has held that a law\nessentially identical to Act 620 denied due process “based on the State delegating decisionmaking\nover the plaintiffs’ right to their chosen profession to private entities, namely hospitals, without\nadequate oversight or a mechanism to waive or appeal the hospitals’ denial of admitting\nprivileges . . . .” Van Hollen, 94 F. Supp. 3d at 954.\n384. Specifically, the district court in Van Hollen held that a hospital’s business needs did\nnot further any legitimate state interest nor did the requirement of some hospitals that the\napplying doctor show a record of in-patient care. Id. at 963–64. Necessarily, this Court holds,\n103 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 104 of 112\nbased on the law of this circuit, that Act 620 furthers a legitimate state interest. Nevertheless, Van\nHollen’s logic bolsters its own decision that the effective discrimination against abortion\nproviders growing out of the admitting privileges requirements of Louisiana hospitals (especially\nin the absence of the protection against discrimination provided under other state laws) are related\nto and caused by  Act 620.\n385.  As already noted, see supra Part VIII.B, in interpreting a state or federal statute,\ncourts traditionally focus not only on “the language itself [and] the specific context in which the\nlanguage is used [but also] the broader context of the statute as a whole.” Robinson, 519 U.S. at\n341; see also, e.g., Trout Point Lodge, Ltd. v. Handshoe, 729 F.3d 481, 486–87 (5th Cir. 2013)\n(citing id.).\n386. An analysis of the statute’s broader context is, in turn, informed by another cardinal\nrule of statutory construction: Congress, and by implication, any state legislature is “presumed to\nknow the [existing] law, including judicial interpretation of that law, when it legislates.” Day v.\nPersels & Assocs., LLC, 729 F.3d 1309, 1332 (11th Cir. 2013); see also, e.g., Wiersum v. U.S.\nBank, N.A., 785 F.3d 483, 488 n.5 (11th Cir. 2015); cf. Hernandez-Miranda v. Empresas Diaz\nMasso, Inc., 651 F.3d 167, 175 (1st Cir. 2011) (“The understanding of a term employed by\nCongress is ordinarily determined at the time of enactment.”); ANTONIN SCALIA & BRYAN A.\nGARNER, READING LAW: THE INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL TEXTS 322–26 (2012) (outlining the\nprior-construction canon). \n387. In effect, therefore, courts customarily impute to the legislature an awareness of any\nlegal strictures relevant to a particular enactment’s application. See, e.g., Cannon v. Univ. of\nChicago, 441 U.S. 677, 696–97, 99 S. Ct. 1946, 1957–58, 60 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979); see also, e.g.,\n104 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 105 of 112\nJohnson v. Hous.

United States, 497 F.3d 491, 501 (5th Cir. 2007) (explaining\nthat, under Chevron, a court must determine whether the relevant “regulations reasonably flow\nfrom the statute when viewed in context of the overall legislative framework and the policies that\nanimated Congress’s design”).\n388. In other words, statutory interpretation does not take place in a vacuum, and any\nreasonable understanding of the statute’s effect requires awareness of the preexisting legal\nregime.\n389. As discussed above, see supra Parts V, IX, the Court finds that Louisiana’s\ncredentialing process and the criteria found in some hospital by-laws work to preclude or, at least\ngreatly discourage, the granting of privileges to abortion providers, including the following:\n- There are no laws or regulations in Louisiana mandating certain minimum\nobjective credentialing criteria to assure that credentialing decisions are made only\non objective, competency-related factors, akin to the American Medical\nAssociation’s guidelines.68\n- The credentialing processes adopted by the hospitals in question permit them to\ndeny privileges for reasons purely personal and unrelated to the competency of the\n68  See supra note 25.\n105 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 106 of 112\nphysician including, specifically, anti-abortion views held by some involved in \ncredentialing;\n- Louisiana law does not prevent a hospital or credentialing personnel from\ndiscriminating against abortion providers based on their status as abortion\nproviders, regardless of their competency; and\n- By having no maximum time period within which applications must be acted upon,\na hospital can effectively deny a physician’s application without formally doing so\nand therefore affect a de facto denial without expressing the true reasons (or any\nreasons) for doing so.\n390. Indeed, the Court finds that, since Act 620 was enacted, these specific aspects of how\nLouisiana hospitals grant, deny, or withold hospital admitting privileges, have played a significant\ncontributing role in Louisiana’s abortion providers not being given privileges or being given only\nlimited privileges. See supra Parts V–VI, IX.\n391. The Court therefore finds that Act 620, acting in concert with existing Louisiana law\non abortion and Louisiana law and practice as it pertains to hospital admitting privileges, is\nfacially unconstitutional in placing an undue burden on the right of a large fraction of Louisiana\nwomen to an abortion. \nXIII. Conclusion\nA.  Motion to Reconsider Rulings on Summary Judgment and Motion in Limine \n392. As explained above, see supra Part II, Defendant moved for partial summary\njudgment, (Doc. 87), which was opposed, (Doc. 104). In the Partial MSJ, Defendant maintained\n106 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 107 of 112\nthat Act 620 met both the rational basis and the purpose prong of the undue burden test as a\nmatter of law. (Doc. 87 at 7 (summarizing Defendant’s argument).)  The Court granted the motion\nas to rational basis but held there were questions of fact which precluded the granting of the\nmotion as it pertained to the purpose prong. (Doc. 138.)\n393. For the same basic reasons, Defendant’s Motion in Limine sought to exclude\nPlaintiffs’ proposed evidence of Act 620’s purpose including evidence of medical reasonableness\nand the evidence regarding the drafting of Act 620. (Doc. 95.) This was denied. (Doc. 139.)\n 394. Based on the intervening Cole case, Defendant moved for reconsideration of that\npart of the summary judgment ruling that dealt with the purpose prong and the Court’s rulings\ndenying Defendant’s Motion in Limine. (Doc. 144.) This request was also opposed. (Doc. 150.)\nBecause of the complexity of the issue and the proximity of the upcoming trial date, the matter\nwas taken under advisement and deferred to trial.\n395. Set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, FED. R. CIV. P. 56, the standard for\ndeciding a summary judgment is well known and was set forth in the Court’s original ruling.\n(Doc. 138 at 8–9.) It is the standard used in the current motion.\n396. Cole holds that where there is conflicting medical testimony regarding the medical\nneed for and reasonableness of the law, the law meets the purpose prong. 790 F.3d at 585.\nHowever, this narrow and tailored legal conclusion does not mean that medical testimony on\nthese issues is not relevant and admissible. Thus, while this Court ultimately held that Act 620\nmeets the purpose prong, this was only after a consideration of the evidence on this issue.\n397. Similarly, while this Court found that emails and public statements of those involved\nin drafting and supporting the legislation was not sufficient to establish Act 620’s purpose as\n107 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 108 of 112\nunconstitutionally illicit, the evidence was nonetheless relevant. See Okpalobi, 190 F.3d at\n355–56 (stating that involvement of an anti-abortion group in the drafting of the legislation is\ninsufficient by itself, but not inadmissable, to show the statute’s purpose). \n398.  In light of these distinctions, with the substantive law applied by this Court left\nunchanged after Cole and with no newly discovered evidence having been presented, the Court\ntherefore denies Defendant’s Motion for Reconsideration. See, e.g., Waltman v. Int’l Paper Co.,\n875 F.2d 468, 473–75 (5th Cir. 1989) (commentating that Rule 59(e) motions “serve the narrow\npurpose of allowing a party to correct manifest errors of law or fact or to present newly\ndiscovered evidence” (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Keene Corp. v. Int’l Fidelity Ins.\nCo., 561 F. Supp. 656, 665 (N.D. Ill. 1982))); see also Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Mantor, 417\nF.3d 1060, 1064 n.1 (9th Cir. 2005) (“A Rule 59(e) motion is appropriate if the district court: (1)\nis presented with newly discovered evidence, (2) committed clear error or the initial decision was\nmanifestly unjust, or (3) if there is an intervening change in controlling law.” (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).  \nB. Preliminary Injunction\n(1) Preliminary Injunction Standard\n399. “[T]he burden of proving the unconstitutionality of abortion regulations falls squarely\non the plaintiffs.” Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 597. \n400. The four prerequisites which Plaintiffs must show are: (1) they are substantially\nlikely to succeed on the merits; (2) absent the injunction, there is a significant risk of irreparable\n108 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 109 of 112\nharm; (3) the balance of hardships weighs in their favor; and (4) granting the preliminary\ninjunction will not adversely affect the public interest. See, e.g., Opulent Life Church v. City of\nHolly Springs, Miss. 697 F.3d 279, 288 (5th Cir. 2012); Hoover v. Morales, 164 F.3d 221, 224\n(5th Cir. 1998); Vaughn v. St. Helena Parish Police Jury, 192 F. Supp. 2d 562, 575 (M.D. La.\n2001) (citing Women’s Med. Ctr. of N.W. Houston v. Bell, 248 F.3d 411, 419 (5th Cir. 2001)).\n401. A preliminary injunction is “an extraordinary and drastic remedy which should not be\ngranted unless the movant clearly carries the burden of persuasion on all four (4)\npre-requisites[.]” Ledet v. Fischer, 548 F. Supp. 775, 784 (M.D. La. 1982) (citations omitted);\naccord Kliebert, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 146988, at *71–73, 2015 WL 6551836, at *21–22; see\nalso, e.g., Anderson v. Jackson, 556 F.3d 351, 360 (5th Cir. 2009) (emphasizing that the movant\nmust “clearly carr[y]” burden to obtain “extraordinary and drastic remedy” of preliminary\ninjunction and quoting the four elements as formulated in Canal Auth. v. Callaway, 489 F.2d 567,\n572 (5th Cir. 1974)). \n402. This heavy burden applies when plaintiffs seek to enjoin regulations that may impact\nabortion access. See Mazurek, 520 U.S. at 972 (“‘[A] preliminary injunction is an extraordinary\nand drastic remedy, one that should not be granted unless the movant, by a clear showing, carries\nthe burden of persuasion.’”) (quoting 11A CHARLES WRIGHT ET AL., FEDERAL PRACTICE AND\nPROCEDURE § 2948 (2nd ed. 1995))). \n (2) Application of Preliminary Injunction Standard\n403. There is a substantial threat that, were Act 620 to be enforced, irreparable injury\nwould result to the Plaintiffs and their patients.\n109 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 110 of 112\n404. As explained in detail above, see supra Part XII, the Act will violate the\nconstitutional right of Louisiana women to abortion. This is, by definition, irreparable harm.\nDeerfield Med. Ctr. v. Deerfield Beach, 661 F.2d 328, 338 (5th Cir. 1981) (holding that the fact\nthat if a woman’s right to an abortion is “‘either threatened or in fact being impaired’ . . .\nmandates a finding of irreparable injury”) (citing to Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373–74, 96 S.\nCt. 2673, 2689–90, 49 L. Ed. 2d 547 (1976))).\n405. Likewise, the severely restricted access to abortion care by a large fraction of\nLouisiana women caused by Act 620, and the resulting unreasonable and dangerous delays in\nscheduling abortion procedures, constitute irreparable harm for  Louisiana women seeking\nabortions. See Jackson Women’s Health Org. v. Currier, 940 F. Supp. 2d 416, 424 (S.D. Miss.\n2013), aff’d in part, 760 F.3d 448. \n406. Many Louisiana women will also face irreparable harms from the burdens associated\nwith increased travel distances in reaching an abortion clinic with sufficient capacity to perform\ntheir abortions. These burdens include the risks from delays in treatment including the increased\nrisk of self-performed, unlicensed and unsafe abortions.\n407. The Court therefore finds that Plaintiffs have shown that the failure to grant the\ninjunction will likely result in irreparable injury.\n408. Plaintiffs have shown that the injury threatened by enforcement of Act 620 outweighs\nany damage the injunction may cause Defendant. While Plaintiff has given clear evidence of\nharm,  Defendant, by contrast, has not shown that any damage would result from the issuance of a\npreliminary injunction. A preliminary injunction will preserve the status quo, and permit the\nclinics and physicians to continue to provide safe, needed abortion care to their patients. The\n110 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 111 of 112\nsubstantial injury threatened by enforcement of the Act – namely irreparable harm to women and\nthe violation of their constitutional rights – clearly outweighs the impact of an injunction on\nDefendant. See Currier, 940 F. Supp. 2d at 424.\n409. A preliminary injunction is also in the public interest. The public interest is not\nserved by allowing an unconstitutional law to take effect. Currier, 940 F. Supp. 2d at 424 (“[T]he\ngrant of an injunction will not disserve the public interest, an element that is generally met when\nan injunction is designed to avoid constitutional deprivations.”); see also, e.g., Nobby Lobby, Inc.\nv. Dallas, 970 F.2d 82, 93 (5th Cir. 1992) (“[T]he public interest always is served when public\nofficials act within the bounds of the law and respect the rights of the citizens they serve”) (citing\nNobby Lobby, Inc. v. Dallas, 767 F. Supp. 801, 821 (N.D. Tex. 1991))). \n410. Without an injunction, Louisiana women will suffer significantly reduced access to\nconstitutionally protected abortion services, which will likely have serious health consequences.\n411. The Court concludes that Plaintiffs have demonstrated that the threatened injury of\nAct 620 outweighs any damages the injunction may cause Defendant, and that the injunction will\nnot disserve the public interest.\nC. Judgment\nFor the reasons stated above, IT IS ORDERED that\n1. Defendant’s Motion to Reconsider Rulings on Summary Judgment and Motion in Limine,\n(Doc. 144), is DENIED.\n2. The active admitting privileges requirement of  LA. R.S. § 40:1299.35.2 is declared\nunconstitutional as violating the substantive due process rights of Louisiana women\nseeking abortions.\n111 of 112\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 216    01/26/16   Page 112 of 112\n3. Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction is GRANTED to the extent that any\nenforcement of LA. R.S. § 40:1299.35.2 is preliminarily enjoined as to the Plaintiffs:\nspecifically, Doctor John Doe 1, Doctor John Doe 2, June Medical Services, LLC, d/b/a\nHope Medical Group for Women; Bossier City Medical Suite; and Choice, Inc. of Texas,\nd/b/a Causeway Medical Clinic.69 This injunction will remain in effect until further notice\nfrom this Court.\n4. Because there are applications for active admitting privileges which technically remain\n“pending,” the Court orders Plaintiffs to provide to the Court and Defendant on a monthly\nbasis beginning March 1, 2016, with a notification of any changes in the status of the\napplications. \n5. Should the applications status change, the Parties are free to seek any other relief that they\nmay deem appropriate. \n6. A status conference will be held on January 29, 2016, at 11:30 a.m., so as to consider,\namong other matters, what other proceedings must still take place and whether this Court\nshould convert the preliminary injunction issued by this Ruling to a permanent one.\nSigned in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on January 26, 2016. \nS\nJUDGE JOHN W. deGRAVELLES\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nMIDDLE DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA\n69 An order enjoining enforcement of Act 620 against parties other than Plaintiffs herein\nwould be overly broad.

Introduction \nSince this Court issued a preliminary injunction in this matter, the Supreme Court has held \nthat the Fifth Circuit’s interpretation of the undue burden test was incorrect.  Whole Woman’s \nHealth v. Hellerstedt, 136 S. Ct. 2292, 2309 (2016) (hereinafter “WWH”) (“The Court of Appeals’ \narticulation of the relevant standard is incorrect.”).  In its ruling, this Court’s conclusions of law \napplied the Fifth Circuit’s legal standard, which WWH reversed. Specifically, this Court initially \nconcluded, in line with Fifth Circuit precedent, that it could not consider evidence regarding \nwhether the Act would actually serve its purported purpose to advance women’s health and safety \nin practice, and could not weigh the Act’s burdens against its benefits. (Doc. 216 ¶¶ 178, 333–35, \n346, 351–-52, 364–-67, 372) (citing, inter alia, Whole Woman’s Health v. Cole, 790 F.3d 563, \n587 n.33 (5th Cir. 2015)).  Accordingly, this Court ruled it could not resolve the parties’ dispute \nover whether the Act is medically reasonable.  (Id. ¶ 178(C) & n.41.)   \nIn addition, this Court held the undue burden test, as applied in the Fifth Circuit, precluded \nconsideration of evidence related to the challenges women would face in obtaining abortions under \nthe Act in their “real-world” context. (Id. ¶¶ 340-43) (citing, inter alia, Cole, 790 F.3d at 589).  \nThis Court therefore did not consider evidence regarding how the Act, when considered in the \nreal-world context of abortion patients’ poverty and transportation challenges, providers’ fear of \nanti-abortion violence, pre-existing regulations, and other obstacles to abortion access, would \nimpose unique burdens on Louisiana women.  (Id. ¶ 344.)  The Supreme Court has now clarified \nthat  these  facts  should  be  considered  when  evaluating  whether  an  abortion  restriction  is \nconstitutional.  See WWH, 136 S. Ct. at 2302, 2312–13. \n5 \n \n\nThe Supreme Court held in WWH that restrictions on access to abortion before viability \nmust be subject to meaningful judicial scrutiny: rational basis review is simply not enough when \n“regulation of a constitutionally protected personal liberty” is at issue.  WWH, 136 S. Ct. at 2309.  \nRather, under the undue burden analysis, a restriction must be shown to actually “further” its \npurported interest, and it is constitutional only if its benefits outweigh its burdens. See id. at 2309–\n10.  Additionally, in evaluating a restriction’s benefits and burdens, courts must not simply defer \nto a State’s assertions about any purported benefits or burdens, but must consider actual evidence.  \nSee id. at 2310–12.  The Court explained its reasons for rejecting the Fifth Circuit’s analysis: \nThe rule announced in [Planned Parenthood of Southeast Pennsylvania v. Casey, \n505 U.S. 833 (1992)] . . . requires that courts consider the burdens a law imposes \non abortion access together with the benefits those laws confer.  And the [Court of \nAppeals was] wrong to equate the judicial review applicable to the regulation of a \nconstitutionally protected personal liberty with the less strict review applicable \nwhere, for example, economic legislation is at issue.   The Court of Appeals’ \napproach simply does not match the standard that this Court laid out in Casey, \nwhich asks courts to consider whether any burden imposed on abortion access is \n“undue.” \n \nId. at 2309–10 (citations omitted). Thus, WWH makes clear that courts have a “constitutional duty” \nto look beyond a State’s assertions for restricting access to abortion to evaluate whether the \nrestrictions at issue will actually advance any legitimate interests.  Id. at 2310. \nFurther, the Supreme Court specifically affirmed the relevance of evidence related to \nmedical reasonableness and “real-world” conditions in evaluating a law’s furtherance of its \npurported interest and its burdens on women seeking abortion.  Id. at 2301–03, 2312–13.  Thus, \nthe Court recounted with favor the finding of the District Court that “[t]he great weight of evidence \ndemonstrates that, before the act’s passage, abortion in Texas was extremely safe with particularly \nlow rates of serious complications and virtually no deaths occurring on account of the procedure.”  \n6 \n \n\nId. at 2302.  It affirmed that abortion “has been shown to be much safer, in terms of minor and \nserious  complications,  than  many common  medical  procedures not subject to such intense \nregulation and scrutiny,” and that the challenged laws would not decrease risks, improve outcomes, \nor result in better care.  Id.  It also relied upon the district court’s  findings  that  the  “requirements  \nerect  a  particularly  high  barrier  for  poor,  rural,  or disadvantaged women.”  Id.  The Court \nalso clarified that no single factor is determinative as to whether a restriction imposes an undue \nburden,  but  rather  the  burdens’  impact  must  be  evaluated  cumulatively,  and  are  undue  if \nunjustified by the law’s purported benefits.  Id. at 2313. \nWhile this Court determined that the challenged Act was unconstitutional even under the \nFifth Circuit’s now-rejected interpretation of the undue burden test, as a result of the WHH \ndecision, certain facts that Defendant argued were not legally relevant are now indisputably \nrelevant and, indeed, critical to the constitutional analysis. To summarize, under WWH, this Court \nmust consider (a) evidence regarding whether and how the restriction furthers the legislature’s \npurported interest, which in this case, includes the Act’s medical reasonableness, and (b) evidence \nregarding the actual burdens the restriction places on women seeking abortions.  The Court must \nthen assess the burdens and benefits of the restriction, and weigh the former against the latter to \nensure that the burden the law imposes is not “undue.”  A re-evaluation of certain of the Court’s \nconclusions of law also necessarily flows from applying the standard articulated by the Supreme \nCourt. \nBy Order dated January 26, 2016 (Doc. 216), and following a trial during which extensive \nevidence was submitted into the record, this Court preliminarily enjoined Defendant Rebekah Gee, \n7 \n \n\nin her official capacity as Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, from \nenforcing  Section  A(2)(a)  of  Act  Number  620,  amending  Louisiana  Revised  Statutes  § \n40:1299.35.2.3 (“the Act” or “Act 620”),1  against Plaintiffs June Medical Services LLC, d/b/a \n \nHope Medical  Group for Women  (“Hope”  or  “Hope  Clinic”);  Bossier City Medical  Suite \n(“Bossier” or “Bossier Clinic”); Choice Inc., of Texas, d/b/a Causeway Medical Clinic (“Choice” \nor “Causeway”) (collectively, “Plaintiff Clinics”); Dr. John Doe, M.D. 1 (“Doe 1”)2 and Dr. John \nDoe, M.D. 2 (“Doe 2”) (collectively, “Plaintiff Doctors”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”).  (Doc. 5.) \nNow before the Court are the parties’ contentions with regard to a permanent injunction in this \nmatter.   \nThe Court requested supplemental proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law from \nthe parties on a permanent injunction following the parties’ agreement that the Court may proceed \nto rule on the permanent injunction – including additional findings of fact and conclusions of law \nrequired by WWH – based on the existing record (Doc. 253).   The parties further agreed that \nno further evidence is needed, apart from short stipulations submitted jointly by the parties and \naccepted by the Court,  (Docs. 255, 265, 271), and an affidavit of Dr. Doe 2. (Doc. 272.) \nTherefore, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a), and with the consent and agreement \nof the parties, the Court advances to the merits of the permanent injunction, consolidating it with \n                                                 \n1 A copy of the final bill appears as a joint exhibit, (JX 115), and in other filings, (See, e.g., Doc. 168-10 at 39–43). \nAs the statute was subsequently codified, and as a statute’s language need not be evidenced to be known, this Court \nwill cite to Act 620 as codified. The Court does so throughout this opinion unless it is recounting, as it later does, see \ninfra Part VI, Act 620’s legislative history. In this Ruling, any and all references to “Section []” or “§ []” are to Act 620 \nas codified in Louisiana Revised Statutes. Act 620 also amended Sections 1299.35.2.1 and 2175.3(2) and (5). \n \n2 The identities of the Plaintiff Doctors as well as the other Louisiana abortion physicians who are not parties–Doctors. \nDoe 3, 4, 5, and 6 (individually, “Doe 3,” “Doe 4,” “Doe 5,” “Doe 6”)–are protected by virtue of two protective orders. \n(Docs. 24, 55.) Rather than repeating the formulation “Dr. Doe [],” this Court opts for the simpler “Doe []” and, only \noccasionally, “Dr. Doe [].” \n \n8 \n \n\nthe hearing on the preliminary injunction.  The record from the preliminary injunction trial is part \nof the merits trial record, together with the stipulations of the parties. \n  The hearing on the Motion for Preliminary Injunction was held from June 22, 2015, through \nJune 29, 2015. (Docs. 163–64, 166, 169, 174.) At the hearing, the Court received evidence in the \nform of live witness testimony, exhibits, stipulations, and designated deposition testimony agreed \nby Plaintiffs and Defendant (collectively, “Parties”) to be received in lieu of certain witness’ live \ntestimony.  Plaintiffs presented live testimony from the following witnesses: \n  -  Doe 1; \n  -  Doe 2; \n  -  Doe 3;  \n  -  Ms. Kathaleen Pittman (“Pittman”), June’s administrator; and \n  -  Kliebert; and \n  -  Three experts, specifically:  \n    -  Doctor Christopher M. Estes (“Estes”), Chief Medical Officer of Planned \nParenthood of South Florida and the Treasure Coast, (PX 92); \n    -  Doctor Sheila Katz (“Katz”), an assistant professor at the University of \nHouston, (JX 91); and  \n    -  Doctor Eva Karen Pressman (“Pressman”), the Henry A. Thiede Professor \nand Chair of The Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at The \nUniversity of Rochester, (PX 94). \n \n \n9 \n \n\nDefendant presented live testimony at trial from the following witnesses: \n  -  Ms. Cecile Castello (“Castello”), Director of Health Standards Section (“HSS”) for \nDHH; and \n  -  Three other experts, specifically:  \n    -  Doctor Robert Marier (“Marier”), Chairman of the Department of Hospital \nMedicine at Ochsner Medical Center in New Orleans, (DX 146); \n    -  Doctor Tumulesh Kumar Singh Solanky (“Solanky”), a professor and the \nchair of the Mathematics Department at the University of New Orleans, \n(DX 148); and \n    -  Doctor Damon Thomas Cudihy (“Cudihy”), an obstetrician-gynaecologist \n(“OB/GYN,” “Ob/Gyn,” “OBG,” or “O&G”) currently licensed to practice \nmedicine in Louisiana and Texas, (DX 147).  \nA record of the exhibits admitted into evidence was filed. (Doc. 165.) A record of the deposition \ntestimony designated by the Parties and offered into evidence was also docketed. (Doc. 168.3) In \naddition, the Parties submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, (Docs. 196, 200), \nand responses to each other’s proposed findings and conclusions, (Docs. 201, 202). Additional \nstipulations of fact were submitted by the parties. (Docs. 224, 255, 265, 271.) \n  In making the following findings of fact and conclusions of law, the Court has considered \nthe record as a whole. The Court has observed the demeanor of witnesses and has carefully weighed \ntheir testimony and credibility in determining the facts of this case and drawing conclusions from \n                                                 \n3 Cochran’s deposition appears in Document 168-4, Doe 4’s in Document 168-5, Doe 5’s in Document 168-6, Ms. \nHedra Dubea’s in Document 168-7, Mr. Robert Gross’ in Document 168-8, Ms. Dora Kane’s in Document 168-9, \nDoctor Cecilia Mouton’s in Document 168-10, and Ms. Jennifer Christine Stevens in Document 168-11. \n10 \n \n\nthose facts. All findings of fact contained herein that are more appropriately considered conclusions \nof law are to be so deemed.4 Likewise, any conclusions of law more appropriately considered a \nfinding of fact shall be so classified.5 \nAfter having considered the evidence, briefing, and record as a whole, for the reasons \nwhich follow, the Court declares Act 620 unconstitutional in all of its applications, and enters a \npermanent injunction barring its enforcement.   The active admitting privileges requirement of \nSection A(2)(a) of Act 620 is found to be a violation of the substantive due process right of \nLouisiana women to obtain an abortion, a right guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the \nUnited States Constitution as established in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), and pursuant to the \ntest first set forth in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 \n(1992) (“Casey”), and subsequently refined in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, 136 S. Ct. \n2292, 2319 (2016) (hereinafter “WWH”).  Act 620 is therefore declared unconstitutional, and its \nenforcement enjoined in all of its applications. \nFINDINGS OF FACT \nII.   Background and Procedural History \n  1.  Plaintiffs are:  \n  -  Hope, a licensed abortion clinic located in Shreveport, Louisiana, suing on behalf \nof its physicians, staff and patients;  \n                                                 \n4 For an example of such an approach, see Doc. 14021, No. 2:10-md-02179-CJB-SS (E.D. La. Jan. 15, 2015).   \n \n5 Id. \n \n11 \n \n\n  -  Bossier, a licensed abortion clinic located in Bossier City, Louisiana, suing on \nbehalf of its physicians, staff, and patients;6 \n  -  Choice, a licensed abortion clinic suing on behalf of its physicians, staff, and \npatients;  \n  -  Doe 1, a physician licensed to practice medicine in the State of Louisiana and \nboard-certified in Family Medicine and Addiction Medicine, suing on his own \nbehalf and that of his patients; and \n  -  Doe 2, a physician licensed to practice medicine in the State of Louisiana and \nboard-certified in OB/GYN, suing on his own behalf and that of his patients. \n2. Dr. Rebekah Gee, (“Defendant,” “Gee,” or “Secretary,”) is the Secretary of DHH.7\n \n \nPursuant to § 40.2175.6, Gee “has the authority to revoke or deny clinics’ licenses for violation of \nthis or any other law.”  (Doc. 109 at 5 (citing La. Rev. Stat. § 40:2175.6).) \n  3. On August 22, 2014, Plaintiffs filed the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, \n(Doc. 1), and the Application, (Doc. 5), seeking to enjoin various defendants from enforcing Act \n620’s Section (A)(2)(a). (Doc. 5-2 at 2–5.)  \n  4. Act 620 has been codified at an amended Section 40:1299.35.2. LA. R.S. § 40:1299.35.2. \nSection  A(2)(a)  requires  every  doctor  who  performs  abortions  in  Louisiana  to  have  “active \nadmitting privileges” at a hospital within 30 miles of the facility where abortions are performed. Id. \n§ 40:1299.35.2A(2)(a). While the Act contains other requirements, this provision is the only one \n                                                 \n6 On or about March 30, 2017, Plaintiff Bossier ceased business and surrendered its license, returning it to DHH. \n(Doc. 271.) \n7 Secretary Gee took office in January 2016, replacing former Secretary of DHH Kathleen Kliebert, who was originally \nnamed in this lawsuit.  Throughout these findings of fact and conclusions of law, references to “Secretary,” “Secretary \nGee,” “Secretary Kliebert,” “Gee” or “Kliebert,” should be read as references to the Secretary of DHH. \n \n12 \n \n\nbeing challenged. (Doc 5-1 at 8 n.1.) Act 620 was signed into law by the Governor of Louisiana, \nthe Honorable Piyush “Bobby” Jindal (“Jindal” or “Governor”), on June 12, 2014. (Doc. 138 at 2; \nsee also, e.g., H.B. 388, 2014 Leg., Reg. Sess. (La. 2014) (signed by Governor, June 12, 2014).) Its \neffective date was set as September 1, 2014. (See, e.g., Doc. 5-1 at 8; Doc. 5-2 at 6.)  Shortly before \ntrial, on April 20, 2015, DHH promulgated implementing regulations that include an admitting \nprivileges requirement repeating the language of Act 620 and a penalty provision of $4,000 per \nviolation. La. Admin. Code tit. 48, pt. I, §§ 4401 (definition of “active admitting privileges”), \n4423(B)(3)(e), available at 41 La. Reg. 685, 696 (Apr. 20. 2015).  These were accompanied by a \nstatement averring that they “will only be enforced pursuant to Order” in the present case.  Id.  The \nOrder the Court issues today thus embraces these regulations as well as the Act itself. \n5. Hope is one of three remaining licensed abortion clinics in Louisiana still operating. \n(See, e.g., Doc. 109 ¶¶ 4–5; Doc. 14 ¶ 10 at 3.)  It is located in Shreveport. Causeway was an \nabortion clinic in Metairie.   On January 26, 2016, this Court entered a preliminary injunction \nthat  did  not  encompass  Causeway’s  primary  physician,  Doe  4, who  immediately  ceased \nproviding abortions.   (Doc. 216, at 112; Doc. 255 ¶ 1.)   The parties entered into a stipulation \nthat would extend the injunction to him, which this Court so ordered on February 5, 2016.  (Doc. \n224.)  Causeway closed permanently.  (Doc. 255 ¶ 2.)  It returned its license to DHH, effective \nFebruary 10, 2016.   (Doc. 255 ¶ 3.)  Bossier was an abortion clinic in Bossier City. On or about \nMarch 30, 2017, Bossier ceased business and surrendered its license, returning it to DHH. (See \nDoc. 271.)  Does 1 and 2 are two of five remaining physicians performing abortions in Louisiana.  \nDoe 1 performs abortions at Hope; Doe 2 performed abortion at Bossier, and now performs \n13 \n \n\nabortions at Hope.  (Doc. 109 ¶¶ 10–11; see also, e.g., Doc. 14 ¶¶ 14–15; Doc. 272 ¶ 3.)  Doe 4 \nno longer offers abortion care in Louisiana.  (Doc. 255 ¶ 1.) \n  6. The Court issued the TRO on August 31, 2014, enjoining enforcement of Act 620 “until \na hearing is held for the purpose of determining whether a preliminary injunction should issue.” \n(Doc. 31 at 18.) Per this order, Plaintiffs were expected to continue seeking admitting privileges at \nthe relevant hospitals. (Id. at 1–2.) Thus, the Act would be allowed to take effect, but the Plaintiffs \nwould not be subject to its penalties and sanctions for practicing without the relevant admitting \nprivileges during the application process. (Id. at 2, 18.) The Plaintiff Clinics were allowed to operate \nlawfully while the Plaintiff Doctors continued their efforts to obtain privileges. (Id.)  \n  7.  On  September  19,  2014,  three  other  plaintiffs–Women’s  Health  Care  Center,  Inc. \n(“Women’s Health” or “Women’s Clinic”); Delta Clinic of Baton Rouge, Inc. (“Delta”); Doctor \nJohn  Doe  5  (“Doe  5”);  and  Doctor  John  Doe  6  (“Doe  6”)  (collectively,  “Women’s  Health \nPlaintiffs”)–filed the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, thereby initiating a separate \ncase, and a Motion for Preliminary Injunction. (Docs. 1, 5, No.  3:14-cv-00597-JWD-RLB.) On \nthat same day, these parties tendered a motion to consolidate their case with this earlier proceeding. \n(Doc. 2, No. 3:14-cv-00597-JWD-RLB.) By this Court’s order, these two cases were consolidated \non September 24, 2014. (Doc. 8, No. 3:14-cv-00597-JWD-RLB.) \n  8. All the Parties agreed in briefs and orally at a status conference held on September 30, \n2014, that significant discovery would need to be done to prepare for the hearing; therefore, the \nCourt set the preliminary injunction hearing for March 30, 2015. (Doc. 45.) A Joint Proposed \nScheduling Order was submitted by the Parties on October 8, 2014, (Doc. 49), and adopted as this \nCourt’s order on October 21, 2014, (Doc. 56). \n14 \n \n\n  9. On November 3, 2014, following the addition of the Women’s Health Plaintiffs, this \nCourt issued the Order Clarifying Temporary Restraining Order of August 31, 2014. (Doc. 57.) For \nthe reasons given therein, the Court ruled: “It was and is the intention of this Court that the TRO \nremain in effect as to all parties before it until the end of the Preliminary Injunction Hearing.” (Id. \nat 6.) \n  10. On December 5, 2014, the Women’s Health Plaintiffs filed the Motion for Voluntary \nDismissal. (Doc. 70.) With the consent of the Parties, the Court dismissed this suit without prejudice \non December 14, 2014. (Doc. 77.) In light of that dismissal, the Court on January 15, 2015, issued \nthe Second Order Clarifying Temporary Restraining Order of August 31, 2014. (Doc. 84.) In this \norder, for reasons explained therein, this Court ruled that “the TRO of August 31, 2014 (Doc. 31) \nremains in force until the Preliminary Injunction hearing on March 30, 2015 or as otherwise \nmodified by this Court.” (Id. at 4.)  \n  11. On February 16, 2015, Defendants filed the Motion for Partial Summary Judgment \n(“Partial MSJ”), (Doc. 87), which was opposed, (Doc. 104). On February 24, 2015, Defendants \nfiled an Unopposed Motion to Set Oral Argument on Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Doc. \n90.) On March 3, 2015, the Court granted that motion, (Doc. 92), and oral argument was set and \nheard on March 19, 2015, (Docs. 128, 137).  \n12. On May 12, 2015, the Partial MSJ was granted in part, finding that under then- \nbinding  Fifth  Circuit  jurisprudence,  the  admitting  privileges  requirement  of  Act  620  was \n“rationally related” to a legitimate state interest. (Doc. 138 at 25.) In all other respects, the motion \nwas denied.  (Id.)8 \n                                                 \n8 WWH states that this Court must “consider the existence or nonexistence of medical benefits when considering \nwhether a regulation of abortion constitutes an undue burden.”  WWH, 136 S. Ct. at 2309.  Therefore, summary \n15 \n \n\n  13. Based on a stipulation reached among the Parties, the Joint Motion to Dismiss Defendant \nMark Dawson was filed on March 17, 2015, (Doc. 110), and granted the same day, (Doc. 111). On \nMarch 20, 2015, the Parties conferred with the Court and agreed to a continuance of the hearing on \nthe preliminary injunction until the week of June 22, 2015. (Doc. 129.) The Parties agreed that the \nTRO would remain in effect until the completion of the trial and ruling on the merits of the \npreliminary injunction. (Id.) \n  14. On April 1, 2015, oral argument was heard on motions in limine filed by the Parties. \n(Docs. 136, 151.) In the ruling issued that same day, the Court denied Plaintiffs’ Motion in Limine \nto Preclude Expert Testimony of Dr. Tumulesh Solanky, (Doc. 96), and Defendant’s Motion to \nExclude Expert Testimony of Sheila Katz, Ph.D., (Doc. 99). (Doc. 136.) Plaintiffs’ Motion in \nLimine to Preclude Expert Testimony of Dr. McMillan, (Doc. 97), was denied as moot. (Doc. 136.) \nBecause of their connection to the Partial MSJ, Defendant’s Motion in Limine to Exclude Irrelevant \nEvidence (“Defendant’s Motion in Limine”), (Doc. 95), and Plaintiffs’ Motion in Limine to \nPreclude Evidence of DHH Deficiency Reports and Related Evidence, (Doc. 98), were taken under \nadvisement. (Doc. 136.) These two motions were ultimately denied. (Docs. 139, 140.) \n  15. On June 11, 2015, Defendant filed the Motion to Reconsider Rulings on Summary \nJudgment and Motion in Limine. (Doc. 144.) Plaintiffs submitted their response in opposition on \nJune 16, 2015. (Doc. 150.) Because this was submitted for consideration only six days before trial, \nthe motion was taken under advisement and deferred to trial.  \n                                                 \njudgment on the issue of whether Act 620 was “rationally related” to the State’s asserted interest in maternal health is \nnot a proper application of the undue burden standard.  This Court will not revisit the summary judgment decision, but \nthis opinion supersedes that ruling. \n16 \n \n\n  16. Trial on the Motion for Preliminary Injunction began on June 22, 2015, and ended on \nJune 29, 2015. (Docs. 163, 164, 166–69, 174). The Redacted Transcript9 of the trial was later \ndocketed.10  (Docs.  190–95.)  On  January  26,  2016,  the  Court  declared  Act  620  facially \nunconstitutional and entered a preliminary injunction against enforcement of Act 620 as to the \nPlaintiffs – Hope, Bossier, Causeway and Does 1 and 2.  (Doc. 216, at 111–112.)  The parties \nstipulated that the injunction would also include Doe 4.  (Docs. 224, 226.)  The Court’s judgment \nwas entered on February 10, 2016 (Doc. 227) and Defendant filed her notice of appeal with the \nFifth Circuit. (Doc. 228.) This Court denied Defendant’s motions for a temporary stay and for a \nstay pending appeal (Doc. 229) on February 16, 2016 (Doc. 234). \n17. On February 24, 2016, the Fifth Circuit granted Defendant’s emergency motion for a \nstay pending appeal, June Medical Services, L.L.C. v. Gee, 814 F.3d 319 (5th Cir. 2016), with the \nresult that, for the first time, the admitting privileges requirement of Act 620 became enforceable, \nrequiring doctors without active admitting privileges to stop providing abortion care, and clinics \nwithout such doctors on staff, to stop providing abortion services.   \n18. On March 4, 2016, the United States Supreme Court granted Plaintiffs’ emergency \nmotion to vacate the Fifth Circuit’s stay, reinstating this Court’s preliminary injunction.  June \nMed. Servs., L.L.C. v. Gee, 136 S. Ct. 1354 (2016).  \n                                                 \n9 The unredacted transcript was sealed on the joint motion of the Parties. (Doc. 183.)  \n10 Each of the six volumes of testimony corresponds to the trial day in which the evidence was received: Document \n190 is Volume I, June 22; Document 191 is Volume II, June 23; Document 192 is Volume III, June 24; Document \n193 is Volume IV, June 25; Document 194 is Volume V, June 26; and Document 195 are Volume VI, June 29. \nDocument 190 (or Volume I) contains the testimony of Pittman, Doe 3, and Estes; Document 191 (or Volume II), that \nof Doe 2, Katz, and Kliebert; Document 192 (or Volume III), that of Doe 1 and Castello; Document 193 (or Volume \nIV), that of Marier and Solanky; Document 194 (or Volume V), that of Cudihy; Document 195 (or volume VI), that \nof Pressman.      \n17 \n \n\n19.  On August 8, 2016, the parties agreed at a status conference that the Court could \nproceed to rule on a permanent  injunction based on the existing evidentiary record and a \nstipulation regarding Causeway and Doe 4, following submission of supplementary proposed \nfindings of fact and conclusions of law (Doc. 253).  On August 24, 2016, the Fifth Circuit \nremanded Defendant’s appeal “so that the district court can engage in additional fact finding \nrequired by the decision in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt.” (Doc. 254.) \n20. The Court today reaffirms its declaration that the admitting privileges requirement of \nAct 620 is unconstitutional on its face, and enters a permanent injunction barring enforcement of \nthe law in all of its applications. \nIII.  Contentions of the Parties \n  21. The Court acknowledges that the following summary of the parties’ contentions reflects \nthe parties’ positions on issues of fact relating to preliminary, rather than permanent injunctive relief, \nand were made prior to the WWH decision.  For the most part, however, the summary remains \naccurate. See Docs. 256 and 257-1. \n  22. In broad terms,11 Plaintiffs contend that Act 620 is facially12 unconstitutional first, \nbecause the Act places an undue burden on the right of Louisiana women seeking an abortion by \nplacing substantial obstacles in their path, (See, e.g., Doc. 202 at 46–53);13 second, because the \n                                                 \n11 The Parties’ specific contentions underlying these broad positions are discussed in connection with the individual \nissues to which they are relevant.   \n \n12 Plaintiffs state emphatically that they are not making an “as-applied” challenge and that their only challenge is \nfacial. (Doc. 202 at 53.) \n \n13 Page references to the Parties’ briefs and other docketed documents are to the docketed document’s page number \nand not its internal pagination. In contrast, for exhibits, this Court will employ their internal page number so as to \npermit a reader to more easily and quickly locate the relevant data. \n18 \n \n\npurpose of the Act is to create those obstacles, (see, e.g., id. at 53–58) and third, because Act 620 \ndoes not further a valid state interest, (see, e.g., id. at 58–65).  \n  23. Plaintiffs argue that a preliminary injunction should issue enjoining the enforcement of \nAct 620 because Plaintiffs are likely to succeed at trial, (Doc. 196 at 67–85); absent an injunction, \nirreparable harm will occur, (id. at 85–86); the balance of hardships weighs in Plaintiffs’ favor, (id. \nat 86–87); and finally, granting the preliminary injunction will not adversely affect the public \ninterest, (id.). \n  24. Defendant counters broadly that Act 620 places no substantial burden on a woman’s \nright to seek an abortion in Louisiana, (see, e.g., Doc. 200 at 59–66), and that the Act serves a valid \npurpose, (see, e.g., id. at 66–74). Further, Defendant argues that this Court has already ruled that \nAct 620 serves a valid state interest and has a rational basis. (See, e.g., id. at 6–7.)  \n  25. Defendant argues that Plaintiffs have failed to carry their burden that they are likely to \nsucceed at trial and further, urge that no irreparable harm will occur by allowing the enforcement \nof Act 620. (See, e.g., id. at 88–90.) \n  26. Finally, Defendant contends that the balance of hardships weighs in her favor and that \nthe enforcement of Act 620 will not adversely affect the public interest. (Id.) \nIV.  The Factual Issues \n  27. Four main issues of fact were tried at the June hearing:  \n  (A)  What is the purpose of Act 620?  \n  (B)  Is Act 620 medically necessary and reasonable?  \n  (C)  How, if at all, will the implementation of Act 620 affect the physicians and clinics \nwho perform abortions in the state of Louisiana?  \n19 \n \n\n  (D)  How, if at all, will the implementation of Act 620 affect the ability of Louisiana \nwomen to obtain an abortion?  \n  28. Whether these factual issues and their resolution are relevant under the applicable legal \nstandard, and whether they play a role in this Court’s ruling, is discussed in the Conclusions of Law \nsection. See infra Parts XI–XII. \nV.  Abortion in Louisiana \nA.  Generally \n  29.  According  to  DHH,  approximately  10,000  women  obtain  abortions  in  Louisiana \nannually. (DX 148 ¶ 11.)  \n  30. Nationally, approximately 42% of women who have abortions fall below the federal \npoverty level, and another 27% fall below 200% of that level. (JX 124 at 480; Doc. 191 at 190–\n91.)14 That number is likely significantly higher for Louisiana women seeking abortions. (Id.) The \nexpert and lay testimony on this issue are consistent. (See, e.g., Doc. 190 at 34 (Testimony of \nPittman) (testifying that 70% to 90% of patients at Hope are below the federal poverty level).) \n  31.  Under  Louisiana  law,  a  patient  must  receive  state-mandated  counseling  and  an \nultrasound at least 24 hours before an abortion. (JX 109 ¶ 18; JX 116 ¶ 11; JX 117 ¶ 8.)  \n  32. Due to this notification and waiting period, patients who wish to obtain an abortion must \nmake two trips to the clinic: the first to receive the ultrasound and state-mandated counseling, and \nthe second to obtain the sought abortion. (JX 109 ¶ 19.)  \n \n \n                                                 \n14 The Court accepted Katz as an expert in the sociology of gender and the sociology of poverty. (Doc. 191 at 123–\n26.) The Court found Katz well qualified and credible. \n20 \n \n\nB.  The Clinics \n33. At  the  time  of  trial,  there  were  five  women’s  reproductive  health  clinics  in \nLouisiana that provided abortion services.  (See, e..g., Doc. 109 at ¶ 3; JX 109 ¶ 13.)  Since then, \ntwo of those clinics, Causeway and Bossier, have ceased operation. (Docs. 255 ¶¶ 2-3; 271.) \n(1)  Hope \n  34. Hope is a women’s reproductive health clinic located in Shreveport, Louisiana, that has \nbeen operating since 1980 and offers abortion services. (Doc. 109 at 4; see also Doc. 14 ¶ 11 at 5.) \nHope is a licensed abortion clinic suing on its own behalf and on behalf of its physicians, staff and \npatients. (Doc. 14 ¶ 11 at 5; Doc. 190 at 14.) \n  35. Hope provides medication abortions through eight weeks and surgical abortions through \n16 weeks, six days LMP.15 (Doc. 190 at 35, 119, 132.) Hope employs two doctors who perform \nabortions, Does 1 and 3. (Id. at 21.) Doe 1 performs approximately 71% of the abortions provided \nby Hope, and Doe 3 performs the remaining 29%. (Id.; JX 116 ¶ 5.)  \n  36. 69% of Hope’s patients are Louisiana residents, but the remainder travel from outside \nthe state to Hope. (JX, 116 ¶ 10; Doc. 190 at 19, 34.) \n(2)  Bossier  \n  37. On or about March 30, 2017, Bossier ceased business and surrendered its license, \nreturning it to DHH. (Doc. 271.) \n38. Bossier was a women’s reproductive health clinic that had been operating in Bossier \nCity since 1980 and provided first and second trimester abortions. (Doc. 109 at 4; Doc. 14 ¶ 12.) \n                                                 \n15 Throughout this opinion, the Court will define the length of pregnancy based on the time elapsed since the first day \nof a woman’s last menstrual period, or LMP. \n21 \n \n\nBossier was a licensed abortion clinic and a plaintiff suing on its own behalf and on behalf of its \nphysicians, staff, and patients. (Doc. 14 ¶ 12.)  \n  39. Bossier provided medication abortions through eight weeks and surgical abortions \nthrough the state’s legal limit of 21 weeks, six days LMP. (Doc. 191 at 22–23, 55–56; JX 117 ¶ 4.) \n  40. Bossier employed one doctor, Doe 2, who performs first and second trimester surgical \nprocedures as well as medication abortions. (Doc. 191 at 21; JX 117 ¶ 5.) Doe 2 is the only doctor \nin Louisiana who performs abortions after 16 weeks, six days LMP. (JX 187 ¶ 4; Doc. 191 at 21–\n22.)16  \n  41. Bossier’s patients were primarily from Louisiana, but also traveled to the clinic from \nsurrounding states. (Doc. 191 at 20.)  \n(3)  Causeway \n42. Causeway was a women’s reproductive health clinic located in Metairie, Louisiana, and \nhad provided abortion and reproductive health services since 1999.  (Docs. 109 ¶ 7; 14 ¶ \n13.)  Causeway was a licensed abortion clinic that sued on its own behalf and on behalf of its \nphysicians, staff, and patients.  (Doc. 14 at 1.) \n43. Causeway offered surgical abortions through 21 weeks, six days LMP, and did not \noffer medication abortions.  (JX 117 ¶ 4). \n44. Causeway employed two doctors who performed abortions, Does 2 and 4.   (See, \ne.g., Doc. 168-5 at 8.)   Doe 2 performed approximately 25% of the abortions provided at \nCauseway, and Doe 4 performed the remaining 75%.  (JX 117 ¶ 5.)  Doe 4 refrained from \n                                                 \n16 There is testimony that Doe 5 has also performed abortions up to 18 weeks although it is unclear whether he is \nreferring to the present or what he has done in the past. (Doc. 168-6 at 7–8.) The resolution of this issue is not critical \nto the Court’s ruling.  \n22 \n \n\nperforming any abortions at Causeway subsequent to the Court’s January 26, 2016 preliminary \ninjunction order.  (Doc. 255 ¶ 1.)  A joint stipulation was filed on February 1, 2016 (Doc. 224) \nregarding the applicability of the injunction to Doe 4 and so ordered by the Court on February 5, \n2016 (Doc. 226.)  Causeway returned its license to DHH, effective February 10, 2016.  (Doc. 255 \n¶ 3.) \n(4)  Women’s Health \n  45. Women’s Health is a women’s reproductive health care clinic located in New Orleans, \nLouisiana, and has provided abortion and women’s reproductive health services since 2001. (Doc. \n109 at 5; JX 168 ¶ 1; JX 110 ¶ 1.) \n  46. Women’s Health employs two doctors who perform abortions, Does 5 and 6. (JX 110 ¶ \n3; JX 168 ¶ 4.) Doe 5 performs approximately 40% of the abortions provided at Women’s Clinic, \nand Doe 6 performs the remaining 60%. (JX 110 ¶ 3; JX 168 ¶ 4.) \n  47.  Women’s  Health  provides  surgical  abortions  for  women  through  16  weeks  and \nmedication abortions through eight weeks. (Doc. 168-4 at 19.17) Doe 6 provides only medication \nabortions. (Id. at 55.)18       \n(5)  Delta \n  48. Delta is a women’s reproductive health care clinic located in Baton Rouge, and has \nprovided abortion and women’s reproductive health services since 2001. (Doc. 109 at 5.) \n  49. Delta employs one doctor who performs abortions, Doe 5. (JX 110 ¶ 35.)     \n                                                 \n17 The designated deposition testimony appears within the larger docketed document. (Doc. 168.) For the sake of \nconsistency and ease, the Court continues to use the page numbers of the uploaded document and not of the \ndeposition transcript itself. \n \n18 See infra note 18. \n \n23 \n \n\n50. Delta provides surgical abortions for women through 16 weeks LMP, and medication \nabortions through eight weeks. (Doc. 168-4 at 13–14, 19.)19 \n  51. The northern part of Louisiana is now served only by Hope in Shreveport. (Docs. 191 \nat 17; 190 at 110; 271.) The southern part of this state is served by Delta in Baton Rouge and \nWomen’s Health in New Orleans. (JX 110 ¶ 1; JX 114 ¶ 1; JX 109 ¶ 13.) \n C.  The Doctors  \n52. There are currently five doctors who perform all abortions in Louisiana. (Doc. 109 \n \n¶ 4; see also, e.g., JX 109 ¶ 14; Doc. 255 ¶ 1.) \n \n(1) Doe 120 \n  53.  Doe 1 is a board-certified physician in Family Medicine and Addiction Medicine and \nis one of two clinic physicians at Hope. (Doc. 109 at 5). \n  54. Doe 1 has over 10 years of experience, seven of those as an abortion provider. (Doc. \n190 at 139–40; Doc. 14 ¶ 14.) He provides medication abortions through eight weeks and surgical \nabortions through 13 weeks, six days LMP. (Doc. 192 at 21; Doc. 190 at 132.)  \n  55. Doe 1 was trained to provide abortion services by Doe 3, the medical director of the \nHope Clinic, where they both work. (Doc. 192 at 140–41.) \n  56. Despite beginning his efforts to get admitting privileges at a nearby hospital in July \n2014, (id. at 52), Doe 1 still does not have active admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles \n                                                 \n19 Id. \n \n20 Pursuant to this Court’s order, Plaintiffs have provided monthly updates to the Court beginning in March 2016 \nregarding the status of the doctors’ applications for admitting privileges. There has been no material change to the \nprivileges status of Dr. Does 1 through 6, except that Dr. Doe 4 no longer intends to pursue hospital admitting \nprivileges in light of the closure of Causeway. (Letter of May 2, 2016, Doc. 246.) \n \n24 \n \n\nof Hope Clinic. (Doc. 190 at 21.) The efforts of all six doctors to gain active admitting privileges \nand the results of those efforts are reviewed in more detail in another section of this Ruling. See \ninfra Part VIII.    \n(2)  Doe 2 \n  57.  Doe 2 is a board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist and had been, until February 2016, \none of two clinic physicians at Causeway and the only clinic physician at Bossier who, while that \nclinic was in operation, provided abortion services there.  (Doc. 109 at ¶ 11; Doc. 255 ¶ 3.)  \n  58. Since Bossier’s closure, Doe 2 has entered into a working agreement with Hope to \nprovide abortion services when Hope’s primary physicians, Doe 1 and Doe 3, are unavailable to \nperform abortions. (Doc. 272 ¶¶ 3—4.)  \n   59.  Doe 2 has been performing abortions since 1980.  (Doc. 191 at 17:3-6.)  Doe 2 performs \nmedication abortions through eight weeks and surgical abortions up through the state’s legal limit \nof 21 weeks, six days LMP. (Id. 21:16-22:4; JX 187 ¶ 4). He performs medication and surgical \nabortions at Bossier, and had performed only surgical abortions at Causeway. (Id. at 22:3-11.)  In \nthe year prior to trial, Doe 2 performed approximately 550 abortions at Bossier and 450 abortions \nat Causeway (Id. at 17:21-18:5). \n  60. Doe 2 performs first and second trimester surgical abortions through 21 weeks, six days \nLMP, and is the only one of two physicians in Louisiana to offer abortion after 16 weeks, six days \nLMP. (Id. at 21–22.)21  \n  61. Doe 2 has been unsuccessful in getting active admitting privileges within 30 miles of \nBossier and, prior to Causeway’s closure, had been able to obtain only limited privileges, which \n                                                 \n21 Id. \n25 \n \n\ndid not meet the requirements of Act 620, within 30 miles of Causeway.  (See, e.g., Doc. 191 at \n24:23-29:18.) \n (3)  Doe 3 \n  62. Doe 3 is a board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist and one of two clinic physicians at \nHope. (Doc. 109 at 5.) He is also the medical director at Hope. (Id.) \n  63. Doe 3 has been licensed to practice medicine in Louisiana since 1976. (Doc. 190 at 109.) \nIn addition to his abortion practice, he has an active general OB/GYN practice, where he delivers \nbabies and routinely performs gynecological surgery including hysterectomies, laparoscopies, and \ndilation and curettages (“D&Cs”). (Id. at 110.) \n  64. Doe 3 is the chief medical officer of Hope Clinic, where he has worked since 1981. \n(Doc. 190 at 108, 117, 21.) He provides medication abortions through eight weeks and surgical \nabortions through 16 weeks, six days LMP. (Id. at 35, 119, 132.) \n  65. Doe 3 performs abortions at Hope Clinic on Thursday afternoons and all day on \nSaturday. He sees approximately 20 to 30 abortion patients a week. (Id. at 117–18, 153.) On \noccasion, he will cover for Doe 1 and will see more patients in those instances. (Id.) \n  66.  Doe  3  currently  has  admitting  privileges  at  Willis-Knighton  Hospital  in  Bossier \n(“WKB”) and at Christus Highland Medical Center in Bossier (“Christus”), both of which are \nwithin 30 miles of Hope Clinic. (Id. at 21–22, 120, 148–49.) Doe 3’s current privileges at Christus \nrequire him to admit approximately 50 patients per year. (Id. at 150–52; JX 59.) \n  67. Doe 3 has his current admitting privileges because he regularly admits patients to the \nhospital as part of his private OB/GYN practice, not because of his work at Hope Clinic. (Id. at \n124, 147.)      \n26 \n \n\n(4)  Doe 4 \n  68.  Doe 4 is a board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist and had been one of two clinic \nphysicians at Causeway.  (Doc. 109 at 5, ¶ 13.) \n69. Doe 4 obtained his license to practice medicine in Maryland in 1959 and in Louisiana \nin 1965. (Doc. 168-5 at 5-6.)  He served as an assistant professor or assistant instructor in obstetrics \nand gynecology for seventeen years at Earl K. Long Hospital.  (Id. at 12.) \n  70. When Doe 4 maintained a full OB/GYN practice, he had admitting privileges at four \nhospitals in the Baton Rouge area. (Doc. 168-5 at 6.) He was required to have admitting privileges \nto do OB/GYN surgery and, in his words, “to deliver babies.” (Id.)  The existence of these privileges \ndid not benefit his pregnancy termination patients because, to his knowledge, none of his abortion \npatients experienced any problem and required hospital admission.  (Id. at 19-20.) \n71. Doe 4 performed abortions at Causeway in Metairie until January 2016. (Doc. 109 at 5, \n¶ 13; Doc. 168-5 at 8; Doc. 255 ¶ 1.)  He was not able to get admitting privileges at a hospital within \n30 miles of Causeway.  (Doc. 191 at 18:6-19; see also, e.g., Doc. 168-5 at 16.) \n(5)  Doe 5 \n  72. Doe 5 is a board certified obstetrician-gynecologist. (Doc. 109 at 5; see also Doc. 168-\n6 at 4–5.) He is one of two clinic physicians at Women’s Clinic and the only clinic physician at \nDelta Clinic. (Doc. 109 at 5; see also Doc. 168-6 at 4, 13–14, 22.) \n  73. Doe 5 has been licensed to practice medicine in Louisiana since 2005. (Doc. 168-6 at \n5.) He provides surgical abortions at Delta Clinic and Women’s Health through 16 weeks LMP. \n(Id. at 20; see also JX 110 ¶ 1.)22   \n                                                 \n22 Id. \n27 \n \n\n  74. Doe 5 has been successful in getting active admitting privileges within 30 miles of \nWomen’s Health in New Orleans but has been unsuccessful in his efforts to get active admitting \nprivileges within 30 miles of Delta in Baton Rouge. (Doc. 168-6 at 11–13; see also, e.g., JX 109 ¶¶ \n33–34; JX 110 ¶¶ 15–19.) \n(6)  Doe 6 \n  75. Doe 6 is a board certified obstetrician-gynecologist and one of two clinic physicians at \nWomen’s Health. (Doc. 109 at 5; see also Doc. 168-4 at 13.) \n  76. Doe 6 has been practicing medicine for 48 years. (JX 109 ¶ 8.) He is currently the \nmedical director of Women’s Clinic and Delta Clinic. (Id.) Doe 6 provides only medication \nabortions and does so only at Women’s Clinic. (Id. ¶¶ 8–9.) \n  77. Doe 6 has been unsuccessful in his efforts to get active admitting privileges within 30 \nmiles of Women’s. (Id. ¶¶ 23–26.) \nD.  Admitting Privileges in Louisiana \n  78. In order to perform abortions legally in Louisiana, Act 620 requires an abortion doctor \nto have “active admitting privileges” at a hospital within 30 miles of the facility where he or she \nperforms abortions. LA. R.S. § 40:1299.35.2A(2)(A). To have “active admitting privileges” the \nphysician must be a “member in good standing of the medical staff” of a hospital “with the ability \nto admit a patient and to provide diagnostic and surgical services to such patient . . . .” Id. The \nphrase “member in good standing of the medical staff” is not separately defined. (Cf. Doc. 193 at \n12.)  \n28 \n \n\n  79. Thus, how a physician may obtain “medical staff” and “active admitting” privileges \nfrom a Louisiana hospital is critical in determining the effect, if any, that Act 620 has on abortion \nproviders and, in turn, the women that they serve. \n  80. The expert testimony regarding hospital admitting privileges came primarily from two \nexperts–Pressman, Plaintiffs’ expert, (Doc. 195 at 11–96), and Marier, Defendant’s (Doc. 193 at 4–\n124)–and, to a lesser extent, from the other physicians, including Does 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, who \ntestified. See supra Part I. On the issue of admitting privileges and hospital credentialing, the Court \nfound both Pressman and Marier to be generally well qualified. \n  81. Additional information about the credentialing process and the specific requirements of \nvarious hospitals came from certain hospital by-laws introduced into evidence. (See, e.g., JX 46, \n48, 67, 72, 76, 78–79, 81, 138, 140–43.) \n  82. Credentialing is a process that hospitals employ to determine what doctors will be \nallowed to perform what tasks within that hospital. (Doc. 193 at 11; see also, e.g., Doc. 195 at 23–\n27; Doc. 168-5 at 24.) \n  83. Part of this process involves the hospital’s granting or denying “admitting privileges.” \n(See, e.g., Doc. 193 at 20; Doc. 195 at 17, 23–25.)  These privileges govern whether or not a \nphysician is authorized to admit and treat a patient at that hospital and what care, services and \ntreatment the physician is authorized to provide. (See, e.g., Doc. 193 at 20–21; Doc. 195 at 23, 25–\n26.) \n  84. Admitting privileges are related to but not the same as being on the “medical staff” of a \nhospital. (Doc. 193 at 11; Doc. 195 at 25–26.) \n29 \n \n\n  85. There is no requirement that a physician have admitting privileges or be on the medical \nstaff at a hospital in order to practice medicine. (See, e.g., Doc. 195 at 26.) Many physicians who \ndo not have a hospital based practice, i.e. do not intend to admit and treat their patients in a hospital \nsetting, have neither as there is no need for staff or admitting privileges under those circumstances. \n(See, e.g., Doc. 175 at 75; Doc. 192 at 41–42; Doc. 195 at 75.) \n  86. There is no state or federal statute which governs the rules for the granting or denial of \nhospital admitting privileges in Louisiana.23 Cf. Planned Parenthood of Wis., Inc. v. Van Hollen, \n738 F.3d 786, 792 (7th Cir. 2013) (“The criteria for granting admitting privileges are multiple, \nvarious, and unweighted.”). Rather, partly as a consequence of this absence, these rules vary from \nhospital to hospital and are governed by each one’s distinct by-laws.24 (See, e.g., Doc. 193 at 12, \n15; Doc. 195 at 28.)  \n  87. Specifically, there is no state or federal statute which defines or sets uniform standards \nfor the categories of admitting privileges a hospital may grant. (Doc. 193 at 11–12.) Like other \nrules, these are therefore set by each hospital’s by-laws. (Id.; see also, e.g., Doc. 195 at 28; JX 81 \nat 1798.) To make matters more confusing, the terms used to describe those categories (e.g. “active \nadmitting privileges”, “courtesy admitting privileges”, “clinical admitting privileges”) vary from \n                                                 \n23 While one statute, commonly known as the Church Amendment, does impose a type of germane privileges \nrequirement on hospitals accepting federal funds, 42 U.S.C. § 300a-7(c)(1)(B), this statute was not shown to apply to \nthe hospitals involved in this case, see infra note 33. \n24 Cf. AM. MED. ASS’N, OPINION 4:07 - STAFF PRIVILEGES (June 1994) (“Privileges should not be based on numbers \nof patients admitted to the facility or the economic or insurance status of the patient. . . . Physicians who are involved \nin the granting, denying, or termination of hospital privileges have an ethical responsibility to be guided primarily by \nconcern for the welfare and best interests of patients in discharging this responsibility.”). The evidence presented in \nthis case shows that these aspirational goals are not reflected in the by-laws of the Louisiana hospitals whose rules \nand practices are before the Court.  \n30 \n \n\nhospital to hospital. (See, e.g., Doc. 190 at 167; Doc. 191 at 104; Doc. 193 at 11–12; Doc. 195 at \n28.) \n  88. Similarly, terms like “medical staff”, “active staff”, “courtesy staff”, “clinical staff” vary \namong hospitals. (Doc. 191 at 35; Doc. 193 at 12; Doc. 195 at 28; cf. JX 79 at 1707–12.)   \n  89.  For  example,  at  some  hospitals,  an  “active”  staff  appointment  does  not,  alone, \nautomatically entitle the physician to admit patients. (See, e.g., JX 46 at 185; JX 79 at 1673; JX 141 \nat 3259–60.) \n  90. Because of the varying definitions given to the categories of admitting privileges and \nthe varying requirements for the attainment of same, whether a physician has been given “active \nadmitting privileges” or is a “member in good standing on the medical staff” within the meaning of \nAct 620 entirely depends upon the specific definition, requirements and restrictions imposed by a \ngiven hospital in a given circumstance. (See, e.g., Doc. 193 at 12.) \n  91. Unlike some states,25  there is also no statute or rule in Louisiana which sets a maximum \ntime period within which a physician’s application for admitting privileges must be acted upon. \nThus, unless there is such a time limit in the hospital’s by-laws, a hospital can effectively deny a \ndoctor’s application of privileges by never acting on it, a decision on any one doctor’s application \npermanently delayed without a consequence being effected or a reason being given. A definite \ndecision stays unreached–but, with his or her request suspended, the relevant doctor’s privileges \n                                                 \n25 Texas sets a 170 day time limit within which a hospital’s credentialing committee must take final action on a \ncompleted application for medical staff membership or privileges. TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 241.101; Planned \nParenthood of Greater Tex. Surgical Health Servs. v. Abbott, 748 F.3d 583, 600 (5th Cir. 2014)(“Abbot II”) (making \nthis point). \n31 \n \n\nremain, as a matter of fact and law, nonexistent. In this Ruling, the Court uses the term “de facto \ndenial” of privileges to describe this circumstance.26 \n  92. At some hospitals in Louisiana, there are suggested time frames in which hospitals \nshould review admitting privileges applications. (JX 72 at 1320–23; see also, e.g., JX 67 at 857–\n58; JX 76 at 1444–47.) However, those guidelines are not requirements, and there is no legal \nrecourse for an applicant if the hospital fails to act on the application within the suggested time \nperiod. (See, e.g., JX 67 at 858–59; JX 72 at 1320–24; JX 109 ¶ 27.) For example, Tulane University \nMedical Center (“Tulane”) has an expectation, but has adopted no requirement, that applications \nwill be processed within 150 days. (JX 78 at 1554.) If the Board of Trustees has not taken action \non the application within 150 days, the applicant must repeat the verification process to ensure the \ninformation contained therein is still accurate. (Id.) \n  93. A hospital’s failure to act on an application by either approving or denying it may result \nin the hospital considering the application withdrawn. (See, e.g., Doc. 195 at 93; JX 71 at 1279.) In \nthis additional respect, a hospital’s failure to act is, in effect, a de facto denial of the application. \n                                                 \n26 In other contexts, this notion has appeared. See, e.g., Khorrami v. Rolince, 539 F.3d 782, 786 (7th Cir. 2008) \n(observing that a judicial ruling’s delay can sometimes be “so long . . . that the delay becomes a de facto denial”); \nMorgan v. Gandalf, Ltd., 165 F. App’x 425, 431 (6th Cir. 2006) (construing a court’s failure to explain its reason as a \n“de facto denial” and reviewing such a denial for abuse of discretion); Omnipoint Commc’ns Enters., L.P. v. Zoning \nHearing Bd. of Easttown Twp., 331 F.3d 386, 393 (3d Cir. 2003) (observing that under Pennsylvania law, a de facto \nexclusion exists “where an ordinance permits a use on its face, but when applied acts to prohibit the use throughout \nthe municipality” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Alexander v. Local 496, Laborers’ Int’l Union, 177 F.3d 394, \n408–09 (6th Cir. 1999) (finding that a “longstanding and demonstrable policy” where the union's “working-in-the-\ncalling” rule, which was memorialized in its constitution and bylaws, resulted in the “de facto exclusion” of African \nAmericans from union membership). Seemingly, though also in other contexts, the Fifth Circuit has recognized such \na possibility. See Chevron USA, Inc. v. Sch. Bd. of Vermilion Parish, 294 F.3d 716, 720 (5th Cir. 2002) (“Arguably, \nthe district court’s order was a de facto denial of class certification (although the parties have not treated it as such, \nand no motion for class certification was ever filed).”).  \n32 \n \n\n  94. While a physician’s competency is a factor in assessing an applicant for admitting \nprivileges, it is only one factor that hospitals consider in whether to grant privileges. (See, e.g., \nDoc. 190 at 158–59; Doc. 195 at 25–26; Doc. 192 at 50–51; Doc. 168-5 at 17; Doc. 168-6 at 12; \nJX 110 ¶ 10; JX 168 ¶¶ 11–13, 17; PX 183.) \n  95. Defendant argues: “When Louisiana hospitals decide whether to grant a physician staff \nmembership, privileges to admit patients, or privileges to perform particular procedures, hospital \nby-laws indicate that they may make such determinations based on the physician’s prior and current \npractice, and indicia of the physician’s clinical competence.”27 (Doc. 200 ¶ 114 at 38 (citing to JX \n2873; JX 1838; JX 1542–43; JX 852–53).) \n  96. The Court finds that this is only partly true because both by virtue of by-laws and how \nprivileges applications are handled in actual practice, hospitals may deny privileges or decline to \nconsider an application for privileges for myriad reasons unrelated to competency. Examples \ninclude the physician’s expected usage of the hospital and intent to admit and treat patients there, \nthe number of patients the physician has treated in the hospital in the recent past, the needs of the \nhospital, the mission of the hospital, or the business model of the hospital. Furthermore, hospitals \nmay grant privileges only to physicians employed by and on the staff of the hospital. And \nuniversity-affiliated hospitals may grant privileges only to faculty members. These possible \nvariances in causes and justification for any particular denial are attested to by this case’s \nevidentiary submissions and testimony. (See, e.g., Doc. 195 at 25–26; Doc. 190 at 123, 168–70; \nDoc. 193 at 82–83; JX 109 ¶¶ 27–28; JX 110 ¶ 10; JX 168 ¶¶ 11–13, 17; Doc. 168-5 at 6, 23.) \n                                                 \n27 The Defendant’s briefing cites exhibits by Bates page numbers rather than exhibit numbers. \n33 \n \n\n  97. An apparently benign example of such a non-competency based, business driven reason \nfor  denying  privileges  is  the  denial  of  Doe  1’s  application  to  the  Minden  Medical  Center \n(“Minden”). (JX 50 at 318; Doc. 192 at 50–51.) In declining his application for staff membership \nand clinical privileges, Minden’s Medical Staff Coordinator wrote to Doe 1: “Since we do not have \na need for a satellite primary care physician at this time, I am returning your application and check.” \n(JX 50 at 318; see also JX 72 at 1323.) \n  98. When they had full OB/GYN practices delivering babies and performing gynecological \nsurgery, Does 2, 4, and 6 had no problem obtaining and maintaining admitting privileges at a \nnumber of hospitals. (See, e.g., Doc. 168-5 at 6–8; JX 109 ¶ 30.) However, under Act 620, for \nreasons unrelated to competency, they are now unable to secure active admitting privileges. (See, \ne.g., Doc. 191 at 24–26; Doc. 168-5 at 16–17; JX 109 ¶¶ 23, 30, 31–34.) \n  99. Another example of a non-competency based application criteria is that some hospitals \nrequire the physician seeking privileges to live and/or practice within a certain distance of the \nhospital. (JX 83 at 1865; JX 139-a at 2925; JX 79 at 1679–83.) Does 2 and 5 travel significant \ndistances from their respective homes to provide abortion services and would not be able to meet \nthis criteria for hospitals within 30 miles of some or all of the clinics where they provide abortions. \n(Docs. 191 at 20–21; 168-6 at 4, 11–13; JX 109 ¶¶ 31–36.) \n  100.  Defendant  argues  that  “[t]here  is  no  evidence  suggesting  that,  in  making  the \ndeterminations about staff membership or privileges, Louisiana hospitals discriminate against \nphysicians based on whether they provide elective abortions.” (Doc. 200 ¶ 115 at 38 (citing Marier’s \ntestimony,  as  it  appears  on  Doc.  193  at  83–86).)  In  his  testimony,  however,  Marier  only \nacknowledged that he personally knew of no hospitals which refused to extend privileges to a doctor \n34 \n \n\n“simply because he or she performs an abortion.” (Doc. 193 at 83–85.) Regardless, to the extent \nMarier’s testimony can be so construed, the Court finds his testimony on this point to be not credible \nand contradicted by an abundance of evidence introduced at the hearing demonstrating that \nhospitals can and do deny privileges for reasons directly related to a physician’s status as an \nabortion provider. (See, e.g., Docs. 168-6 at 12; 190 at 53; JX 109 ¶¶ 28, 30, 39.) \n  101. For instance, Doe 1 contacted the director of the Family Medicine Department at \nUniversity Health Hospital in Shreveport (“University” or “University Health”)28 where he had \ndone his residency in family medicine. Dr. Doe 1 was initially told that he would be offered a job \nas a faculty member teaching sports medicine which would “take care of the admitting privileges \nthing.” (Doc. 192 at 45.) Doe 1 was told that the application forms for admitting privileges would \nbe forwarded to him. (Id.) \n  102. When Doe 1 did not get the application forms and inquired, he was told by the director \nof the department that he would not be offered a position because “there was some objection from \ncertain staff about [Doe 1] coming to work there because of where [he] work[ed], at Hope Medical.” \n(Id. at 45–46.)29 \n                                                 \n28 This hospital is a teaching hospital associated with LSU Medical School and is sometimes referred to as LSU \nShreveport Hospital. (See, e.g., JX 79; Doc. 192 at 19, 47.) \n \n29 This testimony was objected to as hearsay, which objection was overruled. (Doc. 192 at 46:7-13.) It was overruled \nfor two reasons.  First, the ordinary rules of admissibility are relaxed in a preliminary injunction hearing and hearsay \nmay be admitted. See, e.g., Sierra Club, Loan Star Chapter v. FDIC, 992 F.2d 545, 551 (5th Cir. 1993); Fed. Sav. & \nLoan Ins. Corp. v. Dixon, 835 F.2d 554, 558 (5th Cir. 1987); see also 11A Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, \nFederal Practice & Procedure § 2949 (3d. 2015).  Although the present opinion is no longer considering a preliminary \ninjunction, by virtue of their agreement to convert the preliminary injunction to a permanent injunction on the \nexisting record, Doc. 253, see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(a)(2), the parties have waived further evidentiary objections.   \nSecond, as this testimony was presented so as to explain Doe 1’s failure to make formal application for privileges at \nUniversity, the testimony was not offered to prove its truth and was thus, for this limited purpose, not hearsay.  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 801(c)(2). \n \n35 \n \n\n  103. This same essential response was also given to Doe 2 when he attempted to upgrade \nhis courtesy privileges at University Health. (Doc. 191 at 24–26.) \n  104. There is no Louisiana statute which prohibits a Louisiana hospital or those individuals \ncharged with credentialing responsibilities from declining an application for admitting privileges \nbased on the applicant’s status as an abortion provider. \n  105. Section 40:1299.32 provides: “No hospital, clinic or other facility or institution of any \nkind shall be held civilly or criminally liable, discriminated against, or in any way prejudiced or \ndamaged because of any refusal to permit or accommodate the performance of any abortion in said \nfacility or under its auspices.” LA. R.S. § 40:1299.32.30 \n  106. The Court was surprised that Defendant’s credentialing expert, Marier, was unaware \nof this provision, but Marier agreed that, by virtue of this provision, “a hospital, if it chooses to, \nmay discriminate against any abortion provider with no consequence under Louisiana law.” (Doc. \n193 at 84.) \n  107. Section 40:1299.33(C) states: “No hospital, clinic, or other medical or health facility, \nwhether public or private, shall ever be denied government assistance or be otherwise discriminated \nagainst or otherwise be pressured in any way for refusing to permit facilities, staff or employees to \nbe used in any way for the purpose of performing any abortion.” LA. R.S. § 40:1299.33(C).31 \n                                                 \n30 The statute was introduced as an exhibit. (PX 183.) Not before the Court is the efficacy of this state statute in the \nface of the Church Amendment, which prohibits a hospital which receives funding under the Public Health Service \nAct, 42 U.S.C. § 201 et seq., from discriminating in employment against those who perform abortions.  42 U.S.C. § \n300a-7. Furthermore, no evidence was introduced as to whether any of the hospitals where credentials were sought in \nthis case, or in Louisiana generally, receive such funds. The text of the Church Amendment was submitted as an \nexhibit. (DX 162.) \n \n31 This subsection was introduced as an exhibit. (PX 182.) \n36 \n \n\n  108. While Doe 2 ultimately received limited privileges at Tulane, the negotiations that led \nto these privileges being granted clearly demonstrate that Doe 2’s status as an abortion provider \nwas a central issue in the decision making process over whether to grant him privileges and the \nlimitations those privileges would have. (See JX 161–81; see infra Part VIII.) \n  109. There are ways in which the hospital staff’s and/or the general public’s hostility to \nabortion and abortion providers can be injected into the credentialing process. For instance, many \napplications for privileges require references from at least two physicians who recently have \nobserved the applying physician as to applicant’s medical skill and “character.” (JX 143 at 3357; \nJX 79 at 1680–81; JX 83 at 1873; JX 143 at 3351.) For example, Minden prefers that an applicant’s \npeer recommendations come from physicians already on staff at that hospital. (JX 72 at 1300.) \nAlthough competent, an abortion provider can face difficulty in getting the required staff references \nbecause of staff opposition to abortion. (See, e.g., Doc. 168-6 at 12; Doc. 190 at 53; JX 109 ¶¶ 28, \n30, 39.) \n  110. Other hospitals’ admitting privileges applications require the applying physician to \nidentify another physician on staff who will “cover” his or her patients if the applying physician is \nunavailable, frequently called a “covering physician.” (JX 78 at 1539; JX 79 at 1677; JX 138 at \n2855; JX 83 at 1866.) As summarized below, the evidence shows that opposition to abortion can \npresent a major, if not insurmountable hurdle, for an applicant getting the required covering \nphysician. \n  111. For example, Doe 5 has applied for admitting privileges at three hospitals in the Baton \nRouge area: Woman’s Hospital in April or May of 2014 and Lane Regional Medical Center and \nBaton Rouge General Medical Center in July of 2014. (Doc. 168-6 at 11.)  Doe 5 has been unable \n37 \n \n\nto find a local physician who is willing to provide coverage for him when he is not in Baton Rouge, \nwhich all three hospitals require. (JX 109 ¶¶ 32–33; JX 110; Doc. 51; Doc. 168-6 at 11–12.)32 Doe \n3 also has had difficulty finding physicians to cover for him due to the animosity towards him as \nan abortion provider. (Doc. 190 at 11–13.) While Doe 2 ultimately got limited privileges at Tulane, \n(JX 183), the evidence therefore demonstrates that staff physicians who oppose abortion present a \nreal obstacle, see infra Part VIII.B.  \n  112.  Some  other  non-competency  based  admitting  privileges  requirements  create  a \nparticular obstacle for abortion providers whose practice is not hospital based, who do not admit \npatients to a hospital as a part of their practice, and who do not perform surgeries at a hospital. \n  113. As one example, hospitals often grant admitting privileges to a physician because the \nphysician plans to provide services in the hospital. (See, e.g., Doc. 195 at 24–25; Doc. 193 at 66.)  \nIn general, hospital admitting privileges are not provided to physicians who never intend to provide \nservices in a hospital. (Docs. 195 at 23–25, 27, 74–75; 193 at 66–67.) \n  114. Thus, in connection with the applications of Does 1 and 2 at Willis-Knighton Medical \nCenter (“WKMC”), Willis-Knighton South (“WKS”), and Willis-Knighton Pierremont Health \nCenter  (“WKP”)  in  Shreveport,  (JX  53,  144),  the  Willis-Knighton  Health  System  (“Willis-\nKnighton”), which runs these three (as well as other) entities, has required these doctors to submit \ndata on hospital admissions, patient management and consultations of patients in the past 12 months \nin a hospital. (Doc. 192 at 75–76; JX 128; JX 89 at 1950.) \n                                                 \n32 This continues to be an obstacle to Doe 5 getting privileges in Baton Rouge. (JX 193.)  While Dr. Doe 2 was \nultimately able to get limited privileges, it appears that this difficulty may have played a role in the limitations \nimposed on his privileges. \n38 \n \n\n  115. Because their abortion practice is not hospital based, neither doctor can possibly \ncomply with that requirement. In the case of Doe 1, since he formally responded to a hospital’s \nrequest for more information regarding his history of admitting patients during the preceding twelve \nmonths, saying he had no such information, he has never again heard from the hospital - there being \nneither a denial nor an approval of his application. (Doc. 192 at 75–78.) Similarly, when Doe 2 \ngave the hospital the only information in his possession, he received formal notice that this was \ninsufficient and “[w]ithout that [additional] information, your application remains incomplete and \ncannot be processed.” (JX 89 at 1950.) Doe 2 could do nothing else, explaining, “I’m in a Catch-\n22 basically. I can’t provide information I don’t have.” (Doc. 191 at 79–80.) \n  116. Even if these Does and similar practitioners somehow got admitting privileges, it is \nunlikely they would be able to keep them. If over a period of two to three years, a physician has not \nadmitted any patients to the hospital, a hospital credentialing committee is likely to understand that \nthis physician no longer requires admitting privileges. (See, e.g., Doc. 195 at 91.) Because, by all \naccounts, abortion complications are rare, (See, e.g., Doc. 168-5 at 14, 16, 20–21; Doc. 193 at 81–\n82; Doc. 195 at 38–39), an abortion provider is unlikely to have a consistent need to admit patients. \n  117. Furthermore, surgical privileges are meant for providers who plan to perform surgeries \nat the hospital. (Doc. 195 at 95–96.) \n  118.  For  the  reasons  outlined  above,  the  Court  finds  that  the  Louisiana  practice  of \ncredentialing, i.e. a hospital’s consideration of and acting (or not acting) upon applications for \nadmitting privileges, creates particular hardships and obstacles for abortion providers. \n  119. The efforts made by Does 1–6 to comply with the admitting privileges requirement of \nAct 620, and the result of those efforts, is reviewed in another section of this Ruling. See infra Part \n39 \n \n\nVIII. In this case, Act 620 requires abortion doctors to get “active admitting privileges,” including \nbeing admitted as a member in good standing of the medical staff, at a nearby hospital. La. Rev. \nStat. § 40:1299.35.2.   \n120. However, the Act does not set the criteria necessary for obtaining those privileges and \nthere is no state law or other uniform standard that sets these criteria.  See infra Parts VI-IX.  Instead, \nthe law relies on the highly variable requirements set in the bylaws of each hospital.  Id.; see also \nWWH, 136 S. Ct. at 2312 (noting that hospitals often have “prerequisites to obtaining admitting \nprivileges that have nothing to do with ability to perform medical procedures”). \n121. The Act therefore anticipates and relies upon existing private hospitals’ varying \nbylaws’ admitting privileges requirements as allowed under Louisiana law. It delegates to private \nhospitals the duty of granting (or withholding) active admitting privileges and thereby utilizes \nbylaws and private hospital credentialing committees as instruments for the implementation of the \nAct. Unquestionably then, the admitting privileges law and practices existing in Louisiana before \nAct 620 are related to Act 620. The inability of Does 1, 2, 4, 5 (in Baton Rouge), and 6 to get the \nkind of active admitting privileges which the Act itself mandates, see supra Part V.D (above), has \nbeen caused by Act 620 working in concert with existing laws and practices, as discussed in detail, \ninfra Part IX. \n122. As discussed here and in Part IX, the Court finds that Louisiana’s credentialing process \nand the criteria found in some hospital bylaws work to preclude or, at least greatly discourage, the \ngranting of privileges to abortion providers, including the following: \n40 \n \n\n-  There are no laws or regulations in Louisiana mandating certain minimum objective \ncredentialing criteria to assure that credentialing decisions are made only on objective, competency-\nrelated factors, akin to the American Medical Association’s guidelines;33 \n- The credentialing processes adopted by the hospitals in question permit them to deny \nprivileges for reasons purely personal and unrelated to the competency of the physician including, \nspecifically, anti-abortion views held by some involved in credentialing; \n- Louisiana law does not prevent hospital or credentialing personnel from discriminating \nagainst  abortion  providers  based  on  their  status  as  abortion  providers,  regardless  of  their \ncompetency; and, \n- By having no maximum time period within which applications must be acted upon, a \nhospital can effectively deny a physician’s application without formally doing so and therefore \naffect a de facto denial without expressing the true reasons (or any reasons) for doing so. \n  - Indeed, the Court finds that, Act 620 was enacted, these specific aspects of how Louisiana \nhospitals  grant,  deny,  or  withhold  hospital  admitting  privileges,  have  played  a  significant \ncontributing role in Louisiana’s abortion providers not being given privileges or being given only \nlimited privileges. \nE.  The Climate \n  123. The evidence is overwhelming that in Louisiana, abortion providers, the clinics where \nthey work and the staff of these clinics, are subjected to violence, threats of violence, harassment \nand danger. \n                                                 \n33 See supra note 23. \n41 \n \n\n  124. Defendant offered no evidence to counter Plaintiffs’ evidence on this point. Rather, \nDefendant makes two arguments: first, some of the Plaintiffs’ evidence on this point is hearsay, and \nsecond, the violence is “legally irrelevant” to the undue burden analysis. (Doc. 201 at 14–15.) The \nissue of legal relevance is addressed in the Conclusions of Law section of this Ruling. See infra \nParts XI–XII. \n  125. Defendant objects to the testimony and exhibits cited in Plaintiffs’ proposed findings \nand conclusions (Doc. 196 ¶¶ 79, 84, 87, 89), as hearsay. However, almost all of this testimony was \nnot objected to by Defendant at the time it was introduced. Moreover, in some instances, this \ntestimony came in by way of exhibits offered jointly by the Parties or in questions asked by counsel \nfor the Defendant.  \n  126. But even if the objected-to evidence were excluded, there is a mountain of un-\ncontradicted and un-objected to evidence supporting this conclusion, some of which is summarized \nbelow.  \n  127. In addition to the harassment and violence, as was discussed briefly in the previous \nsection and will be discussed in more detail in the section reviewing the doctors’ efforts to gain \nadmitting privileges, the personal and/or religious feelings against abortion by the public, some \nmembers of the medical profession and hospital administrators has had a negative effect on the \ndoctors’ efforts to gain admitting privileges. (See, e.g., Docs. 168-6 at 12; 190 at 53; 191 at 24–26; \n192 at 45–46; JX 109 ¶¶ 28, 30, 39.) \n  128.  Indeed,  after  reviewing  Plaintiffs’  motion  to  allow  the  Plaintiff  doctors  to  use \npseudonyms as well as their supporting affidavits, the United States Magistrate Judge concluded: \n“The Court is satisfied that the potential for harassment, intimidation and violence in this case, \n42 \n \n\nparticularly recent instances of such conduct, both nationwide and in Louisiana, justifies the unusual \nand rare remedy of allowing the individual Plaintiffs to proceed anonymously.” (Doc. 24 at 3; see \nalso Docs. 190 at 108; 191 at 12; 192 at 6.) A similar order was signed when Does 3–6 were added \nas parties. (Doc. 55.) \n  129. Also recognizing these legitimate safety concerns, Defendant joined with Plaintiffs in \na Joint Consent Motion Regarding Confidential Trial Procedures, (Doc. 158), granted on June 23, \n2015. (Doc. 161). These procedures included allowing Does 1–3 to testify from behind a screen.34 \n(Doc. 158 at 1.) \n  130. The security concerns even went beyond the Parties, however. A request for anonymity \nwas made on behalf of a hospital which had granted privileges to Doe 5 and the non-party doctors \nwho assisted in the privileges request. No objection was made by any party and the Court ordered \nthis hospital to be called “Hospital C” and the doctor involved for that hospital,” Dr. C.” (Id.) Other \ndoctors involved in granting the limited privileges to Doe 2 were ordered to be called “Dr. A” and \n“Dr. B.” (Id.) \n  131. In order to insure the use of the pseudonyms and protect the identities of Plaintiff \ndoctors as well as certain non-party doctors and hospitals, the Plaintiffs and Defendant filed a joint \nmotion to redact portions of the trial transcript, which the Court granted. (Doc. 180.) By their filings \nin this case, therefore, Defendant and Plaintiffs have implicitly acknowledged the charged emotions \ngenerated by this particular issue within and outside this state.     \n  132. The evidence, in turn, leaves no question about the dangers and hostility regularly \nendured by Plaintiffs.  \n                                                 \n34 The screen was positioned so as to protect the identity of the witness from the public but allowed the Court to see \nand judge the demeanor of the witnesses. \n43 \n \n\n  133. Each of Louisiana’s five clinics experiences frequent demonstrations by anti-abortion \nactivists. (Docs. 190 at 24, 108; 191 at 13; JX 109 ¶¶ 10–12; JX 117 ¶ 6; JX 112 ¶ 2; JX 113 ¶ 2; \nDoc. 168-6 at 25.) These demonstrations require some clinics to have additional security on site. \n(Doc. 190 at 23.) \n  134. Hope Clinic in Shreveport has been the subject of three violent attacks: once by a man \nwielding a sledgehammer, once by an arsonist who threw a Molotov cocktail at the clinic, and once \nby having a hole drilled through the wall and butyric acid poured through it. (Doc. 190 at 23; JX \n116 ¶ 8.) \n  135. In the fall of 2014, following passage of the Act, anti-abortion activists attempted to \ninterfere with Doe 5’s admitting privileges application at Woman’s Hospital in Baton Rouge by \nsending threatening letters to the hospital. (JX 110 ¶ 14; JX 109 ¶ 29.) Woman’s Hospital also had \nto remove anti-abortion activists from its medical staff offices due to the activists’ disruptive \nconduct. (JX 110 ¶ 14.) \n  136. When Doe 5 worked as a hospital employed physician, protests outside the hospital \ncaused the hospital administration to give him an ultimatum: quit performing abortions or resign \nfrom the hospital staff. (JX 110 ¶ 21; see also Doc. 168-6 at 23–24.) In his words, he “was therefore \nforced to stop working at the hospital so that . . . [he] could continue providing services at Women’s \nClinic and Delta Clinic.” (JX 110 ¶ 21; see also JX 109 ¶ 30.) \n  137. After Doe 5 recently acquired privileges at a local hospital (Hospital C), anti-abortion \nactivists began sending threatening letters to that hospital causing him to fear that he might lose the \nprivileges that he acquired. (JX 110 ¶ 20; see also JX 109 ¶ 39.) \n44 \n \n\n  138. Anti-abortion activists picketed the school of the children of a doctor formerly \naffiliated with Delta, after which that doctor quit. (Doc. 168-4 at 23–24.) \n  139. A physician quit working at Causeway after receiving harassing telephone calls at his \nprivate practice and anti-abortion activists demonstrated outside the hospital where he worked. \n(Doc. 168-8 at 8.) \n  140. Doe 1 works at Hope–but he does so in fear of violence. (Doc. 192 at 78–79.) \n  141. Doe 2 has received threatening phone calls, has been followed into restaurants and \naccosted, and has been shouted at with profanity and told that he was going to hell. (Doc. 191 at \n12–13.) \n  142. Doe 2 was forced to leave a private practice when the practice’s malpractice insurer \nrefused to cover him if he continued to perform elective pregnancy terminations. (Id. at 16–17.) \n  143. Doe 3 has been threatened as a result of his work at Hope Clinic. (JX 113 ¶ 3.) Last \nyear, anti-abortion activists from outside Louisiana left fliers on neighbors’ mailboxes calling him \nan abortionist and saying they wanted to convert him to Jesus. (Doc 190 at 108–09.) Local police \nhave had to patrol his neighborhood and search his house before he entered. (JX 113 ¶ 4.) \n  144. These individuals also approached Doe 3’s regular medical practice patients as they \ntried to enter his office, requiring the building security officers to escort the activists off the \npremises. (Id. ¶ 3.)  These individuals told Doe 3’s patients that he killed babies and that they should \nnot see him. (Doc. 190 at 109.) \n  145. Doe 3 fears that, if the other Louisiana abortion providers are not able to obtain \nadmitting privileges, he will become an even greater target for anti-abortion violence. (JX 113 ¶¶ \n6–7.)  He specifically testified that “all [these individuals] have to do is eliminate [him] as they \n45 \n \n\nhave Dr. Tiller and some of the other abortion providers around the country” to eliminate abortion \nentirely in northern Louisiana. (Doc. 190 at 174.) \n  146. Doe 3 also explicitly emphasized that he is concerned that such individuals could \n“cause a lot of other . . . problems that would affect [his] ability to perform the rest of [his] practice.” \n(Id. at 174–75; cf. JX 113 ¶¶ 6–7.) \n  147. Doe 3 has difficulty arranging coverage for his OB/GYN practice because other \nOB/GYN doctors in the Shreveport area refuse to cover his practice as a result of his work at Hope. \n(Doc. 190 at 111–13.) \n  148. As a result of his fears, and the demands of his private OB/GYN practice, Doe 3 has \ntestified that if he is the last physician performing abortion in either the entire state or in the northern \npart of the state, he will not continue to perform abortions. (Id. at 174–76.) \n  149. Anti-abortion activists have picketed the homes – and neighbors’ homes – of Does 5 \nand 6, also distributing threatening flyers. (Doc. 168-6 at 24; JX 109 ¶ 11.) \n  150. Anti-abortion activists have targeted at least one physician who agreed to provide \nemergency care for abortion complications, even though he did not provide abortions himself. (Doc. \n168-6 at 11, 24–25; JX 110 ¶ 20.) \nVI.  Act 620         \nA.  Text of Act 620 and Related Provisions \n  151. The challenged statute is Act 620. LA. R.S. § 40:1299.35.2.  \n  152. Act 620 amended Louisiana Revised Statutes § 40:1299.35.2(a), 1299.35.2.1, and \n2175.3(2) and (5). (Id.) \n46 \n \n\n  153. On June 12, 2014, Governor Bobby Jindal signed Act 620 into law, with an effective \ndate of September 1, 2014. (See, e.g., Doc. 109 at 4.) \n  154. Act 620 provides that every physician who performs or induces an abortion shall “have \nactive admitting privileges at a hospital that is located not further than thirty miles from the location \nat which the abortion is performed or induced and that provides obstetrical or gynecological health \ncare services.” LA. R.S. § 40:1299.35.2A(1).  \n  155. The Act defines “active admitting privileges” to mean that “the physician is a member \nin good standing of the medical staff of a hospital that is currently licensed by the department, with \nthe ability to admit a patient and to provide diagnostic and surgical services to such patient . . . .” \nId. § 40:1299.35.2A(2)(a). \n  156. Regulations connected to the Act and promulgated after the commencement of this \nlitigation by DHH use the same definition of “active admitting privileges.” LA. ADMIN CODE tit. 46, \n§ 4401.35 These regulations note that federal litigation is pending on the issue of admitting \nprivileges and that licensing provisions regarding admitting privileges will only be enforced \npursuant to an order, judgment, stipulation, or agreement issued in this case. Id. § 4423. \n  157. The Act provides that any outpatient abortion facility that knowingly or negligently \nprovides abortions through a physician who does not satisfy the Act is subject to denial, revocation, \nor non-renewal of its license by DHH. La. Rev. Stat. § 40:1299.35.2A(1).  \n  158. The Act provides that a physician who fails to comply with the admitting privileges \nrequirement can be fined $4,000 per violation. Id. § 40:1299.35.2A(2)(c).  \n                                                 \n35 A copy of this regulation was submitted as a joint exhibit. (JX 137.) \n47 \n \n\n  159.  In addition, discipline by the Board is made an enforcement provision in Act 620.  Id. \n§ 40:1299.35.2.1E. The Board has the authority to take disciplinary action against any physician. \nId. § 37:1261 et seq. The Board has the authority to investigate physicians for violations of law, \nsuch as Act 620. Id. § 40:1299.35.2E. By violating this law, physicians could be subjected to fines \nor other sanctions, including the suspension or revocation of the physician’s license to practice \nmedicine. (Doc. 168-10 at 12, 14–15; see also Doc. 31 at 4 n.4.)  \nB.  Louisiana’s Policy and Other Legislation Regarding Abortion \n  160. The Louisiana legislature has codified a statement of opposition to legalized abortion, \nstating:  \nIt is the intention of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana to regulate abortion to \nthe extent permitted by the decisions of the United States Supreme Court. The \nLegislature does solemnly declare and find in reaffirmation of the longstanding \npolicy of this State that the unborn child is a human being from the time of \nconception and is, therefore, a legal person for purposes of the unborn child’s right \nto life and is entitled to the right to life from conception under the laws and \nConstitution  of  this  State.  Further  the  Legislature  finds  and  declares  that  the \nlongstanding policy of this State is to protect the right to life of the unborn child \nfrom conception by prohibiting abortion impermissible only because of the decisions \nof the United States Supreme Court and that, therefore, if those decisions of the \nUnited States Supreme Court are ever reversed or modified or the United States \nConstitution is amended to allow protection of the unborn then the former policy of \nthis State to prohibit abortions shall be enforced. \n \nLa. Rev. Stat. § 40:1299.35.0; see also State v. Aguillard, 567 So. 2d 674, 676 (La. Ct. App. 1990) \n(observing  that  “the  Louisiana  legislature  has  expressed  its  disfavor  for  abortion”  with  this \nprovision). \n  161. Consistent with this explicit statement of legislative intent, as shown below, Louisiana \nhas enacted other laws that place restrictions on women seeking abortion in the state, and doctors \nand clinics who perform abortions. \n48 \n \n\n  162. In 2006, the Louisiana legislature passed a “trigger” ban – banning abortion with only \na limited exception to save a woman’s life – to take immediate effect should Roe v. Wade be \noverturned or a constitutional amendment be adopted to allow states to ban abortion. S.B. 33, 2006 \nLeg., Reg. Sess. (La. 2006) (codified as La. Rev. Stat. §§  40:1299.30, 14.87). The trigger ban \ncarries a criminal penalty of up to 10 years’ imprisonment “at hard labor” for a physician performing \nan abortion. La. Rev. Stat. §§ 40:1299.30D, 14:87D(1). \n  163. Another law mandates that every woman undergo an ultrasound before an abortion, \neven when not medically necessary, and that she be required to listen to an oral description of the \nultrasound image. Id. §§ 40:1299.35.2B–D, 40:1299.35.6, 40:1299.35.12. \n  164. Louisiana requires a two-trip, 24-hour waiting period for women, and further mandates \nthat a physician – and not another medical professional – give certain state-mandated information \ndesigned to discourage abortion to his patient; violation of this provision carries criminal penalties. \nId. §§ 40:1299.35.2D(2), 40:1299.35.6, 40:1299.35.19. \n  165. The Louisiana legislature prohibits public funding of abortion for victims of rape or \nincest unless the victim reports the act to law enforcement and certifies a statement of rape or incest \nthat is witnessed by the physician. Id. §§ 40.1299.34.5, 40:1299.35.7. \n  166. Physicians who provide for the “elective termination of an uncomplicated viable \npregnancy” are expressly excluded from malpractice reform provisions afforded to all other health \ncare practitioners under the state’s medical malpractice protection laws. Id. §§ 40.1299.31–39A, \n40:1299.41(K). \n  167. The legislature has passed laws prohibiting insurance coverage of abortion in state \nexchanges under the Affordable Care Act. Id. § 22:1014. Louisiana does not allow women to obtain \n49 \n \n\ninsurance coverage for abortion even when a woman’s life is endangered or when the pregnancy is \na result of rape or incest. Id. \n  168. The Louisiana legislature permits hospitals to refuse to accommodate the performance \nof abortions. Id. § 40:1299.31–33.  \n  169. Louisiana has no law which prohibits a hospital from discriminating against a physician \napplying for privileges there based on that physician’s status as an abortion provider. Compare TEX. \nOCC. CODE § 103.002(b). \n  170.  The  effect  of  Act  620  is  thus  significantly  different  from  admitting  privileges \nrequirements in states where physicians are protected from discrimination. See, e.g., Cole, 790 F.3d \nat 563; see also Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 598 n.13.   \n171. Before the enactment of Act 620, Louisiana already had in force numerous laws and \nregulations covering abortion facilities, including requirements that facilities be inspected at least \nannually, see, e.g., La. Rev. Stat. 40:1061 et seq. (re-designated from La. Rev. Stat. 40:1299 et \nseq.); La. Rev. Stat. 40:2175.1 et seq., and that they retain a readily accessible written protocol for \nmanaging medical emergencies and the transfer of patients requiring further emergency care to a \nhospital (i.e. a transfer agreement).36 See also generally La. Admin. Code tit. 48, pt. I, §§ 4405, \n4407(A). \n \n \n                                                 \n36 Louisiana regulations had previously provided: “[A licensed abortion] facility shall ensure that when a patient is in \nthe facility for an abortion, there is one physician present who has admitting privileges or has a written transfer \nagreement with a physician(s) who has admitting privileges at a local hospital within the same town or city to facilitate \nemergency care”).  Former La. Admin. Code tit. 48, pt. I, § 4407(A)(3), available at 29 La. Reg. 706-07 (May 20, \n2003).  Shortly before trial, Defendant Kliebert repealed the prior regulation, and replaced it with an admitting \nprivileges requirement identical to the Act. La. Admin. Code, tit. 48, pt I., § 4423(B)(3)(e), available at 41 \nLa. Reg. 696 (Apr. 20. 2015) \n50 \n \n\nC.  Drafting of Act 620 \n  172. Act 620 was modeled after similar laws which have had the result of closing abortion \nclinics in other states. On May 5, 2014, Ms. Dorinda Bordlee (“Bordlee”), the Vice President and \nExecutive Counsel of the Bio Ethics Defense Fund, an anti-abortion advocacy group, sent the \ndraft’s primary legislative sponsor, Representative Katrina Jackson (“Jackson”), an email regarding \na similar statute passed in Texas that had “tremendous success in closing abortion clinics and \nrestricting abortion access in Texas.”  (Docs. 191 at 200; 196-5 at 2; 196-10 at 1.) Bordlee told \nJackson that “[Act 620] follows this model.” (Docs. 191 at 200; 196-5 at 2; 196-10 at 1.) \n  173. Evidence received demonstrates the coordination among advocacy groups, Jackson, \nand DHH employees regarding efforts to restrict abortion. (See, e.g., Doc. 191 at 199–202, 211–13, \n215–16, 220–21; JX 3, 6–16.)    \n  174. In a press release regarding Act 620 released on March 7, 2014, Jindal declared his \nposition that Act 620 was a reform that would “build upon the work . . . done to make Louisiana \nthe most pro-life state in the nation.” (PX 174 at 1; Doc. 191 at 224–27.) Jindal stated:  \nPromoting a culture of life in Louisiana has been an important priority of mine since \ntaking office, and I am proud to support [Act 620] this legislative session. In this \nstate, we uphold a culture of life that values human beings as unique creatures who \nwere made by our Creator. [Act 620] will build upon all we have done the past six \nyears to protect the unborn. \n \n(PX 174 at 1.) \n  175. Indirectly referencing the legislation just summarized, Jackson is quoted in this press \nrelease as saying that Act 620 “will build on our past work to protect life in our state.” (Id. at 2.) \n51 \n \n\n  176. Similarly, in her testimony before the Louisiana House Committee in support of Act \n620, Kliebert testified that Act 620 would strengthen DHH’s ability to protect “unborn children.” \n(Doc. 191; JX 140 at 1.) \n  177. The talking points prepared for Secretary Kliebert by Representative Jackson’s office \nstated that DHH was “firmly committed to working with Representative Jackson and the Legislature \nto continue to work to protect the safety and well-being of Louisiana [women] and the most \nvulnerable among us, unborn children.” (Doc. 191 at 222–23; see also JX 24 at 2–4.)      \nD.  Official Legislative History of Act 62037 \n  178. Act 620 (at the time known as HB 388) was considered by the House Health and \nWelfare Committee on March 9, 2014, and the Senate Health and Welfare Committee on May 7, \n2014. The House and Senate Committees heard extensive testimony regarding the purposes of \nproposed statute. (DX 119 at 1–30, 39–67.) \n  179. More specifically, the House and Senate Committees heard testimony that the proposed \nstatute was intended to safeguard the health and safety of women undergoing abortions in outpatient \nclinics in Louisiana. (Id.) \n  180. For example, the House and Senate Committees heard testimony that: \n  -  Abortion carries the risk of serious complications that could require immediate \nhospitalization. (Id. at 3, 5.) \n                                                 \n37 The official legislative history, submitted as one document, (DX 119), contains the reports of the House and Senate \nas well as a transcript of various senators’ comments, each of which commence with their own page number. Thus, for \nthe sake of easy location, this Court cites to the page number of the pdf document itself. Within Document Number \n119, the House report appears on pages 2 through 30, the Senate report on pages 33 through 67, and the transcript of \nthe Senate floor debate on pages 69 through 73. \n52 \n \n\n  -  Women who experience abortion complications frequently rely on the care of \nemergency room physicians, who often must call on the assistance of a specialist in \nobstetrics or gynecology. (See id. at 4, 5, 8.) \n  -  “[M]ost emergency departments lack adequate on-call coverage for medical and \nsurgical specialists, including obstetricians and gynecologists.” (Id. at 48.) \n  -  The history of health and safety violations by Louisiana abortion clinics raises \nconcerns about the potential for serious abortion-related complications. (Id. at 10.) \n  -  Requiring outpatient abortion providers to have admitting privileges benefits the \nsafety of women seeking abortion and also enhances regulation of the medical \nprofession. (Id. at 3, 48.) \n  -  For  instance,  the  admitting  privileges  requirement  improves  the  “credentialing \nprocess” for physicians by “provid[ing] a more thorough evaluation mechanism of \nphysician competency than would occur otherwise.” (Id. at 48.) \n  -  The requirement also “acknowledges and enables the importance of continuity of \ncare” for an abortion patient. (Id.) \n  -  Additionally,  the  requirement  “enhances  inter-physician  communication  and \noptimizes patient information transfer and complication management.” (Id.) \n  -  Finally, the requirement “supports the ethical duty of care of the operating physician \nto prevent patient abandonment.” (Id. at 3, 48.) \n  -  A virtually identical admitting privileges requirement in Texas had recently been \nupheld by the U.S. Fifth Circuit as a reasonable measure for achieving these health \nand safety goals. (Id. at 48.) \n53 \n \n\n  -  There was no obstacle preventing abortion providers from obtaining admitting \nprivileges at Louisiana hospitals. (Id. at 9 (testimony that one Louisiana abortion \nprovider already had admitting privileges).) \n  -  Louisiana hospitals grant or deny admitting privileges “based entirely on [the  \n    applicant’s] medical training and experience.” (Id. at 50.) \n  -  Louisiana  hospitals  have  recognized  categories  of  staff  membership  to \naccommodate physicians who are expected to admit low numbers of patients for a \nvariety of reasons. (Id. at 50.) \n  181. Additionally, the House and Senate Committees also heard testimony that, unlike \nphysicians performing surgical procedures in ambulatory surgical centers in Louisiana, physicians \nperforming abortions in outpatient clinics had not previously been required to have any kind of \nhospital privileges. The committees heard testimony explaining that the proposed statute was \ndesigned to close that loophole and thus achieve greater consistency in the overall regulation of \noutpatient surgical procedures in Louisiana. (See id. at 2–4 (House committee testimony regarding \ngoal of achieving greater consistency with ASC regulations), 41–43 (Senate committee testimony \nregarding same subject).) \n  182. For example, the House and Senate Committees heard testimony that: \n  -  The Act was intended to bring outpatient abortion facilities in line with “the standard \nthat is currently in place for [ASCs] as set forth in Louisiana Administrative Code, \nChapter 45 … Section 4535.” (Id. at 4.) \n54 \n \n\n  -  The  Act  intended  to  “close  a  loophole”  in  Louisiana  regulation  by  requiring \noutpatient abortion providers to have privileges comparable to those required for \nphysicians performing outpatient surgery in ASCs. (Id. at 41–42.) \n  -  The Act’s requirement of admitting privileges is consistent with requiring surgical \nprivileges for ASC physicians. (Id. at 49 (explaining that “the effect is the same both \nin terms of … the credentialing process itself and in the application of the standards \nby the state”).) \n  -  In both cases, the privileges requirement is based on the “well-established principle \n… that a provider should not undertake a procedure unless he is qualified and able \nto take care of whatever complications there might be.” (Id. at 49.) \n  183. The full House and Senate heard statements in support of HB 388 explaining that it \nwas intended to protect “the safety of women” and ensure that “every physician performing any \nsurgery, including abortions, does so in a prudent manner and with the best interest of each woman’s \nhealth in mind,” (Id. at 34–35), and also that it was intended to safeguard “the lives and safety of \npregnant  women  who  may  experience  short-term  risk[s]  of  abortion,  which  can  include \nhemorrhaging, uterine perforation, or infection,” (Id. at 48). \n  184. The full House was informed that the proposed law tracked the Texas admitting-\nprivileges law, HB 2, which had been upheld as constitutional by the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of \nAppeals a week earlier. (Id. at 34–35 (referring to Abbott II).)  \n  185. The Senate approved one amendment to the proposed statute, concerning the definition \nof admitting privileges, and rejected another amendment that would have eliminated the 30-mile \nradius requirement. (Id. at 69–70.)  \n55 \n \n\n  186. The proposed statute passed both chambers, with 85 House members and 34 Senators \nvoting in favor, and 88 House members concurring in the Senate amendment. See \nhttps://www.legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=887948 (House final passage); \nhttps://www.legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=903997 (Senate final passage); \nhttps://www.legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=903981 (Senate amendment); \nhttps://www.legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=906861 (House concurrence) (all \nlegislative websites last visited Aug. 24, 2015). \nVII.   The Purpose and Medical Need for and Reasonableness of Act 620 \n  187. The evidence introduced to show the purpose of Act 620 came in several forms. The \nPlaintiffs offered: (1) press releases, public statement, emails, and similar evidence produced by \npublic officials, lobbyists, advocacy groups and others involved or interested in the drafting and \npassage of Act 620; (2) the testimony of some of those involved in these communications; (3) \nLouisiana’s legislatively stated “longstanding policy . . . to protect the right to life of the unborn \nchild from conception by prohibiting abortion impermissible only because of the decisions of the \nUnited States Supreme Court . . . .,” La. R.S. § 40:1299.35.0; and (4) expert testimony  purporting \nto show two things: first, there is no medical need for Act 620 because legal abortion is safe, and \nsecond, that Act 620 is medically unreasonable in that Act 620 does not advance the health and \nsafety of women undergoing abortions.        \n  188. In support of her position, Defendant offered: (1) the text and legislative history of the \nAct, including testimony considered during the legislature’s deliberations, and (2) expert testimony \nat trial purporting to show that the admitting privileges requirement is needed because of potential \n56 \n \n\ncomplications from abortions and that the Act is medically necessary and beneficial for the health \nand safety of a woman undergoing an abortion. \n  189. In its original Ruling (Doc. 216, at 51-53), the Court made the findings of fact which \nfollow. However, the Court did not detail its weighing of the evidence on these points because, \nunder the then existing Fifth Circuit test, these conclusions were legally irrelevant. (See Doc. 216, \nfootnotes 39-43.) Given the standard the Court must now apply, these findings of fact are relevant \nand the Court will follow its summary of findings with a review of how it reached them.  \n  (A)   A purpose of the bill is to improve the health and safety of women undergoing an \nabortion. \n  (B)  Another purpose of the bill is to make it more difficult for abortion providers to \nlegally provide abortions and therefore restrict a woman’s right to an abortion. \n  (C)  There is a dispute medically and scientifically as to whether Act 620 serves a \nlegitimate medical need and is medically reasonable. \n  (D)  Legal abortions in Louisiana are very safe procedures with very few complications. \n  (E)  The vast majority of women who undergo abortions in Louisiana are poor. (See, e.g., \nJX 124 at 2480; Docs. 191 at 190–91; 190 at 34.) As a result of that poverty, the \nburden of traveling farther to obtain an abortion would be significant, fall harder on \nthese women than those who are not poor and cause a large number of these women \nto either not get an abortion, perform the abortions themselves, or have someone \nwho is not properly trained and licensed perform it.  (See, e.g., JX 124 at 2480; Docs. \n191 at 190–91; 190 at 34.)             \n57 \n \n\n  (F)  The  medical  benefits  which  would  flow  from  Act  620  are  minimal  and  are \noutweighed by the burdens which would flow from this legislation. \n  190. The relevance and weight of these factual findings in the context of the prevailing \nSupreme Court test is discussed in more detail in this Ruling’s final substantive sections. See infra \nParts X–XI.  What follows is the Court’s review of the evidence on these points including the \nweighing of the testimony and credibility of the witnesses which supports its findings. \nA. Expert Testimony \n191. Evidence concerning the safety of abortion was adduced largely through expert \ntestimony, which was borne out by the experience of Louisiana abortion providers who testified. \nThe Court turns now to a discussion of its credibility findings concerning the parties’ experts; the \nfactual findings that stem from the experts’ opinions follow. \n192. The Court was impressed with the credibility and expertise of Plaintiffs’ experts.38  Dr. \nEva Pressman is the Chair of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of \nRochester Medical Center, where she is in charge of a department of 50 faculty members.  (Doc. \n195 at 11:13-12:16.)  Subsequent to her residency, and before coming to the University of \nRochester, Dr. Pressman served as a professor and Director of Fetal Assessment at Johns Hopkins. \n(Id. at 13:13-14:10; PX 94, 131 ¶¶ 3-4.)  At Johns Hopkins, Dr. Pressman had a surgical abortion \npractice, up to 24 weeks gestation.  (Doc. 195 at 13:6-12.)  Dr. Pressman has published in excess \nof 70 research articles in peer-reviewed medical journals and received more than 20 research grants,  \nincluding from the National Institutes of Health.  (Id. at 14:11-15:5; see generally PX 94.)  The \n                                                 \n38 See Doc. 216, footnote 42. \n58 \n \n\nCourt accepted Dr. Pressman as an expert in hospital credentialing, obstetrics, and abortion care.  \n(Id. at 17:16-20:25.) \n193. Dr. Christopher Estes is an OB/GYN with a master’s degree in public health from \nColumbia University.  (Doc. 190 at 186:8-189:10.)  For seven years, he was a professor on the \nfaculty of the University of Miami’s Miller School of Medicine and an OB/GYN surgeon who \nperformed, among other procedures, first and second trimester abortions, with a specialty in high- \nrisk patients.  (Id. at 189:16-191:8.)  Dr. Estes is presently the Medical Director of Planned \nParenthood of South, East, and North Florida, where he provides the full spectrum of family \nplanning services and surgery. (Id. at 186:10-23, 192:8-193:12; see generally PX 92.) The Court \naccepted Dr. Estes as an expert in public health, obstetrics, and abortion care.   (Doc. 190 at 194:7-\n196:23.) \n194. Plaintiffs’ expert medical witnesses are both experienced women’s health practitioners, \nwith extensive experience, research, and knowledge of peer-reviewed medical literature related to \nabortion.  Both testified candidly on direct and cross-examination.  (Id. at 197:1-268:6; Doc. 195 at \n11:12-96:12.)  While these physicians had personal opinions about abortion, the Court did not find \ntheir expert opinions skewed by those opinions, which were well-supported by reliable facts and \ndata, and are fully credited by the Court as truthful and reliable. \n195. Defendant presented expert testimony from Dr. Damon Cudihy and Dr. Robert Marier. \nThe Court had serious concerns about the credibility and reliability of Dr. Cudihy’s testimony.39 \nHis testimony and opinions were shown to be contradicted by his own prior inconsistent statements \nand the sources on which he purported to rely. (E.g. Doc. 194 at 73:18-88:16 (opining that D&C, a \n                                                 \n39 See Doc. 216 footnote 39 (“[T]he Court had serious concerns about the credibility and bias of defense expert Dr. \nDamon Cudihy…”) \n59 \n \n\nmiscarriage treatment comparable to early surgical abortion, should always be performed in a \nhospital, but relying on sources stating “a D&C can be done in a healthcare provider’s office, a \nsurgery center, or a hospital” and “for uncomplicated cases curettage in an operating room adds to \nthe costs and inconvenience yet offers no medical benefit over outpatient curettage”)).  He was \nevasive on the stand. (E.g., id. at 133:18-134:8, 134:16-135:12, 141:2-142:3, 161:20-162:9, 173:6-\n176:5.).  His testimony also demonstrated a bias against legal abortion, which he described as \n“appalling, horrifying, tragic, and unnecessary,” and which he testified should be criminalized. (Id. \nat 205:12-206:3.). \n196. Further, Dr. Cudihy lacks relevant experience regarding the matters on which he \noffered opinions. He testified that he has never performed an abortion, nor has he studied the \nprovision of abortion.  (Doc. 194 at 21:16-21.)  He has not treated a single abortion complication \nin the two years he has practiced medicine in Louisiana. (Id. at 73:25-74:8.) He conceded that \nseveral of his opinions about abortion relied on no sources at all, (e.g., id. at 100:15-106:10; 111:25-\n112:12), and that others were based on conversations with a non-testifying defense expert, Dr. John \nThorp, (id. at 140:1-18), whose testimony has been discredited in other suits regarding abortion \nrestrictions, e.g. Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, Inc. v. Van Hollen, 94 F. Supp. 3d 949, 968-69 \n(W.D. Wis. 2015), aff’d, 806 F.3d 908 (7th Cir. 2015), cert denied, 136 S. Ct. 2545 (2016); Planned \nParenthood Se., Inc. v. Strange, 33 F. Supp. 3d 1381, 1394 (M.D. Ala. 2014). \n197. The Court accordingly gives Dr. Cudihy’s testimony minimal weight.  However, even \nif fully credited, Dr. Cudihy’s testimony would not change the Court’s findings of fact as the Court \nfound the expert testimony of the Plaintiffs’ experts to be reasoned and supported. \n60 \n \n\n198. Dr. Marier was accepted by the Court as an expert in internal medicine, the regulation \nof physicians and other health care professionals in Louisiana, and hospital administration. (Doc. \n193 at 9:24-10:23.)  He was Chairman of the Department of Hospital Medicine at Ochsner Medical  \nCenter and previously served as the Executive Director of the Louisiana State Board of Medical \nExaminers. (Id. at 4:16-9:21.) \n199. Dr.  Marier’s  testimony  regarding  hospital  privileging  was  well  within  his  area  \nof  experience and expertise, and the Court gives considerable weight to that testimony. \n200. However, Dr. Marier’s testimony regarding the purported benefits of Act 620 to \nabortion patients suffered from his paucity of knowledge or experience concerning medical or \nsurgical abortion procedures.40  Dr. Marier has never performed an abortion and has not had any \nexperience with obstetric or gynecological surgeries since medical school.  (Id. at 51:14-25.) \n201. Dr. Marier’s testimony was also diminished by his bias, manifested in his testimony \nthat abortion, and even contraception methods such as emergency contraception and intrauterine \ndevices, should be outlawed in the United States.  (Id. at 106:10-107:19, 27:9-18, 89:2-14, 94:1- \n19, 94:20-97:10, 99:12-100:16.) \n202. The Court accordingly gives Dr. Marier’s testimony regarding the purported benefits \nfor Act 620 minimal weight.  However, even if fully credited, this portion of Dr. Marier’s testimony \nwould not change the Court’s findings of fact. \nB. Abortion Safety \n203. The Court makes the following findings regarding abortion safety based on expert and \nlay testimony, supported by the exhibits received in evidence. \n                                                 \n40 See Doc. 216 footnote 39 ([T]he Court had serious concerns about…Marier’s expertise as it pertained to the subject \nof abortion practice….”). \n61 \n \n\n204. Abortion is a common medical procedure in the United States, with nearly one million \nprocedures performed each year.  (Doc. 190 at 197:1-6, 232:7-13; JX 123 ¶ 24.) Approximately \none in three women in the United States will have an abortion during their lifetimes. (Doc. 190 at \n197:1-6; JX 123 ¶ 24.) \n205. Abortion is one of the safest medical procedures in the United States.  (Doc. 190 at \n199:6-24; Doc. 195 at 32:7-10; JX 123 ¶ 24.)  Dr. Marier acknowledged “that most first-trimester \nabortions are performed without serious complications.” (JX 135 at 2804.) There is far more risk \nassociated with carrying a pregnancy to term and delivering a baby than with abortion.  (Doc. 190 \nat 129:22-130:5, 199:6-10; JX 123 ¶ 61; Doc. 195 at 32:4-10.) \n206. Approximately 90% of abortion procedures occur in the first trimester, almost all of \nwhich are performed in an outpatient setting.  (Doc. 190 at 197:7-15; JX 123 ¶ 13; Doc. 195 at \n33:16—19.) \n207. There are two types of abortion procedures, surgical abortion and medication abortion. \n(JX 123 ¶ 15.) Surgical abortion is a minimally invasive procedure that involves the use of \ninstruments to evacuate the contents of the uterus, but does not require an incision or the use of \ngeneral anesthesia.  (Doc. 190 at 138:24-139:17; Doc. 195 at 32:11-20, 48:20-49:3; JX 123 ¶ 16.) \n208.  First  trimester  surgical  abortions  are  nearly  identical  to  D&Cs  to  complete  a \nspontaneous miscarriage or for other diagnostic or therapeutic reasons.  (JX 123 ¶ 19; Doc. 168-6 \nat 6.) Physicians are not required to have admitting privileges in order to perform D&Cs to complete \na spontaneous miscarriage or for other diagnostic or therapeutic reasons in Louisiana.  (Doc. 194 at \n116:10-15.) \n62 \n \n\n209. Virtually all surgical abortions require only mild or moderate sedation and/or local \nanesthesia.  (Doc. 190 at 138:24-139:17.)  Mild or moderate sedation and local anesthesia are much \nsafer than the general anesthesia used in an operating room setting.  (Doc. 190 at 197:24- \n198:12; Doc. 195 at 33:24-35:19; JX 123 ¶ 18; PX 185 ¶ 793.) \n   210. Complications from surgical abortion are rare and include infection, hemorrhage, \nretained tissue, incomplete abortion, and perforation of the uterus.  (Doc. 190 at 36:21-37:25, \n198:13- \n199:5.) \n211. Most complications of surgical abortions can be managed in the clinic, including by \nadministering medications that reduce bleeding or cause the uterus to contract, massaging the \nuterus, applying pressure, suturing, or administering oral antibiotics to treat infection.  Surgical \nintervention is not commonly required.  (Docs. 190 at 25:3-6, 89:15-90:1, 135:10-137:9, 201:15-\n207:22; 195 at 38:22-39:4.) Serious complications requiring transfer directly from the clinic to a \nhospital are extremely rare.  (Doc. 190 at 39:25-40:5, 246:6-9.) \n212.  Medication  abortion  involves  the  use  of  a  combination  of  two  drugs,  usually \nmifepristone and misoprostol.  (Doc. 190 at 130:9-131:2; JX 123 ¶ 22.)  Plaintiff clinics offer \nmedication abortion up to eight weeks LMP.  See supra Part V.B.  A woman typically takes \nmifepristone at the clinic and   then takes   misoprostol   at   home.    (Doc.   190   at   131:20-132:7,   \n208:23-209:15.)    Medication  abortion  requires  no  anesthesia  or  sedation.    (JX  123  ¶  23.)   \nMedication abortion is also used as a treatment option in connection with spontaneous abortion, \nalso known as miscarriage.  (Doc. 190 at 210:23-211:12.) \n63 \n \n\n213. The most common complication from medication abortion is incomplete abortion or \nretained tissue, which is typically remedied by a return visit to the clinic for a suction curettage \nprocedure.  (Docs. 190 at 132:9-22, 209:16-210:16; 195 at 43:19-44:4.) \n214. The prevalence of any complication in first trimester abortion in the outpatient setting \nis approximately 0.8%.  The prevalence of major complications requiring treatment in a hospital is \n0.05%.  The risks of abortion remain low through the second trimester, but the risks increase with \ngestational age.  The risk of complication requiring hospitalization in the second trimester is \napproximately 1.0%.  (Docs. 190 at 198:13-199:5, 199:11-24, 199:25-200: 9; JX 123 ¶ 25; 195 at \n42:2-44:18, 75:14-76:5, 95:3-18; PX 195 at 499.) \n215. By comparison, a D&C procedure performed after a miscarriage carries greater risk \nthan a first trimester surgical abortion because, during a miscarriage, the cervix is already open, \nallowing the passage of bacteria into the uterine cavity, which increases the risk of infection.  (Doc. \n195 at 31:20-32:3, 35:21-36:2.) \n216. Patients who visit the emergency room after an abortion often are experiencing normal \nside effects of the procedure and can be observed and released, or treated and released without \nadmission.  (Doc. 190 at 212:1-17; Doc. 195 at 37:20-39:4.) \n217. It is more common for women to present at the emergency room with symptoms of \nmiscarriage than with complications following an induced abortion.   (Doc. 190 at 212:18-25.)  \nEmergency room doctors are equipped to treat a patient who is experiencing complications from \neither.  (Doc. 190 at 213:1-6, 213:18-22; Doc. 195 at 59:5-7.)  When a complication from abortion \nrequires surgical intervention in the hospital setting, emergency physicians stabilize the patient and \n64 \n \n\nfacilitate treatment by the appropriate specialist.  This is the standard of care.  (Docs. 190 at 213:7-\n17, 249:8-250:21; 195 at 39:5-40:3, 55:14-56:12, 57:25-58:3; 193 at 52:21-53:1.)    \n218. In Louisiana, it is not required by law nor is it standard practice for a physician to have \nadmitting privileges in order to transfer a patient to another medical facility for emergency care: \nDoe 1, who previously worked as a rural emergency physician, routinely transferred patients with \nsevere emergencies to other hospitals without admitting privileges. (Doc. 192 at 18:13-19:15.)  \n219. In the last 23 years, Hope Clinic, which serves in excess of 3,000 patients per year, had \nonly four patients who required transfer to a hospital for treatment.  (Doc. 190 at 25:14-18, 127:8-\n11.)  In each instance, regardless of whether the physician had admitting privileges, the patient \nreceived appropriate care.  (Id.  at  127:11-23,  128:5-14,  128:15-129:8,  172:13-173:5,  129:9-21.) \nAt Hope Clinic, if a physician determines that a patient needs to be transported to the hospital, he \ndirects an employee to call for emergency transport. The administrator ensures that the chart is \ncomplete so that a copy can be sent to the hospital.  The physician also contacts the hospital to alert \nthe attending physician that the patient will be arriving and to provide information about the \ncomplication.  (Id. at 25:19-26:14.) \n220. From 2009 through mid-2014, approximately 4,171 abortions were performed at \nBossier Clinic, and only two patients required direct hospital transfer following an abortion.  (JX \n117 ¶ 9.) \n221. In the same period, approximately 10,836 abortions were performed at Causeway \nClinic, and only one patient required direct hospital transfer after an abortion.  (JX 117 ¶ 9.) \n222. Dr. Doe 2, who has performed 30,000 to 40,000 abortions since 1980, has had no more \nthan twenty patients who required hospitalization.  (Doc. 191 at 46:12-21.) \n65 \n \n\n223. From 2009 through mid-2014, Dr. Doe 2 directly cared for approximately 6,000 \npatients who received abortions.  Only two of these patients experienced complications requiring \ndirect hospital transfer. (JX 187 ¶ 6.) In both of those situations, he spoke with the hospital doctor \nwho took over care when the patient was admitted to the hospital.  Both of these patients received \nappropriate care.  (Doc. 191 at 43:14-45:10, 45:11-46:11.) He has never sent a patient to another \ninstitution without calling the doctor taking over care for the patient and sending all available \nwritten patient medical records to that doctor.  (Id. at 42:20-43:13.) \n224. Dr. Doe 5 has performed thousands of abortions at Women’s Clinic and Delta Clinic \nin the past three years and has never had to transfer a patient to the hospital.  (JX 110 ¶ 7.) \n225. Dr. Doe 6 has performed thousands of surgical and medical abortions over more than \nthe past ten years and only two of those patients required a direct transfer to the hospital. (JX 168 \n¶ 8.) \n226. In sum, the testimony of clinic staff and physicians demonstrated just how rarely it is \nnecessary to transfer patients to a hospital: far less than once a year, or less than one per several \nthousand patients. As stated by the Supreme Court in its affirmation of the District Court’s findings \nin WWH and certainly true in Louisiana: “[T]here was no significant health-related problem that \nthe new law helped to cure.” 136 S. Ct. at 2311. \n227. Louisiana physicians, even were they able to obtain admitting privileges, would rarely \nif ever have an occasion to use them, and would never need to, given that they are not required to \nadmit patients to a hospital in the extremely unlikely event that a patient needs hospital transfer. \n228. When women do not have access to safe abortion, because abortion is expensive or \ndifficult to obtain, they may be forced to delay and seek an abortion at a later gestational age, which \n66 \n \n\nincreases the risks of the procedure.   (Doc. 190 at 200:20-201:6, 223:19-224:8; JX 123 ¶ 60.)  \nWomen  may  also  resort  to  trying  to  self-induce  abortions,  seek  unsafe  abortions,  or  obtain \nmedications through the internet, which can carry significant risk of death, complications, or poor \nhealth outcomes.  Women without financial resources are at the greatest risk of these consequences.  \n(Doc. 190 at 224:9-225:3; JX 123 ¶¶ 60, 62.) \nC.  Requiring  Abortion  Practitioners  to  Obtain  Admitting  Privileges  Confers  No \nMedical Benefit \n229. The Act’s requirement that abortion providers have active admitting privileges at a \nhospital within 30 miles does not conform to prevailing medical standards and will not improve the \nsafety of abortion in Louisiana.  (Doc. 190 at 214:3-13, 225:4-6.)  It provides no benefits to women \nand is an inapt remedy for a problem that does not exist. (Id. at 222:13-16; Doc. 195 at 26:5-16, \n28:13—20; Doc. 168-10 at 23-24.) \n   230. Defendant did not introduce any evidence showing that patients have better outcomes \nwhen their physicians have admitting privileges. Nor did Defendant proffer evidence of any \ninstance in which an admitting privileges requirement would have helped even one woman obtain \nbetter treatment. \n231. Admitting privileges requirements such as the Act’s are opposed by the medical \ncommunity.  Specifically, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (“ACOG”) and \nthe  American  Medical  Association  (“AMA”)  are  opposed  to  these  admitting  privileges \nrequirements.  (PX 142; JX 136; Doc. 190 at 215:4-15); see also WWH, 136 S. Ct. at 2312-13. Both \nACOG and the AMA have taken the position that “there is simply no medical basis to impose a \nlocal admitting privileges requirement on abortion providers,” and that such requirements are “out \n67 \n \n\nof step with modern medical practice, which contemplates provision of emergency care by specially \ntrained hospital physicians at a hospital near the patient’s residence.”  (PX 142 at 16, 22); see also \nWWH, 136 S. Ct. at 2312. \n232. Whether or not a patient’s treating physician has admitting privileges is not relevant to \nthe patient’s care. Patients who present to the emergency room do not receive a lesser standard of \ncare because their treating physician did not have admitting privileges.  (Doc. 190 at 221:1-14.) \n233. If a patient needs to be admitted to the hospital for care, the patient can present to the \nemergency room and will be admitted to the hospital.  A hospital cannot turn away a patient \nexperiencing an emergency because it is unethical and would be a violation of federal law.  (Doc. \n190 at 221:1-8); 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd (2011). \n234. It is routine for emergency room doctors to assess patients, many of whom are \nexperiencing the stress of injury, illness, or trauma. Patients, even when in significant levels of \ndistress, are able to give emergency room doctors pertinent medical history. (Doc. 190 at 260:6-\n261:15, 265:2-20.) \n   235. If a patient needs emergency surgery, the patient will be treated by the specialist on \ncall who is best qualified to perform the type of surgery needed. (Id. at 220:11-25; Doc. 191 at \n15:16-16:2; Doc. 195 at 28:21-29:17.) \n236. Admitting privileges do little to advance and are not necessary for continuity of care.  \nIn the medical community, continuity of care is understood to mean that if a physician is not able \nto continue providing care to a patient, the physician will make certain that another physician has \nthe information needed to care for the patient. (Docs. 190 at 124:23—125:12; 191 at 40:24—41:19.) \nContinuity of care can be accomplished by communicating with the physician to whom the patient’s \n68 \n \n\ncare is being turned over. (Doc. 190 at 124:23—125:3.) For example, physicians within an \nOB/GYN practice routinely care for each other’s patients, including deliveries. (Doc. 190 at 124:15-\n125:12; Doc. 191 at 40:24-41:19.)  And, as Dr. Doe 2 testified, on the rare occasions when he \ntransferred a patient to the hospital, he communicated directly with the physician assuming care \nand provided the patient’s records.  (Doc. 191 at 42:20-43:13.) \n237. Many physicians who practice in office settings are able to ensure continuity of care \nfor their patients without having admitting privileges.  (Doc. 190 at 216:8-21; Doc. 195 at 28:21- \n30:10.) \n238. Indeed, the normal practice of medicine involves physicians handing patients off from \none shift to the next, from an office-based setting to an emergency room, and from an emergency \nroom to an in-patient ward.  (Docs. 190 at 218:1-8; 195 at 79:1-6.)  When physicians rely on other \nphysicians to assist in caring for their patients, it is not considered patient abandonment.  (Doc. \n168-10 at 11.)   A physician’s transfer agreement with another physician, which all abortion clinics \nmust maintain under pre-existing law, is a mechanism to ensure continuity of care.  (Docs. 168-7 \nat 26; 168-9 at 17; 168-10 at 22.) Continuity of care for a patient is often maintained even without \nformal measures like transfer agreements.  (Doc. At 190 241:13-23, 242:19-243:1.) \n   239. Most complications from surgical abortion do not occur immediately at the clinic, \nwhich is why transfer directly to a hospital is so very rare. (See generally Doc. 190 at 90:23-91:15.) \nIf a patient experiences a complication after she leaves the clinic, the clinic will advise her to go to \nthe hospital closest to her, which is not necessarily a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic. (Doc. \n190 at 90:23-91:15, 126:17-127:7; JX 159 at 3491; JX 162 at 3504; JX 165.)  This is the standard \nof care.  (Doc. 190 at 222:1-12.) \n69 \n \n\n240. In conclusion, there is no credible evidence in the record that Act 620 would further \nthe State’s interest in women’s health beyond that which is already insured under existing Louisiana \nlaw.  Indeed, the overwhelming weight of the evidence demonstrates that, in the decades before the \nAct’s passage, abortion in Louisiana has been extremely safe, with particularly low rates of serious \ncomplications, and as compared with childbirth and with medical procedures that are far less \nregulated than abortion.   \n241. Indeed, the Court notes that this Court’s findings are consistent with that of other \nDistrict Courts who have tried this issue. See Whole Woman’s Health v. Lakey, 46 F. Supp. 3d 673, \n684 (W.D.Tex. 2014) (“The great weight of the evidence demonstrates that, before the act’s \npassage, abortion in Texas was extremely safe with particularly low rates of serious complications \nand virtually no deaths occurring on account of the procedure.”), quoted with approval in WWH, \n136 S.Ct. at 2302, 2311); Planned Parenthood of Wis., Inc. v. Van Hollen, 94 F. Supp. 3d 949, 953 \n(W.D. Wis. 2015) aff’d sub nom. Planned Parenthood of Wis. Inc. v.  Schimel, 806 F.3d 908 (7th \nCir. 2015); Planned Parenthood Southeast, Inc. v. Strange, 33 F. Supp. 3d 1330, 1378 (M.D. Ala. \n2014), cited with approval in WWH, 136 S. Ct. at 2311-12. \n242. In the preliminary injunction order, the Court refrained from making a finding as to \nwhether Act 620 serves the State’s purported interest in women’s health because it was limited by \nthen- prevailing Fifth Circuit precedent. In light of WWH, the Court now assesses the relevant \nevidence and resolves as a factual matter that Act 620 would do very little, if anything, to advance \nwomen’s health and indeed would, by limiting access to legal abortions, substantially increase the \nrisk of harm to women’s health by increasing the risks associated with self-induced or illegal and \nunlicensed abortions.  \n70 \n \n\n \nVIII.  Efforts of Doctors to Comply With Act 620 and the Results of Those Efforts     \nA.  Doe 1  \n  243. For over a year prior to his trial testimony on June 24, 2015, Doe 1 has been trying, in \nvarious ways, to gain active admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of Hope where he \nperforms abortions and thereby comply with Act 620. (Doc. 192 at 42–44.) \n  244. The Court finds that Doe 1 is a well-qualified physician and a credible witness. (See, \ne.g., Doc. 192 at 7–14; JX 111 ¶ 1; 116 ¶ 5.) \n  245.  The Court finds that despite his good faith efforts to comply with Act 620, Doe 1 has \nfailed to get active admitting privileges at five different hospitals for reasons unrelated to his \ncompetence. (See, e.g., JX 116 ¶ 27.) \n  246. Doe 1 has attempted to get privileges at five separate nearby hospitals and, despite his \nefforts and his qualifications, has not been given active admitting privileges at any of these \nhospitals, including University Health, Minden, North Caddo Regional (“North Caddo”), Christus, \nand Willis-Knighton. (See, e.g., Doc. 192 at 47–51.) \n  247. Doe 1 contacted the director of the Family Medicine Department at University Health \nin Shreveport where he had done his residency in family medicine. Doe 1 was initially told that he \nwould be offered a job as a faculty member teaching sports medicine which would “take care of the \nadmitting privileges thing.” Doe 1 was told that the application forms for admitting privileges would \nbe forwarded to him. (Id. at 45; see also JX 186 ¶ 7.) \n  248. When Doe did not get the application forms and inquired, he was told by the director \nof the department that he would not be offered a position because “there was some objection from \n71 \n \n\ncertain staff about [Doe 1] coming to work there because of where [he] work[ed], at Hope Medical.” \n(Doc. 192 at 44–45; see also JX 186 ¶ 7.)41 \n  249. The director suggested that he try with the OB/GYN Department but when that route \nwas explored, Doe 1 was advised by email that it would be “inappropriate” to have a family \nmedicine doctor on the OB/GYN staff. (Doc. 192 at 47.) \n  250. Based on these communications, Doe 1 did not file a formal application for admitting \nprivileges to University. (Id.) \n  251. When Pittman, Hope’s Administrator, made inquiries about admitting privileges to \nNorth Caddo on behalf of Doe 1, she was told that they did not have the capacity for and could not \naccommodate transfers. (JX 116 ¶ 22; see also Doc. 192 at 49.) Therefore, Doe 1 did not file a \nformal application. (Doc. 192 at 49; cf. JX 116 ¶ 22.) \n  252. Doe 1 filed a formal application for privileges at Minden. (JX 50; Doc. 192 at 50–51.) \nMinden’s Medical Staff Coordinator wrote to Doe 1 declining his application: “Since we do not \nhave a need for a satellite primary care physician at this time, I am returning your application and \ncheck.” (JX 50 at 318; see also Doc. 192 at 50–51). \n  253. While the Court, like Doe 1, does not understand the meaning of the stated reason for \ndeclining the application, it is clear that the denial of privileges is unrelated to the qualifications \nand competence of Doe 1. (See Doc. 192 at 51.) \n  254. Doe 1’s efforts to get admitting privileges at Christus reads like a chapter in Franz \nKafka’s The Trial. (See, e.g., JX 71; Doc. 192 at 52–66.) \n                                                 \n41 This testimony was objected to as hearsay, (Doc. 192 at 46), which objection was overruled for the reasons \nsummarized above. See supra note 29. \n72 \n \n\n  255. Doe 1 submitted his application for courtesy privileges to Christus on July 25, 2014, \non a form provided by Christus. (JX 132 at 2772; JX 116 ¶ 23; Doc. 192 at 52.) Courtesy privileges \ngives a physician with such privileges the ability to admit patients. (Doc. 192 at 52–53.) \n  256. On August 25, 2014, Christus asked for additional information, (JX 71 at 1254; see \nalso Doc. 192 at 54–55), which he provided on September 17, 2014, (JX 71 at 1267; JX 133; Doc. \n192 at 55–56). \n  257.  Via a letter dated October 14, 2014, yet more information was sought from Doe 1 by \nChristus, (JX 71 at 1268; see also, e.g., Doc. 192 at 58–59), which he supplied on October 20, 2014, \n(JX 71 at 1273; Doc. 192 at 59–60), and October 25, 2014, (JX 134 at 2802–03). \n  258. When Pittman called Christus to make an appointment for Doe 1 to get an identification \nbadge, also a requirement of the application process, an appointment was refused because, Pittman \nwas told, Doe 1 had submitted the wrong kind of application and that he should be submitting a \n“non-staff care giver” application. (Doc. 192 at 62; cf. JX 71 at 1268, 1270, 1276.) \n  259. On December 17, 2014, Doe 1 then received a letter stating that his application was \nincomplete because Doe 1 hadn’t gotten the badge (the same badge Christus would not give him an \nappointment to get) and because more than 90 days had elapsed since his application was submitted, \nthe application was “deemed withdrawn.” (JX 71 at 1279; Doc 192 at 63.) \n  260. In a follow up conversation initiated by Doe 1 and in a subsequent email from Christus, \nDoe 1 was told that he needed to file an application for non-staff care giver privileges, a type of \nprivilege that would not allow him to admit patients and therefore would not qualify as “active \nadmitting privileges” under Act 620. (JX 190 at 3662; Doc. 192 at 63–66.) \n73 \n \n\n  261. While there was never a formal denial of Doe’s application, Christus’s delays and \nfailure to formally act, as outlined above, constitutes a de facto denial of his application for the \nprivileges required by Act 620. \n  262. Doe 1’s experience was similar when he applied for courtesy privileges at Willis-\nKnighton beginning on June 15, 2014. (JX 53; JX 116 ¶ 27; Doc. 192 at 67–78.) These privileges \nwould have allowed Doe 1 to admit patients. (Doc. 192 at 68–69.)  \n  263. Because of his Board Certification in addiction medicine and because Willis-Knighton \nhas an addiction recovery center, Doe 1 filed his application for privileges as an addiction medicine \nspecialist. (Id. at 70.) \n  264. Doe 1’s application was denied because he had not undergone a residency program in \naddiction medicine, despite his board certification in addiction medicine and even though there was \nno residency program available when he got his board certification. (JX 51 at 508; Doc. 192 at 72–\n73.) \n  265. On February 1, 2015, Doe 1 re-submitted an application, this time as a Family Practice \nspecialist. (JX 97 at 2069–2117; Doc. 192 at 73–74.) \n  266. On March 11, 2015, Willis-Knighton requested information regarding documentation \nof “hospital admissions and management of patients 18 years old of age or older in the past 12 \nmonths.” (JX 128; Doc. 192 at 75–76.) \n  267. On March 24, 2015, Doe 1 provided the requested information. (JX 189; Doc. 192 at \n77–78.) Because of the nature of his practice, he had not admitted any patients in the last 12 months, \nbut he did provide detailed information about his training and procedures done during that same \ntime period. (Id.) \n74 \n \n\n  268. Despite the lapse of more than eight months since his second application and more than \nfive months since he provided the information requested in support of that application, Willis-\nKnighton has neither approved nor denied his application. (See, e.g., id. at 78.) Under these \ncircumstances, the Court finds that this application has been de facto denied. \nB.  Doe 2 \n  269.  Before its closure on March 30, 2017, Doe 2 performed abortions at Bossier Clinic, \nand through January 30, 2016, also performed abortions at Causeway Clinic.  (Doc. 191 at 17:5-9; \nDoc. 255 ¶ 1.) Currently, Doe 2 has a working agreement with Hope under which he performs \nabortions when Hope’s primary physicians, Doe 1 and Doe 3 are unavailable to perform abortion \ncare. (Doc. 272 ¶¶ 3—4.) \n   270. The Court finds Doe 2 to be a well-qualified and competent physician and a credible \nwitness. (Id. at 13–17; JX 112 ¶ 1.) \n  271. Doe 2 does not currently have active admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles \nof Bossier Clinic. (Doc. 191 at 19.) \n  272. Doe 2 has been unsuccessful in his good faith efforts to get admitting active admitting \nprivileges within 30 miles of the Bossier Clinic. (See, e.g., Doc. 191.)   \n  273. Doe 2 worked as an Assistant Clinical Professor of Medicine at LSU Medical School, \nnow known as University Health, at various times for approximately 18 years total, leaving LSU in \n2004. (Id. at 14–15.) \n  274. While he was on staff at University and during the years in which he engaged in a \ngeneral OB/GYN practice, Doe 2 had admitting privileges at various hospitals. (Id. at 24, 95.) \n75 \n \n\n  275. When he left the University staff in 2004, Doe 2 was given consulting privileges, which \nallow him to consult but not to admit patients. (Doc. 191 at 23–24, 84–88; JX 79 at 1708–09; JX \n185.)42 \n  276. Following the passage of Act 620, Doe 2 attempted to upgrade his privileges at \nUniversity to allow him to admit patients in order to comply with the requirements of the Act. (Doc. \n191 at 24–25.) \n  277.  When  he  spoke  to  Dr.  Lynne  Groome  (“Groome”),  the  head  of  the  OB/GYN \nDepartment at University, about upgrading his privileges, he was told this would not happen \nbecause of his abortion practice. (Id. at 25–26; cf. JX 116 ¶ 27.)    \n  278. In his testimony before this Court, he thusly described his communication with \nGroome:     \n  Q.   What’s your understanding of why you were not able to upgrade your privileges at \nLSU? \n  A.   Well, Dr. Groome told me that he was reluctant to even consider that, because it was \nsuch a controversial topic, but he would take it to the Dean and ask, which he did \nand he essentially said that you’re not going to go beyond your [clinical] privileges. \n  Q.  Were you surprised by that response? \n  A.  No. \n  Q.  Why weren’t you surprised? \n \n                                                 \n42 While Doe 2 initially thought that these were called “courtesy privileges,” he corrected his mistake on cross \nexamination. (Doc. 191 at 23, 81–87; JX 185.) \n \n76 \n \n\n  A.  Just because of the political nature of what I do and the controversy of what I do.  \n(Id. at 25–26.)43     \n  279. During the summer of 2014, Doe 2 also applied for privileges at WKB. (Id. at 26–27.) \n  280. On August 11, 2014, the Department of OB/GYN and Pediatrics Performance Peer \nReview Panel (“PPRP”) at WKB wrote to Doe 2 asking for additional information: “In order for \nthe Panel to sufficiently assess your clinical competence, you will need to submit documentation, \nwhich should include operative notes and outcomes, of cases performed within the last 12 months \nfor the specific procedures you are requesting on the privilege request form.” (JX 144 at 3445–46; \nsee also, e.g., Doc. 191 at 29.) \n  281. After Doe 2 made information regarding his prior outpatient operations available to \nWKB, (Doc. 191 at 30), he received another letter from WKB dated November 19, 2014, stating in \npertinent part:  \nThe data [you] submitted supports the outpatient procedures you perform, but does \nnot support your request for hospital privileges. In order for the panel to evaluate \nand make recommendations for hospital privileges [,] they must evaluate patient \nadmissions and management, consultations and procedures performed. Without this \ninformation your application remains incomplete and cannot be processed. \n \n(JX 89 at 1950; see also Doc. 191 at 30–31.) \n  282. Because of the nature of his non-hospital based practice, Doe 2 was unable to provide \nthe requested information.  (See, e.g., Doc. 191 at 29:8-31:1.)  Thus, while Defendant is correct that \nDoe 2’s application was not formally denied (Doc. 201 at 11), Doe 2’s application would never \nhave been approved according to WKP’s own letter. (JX 89; see also, e.g., JX 144 at 3445-46.) \n                                                 \n43 This testimony was objected to as hearsay. (Doc. 191 at 25.) For the same reasons summarized above, see supra \nnote 29, the objection was overruled. \n77 \n \n\n  283. As explained by Doe 2, “You know, they haven’t formally denied me. . . . I’m in a \nCatch-22 basically. I can’t provide information I don’t have.” (Doc. 191 at 79–80.) \n  284. This situation mirrors Doe 1’s experience with three other Willis-Knighton-branded \nentities. Specifically, the Court also notes that although Doe 1, in response to a similar letter from \nWK Medical Center, WK South, and WK Pierremont, (JX 128), formally responded showing he \nhad not had any hospital admissions in the last 12 months, (JX 189 at 3579; Doc. 192 at 77–78), \nWK still has not denied or approved his application, (Doc. 192 at 78). \n  285. The Court finds that, under these circumstances, Doe 2’s inability to gain privileges at \nWKB are unrelated to his competence and that his application to WKB has been de facto denied.  \n  286. While Defendant argues that Willis-Knighton’s inaction is related to Dr. Doe 2's \ncompetence because, due to the nature of his practice, he cannot demonstrate “current clinical \ncompetence” (Doc. 201 at 11), the Court is not persuaded. The reality is different. Doe 2, a Board \nCertified OB/GYN who spent many years as an Assistant Clinical Professor at LSU Medical School \nand  who,  by  Willis-Knighton’s  admission,  has  demonstrated  his  ability  regarding  outpatient \nsurgeries, is in what he correctly describes a “Catch-22” created by a combination of the Act’s \nrequirement and the nature of his practice as an abortion provider. \n  287. Because Doe 2 also practiced at Causeway Clinic in Metairie, he applied for admitting \nprivileges at Tulane, which is within 30 miles of Causeway.  (See, e.g., Doc. 191 at 32:24-35:21, \n230:9-19; JX 180 at 3359.) \n  288. While Defendant has argued that the admitting privileges requirement is only about \ninsuring competency of doctors who perform abortions and the process of gaining admitting \nprivileges is neutral and devoid of considerations of the political, religious and social hostility \n78 \n \n\nagainst abortion, the email exchanges between Doe 2 and Dr. A at Tulane demonstrate a very \ndifferent reality, even in a metropolitan, university-based hospital. (JX 169–78;44 see also Doc. 191 \nat 49–54.) \n  289. In this exchange, Dr. A first feels the need to discuss Doe 2’s request for privileges \n“with our lobbyists.” (JX 169.) Because Doe 2 is a “low/no provider” in hospitals in the New \nOrleans area, Dr. A states: “This is truly a rock and a hard place.” (JX 172.) When Doe 2 expresses \nfrustration with the lack of success in the application process, Dr. A states: “This is just ridiculous. \nI can’t believe the state has come to this.” (JX 174; cf. JX 170.) Dr. A continues: “I am working on \nan approach where you would get admitting privileges only for your patients . . . .” (JX 175.) When \na proposed solution is found and Doe 2 expresses doubt that this will meet the requirements of the \nlaw, Dr. A responds: “Technically, you will have admitting privileges. Isn’t that what the law says?” \n(JX 177). When discussing the need for a covering physician, Dr. A clarifies some of the problems \nsurrounding Doe 2’s application: “There were a few faculty who were not comfortable with \ncovering; they were also concerned that ‘Tulane as back up for an abortion clinic might not help \nour referrals.’ Given this concern, Dr. B will cover for you formally.” (JX 178.) \n  290. When privileges were finally granted by Tulane, Doe 2 was notified by Dr. A that the \nproposed privileges would have “the following limitations: ‘Admissions of patients from the \nphysician’s clinical practice with complications of first and second trimester abortions with referral \nof those patients to an attending physician on the Tulane staff credentialed for OB/GYN privileges \nwho has agreed to provide for such care for the physician’s patients.’” (JX 181; see also Doc. 191 \nat 57, 60–61.) \n                                                 \n44 These exhibits, being jointly submitted, were admitted into evidence. (Doc. 191 at 54.) \n79 \n \n\n  291. Consistent with this email, Tulane’s formal grant circumscribed Doe 2’s privileges in \nthese terms: “Admission of patients from the physician’s clinical practice . . . with referral of those \npatients to an attending physician on staff at [Tulane Medical Center] credentialed for OB/GYN \nprivileges who has agreed to provide care for the physician’s patients at TMS.” (JX 183 at 3652–3; \nsee also Doc. 191 at 33, 55–58.)  \n  292. The Parties disagree as to whether these admitting privileges qualify as “active \nadmitting privileges” within the meaning of Act 620. (Compare Doc. 200 at 46–47, with Doc. 196 \nat 19–20.) \n  293. Defendant has filed an affidavit in which she states that the admitting privileges granted \nto Dr. Doe 2 by Tulane “are sufficient to comply with the Act.” (JX 191 at 3668; see also Docs. \n196 at 20; 200 at 48.)  \n  294. Plaintiffs argue: \nAlthough Secretary Kliebert has taken the position that Dr. John Doe 2’s privileges \nat  Tulane  satisfy  Act  620,  Dr.  John  Doe  2  has  concerns  that  her  position  is \ninconsistent with the plain language of the Act, which requires that ‘the physician is \na member in good standing of the medical staff of a hospital . . . with the ability to \nadmit a patient and to provide diagnostic and surgical services to such patient.’ . . . \nBased on Tulane’s letters, Dr. John Doe 2 cannot provide diagnostic and surgical \nservices to patients admitted to Tulane as required by the plain language of the \nstatute. \n \n(Doc. 196 ¶ 47 at 20 (citing to Doc. 193 at 123; Doc. 191 at 38–40).)  \n  295. Plaintiff further argues: \nDr. John Doe 2 has concerns that the position Secretary Kliebert has taken regarding \nhis privileges at Tulane during the course of this litigation may change at a later date. \nAs a result, he will not risk his medical license by performing abortions in Metairie \nif Act 620 is allowed to take effect. \n \n(Id. ¶ 48 at 20 (citing Doc. 191 at 38–40; JX 191).)  \n80 \n \n\n  296. Defendant makes two counters:  \nPlaintiffs’  ‘concerns’  about  the  Defendant’s  determination  that  Dr.  Doe  2’s \nprivileges at Tulane satisfy the Act are legally irrelevant, because Defendant is the \nstate official charged with interpretation and enforcement of the Act. Furthermore, \nPlaintiffs’ assertions regarding the nature of Dr. Doe 2’s privileges at Tulane \nMedical  Center  are  clearly  wrong  because  they  are  contradicted  by  the \noverwhelming weight of the evidence. \n \n(Doc. 201 ¶ 47 at 12.) \n  297. Defendant further argues:  \nPlaintiffs’ ‘concerns’ that the Defendant’s determination that Dr. Doe 2’s Tulane \nprivileges  satisfy  the  Act  “may  change at  a  later  date”  are  legally  irrelevant. \nPlaintiffs have produced no evidence indicating that any such “change” in position \nby Defendant with respect to Dr. Doe 2’s Tulane privileges is likely to occur. The \nevidence therefore does not show that the Act or the Defendant pose any credible, \nconcrete threat to Dr. Doe 2’s ability to continue his practice at Causeway clinic. If \nDr. Doe 2 voluntarily ceases to perform abortions at Causeway because of his fears \nthat the Defendant (or some future Secretary) will change her position, that cessation \nwould be attributable to Dr. Doe 2 alone and not to the Act itself.  \n \n(Id. ¶ 48 at 12.) \n  298. In light of Defendant’s argument, so as to resolve this dispute and determine whether \nDoe 2 has “active admitting privileges” at Tulane, the Court must first determine whether it is bound \nby the interpretation given by Defendant and, if not, compare the privileges granted by Tulane with \nAct 620’s definition of “active admitting privileges.” \n  299. Whatever discretion the Secretary may have in a law’s enforcement, no deference is \nowed to an opinion contrary to the law’s unambiguous and plain meaning. See, e.g., Util. Air \nRegulatory Grp. v. EPA, 134 S. Ct. 2427, 2442 (2014) (observing that “an agency interpretation \nthat is inconsisten[t] with the design and structure of the statute as a whole . . . does not merit \ndeference” (alteration in original) (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted)); Talk Am., \nInc. v. Mich. Bell Tel. Co., 564 U.S. 50 (2011) (reaffirming the interpretive principle that only “[i]n \n81 \n \n\nthe  absence  of  any  unambiguous  statute  or  regulation”  does  a  court  turn  to  an  agency’s \ninterpretation”); Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 341, 117 S. Ct. 843, 846, 136 L. Ed. 2d \n808 (1997) (emphasizing that a court’s inquiry “must cease if the statutory language is unambiguous \nand  the  statutory  scheme  is  coherent  and  consistent”  and  explaining  that“[t]he  plainness  or \nambiguity of statutory language is determined by reference to the language itself, the specific \ncontext in which that language is used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole” (internal \nquotation marks omitted)). Quite simply, if the legislative intent is clear, as evidenced by the use of \nan unambiguous word, “that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give \neffect to th[at] unambiguously expressed intent.” Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC, Inc., 467 U.S. \n837, 842–43, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 2781, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984) (“Chevron”); see also Miss. Poultry \nAss’n v. Madigan, 992 F.2d 1359, 1363 (5th Cir. 1993) (quoting id.). \n300. If the relevant statute is ambiguous, however, at least some deference is owed. See \nNat’l Cable & Telecommc’ns Ass’n v. Brand X Internet Servs., 545 U.S. 967, 980 (2005). But such \ndeference is only accorded if the statute is truly “ambiguous” regarding the precise “question at \nissue” and if the agency’s interpretation is a “reasonable” and hence “permissible construction of \nthe statute” at hand. Orellana-Monson v. Holder, 685 F.3d 511, 517 (5th Cir. 2012); see also, e.g., \nSiew v. Holder, 742 F.3d 603, 607 n.27 (5th Cir. 2014) (citing id.); United States v. Baptiste, 34 F. \nSupp. 3d 662, 670 (W.D. Tex. 2014) (same). Thus, even if the pertinent statute is ambiguous, an \nagency’s interpretation may be denied “controlling weight” if “arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly \ncontrary to the statute.” Rodriguez-Avalos v. Holder, 788 F.3d 444, 449 (5th Cir. 2015) (quoting \nOrellana-Monson, 685 F.3d at 517). \n82 \n \n\n301. Critically, as federal courts are bound to “interpret a state statute as that state’s courts \nwould construe it,” Newman, 305 F.3d at 696, the same type of measured deference is afforded to \nagency interpretations by this state’s courts. Compare Silva-Trevino v. Holder, 742 F.3d 197, 199–\n200 (5th Cir. 2014), with Zeringue v. State Dep’t of Public Safety, 467 So. 2d 1358, 1361 (La. Ct. \nApp. 5  Cir. 1985). Like their federal counterparts, Louisiana state agencies are “entitled to \ndeference regarding . . .  interpretation and construction of the rules and regulations that . . . \n[they] promulgate[].” Women’s & Children’s Hosp. v. State, 07-1157 (La. App. 1 Cir. 02/08/08); \n984 So. 2d 760, 768–69; see also Oakville Cmty. Action Grp. v. La. Dep’t of Envtl. Quality, 05-\n1365 (La. App. 1 Cir. 5/5/06); 935 So. 2d 175, 186 (“A state agency is charged with interpreting its \nown rules and regulations and great deference must be given to the agency’s interpretation.”)  \n302. However, as with Chevron, the statute itself must be ambiguous for such respect to be \naccorded. Clark v. Bd. of Comm’rs, 422 So. 2d 247, 251 (La. Ct. App. 1982) (“[A]lthough an \nagency’s interpretation of a statute under which it operates is entitled to some deference, such \ndeference is constrained by the court’s obligation to honor the clear meaning of a statute, as revealed \nby its language, purpose and history.”); cf. Comm-Care Corp. v. Bishop, 96-1711 (La. 07/01/97); \n696 So. 2d 969, 973 (“The meaning and intent of a law is to be determined by consideration of the \nlaw in its entirety and all other laws on the same subject matter, and a construction should be placed \non the provision in question which is consistent with the express terms of the law and with the \nobvious intent of the lawmaker in enacting it.”).  \n303.  Moreover,  again  as  with  a  federal  statute,  “agency[]  interpretations”  lose  any \npersuasive value, forfeiting any right to judicial deference, if “arbitrary, capricious or manifestly \ncontrary to its rules and regulation.” In re Recovery I, 93-0441 (La. App. 1 Cir. 04/08/94); 635 So. \n83 \n \n\n2d 690, 696; see also, e.g., Doctors Hosp. of Augusta v. Dep’t of Health & Hosps., 13-1762 (La. \nApp. 1 Cir. 09/17/14); 2014 La. App. Unpub. LEXIS 481, at *19–20, 2014 WL 4658202, at *7 \n(refusing to accord any deference to an interpretation by the same agency here, deeming it “an abuse \nof discretion” that effectively rewrote the relevant statute); Bowers v. Firefighters’ Ret. Sys., 08-\n1268 (La. 03/17/09); 6 So. 3d 173, 176 (“Under the arbitrary and capricious standard, an agency \ndecision is entitled to deference in its interpretation of its own rules and regulations; however, it is \nnot entitled to deference in its interpretation of statutes and judicial decisions.” (emphasis added)). \n  304. The Court finds that Defendant’s interpretation of Act 620 is contradicted by its plain \nlanguage. Expressly and unambiguously, the statute defines “active admitting privileges” to include \n“the ability to admit a patient and to provide diagnostic and surgical services to such patient \nconsistent with the requirements of Paragraph (A)(1) of this Subsection [requiring a physician \nperforming abortions to be licensed and have completed or be enrolled in an OB/GYN or family \nresidency program].” LA. R.S. § 40:1299.35.2A(2)(a).45 \n  305. Because the validity of Defendant’s interpretation arose during trial, the Court asked \nthe following question to Marier, Defendant’s expert witness, a physician who helped draft Act \n620, (Doc. 193 at 94): “And I understood you to say that the doctor, in order to meet Act 620 would \nhave to - - would not have to be able to perform all diagnostic and surgical services, but would have \nto perform some diagnostic and surgical services. Did I understand that correctly?” (Doc. 193 at \n123 (emphasis added).) To this question, Marier answered: “Yes. Yes, Your Honor.” (Id.) \n  306. Because Doe 2’s privileges are limited to “admission of patients” with the obligation \nto refer his patient to a “Tulane staff OB/GYN” for surgery and other kinds of treatment as well as \n                                                 \n45 As already noted, see supra note 2, the text of Act 620 can be found in a joint exhibit. (JX 115.) \n84 \n \n\ndiagnostic services, this arrangement does not allow Doe 2 to perform any (let alone “some”) \ndiagnostic, surgical or other kinds of treatment himself. Regardless of that fact that Tulane has \nchosen to label him an “admitting physician,” (JX 184), he cannot “provide diagnostic and surgical \nservices,” and Act 620 expressly defines “active admitting privileges” as encompassing the ability \nto do so, La. Rev. Stat. § 40:1299.35.2A(2)(a). Hence, Doe 2’s privileges do not and cannot meet \nthe plain language of Act 620.            \n  307. Here, as Defendant’s own expert testified and as the statute’s plain meaning makes \nclear, the Secretary’s interpretation flies in the face of the law’s basic text. The words are clear, \ntheir meaning patent, and, under these circumstances, the Defendant’s interpretation is not entitled \nto deference. “It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the \nlaw is.” Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 177, 2 L. Ed. 60 (1803); see, e.g., Harrah’s Bossier City \nInv. Co., LLC v. Bridges, 09-1916 (La. 05/11/10); 41 So. 3d 438, 449 (“Although courts may give \ndue consideration to the administrative construction of a law, we are certainly not bound by them.”); \nSalazar-Regino v. Rominski, 415 F.3d 436, 448 (5th Cir. 2005) (citing this maxim in the context of \nweighing the reasonableness of an agency’s particular interpretation); Sexton v. Panel Processing, \nInc., 754 F.3d 332, 336 (6th Cir. 2014) (rejecting an agency interpretation as contrary to the \nstatutory language as interpreted).  \n308. The Court also notes that the Defendant’s interpretation allowing (and, in the case of \nDr. Doe 2 and Tulane, requiring) the abortion provider to turn over the actual care of the patient to \nanother doctor, flies in the face of one of Act 620’s main purposes and purported medical benefits: \n“continuity of care,” the ability of a the abortion provider to treat his patient in the hospital if \nadmission to the hospital is necessary.  (See, e.g., Doc. 193 at 21–23; Doc. 200 ¶¶ 91 at 98–101.) \n85 \n \n\n  309.  While Defendant is correct that Secretary Kliebert was the person charged with \nenforcing this provision, it is also true that the Secretary of DHH often changes every few years.46 \n(Doc. 191 at 198–99, 195–96.)  \n  310. It is also true that the new Secretary may disagree with her predecessor and reverse \ncourse on her current interpretation of Act 620.47    \n  311. The Court finds that Doe 2 has legitimate concerns about relying on the declaration of \nDefendant to practice as an abortion provider if Act 620 were to go into effect. \n  312. More importantly, the Court finds that Doe 2 does not have active admitting privileges \nwithin the meaning of Act 620 at a hospital within 30 miles of Causeway Clinic. In any event, \nCauseway closed and returned its license to DHH, effective February 10, 2016. (Doc. 255 ¶3.) \nC.  Doe 3 \n  313. Doe 3 currently has admitting privileges at the WKB and Christus, both of which are \nwithin 30 miles of Hope Clinic where he performs abortions. (Doc. 190 at 21–22, 120, 148–49; \nJX 188 ¶ 6; JX 116 ¶ 18.) \n  314. The Court finds that Doe 3 is a well-qualified physician and a credible witness. (See, \ne.g., JX 188 ¶ 1; Doc. 190 at 109–11.) \n                                                 \n46 Indeed, in the wake of the recent gubernatorial election, Dr. Rebekah Gee has become DHH’s new head. \n \n47 At the time, Kliebert did not even say she will bind herself to this interpretation during her time in office. While not \ndirectly relevant to this matter, the Court notes that in a recent case, this same agency has submitted multiple \ninconsistent declarations and abruptly changed legal positions without much explanation. Planned Parenthood Gulf \nCoast, Inc. v. Kliebert, No. 15-cv-00565-JWD-SCR, 2015 WL 6551836, at *8–9, *33, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n146988, at *27–29, *109–10 (M.D. La. Oct. 29, 2015). Though these inconsistencies do not appear in this case, this \nCourt may take judicial notice of its own public docket. FED. R. EVID. 201; see, e.g., EduMoz, LLC v. Republic of \nMozambique, 968 F. Supp. 2d 1041, 1049 (C.D. Cal. 2013); Richardson v. Monaco (In re Summit Metals, Inc.), 477 \nB.R. 484, 488 n.1 (Bankr. D. Del. 2012); LeBlanc v. Salem (In re Mailman Steam Carpet Cleaning Corp.), 196 F.3d \n1, 8 (1st Cir. 1999). Of course, there is now a new Secretary whose position is not declared in this record. \n86 \n \n\n  315. Doe 3’s current privileges at Christus require him to admit approximately 50 patients \nper year. (Doc. 190 at 150–52; JX 59.) \n  316. Doe 3 has had admitting privileges at Christus since the 1990’s and at WKB since \nlate 1997 or early 1998. (Doc. 190 at 120–21.) \n  317. Doe 3 uses his admitting privileges primarily in connection with his busy obstetrics \npractice delivering babies and, to a lesser extent to his private practice in gynecology, not because \nof his work at Hope Clinic. (Id. at 124, 147; see also JX 188 ¶ 7.) \n  318. As a result of his fears of violence and harassment, Doe 3 has credibly testified that if \nhe is the last physician performing abortion in either the entire state or in the northern part of the \nstate, he will not continue to perform abortions. (Doc. 190 at 174–76; see also, e.g., JX 188 ¶¶ 10–\n11.) \nD.  Doe 4 \n  319. Doe 4 performed abortions at Causeway Clinic in Metairie.  (See, e.g. JX 114 ¶ 1; Doc. \n168-5 at 8.) \n  320. He does not currently have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of that \nclinic. (Doc. 191 at 18.) \n  321. Doe 4 testified by deposition, (Doc. 168-5), and so the Court did not have the \nopportunity to directly measure his demeanor. However, the Court finds that Doe 4 is a well-\nqualified physician, (See, e.g., JX 114 ¶ 1; Doc. 168-5 at 5–6, 9, 12), and that his testimony is \ncredible and consistent with the other testifying doctors who perform abortions.      \n  322. On August 6, 2014, Dr. John Doe 4 applied for admitting privileges at Ochsner-Kenner \nMedical Center (“Ochsner”). (JX 57 at 762–808; see also Doc. 168-5 at 16–17.)  \n87 \n \n\n  323. Doe 4 chose to apply to Ochsner because he knew a physician there who agreed to \nprovide coverage for him. (Id. at 17.) Ochsner was the only hospital where Doe 4 knew a physician \nwho would cover for him and who met the hospital’s criteria to be a covering physician. (Id. at 85, \n109–10.) \n  324. Ochsner requested additional information, which Doe 4 provided.  (JX 98 at 2118; JX \n60 at 824), but he did not receive a response over the subsequent year prior to the closure of \nCauseway Clinic.  (Doc. 240.) \n  325. Doe 4 did not apply for admitting privileges at Touro Infirmary or LSU New Orleans \nbecause both hospitals required Doe 4 to find an OB/GYN to cover for him, which Doe 4 has been \nunable to do. (Id. at 23.) \n  326. The Court finds that, despite a good faith effort to gain admitting privileges at a hospital \nwithin 30 miles of where he performs abortions, and given the fact that it has been well over a year \nsince he applied for privileges with no response, the Court finds that Doe 4’s inability to meet the \nrequirements of Act 620 is unrelated to his competence and his request for privileges has been de \nfacto denied. \nE.  Doe 5 \n  327. Doe 5 performs abortions at two facilities: Woman Health’s in New Orleans and Delta \nin Baton Rouge. (See, e.g., Doc. 168-6 at 4; JX 109 ¶ 7.)  \n  328. Like Doe 4, Doe 5 testified by deposition, and this Court hence did not have the \nopportunity to directly measure his demeanor. However, in reviewing his deposition and related \ndocumentation, (See, e.g., Doc. 168-6; JX 109), the Court finds the testimony to be credible and \nconsistent with the other testifying doctors who perform abortions.  \n88 \n \n\n  329. The Court finds that Doe 5 has active admitting privileges at Hospital C, a hospital \nwithin 30 miles of the Women’s Clinic in New Orleans, but that he has been unable to get admitting \nprivileges within 30 miles of Delta. (See, e.g., JX 109 ¶ 32–5.)  \n  330. On July 24, 2014, Doe 5 received admitting privileges at Hospital C, which is within \n30 miles of Women’s Clinic where he performs abortions. (Docs. 168-4 at 25–26; 168-6 at 11; JX \n109 ¶ 34.) \n  331. The Parties have stipulated that Doe 5’s privileges at Hospital C are “active admitting \nprivileges” as defined in Act 620. (Docs. 176; Doc. 168-4 at 26; 168-6 at 11–13.) \n  332. Doe 5 does not currently have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of \nDelta in Baton Rouge. (See, e.g., Doc. 168-6 at 22; JX 109 ¶ 23.)  \n  333. Doe 5 has applied for admitting privileges at three hospitals in the Baton Rouge area: \nWoman’s Hospital in April or May of 2014 and Lane Regional Medical Center and Baton Rouge \nGeneral Medical Center in July of 2014. (Doc. 168-6 at 11; JX 109 ¶¶ 32–33.) \n  334. Doe 5 has been unable to find a local physician who is willing to provide coverage for \nhim when he is not in Baton Rouge, which all three hospitals require. (JX 109 ¶¶ 32–33; Doc. 51; \nDoc. 168-6 at 11–12.) \n  335. The Court finds that Doe 5, despite good faith efforts to meet the requirements of Act \n620, has been unable to do so in the Baton Rouge area for a period of well over a year for reasons \nunrelated to his competence. Under these circumstances, while his applications have not been \nfinally acted upon and are therefore technically “pending,” the Court finds that they have been de \nfacto denied. \n \n89 \n \n\nF.  Doe 6 \n  336. Doe 6 is a Board Certified OB/GYN with 48 years of experience who is the Medical \nDirector of Woman’s Clinic in New Orleans and Delta Clinic in Baton Rouge. (JX 168 ¶ 1; see also \nJX 109 ¶ 8.) \n  337. Doe 6 provided his testimony by declaration, (JX 168), and so the Court did not have \nthe opportunity to directly measure his demeanor. However, in reviewing his Declaration, the Court \nfinds the testimony to be credible and consistent with the other testifying doctors who perform \nabortions in Louisiana. \n  338. While Doe 6 is Medical Director at both Women’s and Delta, “[d]ue to [his] age and \nthe demands of traveling back and forth between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, along with [his] \nprivate gynecology practice in New Orleans, [he is] no longer able to provide abortion[s] in Baton \nRouge.” (JX 168 ¶ 3; see also JX 109 ¶ 8.) \n  339. As a result, Doe 6 ceased performing abortions at Delta in Baton Rouge in April of \n2012, leaving only Doe 5 performing abortions at that facility. (JX 168 ¶ 3; see also JX 109 ¶ 9.) \n  340. Doe 6 does not currently have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of \nWomen’s Clinic or Delta Clinic. (JX 168 ¶¶ 15, 21.) \n  341. From approximately 1973 to 2005, when he had an OB/GYN practice, Doe 6 had \nadmitting privileges at various hospitals in New Orleans. (Id. ¶ 13.) As his private practice became \nsolely a gynecology practice, and due to the low rate of abortion complications, he was unable to \nmeet the hospitals’ requirements to admit a minimum number of patients each year. (Id.) Doe 6 also \ndid not need admitting privileges because he was not admitting patients to the hospital. (Id.) \nConsequently, when his admitting privileges expired, he did not apply to renew them. (Id.)  \n90 \n \n\n  342. Doe 6 contacted Tulane about the possibility of obtaining admitting privileges and was \ntold not to bother applying because he would not be granted privileges, as he had not had admitting \nprivileges at any hospital since 2005. (JX 168 ¶ 12.)48 Defendant argues that this testimony is \ninconsistent with that of Doe 2, who was able to get courtesy privileges at Tulane. (Doc. 201 at 14.) \nEspecially given Doe 6’s age and other differences in the professional circumstances of these two \ndoctors, (compare JX ¶ 8, and JX 168 ¶ 13, with Doc. 191 at 14–16, 22–23), this assertion is not \nsupported and unpersuasive. In addition, Doe 6’s limited privileges, like Doe 2’s, do not meet the \nrequirements of Act 620, read and construed as enacted. (See supra Part VIII.) \n  343. Prior to September 1, 2014, Doe 6 applied for admitting privileges at East Jefferson \nHospital in New Orleans, which is within 30 miles of Women’s Clinic. (JX 109 ¶¶ 31–33; JX 168 \n¶ 15.) On September 17, 2014, East Jefferson requested additional information, which he then \nprovided. (Doc. 51 at 2.) Since that time, no action has been taken. (Id.; see also, e.g., JX 168 ¶ 15.) \nThat application, now pending for over a year, is considered by the Court to have been de facto \ndenied. \n  344. Doe 6 testified that he did not apply to other hospitals within 30 miles of Women’s \nClinic because, due to the nature of his practice as an abortion provider, he did not admit a sufficient \nnumber of patients to receive active admitting privileges. (JX 168 ¶ 11.) \n \n \n   \n                                                 \n48 While Defendant argues that this testimony is hearsay, (Doc. 201 at 14), Defendant did not make this objection \nprior to or at trial. Even if the objection would have been made, it would have been overruled for the same reasons as \nher other similar objections. See supra note 30. \n91 \n \n\nG.  Post-Hearing Updates \n  345. On September 17, 2015, the Court requested that Plaintiffs update the Court on or \nbefore September 24, 2015, on the status of the admitting privileges of the doctors and, if there \nwere any changes, to provide the details of same. (Doc. 206.)  \n  346. By letter of September 25, 2015, the Plaintiffs informed the Court and Defendants that, \nafter making inquiries, they were unaware of any material changes in the status of the applications \nof Does 1–6. (Doc. 209.)  \n  347. At a telephone status conference of September 28, 2015, this letter was received into \nevidence without objection as JX 193. (Doc. 210.) Since the issuance of the preliminary injunction \non January 26, 2016, the Plaintiffs advised the Court that, after making inquiries, they are unaware \nof any material changes in the status of the applications of Does 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6, beyond the fact \nthe Doe 4 is no longer pursuing privileges due to the February 2016 closure of Causeway clinic.  \n(Doc. 249; Doc. 255 ¶¶ 2—3.) Additionally, Plaintiffs informed the Court that on March 30, 2017, \nBossier ceased business and returned its license to DHH, but that Doe 2 is still performing abortions \nat Hope when Does 1 and 3 are unavailable to provide abortion care. (Docs. 270; 272 ¶¶ 3—4.) \n IX.  Effects of Act 620               \nA.  The Effect of Act 620 on Does 1-6  \n  348. The number and location of doctors and clinics providing abortions varies widely from \nstate to state. The effect of an admitting privileges requirement on those providers and the \nconcomitant effect on women’s right to an abortion has also varied state to state. \n  349. Before the passage of Act 620, doctors performing abortions in Louisiana were not \nrequired to and, for their practices, did not need to have admitting privileges at any hospital, let \n92 \n \n\nalone a nearby hospital, in order to safely provide services for their patients. (Docs. 190 at 25, 36–\n37, 39, 127, 197–98; 191 at 46; 195 at 32; JX 135 at 2804; JX 110 ¶ 7; JX 168 ¶ 8.) \n  350. As summarized above, at the time Act 620 was passed, only one of the six doctors \nperforming abortions, Doe 3, had admitting privileges at a hospital and he maintained these \nadmitting privileges for years in order to facilitate his general OB/GYN practice which was and is \nunrelated to that portion of his practice performing abortions at Hope. \n  351. Since the passage of Act 620, all five remaining doctors have attempted in good faith \nto comply with Act 620. All five have attempted to get admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 \nmiles of where they perform abortions. All five have made formal applications to at least one nearby \nhospital and three of the five doctors have filed applications at multiple hospitals within thirty miles.  \n  352. Two of the doctors, Does 2 and 5, performed abortions in two separate cities and thus, \neach had to apply at hospitals in two different locales. \n  353. Based on a careful review of the evidence, the Court finds that, notwithstanding the \ngood faith efforts of Does 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 to comply with the Act by getting active admitting \nprivileges at a hospital within 30 miles of where they perform abortions, they have had very limited \nsuccess for reasons related to Act 620 and not related to their competence. \n  354. The five doctors have filed thirteen separate formal applications at nearby hospitals. In \nonly one of those cases–Doe 5 at Hospital C49–were active admitting privileges granted. In another \ncase, that of Doe 2 at Tulane, he was given admitting privileges that do not comport with the plain \nlanguage of Act 620.   \n                                                 \n49 It is noteworthy that Hospital C, a hospital in a major metropolitan area and not a party to this action, is so \nconcerned about the ramifications of having its identity publically revealed, that it requested that it be named only \nthrough a pseudonym and, with the consent of all the Parties, this was allowed. See supra Part V.E. \n93 \n \n\n  355. Of the thirteen formal applications filed, only one has been frankly denied, the \napplication of Doe 1 at Minden. \n  356. The remaining ten applications have never been finally acted upon because the doctor \napplying, given the nature of his practice as an abortion provider, either cannot provide the \ninformation required or the information has been provided and the application remains in limbo for \nundisclosed reasons. In almost every instance, more than a year has passed since the original \napplications were filed. \n   357. Defendant argues that where these applications are “pending,” the applications have \nnot been denied and therefore Plaintiffs have failed to prove that Act 620 has caused the failure of \nthese doctors to get admitting privileges.  \n  358. The Court disagrees. Because Louisiana has no statutorily prescribed time limit within \nwhich a hospital must act on a physician’s application, see supra Part V.D, a hospital can effectively \ndeny the application by simply not acting upon it. Given the length of time involved in these \napplications, the Court finds that this is precisely what has occurred here.  \n  359. Doe 3 has been threatened as a result of his work at Hope Clinic. (See, e.g., JX 113 ¶ \n3.)  Last year, anti-abortion activists from outside Louisiana left fliers on neighbors’ mailboxes \ncalling him an abortionist and saying they wanted to convert him to Jesus. (Doc. 190 at 108–09; \nsee also JX 113 ¶ 3.) \n  360. These individuals also approached Doe 3’s regular medical practice patients as they \ntried to enter his office, requiring the building security officers to escort the activists off the \npremises. (Doc. 190 at 109; see also JX 113 ¶ 3.) These individuals told Doe 3’s patients that he \nkilled babies and that they should not see him. (Doc. 190 at 109.) \n94 \n \n\n  361. Doe 3, the only abortion doctor who had privileges at the time Act 620 was passed, \n(See, e.g., JX 116 ¶ 18), fears that, if the other Louisiana abortion providers are not able to obtain \nadmitting privileges, he will become an even greater target for anti-abortion violence. (See, e.g., JX \n113 ¶¶ 3–7.) He specifically testified that “all [these individuals] have to do is eliminate [him] as \nthey have Dr. Tiller and some of the other abortion providers around the country” to eliminate \nabortion entirely in Northern Louisiana. (Doc. 190 at 174–75.) \n  362. Doe 3 is also concerned that such individuals could “cause a lot of other . . . problems \nthat would affect [his] ability to perform the rest of [his] practice.” (Id. at 174–75; cf. JX 113 ¶ 8.) \n  363. Doe 3 has difficulty arranging coverage for his OB/GYN practice because other \nOB/GYN doctors in the Shreveport area refuse to cover his practice as a result of his work at Hope \nClinic performing abortions. (Doc. 190 at 111–13.) \n  364. Dr. Doe 3 testified that, as a result of his fears, and the demands of his private OB/GYN \npractice, if he is the last physician performing abortion in either the entire state or in the northern \npart of the state, he will not continue to perform abortions. (Id. at 174–76; see also JX 116 ¶ 19.) \nThe Court finds his testimony credible and supported by the weight of other evidence in the \nrecord.50 \n  365. To summarize, \n-  If Act 620 takes effect, Doe 1 will no longer be allowed to provide abortions in Louisiana \nbecause he does not have admitting privileges pursuant to the Act within 30 miles of Hope. \n-  If Act 620 takes effect, Doe 2 will no longer be allowed to provide abortions in Louisiana, \nbecause he does not have active admitting privileges pursuant to the Act within 30 miles of Bossier \n                                                 \n50 The issue of whether this fact is legally relevant to the undue burden analysis is discussed in this Ruling’s \nConclusions of Law. See infra Parts XI–XII. \n95 \n \n\nor Hope.  The privileges Doe 2 obtained at Tulane in an attempt to be able to provide abortions at \nCauseway Clinic prior to its closure, were limited such that they did not comply with Act. \nCauseway, in any event, is now closed.  \n-  If Act 620 takes effect, Doe 3, who does not have admitting privileges pursuant to the Act \nwithin 30 miles of Hope, will no longer provide abortions in Louisiana because of a well-founded \nconcern for his personal safety. Since Doe 2 has been unable to get active admitting privileges \nwithin 30 miles of Hope or Bossier, Doe 3 would be the sole remaining provider.  \n-  If Act 620 takes effect, Doe 4 would not be able to provide abortions in Louisiana because \nhe could not obtain admitting privileges pursuant to the Act, based on his unsuccessful efforts to do \nso prior to the closure of Causeway Clinic. \n-  If Act 620 takes effect, Doe 5 will be able to provide abortions at Women’s Clinic, in New \nOrleans, where he has admitting privileges pursuant to the Act but Doe 5 will be the only physician \navailable to provide abortion care in southern Louisiana, and in all likelihood, the only physician \navailable to provide abortion care in the entire state. \n -  However, Doe 5 will not be able to provide abortions at Delta in Baton Rouge because he \ndoes not have admitting privileges pursuant to the Act within 30 miles of Delta and, despite good \nfaith efforts to get same, has been unable to do so. \n-  If Act 620 takes effect, Doe 6 will no longer be allowed to provide abortions in Louisiana \nbecause he does not have admitting privileges pursuant to the Act within 30 miles of Women’s \nClinic. \n96 \n \n\n  366. The Court finds that the inability of Does 1, 4 and 6 to get active admitting privileges \nat any hospital is directly related to the requirements of Act 620 as they apply in concert with \nexisting Louisiana law and the Louisiana rules and practices for getting admitting privileges. \n  367. The Court finds that the inability of Doe 2 to get active admitting privileges within 30 \nmiles of Bossier and only limited privileges (not “active admitting privileges”) within 30 miles of \nCauseway as well as Doe 5’s inability to get active admitting privileges within 30 miles of the Delta \nare also directly attributable to the requirements of Act 620 as they apply in concert with the rules \nand practices for getting admitting privileges in Louisiana. \nB.  The Effect of Act 620 on the Clinics and Women of Louisiana       \n  368. If Act 620 were to be enforced, three of the five doctors currently providing abortions \nin Louisiana – Does 1, 2, and 6 - would not meet the admitting privileges requirement. If Doe 3 \nquits the abortion practice, as he has testified he will, Louisiana would be left with one provider \nand one clinic.  As is analyzed in more detail below, this would result in a substantial number of \nLouisiana women being denied access to abortion in this state.  A single remaining physician \nproviding abortion services in Louisiana cannot possibly meet the level of services needed in the \nstate.  The Court finds that this one physician will not be able to perform 10,000 procedures per \nyear.  (Doc. 168-6 at 8; DX 148 ¶ 11.) \n  369. If Act 620 were to be enforced, two of the three remaining clinics – Hope and Delta – \nwould have no abortion provider, with the one remaining clinic (Women’s) without one of the two \ndoctors that normally serves its patients. \n  370. Women’s Clinic would have only Doe 5 to handle not only all patients at that facility \nbut the patients at the other four. According to Cochran, the Administrator at Women’s Health, Doe \n97 \n \n\n6 provided 60% of the abortion services at this center. As she testified, “[e]ven if Dr. Doe 5 were \nto commit all of his time to serving patients at Women’s Clinic, I do not see how we could serve \nall of the patients who [would] be coming to our doors once Delta Clinic closes . . . .” (JX 109 ¶ \n37.) \n  371. Furthermore, since Women’s Health would be the only clinic to serve all the women \nof Louisiana, it clearly could not perform that task as a logistical matter. Doe 5 performed a total \napproximately 2,950 abortions in the year 2013 at Delta and Women’s. (JX 110 ¶ 7.) Given the \n9,976 abortions performed in Louisiana in that same year,51 and putting aside the issue of the \ndistance which would need to be traveled by women in north Louisiana,52 approximately 70% of \nthe women in Louisiana seeking an abortion53 would be unable to get an abortion in Louisiana.  \n  372. Even if one were to conclude that Doe 3 will not quit or that his quitting is legally \nirrelevant, Act 620 will nonetheless result in a substantial number of Louisiana women being unable \nto obtain an abortion in this state.  Just the loss of Doe 1 at Hope would be, according to Pittman, \nHope’s administrator, “devastating” to its operations and viability.  (Doc. 190 at 29:15- \n21.) \n                                                 \n51 This data is taken from the affidavit of Defendant’s expert, Solanky, who, in turn, took it from DHH’s website. \n(DX 148 at 5.) \n \n52 The Court in WWH noted that “increases [in distance travelled] are but one additional burden [] which [] [should \nbe] taken together with others that the closings brought about, and [] viewed in light of the virtual absence of any \nhealth benefit…” WWH, 136 S. Ct. 2313. \n \n53 The Court in WWH rejected Texas’ position that the proper denominator in measuring whether a “large fraction” of \nwomen are unduly burdened should be Texan women of reproductive age. 136 S. Ct at 2320. “[] Casey used the \nlanguage ‘large fraction’ to refer to ‘a large fraction of cases in which [the provision at issue is relevant,’ a class \nnarrower than ‘all women,” “pregnant women.’ Or even ‘the class of women seeking abortions identified by the \nState.’ 505 U.S. at 894-895, 112 S. Ct. 2791 (opinion of the Court) (emphasis added) Here, as in Casey, the relevant \ndenominator is ‘those [women] for whom [the provision] is an actual rather than an irrelevant restriction.’ Id., at 895, \n112 S. Ct 2791.” WWH 136 S. Ct at 2320. \n98 \n \n\n  373. Doe 3 sees about 20 to 30 abortion patients per week, or roughly 1,000 to 1,500 per \nyear.  (Id. at 118:1-4.)  This would leave roughly 5,500 Louisiana women seeking an abortion (or \n55%) without the ability to get one. \n  374. Even if one additionally assumes that Defendant’s interpretation of Doe 2’s privileges \nat Tulane is correct, so that he meets the requirements of Act 620 at Tulane, Causeway closed in \nJanuary 2016.  The Bossier clinic is now closed, but even if it reopened, Doe 2 would not be \npermitted to perform abortions there were Act 620 to go into full effect. \n  375. Hope and Women’s, the two clinics that would remain, assuming Doe 3 did not quit or \nthat his quitting was (incorrectly, in this Court’s view) determined to be insufficiently related to \nAct 620, would each be without one of the two providers who normally perform abortions, an \ninsufficient number to service the patients in the region, let alone the number of patients who might \ncome from other parts of the state because of insufficient capacity. \n  376. Analyzed regionally, if Act 620 were to be enforced, the Baton Rouge and Shreveport \nareas would have no facility, and the New Orleans area would have only one provider. If, as \nDefendant argues, Doe 3’s quitting is legally irrelevant, Baton Rouge and Bossier City would be \nleft with no facility, Shreveport with one (Hope) and New Orleans with one (Woman’s).  But both \nremaining facilities would have only half the previous number of providers.  Doe 3 and Doe 5 \ncannot possibly meet the demand of 10,000 abortion patients in Louisiana each year. \n377. Although the court did not receive additional evidence beyond the stipulation of the \nparties regarding the closure of Causeway Clinic, and therefore draws no inferences regarding the \ncause of the closure, the fact that women seeking abortions now have one fewer clinic available, \n99 \n \n\ndoes not change, and, if anything, further supports the Court’s findings regarding the impact of Act \n620 on access.  \n  378. Similarly, the Court did not receive evidence regarding the reason for Bossier’s closure \nand draws no inference as to the reason for it. But, regardless of the reason, its closure reinforces \nthe Court’s findings regarding access.  \n379. Common sense dictates that the result of two fewer clinics will be greater demand on \nthe remaining clinics, thus amplifying the impact of any change that will result in additional \nclosures or fewer physicians providing abortions.  It is plain that Act 620 would result in the closure \nof clinics, fewer physicians, longer waiting times for appointments, increased crowding and \nincreased associated health risks. \n  380. Abortion clinics in Louisiana routinely make efforts to recruit doctors to work at the \nclinics, such as placing advertisements throughout the state and working with reproductive health \nspecialists to identify potential candidates. (Doc. 190 at 22, 24–25, 33, 87; Doc. 168-8 at 7–8.)  \n  381. The anticipated admitting privileges requirement of Act 620 has made it difficult to \nrecruit new doctors. (Doc. 190 at 24.)  In Pittman’s words, “It definitely has.” (Id.) \n  382.  For example, Hope recently identified an interested doctor, but this potential physician \nultimately proved to be an unviable candidate as a result of Act 620’s admitting privileges \nrequirement. (Id. at 24–25.) \n  383. In addition, doctors who appear to be good candidates consistently express reluctance \nto be hired in Louisiana because of the numerous restrictions placed on abortion providers by \nLouisiana’s existing laws and regulations. (See id. at 22–25.) The hostile environment against \nabortion providers in Louisiana and nationally is another factor making recruiting difficult.  (Doc. \n100 \n \n\n190 at 22:17-25:2; JX 110 ¶¶ 16, 23 n.1; JX 109 ¶ 14.) This includes harassment and violence \ntowards abortion providers, including the murders of eight abortion providers across the country.  \n(Doc. 190 at 22:20-23:12, 23:21-24:1, 87:9-11.)  As one of the physicians noted, in light of “the \nhostile environment in Louisiana towards abortion providers and the extreme harassment and \nintimidation by anti-abortion activists, most doctors are simply too afraid.” (JX 110 ¶ 16.) \n  384. For the same reasons that Does 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 have had difficulties getting active \nadmitting privileges, reasons unrelated to their competence, the Court finds that it is unlikely that \nthe effected clinics will be able to comply with the Act by recruiting new physicians who have or \ncan obtain admitting privileges. A significant contributing factor to that inability is Act 620 and the \ndifficulties it creates for a doctor with an abortion practice gaining active admitting privileges in \nthe context of Louisiana’s admitting privileges rules and practices. \n  385. The Court finds that the enforcement of Act 620 and the concomitant effect on \nrestricted access to abortion doctors and clinics would result in delays in care, causing a higher risk \nof complications, as well as a likely increase in self-performed, unlicensed and unsafe abortions. \n(See, e.g., id. at 222–24; Doc. 191 at 157–62.)  \nC.  The Real-World Effect of Act 620 on Louisiana Women \n386. All women seeking an abortion in Louisiana would face greater obstacles than they do \nat present were Act 620 to be fully implemented, due to the dramatic reduction in the number of \nproviders and the overall capacity for services, especially given the context in which this Act will \noperate.  In addition, the clinic closures that will result from the Act’s enforcement will have \nadditional,  acute  effects  for  several  significant  subgroups  of  women  of  reproductive  age  in \nLouisiana. \n101 \n \n\n387. There would be no physician in Louisiana providing abortions between 17 weeks and \n21 weeks, six days gestation.  Women seeking abortion at this stage of their pregnancies would be \ndenied all access to abortion in Louisiana and will be unable to exercise their constitutional right. \nSee supra, Part V.B. \n388. The heaviest burdens of Act 620 would fall disproportionately upon poor women.   To \nilluminate these burdens, the Court credits Dr. Sheila Katz, an Associate Professor of Sociology at \nthe University of Houston, as an expert in the sociology of gender and the sociology of poverty. \n(Doc. 191 at 110:11-114:12, 123:23-126:4.)  Dr. Katz’s academic scholarship is focused on \nqualitative research on low-income women’s lived experiences with poverty.   (Id. at 110:25-\n115:21.) \n   389. Louisiana is one of the poorest states in the country, with the nation’s third-highest \nlevels of overall and child poverty.  Twenty-six parishes are classified by the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture as persistently poor.  (Id. at 128:5-8, 130:14-131:3, 131:25-132:4, 133:8-136:3; JX 124 \n¶¶ 7, 9, 10; PX 166; PX 167.)  Approximately 230,000 Louisiana women of childbearing age live \nbelow the federal poverty line.  (Doc. 191 at 135:15-17.) \n390. Women who seek abortion in Louisiana come from all socioeconomic and ethnic \nbackgrounds (Doc. 190 at 18:17-23; Doc. 191 at 19:12-20:4) but are disproportionately poor. (Doc. \n191 at 191:23-192:9; JX 124 ¶¶ 8, 13, 14.) Approximately 42% of women having abortions in the \nU.S. in 2008 subsisted at or below the federal poverty line, and another 27% had incomes at or \nbelow 200% of the poverty line.  Given the high rate of poverty, in Louisiana these figures are \nlikely to be much higher.  Few women seeking an abortion in Louisiana have medical insurance \n102 \n \n\nthat covers the procedure. (Doc. 190 at 20:11-21:5.) In some instances, poor women must choose \nbetween paying for an abortion and paying for other basic necessities, such as rent.  (Id. at 18:17- \n19:14, 34:6-23, 89:9-14; Doc. 191 at 135: 5-14, 158:10-23; JX 116 ¶ 14.) Nearly 75% of women \nwho obtain abortions in Louisiana already have one or more children, which is higher than the \nnational average.  (Docs. 190 at 94:7-12; 191 at 152:20-153:2; JX 192 at 3.) \n391. The Court also finds that, with just one or two providers remaining, many more women \nwill be forced to travel significant distances to reach a clinic, which also imposes a substantial \nburden. \n392. Many Louisiana women have difficulty affording or arranging for transportation and \nchildcare on the days of their clinic visits, in addition to the challenge of affording the abortion \nitself.    (Doc. 190 at 18:17-19:14; Doc. 191 at 142:25-143:22, 145:19-146:1.)  Increased travel \ndistance to clinics exacerbates the difficulty of securing transportation.  (Doc. 191 at 20:17-24.)  \nThis will be particularly burdensome for women living in northern Louisiana, who will face \nsubstantially increased travel distances to reach an abortion provider in New Orleans, either because \nDoe 3 stops providing and Hope Clinic closes, or the clinic remains open with very limited capacity.  \nFor example, many or all women in Shreveport or Bossier City who once could access a clinic in \ntheir own area will now have to travel approximately 320 miles to New Orleans. \n393. Due to the 24-hour notification and waiting period, patients must make two trips to the \nclinic: the first to receive the ultrasound and state-mandated counseling and the second to obtain an \nabortion.  (JX 109 ¶ 19.)  Women who must travel increased distances to access abortion will in \nmany cases have to take at least two days off from work, which has financial costs if the time off is \n103 \n \n\nunpaid, as is often the case in low-wage jobs. (Doc. 191 at 149:18-50:3; JX 124 ¶ 30.) Many women \nare even at risk of losing their jobs for taking time off.  (Doc. 191 at 150:4-17; JX 124 ¶ 31.) \n394. Intercity travel for low-income women presents a number of significant hurdles, \nincluding the logistics and cost of transportation, the costs associated with time off from work, and \nchildcare costs.  (JX 124 ¶¶ 16, 17.)  Low-income women are likely to live in households that have \nno vehicles.  (Doc. 191 at 142:15-24; 146:2-10.)  Even under current law, patients frequently call \nto reschedule appointments due to transportation and childcare issues, thus delaying their access to \nabortion.  (Doc. 190 at 17:20-20:8.) \n395. Women who cannot afford to pay the costs associated with travel, childcare, and time \noff from work may have to make sacrifices in other areas like food or rent expenses, rely on \npredatory lenders, or borrow money from family members or abusive partners or ex-partners, \nsacrificing their financial and personal security.  (Doc. 191 at 158:10-159:23; JX 124 ¶¶ 37-38.)  \nTravel to a different city to seek a medical procedure also imposes significant socio-psychological \nhurdles on low income women.  (Doc. 191 at 160:16- 161:3; JX 124 ¶¶ 16, 17, 35.) \n   396. Based on all of the evidence, the Court makes the common-sense inference that those \nwomen who can access an abortion clinic will face lengthy delays, pushing them to later gestational \nages with associated increased risks.  Those who would be candidates for medication abortion \nwould have difficulty obtaining an appointment before that method becomes unavailable because \nof later gestational age; many women toward the end of the first trimester would have difficulty \nobtaining an appointment before they reach 16 weeks.  Women past 16 weeks LMP will be left \nwithout any provider at all.  As the Supreme Court has recognized, patients seeking services at \n104 \n \n\novertaxed facilities are “less likely to get the kind of individualized attention, serious conversation, \nand emotional support that doctors at less taxed facilities may have offered.”  WWH, 136 S. Ct. at \n2318.  Facilities “attempting to accommodate sudden, vastly increased demand . . . may find that \nquality of care declines.”  Id. (citation omitted).  Women have the right not to be forced to “travel \nlong distances to get abortions in crammed-to-capacity superfacilities,” “in the face of no threat to \n[their] health.”  Id. \n397. In short, Act 620 would do little or nothing for women’s health, but rather would create \nimpediments to abortion, with especially high barriers set before poor, rural, and disadvantaged \nwomen.  These burdens would have the effect on increasing health risks among the State’s poorer \nwomen. The burdens imposed by Act 620 on abortion outweigh the benefits, particularly given this \nCourt’s finding that the Act would do little, if anything, to promote women’s health. \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW  \nX.  Summary of Legal Arguments \n398. Both parties recognize the change to Fifth Circuit law brought by WWH, requiring a \nweighing of “the asserted benefits and burdens of the regulations in question.” (Doc. 256 at 45; \nDoc. 257-1 at 28.) Plaintiffs emphasize the benefits and minimize the burdens. Defendant does the \nopposite.  \n399. Specifically, Plaintiffs challenge Act 620 as unconstitutional as a violation of Casey \nand WWH. They argue that Act 620 imposes substantial obstacles to Louisiana women in accessing \nabortion, without offering any countervailing health benefits. Act 620 places an undue burden on a \nwoman’s right to choose abortion, they assert, because the admitting privileges requirement fails to \nconfer any health benefit, but has dramatic implications for the availability of abortion in the state. \n105 \n \n\nGiven this imbalance, Plaintiffs urge this Court to declare Act 620 unconstitutional in all of its \napplications and enter a permanent injunction against its enforcement. \n400. Defendant, on the other hand, argues that Plaintiffs have failed to establish that Act \n620 imposes an undue burden on women seeking abortion in Louisiana and argues that the benefits \nof the Act are significant. (Doc. 257-1 at 28-38.) Defendants urge the Court to find that Plaintiffs \nhave failed to show an undue burden and declare Act 620 constitutional. (Id. at 36.) The Court now \nconsiders the question in the light of the test as clarified in WWH.  \nXI.  Test for Determining the Constitutionality of Act 620 \n401. “[F]or more than 40 years, it has been settled constitutional law that the Fourteenth \nAmendment protects a woman’s basic right to choose an abortion.” Jackson Women’s Health Org. \nv. Currier, 760 F.3d 448, 453 (5th Cir. 2014) (citing Roe, 410 U.S. at 153).  A state may enact \nregulations “to foster the health of a woman seeking abortion” or “to further the State’s interest in \nfetal life,” provided that these regulations do not impose an “undue burden” on the woman’s \ndecision. Casey, 505 U.S. at 877-78 (plurality opinion).   “A finding of an undue burden is shorthand \nfor the conclusion that a state regulation has the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle \nin the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus.”  Id. at 877. \n402.  “[A] statute which, while furthering [a] valid state interest, has the effect of placing a \nsubstantial obstacle in the path of a woman’s choice cannot be considered a permissible means of \nserving its legitimate ends.”  Id.; WWH, 136 S. Ct. at 2309.  “Moreover, ‘[u]nnecessary health \nregulations that have the purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle in the path of a \nwoman seeking abortion impose an undue burden on the right.’” WWH, 136 S. Ct. at 2309 (quoting \nCasey, 505 U.S. at 878). \n106 \n \n\n403. “The rule announced in Casey . . . requires that courts consider the burdens a law \nimposes on abortion access together with the benefits those laws confer.”  WWH, 136 S. Ct. at 2309 \n(citing Casey, 505 U.S. at 887).   This balancing of benefits and burdens is central to addressing the \nquestion of whether “any burden imposed on abortion access is ‘undue.’”  Id. at 2310. \n404. When evaluating the constitutionality of laws regulating abortion and conducting this \nbalancing, courts may “place[] considerable weight upon evidence and argument presented in \njudicial proceedings,” rather than leaving questions of medical uncertainty to the legislature to \nresolve.  Id. at 2310.  The courts have an “independent constitutional duty to review factual findings \nwhere constitutional rights are at stake.” Id. (quoting Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124, 165 \n(2007)) (affirming that the district court correctly placed “significant weight” on the evidence in \nthe record, and properly “weighed the asserted benefits against the burdens,” in striking down \nTexas’s admitting privileges requirement). \n405. In assessing the burdens imposed by a restriction, courts must consider not only the \nimpact of the law with respect to closure of clinics and reduction in the number of available \nproviders in the state, but also the “additional burden[s]” imposed on women by reducing abortion \naccess, including longer wait times, increased crowding, and longer travel distances. Id. at 2313. \nAdditionally, “[c]ourts are free to base their findings on commonsense inferences drawn from the \nevidence.”  Id. at 2317 (accepting the district court’s “commonsense inference” that closing four- \nfifths of the abortion clinics in a state would render the remaining fifth unable to meet demand). \n406. In WWH, for example, the Supreme Court evaluated the constitutionality of Texas’s \nadmitting privileges restriction by carefully reviewing the evidence in the record and the District \nCourt’s findings on its benefits and burdens. The Court noted that prior to passage of the admitting \n107 \n \n\nprivileges requirement, abortion clinics in Texas were already required “to meet a host of health \nand safety requirements,” id. at 2314, and concluded that “[w]e have found nothing in Texas’ record \nevidence that shows that, compared to prior law (which, required a ‘working arrangement’ with a \ndoctor with admitting privileges), the new law advanced Texas’ legitimate interest in protecting \nwomen’s health.”  Id. at 2311. \n407.  Turning  to  the  burdens,  the  Supreme  Court  clarified  that  no  single  factor  is \ndeterminative as to whether a restriction imposes an undue burden, but rather the burdens’ impact \nmust be evaluated cumulatively, and are undue if unjustified by the law’s purported benefits; it \nexplained: \nIn our view, the record contains sufficient evidence that the admitting-privileges \nrequirement led to the closure of half of Texas’ clinics, or thereabouts.  Those \nclosures meant fewer doctors, longer waiting times, and increased crowding. Record \nevidence also supports the finding that after the admitting-privileges provision went \ninto effect, the “number of women of reproductive age living in a county . . . more \nthan 150 miles from a provider increased from approximately 86,000 to 400,000 . . \n. and the number of women living in a county more than 200 miles from a provider \nfrom approximately 10,000 to 290,000.”  We recognize that increased driving \ndistances do not always constitute an “undue burden.”  But here, those increases are \nbut one additional burden, which, when taken together with others that the closings \nbrought about, and when viewed in light of the virtual absence of any health benefit, \nlead us to conclude that the record adequately supports the District Court’s “undue \nburden” conclusion. \n \nId. at 2313 (citations omitted). \n408. The Court concluded that Texas’s admitting privileges requirement (alone and in \ncombination with another challenged law requiring abortion clinics to comply with regulations \napplicable to ambulatory surgical facilities) “vastly increase[d] the obstacles confronting women \nseeking abortions in Texas” in a variety of ways.  Id. at 2319.  The requirement decreased the \nnumber and geographic locations of legal abortion providers, thereby increasing the distances that \n108 \n \n\nwomen would need to travel to access care, delaying that care, forcing women to seek care in \nfacilities that are overtaxed and pushed beyond their capacity, and preventing some women from \naccessing abortion care at all. See id. at 2313, 2315-18. Because these burdens vastly outweighed \nthe “virtual absence” of any benefits, the Court held both requirements unconstitutional under \nCasey.  See id. at 2313. \nXII.  Analysis \n409. In light of WWH, the Court has made additional findings of fact.   Under the Supreme \nCourt’s current guidance, this Court has found that Act 620 confers only minimal, at best, health \nbenefits for women seeking abortions, and that enforcement of the Act will increase the risk of \nharm to women’s health.  See supra at Parts VII.C, X. \n410. Having now weighed the evidence of the substantial burdens imposed by Act 620, and \ntheir cumulative impact on abortion services in the state, as well as the evidence regarding the Act’s \nlack of any significant health benefits, the Court again finds that Act 620 places an unconstitutional \nundue burden on women seeking abortion in Louisiana.   \nA.  Act 620 Does Not Protect Women’s Health \n411. Based on the evidence admitted to the record, the facts found herein, and all reasonable \ninferences drawn from those facts, the Court concludes that the admitting privileges requirement \ndoes provides no significant health benefits to women. As in WWH, Defendant has presented no \ncredible evidence showing that, compared to prior law, Act 620 advances the state’s interest in \nprotecting women’s health and safety.  WWH, 136 S. Ct. at 2311. \n109 \n \n\n412. As explained supra, Part V.B, abortion in the state of Louisiana is safe, with extremely \nlow rates of complication.54 \n413. As the Supreme Court explained with regard to the nearly-identical Texas statute, there \n“was no significant health-related problem that the new law helped to cure.”  WWH, 136 S. Ct. at \n2311.  The record does not contain any evidence that complications from abortion were being \ntreated improperly, nor any evidence that any negative outcomes could have been avoided if the \nabortion provider had admitting privileges at a local hospital. \n414. In short, this Court concludes that Act 620 will not further the State’s asserted interest \nin the health of women seeking abortions as admitting privileges do not improve health outcomes \nin the event of complications.  This conclusion is consistent with the Supreme Court’s conclusion \nin WWH and the conclusions of other federal district courts that have considered the health benefits \nof similar admitting privileges laws.  WWH, 136 S. Ct. 2311-12 (citing Planned Parenthood of Wis., \nInc. v. Van Hollen (“Van Hollen”), 94 F. Supp. 3d 949, 953 (W.D. Wis. 2015), aff'd sub nom. \nPlanned Parenthood of Wis., Inc. v. Schimel (“Schimel”), 806 F.3d 908 (7th Cir. 2015), cert. denied, \n136 S. Ct. 3545 (2016); Planned Parenthood Se., Inc. v. Strange (“Strange”), 33 F. Supp. 3d 1330, \n1378 (M.D. Ala. 2014).). \n415. Admitting privileges also do not serve “any relevant credentialing function,” WWH, \n136 S. Ct. at 2313, see supra Part V.D. The Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners ensures \nphysician competency through licensing and discipline.  Hospitals grant privileges to physicians to \npromote the smooth functioning of the hospital, or to serve other goals or priorities of the particular \n                                                 \n54 There is broad consensus for this proposition among federal courts analyzing admitting privileges restrictions.  See \nWWH, 136 S. Ct. at 2311-12; Planned Parenthood of Wis., Inc. v. Van Hollen, 94 F. Supp. 3d 949, 953 (W.D. Wis. \n2015), aff'd sub nom. Planned Parenthood of Wis., Inc. v. Schimel, 806 F.3d 908 (7th Cir. 2015), cert. denied, 136 S. \nCt. 3545 (2016); Planned Parenthood Se., Inc. v. Strange, 33 F. Supp. 3d 1330, 1378 (M.D. Ala. 2014). \n110 \n \n\nhospital.   As the record in this case demonstrates, physicians are sometimes denied privileges, \nexplicitly or de facto, for reasons unrelated to competency. \n416. In summary, the record in this case demonstrates that Act 620 does not advance \nLouisiana’s legitimate interest in protecting the health of women seeking abortions.  Instead, Act \n620 would increase the risk of harm to women’s health by dramatically reducing the availability of \nsafe abortion in Louisiana. See supra Parts IX. Under WWH and in light of the medical evidence in \nthe record in this case, the Court holds that Act 620 is not medically necessary and fails to actually \nfurther women’s health and safety. While the Court is able to reach this conclusion based on the \nmedical evidence alone, the findings of fact related to the legislative history of the Act, and the \ncircumstances of its passage, see supra Parts VI.D, VII, provide additional support.  \nB.  The Burdens Imposed by Act 620 \n417. Turning to the burdens imposed by Act 620, the Court finds that the Act places \nsubstantial obstacles in the path of a woman’s choice to seek an abortion.  Act 620 will result in a \ndrastic reduction in the number and geographic distribution of abortion providers, reducing the \nnumber of clinics to one, or at most two, and leaving only one, or at most two, physicians providing \nabortions in the entire state.  See supra Part IX.  \n418. Currently, about 10,000 women per year seek abortions in the state. Plaintiffs have \nshown that, should the Act take effect, there will be just one physician left, Dr. John Doe 5, \nproviding abortions in the state.  Working four to five days per week, he is able to provide fewer \nthan 3,000 abortions per year.  Even working an implausible seven-day week, it would be \nimpossible for him to expand his practice to meet even half the state’s need for abortion services. \n111 \n \n\n419. Even if Doe 3 continued to provide at Hope in Shreveport—which is not consistent \nwith this Court’s factual findings that Doe 3 is unlikely to continue to provide, and in any event the \nloss of Doe 1 would likely not allow his clinic to remain open—the demand for services would \nvastly exceed the supply. \n420. Viewing all of the evidence together, the Court concludes that the remaining abortion \nproviders—whether one facility or two—would not be able to meet the demand for abortion \nservices in Louisiana. If allowed to take effect, Act 620 would therefore cripple women’s ability to \nhave an abortion in Louisiana. \n421.  In  addition  to  these  practical  concerns  and  difficulties  of  increased  risk  of \ncomplications caused by delays in care, the reduction in availability of abortion would lead to an \nincrease in self-performed, unlicensed and unsafe abortions. (Doc. 190 at 223–24.) \n422. For these reasons, the Court concludes that Act 620 would have a negative impact on \nwomen’s health. \n423. Act 620 would also substantially increase the burden on women who are able to receive \nlicensed, safe abortions.  As discussed supra in Part IX, many women will have to travel much \nlonger distances to reach the few providers who will continue to provide abortions, and that travel \nwill impose severe burdens, which will fall most heavily on low-income women. \n424. The result of these burdens on women and providers, taken together and in context, is \nthat many women seeking a safe, legal abortion in Louisiana will be unable to obtain one. Those \nwho can will face substantial obstacles in exercising their constitutional right to choose abortion \ndue to the dramatic reduction in abortion services. \n \n112 \n \n\nC.  The Burdens Imposed by Act 620 Vastly Outweigh its Benefits \n425. WWH “requires that courts consider the burdens a law imposes on abortion access \ntogether with the benefits those laws confer.”  WWH, 136 S. Ct. at 2309 (citing Casey, 505 U.S., at \n887-898).  The record is devoid of any credible evidence that the Act will have a measurable benefit \nto women’s health, but it is clear that the Act will drastically burden women’s right to choose \nabortion.  The Supreme Court found that “when taken together . . . , and when viewed in light of \nthe virtual absence of any health benefit,” the burden created by the nearly-identical Texas \nadmitting privileges requirement was undue.  WWH, 136 S. Ct. at 2313.  As in WWH, Act 620 “does \nnot benefit patients and is not necessary.”  Id. at 2315.  Even if Act 620 could be said to further \nwomen’s health to some marginal degree, the burdens it imposes far outweigh any such benefit, \nand thus the Act imposes an unconstitutional undue burden. \n426. This result is consistent with the decision in WWH as well as other decisions addressing \nsimilar or identical admitting privileges requirements.55 Indeed, there is no legally significant \ndistinction between this case and WWH: Act 620 was modeled after the Texas admitting privileges \nrequirement, and it functions in the same manner, imposing significant obstacles to abortion access \nwith no countervailing benefits. The Court is bound by the Supreme Court’s clear guidance to reach \nthe same result and strike down the Act. \nXIII.  Conclusion \n 427. “The party seeking a permanent injunction must . . . establish (1) success on the merits; \n(2) that a failure to grant the injunction will result in irreparable injury; (3) that said injury outweighs \nany damage that the injunction will cause the opposing party; and (4) that the injunction will not \n                                                 \n55 WWH, 136 S. Ct. at 2313; Van Hollen, 94 F.Supp.3d 949; Strange, 33 F.Supp.3d 1330. \n113 \n \n\ndisserve the public interest.”  VRC LLC v. City of Dallas, 460 F.3d 607, 611 (5th Cir. 2006) \n(citations omitted). \n428. For the reasons outlined above, the Court finds that Act 620 is unconstitutional on its \nface under Casey and WWH.  The Act would create substantial obstacles for women seeking \nabortion in Louisiana without providing any demonstrated benefit to women’s health or safety.  Any \nmarginal health benefits would be dramatically outweighed by the obstacles the restriction erects \nto women’s access to their constitutional right to abortion. The Act therefore cannot withstand the \nscrutiny mandated by WWH.  Plaintiffs have succeeded on the merits of their constitutional claim \nthat the Act violates the Fourteenth Amendment. \n429. Given that the Act violates women’s constitutional right to abortion, Plaintiffs have \nestablished that irreparable injury will result in the absence of an injunction barring its enforcement.  \nSee Deerfield Med. Ctr. v. Deerfield Beach, 661 F.2d 328, 338 (5th Cir. 1981) (finding that the \nconclusion that the right to abortion is “‘either threatened or in fact being impaired’ . . . mandates \na finding of irreparable injury”) (quoting Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976)). Further, some \nwomen’s total inability to access abortion care, and unreasonable and dangerous delays experienced \nby others in scheduling an abortion procedure, will constitute irreparable harm for Louisiana \nwomen seeking abortions.  See Jackson Women’s Health Org. v. Currier, 940 F. Supp. 2d 416, 424 \n(S.D. Miss. 2013) (finding that closure of the State’s only clinic constitutes irreparable harm), aff’d, \n760 F.3d 448 (5th Cir. 2014) cert. denied, 136 S. Ct. 2536 (2016). Many women will also face \nirreparable harms from the burdens associated with increased travel distances and costs in reaching \nan abortion clinic.  See WWH, 136 S. Ct. at 2313.  These harms outweigh any damage to the State \nby the entry of an injunction. \n114 \n \n\n430. Given the substantial injury threatened by enforcement of the Act, a permanent \ninjunction will serve the public interest.  See Currier, 940 F. Supp. 2d at 424 (“[T]he grant of an \ninjunction will not disserve the public interest, an element that is generally met when an injunction \nis designed to avoid constitutional deprivations.”); see also Nobby Lobby, Inc. v. Dallas, 970 F.2d \n82, 93 (5th Cir. 1992) (“the public interest always is served when public officials act within the \nbounds of the law and respect the rights of the citizens they serve”) (citation omitted).  The Court \nwill therefore enter an order permanently enjoining the enforcement of the Act. \n431. An order permanently enjoining enforcement of Act 620 in all of its applications is the \nappropriate remedy.  As with the Texas abortion restrictions enjoined in all their applications by \nthe decision in WWH, Act 620 would close most of the abortion facilities in Louisiana and “place \nadded stress on those facilities able to remain open.”  WWH, 136 S. Ct. at 2319.  Act 620 “vastly \nincrease[s] the obstacles confronting women seeking abortions” in Louisiana “without providing \nany benefit to women’s health capable of withstanding any meaningful scrutiny.”  Id.  Therefore, \nAct 620 is unconstitutional on its face. Pursuant to this Court’s authority under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 \nand 2202, and Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, this Court will enter orders \ndeclaring Act 620 unconstitutional and permanently enjoining the Act in all of its applications. \nIn  light  of  the  foregoing  findings  of  fact  and  conclusions  of  law,  IT  IS  HEREBY \nORDERED THAT: \n1.  The active admitting privileges requirement of La. R.S. § 40:1299.35.2 (Act 620) is DECLARED \nunconstitutional as a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; \n2.   A PERMANENT INJUNCTION is ENTERED barring enforcement of La. R.S.  §40:1299.35.2 \n(Act 620); \n115 \n \n\n3.      Any  implementing  regulations  of  Act  620,  including  La.  Admin.  Code  tit.  48,  pt.  I, \n§4423(B)(3)(e) and La. Admin. Code tit. 48, pt. I, 4401 (definition of “active admitting privileges”), \nare,  for  the  foregoing  reasons,  likewise  DECLARED  UNCONSTITUTIONAL  and \nPERMANENTLY ENJOINED. \n4.   Judgment shall be entered in favor of the Plaintiffs and against the Defendant by separate \ndocument in conformity with Rule 58. \nSigned in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on April 26, 2017. \n \n \n \n   S \nJUDGE JOHN W. deGRAVELLES \n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nMIDDLE DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA \n116 \n ",

CIVIL ACTION \n \n                  NO. 14-525-JWD-RLB \nVERSUS                   \n                   \nCOURTNEY PHILLIPS, in her official capacity as \nSecretary of the Louisiana Department of Health \n \nORDER \n \n  Before the Court is the Motion to Maintain Documents Under Seal filed by Plaintiffs, \nJune Medical Services, LLC, et al. (R. Doc. 344). The Motion is Opposed. (R. Doc. 350). \nPlaintiffs have filed a Reply. (R. Doc. 360). Also before the Court is a related Motion to \nIntervene and Oppose filed by certain Movant-Intervenors. (R. Doc. 349). That Motion is also \nOpposed (R. Doc. 365) and Movant-Intervenors have been granted leave of Court to file a Reply \n(R. Doc. 379). For the reasons set forth herein, the Court will grant the Motion to Intervene and \nOppose (R. Doc. 349), and grant in part and deny in part Plaintiffs’ Motion to Maintain \nDocuments Under Seal (R. Doc. 344).  \nI.  Background \nPlaintiffs initiated this action with the filing of their Complaint for Declaratory and \nInjunctive Relief (R. Doc. 1) on August 22, 2014. Plaintiffs immediately sought the issuance of a \nprotective order, which request was opposed by Defendants. (R. Docs. 4, 19, 23). After review of \nthe law and arguments, the Court issued an Order granting Plaintiffs’ request, specifically \npermitting the Plaintiff physicians to proceed under pseudonym. (R. Doc. 24). A similar Order \nwas issued permitting two additional Plaintiff physicians in the consolidated action to proceed \nunder pseudonym. (R. Doc. 55). Thereafter, on November 6, 2014, the Court issued an Order (R. \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 397    01/28/21   Page 2 of 28\nDoc. 59) granting the Parties’ Joint Motion for Protective Order, which contained a further \nstipulation permitting the Plaintiff physicians to proceed under pseudonym, and outlined the \nterms of stipulated protections agreed to by the parties governing documents and information \nobtained throughout the course of the litigation. Specifically relevant to this instant Order, the \nparties to the Stipulated Protective Order agreed that “[u]nless a court orders otherwise, the \nparties and their counsel shall maintain the confidentiality of all Confidential information after \nfinal disposition of this litigation, by adjudication (including appeals) or otherwise.” (R. Doc. 59 \nat 8). \nProceeding through trial at the district court, the district judge issued an Order (R. Doc. \n161) granting a Joint Consent Motion Regarding Confidential Trial Procedures, preserving the \nconfidentiality of certain documents and exhibits through trial, as well as preserving the \nanonymity of the Plaintiff physicians. This litigation then proceeded through the courts, \nculminating with a decision issued by the United States Supreme Court on June 29, 2020. See \nJune Medical Servs., LLC, et al. v. Russo, 140 S.Ct. 2103 (2020).  \nII.  Law and Analysis \na.  Motion to Intervene \nBefore addressing the propriety of maintaining any documents or information under seal, \nthe Court must first address the request to intervene. (R. Doc. 349). The parties seeking \nintervention are a group of Louisiana legislators, journalists, and legal academics, who request \npermission to appear and oppose Plaintiffs’ Motion to Maintain. (R. Doc. 349-1 at 1). For the \nfollowing reasons, the Motion to Intervene (R. Doc. 349) will be granted, and the Intervenors \nwill be permitted to intervene for the limited purpose of appearing and asserting argument \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 397    01/28/21   Page 3 of 28\npertaining to Plaintiffs’ Motion to Maintain, without right to additional discovery or appearance \npertaining to any other matter, including any fee disputes between Plaintiffs and Defendant.  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 24 governs both intervention of right as well as permissive intervention. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2) requires a court to permit anyone to intervene who “claims an interest \nrelating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action, and is so situated that \ndisposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the movant’s ability to protect \nits interest, unless existing parties adequately represent that interest.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(1)(B) \nallows anyone to intervene who “has a claim or defense that share with the main action a \ncommon question of law and fact.” Additionally, “[w]hether leave to intervene is sought under \nsection (a) or (b) of Rule 24, the application must be timely.” Stallworth v. Monsanto Co., 558 \nF.2d 257, 263 (5th Cir. 1977). “The timeliness of a motion to intervene is a matter committed to \nthe sound discretion of the trial court.” Terrebonne Parish Branch NAACP v. Jindal, 2016 WL \n2743525, at *2 (M.D. La. May 11, 2016) (citing McDonald v. E.J. Lavino, 430 F.2d 1065, 1071 \n(5th Cir. 1977)). As noted in Terrebonne, the Fifth Circuit has set forth the following four factors \nto consider when evaluating whether a motion to intervene is timely: (1) the length of time \nduring which the proposed intervenors should have known of their interest in the case before \nthey petitioned to intervene; (2) the extent of prejudice that those parties already in the litigation \nwould suffer “as a result of the would-be intervenor’s failure to apply for intervention as soon as \nhe actually knew or reasonably should have known of his interest in the case;” (3) the extent of \nprejudice to the proposed intervenors if they are not allowed to intervene; and (4) the existence \nof “unusual circumstances militating either for or against a determination that the application is \ntimely.” 2016 WL 2743525 at *2 (citing Ross v. Marshall, 426 F.3d 745, 754 (5th Cir. 2005)).  \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 397    01/28/21   Page 4 of 28\nHere, the Court finds Intervenors’ request to intervene timely, and the remaining factors \nweigh in favor of granting intervention, with the limitation that Intervenors’ appearance is \nlimited to the issues surrounding continued confidentiality of documents and information, and \nIntervenors are not entitled to appear with regard to the remaining fee dispute nor are they \nentitled to seek any additional discovery.  \nThe first factor pertaining to timeliness—the length of time during which the proposed \nintervenors should have known of their interest in the case before they petitioned to intervene—\nweighs in favor of finding Intervenors’ request timely. Plaintiffs argue that Intervenors knew of \nthis litigation from its inception in 2014 and failed to seek intervention at any point until after \nfinal disposition. Timeliness, however, “is not limited to chronological considerations but ‘is to \nbe determined from all the circumstances.’” Stallworth v. Monsanto Co., 558 F.2d 257, 263 (5th \nCir. 1977). Under the circumstances of this case, the Court finds that inception of the litigation is \nnot the appropriate starting point. Instead, the relevant starting point for purposes of timeliness is \nthe point at which this case was resolved. The interests of journalists, academics, and legislators \nmay exist during the pendency of the litigation, but is separate and distinct from those interests \nupon final disposition, particularly with regard to the legislators who desire access for the \npurpose of attempting to craft new legislation that would withstand Constitutional muster. Said \ninterest does not arise unless and until a final finding of the unconstitutionality of the challenged \nlegislation. Sierra Club v. Espy, 18 F.3d 1202, 1206 (5th Cir. 1994) (“A better gauge of \npromptness is the speed with which the would-be intervenor acted when it became aware that its \ninterests would no longer be protected by the original parties.”) (citing Stallworth, 558 F.2d at \n264).  \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 397    01/28/21   Page 5 of 28\nThe second factor also weighs in favor of finding Intervenors’ request timely. This action \nwas administratively closed by the Fifth Circuit on August 6, 2020, in light of the opinion and \njudgment of the United States Supreme Court. (R. Doc. 336). Pursuant to General Order 2019-4, \nconfidential portions of the record were to remain sealed for thirty days, and Plaintiffs moved to \nextend the sealing of confidential information on September 4, 2020. (R. Doc. 344). Twenty-one \ndays later, on September 25, 2020, Intervenors sought intervention to represent their asserted \ninterests in opposition to Plaintiffs’ request to extend the seal. (R. Doc. 349). Defendant’s \nOpposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion was also filed on September 25, 2020. (R. Doc. 350). In the \nsame sense that Intervenors’ request was made within a reasonable length of time during which \nthey should have known of their interest, Plaintiffs are not prejudiced by a timely filed request to \nintervene coupled with their opposition. That Intervenors may assert interests that ultimately tip \nthe scales against Plaintiffs, or that Plaintiffs may find it necessary to address arguments \ndifferent from those presented by Defendant, does not rise to a finding of prejudice.  \nConversely, to prohibit Intervenors’ intervention would be tantamount to a substantive \ndismissal of their asserted interests without meaningful review. Accordingly, the third factor—\nprejudice to the proposed intervenors—also weighs in favor of granting intervention for the \nlimited purpose of advancing argument pertaining to the continued confidentiality of documents \nand information.  \nThe Court finds no significant unusual circumstances militating for or against \nintervention but will again note that the interests asserted by Intervenors are separate and distinct \nfrom that of Plaintiffs and Defendant. That Intervenors’ ultimate position aligns more closely \nwith that of Defendant is of no matter, and the Court would find intervention proper were their \nultimate recommendation the same as that of Plaintiffs.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 397    01/28/21   Page 6 of 28\nThe public’s right to access judicial records is “a precious common law right, one that \npredates the Constitution.” Nixon v. Warner Commc’ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 612 (1978) \n(Marshall, J., dissenting) (citation omitted). Further, in exercising discretion to seal judicial \nrecords, which is the substantive issue at hand, the Court seeks to balance the public’s right of \naccess against the interests favoring nondisclosure. S.E.C. v. Van Waeyenberghe, 990 F.2d 845, \n848 (5th Cir. 1993) (citing Nixon, 435 U.S. at 599, 602). The public’s right to access judicial \nrecords is not absolute, but given such a right, to deny intervention would be inappropriate. \nIntervenors seek to assert and protect the public’s general right to access judicial records, an \nessential interest that is not currently represented, and therefore, intervention is justified and \nappropriate. The Motion to Intervene (R. Doc. 349) is GRANTED.  \nb.  Motion to Maintain  \nPlaintiffs seek to maintain certain documents and information under the seal following \nthe final resolution of the substantive issues in this litigation by the Supreme Court. More \nspecifically, Plaintiffs request the following information remain under seal, providing a \ndemonstrative chart reflecting the electronic docket reference along with the following \nsupporting classifications: (1) the identity or other identifying information of the Plaintiff \nabortion providers (“Plaintiff physicians”); (2) purportedly sensitive business information; (3) \nidentity of non-party healthcare provider(s); and (4) confidential clinic information. (R. Doc. \n344-3). \nAs a starting point, “[i]t is clear that the courts of this country recognize a general right to \ninspect and copy public records and documents, including judicial records and documents.” \nNixon, 435 U.S. at 597. However, “the right to inspect and copy judicial records is not absolute,” \nand “[e]very court has supervisory power over its own records and files.” Nixon, 435 U.S. at 598. \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 397    01/28/21   Page 7 of 28\nSee also Vantage Health Plan, Inc. v. Willis-Knighton Med. Ctro., 913 F.3d 443, 450-51 (5th Cir. \n2019) (“The decision whether to allow public access to court records ‘is one best left to the \nsound discretion of the trial court, a discretion to be exercised in light of the relevant facts and \ncircumstances of the particular case.’” (internal citations omitted)). As noted in Bradley on \nbehalf of AJW v. Ackal, 954 F.3d 216, 225 (5th Cir. 2020), “[t]his circuit has not assigned \nparticular weight to the presumption [of public access to judicial records]… Nor has this court \ninterpreted the presumption in favor of access as creating a burden of proof.”  \nPursuant to General Order 2019-4, thirty days after final disposition of an action, “all \nsealed pleadings and other papers shall be placed in the case record unless a District Judge or \nMagistrate Judge, upon motion and for good cause shown, orders that the pleading or other paper \nbe maintained under seal.” As such, the Court’s general order puts the onus on the party seeking \nto maintain such items under seal to make an appropriate showing. This is consistent with similar \ntreatment in our sister districts1 and also consistent with the Fifth Circuit’s admonition that “[i]n \nany case, “[t]he district court’s discretion to seal the record of judicial proceedings is to be \nexercised charily.” Bradley, 954 F.3d at 225 (citing cases). \nThe balance of considerations that justified the sealing of certain documents and \ninformation during the pendency of this litigation is not the same as applied upon final \ndisposition. Thus, it is prudent to re-assess those considerations upon final disposition when a \nparty makes a timely motion requesting continued, essentially permanent sealing of court records \nfrom the public eye.  \n \n1 See, e.g., Ruby Slipper Café, LLC v. Belou, 2020 WL 4897905, at *6 (E.D. La. Jan. 8, 2020); Select \nInterior Concepts, Inc. v. Pental, 2020 WL 2132575, at *3 (N.D. Tex. May 5, 2020); Bankhead v. Gregg \nCty., 2013 WL 124114, at *2 (E.D. Tex. Jan. 9, 2013); Torres-Montalvo v. Keith, 2011 WL 5023271, at \n*2 (S.D. Tex. Oct. 17, 2011). \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 397    01/28/21   Page 8 of 28\nUpon review, the Court notes the following docket entries, with and without exhibits or \nattachments, remain sealed: R. Docs. 63, 93, 94, 101-105, 109, 112, 113, 117-120, 168, 170, 175, \n176, 180, 182-189, 197, 198, 200, 203, 205, 211, 237, 257, 261, 262, 351, 366, 378, 379, 380, \n387-390. The Court will address the propriety of continued confidentiality in sections that \nfollow, noting explicitly that reference to a main document in an entry herein does not purport to \ninclude attachments unless specifically noted. For example, were the Court to rule that R. Doc. \nABC should be unsealed, that finding is inapplicable to attached R. Docs. ABC-1 and ABC-2 \nunless also explicitly stated. \nAs an initial matter, Plaintiffs’ purported reliance on the existing Protective Orders, \nincluding any argument that documents or information was divulged in this litigation in reliance \nthat such information would remain confidential forever, is misplaced, as is Plaintiffs’ reliance \non any initial finding of good cause to seal information for the duration of this litigation. As \nnoted previously, the weight of the various interests changes upon final disposition of a litigation \nsuch that considerations and balancing of those interests should be addressed anew where a party \nrequests continued sealing after final disposition in contravention of the ordinary practice of \nunsealing same. General Order 2019-4, which provides the default for unsealing documents and \ninformation upon the passing of thirty days after final disposition of a litigation, is a public order \nto which Plaintiffs and their counsel practicing in federal court are presumed to be aware. \nContinued sealing past the thirty days provided for in General Order 2019-4 is a separate inquiry.  \n1.  Plaintiffs do not Request Continued Confidentiality \nPlaintiffs accompany their Motion to Maintain with a demonstrative chart marked \n“Exhibit A,” representing those documents over which Plaintiffs request continued sealing. (R. \nDocs. 344-1 at 1, 344-3). Not all of the documents currently under seal appear on Plaintiffs’ \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 397    01/28/21   Page 9 of 28\nExhibit A such that it can be reasonably inferred from this document that continued \nconfidentiality is not requested as to those documents not listed. Given the default rule of public \naccess, and Plaintiffs’ burden of establishing good cause to maintain documents under seal, \nwhere Plaintiffs do not request a document to remain under seal, the Court will lift the seal \nwithout further discussion. Accordingly, the following documents shall no longer be maintained \nunder seal: R. Docs. 101, 103, 105, 109, 109-1, 109-2, 112, 112-1, 112-2, 112-3, 112-4, 112-5, \n113, 113-1, 113-2, 113-3, 113-4, 113-5, 113-6, 113-7, 113-8, 117, 118, 118-1, 118-2, 118-3, 119, \n120, 120-1, 120-2, 120-3, 120-4, 120-5, 120-6, 175, 183, 211, 261.2  \n2.  Documents without Confidential Information \nIn addition to the documents listed above, for which Plaintiffs do not request continued \nsealing beyond final disposition, the Court notes that a number of documents filed under seal \ncontain no information Plaintiffs contend might be subject to further sealing (though certain \nattachments may). Documents that do not contain any confidential information, including the \nidentity or identifying information of abortion providers, their staff or clinic staff, the identity or \nidentifying information of patients, the identity or identifying information of third party \nproviders, or any purportedly sensitive business information or confidential clinic information, \ndo not justify continued sealing. This includes, but is not necessarily limited to, orders of this \nCourt as well as the district court that simply grant or deny a motion without discussion. Based \non the Court’s review, these documents shall be made public, and are as follows: R. Docs. 93, \n \n2 The Court notes that certain documents were filed under seal after the filing of Plaintiffs’ Motion to \nMaintain. The validity of continued sealing separately of those documents will be addressed in a \nsubsequent section as necessary. (See, e.g., R. Docs. 351, 366, 378, 379, 380, and 387-390, along with \nattachments).  \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 397    01/28/21   Page 10 of 28\n94, 168, 168-1, 168-2,3 168-3, 170, 180, 197, 198, 203, 257, 351, 351-1, 351-2, 366, 366-1, 380, \n380-3, 387, 387-1, 388, 390.4 The Court then turns to the substantive categories of documents \nover which Plaintiffs request continued sealing.  \n3.  Identity of Plaintiff Physicians and Non-Party Healthcare Providers \nThis Court permitted the Plaintiff physicians to proceed under pseudonym for the \nduration of this litigation. In so doing, the Court noted after reviewing the arguments and \ninformation provided that “the potential for harassment, intimidation and violence in this case, \nparticularly in light of the past and present instances of such conduct both nationwide and in \nLouisiana, justifies the unusual and rare remedy of allowing the individual Plaintiffs to proceed \nanonymously.” (R. Doc. 24 at 2). Those concerns underlying the Court’s August 28, 2014 \nfinding have not necessarily disappeared, but must be re-assessed now that the litigation has been \nresolved, and in consideration of the arguments and information presented to date.  \nPlaintiffs argue continued sealing of the identity of the Plaintiff physicians is warranted \nfor two reasons. First, Plaintiffs cite various news sources and argue that the “threats to the safety \nof these physicians, their families, and co-workers have not gone away.” (R. Doc. 344-1 at 8). \nSecond, Plaintiffs argue that abortion providers in other, currently pending proceedings were \ngranted pseudonymous protection such that, to the extent they may be parties in this case, the \nunsealing of their identities herein would “effectively ‘out’ their participation in those \nproceedings as well.” (R. Doc. 344-1 at 8).  \n \n3 The deposition testimony of certain witnesses are identified by name. Those witnesses and their \ntestimony is specifically referenced in the district judge’s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. (R. \nDoc. 274).  \n4 Certain documents that do not contain confidential information were not asked to remain sealed. Those \nare not referenced in this section but the same reasoning would apply. At the same time, some documents \nand/or attachments may be referenced in more than one section, as the considerations for unsealing or \ncontinued sealing may be applicable on numerous grounds. \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 397    01/28/21   Page 11 of 28\nDefendant’s position is that the identity of the Plaintiff physicians should be unsealed for \nvarious reasons including assertions that at least some of their identities as abortion providers are \nalready known and available to the public, they have failed to show any specific, current threat to \ntheir safety, and that they have waived any privacy concerns through selective revelation of their \nidentities as abortion providers to reporters. (R. Doc. 350 at 16-19). Intervenors echo \nDefendant’s argument, asserting that “several aspects of these identities are already known,” and \nthat Plaintiffs have failed to establish good cause for the continued sealing of their identities. (R. \nDoc. 349-1 at 20-22).  \nThat the identity of some or all of the Plaintiff physicians is publicly available does not \nend the inquiry. Identifying the Plaintiff physicians as abortion providers may add very little to \nthe public’s existing knowledge. It would, however, confirm their participation in this particular \nlitigation as well as in other, still pending matters.5 Thus, the balance of interests turns on two \nconsiderations: the significance of their identities in this litigation, i.e., whether continued sealing \nof their identities would hinder the public’s meaningful access, and their anonymity in other, \ncurrently pending abortion-related litigation.  \nThe Court notes that certain plaintiff-physicians in the case of June Medical Services \nLLC, et al. v. Gee, et al., Case No. 3:16-cv-444-BAJ-RLB, were permitted to proceed using \npseudonyms. Upon challenge to the protective order in that related action, the district court \nacknowledged “the potential harm that may result to the non-Doe doctors, should their names be \npublicized,” and noted that “[m]ost troubling, Defendants have alleged that searching for the \nnames of the non-Doe Doctors, it was discovered that their names appeared on websites that \n \n5 Plaintiffs correctly distinguish between the public’s ability to learn the identity of an abortion provider \nversus the unsealing and confirmation of such individual’s involvement as a plaintiff in this case. (R. Doc. \n344-1 at 6).  \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 397    01/28/21   Page 12 of 28\nPlaintiffs identified as being potentially linked with groups that advocate violence against \nabortion providers and clinics.” Id. at ECF 265 at 6. The district court in that litigation has not \nchanged the determination that good cause exists to allow the Protective Orders to stand, \nincluding the genuine need to protect the identities of the abortion providers. \nPlaintiffs also direct the Court’s attention to information and media reports of continuing, \nand in some instances increasing, threats of violence against abortion providers that would \ncompromise their safety as well as the safety of their families. (R. Doc. 344-1 at 8). The district \ncourt in the aforementioned litigation noted that certain physicians’ “names appeared on websites \nthat Plaintiffs identified as being potentially linked with groups that advocate violence against \nabortion providers and clinics.” June Medical, Case No. 16-cv-444-BAJ-RLB, ECF No. 265 at 6. \nFurther, the district court recognized the concerns of Plaintiff physicians at several points in its \nFindings of Fact. For example, the district court stated, “[t]he evidence is overwhelming that in \nLouisiana, abortion providers, the clinics where they work and the staff of these clinics, are \nsubjected to violence, threats of violence, harassment and danger... Defendant offered no \nevidence to counter Plaintiffs’ evidence on this point.” (R. Doc. 274 at 41-42). “[T]here is a \nmountain of un-contradicted and un-objected to evidence supporting this conclusion.” (R. Doc. \n274 at 42). See also R. Doc. 274 at 43 (“The evidence, in turn, leaves no question about the \ndangers and hostility regularly endured by Plaintiffs.”); R. Doc. 274 at 45 (“Anti-abortion \nactivists picketed the school of the children of a doctor formerly affiliated with Delta, after which \nthat doctor quit.”); R. Doc. 274 at 93 n.49 (“It is noteworthy that Hospital C, a hospital in a \nmajor metropolitan area and not a party to this action, is so concerned about the ramifications of \nhaving its identity public[ly] revealed, that it requested that it be named only through a \npseudonym and, with the consent of all the Parties, this was allowed.”). \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 397    01/28/21   Page 13 of 28\nContrary to Defendant and Intervenors’ assertions that generalized threats of harm are \ninsufficient to sustain anonymity in abortion-related litigation, this Court notes that the line \nbetween generalized and specific is potentially thin, and shares those concerns with the Plaintiff \nphysicians as well as the two district court judges in this district that have issued rulings \nupholding the ability to proceed under pseudonym. As stated by a Dr. Doe in a public exhibit \nprovided by Defendant, “[t]he terrorism works you know. It does. And so once you start \nmurdering abortion providers you know it really does terrorize the other abortion providers,” \nwhile the interviewer in that same transcript notes that “[d]ue to safety concerns, he [Dr. Doe] \nhas always left his name out of the press.” (R. Doc. 352-6 at 12). These circumstances weigh \nheavily in favor of protecting the identity of the Plaintiff physicians out of general concerns for \ntheir safety and well-being as well as that of their families.  \nAt the same time, these concerns must be balanced against the general deference to the \npublic’s right to access judicial records. Most compelling is Defendant’s argument that Plaintiff \nphysicians have voluntarily revealed themselves to the public as abortion providers, and then \nseemingly express concern about threats of violence directed to abortion providers in general. \nThe Court recognizes, however, that their identity as Plaintiff physicians in this matter may carry \nadditional risks beyond their identification as an abortion provider.  \nThe Court has reviewed the information advanced by Defendant that purports to reveal \ntheir identities to the public, and finds that the revealing nature of that information is somewhat \nexaggerated. First, an internet search of a physician’s name or a webpage that states the name \ndoes not establish public availability as an abortion provider (or as a plaintiff in this case) \nbecause a necessary prerequisite of the search is knowledge of the identity in the first place. \nNeither Defendant nor Intervenors provide any information regarding search engine results \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 397    01/28/21   Page 14 of 28\nreturned after searching terms like “Louisiana abortion providers” or “physicians performing \nabortions in Louisiana.” \nAs to the specific Plaintiff physicians, other publicly available information may show that \na Plaintiff physician has retired from practice, but there is nothing in that exhibit that indicates he \nprovides or provided abortions or is involved in this litigation. (See R. Doc. 351-8). The Court \ndoes, however, recognize that possible searches pertaining to the known abortion clinics may \nreveal the identities of a Plaintiff physician, but still will not identify them or their involvement \nin this litigation. \nEvidence cited by Defendant in support of its contention that “June Medical and its \ncounsel have solicited media coverage in ways that are wholly inconsistent with any serious \nconcerns about safety” contains no reference to or identifying information regarding Plaintiff \nphysicians, but does identify several clinic staff by name and image. (R. Doc. 350 at 6). On \nbalance, the Court finds Defendant and Intervenors’ suggestions that the identity of Plaintiff \nphysicians is publicly available is true as to some, but not all of the Plaintiff physicians. \nDr. Does 1-3, as noted by Plaintiffs, are also proceeding as plaintiffs anonymously in a \nseparate abortion-related action in this district, June Medical Services, et al. v. Russo, Case No. \n16-cv-444-BAJ-RLB. This fact weighs heavily in favor of permitting continued anonymity. As \nPlaintiffs note, the unsealing of certain Plaintiff physicians in this litigation would reveal their \nparticipation in a currently pending litigation for which the district judge found good cause to \npermit those Plaintiff physicians to proceed anonymously, citing continued concerns for personal \nsafety. To unseal their identities herein would be tantamount to disregarding a standing order of \nthe district judge in that litigation.  \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 397    01/28/21   Page 15 of 28\nDefendant also cites to cases in other courts wherein abortion providers have litigated in \ntheir own names. That certain abortion providers would choose to litigate in their own names \ndoes not necessitate a finding that other abortion providers’ identities must necessarily be \navailable to the public. It is entirely possible that one or more of the identities of the Plaintiff \nphysicians is publicly available through other means of inquiry, or even that an astute individual \nwould be able to aggregate public information in this litigation to deduce a reasonable or \npotentially accurate guess as to the identity of one or more of the Plaintiff physicians. Those \npossibilities do not, however, necessitate a finding that their identities should be judicially \nunveiled in light of valid, recognized concerns for their safety and their ability to practice in their \nchosen areas.  \nIn Doe v. Stegall, 653 F.2d 180, 186 (5th Cir. 1981), the Fifth Circuit allowed plaintiffs \nchallenging governmental activity to proceed anonymously based in part on a finding that, \n“[a]lthough they do not confess either illegal acts or purposes, the Does have, by filing suit, \nmade revelations about their personal beliefs and practices that are shown to have invited an \nopprobrium analogous to the infamy associated with criminal behavior.” The same can be said \nhere. The Court is sensitive to these concerns, and notes that two of our district judges have \nagreed in this and other pending abortion-related litigation.  \nWhat remains for consideration is the relevant significance of the identity of the Plaintiff \nphysicians to the findings of the district court, the Fifth Circuit, and the Supreme Court, based, \nonce again, on the general right of public access to judicial records. Even in that light, however, \nthe scales do not tip so significantly as to warrant unsealing of the identity of the Plaintiff \nphysicians.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 397    01/28/21   Page 16 of 28\nFirst, there is a substantial volume of relevant information pertaining to each of the \nPlaintiff physicians contained in the substantive decisions at each level, which includes but is not \nlimited to the physicians’ practice areas, board certifications, age and years in practice, clinic \nassociation, clinic practice schedules, types of abortion provided, gestational ages at which \nabortions provided, approximate daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly abortions performed by \nnumber and percentage, summaries of admitting privileges and applications (including excerpts \nof communications), training, and personal accounts of complications (without patient-\nidentifying information. See, e.g., R. Doc. 274 at 24-28; June Med. Servs. L.L.C. v. Gee, 905 \nF.3d 787, 793-801 (5th Cir. 2018); June Medical Servs., LLC, et al. v. Russo, 140 S.Ct. 2103 \n(2020). \nThe addition of the identities of the Plaintiff physicians adds very little, if anything, to the \npool of public information. The district court, Fifth Circuit, and Supreme Court all took great \ncare to thoroughly outline the facts and information upon which they relied in their findings, \nwhile preserving the anonymity of the Plaintiff physicians. The various courts’ decisions did not \nturn on the identity of the Plaintiff physicians, and their identities add little to understanding the \nbasis and, as Defendant and Intervenors point out, highly fact-specific underpinnings of the \ncourts’ decisions. Further, Intervenors have not shown how the identity of the Plaintiff \nphysicians would assist in the crafting of new legislation regulating abortion, or the drafting of \nanalytical articles regarding the Supreme Court’s decision, especially considering the availability \nof a substantial volume of information regarding the Plaintiff physicians in the other courts’ \ndecisions.  \nIn light of this finding, balanced with the noted continuing concerns for safety as well as \nthe continued anonymity provided certain Plaintiff physicians in June Medical Services LLC, et \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 397    01/28/21   Page 17 of 28\nal. v. Gee, et al., Case No. 3:16-cv-444-BAJ-RLB, this Court finds good cause to order the \nidentity of Plaintiff physicians to remain sealed. Neither Defendant nor Intervenors provide any \nargument as to why the identity of a Plaintiff physician is necessary going forward, which fact \nthe Court considers on balance with the genuine concerns for safety expressed by those same \nPlaintiff physicians. This finding specifically includes the actual identity of the Plaintiff \nphysicians by name, SSN, driver’s license number, telephone number, residential address, \nmarital status, and any familial relations, all of which shall remain confidential. Conversely, this \nfinding does not include information about the Plaintiff physicians that appears in public \ndecisions as outlined above, as well as any other similar information. \nDefendant suggests that “even if anonymity were still justified, it would not justify \nmaintaining documents under seal,” noting that “heavy redactions cover the doctors’ names even \nin the sealed record.” (R. Doc. 350 at 19). The Court agrees. Based upon the Court’s review of \nthe documents that remain under seal, much of the information noted above has already been \nredacted, even in the sealed record. R. Doc. 63 shall remain sealed. In addition, R. Docs. 170-2 \nand 176 will also remain sealed.6 Beyond that, to the extent the Court does not find good cause to \ncontinue to seal any document herein that contains any of the above listed information, that \ninformation shall be redacted where appropriate. In other words, the existence of some or all of \nthe information the Court has found to be confidential in this section, that information shall \nremain confidential via redaction rather than seal an entire document that contains confidential \n \n6 These two documents are an attachment to a Joint Stipulation.  That attachment contains a unique \nidentifying number for one of the Plaintiff physicians. This sealing protects the identity of the Plaintiff \nphysician. The actual joint stipulation (R. Doc. 170-1), which is addressed in the public record and \nprovides all information sufficient to address the concerns of the defense and the intervenors, is being \nunsealed.   \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 397    01/28/21   Page 18 of 28\ninformation, notwithstanding the Court’s finding that R. Doc. 63, 170-2 and 176 shall remain \nsealed in their entirety.  \n4.  Sensitive Business Information \nPlaintiffs argue that sensitive business information should remain sealed, describing the \ncategory as “non-public information regarding the innerworkings of non-party hospitals, \nincluding hospital by-laws, credentialing processes, and communications with physicians,” and \nmaking a distinction between non-party sensitive business information and confidential clinic \ninformation, the latter of which the Court will address in a separate section. (R. Doc. 344-1 at 9). \nPlaintiffs give very little indication, however, of what specific documents or information would \nconstitute sensitive business information, beyond the categories listed in Exhibit A, which \nsuggests that R. Docs. 93, 94, 102, 104, 168, 170, 176, 197, 198, 200, 203, 205, and 237 contain \nsuch information. (R. Doc. 344-3).  \nPlaintiffs’ representations are insufficient to meet their burden of establishing good cause. \nGeneral reference to a document, or documents, without more, does not establish the existence of \nsensitive business information. The Court’s review of the documents asserted to be confidential \nby Plaintiffs confirms this finding, as there exists a significant amount of information that could \nnot possibly be subject to continued confidentiality, essentially in perpetuity. For example, \nPlaintiffs contend that an application for admitting privileges containing a hospital’s bylaws \nwould constitute sensitive business information, but do not assert any particular information \ncontained therein that would be confidential.7 This would include materials sent to anyone \napplying for medical staff membership and clinical privileges. These and other information \n \n7 The Court recognizes that portions of the documents may contain the identity or identifying information \nof the Plaintiff physician. Redaction of that information, however, is more appropriate than sealing in \nperpetuity. It also appears that for the most part, that information has already been redacted, even from the \nsealed documents.  \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 397    01/28/21   Page 19 of 28\nappear to be part of an application packet, freely provided to anyone interested. Indeed, in one \nsuch example, Plaintiffs seek the court to retain such document under seal (R. Doc. 197-1 at 56-\n189), yet the same document was filed and is available to the public as one of Plaintiffs’ exhibits \n(R. Docs. 165-66 through 165-74).  \nPlaintiffs have not indicated any distinction of what information within such a document \nwould be confidential, and what would not. Plaintiffs provide insufficient support for their \nargument that allegedly sensitive business information should be subject to continued sealing \nbeyond final disposition of this litigation. More specifically, Plaintiffs have provided no legal \nauthority to support continued confidentiality of hospital bylaws, admitting privileges \nprocedures, credentialing processes or procedures, or any other third-party, non-clinic business \ninformation. Nor do Plaintiffs render any argument as to what specific information they suggest \nwould be confidential. Plaintiffs have, therefore, failed to meet their burden. Thus, to the extent \nnot specifically found confidential herein, Plaintiffs’ Motion to Maintain Seal will be denied.  \nFirst, information discussed in public decisions of the courts in this litigation, including \nthe same or similar information, will not be subject to confidentiality. A non-exhaustive list of \nexemplary information based on the court’s review of the public decisions includes admitting \nprivileges status and applications, communications with hospitals regarding admitting privileges, \nidentity of clinic administrators, testimony of Doe doctors regarding credentialing of hospitals \nand clinics, legislative history of Act 620, including testimony pertaining to clinic conditions and \npractices, and complications and/or hospitalizations relating to abortions. See R. Doc. 274; June \nMed. Servs. L.L.C. v. Gee, 905 F.3d 787 (5th Cir. 2018); June Medical Servs., LLC, et al. v. \nRusso, 140 S.Ct. 2103 (2020), passim. Some of this sealed information includes individuals who \nwere later witnesses at trial, either in person or through their deposition testimony, depositions of \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 397    01/28/21   Page 20 of 28\nexperts whose reports were then referenced in public proceedings, and in some circumstances, \nthe same exact document sealed in one instance and not sealed in another. More egregious \nexamples can be found, for instance, where Plaintiffs seek certain documents to remain sealed \n(R. Doc. 104-21) yet actually filed that document as an exhibit at trial (R. Doc. 165-151). \nCompare also R. Doc. 104-22 with R. Doc. 165-152. This type of review has been a waste of the \nCourt’s resources and reflects a lack of diligence by the mover and an abuse of this process. \nAnother example where the instant motion goes too far is the continued sealing of certain \nbriefing and argument. These contain no confidential information, do not identify the Plaintiff \nphysicians, and are often purely legal argument. The district judge’s public decisions on these \nissues reference much of the parties’ respective sealed briefing. In addition, the public has a \nstrong interest in access to the arguments made before the Court for relief and how (and whether) \nthose arguments were addressed by the Court. This equally applies to the proposed findings of \nfact and conclusions of law. Curiously, Plaintiffs did not request sealing of their own proposed \nfindings of fact and conclusions of law (R. Doc. 196), but now seek the continued sealing of \nessentially the same facts and argument that was advanced by the defense. (R. Docs. 198, 198-1, \n200). \nIn another example, Plaintiffs request continued sealing of their Opposition to \nDefendant’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (R. Doc. 104) along with exhibits, though it \nis unclear what specific information contained within this filing would be subject to continued \nsealing. Indeed, Plaintiffs’ Opposition itself contains none of the information Plaintiffs generally \nargue should remain sealed, as it references the Plaintiff physicians by pseudonym, is devoid of \nany identifying information, and contains no specific information regarding clinic practices or \nthe innerworkings of the hospitals. (See generally, R. Doc. 104 at 16-19, 21-22).  \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 397    01/28/21   Page 21 of 28\nThe Court also notes that identifying details regarding many of the exhibits to Plaintiffs’ \nOpposition are already part of the public record, including direct reference in the district judge’s \nFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. For example, where Plaintiffs broadly suggest the \nexhibits to their Opposition should remain sealed, which include certain deposition excerpts, \nJudge deGravelles noted by name that Kathaleen Pittman, Kathy Kliebert, Dr. Christopher Estes, \nDr. Sheila Katz, and Dr. Eva Karen Pressman all provided live testimony at the hearing. \n(Compare R. Doc. 104-13, 104-20 through 104-24 with R. Doc. 216 at 6-7). Similarly, Plaintiffs \nseek to maintain seal over deposition excerpts of Dr. Doe 2, but a comparison of those excerpts \nwith the publicly available Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law of Judge deGravelles \nreveals information in substantially more detail regarding Dr. Doe 2’s practice as well as his \nrequests for admitting privileges. (Compare R. Doc. 104-6 with R. Doc. 216 at 57-62). This \ninformation was necessary for the resolution of this matter and the public and intervenors have a \nright to know such information.  \nPlaintiffs also appear to seek maintenance of seal over certain correspondence pertaining \nto the drafting of Act 620, but in addition to the examples set forth above, identical information \nwas filed publicly as joint exhibits. (Compare, e.g. R. Doc. 104-17 with R. Doc. 165-7). The \nCourt also notes that Plaintiffs’ apparent request to maintain seal over correspondence between \nadvocacy groups and legislators is generally incongruous with their position in Opposition to \nDefendant’s Motion in Limine (which is not requested to remain sealed), wherein Plaintiffs \nargued that such information was highly relevant to the issue of whether Act 620 was passed \nwith an invalid purpose. (See R. Doc. 120 at 10-14). Ultimately, the apparent lack of information \nPlaintiffs specify as subject to continued sealing, coupled with the public availability of a \nsubstantial or equivalent portion of the exhibits to Plaintiffs’ Opposition, as shown by examples \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 397    01/28/21   Page 22 of 28\ngiven herein, lend the Court to conclude that continued sealing of Plaintiffs’ Opposition (R. Doc. \n104 through 104-24)8 is unwarranted.  \nThe Court likewise finds continued sealing inappropriate in a scenario where the same or \nsimilar information was discussed or disclosed regarding one provider, clinic, or hospital in \npublic court documents, but where such information would also be available for any other \nprovider. For example, if a court decision in this litigation (or through appeal) refers to the \nspecific number of abortions performed annually by a specific clinic, any reference in the district \ncourt record regarding the number of abortions performed annually by any other clinic is, \nlikewise, no longer subject to confidentiality. \nThe Court has undertaken the task of reviewing sealed, court-issued documents and party \nbriefing with attachments in light of this finding. To that end, the following docket entries will \nno longer remain sealed: R. Docs. 93, 93-1, 94, 94-1 through 94-25, 102, 104, 104-1 through \n104-24, 168, 168-1, 170, 170-1, 198, 198-1, 200, 203, 257-1, and 262.  \n5.  Confidential Clinic Information \nPlaintiffs also seek to maintain the confidentiality of purportedly confidential clinic \ninformation, including “proprietary clinic policies and procedures, non-public information \nregarding the clinic’s operations, and information that ‘could jeopardize the privacy of the staff, \nphysicians, patients and other associated with’ the clinic.” (R. Doc. 344-1 at 9). Like Plaintiffs \nassertions regarding purportedly sensitive business information, Plaintiffs provide little \nindication of what specific documents or information would constitute confidential clinic \ninformation that could somehow jeopardize the safety of those associated with the clinic(s). An \nindependent review by the Court finds little information that would arguably qualify and any \n \n8 This would include the proposed filing of the opposition to Defendant’s Partial Summary Judgment (R. \nDoc. 94 and exhibits). \n22 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 397    01/28/21   Page 23 of 28\nconcerns that may have led to sealing such information during the pendency of this lawsuit \noriginally no longer apply. Although not an exclusive list, the following documents shall be \nunsealed in their entirety on this basis: R. Docs. 198, 198-1, 200, 257, 257-1, and 262. \n6.  Sealed Trial and Related Materials \nThe district judge implemented certain steps to protect the confidentiality of information \ncovered by the protective order. Many of these steps were necessary to protect the identity of the \nPlaintiff physicians. For example, in addition to redacted exhibits that removed the actual names, \ncertain redactions were made to references in the transcripts that provided personally identifying \ninformation. The Court has reviewed those transcripts and finds that the redacted transcripts that \nwere filed in the record (R. Docs. 190-195) provide all information needed to protect the \ninterests of the defense, the intervenors, and the general public. The unredacted transcripts (R. \nDocs. 184-189 will remain sealed. This includes other documents relating to those transcripts. \n(R. Docs. 180-1, 182). \nThere are, however, numerous exhibits that were filed under seal for reasons independent \nof the confidentiality of the Plaintiff physicians. As set forth above, the Court is not satisfied that \nthere are sufficient other grounds to support the continued sealing of such documents. Those \ndocuments, however, may contain identifying information regarding the Plaintiff physicians or \nothers involved in providing abortions not otherwise identified in the record, within those \nexhibits. \nThe Court agrees with Defendant and Intervenors that a finding of good cause for \ncontinued confidentiality of some information does not justify that any particular document \nremain sealed in its entirety in perpetuity. While a particular document may contain some \nsensitive information, the presence of such does not necessarily warrant a broad sealing of the \n23 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 397    01/28/21   Page 24 of 28\nentire document where appropriate redactions could protect the confidential information while \nproviding the public access to the remaining, non-confidential portions. Having conducted \nextensive review of the remaining sealed information in this docket, it is highly unlikely that \nthere exists an entire document that would warrant sealing in perpetuity, with the noted \nexception of R. Doc. 63.  \nTo that end, the Court finds guidance in the recent approach utilized by the district court \nin June Medical Services LLC, et al. v. Gee, et al., Case No. 3:16-cv-444-BAJ-RLB. There, the \ndistrict court noted that Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.2(d) allows a court to order that a filing be made under \nseal without redaction, and later unseal the filing or order the person who made the filing to file a \nredacted version for the public record. \nThat approach is warranted here. At the outset, most of these sealed documents are \nalready redacted, and the undersigned does not expect that many, if any, additional redactions \nmay be necessary in light of the other provisions in this Order. In an effort to minimize the need \nfor judicial intervention as to redactions, Plaintiffs shall submit proposed redactions to Defendant \nwithin twenty-one (21) days of the date of this order. Following an opportunity to review \nPlaintiffs’ proposed redactions, Plaintiffs and Defendant shall then meet and confer within 14 \ndays of Defendant’s receipt of such redactions in an effort to resolve any disagreements. Should \nany disagreements remain after the meet and confer, Plaintiffs shall have fourteen (14) days from \nthe date of the meet and confer to file a motion, which motion shall contain a detailed \ncertification regarding the attempts to resolve any outstanding disagreements prior to court \nintervention and set forth any agreements as to redacted documents that may be filed. \nThe following documents shall be subject to review by the parties for potential redaction \nvia the procedure outlined above: This applies to the following documents only: R. Docs. 168-4 \n24 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 397    01/28/21   Page 25 of 28\nthrough 168-11, 197-1 through 197-32, 203-1 through 203-18, 205, 205-1 through 205-9, 237, \nand 237-1 through 237-158.  \n7.  Documents Filed After Plaintiffs’ Motion to Maintain \nSeveral sealed documents post-date the Plaintiffs’ filing of the Motion to Maintain, \nspecifically R. Docs. 351, 366, 378, 379, 380, 387, 388, 389, 390 (including attachments where \napplicable). The same findings with regard to documents filed prior to Plaintiffs’ Motion is \napplicable to these documents, without further discussion.  \nBased on this finding, the following documents are to be unsealed: R. Docs. 351, 351-1 \nthrough 351-2, 366, 366-1, 379, 380,9 380-1 through 380-3, 387, 387-1, 387-2, 388, 389, and \n390.10 \nThe following documents, filed after the instant motion, only serve to identify the \nPlaintiff physicians as the parties in this lawsuit, and will remain sealed: R. Docs. 351-3 through \n351-26, 366-2 through 366-6, 378, 378-1 through 378-23, and 379-1 through 379-4.  \nAs discussed above, that someone may be identified as an abortion provider in another \ncontext, or through diligent research (sometimes with the knowledge of the person’s identity to \nbegin with) is distinguishable from specifically identifying such person as a party in the record of \nthis lawsuit. Indeed, it may be possible that the public (including the intervenors) can \nindependently identify and confirm the identities of the Plaintiff physicians. This order cannot \n \n9 This document and attachments reflect argument directed to the undersigned’s ruling on certain motions.  \nThose motions as well as the ruling that was at issue are all public.  There is nothing in this Motion, \ndeclaration or memorandum in support that contains confidential information. \n10 The Court notes that this Order was filed by the district judge. Consistent with the undersigned’s \ntreatment of the applicability of the protective order and continued sealing of documents in this matter, \ncontinued sealing of this order would likewise be inappropriate.  \n25 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 397    01/28/21   Page 26 of 28\n(and does not) prevent such identification or use of such information if gleaned from publicly \navailable documents. The Court simply will not provide that confirmation in its docket.11 \nAny documents filed after the date of this Order shall be filed in accordance with the \nguidance provided herein. That is to say, no document shall be filed under seal, but may be filed \nwith appropriate, limited redactions as outlined herein. If there is any doubt that a filing may \ncontain any information that identifies the Plaintiff physicians or other individual abortion \nproviders directly or indirectly, guidance from the Court must be sought as to whether such filing \nshould be made under seal. \nIII.  Conclusion \nBased on the foregoing,  \nIT IS ORDERED that the Motion to Intervene and Oppose (R. Doc. 349) is \nGRANTED. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Motion to Maintain Documents Under Seal (R. \nDoc. 344) filed by Plaintiffs, June Medical Services, LLC, et al., is GRANTED IN PART and \nDENIED IN PART as set forth more fully herein. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the following documents will remain sealed: R. Doc. \n63, 170-2, 176, 180-1, 182, 184-189, 351-3 through 351-26, 366-2 through 366-6, 378, 378-1 \nthrough 378-23, and 379-1 through 379-4. \n \n11 The protective order in this case served, among other things, to protect the identity of the Plaintiff \nphysicians in this litigation. If anyone wants to participate in this case, then they will be subject to those \nprovisions. Attaching publicly available documents to filings in this matter makes the filed document \nsubject to this order. For example, a public state court document may identify otherwise confidential \ninformation. That document is public and can be freely used. Simply filing such document in this docket \ndoes not remove the underlying document’s status as a public record. But, if it is to be filed in this record, \nit will be done under seal. \n26 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 397    01/28/21   Page 27 of 28\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, for R. Docs. 168-4 through 168-11, 197-1 through \n197-32, 203-1 through 203-18, 205, 205-1 through 205-9, 237, and 237-1 through 237-158, to \nthe extent necessary, Plaintiffs shall submit proposed redactions to Defendant within twenty-\none (21) days of the date of this order. Following an opportunity to review Plaintiffs’ proposed \nredactions, Plaintiffs and Defendant shall then meet and confer within 14 days of Defendant’s \nreceipt of such redactions in an effort to resolve any disagreements. Should any disagreements \nremain after the meet and confer, Plaintiff shall have fourteen (14) days from the date of the meet \nand confer to file a motion, which motion shall contain a detailed certification regarding the \nattempts to resolve any outstanding disagreements prior to court intervention and set forth any \nagreements as to redacted documents that may be filed. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Clerk shall unseal file the following documents \nin the public record. As there was no request made to retain these under seal, the Clerk may \nunseal these records upon docketing of this Order: R. Docs. 101, 103, 105, 109, 109-1, 109-2, \n112, 112-1, 112-2, 112-3, 112-4, 112-5, 113, 113-1, 113-2, 113-3, 113-4, 113-5, 113-6, 113-7, \n113-8, 117, 118, 118-1, 118-2, 118-3, 119, 120, 120-1, 120-2, 120-3, 120-4, 120-5, 120-6, 175, \n183, 211, 261 \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the following documents are also to be unsealed. \nDue to the nature of this dispute, however, and because certain documents pertain to sealed \nfilings and order by the district judge, the Court will give the parties time to advance any \napplicable objections before these documents are made public. Accordingly, the following \ndocuments will be unsealed 14 days following the docketing of this Order to the extent no \nobjections are raised. The Clerk of Court is advised that a subsequent order will be issued prior \nto such unsealing. Any objections made to this portion of the order shall specifically identify \n27 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 397    01/28/21   Page 28 of 28\nthose records that (1) are being challenged and (2) are not being challenged so that the non-\nobjected to records may be appropriately unsealed at that time: R.

Plaintiffs oppose the \nmotion, (Doc. 502), and Defendant has filed a reply, (Doc. 503).  Oral argument was scheduled \nfor November 29, 2022, (Doc. 504), but the Court finds that it is no longer necessary.  The Court \nhas carefully considered the law, the facts in the record, and the arguments and submissions of the \nparties and is prepared to rule.  For the following reasons, the motion is granted, and the Court’s \npermanent injunction in this case is hereby vacated. \nI.  Relevant Background \nA.  This Court’s Injunction \nOn  April  26,  2017,  this  Court  issued  an  extensive  116-page  Findings  of  Fact  and \nConclusions of Law, (Doc. 274), addressing the constitutionality of Act 620, which has been \ncodified at an amended La. R.S. § 40:1299.35.2. (Doc. 274 at 12.)  Section A(2)(a) requires every \ndoctor who performs abortions in Louisiana to have “active admitting privileges” at a hospital \nwithin  30  miles  of  the  facility  where  abortions  are  performed.  (Id.  (quoting  La.  R.S.  § \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 505    11/14/22   Page 2 of 28\n40:1299.35.2A(2)(a)).) While the Act contains other requirements, this provision was the only one \nchallenged in the case. (Id. (citing Doc 5-1 at 8 n.1).)  Shortly before trial, on April 20, 2015, LDH \npromulgated implementing regulations that include an admitting privileges requirement repeating \nthe language of Act 620 and a penalty provision of $4,000 per violation. (Id. (citing La. Admin. \nCode tit. 48, pt. I, §§ 4401 (definition of “active admitting privileges”); 4423(B)(3)(e), available \nat 41 La. Reg. 685, 696 (Apr. 20. 2015)).) These were accompanied by a statement averring that \nthey “will only be enforced pursuant to Order” in the present case. (Id.)  Thus, the Court’s order \nembraced both the Act and the regulations. \nThose Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law culminated in the following: \n[T]he  Court  declares  Act  620  unconstitutional  in  all  of  its \napplications,  and  enters  a  permanent  injunction  barring  its \nenforcement. The active admitting privileges requirement of Section \nA(2)(a) of Act 620 is found to be a violation of the substantive due \nprocess right of Louisiana women to obtain an abortion, a right \nguaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States \nConstitution as established in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), \nand pursuant to the test first set forth in Planned Parenthood of \nSoutheastern  Pennsylvania  v.  Casey,  505  U.S.  833  (1992) \n(“Casey”), and subsequently refined in Whole Woman’s Health v. \nHellerstedt, 136 S. Ct. 2292, 2319 (2016) (hereinafter “WWH”). Act \n620  is  therefore  declared  unconstitutional,  and  its  enforcement \nenjoined in all of its applications. \n \n(Id. at 11.)  This Court went on to say: \nAct 620 is unconstitutional on its face under Casey and WWH. The \nAct would create substantial obstacles for women seeking abortion \nin  Louisiana  without  providing  any  demonstrated  benefit  to \nwomen’s health or safety. Any marginal health benefits would be \ndramatically outweighed by the obstacles the restriction erects to \nwomen’s access to their constitutional right to abortion. The Act \ntherefore  cannot  withstand  the  scrutiny  mandated  by  WWH. \nPlaintiffs have succeeded on the merits of their constitutional claim \nthat the Act violates the Fourteenth Amendment.  \n \n* * * \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 505    11/14/22   Page 3 of 28\nAn order permanently enjoining enforcement of Act 620 in all of its \napplications is the appropriate remedy. As with the Texas abortion \nrestrictions enjoined in all their applications by the decision in \nWWH,  Act  620  would  close  most  of  the  abortion  facilities  in \nLouisiana and “place added stress on those facilities able to remain \nopen.” WWH, 136 S. Ct. at 2319. Act 620 “vastly increase[s] the \nobstacles  confronting  women  seeking  abortions”  in  Louisiana \n“without  providing  any  benefit  to  women’s  health  capable  of \nwithstanding any meaningful scrutiny.” Id. Therefore, Act 620 is \nunconstitutional on its face. Pursuant to this Court’s authority under \n28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202, and Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure, this Court will enter orders declaring Act \n620 unconstitutional and permanently enjoining the Act in all of its \napplications. \n \n(Id. at 114–15.)  The Court entered a judgment in this matter effectuating this ruling and imposing \na permanent injunction which barred the enforcement of Act 620 and its implementing regulations. \n(Doc. 275.)  \nFollowing an appeal and lengthy procedural history, this Court’s decision was ultimately \nconsidered by the Supreme Court.  There, the High Court held, “We have examined the extensive \nrecord carefully and conclude that it supports the District Court's findings of fact. Those findings \nmirror  those  made  in  [WWH]  in  every  relevant  respect  and  require  the  same  result.  We \nconsequently hold that the Louisiana statute is unconstitutional.” June Med. Servs. L. L. C. v. \nRusso, 140 S. Ct. 2103, 2113 (2020). \nB.  Dobbs \n  Less than two years later, the Supreme Court changed course and issued the well-known \ndecision of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, 142 S. Ct. 2228 (2022).  There, the \nSupreme Court said: \nWe hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled. The Constitution \nmakes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly \nprotected by any constitutional provision, including the one on \nwhich the defenders of Roe and Casey now chiefly rely—the Due \nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.   \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 505    11/14/22   Page 4 of 28\n \n* * * \n \nStare decisis, the doctrine on which Casey’s controlling opinion was \nbased, does not compel unending adherence to Roe’s abuse of \njudicial authority. Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its \nreasoning  was  exceptionally  weak,  and  the  decision  has  had \ndamaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national \nsettlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed \ndebate and deepened division. \n \nIt is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to \nthe people's elected representatives. “The permissibility of abortion, \nand the limitations, upon it, are to be resolved like most important \nquestions in our democracy: by citizens trying to persuade one \nanother and then voting.” Casey, 505 U.S. at 979, 112 S. Ct. 2791 \n(Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). \nThat is what the Constitution and the rule of law demand \n \nId. at 2242–43. The High Court went on to conclude that “rational-basis review is the appropriate \nstandard for . . . challenges” to state abortion regulations, id. at 2283–84, and finished the decision \nas follows: \nWe end this opinion where we began. Abortion presents a profound \nmoral question. The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of \neach State from regulating or prohibiting abortion. Roe and Casey \narrogated that authority. We now overrule those decisions and return \nthat authority to the people and their elected representatives. \n \nId. at 2284. \nC.  Post-Dobbs Proceedings \n \nOn June 27, 2022, Defendant filed an emergency motion seeking an order vacating the \npermanent injunction in this case in light of Dobbs. (Doc. 487.)  Defendant sought relief summarily \nor, alternatively, within two days of filing her motion. (Id.)  Plaintiffs opposed the motion, arguing \nthat Defendant was not entitled to relief on the merits or, alternatively, that they should at least be \ngiven the opportunity to brief the matter fully. (Doc. 488.)  \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 505    11/14/22   Page 5 of 28\nOn June 29, 2022, this Court issued an order denying the motion in part and denying the \nmotion without prejudice in part. (Doc. 489.)  The Court denied the request for expedited \nconsideration, explaining, “The subject of this motion is a matter of considerable importance to \nthe State and its citizens and involves complicated issues of procedural and substantive law. The \nCourt finds that granting this motion with only two days consideration is unreasonable and \nunwarranted.” (Id.)  However, the Court denied the substantive part of Defendant’s motion without \nprejudice and stated that it would take up the matter after full briefing in compliance with and \nwithin the deadlines established by the Court’s local rules. (Id.) \nThe same day, Defendant filed a motion to reconsider in light of Whole Woman’s Health \nv. Young, 37 F.4th 1098 (5th Cir. 2022). (Doc. 490.)  This time, Defendant sought relief summarily, \nor alternatively, by the very next day. (Id.)  Plaintiffs opposed the motion. (Doc. 492.)   \nOn July 5, 2022, this Court denied the motion for reconsideration. (Doc. 493.)  The Court \nfound that none of the grounds required for reconsideration had been met. (Id. at 4–5.)  The Court \nthen concluded: \nThe Court notes in closing that, having reviewed Dobbs and Young, \nPlaintiffs appear to have an uphill battle. Defendant’s underlying \nmotion turns on the extent to which Rule 60(b)(5) is the proper \nvehicle for overturning a permanent injunction that has remained in \nplace for years because of a Supreme Court decision in another case \nthat has severely undercut it. There appears to be ample authority \nfor the view that vacating the permanent injunction is appropriate in \nthis situation because the relief is no longer equitable. See 11 Mary \nKay Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure (Wright & Miller) § 2863 \n& n.31 (3d ed. 2022) (“Because the standard is an exacting one, \nmany applications for relief on this ground are denied[.] . . . But on \nan adequate showing the courts will provide relief if it no longer is \nequitable  that  the  judgment  be  enforced,  whether  because  of \nsubsequent legislation, a change in the decisional law, or a change \nin the operative facts. (emphasis added)).  \n \nBut that is a question for another day. Here, Defendant has not \nshown that the Court abused its discretion or manifestly erred in \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 505    11/14/22   Page 6 of 28\nallowing Plaintiffs (and Defendant) a full opportunity to brief the \nissue—and certainly on more than two days’ notice and a near ex \nparte  basis.  This  is  particularly  true  considering  the  fact  that \ngranting these motions is an “extraordinary remedy that should be \nused sparingly.” [Allen v. Envirogreen Landscape Pros., Inc., 721 \nF. App'x 322, 328 (5th Cir. 2017), as revised (Dec. 7, 2017)] \n(cleaned up). \n \n(Id. at 5–6.)   \nDefendant  then  appealed  the  Court’s  order.  (Doc.  494.)    Defendant  also  sought  a \nmandamus from the appellate court. See June Med. Servs., L.L.C. v. Phillips, No. 22-30425, 2022 \nWL 4360593 (5th Cir. Sept. 28, 2022). \nOn September 28, 2022, the Fifth Circuit dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Id. \nat *2.  The appellate court explained that this Court’s order was merely “an administrative decision \nby the district court to manage its docket” which did not rule on the merits but only denied \nexpedited relief. Id. at *1.  Further, the Fifth Circuit denied Defendant’s writ of mandamus: \nEven if the district court's initial order and its reconsideration denial \nare not the functional equivalent of a scheduling order, the district \ncourt did not abuse its discretion denying the only motion presented \nto it—one to vacate forthwith or within two days. A district court \n“has broad discretion and inherent authority to manage its docket.” \nIn re Deepwater Horizon, 988 F.3d 192, 197 (5th Cir. 2021) (per \ncuriam). This district court acted prudently, with no evident dilatory \npurpose. The State has not persuaded this court that the district court \nabused its discretion when the district court refused to rule on the \nState's motion in the expedited fashion requested. \n \nId. at *2.  The Fifth Circuit closed by “respectfully direct[ing] the district court to expeditiously \naddress any merits claims that may be submitted by the respective parties and to enter an order \naccordingly.” Id.   \n  The following day, on September 29, 2022, this Court issued an expedited briefing \nscheduling giving Defendant fourteen days from the issuance of the mandate to file its renewed \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 505    11/14/22   Page 7 of 28\nmotion, fourteen days for Plaintiffs to file an opposition, and seven days for Defendant to reply. \n(Doc. 499.)  On October 3, 2022, the mandate was issued. (Doc. 500.) \n  On the same day, Defendant filed the instant motion. (Doc. 501.)  Defendant again moves \nthis Court for an order vacating the permanent injunction in this case, (Docs. 274, 275), in light of \nDobbs and Young. (Doc. 501 at 1.)  According to Defendant, Dobbs removes the legal and \nequitable basis for the injunction, and Young demonstrates that injunctions like the one in this case \nshould be vacated as a matter of circuit law. (Id.) \n  Following the completion of briefing, on November 1, 2022, this Court set oral argument \nin this mater for November 29, 2022. (Doc. 504.)  But, again, the Court finds that this oral argument \nis no longer necessary. \nII.  Parties’ Arguments \nA.  Defendant’s Original Memorandum (Doc. 501-1) \nDefendant contends that the key question under Rule 60(b)(5) is whether a change in the \nlaw has rendered enforcement of the injunction detrimental to the public interest. (Doc. 501-1 at \n6–7.)  Defendant has the burden, but if she shows such a change in the law, the injunction must be \nmodified. (Id. at 7.)  Here, Defendant asserts that she has met her burden, as the Dobbs decision \noverturned Roe v. Wade and Casey and returned the regulation of abortion to the states. (Id. at 8.)   \nBy Defendant’s reckoning, “The only question this Court needs to answer is whether \nongoing enforcement of the original [injunction is] supported by an ongoing violation of federal \nlaw.” (Id. at 9 (alteration in original).)  The State law at issue need only pass rational basis review, \nbut, here, this Court already determined that Act 620 did so. (Id.)  Thus, this Court should vacate \nits injunction. (Id.)  Other courts have done likewise. (Id.)  It is also important to note that, without \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 505    11/14/22   Page 8 of 28\na constitutional violation, injunctions of this nature “raise[] grave federalism concerns.” (Id.)  This \nCourt should thus act quickly to remedy the situation and vacate the injunction. (Id. at 10.)  \nB.  Plaintiffs’ Opposition (Doc. 502) \nPlaintiffs respond that the Court should deny the motion “because the State has plainly \nfailed to carry its heavy burden in demonstrating that prospective enforcement of the injunction is \nno longer equitable.” (Doc. 502 at 1.)  Plaintiffs say Defendant has “fail[ed] to grapple with the \nfacts on the ground . . . . Simply put, the State’s own near-complete abortion bans have forced all \nabortion care to cease and therefore Act 620’s admitting privileges requirements are moot.” (Id.)  \nThus, Plaintiffs argue, “Vacatur of the injunction would have no impact whatsoever on the scope \nof permissible abortion services in Louisiana, nor, as the state feebly suggests, on the health of \nLouisiana women.” (Id. at 1–2.)  Elaborating, Plaintiffs explain: \nTwo years later [after the Supreme Court’s decision in the instant \ncase,] following the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs, Louisiana \nhas banned nearly all abortions. See La. R.S. 40:1061; 14:87.7; \n14:87.8 (the “Trigger Bans”). Although the Trigger Bans were \ninitially enjoined, on August 1, 2022, the Louisiana Supreme Court \ndenied  an  emergency  motion  to  review  an  order  lifting  the \ntemporary block on the Trigger Ban’s  enforcement. June Med. \nServs. LLC v. Landry, No. 22-CD-1038 (La. Aug. 12, 2022). Also \nin August 2022, the Louisiana Department of Health sent a cease-\nand-desist letter to June Medical Services, LLC (“Hope Medical”). \nSince receipt of the cease-and-desist letter, Hope Medical, as well \nas the only two other clinics then operating in the state, have ceased \nproviding abortion care. There are currently no abortion clinics \noperating in Louisiana since the Trigger Bans, prohibiting virtually \nall abortions, have taken effect.  \n \n(Id. at 3.)   \n  Turning to the argument, Plaintiffs say that Rule 60(b)(5) “does not authorize relief from a \njudgment on the ground that the law applied by the court in making its adjudication has been \nsubsequently overruled or declared erroneous in another and unrelated proceeding.” (Id. at 4–5 \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 505    11/14/22   Page 9 of 28\n(quoting Bailey v. Ryan Stevedoring Co., 894 F.2d 157, 160 (5th Cir. 1990) (citing Hernandez v. \nThaler, 630 F.3d 420, 428–30 (5th Cir. 2011)).) \nPlaintiffs assert: \n \nHere, Louisiana has not established adequate justification for setting \naside the final permanent injunction, especially when one considers \nthe unavailability of abortions in Louisiana today. If the permanent \ninjunction were lifted and the Act went into effect, the Act would \nhave no practical impact on Louisiana’s ability to regulate and \nrestrict abortions because no abortions are taking place in clinics \nwith  providers  without  admitting  privileges.  In  August,  the \nLouisiana  Supreme  Court  denied  an  emergency  appeal  that \namounted to the last effort to enjoin the Trigger Bans. Now that the \nTrigger Bans are in effect, virtually all abortions are banned. As \nsuch, any abortions performed in Louisiana will be performed in an \nemergency context—likely in a hospital, where there is no possible \nneed for an admitting privileges requirement. If Act 620 went into \neffect  in  this  landscape,  it  would  be  regulating  a  nonexistent \npractice. This hardly amounts to the justification needed for setting \naside a permanent injunction that has been in effect since 2017. \n \nMore obviously, the Louisiana Department of Health’s cease-and-\ndesist letters—which forced all three abortion clinics in the state to \ncease providing abortion care—forecloses the possibility that clinic \nphysicians would need to obtain admitting privileges under the Act. \nThere are no longer any such clinic physicians in Louisiana. Indeed, \naccording to Louisiana, the Act was specifically intended to bring \n“abortion clinics into conformity with the preexisting requirement \nthat physicians at ambulatory surgical centers . . . have [admitting] \nprivileges.” See June Med. Servs. LLC v. Gee, 905 F.3d 787, 805 \n(5th Cir. 2018), rev’d sub nom. June Med. Servs. LLC v. Russo, 140 \nS. Ct. 2103 (2020) (emphasis added). Accordingly, there can be no \nequitable basis by which to lift the permanent injunction: Louisiana \nwill gain no additional control over abortions performed at clinics \nin Louisiana because as currently envisioned, all abortions will \nlikely take place at a hospital, and no clinics in the state provide \nabortion care. \n \n(Id. at 5–6 (alteration in original).)   \nPlaintiffs also dispute Defendant’s reliance on Horne v. Flores, 557 U.S. 433 (2009), as \nthat case dealt with an “institutional reform injunction,” which is “a type of injunction with specific \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 505    11/14/22   Page 10 of 28\nconcerns not at issue here.” (Id. at 6 (quoting Horne, 557 U.S. at 449–50 (noting that institutional \nreform injunctions “bind state and local officials to the policy preferences of their predecessors \nand may thereby ‘improperly deprive future officials of their designated legislative and executive \npowers’ ”)).)  Plaintiffs also emphasize that “Horne also did not involve a situation where, as here, \na subsequent statute had outright banned the practice that the enjoined law was regulating.” (Id.)  \nPlaintiffs close by arguing that, even if Act 620 passed rational basis review in 2015, \ncircumstances have changed such that this Court’s prior finding is no longer valid.  (Id. at 7.)  \nAgain, before, there were multiple clinics in Louisiana, and now, abortions can only take place in \nan emergency context (i.e., in a hospital anyway). (Id.)  Moreover, this Court also found in its prior \nruling that (1) the “overwhelming weight of the evidence demonstrates that, in the decades before \nthe Act’s passage, abortion in Louisiana has been extremely safe, with particularly low rates of \nserious complications, and as compared with childbirth and with medical procedures that are far \nless regulated than abortion,” and (2) that there “ ‘was no significant health-related problem that \nthe new law helped to cure’ and that there was ‘no credible evidence in the record that Act 620 \nwould further the State’s interest in women’s health beyond that which is already insured under \nexisting Louisiana law.’ ” (Id. at 7– 8 (quoting Doc. 247, ¶¶ 226, 240).)  Plaintiffs maintain that \nall of these findings, following an extensive analysis of the record, compels the conclusion that \nAct 620 lacks a rational basis. \nC.  Defendant’s Reply (Doc. 503) \n  Defendant replies that “Plaintiffs’ opposition is shocking and vexatious.” (Doc. 503 at 1.)   \nDefendant then quotes from Dobbs to illustrate how resoundingly the Supreme Court overturned \nthe precedent on which this Court relied and then cites Young for the proposition that “[t]he rule \nis so clear that the Fifth Circuit required only three-paragraphs to explain Dobbs alone warrants \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 505    11/14/22   Page 11 of 28\nvacating an injunction that relied on the overruled ‘undue burden’ standard that the Court applied \nin this case.” (Id. (citing Young, 37 F.4th 1098).)   \nDefendant next explains that Plaintiffs do not dispute much of their motion; according to \nDefendant, Plaintiffs concede that a significant change in the law can warrant Rule 60(b)(5) relief \nand that there is no longer a violation of federal law. (Id. at 2.)  Plaintiffs distinguish the Fifth \nCircuit cases relied upon by Plaintiffs on the grounds that two of them did not deal with prospective \napplication like the injunction at issue here and the third involved the retroactive application of \nsubstantive criminal laws in a habeas proceeding. (Id. at 2–3.) \nDefendant  then  argues  that  a  fact-intensive  inquiry  is  not  appropriate  because  the \nunderlying legal basis for the injunction has disappeared, but, even if it were appropriate, Plaintiffs \nget the facts wrong. (Id. at 4.) First, abortions can take place at hospitals and ambulatory surgical \ncenters, and, in any event, the fact “that abortions are now generally limited to cases of medical \nnecessity only increases the importance of having those abortions performed by doctors with \nadmitting privileges.” (Id. at 4–5.)  Second, while the Trigger Ban prohibits abortions, that ruling \nhas been appealed by Plaintiff June Medical and the injunction stayed.  (Id. at 5.)  Plaintiffs are \nseeking a permanent injunction.  (Id.)  And third, Louisiana suffers irreparable harm by the \nmaintenance of an injunction that lacks a legal basis. (Id.)  \nDefendant next contends that Horne controls.  (Id.)  The key lesson there was that the \ninjunction “improperly deprive[d] . . . officials of their designated legislative and executive \npowers.” (Id. (quoting Horne, 557 U.S. at 449).)  Defendant says, “Plaintiffs provide no basis for \ntheir claim that an injunction against a now-constitutional law does not implicate a federal court \n‘exceed[ing]  appropriate  limits’  by  maintaining  an  injunction  where  there  is  no  ‘ongoing \nviolation[] of federal law.’ ” (Id. at 5–6 (quoting Opposition, Doc. 502 at 7 (quoting Horne, 557 \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 505    11/14/22   Page 12 of 28\nU.S. at 450, 454)).)  Plaintiffs’ reliance on the dissent in Horne is misplaced considering the fact \nthat Dobbs expressly overruled the prior law. (Id. at 6.) \nDefendant again urges that Act 620 has a rational basis. (Id.)  This Court concluded as \nmuch, and that decision was not appealed. (Id. at 6–7.)  Moreover, the Fifth Circuit found that this \nlaw passes rational basis review. (Id. at 7.)  Further, even if the Court revisited the issue, the law \nwould be presumed constitutional, and the question would be whether legislature could have \nthought that the law would serve legitimate state interests. (Id.)  And all of the legitimate concerns \nthat were considered by the Fifth Circuit and Supreme Court in Dobbs still apply. (Id. at 8.) \nIII.  Relevant Standard  \nAs this Court previously stated, the instant motion turns on the proper interpretation and \napplication of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). (Doc. 493 at 5–6.)  Thus, an extensive \ndiscussion is warranted.  The Court will begin with an analysis of the law governing Rule 60(b)(5) \ngenerally before turning to specific examples of cases dealing with injunctions in cases such as \nthis one. \nA.  Rule 60(b)(5) Generally \n“ ‘Rule 60(b) allows a party to seek relief from a final judgment, and request reopening of \nhis case, under a limited set of circumstances,’ making it ‘an exception to finality.’ ” Sec. & Exch. \nComm'n v. Novinger, 40 F.4th 297, 302 (5th Cir. 2022) (quoting Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. \n524, 528–59 (2005)). “As relevant here, the rule authorizes a district court to ‘relieve a party or its \nlegal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding’ because . . .  (5) . . .  applying it \nprospectively is no longer equitable.” Id. (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5)).   \n“Rule 60(b)(5) does not provide relief ‘when it is no longer convenient to live with the \nterms of a [judgment].’ ” Id. at 307 (quoting Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk Cnty. Jail, 502 U.S. 367, \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 505    11/14/22   Page 13 of 28\n383 (1992)). “Rather, it ‘provides a means by which a party can ask a court to modify or vacate a \njudgment or order if “a significant change either in factual conditions or in law” renders continued \nenforcement “detrimental to the public interest.” ’ ” Id. (quoting Horne v. Flores, 557 U.S. 433, \n447 (2009) (quoting Rufo, 502 U.S. at 384)). That is to say,  \nBecause the standard is an exacting one, many applications for relief \non this ground are denied . . . .  But on an adequate showing the \ncourts will provide relief if it no longer is equitable that the judgment \nbe enforced, whether because of subsequent legislation, a change in \nthe decisional law, or a change in the operative facts. \n \nSee Charles A. Wright and Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure § 2863 & n.31 (3d ed. \n2022).   \nTwo important Supreme Court cases—Rufo and Horne—provide extensive discussions of \nRule 60(b)(5) in the context of consent decrees and “institutional reform” decrees.  Though these \ncases are of course different in some ways, the Supreme Court’s framework is highly relevant to \nthe instant analysis. See 2 Moore's Federal Practice - Civil § 60.47[2][b] (2022). \nIn Rufo, the Supreme Court explained that “a party seeking modification of a consent \ndecree bears the burden of establishing that a significant change in circumstances warrants revision \nof the decree. If the moving party meets this standard, the court should consider whether the \nproposed modification is suitably tailored to the changed circumstance.” Rufo, 502 U.S. at 383.  \nAs to the first prong, “[m]odification [of a consent decree] is . . . appropriate when,” inter alia, “a \ndecree proves to be unworkable because of unforeseen obstacles, or when enforcement of the \ndecree without modification would be detrimental to the public interest.” Id. at 384–85 (cleaned \nup).  More pertinent here, “[a] consent decree must of course be modified if, as it later turns out, \none or more of the obligations placed upon the parties has become impermissible under federal \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 505    11/14/22   Page 14 of 28\nlaw.” Id. at 388.  “But modification of a consent decree may be warranted when the statutory or \ndecisional law has changed to make legal what the decree was designed to prevent.” Id.   \nLikewise, in Horne v. Flores, the Supreme Court recognized that “courts must take a \n‘flexible approach’ to Rule 60(b)(5) motions addressing such [institutional reform] decrees.”  557 \nU.S. at 450 (quoting Rufo, 502 U.S. at 381). “A flexible approach allows courts to ensure that \nresponsibility for discharging the State's obligations is returned promptly to the State and its \nofficials when the circumstances warrant.” Id. (cleaned up).  “In applying this flexible approach, \ncourts must remain attentive to the fact that federal-court decrees exceed appropriate limits if they \nare aimed at eliminating a condition that does not violate [federal law] or does not flow from such \na violation.” Id. (cleaned up). “If [a federal consent decree is] not limited to reasonable and \nnecessary implementations of federal law, it may improperly deprive future officials of their \ndesignated legislative and executive powers.” Id. (alteration in original) (cleaned up).  Under this \n“flexible standard,” the Court should “return control to state and local officials as soon as a \nviolation of federal law has been remedied . . . .” Id. at 450–51. \nPlaintiffs urge that Rufo and Horne should be limited to cases involving “institutional \nreform decrees,” (Doc. 502 at 6), but one leading treatise takes a contrary and, the Court believes, \na better view:  \nSome concern has been expressed that the flexible standard for \ndetermining whether relief is appropriate as announced in the Rufo \ncase . . . may not be appropriately applied in private litigation or any \nlitigation not directed at some governmental entity in the name of \ninstitutional reform. The better view clearly is that the flexible, Rufo \nstandard should not be limited to “institutional reform” litigation \nbecause it “is no less suitable to other types of equitable cases.” The \nvery  nature  of  a  flexible  standard  is  that  it  is  adaptable  to  its \nsurroundings.  Factors  that  are  very  important  in  one  type  of \nlitigation (for example, in institutional-reform litigation: the lengthy \nduration  of  injunctive  decrees,  federalism  concerns  in  cases \ninvolving areas of core state responsibility and state or local budget \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 505    11/14/22   Page 15 of 28\npriorities, and the limiting effect on current state and local officials \nof litigation decisions made by their predecessors) may be weighed \nmuch less in other types of litigation. In other types of litigation, \nother factors will be much more important (for example, in private \ncommercial litigation: the need for finality of judgments and the \nsanctity of bargains). The language in Rufo stressing the unique \nfactors to be weighed in deciding whether to modify a decree in \ninstitutional  reform  litigation  may  be  just  that—factors  to  be \nstressed in one particular type of action. What Rufo undoubtedly \ndecided in any context was that the strict “grievous harm” standard \nwas improper, and the reasons the Rufo court gave for rejecting this \ninflexible  approach  were  not  limited  to  any  particular  type  of \nlitigation. \n \n12 Moore's Federal Practice - Civil § 60.47[2][b] (2022). \nThus, as this treatise later explains, “[t]here are a number of factors that may be considered \nin determining whether there is a ‘significant change in circumstances’ . . . that makes continued \nenforcement of the decree, without modification, inequitable. . . .” Id. § 60.47[2][c].  “The factors \nmay vary depending on whether the relief sought is a complete dissolution of the injunction or \nonly a modification of the injunction.” Id.  “[I]f a party seeks to have a decree set aside entirely, \nhe or she has to show that the decree has served its purpose, and there is no longer any need for \nthe injunction.” Id.  Further, “[t]he importance of the public interest varies with the type of \nlitigation. . . . Some litigation seeking to enjoin strictly private entities is brought in the public \ninterest and, therefore, is still intimately tied to important public policies.” Id.  “Finality of \njudgments and sanctity of agreements are much more important in private litigation than in \ninstitutional reform or other public-interest litigation.” Id. “Ordinarily, … modification should not \nbe granted where a party relies upon events that actually were anticipated at the time of the decree.” \nId. (cleaned up).  “However, a party need not anticipate every conceivable contingency, and even \nif changes were anticipated, a rigid approach is not appropriate.” Id.  Finally, and perhaps most \ncritically to the instant analysis: \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 505    11/14/22   Page 16 of 28\nChanges in law since [the] decree was entered are circumstances \nthat may justify relief, but more so in institutional litigation than in \nprivate litigation. At least in institutional-reform and other forms \nof public-interest litigation, “modification of a consent decree \nmay be warranted when the statutory or decisional law has \nchanged  to  make  legal  what  the  decree  was  designed  to \nprevent.” And when no consent decree is involved, a change in \nthe law that permits what was previously forbidden is sufficient \nby itself to warrant modification of the injunction; the court \nneed not consider other factors such as the balance of harms. In \nprivate litigation, however, the analysis may differ. Changes in the \nlaw may be considered by a court when a party seeks relief from a \nprivate decree; but changes in the law have much more importance \nwhen public interests are at stake than in private litigation in which \nthe  parties  litigate  or  bargain  with  the  expectation  that  their \ncommercial dispute will be resolved, for a fixed cost, and in a final \njudgment. In any event, even a significant change in the law will not \nwarrant relief from a judgment if that change would not have altered \nthe outcome of the litigation in which the judgment was entered. \n \nId.  (bold added, italics in original). \nUltimately, “Rule 60(b)(5) motions . . .  are directed to the sound discretion of the district \ncourt . . . .” Novinger, 40 F.4th at 302 (cleaned up). “The party seeking relief bears the burden of \nestablishing that changed circumstances warrant relief, but once a party carries this burden, a court \nabuses its discretion when it refuses to modify an injunction or consent decree in light of such \nchanges.” Horne, 557 U.S. at 447 (cleaned up).  \nB.  Examples Involving Injunctions Based on Outdated Law   \nSeveral lower court cases illustrate the principle from Rufo and Horne that an injunction \nshould be modified under Rule 60(b)(5) when the legal basis for that injunction is no longer \npresent.  Indeed, many of these cases confirm that it is an abuse of discretion for a court to fail to \ndo so. \nFor example, in Freeman v. City of Fayetteville, 971 F. Supp. 971 (E.D.N.C. 1997), the \ndistrict court observed that “[a] rising constitutional floor-or . . .  a falling constitutional ceiling \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 505    11/14/22   Page 17 of 28\nmay make modifications necessary.” Id. at 974 (quoting NAACP v. Seibels, 20 F.3d 1489, 1504 \n(11th Cir. 1994)).  The issue in Freeman was whether “the rigid [racial] quotas imposed by [a] \n1974 judgment [had] been rendered unconstitutional by subsequently-decided authority requiring \nthe application of strict scrutiny to such quotas.” Id. at 974–75. The district court determined that \n“[t]he judgment at issue [wa]s neither supported by the requisite compelling interest nor narrowly \ntailored in its remedy,” id. at 976; that the consent decree was thus “unconstitutional,” id. at 977; \nthat “defendants ha[d] satisfied their burden of establishing a significant change in law as required \nby Rufo,” id.; and that, consequently, “their motion pursuant to Rule 60 [could] be allowed,” id.  \nAs to the remedy, the Court concluded “that the continuation of the judgment [wa]s not permissible \nunder federal law and [wa]s detrimental to the public interest” and that “[t]he only suitable \nmodification to the drastic change in the state of the law [wa]s termination of the decree.” Id.   \nLikewise, in Theriault v. Smith, 523 F.2d 601 (1st Cir. 1975), the First Circuit affirmed the \ndistrict court’s order vacating a consent decree. Id. at 601–02.  The circuit explained that a \nsubsequent Supreme Court decision “represented a fundamental change in the legal predicates of \nthe consent decree” and that “[t]his is arguably the kind of situation in which relief should be \navailable under Rule 60(b)(5).” Id. at 601.  The First Circuit then stated: \nDefendant sought prospective relief only, and he did so only as a \nresult of an important decision of the Supreme Court. It may well be \nunreasonable to require defendant, for the indefinite future, to abide \nby a consent decree based upon an interpretation of law that has been \nrendered incorrect by a subsequent Supreme Court decision. As Mr. \nJustice Cardozo stated in the leading case of United States v. Swift \n& Co.: “A continuing decree of injunction directed to events to come \nis subject always to adaptation as events may shape the need.” 286 \nU.S. 106, 114, 52 S. Ct. 460, 462 (1932). See also System Federation \nNo. 91 v. Wright, 364 U.S. 642, 646-48, 81 S. Ct. 368, 5 L. Ed. 2d \n349  (1961);  11  C.  Wright  &  A.  Miller,  Federal  Practice  & \nProcedure, s 2863 (1973). \n \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 505    11/14/22   Page 18 of 28\nId. at 601–02.  The appellate court concluded, “in vacating the consent decree, the district court \nexercised sound discretion, comporting with established principles of equity and the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure.” Id. at 602. \nBut, again, Rule 60(b)(5)’s application to changes of the law is not limited to consent \njudgments and institutional reform litigation.  For instance, in Prudential Insurance Co. of America \nv. National Park Medical Center, Inc., 413 F.3d 897 (8th Cir. 2005), the Eighth Circuit upheld in \npart a district court’s decision to vacate an injunction based on an intervening change in the law.  \nAt issue was the Arkansas Patient Protection Act of 1995 (“Arkansas PPA”) generally and the \nArkansas “any willing provider” (“AWP”) law specifically, which “require[d] health care insurers \nto admit qualified health care providers into the insurer's provider networks if they are willing to \nmeet the terms and conditions of participation.” Id. at 902.  The Eighth Circuit had ruled that the \nArkansas PPA was preempted in its “entirety” by ERISA and ordered the district court to enter an \ninjunction prohibiting enforcement of  the law. Id.  However, a subsequent Supreme Court \nopinion—Kentucky Association of Health Plans v. Miller, 538 U.S. 329 (2003)—concluded that \ntwo Kentucky AWP statutes were not preempted, and this led a district court of Arkansas judge to \nhold that “that ‘the significant shift in the law as a result of the Miller decision meets the \nrequirement of an extraordinary circumstance’ for the purposes of Rule 60(b)(5) and [to] dissolve[] \nthe injunction barring the enforcement of the Arkansas PPA.” Id. at 903.   \nOn appeal, the Eighth Circuit rejected appellants’ argument that there was no change to the \nCourt’s binding precedent. Id. at 904.  The appellate court explained that Miller did in fact overrule \nthe circuit’s precedent. Id.   Even putting this aside, the “district court . . . had authority to grant \nthe motion” because it “only modified its own prior judgment by dissolving the injunction.” Id. \n(citing Standard Oil Co. of Calif. v. United States, 429 U.S. 17, 18 (1976) (holding that where later \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 505    11/14/22   Page 19 of 28\nreview makes doing so appropriate, a district court may grant relief from permanent injunctions \nwithout appellate leave)).  The Eight Circuit went on to conduct an ERISA preemption analysis \nand decided that Miller (1) “mandate[d] that [the Eighth Circuit] affirm the district court’s \ndissolution of the [earlier] injunction with regard to insured ERISA plans and non-ERISA plans” \nbut (2) did not require dissolution of the injunction with respect to self-funded ERISA plans and \nthe civil penalties provision of the Arkansas PPA, as those issues were not addressed in Miller. Id. \nat 907–08. \nBut, perhaps the strongest case in support of Defendant’s position is California by & \nthrough Becerra v. United States Environmental Protection Agency, 978 F.3d 708 (9th Cir. 2020).  \nThere, a district court “entered an injunction requiring [the] EPA to promulgate” a plan “detailing \nhow [emissions guidelines for landfills would] be implemented” within six months, after the EPA \nhad missed its previous deadline. Id. at 710–11.  “A few months  later, EPA finalized the \nrulemaking process, which extended its regulatory deadline by two years.” Id. at 711.  Faced with \ntwo conflicting deadlines (the one by the court and the one in the amended regulations), the “EPA \nasked the district court to modify the injunction, but it declined to do so.” Id.  The Ninth Circuit \nsummarized, “We're asked to decide whether a district court abuses its discretion by refusing to \nmodify an injunction even after its legal basis has evaporated and new law permits what was \npreviously enjoined. We answer affirmatively and reverse.” Id. \nThe Ninth Circuit began with a discussion of the Rule 60(b)(5) standard: \n \nIf [Rule 60(b)(5)] sounds like a pliable standard, that's because it is. \nBut this flexibility is a virtue, not a vice. Historically, what made \ncourts of equity different was that they could be “flexible” and \n“adjust their decrees, so as to meet most, if not all” of the exigencies \nto  do  justice  for  the  parties.  Such  courts  could  “vary,  qualify, \nrestrain, and model the remedy, so as to suit to mutual and adverse \nclaims, controlling equities, and the real and substantial rights of all \nthe parties.” Indeed, equity exists “[b]ecause it is impossible that any \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 505    11/14/22   Page 20 of 28\ncode, however minute and particular, should embrace or provide for \nthe  infinite  variety  of  human  affairs,  or  should  furnish  rules \napplicable to all of them[.] \n \nRule  60(b)(5),  and  its  malleable  standard  for  modifying  an \ninjunction,  preserves  the  courts’  historical  discretion  over \ninjunctions. . . . But judicial discretion—historically and now—is \nnot unbridled. American equity jurisprudence, thus, reflected an \n“effort to restrain the discretion courts of equity once wielded and \nto roundly reject a view in which equity depends on the length of \neach chancellor's foot.” \n \nId. at 713 (alterations in original) (internal citations omitted). \nThe Ninth Circuit then explained, “An unbroken line of Supreme Court cases makes clear \nthat it is an abuse of discretion to deny a modification of an injunction after the law underlying the \norder changes to permit what was previously forbidden.” Id. at 713–14 (citing, inter alia, Agostini \nv. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 215 (1997) (granting relief from an injunction in light of a shift in \nEstablishment  Clause  jurisprudence  and  explaining,  “  ‘[a]  court  may  recognize  subsequent \nchanges in either statutory or decisional law’ giving rise to an injunction, and a ‘court errs when it \nrefuses to modify an injunction or consent decree in light of such changes.’ ” (California, 978 F.3d \nat 714))).  The appellate court then looked at its own caselaw and observed, “We have likewise \nheld that a shift in the legal landscape that removes the basis for an order warrants modification of \nan injunction.” Id. at 715.  The Ninth Circuit next stated: \nOther  circuits  have  adopted  similar  approaches. See Am.  Horse \nProt. Ass'n, Inc. v. Watt, 694 F.2d 1310, 1316, 1318–19 (D.C. Cir. \n1982) (holding that new law, by itself, warranted modification of an \ninjunction); Williams v. Atkins 786 F.2d 457, 463 (1st Cir. 1986) \n(holding modification is warranted when the “legal predicate for [a] \nconsent decree has changed so substantially[,] that [the decree] is \nnow without a foundation in current federal law and it in part \nconflicts with federal law”); Sweeton v. Brown, 27 F.3d 1162, 1166–\n67  (6th  Cir.  1994)  (en  banc)  (reversing  the  district  court  and \nremanding with instructions to dissolve injunctions imposed by a \nconsent decree based on a change in the law); Protectoseal Co. v. \nBarancik, 23 F.3d 1184, 1187 (7th Cir. 1994) (lifting of injunction \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 505    11/14/22   Page 21 of 28\nwas “mandated” by Congress's amendment to the Clayton Act). \n \nId.  \n  The Ninth Circuit also rejected the state’s position that the court needed to conduct “a \nbroad, fact-intensive inquiry into whether altering an injunction is equitable, even if the legal duty \nunderlying the injunction has disappeared.” Id. at 715–16.  While Rufo engaged in such analysis, \nthat case involved “a consent decree, which is a contract-like judgment that turns on the parties’ \nexpectations.” Id. at 716 (citing Rufo, 502 U.S. at 378).  “Accordingly, the weight of authority \nconfirms that, once the legal basis for an injunction has been removed, such that the law now \npermits what was previously forbidden, it is an abuse of discretion to not modify the injunction.” \nId. at 717. \n  The appellate court next explained how “[t]his caselaw accords with our understandings of \nequity.” Id. \n As one leading commentator noted over 100 years ago, a “court of \nequity never grants an injunction on the notion that it will do no \nharm to the defendant if he does not intend to commit the act in \nquestion. An injunction will not issue unless some positive reasons \nare shown to call for it.” 2 William Blackstone, Commentaries on \nthe Laws of England and Additional Notes by Archibold, et al., *282 \nn.13 (George Sharswood ed. 1893) (discussing when injunctions \nmay issue to prevent “waste”). So, even if an injunction appears to \n“do no harm to the defendant,” it necessarily does so by its nature. \nId. And, accordingly, we should require a “positive” basis for its \nimposition. Id. . . . Compelling EPA, then, to continue to adhere to \nan injunction based on a legal duty that has since disappeared is a \nharm in and of itself. EPA is now under no legal duty—besides the \ncourt's injunction—to promulgate a federal plan by the now-stayed \nNovember 2019 date. Because EPA's new regulations have removed \nthe legal basis for the court's deadline, we hold it an abuse of \ndiscretion to deny EPA's request for relief under Rule 60(b)(5). \n \nId.  The Ninth Circuit ultimately concluded: \n \nWe therefore hold that when a district court reviews an injunction \nbased solely on law that has since been altered to permit what was \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 505    11/14/22   Page 22 of 28\npreviously forbidden, it is an abuse of discretion to refuse to modify \nthe injunction in the light of the changed law. As courts, we are \nempowered  to  decide  “[c]ases”  and  “[c]ontroversies.”  See  U.S. \nConst. art. III, § 2. We have no power to pick and choose what law \nthe parties before us ought to follow. Yet that is exactly what a court \ndoes  when  it  refuses  to  modify  an  injunction  that  relies  on  a \nsuperseded law. \n \nId. at 718–19 (alterations in original). \n \nIV.  Analysis \nA.  Is it equitable after Dobbs to maintain the injunction as it currently stands? \n \nThere is little dispute that there has been a significant change in the law underpinning the \ninjunction.  Again, this Court issued its order based on the reasoning that: \nAct 620 is unconstitutional on its face under Casey and WWH. The \nAct would create substantial obstacles for women seeking abortion \nin  Louisiana  without  providing  any  demonstrated  benefit  to \nwomen’s health or safety. Any marginal health benefits would be \ndramatically outweighed by the obstacles the restriction erects to \nwomen’s access to their constitutional right to abortion. The Act \ntherefore  cannot  withstand  the  scrutiny  mandated  by  WWH. \nPlaintiffs have succeeded on the merits of their constitutional claim \nthat the Act violates the Fourteenth Amendment.  \n \n(Doc. 274 at 114.)  But, as explained above, Dobbs overruled Roe and Casey, declared the former \n“egregiously wrong from the start” and the latter not entitled to deference under stare decisis, and \nestablished a rational basis review for state abortion laws. Dobbs, 142 S. Ct. at 2243, 2283–84.  \nNone of this is seriously disputed, nor can it be. \nThus, the only question before the Court is whether this significant change in the law \nbrought by Dobbs makes continued maintenance of the injunction detrimental to the public interest \nand inequitable so as to justify an order vacating it.  In short, the Court finds that it does. \nAgain, all of the above authority recognizes that the Court acts properly in vacating an \ninjunction when the legal basis for that injunction has been eliminated—and, indeed, the Court \n22 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 505    11/14/22   Page 23 of 28\nlikely abuses its discretion when it doesn’t. See Rufo, 502 U.S. at 388 (“But modification of a \nconsent decree may be warranted when the statutory or decisional law has changed to make legal \nwhat the decree was designed to prevent.”); Horne, 557 U.S. at 450 (“In applying this flexible \napproach, courts must remain attentive to the fact that federal-court decrees exceed appropriate \nlimits if they are aimed at eliminating a condition that does not violate [federal law] or does not \nflow from such a violation.”); California, 978 F.3d at 717  (“ “Accordingly, the weight of authority \nconfirms that, once the legal basis for an injunction has been removed, such that the law now \npermits what was previously forbidden, it is an abuse of discretion to not modify the injunction.”); \nPrudential Ins. Co. of Am., 413 F.3d at 907–08 (8th Cir. 2005) (affirming dissolution of earlier \ninjunction in light of subsequent Supreme Court decision); Theriault v. Smith, 523 F.2d at 602 (“It \nmay well be unreasonable to require defendant, for the indefinite future, to abide by a consent \ndecree based upon an interpretation of law that has been rendered incorrect by a subsequent \nSupreme Court decision.”); Freeman, 971 F. Supp. at 974  (“[A] rising constitutional floor-or . . . \na  falling  constitutional  ceiling  may  make  modifications  necessary.”  (alterations  in  original) \n(quoting NAACP v. Seibels, 20 F.3d at 1504)).  Again, as Moore’s Federal Practice explained: \nAt least in institutional-reform and other forms of public-interest \nlitigation, “modification of a consent decree may be warranted when \nthe statutory or decisional law has changed to make legal what the \ndecree was designed to prevent.” And when no consent decree is \ninvolved, a change in the law that permits what was previously \nforbidden is sufficient by itself to warrant modification of the \ninjunction; the court need not consider other factors such as the \nbalance of harms. \n \n12 Moore's Federal Practice - Civil § 60.47[2][b] (2022) (emphasis added).  Thus, there is little \ndoubt that Rule 60(b)(5) serves as the proper basis for vacating the injunction under these \ncircumstances. \n23 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 505    11/14/22   Page 24 of 28\n  Indeed, as Defendant argued in briefing, this circuit and many others have vacated laws \ndealing with abortion in light of Dobbs. See Whole Women’s Health v. Young, 37 F.4th 1098, \n1099–1100 (5th Cir. 2022) (vacating injunction of Texas law regulating disposal of embryonic and \nfetal tissue remains that had previously been found to run afoul of Casey and remanding the case \n“for further proceedings consistent with Dobbs”); SisterSong Women of Color Reprod. Just. \nCollective v. Governor of Ga., 40 F.4th 1320, 1324, 1326 (11th Cir. 2022) (vacating pre-Dobbs \ninjunction on law prohibiting post-fetal-heartbeat abortions; finding that pre-Dobbs decisions that \n“apply any heightened review or state that any provision of the Constitution protects a right to \nabortion” were abrogated by Dobbs; and finding that, post-Dobbs, the law had a rational basis); \nPlanned Parenthood S. Atl. v. Wilson, No. 21-1369, 2022 WL 2900658, at *1 (4th Cir. July 21, \n2022) (granting, in light of Dobbs, motion for summary vacatur of prior affirming of preliminary \ninjunction of fetal heartbeat law).  While these cases did not expressly reference Rule 60(b)(5), the \nequitable power of the Court in handling these injunctions remains the same, and each decision \nstrongly supports the conclusion that maintaining this injunction is no longer equitable.  \n  The Court also agrees with Defendant that the authority relied upon by Plaintiffs for the \nproposition that a change in the law is insufficient is either distinguishable or unpersuasive. See \nBailey v. Ryan Stevedoring Co., 894 F.2d 157, 160 (5th Cir. 1990) (holding, with respect to motion \nto reconsider ruling on motion for attorneys fees, that Rule 60(b)(5) did not apply because that rule \n“provides relief from a final judgment when it is no longer equitable that the judgment shall have \nprospective application” and because “the judgment in this case ha[d] no prospective effect.” \n(citation omitted), holding modified on other grounds by Hess v. Cockrell, 281 F.3d 212 (5th Cir. \n2002)); Hernandez v. Thaler, 630 F.3d 420, 430 (5th Cir. 2011) (“Direct review of Hernandez's \nfederal habeas petition concluded in December 2006 when this court denied his first motion for a \n24 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 505    11/14/22   Page 25 of 28\nCOA. Hernandez cannot use Rule 60(b)(6) to circumvent the principle that when the Supreme \nCourt announces a new rule of law and applies it to the parties before it, the new rule is given \nretroactive effect only in cases that are still open on direct review.”); Lowry Dev., L.L.C. v. Groves \n& Assocs. Ins., Inc., 690 F.3d 382, 386 (5th Cir. 2012) (affirming, in a professional negligence \ncase, the granting of Rule 60(5) motion, made under a different clause of that rule than the one at \nissue here (which allows a court to relieve a party from a final judgment if it is “based on an earlier \njudgment that has been reversed or vacated”) and stating in dicta that the “qualification” that “Rule \n60(b)(5) does not authorize relief from a judgment on the ground that the law applied by the court \nin making its adjudication has been subsequently overruled or declared erroneous in another and \nunrelated proceeding” was “not implicated here”).  None of these cases involve a situation like the \npresent one: where a permanent injunction was entered enjoining the enforcement of a State’s \npublic law and the legal foundation of that injunction was later gutted by a subsequent Supreme \nCourt decision such that maintenance of the injunction was no longer equitable. \nIn sum, the legal foundation of the Court’s injunction banning the enforcement of Act 620 \nis no longer present.  Thus, maintaining the injunction, as currently constituted, is no longer \nequitable, and the legislation must be re-evaluated in light of the law currently in effect.   \nB.  Can the injunction stand after Dobbs? \nAccordingly, the Court must determine whether Act 620 withstands rational basis review \nfollowing Dobbs.  In short, the Court finds that it does. \n  The Court begins with the standard succinctly summarized by Dobbs: \n \nStates may regulate abortion for legitimate reasons, and when such \nregulations are challenged under the Constitution, courts cannot \nsubstitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of \nlegislative bodies. That respect for a legislature's judgment applies \neven  when  the  laws  at  issue  concern  matters  of  great  social \nsignificance and moral substance.  \n25 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 505    11/14/22   Page 26 of 28\n \nA law regulating abortion, like other health and welfare laws, is \nentitled to a strong presumption of validity. It must be sustained if \nthere is a rational basis on which the legislature could have thought \nthat  it  would  serve  legitimate  state  interests.   These  legitimate \ninterests include respect for and preservation of prenatal life at all \nstages of development; the protection of maternal health and safety; \nthe  elimination  of  particularly  gruesome  or  barbaric  medical \nprocedures;  the  preservation  of  the  integrity  of  the  medical \nprofession;  the  mitigation  of  fetal  pain;  and  the  prevention  of \ndiscrimination on the basis of race, sex, or disability.  \n \nDobbs, 142 S. Ct. at 2283–84 (cleaned up). \nConsidering this standard, Act 620 easily passes muster.  Indeed, this Court previously \ndetermined the statute did in fact pass rational basis review, for the following reasons: \nBut in considering the similar Mississippi statute, the Court of \nAppeals in [Jackson Women’s Health Org. v. Currier, 760 F.3d 448, \n453 (5th Cir. 2014),] held that, \n \n[O]ur court in [Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex. \nSurgical Health Servs. v. Abbott (“Abbott II”), 748 \nF.3d 583 (5th Cir. 2014), reh’g & reh’g en banc \ndenied, 769 F.3d 330 (5th Cir. 2014)] has addressed \nthe rational basis of a virtually identical law, and we \nare  bound  by  that  precedent  to  accept  that  the \nMississippi statute has a rational basis. . . .  [W]e … \nheld that the Texas regulation satisfied a rational \nbasis review because it was based on the rational \nspeculation that it would ‘assist in preventing patient \nabandonment’ by the doctor providing the abortion. \nWe see no basis for distinguishing the rational basis \nof  [Mississippi]  H.B.  1390.  None  of  the  other \nrationales discussed in Abbott [II] was state specific, \nand each would be equally applicable to H.B. 1390. \nAccordingly, we hold that H.B. 1390 satisfies the \nrational basis review upon our binding precedent in \nAbbott [II].  \n \nCurrier, 760 F.3d at 454 (footnote omitted). \n \nThis Court is likewise bound by this precedent and therefore finds \nthat Act 620 passes rational basis review. Accordingly, Defendant’s \nMotion for Partial Summary Judgment is granted in part. The issue \n26 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 505    11/14/22   Page 27 of 28\nof medical reasonableness – as it pertains to the issue of Act 620’s \nrational review – is decided as a matter of law. \n \n(Doc. 138 at 18.)  The same reasoning applies here to warrant upholding Act 620. \n   \n  Plaintiffs complain that the facts on the ground have changed and that this justification is \nno longer viable.  Plaintiffs urge that there is a near complete ban on abortions in this state and that \nconsequently Act 620 will serve no purpose. \nThe Court rejects this argument for two reasons.  First, as Defendant points out, Plaintiffs \nprovide virtually no evidence in support of their factual assertions about how many abortions are \nor are not conducted in Louisiana, and where those abortions take place.  Thus, even if the Court \nwere inclined to delve into the facts, it would not have an adequate basis for doing so. \nBut, second, and more fundamentally, Plaintiffs’ position runs afoul of Dobbs.  There, the \nSupreme Court again requires only that the law “be sustained if there is a rational basis on which \nthe legislature could have thought that it would serve legitimate state interests.” Dobbs, 142 S. Ct. \nat 2284.  Dobbs specifically lists as such interests “the protection of maternal health and safety” \nand the “preservation of the integrity of the medical profession.” Id. Given the “strong presumption \nof validity” and the Dobbs court’s admonition that “courts cannot ‘substitute their social and \neconomic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies,’ ” id. at 2284, this Court cannot find that \nAct 620 lacks a rational basis. \n  For all these reasons, the Court finds that it is no longer equitable to maintain the permanent \ninjunction in this case in the post-Dobbs legal regime.  As a result, the injunction will be vacated. \nV.  Conclusion \nAccordingly,  \n \n \n27 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB     Document 505    11/14/22   Page 28 of 28\nIT IS ORDEREDthat the Defendant’s Renewed Emergency Rule 60(b) Motion to Vacate \nPermanent Injunction (Doc. 501) is GRANTED.  The permanent injunction (Doc. 274, 275) \nentered in this case baring the enforcement of Act 620 and its regulations is hereby VACATED. \nSigned in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on November 14, 2022. \nS\nJUDGE JOHN W. deGRAVELLES\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nMIDDLE DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA\n28 ",

The  district  court  denied \nLouisiana’s requests for a temporary stay and a stay pending appeal, and \n\n      Case: 16-30116      Document: 00513394653     Page: 2     Date Filed: 02/24/2016\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 239    02/25/16   Page 3 of 16\nNo. 16-30116 \nLouisiana immediately filed in this court an emergency motion to stay the \ndistrict court’s preliminary injunction pending the resolution of Louisiana’s \nappeal. We GRANT the motion for a stay pending appeal. \nI. \nOn June 12, 2014, the Governor of Louisiana signed into law Act 620, \nwhich in relevant part amended Louisiana’s abortion laws to require that \nphysicians performing abortions must “[h]ave active admitting privileges at a \nhospital that is located not further than thirty miles from the location at \nwhich the abortion is performed or induced and that provides obstetrical or \ngynecological health care services.” The Unsafe Abortion Protection Act of \n2014 La. Sess. Law Serv. Act 620 (H.B. 388).1 \nThe  Act  was  scheduled  to  go  into  effect  on  September  1,  2014. \nPlaintiffs2 filed this lawsuit on August 22, 2014, arguing that the Act violated \n                                         \n1 The law amended by Act 620 was La. R.S. § 40:1299.35.2, which was subsequently \nrecodified  as  La.  R.S.  §  40:1061.10.  We  refer  to  the  challenged  admitting-privileges \nrequirement in all its forms as the Act. \n2 Plaintiffs-Appellees are abortion providers in Louisiana. June Medical Services, \nL.L.C., doing business as Hope Medical Group for Women (Hope), is an abortion clinic in \nShreveport. Bossier City Medical Suite (Bossier) is an abortion clinic in Bossier City. Choice \nIncorporated  of  Texas,  doing  business  as  Causeway  Medical  Clinic  (Causeway),  is  an \nabortion clinic in Metairie. John Doe 1 is a physician in Family Medicine and Addiction \nMedicine who performs abortions at Hope. Doe 1 has not obtained admitting privileges \nwithin  thirty  miles  of  Hope.  John  Doe  2  is  an  obstetrician-gynecologist  who  performs \nabortions at Bossier and Causeway. Doe 2 has not obtained admitting privileges within \nthirty miles of Bossier but has obtained conditional privileges at a hospital within thirty \nmiles of Causeway. \nThe other two abortion clinics in Louisiana are Women’s Health Care Center, Inc. \n(WHCC) and Delta Clinic of Baton Rouge, Inc. (Delta), which operate in New Orleans and \nBaton  Rouge,  respectively.  John  Doe  5  is  an  obstetrician-gynecologist  who  performs \nabortions at WHCC and Delta. He has obtained admitting privileges within thirty miles of \nWHCC but not within thirty miles of Delta. John Doe 6 is an obstetrician-gynecologist who \nperforms abortions at WHCC. Doe 6 has not obtained admitting privileges within thirty \nmiles of WHCC. WHCC, Delta, Doe 5, and Doe 6 filed a separate complaint and motion for \npreliminary injunction, but voluntarily dismissed their claims after they were consolidated \nwith the instant lawsuit. \nThe other two physicians in Louisiana who perform abortions have not been part of \nthis lawsuit. John Doe 3 is an obstetrician-gynecologist who is the medical director of Hope \n2 \n\n      Case: 16-30116      Document: 00513394653     Page: 3     Date Filed: 02/24/2016\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 239    02/25/16   Page 4 of 16\nNo. 16-30116 \ntheir and their patients’ procedural and substantive due process rights and \nseeking injunctive relief.3 The district court issued a temporary restraining \norder which permitted the Act to go into effect but exempted Plaintiffs from \nbeing subject to the Act’s penalties and sanctions for practicing without the \nrelevant admitting privileges while they continued to seek those admitting \nprivileges. \nTen months later, the district court conducted a six-day bench trial. \nSeven  months  thereafter,  the  district  court  issued  findings  of  fact  and \nconclusions of law, followed by entry of judgment two weeks later in favor of \nPlaintiffs.4 The district court first found that the Act passed rational basis \nreview because it was rationally related to a legitimate state interest.  \nThe  district  court  then  applied  the  two-part  undue  burden  test \nannounced in Planned Parenthood  of Southeastern Pennsylvania  v. Casey, \nwhich  asks  whether  a  regulation  has  the  purpose  or  effect  of  placing  an \nundue burden on a woman’s access to abortion. 505 U.S. 833, 877 (1992). As \nto the first prong, the district court found that Plaintiffs had not established \nthat  the  Act  has  an  improper  purpose  under  existing  precedent.  On  the \nsecond prong, however, the district court concluded that the Act “will have \nthe effect of placing an undue burden on (i.e. placing a substantial obstacle in \nthe path of) a large fraction of Louisiana women of reproductive age seeking \nan  abortion.”  June  Med.  Servs.,  LLC  v.  Kliebert,  No.  14-cv-525,  2016  WL \n                                                                                                                                   \nand performs abortions there. He has admitting privileges at two hospitals within thirty \nmiles  of  Hope.  John  Doe  4  is  an  obstetrician-gynecologist  who  performs  abortions  at \nCauseway, but he does not have admitting privileges within thirty miles of Causeway. \n3 Plaintiffs sued the Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals \nin her official capacity, which is another way of suing Louisiana itself. See, e.g., Hafer v. \nMelo, 502 U.S. 21, 25 (1991) (“Suits against state officials in their official capacity therefore \nshould  be  treated  as  suits  against  the  State.”).  We  refer  to  Defendant-Appellant  as \nLouisiana. \n4 The temporary restraining order was extended through these proceedings and was \nin effect for approximately eighteen months. \n3 \n\n      Case: 16-30116      Document: 00513394653     Page: 4     Date Filed: 02/24/2016\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 239    02/25/16   Page 5 of 16\nNo. 16-30116 \n320942, at *48 (M.D. La. Jan. 26, 2016). On the basis of these findings, the \ndistrict court declared the Act to be unconstitutional and entered a judgment \nenjoining enforcement of the Act as to Plaintiffs. \nThe day judgment was entered, Louisiana appealed the injunction and \nmoved  the  district  court  to  stay  its  judgment  pending  appeal  and  to \ntemporarily stay the judgment. The district court denied the temporary stay \nthat afternoon and denied the motion to stay pending appeal six days later. \nLouisiana immediately filed in this court an emergency motion to stay the \ninjunction pending appeal. That motion is now before this panel.  \nII. \nWe  note  as  a  preliminary  matter  that  the  physician  plaintiffs  have \nstanding  to  assert  the  rights  of  their  prospective  patients.  The  Supreme \nCourt has held that physicians who perform abortions satisfy the test for \nthird-party  standing  even  when  they  are  not  threatened  with  immediate \nprosecution under  state abortion regulations. Singleton  v. Wulff, 428 U.S. \n106, 117–18 (1976); Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179, 188 (1973). At least one of \nthe physicians here—Doe 1—has third-party standing because he has not \nobtained admitting privileges and may be subject to criminal prosecution for \nviolating  the  Act;5  because  “doctors  who  perform  abortions  share  a \nsufficiently close relationship with their patients”; and because “a pregnant \nwoman seeking to assert her right to abortion faces obvious hindrances in \ntimely . . . bringing a lawsuit to fruition.” See Planned Parenthood of Greater \nTex. Surgical Health Servs. v. Abbott (Abbott II), 748 F.3d 583, 589 (5th Cir. \n2014) (citing Kowalski v. Tesmer, 543 U.S. 125, 129–30 (2004)). Because Doe \n1 has standing to challenge the Act, we need not determine whether Doe 2 or \nthe clinics suffer an “actual or imminent, not ‘conjectural’ or ‘hypothetical’” \n                                         \n5 La. R.S. §§ 40:1061.10, 40:1061.29. \n4 \n\n      Case: 16-30116      Document: 00513394653     Page: 5     Date Filed: 02/24/2016\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 239    02/25/16   Page 6 of 16\nNo. 16-30116 \ninjury and have standing as well. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. \n555, 560 (1992) (citation omitted).6 \nWe consider four factors in deciding whether to grant a stay pending \nappeal: “(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is \nlikely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably \ninjured  absent  a  stay;  (3)  whether  issuance  of  the  stay  will  substantially \ninjure the other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public \ninterest lies.” Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex. Surgical Health Servs. v. \nAbbott (Abbott I), 734 F.3d 406, 410 (5th Cir. 2013) (quoting Nken v. Holder, \n556 U.S. 418, 425–26 (2009)), application to vacate stay denied, 134 S. Ct. 506 \n(2013).  “A stay ‘is  not a matter of  right, even if irreparable injury might \notherwise result to the appellant.’” Id. (quoting Nken, 556 U.S. at 427). \nIII. \nWe begin by considering whether Louisiana has made a strong showing \nthat it is likely to succeed on the merits. We conclude that it has. \nA. \nWe  have  twice  considered  facial  challenges  to  a  nearly  identical \nadmitting-privileges  requirement  recently  enacted  in  Texas.7  We  first \nconsidered  whether  a  stay  of  the  district  court’s  injunction  against  the \nrequirement was appropriate. Because we concluded that Texas was likely to \nsucceed  on  the  merits  by  showing  the  plaintiffs  had  not  proven  the \nrequirement  placed  an  undue  burden  on  women  seeking  an  abortion,  we \nstayed the injunction. Abbott I, 734 F.3d at 416. When we considered the \n                                         \n6 We noted in Abbott II that “there may be a point at which the doctor’s interests \nbegin to conflict with his patients. For example, the doctor’s economic incentives regarding \nthe performance of abortions may not always align with a woman’s right to choose to have \nan abortion.” 748 F.3d at 589 n.9. \n7 The Texas law required that a physician performing an abortion have admitting \nprivileges at a hospital within thirty miles of the location the abortion is performed. Abbott \nI, 734 F.3d at 409. \n5 \n\n      Case: 16-30116      Document: 00513394653     Page: 6     Date Filed: 02/24/2016\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 239    02/25/16   Page 7 of 16\nNo. 16-30116 \nsame lawsuit on its merits, we reversed the district court and permitted the \nlaw to go into effect because the plaintiffs had not demonstrated that the law \nplaced an undue burden on a large fraction of women. Abbott II, 748 F.3d at \n590.8  \nThe  Supreme  Court’s  jurisprudence  on  abortion  regulation  is \ncomplicated. When the Court first recognized the right to access to abortion, \nit  concluded  that  the  “right  of  privacy,  whether  it  is  founded  in  the \nFourteenth Amendment’s concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon \nstate  action  [or]  in  the  Ninth  Amendment’s  reservation  of  rights  to  the \npeople, is broad enough to encompass a woman’s decision whether or not to \nterminate her pregnancy.” Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 153 (1973). In Casey, \nthe Court affirmed “the essential holding of Roe  v. Wade” while rejecting \nRoe’s trimester framework and replacing it with a test based on viability of \nthe fetus. Casey, 505 U.S. at 874, 876. After the point in a pregnancy where \nthe  fetus  is  likely  viable  if  born,  the  state  may  regulate  the  provision  of \nabortions to protect its interest “in protecting fetal life or potential life.” Id. \nBefore  viability,  the  state  may  regulate  abortion  provided  that  the  “state \nregulation  [does  not]  impose[]  an  undue  burden  on  a  woman’s  ability”  to \ndecide whether to carry her child to term. Id. at 874. “A finding of an undue \nburden  is  a  shorthand  for  the  conclusion  that  a  state  regulation  has  the \npurpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman \nseeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus.” Id. at 877. In Gonzales v. Carhart, \nthe Court added that the state must have a rational basis for its regulation. \n                                         \n8  We  also  recently  considered  a  lawsuit  challenging  Mississippi’s  admitting-\nprivileges requirement. Jackson Women’s Health Organization v. Currier, 760 F.3d 448 (5th \nCir. 2014). In Jackson Women’s Health, we held only that Mississippi’s regulation was \n“unconstitutional as applied” to the plaintiff clinic, which was the only abortion clinic in \nMississippi. 760 F.3d at 450. By contrast, the present challenge seeks, as the challenge \nconsidered in Abbott I and Abbott II sought, facial invalidation. \n6 \n\n      Case: 16-30116      Document: 00513394653     Page: 7     Date Filed: 02/24/2016\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 239    02/25/16   Page 8 of 16\nNo. 16-30116 \n550  U.S.  124,  158  (2007)  (allowing  regulations  “where  [the  state]  has  a \nrational basis to act, and it does not impose an undue burden”).  \nIn our recent cases considering abortion regulations, we acknowledged \nthat states have important interests in protecting the integrity and ethics of \nthe  medical  profession  and  in  protecting  the  health  of  women  seeking \nabortions.  Abbott  I,  734  F.3d  at  413.  We  reiterated  the  Supreme  Court’s \ncommand that “the fact that a law which serves a valid purpose, one not \ndesigned to strike at the right itself, has the incidental effect of making it \nmore difficult or more expensive to procure an abortion cannot be enough to \ninvalidate it.” Id. at 413 (quoting Casey, 505 U.S. at 874). In Abbott II, we \nmade clear that the burden falls on the plaintiffs to show a regulation unduly \nburdens a large fraction of women. 748 F.3d at 598.  At this stage of the \nlitigation, we must consider whether Louisiana is likely to succeed on the \nmerits by showing that Plaintiffs have not met their burden. \nB. \nPlaintiffs  have  brought  only  a  facial  challenge  to  the  Act.9  “Such  a \nchallenge ‘impose[s] a heavy burden upon the part[y] maintaining the suit.’” \nAbbott  I,  734  F.3d  at  414  (quoting  Gonzales,  550  U.S.  at  167).  Gonzales \nrecognized “diverging views as to ‘what that burden consists of in the specific \ncontext of abortion statutes.’” Id. at 414 (quoting Gonzales, 550 U.S. at 167). \nIn Barnes v. Mississippi, we followed “standard principles of constitutional \nadjudication” that “require courts to engage in facial invalidation only if no \npossible application of the challenged law would be constitutional.” Abbott II, \n                                         \n9  In  their  complaint,  Plaintiffs  asked  the  district  court  to  “declare  [the  Act] \nunconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.” In \ntheir proposed findings of fact, Plaintiffs wrote that they “seek a preliminary injunction \nagainst [the Act] in all of its applications. In other words, Plaintiffs seek facial relief.” \nPlaintiffs now characterize the district court’s injunction order as a grant of as-applied \nrelief, but in that very document the district court wrote, “Plaintiffs state emphatically that \nthey are not making an ‘as-applied’ challenge and that their only challenge is facial.” \n7 \n\n      Case: 16-30116      Document: 00513394653     Page: 8     Date Filed: 02/24/2016\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 239    02/25/16   Page 9 of 16\nNo. 16-30116 \n748 F.3d at 588 (citing Barnes v. Mississippi, 992 F.2d 1335, 1342 (5th Cir. \n1993)); accord United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987) (In a facial \nchallenge, “the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exist \nunder which the Act would be valid.”). In Casey, however, the controlling \nplurality  held  that  an  abortion  regulation  would  be  invalid  if  “in  a  large \nfraction of the cases in which [it] is relevant, it will operate as a substantial \nobstacle  to  a  woman’s  choice  to  undergo  an  abortion.”  505  U.S.  at  895 \n(emphasis added). In its most recent consideration of an abortion regulation, \nthe Court recognized both standards and declined to choose between them \nbecause the law at issue was permissible under either standard. Gonzales, \n550 U.S. at 167–68 (“We need not resolve that debate.”). As in Abbott I and \nAbbott II, we do the same here and “apply the ‘large fraction’ nomenclature \nfor the sake of argument only, without casting doubt on the general rule.” \nAbbott  II,  748  F.3d  at  588–89;  see  also  Abbott  I,  734  F.3d  at  414.  Even \nassuming arguendo that the test from Salerno and Barnes is not binding on \nthis panel, which we do not suggest, Louisiana has a strong likelihood of \nsuccess in showing that Plaintiffs have failed to establish an undue burden \non women seeking abortions under the less-strenuous large-fraction test. \nThe district court concluded that the Act has a rational basis and that \nLouisiana did not have an improper purpose in passing the Act. June Med. \nServs., 2016 WL 320942, at *47. We agree and Plaintiffs do not challenge \nthese  findings.  Louisiana,  therefore,  need  only  demonstrate  a  strong \nlikelihood of success in establishing that Plaintiffs did not prove that the Act \nhas the effect of placing an undue burden on a large fraction of women who \ncould otherwise seek an abortion absent the Act. See Abbott I, 734 F.3d at \n414. Application of the large-fraction test to the evidence before us supports \nLouisiana’s position that the evidence at trial was insufficient to show that a \n8 \n\n      Case: 16-30116      Document: 00513394653     Page: 9     Date Filed: 02/24/2016\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 239    02/25/16   Page 10 of 16\nNo. 16-30116 \nlarge  fraction  of  women  seeking  abortions  would  face  an  undue  burden \nbecause of the Act. \nThe district court concluded that the Act imposed an undue burden \nbased on sua sponte statistical analyses. First, the district court subtracted \nthe  number  of  abortions  performed  by  physicians  who  have  admitting \nprivileges (5,500) from the total number of  women of reproductive age in \nLouisiana (938,719) and divided the result by the total number of women of \nreproductive  age  in  Louisiana,  concluding  that  the  Act  will  leave  99%  of \nLouisiana women unable to get an abortion. Second, in the alternative, the \ncourt divided the number of abortions performed in clinics that may have to \nclose  because  the  physicians  in  those  clinics  do  not  yet  have  admitting \nprivileges at a hospital within thirty miles10 by the total number of abortions \nperformed in Louisiana (9,976). The district court first concluded that only \nDoe 5 would continue to provide abortions (2,950)11 in Louisiana and that, as \na result, 70% of women would lack access to an abortion. In the alternative, \nthe district court concluded 55% of women would lack access if only Doe 3 \n(1,500) and Doe 5 continue to provide abortions. Only as a final alternative \ndid it conclude that 45% of women seeking an abortion may lack access if Doe \n2 (1,000), Doe 3, and Doe 5 continue to offer abortions. June Med. Servs., \n2016 WL 320942, at *38.  \n                                         \n10 If the district court is correct that the Act’s implementation will result in the \nclosure of those clinics where no physician currently has admitting privileges at a hospital \nwithin thirty miles, then Bossier and Delta will close. Bossier is located in Bossier City, \napproximately six miles from the clinic in Shreveport (Hope), which will not be forced to \nclose as a result of the Act. Delta is located in Baton Rouge, approximately seventy-eight \nmiles from the clinic in New Orleans (WHCC), which will not be forced to close as a result \nof the Act. The clinic in Metairie (Causeway) also will not be forced to close as a result of \nthe Act.  \n11 We note that neither Doe 5 nor the clinic in which he works testified as to his \ncapacity. The district court reached Doe 5’s capacity based on the testimony of Doe 3. June \nMed. Servs., No. 3:14-cv-525, 2016 WL 617444, at *9 (M. D. La. Feb. 16, 2016). \n9 \n\n      Case: 16-30116      Document: 00513394653     Page: 10     Date Filed: 02/24/2016\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 239    02/25/16   Page 11 of 16\nNo. 16-30116 \nLouisiana is likely to succeed in showing that these calculations are \nneither sufficient nor sufficiently reliable for Plaintiffs to establish an undue \nburden on a large fraction of Louisiana women. We begin with the district \ncourt’s conclusion that the Act deprives 99% of Louisiana women of access to \nan  abortion.  This  calculation  is  misleading  because  it  does  not  actually \nmeasure the effects of the Act. According to the district court’s methodology, \n99% of Louisiana women had no access to an abortion before the Act was \npassed and 99% of Louisiana women will have no access to an abortion after \nthe Act goes into effect.12 Abbott I makes clear that the limited capacity that \nmay exist before a regulation is passed cannot be ascribed to that regulation \nas part of the large-fraction analysis. 734 F.3d at 415. In prior cases, we have \nfaulted  plaintiffs  for  using  an  incorrect  denominator  in  their  attempts  to \nestablish that a large fraction of women are unduly burdened;13 here the \ndistrict  court  erred  by  using  an  incorrect  numerator.  These  two  errors \nproduce the same absurd outcome—they “always result[] in a large fraction.” \nLakey, 769 F.3d at 299. \nWe next examine the district court’s alternative statistical finding that \nthe Act would deprive 70% of Louisiana women actually seeking an abortion \nof access to one. The district court reached this percentage by assuming that \n                                         \n12 According to the district court’s equation, before the Act, 98.937% of women in \nLouisiana  had  no  access  to  abortion  (because  only  9,976  of  the  938,719  women  of \nreproductive age in Louisiana received an abortion). After the Act, according to the district \ncourt’s equation, 99.521% of women in Louisiana would have no access to abortion (because \nonly 5,500 of 938,719 women of reproductive age in Louisiana could receive an abortion). \nUsing this methodology, the Act affects only 0.584% of Louisiana women of reproductive \nage—certainly not a large fraction. \n13 See, e.g., Whole Woman’s Health v. Lakey, 769 F.3d 285, 299 (5th Cir.) (“Plaintiffs \nargue that the appropriate denominator in the large faction analysis consists only of women \n‘who  could  have  accessed  abortion  services  in  Texas  prior  to  implementation  of  the \nchallenged requirements, but who will face increased obstacles as a result of the law.’ To \nnarrow the denominator in this way—to essentially only those women who Plaintiffs argue \nwill face an undue burden—ignores precedent.”), vacated in part, 135 S. Ct. 399 (2014). \n10 \n\n      Case: 16-30116      Document: 00513394653     Page: 11     Date Filed: 02/24/2016\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 239    02/25/16   Page 12 of 16\nNo. 16-30116 \nDoe 5 will be the only abortion provider in Louisiana after the Act takes \neffect. This assumption is contrary to the undisputed evidence that Doe 3 and \nDoe 2 already have admitting privileges that satisfy the Act.  The district \ncourt erroneously excluded them because Doe 3 suggested, in hypothetical \nterms,  that  he  might  close  his  practice  and  because  Doe  2  continues  to \nchallenge  Louisiana’s  admission  that  his  privileges  satisfy  the  Act.  The \ndistrict court erred by excluding Doe 2 and Doe 3 on these bases. Doe 3’s \ntestimony that he may close his practice if he is the last provider in the state \nis purely hypothetical. Furthermore, Doe 3’s hypothetical decision to close his \npractice would result from his own choice rather than the requirements of the \nAct. Because he has admitting privileges that satisfy the Act, the district \ncourt should not have assumed in its calculations that the Act would cause \nhim to cease providing abortions. See Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 599 (describing \ndoctors’  decisions  to  leave  Texas  for  New  York  and  to  stop  performing \nabortions out of concern for future legislation as “entirely unrelated to” the \nchallenged abortion regulation); Abbott I, 734 F.3d at 415 (noting that the \n“many  factors  other  than  the  hospital-admitting-privileges  requirement \n[that]  would  affect  the  availability  of  physicians  to  perform  abortion,” \nincluding the proximity of several doctors to retirement age, should not be \npart of the analysis). \nWhen, in the alternative, the district court contemplated only Doe 5 \nand Doe 3 continuing to practice, the court calculated that 55% of women \nseeking an abortion may be affected. This calculation, too, is fatally flawed \nbecause it presumes that Doe 2’s conditional privileges do not satisfy the \nAct’s  requirement  of  “active  admitting  privileges.”  La.  R.S.  §  40:1061.10. \n11 \n\n      Case: 16-30116      Document: 00513394653     Page: 12     Date Filed: 02/24/2016\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 239    02/25/16   Page 13 of 16\nNo. 16-30116 \nLouisiana  has  repeatedly  conceded  that  Doe  2’s  conditional  privileges14 \nsatisfy  the  Act’s  requirements.  Indeed,  Louisiana’s  Secretary  of  the \nDepartment  of  Health  and  Hospitals—the  state  official  charged  with \nenforcement of the Act—has entered an affidavit affirming the validity of Doe \n2’s privileges. It  would be improper for this  court  or the district court to \npresume  to  instruct  Louisiana  on  the  proper  application  of  its  laws.  See \nPennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 106 (1984) (“[I]t is \ndifficult to think of a greater intrusion on state sovereignty than when a \nfederal court instructs state officials on how to conform their conduct to state \nlaw.”).  Because  Louisiana  confirms  that  Doe  2’s  conditional  admitting \nprivileges satisfy the Act, we accept for purposes of this motion that Doe 2 \ncan continue to perform abortions. Therefore the district court’s conclusion \nthat 55% of women seeking abortions may lack access is baseless.  \nFinally, we consider the district court’s approach assuming that if only \nDoes 2, 3, and 5 continue to practice, 45% of women seeking an abortion may \nlack  access.  Plaintiffs  did  not  introduce  expert  testimony  to  support  the \ndistrict court’s many alternate large-fraction conclusions. Plaintiffs’ expert \noffered  no specific  testimony as to  the number or location of  women who \nwould potentially be affected. The actual calculation was performed by the \ndistrict  court  based  on  raw  numbers  drawn  from  disparate  testimony. \nLouisiana’s uncontroverted expert testimony demonstrates that, even if Does \n2, 3, and 5 are the only abortion providers in the state, well more than 90% of \nLouisiana women will live within 150 miles of two operating clinics. See, e.g., \nAbbott  I,  734  F.3d  at  415;  Abbott  II,  748  F.3d  at  597–98.  Louisiana  also \n                                         \n14 Tulane Medical Center has granted Doe 2 privileges to admit “patients from the \nphysician’s clinical practice with complications of first and second trimester abortions with \nreferral of those patients to an attending physician on the Tulane staff credentialed for \nOB/Gyn privileges who has agreed to provide for such care for the physician’s patients.” \nJune Med. Servs., 2016 WL 320942, at *29.  \n12 \n\n      Case: 16-30116      Document: 00513394653     Page: 13     Date Filed: 02/24/2016\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 239    02/25/16   Page 14 of 16\nNo. 16-30116 \ncontests the district court’s conclusions on other grounds, suggesting: (1) the \ndistrict court incorrectly discounted evidence that the physicians who have \nadmitting  privileges  can  perform  substantially  more  abortions  than  they \ncurrently do; and (2) the district court failed to account for the significant \nnumber of women who travel to Louisiana to receive an abortion and may not \nbe relevant to the large-fraction analysis. Louisiana ultimately argues that as \nfew as 9.7% of Louisiana women seeking an abortion may lack access under \nthe Act.15 \nPuzzlingly,  in  their  response,  Plaintiffs  do  not  seriously  contest \nLouisiana’s criticisms of the district court’s sua sponte calculations. Likewise, \nthey  fail  to  grapple  with  this  court’s  prior  precedent  upholding  similar \nadmitting-privileges requirements against facial challenges.16 This is so even \nthough  Plaintiffs  sought  and  were  granted  additional  time  to  respond. \nInstead, Plaintiffs argue that the large-fraction test, which is the basis for the \ninjunction they ask us to uphold, is “irrelevant.”17  \n                                         \n15 To the extent that Plaintiffs rely on the specific concerns of a subset of Louisiana \nwomen seeking abortions, those concerns are more properly the subject of an as-applied \nchallenge. See Gonzales, 550 U.S. at 167 (“[An as-applied challenge] is the proper manner to \nprotect the  health  of  the  woman  if  it  can  be  shown that  in  discrete  and  well-defined \ninstances [the challenged law would create an undue burden].”); Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 604–\n05 (“Facial challenges impose a ‘“heavy burden” upon the parties maintaining the suit’ \nbecause there is often too little evidence to show that a particular condition has in fact \noccurred or is very likely to occur. That is the case here. We follow in the Supreme Court’s \nfootsteps  by  noting  that  in  an  as-applied  challenge,  which  is  the  proper  means  of \nchallenging the lack of an exception to the regulations at issue, ‘the nature of the medical \nrisk can be better quantified and balanced than in a facial attack.’”) (citing Gonzales, 550 \nU.S. at 167). \n16 Plaintiffs emphasize in their brief that the Supreme Court is about to hear oral \nargument in Whole Women’s Health v. Hellerstedt, No. 15-274. The questions presented in \nthat case involve the proper role in Casey’s undue burden test of the state’s interest and \npurpose in promoting health as they relate to the effects of a law regulating abortions. \nThose issues are not implicated here, where the district court found—and the parties do not \ncontest on appeal—that Louisiana’s interest in protecting women is legitimate and the \npurpose of the Unsafe Abortion Protection Act is proper. \n17 Plaintiffs argue the large-fraction test is not relevant because the district court \nruled on an as-applied challenge. We disagree. Plaintiffs asked for facial invalidation of the \n13 \n\n      Case: 16-30116      Document: 00513394653     Page: 14     Date Filed: 02/24/2016\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 239    02/25/16   Page 15 of 16\nNo. 16-30116 \nLouisiana is likely to prevail in its argument that Plaintiffs failed to \nestablish  an  undue  burden  on  women  seeking  abortions  or  that  the  Act \ncreates a substantial obstacle in the path of a large fraction of women seeking \nan abortion. \nIV. \n  For the same reasons as in Abbott I, Louisiana has made an adequate \nshowing as to the remaining factors considered in determining whether to \ngrant a stay pending appeal: \nWhen  a  statute  is  enjoined,  the  State  necessarily  suffers  the \nirreparable  harm  of  denying  the  public  interest  in  the \nenforcement of its laws. As the State is the appealing party, its \ninterest  and  harm  merges  with  that  of  the  public.  While  we \nacknowledge that [Plaintiffs have] also made a strong showing \nthat their interests would be harmed by staying the injunction, \ngiven the State’s likely success on the merits, this is not enough, \nstanding alone, to outweigh the other factors. \nAbbott I, 734 F.3d at 419 (citations omitted). Nor does the existence of a prior \ntemporary  restraining  order,  designed  to  allow  physicians  time  to  obtain \nadmitting privileges while the Act went into effect, undermine the necessity \nof the stay.18 Cf. Abbott II, 748 F.3d at 600 (upholding admitting privileges \n                                                                                                                                   \nAct  at  every  stage  of  this  litigation.  The  district  court  cited  the  criteria  for  facial \ninvalidation of a statute and held “[t]he active admitting-privileges requirement of La. R.S. \n§ 40:1299.35.2 is declared unconstitutional as violating the substantive due process rights \nof Louisiana women seeking abortions.” June Med. Servs., 2016 WL 320942, at *53. Finally, \nthe record does not contain the discrete and specific evidence required to maintain an as-\napplied challenge. We note that our decision today does not foreclose future as-applied \nchallenges. As we observed in Abbott II, “the proper means to consider exceptions [to an \nabortion regulation] is by as-applied challenge.” 748 F.3d at 604 (quoting Gonzalez, 550 \nU.S. at 167). \n18 Plaintiffs also argue that we should deny a stay because the Supreme Court “has \ntwice intervened to prevent Texas from shuttering the majority of its abortion facilities \nduring the pendency of litigation and it will hear arguments in that case in two weeks,” \nfrom which Plaintiffs draw the conclusion that “[t]here is a substantial likelihood that the \nSupreme Court would reverse any stay granted in this case, for the same reason.” Plaintiffs \nmisinterpret both the facts in our prior abortion cases and the Supreme Court’s rulings. In \nWhole Woman’s Health v. Lakey, 135 S. Ct. 399 (2014), the Court did not stay our ruling on \n14 \n\n      Case: 16-30116      Document: 00513394653     Page: 15     Date Filed: 02/24/2016\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 239    02/25/16   Page 16 of 16\nNo. 16-30116 \nrequirement but prohibiting its enforcement “against abortion providers who \napplied for admitting privileges within the grace period . . . but are awaiting \na response from a hospital”). \nWe have addressed only the issues necessary to rule on the motion for a \nstay pending appeal, and our determinations are for that purpose and do not \nbind the merits panel. \nIt is ORDERED that Louisiana’s emergency motion for a stay pending \nappeal is GRANTED, and the district court’s injunction is STAYED until the \nfinal disposition of this appeal, in accordance with this opinion.19 \n                                                                                                                                   \nthe facial challenge to Texas’s admitting-privileges requirement, and for the most part left \nin place our stay order allowing that requirement to go into effect pending appeal, only \nvacating our stay as it applied to two clinics. In any event, we have previously explained in \nregard to this precise order that “no guidance can be gleaned from the Supreme Court’s \nvacating portions of the stay without explanation, as we cannot discern the underlying \nreasoning from the one-paragraph order.” Cole, 790 F.3d at 580 (5th Cir. 2015). Moreover, \nin Abbott I, which is the most analogous to the present case, the Supreme Court denied in \nfull the motion to vacate our stay order. Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas Surgical \nHealth Servs. v. Abbott, 134 S. Ct. 506 (2013). \nUnder  our  rule  of  orderliness,  we  must  follow  our  own  precedent  absent  an \nintervening change in the law. Allen v. Stephens, 805 F.3d 617, 632–33 (5th Cir. 2015). \nUnder our precedent, Louisiana is entitled to a stay pending appeal. \n19 It is further ORDERED that the parties’ unopposed motions to place particular \nexhibits to its emergency stay motion under seal, pursuant to the stipulated protective \norder entered by the district court, are GRANTED. The merits panel may wish to revisit \nwhether materials under seal should continue to remain under seal, but that issue is \nbeyond the limited scope of this ruling on Louisiana’s emergency motion for a stay pending \nappeal. \n15 ",

Facts, Procedural History and Contentions of the Parties\nPlaintiffs  are  June  Medical  Services,  LLC  d/b/a  Hope  Medical  Group  for  Women\n(hereinafter “Hope”), Bossier City Medical Suite (“Bossier”), Choice, Inc., of Texas d/b/a Causeway\nMedical Clinic (“Choice”) and Drs. John Doe 1 and 2. Defendants are James David “Buddy”\nCaldwell, sued in his official capacity of the Attorney General of Louisiana; Dr. Jimmy  Guidry,\nsued in his official capacity as the Louisiana State Health Office and Medical Director; Kathy\nKliebert sued in her official capacity as the Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Health and\nHospitals (“DHH”);1 and Dr. Mark Dawson, sued in his official capacity as the President of the\nLouisiana State Board of Medical Examiners (“Board”). \n1 Secretary Kliebert was added as a defendant in an Amended Complaint. (Doc. 14.) \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 31    08/31/14   Page 3 of 19\nOn August 22, 2014, Plaintiffs filed a Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (Doc.\n1) and an Application for Temporary Restraining Order and Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Doc.\n5) seeking to enjoin Defendants from enforcing Section (A)(2)(a) of La. House Bill 388, Regular\nSession (La. 2014), Act 620 (hereinafter “Act 620\" or the “Act”). (Doc. 5-2, p.1.) This Act is\ncodified at La. Rev. Stat. § 40:1299.35.2. Section A(2)(a) requires every doctor who performs\nabortions in Louisiana to have “active admitting privileges” at a hospital within 30 miles of the\nfacility where abortions are performed. (Doc. 5-2, p. 3.) While this Act contains other requirements,\nthis provision is the only one being challenged. (Doc 5-1, p. 8, note 1.) Act 620 was signed into law\non June12, 2014. Its effective date is September 1, 2014. (Doc. 5-2, p. 6.) \nPlaintiffs Hope, Bossier and Choice are three of five licensed abortion clinics in Louisiana.\nThey are located in Shreveport, Bossier City and Metairie respectively. Drs. Doe 1 and 3 perform\nabortions at Hope, Dr. Doe 2 performs abortions at Bossier and Choice and Dr. Doe 4 performs\nabortions at Choice.2 \nPlaintiffs allege that, following June 12, 2014, the date the Act was signed into law by the\nGovernor, Drs. Doe 1, 2 and 4 applied for admitting privileges at nearby hospitals in an effort to\ncomply with the Act. However, their applications are pending and, because the admission process\ncan take several months, there will have been no action taken on the applications at the time Act 620\nbecomes effective on September 1, 2014.  Dr. Doe 3 has admitting privileges at a hospital within\n30 miles of where he performs abortions but claims that, if the applications of Drs. 1, 2 and 4 are\ndenied and he is the only physician performing abortions at any of the three facilities, he will\ndiscontinue performing abortions due to fears for his personal safety.\n2 Drs. Doe 1 and 2 are plaintiffs; Drs. Doe 3 and 4 are not. A Protective Order was issued\nprotecting the identity of these doctors. (Doc. 24.) \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 31    08/31/14   Page 4 of 19\nBecause it is impossible for Drs. 1, 2 and 4 to comply with the admitting privileges\nrequirement before the Act’s effective date, they allege that, without an order enjoining enforcement\nof the Act, they will be exposed to a $4,000 per violation penalty3 and possible suspension or\nrevocation of their medical licenses by the Board4 despite the fact that they are attempting to comply\nwith the Act. Hope, Bossier and Choice argue that, for the same reason, they will be exposed to\nsuspension or loss of their clinic licenses.5 This, Plaintiffs argue, constitutes a violation of their\nconstitutional right to due process.\nIn addition, Plaintiffs allege that they have received some informal indication that the\napplications for active admitting privileges of some of the doctors may be denied6 and, if they are\ndenied, enforcement of the Act against them “will either drastically reduce or completely eliminate\nthe availability of legal abortion in the state...” (Doc 5-1, p. 22);  “will result in every doctor\ncurrently providing abortions at a clinic in Louisiana to stop providing those services...” (Doc. 5-1,\np. 6) and that “no other doctor in Louisiana would be able to provide abortion services as of\nSeptember 1...” (Doc 5-1, p. 18). Furthermore, Plaintiffs contend that enforcement would result in\n“the majority if not all” abortion clinics being unable to render services (Doc. 5-1, p. 25) and would\n“effectively eliminate all access to legal abortion in Louisiana” (Doc. 5-1, p. 26). \n3 La. R.S. 40:1299.35.2(A)(2)(c).\n4At the hearing on the Application for Temporary Restraining Order, counsel for Dr.\nMark Dawson, President of the Board, conceded that a physician’s violation of state law might\nbe considered “unprofessional conduct,” a grounds for the suspension or revocation of the\nphysician’s license. See LSA-R.S. Sections 37:1261.1 and  LSA-R.S. 37:1285(A)(13).\n5 LSA-R.S. 40:1299.35.2(A)(1) and LSA-R.S. 40:2175.6.\n6 Dr. Doe 1 states that he has been told by the Chairman of the Family Medicine\nDepartment of one of the hospitals where he has applied that his application for privileges has\nbeen “met with resistence.” (Decl. Dr. John Doe 1 Doc. 5-5, p. 2-3, ¶ 7.) The application is still\npending.\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 31    08/31/14   Page 5 of 19\nAttorney General Caldwell filed a Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12 (B)(1)\narguing that he has no connection with the enforcement of the Act. (Doc. 16.) Defendants Dr. Jimmy\nGuidry and Dr. Mark Dawson make similar arguments in their memoranda. (Docs. 18, 20.) \nOn the merits, Defendants first argue that a TRO is not warranted because they do not intend\nto enforce the new law against any physician whose applications for privileges is pending.\nSpecifically, Secretary of DHH Kliebert pledges that she will abide by the instructions of the U.S.\n5th Circuit in Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas v. Abbott, 748 F.3d 583, 600 (5th Cir. 2014) that\nan admitting privileges requirement cannot be enforced “against a physician who [has] applied for\nadmitting privileges during the law’s grace period but who [has] not yet received a response on that\napplication before the effective date of the law.” (Doc. 27, p. 3-4.)\nSimilarly, Dr. Dawson has filed a Declaration pledging that he will abide by Abbot’s\ninstructions not to enforce Act 620 but, in any event, the Board has no enforcement authority\nregarding this Act. Because Secretary Kliebert and President Dawson are pledging not to enforce\nthe Act against anyone whose application is pending, they argue there is no need nor justification\nfor a TRO since there is no “substantial threat of irreparable harm” from an authority attempting to\nenforce the Act. \nSecond, Defendants argue that even if the doctors’ applications are denied and Plaintiff\ndoctors are unable to perform abortions, there are two other abortion facilities and other doctors\nperforming abortions in Louisiana. Thus, Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that the enforcement\nof the Act would put an undue burden on or create a substantial obstacle to the Constitutional right\nof Louisiana women to receive  abortions. \nOn August 28, 2014, a hearing was held on the Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining\nOrder. All parties were present and participated. No evidence was offered by Plaintiffs other than\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 31    08/31/14   Page 6 of 19\nthe submission made with Plaintiffs’ Application. (Doc. 5.) No evidence was offered by Defendants\nprior to the hearing other than the Declaration of Kathy Kliebert. (Doc. 25.) After the hearing,\nSecretary Kliebert submitted a supplemental Declaration (Doc. 27) and Dr. Dawson submitted a\nDeclaration (Doc. 26). \nII. Proper Parties, Article III Standing and 11th Amendment Immunity\nAll Defendants other than Secretary Kliebert7 have raised the issue of whether they are\nproperly before the Court and whether there is Article III standing and/or Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity. Before a district can issue a TRO, it must first determine that it has Article III jurisdiction\nto do so. See, e.g., Doe v. Jindal, 2011 WL 3664496, *2 (M.D. La. 2011) (noting in the TRO context\nthat “jurisdiction ‘is a threshold issue that must be resolved before any federal court reaches the\nmerits of the case before it’”) (quoting Perez v. U.S., 312 F.3d 191, 194 (5th Cir. 2002)).\nIn its Motion to Dismiss, the Attorney General argues that he is not a proper party based on\nhis immunity under the Eleventh Amendment.8 He claims that the exception to this immunity\nprovided in Ex Parte Young9 does not apply because the Attorney General has “no connection” with\nthe enforcement of Act 620.10 Plaintiffs argue, on the other hand, that he has at least “some\n7 Secretary Kliebert concedes that, as the Secretary of DHH, she “is responsible by law\nfor enforcing Louisiana’s recently passed admitting privileges law, Act 620....” (Doc. 27, p. 2.)\n8 The Attorney General concedes that it received notice of this constitutional challenge to\nAct 620 for purposes of 28 U.S.C. Section 2403(b) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.1 and that he has the\ndiscretion to intervene in this case (Doc. 16-1, *3-4). However, during the the TRO hearing,\ncounsel for Mr. Caldwell stated that he did not intend to exercise that discretion. While Mr.\nCaldwell did not raise the issue of the Court’s lack of Article III jurisdiction, the Court finds that\njurisdiction is lacking because, for the reasons stated herein, the Attorney General lacks the\npower to enforce Act 620. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555 (1992); Doe v. Jindal.\nsupra *2.\n9 209 U.S. 123, 155-56 (1908). \n10 Id., at 158-59. Okpalobi v. Foster, 244 F.3d 405 (5th Cir. 2001). Secretary of DHH\nKathy Kliebert states in her declaration that DHH has the “primary authority” for enforcing the\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 31    08/31/14   Page 7 of 19\nconnection”11 by virtue of the broad powers granted to him in the Louisiana Constitution as the\nState’s chief legal officer. (Doc. 23, p. 10.) This argument was rejected in Doe v. Jindal, supra,\nwhere the Court found this broad power to be too “indirect and remote” to qualify the Attorney\nGeneral for the Ex Parte Young exception.12 This Court agrees. \nPlaintiffs contend that the Attorney General is given the right to prosecute regulatory\nviolations which, arguably, includes the violation of Act 620. Mr. Caldwell responds that the\nAttorney General only performs this task when asked to do by the regulatory body or when\nempowered to do so by statute or regulation. (Doc. 30.) Since he has not been asked by DHH to\nrepresent that agency and Act 620 does not empower the Attorney General to act on behalf of DHH\nin carrying out its mandate, the Court finds that the Attorney General does not have sufficient\nconnection to the enforcement of Act 620 to make applicable the Ex Parte Young exception. The\nCourt therefore grants the Attorney General’s Motion to Dismiss.\nDefendant Dr. Jimmy Guidry was sued in his capacity as Louisiana State Health Officer and\nMedical Director of the DHH. Based on the representation of counsel for Dr. Guidry that Dr. Guidry\nhas no decision making authority as to Act 620 which is independent from that of Secretary Kliebert,\ncounsel for Plaintiffs stated at the TRO Hearing that Plaintiffs did not object to Guidry’s dismissal.13\nAccordingly, the Court orders that Dr. Jimmy Guidry be dismissed. \nDefendant Dr. Dawson, the President of the Board, argues that he too has no power of\nenforcement of Act 620 and therefore should be dismissed.  The Board is authorized under a\nAct. (Doc. 27, p. 2.)\n11 Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. at 157. \n12 2011 WL 3664496 at *3.\n13 To the same effect, see Plaintiffs’ Reply Brief. ( Doc. 23, p.11.)\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 31    08/31/14   Page 8 of 19\nseparate section of Act 620 (La. R.S. 40:1299.35.2.1, regulating the use of drugs or chemicals in an\nabortion) to “take disciplinary action as authorized in R.S. 37:1261 et seq. or any other provision\nof law against a physician who violates any provision of this Section.” \nWhile there is no comparable provision in § 1299.35.2(A), the Board is empowered under\nLa. R.S. 37:1285A(13) to revoke or suspend a physician’s license for “unprofessional conduct.”  At\nthe TRO Hearing, counsel for Dr. Dawson conceded that, under this provision, the Board could\nsuspend or revoke a doctor’s license for the violation of any statute, including Act 620. The Court\nfinds that the ability to suspend or revoke a physician’s license is therefore a mechanism of\nenforcement of the Act and one not “so indirect and remote” as to render the Ex Parte Young\nexception inapplicable. \nFurthermore, under the Art. III standing analysis,14 the Court finds that the Board’s ability\nto suspend or revoke the license of Drs. Doe 1 and 2 could cause these Plaintiffs to suffer an “injury\nin fact,” that there is a causal connection between such Board action and the injury, and finally, that\nthe injury would be redressed by granting the injunction. See K.P. v. LeBlanc, 627 F.3d 115, 122-\n125 (5th Cir. 2010), which held that plaintiffs met all three elements of the test for Art. III standing\nagainst the Louisiana Patients’ Compensation Fund although the potential harm from not enjoining\nthe law was “not as concrete as some might be” and “not yet materialized.” 627 F.3d at 122.\nWhether the enforcement connection “arises out of the general law, or is specially created by the act\nitself, is not material so long as it exists.” Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 157 (1908) (quoted in\nLeBlanc, 627 F.3d at 124). Accordingly, Dr. Dawson’s 11th Amendment and Art. III challenges are\ndenied. \n14 See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555 (1992); Okpalobi v. Foster, 244 F.3d\n405, 425 (5th Cir. 2001)\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 31    08/31/14   Page 9 of 19\nIII. Temporary Restraining Order\nA. The Standard\nA temporary restraining order “is an extraordinary and drastic remedy, and should only be\ngranted when the movant has clearly carried the burden of persuasion.” Anderson v. Jackson, 556\nF.3d 351, 360 (5th Cir. 2009) (quotations omitted);  Lakedreams v. Taylor, 932 F.2d 1103, 1107 (5th\nCir.1991) (citing Miss. Power & Light Co. v. United Gas Pipe Line Co., 760 F.2d 618, 621 (5th\nCir.1985)).\nThe movant “must satisfy a cumulative burden of proving each of the four elements\nenumerated before a temporary restraining order … can be granted.” Clark v. Pritchard, 812 F.2d\n991, 993 (5th Cir. 1987). The four elements are well known: the movant bears the burden of clearly\nproving: (1) a substantial likelihood that plaintiff will prevail on the merits, (2) a substantial threat\nthat plaintiff will suffer irreparable injury if the injunction is not granted, (3) that the threatened\ninjury to plaintiff outweighs the threatened harm the injunction may do to defendant, and (4) that\ngranting the preliminary injunction will not disserve the public interest. Janvey v. Alguire, 647 F.3d\n585, 595 (5th Cir.2011); Women’s Med. Center of Nw. Houston v. Bell, 248 F.3d 411, 419, n. 15 (5th\nCir. 2001); Jackson Women’s Health Organization v. Currier, 2014 WL 3730467, *5 (5th Cir., July\n29, 2014), (quoting Hoover v. Morales, 164 F.3d 221, 224 (5th Cir. 1998)); see also generally Doe\nv. Jindal, 2011 WL 3664496, *2 (M.D. La. Aug. 19, 2011) (unpublished); Scott v. Livingston Parish\nSch. Bd., 548 F. Supp. 2d 265, 266-67 (M.D. La. 2008).\nB. Analysis \n“[F]or more than 40 years, it has been settled constitutional law that the Fourteenth\nAmendment protects a woman’s basic right to choose an abortion.” Jackson Women’s Health\nOrganization v. Currier, ___ F.3d ____, 2014 WL 3730467, *4, (5th Cir. July 29, 2014), Petition\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 31    08/31/14   Page 10 of 19\nfor Rehearing en Banc pending, No. 13-60599 (5th Cir. August 13, 2014), citing Roe v. Wade, 410\nU.S. 113, 153 (1973) (hereinafter “Currier IV”15). The Supreme Court has also held that this right\ncan be regulated by a state consistent with the state’s interest in protecting potential life and health\nas long as the regulation does not place an “‘undue burden’ on the basic right to terminate a\npregnancy by abortion prior to the fetus’s viability.” Id., citing Planned Parenthood of S.E. Penn.\nv. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 877 (1992).\nAct 620 attempts to regulate this right by requiring a physician who performs abortions to\nobtain active admitting privileges within thirty miles of the facility where the abortions are\nperformed. The question before the Court is whether the Plaintiffs have shown a substantial\nlikelihood of proving that enforcement of the Act will violate the Constitution’s guarantee of due\nprocess or a woman’s right to choose an abortion. \nPlaintiffs’ first challenge the statute on the basis that the 81 days given the doctors to apply\nfor admitting privileges is simply not enough time to complete the application process before the\nSeptember 1, 2014 effective date. Despite the attempt by the doctors to comply with the Act by\napplying for privileges, they will be in violation of the Act after September 1 and subject to its\nsanctions while their applications are still pending. This, they contend, is a denial of their right to\ndue process.\nLouisiana has no time limit for hospitals to act upon an application for admitting privileges.\nLa. Rev. Stat. § 40:211(C) only requires that a doctor meet the “reasonable criteria for membership\n15 There are four Currier opinions. The District Court’s decision granting a TRO,  2012\nWL 2510953 (S.D. Miss. July 1, 2012) (“Currier I”); the District Court’s granting of the\npreliminary injunction, 878 F.Supp.2d 714 (S.D. Miss. July 12, 2012) (“Currier II”); the District\nCourt’s granting plaintiffs’ second Motion for Preliminary Injunction, 940 F. Supp. 2d 416 (S.D.\nMS April 15, 2013) (“Currier III”) and Currier IV, __ F. 3d __, 2014 WL 3730467 (5th Cir. July\n29, 2014) in which the Court of Appeal (Judge Garza, dissenting) affirmed but modified the\nDistrict Court’s preliminary injunction.\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 31    08/31/14   Page 11 of 19\nof a hospital,” and 40:2114(E) only requires that hospitals “establish rules, regulations and\nprocedures” for admitting privileges. The statute establishes no time limit for doing so. \nDefendants do not contest Plaintiffs allegations that the process for applying for and\nreceiving hospital admitting privileges varies from hospital to hospital and can last many months.16\nThis means that the physician who has applied for privileges in an effort to comply with the law but\nwhose application is still pending on September 1, 2014 will be subject to a fine of $4,000 per\nviolation and possible loss or suspension of license if he continues to perform abortions after this\ndate.  \nThe Declarations in this case show that Drs. Doe 1, 2 and 4 have applied for active admitting\nprivileges at hospitals within 30 miles of where they perform abortions. Dr. Doe 1 applied for\nadmitting privileges at three nearby hospitals on June 17, July 25 and August 15, 2014 (Dr. Doe 1\nDecl., Doc. 5-5,  ¶ 6) and, as of the time of the hearing, had not received a formal response from any\nof the hospitals. Dr. Doe 2 applied for privileges at one nearby hospital on May 12, 2014 (Dr. Doe\n2 Decl., Doc. 5-6,  ¶ 7,) and another on an undisclosed date prior to his Declaration of August 21,\n2014 (Dr. Doe Decl., Doc. 5-6, ¶ 8).  As of the time of hearing, he had received no formal action on\nhis applications. Dr. Doe 4 is not a plaintiff and has not provided a Declaration. However, according\nto the Declaration of Robert Gross, Dr. Doe 4 applied for active admitting privileges at Ocshner-\nKenner Medical Center on August 4, 2014 and has received no response. (Gross Decl., Doc. 5-4,\n¶ 5.) It is therefore impossible for these doctors, notwithstanding their best efforts, to comply with\nthe law before the effective date of the statute. \n16 Attached to Plaintiffs’ Application are the rules for granting admitting privileges at five\nseparate hospitals, (Declaration of Kathleen Pittman, Doc. 5-3, p.1-112) as well as a summary of\nsame (Doc. 5-9, p.1-8). These documents show that the process can last as long as 240 days or\nlonger.\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 31    08/31/14   Page 12 of 19\nThis issue was recently considered in Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas Surgical Health\nServices v. Abbott, 748 F.3d 583 (5th Cir. 2014), Petition for Rehearing en Banc pending, No. 13-\n51088 (5th Cir. April 10, 2014). There the Court considered the constitutionality of 2013 Texas\nHouse Bill No. 2 which, much like Act 620, required a physician performing or inducing an abortion\nto have admitting privileges at a hospital no more thirty miles from the location where the abortion\nwas to be provided. Texas House Bill No. 2 offered a 100 day grace period within which to comply\nwith the admitting privileges requirement. While the Court held that this grace period was sufficient\non its face, it stated that:\n...it would be absurd to enforce [Texas House Bill No. 2] against physicians who\ntimely  applied  for  admitting  privileges  but  have  not  heard  back  from  the\nhospital.***Obviously, it would be unreasonable to expect that all abortion providers\nwill be able to comply the admitting-privileges requirement within 100 days where\nreceiving  a  response  from  a  hospital  processing  an  application  for  admitting\nprivileges can take 170 days.17 Accordingly, we conclude that, pursuant to [Texas\nHouse Bill No. 2]’s severability provision, the admitting privileges provision may\nnot be enforced against abortion providers who applied for admitting privileges\nwithin the grace period allowed...but are awaiting a response from a hospital. Abbott,\n748 F.3d at 600 (emphasis the Court’s).\nThe Court in Abbott upheld the constitutionality of the Texas law but ordered that “it may\nnot be enforced against abortion providers who timely applied for admitting privileges under the\nstatute but are awaiting a response.” Abbott, 748 F.3d at 604.\nDefendant Kliebert concedes in her Declaration18 that Abbott set forth “instructions regarding\nthe proper enforcement of an admitting privileges law” and “instructed the government defendants\n17 TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE, Section 241.101 sets a 170 day deadline by which\nhospitals must act on admitting-privileges applications. Abbott, 748 F.3d at 600. As stated above,\nLouisiana sets no such limit and the Declarations submitted show that the process can take as\nlong as 240 days.\n18 Secretary Kiebert’s initial Declaration (Doc. 25), pledging not to attempt to enforce\nAct 620 was filed on August 28, 2014, the morning of the TRO hearing. A second and more\ndetailed Declaration (Doc 27) was filed after the hearing.\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 31    08/31/14   Page 13 of 19\nthat they could not enforce the admitting-privileges law against a physician who applied for\nadmitting privileges during the law’s grace period but who had not yet received a response on that\napplication before the effective date of the law.” (Doc. 27, p. 3-4.) Defendant Dawson makes\nessentially the same statement in his Declaration. (Doc. 26, p. 2.) \nThe question before the Court is whether, under these circumstances, the Plaintiffs have\ncarried their burden in establishing the four elements required in order for the Court to issue a TRO.\nThe first element (whether there a substantial likelihood that plaintiffs will prevail on the merits) is\neasily met by turning to Abbott, supra, and the concessions of the parties regarding same. This is a\ncase challenging the constitutionality of Act 620. In their Declarations, Defendants Kliebert and\nDawson concede that Act 620 as applied against Drs. Doe 1, 2 and 4 or any other physician who has\napplied for active admitting privileges not yet acted upon would constitute a violation of the doctors’\ndue process rights. \nThus, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have shown that irreparable injury would occur if the Act\nwere enforced against them. It is well settled that, in cases challenging laws based on a violation of\nconstitutional rights, once a constitutional violation is demonstrated, no further showing of\nirreparable injury need be shown. Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976); Deerfield Medical\nCenter v. City of Deerfield Beach, 661 F.2d 328, 338 (5th Cir. 1981); Springtree Apartments, APLC\nv. Livingston Parish Council, 207 F.Supp.2d 507, 515 (M.D. La. 2001).\nDefendants argue, however,  that there is no substantial threat of irreparable harm to the\ndoctors because they have pledged not to enforce Act 620 while the applications are pending.\n(Kliebert Decl., Doc. 27, p. 4; Dawson Decl., Doc. 26, p. 2.)\nPlaintiffs counter first, that Secretary Kliebert’s promise that DHH will not prosecute doctors\nfor violations of Act 620 is an empty one since the Act only gives the DHH the right to prosecute\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 31    08/31/14   Page 14 of 19\nthe clinics for hiring a doctor who is not admitted. The Act is silent as to who has the authority to\npursue the doctor for this violation.19 Furthermore, Secretary Kliebert’s Declaration that DHH has\nthe “primary” authority for enforcement of the Act does not preclude the possibility that some other\nState or local authority (who has made no pledge not to enforce) might attempt to enforce the Act\nagainst them.20\nDefendant Dawson’s assurances are more tentative than those of Kliebert. Dr. Dawson’s\nDeclaration does not pledge that the Board will not initiate proceedings to revoke or suspend the\nlicense of any doctor technically violating the statute while his or her application is pending. Rather,\nit states only that “[t]he Board does not have any current or planned administrative or enforcement\naction against any physician based on his compliance or non-compliance with Act 620.” (Doc. 26,\np. 2.)\nA similar situation faced the Court in Currier I and II. There, a Mississippi abortion clinic\nand others challenged a Mississippi law that required, among other things, all doctors associated\nwith an abortion clinic to have admitting and staff privileges at a local hospital. Currier II, 878\nF.Supp.2d at 715.  Unlike the Louisiana statute under consideration, the Mississippi law gave\nPlaintiffs a “reasonable time” to comply. Currier II at 717. However, like here, various state officials\n19 Section A(1) states, in pertinent part, “Any outpatient abortion facility that knowingly\nor negligently employs, contracts with, or provides any valuable consideration for the\nperformance of an abortion in an outpatient abortion facility by any person who does not meet\nthe requirements of this Section is subject to having its license denied, non-renewed, or revoked\nby the Department of Health and Hospitals in accord with R.S. 40:2175.6.” There is no\ncomparable provision specifying who has the enforcement responsibility as regards the doctor\nand the fine of $4,000 per violation. Section A(2)(c).\n20 During the TRO hearing, the Court suggested that Secretary Kliebert might clarify this\nissue and give greater reassurance to the Plaintiffs if she were to represent that DHH was the sole\nauthority to enforce Act 620. Secretary Kliebert’s second Declaration did not do that, only\nsaying  that DHH had the “primary” enforcement authority. \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 31    08/31/14   Page 15 of 19\ngave assurances that the Plaintiffs would not be prosecuted at the time of the proceedings. Currier\nII, at 716. \nUnder these circumstances, the Court found that there was an “imminent threat” of a\nConstitutional violation and granted a limited TRO: \nDefendants, while saying that they will not prosecute now, have never promised to\nabstain from future prosecution for the days of non-compliance that will begin when\nthe Act takes effect.***Given the highly charged political context of this case and\nthe ambiguity still present, the Court finds that there would be a chilling effect on the\nPlaintiffs’ willingness to continue to operate the Clinic until they obtained the\nnecessary privileges. Therefore, an irreparable injury currently exists. Currier II at\n719.\nThe Court finds that a very similar situation exists in this case. Secretary Kliebert’s\nDeclaration does not promise to abstain from future prosecution for days of non-compliance that\nwould begin on September 1, 2014. Rather, her Declaration states, “I have no intention of enforcing\nthe Act against the physicians in this matter until their admitting-privileges have been acted on\nfinally by the respective hospitals. Only at that time, and not before, will I instruct the Department\nto enforce the Act against physicians in this position.” (Doc. 27, p. 4, emphasis added.)\n Defendant Dawson’s affidavit does not promise to abstain from initiating proceedings to\nrevoke or suspend the doctors’ licenses; rather, he only says that there are no “current or planned”\nactions underway at this time. (Doc. 26, p. 2.) \nThe Plaintiffs have also clearly proved the remaining two elements. Exposing the Plaintiffs\nto potential fines of $4,000 per violation and possible loss of license outweighs any possible injury\nto Defendants from maintaining the status quo. This is especially true given the assurances made by\nthe Defendant Kliebert that she does not intend to enforce Act 620 while applications are pending\nand that of Dr. Dawson who states the Board has no present intention to pursue disciplinary action.\nCurrier II, at 720. Finally, the grant of this injunction will not disserve the public interest since this\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 31    08/31/14   Page 16 of 19\nelement  is  generally  considered  met  when  the  injunction  is  designed  to  protect  against  a\nconstitutional violation. Currier II, at 720.\nUnder the facts presented, the Court finds that a temporary restraining order is needed to\navoid placing Plaintiffs “between the Scylla of flouting state law and the Charybdis of foregoing\nwhat (they believe) to be constitutionally protected activity in order to avoid being enmeshed in...a\ncriminal proceeding.” Concerned Citizens v. Sills, 567 F. 2d 646, 651 (5th Cir. 1978) (citing Wooley\nv. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, 710 (1977), quoting Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U.S. 452, 462 (1974)). The\nApplication for TRO is therefore granted to the limited extent that Plaintiffs will not be subject to\nthe risk of the fines and sanctions called for or allowed under the Act now or in the future for\nperforming abortions without the relevant admitting privileges during the application process. This\nwill maintain the status quo since Defendants do not now contemplate or intend to enforce the Act\nwhile Plaintiffs pursue the application process. Plaintiff doctors will continue to pursue their\napplications and will be permitted to operate lawfully while doing so.\nBut Plaintiffs argue that the TRO should be granted for broader reasons as well. They argue\nthat if, as they fear, the doctors’ applications are denied, the effect will be to place an “undue\nburden” on the rights of their patients to get an abortion by creating “substantial obstacles” to the\nexercise of those rights thus rendering the statute unconstitutional as applied. Specifically, Plaintiffs\nargue that this would result in an unconstitutional denial of the right of women in this state to choose\nto have an abortion. In support of that position, Plaintiffs point to the recently decided Currier IV,\nsupra, finding Mississippi’s admitting-privileges requirement placed an undue burden on a woman’s\nright to an abortion and was therefore unconstitutional. \nIn support of this contention, Plaintiffs argue that the denial of the applications will “either\ndrastically reduce or completely eliminate the availability of legal abortion in the state...” (Rec. Doc\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 31    08/31/14   Page 17 of 19\n5-1, p. 22); that enforcement “will result in every doctor currently providing abortions at a clinic in\nLouisiana to stop providing those services...” (Rec. Doc. 5-1, p. 6) and that “no other doctor in\nLouisiana would be able to provide abortion services as of September 1...” (Rec. Doc 5-1, p. 18).\nPlaintiffs contend that enforcement would result in “the majority if not all” of the abortion clinics\nin Louisiana being unable to render services (Rec. Doc. 5-1, p. 25) and that this would “effectively\neliminate all access to legal abortions in Louisiana” (Rec. Doc. 5-1, p. 26). \nThe Court finds that the evidence currently before it cannot carry the weight of these\nallegations. It is possible that the applications of one or more of the doctors will be granted. The\nPlaintiffs could not point out to the Court any constitutional violation that would exist if the\napplications of Drs. 1, 2 and 4 were granted. Because the applications of the doctors have not been\nacted upon at this time, the Court believes any undue burden that might occur if they were denied\nis speculative. While the doctors point to some preliminary indications that their applications may\nnot be granted,21 the Court finds this evidence insufficient to carry their burden.\nIn Currier IV, unlike the present case, the preliminary injunction based on potential 14th\nAmendment violations was granted and affirmed at a time when the hospitals at which all seven\ndoctors had applied for privileges had denied their applications. Currier IV, 2014 WL 3730467 at\n*2. Here, none of the applications have been denied.\nFurthermore, even if the applications of all Plaintiffs doctors were to be denied in this case,\nthe overall impact on the right of women to have an abortion in Louisiana is unclear. According to\nPlaintiffs’ Application, the Plaintiffs’ facilities are only three of five which operate in Louisiana.\n(Decl. of Kathaleen Pittman, Doc. 5-3, p. 3,¶ 7.) How many patients do these other two facilities\ntreat? How many doctors practice there? How many of these doctors have applied for admitting\n21 See, e.g. Dr. Doe 1 Decl. ¶ 7, Doc. 5-5, *2-3\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 31    08/31/14   Page 18 of 19\nprivileges and what is the status of their applications? If these other two facilities remain open (or\ndon’t), what would be the overall effect in terms of the time and distance patients would need to\ntravel in order to receive their care? This, and other information not currently before the Court,\nwould be relevant in measuring the impact on the Constitutional right. See, e.g. Abbott, 748 F.3d 583\n(5th Cir. 2014). Based on the record before it at this time, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not\nshown a substantial likelihood of success on this ground. \nFor the reasons stated above, IT IS ORDERED that\n1. The Motion to Dismiss filed by Defendant Attorney General James David Caldwell is hereby\nGRANTED and  Louisiana State Health Officer and Medical Director, Dr. Jimmy Guidry,\nis hereby DISMISSED. \n2. The Plaintiffs’ Application for Temporary Restraining Order is GRANTED to the extent that\nany enforcement of § A(2)(a) of Act 620, amending La. R.S. 40:1299.35.2, is enjoined until\na hearing is held for the purpose of determining whether a preliminary injunction should\nissue.  Plaintiffs will continue to seek admitting privileges. The Act will be allowed to take\neffect but Plaintiffs will not be subject to the penalties and sanctions allowed in the statute\nat this time or in the future for practicing without the relevant admitting privileges during\nthe applications process.  Plaintiffs will be allowed to operate lawfully while continuing their\nefforts to obtain privileges. \n3. Plaintiffs’ Application for a Preliminary Injunction will remain pending. All parties indicated\nat the TRO Hearing that, if a TRO was granted, additional time was needed to conduct\ndiscovery and prepare for the hearing on the preliminary injunction. Thus, in accordance\nwith Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b)(2), a status conference will be set no later than 30 days hence for\nthe purpose of receiving a status report regarding the pending applications for admitting\n\nCase 3:14-cv-00525-JWD-RLB   Document 31    08/31/14   Page 19 of 19\nprivileges, determining the amount of time needed by the parties to prepare for the hearing\non  the  preliminary  injunction,  setting  a  date  for  the  preliminary  injunction  hearing,\ndiscussing the scope of the issues and nature of the proof which will be presented and\ndiscussing all additional issues which the parties and the Court deem relevant. The Court\nunderstands that the events in this case are fluid. Should circumstances change, the parties\nare free to seek any other relief as they may deem appropriate.\n4. Given the nature of the relief sought and because there is no risk of monetary loss to the\ndefendant by virtue of the granting of this injunction, it is unnecessary for Plaintiffs to post\na bond in this matter.\nBaton Rouge, La., this 31 day of August, 2014.\n______________________________________________\nJOHN W. deGRAVELLES, JUDGE\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nMIDDLE DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA",
