Plaintiffs agree (without waiving the arguments asserted in their response to the US Attorney's objection to the order of the Magistrate) that the FDA may assert the deliberative process privilege to the first batch of 1200 potentially-privileged documents. The MJ shall then consider whether the documents evidence bad faith such that they would be directly relevant to the plaintiffs' claims and assure that the privilege documents are not merely duplicative of previously-disclosed non-privileged documents. The same procedure should be followed with respect to subsequent batches unless the process becomes overly burdensome. In that event I will formally rule on the FDA's objections. Next status conference will be held in late September. (Court Reporter: ESR.) (Chee, Alvin) (Entered: 08/03/2006)"

    "summary": "<p>This is a case about the Food and Drug Administration’s rules surrounding access to Plan B emergency contraceptives (“ECs”). On January 21, 2005, the plaintiffs—including numerous individual members of the Morning-After-Pill (“MAP”) Conspiracy, a non-profit coalition of feminist organizations leading grassroots efforts to ensure that ECs are available over-the-counter (“OTC”)—sued the FDA in the Eastern District of New York. Represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, they requested declaratory relief and an injunction requiring the FDA to approve ECs for OTC use.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs claimed that requiring ECs be available by prescription only was arbitrary and capricious and exceeded statutory authority, and that such restrictions violated EC users’ constitutional right to privacy and constituted discrimination on the basis of sex. The case was assigned to Judge Charles P. Sifton due to its ostensible relation to another case on Judge Sifton’s docket, <em>Benten v. Kessler</em>. This relation was successfully challenged by the defendants, however, and the case was randomly reassigned to Judge Edward R. Korman.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in February 2005. The FDA initially moved to dismiss the case, but Judge Korman granted the FDA’s request to withdraw the motion to dismiss without prejudice on August 2, 2005. The FDA again moved to dismiss the following month. The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint in early December 2005, which added an additional cause of action under the APA. They argued that the FDA’s failure to approve the switch to OTC unlawfully withheld EC contrary to the underlying statute.</p>\r\n<p>The parties continued with discovery, and the plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint in January 2006. In March 2006, the state of Wisconsin filed a motion to intervene in the lawsuit, though this motion was eventually terminated the following month. A fourth amended complaint was filed on August 1, 2006, and a fifth in October. The fifth amended complaint claimed that the FDA’s more recent policy regarding EC—established in July 2006—wherein EC would be available behind the counter without the need for a prescription to certain persons over the age of 18, violated the APA and constitution in the same manner as the old policy.</p>\r\n<p>Discovery continued, and the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on March 31, 2007. In May 2007, the FDA filed a motion to dismiss the suit for lack of jurisdiction. On March 23, 2009, Judge Korman denied the FDA’s motion to dismiss and granted the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment, holding that the FDA’s treatment of EC was arbitrary and capricious, as they “repeatedly and unreasonably delayed issuing a decision on Plan B for suspect reasons.” 603 F.Supp.2d 519.</p>\r\n<p>On April 22, 2009, the FDA announced that it would allow Plan B’s manufacturers to make EC available without a prescription to 17-year-olds. In mid-2009, three organizations—Concerned Women for America (“CWA”), Christian Medical & Dental Associations (“CMDA”), and Christian Pharmacists Fellowship International (“CPFI”)—moved to intervene in the case and asked the court for leave to appeal the court’s judgment. On October 27, 2009, Judge Korman denied both motions and the parties agreed to the voluntary dismissal of the appeal with prejudice in February 2010.</p>\r\n<p>Due to a dispute regarding the FDA’s treatment of another form of EC, the plaintiffs moved to reopen the case in February 2012 and requested a preliminary injunction and summary judgment. In April 2013, Judge Korman again held the FDA’s actions to be arbitrary and capricious and granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs. 936 F.Supp.2d 162.</p>\r\n<p>The FDA eventually decided to make EC available OTC without any age or point of sale restrictions. As they were then in compliance with Judge Korman’s order, the FDA declined to pursue an appeal. The case is now closed.</p>",

This is a challenge under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) and the United \nStates Constitution to the denial by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of a Supplemental \nNew Drug Application (SNDA) and a citizen petition (“citizen petition”) seeking to switch the \nemergency contraception (“EC”) drug Plan B from prescription-only availability to unrestricted \nover-the-counter status1 (“OTC switch”) and to the establishment by the FDA of an age-\nrestricted, behind-the-pharmacy-counter, dual prescription/nonprescription regime for Plan B \n(“BTC regime”).  Plaintiffs claim that the BTC regime and the denial of the OTC switch violate \ntheir rights and the rights of women who need Plan B to privacy and equal protection under the \nFifth Amendment, and that the BTC regime and the denial of the OTC switch violate their rights \n                                                 \n1 Plaintiffs will use the term “unrestricted OTC status” to mean over-the-counter availability without a requirement \nthat the drug be kept behind the pharmacist’s counter, without a restriction on the types of venues where the product \nmay be distributed, and without an age restriction.  In other words, “unrestricted status” is used to mean the status of \nnumerous other drugs and devices, such as aspirin, condoms, dextromethorphan, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, etc. \n  2 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 3 of 44 PageID #: 4115\nand the rights of women who need Plan B because it exceeds the statutory authority of the FDA \nand is arbitrary and capricious.  Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief requiring the defendant to \napprove the OTC switch for women of all ages, or such other equitable relief as the Court may \ndeem appropriate, and a declaratory judgment that the FDA’s denial violates the APA and \nviolates the constitutional rights of women who need Plan B.   \n \nI.  Jurisdiction and Venue \n2.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because this case arises under the \nConstitution and laws of the United States. \n3.  Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(d) because one of the \nplaintiffs resides in this district and the defendant is an officer of the United States acting in his \nofficial capacity. \nII.  The Parties \nA.  Plaintiffs \n4.  Plaintiff Annie Tummino is a resident of Brooklyn, New York.  She sues on her own \nbehalf, in her individual capacity as Vice-Chair of the Women's Liberation Birth Control Project \nand as Coordinator of the Morning-After Pill Conspiracy (“MAP Conspiracy”), and on behalf of \nwomen who need Plan B. \n5.  Plaintiff Erin T. Mahoney is a resident of New York, New York.  She sues on her \nown behalf, in her individual capacity as Chair of the Women's Liberation Birth Control Project \nand as Coordinator of the MAP Conspiracy, and on behalf of women who need Plan B.   \n  3 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 4 of 44 PageID #: 4116\n6.  Plaintiff Carol Giardina is a resident of New York, New York.  She sues on her own \nbehalf, in her individual capacity as Coordinator of the MAP Conspiracy, and on behalf of \nwomen who need Plan B. \n7.  Plaintiff Kelly Mangan is a resident of Gainesville, Florida.  She sues on her own \nbehalf, in her individual capacity as President of the University of Florida Campus Chapter of the \nNational Organization for Women, as Coordinator of the MAP Conspiracy, and on behalf of \nwomen who need Plan B. \n8.  Plaintiff Stephanie Seguin is a resident of Gainesville, Florida.  She sues on her own \nbehalf, in her individual capacity as Chair of the Florida National Organization for Women \nYoung Feminist Task Force and as Coordinator of the MAP Conspiracy, and on behalf of \nwomen who need Plan B. \n9.  Plaintiff Lori Tinney is a resident of Gainesville, Florida.  She sues on her own \nbehalf, in her individual capacity as President of the Gainesville Chapter of the National \nOrganization for Women, Gainesville, FL and as Coordinator of the MAP Conspiracy, and on \nbehalf of women who need Plan B. \n10. Plaintiff Jennifer Brown is a resident of Gainesville, Florida.  She sues on her own \nbehalf, in her individual capacity as Coordinator of the MAP Conspiracy, and on behalf of \nwomen who need Plan B. \n11. Plaintiff Candace Churchill is a resident of Gainesville, Florida.  She sues on her own \nbehalf, in her individual capacity as Coordinator of the MAP Conspiracy, and on behalf of \nwomen who need Plan B. \n  4 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 5 of 44 PageID #: 4117\n12. Plaintiff Francie Hunt is a resident of Nashville, Tennessee.  She sues on her own \nbehalf, in her individual capacity as Coordinator of the MAP Conspiracy, and on behalf of \nwomen who need Plan B. \n13. The MAP Conspiracy is a coalition of feminist organizations leading the grassroots \nmovement to make the Morning-After Pill an over-the-counter drug by raising public \nconsciousness about the ways that women have to conspire to obtain it.  Since February 2004, \nthe MAP Conspiracy has organized speak-outs where women publicly testify from their own \nexperience about their need for the Morning-After Pill and the obstacles they face obtaining it.  \nMembers of the MAP Conspiracy also testified at the December 2003 FDA public hearings on \nthe Barr application for approval of over-the-counter status for Plan B. \n14. Each of the individual plaintiffs listed in paragraphs 4-13 above has access to one or \nmore doses of Plan B, and each of them intends, plans, and has pledged to provide Plan B to \nfriends or other women of any age -- including women under the age of 18 and women over 18 \nwho lack government issued identification or who lack timely access to a pharmacy or health \nclinic -- whom they learn need Plan B to prevent pregnancy.  None of the individual plaintiffs \nlisted in paragraphs 4-13 above is licensed or authorized by law in any state to prescribe or \ndispense drugs.  Consequently, unless unrestricted OTC status for Plan B is implemented, each \nof the individual plaintiffs listed in paragraphs 4-13 above risks violating federal and state \ncriminal statutes if she carries through on her plan to provide Plan B to women of all ages who \nneed it to prevent pregnancy.   See, e.g., 21 U.S.C. §§ 353(b)(1), 333(a), 333(b) (2005);  § \n465.015, Fla. Stat. (2004). \n15. Each of the individual plaintiffs listed in paragraphs 4-13 above objects to the \nrequirement contained in the BTC regime that she must disclose her name, address and age to a \n  5 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 6 of 44 PageID #: 4118\npharmacist and/or pharmacy employee in order to obtain Plan B.  In addition, each individual \nplaintiff listed in paragraphs 4-13 above objects to the disclosure of information to third parties \nabout her personal sexual activity that will occur because, in order to obtain Plan B without a \nprescription, she is required to present identification to a pharmacist or pharmacy employee. \n16. Plaintiff Association of Reproductive Health Professionals (ARHP) is a non-profit \nmembership association composed of experts in reproductive health. These professionals include \nphysicians, advanced practice clinicians (nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, physician \nassistants), researchers, educators, pharmacists, and other professionals in reproductive health, \nsome of whom have authority to prescribe drugs and some of whom do not.  ARHP and its \nmembers provide reproductive health services and education, conduct reproductive health \nresearch, and influence reproductive health policy.  Specifically, ARHP works to improve the \nreproductive health of women by reducing the number of unintended pregnancies among \nwomen.   ARHP, along with Princeton University’s Office of Population Research (OPR), \nmanages the Emergency Contraception Hotline (1-888-Not-2-Late) and Website (www.not-2-\nlate.com), which aim to prevent unintended pregnancy by providing women of all ages and their \npartners information about, and rapid access to, emergency contraception.  Both the Hotline and \nWebsite are highly utilized tools, currently receiving an average of 60,000 calls and 650,000 \nunique website visits per year.  These calls and visits include calls and visits by women under the \nage of 18, women over 18 who lack government issued identification, and women who lack \ntimely access to a pharmacy or health clinic.  The Hotline is an automated, toll-free, 24-hour, \nconfidential service available in both English and Spanish that gives callers general emergency \ncontraception information and a list of the five emergency contraception providers nearest to \nthem (including a list of pharmacists in states where pharmacists are permitted by state law to \n  6 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 7 of 44 PageID #: 4119\ndispense Plan B to those who require a prescription).  It is available from any phone in the \nUnited States, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, British Columbia, and the Yukon Territory.  The \nWebsite, available in English, French, Spanish, and Arabic, is the most comprehensive \nemergency contraception clearinghouse in the world available to anyone via the World Wide \nWeb.  It features frequently asked questions about emergency contraception, a publications \nbibliography, a Plan B materials database, and a searchable database of Plan B providers across \nthe country, Puerto Rico, Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands, and British Columbia.  The full directory of \nproviders can be searched by city, state, area code, and zip code.  The NOT-2-LATE database \nalso lists pharmacists in Alaska, California, Washington State, New Mexico, and British \nColumbia.  ARHP and OPR work closely with local pharmaceutical associations to sign up \npharmacists who dispense Plan B behind the counter.  Vermont has recently become the ninth \nstate—joining Alaska, California, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Mexico, \nand Washington—to allow direct dispensation of Plan B by pharmacists.  FDA admitted on June \n9, 2006 that it had denied ARHP’s petition to the FDA to switch Plan B to OTC status for \nwomen of all ages.  The BTC regime and the denial of unrestricted OTC status interfere with \nARHP’s ability to educate health care providers and the public about emergency contraception, \ninterfere with ARHP’s efforts to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and its efforts to \nuse the Emergency Contraception Hotline and Website to achieve that goal, and interfere with its \nmembers’ ability to accomplish the goal of improving the reproductive health of women.  ARHP \nsues on its own behalf, on behalf of its members who lack prescribing authority and their patients \nand clients who seek Plan B who are under 18, are over 18 and lack government issued \nidentification, lack timely access to a pharmacy or health clinic, or are over 18 and object to \n  7 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 8 of 44 PageID #: 4120\nshowing identification in order to obtain Plan B, and on behalf of the women who utilize the \nHotline and Website to obtain access to Plan B. \n17. Plaintiff National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health (NLIRH) is a non-profit \norganization formed under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.  NLIRH conducts a \nPlan B education and outreach project which seeks to educate providers of Plan B and potential \nusers of Plan B about what Plan B is, how to use it, and how to obtain it and, for providers, how \nto incorporate it into their practice.  NLIRH has conducted such an education and outreach \nproject in the Bronx, and plans additional such projects at several locations in Brooklyn and the \nBronx through June of 2005.  NLIRH’s Plan B education outreach projects are impeded by the \nage-restricted behind-the-counter dual prescription/nonprescription status for Plan B.  If Plan B \nis switched to OTC for women of all ages, NLIRH will be able to improve access to Plan B by \nenhancing its Plan B educational programs for both the health care providers and the public \nparticipants involved in those projects.  NLIRH sues on its own behalf and on behalf of the \nwomen participants in its Plan B projects who are of childbearing age, including women who are \nunder 18, are over 18 and lack government issued identification, lack timely access to a \npharmacy or health clinic, or are over 18 and object to showing identification in order to obtain \nPlan B. \n18. Plaintiff Robert Jaffe is a resident of Brooklyn, New York and is the father of a 13-\nyear-old daughter, Angelica Jaffe.  He sues on behalf of himself and his daughter because he \nwants his daughter to be able to obtain Plan B without a prescription and without any restriction \non its point of sale so as to maximize the likelihood that she will avoid unwanted pregnancy.   \n19. Plaintiff Aurora DeMarco is a resident of Brooklyn, New York and is the mother of a \n13-year-old daughter, Angelica Jaffe.  She sues on behalf of herself and her daughter because she \n  8 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 9 of 44 PageID #: 4121\nwants her daughter to be able to obtain Plan B without a prescription and without any restriction \non its point of sale so as to maximize the likelihood that she will avoid unwanted pregnancy.   \n20. Plaintiff Angelica Jaffe is a resident of Brooklyn, New York and is a 13-year-old \nyoung woman.  She sues on her own behalf because she wants to be able to obtain Plan B \nwithout a prescription and without any restriction on its point of sale so as to maximize the \nlikelihood that she will avoid unwanted pregnancy.   \n21. Plaintiff Catherine Lederer-Plaskett is a resident of Hartsdale, New York and is the \nmother of a 16-year-old daughter, Aliza Lederer-Plaskett.  She sues on behalf of herself and her \ndaughter because she wants her daughter to be able to obtain Plan B without a prescription and \nwithout any restriction on its point of sale so as to maximize the likelihood that she will avoid \nunwanted pregnancy. \n22. Plaintiff Aliza Lederer-Plaskett is a resident of Hartsdale, New York and is a 16-year-\nold young woman.  She sues on her own behalf because she wants to be able to obtain Plan B \nwithout a prescription and without any restriction on its point of sale so as to maximize the \nlikelihood that she will avoid unwanted pregnancy.   \n23. Plaintiff Jonathan Marks is a resident of Brooklyn, New York and is the father of a \n13-year-old daughter, Gabrielle Marks.  He sues on behalf of himself and his daughter because \nhe wants his daughter to be able to obtain Plan B without a prescription and without any \nrestriction on its point of sale so as to maximize the likelihood that she will avoid unwanted \npregnancy.   \n24. Plaintiff Gabrielle Marks is a resident of Brooklyn, New York and is a 13-year-old \nyoung woman.  She sues on her own behalf because she wants to be able to obtain Plan B \n  9 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 10 of 44 PageID #: 4122\nwithout a prescription and without any restriction on its point of sale so as to maximize the \nlikelihood that she will avoid unwanted pregnancy. \n25. Each woman who is (1) under 18 years of age and needs Plan B; (2) over 18 but lacks \nadequate proof of age to obtain Plan B without a prescription; (3) over 18 but lacks timely access \nto a pharmacy or health clinic so as to maximize the effectiveness of Plan B; or (4) must present \nidentification including proof of age to a pharmacist or health clinic and thereby disclose at least \nher name and possibly her address to third-parties to obtain Plan B, is irreparably injured as a \ndirect result of the FDA’s age-restricted behind-the-counter dual prescription/nonprescription \nregime for Plan B.  Each of the Plaintiffs listed in paragraphs 4-13, 16, and 17 above wants to \nand intends to try to make Plan B available to women in each of these categories, and asserts \nthird-party standing to assert their interests. \n26. Each of the plaintiffs is aggrieved on a continuing and ongoing basis by the FDA’s \nrejection of the OTC switch of Plan B for women of all ages. \n27. Each of the plaintiffs is injured on a continuing and ongoing basis by the FDA’s \nrejection of the OTC switch for women of all ages, and the FDA’s rejection is the cause of that \ninjury. \n28. The relief sought in this complaint will redress the injury suffered by each of the \nplaintiffs that is caused by the FDA’s rejection of unrestricted OTC status for Plan B. \nB.  Defendant \n29. Andrew C. von Eschenbach is the acting commissioner of the FDA.  Von Eschenbach \nis responsible for protecting the public health by assuring the safety, efficacy, and security of \nhuman and veterinary drugs, biological products, medical devices, our nation’s food supply, \ncosmetics, and products that emit radiation.  He is also responsible for advancing the public \n  10 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 11 of 44 PageID #: 4123\nhealth by helping to speed innovations that make medicines and foods more effective, safer, and \nmore affordable; and helping the public get the accurate, science-based information they need to \nuse medicines and foods to improve their health.  He is sued in his official capacity. \nIII.  Statutory and Regulatory Background \n30. Under FDA regulations, “[a]ny drug limited to prescription use . . . shall be exempted \nfrom prescription-dispensing requirements when the Commissioner finds such requirements are \nnot necessary for the protection of the public health by reason of the drug’s toxicity or other \npotentiality for harmful effect, or the method of its use, or the collateral measures necessary to its \nuse, and he finds that the drug is safe and effective for use in self-medication as directed in \nproposed labeling.”  21 C.F.R. § 310.200(b) (2005); see also 21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(3) (2005) (“The \nSecretary may by regulation remove drugs subject to sections 352(d) and 355 of this title from \nthe requirements of paragraph (1) of this subsection when such requirements are not necessary \nfor the protection of the public health.”).   \n31. The FDA views OTC status as the “default” status for drugs.  See http://www.fda. \ngov/cder/Offices/OTC/FDA-CHPA%20seminar%20Oct%202/tsld013.htm (attached as Exhibit \nU). \n32. An approved drug is suitable for OTC use when: (1) the drug is safe for self-\nmedication, 21 C.F.R. § 310.200(b); 21 C.F.R. § 330.10(a)(4)(i); (2) the drug is effective when \nself-administered, 21 C.F.R. § 310.200(b); 21 C.F.R. § 330.10(a)(4)(ii); (3) the condition to be \ntreated is self-diagnosable; and (4) the drug’s labeling is tailored to self-administration, 21 \nC.F.R. § 310.200(b); 21 C.F.R. § 330.10(a)(4)(v).   \n33. The FDA has developed its own internal criteria for assessing OTC switch \napplications, known as the “Peck criteria” after former CDER Director Carl Peck.  These criteria \n  11 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 12 of 44 PageID #: 4124\nare: 1.) Does the product have an acceptable margin of safety based on prior prescription \nmarketing experience; 2.) Does the product have low misuse and abuse potential; 3.) Can the \ncondition be adequately self-recognized and successfully self-treated with minimal health care \nprovider intervention; 4.) Do the benefits from the switch to non-prescription status clearly \noutweigh the risks; and 5.) Is the self-treatment product safe and effective during consumer use.  \nPlan B meets each of these criteria. \n34. By statute, the manufacturer of a prescription drug may file a supplemental new drug \napplication with the FDA seeking to switch the drug to OTC status.  21 U.S.C. § 355(b).  Such \nan application must be acted upon by the FDA within 180 days of its filing.  21 U.S.C. § 355(c).   \n35. In addition, FDA regulations explicitly authorize the use of a citizen’s petition to seek \na switch from prescription to OTC status:  “A proposal to exempt a drug from the prescription-\ndispensing requirements of section 503(b)(1)(C) of the act may be initiated by . . . any interested \nperson . . . fil[ing] a petition . . . pursuant to Part 10 of this chapter . . . .” 21 C.F.R. § 310.200(b). \nOnce a citizen’s petition has been filed, the FDA is required by its regulations to either approve \nthe petition, deny the petition, or “[p]rovide a tentative response, indicating why the agency has \nbeen unable to reach a decision on the petition, e.g., because of the existence of other agency \npriorities, or a need for additional information.”   21 C.F.R. § 10.30(e)(2). \n36. During the process of considering an application for an OTC switch, the FDA \ntypically receives the advice of the FDA’s OTC advisory committee meeting together with the \nFDA’s advisory committee that has specific expertise in the product under consideration.  In the \ncase of Plan B, the latter committee is the Advisory Committee for Reproductive Health Drugs.  \nThese advisory committees are authorized by, inter alia, 21 U.S.C. § 355(n) (2005).   \n  12 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 13 of 44 PageID #: 4125\n37. The FDA lacks the statutory authority to restrict the types of businesses that can sell \nOTC drugs. \n38. Dispensing a prescription drug other than by prescription is an act of “misbranding” \nunder federal law.  21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1).  Introducing a misbranded drug into interstate \ncommerce is a “prohibited act,” 21 U.S.C. § 331(a), punishable by not more than one year \nimprisonment or a fine of up to $1000 or both.  21 U.S.C. § 333(a)(1).  \nIV.  Factual Allegations \nA.  Making Plan B Available OTC to Women of All Ages Would Improve the Public \nHealth and Enable Women to Reduce their Risk of Unplanned Pregnancies. \n39. Unintended pregnancy is a significant public health problem in the United States.  \nThe United States has one of the highest rates of unintended pregnancy compared to other \ndeveloped countries.  The rate of teen pregnancy in the United States is also one of the highest \namong developed countries.  Wider access to Plan B will reduce unintended pregnancies, \nincluding among teenagers.  \n40. The risks of pregnancy and childbirth, including maternal death, can be serious and \nfar exceed the risks associated with Plan B.   \n41. Plan B is a drug used only by women, and every woman of childbearing age is a \npotential user of Plan B. \n42. Plan B (Levonorgestrel) is an emergency contraceptive drug in tablet form that can be \nused to prevent pregnancy following an act of intercourse in which no contraceptive was used or \nthe contraceptive method used failed.  \n43. When taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse, Plan B reduces the risk of \npregnancy by approximately 89 percent after a single act of unprotected sex.  As the interval \n  13 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 14 of 44 PageID #: 4126\nbetween intercourse and the start of treatment increases, Plan B’s effectiveness declines, and the \nrisk of pregnancy increases.  Plan B does not interfere with an established pregnancy. \n44. Switching Plan B to OTC status for women of all ages will promote public health \nbecause Plan B is only effective for a short time after unprotected sex, and it works most \neffectively if used within twenty-four hours of unprotected sex.  Because contacting a physician \nand obtaining and filling a prescription hinder women from obtaining Plan B in a timely fashion, \nmaking Plan B available OTC will allow more women to use the treatment, and enable more \nwomen to prevent unwanted pregnancies, to the benefit of public health.   \n45. Limiting Plan B to prescription use is not necessary for the protection of public \nhealth.   \n46. Plan B is safe for self-medication because it is not toxic to the woman (or to the \nembryo or fetus if a pregnancy had been previously established in the woman). \n47. Plan B has a low risk of abuse or overdose, and if overdose occurs is unlikely to lead \nto serious consequences. \n48. Plan B’s side effects are well-known and minor.   \n49. Plan B is effective when self-administered.  Its administration is simple and relies \nonly on assessments as to time elapsed since sexual intercourse that can be independently made \nby the woman, and any interaction between Plan B and other drugs would be nonfatal and \nunlikely to seriously affect Plan B’s efficacy.   \n50. The condition Plan B treats — contraceptive failure or failure to use contraception \nduring intercourse — is one that is readily diagnosable by a woman. \n51. Plan B has no contraindications that would pose a danger to the patient.   \n  14 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 15 of 44 PageID #: 4127\n52. The existing patient labeling for Plan B is tailored to self-administration in that it is \nsimple, clear, comprehensive and easy to follow.   \n53. The American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists both support switching Plan B to OTC status for women of all ages.  See Dec. 5, \n2000 Statement of American Medical Association; February 14, 2001 Statement of the American \nCollege of Obstetricians & Gynecologists.  In addition, the American Academy of Pediatrics \nsupports switching Plan B to OTC status for women of all ages.  (Attached hereto as Exhibit T). \nB.  Public Health Organizations Filed Two Citizen Petitions with the FDA Seeking to \nIncrease Access to Emergency Contraception. \n54. On November 23, 1994, the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy (now the Center \nfor Reproductive Rights) submitted a Citizen Petition (Docket No. 94P-0427) on behalf of the \nAmerican Women’s Health Association, the American Public Health Association, and Planned \nParenthood of New York City, asking the FDA to require two drug manufacturers to amend the \nlabeling and package inserts of certain of their oral contraceptive products to include information \nregarding the use of these products as emergency contraception.  On May 22, 1995, the FDA \nissued an “interim response” indicating that the request was “still under consideration” and that \nthe agency required more time to “thoroughly evaluate[] the issues raised” in the petition and to \nfinalize its decision.  (Letter of Janet Woodcock, M.D., Director, CDER, dated May 22, 1995 \n(attached hereto as Exhibit A).) \n55. On May 9, 1996, the FDA issued a letter denying the 1994 Citizen Petition because \n“[a]lthough FDA agrees in principle that it has discretion to require that certain conditions of use \nbe included in a product’s labeling . . . we decline to exercise our discretion to require the \nrelabeling of these products in the manner you suggest.”  (Letter of Janet Woodcock, M.D., \nDirector, CDER, dated May 9, 1996 (attached hereto as Exhibit B).)  However, the agency \n  15 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 16 of 44 PageID #: 4128\ndetermined “that it would be appropriate to discuss the issue of the safety and effectiveness of \noral contraceptives for postcoital emergency use with the Reproductive Health Drugs Advisory \nCommittee at its June 28, 1996 meeting.  [The Center for Reproductive Law and Policy] will be \ninvited to present [its] views at that meeting.”  See id.  \n56. On February 24, 1997, the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy received notice \nfrom FDA Deputy Commissioner Mary K. Pendergast that “today the Food and Drug \nAdministration placed on public display a Federal Register notice concluding that certain \ncombined oral contraceptives . . . are safe and effective for use as postcoital emergency \ncontraception.  The notice requests submission of new drug applications for this use . . . .”   \n(Letter of Mary K. Pendergast, Deputy Commissioner, Senior Advisor to the Commissioner, \nFDA, dated February 24, 1997 (attached hereto as Exhibit C); see also Prescription Drug \nProducts; Certain Combined Oral Contraceptives for Use as Postcoital Emergency Contraception \n(Docket No. 96N-0492) (attached hereto as Exhibit D).) \n57. FDA Federal Register Notice stated that “[t]his notice is intended to encourage \nmanufacturers to make this additional contraceptive option available.”  Ex. D at 1.  The agency \nagreed with the unanimous conclusion of the Advisory Committee, which met on June 28, 1996 \nto consider this issue, that several regimens of oral contraception were safe and effective for \npostcoital emergency contraception.  Id. at 3.  The agency concluded that “[b]ecause of the \npublicly available safety and effectiveness data documenting the drugs’ use, the safety and \neffectiveness requirements of § 314.50 may be met by citing the published literature listed in the \nreferences in section III. of this document.”  Id. at 8.   \n58. In 1999, the FDA approved Plan B as a prescription drug.  Since that date, Plan B has \nbeen prescribed many thousands of times.   \n  16 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 17 of 44 PageID #: 4129\n59. On February 14, 2001, a group of citizen organizations, including Plaintiff ARHP, \nfiled a petition (“the Citizen Petition”) with FDA asking the agency to switch Plan B (and \nanother drug, Preven, that has since been removed from the market for reasons unrelated to \nsafety and effectiveness) to OTC status for women of all ages.   \n60. The FDA’s consideration of the Citizen Petition was inextricably intertwined with its \nconsideration of the application by the manufacturer of Plan B to switch Plan B to OTC status, \ndescribed below. \n61. On June 9, 2006, the FDA issued a letter directly prompted by this lawsuit in which it \nacknowledges that it has denied the Citizen Petition.  (See Exhibit V.) \n62. In that letter, the FDA alleges: “Soon after [the] petition was filed, [FDA] made a \npreliminary determination that your petition and its supporting information did not provide \nsufficient data to satisfy the statutory requirements to approve an OTC switch for emergency \ncontraceptives, as documented in memoranda dated February 28, 2001 and April 12, 2001.”  (See \nExhibit V at 1.)  However, this determination was not communicated to the petitioners until June \n9, 2006.  Rather, the FDA gave a tentative response to the Citizen Petition on September 6, 2001, \nstating the FDA “has not yet resolved the issues raised in your Citizen Petition because it raises \nsignificant issues requiring extensive review and analysis by Agency officials.”   \nC.  Barr Laboratories Filed a Supplemental New Drug Application Seeking OTC Status \nfor Plan B, Which Was Not Approved by the FDA Contrary to the Overwhelming \nConsensus of the Review Staff and Advisory Committee in Support of Approving \nthe Application. \n63. On April 16, 2003, Women’s Capital Corporation, the former owner of Plan B, filed a \nsupplemental new drug application (SNDA) asking the agency to approve Plan B for OTC sale.  \nPlan B was subsequently sold to Barr Laboratories, which maintained the SNDA.  The SNDA \n  17 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 18 of 44 PageID #: 4130\ncontains no scientific data whatsoever on the safety or effectiveness of Plan B for any medically \napproved use for men. \n64. On April 21, 2003, FDA Commissioner McClellan held a teleconference with Jay \nLefkowitz, Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy at the White House, regarding \nWCC’s submissions to the FDA on Plan B.  Commissioner McClellan continued to have \nperiodic discussions with White House staff regarding the Plan B SNDA. \n65. Prior to the submission of the manufacturer’s OTC switch application, but after the \nFDA became aware of the manufacturer’s intent to file such an application, three new members \nwere appointed to the Advisory Committee for Reproductive Health Drugs at the insistence of \nthe FDA Commissioner’s Office and despite strongly voiced concerns from FDA’s career \nscientists about their qualifications.  In addition, despite the usual practice by which members of \nthe advisory committees are proposed by career scientists with relevant expertise, these three \nmembers were proposed by political appointees.  Each of the three voted contrary to the majority \nvote of the Committee on one or more votes taken regarding Plan B. \n66. On December 16, 2003, FDA’s Non-prescription Drugs Advisory Committee and \nAdvisory Committee for Reproductive Health Drugs held a joint session to discuss possible OTC \nstatus for Plan B. \n67. The advisory committees, comprised of 28 members, voted as follows: \n(1) Does the Actual Use Study (AUS) demonstrate that consumers used [Plan B] \nas recommended in the proposed labeling? \n            Yes – 27  No – 1 \n(2) Are the AUS data generalizable to the overall population of potential non-Rx \nusers of Plan B? \n            Yes – 27  No – 1 \n  18 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 19 of 44 PageID #: 4131\n(3) Based on the AUS and literature review, is there evidence that non-Rx \navailability of Plan B leads to substitution of emergency contraception for the \nregular use of other methods of contraception?   \n            Yes – 0  No – 28 \n(4) Do the data demonstrate that Plan B is safe for use in the non-prescription \nsetting? \n            Yes – 28  No – 0 \n \n68. According to the Manual of Policies and Procedures (MAPP) of the FDA’s Center for \nDrug Evaluation and Research (CDER), the authority to approve a product for initial OTC \nmarketing and for initial Rx-to-OTC switch for the first in a class of products is delegated to the \noffice director level.  MaPP 6020.5 at 13 (MaPP 6020.5 is attached hereto as Exhibit S).  The \nauthority to not approve an OTC switch for a drug is the responsibility of the “Specific Subject \nMatter Review Division” that approved it as a prescription drug.  MaPP 6020.5 at 15.  The FDA \nviolated these policies in its actions regarding the Plan B SNDA and the Citizen Petition. \n69. The composition of the Joint Advisory Committee was likewise determined in a \nmanner that departed from the normal process because nominations to the Committee were made \nby FDA political appointees rather than FDA career scientists.  \n70. During late December of 2003 or early January of 2004, Drs. Janet Woodcock \n(Director of CDER and acting Deputy Commissioner of the FDA) and Steven Galson (acting \nDirector of CDER) informed Drs. John Jenkins and Sandra Kweder (Director and Deputy \nDirector of CDER’s Office of New Drugs) that Commissioner McClellan had made a \ndetermination that the Plan B SNDA would not be approved.  This decision also constructively \ndenied the Citizen Petition. \n71. The FDA decided by January 2004 at the latest to require an age restriction in any \npossible nonprescription approval for Plan B. \n  19 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 20 of 44 PageID #: 4132\n72. The determination by the Commissioner described in ¶ 70 that the Plan B SNDA \nwould not be approved was made by the Commissioner (1) without attending the Joint Advisory \nCommittee meeting; (2) before scientific reviews of the Plan B SNDA were completed by the \nFDA’s scientific review staff; and (3) without any direct discussions with the FDA’s scientific \nreview staff conducting the review of the Plan B SNDA. \n73. On January 15, 2004, Dr. Galson informed FDA scientists conducting the agency’s \nreview of the Plan B SNDA that the Commissioner’s position was that the application could not \nbe approved.  At this same meeting Dr. Galson conveyed that one option that might lead to \napproval was an age restriction on Plan B that would keep it as a prescription drug for women \nunder 18, even though he only invoked alleged deficiencies in data for women under 16.  This \noption was proposed before scientific reviews of data submitted with the Plan B SNDA were \ncomplete.   \n74. On or about January 16, 2004, Dr. Woodcock informed the Director of the Office of \nDrug Evaluation III that the non-approval action directed by Commissioner McClellan was the \nonly course of action that would appease the Presidential administration’s constituents and that \nmight lead eventually to approval. \n75. On February 19, 2004 Dr. Janet Woodcock stated at a meeting that both she and the \nCommissioner were concerned about the possibility of OTC Plan B acquiring ‘urban legend’ \nstatus and leading to extreme promiscuous behaviors, such as the development of sex based cults \ncentered around the use of Plan B.  At that meeting, Dr. Galson indicated that he shared Dr. \nWoodcock’s concerns. \n76. All but one scientific staff member below the Center Director level within CDER \nwho reviewed the OTC switch application expressed the view based on scientific and medical \n  20 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 21 of 44 PageID #: 4133\ndata that the OTC switch should be approved for women of all ages.  The one staff member who \ndisagreed believed the application was “approvable.” \n77. By memorandum dated April 22, 2004 and signed electronically on April 28, 2004, \nDr. John Jenkins wrote a memorandum summarizing his “review, conclusions, and \nrecommendations regarding” the OTC switch for Plan B (attached hereto as Ex. E) (“the Jenkins \nmemorandum”).  This memorandum states: “[The FDA] has not heretofore distinguished the \nsafety and efficacy of Plan B and other forms of hormonal contraception among different ages of \nwomen of childbearing potential and I am not aware of any compelling scientific reason for such \na distinction in this case.”  (Ex. E at 30898.)  After a review of the record evidence supporting \nOTC use by women of all ages, the Jenkins memorandum accordingly concludes “that the \navailable data clearly support a conclusion that Plan B meets the statutory and regulatory \nrequirements for availability without a prescription for all age groups.  Such a conclusion is \nconsistent with how the Agency has made determinations for other OTC products, including \nother forms of contraception available without a prescription.”  (Id. at 30899.) \n78. The Jenkins memorandum further states that “[o]ther senior officials within the \nAgency, including the former Commissioner (Dr. McClellan) and the Acting Center Director \n(Dr. Galson), have expressed concerns about the potential for unsafe, ineffective, or \ninappropriate use of Plan B by adolescents if it were to be made available without a prescription.  \nThese concerns appear to have been based primarily on the limited number of adolescent women \nincluded in the sponsor’s label comprehension and actual use studies.”  (Id. at 30897.) \n79. Though Jenkins said that he “[is] sensitive to and respect[s] the concerns that some \nmay have regarding non-prescription access to Plan B by adolescents,” (Id. at 30898), he stated \nthat “[p]roducts that are indicated for uses related to sexual activity in adolescents raise concerns \n  21 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 22 of 44 PageID #: 4134\nfor some people that go beyond a finding based on clinical trial data that the product is safe and \neffective for its intended use in adolescents.  These concerns derive from individual views and \nattitudes about the morality of adolescent sexual behavior and also overlap with concerns about \nthe role for parents and health care professionals in decisions about contraceptive use in \nadolescents.”  (Id. at 30898-99.)  He concluded: “While OTC access to Plan B for adolescents \nmay be controversial from a societal perspective, I cannot think of any age group where the \nbenefit of preventing unplanned pregnancies and abortion is more important and more \ncompelling.”  (Id. at 30899.) \n80. On May 6, 2004, CDER Acting Director Steven Galson issued a “non-approvable” \nletter (attached hereto as Ex. F) (“the Galson letter”) to Barr rejecting the OTC switch for Plan B.  \nThat action also constructively denied the Citizen Petition. \n81. The Galson letter asserts that Barr’s SNDA could not be approved because Barr had \n“not provided adequate data to support a conclusion that Plan B can be used safely by young \nadolescent women for emergency contraception without the professional supervision of a \npractitioner licensed by law to administer the drug.”  (Ex. F at 10796.)  This assertion is not \nsupported by the agency record. \n82. In November of 2004, FDA’s Office of Counter-Terrorism and Pediatric Drug \nDevelopment concluded that the data submitted by the manufacturer reflected the age \ndistribution, including among younger adolescents, of actual prescription users of the product. \n83. In about January 2005, Steven Galson was prepared to approve Plan B for OTC status \nfor women ages 17 and over, but his authority to do so was removed by the Commissioner of the \nFDA.   Indeed, Dr. Galson had asked the Director of the Office of New Drugs to draft approval \nletters for him. \n  22 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 23 of 44 PageID #: 4135\n84. At least one of the FDA scientists who supported OTC status for Plan B fears \nretaliation from the Agency for her truthful testimony in this lawsuit.  \n85. Dr. Galson was concerned that if he did not implement or disagreed with the decision \nof the Office of the Commissioner to reject unrestricted OTC status for Plan B, his career at the \nFDA would be jeopardized. \n \nD.  Barr Laboratories Filed an Amended Supplemental New Drug Application Seeking \nAge-Restricted OTC Status for Plan B, Which Also Was Not Approved, Contrary to \nthe Overwhelming Consensus among Agency Reviewers in Favor of Approving the \nApplication. \n86. On July 22, 2004, Barr filed an amended SNDA seeking the OTC switch only for \nwomen aged 16 and higher.  By statute, the defendant was required to act on Barr’s amended \nSNDA within 180 days after it was filed.  See 21 U.S.C. § 355(c)(1).  On January 21, 2005, the \nFDA announced a delay of its decision on Barr’s application beyond this statutory time limit. \n87. The reviewing divisions and offices of FDA reviewed Barr’s amended application \nand examined the concerns raised by senior officials to support their decision to issue a non-\napprovable letter for OTC use of Plan B, but found that scientific evidence did not support these \nconcerns.  (Excerpts from Mem. of Donna J. Griebel, M.D., dated January 12, 2005 (attached \nhereto as Exhibit G) at 31033.)   \n88. In its review of Barr’s amended SNDA, the FDA review staff unanimously agreed \nthat despite Barr’s application for limited OTC status for Plan B for women 16 and older, that the \ndrug was suitable for -- and thus should be approved for -- full OTC access for women of all \nages.  (Review of Complete Response by Daniel Davis, M.D., dated January 12, 2005 (attached \nhereto as Exhibit H) at 1; Mem. Add. of Curtis J. Rosebraugh, M.D., dated January 12, 2005 \n(attached hereto as Exhibit I) at 2; Ex. G at 31031-33; Mem. of John Jenkins, M.D., dated \n  23 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 24 of 44 PageID #: 4136\nJanuary 14, 2005 (attached hereto as Exhibit J) at 31096-98; see also Mem. of Steven Galson, \nM.D., dated August 26, 2005 (attached hereto as Exhibit K) at 1.) \n89. The Director and Deputy Director of the Division of OTC Drug Products and the \nDirector of the Office of Drug Evaluation V stated that Plan B meets the criteria for unrestricted \nOTC access, that data to the contrary was lacking, and that because of the strength of the data \nbefore the agency, it is “unclear what additional data could be provided on adolescent use that \nwould be sufficient to lift the age restriction in the future.”  (Ex. I at 205.)  Under the FDA’s own \npolicies, these FDA employees would ordinarily have made the final decision to approve the \nOTC switch. \n90. FDA documents indicate that prior to January 21, 2005, the review staff at FDA were \nactively reviewing Barr’s application for split-label access to Plan B.  FDA has disclosed \napproximately sixteen documents that were placed in the Plan B docket during the month of \nJanuary 2005.  After January 21, 2005 and prior to August 2005, only two additional documents \nwere submitted. \n91. On July 13, 2005, the Secretary of Health and Human Services Michael O. Leavitt \nassured United States Senator Michael Enzi that “the FDA will act on this application [regarding \nOTC status for Plan B] by September 1, 2005.”  (See Letter of M. O. Leavitt, dated July 13, 2005 \n(attached hereto as Exhibit L).)  Counsel for the Government submitted the Leavitt letter to the \nCourt and requested that the Court delay the judicial proceedings: “[g]iven the agency’s \ncommitment to take action on the pending Plan B application within the next 45 days, we \nrespectfully submit that the most appropriate course of action would be to suspend the current \nbriefing schedule and stay this case until the FDA takes the anticipated action. . . .”  (Def.’s \nLetter to the Court, dated July 25, 2005 (attached hereto as Exhibit M), at 2.)   \n  24 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 25 of 44 PageID #: 4137\n92. Instead of the promised action, on August 26, 2005, FDA Commissioner Lester \nCrawford issued a letter to Joseph A. Carrado, stating that “the Agency is unable at this time to \nreach a decision on the approvability of the application because of unresolved issues that relate \nto your NDA . . . .”  (See Letter of Lester Crawford, M.D., dated August 26, 2005 (attached \nhereto as Exhibit N) at 5.)  The letter indicated that “[t]he Center for Drug Evaluation and \nResearch (CDER) has completed its review of this application, as amended, and has concluded \nthat the available scientific data are sufficient to support the safe use of Plan B as an OTC \nproduct, but only for women who are 17 years of age and older.”  (Id.)  In this letter, FDA further \nstated that age-restricted OTC access would not be available for Plan B before the agency \nreaches a decision on “unresolved issues” regarding the feasibility of approving split-label \naccess.  (Id.)   \n93. At or around the time of the August 26, 2005, Crawford decision, Deputy \nCommissioner Woodcock expressed her concern that the agency’s handling of Plan B had the \npotential to damage her professional credibility. \n94. United States Senator Enzi wrote to Commissioner Crawford after Crawford’s August \n26, 2005, letter, stating that he was “deeply disappointed that your announcement did not \ncomport with the agreed-upon deadline for a decision.” \n95. FDA sought public comment on “whether we should initiate a rulemaking to codify \nour interpretation of section 503(b) regarding when an active ingredient can be simultaneously \nmarketed in both a prescription drug product and an OTC drug product.”  (Ex. N at 2.) \n96. The FDA made the unusual decision to outsource to a private contractor the task of \ncollecting and reviewing comments submitted to the FDA regarding Plan B.   \n  25 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 26 of 44 PageID #: 4138\n97. On August 31, 2005, Dr. Susan F. Wood, assistant FDA commissioner for women’s \nhealth and director of the Office of Women’s Health announced that she was resigning from her \npost in reaction to the agency’s decision to continue to limit access to Plan B, stating: “I can no \nlonger serve as staff when scientific and clinical evidence, fully evaluated and recommended for \napproval by the professional staff here, has been overruled.”  See Marc Kaufman, FDA Official \nQuits Over Delay on Plan B, WASH. POST., Sept. 1, 2005, at A08 (attached hereto as Exhibit O) \nat 1 (quoting Susan F. Wood). \n98. On September 27, Dr. Wood appeared on the ABC television news program Nightline \nto discuss the failure of the agency to act in accordance with the scientific consensus in favor of \napproving Plan B for OTC use.  See ABC News transcript, dated September 27, 2005 (attached \nhereto as Exhibit P) at 4-6 (citing “consensus . . . amongst the scientists and health professionals \nthere that it should be approved,” and the fact that “all of the scientific and professional staff who \nnormally are the part of the decision-making at the agency . . .  were cut out of the decision.”).   \n99. Dr. Wood also stated that she was concerned about the lengthy delay that she \nanticipated as a result of the upcoming rule-making: \nDr. Wood: . . . But I would argue that the decision to delay approval of this \nproduct over-the-counter is, in fact, a denial.  And this is, again, in part \nwhy I resigned.  Because by couching it as a delay and a non-decision, \nin fact denied women of all ages, not just teens but women of all ages \naccess to timely use of this product. \nTed Koppel: (Off Camera) If you had thought that it was a brief delay, in other \nwords, if you thought it was only going to be a delay of a couple of \nmonths, you wouldn't have resigned. \nDr. Wood:  Probably not. \nTed Koppel:  (Off Camera) So, you obviously think that what we’re talking about \nhere is not really a delay but a way of shelving it and not dealing with \nthe issue. \n  26 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 27 of 44 PageID #: 4139\nDr. Wood: Right.  The mechanism is a rather bureaucratic one to potentially open \nit up to rulemaking.  Which, to make a long story short, means \nopening up to a process that usually takes many months to years, if in \nfact that’s the way they go.  \n(See Ex. P at 6-7.) \n100.  Dr. Frank Davidoff, a member of the Advisory Committee for Reproductive \nHealth Drugs, which considered the OTC switch application for Plan B, resigned from the \nadvisory committee due to the FDA’s lack of “rational science-based decision-making.”  He is \nthe only person ever to resign from an FDA advisory committee in protest of an agency action.  \n \nE.  The Government Accountability Office Investigated FDA’s May 2004 Decision Not \nto Approve Plan B for Full OTC Status and Found that the FDA’s Review Process \nRegarding Plan B Was “Unusual.” \n101.  The Government Accountability Office commenced an investigation for the \nUnited States Congress into why the FDA rejected the OTC switch on May 6, 2004. \n102.  On November 14, 2005, the Government Accountability Office issued a report to \nmembers of Congress examining the FDA’s May 6, 2004 issuance of a “non-approvable” letter \nwith regard to Barr Laboratory’s SNDA request that Plan B be made available over-the-counter.  \n(attached hereto as Exhibit Q, also available at http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d06109.pdf). \n103.  The report, titled “Food and Drug Administration Decision Process to Deny Initial \nApplication for Over-the-Counter Marketing of the Emergency Contraceptive Drug Plan B Was \nUnusual,” found that FDA’s review process was “unusual” in four aspects: \nFirst, the Directors of the Offices of Drug Evaluation III and V, who would \nnormally have been responsible for signing the Plan B action letter, disagreed \nwith the decision and did not sign the not-approvable letter for Plan B. The \nDirector of the Office of New Drugs also disagreed and did not sign the letter.  \nSecond, FDA’s high-level management was more involved in the review of Plan \nB than in those of other OTC switch applications. … Third, … there are \nconflicting accounts of whether the decision to not approve the application was \nmade before the reviews were completed. Fourth, the rationale for the Acting \nDirector of CDER’s decision was novel and did not follow FDA’s traditional \n  27 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 28 of 44 PageID #: 4140\npractices. Specifically, the Acting Director was concerned about the potential \nimpact that the OTC marketing of Plan B would have on the propensity for \nyounger adolescents to engage in unsafe sexual behaviors because of their lack of \ncognitive maturity compared to older adolescents. He also stated that it was \ninvalid to extrapolate data from older to younger adolescents in this case. FDA \nreview officials noted that the agency has not considered behavioral implications \ndue to differences in cognitive development in prior OTC switch decisions and \nthat the agency has considered it scientifically appropriate to extrapolate data \nfrom older to younger adolescents. [Emphasis added] \n(Ex. Q at 5.)   \n104.  In summary, the GAO found that the decision-making process was “not typical,” \nwas unlike all of the 67 other OTC switch applications filed between 1994 and 2004, and that the \nPlan B OTC switch application was the only one during that 10 year time period that “was not \napproved after the joint committee voted to recommend approval of the application.”  Id.  The \nGAO Report concludes that the FDA’s decision-making process was unusual and that high-level \nofficials were reported to be involved in the decision-making process. \n105.  Former FDA Commissioner Mark McClellan provided only an evasive and non-\nresponsive written statement to detailed written questions submitted by the GAO regarding the \ndecision to issue a non-approvable letter to Barr in May 2004 (questions and non-response \nattached as Exhibit W). \n106.  Former FDA Commissioner Mark McClellan improperly deleted electronic \ncorrespondence related to the OTC application for Plan B.  See Letter of United States \nCongressman Henry Waxman, dated November 15, 2005 (attached hereto as Exhibit R). \n107.  Former FDA Commissioner Lester Crawford also declined to be interviewed by \nthe GAO in conjunction with their report. \n \n  28 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 29 of 44 PageID #: 4141\nF.  Government Documents Confirm the Findings of the GAO Report that Upper Level \nManagement Were Unusually Active in the Decision-Making Process Regarding the \nOTC Switch Application for Plan B, and that Upper Level Management Overrode \nthe Recommendations of the Review Staff. \n108.  The administrative record compiled by the agency confirms that as early as \nJanuary 15, 2004, upper level management at FDA had decided that the OTC switch for Plan B \nwould not be approved, and that this decision was made before the scientific review of the OTC \nswitch application was complete.  \n109.  The administrative record compiled by the agency confirms that the Office of the \nCommissioner was involved in the agency’s review of the OTC switch application for Plan B \nsince at least December 10, 2003, and that the concerns about adolescent use of Plan B expressed \nby Dr. Galson in his May 2004 non-approvable letter, as well as the concerns about adolescent \nuse of Plan B expressed by Dr. Galson in his August 26, 2005 memorandum, echo and reflect the \nconcerns of the Office of the Commissioner expressed in January of 2004. \n110.  Documents show that both the Commissioner of the FDA and the Deputy \nCommissioner of Operations played an unusually active role in the decision to issue a non-\napprovable letter, as well as in subsequent agency action on Plan B.  The Directors of the Offices \nof Drug Evaluation III and V told GAO investigators that they were asked by high level \nmanagement to draft and sign a non-approvable letter for Plan B, but that they declined to do so \nbecause they did not agree with that action.  The Director of the Office of New Drugs was then \nasked to review the Plan B application.  Involving the Director of the Office of New Drugs in \nissuing such a letter is very rare and, according to FDA policy and procedure manuals, is limited \nto situations where there is disagreement between the two reviewing offices.  (Ex. Q at 20).  The \nDirector of the Office of New Drugs also declined to sign a non-approvable letter based on his \ndisagreement with the decision.  Id.   \n  29 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 30 of 44 PageID #: 4142\n111.  The FDA’s Deputy Director of the Office of Drug Evaluation V stated in a \nmemorandum that the issues raised by FDA political appointees concerning adolescents’ access \nto Plan B “spuriously raise the review standard for approval of this product and indeed any \ncontraceptive product,” and are not supported by the data nor the medical literature.    \n112.  In the past ten years, except in the case of Plan B and certain nicotine-related \ndrugs, the FDA has never requested additional data regarding adolescents to be submitted by \nmanufacturers seeking OTC switches.   \n113.  The non-approvable letter in May 2004 and the August 26, 2005 decision to \nfurther withhold approval of Plan B for OTC use were opposed by the scientific review staff that \nwould normally be responsible for making decisions approving drugs for OTC use.  CDER \nreviewers in the Divisions of Reproductive and Urologic Drug Products and the Division of \nOver-the-Counter Drug Products, the Deputy Directors of the Offices of Drug Evaluation III and \nV, and the Director of the Office of New drugs all recommended that Plan B should be switched \nOTC for women of all ages. \nG.  Barr Laboratories Was Asked to File Another Amended Supplemental New Drug \nApplication Seeking Further Arbitrary Age-Restricted OTC Status for Plan B, \nwhich Resulted in Plan B Remaining Behind-the-Counter and Available Without a \nPrescription Only For Some Persons 18 and Older.   \n114.  On July 31, 2006, the day before Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach’s Senate \nconfirmation hearing, the FDA announced that it would work with Barr Pharmaceuticals to allow \nfor OTC sales to persons 18 and older, hoping to “wrap[] up the process in a matter of weeks.”  \n(FDA Statement, dated July 31, 2006, http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2006/ \nNEW01421.html).  \n115.  Also on July 31, 2006, von Eschenbach wrote to Barr Pharmaceuticals and stated \nthat while he would not approve Barr’s request for OTC sales for those 16 and over, he would \n  30 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 31 of 44 PageID #: 4143\nreconsider allowing nonprescription sale of Plan B to persons 18 and older if the company met \ncertain restrictions.  This letter offered no explanation for the scientific or policy reasoning to \nsupport the line being drawn at the age of 18.  (Letter from Andrew von Eschenbach M.D. to \nJoseph A. Carrado, dated July 31, 2006, http://www.fda.gov/oc/planb/duramed073106.html). \n116.  On August 8, 2006, personnel from the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research \nmet with Barr to discuss the restrictions outlined in von Eschenbach’s July 31 letter, specifically \nwith regard to nonprescription packaging for purchasers 18 and over.  \n117.  On August, 17, 18 and 23, 2006, Barr amended its application to reflect changes \nin compliance with von Eschenbach’s proposed restrictions, specifically with regard to labeling \nand the Convenient Access Responsible Education (CARE) Program.   \n118.  In light of Barr’s revised SNDA, the FDA again reviewed Plan B and again its \nmedical reviewers confirmed that an age restriction for Plan B as an OTC drug is medically and \nscientifically unsupported.   \n119.   On August 22, 2006, Julie Beitz, M.D., Acting Director of the Center for Drug \nEvaluation and Research, stated: “This memo documents my view that there are sufficient data \non the safety and effectiveness of Plan B to approve its use in the OTC setting without age-\nrestriction.  In the absence of new data to support an age-restriction, my conclusions as stated in \nmy previous memos, dated April 2, 2004, and January 12, 2005, remain unchanged.”   \n120.  On August 22, 2006, Charles J. Ganley, M.D., Director of the Office of \nNonprescription Products (ONP), stated: “Previous reviews from the Division of Over-the-\nCounter Drug Products (DOTCDP) and Office of Drug Evaluation V (ODE V), signed by Dr. \nRosebraugh and Dr. Bull, recommended the sale of Plan B over-the-counter without restrictions.  \nDOTCDP and ODEV have evolved into the ONP.  No new data was provided to suggest the \n  31 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 32 of 44 PageID #: 4144\nrestriction based on age is necessary.  Based on the previous findings . . . ONP continues to \nbelieve that restriction on access is not necessary.”  \n121.  On August 22, 2006, John K. Jenkins, M.D., Director of the Office of New Drugs, \nstated: “As documented in my reviews dated April 28, 2004, and January 18, 2005, I believe the \navailable data are adequate to support a conclusion that Plan B can be safely and effectively \nmarketed as a nonprescription product for all women of child-bearing potential . . . I am not \naware of any new data that supports an age restriction for OTC marketing of Plan B . . . I \ncontinue to recommend that Plan B be approved for OTC marketing without an age restriction.”   \n122.  On August 23, 2006, von Eschenbach issued a memorandum that outlined his \nconclusions regarding the appropriateness of 18 as a cut-off age for OTC usage of Plan B.   \n123.  The August 23, 2006 von Eschenbach memorandum begins by stating that Barr \nPharmaceuticals amended its SNDA to make the OTC switch applicable only to those 18 and \nolder. \n124.  The August 23, 2006 von Eschenbach memorandum states that in response to “the \ndifficulty of enforcing an age-based restriction . . . I have concluded that 18 (rather than 17) is \nthe more appropriate cutoff point . . .”  \n125.  There are no scientific or health related reasons for choosing 18 as a cutoff age.  \nThe only asserted basis for choosing 18 is because dispensers of Plan B “ . . . (as well as society \nas a whole) are more familiar with 18 as a cutoff age.”   \n126.  The August 23, 2006 memorandum purports to justify the 18 year old age cutoff \nby analogy to tobacco products.   Tobacco products have proven and severe harmful health \neffects, including hundreds of thousands of deaths annually, on persons of all ages.  There is no \n  32 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 33 of 44 PageID #: 4145\nscientific evidence that Plan B has any serious side effects whatsoever, nor is any such evidence \ncited in this or any other FDA memorandum.  \n127.  The August 23, 2006 memorandum also purports to justify the 18 year old age \ncutoff by analogy to products containing pseudoephedrine.  Such products have a demonstrated \nrecord of abuse, specifically as a compound used by illegal drug traffickers to manufacture \nmethamphetamines, which are controlled substances.  There is no evidence or even plausible \nscientific basis to believe that Plan B can be or is used to manufacture controlled substances, or \nthat Plan B is abused in any way by any women, nor is any such evidence cited in this or any \nother FDA memorandum.   \n128.    On August 24, 2006, Steven Galson issued an approval letter to Barr, granting \nlimited approval for nonprescription sales of Plan B to those who could provide government \nissued proof that they are 18 years of age or older, and adopting von Eschenbach’s stated \nrationale for the age 18 cutoff.  \n129.  The FDA has therefore at long last admitted that it has rejected OTC status for \nPlan B. \n130.  In March 1991, the FDA stated: “Some health professional organizations have \npetitioned FDA to establish a third class of drugs that would be available without prescription, \nbut only through a pharmacist.  Pharmacists would advise consumers about proper use of the \ndrug and serve to identify problems that might arise.  In 1974, in connection with an FDA \nmonograph on OTC antacids, some pharmacy organizations commented that such a third class of \ndrugs should be created.  Others, including the Department of Justice, objected to a third class of \ndrugs, stating that it would restrain competition, inconvenience the consumer, depart from U.S. \neconomic policy, and cause price increases for the consumer with no attending benefit.  FDA \n  33 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 34 of 44 PageID #: 4146\nconcluded that ‘no controlled studies or other adequate research data have been supplied to \nsupport the position that any class of OTC drugs must be dispensed only by pharmacists in order \nto ensure their safe use. . . . There is at this time no public health concern that would justify the \ncreation of a third class of drugs to be dispensed only by a pharmacist or in a pharmacy.”  See \n“Rx to OTC: The Switch Is On,” http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/CONSUMER/CN00012c.html.   \n131.  In its review of Barr’s amended SNDA for limited OTC status for Plan B for \nwomen 16 and older, the FDA review staff, in addition to finding that the scientific data \nsupported full OTC access for women of all ages, expressed strong concern over the regulatory \nprecedent that approval of a dual prescription/nonprescription regime for Plan B would set and \nthe possible unintended consequences of such a regime.  (Ex. I at 31026-27; Ex. G at 31031-32; \nMem. of Julie Beitz, M.D., dated January 12, 2005 (attached hereto as Exhibit X) at 31085-\n31087; Ex. J at 31096-98). \n132.  Plan B is the only nonprescription drug required by the FDA to be kept behind the \npharmacy counter.  Prior to August 24, 2006, “behind-the-counter” status was not mandated by \nthe FDA for any drug.  Thus, Plan B is the first nonprescription drug the FDA has ever mandated \nto be kept behind the counter.   \n133.  In Canada, where levonorgestrel is available behind-the-counter from \npharmacists, some pharmacists exploited the behind-the-counter status of the drug to ask women \ninvasive questions about their sexual activity before providing the drug.   \n134.  Numerous over-the-counter drugs available off the shelf in gas stations, \nconvenience stores, drug stores, supermarkets and other points of sale have established records \nof misuse, abuse (including use as a means of committing suicide by overdose), and serious side \neffects.  In no case does the FDA mandate age-restricted sales or proof of age.     \n  34 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 35 of 44 PageID #: 4147\n135.  Nicotine-replacement products are restricted as nonprescription products to \npersons over the age of 18, yet even these products, with proven harmful effects and serious side \neffects for certain high-risk populations, are not kept behind the pharmacy counter. \n136.  Contrary to the stated policy concerns regarding enforceability of an age cutoff, \nthe requisite labeling included in a package of Plan B, which states the actual scientific findings \nof the FDA, makes clear that there is no data evidencing a danger of overdosage or drug \ndependence with regard to Plan B.  (FDA Labeling, dated August 24, 2006, \nhttp://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/2006/021045s011lbl.pdf). \n137.  The labeling for Plan B states:  “Pediatric Use: Safety and efficacy of progestin-\nonly pills have been established in women of reproductive age for long-term contraception.  \nSafety and efficacy are expected to be the same for postpubertal adolescents under the age of 16 \nand for users 16 years and older.  Use of Plan B &emergency contraception before menarche is \n \nnot indicated.”  (FDA Labeling, dated August 24, 2006, http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/ \n2006/021045s011lbl.pdf).  \nH.  FDA’s Failure to Approve Plan B for Full OTC Use Constitutes Bad Faith and \nImproper Agency Action, and Treats Plan B Differently than Other Drugs Without \nAny Medical or Scientific Basis for that Differential Treatment. \n138.  The FDA applied a different and higher standard to Plan B’s OTC switch than it \nhas applied to OTC switches of other drugs.   \n139.  In the past ten years, Plan B is the only drug as to which the FDA has rejected \nadvisory committee recommendations in favor of approving a drug for OTC status.  \n140.  In the past ten years, Plan B is the only drug as to which the FDA has requested \nadditional data regarding adolescents. \n141.  In the past five years, the FDA has approved several OTC switch applications \nwithout any label comprehension studies or actual use studies that included adolescents. \n  35 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 36 of 44 PageID #: 4148\n142.  There is no medical or scientific basis for the FDA’s application of a different and \nhigher standard to Plan B’s OTC switch for women of all ages. \n143.  The FDA’s failure to approve Plan B for OTC use by women of all ages is based \nin part on outmoded stereotypes of women and girls. \n144.  For example, the FDA routinely extrapolates from data from one age group to \ndraw conclusions about another age group.  Indeed, prior to the manufacturer’s 2003 submission \nof its OTC switch application, FDA informed the manufacturer that it would not obtain an \nextension of its patent for Plan B by conducting extra pediatric studies, for such studies were \nrendered unnecessary because information about adolescents could be extrapolated from data for \nadults.  But Galson and his supervisors refused to implement this routine method as to Plan B. \n145.  In addition, the FDA rejected the manufacturer’s pediatric exclusivity for Plan B, \nspecifically informing the manufacturer in April of 2002 that it could conduct its “proposed trials \n[of Plan B] in the adult population and the results extrapolated to the postmenarcheal pediatric \npopulation.”  The FDA’s subsequent rejection of extrapolation from studies in adult populations \nconstitutes improper and bad faith agency action. \n146.  The FDA’s application of a different and higher standard to Plan B’s OTC switch \nwas the result of factors that fall outside the FDA’s statutory mandate, including impermissible \nideological factors, such as appeasement of the President’s constituents. \n147.  The FDA’s rejection of the OTC switch for women of all ages is not supported by \nmedical or scientific evidence and not supported by the agency record. \n148.  The fact that upper-level management at FDA removed the decision of whether to \napprove Plan B’s OTC application from the hands of the professional review staff, that upper-\nlevel management dictated the outcome of the review process, and that upper-level management \n  36 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 37 of 44 PageID #: 4149\ndeviated from the standard practices and policies set forth in their own manuals and handbooks, \nsuggests that the FDA impermissibly held the Plan B OTC switch application to a higher \nstandard than other drugs, and that doing so constitutes bad faith and improper agency action.  \n149.  Where upper level agency management made decisions regarding the status of the \nPlan B application before the scientific review process has been completed, such premature \ndecision-making constitutes bad faith and improper action by an agency dedicated to promoting \nand protecting public health. \n150.  The former FDA Commissioner Mark McClellan’s destruction of email \ncorrespondence and refusal to cooperate with the GAO’s investigation constitute bad faith and \nimproper agency action.  \n151.  The record indicates that Barr’s application was not actively reviewed after \nJanuary of 2005, causing the seven month delay between the conclusion of the scientific review \nand any further agency action.  This was unreasonable and constituted bad faith and improper \nagency action.  \n152.  The fact that the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) submitted a \nletter to the Senate assuring Senators that FDA would act on the OTC application for Plan B by \nSeptember 1, 2005, but that the only action subsequently taken by the agency was to invite \npublic comment on a proposed rulemaking proceeding, constitutes bad faith and improper \nagency action. \n153.  The FDA’s June 9, 2006 letter denying the Citizen Petition is evidence of bad \nfaith and improper agency behavior.  First, it asserts that the FDA made a determination in 2001 \nthat the Citizen Petition could not be approved, but this determination was never communicated \nto the petitioners.  Second, it asserts that the Citizen Petition filers cannot use evidence submitted \n  37 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 38 of 44 PageID #: 4150\nby Barr to support their Petition, but then relies on the Barr submissions extensively.  Third, the \nletter contradicts statements made to the Court in December of 2005 by counsel for the \nDefendant to the effect that the Citizen Petition was still under active consideration by the FDA.  \nFourth, the letter is on its face a litigation document issued in direct response to this lawsuit \nrather than agency action taken in the ordinary course of agency business.  For these and other \nreasons, the June 9, 2006, letter admitting denial of the Citizen Petition is evidence of improper \nand bad faith agency action. \n154.  The FDA’s decision imposing “behind-the-counter” status for Plan B and \ncontrolling the point of sale of Plan B is unprecedented and discriminates against Plan B because \nit is a contraceptive drug and because it is used only by women without serving any compelling, \nsignificant, or even legitimate governmental interest.  Indeed, by comparison to numerous OTC \ndrugs available off the shelf and without any point-of-sale restriction, the FDA’s restrictions on \nPlan B are invidious and contrary to public health.  The selective imposition of a behind-the-\ncounter regime for Plan B demonstrates improper agency action and bad faith. \n155.  The assertion by the Defendant that the FDA was adopting the “infrastructure” \nused by states to regulate tobacco products and applying it to Plan B demonstrates improper \nagency action and bad faith both because this adoption lacks any scientific or medical basis, and \nbecause the FDA’s restrictions on Plan B have nothing other than the age of 18 in common with \nthe infrastructure of state regulation of tobacco products. \n156.  The FDA’s requirement of a prescription for Plan B for women aged 17 \ndemonstrates improper agency action and bad faith because it lacks any scientific or medical \nbasis and contradicts prior public statements by the FDA acknowledging the safety of Plan B as \nan OTC drug for women 17 and over.   \n  38 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 39 of 44 PageID #: 4151\n157.  The FDA’s August 24, 2006, action rejecting OTC status for Plan B and instead \nimposing the BTC regime for Plan B specifically permits men 18 and over to buy Plan B without \na prescription even though there is no FDA-approved use of Plan B for men, and no scientific \ndata whatsoever about actual use or label comprehension by men is contained in the agency \nrecord.  Permitting men 18 and over to buy Plan B without a prescription, even though there is \nno medical evidence supporting any use by men of Plan B, while denying nonprescription status \nfor women under 18 despite extensive supporting scientific data, demonstrates that the FDA’s \nAugust 24, 2006 decision is based on stereotypes of young women and is utterly irrational.  It \nalso demonstrates that the FDA’s recent action establishing an age-restricted behind-the-counter \ndual prescription/nonprescription regime for Plan B is improper and was done in bad faith. \n158.  The behind-the-counter regime is demeaning to and discriminates \ninvidiously against women of all ages because it poses unique barriers to access for a very safe \ndrug that can be used safely and effectively without a prescription by all women of childbearing \nage while numerous other over-the-counter drugs are not subject to any such barriers, including \nmany for which use without a prescription is discouraged for persons below a certain age \nbecause safe over-the-counter use by such younger age groups has never been established. \n \n159.  No drug used only by men and no drug used by both sexes is subject to the same \nbehind-the-counter regime as Plan B.   \n160.  The timing of the FDA’s August 24, 2006 age-restricted behind-the-counter dual \nprescription/nonprescription regime for Plan B to coincide with the Senate confirmation hearing \nof the acting commissioner of the FDA evinces improper and bad faith agency action. \n161.  At his Senate confirmation hearing on August 1, 2006, the Defendant \ndemonstrated improper agency behavior and bad faith by misleading the Senate Committee on \n  39 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 40 of 44 PageID #: 4152\nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions in testifying that the age 18 cutoff he was requiring for \nPlan B was based on inadequate data about OTC use of Plan B for 17-year-olds and based on \npublic comments submitted in response to the advanced notice of proposed rulemaking.  His \nAugust 23, 2006 memorandum and a review of the comments submitted contradict these bases \nfor the age 18 cutoff.  \n \nV.  Causes of Action \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION: ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS \n162.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate by reference ¶¶ 1-161 above. \n163.  FDA’s denial of the OTC switch for women of all ages and imposition of the \nBTC regime are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion and otherwise not in accordance \nwith law, in violation of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(a) (2005) in that the FDA required evidence of safety \nand efficacy beyond that required for approval of any other drugs and was improperly motivated \nby factors other than medicine and science, and because the evidence of safety and efficacy \nbefore the FDA demonstrates that it should be made available without prescription without any \nfurther restriction. \n \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION: EXCEEDS STATUTORY AUTHORITY \n164.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate by reference ¶¶ 1-163 above. \n165.  FDA’s denial of the OTC switch for women of all ages and its imposition of the \nBTC regime exceed its statutory authority in violation of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(c) in that they were \nimproperly motivated by factors other than medicine and science and in that the FDA lacks \nauthority to control the point of sale of nonprescription drug products. \n  40 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 41 of 44 PageID #: 4153\n \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION: RIGHT TO PRIVACY \n166.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate by reference ¶¶ 1-165 above. \n167.  FDA’s denial of the OTC switch for women of all ages and its imposition of the \nBTC regime violate the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and 5 U.S.C. § \n706(2)(b) in that it infringes the right to privacy of women who need Plan B without serving or \nbeing tailored to serve any compelling, significant, or legitimate governmental interest. \n \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION: EQUAL PROTECTION \n168.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate by reference ¶¶ 1-167 above. \n169.  FDA’s denial of the OTC switch for women of all ages and its imposition of the \nBTC regime violate the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and 5 U.S.C. § \n706(2)(b) in that it discriminates on the basis of sex without serving or being tailored to serve \nany compelling, significant, or legitimate governmental interest.  \n170.  FDA’s denial of the OTC switch for women of all ages and its imposition of the \nBTC regime violate the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and 5 U.S.C. § \n706(2)(b) in that it discriminates on the basis of the exercise of the fundamental right to privacy \nto obtain contraception and to keep certain personal information private without serving or being \ntailored to serve any compelling, significant, or legitimate governmental interest.   \n \nFIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION: INFORMATIONAL PRIVACY \n171.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate by reference ¶¶ 1-170 above. \n  41 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00366-ERK-VVP   Document 207   Filed 10/10/06   Page 42 of 44 PageID #: 4154\n172.  FDA’s denial of the OTC switch for women of all ages and its imposition of the \nBTC regime violate the right to informational privacy for women who are required by the \ngovernment to disclose their name, age, and address to private parties in order to obtain Plan B.  \nThis requirement does not serve and is not tailored to serve any compelling, significant, or \nlegitimate governmental interest. \n \nVI.  Prayer for Relief \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs ask this Court: \nA.  To issue an injunction ordering Defendant to approve Plan B as an over-the-counter \ndrug without age or point of sale restriction for women of all ages; \nB.  To enter judgment declaring the denial of OTC status of Plan B to women of all ages \nin violation of the United States Constitution and 5 U.S.C. § 706; and \nC.  To grant such other and further relief as this Court should find just and proper, \nincluding attorneys’ fees and costs. \n \n \nDated: October 10, 2006.

TORTI,∗ Acting Commissioner of the Food  \nand Drug Administration,     \n                  \n        Defendant.       \n-----------------------------------------------------------------X \n \nKORMAN, J.: \n  Plan B is an emergency contraceptive that can be used to reduce the risk of unwanted \npregnancy after sexual intercourse.  When used as directed, it can reduce the risk of pregnancy \nby up to 89 percent.  Plan B acts mainly by stopping the release of an egg from an ovary.  It may \nalso prevent sperm from fertilizing an egg that has been released or, if fertilization has already \noccurred, block implantation of the resulting embryo in the uterus.  Plan B does not have any \nknown serious or long-term side effects, though it may have some mild and short-term side \neffects, such as nausea or abdominal pain, in some users.  The approved dosage of Plan B is two \npills taken 12 hours apart, each containing 0.75 mg of levonorgestrel, a synthetic hormone \nsimilar to the naturally occurring hormone progesterone.  Because the drug works best when \ntaken within 24 hours of sexual intercourse, it is commonly referred to as a “morning-after pill.”  \nNevertheless, the drug is effective if the first dose is taken within 72 hours of sexual intercourse.  \n                                                           \n∗ Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d), Acting Commissioner Frank M. Torti has been \nsubstituted for former Commissioner Andrew C. von Eschenbach as defendant in this case.  Earlier in this \nlitigation, Commissioner von Eschenbach was substituted for former Commissioner Lester M. Crawford, \nthe original named defendant. \n \n  1\n\n \nStudies have shown that Plan B is equally effective if the two doses of levonorgestrel are taken \nless than 12 hours apart or at the same time. \n  Plan B was approved for prescription-only use in the United States in 1999 and is the \nonly emergency contraceptive drug currently available in the United States.  Plan B and other \nemergency contraceptives with the same active ingredient are available without a prescription or \nage  restriction  in  much  of  the  world,  including  virtually  all  major  industrialized  nations.  \nPlaintiffs  –  individuals  and  organizations  advocating  wider  distribution  of  and  access  to \nemergency contraceptives, as well as parents and their minor children seeking access to the same \n– brought this action challenging the denial of a Citizen Petition, which requested that the Food \nand Drug Administration (“FDA”) make Plan B available without a prescription to women of all \nages.   \n  The FDA considered the Citizen Petition in tandem with a number of proposals – referred \nto  as  supplemental  new  drug  applications  (“SNDA”)  –  submitted  by  Women’s  Capital \nCorporation, the drug’s original manufacturer.  Women’s Capital Corporation sold its right to \nmarket Plan B to Barr Pharmaceuticals, Inc. during the course of the proceedings described \nbelow.  I refer to them collectively as the “Plan B sponsor.”  The first SNDA, like the Citizen \nPetition, sought non-prescription access to Plan B for women of all ages.  After the FDA denied \nsuch access, the Plan B sponsor submitted a second SNDA, seeking non-prescription access for \nwomen 16 and older.  The FDA rejected that application too despite nearly uniform agreement \namong  FDA  scientific  review  staff  that  women  of  all  ages  could  use  Plan  B  without  a \nprescription safely and effectively.  The Plan B sponsor then submitted a third SNDA, which \nproposed making Plan B available without a prescription to women 17 and older.  While FDA \nscientists  and  senior  officials  found  that  17  year  olds  could  use  Plan  B  safely  without  a \n  2\n\n \nprescription, the FDA Commissioner determined that, because of “enforcement” concerns, Plan \nB would be available without a prescription only to women 18 and older.  Putting aside for the \nmoment the specifics of the many claims brought by plaintiffs and the details of each of the \nFDA’s decisions, the gravamen of plaintiffs’ claims is that the FDA’s decisions regarding Plan B \n– on the Citizen Petition and the SNDAs – were arbitrary and capricious because they were not \nthe result of reasoned and good faith agency decision-making.  \n  Plaintiffs are right.  The FDA repeatedly and unreasonably delayed issuing a decision on \nPlan B for suspect reasons and, on two occasions, only took action on Plan B to facilitate \nconfirmation of Acting FDA Commissioners, whose confirmation hearings had been held up due \nto these repeated delays.  The first occasion involved the confirmation of then-Acting FDA \nCommissioner Lester M. Crawford, who froze the review process for seven months in 2005.  In \norder to overcome a hold that had been placed on his nomination by two Senators, the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services promised that the FDA would act on Plan B by September 2005.  \nAfter Dr. Crawford was confirmed by the Senate in July 2005, however, he reneged on the \npromise and, instead, delayed action another eleven months to pursue, and then abandon, a \nrulemaking with respect to Plan B.   There is also evidence that when the FDA finally decided to \napprove non-prescription use of Plan B for women 18 and older, it did so to facilitate the \nconfirmation of Commissioner Crawford’s successor, then-Acting FDA Commissioner Andrew \nC. von Eschenbach, whose confirmation certain Senators had vowed to block because of the \ncontinued delays on Plan B.     \n  These political considerations, delays, and implausible justifications for decision-making \nare not the only evidence of a lack of good faith and reasoned agency decision-making.  Indeed, \nthe record is clear that the FDA’s course of conduct regarding Plan B departed in significant \n  3\n\n \nways from the agency’s normal procedures regarding similar applications to switch a drug \nproduct from prescription to non-prescription use, referred to as a “switch application” or an \n“over-the-counter switch.”   For example, FDA upper management, including the Commissioner, \nwrested control over the decision-making on Plan B from staff that normally would issue the \nfinal decision on an over-the-counter switch application; the FDA’s denial of non-prescription \naccess without age restriction went against the recommendation of a committee of experts it had \nempanelled to advise it on Plan B;  and the Commissioner – at the behest of political actors – \ndecided to deny non-prescription access to women 16 and younger before FDA scientific review \nstaff had completed their reviews.  \n  In light of this evidence, the FDA’s denial of the Citizen Petition is vacated and the \nmatter is remanded to the FDA for reconsideration of whether to approve Plan B for over-the-\ncounter status without age or point-of-sale restrictions.  While the FDA is free, on remand, to \nexercise its expertise and discretion regarding the proper disposition of the Citizen Petition, no \nuseful purpose would be served by continuing to deprive 17 year olds access to Plan B without a \nprescription.  Indeed, the record shows that FDA officials and staff both agreed that 17 years olds \ncan use Plan B safely without a prescription.  The FDA’s justification for this age restriction, that \npharmacists would be unable to enforce the prescription requirement if the cutoff were age 17, \nrather than 18, lacks all credibility.   \n  I  now  proceed  to  outline  the  statutory  and  regulatory  framework  for  the  FDA’s \nconsideration of over-the-counter switch applications in general, detail the FDA’s evaluations of \nand decisions regarding Plan B, and recount the procedural history of this action.  I then turn to \nthe merits of plaintiffs’ claim that the FDA’s denial of the Plan B was arbitrary and capricious.   \n  4\n\n \nI.   Background \nA.   Statutory and Regulatory Background \n  Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), 21 U.S.C. §§ 301 et seq., no \nnew drug product may be sold in the United States unless the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices (“Secretary”) first approves a new drug application (“NDA”) submitted by the drug’s \nsponsor.  Id. § 355.  The Secretary delegated primary responsibility over drug regulation to the \nCommissioner of the FDA (“Commissioner”).  Id. § 393(d).  As part of the NDA, the drug \nsponsor must submit, inter alia, “full reports of investigations which have been made to show \nwhether or not such drug is safe for use and whether such drug is effective in use” to the FDA.  \nId. § 355(b)(1)(A).  An NDA will be denied if “the investigations . . . do not include adequate \ntests by all methods reasonably applicable to show whether or not such drug is safe for use under \nthe conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof,” “the \nresults of such tests show that such drug is unsafe for use under such conditions or do not show \nthat such drug is safe for use under such conditions,” or there is “insufficient information to \ndetermine whether such drug is safe for use under such conditions.”  Id. §§ 355(d)(1), (2), (4).   \n  A drug must be dispensed by prescription if, “because of its toxicity or other potentiality \nfor harmful effect, or the method of its use, or the collateral measures necessary to its use, [it] is \nnot safe for use except under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such \ndrug.”  Id. § 353(b)(1)(A).  A drug may be moved from prescription-only to non-prescription \nstatus when the Secretary deems that the prescription requirement is not necessary for the \nprotection of the public health.  Id. § 353(b)(3).  Specifically, the applicable regulation provides \nthat:  \nAny drug limited to prescription use . . . shall be exempted from prescription-\ndispensing requirements when the Commissioner finds such requirements are not \n  5\n\n \nnecessary for the protection of the public health by reason of the drug’s toxicity or \nother potentiality for harmful effect, or the method of its use, or the collateral \nmeasures necessary to its use, and he finds that the drug is safe and effective for \nuse in self-medication as directed in proposed labeling. \n \n21 C.F.R. § 310.200(b).  Many new drugs are initially approved for prescription-only status and \nthen later considered for non-prescription status, i.e., an over-the-counter or OTC switch.  A drug \nis suitable for OTC use when found to be safe and effective for self-administration and when its \nlabeling clearly provides directions for safe use and warnings regarding unsafe use, side effects, \nand adverse reactions.  See id. § 330.10(a)(4).  These regulations were promulgated following the \nadoption of the Durham-Humphrey Amendment to the FDCA in 1951.  The amendment was \nintended, in part, “to relieve retail pharmacists and the public from burdensome and unnecessary \nrestrictions  on  the  dispensing  of  drugs  that  are  safe  for  use  without  the  supervision  of  a \nphysician.”  S. Rep. No. 82-946 (1951), as reprinted in 1951 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2454, 2454; H.R. \nRep. No. 82-700 at 2454 (1951). \n  There are two means by which the FDA can switch a prescription-only drug to non-\nprescription status.  First, it can promulgate a regulation changing the drug’s status.  See 21 \nU.S.C. § 353(b)(3).  This rulemaking process may be initiated by the Commissioner, 21 C.F.R. \n§ 310.200(b), or by any interested person who files a citizen petition.  Id. § 10.25(a).  Within 180 \ndays of receipt of the petition, the Commissioner must either approve or deny the petition or \nprovide “a tentative response [to the petitioner], indicating why the agency has been unable to \nreach a decision on the petition.”  Id. § 10.30(e)(2)(iii).  Alternatively, a drug sponsor may \nrequest an over-the-counter switch.  Id. § 310.200(b).  Unlike the first mechanism, this process \ndoes not require rulemaking.  See 21 U.S.C. §§ 355(c), (d); 21 C.F.R. § 314.71.  Nevertheless, \nonly the drug sponsor can supplement its initial new drug application.  21 C.F.R. § 314.71(a).  \n  6\n\n \nAll of the rules and procedures applicable to new drug applications, discussed above, apply to \nsupplemental new drug applications (SNDAs).  Id. § 314.71(c).  \nThe  Commissioner  delegated  authority  over  OTC  switch  applications  to  the  FDA’s \nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (“CDER”). FDA Staff Manual Guidelines (“SMG”) \n1410.30(1), 1410.104(1).  OTC switch applications are reviewed by two offices within CDER: \nthe Office of Drug Evaluation (“ODE”) V, which reviews all OTC switch applications, and, in \nthis case, the ODE III, which includes the Division of Reproductive and Urologic Drug Products \n(“DRUDP”).  CDER may seek scientific advice from outside experts by empanelling an advisory \ncommittee to provide a recommendation on an application.  After reviewing the OTC switch \napplication and the advice of the advisory committee, the directors of the two ODEs make a \ndecision.  If the Director of CDER disagrees with that decision, the Director may change the \ndecision.  Pls.’ Ex. B at 9 (General Accountability Office, Food and Drug Administration: \nDecision Process to Deny Initial Application for Over-the-Counter Marketing of the Emergency \nContraceptive Drug Plan B Was Unusual, GAO Doc. No. GAO-06-109 (November 2005), \nhereinafter “GAO Report”).   \nB.   Factual Background   \n  In February 1997, the FDA announced that certain combined oral contraceptives are safe \nand effective for emergency use, and requested sponsors to submit new drug applications for that \nuse.  On July 28, 1999, the FDA approved an NDA for Plan B submitted by the Plan B sponsor.  \nPlan B then became available to consumers in the United States on a prescription-only basis.   \n1.    Filing of the Citizen Petition and First OTC Switch Application  \n \n  On February 14, 2001, one of the named plaintiffs, the Association of Reproductive \nHealth Professionals (“ARHP”), and sixty-five other organizations (together the “petitioners”) \n  7\n\n \nfiled a Citizen Petition, asking the FDA to switch Plan B, and all emergency contraceptives like \nit, from prescription-only to over-the-counter status without age or point-of-sale restrictions.  The \npetition included affidavits from Dr. David Grimes, the chair of the World Health Organization \ntask force that had conducted the largest and most definitive trials on Plan B to date, and Dr. \nElizabeth Raymond, who conducted the label comprehension and actual use studies which the \nPlan  B  sponsor  would  ultimately  submit  in  support  of  its  SNDA.    Numerous  national \norganizations,  including  the  American  Medical  Association,  the  American  College  of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Public Health Association, endorsed the \npetition.  Def.’s Ex. 1 at CP020-28. \n  Upon receipt of the Citizen Petition in February 2001, the FDA noted that (1) “[t]he \npetition clearly outlines how . . . Plan B[] meet[s] all the criteria for OTC availability,” (2) the \nstatements in the petition “are supported by scientific data and the cited literature,” and (3) \n“DRUDP [Division of Reproductive and Urologic Drug Products] agrees with much of the \nscientific  information  presented  in  the  supporting  statements.”    Def.’s  Ex.  3  at  T-30004.   \nNevertheless, Dr. Andrea Leonard-Segal of the Division of the Over-the-Counter Drug Products \n(“DOTCDP”), who reviewed the Citizen Petition in April 2001, identified a number of safety \nconcerns which needed evaluation through an actual use study.  Id. at Tummino (“T”) 30023.  \nAmong these concerns were whether consumers would use emergency contraception instead of \nmore  effective  forms  of  birth  control,  whether  adolescent  girls  could  comprehend  and  use \nemergency  contraception,  and  whether  the  availability  of  emergency  contraception  would \ndissuade consumers from being tested for sexually transmitted diseases.  Dr. Segal noted that the \nsponsor of Plan B “expressed a willingness to work with the Agency to address the[] concerns” \nraised by the petition.  Id.   \n  8\n\n \n  On September 6, 2001, the FDA advised the petitioners that it had not yet resolved the \nissues raised in the Citizen Petition, but that it would respond “as soon as we have reached a \ndecision on your request.”  Def.’s Ex. 1 at CP029.  The FDA did not respond for nearly five \nmore years, when it announced, on June 9, 2006, that it had denied the petition.  Id. at CP001-19.  \nDuring this period, however, the FDA communicated regularly with the Plan B sponsor about its \nanticipated SNDA.  Indeed, in February 2001, shortly before the Citizen Petition had been filed, \nFDA staff met with the Plan B sponsor to discuss a development plan for an over-the-counter \nswitch application, including the details for a proposed actual use study and label comprehension \nstudy.  Def.’s Ex. 3. at T-30005-17.  Specifically, the FDA made a number of recommendations \nregarding the age composition of participants in a proposed actual use study and the importance \nof enrolling young adolescents.  The sponsor indicated that it would seek to enroll at least 50 \nparticipants aged 17 years of age or younger.  Id. at T-30047.  The FDA did not disapprove of \nthis figure or recommend a larger number.  See id. at T-30254.  Indeed, in subsequent meetings \nprior to the filing of the SNDA, FDA staff assured the sponsor that the actual use study, the study \nthe FDA considered “pivotal” to the application, “appear[ed] to be adequate for filing.”  Id.   \nMoreover, as early as April 2002, the FDA informed the Plan B sponsor that results from trials in \nthe adult population could be extrapolated to the postmenarcheal pediatric population.  Pls.’ Ex. \nF-1 at T-30100.  The Director of the Office of New Drugs (“OND”), Dr. John K. Jenkins, noted \nthat “the Agency has a long history of extrapolating findings from clinical trials in older patients \nto adolescents.”  Pls.’ Ex. A-3 at T-30898. \nOn April 21, 2003, over two years after it had begun discussions with the FDA, the Plan \nB sponsor submitted an SNDA formally requesting that Plan B be switched from prescription-\nonly to OTC status without age or point-of-sale restriction.  On June 9, 2003, the FDA accepted \n  9\n\n \nthe SNDA for review and set a goal date of February 20, 2004 to render a decision on the \napplication.  Def.’s Ex. 3 at T-30284. \n2.    Review of First OTC Switch Application:  OTC Access Without Age Restriction \nAs discussed above, while the Plan B sponsor did not formally submit the SNDA until \nApril 2003, the FDA was aware of and anticipated the application well in advance.  Indeed, at an \nOffice of the Commissioner’s meeting in June 2002, FDA officials – including then Deputy \nCommissioner Dr. Lester Crawford – and review staff discussed the “political sensitivity” of a \npotential switch to OTC status for Plan B.   Pls.’ Ex. A-1 at T-30167.  These discussions \nregarding the political implications of the switch applications were not limited to intra-agency \nmeetings:  On the very same day that the Plan B sponsor first formally requested OTC status, \nthen-FDA  Commissioner  Dr.  Mark  McClellan  discussed  the  pending  application  with  Jay \nLefkowitz, the Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy at the White House.  Id. at \nT-509.  Commissioner McClellan testified that he had provided several updates on the Plan B \napplication to relevant policy staff at the White House.  Pls.’ Ex. D-2 at McClellan Dep. 140:19-\n141:13.   \nMoreover,  deposition  testimony  of  several  FDA  senior  staff  members  reveals  that \npolitical and ideological factors played a determinative role in the nomination and selection \nprocess for membership on the Advisory Committee for Reproductive Health Drugs, which, \nalong  with  the  Advisory  Committee  for  Nonprescription  Drugs  (together  the  “Advisory \nCommittee”), was empanelled by the FDA to make recommendations as to how the FDA should \nrespond to the OTC switch applications.  See 68 Fed. Reg. 66113 (Nov. 25, 2003).   \nThe common procedure for selecting members of such committees was for the offices \nand divisions within CDER to “put together a panel of nominees and send those up [to the Office \n  10\n\n \nof the Commissioner] for clearance.  [However, i]n this case names were sent down.”  Pls.’ Ex. \nD-1 at Houn Dep. 30:16-18; Pls.’ Ex. D-2 at Kweder Dep. 37:16-20.  According to Dr. Jenkins, \n“[i]t wasn’t as if names were being floated for internal vetting.  These names were being sent \ndown as these are new people who will be on the Committee.”  Pls.’ Ex. D-2 at Jenkins Dep. \n258:12-15.  The Deputy Director of the Office of New Drugs (OND), Dr. Sandra Kweder, who \nhad been involved in the formation of many advisory committees, id. at Kweder Dep. 37:12-15, \ntestified that the Office of the Commissioner appointed several individuals to the committee \n“who would [not] normally [be] considered as the kind of people we would be looking for to be \non the panel.”  Id. at 35:3-5.  These people had “very limited experience in product development, \nclinical trials.  They were not well-published.”  Id. at 35:8-10; Pls.’ Ex. D-1 at Houn Dep. 31:13-\n15, 39:13-40:4.  Dr. Florence Houn, Director of the ODE III, testified that the individuals \nappointed by the Office of the Commissioner did not have “[e]xpertise recognized on a regional \nor national level or specialty field that would help our deliberations.”  Pls.’ Ex. D-1 at Houn Dep. \n39:1-3.   \nThe Office of the Commissioner appointed members to the Advisory Committee not for \ntheir expertise, but to achieve what the Office of the Commissioner called a “balance of opinion” \non the panel.  Pls.’ Ex. D-2 at Kweder Dep. 30:2-22.  Indeed, Dr. Kweder testified that the \nCommissioner’s  office  rejected  many  qualified  nominees  proposed  by  CDER  in  favor  of \nindividuals  who  shared  a  common  ideological  viewpoint.    Id.  at  30:4-21,  28:16-29:3.  \nSpecifically,  “the  backgrounds  of  many  of  the  candidates  that  were  forwarded  [by  the \nCommissioner’s office] . . . had an ideological commonality. . . . They were . . . people who were \nvery active in the Right to Life antiabortion world.”  Id. at 37:4-6, 8-10.  According to Dr. \nKweder, the CDER is “not . . . looking for people who have an opinion coming in [to their \n  11\n\n \nparticipation on the committee].  That’s exactly what we don’t want.  We want people who can \nlook at what’s before them and render an assessment and recommendation on the basis of that.”  \nId. at 30:13-18. \nIn preparation for the Advisory Committee meeting, which would consider whether to \nrecommend approval of the Plan B sponsor’s switch applications, review staff met with and \ninformed  Commissioner  McClellan  that  “[t]he  results  of  the  AUS  [actual  use  study] \ndemonstrated  that  the  frequency  of  unprotected  sex  did  not  increase,  condom  use  did  not \ndecrease, and the overall use of effective contraception did not decrease [with use of Plan B].”  \nDef.’s Ex. 3 at T-30394.  Staff noted that while only 5 percent of subjects recruited for the actual \nuse study were in the 16 and younger age group, the Plan B sponsor supplemented the actual use \nstudy data with reports and behavioral studies from the medical literature.  Id.  These studies \nenrolled more than 1,000 subjects ages 16 and younger, Pls.’ Ex. A-3 at T-30868; Pls.’ A-2 at T-\n30809, and lent further support to a finding that young adolescents can use Plan B safely in an \nOTC setting. \nOn  December  16,  2003,  the  Advisory  Committee  voted  23  to  4  in  favor  of  the \nrecommendation to approve Plan B for over-the-counter status without age or point-of-sale \nrestrictions.  Def.’s Ex. 2 at T-10792; it voted unanimously that Plan B is safe for use in a non-\nprescription setting, and voted 27 to 1 that the actual use study data submitted by the Plan B \nsponsor could be generalized to the overall population of potential non-prescription users of Plan \nB, i.e., data from older age groups could be extrapolated to younger ones.  Id. at T-10754.  Only \na few panel members raised questions concerning the quality of the supporting data regarding \nyoung adolescent use and possible substitution of Plan B for other forms of contraception.  See \nid. at T-10753-56, 10763-67, 10776-78, 10789, 10792.  And, significantly, at least two of those \n  12\n\n \nraising such concerns appear to have been appointed by the Commissioner’s office to achieve \nideological balance on the panel.  See Pls.’ Ex. D-1 at Houn Dep. 33:19-35:20.    \nWhile the Advisory Committee does not have the final say regarding the OTC switch \napplications, the FDA has followed advisory committee recommendations in every OTC switch \napplication  in  the  last  decade:    Of  the  23  OTC  switch  applications  reviewed  by  advisory \ncommittees from 1994 to 2004, the Plan B over-the-counter switch application was the only one \nthat was not approved after the joint committee voted to recommend its approval.  See Pls.’ Ex. \nB, GAO Report at 1-4, 34-35.  A meeting in late December 2003 or early January 2004 sheds \nlight on the reasons for this departure from the FDA’s decision-making process.   \nDuring  that  meeting,  Dr.  Woodcock,  Acting  Deputy  Commissioner,  and  Dr.  Steven \nGalson, Acting Director for the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), told their \nsubordinates, Drs. Jenkins and Kweder, “that Plan B could not be approved on this round,” Pls.’ \nEx. D-2 at Kweder Dep. 45:6-7, and that the decision was to be made at the level of CDER \nDirector or at the Commissioner’s level.  Pls.’ Ex. D-1 at Jenkins Dep. 17:9-11, 18:16-17.  This \nwas a departure from usual FDA procedures because under the its “normal schema” a switch to \nOTC of a first in class drug, such as Plan B, would be handled at the Office Director level and \nwould not require approval or sign off by the Commissioner’s office.  Id. at 16:9-21.  Moreover, \nthey were told that the White House had been involved in the decision on Plan B.  Dr. Kweder \ntestified that Dr. Woodcock had told her at that meeting that: \nDr. McClellan had [not] made [the decision] on his own but . . . the White House \nwas involved . . . we were told, and that it was made very clear that there were a \nlot of constituents who would be very unhappy with . . . an over-the-counter Plan \nB, and . . . [there] was part of the public that needed to have the message that we \nwere taking adolescents and reproductive issues seriously. \n \nPls.’  Ex.  D-2  at  Kweder  Dep.  56:18-57:4;  Pls.’  Reply  Ex.  4  at  Kweder  Dep.  72:20-73:4.  \n  13\n\n \nMoreover, the pressure coming from the White House appears to have been transmitted down by \nthe Commissioner’s office in such a way as to significantly affect Dr. Galson’s position on the \nover-the-counter  switch  application.    While  Dr.  Galson  would  ultimately  concur  with \nCommissioner  McClellan’s  decision  and  sign  the  Not-Approvable  letter  in  May  2004,  Dr. \nJenkins testified  \nthat during the time that we were reviewing the Application before we went to the \nAdvisory Committee, I never had any indication from either Dr. Woodcock or Dr. \nGalson that they felt that the product should not be available over the counter \nwithout age restriction, so nothing in their communications with me ever led me \nto think that they were thinking that this should not be approved or should not be \navailable. \n \nPls.’ Reply Ex. 4 at Jenkins Dep. 231:18-232:4.  Dr. Jenkins further testified that “[o]ver the \ncourse of the time after [this] lunch meeting” and subsequent meetings with review staff and the \nCommissioner “there were occasions where . . . Dr. Galson . . . told me that he felt that he didn’t \nhave a choice, and  . . . that he wasn’t sure that he would be allowed to remain as Center Director \nif he didn’t agree with the [Not-Approvable] Action.”  Id. at 232:5-17; see also Pls.’ Ex. D-1 at \nJenkins Dep. 51:2-8.  Dr. Jenkins’ testimony is corroborated by the deposition testimony of Dr. \nSusan Wood, then-Assistant Commissioner for Women’s Health and Director of the FDA Office \nof Women’s Health.  Dr. Wood testified that Dr. Galson conveyed that “he felt that he would not \nbe able to work with the leadership of the Agency in an effective manner if [the Not-Approvable] \nletter . . . did not go through.”  Pls.’ Reply Ex. 4 at Wood Dep. 24:13-16. \n  Nevertheless, FDA review staff continued their “first review cycle” for the OTC switch \napplication submitted by the Plan B sponsor.  On January 9, 2004, Dr. Curtis Rosebraugh, \nDeputy  Director  of  the  Division  of  OTC  Drugs,  recommended  approval  of  the  application \nsubmitted by the Plan B sponsor, concluding that Plan B has a “low misuse and abuse potential” \nand is “safe and effective.”  Pls.’ Ex. F-1 at T-30454.  Moreover, he suggested that Plan B could \n  14\n\n \ndecrease unwanted teen pregnancy by up to 70 percent and reduce teen abortions.  Id. at T-\n30455.      \n  On January 15, 2004, less than a week after Rosebraugh circulated his memorandum, and \nbefore other FDA offices had completed their respective reviews, Dr. Galson met with and \ninformed members of the ODE III, ODE V and OND that the Commissioner’s office had decided \nthat the FDA would issue a Not-Approvable letter because of a lack of adequate data to support \nappropriate use of Plan B by adolescents under 16.  Def.’s Ex. 3 at T-30666-70; Pls.’ Ex. D-1 at \nHoun Dep. 21:7-12.  There is evidence that Commissioner McClellan made this decision before \nFDA staff had completed their scientific reviews of that data.  See Pls.’ Ex. B, GAO Report at \n21-22.  Indeed, Dr. Houn testified that it was “very unusual” that Dr. Galson had informed \nreview staff at the January 15, 2004 meeting that the data was insufficient because \nwe had not finished the evaluation process, and we were in the middle of getting \ndata on the question of adolescent use of emergency contraception.  So if we were \nto  continue  an  evidence-based  approach,  we  would  hope  to  have  all  of  the \nevidence in hand before an evaluation and decision was made.   \n \nPls.’ Ex. D-1 at Houn Dep. 22:3-9.  This testimony is corroborated by Dr. Jenkins’ deposition \ntestimony:  \n[F]or the Commissioner to convey through Dr. Galson a definitive opinion on the \nApplication and an Action before the reviews were completed and before it had \ngone up through the subsequent levels of the organization is something I’ve never \nencountered before. \n \nId. at Jenkins Dep. 33:12-17; see also id. at 29:7-19.  The timing of the Commissioner’s decision \nis particularly striking in light of  Dr. Galson acknowledgment, at the January 15 meeting, that \nadditional data, which Dr. Galson and the Commissioner were not familiar with, existed on the \nuse of Plan B in adolescent girls in that age group.  Def.’s Ex. 3 at T-30666-70.  Indeed, as part \nof its OTC switch application, the Plan B sponsor submitted eight behavioral studies on the use \n  15\n\n \nof emergency contraceptives.  See Pls.’ Ex. F-1 at T-30448-50.   \nDr. Woodcock called Dr. Houn a day or two after the January 15 meeting at which the \ndecision not to approve the Plan B sponsor’s OTC switch application was announced to find out \nthe “reaction [of] the team.  [Dr. Woodcock] conveyed to [Dr. Houn] . . . that this was the only \nway to go to issue a non-approval letter to appease the [present] administration’s constituents.”  \nPls.’ Ex. D-1 at Houn Dep. 59:16-20; id. at 59:21-60:6; Pls.’ Ex. D-2 at Kweder Dep. 55:14-\n56:7.  Nevertheless, a week after the January meeting, Dr. Jonca Bull, Director of ODE V, \ncirculated a memorandum which concurred with the favorable reviews submitted by a number of \nother FDA staff reviewers, supra.  Dr. Bull wrote \nThere is no basis on which to assume that young women of child bearing potential \nwould suddenly become promiscuous because of this product.  Indeed, the data \nsubmitted evidenced a decrease in sexual activity short term. . . . I am unable to \nidentify  evidence  in  the  medical  literature  to  support  the  assertion  that  the \navailability of contraception directly increases high risk sexual behavior. \n \nPls.’ Ex. F-1 at T-30649-50 (emphasis added).  Dr. Bull concluded that the Plan B sponsor \n“adequately demonstrated that women of reproductive potential across relevant age subgroups \ncan use the product appropriately.”  Id. at T-30651. \n  In mid-February, FDA staff attempted to address Commissioner McClellan’s expressed \nconcerns regarding the impact of non-prescription access to Plan B on young adolescents. They \npresented him with an analysis of additional data available on the OTC use of Plan B by \nadolescents.  Def.’s Ex. 3 at T-30720-21.  Staff concluded that “the benefits of timely access \noutweighed any risk for all women, including adolescents,” and supported OTC availability \nwithout any age restriction.  Id. at T-30720.  Commissioner McClellan, however, was “not \nconvinced the studies had enough power to determine if there were behavioral differences \nbetween adults and adolescents” and directed CDER to work with the drug’s sponsor on a \n  16\n\n \nmarketing plan to restrict Plan B access to appropriate age groups.  Id. at T-30721.   \n  Responding to these concerns, the Plan B sponsor indicated its willingness to modify its \noriginal proposal that would have made Plan B available over-the-counter without any age \nrestriction.  Instead, the Plan B sponsor submitted an informal proposal to market Plan B OTC to \nconsumers age 16 and over, while maintaining the product’s prescription status for consumers \nunder age 16.  Def.’s Ex. 4 at SNDA 001-004.  Under this proposal, both prescription and OTC \nPlan B would be marketed in the same package and would be distributed from behind pharmacy \ncounters with proof-of-age required.  Id.  Notwithstanding this revised proposal, FDA scientific \nreview staff uniformly and strongly supported approval of Plan B for OTC sales without age or \npoint-of-sale restrictions.  Numerous scientists submitted memoranda to this effect in March and \nApril 2004.  Significantly, the memoranda squarely addressed upper management concerns that \nthere was insufficient data on young adolescent use.  Reviewers analyzed the actual use data as \nwell as data from five other studies that were submitted with the initial SNDA.  Of the more than \n11,000 enrollees in those studies, just over 1,000 were under 16, nearly 2,000 were 17 or \nyounger, and at least 200 of the subjects in one study were aged 13 to 15.  Pls.’ Ex. A-3 at T-\n30868; Pls.’ Ex. A-2 at T-30809 & n.5. \n  In reviewing the available data, Dr. Daniel Davis, Division of Reproductive and Urologic \nDrug  Products  (DRUDP)  Medical  Officer,  squarely  addressed  “concern[s]  over  the  OTC \navailability  of  emergency  contraception  and  the  effect  that  this  might  have  on  adolescent \nbehavior (e.g., increasing sexual promiscuity).”  Pls.’ Ex. A-2 at T-30810.  Dr. Davis found that \nthe data did not support these concerns, rather it “suggest[ed] that ready access to OTC Plan B     \n.  .  .  would  have  little  impact  on  sexual  behavior  and  contraceptive  practices  in  younger \nadolescents.”  Id. at T-30812.  Dr. Rosebraugh concluded similarly:   \n  17\n\n \nThe data . . . is quite compelling to dispel any potential concerns regarding \nadolescent use or changes in sexual[] behaviors associated with plan B use. . . . In \nterms of OTC switch applications, this drug has more information available to \nallow  us  to  predict  consumer  behaviors  than  any  drug  the  Divisions  ha[ve] \napproved for switch in recent memory.  If this is not enough data upon which to \nbase a decision, it is unclear what would constitute enough data or even if that is \nan obtainable goal. \n \nId. at T-30757 (emphasis added). \nThe positive reviews from staff in favor of the OTC switch without age restriction \ncontinued:  In April 2004, Dr. Donna Griebel, Deputy Director of Division of Reproductive and \nUrologic Drug Products (DRUDP), concluded that the risk-benefit ratio of non-prescription \naccess to Plan B supported its approval for OTC status.  Pls.’ Ex. A-3 at T-30829-79.  She \nconcluded that there was no justification for “restrict[ing] access to the benefit of this product on \nthe basis of age.”  Id. at T-30877.  Dr. Julie Beitz, Deputy Director of ODE III, also found \nsufficient data on the safe and effective use of Plan B to approve use at all age levels.  Id. at T-\n30881-90.  With respect to the younger adolescent group, Dr. Beitz noted not only that “[o]ver a \nthousand adolescents aged ≤ 16 years have been evaluated” but that the “[f]indings regarding the \nuse of EC [emergency contraception], frequency of unprotected sex, and frequency of pregnancy \nand STDs are remarkably consistent across studies, clinical settings, and age strata.”  Id. at T-\n30888.    \nLater in April 2004, Dr. Jenkins, Director of the Office of new Drugs, issued his review \nconcurring  with  the  recommendations  of  ODE  III  and  ODE  V.    Id.  at  T-30897-99.      He \nconcluded  \nthat increased access for adolescents to emergency contraception did not result in \ninappropriate use of Plan B as a routine form of contraception, an increase in the \nnumber  of  sexual  partners,  an  increase  in  the  frequency  of  unprotected \nintercourse, or an increase in the frequency of sexually transmitted diseases. \n \nId. at T-30898 (emphasis added).  Responding directly to concerns that the label comprehension \n  18\n\n \nand actual use studies enrolled too few young adolescents, Dr. Jenkins noted: \nWhile it is true that the number of adolescents enrolled in the sponsor’s studies \nwas  relatively  small,  these  studies  did  not  exclude  adolescent  women  from \nenrollment and were conducted in settings that would be expected to capture a \nrepresentative population of women who currently seek emergency contraception.  \nTherefore, it is likely that the percentage of patients enrolled in these studies is an \naccurate reflection of the potential users of Plan B in an OTC setting. \n \nId. at T-30897-98 (emphasis added); see also Pls.’ Ex. A-1 at T-10949 (Acting Director of the \nDivision of Pediatric Drug Development concurring that number of adolescents enrolled in study \nreflected their actual use of Plan B and waiving pediatric study because of the minimal number \nof individuals of that age using Plan B).   \n  Moreover, Dr. Jenkins concluded that the data “do[es] not suggest that adolescent women \nare  significantly  different  from  older  women  in  their  comprehension  of  the  labeling  or \nappropriate use of the product in the OTC setting.”  Pls.’ Ex. A-3 at T-30898.  He found no \n“compelling scientific reason” to “distinguish[] the safety and efficacy of Plan B . . . among \ndifferent ages of women of childbearing potential.”  Id.  To the contrary, Dr. Jenkins wrote, “the \nAgency has a long history of extrapolating findings from clinical trials in older patients to \nadolescents in both prescription and non-prescription approvals and this practice was recently \nincorporated  into  the  Pediatric  Research  and  Equity  Act  (PREA).”    Id.;  see  21  U.S.C.  § \n355c(a)(2)(B)(ii) (“A study may not be needed in each pediatric age group if data from one age \ngroup can be extrapolated to another age group.”). \n  Nevertheless, on May 6, 2004, Dr. Galson, Acting Director of the Center for Drug \nEvaluation and Research, sent the Plan B sponsor a Not-Approvable letter on the initial SNDA.  \nPls.’ Ex. A-3 at T-30904.  Dr. Galson told the sponsor that before the OTC switch could be \napproved it needed to provide more information on safe use by women under 16, or more \ninformation in support of a dual marketing plan that would sell Plan B as a prescription-only \n  19\n\n \nproduct to women under 16.  Id. at T-30904. Central to this decision, was Dr. Galson’s refusal to \nextrapolate the findings from the actual use study in the 17 and older age group (with 518 \nenrollees) to the 16 and younger age group (with 22 enrollees).  Id. at T-30913; see also id. at T-\n30868.  Dr. Galson reasoned that it is “very difficult to extrapolate data on behavior from older \nages to younger ages” because of the diminished capacity of adolescents to make rational \ndecisions and the “large developmental differences” between early- and mid-adolescence.  Id. at \nT-30901.  This conclusion was a departure from the FDA’s “long history” of extrapolating data \nfor other contraceptives, including prescription oral contraceptives.  See T-1212-14; Pls.’ Ex. B, \nGAO Report at 5.         \nDr.  Galson  also  rejected  the  view  held  by  review  staff  (discussed  above)  that  the \nbehavioral studies the Plan B sponsor had submitted “approximate actual OTC use sufficiently to \nsupport approval.”  Pls.’ Ex. A-3 at T-30902.   Because some of the studies provided “product \neducation assistance beyond what adolescents would receive in an OTC situation,” their results \ncould not properly be analogized to OTC use.  Id.  This conclusion, however, was contradicted \nby the review staff’s detailed analysis of the educational component of two of these studies: the \nfirst enrolled 2,090 women, 254 of whom were 16 and younger; the second enrolled 7,756 \nwomen, where 613 were 16 and younger, and 202 were 13 to 15 years of age.  Pls.’ Ex. A-2 at T-\n30809; Pls.’ Ex. A-3 at T-30861-62.    Review staff found that “the information provided at study \nentry” in these two studies was nothing more than “a summary of the label points from the Plan \nB patient package insert,” information which would be available to all OTC users of Plan B.  \nPls.’ Ex. A-3 at T-30862; see also Pls.’ Ex. F-2 at Rosebraugh Dep. 191:11-192:13.  Moreover, \ncontrary to Dr. Galson’s concern that the studies had limited relevance because they were “not \nconducted in the general population,” Pls.’ Ex. A-3 at T-30902, review staff found that “several \n  20\n\n \nof the studies would have recruited a similar population as that used in the actual use study.  Also \nsubjects received advanced provisions to have at home for use as necessary which may simulate \nhow consumers would use the products in an OTC environment.”  Pls.’ Ex. F-1 at T-30449.   \n  3.   Review of Second OTC Switch Application: OTC Access for 16 and Older   \n  After it received the May 6, 2004 Not-Approvable letter, the Plan B sponsor submitted an \namended SNDA in July 2004, formally proposing a dual marketing plan for Plan B that would \nallow non-prescription sales to persons age 16 and over who presented a valid identification to a \npharmacist, and prescription-only sales to women 15 years and younger.  The amended SNDA \nproposed that Plan B be kept behind-the-counter (“BTC”) at pharmacies so as to enforce the age \nrestriction on non-prescription use.  This marketing approach is referred to as the behind-the-\ncounter or “BTC regime.”  Nevertheless, a number of FDA scientists concluded that an age \nrestriction limiting OTC use of Plan B was not appropriate.  Dr. Davis concluded that Plan B was \nsafe for OTC use by all ages and that prescription-only status for women under 16 was not \n“warranted or desirable.”  Pls.’ Ex. A-3 at T-31020.  Similarly, Dr. Rosebraugh stated that “[a]ny \nsystem placing barriers to access would defeat the purpose of the drug and lessen its public \nhealth potential.”  Id. at T-31026.  Dr. Griebel expressed concern that the BTC regime would set \na dangerous precedent that might have negative consequences for other non-prescription drugs, \nsuch as condoms and spermicides.  Pls.’ Ex. A-4 at T-31031.  And Dr. Beitz questioned why \nPlan B had been singled out for BTC status when misuse of some other OTC products carries \nmore safety risks than misuse of Plan B.  Id. at T-31085-87.   \nDr. Jenkins, Director of the Office of New Drugs, reiterated his view that the FDA \nprecedent supported extrapolating data from older to younger adolescent age groups, concluding \nthat there is no unique safety concern for the drug in women under age 16.  Id. at T-31096.  He \n  21\n\n \nresponded to upper management’s concerns regarding the “developmental differences between \nadolescents and older women,” characterizing them as beyond the scope of the FDA’s authority \nbecause such concerns are “more applicable to the ability of adolescents to make reasoned \ndecisions about engaging in sexual intercourse, not their ability to understand how to use Plan B \nsafely and effectively as an emergency contraceptive should they engage in unprotected sexual \nintercourse.”  Id. at T-31097.  While recognizing that “OTC access to Plan B for adolescents \nmay be controversial from a societal perspective,” Dr. Jenkins could not “think of any age group \nwhere the benefit of preventing unplanned pregnancies and abortion is more important and more \ncompelling.”  Id. at T-31098. \nIn January 2005, notwithstanding review staff’s continued view that OTC access should \nbe  approved  without  age  restriction,  Dr.  Galson,  Acting  Director  of  the  Center  for  Drug \nEvaluation and Research, asked Dr. Jenkins to draft an approvable letter for the Plan B OTC \nswitch application approving OTC status for women age 17 and over.  Pls.’ Ex. D-2 at Jenkins \nDep. 145:18-147:15.  Dr. Galson had concluded and informed Acting Commissioner Crawford \nthat he was “comfortable with the science” and that OTC use of Plan B “should be approved \nover the counter for 17 and up.” Pls.’ Ex. D-1 at Crawford Dep. 140:14-15, 140:22.  Acting \nCommissioner  Crawford  testified  at  his  deposition  that  he  concurred  with  Dr.  Galson’s \nrecommendation.    Id.  at  Crawford  Dep.  46:13-14,  49:12-20.    Nevertheless,  in  January  or \nFebruary 2005, before Dr. Galson could issue the letter he had instructed Dr. Jenkins to draft, \nActing Commissioner Crawford removed Dr. Galson’s authority to make a decision on the OTC \nswitch application.  This was the only time Dr. Galson had had his authority to make such a \ndecision removed and the only time he is aware of it happening to any Center of Drug Evaluation \nand Research Director.    Id. at Galson Dep. 186:20-187:13.     \n  22\n\n \nActing Commissioner Crawford’s decision to remove Dr. Galson’s authority effectively \nfroze the review process for more than seven months – no further scientific reviews were \nconducted  between  January  2005  (the  date  of  Dr.  Jenkins’  memorandum)  and  Acting \nCommissioner Crawford’s first communication with the Plan B sponsor in August of 2005.  As a \nresult, the FDA failed, as required by law, to respond to the SNDA filed by the Plan B sponsor \nwithin 180 days of its filing.   See 21 U.S.C. §355(c); 21 C.F.R. § 314.100(a).  Moreover, during \nthis seven month period – during which time no FDA staff appear to have worked on the Plan B \nmatter – neither Acting Deputy Commissioner Woodcock nor Acting CDER Director Galson \nknew what Acting Commissioner Crawford was doing on the Plan B SNDA.  Pls.’ Ex. D-2 at \nWoodcock Dep. 68:16-22; Pls.’ Ex. D-1 at Galson Dep. 202:4-9.  Despite repeated inquiries \nfrom members of the Senate, Acting Commissioner Crawford failed to provide an answer as to \nwhen a decision on the Plan B switch application could be expected.   This continued inaction \nmoved  Senators  Patty  Murray  and  Hillary  Clinton  to  place  a  hold  on  his  confirmation  as \nCommissioner.  To remove the hold, Michael Leavitt, the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, sent a letter on July 13, 2005 to Senator Michael Enzi, Chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, assuring him that action would be taken \non the Plan B application by September 1, 2005.  See Def.’s Ltr., dated July 25, 2005.  On July \n18, 2005, Crawford was confirmed by the Senate as FDA Commissioner.   \nNotwithstanding  assurances  that  the  FDA  would  act  by  September  1,  2005, \nCommissioner Crawford announced in late August 2005 that he would put off the decision yet \nagain.  In a letter dated August 26, 2005, Commissioner Crawford stated that, although the \n“scientific data [is] sufficient to support the safe use of Plan B as an OTC product . . . for women \nwho are 17 years of age and older,” the FDA is unable to reach a decision on the approvability of \n  23\n\n \nthe application – even as to women 17 and older – because of “unresolved issues” related to the \nFDA’s authority to approve the BTC regime of Plan B and the logistics of enforcing the age \nbased and point-of-sale restrictions.  Def.’s Ex. 2 at T-10813-14.  That same day, the FDA \nannounced its intention to issue an advance notice of a 60-day public comment period on \nwhether rulemaking procedures were necessary to resolve and clarify these unresolved issues.  \nThis decision presented a new obstacle to the Senate deadline of September 1, 2005 for a \ndecision on Plan B, which had been a condition of the Senate’s confirmation of Commissioner \nCrawford.     \nIn  August  2005,  days  after  Commissioner  Crawford’s  decision  to  further  delay  the \ndecision-making on Plan B, Dr. Wood, Assistant Commissioner and Director of the FDA Office \nof Women’s Health, resigned over the FDA’s handling of the Plan B OTC switch application.  \nPls.’ Ex. E at E006; Pls.’ Ex. D-2 at Wood Dep. 13:17-14:17.  In her resignation letter to \nCommissioner Crawford, Dr. Wood wrote: \nSadly,  your  recent  decision  to  not  approve  Plan  B  emergency  contraception, \noverturning the clear scientific and clinical evidence, contradicts both the FDA \nmission and my commitment to women’s health.  The rationale offered is not \nconvincing, and is in fact a denial of access to a product clearly established as safe \nand effective for all women who need it. \n \nPls.’ Ex. E at E006.  When Dr. Wood met with Dr. Woodcock to discuss her resignation, Dr. \nWoodcock  expressed  concern  that  the  FDA’s  handling  of  Plan  B  could  damage  her  own \ncredibility.  Pls.’ Ex. D-2 at Wood Dep. 40:2-19.  On October 7, 2005, Dr. Frank Davidoff, a \nmember of the FDA’s Nonprescription Drug Advisory Committee, also resigned because of the \nFDA’s delayed action on the Plan B switch application.  Pls.’ Ex. A-1 at T-7509-10; Pls.’ Ex. D-\n2 at Jenkins Dep. 258:20-260:11. \n  The  60-day  period  for  public  comment  on  whether  rulemaking  procedures  were \n  24\n\n \nnecessary  closed  on  November  1,  2005.    The  FDA  received  approximately  47,000  public \ncomments and hired an outside company to review and summarize those comments.  Def.’s Ex. 2 \nat T-11094.  That review was completed six months later on May 19, 2006.  Id.  After reviewing \nthese materials, the FDA finally concluded – more than eleven months after halting its review of \nthe OTC switch application to seek public comment – that it was not necessary after all to \nengage in agency rulemaking before deciding the Plan B sponsor’s OTC switch application.  Id.  \nInstead, on July 31, 2006, the FDA announced that “[n]on-prescription sales of [Plan B] could be \napproved for women 18 and older within weeks,” Stephanie Saul, F.D.A. Shifts View on Next-\nDay Pill, N.Y. Times, Aug. 1, 2006, at A1, although it requested more information regarding the \nPlan B sponsor’s plan to enforce the age and point-of-sale restrictions, which required that Plan \nB be kept behind the pharmacy counter.  Def.’s Ex. 2 at T-11095.  By this point in time, \nCommissioner  Crawford  had  resigned  and  Dr.  von  Eschenbach  had  been  made  Acting \nCommissioner and nominated to replace him.  This change in policy was announced a day before \nDr. von Eschenbach’s confirmation hearing. \n  In response to the FDA’s request, the Plan B sponsor submitted yet another switch \napplication in August 2006, this time asking the FDA to approve OTC use by women 18 and \nover instead of 16 and over.  At the FDA’s insistence, the sponsor agreed to take primary \nresponsibility for enforcing compliance with the age restriction, to distribute the product only to \nlicensed pharmacists, and to direct pharmacies to keep Plan B behind-the-counter.  Id. at T-\n10921.  Moreover, the Plan B sponsor agreed to collect data and conduct post-market research to \ndetermine the effectiveness of the Plan B dual marketing regime.  Id. at T-10871-74, T-10915-\n25.   \n  The Plan B sponsor’s revised switch application conformed to the FDA’s expressed \n  25\n\n \nwillingness to entertain an application to make Plan B available without a prescription to women \nover the age of 18.  Notwithstanding the conclusion of his immediate predecessor, Dr. Crawford, \nthat the “scientific data [is] sufficient to support the safe use of Plan B as an OTC product . . . for \nwomen who are 17 years of age and older,” id. at T-10813-14, Commissioner von Eschenbach \nhad decided that 18, rather than age 17, is the “more appropriate cutoff point” for OTC use of \nPlan  B  because  of  “well-established  state  and  private-sector  infrastructures  [which]  restrict \ncertain products to consumers 18 and older.”  Id. at T-10866-67.  He concluded “that to best \nprotect and promote the public health,” perceived regulatory efficiencies should outweigh the \nsubstantial health benefit 17 year old women would gain through OTC access to a drug product \nthat – experts agreed – they could use safely and effectively.  Id. at T-10867.  The following day, \nDr. Galson issued a memorandum stating that “although [he had] previously concluded that OTC \nuse would be restricted to women 17 or older, I have now determined that for the reasons Dr. von \nEschenbach outlines,” OTC use of Plan B should be restricted to women age 18 and over.  Id. at \nT-10870.  Finally, on August 24, 2006, the FDA approved non-prescription use of Plan B for \nconsumers 18 and older.  Id. at T-at 10880-10925.        \n  4.   Denial of Citizen Petition         \n  In June 2006, less than two months before the FDA announced that it would approve \nnon-prescription use of Plan B only for women over the age of 18, the FDA issued a final agency \ndecision denying the Citizen Petition – which had requested non-prescription access to Plan B \nfor  women  of  all  ages  –  finding  that  petitioners  had  failed  to  provide  sufficient  data  or \ninformation to meet the statutory and regulatory requirements for an OTC switch for any age \ngroup, much less the under 16 age group.  Def.’s Ex. 1 at CP001-19.  The parties dispute what \nled the FDA to issue the denial of the Citizen Petition when it did.  Plaintiffs claim the FDA’s \n  26\n\n \naction was a litigation tactic:  that the FDA used the denial as a means of bringing discovery to a \nhalt, particularly plaintiffs’ discovery requests seeking documents describing the White House’s \nrole  in  the  FDA’s  handling  of  the  Plan  B  switch  applications.    The  FDA  asserted  that  it \nresponded when it did, in part, because of the public interest in the petition and plaintiffs’ \namendment of their complaint to allege that the FDA had unreasonably delayed responding to \nthe petition.  Id. at CP003 & n.2. \nNevertheless, the record is clear that the FDA took more than five years to respond to the \npetition after it provided its tentative response in September 2001.  Moreover, even though the \nMay 6, 2004 Not-Approvable Action letter on the Plan B sponsor’s SNDA effectively rejected \nthe full relief sought by the Citizen Petition – unrestricted OTC access to Plan B – the FDA \nwaited  more  than  two  years  from  that  date  to  formally  deny  the  petition.    Perhaps  more \nsignificantly, the FDA acknowledged that the issues presented by the SNDAs and the Citizen \nPetition were one and the same.  Indeed, in the denial letter the FDA informed petitioner that  \n“we  had  intended  to  defer  our  response  to  your  petition  until  we  could  issue  a  response \ncontemporaneously with our issuance of a final decision on [the Plan B sponsor]’s SNDA,” id. at \nCP017, because “we expected that some or all of the issues you raised in your petition would be \nresolved in the . . . anticipated SNDA proceeding.”  Id. at CP013. \nC.   GAO Investigation \n  At the request of members of Congress, including 19 Senators and 29 Representatives, \nthe Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) initiated an investigation into the process which \nled to the issuance of the May 6, 2004, Not-Approvable letter, denying the initial supplemental \nnew  drug  application  filed  by  the  Plan  B  sponsor.    See  Pls.’  Ex.  B,  GAO  Report.    The \nCongressional request emanated from concern that “the not-approvable decision for the initial \n  27\n\n \nPlan B OTC switch application was contrary to the recommendations of the joint advisory \ncommittee and the FDA review staff.”  Id. at 3.  For this reason, the GAO Report examined, \n(1)  how  the  decision  was  made  to  not  approve  the  switch  of  Plan  B  from \nprescription to OTC, (2) how the Plan B decision compares to the [67] decisions \nfor other proposed prescription-to-OTC switches from 1994 through 2004, and (3) \nwhether there are age-related marketing restrictions for prescription Plan B and \nother prescription and OTC contraceptives. \n \nId. at 3-4.  The investigation was limited in scope to the FDA’s actions leading up to the May 6, \n2004 Not-Approvable letter for the initial SNDA, id. at 4, and did not take into consideration the \nCitizen Petition or later SNDAs.  Nevertheless, the findings of a congressional agency provide \nrelevant background to this litigation and confirm conclusions that are compelled by the record \nhere.   \n  In  reviewing  the  FDA’s  decision  regarding  the  OTC  switch  application,  the  GAO \nconcluded that four aspects of the FDA’s review process were “unusual” and departed from the \ntypical FDA review procedures.   Id. at 5.  First, it noted that “the Directors of the Offices of \nDrug Evaluation III and V, who would normally have been responsible for signing the Plan B \naction letter, disagreed with the decision and did not sign the not-approvable letter for Plan B.”  \nId.  For the same reasons, the Director of the Office of New Drugs, Dr. Jenkins, also did not sign \nthe letter.  Id.  Second, the GAO found that the FDA’s senior leadership was more heavily \ninvolved  in  Plan  B  than  it  was  in  other  OTC  switch  applications.    Specifically,  GAO \ninvestigators wrote that “FDA review staff told us that they were told early in the review process \nthat the decision would be made by high-level management.”  Id.  Third, the GAO noted that \n“there are conflicting accounts of whether the decision to not approve the application was made \nbefore the reviews were completed.”  Id.  The Director and Deputy Director of OND and \nDirectors of ODE III and V told GAO “that they were told by high-level management that the \n  28\n\n \nPlan B OTC switch application would be denied months before staff had completed their reviews \nof the application.”  Id. at 21.  Dr. Galson, however, told GAO that while he was “‘90 percent \nsure’ as early as January 2004, that the decision would be not-approvable,” he did not make his \nfinal decision until shortly before the action letter was sent out in May 2004.  Id. at 22.  Finally, \nthe GAO concluded that “the rationale for [Dr. Galson’s] decision was novel and did not follow \nFDA’s traditional practices.”  Id. at 5.  Specifically, it noted that he was “concerned about the \npotential impact that the OTC marketing of Plan B would have on the propensity for younger \nadolescents to engage in unsafe sexual behaviors because of their lack of cognitive maturity \ncompared  to  older  adolescents”  even  though  “the  agency  has  not  considered  behavioral \nimplications due to differences in cognitive development in prior OTC switch decisions.”  Id.  In \naddition,  Dr.  Galson  “stated  that  it  was  invalid  to  extrapolate  data  from  older  to  younger \nadolescents in this case” even though “the agency has considered it scientifically appropriate” to \ndo so.  Id. \n  With respect to how the Plan B decision compared to that for other proposed OTC \nswitches, the GAO found that “the Plan B OTC switch application was the only 1 of th[e] 23 \n[switch applications reviewed by the joint advisory committee from 1994 to 2004] that was not \napproved after the joint committee voted to recommend approval of the application.”  Id.  The \nGAO also pointed out that “the Plan B action letter was the only one signed by the Director of \nCDER . . . instead of the directors of the offices or divisions that reviewed the application, who \nwould normally sign an action letter.”  Id. \n  In  its  final  area  of  examination,  the  GAO  concluded  that  “there  are  no  age-related \nmarketing restrictions for safety reasons for any of the prescription or OTC contraceptives that \nFDA has approved, and FDA has not required pediatric studies for them.”  Id. at 6.  In particular, \n  29\n\n \nit  noted,  “[a]ll  FDA-approved  OTC  contraceptives  are  available  to  anyone,  and  all  FDA-\napproved prescription contraceptives are available to anyone with a prescription.”  Id. at 6.  \nFinally, the GAO noted that the “FDA did not identify any issues that would require age-related \nrestrictions in its review of the original application for prescription Plan B, and prescription Plan \nB is available to women of any age.”  Id. \nD.   Litigation History \n  1.  The Complaints \n  Plaintiffs  brought  this  action  in  January  2005  against  Lester  M.  Crawford,  then \nCommissioner of the FDA, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), and the \nConstitution.  Plaintiffs challenge the FDA’s denial of the Citizen Petition seeking to make \nPlan B available on an over-the-counter basis without age or point-of-sale restriction.   \n  In their most recent amended complaint, plaintiffs allege that the denial of the over-the-\ncounter switch for women of all ages and the imposition of the BTC regime (1) is arbitrary, \ncapricious, and otherwise contrary to law, Compl. ¶ 163; (2) exceeds the FDA’s statutory \nauthority, id. ¶ 165; (3) violates women’s rights to privacy, id. ¶ 167; (4) discriminates against \nwomen and those persons wishing to exercise their right to privacy in violation of the Fifth \nAmendment’s  Equal  Protection  Clause,  id.  ¶¶  169-70;  and  (5)  violates  women’s  rights  to \ninformational privacy. Id. ¶ 172.  Plaintiffs seek an injunction requiring the FDA to approve the \nOTC switch without age or point-of-sale restrictions and a declaratory judgment that the FDA’s \nactions violate the APA and the Constitution.  Id. ¶ 1.   \n  Underlying all of these claims is plaintiffs’ allegation that the FDA’s decisions were \nmade in bad faith because they were improperly influenced by political considerations wholly \noutside the scope of the FDA’s statutory authority.  Specifically, plaintiffs allege that, in refusing \n  30\n\n \nto approve over-the-counter access without age or point-of-sale restriction, the FDA bowed to \npolitical  pressure  from  the  White  House  and  anti-abortion  constituents  despite  the  uniform \nrecommendation of the FDA’s scientific review staff to approve over-the-counter access to Plan \nB without limitation. \n  2.   Dispositive Motions \n  Plaintiffs have moved for summary judgment on all of their claims pursuant to Rule 56 of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The FDA has cross-moved to dismiss for lack of subject \nmatter  jurisdiction  pursuant  to  Rule  12(b)(1)  or,  in  the  alternative,  for  summary  judgment \npursuant to Rule 56.  The FDA had argued earlier in this litigation (though not in the present \nmotions) that jurisdiction lies exclusively in the Court of Appeals.  Before discussing the issues \nraised by the present dispositive motions I briefly address this issue here.   \n  The  FDCA  contains  no  overarching  section  on  judicial  review,  but  makes  specific \nallocations of jurisdiction over specific types of cases to the Court of Appeals.  Thus, while the \nFDCA grants jurisdiction to the Court of Appeals over a sponsor’s challenge to the denial of a \nnew drug application, see 21 U.S.C. § 355(h), it contains no provision applicable to a petitioner’s \nchallenge of the denial of its citizen petition.  The D.C. Circuit has held that “[a]gency action \ntaken under sections silent in this respect are directly reviewable in a district court under some \nappropriate head of its jurisdiction, for courts of appeals have only such jurisdiction as Congress \nhas chosen to confer upon them.”  Cutler v. Hayes, 818 F.2d 879, 887 n.61 (D.C. Cir. 1987).    \nMoreover, FDA regulations make clear that petitions for judicial review of a citizen petition may \nbe filed in district court.  See 21 C.F.R. § 10.45(g). \n \n  31\n\n \nII.   Discussion \nA.   Standing      \n  Article III of the Constitution limits the role of the judiciary to the resolution of “cases” \nand “controversies.”  Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Americans United for Separation of Church \nand State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 471 (1982).  The question of standing is “whether the plaintiff is \nthe proper party to bring [the] suit.”  Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 818 (1997).  Moreover, the \nconclusion that an individual has standing to bring an action occurs before addressing the merits \nof that individual’s claim.  Id. at 820.  Standing means that the individual bringing the claim has \n“establish[ed] that [his or her] claimed injury is personal, particularized, concrete, and otherwise \njudicially cognizable.”  Id.  In order for a case to be properly before a court, plaintiffs must \nestablish constitutional and prudential standing.   Here, plaintiffs are responding to a motion to \ndismiss, so their allegations in the complaint must be accepted as true for purposes of standing.  \nSee Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 501 (1975) (when plaintiffs respond to a motion to dismiss \nfor  lack  of  standing,  “both  the  trial  and  reviewing  courts  must  accept  as  true  all  material \nallegations of the complaint, and must construe the complaint in favor of the complaining \nparty.”).   \n  1.  Constitutional Standing \n  Constitutional standing requires a plaintiff to show (1) an “injury in fact” which is (2) \n“fairly traceable” to the defendant’s conduct and (3) likely to be redressed by the requested \nrelief.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992).  An “injury in fact” is \ndefined as “an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized . . . \nand (b) ‘actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.’” Id. at 560 (citations omitted).  The \nplaintiff bears the burden of establishing each element of standing.  Id. at 561.    \n  32\n\n \n  Plan B is most effective when taken within 24 hours of sexual intercourse and loses its \neffectiveness if taken later than 72 hours after intercourse.  Thus, the delay occasioned by having \nto obtain a prescription from a licensed physician prior to purchasing Plan B may increase the \nchance of unwanted pregnancy.  As approved, Plan B is a behind-the-counter (BTC) drug for \nwhich the adolescent plaintiffs, who are all under the age of 16, must obtain a prescription.  The \nprescription requirement presents substantial obstacles to the adolescent plaintiffs’ quick access \nto Plan B.  For Plan B to be effective, an adolescent plaintiff must locate and visit a doctor before \nlocating and obtaining Plan B at a pharmacy, all within 72 hours of sexual intercourse.   See, e.g., \nPls.’ Reply Ex. 1 at Angelica Jaffe Dec. ¶¶ 6, 10.  Any delay encountered during this process \nmay render access to Plan B useless.  Moreover, the fear and anxiety that delayed access to Plan \nB may cause the adolescent plaintiffs is sufficient to meet the injury in fact requirement.  Indeed, \nthe Second Circuit has held that “[i]njury in fact is a low threshold, which . . . ‘need not be \ncapable of sustaining a valid cause of action,’ but ‘may simply be the fear or anxiety of future \nharm.’”  Ross v. Bank of Am., N.A. (U.S.A.), 524 F.3d 217, 222 (2d Cir. 2008).  Because of the \nburden imposed by the prescription requirement and the fear and anxiety it causes, the adolescent \nplaintiffs have alleged sufficient injury from the FDA’s denial of the Citizen Petition.       \n  The FDA argues that the adolescent plaintiffs have suffered no injury because their \nparents may obtain Plan B on behalf of their daughters without having to obtain a prescription.  \nPassing over the validity of the assumption that parents would in fact obtain Plan B for their \nadolescent daughters in advance, this argument ignores statutory provisions which prohibit the \ndispensing of a prescription drug other than upon the “written prescription of a practitioner \nlicensed by law to administer the drug.”  21 U.S.C. § 353(b).  Parents who obtain Plan B to \nprovide it to their daughters, absent a prescription for their daughters’ use, would be engaged in a \n  33\n\n \nprohibited act under the FDCA, id. §331(k), for which they may be “imprisoned for not more \nthan one year or fined not more than $1,000, or both.”  Id. § 333(a)(1).  The FDA argues that \nthere is no evidence a parent who provided Plan B to his or her own child would be prosecuted.  \nThe suggestion that it would be appropriate for parents to violate the FDCA misses the point.  \nThat  the  threat  of  prosecution  is  unlikely  does  not  sufficiently  address  the  injury  to  the \nadolescent plaintiffs.  See Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 154 (1967).   \n  The  MAP  Conspiracy  plaintiffs,  individual  members  of  the  Morning–After  Pill \nConspiracy who bring suit as individuals and in their organizational capacity, adequately allege \ninjury with respect to their own use of Plan B.  Compl. ¶¶ 4-14; see Pls.’ Ex. C-1 at Jenny Brown \nDec.  The burden imposed by the point-of-sale restriction may so delay a woman’s ability to \nobtain Plan B quickly that it would reduce the efficacy of the drug and increase the chance of \nunwanted pregnancy.  Brown Dec. ¶¶ 4, 5, 9.  For some women, it may be nearly impossible to \nfind an open pharmacy or health clinic quickly enough after engaging in unprotected sex for Plan \nB to be effective.  Id. at ¶ 3.   \nWhile the FDA challenges only the injury component of the standing inquiry, it is \nnecessary to evaluate the remaining two elements:  causation and redressability.  Here, the \nclaimed injuries are clearly traceable to the FDA’s actions.  Each plaintiff claims a specific \ninjury resulting from the FDA’s denial of OTC access without restriction and implementation of \nthe BTC regime for Plan B.  The FDA’s action prevents the adolescent plaintiffs from obtaining \nPlan B without a prescription.  It also limits its availability to the MAP Conspiracy plaintiffs \nbecause they must produce government identification to obtain the drug, and may only do so at a \npharmacy  or  health  clinic.    There  is  no  question  that  the  FDA  has  directly  affected  these \nplaintiffs’ access to Plan B.  Moreover, these plaintiffs have also shown that their injuries would \n  34\n\n \nbe redressed if the FDA was ordered to approve OTC use of Plan B without age or point-of-sale \nrestrictions or if on remand the FDA reconsidered and removed these restrictions.     \n  2.  Prudential Standing and the Zone of Interests   \n  The FDA argues that even if plaintiffs have constitutional standing, they lack prudential \nstanding because they do not fall within the zone of interests of the FDCA.  Prudential standing \nrequires that “the constitutional or statutory provision on which the claim rests properly can be \nunderstood as granting persons in the plaintiff’s position a right to judicial relief.”  Warth, 422 \nU.S. at 500.  In other words, to establish prudential standing, “a plaintiff’s grievance must \narguably fall within the zone of interests protected or regulated by the statutory provision or \nconstitutional guarantee invoked in the suit.”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 162 (1997).  The \nprudential standing test denies review if the plaintiff’s interests are only “marginally related” to \nthe statute’s purpose, but prudential standing is not intended to be a harsh barrier to the courts.  \nClarke  v.  Secs.  Indus.  Ass’n,  479  U.S.  388,  399  (1987).    Indeed,  the  zone  of  interests \nencompasses “parties whose interests, while not in any specific or obvious sense among those \nCongress  intended  to  protect,  coincide  with  the  protected  interests.”    Hazardous  Waste \nTreatment Council v. Thomas, 885 F.2d 918, 922 (D.C. Cir. 1989). \n  Both  the  adolescent  plaintiffs  and  the  MAP  Conspiracy  plaintiffs  meet  prudential \nstanding requirements.  The FDA argues that the FDCA was not intended to provide anonymous \naccess to emergency contraception.  Plaintiffs, however, do not argue this to be the FDCA’s \npurpose.  Instead, they argue that the FDCA’s purpose goes beyond simply protecting consumers \nfrom dangerous or harmful drugs.  Plaintiffs rely on DeFreese v. United States, 270 F.2d 730, \n735 (5th Cir. 1959), in which the Fifth Circuit held that section 353(b)(1) of the FDCA was \nintended, in part, to relieve pharmacists and the public from burdensome restrictions regulating \n  35\n\n \nthe dispensing of drugs that are sold without a physician’s supervision.  Id. (citing H.R. Rep. No. \n82-700 at 2454 (1951)); see also S. Rep. No. 82-946 (1951), as reprinted in 1951 U.S.C.C.A.N. \n2454, 2454.  The adolescent plaintiffs fall within the zone of interests of the FDCA because they \nare among the class of individuals whom the statute was intended to protect by providing non-\nprescription access to a drug when a prescription would be “burdensome and unnecessary.”  Id.  \nPlaintiffs  have  alleged  that  the  prescription  requirement  is  unnecessary  because  young \nadolescents can use Plan B safely without a prescription.  Whether it is, in fact, unnecessary goes \nto the merits of plaintiffs’ claims, not to standing.  See Ross, 524 F.3d at 222 (“the fact that the \ninjury  may  be  outweighed  by  other  benefits  .  .  .  does  not  negate  standing.”).    The  MAP \nConspiracy plaintiffs also fall within the zone of interests of the FDCA because they can claim \nthey should not be subjected to the burdensome restriction of having to locate a pharmacy that \nsells Plan B and produce valid identification in order to obtain it. \nB.   Review of Agency Action under the Arbitrary and Capricious Standard \n  The APA provides that a district court may set aside an agency’s findings, conclusions of \nlaw or action only if they are “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  An agency decision may be deemed arbitrary and \ncapricious: \nif the agency has relied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider, \nentirely  failed  to  consider  an  important  aspect  of  the  problem,  offered  an \nexplanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or \nis so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the \nproduct of agency expertise.   \n \nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 \n(1983); accord Yale-New Haven Hosp. v. Leavitt, 470 F.3d 71, 79 (2d Cir. 2006).  Moreover, \n“proof of subjective bad faith by [agency decision-makers], depriving a [petitioner] of fair and \n  36\n\n \nhonest  consideration  of  its  proposal,  generally  constitutes  arbitrary  and  capricious  action.”  \nLatecoere Int’l, Inc. v. U.S. Dept. of Navy, 19 F.3d 1342, 1356 (11th Cir. 1994); James Madison \nLtd. v. Ludwig, 82 F.3d 1085, 1096 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (bad faith is “material to determining \nwhether the Government acted arbitrarily”).  \nWhile this standard of review is deferential, courts “do not hear cases merely to rubber \nstamp agency actions.  To play that role would be ‘tantamount to abdicating the judiciary’s \nresponsibility under the Administrative Procedure Act.’”  Nat’l Res. Def. Council v. Daley, 209 \nF.3d 747, 755 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (quoting A.L. Pharma, Inc. v. Shalala, 62 F.3d 1484, 1491 (D.C. \nCir. 1995)). On the contrary, to be upheld upon judicial review, the agency must have articulated \n“a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.”  Henley v. Food and Drug \nAdmin., 77 F.3d 616, 620 (2d Cir. 1996) (quotations marks omitted).   \nC.   The Proper Record on Review \n  Before applying the foregoing standard, it is necessary to consider the threshold issue of \nthe proper record on review.  Throughout this litigation, the FDA has attempted to sever the \nrelationship between its review of the supplemental new drug applications (SNDAs) submitted \nby the Plan B sponsor and the Citizen Petition, arguing that judicial review of its denial of the \nCitizen Petition must be limited to the administrative record compiled for the Citizen Petition \nalone.  Consistent with this position, the FDA  moved to strike from plaintiffs’ motion all \nreferences to, and attachments of, materials not contained in the administrative record for the \nCitizen Petition, including all materials contained in the administrative record for the SNDA and \nall declarations, deposition transcripts, and documents obtained in discovery.   \n  The  FDA  relies  on  the  rule  that  a  reviewing  court  must  judge  the  propriety  of \nadministrative agency action “by the grounds invoked by the agency.”  Secs. Exch. Comm’n v. \n  37\n\n \nChenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 196 (1947).  “[T]he task of the reviewing court is to apply the \nappropriate APA standard of review, 5 U.S.C. § 706, to the agency decision based on the record \nthe agency presents to the reviewing court.”  Fla. Power & Light Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, \n743-44  (1985).    “Generally,  a  court  reviewing  an  agency  decision  is  confined  to  the \nadministrative record compiled by that agency when it made the decision.”  Nat’l Audubon Soc’y \nv. Hoffman, 132 F.3d 7, 14 (2d Cir. 1997) (citing Fla. Power, 470 U.S. at 743-44).  The rationale \nbehind the “record rule” is that a reviewing court, “in dealing with a determination or judgment \nwhich an administrative agency alone is authorized to make,” Chenery, 332 U.S. at 196, should \nnot conduct a de novo trial, review materials not before the agency when the decision was made, \nor substitute its opinion for that of the agency. \n  None of the dangers the record rule is designed to prevent are implicated by consideration \nof the materials in the administrative record for the SNDAs submitted by the Plan B sponsor \nbecause these materials were “before the agency when the decision was made” and because the \nFDA itself relied on those materials when it denied the Citizen Petition.  Indeed, from the very \nbeginning, FDA staff acknowledged that the Plan B sponsor would work with the FDA to \naddress any concerns raised by the Citizen Petition.  Def.’s Ex. 3 at T-30023.  Moreover, no \nmeaningful review of the denial of the Citizen Petition would be possible without a review of the \nadministrative record for the SNDAs because the FDA understood the issues presented by the \nSNDAs and Citizen Petition to be one and the same.  The FDA conceded as much when, in its \ndenial of the Citizen Petition, it wrote that it “expected that some or all of the issues . . . raised in \n[the] petition would be resolved in the then-anticipated SNDA proceeding; in fact, they might \nstill be resolved in that proceeding,” Def.’s Ex. 1 at C013.     \n  38\n\n \n  The FDA’s actions and decisions with respect to the initial SNDA were inextricably tied \nto its decision-making on the Citizen Petition.  And the later decisions, which occurred after the \ndenial of the Citizen Petition, are relevant to a review of the decision on the Citizen Petition \nbecause, by the FDA’s own admission, those later decisions “resolved” some of the issues raised \nin the Citizen Petition.  In short, the complete “record” for the FDA’s decision regarding the \nCitizen Petition includes its own administrative record for both the Citizen Petition and the \nSNDAs.   \nMoreover, the law is clear that, despite the “record rule,” a reviewing court may consider \nextra-record materials in certain circumstances.  See Nat’l Audubon, 132 F.3d at 14.  Indeed, “a \nstrong  showing  of  bad  faith  or  improper  behavior”  may  justify  supplementing  the  record.  \nCitizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 420 (1971).  Thus, when the agency \naction cannot be adequately explained in the record it compiled, the court’s consideration of \nevidence outside the agency’s “administrative record” is not only warranted, Esch v. Yeutter, 876 \nF.2d 976, 991 (D.C. Cir. 1989), but necessary to a meaningful judicial review of the agency’s \naction.  See Asarco, Inc. v. EPA, 616 F.2d 1153, 1160 (9th Cir. 1980) (agency record may be \nsupplemented when additional information “fully explicate[s] . . . [the agency’]s course of \nconduct” in reaching its decision.).   \n  U.S. magistrate judge Pohorelsky and I both have found that plaintiffs have made a \nstrong showing that the FDA acted in bad faith with respect to the Plan B switch applications.  \nSee, e.g., Tummino v. von Eschenbach, 427 F. Supp. 2d 212, 231-34 (E.D.N.Y. 2006); Oct. 11, \n2006 Hr’g Tr. 20; July 26, 2006 Hr’g Tr. 9:1; Dec. 22, 2005 Hr’g. Tr. 95.  The FDA argues that \nU.S. magistrate judge Pohorelsky’s finding of bad faith was limited to its failure at the time to \nmake a final decision with regard to either the Citizen Petition or the initial SNDA.  Thus, it \n  39\n\n \nargues that finding is now irrelevant because it has made a final decision and plaintiffs have \nabandoned their unreasonable delay claim as moot.  This argument might have some plausibility \nif this was the only evidence of bad faith.  Instead, it was merely the tip of the iceberg.   \n  Thus, U.S. magistrate judge Pohorelsky observed that there was a “real” concern about \nthe general “integrity of the FDA’s decisionmaking in connection with OTC access to Plan B.”  \nTummino,  427  F.  Supp.  2d  at  234.    He  noted  the  unusual  involvement  of  FDA  upper \nmanagement in the review process; evidence that FDA officials were motivated by “improper \nconcerns about the morality of adolescent sexual activity;” evidence that the decision not to \napprove the OTC switch was made before review staff had completed their reviews; the refusal \nto adopt the recommendations of professional review staff and the Advisory Committee; the \nresignations of Drs. Wood and Davidoff; and the GAO’s findings of procedural irregularities in \nthe FDA’s consideration of the Plan B OTC switch.  Id. at 231-34.  Indeed, the FDA’s conduct \nand the chain of events leading up to the decision on the Citizen Petition cannot be fully \nunderstood without reviewing the administrative record the FDA compiled with respect to the \nPlan B sponsor’s OTC switch applications, the deposition testimony of key FDA decision-\nmakers and other materials illuminating these decision-making processes and the extent to which \nimpermissible political and ideological considerations influenced the FDA’s decisions on the \nPlan B switch applications.  \nD.    The  FDA’s  Decision  Was  Not  the  Result  of  Good  Faith  and  Reasoned  Agency \n  Decision-Making \n \n  Plaintiffs have presented unrebutted evidence of the FDA’s lack of good faith regarding \nits decisions on the Plan B switch applications.  This lack of good faith is evidenced by, among \nother things, (1) repeated and unreasonable delays, pressure emanating from the White House, \nand the obvious connection between the confirmation process of two FDA Commissioners and \n  40\n\n \nthe  timing  of  the  FDA’s  decisions;  and  (2)  significant  departures  from  the  FDA’s  normal \nprocedures and policies in the review of the Plan B switch applications as compared to the \nreview of other switch applications in the past 10 years.  I address each in turn. \n  1.  Improper Political Influence \n \n“To support a claim of improper political influence on a federal administrative agency, \nthere must be some showing that the political pressure was intended to and did cause the \nagency’s action to be influenced by factors not relevant under the controlling statute.”  Town of \nOrangetown v. Ruckelshaus, 740 F.2d 185, 188 (2d Cir. 1984).  An agency’s consideration of \nsome relevant factors does not “immunize” the decision; it would still “be invalid if based in \nwhole or in part on the pressures emanating from [political actors].”  D.C. Fed’n of Civic Assocs. \nv. Volpe, 459 F.2d 1231, 1246, 1248 (D.C. Cir. 1971).   \nThe  D.C.  Circuit’s  decision  in  D.C.  Fed’n  is  instructive.    D.C.  Fed’n  involved  the \napproval  of  a  bridge  construction  project  over  the  Potomac  River  by  the  Secretary  of \nTransportation.  While the agency decision was pending, an influential Congressman made \npublic statements that he would do everything in his power to block appropriations for the D.C. \nsubway system until the bridge project was approved.  Id. at 1236.  The D.C. Circuit found the \nCongressman’s statements had improperly influenced the Secretary’s decision to approve the \nbridge project.  Although the lack of a sufficient administrative record for the decision troubled \nthe court, it held that “[e]ven if the Secretary had taken every formal step required by every \napplicable statutory provision, reversal would be required . . . because extraneous pressure \nintruded into the calculus of considerations on which the Secretary's decision was based.”  Id. at \n1245-46.  Thus, while the FDA may have considered certain relevant factors in deciding to \nrestrict OTC access to Plan B, D.C. Fed’n suggests that the mere existence of “extraneous \npressure” from the White House or other political quarters would render its decision invalid.   \n  41\n\n \nAnother case, Latecoere Int’l, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Navy, 19 F.3d 1342 (11th Cir. 1994), \nwhose facts are analogous to those here, also supplies compelling support for plaintiffs’ position \nthat the FDA’s bad faith renders its decision arbitrary and capricious.  There, a disappointed \nbidder on a Navy contract, Latecoere, challenged the Navy’s decision to award a pilot training \nsystem contract to a competitor, ETC.  Specifically, Latecoere argued that no rational basis \nexisted for awarding the contract to ETC and that the award was motivated by bias for ETC, an \nAmerican  company,  and  against  Latecoere,  a  French  company.    Id.  at  1344.    Under  a \nMemorandum of Understanding between the United States and France, the Navy was required to \ntreat all French firms as it would an American firm.  Id. at 1346-47.  In the initial review of \nproposals for the contract, the experts charged with assisting in the decision “all agreed that \nLateceore’s  proposal  was  acceptable  and  ETC’s  was  not.”    Id.  at  1347.    Despite  this \nrecommendation, however, the officials within the Office of the Secretary of the Navy decided to \naward the contract to ETC.  Id. at 1351.  Notwithstanding evidence that the decision was based \non the “potential political consequences of . . . awarding the contract to a foreign company,” id. \nat 1350-51, the Navy justified the decision on the basis of cost.  Id. at 1352.  The Eleventh \nCircuit held that “by the simple expedient of denying bias, a government official can [not] wipe \naway all evidence of it.”  Id. at 1365.   Referring to the actions of the official charged with \noverseeing the contract award decision, the court wrote:   \nAssistant Director Ford[’s] . . . actions evidencing bias speak louder than his \nwords denying it. When the matter came to him, the forty or so experts of the \nEvaluation Board, after carefully studying all of the proposals, had found that . . . \nLatecoere . . . [was] capable of satisfying the requirements for constructing the \nsystem; ETC was not. The Advisory Council, composed of the senior officials of \nthe Training Center, had agreed with that finding and recommended that the \ncontract be awarded to Latecoere. The original Selection Authority . . . had \nchosen Latecoere, warning in a selection decision document that the proposals of \nETC and two other domestic corporations were “unacceptable” and that awarding \nthe project to an unacceptable offeror, such as ETC, would risk the loss of human \n  42\n\n \nlives. In the face of all of those uniform recommendations-and in spite of the \nwarnings  about  human  lives  being  at  stake-Ford  refused  to  sign  off  on  the \ndecision to award the contract to Latecoere. Instead, after his senior procurement \nanalyst raised “Buy American” considerations and political ramifications, Ford \ndemanded that negotiations be conducted with all the companies no matter how \n“unacceptable” their offers were. Furthermore, Ford did so only after expressing \nhis own concern about the political problems of awarding the contract to a French \ncompany  when  American  companies  had  been  found  to  be  outside  the \ncompetitive range. Whatever Ford may have said later when pinned down and \nspeaking “on the record,” the evidence strongly supports the inference that his \nactions  manifested  bias.  Those  actions  sent  a  message  that  was  heard-and \nresponded to-during the remainder of the . . . procurement process. \n \nId. at 1365.   \n  Just as in Latecoere, the Advisory Committee and FDA scientific review staff strongly \nrecommended approving Plan B OTC without age restriction, finding that restricting access to \nyoung adolescents would present greater health risks that making Plan B freely available.  And \njust as in Latecoere, despite this recommendation, the FDA refused to approve the Citizen \nPetition and first SNDA submitted by the Plan B sponsor.  Instead, before the scientific reviews \nwere complete, the Commissioner decided that unrestricted OTC access could not be approved, \nbecause of his concern about the inadequacy of data available for young adolescents.  Plaintiffs \nhave proffered evidence that the Commissioner did not make the decision on his own, but was \npressured by the White House and “constituents who would be very unhappy with . . . an over-\nthe-counter Plan B.”  Pls.’ Ex. D-2 at Kweder Dep. 56:21-22.  There is also evidence that the \nCommissioner transmitted this pressure down the chain of command at the FDA:  pressuring Dr. \nGalson not to approve over-the-counter use of Plan B without age restriction, see Pls.’ Reply Ex. \n4 at Jenkins Dep. 232:5-17; id. at Wood Dep. 24:9-22; and removing Dr. Galson’s authority to \nmake any decision on Plan B after he told the Commissioner that he believed Plan B could be \nused safely OTC by adolescents 17 and older.  Pls.’ Ex. D-1 at Galson Dep. 186:20-187:18.  \nMoreover, despite the overwhelming evidence that Plan B could be used safely and effectively \n  43\n\n \nby 17 year olds without a prescription, the FDA, citing fanciful and wholly unsubstantiated \n“enforcement” concerns, arbitrarily and capriciously limited that age groups access to Plan B.   \n  Indeed, the evidence strongly suggests that even the decision to permit the OTC sale of \nPlan B to women over the age of 18 was made solely to facilitate the confirmation of Dr. von \nEschenbach as Commissioner of the FDA.  This change of policy came one day before Dr. von \nEschenbach’s confirmation hearing before a Senate committee.  See Stephanie Saul, F.D.A. \nShifts View on Next-Day Pill, N.Y. Times, Aug. 1, 2006 at A1.  Dr. von Eschenbach had become \nActing  Commissioner  after  the  resignation  of  his  predecessor,  Dr.  Crawford,  and  he  was \nsubsequently nominated to be Commissioner. Significantly, Senators Hillary Clinton and Patty \nMurray had previously vowed to block any vote on Dr. von Eschenbach’s nomination until the \nFDA decided whether to allow over-the-counter sales of Plan B.  Id.; Gardiner Harris, Bush \nPicks F.D.A. Chief, but Vote is Unlikely Soon, N.Y. Times, Mar. 16, 2006 at A18.  Since the \nFDA had already reneged on its earlier promise to promptly reach a final decision on Plan B in \norder to obtain former-Commissioner Crawford’s confirmation, it must have been apparent to the \nFDA that a mere promise to decide would no longer suffice to secure Dr. von Eschenbach’s \nconfirmation. \n  This inference, that the timing of the FDA’s decision was linked to Dr. von Eschenbach’s \nconfirmation hearings, is buttressed by representations made by the attorneys representing the \nFDA during this litigation.  At a hearing in this proceeding only one week before the FDA \ndecided to act on Plan B, I inquired why, if the FDA had determined that women 17 and older \ncould use Plan B safely, it had not yet approved over-the-counter use for that age group.  July 26, \n2006 Hr’g Tr. 17:9-14.  The attorneys representing the FDA – an Assistant United States \nAttorney with an FDA attorney at his side – responded that “the [FDCA] does not provide the \n  44\n\n \nagency – at least it does not clearly provide the agency with the statutory authority to make that \nkind of age based distinction.”  Id. at 19:11-14.   Under the FDCA, he continued, “a product is \neither Rx only or non-prescription,” id. at 20:19-20, “[t]here is no behind the counter option \navailable under federal law.”  Id. at 20:14-15.  “Congress, [he said,] has not given [the FDA] an \nenforcement  mechanism  that  would  provide  it  with  an  ability  to  enforce  that  kind  of  age \nrestriction.”  Id. at 22:7-9.  Nevertheless, within a month of this representation, the gap in the \nFDA’s authority had somehow been filled and Dr. von Eschenbach confirmed. \n2.  Departures from Its Own Policies  \n  The evidence of lack of good faith is also confirmed by the manner in which the FDA \ndeparted from its normal procedures for evaluating OTC switch applications when it considered \nthe Plan B applications.  The most glaring procedural departure was the decision to act against \nthe Advisory Committee’s recommendation to approve the Plan B OTC switch application \nwithout age restriction.  Pls.’ Ex. B, GAO Report at 29.  While advisory committees do not have \nthe final say on OTC switch applications, the fact remains that in every such application in the \nlast decade, the FDA has followed committee recommendations.     \n  The FDA’s decision regarding Plan B departed from its general policies and practices in \nat  least  four  other  respects.    The  first  is  the  placement  of  additional  members  on  the \nReproductive  Health  Drugs  Advisory  Committee  for  the  purpose  of  achieving  ideological \nbalance.  See, e.g., Pls.’ Ex. D-2 at Kweder Dep. 36:12-21; 37:8-10.  This goal of ideological \ndiversity does not aid the FDA in its obligation to examine the safety and effectiveness of a \ndrug’s use in self-medication.  21 U.S.C. §§ 353(b)(1), 355(d).   \n  The second departure was the unusual involvement of the White House in the Plan B \ndecision-making process.  See Pls.’ Ex. D-2 at McClellan Dep. 127-132,140:19-141:13; id. at \n  45\n\n \nKweder Dep. 56:8-58:19.  Whether or not it was permissible for the FDA to discuss such \nquestions with the White House, these discussions were not the norm for the FDA with respect to \nthis type of decision.   \n  The third departure concerns the timing of the decision to deny OTC use without age \nrestriction.  Plaintiffs presented evidence and the GAO made findings which indicate that the \ndecision regarding the OTC status of Plan B may have been made before the scientific reviews of \nthe OTC switch application were complete, and without consultation with FDA scientists.  Pls.’ \nEx. B, GAO Report at 21-22.  If the decision was made prior to the completion of the scientific \nreviews, this would certainly be evidence of a departure from the typical FDA decision-making \nprocess.  Moreover, such a premature decision would lend further support to plaintiffs’ theory \nthat FDA upper management were pressured by the White House to deny young adolescents \nOTC access to Plan B regardless of whether the scientific evidence supported a finding that they \ncould use Plan B safely and effectively.  See D.C. Fed’n, 459 F.2d at 1245 (finding evidence that \n“the  Secretary  [of  Transportations’]  determinations  –  in  particular,  his  effort  to  make  the \ndeterminations before plans for the bridge were complete – lend color to plaintiffs’ contention \nthat [political pressure] did have an impact on the Secretary’s decisions.”). \nThe fourth departure was the FDA’s refusal to extrapolate actual use study data from the \nolder age group to the 16 and younger age group.  There is evidence in the record that the FDA \nroutinely extrapolated such data when reviewing the safety and effectiveness of various other \ncontraceptives.  Indeed, the draft minutes from an internal FDA meeting held in May 2004, \ncontain the following comment regarding the decision not to extrapolate for Plan B: \nThe inability to extrapolate adolescent safety and effectiveness for <14 year old \nfemales is not consistent with how CDER handles approval and distribution of \nprescription oral contraceptives, OTC male contraceptives such as condoms and \nspermacides or OTC female contraceptives such as gels and sponges.  In addition, \n  46\n\n \nCDER routinely denies sponsors requests to issues Written Requests for Pediatric \nStudies for oral contraceptives as the responses to these drugs are considered the \nsame for all menstruating females and additional studies are not necessary. \n \nT-1213.  This was contained in an initial draft of the minutes, although it was subsequently \ndeleted for reasons which are unclear.  Nevertheless, it accurately reflected the FDA’s policy of \nextrapolating data from older to younger populations.  See Pls.’ Ex. A-3 at T-30898 (referring to \nthe FDA’s “long history” of extrapolating data).  Indeed, not only did review staff find it \nappropriate to extrapolate findings in this case, but, in one of its first communications with the \nPlan B sponsor concerning the anticipated OTC switch application, the FDA indicated that the \n“proposed trials [i.e., the actual use study] could be conducted in the adult population and the \nresults extrapolated to the postmenarcheal pediatric population.”  Pls.’ Ex. F-1 at T-30100. \n  Plaintiffs point to other FDA actions that they claim were departures from standard FDA \npractices.  For example, this was the only OTC switch application decided at the level of CDER \nDirector or higher in the past 10 years – the decision is typically made by the Office Director.  \nPls.’ Ex. B, GAO Report at 30.  Indeed, at the guidance meeting held with the Plan B sponsor on \nJanuary 23, 2004, FDA staff informed the sponsor that the “Divisions were ready to negotiate \nlabeling with you today, but on January 15, 2004 we were informed by . . . Dr. Steven Galson, \nthat the regulatory decision for the action on your application would be made by CDER [Center \nfor Drug Evaluation and Research] upper management (above the ODE level).  This is not the \nusual or typical CDER process for determining approvability of an NDA.”  Pls.’ Ex. A-2 at T-\n30686 (emphasis added); see also Pls.’ Ex. D-1 at Jenkins Dep. 33:8-12 (“I think it’s important \nto explain that for most applications the Commissioner’s not directly involved in the decision-\nmaking of the Application”).   \n  47\n\n \n  Plaintiffs also argue that Plan B is the first drug for which the FDA sought additional data \nfor adolescents, and that it is the only drug for which the FDA based its decision on adolescent \ncognitive development.  Pls.’ Ex. B, GAO Report at 5-6; Pls.’ Ex. A-4 at T-31098.  The FDA \nargues that Plan B is different from other drugs because it is preventive rather than reactive.  \nWhile it may have been rational for the FDA to consider adolescent cognitive development in its \nevaluation of Plan B as an OTC drug, plaintiffs have presented unrebutted evidence that the \nFDA’s  focus  on  these  behavioral  concerns  stemmed  from  political  pressure  rather  than \npermissible health and safety concerns.   \n  Notwithstanding all of these departures, the FDA argues that there is no customary \nagency practice and “[e]very drug presents a unique collection of issues, and no two reviews will \nbe identical.”  See Mem. in Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. for Summ. J. at 32.  Plaintiffs do not argue, \nhowever, that the scientific review or risk benefit assessment of all proposed OTC drugs must be \nevaluated in the same manner.  They question why the review of Plan B differed in so many \nsignificant ways from the review of other switch applications in the last 10 years.  The FDA \nsimply has not come forward with an adequate explanation, nor has it presented any evidence to \nrebut plaintiffs’ showing that it acted in bad faith and in response to political pressure.       \nInstead, the FDA has pursued a litigation strategy dependent on the assertion of the \ndeliberative process privilege to prevent plaintiffs from obtaining conclusive evidence as to the \nmerits of its claim.  The FDA claims that it acted in good faith but has consistently sought to \nprevent plaintiffs from obtaining discovery to show otherwise.  This claim of good faith fails in \nthe face of the showing plaintiffs have made here.  See Latecoere Int’l, 19 F.3d at 1365 (the \nsimple denial of bias, or bad faith cannot “wipe away all evidence of it.”).   \n \n  48\n\n \nE.    The Appropriate Remedy  \n    When a court reviewing an agency decision rules in favor of the plaintiff, it generally \nremands to the agency rather than granting affirmative relief.  Fla. Power & Light Co. v. Lorion, \n470 U.S. 729, 744 (1985).  Certain circumstances, however, warrant exception to this general \nremand rule.  Fla. Power, 470 U.S. at 744.  Where a court has found that an agency decision is \nnot supported by the record, but “‘the record has been fully developed,’” remand would fail to \n“‘serve a useful purpose.’”  Sierra Club v. EPA, 346 F.3d 955, 963 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting \nSmolen v. Chater, 80 F.3d 1273, 1292 (9th Cir.1996).  Sierra Club is instructive.  There, the \nNinth Circuit found erroneous the EPA’s conclusion that, but for transborder emissions coming \nfrom Mexico, Imperial Valley, CA, would have satisfied the standards for air quality emissions \nrequired by the Clean Air Act.  Id. at 958.  Instead of remanding for the EPA to reconsider its \ndecision, the Ninth Circuit remanded with instructions that the EPA classify Imperial Valley as a \n“‘serious’  nonattainment  area”  –  i.e.,  noncompliant  with  applicable  air  quality  standards  – \nbecause it “fail[ed] to see how further administrative proceedings would serve a useful purpose; \nthe record here has been fully developed, and the conclusions that must follow from it are clear.”  \nId. at 963  (emphasis added).   \n    Plaintiffs argue that remand here is unnecessary because no further agency investigation \nor explanation would be of any value.  Remand would be fruitless, they argue, because “the \nagency is set on a course to treat Plan B as a sui generis drug that demands unprecedented \nrestrictions.”  Pls.’ Reply Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. at 8-9.  Additionally, plaintiffs \nargue that “the agency has acted so improperly and in such bad faith that it cannot be trusted to \nconduct a fair assessment of the scientific evidence.”  Id. at 9.  Nevertheless, remand to the FDA \nfor it to reconsider its denial of the Citizen Petition is the appropriate remedy for two reasons.  \n  49\n\n \nFirst, the circumstances have changed since these words were written.  Commissioner von \nEschenbach has resigned and his replacement, as well as a new Deputy Commissioner, has been \nnominated by the President.  This change in the leadership suggests that, in plaintiffs’ words, it \ncan be “trusted to conduct a fair assessment of the scientific evidence.”  Second, a decision \nwhether  Plan  B,  a  systemic  hormonal  contraceptive  drug,  may  be  used  safely  without  a \nprescription by children as young as 11 or 12, is best left to the expertise of the FDA, to which \nCongress has entrusted this responsibility; it should not be made by a federal district court judge.   \nA remand would serve no purpose with respect to one aspect of the FDA’s decision – \nrequiring that 17 year olds obtain a prescription for Plan B.  The record is clear:  the FDA’s \njustification for the denial of OTC access to Plan B for women over the age of 17 – rather than \n18 – “runs counter to the evidence” and “is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a \ndifference in view or the product of agency expertise.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. \nState Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  Indeed, the sole justification for limiting \naccess based on age was that the Commissioner had decided  that there was a lack of adequate \ndata to support a finding that women age 16 and younger could use Plan B safely without a \nprescription.  Def.’s Ex. 3 at T-30666-70.  But as to 17 year olds, the “scientific data [is] \nsufficient to support the safe use of Plan B as an OTC product . . . for women who are 17 years \nof age and older.”   Def.’s Ex. 2 at T-10813.  The scientific data notwithstanding, Commissioner \nvon Eschenbach decided that because of “the difficulty of enforcing an age-based restriction on \nthe  availability  of  this  oral  hormonal  contraceptive,  .  .  .  18  (rather  than  17)  is  the  more \nappropriate cutoff point to best promote and protect the public health.”  Def.’s Ex. 2 at T-10866.  \nThe notion that those selling Plan B would not be able to determine whether an individual was \n17, as opposed to 18, based on government issued identification is simply untenable.   \n  50\n\n \n    Plan B is a time sensitive drug and is most effective if taken within 24 hours of sexual \nintercourse and loses effectiveness if not taken within 72 hours.  Thus, barriers like a prescription \nrequirement, which delay access to Plan B, may needlessly increase the chances that 17 year olds \nwill  suffer  unwanted  pregnancies.    The  hypothetical  enforcement  issue  is  an  implausible \nexplanation for the decision to deprive 17 year olds, whom the FDA has concluded can use Plan \nB OTC safely, of the much enhanced ease of obtaining Plan B without a prescription.  The FDA \nsimply has offered no evidence that the age restriction would be unenforceable at 17 rather than \n18.  With respect to this issue, it is difficult “to see how further administrative proceedings would \nserve a useful purpose; the record [on this issue] has been fully developed, and the conclusions \nthat follow from it are clear.”  Sierra Club, 346 F.3d at 963.   \nConclusion \n    The denial of the Citizen Petition is vacated and the matter is remanded to the FDA to \nreconsider its decisions regarding the Plan B switch to OTC use.  The FDA is also ordered to \npermit Barr Pharmaceuticals, Inc. the Plan B drug sponsor, to make Plan B available to 17 year \nolds without a prescription, under the same conditions as Plan B is now available to women over \nthe age of 18.  The latter order should be complied with within thirty days.  Because of the \nforegoing, it is unnecessary to rule on plaintiffs various substantive challenges to the FDA’s \ndecisions regarding Plan B.  Similarly, it would be premature to reach the merits of plaintiffs’ \nvarious constitutional challenges to the FDA’s decisions regarding Plan B.  “A fundamental and  \n \n \n  51\n\n \nlongstanding principle of judicial restraint requires that courts avoid reaching constitutional \nquestions in advance of the necessity of deciding them.”  Lyng v.
