The case also concerned a zero-tolerance policy that the department instituted whereby the abortion facilities received no notice or opportunity to correct violations before having their license revoked. On September 20, 2010, several clinics that operate in Louisiana as well as a physician, represented by private counsel and the Center for Reproductive Rights, filed suit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana under 42 U.S.C. &sect;1983. The plaintiffs sued the Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals for violating their equal protection and substantive due process rights as well as for violating the plaintiff's rights physician&rsquo;s patients&rsquo; right to terminate a pregnancy. The plaintiffs also challenged the constitutionality of the Act based on a claim that it was too vague, and they sought declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to Judge James J. Brady.</p>\r\n<p>On December 14, 2010, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss which was granted by the court on February 23, 2011 on the basis that the case was not yet ripe. 781 F.Supp.2d 313.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs appealed the decision on March 25, 2011 to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals (USCA 11-30296). The Fifth Circuit on August 17, 2012 affirmed the district court's decision. In an opinion written by Judge Priscilla R. Owen and joined by Judge Edith Clement, the court held that the case was not ripe. Specifically, the actual hardship that the plaintiffs alleged had not yet occurred and therefore was not caused by the state's act. 691 F.3d 710. Judge James Dennis filed a dissenting opinion, arguing that the case was ripe for judicial review because the law modified the clinics' formal&nbsp;legal licenses and imposed new civil liability in the form of sanctions.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs did not appeal this decision to the Supreme Court. This case is closed as of September 13, 2012.&nbsp;</p>",

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n1.  Plaintiffs are five medical facilities currently licensed to provide outpatient abortion \nservices in the State of Louisiana, and a physician who performs abortions at some of those \nfacilities. \n                                                 \n1 On September 20, 2010, Plaintiffs filed this action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of \nLouisiana.  On November 10, 2010, Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1), \n12(b)(2), and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure alleging, inter alia, that venue is improper in the \nEastern District of Louisiana such that this action should be dismissed without prejudice or transferred to the United \nStates District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana.  Although Plaintiffs dispute Defendant’s assertions \nregarding the appropriateness of venue in the Eastern District of Louisiana, Plaintiffs were willing to move the \naction rather than expend time and resources contesting issues of venue.  Thus, on November 17, 2010, Plaintiffs \nfiled a notice pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 41(a)(1)(A)(i) voluntarily dismissing the action in the Eastern District of \nLouisiana without prejudice and are hereby immediately refiling this action in the United States District Court for \nthe Middle District of Louisiana.  \nCase 3:10-cv-00783-JJB -CN   Document 1     11/17/10   Page 1 of 28\nny-940912  \n\n2.  Plaintiffs bring this civil rights action under the U.S. Constitution and 42 U.S.C. § \n1983 to challenge the constitutionality of Act 490, Reg. Session (La. 2010) (codified at La. Rev. \nStat. Ann. § 40:2175.6[G]-[I])2, which permits the Secretary (“Secretary”) of the Louisiana \nDepartment of Health and Hospitals (“Department”) to suspend or revoke the license of an \noutpatient abortion facility based on any violation of any state or federal law or regulation, and \nthe Department’s “Zero Tolerance Policy,” pursuant to which the Secretary denies outpatient \nabortion facilities notice of alleged violations and an opportunity to correct them before taking \naction to suspend or revoke a license. \n3.  Act 490 and the Zero Tolerance Policy are unconstitutionally vague and deny the \nPlaintiff medical facilities equal protection of the laws and substantive due process.  They also \nviolate the fundamental right of the Plaintiff physician’s patients to terminate a pregnancy. \n4.  Plaintiffs  seek  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  from  those  constitutional \ndeprivations. \nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5.  Jurisdiction is conferred on this Court by 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(a)(3). \n6.  Plaintiffs’ claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized by 28 U.S.C. §§ \n2201 and 2202; by Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and by the general \nlegal and equitable powers of this Court. \n7.  Venue is appropriate under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because a substantial part of the \nevents or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred in this district and a substantial part of \nproperty that is the subject of the action is situated in this district. \n                                                 \n2 A copy of Act 490 is annexed hereto as Exhibit 1. \n  2   \nCase 3:10-cv-00783-JJB -CN   Document 1     11/17/10   Page 2 of 28\nny-940912  \n\nIII.  PARTIES \n8.  Plaintiff Bossier City Medical Suite, Inc. (“Bossier City Medical”) is a health care \nfacility in Bossier City, Louisiana, that is licensed by the Department to provide outpatient \nabortion services. \n9.  Plaintiff  Choice  Inc.  of  Texas  d/b/a  Causeway  Medical  Clinic  (“Causeway \nMedical”) is a health care facility in Metairie, Louisiana, that is licensed by the Department to \nprovide outpatient abortion services.   \n10.  Plaintiff Delta Clinic of Baton Rouge, Inc. (“Delta Clinic”) is a health care facility \nin Baton Rouge, Louisiana, that is licensed by the Department to provide outpatient abortion \nservices.   \n11.  Plaintiff Midtown Medical, LLC (“Midtown Medical”) is a health care facility in \nNew Orleans, Louisiana, that is licensed by the Department to provide outpatient abortion \nservices.   \n12.  Plaintiff Women’s Health Care Center, Inc. (“Women’s Health Care Center”) is a \nhealth care facility in New Orleans, Louisiana, that is licensed by the Department to provide \noutpatient abortion services.   \n13.  Plaintiff John Doe, M.D., is a physician licensed to practice medicine in the State \nof Louisiana who provides abortion services at some of the licensed outpatient abortion facilities \nin the State.  Dr. Doe sues using a pseudonym to prevent public disclosure of his identity, which \nwould expose him to a substantial risk of harassment, intimidation, and violence by those \nopposed to the lawful provision of abortion services.  Dr. Doe sues on his own behalf and on \nbehalf of his patients seeking professional abortion services. \n14.  Defendant Bruce D. Greenstein is the Secretary of the Department.  He is sued in \nhis official capacity.   \n  3   \nCase 3:10-cv-00783-JJB -CN   Document 1     11/17/10   Page 3 of 28\nny-940912  \n\nIV.  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  The Pre-Amendment Statutory and Regulatory Regime Governing \nOutpatient Abortion Facilities \n1.  The Department of Health and Hospitals \n15.  The Department is part of the executive branch of the State of Louisiana.  La. Rev. \nStat. Ann. § 36:4.  The Department, through its offices and officers, is responsible for “the \ndevelopment and providing of health and medical services for the prevention of disease for the \ncitizens of Louisiana.”  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 36:251. \n16.  The office of the Secretary of the Department was instituted pursuant to La. Rev. \nStat. Ann. § 36:253, which provides that “[t]he secretary shall serve as the executive head and \nchief  administrative  officer  of  the  Department  of  Health  and  Hospitals  and  shall  have  the \nresponsibility for the policies of the department, except as otherwise provided by this Title, and \nfor the administration, control, and operation of the functions, programs, and affairs of the \ndepartment; provided that the secretary shall perform his functions under the general control and \nsupervision of the governor.”  The Secretary of the Department has the authority to “[p]erform \nthe functions of the state relating to [l]icensing of health facilities, including hospitals and \nnursing homes . . . .”  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 36:254[A](10)(b). \n2.  The Outpatient Abortion Facility Licensing Law \n17.  In 2001, the State of Louisiana enacted the Outpatient Abortion Facility Licensing \nLaw, Acts 2001, No. 391, codified at La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 40:2175.1 through 40:2175.6.  On \nJune 13, 2001, the Governor of the State of Louisiana approved the law.  Prior to that date, there \nwere no specific licensing requirements applicable to outpatient abortion facilities in the State of \nLouisiana.   \n  4   \nCase 3:10-cv-00783-JJB -CN   Document 1     11/17/10   Page 4 of 28\nny-940912  \n\n18.  The Outpatient Abortion Facility Licensing Law authorized the Department to \npromulgate and publish rules and regulations to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of \nwomen in outpatient abortion facilities and for the safe operation of such facilities.  La. Rev. \nStat. Ann. § 40:2175.2.  The Outpatient Abortion Facility Licensing Law specifically provided \nthat those rules “shall be reasonably related to the purpose expressed in this Section and shall not \nimpose a legally significant burden on a woman’s freedom to decide whether to terminate her \npregnancy.”  Id.  \n19.  Although enacted in mid-2001, the Outpatient Abortion Facility Licensing Law \nspecifically provided that “[n]o outpatient abortion facility shall be required to obtain a license \nunder  this  Part  until  the  initial  rules,  regulations,  and  licensing  standards  are  adopted  and \npromulgated in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act.”  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § \n40:2175.5.  Thus, the actual licensing of outpatient abortion facilities would not take place until \nafter the Department promulgated rules governing those facilities. \n20.  Following  the  promulgation  of  those  rules  by  the  Department,  the  Outpatient \nAbortion Facility Licensing Law set forth a procedure for the initial licensing and the re-\nlicensing of outpatient abortion facilities.  Specifically, each facility seeking an initial license \nwould submit an application and a licensing fee.  The law required that the Department “perform \nan on-site inspection of the outpatient abortion facility prior to issuance of the initial license.”  \nLa. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 40:2175.6[C].  The law directed the Department to “issue a license if, after \nan  on-site  inspection,  it  finds  that  the  outpatient  abortion  facility  meets  the  requirements \nestablished under [the Outpatient Abortion Facility Licensing Law] and the licensing standards \nadopted in pursuance thereof.”  Id.   \n  5   \nCase 3:10-cv-00783-JJB -CN   Document 1     11/17/10   Page 5 of 28\nny-940912  \n\n21.  The law provides that a “license issued to an outpatient abortion facility shall be \nvalid for one year from the date of issuance, unless revoked prior to that date.”  La. Rev. Stat. \nAnn. § 40:2175.4[C].  Thus, each outpatient abortion facility that received an initial license had \nto reapply for renewal of its license each year.  The law provides that upon receipt of the annual \nrenewal application and the annual renewal licensing fee, the Department is to “determine if the \noutpatient abortion facility continues to meet the requirements established under [the Outpatient \nAbortion Facility Licensing Law] and the licensing standards adopted in pursuance thereof.”  \nLa. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 40:2175.6[D].  The law gives the Department the right to “perform an on-\nsite inspection upon annual renewal” and provides that “[i]f the outpatient abortion facility \ncontinues to meet the requirements established under [the Outpatient Abortion Facility Licensing \nLaw] and the licensing standards adopted in pursuance thereof, a license shall be issued which is \nvalid for one year.”  Id. \n22.  For those facilities that were in operation but not yet in compliance with the newly \npromulgated regulations, the law provided for the issuance of a six-month provisional license.  \nLa. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 40:2175.6[E].  The law provided that the “deficiencies which preclude the \noutpatient  abortion  facility  from  being  in  full  compliance  must  be  cited  at  the  time  the \nprovisional license is issued.”  Id.  Thus, during the initial licensing period, if an outpatient \nabortion facility did not meet the requirements promulgated by the Department, the facility \nwould be given notice of those deficiencies and an opportunity to bring itself into compliance.   \n23.  Once the initial license was issued, the law further provided a procedure for the \nsuspension or revocation of a license, and appeal from such a decision.  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § \n40:2175.6[G].  The law provided that the procedure for such actions “shall be the same as \nprovided for the licensing of hospitals as contained in R.S. 40:2110.”  The statute applicable to \n  6   \nCase 3:10-cv-00783-JJB -CN   Document 1     11/17/10   Page 6 of 28\nny-940912  \n\nhospitals, and incorporated by reference as applicable to outpatient abortion facilities, states that \nthe Department “may deny, suspend or revoke a license in any case in which [the Secretary] \nfinds that there has been a substantial failure of the applicant or licensee to comply with the \nrequirements  of  this  Part  or  the  rules,  regulations  and  minimum  standards  adopted  by  the \n[Department].”  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 40:2110[A] (emphasis added). That statute provides \ncertain fundamental protections.   \n24.  First, the statute requires that any action by the Department to deny, suspend or \nrevoke a license will be based only upon a finding of a “substantial failure” to comply.  Id.  Thus, \nthe statute includes a threshold as to the nature and degree of non-compliance that can justify the \ndenial, suspension or revocation of a license. \n25.  Second, such a substantial failure to comply can lead to a denial, suspension, or \nrevocation only if the failure to comply is in connection with the Hospital Licensing Law (in the \ncase of hospitals) or in connection with the rules, regulations, and minimum standards adopted \nby the Department.  Id.  Thus, the statute clearly defines the universe of laws or regulations for \nwhich the substantial failure to comply could give rise to the suspension or revocation of a \nlicense. \n26.  Third, the statute gives a licensee the right to appeal suspensively from the action to \nan impartial three member board.  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 40:2110[B], 40:2009.7[C].  Thus, the \naction of the Department is suspended during the pendency of any appeal so that the decision \nmay be carefully reviewed by the impartial three member board. \n27.   Fourth, the statute gives a licensee the right to appeal suspensively from the \ndecision of the impartial three member board to the district court for the parish of East Baton \nRouge, which will review the appeal de novo.  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 40:2110[C]. \n  7   \nCase 3:10-cv-00783-JJB -CN   Document 1     11/17/10   Page 7 of 28\nny-940912  \n\n28.  Of course, the statute does not prevent the Department from taking emergency \naction where the safety and welfare of the public is truly in immediate or imminent danger.  \nUnder the Louisiana Administrative Procedure Act, if the Department finds “that public health, \nsafety, or welfare imperatively requires emergency action, and incorporates a finding to that \neffect in its order” the Department has the right to order “summary suspension of a license . . . \npending proceedings for revocation or other action.”  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 49:961.  Although the \nDepartment has long had the right to order such summary suspension of a license, it could do so \nonly if “prior to the institution of any agency proceedings” it provided “notice by mail to the \nlicensee of facts or conduct which warrant the intended action, and the licensee [received] an \nopportunity to show compliance with all lawful requirements for the retention of the license.”  \nId. \n3.  The Health Care Facilities and Licensing Enforcement Law \n29.  The same act that enacted the Outpatient Abortion Facility Licensing Law also \namended  the  statute  regarding  health  care  facilities  and  licensing  enforcement  so  that  the \nenforcement statute would apply to outpatient abortion facilities.  Acts 2001, No. 391, effective \nAugust 15, 2001 (amending La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 40:2199[A].)   \n30.  The enforcement statute applies broadly to all types of health care providers and \nmedical facilities licensed or certified by the Department, including but not limited to an “adult \nday health care facility, substance abuse/addiction treatment facility, ambulatory surgery center, \ncase management facility, urine drug screening facility, mobile cholesterol screening facility, end \nstage renal disease facility, supplier of portable X-ray services, home health agency, hospice, \nhospital, ICF/DD facility, [or an] outpatient abortion facility.”  Id. \n31.  The enforcement statute specifically provides procedures that will apply prior to \nthe assessment of fines for failure to comply with Department regulations.  Recognizing the \n  8   \nCase 3:10-cv-00783-JJB -CN   Document 1     11/17/10   Page 8 of 28\nny-940912  \n\nfundamental right to have an opportunity to receive notice of any deficiencies and an opportunity \nto correct the deficiency, the statute specifically defines a violation to occur where, “[a]s a result \nof a licensure or certification survey, [the facility] is determined by an agency to be in violation \nof one or more conditions of licensure or certification and has failed to correct such conditions of \nviolation  within  the  time  prescribed  by  law  or  by  the  agency.”    La.  Rev.  Stat.  Ann.  § \n40:2199[A](3)(a) (emphasis added). \n32.  The statute sets forth a schedule of civil fines by class of violation ranging in \ndescending order of seriousness from Class A violations, which are “[v]iolations that create a \ncondition or occurrence relating to the operation and maintenance of a facility, which result in \ndeath or serious harm to a resident or client,” La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 40:2199[B](2)(a), to Class E \nviolations which are “[v]iolations for failure of a facility to submit a statistical or financial report \nin a timely manner as required by regulation,” La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 40:2199[B](2)(e).   \n33.  Lying on the continuum of seriousness in between Class A and Class E violations \nare Class C violations, which are “[v]iolations that create a condition or occurrence relating to \nthe  operation  and  maintenance  of  a  facility  which  create  a  potential  for  harm  by  directly \nthreatening the health, safety, rights, or welfare of a resident or client.”  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § \n40:2199[B](2)(c).  Class C violations are punishable by fines that “shall not exceed one thousand \ndollars for the first violation and shall not exceed two thousand dollars per day for repeat \nviolations.”  Id.  Again, the statute recognizes a facility’s right to cure Class C violations and \nthereby cut off the accrual of civil fines for each day that the condition is not remedied.   \n34.  With respect to outpatient abortion facilities, the Department has recently taken the \nposition—in connection with Hope Medical Group for Women (“Hope Medical”), which is not a \nparty to this action—that a Class C violation is grounds for permanent revocation of a facility’s \n  9   \nCase 3:10-cv-00783-JJB -CN   Document 1     11/17/10   Page 9 of 28\nny-940912  \n\nlicense and, as part of its Zero Tolerance Policy, that the facility is not entitled to an opportunity \nto cure the alleged deficiency.  Upon information and belief, the Department has never taken the \nposition with respect to any other type of licensed medical facility regulated by the Department \nthat a Class C violation provides grounds for permanent revocation or immediate suspension \nwithout providing an opportunity to cure. \n4.  The Department Rules Governing Outpatient Abortion Facilities \n35.  In mid-2003, almost two years after the enactment of the Outpatient Abortion \nFacility Licensing Law, the Department promulgated regulations governing outpatient abortion \nfacilities.  See La. Admin. Code §§ 48:I.4401 through 48:I.4423, Promulgated by the Department \nof Health and Hospitals, Office of the Secretary, Bureau of Health Services Financing, L.R. § \n29:705 (May 2003).  Since their promulgation by the Department under the Administrative \nProcedure Act, these rules as written and published in the administrative code have not changed. \n36.  For the first time, in accordance with the Outpatient Abortion Facility Licensing \nLaw, outpatient abortion facilities were then required to submit applications for an initial license \nto  operate  and  go  through  the  licensing  process  set  forth  in  the  statute.    The  Department \nregulations set forth procedures for the initial licensing process.  La. Admin. Code § 48:I.4403.  \n37.  After  the  initial  license  had  been  granted,  the  Department  regulations  further \nprovide that “[o]n-site inspections may be performed to investigate complaints in accordance \nwith R.S. 40:2009.13-2009.20 and perform follow-up surveys as deemed necessary to ensure \ncompliance with these licensing standards.”  Id.  Thus, outpatient abortion facilities could expect \nroutine inspections following the initial on-site inspection process. \n38.  Since mid-2003, the licensed outpatient abortion facilities in Louisiana have been \ngoverned by the regulations promulgated by the Department to apply to the operations of such \nfacilities, including annual licensing provisions, on-site inspections, and until recently, the right \n  10   \nCase 3:10-cv-00783-JJB -CN   Document 1     11/17/10   Page 10 of 28\nny-940912  \n\nto cure any deficiencies identified during those on-site inspections to bring themselves into full \ncompliance. \nB.  The 2010 Amendments to the Outpatient Abortion Facility Licensing Law \n39.  On June 22, 2010, the State of Louisiana enacted Act No. 490, which amended and \nrevised section 2175.6 of the Outpatient Abortion Facilities Licensing Law to remove the earlier \nstatutory provision subjecting outpatient abortion facilities to the same standards as hospitals for \nlicense denial, revocation or suspension. \n40.  As amended, the statute states that “the secretary of the department may deny a \nlicense, may refuse to renew a license, or may revoke an existing license, if an investigation or \nsurvey  determines  that  the  application  or  licensee  is  in  violation  of  any  provision”  of  the \nregulations governing outpatient abortion facilities, “or in violation of any other federal or state \nlaw or regulation.”  Thus, unlike La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 40:2110[A] applicable to hospitals, which \nrequires “a substantial failure of the applicant or licensee to comply” with specific statutory and \nregulatory provisions, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 40:2175.6[G] applicable to outpatient abortion \nfacilities dispenses with the “substantial failure” requirement.  On its face, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § \n40:2175.6[G]  provides  that  any  failure  to  comply  with  the  Outpatient  Abortion  Facilities \nLicensing Law or the Department regulations promulgated thereunder, regardless of the severity \nor nature of the failure to comply or the duration of noncompliance, will provide a basis for \npermanent revocation of the facility’s license.  For instance, with respect to patient records, the \nDepartment regulations require that “[s]afeguards shall be established to maintain confidentiality \nand protection from fire, water, or other sources of damage,” La. Admin. Code § 48:I.4415, such \nthat, on the face of the statute, an outpatient abortion facility that did not have its patient records \nin sufficiently watertight containers could, at the discretion of the Secretary of the Department, \nhave its license permanently revoked. \n  11   \nCase 3:10-cv-00783-JJB -CN   Document 1     11/17/10   Page 11 of 28\nny-940912  \n\n41.  As  amended,  the  statute  goes  further.    On  its  face,  the  statute  authorizes  the \nDepartment  to  revoke  a  facility’s  license  for  a  violation  of  any  “federal  or  state  law  or \nregulation,” which by its own terms could include any of the myriad federal or state laws or \nregulations.  See, e.g., La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 23:15. Posting of labor laws (“Every employer shall \nkeep conspicuously posted in or about the premises wherein any worker is employed, a printed \ncopy or abstract of those labor laws which the executive director may designate, in a form to be \nfurnished by the executive director.”); U.S.C. § 6655. Failure by corporation to pay estimated \nincome tax (imposing penalties for late payment of corporate income taxes).  The potentially \napplicable state or federal laws or regulations are practically innumerable.  On the face of the \nstatute, a violation of any one of those laws or regulations provides grounds for the Department \nto revoke permanently the license of an outpatient abortion facility in Louisiana. \n42.  As amended, the statute also permits the Department to immediately suspend a \nfacility’s license if the Secretary “determines that the applicant is in violation of any provision \nof” the regulations governing outpatient abortion facilities or any other federal or state law or \nregulation if the Department, in the Secretary’s discretion, also determines “that the violation or \nviolations pose an imminent or immediate threat to the health, welfare or safety of a client or \npatient.”  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 40:2175.6[H].  While the Department has long had the authority \nto act to suspend a license where the Secretary found “that public health, safety, or welfare \nimperatively require[d] emergency action, and incorporate[d] a finding to that effect in its order,” \nit could do so only if “prior to the institution of any agency proceedings” it provided “notice by \nmail to the licensee of facts or conduct which warrant the intended action, and the licensee is \ngiven an opportunity to show compliance with all lawful requirements for the retention of the \nlicense.”  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 49:961.  Under the statute as amended and applied by the \n  12   \nCase 3:10-cv-00783-JJB -CN   Document 1     11/17/10   Page 12 of 28\nny-940912  \n\nDepartment as part of its Zero Tolerance Policy, an outpatient abortion facility could be shut \ndown and kept shut down during the pendency of the appeal for any violation that the Secretary \ndeems to pose an imminent or immediate threat even if the threat has been removed.  By way of \nexample, if an outpatient abortion facility installed a non-compliant boiler, it could be deprived \nof its license for months while the appeal process continued thereby forcing it into bankruptcy, \neven if the boiler were immediately removed to remedy any allegedly dangerous condition.  See \nLa. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 23:539[A] Installation of boilers (“No boiler shall be installed after six \nmonths from the date upon which the rules and regulations formulated by the assistant secretary \ngoverning new installations shall have become effective, unless the boiler conforms to such rules \nand regulations.”). \n43.  Furthermore, in the case of an immediate suspension, the statute, as amended, is \ndesigned to insulate the Department from review of its decision, and in practice as part of its \nZero Tolerance Policy, the Department no longer permits outpatient abortion facilities “to show \ncompliance with all lawful requirements for the retention of the license.”  See La. Rev. Stat. § \n49:961.    First,  the  statute  now  provides  that  any  administrative  appeal  of  an  immediate \nsuspension decision gives the right solely to a devolutive appeal with the Secretary of the \nDepartment.  Unlike a hospital and some other licensed medical facilities, an outpatient abortion \nfacility no longer has the right to a suspensive appeal.  Thus, if the outpatient abortion facility \nfiles an administrative appeal, it will still be deprived of its license, cannot operate, and cannot \ngenerate revenue to avoid bankruptcy during the pendency of the appeal.  Second, the statute \nseeks to sharply limit the scope of any judicial review of such immediate suspension decisions.  \nThe outpatient abortion facility can file for injunctive relief from the immediate suspension with \nthe district court for the parish of East Baton Rouge, but at least on its face, the statute provides \n  13   \nCase 3:10-cv-00783-JJB -CN   Document 1     11/17/10   Page 13 of 28\nny-940912  \n\nthat injunctive relief can be granted only upon a showing by “clear and convincing evidence that \nthe secretary’s decision to issue the immediate suspension of the license was arbitrary and \ncapricious.”  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 40:2175.6[H]. \n44.  Finally, as amended, the statute provides that if a license is finally revoked or \n“renewal of a license is denied other than for cessation of business or non-operational status, or if \nthe license is surrendered in lieu of an adverse action, any owner, officer, member, manager, \ndirector or administrator of the licensee may be prohibited from owning, managing, directing or \noperating another outpatient clinic in the state of Louisiana.”  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 40:2175.6[I]. \nThus, for a broad class of persons associated with an outpatient abortion facility, the revocation \nof a license could in the Secretary’s discretion result in a lifetime ban. \nC.  The Statutory and Regulatory Licensing Provisions Governing Other \nMedical Facilities \n45.  In addition to outpatient abortion facilities, the Department regulates a wide variety \nof medical facilities through statutory and regulatory provisions, including but not limited to:  \n(1) Abuse/Addiction Treatment Facilities, La. Admin. Code §§ 48:I.7401 through \n48:I.7455;   \n(2) Adult Brain Injury Facilities, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 40:2120.31 through \n40:2120.40;  \n(3) Adult Day Health Care Providers, La. Rev. Stat.

Stat.  Ann.  §§  40:2116.31  through \n40:2116.40; La. Admin. Code §§ 48:I.9101 through 48:I.9131;  \n(11) Hospices, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 40:2181 through 40:2191; La. Admin. Code \n§§ 48:I.8201 through 48:I.8257;  \n(12) Hospitals, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 40:2101 through 40:2115; La. Admin. \nCode §§ 48:I.6701 through 48:I.6755;  \n(13) Intermediate Care Facilities for Persons with Developmental Disabilities, La. \nRev. Stat. Ann. §§ 40:2180 through 40:2180.5;  \n(14) Nursing Homes; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 40:2009.1 through 40:2009.19; La. \nAdmin. Code §§ 48:I.9701 through 48:I.9749; \n(15)  Pain  Management  Clinics,  La.  Rev.  Stat.  Ann.  §§  40:2198.11  through \n40:2198.13; La. Admin. Code §§ 48:I.7801 through 48:I.7861;  \n(16) Pediatric Day Health Care Facilities, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 40:2193 through \n40:2193.4; La. Admin. Code §§ 48:I.5201 through 48:I.5285;  \n(17) Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities, La. Admin. Code §§ 48:I.9001 \nthrough 48:I.9085;   \n(18) Respite  Care  Service  Providers,  La.  Admin.  Code  §§  48:I.8101  through \n48:I.8167. \n(19) Rural Health Clinics, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 40:2195 through 40:2197; La. \nAdmin. Code §§ 48:I.7501 through 48:I.7535; and \n(20) Trauma Centers, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 40:2171 through 40:2173.  \n \n46.  Among all of the types of medical facilities regulated by the Department, the State \nof Louisiana has singled out outpatient abortion facilities for treatment that no other similarly \nsituated regulated medical facility receives.   \n  15   \nCase 3:10-cv-00783-JJB -CN   Document 1     11/17/10   Page 15 of 28\nny-940912  \n\n47.  Under the applicable statutes and regulations, none of these other types of medical \nfacilities can lawfully have their license revoked or immediately suspended by the Department \nfor a violation of any “federal or state law or regulation,” without some required showing of a \nsubstantial failure to comply, and upon information and belief, without some opportunity in \npractice to bring themselves into compliance. \n48.  Under the applicable statutes and regulations, none of these medical facilities are \nrequired to prove by “clear and convincing evidence that the secretary’s decision to issue the \nimmediate suspension of the license was arbitrary and capricious” to obtain injunctive relief \nfrom an immediate suspension order.  The standard is designed to preclude meaningful judicial \nreview that would otherwise be available to all other licensed medical facilities. \n49.  In fact, at a hearing before the Louisiana House Health & Welfare Committee, \nwhich was held on April 29, 2010, to discuss Act 490, Steve Rousseau, Department Executive \nCounsel, conceded that no other statute or regulation under Louisiana law requires a showing by \nclear and convincing evidence that an agency acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner to \nobtain injunctive relief from a court.   \n50.  Upon information and belief, despite numerous violations—even deaths—at other \nlicensed medical facilities, the only instance in which the Department has ever acted on an \nimmediate basis to suspend the license of a medical facility occurred recently with respect to an \noutpatient  abortion  facility,  namely  Hope  Medical,  on  September  3,  2010.    Also  upon \ninformation and belief, although the Department has revoked the licenses of medical facilities \nother  than  outpatient  abortion  facilities,  these  revocations  came  only  after  deaths  at  these \nfacilities  or  repeated  and  egregious  violations  that  went  uncorrected  after  notice  from  the \nDepartment.   \n  16   \nCase 3:10-cv-00783-JJB -CN   Document 1     11/17/10   Page 16 of 28\nny-940912  \n\n51.  Finally, under the statutes and regulations applicable to other medical facilities, the \nDepartment  does  not  have  the  authority  to  indefinitely  prohibit  owners,  officers,  members, \nmanagers, directors or administers of the facility from owning, managing, directing or operating \nanother facility in the State of Louisiana should that facility’s license be revoked. \n52.  In enacting Act 490, the State of Louisiana did not identify any aspect of the \nprocedures  performed  at  outpatient  abortion  facilities  that  distinguishes  them  from  those \nprocedures performed at the numerous other medical facilities regulated by the Department, \nwhich  would  therefore  make  it  appropriate  for  outpatient  abortion  facilities  to  receive  the \nuniquely  burdensome  legislative  treatment  set  forth  in  Act  490.    In  fact,  the  procedures \ncommonly  performed  at  outpatient  abortion  facilities  are  on  the  low  end  of  the  scale  of \ncomplexity,  risk,  and  invasiveness  when  compared  to  the  range  of  procedures  regularly \nperformed at many of the other medical facilities in the State of Louisiana. \nD.  Licensed Outpatient Abortion Facilities in Louisiana \n53.  Upon information and belief, there are a total of seven licensed outpatient abortion \nfacilities  in  Louisiana.    Bossier  City  Medical,  Causeway  Medical,  Delta  Clinic,  Midtown \nMedical, and Women’s Health Care Center (collectively, the “Abortion Facility Plaintiffs”) \ncomprise five of those.  The other two are currently subject to license revocation proceedings \ninitiated by the Department. \n54.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Gentilly  Medical  Clinic  for  Women  (“Gentilly \nMedical”), which is not a party to this action, is currently involved in an administrative appeal of \na revocation of its license by the Department.  Hope Medical, which is likewise not a party to \nthis action, is currently appealing the Department’s immediate suspension of its license before \nthe District Court of East Baton Rouge.  See Hope Medical Group for Women v. Keck, No. \n  17   \nCase 3:10-cv-00783-JJB -CN   Document 1     11/17/10   Page 17 of 28\nny-940912  \n\n594653 (La. 19th Judicial Dist. Sept. 14, 2010) (granting temporary restraining order to permit \nHope Medical to continue operations). \n55.  Bossier City Medical has been providing abortion services for over 30 years.  It has \nbeen licensed by the Department continuously since 2004. \n56.  Causeway Medical has been providing abortion services for over 10 years.  It has \nbeen licensed by the Department continuously since 2004. \n57.  Delta Clinic has been providing abortion services for over 30 years.  It has been \nlicensed by the Department continuously since 2004. \n58.  Midtown Medical has been providing abortion services for over 7 years.  It has \nbeen licensed by the Department continuously since 2004.   \n59.  Women’s Health Care Center began providing abortion services in or about 1996.  \nFollowing Hurricane Katrina, the clinic was closed for repairs from August 2005 to December \n2008.  It has been licensed by the Department continuously since 2004, but its license was \ninactive during the period when the clinic was closed.   \n60.  Of the seven licensed outpatient abortion facilities in the State of Louisiana, four \nare in or around the Greater New Orleans Metropolitan Area – Plaintiff Causeway Medical \n(Metairie), Plaintiff Women’s Health Care Center (New Orleans), Plaintiff Midtown Medical \n(New Orleans), and Non-Party Gentilly Medical (New Orleans) – one is in the Baton Rouge \nMetropolitan Area – Plaintiff Delta Clinic (Baton Rouge) – and two are in the Shreveport-\nBossier City Metropolitan Area – Plaintiff Bossier City Medical (Bossier City) and Non-Party \nHope Medical (Shreveport).   \n  18   \nCase 3:10-cv-00783-JJB -CN   Document 1     11/17/10   Page 18 of 28\nny-940912  \n\n61.  These seven facilities are currently the only outpatient abortion facilities serving \nthe 4,492,076 residents of the State of Louisiana, estimated as of July 1, 2009, by the United \nStates Census Bureau. \nE.  Changes in the Department’s Practices Following the Enactment of Act 490 \n62.  Prior to the recent passage of Act 490, the Department’s practices with respect to \ninspecting outpatient abortion facilities were as follows: \na.  The  Department  conducted  unannounced  inspections  of  outpatient  abortion \nfacilities on a periodic basis. \nb.  If,  during  an  inspection,  an  inspector  discovered  a  practice,  procedure,  or \ncondition that the inspector believed to violate a provision of law, the inspector \nwould give the facility verbal notice of that finding at the end of the inspection. \nc.  In addition, following such an inspection, the Department would give the facility \nwritten notice of the finding via a written Statement of Deficiencies. \nd.  The Statement of Deficiencies sent to an outpatient abortion facility would be \naccompanied by a letter giving the facility an opportunity to submit a Plan of \nCorrection within a designated period of time (usually about ten days). \ne.  If a facility submitted an unacceptable Plan of Correction, the Department would \nsend  the  Plan  of  Correction  back  to  the  facility  with  a  letter  explaining  the \ninadequacies in the plan. \nf.  The facility would then be given a brief, additional period of time in which to \nsubmit a revised Plan of Correction. \ng.  If an outpatient abortion facility submitted an acceptable Plan of Correction to the \nDepartment within the designated time frame, the Department would take no \nfurther action against the facility’s license on the basis of the cited deficiencies. \n  19   \nCase 3:10-cv-00783-JJB -CN   Document 1     11/17/10   Page 19 of 28\nny-940912  \n\nh.  If,  during  an  inspection,  an  inspector  discovered  a  practice,  procedure,  or \ncondition that the inspector believed to both violate a provision of law and create \nan immediate threat of harm to patients, the inspector would give the facility a \nNotification of Determination of Immediate Jeopardy (“IJ”). \ni.  When the Department gave a facility an IJ, the facility was instructed to begin \ntaking corrective action immediately and to submit a Plan of Correction while the \ninspector was still at the facility. \nj.  Following such an inspection, the Department would give the facility written \nnotice of the deficiencies found, including those underlying the IJ, via a Statement \nof Deficiencies. \nk.  Such a Statement of Deficiencies would be accompanied by a letter giving the \nfacility  time  to  submit  a  Plan  of  Correction,  and  if  an  acceptable  Plan  of \nCorrection was submitted to the Department within the designated time frame, the \nDepartment would take no action to revoke or suspend the facility’s license on the \nbasis of the cited deficiencies. \n63.  Following the passage of Act 490, the Department conducted an inspection of an \noutpatient abortion facility, namely Hope Medical, which reflected the following departmental \npractices: \na.  During  the  inspection,  the  inspector  discovered  practices,  procedures,  or \nconditions that the inspector alleged both to violate provisions of law and to \ncreate an immediate threat of harm to patients, and the inspector gave the facility \nan IJ. \n  20   \nCase 3:10-cv-00783-JJB -CN   Document 1     11/17/10   Page 20 of 28\nny-940912  \n\nb.  Although the facility immediately submitted a Plan of Correction upon receipt of \nthe IJ, and immediately changed its practices in accordance with the Plan of \nCorrection, and although the Plan of Correction was accepted by the Department, \nthe facility was neither sent a Statement of Deficiencies after the inspection nor \ngiven an Opportunity to submit any further Plan of Correction. \nc.  Instead, approximately three weeks after the inspection, the Department issued an \nimmediate  suspension  of  the  facility’s  license  and  initiated  proceedings  to \npermanently revoke the facility’s license.  Both the suspension and revocation \nnotices expressly stated that the Department would not consider any corrective \nactions taken by the abortion facility during or after the date of the inspection. \nd.  At  the  same  time,  the  Secretary  issued  a  press  release  announcing  the \nDepartment’s actions against the facility and explaining that the Department was \nacting pursuant to its new powers under Act 490. \n64.  Based on the Department’s recent actions, Plaintiffs reasonably believe that the \nDepartment has adopted a new practice since passage of Act 490 with respect to inspecting \noutpatient abortion facilities.  Pursuant to its new Zero Tolerance Policy, the Department no \nlonger provides abortion facilities notice of alleged deficiencies and an opportunity to correct \nthem before taking action to suspend or revoke a facility license.  \n65.  Each of the Abortion Facility Plaintiffs reasonably fears that when the Department \nnext inspects it, the Department will initiate action to suspend or revoke its license without first \ngiving it an opportunity to respond to or correct any alleged deficiencies. \n  21   \nCase 3:10-cv-00783-JJB -CN   Document 1     11/17/10   Page 21 of 28\nny-940912  \n\nF.  Impact of the Department’s Enforcement Practices Following Enactment of \nAct 490 \n66.  When the Department inspects outpatient abortion facilities, it issues deficiencies \nnot  only  for  violations  of  the  applicable  licensing  statutes  and  outpatient  abortion  facility \nregulations, but also for failing to have policies and procedures that ensure compliance with \nwholly separate statutes (such as provisions of the Louisiana Children’s Code) and alleged \nstandards of care. \n67.  When the Department cites an outpatient abortion facility for a deficiency, it often \ndoes so on the basis of conduct, policies, or practices that have been in place at that facility for \nyears, and that have been subject to prior Department inspections without eliciting any comment \nfrom the Department. \n68.  In citing outpatient abortion facilities for deficiencies, the Department often applies \nstatutes and regulations in inconsistent ways. \n69.  Because the Department issues deficiencies based on requirements not set forth in \nthe applicable licensing statutes and outpatient abortion facility regulations, and because the \nDepartment  applies  statutes  and  regulations  inconsistently,  the  Abortion  Facility  Plaintiffs \nfrequently lack notice that conduct alleged by the Department to constitute a deficiency violates \ntheir conditions of licensure. \n70.  The Department’s practice of citing of deficiencies based on requirements not set \nforth in the applicable licensing statutes and outpatient abortion facility regulations, and the \nDepartment’s inconsistent application of statutes and regulations, subject the Abortion Facility \nPlaintiffs to arbitrary enforcement. \n71.  The harms imposed on Plaintiffs by the foregoing lack of notice and arbitrary \nenforcement are greatly increased by Act 490 and the Zero Tolerance Policy because alleged \n  22   \nCase 3:10-cv-00783-JJB -CN   Document 1     11/17/10   Page 22 of 28\nny-940912  \n\ndeficiencies at the Abortion Facility Plaintiffs’ facilities no longer simply necessitate a change in \npractices  or  procedures  and  a  Plan  of  Correction;  they  now  expose  the  Abortion  Facility \nPlaintiffs to the possibility of immediate suspension and/or or permanent revocation of their \nlicenses without any opportunity to correct the alleged deficiency. \n72.  Enforcement of Act 490 and the Zero Tolerance Policy makes it likely that the \nDepartment will suspend or revoke many or all of the Abortion Facility Plaintiffs’ licenses in the \nforeseeable future. \n73.  The purpose of Act 490 and the Zero Tolerance Policy is to close down outpatient \nabortion facilities regardless of whether those facilities are operating safely.  \n74.  The suspension and/or revocation of some or all of the Abortion Facility Plaintiffs’ \nlicenses would significantly impede the ability of Dr. Doe’s patients to obtain professional \nabortion services.   \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Vagueness) \n \n75.  The allegations of paragraphs 1 through 74 are incorporated as though fully set \nforth herein. \n76.  Act  490  is  unconstitutional  under  the  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution because it fails to give the Abortion Facility Plaintiffs fair \nnotice of the conditions of licensure for outpatient abortion facilities and encourages arbitrary \nand discriminatory enforcement. \n77.  The Zero Tolerance Policy practiced by the Department is unconstitutional under \nthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution because it fails to \ngive the Abortion Facility Plaintiffs fair notice of the conditions of licensure for outpatient \nabortion facilities and encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. \n  23   \nCase 3:10-cv-00783-JJB -CN   Document 1     11/17/10   Page 23 of 28\nny-940912  \n\nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Equal Protection) \n \n78.  The allegations of paragraphs 1 through 74 are incorporated as though fully set \nforth herein. \n79.  Act 490 violates the rights of the Abortion Facility Plaintiffs under the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution by treating outpatient \nabortion  facilities  differently  than  all  other  medical  facilities  regulated  by  the  Department \nwithout any basis for the differential treatment other than animus toward abortion providers.   \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Substantive Due Process—Irrational Government Action) \n \n80.  The allegations of paragraphs 1 through 74 are incorporated as though fully set \nforth herein. \n81.  Act 490 violates the rights of the Abortion Facility Plaintiffs to substantive due \nprocess under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution because it deprives them of \nliberty and property interests in an arbitrary, unreasonable, and capricious manner, and invests an \nimpermissible degree of subjective discretion in the Secretary by authorizing the Secretary to \nsuspend or revoke an outpatient abortion facility’s license based on any violation of any federal \nor state law or regulation, authorizing the Secretary to ban an individual for life from owning, \nmanaging, directing, or operating an outpatient abortion facility, and sharply curtailing the scope \nof judicial review of the Secretary’s actions. \n82.  The Zero Tolerance Policy violates the right of the Abortion Facility Plaintiffs to \nsubstantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution because it \ndeprives them of liberty and property interests in an arbitrary, unreasonable and capricious \nmanner. \n  24   \nCase 3:10-cv-00783-JJB -CN   Document 1     11/17/10   Page 24 of 28\nny-940912  \n\nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Substantive Due Process—Right to Terminate a Pregnancy) \n \n83.  The allegations of paragraphs 1 through 74 are incorporated as though fully set \nforth herein. \n84.  Act 490 has both the purpose and the effect of imposing a substantial obstacle in \nthe path of Dr. Doe’s patients who are seeking to obtain pre-viability abortions.  Therefore, Act \n490  violates  the  fundamental  right  to  terminate  a  pregnancy  guaranteed  by  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution.   \n85.  The Zero Tolerance Policy has both the purpose and the effect of imposing a \nsubstantial obstacle in the path of Dr. Doe’s patients who are seeking to obtain pre-viability \nabortions.  Therefore, the Zero Tolerance Policy violates the fundamental right to terminate a \npregnancy guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \nATTORNEY’S FEES \n86.  Plaintiffs  are  entitled  to  an  award  of  reasonable  attorney’s  fees  and  expenses \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988.  \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \nPlaintiffs respectfully request that this Court: \n1.  Issue a declaratory judgment that:  \na.  Act 490 is unconstitutional and unenforceable as a whole; and/or \nb.  Section G of Act 490 (codified at La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 40:2175.6[G]), which \nauthorizes the Secretary to deny, refuse to renew, or revoke the license of an \noutpatient abortion facility based on any violation of the regulations governing \noutpatient abortion facilities or any violation of any other federal or state law or \nregulation, is unconstitutional and unenforceable; and/or \n  25   \nCase 3:10-cv-00783-JJB -CN   Document 1     11/17/10   Page 25 of 28\nny-940912  \n\nc.  Section H of Act 490 (codified at La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 40:2175.6[H]), which \nauthorizes  the  Secretary  to  immediately  suspend  the  license  of  an  outpatient \nabortion facility without complying with the requirements of La. Rev. Stat. § \n49:961  and  sharply  limits  judicial  review  of  the  Secretary’s  actions,  is \nunconstitutional and unenforceable; and/or \nd.  Section I of Act 490 (codified at La. Rev. Stat.

Majority Opinion 718–19. However, it is well established that this court, like “every federal \n \n\n \nappellate court[,] has a special obligation to ‘satisfy itself of its own jurisdiction.[’]” Bender v. Williamsport Area Sch. \nDistr., 475 U.S. 534, 541, 106 S.Ct. 1326, 89 L.Ed.2d 501 (1986); see New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc. v. City Council of \nNew Orleans, 491 U.S. 350, 358, 109 S.Ct. 2506, 105 L.Ed.2d 298 (1989) (“We have no more right to decline the \nexercise of jurisdiction which is given, than to usurp that which is not given. The one or the other would be treason \nto the Constitution.”) (quoting Cohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. 264, 404, 6 Wheat. 264, 5 L.Ed. 257 (1821)); see also, e.g., \nK.P. v. LeBlanc, 627 F.3d 115, 122 (5th Cir.2010) (raising the issue of Article III standing sua sponte and articulating \nreasons why the plaintiffs had standing to sue). \n \n2  Courts have routinely adjudicated the merits of analogous pre-enforcement constitutional challenges to licensing \n  laws. In Whiting, the Supreme Court reached the merits of a suit in which plaintiffs “filed a preenforcement suit ... \nargu[ing] that [an] Arizona law[ ] ... allowing the suspension and revocation of business licenses for employing \nunauthorized aliens were both expressly and impliedly preempted by federal immigration law,” despite the fact that \n“[n]o suits had been brought under the Arizona law when the complaint ... was filed.” Whiting, 131 S.Ct. at 1977 & \nn. 4. In an equal protection challenge to a state law that allegations that a state licensing scheme discriminates \nbetween similarly-situated entities are “sufficient ... to survive a motion to dismiss” in the context of standing \ndoctrine’s analogous “injury-in-fact requirement.” Time Warner Cable, Inc. v. Hudson, 667 F.3d 630, 636 (5th \nCir.2012). We explained: “Discriminatory treatment at the hands of the government is an injury long recognized as \njudicially cognizable. And such injury is recognizable for standing irrespective of whether the plaintiff will sustain an \nactual or more palpable injury as a result of the unequal treatment under law or regulation. Here, the Act facially \ndiscriminates against the [TCA’s] membership by extending the benefit of a state-wide license to its competitors \nwhile denying that same benefit to incumbent cable providers .... [S]uch discrimination can constitute an injury \nbecause it positions similar parties unequally before the law; no further showing of suffering based on that unequal \npositioning is required for purposes of standing.” Id. Other courts have reached similar results. See, e.g., Friendship \nMed. Ctr., Ltd. v. Chicago Bd. of Health, 505 F.2d 1141, 1145–46 (7th Cir.1974) (holding pre-enforcement challenge \nto registration requirements for abortion providers justiciable where “[t]he regulations ... provided for the closing of \nany abortion service that ... would be in violation of any of the Board of Health’s regulations” and where the \ndefendants “ha[d] the power to deny authorization to those seeking to operate an abortion facility as well as the \npower to order the closing of any facility that it deems not in compliance with its regulations”). \n \n3  As plaintiffs’ counsel noted at oral argument, were a state to condition the licensure of attorneys—or, to more \n  closely track the circumstances this case, of some disfavored category of attorneys—on strict compliance with all \nstate and federal laws, it seems indisputable that such a law would impose on that category of disfavored \npractitioners the hardship of modifying their customary conduct in order to avoid the uniquely severe sanctions \nthat, for example, a speeding ticket would subject them to. \n \n4  The burdens imposed on plaintiffs here are at least as real and immediate as what every member of this court en \n  banc seemingly recognized as having been inflicted on abortion providers by the passage of an earlier Louisiana law \nthat “exposes [abortion] doctors to unlimited tort liability” in private suits, in part by exempting civil suits brought \npursuant  to  that  law  from  the  limitations  on  liability  provided  in  Louisiana’s  generally  applicable  Medical \nMalpractice Act. Okpalobi v. Foster, 244 F.3d 405, 409, 421–22 (5th Cir.2001) (en banc); see also K.P. v. LeBlanc, 627 \nF.3d 115, 119–20 (5th Cir.2010); La.Rev.Stat. Ann. § 9:2800.12. Although the en banc court deemed the suit \nnon-justiciable as having been brought against the wrong defendants, it appears that every member of the court \nagreed that the “self-enforcing nature” of the statute at issue had an “immediate coercive effect” on abortion \nproviders and that this “coercive impact of the statute itself” amounted to an injury-in-fact for purposes of Article III \nstanding. Okpalobi, 244 F.3d at 427 (explaining that the “impact of the statute” is “coercive in that it exposes \n[abortion physicians] to unlimited tort liability”); id. at 435 (Benavides, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) \n(agreeing that “Act 825, by its mere existence, coerces the plaintiffs to abandon the exercise of their legal rights lest \nthey  risk  incurring  substantial  civil  liability”);  id.  at  451  (Parker,  J.,  dissenting)  (agreeing  that  the  plaintiffs \n“undoubtedly established an ‘injury-in-fact’ ”); see also Lopez v. City of Houston, 617 F.3d 336, 342 (5th Cir.2010) \n(explaining that the standing injury-in-fact inquiry and the ripeness hardship inquiry “overlap in practice,” as each \namounts to “an examination of whether a plaintiff has suffered a concrete injury”). \n \n5  The Secretary’s counsel intimates that the Secretary may not ultimately exercise his considerable—and allegedly \n \n\n \n  impermissible—discretion “under Act 490 in the draconian fashion [plaintiffs] fear” by initiating suspension or \nrevocation proceedings against a clinic, or declining to renew its license, for a minor or non-health-related \nregulatory violation. See Appellee’s Br. 20. These assertions do not change the analysis. Even were the Secretary’s \ncounsel to go farther and assure the court that the Secretary would not exercise his authority under the Act in an \narbitrary fashion, such assurances would be irrelevant. In Abbott Labs., the Court rejected the government’s \n“contention that the threat of [certain] sanctions for noncompliance with [the] ... regulation [at issue] is unrealistic,” \nalthough government counsel had asserted that the feared sanction would not be imposed. Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. \nat 154, 87 S.Ct. 1507. Where an “action at its inception [is] properly brought[,] ... subsequent represention[s] of [the \ndefendant’s counsel will] not suffice to defeat it.” Id. \n \n6  Importantly, the Supreme Court has explained that “[o]ne does not have to await the consummation of threatened \n  injury to obtain preventive relief. If the injury is certainly impending, that is enough.” Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric. \nProds. Co., 473 U.S. 568, 580, 105 S.Ct. 3325, 87 L.Ed.2d 409 (1985) (quoting Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, \n419 U.S. 102, 143, 95 S.Ct. 335, 42 L.Ed.2d 320 (1974)); accord, e.g., Neal v. Shimoda, 131 F.3d 818, 825 (9th \nCir.1997). The circumstances surrounding the present case indicate that the Secretary has already subjected several \nabortion clinics in the state to the harsh terms of the new Act, and intends to enforce the Act again the plaintiff \nclinics. Thus, plaintiffs claims would be fit for adjudication even if they did not present purely legal questions. \n \n \n \n \n \n ",
