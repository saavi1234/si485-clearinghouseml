    "summary": "<p>This is a case brought by noncitizen students facing immigration enforcement about the fallout from a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement sting operation. The noncitizens had entered the U.S. on student visas and had enrolled in the University of Northern New Jersey (\"UNNJ\") to maintain their student visa status after graduating from other U.S. universities and beginning work. As it turned out, in April 2016 ICE revealed that the UNNJ was a fake university it created to investigate and prosecute academic brokers who it believed were likely to commit visa fraud. The noncitizens were steered by such brokers to enroll in UNNJ, unaware that it was part of a sting operation. After ICE concluded its sting and shut down UNNJ, it summarily terminated the status of the students enrolled in the school -- more than 1,000 -- and found them to have knowingly participated in visa fraud. ICE then placed many of the students in removal proceedings because of their defective visa status. ICE had undertaken great efforts to make UNNJ appear legitimate, including obtaining accreditation, having DHS approve it for participation in the student visa program, hiring a \"President,\" maintaining office space, and creating active social media accounts on which ICE posted wedding pictures of two of the school's \"alumni.\"</p>\r\n<p>On November 18, 2016, three noncitizens who had enrolled in UNNJ filed this putative class action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\"), the Secretary of the U.S. Department Homeland Security (\"DHS\"), and the Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\"). The plaintiffs alleged that the summary visa terminations and fraud determinations violated their Fifth Amendment right to procedural due process and were arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedures Act (\"APA\"). Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and orders requiring the immigration agencies to provide individualized fraud hearings and entrapment determinations without relying on UNNJ enrollment to indicate fraud.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On December 9, 2016, the plaintiffs amended their complaint; because the amended complaint in this immigration-related action is not available via PACER, we don't know the details.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 29, 2017, District Judge Eric N. Vitaliano transferred the case to the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1404(a)'s voluntary transfer provision. The case was assigned to District Judge Jose L. Linares.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On July 7, 2017, the DHS, ICE, and USCIS officials filed a motion to dismiss.&nbsp;Judge Linares granted that motion and dismissed the complaint without prejudice on October 2, 2017. The court found that the noncitizen plaintiffs had applied to ICE for reinstatement of their visas, so the visa terminations were not final agency actions eligible for review under the APA. Further, the court found that the lack of finality made the noncitizens' claims not ripe for review because ICE proceedings were ongoing. In essence, the district court found that the noncitizens would need their applications for visa reinstatement to be denied for the court to review the determinations under the APA. 2017 WL 6453466.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit; the appeal was heard by Circuit Judges Theodore A. McKee, L. Felipe Restrepo, and Julio M. Fuentes. On August 15, 2019, the Third Circuit reversed the district court's dismissal and remanded the case there for further proceedings. Judge McKee wrote the unanimous panel opinion. The court of appeals held that the termination of the noncitizen students' visas was a final order eligible for review because it \"marked the culmination of the agency's decisionmaking process.\" The conclusion followed from two findings: First, there was \"no statutory or regulatory requirement that a student seeks reinstatement after his or her F-1 visa has been terminated,\" and even if the students elected to apply for reinstatement, those proceedings contained \"no mechanism to review the propriety of the original termination order.\" Second, the finality of the terminations could not \"depend on the institution of removal proceedings which may never occur\" (because they are discretionary enforcement proceedings), and \"in any event, immigration judges cannot review the original denial of reinstatement.\" And because the terminations were final, the controversy was ripe for consideration. 935 F.3d 172.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 18, 2020, the noncitizen students filed a second amended complaint; again we don't have the details because it is not available on PACER. Over the next months, the parties litigated discovery. The second amended complaint however did change the named plaintiff. (Fang is no longer listed)</p>\r\n<p>On April 28, 2021, the parties notified the court of settlement negotiations; the court scheduled meet-and-confers and status update deadlines. In light of negotiations held on August 20, 2021, the court terminated the pending motions to dismiss, noting the officials could renew the motions if the settlement fell apart. On December 19, 2021, the parties filed a joint motion for preliminary class certification and settlement approval.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The court preliminarily approved the settlement and settlement class on January 10, 2022, and scheduled a fairness hearing for May 2, 2022.</p>\r\n<p>Upon notifying the class members and their counsel, the parties agreed to several technical amendments to the original settlement agreement. On April 11, 2022, the parties filed an amended settlement agreement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The settlement would require the government to rescind the student visa termination letters sent out in April 2016; declare that having enrolled at UNNJ was insufficient grounds for inadmissibility or deportation in future adjudications and remove the effect of any prior such assertion; agree that the students not be considered to have accrued unlawful presence/failure to maintain lawful status since the date of their UNNJ enrollments and 180 days from the settlement's effective date; dismiss any removal proceedings based on UNNJ enrollment; require DHS to modify existing SEVIS records to remove references to \"fraud\"; require DHS to adjudicate and, to the extent possible, grant visa reinstatements to former UNNJ students; and set timelines and notice requirements. The parties agreed that the named plaintiffs will receive fees and costs under the Equal&nbsp;Access to Justice Act (&ldquo;EAJA&rdquo;) in an amount equaling $450,000.00.</p>\r\n<p>On May 2, 2022, the parties held their fairness hearing in front of Magistrate Judge Allen. The next day, the Magistrate Judge approved the final settlement and judgment. On June 9, 2022, the case was dismissed with prejudice and the case is now closed.&nbsp;</p>",

    "summary_short": "Immigrations and Customs Enforcement established a fake university, the University of Northern New Jersey, as part of a sting operation against potentially fraudulent student work visa brokers. ICE made UNNJ look real by obtaining accreditation, hiring a \"President,\" and enrolling unsuspecting noncitizen students so they could obtain student visas while working. When ICE dissolved the university in April 2016, it summarily terminated the visas of over 1,000 UNNJ students, began removal proceedings, and determined the noncitizens had engaged in fraud by enrolling in UNNJ. Three noncitizen students sued ICE, DHS, and USCIS, alleging that the visa terminations and related actions violated the Administrative Procedures Act. In October 2017, the district court dismissed the action because the termination decisions were not \"final\" for purposes of the APA; the Third Circuit reversed in August 2019. Eventually the Biden administration settled with the noncitizen students, agreeing to most of the relief the plaintiffs requested in their original complaint.",

Within the period of initial admission or extension of stay, the \nnonimmigrant status of an alien shall be terminated by the revocation of a waiver authorized on his or her behalf \nunder section 212(d)(3) or (4) of the Act; by the introduction of a private bill to confer permanent resident status on \nsuch alien; or, pursuant to notification in the Federal Register, on the basis of national security, diplomatic, or public \nsafety reasons.” 8 C.F.R. § 214.1(d).

JOHNSON, \nin  his  official  capacity  as  Acting  Director,  U.S.  Immigration  and  Customs  Enforcement;  UR \nMENDOZA JADDOU, in her official capacity as Director, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \nServices;  ALEJANDRO  MAYORKAS,  in  his  official  capacity  as  Secretary,  Department  of \nHomeland Security; the UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY; the \nUNITED  STATES  DEPARTMENT  OF  STATE;  the  UNITED  STATES  DEPARTMENT  OF \nEDUCATION; and the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (collectively “Defendants”). Plaintiffs \nand  Defendants  are  collectively  referred  to  as  “the  Parties”  throughout  this  Agreement.  The \nAgreement will become effective upon approval by the Court pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure as set forth below.  \nRECITALS \nWHEREAS: \n1.  The Named Plaintiffs and the Class Members are foreign nationals who enrolled at \nthe University of Northern New Jersey (“UNNJ”); \n2.  UNNJ was a fictitious university created by the U.S. Government;  \n3.  The U.S. Government closed UNNJ on April 5, 2016, and issued notices to certain \nNamed Plaintiffs and Class Members informing them that their Student and Exchange Visitor \nInformation System (“SEVIS”) record and the Form I-20 issued to them by UNNJ were set to \n“Terminated status”  and that, as a result, they no longer had valid F-1 nonimmigrant status; \n4.  Plaintiffs filed a putative class-action lawsuit in the United States District Court for \nthe Eastern District of New York in November 2016, alleging that the termination of the Plaintiffs’ \nstatus violated the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act, \n \n1 \n \n\n \nand that the Defendants should be equitably estopped from using Plaintiffs’ enrollment in UNNJ \nagainst them in future immigration applications;  \n5.  The Action was transferred to the United States District Court for the District of New \nJersey (“the Court”) in April 2017; \n6.  The Court dismissed the Action for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) on October 2, 2017;  \n7.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed and remanded the Action \nfor further proceedings on August 15, 2019, see Fang v. Dir., ICE, 935 F.3d 172 (3d Cir. 2019); \n8.  Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint on March 18, 2020, naming the current \nNamed Plaintiffs and Defendants in the Action;  \n9.  The Parties desire to draw to a close litigation of this Action, which has been pending \nfor roughly five years. \nTERMS \nNOW THEREFORE in recognition that the Parties and the interests of justice are best served by \nconcluding this Action, it is hereby stipulated and agreed by and between the Parties as follows: \nI.  DEFINITIONS \nA.  Action. The term “Action” refers to the civil action captioned Dong v. Johnson, No. \n2:17-cv-02092-ES-JSA (D.N.J). \nB.  A Number. The term “A Number” means alien registration number.  \nC.  Class Definition. The Parties hereby stipulate and agree to certification of a Class \ndefined as follows: any noncitizen who, for any period of time, enrolled in the \nUniversity of Northern New Jersey (“UNNJ”). \n1.  The Parties recognize and agree to this Class Definition strictly for purposes of \nthis Agreement and settlement of this Action. Should this Agreement not receive \nCourt approval, DHS reserves the right to raise any and all defenses to a motion \nfor class certification.  \n2.  As used throughout the Agreement, the terms “class” and “class member” refer \nto and include any individual who qualifies as part of the Class Definition. \nD.  Defendants. The term “Defendants” includes all named Defendants in this Action, \nas specified above.  \nE.  DHS. The term “DHS” means the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and all its \nsub-agencies  and  employees  of  such  agencies,  including  U.S.  Citizenship  and \nImmigration Services (“USCIS”), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”), \nand U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”).  \n \n2 \n \n\n \nF.  DOE. The term “DOE” means the U.S. Department of Education and all its sub-\nagencies and employees of such agencies. \nG. DOS. The term “DOS” means the U.S. Department of State and all its sub-agencies \nand employees of such agencies, including all U.S. consulates and embassies abroad. \nH. Effective Date. The term “Effective Date” refers to the date the Court grants final \napproval of this Agreement and final certification of a settlement class as outlined \nbelow.   \nI.  Immigration Benefits. The term “Immigration Benefits” means benefits under the \nImmigration and Nationality Act (as amended) (“INA”), including, but not limited \nto, the following:  \n1.  Transfer to a new Student and Exchange Visitor Program (“SEVP”) approved \ninstitution with a new valid Form I-20 issued by the new institution;  \n2.  Reinstatement to student status; \n3.  Extension of nonimmigrant status;  \n4.  Change of nonimmigrant status;  \n5.  Adjustment of status; \n6.  Temporary Protected Status;  \n7.  U or T nonimmigrant status;  \n8.  Waivers;   \n9.  Nonimmigrant or immigrant visas; \n10. Employment Authorization Documents; and  \n11. Other forms of relief from removal such as cancellation of removal and voluntary \ndeparture. \nJ.  Named Plaintiffs. The term “Named Plaintiffs” means the seven individuals named \nas plaintiffs in this Action.  \nK. Parties. The term “Parties” includes all Named Plaintiffs, class members, and \nDefendants.  \nL.  Plaintiffs. The term “Plaintiffs” includes all Named Plaintiffs and all class members.  \nM. Plaintiffs’  Counsel.  The  term  “Plaintiffs’  Counsel”  means  the  attorneys \nrepresenting the Named Plaintiffs in this Action:  \nIra J. Kurzban \n \n3 \n \n\n \nEdward F. Ramos \nElizabeth Montano  \nKURZBAN, KURZBAN, TETZELI & PRATT, P.A. \n131 Madeira Ave \nCoral Gables, FL 33134 \nN.  UNNJ. The term “UNNJ” refers to the University of Northern New Jersey.  \nO. April 2016 SEVP Termination Letters. The term “April 2016 SEVP Termination \nLetters” refers to the letters sent by ICE to Plaintiffs in or around April 2016 which \ninformed Plaintiffs that their SEVIS record and Form I-20 issued by UNNJ were set \nto “Terminated status” on account of their “fraudulent enrollment” in UNNJ and \nthat, as a result, they no longer had valid F-1 nonimmigrant status. \nP.  UNNJ Enrollment. The term “UNNJ enrollment” means initial enrollment in UNNJ \nand any matters, actions, materials, statements, or other information arising from, \nrelating to, made from, or obtained through that enrollment. For example, any action \ntaken by a class member that arose out of a request, instruction, or requirement by \nan individual acting as a UNNJ official will be considered to be included in the \ndefinition  of  UNNJ  enrollment.  The  mere  fact  that  a  matter,  action,  material, \nstatement, or other information arose or was created after such UNNJ enrollment, \nbased on the date of such subsequent matter, action, material, statement, or other \ninformation alone, is not enough to demonstrate that it was “arising from, relating \nto, made from, or obtained through” that enrollment.  \nII.  TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT \nA.  Class  Certification  and  Approval  of  the  Agreement.  The  Parties  agree  to \ncooperate in the class-certification process and to take all reasonable steps to ensure \nthat this Agreement is approved by the Court and becomes effective, which includes \nbut is not limited to the following:  \n1.  Filing a Joint Motion for Preliminary Approval and Class Certification within 30 \ndays after execution of this Agreement, which will request that the Court grant \npreliminary approval of the Agreement, grant conditional certification of the \nsettlement class as defined in paragraph I.C, direct issuance of settlement notice \nto class members as set forth in paragraph II.B below, and schedule a Fairness \nHearing; \n2.  Notifying the class members of the conditionally certified class and offering the \nClass  the  opportunity  to  file  objections  to  the  Agreement  pursuant  to  the \nprocedures set forth in paragraph II.B below;  \n3.  Appearing at a Fairness Hearing, at which the Parties will jointly request that the \nCourt certify the settlement class and approve the Agreement as final, fair, \nreasonable, adequate, and binding on the Class, all Class members, all Plaintiffs, \nand all Defendants.  \n \n \n4 \n \n\n \nB.  Notice to Class Members. \n1.  The Parties agree to cooperate in the class-notification process. Defendants agree \nto provide the information necessary to effectuate notification of class members \nfor objection purposes. Plaintiffs’ Counsel agrees to cooperate with Defendants \nin notifying the class members of this Agreement at Defendants’ expense.  \n2.  The Parties will jointly prepare a Notice that explains the Agreement to class \nmembers. The proposed Notice will be submitted as an exhibit to the Joint \nMotion  for  Preliminary  Approval  and  Class  Certification.  The  Notice  will \ninclude, at a minimum, the following:  \na.  A summary of the substantive relief included in this Agreement;  \nb.  The date of the Fairness Hearing with a clear statement that the date may \nchange without further notice to the Class;  \nc.

The  address  for  Plaintiffs’  Counsel’s  website  with  links  to  relevant \ndocuments in the case; and  \nf.  Instructions on how to access the case docket via PACER or in person at the \nCourt’s locations.  \n3.  Defendants agree to take the following steps to effectuate notice to the class: \na.  Send the full Notice in paper form to class members as follows: (i) for class \nmembers with an application for immigration benefits currently pending \nwith DHS, to the address on record for the pending application; (ii) for class \nmembers with no application for immigration benefits currently pending \nwith DHS, to the last address a class member provided to DHS on Form \nAR-11, unless the class member has departed the United States; and (iii) if \nthe class member is or has been in removal proceedings, the latest address \nof the class member on file with the Executive Office for Immigration \nReview (“EOIR”);  \nb.  Send the full Notice in paper form to the addresses on file with Defendants \nfor the most recent legal representatives of every class member in matters \nbefore DHS, DOS, and EOIR, in compliance with statutory and regulatory \nconfidentiality provisions;  \nc.  Send the full Notice in electronic form to the email address(es) of a class \nmember and legal representative (if any) that appear in: (i) SEVIS records \nor myUSCIS account records; and (ii) DOS electronic visa applications; \n \n5 \n \n\n \nd.  Post the full Notice on the websites for DHS, USCIS, ICE, DOS, and DOE; \nand \ne.  Post an announcement on the main social media accounts of DHS, USCIS, \nICE, and DOE, with a link to each agency’s respective posting. \n4.  Plaintiffs agree to take the following steps to effectuate notice to the class:  \na.  Distribute the full Notice to trade publications that represent noncitizens, \nincluding  the  American  Immigration  Lawyers  Association  (“AILA”), \nAmerican Immigration Council (“AIC”), the National Immigration Project \nof the National Lawyers Guild (“NIPNLG”), Immigrants’ List, and other \nimmigration-related nonprofit organizations known to Plaintiffs’ Counsel; \nb.  Post the full Notice on the website of Plaintiffs’ Counsel;   \nc.  Post an announcement on all social media accounts of Plaintiffs’ Counsel, \ndirecting readers to the appropriate website posting; and \nd.  Send the full Notice in electronic form to all class members and legal \nrepresentatives of class members known to Plaintiffs’ Counsel.  \n5.  The Notice will be translated into Chinese and Hindi, and the Notice will include \nan online link to these translations. \nC.  Rescinding the April 2016 SEVP Termination Letters. DHS agrees that, as of the \nAgreement’s Effective Date, the April 2016 SEVP Termination Letters will be \ntreated as rescinded, will be without continuing legal force or effect, and will not be \nused to take adverse action against a class member.   \nD.  UNNJ Enrollment Not Grounds for Inadmissibility or Deportability.  \n1.  Defendants agree that UNNJ enrollment is not sufficient grounds to find that a \nclass member is \na.  inadmissible (or has failed to establish his or her admissibility) or ineligible \nfor an immigration benefit due to alleged fraud or willful misrepresentation \nunder INA § 212(a)(6)(C)(i) (8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)); or \nb.  deportable for failing to continuously maintain lawful status under INA \n§ 237(a)(1)(C)(i) (8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)).  \n2.  The phrase “UNNJ enrollment is not sufficient grounds” in this paragraph means \nthat additional evidence of violations of the law or bases of ineligibility, apart \nfrom UNNJ enrollment, must be present for Defendants to make a finding of \ninadmissibility,  deportability,  or  ineligibility  against  a  class  member.  Such \nadditional evidence includes, but is not limited to, evidence of the following:  \na.  affirmative material misrepresentations made to any government official \nabout full completion of a degree program/graduation at UNNJ; \n \n6 \n \n\n \nb.  written statements signed by a class member which assert that the class \nmember  attended  classes  at  UNNJ  (but  not  including  any \nmisrepresentations contained in documents allegedly created by UNNJ \nsuch as transcripts or attendance sheets);  \nc.  material misrepresentations about employment history at any time, before \nor after UNNJ enrollment;  \nd.  material misrepresentations about marital status or any other material \nbiographic details or identifiers; or  \ne.  evidence pertaining to a limited number of class members who engaged in \nbroker conduct. For purposes of this Agreement, a class member engaged \nin “broker conduct” if, in exchange for a monetary benefit from UNNJ, the \nclass member solicited others to enroll in UNNJ with actual knowledge \nthat UNNJ was not and would not operate as a bona fide school and that \nsuch enrollment was or would be a violation of law. \n3.  Before Defendants may rely on any evidence specified in paragraph II.D.2 to \ndeny an immigration benefit or to take any other adverse action against a class \nmember, Defendants must provide such evidence to the class member and give \nthe class member the opportunity to rebut such evidence. \n4.  Defendants agree that misrepresentations related to UNNJ made prior to April 5, \n2016, are not material if they have been or are retracted or corrected by the class \nmember in subsequent written filings, applications, or interviews.  \n5.  The Parties agree that this paragraph is limited to findings of inadmissibility or \ndeportability based on UNNJ enrollment and Defendants retain all authorities \navailable under the INA.  \nE.  Adjudication of Applications for Immigration Benefits filed by Class Members \nin Light of UNNJ Enrollment.  \n1.  DHS agrees that it will not use UNNJ enrollment as a ground to deny any \napplication for immigration benefits filed by class members.  \n2.  Defendants agree that a class member’s UNNJ enrollment will not be considered \nas a negative or adverse factor in the discretionary analysis for any immigration \nbenefit that, under governing statutes or regulations, requires an adjudicator to \nconduct  a  discretionary  analysis  and  make  a  discretionary  determination \n(including  but  not  limited  to  adjustment,  change,  or  extension  of  status \napplications, and applications for discretionary waivers adjudicated by DHS or \nDOS  such  as  inadmissibility  waivers  under  INA  § 212(d)(3)(A)  (8  U.S.C. \n§ 1182(d)(3)(A)). \n3.  DHS agrees that it will not deem a class member inadmissible at a port of entry \nbased  on  his  or  her  UNNJ  enrollment,  subject  to  the  provisions  listed  in \nparagraph II.D.2, for class members seeking admission at a port of entry. While \n \n7 \n \n\n \nadmissibility decisions will be made at the time that a class member arrives in \nthe United States, DHS will have access to the revised subject records, as \nspecified further in paragraph II.H, indicating that enrollment in UNNJ is not \nsufficient  to  find  that  an  applicant  is  inadmissible  for  fraud  or  willful \nmisrepresentation under INA § 212(a)(6)(C)(i) (8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)). \nF.  No Accrual of Unlawful Presence or Failure to Maintain Lawful Status. \n1.  Defendants agree that a class member will not be considered to have accrued \nunlawful presence for the period corresponding to the date of their UNNJ \nenrollment through the date 180 days from the Agreement’s Effective Date, or \n180 days from the date removal proceedings are dismissed under paragraph II.J, \nwhichever is later.  \n2.  Defendants agree that a class member will not be considered ineligible or barred \nunder any provision of the INA or its governing regulations (including INA \n§ 245(c)  (8  U.S.C.  § 1255(c))  or  8  C.F.R.  § 248.1)  from  receiving  an \nimmigration benefit that requires maintenance of lawful status, or to be in lawful \nstatus  at  the  time  of  filing  the  application,  (including,  but  not  limited  to, \napplications for adjustment of status, change of status, or extension of status) on \naccount of matters arising during the period specified in paragraph II.F.1.  \n3.  A class member shall affirmatively state that he or she is a member of this class \nand  reference  the  terms  of  this  paragraph  in  any  future  applications  for \nimmigration benefits which inquire about periods of presence and/or work \nauthorization in the United States.  \nG. No Effect of Prior Denials Based on UNNJ Enrollment. DHS agrees to timely \nadjudicate any application for immigration benefits filed by class members without \nconsideration of or regard to the class member’s UNNJ enrollment or a prior denial \nof immigration benefits due to the class member’s UNNJ enrollment. \nH. Modification of Records and Investigative Databases. \n1.  DHS agrees to modify existing SEVIS records to remove references to “fraud,” \nincluding  any  findings  or  mentions  of  inadmissibility  under  INA \n§ 212(a)(6)(C)(i) (8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)) related to UNNJ enrollment, for \nall class members. DHS maintains the right to insert/maintain remarks related to \nINA § 212(a)(6)(C)(i) (8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)) arising from facts unrelated \nto UNNJ enrollment. \n2.  DHS agrees to archive/modify subject record remarks in investigative databases, \nif any exist, to reflect that UNNJ enrollment will not be sufficient to find that a \nclass member is (1) inadmissible for fraud or willful misrepresentation under \nINA § 212(a)(6)(C)(i) (8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)) or (2) deportable for failing \nto continuously maintain lawful status under INA § 237(a)(1)(C)(i) (8 U.S.C. \n§ 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)), pursuant to paragraph II.D.1–2.   \n3.  DHS  agrees  that  such  subject  record  remarks  will  also  reflect  that  prior \n \n8 \n \n\n \ninadmissibility/deportability findings or immigration benefit denials based on a \nclass member’s UNNJ enrollment will not operate to foreclose eligibility in \nsubsequent adjudications, pursuant to paragraph II.G.   \n4.  DHS agrees to place entries in investigative database(s) to alert users of the \nprovisions of paragraph II.F.  \n5.  Defendants agree that, if a class member has been assigned more than one A \nnumber,  Defendants  will  archive/modify  subject  record  remarks  in  records \ncorresponding to all known A numbers associated with the class member in \naccordance with this subsection.  \n6.  Plaintiffs agree that, if a class member has been assigned more than one A \nnumber, then the class member shall list all known or previously used A numbers \non  all  future  immigration-related  correspondence  with  any  government \nofficial/agency requiring the listing of an A number.  \n7.  For class members who have been assigned A numbers due to prior enforcement \nor removal actions, DHS agrees to insert/modify remarks in case-management \ndatabase(s)  maintained  by  the  ICE  Office  of  the  Principal  Legal  Advisor \n(“OPLA”) reflecting that such individuals are members of this class action and \nhandling of such cases must occur in accordance with this Agreement.  \na.  Such remarks will reflect that UNNJ enrollment shall not be a basis to find \nthat  a  class  member  is  (1)  inadmissible  for  fraud  or  willful \nmisrepresentation  under  INA  § 212(a)(6)(C)(i)  (8  U.S.C. \n§ 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)) or (2) deportable for failing to continuously maintain \nlawful status under INA § 237(a)(1)(C)(i) (8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)), \npursuant to paragraph II.D.1–2.   \nb.  Such  remarks  will  also  reflect  that  prior  inadmissibility  findings  or \nimmigration benefit denials based on an individual’s UNNJ enrollment \nwill  not  operate  to  foreclose  eligibility  in  subsequent  adjudications, \npursuant to paragraph II.G.   \nc.  If a class member has been assigned more than one A number, DHS will, \nin  accordance  with  this  paragraph,  insert/modify  remarks  in  records \ncorresponding to all known A numbers associated with the class member \nin case management database(s) maintained by ICE OPLA. \nI.  Deadline to File Applications for Immigration Benefits for Class Members \nInside the United States. Except as provided below and in paragraph II.J for class \nmembers currently or previously in removal proceedings, all class members who \nremain in the United States shall have 180 days from the Agreement’s Effective Date \nto apply for immigration benefits or depart the United States.  \n1.  The requirements in this paragraph do not apply to class members who have \nalready acquired lawful status, or have otherwise been granted permission to \nremain in the United States through an adjudication by DHS. \n \n9 \n \n\n \n2. For the purposes of this paragraph, “apply for immigration benefits” refers to an \napplication for which the class member is prima facie eligible and, if applicable, \nfor which a visa number is available according to the DOS Visa Bulletin at the \ntime the application is filed, if needed. For purposes of this paragraph, “prima \nfacie eligible” means that on first appearance the class member appears to meet \nthe eligibility requirements. \na.  For example, the filing of a Form I-130 based on a relationship to an \nimmediate relative—as defined by INA § 201(b)(2)(A)(i) (8 U.S.C. § \n1151(b)(2)(A)(i))—or  a  Form  I-140  based  on  an  employment-based \npreference category (i.e., EB-1–EB 5) for which the priority date is current \nat the time of filing according to the DOS Visa Bulletin would qualify as \n“apply[ing] for immigration benefits” under this paragraph.  \nb.  However,  the  filing  of  a  Form  I-130  based  on  a  family-sponsored \npreference  category  (i.e.,  F-1–F-4)  or  a  Form  I-140  based  on  an \nemployment-based preference category (i.e., EB-1–EB 5) for which the \npriority date is not current at the time of filing according to the DOS Visa \nBulletin would not qualify as “apply[ing] for immigration benefits” under \nthis paragraph. \n3.  For purposes of this paragraph, an application for immigration benefits pending \non the Agreement’s Effective Date shall be considered filed within 180 days of \nthe Agreement’s Effective Date. \n4.  If a class member does not apply for immigration benefits or depart the United \nStates within 180 days of the Agreement’s Effective Date, DHS may place the \nindividual in removal proceedings for any lawful reason, consistent with DHS \nenforcement guidelines for prioritization of noncitizens for enforcement action, \nif any guidelines exist, without regard to whether such guidelines differ from \nguidelines in effect on this Agreement’s Effective Date. In such cases, DHS’s \nobligations under paragraph II.J shall not apply to the applicable class member. \n5.  If a class member’s application for immigration benefits is denied, and that class \nmember has exhausted any administrative appellate rights, ICE may issue a \nNotice  to  Appear  (“NTA”)  for  any  lawful  reason,  consistent  with  DHS \nenforcement guidelines for prioritization of noncitizens for enforcement action, \nif any guidelines exist, without regard to whether such guidelines differ from \nguidelines in effect on this Agreement’s Effective Date. In such cases, DHS shall \nhave no further obligations to a class member under paragraph II.J. \nJ.  Dismissal of Removal Proceedings. For class members who are currently in \nremoval proceedings (or were previously in removal proceedings which resulted in \na final order of removal) based on removal charges with a factual basis related to or \narising out of UNNJ enrollment, including but not limited to being out of status, \nDHS agrees to move to dismiss proceedings under the conditions of this paragraph.  \n1.  DHS’s obligations under this paragraph shall not apply in cases where the \nremoval proceedings are or were based on removal charges with a factual basis \n \n10 \n \n\n \nunrelated to and not arising out of UNNJ enrollment, and DHS reserves the right \nto decline to file a motion to dismiss in cases of INA violations involving issues \nnot related to or arising out of UNNJ enrollment.  \n2.  For purposes of this provision, “removal charges with a factual basis related to \nor arising out of UNNJ enrollment” include any allegation or charge that a class \nmember failed to continuously maintain status under INA § 237(a)(1)(C)(i) (8 \nU.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)) due to their UNNJ enrollment or committed fraud or \nmade willful material misrepresentations under INA § 212(a)(6)(C) (8 U.S.C. \n§ 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)) due to their UNNJ enrollment.  \n3.  For class members who are in removal proceedings on the Effective Date of this \nAgreement, DHS will move to dismiss the removal proceedings under 8 C.F.R. \n§§ 239.2(c), 1239.2(c) within 120 days of this Agreement’s Effective Date.  \na.  DHS will file such motions unless it receives a request in writing from the \nclass member (or, if represented, the class member’s counsel) asking DHS \nto refrain from seeking dismissal. Such a written request should be made \nwithin  30  days  of  receipt  of  a  notice  advising  of  membership  in  a \nconditionally certified class. \n4.  For class members with an administratively final order of removal as of the \nEffective Date of this Agreement, DHS will:  \na.  Move  to  reopen  the  removal  proceedings  within  120  days  of  the \nAgreement’s Effective Date and, if the motion to reopen is granted,  \nb.  Move to dismiss the proceedings under 8 C.F.R. §§ 239.2(c), 1239.2(c).    \n5.  For class members who were granted voluntary departure but did not depart the \nUnited  States,  DHS  agrees  that  neither  INA  § 240B(d)(1)  (8  U.S.C. \n§ 1229c(d)(1))  nor  8  C.F.R.  § 1240.26(e)(2)  shall  apply  to  bar  such  class \nmembers from receiving an immigration benefit, and the provisions of this \nparagraph shall apply to such class members to the same extent as other class \nmembers with administratively final orders of removal under paragraph II.J.4.  \n6.  For class members with an administratively final grant of voluntary departure \nthat have departed the United States during the period of such a grant, the Parties \nagree that DHS will not file motions to reopen such grants. \n7.  If a DHS motion under this paragraph (including a motion to reopen or a motion \nto dismiss) is denied by an Immigration Judge, DHS will appeal the denial to the \nBoard of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) and the affected class member will file \nan appropriate non-opposition to the appeal.   \n8.  If a class member’s application for immigration benefits is denied, and the class \nmember has exhausted any administrative appellate rights, DHS may issue an \nNTA for any lawful reason, consistent with DHS enforcement guidelines for \nprioritization of noncitizens for enforcement action if any guidelines exist, \n \n11 \n \n\n \nwithout regard to whether such guidelines differ from guidelines in effect on this \nAgreement’s  Effective  Date.  In  such  cases,  DHS  shall  have  no  further \nobligations to a class member under paragraph II.J.  \n9.  If removal proceedings are dismissed pursuant to a motion filed under the terms \nof this paragraph, the class member must depart the United States or apply for \nimmigration benefits within 180 days of the date removal proceedings are \ndismissed (unless the class member has otherwise acquired lawful status, or been \ngranted permission to remain in the United States through an adjudication by \nDHS). \na.  For purposes of this paragraph, an application for immigration benefits \npending when a class member’s removal proceedings are dismissed shall \nbe considered filed within 180 days of the date removal proceedings are \ndismissed. \nb.  If a class member fails to depart or fails to apply for immigration benefits \nwithin 180 days of dismissal, DHS may issue an NTA for any lawful \nreason, consistent with DHS enforcement guidelines for prioritization of \nnoncitizens for enforcement action in effect at the time the issuance of such \nNTA is contemplated, if any guidelines exist, without regard to whether \nsuch  guidelines  differ  from  guidelines  in  effect  on  this  Agreement’s \nEffective Date. In such cases, DHS shall have no further obligations to a \nclass member pursuant to this paragraph.   \nc.  For the purposes of this paragraph, “apply for immigration benefits” refers \nto an application for which the class member is prima facie eligible and, if \napplicable, for which a visa number is available according to the Visa \nBulletin at the time the application is filed, if needed. For purposes of this \nparagraph, “prima facie eligible” means that on first appearance the class \nmember appears to meet the eligibility requirements. \n1)  For example, the filing of a Form I-130 based on a relationship to an \nimmediate relative—as defined by INA § 201(b)(2)(A)(i) (8 U.S.C. \n§ 1151(b)(2)(A)(i))—or a Form I-140 based on an employment-based \npreference category (i.e., EB-1–EB-5) for which the priority date is \ncurrent at the time of filing according to the DOS Visa Bulletin would \nqualify as “apply[ing] for immigration benefits” under this paragraph.  \n2)  However, the filing of a Form I-130 based on a family-sponsored \npreference category (i.e., F-1–F-4) or a Form I-140 based on an \nemployment-based preference category (i.e., EB-1–EB-5) for which \nthe priority date is not current at the time of filing according to the \nDOS Visa Bulletin would not qualify as “apply[ing] for immigration \nbenefits” under this paragraph. \nd.  DHS  agrees  that  all  provisions  under  paragraphs  II.D–II.G  of  this \nAgreement shall apply to class members whose removal proceedings have \nbeen dismissed and who either apply for immigration benefits or depart the \n \n12 \n \n\n \nUnited States.  \ne.  A class member may not file an appeal, on any legal or factual basis, of \nany order granting reopening and/or dismissal of proceedings pursuant to \na motion filed under this paragraph.   \n10. DHS agrees to (i) expressly mention this Agreement and place an online link to \nthis Agreement in any motions DHS files before an IJ or BIA pursuant to \nparagraphs II.J; and (ii) file this Agreement in cases where (a) DHS deems it \nnecessary, or (b) the IJ or BIA requests the Agreement. \n11. Plaintiffs and DHS agree that service of any filings (such as optional non-\noppositions to any DHS filing), under paragraph II.J shall be made upon the ICE \nOPLA Newark field location regardless of a class member’s present location, \nand DHS agrees to concede proper service of a filing served upon DHS in \ncompliance with this paragraph.  \na.  OPLA Newark will coordinate the submission of DHS filings under this \nparagraph.  \nb.  OPLA Newark will designate one or more points of contact, and provide \nappropriate email address(es), for purposes of communication with class \nmembers or their attorneys with respect to the provisions of this paragraph.  \n1)  Plaintiffs must serve court filings (such as non-oppositions under \nparagraph II.J.7) on OPLA Newark via existing methods: i.e., via ICE \neService or via mail to OPLA Newark, 970 Broad Street, Room 1300, \nNewark,  NJ  07102.  See  https://www.ice.gov/field-office/office-\nprincipal-legal-advisor-newark.  \n2)  Plaintiffs must serve written opt-out requests asking DHS to refrain \nfrom  seeking  dismissal  of  removal  proceedings  under  paragraph \nII.J.3.a. via email to the OPLA Newark (Elizabeth) Duty Attorney at \nOPLA-Elizabeth-DutyAttorney@ice.dhs.gov, and must include in the \nsubject line the following language: “DONG SETTLEMENT MTD \nOPT-OUT.”  \n3)  If a class member submits a written request that requires a response, \nDHS will designate an individual for that specific inquiry and that \nindividual will respond accordingly to the class member in accordance \nwith this paragraph. \nc.  DHS  and  Plaintiffs’  Counsel  may  confer  and  adjust  the  procedure \ndescribed in this sub-paragraph, as needed, with a written agreement. \n12. DHS is not responsible for decisions issued by an individual immigration judge \nor the BIA in a particular case, or for any delays in adjudication of motions by \nthe immigration court or BIA.  \n \n13 \n \n\n \na.  DHS’s  obligations  under  this  paragraph  are  strictly  limited  to  taking \nappropriate positions before the immigration court and/or BIA consistent \nwith this Agreement and filing motions or appeals before the immigration \ncourt or BIA as described above.  \nb.  Plaintiffs agree to raise and resolve any disputes about timeliness of \nimmigration  court  or  BIA  adjudications  directly  with  the  applicable \nimmigration court or the BIA. \n13. Following  a  grant  of  dismissal,  relief,  or  protection  from  removal  by  an \nimmigration judge or the BIA, DHS shall have no further obligations to a class \nmember in removal proceedings under paragraph II.J. However, the Parties agree \nthat DHS will still be bound by its other obligations to class members under this \nAgreement,  including  regarding  applications  for  immigration  benefits  filed \noutside of removal proceedings pursuant to paragraphs II.D–II.G. \n14. This Agreement does not affect DHS’s ability to place class members into \nremoval proceedings at any time for reasons unrelated to UNNJ enrollment, such \nas  for  criminal  removal  grounds  or  for  student-status  violations  arising  in \nconnection with subsequent enrollment at another educational institution that is \nunrelated to UNNJ. \nK. Applications for Reinstatement of Student Status. DHS agrees to adjudicate and, \nto the extent possible, grant all reinstatement applications by class members who \nremain in the United States if such applications are pending on the Agreement’s \nEffective Date or filed within 180 days of the Agreement’s Effective Date, without \nregard to the standard five-month filing window, a class member’s previous lack of \nstatus, or a prior denial of a previously filed reinstatement application. \n1.  If USCIS intends to deny a reinstatement application, USCIS will issue a notice \nof intent to deny (“NOID”) and provide the affected class member with an \nopportunity to address the evidence against them. \n2.  DHS agrees that UNNJ enrollment will not be a reason for the denial of any \nreinstatement  application,  and  the  requirements  of  8  C.F.R. \n§§ 214.2(f)(16)(i)(A) and (F) will be deemed satisfied. \n3.  Plaintiffs and DHS agree that the other requirements for reinstatement, including \nsubmission of a new Form I-20 from a new educational institution, will apply. \n4.  DHS agrees to create internal guidance and to consult with ICE OPLA as needed \nto alleviate any issues that may arise in issuing valid Forms I-20. \n5.  As reinstatements are discretionary, any misconduct or violations of a class \nmember before or after UNNJ enrollment (but not including UNNJ enrollment) \nmay be weighed in the exercise of discretion on a case-by-case basis. \nL.  Timing of Adjudications Under this Agreement.  \n \n14 \n \n\n \n1.  DHS will take an initial adjudicative action within 120 days of the submission \nof  an  application  for  immigration  benefits  (or  within  120  days  of  the \nAgreement’s Effective Date if the application is pending initial adjudicative \naction on the Agreement’s Effective Date).  \n2.  DHS will take a subsequent adjudicative action within 90 days of the receipt of \nthe response to any Request for Evidence (“RFE”) or NOID.  \n3.  DHS is not obligated to take an adjudicative action while the response period for \nany RFE or NOID remains pending and the class member has not submitted the \nrequired response(s).   \n4.  This paragraph will not apply to applications for asylum filed with USCIS. \nM. Termination of Certain Obligations. \n1.  Following the adjudication of the first application for immigration benefits filed \nby a class member pursuant to paragraph II.I or II.J.9, DHS’s obligations under \nparagraphs II.K and II.L shall be complete and shall not apply to any future \napplication for immigration benefits filed by that class member.  \n2.  However, DHS agrees that its obligations under the remaining paragraphs of this \nAgreement (including those in paragraphs II.D–II.G) shall apply to all future \napplications for immigration benefits filed by class members.  \nN.  Dismissal of Action. Plaintiffs agree to dismiss this Action against all Defendants \nwith prejudice within 30 days of this Agreement’s Effective Date. \nO. Retention of Jurisdiction and Dispute Resolution.  \n1.  The Parties stipulate that the Court retains ultimate jurisdiction to enforce this \nAgreement, subject to the sunset provisions located throughout this Agreement, \nand will file a stipulation and proposed order to that effect.  \n2.  The Parties agree to submit any unresolved disputes to the mediation procedures \nin paragraphs II.O.3–4 prior to filing of any motions with the Court related to a \npost-settlement dispute. Should any dispute remain unresolved after completion \nof the mediation procedures set forth below, a class member may apply to the \nCourt  for  enforcement  of  the  Agreement  only  through  Plaintiffs’  Counsel. \nDefendants may apply to the Court for enforcement of the Agreement if efforts \nto resolve disputes with Plaintiffs’ Counsel are unsuccessful. \n3.  For any disputes related to alleged DHS noncompliance,  \na.  DHS agrees to designate a point of contact (“DHS POC”) for dispute-\nresolution  purposes.  Contact  information  for  the  DHS  POC  will  be \nprovided in the Notice issued to class members under paragraph II.B.

ORDER GRANTING JOINT MOTION \nFOR PRELIMINARY CLASS \nCERTIFICATION AND \nTAE D. JOHNSON , et al.,  PRELIMINARY SETTLEMENT \nAPPROVAL  \nDefendants. \nBefore the Court is a joint motion by the parties1 to preliminarily certify a settlement class \nand preliminarily approve a settlement agreement (“Settlement”) executed on November 22, 2021. \nHaving reviewed the parties’ motion papers and the attachments thereto, the Court GRANTS the \nmotion, and hereby finds and orders as follows: \n1. The named plaintiffs and class members are foreign nationals who enrolled in the\nUniversity of Northern New Jersey (“UNNJ”), a fictitious university created by the Department of \nHomeland Security (“DHS”). \n2. DHS closed UNNJ on April 5, 2016. It thereafter issued notices to certain named\nplaintiffs and class members informing them that their Student and Exchange Visitor Information \n1 The named plaintiffs are Yi Dong, Xian Feng, Yiqi Huang, Shaofu Li, Kaushalkumar Patel, \nHirenkumar Patel, and Qing Wang. The defendants are Tae D. Johnson, in his official capacity as \nActing Director, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”); Ur Mendoza Jaddou, in \nher official capacity as Director, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”); Alejandro \nMayorkas, in his official capacity as Secretary, Department of Homeland Security; the United \nStates  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (“DHS”);  the  United  States  Department  of  State \n(“DOS”); the United States Department of Education (“DOE”); and the United States of America. \n1 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-02092-ES-JSA   Document 133   Filed 01/10/22   Page 2 of 7 PageID: 1051\nSystem (“SEVIS”) records and the Form I-20 issued to them by UNNJ were set to “Terminated \nstatus.”. \n3. Plaintiffs initiated this putative class-action lawsuit in the United States District\nCourt for the Eastern District of New York in November 2016, alleging that the termination of \ntheir student status violated the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and the Administrative \nProcedure Act (“APA”), and that the Government should be equitably estopped from using their \nenrollment in UNNJ against them in future immigration applications. \n4. The action was transferred to this Court in April 2017.\n5. The Court dismissed the lawsuit for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, but the U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed and remanded to this Court for further proceedings \nconsistent with its opinion. See Fang v. Dir., ICE, 935 F.3d 172 (3d Cir. 2019). \n6. Plaintiffs thereafter filed a Second Amended Complaint (the operative complaint)\non March 18, 2020, naming the current named class representatives and defendants. See ECF No. \n74. \n7. After  more  than  five  years  of  litigation,  the  parties  executed  the  Settlement\nAgreement on November 22, 2021. \n8. On December 19, 2021, the parties jointly moved this Court to preliminarily certify\na settlement class and preliminarily approve the parties’ Settlement pursuant to Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 23(e)(1)(B). \n9. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e)(2)(B), the Court finds that it “will\nlikely be able to . . . certify the class for purposes of judgment” on the parties Settlement proposal. \nThe Court therefore preliminarily certifies a class consisting of the following members: “Any \n2 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-02092-ES-JSA   Document 133   Filed 01/10/22   Page 3 of 7 PageID: 1052\nnoncitizen who, for any period of time, enrolled in the University of Northern New Jersey \n(‘UNNJ’).” \na. This class meets the requirements for class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)\nbecause: (1) the class members are so numerous that joinder of all class members is impracticable; \n(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) the claims of the named plaintiffs\nare typical of those of the class; and (4) the named plaintiffs and their counsel will fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of the class. \nb. As Rule 23(a)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires, the class is “so\nnumerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.” There are over 1,000 individuals who meet \nthe class definition—a number far greater than the 40-member baseline for numerosity established \nby the Third Circuit. See In re NFL Players Concussion Injury Litig., 821 F.3d 410, 426 (3d Cir. \n2016). \nc. As Rule 23(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires, there is at least\none question of law or fact common to the class. The common questions of law and fact Plaintiffs’ \nclaims present include: (1) whether Defendants made findings that class members engaged in fraud \nby enrolling in UNNJ; (2) if Defendants did make such findings, whether those findings violated \nthe APA and procedural due process; (3) whether the termination of class members’ SEVIS status \nwas arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA; (4) whether the representations Defendants \nmade to class members during the UNNJ operation constituted affirmative misconduct; and (5) \nwhether an estoppel claim is viable under the circumstances of this case. Any one of these common \nquestions satisfies the commonality requirement. \nd. As Rule 23(a)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires, the named\nplaintiffs’ claims are typical of those of the class. Each of the named plaintiffs enrolled in UNNJ \n3 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-02092-ES-JSA   Document 133   Filed 01/10/22   Page 4 of 7 PageID: 1053\nand  alleges  immigration-related  harm  stemming  from  that  enrollment  and  the  subsequent \ntermination of their F-1 nonimmigrant status. Their claims and the harm they allege are typical of \nthe class. \ne. As Rule 23(a)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires, the named\nplaintiffs fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class because none of the named \nplaintiffs’ interests are antagonistic to those of the class as a whole. Moreover, proposed class \ncounsel—Ira J. Kurzban, Edward F. Ramos, and Elizabeth Montano of the law firm Kurzban \nKurzban Tetzeli & Pratt—are qualified, experienced, and capable of protecting and advancing the \ninterests of the class. \nf. The Court further finds that certification of a settlement class is warranted under\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2), as Defendants’ actions apply generally to the class such \nthat final injunctive relief is appropriate to the class as a whole. \n11. The Court hereby appoints as class counsel attorneys Ira J. Kurzban, Edward F.\nRamos, and Elizabeth Montano of the law firm Kurzban Kurzban Tetzeli & Pratt. \n12. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e)(1)(B), the Court preliminarily\nfinds that the terms of the parties’ Settlement Agreement appear fair, reasonable, and adequate \nsuch that notice of the proposed Settlement should be directed to the preliminarily certified class. \n13. The Court approves the revised class notice (“Notice”) submitted by the parties\npursuant to the Court’s December 21, 2021 Minute Order (ECF No. 131). \n14. The Court approves the parties’ agreement regarding distribution of notice to the\nclass. The Notice (in substantially the form of the revised Notice referenced above) shall be \ndisseminated to the class consistent with the terms of the parties’ Settlement Agreement, namely, \nas follows: \n4 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-02092-ES-JSA   Document 133   Filed 01/10/22   Page 5 of 7 PageID: 1054\na. Defendants shall take the following steps to effectuate notice to the class:\ni. Send the full Notice in paper form to class members as follows: (i) for class\nmembers with an application for immigration benefits currently pending\nwith DHS, to the address on record for the pending application; (ii) for class\nmembers with no application for immigration benefits currently pending\nwith DHS, to the last address a class member provided to DHS on Form\nAR-11, unless the class member has departed the United States; and (iii) if\nthe class member is or has been in removal proceedings, the latest address\nof the class member on file with the Executive Office for Immigration\nReview (“EOIR”);\nii. Send the full Notice in paper form to the addresses on file with Defendants\nfor the most recent legal representatives of every class member in matters\nbefore DHS, DOS, and EOIR, in compliance with statutory and regulatory\nconfidentiality provisions;\niii. Send the full Notice in electronic form to the email address(es) of a class\nmember and legal representative (if any) that appear in: (i) SEVIS records\nor myUSCIS account records; and (ii) DOS electronic visa applications;\niv. Post the full Notice on the websites for DHS, USCIS, ICE, DOS, and DOE;\nand\nv. Post an announcement on the main social media accounts of DHS, USCIS,\nICE, and DOE, with a link to each agency’s respective posting.\nb. Plaintiffs’ Counsel shall take the following steps to effectuate notice to the class:\n5 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-02092-ES-JSA   Document 133   Filed 01/10/22   Page 6 of 7 PageID: 1055\ni. Distribute the full Notice to trade publications that represent noncitizens,\nincluding  the  American  Immigration  Lawyers  Association  (“AILA”),\nAmerican Immigration Council (“AIC”), the National Immigration Project\nof the National Lawyers Guild (“NIPNLG”), Immigrants’ List, and other\nimmigration-related nonprofit organizations known to Plaintiffs’ Counsel;\nii. Post the full Notice on the website of Plaintiffs’ Counsel;\niii. Post an announcement on all social media accounts of Plaintiffs’ Counsel,\ndirecting readers to the appropriate website posting; and\niv. Send the full Notice in electronic form to all class members and legal\nrepresentatives of class members known to Plaintiffs’ Counsel.\n15. The Court finds that the Notice and notice procedures described above constitute\nvalid and sufficient notice to the settlement class and represent the best notice practicable under \nthe circumstances. The Notice apprises class members in a fair and neutral way of the existence of \nthe  Settlement  Agreement  and  their  rights  and  obligations  under  the  proposed  Settlement. \nDissemination of the Notice as provided above is hereby authorized and approved, and satisfies \nthe notice requirements of Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n16. Counsel for the parties shall begin to effectuate notice to the class no later than\nJanuary 17, 2022. \n17.  All steps to effectuate notice to the class shall be completed no later than March 3,\n2022. \n18. Any class member who objects to the terms of the Settlement and who wishes for\nthe Court to consider their objections must submit their objections in writing to counsel for the \n6 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-02092-ES-JSA   Document 133   Filed 01/10/22   Page 7 of 7 PageID: 1056",

Before their work through OPT ended, Plaintiffs sought the guidance of academic \nbrokers and recruiters to assist them to enroll in graduate programs that would allow them to \nfurther their education in the U.S through continued lawful employment.  These brokers steered \nPlaintiffs to enroll at UNNJ, a university accredited by the Accrediting Commission of Career \nSchools and Colleges, listed as a bona fide school by the New Jersey’s Department of Education, \nand approved by the Department of Homeland Security for participation in the student visa \nprogram. \n4.  The  agents  pushed  Plaintiffs  to  enroll  in  UNNJ  because  it  offered  graduate \nprograms which authorized students to continue their practical education in the United States \nthrough authorized work. Specifically, UNNJ allowed its enrollees to participate in Curricular \nPractical Training (“CPT”), a program similar to OPT which allows foreign university students \nto work for U.S. businesses while in student status when such work forms part of their academic \ncurriculum.  Consistent  with  Government  regulations,  UNNJ  authorized  its  enrollees  to \nparticipate in OPT upon the commencement of their graduate programs. \n5.  Unbeknownst to Plaintiffs, UNNJ was established by Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement (“ICE”), the immigration enforcement branch of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. ICE created UNNJ in September 2013 as part of a sting operation to investigate and \nprosecute academic brokers who ICE believed were likely to commit visa fraud. \n\t\r   2 \nAILA Doc. No. 16112135.

ICE obtained official accreditation for UNNJ, secured its inclusion on the New Jersey \nDepartment of Education’s website as a legitimate school, listed UNNJ as a DHS-approved for \nparticipation in the student-visa program, set up an official “.edu” website with pictures of the \nschool and its students and which prominently advertised its accreditations, and maintained an \nactive online presence on social media.  UNNJ was staffed with an active President, “Dr. Steven \nBrunetti, Ph.D.,” corresponded regularly in his role as “President” with students, maintained a \npage on UNNJ’s website, and who regularly posted both personal and school-related updates on \nFacebook and Twitter. \n7.  ICE shut down UNNJ in April 2016 and arrested 21 academic brokers for visa \nfraud and other related offenses. \n8.  Immediately following these arrests, ICE began terminating the student status of \nPlaintiffs  and  all  other  foreign  students  who  had  enrolled  at  UNNJ  for  their  “fraudulent \nenrollment.” Without providing Plaintiffs or the other students with a meaningful opportunity to \nconfront any adverse evidence against them or to present evidence of their own, ICE determined \nacross-the-board that all UNNJ enrollees knowingly participated in visa fraud by enrolling in the \nschool for the sole purpose of illegally obtaining and/or maintaining their student status. ICE has \nprovided  Plaintiffs  with  no  mechanism  for  contesting  their  termination  or  the  agency’s \ndetermination that they knowingly committed fraud by enrolling in UNNJ. \n9.  Plaintiffs, in fact, were repeatedly assured by both UNNJ and their agents that the \nuniversity and the programs it offered were legitimate and complied with all applicable rules and \nregulations.  At  no  point  before  April  2016,  when  ICE  terminated  their  student  status,  did \nPlaintiffs know that UNNJ was not a legitimate school or that there was anything amiss with \n\t\r   3 \nAILA Doc.

The  ICE’s  blanket  fraud  determination  has  far-reaching  consequences  for \nPlaintiffs and the other UNNJ students they seek to represent. The determination, which ICE \nmade without providing Plaintiffs with any meaningful opportunity to contest it, makes Plaintiffs \nineligible for nearly all future immigration benefits. Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declarative \nrelief. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nBackground on Student Visas and Practical Training \n11.  Congress has authorized nonimmigrant student status for foreign nationals who \nenroll  in  Government-approved  academic  institutions.    8  U.S.C.  §  1101(a)(15)(F).  Foreign \nstudents enter the United States on an “F-1” visa and are described as being in “F-1 student \nstatus.”  ICE’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program (“SEVP”) is responsible for administering \nthe F-1 student program and tracking information on students in F-1 status. \n12.  A school must obtain formal approval from DHS before it can sponsor a student’s \nF-1 status. The approval process is rigorous. A school must first file an application for School \nCertification  on  Form  I-17  through  the  Student  and  Exchange  Visitor  Information  System \n(“SEVIS”), a SEVP-managed Internet based system to track and monitor schools and foreign \nstudents in the United States. 8 C.F.R. § 214.3. The application requires a school to submit to \nDHS detailed information on its programs of study; accreditations and recognitions; information \non its calendar, costs, and demographics; the locations of its campuses and instructional sites; \nand information on responsible school officials. It must also submit supporting evidence. To \nobtain DHS approval, universities must provide proof of accreditation from a U.S. Department of \nEducation-recognized accrediting agency and information on each of the school’s programs of \n\t\r   4 \nAILA Doc. No. 16112135. (Posted 11/21/16)\n\nCase 1:16-cv-06422   Document 1   Filed 11/18/16   Page 5 of 24 PageID #: 5\n\t\r  \nstudy. If approved, the school must submit to periodic recertification, which may be denied for a \nhost of reasons, including a school’s failure to operate as a bona fide institution of learning, its \nfailure to employ adequate qualified professional personnel, or its failure to maintain proper \nfacilities for instruction. Id. § 214.4(a)(2). \n13.  When ICE determines that a school’s participation in SEVP should be terminated, \nit provides the school with notice and an opportunity to contest the intended termination. ICE \nalso  maintains  a  practice  and  policy  of  informing  students  of  their  school’s  forthcoming \ntermination and providing them an opportunity to transfer to another school or change status \nbefore ICE terminates their SEVIS record. ICE provides such students with at least one month of \nnotice, affording them an opportunity to preserve their valid F-1 status. \n14.  ICE regulations delegate considerable oversight authority to Designated School \nOfficials (“DSOs”) – school employees named by a school’s president and approved by ICE to \nmonitor, advise, and oversee F-1 students enrolled in the school. 8 C.F.R. § 214.3(l). \n15.  DSOs are responsible for, among other things, activating and maintaining SEVIS \nrecords for the duration of a student’s enrollment, including registering a student’s participation \nin CPT; approving or requesting approval for benefits such as employment and reduced course \nload; and providing students with information needed to make informed decisions regarding \nmaintaining nonimmigrant student status, including counseling students on the number of work \nhours allowed, the type of employment allowed, and their need to maintain F-1 student status.  \nSee, e.g.,  8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f)(6)(iii), 9(ii)(D), (10)(i); 214.3(g) \n16.  One of a DSO’s principal responsibilities is to monitor students enrolled in their \nschool and help them maintain compliance with the myriad rules governing F-1 student status. \nDSOs thus “serve[] as a link between nonimmigrant students and SEVP and play[] a central role \n\t\r   5 \nAILA Doc.

As the ICE recognizes, “[t]here are a number of responsibilities for nonimmigrant \nstudents to keep in mind. When one also considers that many of these students are in an \nunfamiliar culture, and perhaps struggling to become more fluent in English, the role of the DSO \nbecomes more critical in assisting the student to maintain his/her nonimmigrant status. Your \nunderstanding  of  SEVP  and  nonimmigrant  student  status  will  assist  you  in  counseling \nnonimmigrant students in ways that remind them of their responsibilities and allow them to \nmaintain  their  nonimmigrant  status.”  Id.  at  15.  ICE  admonishes  DSOs  that  “[b]y  carefully \nattending to the details of the information and the student’s record, a DSO may be able to alert \nthe student to issues that might jeopardize their nonimmigrant status or make it difficult for them \nto re-enter the United States to continue their studies.” Id. at 14. \n18.  Foreign nationals admitted to the U.S. in F-1 student status may lawfully remain \nin the country as long as long as they are “pursuing a full course of study at an educational \ninstitution approved by the Service for attendance by foreign students, or engaging in authorized \npractical training following completion of studies . . . .”  8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f)(5)(i). Noncitizens in \nF-1 status are issued SEVIS Form I-20 by the ICE-approved school the student will attend. 8 \nC.F.R. § 214.2(f)(1)(i)(A). An F-1 student maintains valid status as long as he or she is “making \nnormal progress toward completing a course of study,” id., and a student who continues from one \neducation level to another (i.e., advancing from a bachelor’s to a master’s program) is considered \nto be maintaining his or her status. 8 C.F.R. § 214.6(f)(5)(ii). In the case of postgraduate \n\t\r   6 \nAILA Doc. No. 16112135.

Students in valid F-1 status may transfer to another school as long as they follow \nprescribed procedures. 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f)(8)(i).  An F-1 student who transfers between schools \nis allowed to remain in the U.S. while transferring as long as the student will begin classes at the \nnew school within five months of transferring from the previous school or within five months of \nthe program completion date, whichever is earlier.  Id. \n20.  Regulations authorize certain students in F-1 status to engage in what is known as \n“practical training” –  authorized work that F-1 students may perform related to their major areas \nof study.  8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f)(10). The regulations authorize noncitizens to perform such work \nwhile in F-1 student status. \n21.  Regulations authorize two types of practical study: Curricular Practical Training \n(“CPT”)  and  Optional  Practical  Training  (“OPT”).    CPT  is  work  performed  as  part  of  an \nacademic  curriculum,  and  is  defined  as  “alternative  work/study,  internship,  cooperative \neducation, or any other type of required internship or practicum that is offered by sponsoring \nemployers through cooperative agreements with the school.”  8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f)(10)(i). \n22.  ICE entrusts a school’s DSO with designating CPT offerings and authorizing \nindividual students to participate in CPT. The authorization process is handled entirely by DSOs \nwithout ICE’s direct involvement or adjudication. Rather, absent intervention from ICE, DSOs \nalone are responsible for confirming that a school’s practical training opportunity qualifies for \nCPT. \n23.  DSOs  are  responsible  for  recording  a  student’s  participation  in  CPT  in  the \nstudent’s SEVIS record. If a school approves a student for participation in CPT, it will provide \n\t\r   7 \nAILA Doc. No. 16112135.

This CPT-endorsed Form I-20 serves as \nevidence of the student’s authorization to work. \n24.  There is no restriction on compensation during CPT. So long as it is authorized by \na school’s DSO, a student may complete CPT through full-time employment with a for-profit \ncorporation and earn monetary compensation for the work performed. Further, F-1 students \nenrolled in a graduate studies may participate in CPT at the start of their program if approved by \nthe school’s DSO.  Id. \n25.  OPT is temporary employment separate from a student’s curricular requirements \nthat is directly related to the student’s major area of study.  8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f)(10)(ii)(A).  \nStudents  may  engage  in  authorized  OPT  during  their  annual  vacation  or  when  school  is \notherwise not in session; while school is in session as long as training does not exceed 20 hours a \nweek; or after completion of a course of study.  8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f)(10)(ii)(A)(1)-(3).  Training \nundertaken before a course of study is completed is commonly known as “pre-completion OPT” \nwhile training after the course of study has been completed is known as “post-completion OPT.” \nOPT  is  generally  available  for  up  to  12  months,  but  students  with  science,  technology, \nengineering, or mathematics degrees may obtain a 24-month extension beyond the initial 12 \nmonths of post-completion OPT.  8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f)(10)(C). A student authorized for post-\ncompletion OPT may transfer to a new school and maintain his or her F-1 status as long as the \nstudent resumes his or her course of study within five months of transferring out of his or her last \nschool or the date OPT authorization ends, whichever is earlier.  8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f)(8)(i). \n26.  A student who fails to maintain a full course of study or otherwise has his or her \nF-1 student status terminated may apply for reinstatement.  8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f)(16)(i).

There is no appeal from ICE’s decision to deny reinstatement. \n8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f)(16)(ii).    \nUniversity of Northern New Jersey and ICE’s Sting Operation \n27.  In  September  2013,  ICE’s  Homeland  Security  Investigations  (“HSI”)  unit \nestablished a university in Cranford, New Jersey called the University of Northern New Jersey \n(“UNNJ”).  HSI established UNNJ as part of an ICE sting operation called “Operation Triple \nLindy” targeting unscrupulous academic recruiters and brokers who prey on foreign students \nseeking to maintain their valid F-1 status. These brokers steer students to enroll in schools whose \nprincipal objective is not to provide bona fide academic programs, but to enrich their proprietors \nthough  substantial  fees  and  tuition  while  offering  students  no  meaningful  educational \nopportunities. \n28.  Although such brokers are often aware that such schools are acting improperly, \nthey often abuse students’ trust and mislead them into believing that such schools are acting \nlawfully by facilitating practical training through the F-1 program. These brokers exploit the fact \n\t\r   9 \nAILA Doc. No. 16112135. (Posted 11/21/16)\n\nCase 1:16-cv-06422   Document 1   Filed 11/18/16   Page 10 of 24 PageID #: 10\n\t\r  \nthat in many countries, prospective students routinely engage academic brokers to assist with the \nprocess of identifying and enrolling in universities. They also take advantage of widespread \nmisinformation  concerning  the  F-1  program  and  the  complexity  of  the  program’s  rules  to \nconvince their clients that the school’s offerings are legitimate. \n29.  By  all  outside  appearances,  UNNJ  was  a  legitimate  university  occupying  a \nbuilding in Cranford and maintaining a highly visible web presence, including an elaborate \nofficial  website  (since  taken  down  but  archived  at \nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20160327093120/http://www.unnj.edu/) and highly active Facebook \nand Twitter accounts.  UNNJ’s President,  “Dr. Steven Brunetti, Ph.D.”, maintained a detailed \nLinkedIn page identifying him as the president of UNNJ and posted regularly on the school’s \nsocial media accounts. Dr. Brunetti exchanged correspondence with students and met with them \nin person at UNNJ’s office in Cranford.  \n30.  DHS bolstered the university’s appearance of legitimacy by listing UNNJ on \nDHS’s official website as certified for participation in SEVP. It also obtained accreditation for \nUNNJ by the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges (“ACCSC”), a U.S. \nDepartment of Education-recognized accrediting institution, and by obtaining recognition for \nUNNJ by the New Jersey Department of Education. UNNJ’s website prominently advertised its \naccreditations, which were independently verifiable. \n31.  From 2014 to 2016, “Dr. Brunetti” and others posing as UNNJ staff coordinated \nwith  various  brokers  to  enroll  foreign  students  at  UNNJ.    The  brokers  charged  students \nthousands of dollars for their services on top of the thousands of dollars UNNJ charged for \ntuition and fees. UNNJ provided brokers with financial kickbacks for recruiting and enrolling \nstudents at UNNJ. \n\t\r   10 \nAILA Doc. No. 16112135.

Brokers principally targeted for enrollment in UNNJ noncitizens in F-1 status \nwho had graduated from undergraduate or graduate programs at a U.S. university and worked \nlawfully for U.S. companies through OPT. Together, the brokers and UNNJ ensnared these \nstudents with promises that they could continue lawfully working in the U.S. through CPT \nwithout any immediate need to attend classes at UNNJ. Some students were told that they could \nnot enroll in classes because they were full; others that the school would soon offer classes \nonline. Students were assured, however, that the UNNJ’s offering of OPT to students upon \nenrollment was consistent with applicable regulations governing practical training in the F-1 \nprogram.  \n33.  Upon  information  and  belief,  UNNJ  designated  the  school’s  President,  Dr. \nBrunetti, as its Principal DSO. Dr. Brunetti, however, provided noncitizens enrolled in UNNJ \nwith none of the support expected or required of DSOs. Dr. Brunetti did not counsel students on \nhow to maintain their lawful F-1 student status or provide them with appropriate guidance. To \nthe contrary, Dr. Brunetti and other UNNJ staff compounded the misinformation the brokers fed \ntheir student clients by ignoring or actively misleading students who sought their guidance. \nBrunetti discouraged students from seeking guidance on the school’s CPT offerings, telling \nUNNJ enrollees who contacted him not to bother him. \n34.  Brunetti and other staff repeatedly reassured students that the extensions UNNJ \noffered  to  their  practical  training  programs  would  not  pose  a  problem,  and  made  similar \nrepresentations to DSOs at other bona fide academic institutions when students sought to transfer \nto  UNNJ.  Further,  consistent  with  F-1  program  regulations,  UNNJ  provided  students  with \nwritten confirmation that they were authorized to work through CPT from the beginning of their \ngraduate programs. \n\t\r   11 \nAILA Doc.

On April 5, 2016, ICE and the \nDepartment of Justice announced the arrest of 21 brokers and recruiters for visa fraud and other \ncrimes in connection with the UNNJ operation. \n36.  Immediately  following  the  operation’s  public  announcement,  ICE  began \nterminating the SEVIS records and I-20s for each of the more than 1,000 noncitizens who had \nenrolled at UNNJ for their “fraudulent enrollment.” Specifically, ICE made a blanket finding that \nany noncitizen who enrolled in UNNJ knowingly participated in visa fraud by enrolling at UNNJ \nfor the sole purpose of illegally obtaining and/or maintaining their F-1 nonimmigrant status. ICE \ndid not provide students with an individualized hearing or any meaningful opportunity to contest \nits determination that they had committed knowing visa fraud by enrolling in UNNJ. \n37.  Contrary to its established practice and policy, ICE did not provide these students \nwith any advance notice that the school’s SEVIS designation would be terminated, nor any \nopportunity to transfer to another school or apply for a chance of status before their SEVIS \nrecords were terminated. \n38.  ICE placed many of the students in removal proceedings in Immigration Court by \nissuing them Notices to Appear (“NTAs”) which charged them with being removable from the \nUnited States under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i) for failure to maintain or comply with the \nconditions of the nonimmigrant status under which they were admitted. \nImmigration Consequences of a Fraud Finding \n \n39.  An official finding that a noncitizen has knowingly participated in visa fraud \ncomes  with  far-ranging  consequences,  making  such  an  individual  ineligible  for  nearly  all \nimmigration benefits. \n40.  Section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. \n\t\r   12 \nAILA Doc. No. 16112135. (Posted 11/21/16)\n\nCase 1:16-cv-06422   Document 1   Filed 11/18/16   Page 13 of 24 PageID #: 13\n\t\r  \n1182(a)(6)(C)(i), states that “[a]ny alien who, by fraud or willfully misrepresenting a material \nfact, seeks to procure (or has sought to procure or has procured) a visa, other documentation, or \nadmission into the United States or other benefit under the chapter is inadmissible.”  Such \nindividuals “are ineligible to receive visas and ineligible to be admitted to the United States.”  § \n1182(a). Any such individual in the United States is ineligible to adjust their status and become a \nlawful permanent resident (i.e. a “green card” holders). Id. § 1255(a). ICE’s blanket fraud \nfinding  thus  renders  all  UNNJ  enrollees  permanently  and  forever  barred  from  permanent \nadmission to the United States, subject only to a narrow discretionary waiver available only to \nindividuals with a spouse or parent who is a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident and who \nwould  suffer  extreme  hardship  if  the  discretionary  waiver  were  not  granted  from  the \nGovernment.  See id. §§ 1182(d)(3); 1182(i). \n41.  ICE’s across-the-board fraud finding also renders UNNJ enrollees ineligible for \nreinstatement of their F-1 status because a student who has a record of “willful violations of \nService regulations” is categorically ineligible for reinstatement.  8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f)(16)(i)(B). \n42.  At least two students formerly enrolled at UNNJ who have returned to China have \nhad  their  visa  applications  denied  or  delayed  by  U.S.  consulates  abroad  based  on  their \ninadmissibility under § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i).  Based on ICE’s blanket finding that every noncitizen \nwho reenrolled in UNNJ knowingly participated in visa fraud, none of the Plaintiffs or others \nwho enrolled at UNNJ will ever be able to receive any immigration benefits in the future without \napplying for a discretionary waiver for which they may not be eligible.  They have essentially \nbeen  blacklisted  at  all  levels  of  the  U.S.  immigration  system  with  no  way  to  challenge \nmeaningfully ICE’s determination that they knowingly committed visa fraud. \n \n\t\r   13 \nAILA Doc.

This Court has jurisdiction over this matter under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal \nquestion jurisdiction), 28 U.S.C. § 1346 (United States as a defendant), and the United States \nConstitution. \n44.  There are no administrative remedies available to Plaintiffs.  ICE has determined \nthat  Plaintiffs  knowingly  committed  visa  fraud  and  there  is  no  established  mechanism  for \nPlaintiffs to challenge that determination administratively. \nVENUE \n45.  Venue  is  proper  in  the  Eastern  District  of  New  York  under  28  U.S.C.  § \n1391(e)(1)(C) as Plaintiff Jie Fang (Brooklyn, New York) resides in the Eastern District of New \nYork and Defendants are officers or employees of the United States.  Additionally, Mr. Fang was \nissued an NTA from ICE’s New York field office, which is responsible for all boroughs of New \nYork City and Long Island.  Venue is also proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1)(B) because ICE \nagents coordinated directly with a substantial number of academic brokers located in the Eastern \nDistrict of New York, including the broker who enrolled Plaintiff Xiaoyu Zhang, whose office \nwas located in Flushing, New York. \nPARTIES \n46.  Plaintiff Jie Fang is a native and citizen of the People’s Republic of China who \ncurrently resides in Brooklyn, New York.  Mr. Fang first entered the United States in March \n2011 to study at Murray State University in Murray, Kentucky.  After graduating from Murray \nState in December 2014 with a bachelor’s degree in finance, Mr. Fang moved to New York to \ncommence his post-completion OPT with Forte Capital Group in January 2015.

Towards the end of his OPT period, Mr. Fang decided that he wanted to pursue \ngraduate studies in finance and had heard about UNNJ through a friend.  Mr. Fang contacted \nPhilip Li and Sofia Zhang of Excellent Student Service to assist him with enrollment in UNNJ.  \nMs. Zhang informed Mr. Fang that he could legally work on CPT without attending classes.  Mr. \nFang conducted research online and saw that UNNJ was listed as an approved school on the \nDHS website, fully accredited, and had an active official webpage and social media accounts.  At \nthe  end  of  December  2015,  he  paid  Excellent  Student  Services  $2,000  and  provided  his \napplication materials to the agency which submitted them to UNNJ on his behalf.  Mr. Fang was \naccepted to UNNJ in late January 2016 and he paid Excellent Student Services another $1,700. \n48.  Mr. Fang worked for his employer on CPT from February 15, 2016 until the first \nweek of April when he received a letter from ICE terminating his student status.  About two \nweeks later, Mr. Fang received a letter from ICE requesting that he call to schedule a meeting at \nICE’s office in New York City.  The following week, Mr. Fang went to ICE’s office and was \nissued an NTA.  Mr. Fang’s Immigration Court hearing is scheduled for March 17, 2017. \n49.  Plaintiff Lifang Lin is a native of the People’s Republic of China who currently \nresides in Syracuse, New York.   Ms. Lin originally entered the United States in January 2008 to \npursue a bachelor’s degree in accounting at Syracuse University.  She graduated in December \n2012 and worked as an accounting tutor on post-completion OPT.  In October 2012, Ms. Lin \nreturned to China while she waited for her graduate studies in the U.S. to commence.  She re-\nentered the U.S. in July 2013 to pursue a master’s degree in finance at Syracuse University and \ngraduated in December 2014.  After graduation, Ms. Lin started working in February 2015 on \n\t\r   15 \nAILA Doc. No. 16112135.

In December 2015, Ms. Lin contacted Philip Li from Excellent Student Service to \nassist her with enrolling in a new academic program.  Mr. Li recommended UNNJ’s CPT \nprogram and told her that she could continue working for her employer on full time CPT as a \nstudent at UNNJ.  After researching online and seeing that UNNJ was recognized by DHS as an \nauthorized school for the F-1 program, Ms. Lin decided enroll there.  Ms. Lin expected to be \nenrolled starting in January 2016, but her program start date as listed on her I-20 was not until \nFebruary 10, 2016 — less than two months before UNNJ was shut down by the Government.  \nOn April 5, 2016, Ms. Lin found out from human resources personnel at her job that UNNJ was \npart of a DHS sting operation and that the school was shut down.  Later that month, ICE agents \nappeared at her house and handed her an NTA.  She does not currently have a hearing date set \nfor Immigration Court.  Ms. Lin currently has a pending application for adjustment of status to \nlawful permanent resident based on her marriage to a U.S. citizen.        \n51.  Plaintiff Xiaoyu Zhang is a native and citizen of the People’s Republic of China \nwho currently resides in Dallas, Texas.  Ms. Zhang originally entered the United States in August \n2011 on an F-1 student visa to pursue a bachelor’s degree in journalism at the University of \nTexas (“UT”).  Ms. Zhang graduated from UT in December 2013 and worked as a contractor for \nApple from January 2014 to January 2015 with her post-completion OPT.  In February 2015, \nMs. Zhang contacted Tiffany Xue with U.S. Quickly Consulting Center to help her find a \ngraduate school in which to enroll.  Ms. Xue informed her that there were schools that offered a \nfull time CPT program where students were not required to attend classes.  Ms. Zhang submitted \nher application materials to Ms. Xue who applied to UNNJ on her behalf.  Ms. Zhang received \n\t\r   16 \nAILA Doc. No. 16112135. (Posted 11/21/16)\n\nCase 1:16-cv-06422   Document 1   Filed 11/18/16   Page 17 of 24 PageID #: 17\n\t\r  \nan acceptance letter from UNNJ a few days later.  As this was the first time she had ever heard of \nUNNJ, Ms. Zhang researched the school online and saw that it was certified by both DHS and \nthe State of New Jersey.  Based on her research and Ms. Xue’s assurances, Ms. Zhang decided to \nenroll in UNNJ’s master’s in information systems program and paid $4,000 in tuition.  In April \n2015, Ms. Zhang was also accepted to the University of North Texas (“UNT”) for enrollment for \nthe fall semester, but she opted to defer her enrollment until fall 2016.  \n52.  In May 2015, Ms. Zhang started working as a business analyst for American \nTechnology Consulting, LLC with her CPT provided by UNNJ.  In March 2016, Ms. Zhang’s \ncontract with her employer expired and she informed Ms. Xue that she wanted to transfer from \nUNNJ to UNT where she would commence studies in the fall.  After several weeks had gone by \nwithout any progress on the transfer, Ms. Zhang unsuccessfully tried to contact Ms. Xue and \nUNNJ.  She searched UNNJ online, and much to her surprise, found out that UNNJ was shut \ndown  in  early  April  2016  and  that  Ms.  Xue  had  been  arrested.    Ms.  Zhang  received  her \ntermination letter from ICE the following week and worked with UNT to transfer her SEVIS \nrecord and obtain a new I-20.  UNT provided Ms. Zhang with a new I-20 and she applied for \nreinstatement in May 2016.  Her reinstatement application was rejected due to a filing error and \nshe resubmitted it in June 2016.  Ms. Zhang’s reinstatement application remains pending and she \nis currently attending classes at UNT.  Ms. Zhang was never contacted directly by ICE officers \nand never received an NTA, although her former employer told her that ICE officers did go to \nher former office to inquire about her.  \n53.  Defendant  Sarah  Saldaña  is  the  Director  of  Immigration  and  Customs \nEnforcement (“ICE”).  In this capacity, she is responsible for all ICE enforcement operations and \nthe administration of the Student Exchange Visitor Program.  She is ultimately responsible for \n\t\r   17 \nAILA Doc.

Ms. \nSaldaña is sued in her official capacity. \n54.  Defendant Jeh Johnson is the Secretary of Homeland Security and heads the \nDepartment of Homeland Security (“DHS”).  ICE is a subdivision of DHS. As Secretary of \nHomeland Security Mr. Johnson is ultimately responsible for all actions taken by ICE.  Mr. \nJohnson is sued in his official capacity. \n55.  Defendant Leon Rodriguez is the Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \nServices (“USCIS”), the agency within DHS responsible for adjudicating visa petitions and most \nother applications for immigration benefits.  Mr. Rodriguez is sued in his official capacity. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n56.  Plaintiffs bring this action as a class action on behalf of themselves and all others \nsimilarly situated pursuant to Rules 23(a) and 23(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The \nclass consists of the following ascertainable members: \nAll foreign students who enrolled at UNNJ and who were subjected to ICE’s \nblanket determination that they knowingly participated in visa fraud by enrolling \nin UNNJ.  \n \n57.  The precise number of noncitizens who fall within the class definition is known \nonly to Defendants, but based on public statements by the Government, the class likely consists \nof approximately 1,076 foreign students, making joinder of all members impracticable. \n58.  A community of interest exists between the named Plaintiffs and members of the \nclass in that there are questions of law and fact that are common to all Plaintiffs and class \nmembers. Plaintiffs and the class members they seek to represent challenge the determination \nthat they have committed fraud or a material misrepresentation making them ineligible in the \n\t\r   18 \nAILA Doc. No. 16112135. (Posted 11/21/16)\n\nCase 1:16-cv-06422   Document 1   Filed 11/18/16   Page 19 of 24 PageID #: 19\n\t\r  \nfuture for any immigration benefits or admission into the U.S. All Plaintiffs and class members \nhave all had their student status terminated by ICE because ICE determined that they committed \nfraud/material misrepresentation by enrolling at UNNJ.    \n59.  The claims or defenses of the representative Plaintiffs and of Defendants are \ntypical of the claims or defenses of the class. Although the relevant parties currently face \ndifferent immigration related procedural situations (whether currently subject to an NTA in the \nU.S., not currently subject to an NTA in U.S., or currently residing abroad), they all have the \nsame  claim  against  Defendants:  ICE  has  improperly  determined  that  they  committed \nfraud/material misrepresentation barring them from obtaining immigration benefits or admission \nto the United States in the future. \n60.  The named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class \nbecause  they,  like  all  class  members,  are  subject  to  the  same  unlawful  fraud/material \nmisrepresentation determination made by ICE based their enrollment at UNNJ. \n61.  Individual suits by each member of the class would be impracticable because they \nwould create a risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications and would establish incompatible \nstandards of conduct for the parties opposing the class. \n62.  The number of individual suits would impose an undue burden on the courts as it \nwould require the adjudication of potentially thousands of separate lawsuits. \n63.  Plaintiffs’ lead counsel, Ira J. Kurzban, has a 37 year history of experience in \nimmigration-related  class  action  cases  and  can  adequately  represent  the  interests  of  class \nmembers as well as the named plaintiffs. \n \n \n\t\r   19 \nAILA Doc. No. 16112135. (Posted 11/21/16)\n\nCase 1:16-cv-06422   Document 1   Filed 11/18/16   Page 20 of 24 PageID #: 20\n\t\r  \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION: \n \nVIOLATION OF THE FIFITH AMENDMENT OF THE U.S. CONSTITUION—\nFAILURE TO PROVIDE PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS \n \n64.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 1 to 63 as if fully stated herein. \n65.  ICE’s determination that Plaintiffs knowingly participated in visa fraud was not \naccompanied by constitutionally adequate procedural protections and violated Plaintiffs due \nprocess rights.  ICE made this determination on an across-the-board basis for every noncitizen \nwho enrolled at UNNJ without any individualized hearing. \n66.  This determination violated due process by: (i) failing to provide Plaintiffs with \nindividualized  hearings  before  impartial  adjudicators  before  determining  that  Plaintiffs \nknowingly committed visa fraud; (ii) failing to provide Plaintiffs with adverse evidence and an \nopportunity to confront and respond to such evidence; and (iii) failing to provide Plaintiffs with \nan opportunity to present evidence on their behalf. \n67.  Rather  than  comply  with  these  well-established  due  process  principles,  ICE \nsimply made a blanket determination that any student who ever enrolled at UNNJ knowingly \nparticipated in visa fraud regardless of the facts surrounding each student’s case.  ICE’s complete \ndisregard for consideration of Plaintiffs’ individual circumstances and its blanket, indiscriminate \ndetermination that every noncitizen who enrolled in UNNJ knowingly committed visa fraud \nviolated Plaintiffs procedural due process rights. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nVIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT—ARBITRARY AND \nCAPRICIOUS AGENCY ACTION: Visa Fraud Determination \n \n68.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 1 to 63 as if fully stated herein. \n\t\r   20 \nAILA Doc. No. 16112135. (Posted 11/21/16)\n\nCase 1:16-cv-06422   Document 1   Filed 11/18/16   Page 21 of 24 PageID #: 21\n\t\r  \n69.  ICE’s finding that Plaintiffs engaged in knowing visa fraud in connection with \ntheir enrollment at UNNJ violates the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) and should be set \naside pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) as arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and \notherwise not in accordance with the law.  \n70.  In making its finding that Plaintiffs engaged in knowing visa fraud, the agency did \nnot consider any facts relevant to Plaintiffs’ individual circumstances nor did it provide any \nexplanation, let alone reasoned explanation, justifying its determination.  Rather than considering \nrelevant facts specific to each student, ICE merely pre-determined as a fait accompli that any \nstudent who ever enrolled at UNNJ engaged in fraud.  The only fact considered by ICE in \nmaking this determination was the fact of the students’ enrollment in UNNJ.  The agency’s lack \nof consideration of any other relevant facts specific to individual students before making its \ndetermination was arbitrary and capricious and in violation of the APA. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \nVIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT—ARBITRARY AND \nCAPRICIOUS AGENCY ACTION: Unlawful Termination of F-1 Status \n \n71.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 1 to 63 as if fully stated herein. \n72.  ICE’s termination of Plaintiffs’ F-1 student status violates the Administrative \nProcedure Act (“APA”) and should be set aside pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) as arbitrary, \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, and otherwise not in accordance with the law.  \n73.  Until ICE unilaterally shut down UNNJ, Plaintiffs complied with every rule and \nregulation governing the F-1 visa program. UNNJ was DHS-certified to sponsor students in F-1 \nstatus; UNNJ’s DSO certified Plaintiffs’ participation in a bona fide CPT program; and Plaintiffs \nobtained a facially valid Form I-20 confirming the validity of their F-1 status while participating \n\t\r   21 \nAILA Doc. No. 16112135. (Posted 11/21/16)\n\nCase 1:16-cv-06422   Document 1   Filed 11/18/16   Page 22 of 24 PageID #: 22\n\t\r  \nin CPT. \n74.  In unilaterally terminating Plaintiffs’ F-1 status immediately upon announcing its \nshutdown of UNNJ, ICE failed to provide Plaintiffs with notice or any opportunity to maintain \ntheir valid F-1 student status prior to its termination. In direct contravention of ICE’s established \npractice and policy, ICE failed to provide Plaintiffs with any opportunity to transfer to another \nschool or apply for a change of status before terminating their SEVIS records – an action which \ncaused Plaintiffs immediately to be “out of status.” \nATTORNEYS’ FEES \n75.  Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 1 to 74 as if fully stated herein. \n76.  As a result of Defendants’ unlawful actions, Plaintiffs were required to retain \nlegal counsel and to pay counsel reasonable attorneys’ fees. Plaintiffs qualify for fees, expenses, \nand costs under the Equal Access to Justice Act.  \n77.  Pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act (“EAJA”), 5 U.S.C. § 504 and 28 \nU.S.C. § 2412, Plaintiffs are entitled to recover their costs, expenses, and fees because the \nDefendants’ actions are not and have not been substantially justified. \nRELIEF REQUESTED \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court enter judgment in \ntheir favor and: \na.  Certify this action as a class action and award all relief granted to the class as a \nwhole; \nb.  Declare that ICE’s determination that Plaintiffs knowingly participated in visa \nfraud by their enrollment at UNNJ violated Plaintiffs’ Fifth Amendment due \nprocess rights; violated the APA and was arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of \n\t\r   22 \nAILA Doc.

The Action was transferred to the United States District Court for the District of New \nJersey (“the Court”) in April 2017; \n6.  The Court dismissed the Action for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) on October 2, 2017;  \n7.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed and remanded the Action \nfor further proceedings on August 15, 2019, see Fang v. Dir., ICE, 935 F.3d 172 (3d Cir. 2019); \n8.  Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint on March 18, 2020, naming the current \nNamed Plaintiffs and Defendants in the Action;  \n9.  The Parties desire to draw to a close litigation of this Action, which has been pending \nfor roughly five years. \n10.  The Parties executed a proposed settlement agreement on November 22, 2021, which \nthe Court preliminarily approved on January 10, 2022. \n11.  After notice of the proposed class action settlement was distributed to Class Members, \nand in response to questions from Class Members and their counsel, the Parties agreed to several \ntechnical amendments to the agreement that are incorporated in this Amended Settlement Agreement \nand Release. \nTERMS \nNOW THEREFORE in recognition that the Parties and the interests of justice are best served by \nconcluding this Action, it is hereby stipulated and agreed by and between the Parties as follows: \nI.

UNNJ Enrollment. The term “UNNJ enrollment” means initial enrollment in UNNJ \nand any matters, actions, materials, statements, or other information arising from, \nrelating to, made from, or obtained through that enrollment. For example, any action \ntaken by a class member that arose out of a request, instruction, or requirement by \nan individual acting as a UNNJ official will be considered to be included in the \ndefinition of UNNJ enrollment. The mere  fact that a matter, action,  material, \nstatement, or other information arose or was created after such UNNJ enrollment, \nbased on the date of such subsequent matter, action, material, statement, or other \ninformation alone, is not enough to demonstrate that it was “arising from, relating \nto, made from, or obtained through” that enrollment.  \nII.  TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT \nA.  Class  Certification  and  Approval  of  the  Agreement.  The  Parties  agree  to \ncooperate in the class-certification process and to take all reasonable steps to ensure \nthat this Agreement is approved by the Court and becomes effective, which includes \nbut is not limited to the following:  \n1.  Filing a Joint Motion for Preliminary Approval and Class Certification within 30 \ndays after execution of this Agreement, which will request that the Court grant \npreliminary approval of the Agreement, grant conditional certification of the \nsettlement class as defined in paragraph I.C, direct issuance of settlement notice \nto class members as set forth in paragraph II.B below, and schedule a Fairness \nHearing; \n \n4 \n \n\n \nCase 2:17-cv-02092-ES-JSA   Document 136-2   Filed 04/11/22   Page 6 of 22 PageID: 1115\n2.

Notice to Class Members. \n1.  The Parties agree to cooperate in the class-notification process. Defendants agree \nto provide the information necessary to effectuate notification of class members \nfor objection purposes. Plaintiffs’ Counsel agrees to cooperate with Defendants \nin notifying the class members of this Agreement at Defendants’ expense.  \n2.  The Parties will jointly prepare a Notice that explains the Agreement to class \nmembers. The proposed Notice will be submitted as an exhibit to the Joint \nMotion  for  Preliminary  Approval  and  Class  Certification.  The  Notice  will \ninclude, at a minimum, the following:  \na.  A summary of the substantive relief included in this Agreement;  \nb.  The date of the Fairness Hearing with a clear statement that the date may \nchange without further notice to the Class;  \nc.  The procedure and deadline for submitting objections to the Agreement, as \nset forth below;  \nd.  Contact information for Plaintiffs’ Counsel to answer questions;   \ne.

Send the full Notice in electronic form to all class members and legal \nrepresentatives of class members known to Plaintiffs’ Counsel.  \n5.  The Notice will be translated into Chinese and Hindi, and the Notice will include \nan online link to these translations. \nC.  Rescinding the April 2016 SEVP Termination Letters. DHS agrees that, as of the \nAgreement’s Effective Date, the April 2016 SEVP Termination Letters will be \ntreated as rescinded, will be without continuing legal force or effect, and will not be \nused to take adverse action against a class member.   \nD.  UNNJ Enrollment Not Grounds for Inadmissibility or Deportability.  \n1.  Defendants agree that UNNJ enrollment is not sufficient grounds to find that a \nclass member is \na.  inadmissible (or has failed to establish his or her admissibility) or ineligible \nfor an immigration benefit due to alleged fraud or willful misrepresentation \nunder INA § 212(a)(6)(C)(i) (8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)); or \nb.  deportable for failing to continuously maintain lawful status under INA \n§ 237(a)(1)(C)(i) (8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)).  \n \n6 \n \n\n \nCase 2:17-cv-02092-ES-JSA   Document 136-2   Filed 04/11/22   Page 8 of 22 PageID: 1117\n2.  The phrase “UNNJ enrollment is not sufficient grounds” in this paragraph means \nthat additional evidence of violations of the law or bases of ineligibility, apart \nfrom UNNJ enrollment, must be present for Defendants to make a finding of \ninadmissibility,  deportability,  or  ineligibility  against  a  class  member.  Such \nadditional evidence includes, but is not limited to, evidence of the following:  \na.  affirmative material misrepresentations made to any government official \nabout full completion of a degree program/graduation at UNNJ; \nb.  written statements signed by a class member which assert that the class \nmember  attended  classes  at  UNNJ  (but  not  including  any \nmisrepresentations contained in documents allegedly created by UNNJ \nsuch as transcripts or attendance sheets);  \nc.  material misrepresentations about employment history at any time, before \nor after UNNJ enrollment;  \nd.  material  misrepresentations about  marital  status or any other material \nbiographic details or identifiers; or  \ne.  evidence pertaining to a limited number of class members who engaged in \nbroker conduct. For purposes of this Agreement, a class member engaged \nin “broker conduct” if, in exchange for a monetary benefit from UNNJ, the \nclass member solicited others to enroll in UNNJ with actual knowledge \nthat UNNJ was not and would not operate as a bona fide school and that \nsuch enrollment was or would be a violation of law. \n3.  Before Defendants may rely on any evidence specified in paragraph II.D.2 to \ndeny an immigration benefit or to take any other adverse action against a class \nmember, Defendants must provide such evidence to the class member and give \nthe class member the opportunity to rebut such evidence. \n4.  Defendants agree that misrepresentations related to UNNJ made prior to April 5, \n2016, are not material if they have been or are retracted or corrected by the class \nmember in subsequent written filings, applications, or interviews.  \n5.  The Parties agree that this paragraph is limited to findings of inadmissibility or \ndeportability based on UNNJ enrollment and Defendants retain all authorities \navailable under the INA.  \nE.  Adjudication of Applications for Immigration Benefits filed by Class Members \nin Light of UNNJ Enrollment.  \n1.  Defendants agree that they will not use UNNJ enrollment as a ground to deny \nany application for immigration benefits filed by class members.  \n2.  Defendants agree that a class member’s UNNJ enrollment will not be considered \nas a negative or adverse factor in the discretionary analysis for any immigration \nbenefit that, under governing statutes or regulations, requires an adjudicator to \n \n7 \n \n\n \nCase 2:17-cv-02092-ES-JSA   Document 136-2   Filed 04/11/22   Page 9 of 22 PageID: 1118\nconduct  a  discretionary  analysis  and  make  a  discretionary  determination \n(including  but  not  limited  to  adjustment,  change,  or  extension  of  status \napplications, and applications for discretionary waivers adjudicated by DHS or \nDOS  such  as  inadmissibility  waivers  under  INA  § 212(d)(3)(A)  (8  U.S.C. \n§ 1182(d)(3)(A)). \n3.  DHS agrees that it will not deem a class member inadmissible at a port of entry \nbased  on  his  or  her  UNNJ  enrollment,  subject  to  the  provisions  listed  in \nparagraph II.D.2, for class members seeking admission at a port of entry. While \nadmissibility decisions will be made at the time that a class member arrives in \nthe United States, DHS will have access to the revised subject records, as \nspecified further in paragraph II.H, indicating that enrollment in UNNJ is not \nsufficient  to  find  that  an  applicant  is  inadmissible  for  fraud  or  willful \nmisrepresentation under INA § 212(a)(6)(C)(i) (8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)). \nF.  No Accrual of Unlawful Presence or Failure to Maintain Lawful Status. \n1.  Defendants agree that a class member will not be considered to have accrued \nunlawful presence for the period corresponding to the date of their UNNJ \nenrollment through the date 180 days from the Agreement’s Effective Date, or \n180 days from the date removal proceedings are dismissed under paragraph II.J, \nwhichever is later.  \n2.  Defendants agree that a class member will not be considered ineligible or barred \nunder any provision of the INA or its governing regulations (including INA \n§ 245(c)  (8  U.S.C.  § 1255(c))  or  8  C.F.R.  § 248.1)  from  receiving  an \nimmigration benefit that requires maintenance of lawful status, or to be in lawful \nstatus  at  the  time  of  filing  the  application,  (including,  but  not  limited  to, \napplications for adjustment of status, change of status, or extension of status) on \naccount of matters arising during the period specified in paragraph II.F.1.  \n3.  A class member shall affirmatively state that he or she is a member of this class \nand  reference  the  terms  of  this  paragraph  in  any  future  applications  for \nimmigration benefits which inquire about periods of presence and/or work \nauthorization in the United States.  \nG. No Effect of Prior Denials Based on UNNJ Enrollment. Defendants agree to \ntimely adjudicate any application for immigration benefits filed by class members \nwithout consideration of or regard to the class member’s UNNJ enrollment or a prior \ndenial of immigration benefits due to the class member’s UNNJ enrollment. \nH. Modification of Records and Investigative Databases. \n1.  DHS agrees to modify existing SEVIS records to remove references to “fraud,” \nincluding  any  findings  or  mentions  of  inadmissibility  under  INA \n§ 212(a)(6)(C)(i) (8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)) related to UNNJ enrollment, for \nall class members. DHS maintains the right to insert/maintain remarks related to \nINA § 212(a)(6)(C)(i) (8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)) arising from facts unrelated \nto UNNJ enrollment. \n \n8 \n \n\n \nCase 2:17-cv-02092-ES-JSA   Document 136-2   Filed 04/11/22   Page 10 of 22 PageID: 1119\n2.  DHS agrees to archive/modify subject record remarks in investigative databases, \nif any exist, to reflect that UNNJ enrollment will not be sufficient to find that a \nclass member is (1) inadmissible for fraud or willful misrepresentation under \nINA § 212(a)(6)(C)(i) (8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)) or (2) deportable for failing \nto continuously maintain lawful status under INA § 237(a)(1)(C)(i) (8 U.S.C. \n§ 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)), pursuant to paragraph II.D.1–2.   \n3.  DHS  agrees  that  such  subject  record  remarks  will  also  reflect  that  prior \ninadmissibility/deportability findings or immigration benefit denials based on a \nclass member’s UNNJ enrollment will not operate to foreclose eligibility in \nsubsequent adjudications, pursuant to paragraph II.G.   \n4.  DHS agrees to place entries in investigative database(s) to alert users of the \nprovisions of paragraph II.F.  \n5.  Defendants agree that, if a class member has been assigned more than one A \nnumber,  Defendants  will  archive/modify  subject  record  remarks  in  records \ncorresponding to all known A numbers associated with the class member in \naccordance with this subsection.  \n6.  Plaintiffs agree that, if a class member has been assigned more than one A \nnumber, then the class member shall list all known or previously used A numbers \non  all  future  immigration-related  correspondence  with  any  government \nofficial/agency requiring the listing of an A number.  \n7.  For class members who have been assigned A numbers due to prior enforcement \nor removal actions, DHS agrees to insert/modify remarks in case-management \ndatabase(s)  maintained  by  the  ICE  Office  of  the  Principal  Legal  Advisor \n(“OPLA”) reflecting that such individuals are members of this class action and \nhandling of such cases must occur in accordance with this Agreement.  \na.  Such remarks will reflect that UNNJ enrollment shall not be a basis to find \nthat  a  class  member  is  (1)  inadmissible  for  fraud  or  willful \nmisrepresentation  under  INA  § 212(a)(6)(C)(i)  (8  U.S.C. \n§ 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)) or (2) deportable for failing to continuously maintain \nlawful status under INA § 237(a)(1)(C)(i) (8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)), \npursuant to paragraph II.D.1–2.   \nb.  Such  remarks  will  also  reflect  that  prior  inadmissibility  findings  or \nimmigration benefit denials based on an individual’s UNNJ enrollment \nwill  not  operate  to  foreclose  eligibility  in  subsequent  adjudications, \npursuant to paragraph II.G.   \nc.  If a class member has been assigned more than one A number, DHS will, \nin  accordance  with  this  paragraph,  insert/modify  remarks  in  records \ncorresponding to all known A numbers associated with the class member \nin case management database(s) maintained by ICE OPLA. \nI.  Deadline to File Applications for Immigration Benefits for Class Members \n \n9 \n \n\n \nCase 2:17-cv-02092-ES-JSA   Document 136-2   Filed 04/11/22   Page 11 of 22 PageID: 1120\nInside the United States. Except as provided below and in paragraph II.J for class \nmembers currently or previously in removal proceedings, all class members who \nremain in the United States shall have 180 days from the Agreement’s Effective Date \nto apply for immigration benefits or depart the United States.  \n1.  The requirements in this paragraph do not apply to class members who have \nalready acquired lawful status, or have otherwise been granted permission to \nremain in the United States through an adjudication by DHS. \n2. For the purposes of this paragraph, “apply for immigration benefits” refers to an \napplication for which the class member is prima facie eligible and, if applicable, \nfor which a visa number is available according to the DOS Visa Bulletin at the \ntime the application is filed, if needed. For purposes of this paragraph, “prima \nfacie eligible” means that on first appearance the class member appears to meet \nthe eligibility requirements. \na.  For example, the filing of a Form I-130 based on a relationship to an \nimmediate relative—as defined by INA § 201(b)(2)(A)(i) (8 U.S.C. § \n1151(b)(2)(A)(i))—or  a  Form  I-140  based  on  an  employment-based \npreference category (i.e., EB-1–EB 5) for which the priority date is current \nat the time of filing according to the DOS Visa Bulletin would qualify as \n“apply[ing] for immigration benefits” under this paragraph.  \nb.  However,  the  filing  of  a  Form  I-130  based  on  a  family-sponsored \npreference  category  (i.e.,  F-1–F-4)  or  a  Form  I-140  based  on  an \nemployment-based preference category (i.e., EB-1–EB 5) for which the \npriority date is not current at the time of filing according to the DOS Visa \nBulletin would not qualify as “apply[ing] for immigration benefits” under \nthis paragraph. \n3.  For purposes of this paragraph, an application for immigration benefits pending \non the Agreement’s Effective Date shall be considered filed within 180 days of \nthe Agreement’s Effective Date. \n4.  If a class member does not apply for immigration benefits or depart the United \nStates within 180 days of the Agreement’s Effective Date, DHS may place the \nindividual in removal proceedings for any lawful reason, consistent with DHS \nenforcement guidelines for prioritization of noncitizens for enforcement action, \nif any guidelines exist, without regard to whether such guidelines differ from \nguidelines in effect on this Agreement’s Effective Date. In such cases, DHS’s \nobligations under paragraph II.J shall not apply to the applicable class member. \n5.  If a class member’s application for immigration benefits is denied, and that class \nmember has exhausted any administrative appellate rights, ICE may issue a \nNotice  to  Appear  (“NTA”)  for  any  lawful  reason,  consistent  with  DHS \nenforcement guidelines for prioritization of noncitizens for enforcement action, \nif any guidelines exist, without regard to whether such guidelines differ from \nguidelines in effect on this Agreement’s Effective Date. In such cases, DHS shall \nhave no further obligations to a class member under paragraph II.J. \n \n10 \n \n\n \nCase 2:17-cv-02092-ES-JSA   Document 136-2   Filed 04/11/22   Page 12 of 22 PageID: 1121\nJ.  Dismissal  of  Removal Proceedings. For class members who  are  currently in \nremoval proceedings (or were previously in removal proceedings which resulted in \na final order of removal) based on removal charges with a factual basis related to or \narising out of UNNJ enrollment, including but not limited to being out of status, \nDHS agrees to move to dismiss proceedings under the conditions of this paragraph.  \n1.  DHS’s obligations under this paragraph shall not apply in cases where the \nremoval proceedings are or were based on removal charges with a factual basis \nunrelated to and not arising out of UNNJ enrollment, and DHS reserves the right \nto decline to file a motion to dismiss (or to decline to rescind an expedited \nremoval order) in cases of INA violations involving issues not related to or \narising out of UNNJ enrollment.  \n2.  For purposes of this provision, “removal charges with a factual basis related to \nor arising out of UNNJ enrollment” include any allegation or charge that a class \nmember failed to continuously maintain status under INA § 237(a)(1)(C)(i) (8 \nU.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)) due to their UNNJ enrollment or committed fraud or \nmade willful material misrepresentations under INA § 212(a)(6)(C) (8 U.S.C. \n§ 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)) due to their UNNJ enrollment.  \n3.  For class members who are in removal proceedings on the Effective Date of this \nAgreement, DHS will move to dismiss the removal proceedings under 8 C.F.R. \n§§ 239.2(c), 1239.2(c) within 120 days of this Agreement’s Effective Date.  \na.  DHS will file such motions unless it receives a request in writing from the \nclass member (or, if represented, the class member’s counsel) asking DHS \nto refrain from seeking dismissal. Such a written request should be made \nwithin  30  days  of  receipt  of  a  notice  advising  of  membership  in  a \nconditionally certified class. \n4.  For class members with an administratively final order of removal as of the \nEffective Date of this Agreement, DHS will:  \na.  Move  to  reopen  the  removal  proceedings  within  120  days  of  the \nAgreement’s Effective Date and, if the motion to reopen is granted,  \nb.  Move to dismiss the proceedings under 8 C.F.R. §§ 239.2(c), 1239.2(c). \nc.  For expedited removal orders issued under INA § 235(b)(1) (8 U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)),  DHS  will  rescind  such  orders  within  180  days  of  the \nAgreement’s Effective Date. \n5.  For class members who were granted voluntary departure but did not depart the \nUnited  States,  DHS  agrees  that  neither  INA  § 240B(d)(1)  (8  U.S.C. \n§ 1229c(d)(1))  nor  8  C.F.R.  § 1240.26(e)(2)  shall  apply  to  bar  such  class \nmembers from receiving an immigration benefit, and the provisions of this \nparagraph shall apply to such class members to the same extent as other class \nmembers with administratively final orders of removal under paragraph II.J.4.  \n \n11 \n \n\n \nCase 2:17-cv-02092-ES-JSA   Document 136-2   Filed 04/11/22   Page 13 of 22 PageID: 1122\n6.  For class members with an administratively final grant of voluntary departure \nthat have departed the United States during the period of such a grant, the Parties \nagree that DHS will not file motions to reopen such grants. \n7.  If a DHS motion under this paragraph (including a motion to reopen or a motion \nto dismiss) is denied by an Immigration Judge, DHS will appeal the denial to the \nBoard of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) and the affected class member will file \nan appropriate non-opposition to the appeal.   \n8.  If a class member’s application for immigration benefits is denied, and the class \nmember has exhausted any administrative appellate rights, DHS may issue an \nNTA for any lawful reason, consistent with DHS enforcement guidelines for \nprioritization of noncitizens for enforcement action if any guidelines exist, \nwithout regard to whether such guidelines differ from guidelines in effect on this \nAgreement’s  Effective  Date.  In  such  cases,  DHS  shall  have  no  further \nobligations to a class member under paragraph II.J.  \n9.  If removal proceedings are dismissed pursuant to a motion filed under the terms \nof this paragraph, the class member must depart the United States or apply for \nimmigration benefits within 180 days of the date removal proceedings are \ndismissed (unless the class member has otherwise acquired lawful status, or been \ngranted permission to remain in the United States through an adjudication by \nDHS). \na.  For purposes of this paragraph, an application for immigration benefits \npending when a class member’s removal proceedings are dismissed shall \nbe considered filed within 180 days of the date removal proceedings are \ndismissed. \nb.  If a class member fails to depart or fails to apply for immigration benefits \nwithin 180 days of dismissal, DHS may issue an NTA for any lawful \nreason, consistent with DHS enforcement guidelines for prioritization of \nnoncitizens for enforcement action in effect at the time the issuance of such \nNTA is contemplated, if any guidelines exist, without regard to whether \nsuch  guidelines  differ  from  guidelines  in  effect  on  this  Agreement’s \nEffective Date. In such cases, DHS shall have no further obligations to a \nclass member pursuant to this paragraph.   \nc.  For the purposes of this paragraph, “apply for immigration benefits” refers \nto an application for which the class member is prima facie eligible and, if \napplicable, for which a visa number is available according to the Visa \nBulletin at the time the application is filed, if needed. For purposes of this \nparagraph, “prima facie eligible” means that on first appearance the class \nmember appears to meet the eligibility requirements. \n1)  For example, the filing of a Form I-130 based on a relationship to an \nimmediate relative—as defined by INA § 201(b)(2)(A)(i) (8 U.S.C. \n§ 1151(b)(2)(A)(i))—or a Form I-140 based on an employment-based \npreference category (i.e., EB-1–EB-5) for which the priority date is \n \n12 \n \n\n \nCase 2:17-cv-02092-ES-JSA   Document 136-2   Filed 04/11/22   Page 14 of 22 PageID: 1123\ncurrent at the time of filing according to the DOS Visa Bulletin would \nqualify as “apply[ing] for immigration benefits” under this paragraph.  \n2)  However, the filing of a Form I-130 based on a family-sponsored \npreference category (i.e., F-1–F-4) or a Form I-140 based on an \nemployment-based preference category (i.e., EB-1–EB-5) for which \nthe priority date is not current at the time of filing according to the \nDOS Visa Bulletin would not qualify as “apply[ing] for immigration \nbenefits” under this paragraph. \nd.  DHS  agrees  that  all  provisions  under  paragraphs  II.D–II.G  of  this \nAgreement shall apply to class members whose removal proceedings have \nbeen dismissed and who either apply for immigration benefits or depart the \nUnited States.  \ne.  A class member may not file an appeal, on any legal or factual basis, of \nany order granting reopening and/or dismissal of proceedings pursuant to \na motion filed under this paragraph.   \n10. DHS agrees to (i) expressly mention this Agreement and place an online link to \nthis Agreement in any motions DHS files before an IJ or BIA pursuant to \nparagraphs II.J; and (ii) file this Agreement in cases where (a) DHS deems it \nnecessary, or (b) the IJ or BIA requests the Agreement. \n11. Plaintiffs and DHS agree that service of any filings (such as optional non-\noppositions to any DHS filing), under paragraph II.J shall be made upon the ICE \nOPLA Newark field location regardless of a class member’s present location, \nand DHS agrees to concede proper service of a filing served upon DHS in \ncompliance with this paragraph.  \na.  OPLA Newark will coordinate the submission of DHS filings under this \nparagraph.  \nb.  OPLA Newark will designate one or more points of contact, and provide \nappropriate email address(es), for purposes of communication with class \nmembers or their attorneys with respect to the provisions of this paragraph.  \n1)  Plaintiffs must serve court filings (such as non-oppositions under \nparagraph II.J.7) on OPLA Newark via existing methods: i.e., via ICE \neService or via mail to OPLA Newark, 970 Broad Street, Room 1300, \nNewark,  NJ  07102.  See  https://www.ice.gov/field-office/office-\nprincipal-legal-advisor-newark.  \n2)  Plaintiffs must serve written opt-out requests asking DHS to refrain \nfrom  seeking  dismissal  of  removal  proceedings  under  paragraph \nII.J.3.a. via email to the OPLA Newark (Elizabeth) Duty Attorney at \nOPLA-Elizabeth-DutyAttorney@ice.dhs.gov, and must include in the \nsubject line the following language: “DONG SETTLEMENT MTD \nOPT-OUT.”  \n \n13 \n \n\n \nCase 2:17-cv-02092-ES-JSA   Document 136-2   Filed 04/11/22   Page 15 of 22 PageID: 1124\n3)  If a class member submits a written request that requires a response, \nDHS will designate an individual for that specific inquiry and that \nindividual will respond accordingly to the class member in accordance \nwith this paragraph. \nc.  DHS  and  Plaintiffs’  Counsel  may  confer  and  adjust  the  procedure \ndescribed in this sub-paragraph, as needed, with a written agreement. \n12. DHS is not responsible for decisions issued by an individual immigration judge \nor the BIA in a particular case, or for any delays in adjudication of motions by \nthe immigration court or BIA.  \na.  DHS’s  obligations  under  this  paragraph  are  strictly  limited  to  taking \nappropriate positions before the immigration court and/or BIA consistent \nwith this Agreement and filing motions or appeals before the immigration \ncourt or BIA as described above.  \nb.  Plaintiffs agree to  raise and resolve any disputes about  timeliness of \nimmigration  court  or  BIA  adjudications  directly  with  the  applicable \nimmigration court or the BIA. \n13. Following  a  grant  of  dismissal,  relief,  or  protection  from  removal  by  an \nimmigration judge or the BIA, DHS shall have no further obligations to a class \nmember in removal proceedings under paragraph II.J. However, the Parties agree \nthat DHS will still be bound by its other obligations to class members under this \nAgreement,  including  regarding  applications  for  immigration  benefits  filed \noutside of removal proceedings pursuant to paragraphs II.D–II.G. \n14. This Agreement does not affect DHS’s ability to place class members into \nremoval proceedings at any time for reasons unrelated to UNNJ enrollment, such \nas  for  criminal  removal  grounds  or  for  student-status  violations  arising  in \nconnection with subsequent enrollment at another educational institution that is \nunrelated to UNNJ. \nK. Applications for Reinstatement of Student Status. DHS agrees to adjudicate and, \nto the extent possible, grant all reinstatement applications by class members who \nremain in the United States if such applications are pending on the Agreement’s \nEffective Date or filed within 180 days of the Agreement’s Effective Date, without \nregard to the standard five-month filing window, a class member’s previous lack of \nstatus, or a prior denial of a previously filed reinstatement application. \n1.  If USCIS intends to deny a reinstatement application, USCIS will issue a notice \nof intent to deny (“NOID”) and provide the affected class member with an \nopportunity to address the evidence against them. \n2.  DHS agrees that UNNJ enrollment will not be a reason for the denial of any \nreinstatement  application,  and  the  requirements  of  8  C.F.R. \n§§ 214.2(f)(16)(i)(A) and (F) will be deemed satisfied. \n \n14 \n \n\n \nCase 2:17-cv-02092-ES-JSA   Document 136-2   Filed 04/11/22   Page 16 of 22 PageID: 1125\n3.  Plaintiffs and DHS agree that the other requirements for reinstatement, including \nsubmission of a new Form I-20 from a new educational institution, will apply. \n4.  DHS agrees to create internal guidance and to consult with ICE OPLA as needed \nto alleviate any issues that may arise in issuing valid Forms I-20. \n5.  As reinstatements are discretionary, any misconduct or violations of a class \nmember before or after UNNJ enrollment (but not including UNNJ enrollment) \nmay be weighed in the exercise of discretion on a case-by-case basis. \nL.  Timing of Adjudications Under this Agreement.  \n1.  DHS will take an initial adjudicative action within 120 days of the submission \nof  an  application  for  immigration  benefits  (or  within  120  days  of  the \nAgreement’s Effective Date if the application is pending initial adjudicative \naction on the Agreement’s Effective Date).  \n2.  DHS will take a subsequent adjudicative action within 90 days of the receipt of \nthe response to any Request for Evidence (“RFE”) or NOID.  \n3.  DHS is not obligated to take an adjudicative action while the response period for \nany RFE or NOID remains pending and the class member has not submitted the \nrequired response(s).   \n4.  This paragraph will not apply to applications for asylum filed with USCIS. \nM. Termination of Certain Obligations. \n1.  Following the adjudication of the first application for immigration benefits filed \nby a class member pursuant to paragraph II.I or II.J.9, DHS’s obligations under \nparagraphs II.K and II.L shall be complete and shall not apply to any future \napplication for immigration benefits filed by that class member.  \n2.  However, DHS agrees that its obligations under the remaining paragraphs of this \nAgreement (including those in paragraphs II.D–II.G) shall apply to all future \napplications for immigration benefits filed by class members.  \nN.  Dismissal of Action. Plaintiffs agree to dismiss this Action against all Defendants \nwith prejudice within 30 days of this Agreement’s Effective Date. \nO. Retention of Jurisdiction and Dispute Resolution.  \n1.  The Parties stipulate that the Court retains ultimate jurisdiction to enforce this \nAgreement, subject to the sunset provisions located throughout this Agreement, \nand will file a stipulation and proposed order to that effect.  \n2.  The Parties agree to submit any unresolved disputes to the mediation procedures \nin paragraphs II.O.3–4 prior to filing of any motions with the Court related to a \npost-settlement dispute. Should any dispute remain unresolved after completion \nof the mediation procedures set forth below, a class member may apply to the \n \n15 \n \n\n \nCase 2:17-cv-02092-ES-JSA   Document 136-2   Filed 04/11/22   Page 17 of 22 PageID: 1126\nCourt  for  enforcement  of  the  Agreement  only  through  Plaintiffs’  Counsel. \nDefendants may apply to the Court for enforcement of the Agreement if efforts \nto resolve disputes with Plaintiffs’ Counsel are unsuccessful. \n3.  For any disputes related to alleged DHS noncompliance,  \na.  DHS agrees to designate a point of contact (“DHS POC”) for dispute-\nresolution purposes: DongSettlement@dhs.gov. No request for dispute \nresolution may be submitted to DHS prior to the Effective Date. \nb.  If a class member believes that DHS Defendants have not materially \ncomplied with this Agreement on a matter relating to DHS, such class \nmember shall submit a written request to the DHS POC outlining the \nreasons for the alleged noncompliance.  \nc.  The DHS POC will coordinate with the relevant DHS components or \nprograms to resolve the issue.  \nd.  Such DHS POC shall provide a written response via email to the class \nmember or, if represented, his  or her counsel, within 30 days if the \nindividual is not detained by DHS or facing imminent removal from the \nUnited States. If the individual is detained by DHS or facing imminent \nremoval from the United States, DHS POC shall provide a written response \nvia email or personal service to the class member or, if represented, his or \nher counsel, within 15 days.  \ne.  In no case will an individual be removed from the United States by ICE \nprior to ICE OPLA’s review and resolution of any claimed non-compliance \nwith this Agreement.  \n4.  For any disputes related to alleged DOS noncompliance, \na.  DOS designates its LegalNet (LegalNet@state.gov) as the point of contact \n(“DOS POC”) for dispute-resolution purposes. Contact information for the \nDOS POC will be provided in the Notice issued to class members under \nparagraph II.B. The Notice will advise class members that no request for \ndispute resolution may be submitted to DOS prior to the Effective Date. \nb.  If a class member believes that DOS Defendants have not materially \ncomplied with this Agreement on a matter relating to DOS, such class \nmember shall submit a written request to the DOS POC outlining the \nreasons for the alleged noncompliance. \nc.  The DOS POC will coordinate with the relevant DOS components or \nprograms to resolve the issue. \nd.  Such DOS POC shall provide a written response via email to the class \nmember or, if represented, his or her counsel within 60 days. \n \n16 \n \n\n \nCase 2:17-cv-02092-ES-JSA   Document 136-2   Filed 04/11/22   Page 18 of 22 PageID: 1127\n5.  If a claim of class membership for any putative class member is disputed by the \nParties, the party seeking to prove class membership shall provide Defendants \nwith evidence of enrollment in UNNJ. \nP.  Reporting Requirements. Defendants agree to submit reports to Plaintiffs’ Counsel \nsetting forth the progress of implementing this Agreement.  \n1.  Defendants shall submit reports to Plaintiffs’ Counsel every 60 days for the first \n180 days following the Agreement’s Effective Date and every 90 days thereafter, \nsubject  to  the  provisions  below.  Such  reports  shall  include  the  following \ninformation: \na.

Defendants’ reporting obligations under this paragraph shall terminate when all \napplications filed under paragraphs II.I and II.J.9 have been fully adjudicated, or \ntwo years after the Effective Date, whichever is sooner.  \nQ. Attorneys’ Fees and Costs.  \n1.  The Parties stipulate that Plaintiffs will receive fees and costs under the Equal \nAccess to Justice Act (“EAJA”) in an amount equaling $450,000.00.  \na.  Plaintiffs agree that they may not seek any fees or costs in excess of that \namount,  except  for  any  fees  or  costs  associated  with  post-settlement \nenforcement of this Agreement.  \nb.

By executing this Agreement, Defendants do not admit that Plaintiffs’ EAJA \nclaim is meritorious or that Defendants were not substantially justified, in law or \nfact, in the litigation position advanced throughout the pendency of this action \nbefore the U.S. District Court and the appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nThird Circuit.  \n3.  If this Agreement is executed by the Parties and approved by the Court, no \nNamed Plaintiff or class member shall be entitled to recover any costs or fees \nexcept for post-settlement enforcement of this Agreement as provided in this \nparagraph, and the Named Plaintiffs/class representatives agree that they will not \nfile a motion for EAJA fees.  \n4.  Pursuant to the Named Plaintiffs’ independently executed Assignments of Fees \nin favor of Plaintiffs’ Counsel—which assign all attorneys’ fees to Plaintiffs’ \nCounsel  and  have  been  provided  to  Defendants—the  Parties  agree  that \nDefendants shall remit payment in full satisfaction of any and all claims for \nattorney’s fees in this matter by disbursement to Plaintiffs’ Counsel.  \na.  Payment under this paragraph will be made to Kurzban, Kurzban, Tetzeli \nand Pratt, Trust Account.  \nb.

On or before the date that this Agreement is executed, Plaintiffs’ Counsel \nshall  provide  to  Defendants’  Counsel  all  information  necessary  to \neffectuate this payment by electronic funds transfer.  \nd.  In the event of any disputes related to this paragraph, the Parties agree to \nparticipate in mediation to resolve the dispute. \nR.  Release of Claims and Preservation of Defenses.  \n1.  The Plaintiffs (including Named Plaintiffs and all class members) agree that \nDefendants shall be released from the Released Equitable Claims and Released \nMoney Damages Claims pursuant to the terms and provisions of this Agreement \nand have agreed to the dismissal with prejudice of this Action and all Released \nEquitable Claims and Released Money Damages Claims.  \na.  The  term  “Released  Equitable  Claims”  includes  all  claims,  demands, \nrights, liabilities and causes of action for declaratory or equitable relief, \nincluding injunctive relief, known or unknown, that: (1) relate to UNNJ \nenrollment; and (2) existed prior to the Effective Date of this Agreement, \nand which were or could have been alleged in the action based on the same \ncommon nucleus of operative facts alleged and the arguments made by the \nnamed Plaintiffs in the Action.  \nb.

ROMAN, et al.,\nDefendants.\nLINARES, ChiefDistrict Judge.\nThis matter comes before the Court by way of Defendants’ Thomas D. Roman (Acting\nDirector of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement), John F. Kelly (U.S. Secretary of\nHomeland Security), and James McCarnent (Acting Director ofU.S. Citizenship and Immigration\nServices) (collectively “Defendants”) motion to dismiss Plaintiffs First Amended Complaint\n(“FAC”) pursuant to Rule 12(b)(l) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (ECF No. 32).\nPlaintiffs have submitted opposition to Defendants’ motion, (ECF No. 44), and Defendants\nsubmitted a reply brief, (ECF No. 48). The Court has considered the parties’ submissions and\ndecides this matter without oral argument pursuant to Rule 78 of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure. For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants the Motion to Dismiss and dismisses\nPlaintiffs Complaint without prejudice.\nBACKGROUND’\nThis background is derived from Plaintiffs’ Complaint, which the Court must accept as true at this stage of the\nproceedings. SeeAlston v. Countiywide fin. Corp., 585 F.3d 753, 758 (3d Cir. 2009).\n\nallow them to fttrther their education in the U.S and obtain lawful work-study employment. (ECF\nNo. $ (“FAC”) ¶j 2—4). To enroll in UNNJ, Plaintiffs went through academicbrokers. (FAC ¶j\n3—4). Unbeknownst to Plaintiffs, UNNJ was a fake university created by Immigration and\nCustoms Enforcement (“ICE”) as part ofa sting operation to investigate and prosecute academic\nbrokers who ICE believed were committing visa fraud. (FAC ¶J 5). ICE took extensive steps to\nmake UNNJ appear legitimate, including a website, social media activity, and staffing it with an\nactive President, “Dr. Steven Brunetti, Ph.D.” (FAC ¶ 6). ICE shut down UNNJ in April 2016,\narrested twenty one academic brokers, and then began terminating the student status ofPlaintiffs\nand all other foreign students who had enrolled at UNNJ for their “fraudulent enrollment.” (FAC\n¶ 8). In fact, at no point before ICE teniiinated their student status, did Plaintiffs know that UNNJ\nwas not a legitimate school, as they were repeatedly assured by both UNNJ and their agents that\nthe university was legitimate. (FAC ¶ 9).\nBased on ICE’s fraud determination, each of the five plaintiffs have had their visas\nterminated and have pending applications for reinstatement. (FAC ¶ 51, 56, 62, 66, 70).\nFollowing these events, Plaintiffs filed suit against Defendants in this Court alleging four related\nclaims: (1) a “blanket” finding of fraudulent enrollment was made without affording Plaintiffs\nprocedural due process; (ii) the “blanket” fraud finding was “arbitrary and capricious” under the\nAdministrativeProcedures Act (“APA”); (iii) the termination ofPlaintiffs’ F-i status was arbitrary\nand capricious under the APA; and (iv) Defendants should be estopped from relying on Plaintiffs’\nenrollment in UNNJ as a basis for finding that they committed fraud or denial oftheir immigrant\n2 Plaintiffs initiallybroughtthisactiononNovember 18, 2016. (SeeECFNo. 1 (“Compi.”)). Subsequently.Plaintiffs\namended the complaint on December 9, 2016. (See FAC). Therefore, the relevant pleadings for this case will be\ntaken from FAC.\n2\n\nbenefits. (FAC ¶J 83—86 (Count I); 87—89 (Count II); 90—93 (Count III); 94—97 (Count IV)).\nPlaintiffs now seek injunctive and declarative relief. (See FAC at 27 (“reliefrequested”)).\nLEGAL STANDARD\nUnder Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules ofCivil Procedure, a Defendant may move to\ndismiss a complaint for lack ofsubject-rnatterjurisdiction. fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(l). The Plaintiff,\nas theparty assertingjurisdiction, bears theburden to establish the federal court’s authorityto hear\nthe matter. Packard v. Provident Nat’l Bank, 994 F.2d 1039, 1045 (3d Cir. 1993). However,\ndepending on the nature ofthe attack under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), which may either assert a\nfactual or facial challenge to the court’s jurisdiction, a presumption oftruthfulness may attach to\nthe plaintiffs allegations. See Taliaferro V. Darby Thp. Zoning 3d., 458 F. 3d 181, 188 (3d Cir.\n2006); GouldElectronics Inc. v. UnitedStates, 220 F.3d 169, 176 (3d Cir. 2000); Turicentro, S.A.\nv. American Airlines, Inc., 303 F. 3d 293, 300 n. 4 (3d Cir. 2002). When a defendant facially\nattacks the Court’sjurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1), this type ofchallenge contests the adequacy\nofthe language used in thepleading; the trial court must therefore construe the pleadings in a light\nmost favorable to the plaintiffand presume all well-pleaded factual allegations in the complaint as\ntrue. Turicentro, 303 F. 3d 293, 300 n. 4; Gould, 2201 F.3d at 176. Alternatively, when bringing\na factual attack, the defendant contends that the facts on which the plaintiffs allegations rely are\nnot true. Id. Therefore, the plaintiffs allegations do not benefit from a presumption of\ntruthfulness. The court, instead, must weigh the evidence in its discretion by taking into account\naffidavits, documents, and even limited evidentiaryhearings. Id.\nANALYSIS\nPlaintiffs purport to assert a varietyofclaims throughout the FAC. Construing the FAC in\na light most favorable to Plaintiffs. the Court understands that Plaintiffs’ causes ofaction arise out\n3\n\nofICE terminating their student status and deemingtheir enrollment is fraudulent. However, these\nclaims turn on whether ICE’s detennination qualified as a “final agency action” and whether this\ncase is ripe for review. Below, the Court addresses these issues and dismisses the FAC without\nprejudice.\nA. Final Agency Action\nThis Court finds that Plaintiffs have not alleged a final agency action because their\napplications forreinstatement are still pending. The APA outlines the power and scope ofjudicial\nreview over administrative regulations promulgated by agencies ofthe United States. 5 U.S.C. §\n701 et seq. Significantly, the APA provides that only “final agency action[s] or “action[s] made\nreviewable by statute are subject tojudicial review. Id. at § 704. Unless a statute provides that an\nagency action is directly reviewable in federal court, a plaintiffseeking relieffor an agency action\nmust first exhaust all available administrative remedies. See 5 U.S.C. § 704; see also Myers v.\nBethlehem Corp., 303 U.S. 41, 50—51 (193$) (noting the “long-settled rule of judicial\nadministration that no one is entitled to judicial relief for a supposed threat or injury until the\nprescribed administrative remedyhas been exhausted.”). Additionally, and relevanthere, an initial\nadministrative action that begins an investigation or other administrativeproceeding is not a “final\nagencyaction.” SeeFTCv. Standard Oil Co. ofCat., 449 U.S. 232, 239 (1980); Hindes v. F.D.I.C.,\n137 F.3d 148, 154 (3d Cir. 199$).\nPlaintiffs argue that ICE’s decision to terminate their student status for the nonexistent\nUNNJ is a final agency action. (ECF No. 32 at 14). However, the initial decision ofterminating\nPlaintiffs’ visas cannot be seen as “final” given that ICE is currently in the process ofdeciding if\nPlaintiffs are entitled to reinstatement oftheir visas. The reinstatement application makes ICE’s\ninitial determination more akin to the beginning ofan administrative proceeding than enacting a\n4\n\nfinal action. (ECF No. 32 at 16). Any decisions by this court regarding the fraudulent enrollment\nwould inherently interfere with the ICE process. Thus, as ofnow, there is no final administrative\naction for Plaintiffto assert any oftheir claims against.\nB. Ripeness\nAdditionally, Plaintiffs’ claims are not ripe for review. The ripeness doctrine “serves to\ndetermine whether a party has brought an action prematurely and counsel’s abstention until such\ntime as a dispute is sufficiently concrete to satisfy the constitutional and pntdential requirements\nof the doctrine.” Khodara Envtt., Inc. v. Blakev, 376 F.3d 187, 196 (3d Cir.2004) (quoting\nFeachiurn v. City ofYork, 333 f.3d 429, 433 (3d Cir.2003)). By abstaining from deciding a case\nuntil it is ripe, a court ensures that it will decide only “a real and substantial controversy admitting\nofspecific reliefthrough a decree ofa conclusivecharacter.” Surrickv. Ku/ion, 449 F.3d 520, 527\n(3d Cir.2006). To determine whether a case is ripe, courts “generally examine: ‘(1) the fitness of\nthe issues for judicial decision, and (2) the hardship to the parties of withholding court\nconsideration.” Khodara Envtl., Inc. Blakev, 376 F.3d 187, 196 (3d Cir.2004) (quoting\ni’.\nFeachium, 333 F.3d at 434).\nThe case before the Court is not fit for judicial review because Plaintiffs are seeking the\nsame determination whether their enrollments were fraudulent that they are already seeking\n— —\nfrom theirpending applications. Moreover, since ICE proceedings are ongoing, the record before\nthis Court is incomplete, and this Court must wait for the agency’s determination. Furthermore,\nas Defendant correctlypoints out, immediatehardship cannot be shown because the administrative\nproceeding will likely be resolved in the coming months without any action needed from this\nCourt. (ECF No. 32 at 22). Therefore, Plaintiffs’ claims also fail on ripeness grounds.\n5\n\nproceeding will likely be resolved in the coming months without any action needed from this\nCourt. (ECF No. 32 at 22). Therefore, Plaintiffs’ claims also fail on ripeness grounds.\nCONCLUSIONS\nfor the reasons above, the Court grants Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss without\nprejudice. An appropriate Order accompanies this Opinion.\nJudge, United States District Court\nDate: October 2017\n6",
