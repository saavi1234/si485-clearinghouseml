    "summary": "<p>The suit challenged a settlement agreement between the Trump Administration and the University of Notre Dame to deny students, employees, and their dependents insurance coverage of contraceptive care guaranteed to them by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The lawsuit also challenged the Trump administration&rsquo;s interim final rules announced in October 2017 that would have allowed virtually any employer or university to refuse to comply with the ACA contraceptive coverage requirement. On June 26, 2018, the National Women&rsquo;s Law Center, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, the Center for Reproductive Rights, and a private firm filed this suit on behalf of Notre Dame student group Irish 4 Reproductive Health and others insured under Notre Dame&rsquo;s health plans. The plaintiffs filed the lawsuit against U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Labor, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the University of Notre Dame. The plaintiffs sued in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana, alleging that the settlement agreement and interim final rules violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), was void for illegality, and violated the First Amendment&rsquo;s Establishment Clause, and their Fifth Amendment due process and equal protection clauses. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prohibit Notre Dame from implementing the settlement agreement; they also sought nominal damages of $1.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to Judge Philip P. Simon and Magistrate Judge Michael G. Gotsch, Sr.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In their complaint, the plaintiffs first asserted that the settlement agreement was not in accordance with the Supreme Court's rulings in <em>Zubik v. Burwell</em>, 136 S. Ct. 1557 (2016) and Univ. of <em>Notre Dame v. Burwell</em>, 136 S. Ct. 2007 (2016), because those orders required the government defendants to resolve legal challenges to the ACA contraceptive coverage requirement in a manner that accommodated the institutions religious exercise while at the same time ensuring that people covered by the institutions health plans received full and equal health coverage, including contraceptive coverage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In response to the Trump Administration issuing their final rules on November 15, 2018, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on December 5, 2018. This amended complaint reflected that the plaintiffs were now challenging the final rules instead of the interim rules.</p>\r\n<p>On January 16, 2020, Judge Simon issued an opinion granting in part and denying in part two February 12, 2019, motions to dismiss, one filed by Notre Dame and the other by the federal defendants. Both motions moved to dismiss all claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted; the federal defendants also had moved to dismiss the case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Judge Simon rejected the defendants&rsquo; argument that the court lacked jurisdiction because the plaintiffs had access to alternative remedies in their constitutional claims. Judge Simon elaborated that the defendants&rsquo; position was not supported by case law, and he permitted the plaintiffs&rsquo; APA claims to proceed. Judge Simon also disagreed the defendants&rsquo; assertion that the non-student plaintiffs had an adequate alternative remedy under ERISA because the settlement agreement prevented any other mechanism for redress.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Second, Judge Simon addressed the defendants&rsquo; claim that the court lacked jurisdiction because the settlement agreement was an exercise of enforcement discretion that was committed to agency discretion by law and therefore not reviewable by the court. He agreed with the plaintiffs&rsquo; contention that the settlement agreement was a conscious and express adoption of a general policy to authorize Notre Dame to circumvent the contraceptive coverage requirement. The defendants had argued that the agreement was merely a single-shot decision that is commonly within agencies&rsquo; discretion. However, Judge Simon rejected this reasoning because the agreement involved 74 other entities, and affected the more than 17,000 people covered by Notre Dame&rsquo;s health plan.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Third, Judge Simon addressed the defendants&rsquo; last jurisdictional claim that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the final rules because Notre Dame&rsquo;s refusal to provide contraceptive coverage was based only on the settlement agreement, and the plaintiffs could not establish standing by speculating that Notre Dame might one day rely on the final rules to take an action that might harm the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs had standing because Notre Dame seemed to be relying on both the final rules and the settlement agreement to support its contraceptive decisions, which were harming the plaintiffs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Next, Judge Simon turned to the defendants&rsquo; motions to dismiss the suit for failure to state a claim. He permitted the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims to proceed: that the settlement agreement was void for illegality, the final rules violated the procedural and substantive requirements of the APA, and the rules and agreement violated the plaintiffs&rsquo; First Amendment establishment clause rights. Separately, he dismissed their Fifth Amendment due process and equal protection claims. Judge Simon also refused to accept Notre Dame&rsquo;s contention that the settlement agreement claims were not ripe; the plaintiffs were experiencing harm at the time and their claims were addressing an active controversy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Judge Simon further additionally ruled that the plaintiffs had pleaded substantial facts that the final rules violated the APA because the agencies had not solicited and considered public comments prior to promulgating the interim final rules. Regarding the substantive requirements of the APA, the court explained that the government failed to provide an adequate explanation for its abrupt departure from first requiring objecting entities to request an accommodation, to giving Notre Dame a complete pass from providing contraceptive care&mdash;the plaintiffs stated a plausible claim that the final rules were arbitrary and capricious.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Regarding the constitutional claims, Judge Simon held that the plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged that the final rules and settlement agreement both violated the First Amendment by impermissibly endorsing religious beliefs and practices which the plaintiffs and other affected people do not follow and thereby imposing on them costs, burdens, and harms arising from the granting of religious exemptions from the ACA. Contrasting the fundamental right to obtain contraception with the right to subsidized contraceptive coverage, Judge Simon ruled that the plaintiffs Fifth Amendment due process allegation failed to state a claim because the plaintiffs had not pleaded violation of a fundamental right or liberty. Furthermore, he dismissed the plaintiffs&rsquo; Fifth Amendment equal protection claim because they had not cited any authority suggesting that declining to subsidize contraception constituted a sex-based equal protection violation. 434 F.Supp.3d 683.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Litigation concerning this issue proceeded throughout the country and in other courts. In <em>Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter &amp; Paul Home v. Pennsylvania</em>, 140 U.S. 2367 (2020), the Supreme Court upheld the Trump Administration&rsquo;s exemptions to the ACA&rsquo;s contraceptive mandate, holding the departments did have authority under the ACA to promulgate the religious and moral exemptions, and finding the rules were free from any procedural defects. In doing so, the Supreme Court signaled that harm to third parties would no longer serve as a check on those religious accommodations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In response to these developments in other cases, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on August 20, 2020. This second amended complaint was narrower than the previous one and only asserted four causes of action. They claimed the federal defendants&rsquo; settlement agreement violated the APA, the final rules violated the substantive requirements of the APA, and the settlement agreement and final rules violated the First Amendment&rsquo;s Establishment Clause. Their fourth claim, leveled against all the defendants, was that the settlement agreement was void for illegality.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Discovery continued until Judge Simon ruled to grant the defendants&rsquo; September 21, 2020, motions to dismiss on August 12, 2021. Judge Simon dismissed the claims relating to the settlement agreement, ruling that the challenges to the settlement agreement were no longer ripe. He reasoned that, in light of the Supreme Court upholding the final rules, the settlement agreement itself wasn&rsquo;t causing injury to the plaintiffs because Notre Dame was exempt from the contraceptive coverage mandate under the final rules. However, Judge Simon dismissed these claims without prejudice because the final rules could still be struck down at some point in the future, and if they were, the settlement agreement would impede the plaintiffs from getting the contraceptive services they would then be otherwise entitled to.</p>\r\n<p>Turning to the plaintiffs Establishment Clause claims, Judge Simon reversed course from his previous decision. Relying on new case law, the court held that the plaintiffs failed to show that the rules violated the First Amendment. He pointed to <em>Massachusetts v. United States Department of Health and Human Services</em>, 513 F.Supp.3d 215, which found the government did not intend to advance a particular religion or to promote religion in general and concluded the departments tried to maintain neutrality and reduce interference with religious in promulgating the final rules. Judge Simon agreed, holding that the rules did not have the primary purpose of promoting, advancing, and endorsing religion, and dismissed the First Amendment claim with prejudice.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Finally, Judge Simon did not consider the defendants motion to dismiss the plaintiffs&rsquo; claim that the rules were arbitrary and capricious because the federal defendants removed this issue from consideration at this dismissal stage when they filed a motion for summary judgment on October 9, 2020. This claim remains pending. 554 F.Supp.3d 967.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The presidential administration change in early 2021 changed the posture of the case. On August 25, 2021, Judge Simon granted the parties&rsquo; joint motion to stay proceedings, because on August 16, the federal defendants announced that they intended to initiate a rulemaking regarding the contraceptive coverage requirement within six months. On February 15, 2022, the defendants issued a status report stating that they would be unable to meet their anticipated target to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking by mid-February 2022. The plaintiffs and defendants agreed to keep the case in its current posture. This case is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>",

The plaintiffs were represented by the National Women’s Law Center, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, the Center for Reproductive Rights, and a private firm. The plaintiffs alleged that the settlement agreement and final rules violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and their First and Fifth Amendment rights. On January 16, 2020, the court granted in part and denied in part two motions to dismiss filed by the defendants; the court permitted the plaintiffs' APA and First Amendment claims to proceed, and dismissed their Fifth Amendment allegations. Litigation surrounding the ACA's contraception mandate waged throughout the country, and in response to legal developments the court granted new motions to dismiss filed by the defendants on August 12, 2021. The only remaining claim the could allowed the plaintiffs to pursue was their APA claim that the rules were arbitrary and capricious. After the presidential administration change in early 2021, on August 25, 2021, Judge Simon granted the parties’ joint motion to stay proceedings, because on August 16, the federal defendants announced that they intended to initiate a rulemaking regarding the contraceptive coverage requirement.

This case is a challenge to actions by the United States Departments of Health and \nHuman Services, Labor, and the Treasury (the “Departments”), and the University of Notre Dame \nthat will harm at least tens of thousands of people nationwide, including at Notre Dame.  If \nDefendants’ conduct is not enjoined, these people—including the four individual Plaintiffs and \nmembers of Plaintiff Irish 4 Reproductive Health—will lose meaningful access to contraceptive \n1 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 2 of 46\n \nservices, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, the Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act of 2010, and the First and Fifth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. \n2.  The ACA requires group health plans and health-insurance issuers to cover, \nwithout cost-sharing, a range of preventive health services.  Recognizing that women historically \nhave been required to pay more money out-of-pocket than men for health care, including for \ncontraception and related services, Congress expressly required the inclusion of women’s \npreventive services among the benefits that health plans must cover without copays or other cost-\nsharing.  Since 2011, the Departments’ controlling regulations have clarified that these services \nmust include contraception and related patient education and counseling, without cost-sharing.   \n3.   The regulations currently in effect contain an exemption from the ACA’s \ncontraceptive coverage requirement for houses of worship. The regulations also contain an \n“accommodation” for certain employers and universities that have religious objections to \ncontraceptive coverage and meet certain criteria.   Through the accommodation process, an \nobjecting employer or university may inform the government, or the entity’s insurer or third-party \nadministrator, that it has religious objections to providing coverage for contraceptive services. \nThe entity’s insurance issuer then fulfills its legal obligation by separately providing payments for \ncontraceptive services.  The long-standing regulations thus ensure that women1 covered by health \nplans at objecting employers or universities obtain the full range of U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration-approved contraceptives guaranteed to them by law, while at the same time \n                                                 \n1 This Complaint uses the term “women” because the individual Plaintiffs are women and \nbecause the Rules and settlements at issue target women.  The denial of reproductive health care \nand insurance coverage for that care, however, also affects individuals who may not identify as \nwomen, including some gender-nonconforming individuals and transgender men. \n2 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 3 of 46\n \nrelieving employers and universities with religious objections of their obligation to cover \ncontraception in their health insurance plans.   \n4.  Now the Departments seek to eviscerate the ACA’s contraceptive coverage \nrequirement, to the detriment of Plaintiffs and countless others nationwide.  There is no legitimate \nbasis for these actions.  Indeed, Defendants’ unlawful actions come on the heels of failed attempts \nby Defendant Notre Dame and others to challenge the accommodation process in court:  Eight of \nthe nine federal courts of appeals to consider such challenges flatly rejected them—including the \nSeventh Circuit, twice, in a case brought by Notre Dame.  And the United States Supreme Court \nremanded all the cases to be resolved in a manner that “ensur[es] that women covered by [the \nentities’] health plans receive full and equal health coverage, including contraceptive coverage.”  \nZubik v. Burwell, 136 S. Ct. 1557, 1560 (2016); see also, e.g., Univ. of Notre Dame v. Burwell, \n136 S.Ct. 2007 (Mem.).   \n5.  By their actions, the Departments have embarked on a two-tiered effort to do by \nfiat what the courts had refused to allow: give employers and universities a veto over the legal \nrights of countless women to obtain coverage of necessary health care. \n6.  First, on October 6, 2017, with total disregard for the Administrative Procedure \nAct’s procedural requirements, the Departments issued two Interim Final Rules that allow all \nnongovernmental entities—including for-profit businesses, non-profits, and universities—to \ndeclare themselves exempt from the ACA contraceptive coverage requirement based on religious \nbeliefs, and allow most such entities to exempt themselves based on so-called “moral \nconvictions.”2  The Interim Final Rules also make the accommodation process optional.  In other \n                                                 \n2 These Rules were issued and went into effect on October 6, 2017 and were published in the \nFederal Register on October 13.  Religious Exemptions and Accommodations for Coverage of \n3 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 4 of 46\n \nwords, the Rules allow such entities to impose their religious and moral beliefs on countless \nwomen by preventing employees, students, and their dependents from receiving contraceptive \ncoverage.  \n7.  Second, on October 13, 2017, just one week after issuing the Rules, the \nDepartments executed a private settlement agreement with more than 70 entities, including Notre \nDame, resolving the signatories’ pending legal challenges to the ACA accommodation process, \nwith terms that echo the Rules’ unlawful religious and moral exemptions and then extend the \nscope of those exemptions even further.  See Exhibit A.  In direct contravention of legal \nrequirements and long-standing Department of Justice policy, the Settlement Agreement \nimpermissibly negotiates away the rights of third parties by purporting permanently to exempt the \nsignatories from all contraceptive coverage requirements, both past and future.  Even though the \nUniversity admits that “most of [the 17,000 people] covered [by its health plans] have no \nfinancially feasible alternative but to rely on the University for such coverage,”3 the Settlement \nAgreement allows Notre Dame to deny them contraceptive coverage in their regular health plan.  \nThe Settlement Agreement also awards the signatories millions of taxpayer dollars in attorneys’ \nfees. \n8.  In December 2017, two federal courts preliminarily enjoined the Rules nationwide.  \nSee Pennsylvania v. Trump, 281 F. Supp. 3d 553 (2017); California v. HHS, 281 F. Supp. 3d 806 \n(2017).  Nevertheless, on February 7, 2018, Notre Dame announced that it will no longer abide by \nthe ACA’s contraceptive coverage requirement.  Citing the Settlement Agreement as support, the \n                                                 \nCertain Preventative Services Under the Affordable Care Act, 82 Fed. Reg. 47,792 (Oct. 13, \n2017); Moral Exemptions and Accommodations for Coverage of Certain Preventative Services \nUnder the Affordable Care Act, 82 Fed. Reg. 47,838 (Oct. 13, 2017) (collectively, the “Rules”). \n3 Letter to Faculty and Staff by President Rev. John I. Jenkins, C.S.C. (Feb. 7, 2018). \n4 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 5 of 46\n \nUniversity declared that it will change its faculty and student insurance policies to decline to \ncover the full range of FDA-approved contraceptives and related services as required by the ACA.  \nStill further, the University will subject the limited remaining covered contraceptives to co-pays \nand deductibles, also in contravention of the ACA.  In other words, the University announced that \nit will impose its own views about contraception on the 17,000 people covered by its health plans, \nand will do so in ways that are prohibited by the ACA and enjoined by two federal courts.  By \nexcluding some methods of contraceptives altogether and imposing cost-sharing on other \nmethods,  the University will strip women of the contraceptive coverage guaranteed to them by \nlaw and erect financial, administrative, and logistical barriers to contraception.  \n9.  The Rules and the Settlement Agreement thus harm Plaintiffs and other women, \nwho will be discriminated against, incur greater costs, and be deterred or prevented from using the \nmost appropriate method of contraception for them.  Some women will be unable to obtain \ncontraception altogether.  The Rules and the Settlement Agreement thereby deprive Plaintiffs and \nother women of their constitutional right to make fundamental reproductive decisions consistent \nwith their own values and beliefs.  Instead of respecting that right, the Rules and the Settlement \nAgreement impose the religious beliefs of a select few on individuals who may not share those \nbeliefs, and reinstate the discrimination against women that the ACA’s contraceptive coverage \nrequirement addressed.  \n10.  Allowing employers and universities to deny women access to contraceptive \ncoverage violates federal law, the U.S. Constitution, and the directive of the U.S. Supreme Court. \n11.  For these reasons and others described below, this Court should invalidate and \nenjoin the Rules, enjoin Defendants from enforcing or relying on the Rules, declare the \nSettlement Agreement between Notre Dame and the Departments void, and enjoin Defendants \n5 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 6 of 46\n \nfrom enforcing or relying on the Settlement Agreement with respect to Notre Dame and the health \nplans it sponsors. \n \nPARTIES \n12.  Plaintiff Irish 4 Reproductive Health (“I4RH”) is an unincorporated association of \nundergraduate and graduate students in South Bend, Indiana who attend Notre Dame.  The \norganization’s mission is to advocate for reproductive justice on campus and in the surrounding \ncommunity, including by securing access to insurance coverage of the full range of FDA-\napproved contraceptive methods and related services, education, and counseling, with no out-of-\npocket costs.  I4RH promotes human dignity by affording respect to all people to make moral \nchoices about their own lives, including whether and when to have children.  I4RH recognizes \nthat sexual health is essential for overall well-being, and that access to reproductive health care, \neducation, and resources is necessary for realizing social, political, and gender equality—both at \nthe University and around the globe.  The students who would eventually form I4RH began \norganizing in the wake of the upheaval and uncertainty over the future of contraceptive coverage \nat the University.  Initially, the founding student members of I4RH came together to protest the \nUniversity’s October 2017 decision to terminate contraceptive coverage.  After the University \ntemporarily reversed that decision in early November 2017, the students continued to work to \nimprove and expand access to reproductive health care at the University and in the surrounding \ncommunity.  The students formed I4RH on February 7, 2018, in response to the University’s \nletter of that date announcing its current plan to terminate coverage for certain methods of \ncontraception.  Obtaining relief from Defendants’ unlawful Settlement Agreement and Rules is \nessential to realizing I4RH’s animating purpose and to further its broader mission of promoting \nand protecting reproductive health at the University and beyond.  Several members of I4RH will \n6 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 7 of 46\n \nbe personally harmed by the Settlement Agreement and the Rules.  For example: \na.  I4RH Member 1 is a graduate student at the University and lives in South \nBend, Indiana.  She is a woman of child-bearing age who is enrolled in the University’s student \nhealth-insurance plan and relies on that plan for all her medical needs, including contraceptives.  \nAlthough the University objects to contraceptive coverage, I4RH Member 1 receives it without \ncost-sharing through the accommodation process from Aetna Student Health.  I4RH Member 1 \nuses an oral contraceptive that she refills every four weeks to prevent pregnancy.  Through the \naccommodation process, Aetna has been covering the full cost of I4RH Member 1’s birth-control \npills.  The University has not yet released the 2018-19 student health-plan documents; based on \nthe prescription-drug benefits under the 2017-18 Aetna Student Health plan, however, if the \nUniversity’s announced change goes into effect, beginning in August 2018 I4RH Member 1 will \nhave to pay coinsurance of 20 percent of the negotiated charge of her prescription out of pocket \n(the 2017-18 coinsurance rate for covered generic prescription drugs).4   \nb.  I4RH Member 2 is a graduate student at the University and lives in South \nBend, Indiana.  She is a woman of child-bearing age who is enrolled in the University’s student \nhealth-insurance plan and relies on that plan for all her medical needs, including contraceptives.  \nAlthough the University objects to contraceptive coverage, Member 2 receives it without cost-\nsharing through the accommodation process from Aetna Student Health.  Since 2010, Member 2 \nhas used the NuvaRing, a hormonal contraceptive with no generic alternative, both to prevent \npregnancy and to reduce pain during menstruation, which she has experienced since suffering \ncomplications from a surgery.  Through the accommodation process, Aetna has been covering \n                                                 \n4 Aetna Student Health Plan PPO Schedule of Benefits, University of Notre Dame at 34-35, \nhttps://www.aetnastudenthealth.com/schools/notredame/masterpolicy1718-0815.pdf. \n7 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 8 of 46\n \nthe full cost of Member 2’s prescription.  Based on the 2017-18 Aetna Student Health plan, if the \nUniversity’s announced change goes into effect, beginning in August 2018 Member 2 will have \nto pay coinsurance of 40 percent of the negotiated charge of her NuvaRing out of pocket (the \n2017-18 coinsurance rate for covered brand name prescription drugs with no generic alternative).  \nTo avoid this added cost, Member 2 is switching to a hormonal long-acting intrauterine device \nwhile she still has coverage through the accommodation.  Member 2 does not know if the IUD \nwill have the same efficacy as the NuvaRing for controlling her menstrual pain.  Moreover, \nMember 2 previously suffered ocular migraines from using hormonal contraceptives other than \nthe NuvaRing, and she does not know whether switching to a hormonal IUD will cause her \nocular migraines to return.  After August 15, 2018, Member 2 will have to pay cost-sharing for \nremoval or replacement of the IUD and for help with complications should any occur, or she \nmay have no coverage for these services at all.   \nc.  All members of I4RH who rely on University-sponsored health insurance \nfor their contraceptive needs will be subject to the University’s new contraceptive coverage \npolicy.  Although the ACA requires the University to cover all FDA-approved contraceptive \nmethods for women without cost-sharing, all members of I4RH who rely on University health \ninsurance for their contraceptive needs will be subject to cost-sharing for some contraceptive \nmethods and will be deprived of coverage for other methods.  As all members of I4RH enrolled \nin University-sponsored health insurance will be subject to the same illegal University policy and \nseek the same form of relief, neither the claims asserted nor the relief requested requires the \nparticipation of individual members in this lawsuit. \n13.  Plaintiff Natasha Reifenberg is a recent graduate of the University and lives in \n8 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 9 of 46\n \nBoston, Massachusetts.5  She is a woman of child-bearing age who is enrolled as a dependent in \nthe University’s faculty and staff health plan administered by the University’s third-party \nadministrator, Meritain Health, and the University’s prescription-benefit manager, OptumRx.  Ms. \nReifenberg relies on that plan for all her medical needs.  Although the University objects to \ncontraceptive coverage, Ms. Reifenberg receives it without cost-sharing through the \naccommodation process administered by Meritain Health and OptumRx.  Ms. Reifenberg has \nused hormonal birth control in the past and plans to use her health plan to obtain a long-acting, \nreversible form of contraception going forward.  Ms. Reifenberg has not yet obtained a long-\nacting form of contraception because her OB-GYN relocated, and she is in the process of finding \na new doctor to provide this service.  Ms. Reifenberg will choose a doctor and make an \nappointment to obtain contraception in the upcoming months.  Beginning on July 1, however, Ms. \nReifenberg will have to pay cost-sharing for contraception and related services, including a long-\nacting reversible method of contraception, or she may have no coverage for her contraception at \nall.  Paying for a long-acting, reversible method of contraception would be a significant hardship \nfor Ms. Reifenberg.  Alternatively, Ms. Reifenberg now may not be able to obtain a long-acting, \nreversible method of contraception after all, because she may not be able to afford the out-of-\npocket costs.   \n14.  Plaintiff Jane Doe 1 is a graduate student at the University and lives in South \nBend, Indiana.  She is a woman of child-bearing age who is enrolled in the University’s student \nhealth-insurance plan and relies on that plan for all her medical needs, including contraceptives.  \nAlthough the University objects to contraceptive coverage, Doe 1 receives it without cost-sharing \nthrough the accommodation process from Aetna Student Health.  Doe 1 uses an oral contraceptive \n                                                 \n5 Ms. Reifenberg expects to be moving to Chicago, Illinois within the next few months. \n9 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 10 of 46\n \nthat she refills every four weeks to prevent pregnancy.  Through the accommodation process, \nAetna has been covering the full cost of Doe 1’s oral contraception.  The University has not yet \nreleased the 2018-19 student-health-plan documents; based on the 2017-18 Aetna Student Health \nplan, however, if the University’s announced change goes into effect, beginning in August 2018, \nDoe 1 will have to pay coinsurance of 20 percent of the negotiated charge of her prescription out \nof pocket (the 2017-18 coinsurance rate for covered generic prescription drugs). \n15.  Plaintiff Jane Doe 2 is an undergraduate student at the University and lives in \nSouth Bend, Indiana.  She is a woman of child-bearing age who is enrolled as a dependent in the \nUniversity’s faculty and staff health plan administered by Meritain Health and OptumRx, and \nrelies on that plan for all her medical needs, including contraceptives.  Although the University \nobjects to contraceptive coverage, Doe 2 receives it without cost-sharing through the \naccommodation process administered by Meritain Health and OptumRx.  Doe 2 uses an oral \ncontraceptive both for non-contraceptive medical purposes and to prevent pregnancy.  Through \nthe accommodation process, OptumRx has been covering the full cost of Doe 2’s prescription.  \nBeginning in July 2018, however, Doe 2 will have to pay a co-payment every four weeks for her \ncontraception.  Jane Doe 2 suffers from significant health issues that require regular out-of-pocket \nexpenses.  The addition of another monthly out-of-pocket cost for her contraception, which was \nprescribed to her as treatment for non-contraceptive purposes as well as to prevent pregnancy, \nwill likely force her to forgo some services on which she relies to treat her health needs. \n16.  Plaintiff Jane Doe 3 is a graduate student at another university and lives in \nMassachusetts.  She is a woman of child-bearing age who is enrolled as a dependent in Notre \nDame’s faculty and staff health plan administered by Meritain Health and OptumRx, and relies on \nthat plan for all her medical needs, including contraceptives.  Although the University objects to \n10 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 11 of 46\n \ncontraceptive coverage, Doe 3 receives it without cost-sharing through the accommodation \nprocess administered by Meritain Health and OptumRx.  Doe 3 has been relying on oral \ncontraception since 2013 that she refills every four weeks to prevent pregnancy, to control acne, \nand to regulate her menstrual cycle.  Through the accommodation process, OptumRx has been \ncovering the full cost of Doe 3’s oral contraception.  Beginning in July 2018, Doe 3 will have to \npay a co-payment for her contraception. \n17.

The Government Defendants are United \nStates agencies and officers sued in their official capacities.  I4RH and Does 1 and 2 reside in this \njudicial district, and all the Plaintiffs get their health coverage through the University student and \nfaculty plans. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nThe Importance of Contraception \n21.  Regardless of their religious affiliation, 99% of women of reproductive age who \nhave had sexual intercourse report using at least one form of contraception at some point in their \nlives.  K. Daniels, W.D. Mosher & J. Jones, Contraceptive Methods Women Have Ever Used: \nUnited States, 1982–2010, National Health Statistics Reports, 2013, No. 62. \n22.  Contraception is critical to women’s and children’s health.   \n23.  Research has also shown that access to contraception improves the social and \neconomic status of women. \n12 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 13 of 46\n \n24.  Contraception reduces unintended pregnancies, the need for abortion, adverse \npregnancy outcomes, and negative health consequences to women and children.  Inst. of Med., \nClinical Preventive Services for Women, Closing the Gaps, (“IOM Report”) at 102-109 (July 19, \n2011).6   \n25.  Contraception prevents unintended pregnancy, which can have severe negative \nconsequences for both women and their children.   \n26.  During an unintended pregnancy, a woman is more likely to receive delayed or no \nprenatal care, to be depressed, and to suffer from domestic violence.  Id. at 103.   \n27.  An unintended pregnancy may result in preterm birth and low birth weight.  Id. \n28.  Contraception allows women to postpone pregnancy and optimally space their \nchildren to avoid adverse consequences (e.g., low birth weight, premature birth) associated with \nmore than one pregnancy in 18 months.  Id. at 103. \n29.  Contraception is highly effective in treating and preventing certain health \nconditions.   \n30.  Contraception decreases the risk of certain cancers (such as endometrial and \novarian cancer), manages menstrual disorders, and protects against pelvic inflammatory disease \nand some breast diseases.  Id. at 107.     \n31.  In addition, pregnancy may be dangerous to some women with certain chronic \nmedical conditions, such as diabetes, obesity, pulmonary hypertension, or heart disease.  Id. at \n103.   \n32.  When pregnancy is contraindicated, women may need contraception to delay \n                                                 \n6 As of July 1, 2015, IOM changed its name to the National Academy of Medicine. It is part of \nthe National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, which advise the nation on \nmatters of science, technology, and health.  \n13 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 14 of 46\n \npregnancy until their medical conditions are under control or to prevent pregnancy throughout \ntheir lives.  Id. at 103-4.   \n33.  In a national study conducted in 2017, 22% of women age 18-44 who use \ncontraception said that they used contraceptives to manage a medical condition and prevent \npregnancy; 13% used contraceptives solely to manage a medical condition.  Caroline Rosenzweig \net al., Kaiser Family Found., Women’s Sexual and Reproductive Health Services: Key Findings \nfrom the 2017 Kaiser Women’s Health Survey 3 (2018), http://files.kff.org/attachment/Issue-\nBrief-Womens-Sexual-and-Reproductive-Health-Services-Key-Findings-from-the-2017-Kaiser-\nWomens-Health-Survey. \n34.  Women also rely on contraception to prevent pregnancy following a sexual assault \nand to prevent or delay pregnancy during public-health crises, such as the outbreak of the Zika \nvirus. \n35.  Access to contraception has been proven to advance women’s equality and \nparticipation in the social and economic life of this country.   \n36.  Studies show that contraception is directly linked to women’s increased \neducational and professional opportunities and increased lifetime earnings.  See, e.g., Jennifer J. \nFrost & Laura Duberstein Lindberg, Reasons for Using Contraception: Perspectives of US \nWomen Seeking Care at Specialized Family Planning Clinics, 87 Contraception 465, 467 (2013); \nAdam Sonfield, et al., Guttmacher Inst., The Social and Economic Benefits of Women’s Ability to \nDetermine Whether and When to Have Children (2013), http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/social-\neconomic-benefits.pdf. \n37.  There are 18 methods of contraception for women approved by the FDA.  \nContraceptives vary in effectiveness, duration, side effects, methods of action, and ease of use. \n14 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 15 of 46\n \n38.  Not all women can tolerate all forms of contraception, and as the FDA has said:  \n“No one product is best for everyone.”  U.S. Food & Drug Admin., Birth Control Guide, \nhttps://www.fda.gov/downloads/ForConsumers/ByAudience/ForWomen/FreePublications/UCM5\n17406.pdf.   \n39.  Thus, women need insurance coverage of all FDA-approved methods, \ncontraceptive counseling, and education to find the most appropriate method for them.   \n40.  Women using contraception also need insurance coverage for associated services \nthat assist them in understanding their contraceptive options, such as counseling with a health-\ncare provider, and to ensure the effectiveness and safety of their chosen form of contraception.  \nCost Barriers Impede Access to Contraception \n41.  Cost is often an impediment to women’s obtaining contraception.   \n42.  Cost may influence women to avoid more effective but more expensive methods of \ncontraception or to forgo contraceptives altogether.   \n43.  Without insurance coverage, the most effective methods of contraception carry \nlarge up-front costs that make them unaffordable for many women.   \n44.  For example, without coverage, an IUD can cost up to $1,300.   \n45.  Studies show that the costs associated with contraception, even when small, lead \nwomen to forgo it completely, to choose less effective methods, or to use it inconsistently.  See, e.g., \nGuttmacher Inst., A Real-Time Look at the Impact of the Recession on Women’s Family Planning and \nPregnancy Decisions 5 (Sept. 2009), http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/RecessionFP.pdf.   \n46.  When costs lead women to forgo contraception completely, to choose less \neffective methods, or to use it inconsistently, there is an increased risk of unintended pregnancy.  \nSee, e.g., Rachel Benson Gold, The Need for and Cost of Mandating Private Insurance Coverage \n15 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 16 of 46\n \nfor Contraception, 1 Guttmacher Rep. on Pub. Pol’y 5, 6 (1998).   \n47.  Cost barriers to contraception in and of themselves not only threaten the economic \nsecurity of women and their families, but in undermining access to contraception, they also \nthreaten women’s long-term financial well-being, job security, workforce participation, and \neducational attainment.     \nThe ACA and the Contraceptive Coverage Requirement \n48.  Since the ACA was passed by Congress and signed by the President in March \n2010, it has extended accessible and affordable health-insurance coverage to millions of \nAmericans and reduced sex discrimination in health care.   \n49.  To ensure that health insurance remains accessible and affordable, the ACA \ncontains a number of critical provisions.   \n50.  Among these provisions is the requirement that group health plans include \ninsurance coverage for preventive health services with no cost-sharing.  42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a).   \n51.  To protect women’s health, to ensure that women do not pay more for insurance \ncoverage than men, and to advance women’s equality and well-being, Congress included the \nWomen’s Health Amendment in the ACA.   \n52.  The Women’s Health Amendment requires insurance plans to cover certain \nwomen’s preventive health services without cost-sharing.  42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4). \n53.  Before the ACA was enacted, insurers had not consistently covered women’s \npreventive health services.   \n54.  Women had historically paid much more in out-of-pocket health costs than men \nhad, based largely on significant costs for basic and necessary preventive care; and in some \ninstances, women were unable to obtain this care at all because of cost barriers.   \n55.  Congress included the Women’s Health Amendment in the ACA to help alleviate \n16 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 17 of 46\n \nthe “punitive practices of insurance companies that charge women more and give [them] less in a \nbenefit” and to combat other forms of widespread sex discrimination in the health-insurance \nmarket.  155 Cong. Rec. S12,021, S12,026 (daily ed. Dec. 1, 2009) (statement of Sen. Mikulski).   \n56.  Congress specifically intended for the Women’s Health Amendment to improve \nwomen’s health by providing “affordable family planning services” to “enable women and \nfamilies to make informed decisions about when and how they become parents.” 155 Cong. Rec. \nS12,033, S12,052 (daily ed. Dec. 1, 2009) (statement of Sen. Franken). \n57.  Under the Women’s Health Amendment, Congress required the Health Resources \nand Services Administration (“HRSA”), a component of HHS, to adopt guidelines on the \nwomen’s preventive-care services that must be covered under the ACA without cost-sharing. \n58.  Before issuing the Guidelines, HRSA commissioned the Institute of Medicine \n(now the National Academy of Medicine) to convene a committee of experts on women’s health, \nadolescent health, disease prevention, and evidence-based guidelines, to conduct a comprehensive \nreview of women’s preventive-health needs and to produce a report.  See IOM Report (2011).   \n59.  Based on detailed findings—including findings that access to contraception \nreduces unintended pregnancies, abortions, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and negative health \nconsequences to women and children, and that even small cost-sharing requirements significantly \nreduce the use of contraception—this expert committee of the Institute of Medicine recommended \nthat HRSA include the “full range of Food and Drug Administration approved contraceptive \nmethods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for women with \nreproductive capacity” as one of eight critical preventive services for women.  Id. at 109-110. \n60.  In August 2011, HRSA adopted the required Guidelines, which accepted and \nimplemented in full the Institute of Medicine’s recommendation on contraception and seven other \n17 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 18 of 46\n \npreventive services for women.  See HRSA, Women’s Preventive Services Guidelines, \nhttp://hrsa.gov/womens-guidelines. \n61.  To date, HRSA has not removed any services from the list set forth in the \nGuidelines regarding which women’s preventive services must be covered for a group or \nindividual health plan to comply with the ACA:  Contraceptive methods and counseling remain \nrequired benefits.  See HRSA, Women’s Preventive Services Guidelines, http://hrsa.gov/womens-\nguidelines.7   \n62.  As recently as December 2016, a panel of experts convened by the American \nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, through a cooperative agreement with HRSA, \nreaffirmed the importance of the ACA’s contraceptive coverage requirement.  Women’s \nPreventive Services Initiative, Recommendations for Preventive Services for Women (2016), \nhttps://www.womenspreventivehealth.org/final-report/. \n63.  After the IOM Report and years of comments, the three departments primarily \nresponsible for implementing the Women’s Health Amendment—the Departments of Health and \nHuman Services, Labor, and Treasury—finalized the preventive-services regulations, which \nrequired coverage of all the women’s preventive-care services outlined in the Guidelines, \nincluding all FDA-approved methods of contraception and related education and counseling for \nwomen.  See 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv) (HHS); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv) (Labor); \n26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713(a)(1)(iv) (Treasury). \n                                                 \n7 Following issuance of the challenged Rules, language was added in a footnote to the \n“contraceptive methods and counseling” line of the Guidelines with the text of the Rules’ \nReligious and Moral Exemption language.  Id.  The Guidelines on HRSA’s website have \ncontinued to include this footnote, and thereby impermissibly tell entities that they may \nunilaterally opt out of providing contraceptive coverage even though the enabling Rules \ncurrently are subject to two nationwide preliminary injunctions.  \n18 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 19 of 46\n \n64.  The Departments have stated that contraceptive services were included in these \nregulations based on the regulatory findings that “cost sharing can be a significant barrier to \neffective contraception” and that “[c]ontraceptive coverage, by reducing the number of \nunintended and potentially unhealthy pregnancies, furthers the goal of eliminating [the gender] \ndisparity [in health coverage] by allowing women to achieve equal status as healthy and \nproductive members of the job force.”  77 Fed. Reg. 8,725, 8,728 (Feb. 15, 2012). \nReligious Objections to Contraceptive Coverage \nand the Accommodation Process \n65.  Houses of worship were and continue to be exempt from the ACA’s contraceptive \ncoverage requirement. \n66.  Certain religiously affiliated employers and universities that did not qualify for the \nhouse-of-worship exemption objected to providing health-insurance coverage for contraception to \ntheir employees and students and their dependents.   \n67.  To accommodate these entities’ objections while still ensuring that women at the \nentities receive access to seamless, affordable contraceptive coverage, the Departments developed \nand made available an “accommodation” process for certain religiously affiliated nonprofit \ninstitutions.  See 78 Fed. Reg. 39,870, 39,871 (July 2, 2013).8     \n68.  The Departments made the accommodation final only after reviewing a total of \n600,000 comments on the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Notice of Proposed \n                                                 \n8 While the term “accommodation” has been used as a shorthand in this context to mean the \nability of certain qualifying employers and universities to refuse to provide the contraceptive \ncoverage on giving notice (so that the government may ensure that separate payments for \ncontraception will be made by the entity’s insurer or third-party administrator), and the term \n“exemption” has been used to mean the ability to opt out of providing the coverage without \ngiving notice (leaving employees and students without coverage through their regular insurance \nplan), a “religious accommodation” is merely an exemption from a general legal requirement on \nreligious grounds.  See generally Corp. of the Presiding Bishop v. Amos, 483 U.S. 327 (1987). \n19 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 20 of 46\n \nRulemaking.   \n69.  The accommodation was later extended to certain closely held, for-profit entities \nwith religious objections to contraception, in response to the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in \nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751 (2014).  See 80 Fed. Reg. 41,318 (July 14, \n2015).   \n70.  The federal government made the extension of the accommodation final only after \nreviewing 75,000 comments in response to the related Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. \n71.  The accommodation allows an objecting entity either to sign a form stating its \nobjection to providing contraceptive coverage and submit that form to the entity’s insurance \ncompany or otherwise to notify the federal government of its objection.  26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-\n2713A (2015).   \n72.  After this notification, the insurance company or third-party administrator provides \nor arranges for separate payments for contraceptive services, without cost-sharing, directly to the \naffected women.  Id.   \n73.  Thus, under the accommodation, an objecting entity is entirely relieved of \n“contracting, arranging, paying, or referring for contraceptive coverage,” while the women who \nare employees or students, and their dependents, receive the required coverage without cost-\nsharing from their regular insurance company. \n74.  A number of entities that were eligible for the accommodation nevertheless \nchallenged it, contending that merely filling out the accommodation form or notifying the \ngovernment of their objection violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”) and the \nU.S. Constitution.   \n75.  The objecting employers and universities argued that providing notification in \n20 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 21 of 46\n \norder to opt out of the ACA’s contraceptive coverage requirement is a “trigger” to women’s \nreceiving contraceptive coverage, even though the objecting entities are not required to provide \nthe coverage in their health plan.   \n76.  Several of these entities filed lawsuits.   \n77.  Eight of the nine federal courts of appeals to consider these cases flatly rejected \nthese challenges.  See, e.g., Little Sisters of Poor House v. Burwell, 794 F.3d 1151 (10th Cir. \n2015); Geneva Coll. v. Sec’y U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 778 F.3d 422 (3d Cir. 2015); \nPriests for Life v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 772 F.3d 229 (D.C. Cir. 2014); E. Tex. \nBaptist Univ. v. Burwell, 793 F.3d 449, 459–63 (5th Cir. 2015); Univ. of Notre Dame v. Burwell, \n786 F.3d 606, 611–15 (7th Cir. 2015); Catholic Health Care Sys. v. Burwell, 796 F.3d 207, 218–\n26 (2d Cir. 2015); Mich. Catholic Conference & Catholic Family Servs. v. Burwell, 807 F.3d 738, \n749–50 (6th Cir. 2015); Eternal Word Television Network, Inc. v. Sec’y of U.S. Dep’t Health & \nHuman Servs., 818 F.3d 1122, 1148–51 (11th Cir. 2016); but see Dordt Coll. v. Burwell, 801 F.3d \n946 (8th Cir. 2015). \n78.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that the accommodation \nprocess does not substantially burden Notre Dame’s exercise of religion and therefore does not \nviolate RFRA.  See Univ. of Notre Dame v. Burwell, 786 F.3d 606, 607 (7th Cir. 2015), vacated \non other grounds, 136 S. Ct. 2007 (2016); Univ. of Notre Dame v. Sebelius, 743 F.3d. 547, 554 \n(7th Cir. 2014), vacated on other grounds, 135 S. Ct. 1528 (2015); see also Grace Sch. v. \nBurwell, 801 F.3d 788, 791 (7th Cir. 2015), vacated on other grounds, 136 S. Ct. 2011 (2016); \nWheaton Coll. v. Burwell, 791 F.3d 792, 795 (7th Cir. 2015). \n79.  The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari in seven of the cases and ultimately \nvacated and remanded all the cases with the instruction that the parties “should be afforded an \n21 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 22 of 46\n \nopportunity to arrive at an approach going forward that “accommodates [the entities’] religious \nexercise while at the same time ensuring that women covered by [the entities’] health plans \nreceive full and equal health coverage, including contraceptive coverage.”  Zubik v. Burwell, \n136 S. Ct. 1557, 1560 (2016) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added). \n80.  On July 22, 2016, in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in Zubik, the \nDepartments issued a Request for Information (“RFI”) to solicit from interested parties comments \non “whether there are alternative ways (other than those offered in current regulations) for eligible \norganizations that object to providing coverage for contraceptive services on religious grounds to \nobtain an accommodation, while still ensuring that women enrolled in the organizations’ health \nplans have access to seamless coverage of the full range of Food and Drug Administration-\napproved contraceptives without cost sharing.”  81 Fed. Reg. 47,741 (July 22, 2016).     \n81.  On January 9, 2017, in response to 54,000 comments received in response to the \nRFI, the federal government concluded: “the comments reviewed by the Departments in response \nto the RFI indicate that no feasible approach has been identified at this time that would resolve the \nconcerns of religious objectors, while still ensuring that affected women receive full and equal \nhealth coverage, including contraceptive coverage,” so “the Departments continue to believe that \nthe existing accommodation regulations are consistent with RFRA . . . .”  Dept. of Labor, FAQs \nAbout Affordable Care Act Implementation Part 36, at 4-5 (Jan. 9, 2017), \nhttps://www.dol.gov/sites/default/files/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/aca-\npart-36.pdf. \n82.  Meanwhile, the various Zubik cases were held in abeyance while the parties \nattempted to work out a resolution.   \n83.  According to court filings in those cases, the federal government met numerous \n22 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 23 of 46\n \ntimes with entities challenging the coverage requirement to discuss a resolution of the \naccommodation process.   \n84.  Although Notre Dame students had intervened in the University’s challenge to the \ncontraceptive coverage requirement, they were not permitted to participate in that process (see \nStatus Report of Intervenors-Appellees at 2, Univ. of Notre Dame v. Price, No. 13-3853 (7th Cir. \nOct. 2, 2017)).   \nThe Interim Final Rules \n85.  Despite the Supreme Court’s clear order in Zubik to find an approach that \n“ensur[es] that women covered by [the employers’] health plans receive full and equal health \ncoverage, including contraceptive coverage,” President Trump issued an Executive Order on May \n4, 2017, titled “Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty,” directing issuance of the type of \nRules challenged here.  Exec. Order No. 13,798, 82 Fed. Reg. 21,675 (May 4, 2017).   \n86.  The Order states that, regarding the “Conscience Protections with Respect to \nPreventive-Care Mandate,” “[t]he Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, and the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services shall consider issuing amended regulations, consistent \nwith applicable law, to address conscience-based objections to the preventive-care mandate \npromulgated under section 300gg-13(a)(4) of title 42, United States Code.” \n87.  Without any public notice and comment or other pre-enactment mechanism for \nreceiving input from the public, the Departments issued the new Rules on October 6, 2017.  \n88.  The Rules dramatically expand the scope of the exemption and the types of entities \nthat can claim it, allowing the covered entities to choose whether they will participate in the \naccommodation process or whether they will instead affirmatively prevent employees and \nstudents from receiving contraceptive coverage.  \n89.  The latter approach has the effect of denying Plaintiffs and other women coverage \n23 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 24 of 46\n \nto which they are otherwise legally entitled.    \n90.  The Rules broaden the entities eligible for an exemption so that almost any \nuniversity, nonprofit, for-profit business (whether publicly or privately held), or other \nnongovernmental employer may refuse to cover contraception in its group health plans without \nnotifying the government or anyone else.  45 C.F.R. §§ 147.132(a)(1), 147.133(a)(1) (as \namended). \n91.  Through the Rules, the Departments impermissibly attempt to broaden the \npermissible bases for seeking the exemption, from sincerely held religious beliefs to sincerely \nheld religious beliefs or sincerely held moral convictions (45 C.F.R. §§ 147.132(a)(2), \n147.133(a)(2) (as amended)).   \n92.  The Rules make optional the previously-required accommodation process for \nobjecting entities, which was designed to ensure that employees and students would continue to \nreceive seamless contraceptive coverage.   \n93.  Under the Rules, an employer, university, or insurance issuer may claim an \nexemption and deny coverage, so that the insureds will no longer have seamless contraceptive \ncoverage.   \n94.  These Rules took effect immediately on October 6, 2017. \n95.  These Rules took effect without any notice or opportunity for public comment. \n96.  On December 15, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of \nPennsylvania entered a nationwide preliminary injunction temporarily blocking the Rules from \ntaking effect.  Pennsylvania v. Trump, -- F. Supp. 3d --, No. CV 17-4540, 2017 WL 6398465, at \n*15 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 15, 2017). \n97.  The court found that the plaintiff—the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania—will \n24 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 25 of 46\n \nlikely succeed on the merits of its claim that the Government Defendants promulgated the Rules \nwithout following the requisite procedures under the Administrative Procedure Act.  Id. at *11-\n14. \n98.  The court further found that Pennsylvania was likely to succeed on its claim that \nthe Rules are substantively illegal because they were promulgated without statutory authority.  Id \nat *15-17.  \n99.  A few days later, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California \nissued a second nationwide preliminary injunction against the Rules, similarly finding that the \nplaintiff States in another action would likely succeed on their claim that the Government \nDefendants issued the Rules without following the procedures required by Administrative \nProcedure Act. California v. Health & Human Servs., -- F. Supp. 3d --, No. 17-CV-05783-HSG, \n2017 WL 6524627 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 21, 2017).   \n100.  Both decisions are on appeal. \nThe Settlement Agreement \n101.  On October 13, 2017, just one week after the Departments issued the Rules, and \nthe same day that the Rules were published in the Federal Register, the Government Defendants \nexecuted the Settlement Agreement, which purported to resolve several pending cases challenging \nthe ACA contraceptive coverage requirement.   \n102.  The Government Defendants executed the Settlement Agreement with Notre Dame \nin order to dispose of the University’s ongoing legal dispute.  The Settlement Agreement also \nresolved separate legal challenges with more than 70 other private entities.   \n25 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 26 of 46\n \n103.  Among other terms, the Settlement Agreement purports to exempt Notre Dame \nand the health plans that it sponsors from complying with either the existing contraceptive \ncoverage requirement or any “materially similar regulation or agency policy.”  (Exhibit A at 4).   \n104.  The Settlement Agreement states that “[n]o person may receive [contraceptive \ncoverage] as an automatic consequence of enrollment in any health plan sponsored by Plaintiffs.” \n(Exhibit A at 4).     \n105.  The Settlement Agreement also retroactively rescinds penalties for noncompliance \nwith the contraceptive coverage requirement, providing that no fines should have been assessed.  \n(Exhibit A at 6). \n106.  By these provisions, the Government Defendants purport to grant private entities, \nincluding the Defendant University, a contractual right to deny contraceptive coverage to women \nwho rely on their health plans, in direct violation of the ACA and the Supreme Court’s directive \nin Zubik that any resolution of legal challenges to the contraceptive coverage requirement must \n“ensur[e] that women covered by [the entities’] health plans receive full and equal health \ncoverage, including contraceptive coverage.”  Zubik, 136 S. Ct. at 1560. \n107.  As a justification for this unlawful action, the Settlement Agreement relies on “the \nnew regulations,” notwithstanding that those Rules are themselves unlawful and have since been \npreliminarily enjoined by two district courts.  (Exhibit A at 2).  \n108.  The Settlement Agreement further awards the private entities $3 million to cover \nthe costs and fees for their legal counsel, the law firm Jones Day.  (Exhibit A at 7).  \n109.  Despite repeated requests by the students who intervened in the University’s \nlawsuit to be included in settlement negotiations, the student-intervenors were excluded from all \nsettlement discussions and were never informed by either the Defendant University or the \n26 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 27 of 46\n \nGovernment Defendants that a settlement agreement had been negotiated or executed.  See, e.g., \nUniv. of Notre Dame v. Price, No. 13-3853 (7th Cir.), Status Report of Intervenors-Appellees at \n2, (filed Oct. 2, 2017), Status Report of Intervenors-Appellees, Dkt. 152 (filed Aug. 31, 2017). \n110.  No court was informed of, reviewed, or judicially confirmed the Settlement \nAgreement. \n111.  Neither the U.S. Department of Justice nor any of the Defendant agencies issued a \npublic press release announcing the Settlement Agreement.9   \n112.  Notre Dame voluntarily dismissed its lawsuit concerning the contraceptive \ncoverage requirement on October 19, 2017, less than two weeks after the Rules were issued, and \njust days after execution of the secret Settlement Agreement, although neither Plaintiffs here nor \nthe student-intervenors in the Notre Dame action were informed about or aware of the Settlement \nAgreement at that time, and notwithstanding that their rights under the ACA were directly \naffected thereby.  See Univ. of Notre Dame v. Sebelius, No. 13-cv-1276 (N.D. Ind.); Univ. of \nNotre Dame v. Price, No. 13-3853 (7th Cir.) (appeal dismissed October 17, 2017). \nNotre Dame’s Changes to Contraceptive Coverage \n113.  On October 27, 2017, Notre Dame announced in e-mails to students, faculty, and \nstaff its intention to withdraw contraceptive coverage from its health plans beginning in the new \nplan years.   \n114.  After the University’s October 27 announcement, students began to organize in \n                                                 \n9 See U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Justice News, https://www.justice.gov/news (listing all press releases \nand revealing that no release was issued about the Settlement Agreement); U.S. Dep’t of Health \n& Human Servs., 2017 News Releases, https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2017-news-\nreleases/index.html#October (same); U.S. Dep’t of Labor, Newsroom, \nhttps://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/date/2017/October (same); U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, \nPress Releases, https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases (same).   \n27 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 28 of 46\n \nresponse to the University’s decision to withdraw contraceptive coverage.   \n115.  Students who would soon form Plaintiff I4RH collected 516 signatures from \nundergraduate students, graduate students, faculty, and alumni on a statement condemning the \nUniversity’s decision to withdraw contraceptive coverage.   \n116.  During this same period, individuals covered by Notre Dame’s health plans— \nincluding some of the Plaintiffs in this case10—filed lawsuits against the Departments, \nchallenging the Rules that had given rise to the University’s announced policy changes.   \n117.  Several Notre Dame students filed a lawsuit in this Court.  Shiraef v. Hargan, \n3:17-cv-817 (N.D. Ind.) (filed October 31, 2017).   \n118.  Two other Notre Dame students, along with a national student association, filed a \nlawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.  Medical Students for Choice v. \nWright, 1:17-cv-02096, (D.D.C.) (filed on October 10, 2017). \n119.  Following public expression of serious concerns from students, alumni, and \nfaculty, the University soon reversed course on its decision to terminate contraceptive coverage.   \n120.  In early November 2017, the University sent e-mails to students, faculty, and staff \nannouncing that it would “not interfere” with the provision of contraceptive coverage to students \nby Aetna or to faculty and staff by Meritain and OptumRx. \n121.  In reliance on Notre Dame’s statements that it would “not interfere” with the \nprovision of contraceptive coverage by the insurance companies, the plaintiffs in the prior Notre \nDame cases filed notices of voluntarily dismissal.   \n122.  The Courts granted voluntary dismissal of the District of Columbia and Northern \nDistrict of Indiana cases without prejudice on February 6 and 7, 2018. \n                                                 \n10 The plaintiffs in these prior suits included Plaintiff Natasha Reifenberg and Jane Doe 2. \n28 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 29 of 46\n \n123.  Also on February 7, immediately after the dismissal orders were entered, the \nUniversity again reversed course, announcing that it would, in fact, be terminating insurance \ncoverage for certain FDA-approved methods of contraception for employees in the middle of the \nplan year on July 1, 2018, and for students beginning with the new plan year in August 2018.     \n124.  In justifying this change in coverage, the University publicly invoked the \nSettlement Agreement as independent authority.   \n125.  As explained in two letters sent on February 7, 2018, by Notre Dame’s President, \nJohn Jenkins, to “Aetna Student Health Enrollees” and to “Faculty and Staff,” a “favorable” \nsettlement with the U.S. government purportedly gave “the University, its insurers and third party \nadministrators the option of an exemption from providing” coverage for all FDA-approved \nmethods of contraception.  Jenkins’s letters did not state which contraceptive methods would \ncontinue to be covered and which would not.   \n126.  Following the February 7 announcements, students, faculty, and staff were left \nguessing whether their method of contraception would remain covered. \n127.  On March 25, 2018, University Health Services circulated a “Health Care \nCoverage Update” to students, which directed students to review a “Frequently Asked Questions \nabout Contraceptive Coverage” (“FAQ”) webpage for more information about the changes to \ncontraceptive coverage in the student health plan.  \n128.  The FAQ explains that the University will provide no coverage for copper IUDs or \nemergency contraceptives.   \n129.  The FAQ also explains that even though the University said that it will “cover” \ncertain methods of contraception, it will require students to pay out-of-pocket for any covered \ncontraceptive method, in direct contravention of the Women’s Health Amendment, 42 U.S.C. \n29 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 30 of 46\n \n§ 300gg-13(a)(4), and implementing regulations.   \n130.  According to the FAQ, students must pay the same out-of-pocket costs for \ncontraception covered by the plan as for other prescription drugs.   \n131.  Although new plan documents have yet to be released, based on the 2017-18 Aetna \nStudent Health insurance plan, students will have to pay coinsurance of either 20 or 40 percent for \ncertain contraceptives, depending on whether a generic alternative is available, and for some long-\nacting reversible contraceptives like IUDs and implants, students may also have to meet a $500 \nannual deductible before receiving any coverage from Aetna.11   \n132.  The FAQ further states that “counseling and instructional office visits” associated \nwith natural family planning will be covered, but counseling and education related to other \ncontraceptive methods and services will not. \n133.  Although the FAQ says that “certain IUDs and contraceptive implants” will remain \ncovered, it declines to specify which, if any, forms of hormonal IUDs or implants will receive \ncoverage or what related services, if any, will be covered.   \n134.  IUDs and implants are among the most effective forms of contraception but carry \nthe largest up-front costs.   \n135.  Even if hormonal IUDs and implants are “covered,” the FAQ states that they will \nbe treated as “medical services.”   \n136.  Based on the 2017-18 Aetna Student Health plan, students may thus have to meet a \n$500 deductible and then pay coinsurance of up to 40 percent of the “recognized charge” for a \nhormonal IUD or implant and related services (if any are covered). \n                                                 \n11 Aetna Student Health Plan Design and Benefits Summary, University of Notre Dame at 6, 8, \n10, 19, https://www.aetnastudenthealth.com/schools/notredame/pdbs1718.pdf. \n30 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 31 of 46\n \n137.  Under the 2017-18 Aetna student health plan, the deductible is waived for \nexpenses incurred at the University Health Services, but, because Notre Dame will not allow the \nUniversity Health Services to provide most contraceptives, at least for undergraduates, \nundergraduates may be forced to incur additional out-of-pocket expenses in order to obtain \ncontraception from off-campus physicians and pharmacies. \n138.  On April 27, 2018, Notre Dame Human Resources sent an e-mail to faculty and \nstudents with a link to revised medical and prescription plan documents and summaries of \nmaterial modifications to those plans related to the changes to contraceptive coverage effective \nJuly 1, 2018.   \n139.  In this correspondence, the University notified faculty and staff that, as with \nstudents, they will have to pay out-of-pocket for any covered contraceptive method, in direct \ncontravention of the Women’s Health Amendment, 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4), and \nimplementing regulations.  The e-mail also states that, as for students, the University will provide \nno coverage for copper IUDs or emergency contraceptives, and that “instructional and counseling \nappointments related to natural family planning will be covered” but counseling and education \nrelated to other contraceptive methods and services will not.   \n140.  The e-mail correspondence states that certain “hormonal contraceptives” included \non the University’s contraceptive-drug formulary will be covered by OptumRx but will be subject \nto co-payments.   \n141.  The e-mail correspondence and plan documents further state that IUDs and \nimplants (as well as their insertion and removal) and contraceptive injections will be covered by \nMeritain as “medical services,” but neither the e-mail nor the plan documents specify which, if \n31 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 32 of 46\n \nany, hormonal IUDs or implants will be covered or whether any related services other than \ninsertion and removal will be covered.  \n142.  On April 30, 2018, Plaintiff I4RH sent Notre Dame President Jenkins an \n“insurance clarity petition” with more than 100 signatures from Notre Dame undergraduates \ngraduate students, alumni, faculty, and staff demanding additional details about the University’s \nannounced changes to contraceptive coverage.   \n143.  The petition also expressed disapproval over the change in policy and the “lack of \ntransparency that has characterized the [school] administration’s every move on this issue since \nOctober 2017.”   \n144.  On May 4, 2018, Ann Firth, Chief of Staff in the Notre Dame Office of the \nPresident, responded to I4RH that the University would not issue any more details about the \nAetna student health plan until July 1, which is after matriculating students will have already \ncommitted to their programs. \nEffect of the Rules and Settlement Agreement \n145.  The expanded exemptions in the Rules effectively nullify the ACA’s contraceptive \ncoverage requirement, including regulations that took over six years to promulgate and involved \nmultiple consultations with expert committees as well as six rounds of notice-and-comment \nrulemaking in the form of Advanced Notices of Proposed Rulemaking, Notices of Proposed \nRulemaking, Interim Final Rules with comment periods, and Requests for Information that \ntogether involved more than 725,000 comments.   \n146.  The Settlement Agreement and any other similar settlements, separate and apart \nfrom the Rules, also effectively nullify the ACA’s contraceptive coverage requirement as to its \nsignatories and unknown related entities offering coverage through the health plan of a signatory. \n32 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 33 of 46\n \n147.  The expanded exemptions in the Rules allow virtually any employer or university \nto evade the contraceptive coverage requirement and thereby to harm women by imposing their \nreligious and moral views on employees and students.   \n148.  The Rules, the Settlement Agreement, and any other similar settlements create a \nmajor change in law.   \n149.  The Government Defendants issued the Rules and Defendants executed the \nSettlement Agreement without constitutional or statutory authority, and in violation of Supreme \nCourt orders.   \n150.  The Government Defendants further issued the Rules without following the \nstatutorily mandated notice-and-comment procedure. \n151.  The Rules, the Settlement Agreement, and any other similar settlements establish \nand impose one subset of religious views while denying health care to those with different beliefs.   \n152.  The result is that Plaintiffs and other women are denied coverage for contraception \nand related services and thus are harmed. \n153.  The expanded exemptions jeopardize the health, economic security, and equality \nof more than 62 million women who currently have coverage for all FDA-approved contraceptive \nmethods and related education and counseling without out-of-pocket costs.  See Nat’l Women’s \nLaw Center, New Data Estimate 62.4 Million Women Have Coverage of Birth Control without \nOut-of-Pocket Costs (Sept. 2017), available at https://nwlc.org/resources/new-data-estimate-62-4-\nmillion-women-have-coverage-of-birth-control-without-out-of-pocket-costs/. \n154.  The Rules, the Settlement Agreement, and any other similar settlements reinstate \nthe cost barriers to contraceptive care. \n155.  Additionally, the Rules, the Settlement Agreement, and any other similar \n33 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 34 of 46\n \nsettlements impose other significant informational, administrative, and logistical burdens on \nPlaintiffs and other women, who will need to navigate finding other sources of contraceptive care.   \n156.  Some women will not have access to contraception at all because of the Rules, the \nSettlement Agreement, and any other similar settlements.   \n157.  Congress included the Women’s Health Amendment in the ACA to improve \nwomen’s health by removing cost and access barriers, to protect women’s economic security, and \nto remedy systemic sex discrimination in the insurance market.   \n158.  Yet the Rules, the Settlement Agreement, and other similar settlements, by \nallowing employers, universities, and insurance issuers to exempt themselves from the \ncontraceptive coverage requirement, target women for adverse treatment, directly undermining \nthose legislative purposes. \n159.  The Rules, the Settlement Agreement, and other similar settlements create \nunreasonable barriers to critical health care services for Plaintiffs and countless other women. \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION—GOVERNMENT DEFENDANTS \n(Settlement Agreement Violates the Administrative Procedure Act) \n160.  The foregoing allegations are re-alleged and incorporated by reference as if \nrestated fully here. \n161.  Plaintiffs are entitled to relief under the Administrative Procedure Act because the \nSettlement Agreement is illegal under and contrary to controlling orders and precedential \ndecisions of the federal courts, federal statutes, and the U.S. Constitution. \n162.  HHS, the Department of Labor, and the Department of the Treasury are “agencies” \nunder the Administrative Procedure Act.  See 5 U.S.C. § 551(1). \n163.  The Government Defendants’ decision to enter into the Settlement Agreement is a \nfinal agency action subject to judicial review under 5 U.S.C. § 551(13) and 5 U.S.C. § 704. \n34 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 35 of 46\n \n164.  The Administrative Procedure Act requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside” \nany agency action, finding, or conclusion that is “arbitrary,” “capricious,” “an abuse of \ndiscretion,” “not in accordance with the law,” “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, \nor immunity,” or “in excess of statutory . . . authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.”  \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(C). \n165.  The Settlement Agreement is not in accordance with the U.S. Supreme Court’s \nOrders in Zubik v. Burwell, 136 S. Ct. 1557 (2016), and Univ. of Notre Dame v. Burwell, 136 S. \nCt. 2007 (2016).   \n166.  Zubik required the Government Defendants to resolve legal challenges to the ACA \ncontraceptive coverage requirement in a manner that “accommodates [the entities’] religious \nexercise while at the same time ensuring that women covered by [the entities’] health plans \nreceive full and equal health coverage, including contraceptive coverage.”  Zubik, 136 S. Ct. at \n1560 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added); see also Univ. of Notre \nDame, 136 S.Ct. 2007 (“Nothing in the Zubik opinion, or in the opinions or orders of the courts \nbelow, is to affect the ability of the Government to ensure that women covered by petitioners’ \nhealth plans obtain, without cost, the full range of FDA approved contraceptives.” (internal \nquotation marks omitted)).  \n167.  The Settlement Agreement violates these orders by authorizing the University to \nwithdraw, block, or impose cost-sharing on contraceptive coverage for its students and \nemployees, with no provision for ensuring that plan beneficiaries, including the Plaintiffs, \ncontinue to receive the full, equal, and comprehensive contraceptive coverage to which they are \nentitled by law. \n168.  The Settlement Agreement is not in accordance with the ACA requirement that \n35 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 36 of 46\n \ngroup health plans or individual health insurance cover the preventive care services identified in \nHRSA’s Women’s Preventive Service Guidelines without cost-sharing, because the Settlement \nAgreement permits the University to withdraw or impose cost-sharing under the student and \nemployee health plans on coverage for contraceptive services specified in the Guidelines.  \nWomen’s Health Amendment, 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4). \n169.  The Government Defendants exceeded their statutory authority by executing a \nSettlement Agreement that is not in accordance with the ACA requirement that group health plans \nand individual health insurance cover without cost-sharing the contraceptive services identified in \nHRSA’s Women’s Preventive Service Guidelines.  Women’s Health Amendment, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 300gg-13(a)(4).  \n170.  Thus, the Government Defendants violated 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). \n171.  The Settlement Agreement is contrary to the Establishment Clause of the First \nAmendment because, among other constitutional defects, it prefers some religious beliefs and \ndenominations over others and imposes costs, burdens, and harms on Plaintiffs to favor the \nreligious beliefs of the University. \n172.  The Settlement Agreement is contrary to the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment because it erects unnecessary barriers to exercising the fundamental liberty right to \nmake personal decisions regarding use of contraception without government intrusion.   \n173.  The Settlement Agreement is contrary to the equal-protection guarantees of the \nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment because it discriminates based on sex, religion, and \nthe exercise of fundamental rights. \n174.  The Settlement Agreement is contrary to the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment because it deprives Plaintiffs of their rights without notice or an opportunity to be \n36 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 37 of 46\n \nheard. \n175.  By entering an illegal Settlement Agreement, the Government Defendants abused \ntheir discretion in violation of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n176.  Because the Government Defendants’ actions are “not in accordance with law,” are \nin excess of statutory authority and short of statutory right, are “contrary to constitutional right,” \nare “arbitrary,” are “capricious,” and are “an abuse of discretion,” the Government Defendants \nhave violated the Administrative Procedure Act. \n177.  Absent declaratory and injunctive relief, the Government Defendants’ violations \nwill cause ongoing harm to Plaintiffs. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION—ALL DEFENDANTS \n(Settlement Agreement is Void for Illegality) \n178.  The foregoing allegations are re-alleged and incorporated by reference as if \nrestated fully here. \n179.  Under federal common law, contracts that are illegal are void ab initio and \nunenforceable. See, e.g., U.S. Nursing Corp. v. Saint Joseph Med. Ctr., 39 F.3d 790, 792 (7th Cir. \n1994); Zimmer, Inc. v. Nu Tech Med., Inc., 54 F. Supp. 2d 850, 863 (N.D. Ind. 1999). \n180.  The Settlement Agreement is illegal under and contrary to controlling orders and \nprecedential decisions of federal courts, federal statutes, and the U.S. Constitution.   \n181.  For example, the Settlement Agreement violates:  \na.  The U.S. Supreme Court’s Orders in Zubik v. Burwell, 136 S. Ct. 1557 \n(2016), and Univ. of Notre Dame v. Burwell, 136 S. Ct. 2007 (2016). \nb.  The Women’s Health Amendment, 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4), and the \nHRSA Women’s Preventive Services Guidelines, http://hrsa.gov/womens-guidelines. \nc.

The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \n182.  The Settlement Agreement is null and void ab initio because it is illegal. \n183.  Absent declaratory and injunctive relief voiding the Settlement Agreement and \nenjoining its enforcement, Defendants’ violations will cause ongoing harm to Plaintiffs. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION—GOVERNMENT DEFENDANTS \n(Administrative Procedure Act—Rules are Procedurally Arbitrary and Capricious) \n184.  The foregoing allegations are re-alleged and incorporated by reference as if \nrestated fully here. \n185.  Plaintiffs are entitled to relief under the Administrative Procedure Act because the \nDepartments did not follow procedures required by law for agency rulemaking. \n186.  The Administrative Procedure Act requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside” \nagency action taken “without observance of procedure required by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \n187.  HHS, the Department of Labor, and the Department of the Treasury are “agencies” \nunder the Administrative Procedure Act.  See 5 U.S.C. § 551(1). \n188.  The challenged Rules qualify as rules under the Administrative Procedure Act. See \n5 U.S.C. § 551(4). \n189.  With exceptions not applicable here, a federal agency must provide the public with \nnotice of and an opportunity to comment on a proposed rulemaking.  5 U.S.C. § 553. \n190.  Defendants promulgated the Rules in violation of 5 U.S.C. § 553. \n191.  Defendants did not have good cause or statutory authority to forgo notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking or to waive the 30-day waiting period between publication and effective \ndate for new rules. \n192.  Absent declaratory and injunctive relief, Plaintiffs have been and will continue to \n38 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 39 of 46\n \nbe harmed. \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION—GOVERNMENT DEFENDANTS \n(Administrative Procedure Act—The Rules Violate the Substantive Requirements of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act) \n193.  The foregoing allegations are re-alleged and incorporated by reference as if \nrestated fully here. \n194.  Plaintiffs are entitled to relief under the Administrative Procedure Act because the \nRules are illegal under the Constitution and federal statutes. \n195.  The Administrative Procedure Act requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside” \nany agency action, finding, or conclusion that is “arbitrary,” “capricious,” “an abuse of \ndiscretion,” “not in accordance with the law,” “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, \nor immunity,” or “in excess of statutory . . . authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.”  \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(C). \n196.  The Rules are contrary to the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. \n197.  The Rules are contrary to the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment because \nthey erect unnecessary barriers to exercising the fundamental liberty right to make personal \ndecisions regarding use of contraception without government intrusion.   \n198.  The Rules are contrary to the equal-protection guarantees of the Due Process \nClause of the Fifth Amendment because they discriminate based on sex, religion, and the exercise \nof fundamental rights. \n199.  The Rules are contrary to the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment because \nthey deprive Plaintiffs of their rights without notice or an opportunity to be heard. \n200.  The Rules are not in accordance with the ACA requirement that group health plans \nand individual health insurance cover the preventive-care services identified in HRSA’s Women’s \n39 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 40 of 46\n \nPreventive Service Guidelines, because the Rules exempt coverage of services specified in the \nGuidelines.  Women’s Health Amendment, 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4). \n201.  The Government Defendants exceeded their statutory authority by issuing Rules \nthat do away with the requirement for coverage of contraceptives without cost-sharing for \nPlaintiffs and at least tens of thousands of other women under 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4), thus \nviolating 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). \n202.  The Rules are inconsistent with the weight of the hundreds of thousands of \ncomments that were submitted for each of the previous rules relating to the contraceptive \ncoverage requirement, and thus are arbitrary, capricious, and in violation of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n203.  The Rules were adopted with no valid justification.  Thus, the Government \nDefendants’ issuance of the rules was arbitrary and capricious and violates 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n204.  By issuing illegal Rules, the Government Defendants abused their discretion in \nviolation of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n205.  Because the Government Defendants’ actions are “not in accordance with law,” \n“contrary to constitutional right,” “arbitrary and capricious,” “an abuse of discretion,” and in \nexcess of statutory authority and short of statutory right, the Government Defendants have \nviolated the Administrative Procedure Act. \n206.  Absent declaratory and injunctive relief, the Government Defendants’ violations \nwill cause ongoing harm to Plaintiffs. \nFIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION—GOVERNMENT DEFENDANTS \n(First Amendment—Violation of the Establishment Clause) \n207.  The foregoing allegations are re-alleged and incorporated by reference as if \nrestated fully here. \n208.  Plaintiffs are entitled to relief because the Settlement Agreement and the Rules \n40 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 41 of 46\n \nsubject, and will continue to subject, Plaintiffs to deprivations of their rights under the \nEstablishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.   \n209.  The Establishment Clause provides that “Congress shall make no law respecting an \nestablishment of religion.” \n210.  The Government Defendants have violated, and will continue to violate, Plaintiffs’ \nrights under the Establishment Clause, including in the following ways: \na.  The Settlement Agreement and the Rules provide religious exemptions \nfrom the ACA that will harm Plaintiffs and others by depriving them of, or limiting their access \nto, contraceptive services, a critical preventive health service. \nb.  The Settlement Agreement and the Rules are governmental conduct that \nhas and will continue to have the primary purpose and principal effect of promoting, advancing, \nand endorsing religion. \nc.  The Settlement Agreement and the Rules coercively impose religious \nbeliefs and practices to which Plaintiffs and other affected persons do not subscribe. \nd.  The Settlement Agreement and the Rules excessively entangle the \ngovernment with religion. \ne.  The Settlement Agreement and Rules impermissibly impose on Plaintiffs \nand other innocent third parties undue costs, burdens, and harms arising from the granting of \nreligious exemptions from the ACA. \nf.  The Settlement Agreement and the Rules impermissibly favor and prefer \nsome denominations and religious beliefs over others. \n211.  Absent declaratory and injunctive relief, the Government Defendants’ violations \nwill cause ongoing harm to Plaintiffs. \n41 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 42 of 46\n \nSIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION—GOVERNMENT DEFENDANTS \n(Fifth Amendment—Due Process) \n(Right to Liberty) \n212.  The foregoing allegations are re-alleged and incorporated by reference as if \nrestated fully here. \n213.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits the government from \ndenying fundamental rights such as the right to liberty. \n214.  By impairing women’s ability to gain access to contraception and forcing women \neither to incur significant costs or to forgo contraception altogether, the Rules and the Settlement \nAgreement infringe the fundamental right to liberty, in violation of Plaintiffs’ rights under the \nFifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  \n215.  The Settlement Agreement and the Rules deny Plaintiffs due process by depriving \nPlaintiffs of their rights without notice or an opportunity to be heard. \n216.  The Settlement Agreement and the Rules do not further a compelling \ngovernmental interest and are not tailored to achieve any such interest. \n217.  The Government Defendants cannot proffer any legitimate justification for the \nSettlement Agreement or the Rules, let alone an exceedingly persuasive or compelling \njustification. \n218.  Absent declaratory and injunctive relief, the Government Defendants’ violations \nwill cause ongoing harm to Plaintiffs. \nSEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION—GOVERNMENT DEFENDANTS \n(Fifth Amendment—Equal Protection) \n \n219.  The foregoing allegations are re-alleged and incorporated by reference as if \nrestated fully here. \n42 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 43 of 46\n \n220.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits the government from \ndenying equal protection of the laws, including on the basis of sex and religion. \n221.  The Settlement Agreement and the Rules deny Plaintiffs the equal protection of the \nlaws because the expansive exemptions that they create impermissibly target women for adverse \ntreatment. \n222.  The Settlement Agreement and the Rules deny Plaintiffs the equal protection of the \nlaws by endorsing one set of religious beliefs to the exclusion of others. \n223.  The Settlement Agreement and the Rules deny Plaintiffs the equal protection of the \nlaws because they discriminate against individuals who seek to exercise their fundamental right to \nmake personal decisions regarding the use of contraception. \n224.  The Settlement Agreement and the Rules do not further a compelling \ngovernmental interest and are not tailored to achieve any such interest. \n225.  The Government Defendants cannot proffer any legitimate justification for the \nSettlement Agreement or the Rules, let alone an exceedingly persuasive or compelling \njustification. \n226.  Absent declaratory and injunctive relief, the Government Defendants’ violations \nwill cause ongoing harm to Plaintiffs. \n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully requests that the Court: \na.  Declare the Settlement Agreement between the Departments and Notre \nDame void because it violates the Administrative Procedure Act, the ACA, orders and \nprecedential decisions of federal courts, and the First and Fifth Amendments to the U.S. \nConstitution;  \n43 \n     \n \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491   document 1   filed 06/26/18   page 44 of 46\n \nb.

This case is a challenge to actions by the United States Departments of Health and \nHuman Services, Labor, and the Treasury (the “Departments”), and the University of Notre Dame \nthat will harm at least tens of thousands of people nationwide, including at Notre Dame.  As a \nresult of Defendants’ conduct, the four individual Plaintiffs and members of Plaintiff Irish 4 \nReproductive Health—along with countless others—are being deprived of the comprehensive \n1 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 2 of 47\n \ncontraceptive coverage to which they are entitled by law, and are being forced to subordinate their \nown beliefs, health, and equality to the religious beliefs of their university or employer in violation \nof the Administrative Procedure Act, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, and \nthe First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \n2.  The ACA requires group health plans and health-insurance issuers to cover, without \ncost-sharing, a range of preventive health services.  Recognizing that women historically have \nbeen required to pay more money out-of-pocket for health care, including for contraception and \nrelated services, Congress expressly required the inclusion of women’s preventive services among \nthe benefits that health plans must cover without copays or other cost-sharing.1  Since 2011, the \nDepartments’ controlling regulations have clarified that these services must include contraception \nfor women and related patient education and counseling, without cost-sharing.   \n3.  Since 2011, the Departments’ regulations have contained an exemption from the \ncontraceptive coverage requirement for houses of worship.  Since 2013, the regulations have also \ncontained  an  “accommodation”  for  certain  employers  and  universities  that  have  religious \nobjections to contraceptive coverage and meet certain criteria.  Through the accommodation \nprocess, an objecting employer or university may inform the government, or the entity’s insurer or \nthird-party administrator, that it has religious objections to providing coverage for contraceptive \nservices. The entity’s insurance issuer then fulfills its legal obligation by separately providing \npayments for contraceptive services.  The long-standing regulations thus ensured that women \ncovered by health plans at objecting employers or universities obtain the full range of U.S. Food \n \n1 This Complaint uses the term “women” because the individual Plaintiffs are women and because \nthe Rules and settlements at issue target women.  The denial of reproductive health care and \ninsurance coverage for that care, however, also affects individuals who may not identify as women, \nincluding some gender-nonconforming individuals and transgender men. \n2 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 3 of 47\n \nand Drug Administration-approved contraceptives guaranteed to them by law, while at the same \ntime relieving employers and universities with religious objections of their obligation to cover \ncontraception in their health insurance plans. \n4.  Defendant Notre Dame and others mounted legal challenges to the accommodation \nprocess. But eight of the nine federal courts of appeals to consider such challenges flatly rejected \nthem—including the Seventh Circuit, twice. The U.S. Supreme Court remanded all these cases to \nbe resolved in a manner that “ensur[es] that women covered by [the entities’] health plans receive \nfull and equal health coverage, including contraceptive coverage.” Zubik v. Burwell, 136 S. Ct. \n1557, 1560 (2016); see also, e.g., Univ. of Notre Dame v. Burwell, 136 S. Ct. 2007 (Mem.).   \n5.  Now the Departments seek to eviscerate the contraceptive coverage requirement, \nto the detriment of Plaintiffs and countless others nationwide.  By their actions, the Departments \nhave embarked on a two-tiered effort to do by fiat what the courts had refused to allow: give \nemployers and universities a veto over the legal rights of countless women to obtain coverage for \nnecessary health care. \n6.  First, on October 6, 2017, the Departments issued two Interim Final Rules that \nallowed  all  nongovernmental  entities—including  for-profit  businesses,  nonprofits,  and \nuniversities—to declare themselves exempt from the contraceptive coverage requirement based on \nreligious beliefs, and allowed most such entities to exempt themselves based on so-called moral \nconvictions.2  The Interim Final Rules also made the accommodation process optional.  In other \n \n2 These Interim Final Rules were issued and went into effect on October 6, 2017, and were \npublished in the Federal Register on October 13.  Religious Exemptions and Accommodations for \nCoverage of Certain Preventative Services Under the Affordable Care Act, 82 Fed. Reg. 47,792 \n(Oct. 13, 2017); Moral Exemptions and Accommodations for Coverage of Certain Preventative \nServices Under the Affordable Care Act, 82 Fed. Reg. 47,838 (Oct. 13, 2017) (collectively, the \n“Interim Final Rules” or “IFRs”). \n3 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 4 of 47\n \nwords, the Interim Final Rules allowed covered entities to impose their religious and moral beliefs \non countless women by preventing employees, students, and their dependents from receiving \ncontraceptive coverage.   \n7.  Second, on October 13, 2017, just one week after issuing the Interim Final Rules, \nthe Departments executed a private settlement agreement with more than 70 entities, including \nNotre Dame, resolving the signatories’ pending legal challenges to the ACA accommodation \nprocess, with terms that echoed the Interim Final Rules’ unlawful religious and moral exemptions \nand then extended the scope of those exemptions even further.  See Exhibit A.  In direct \ncontravention  of  legal  requirements  and  long-standing  Department  of  Justice  policy,  the \nSettlement Agreement impermissibly negotiates away the rights of third parties by purporting \npermanently to exempt the signatories from all contraceptive coverage requirements, both past and \nfuture.  Even though the University admits that “most of [the 17,000 people] covered [by its health \nplans] have no financially feasible alternative but to rely on the University for such coverage,”3 \nthe Settlement Agreement allows Notre Dame to deny them contraceptive coverage in their regular \nhealth plan.  The Settlement Agreement also awards the signatories millions of taxpayer dollars in \nattorneys’ fees. \n8.  On February 7, 2018, Notre Dame—citing the Settlement Agreement as support— \ndeclared that it would no longer abide by the contraceptive coverage requirement.  The University \nannounced that it would refuse to comply with the accommodation process.  Consequently, \nstudents and employees would no longer receive coverage for the full range of FDA-approved \ncontraceptives and related services, in contravention of the regulations then in effect.  Moreover, \nwhile  faculty  and  student  insurance  policies  would  cover  what  they  call  certain  “simple” \n \n3 Letter to Faculty and Staff by President Rev. John I. Jenkins, C.S.C. (Feb. 7, 2018). \n4 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 5 of 47\n \ncontraceptives,  they  would  be  subject  to  co-payments,  coinsurance,  and  deductibles—in \ncontravention of the ACA itself, the regulations then in effect, and even the October 2017 IFRs \n(which by then had been enjoined by two federal courts (see Pennsylvania v. Trump, 281 F. Supp. \n3d 553 (E.D. Pa. 2017); California v. HHS, 281 F. Supp. 3d 806 (N.D. Cal. 2017)).  In other words, \nthe University announced that it would impose its own views about contraception on the 17,000 \npeople covered by its health plans.  By excluding some methods of contraceptives altogether and \nimposing  cost-sharing  on  other  methods,  the  University’s  new  policy  strips  women  of  the \ncontraceptive coverage guaranteed to them by law and erects financial, administrative, and \nlogistical barriers to contraception.  \n9.  While litigation challenging the IFRs was pending, the Departments issued two \nFinal Rules that made the Interim Final Rules permanent in all material respects.4  In January 2019, \njust before the Final Rules were scheduled to take effect, two federal courts preliminarily enjoined \nthem.  Pennsylvania v. Trump, 351 F. Supp. 3d 791 (E.D. Pa. 2019); California v. HHS, 351 F. \nSupp. 3d 1267 (N.D. Cal. 2019).  The U.S. Courts of Appeals for the Third and Ninth Circuits \naffirmed the preliminary injunctions. Pennsylvania v. President United States, 930 F.3d 543, 575-\n76 (3d Cir. 2019); California v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 941 F.3d 410, 431 (9th Cir. \n2019).  The government appealed, and the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the Third \nCircuit.  The Court held that the Final Rules were not procedurally defective under the APA and \nthat  the  Departments  had  statutory  authority  under  the  ACA  to  create  religious  and  moral \n \n4 These Final Rules were issued on November 7, 2018, and were published in the Federal Register \non November 15, 2018. Religious Exemptions and Accommodations for Coverage of Certain \nPreventative Services Under the Affordable Care Act, 83 Fed. Reg. 57,536 (Nov. 15, 2018); Moral \nExemptions and Accommodations for Coverage of Certain Preventative Services Under the \nAffordable Care Act, 83 Fed. Reg. 57,592 (Nov. 15, 2018) (collectively, the “Final Rules” or \n“Rules”). \n5 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 6 of 47\n \nexemptions  to  the  contraceptive  coverage  requirement.    The  Court  vacated  the  preliminary \ninjunctions from the Third and Ninth Circuits on that basis and remanded both cases for further \nconsideration. \n10.  The Supreme Court did not decide whether the Final Rules are arbitrary and \ncapricious under the APA, or whether the Rules violate the Establishment Clause of the First \nAmendment.  And no court has decided the legality of the Settlement Agreement. \n11.  Under the Rules and the Settlement Agreement, Plaintiffs and other women have \nincurred and will continue to incur greater costs to obtain contraception, and have been and will \ncontinue to be deterred or prevented from using the most appropriate method of contraception for \nthem.  Some women will be unable to obtain contraception altogether.  The Rules and the \nSettlement Agreement deprive Plaintiffs and other women of their right to make reproductive \ndecisions consistent with their own values and beliefs, imposing the religious beliefs of a select \nfew on individuals who may not share those beliefs and reinstating the discrimination against \nwomen that the contraceptive coverage requirement addressed.  And the Rules and Settlement \nAgreement are not narrowly tailored to address actual burdens on religious exercise.  They thus \npermit employers and universities to deny women access to contraceptive coverage in violation of \nthe Administrative Procedure Act and the U.S. Constitution. \n12.  For these reasons and others described below, this Court should vacate and set aside \nthe Rules, enjoin Defendants from enforcing or relying on the Rules, declare the Settlement \nAgreement between Notre Dame and the Departments void, and enjoin Defendants from enforcing \nor relying on the Settlement Agreement with respect to Notre Dame and the health plans that it \nsponsors. \n \n6 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 7 of 47\n \nPARTIES \n13.  Plaintiff Irish 4 Reproductive Health (“I4RH”) is an unincorporated association of \nundergraduate and graduate students in South Bend, Indiana, who attend Notre Dame.  The \norganization’s mission is to advocate for reproductive justice on campus and in the surrounding \ncommunity, including by securing access to insurance coverage for the full range of FDA-\napproved contraceptive methods and related services, education, and counseling, with no out-of-\npocket costs.  I4RH promotes human dignity by affording respect to all people to make moral \nchoices about their own lives, including whether and when to have children.  I4RH recognizes that \nsexual health is essential for overall well-being, and that access to reproductive health care, \neducation, and resources is necessary for realizing social, political, and gender equality—both at \nthe University and around the globe.  The students who would eventually form I4RH began \norganizing in the wake of the upheaval and uncertainty over the future of contraceptive coverage \nat the University.  Initially, the founding student members of I4RH came together to protest the \nUniversity’s October 2017 decision to terminate contraceptive coverage, see infra ¶¶ 124–25.  \nAfter the University temporarily reversed that decision in early November 2017, see infra ¶131, \nthe students continued to work to improve and expand access to reproductive health care at the \nUniversity and in the surrounding community.  The students formed I4RH on February 7, 2018, \nin response to the University’s letter of that date announcing its plan to terminate coverage for \ncertain methods of contraception, see infra ¶ 134–36.  Obtaining relief from Defendants’ unlawful \nSettlement Agreement and Rules is essential to realizing I4RH’s animating purpose and to further \nits broader mission of promoting and protecting reproductive health at the University and beyond.  \nSeveral members of I4RH will be personally harmed by the Settlement Agreement and the Rules.  \nFor example: \n7 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 8 of 47\n \na.  I4RH Member 1 is a graduate student at the University and lives in South \nBend, Indiana.  She is a woman of child-bearing age who is enrolled in the University’s student \nhealth-insurance plan and relies on that plan for all her medical needs, including contraceptives.  \nI4RH Member 1 uses an oral contraceptive that she refills every three months to prevent \npregnancy.  During the 2017-18 school year, I4RH Member 1 received contraceptive coverage \nwithout cost-sharing through the accommodation process from Aetna Student Health.  Through \nthe accommodation process, Aetna covered the full cost of I4RH Member 1’s oral contraceptive.  \nSince the changes to the University’s student health plan went into effect on August 15, 2018, \nI4RH Member 1 has paid coinsurance for her oral contraceptive out of pocket.  And though I4RH \nMember 1 would prefer to use an intrauterine device or contraceptive implant for medical reasons, \nshe is unable to switch to one of these preferred methods because the coinsurance for the device \nand associated office visits would be prohibitively expensive.  I4RH Member 1’s health care \nprovider has informed her that the coinsurance for either device alone would cost her $400–500 \nplus the cost of office visits. \nb.  I4RH Member 2 is a graduate student at the University and lives in South \nBend, Indiana.  She is a woman of child-bearing age who is enrolled in the University’s student \nhealth-insurance plan and relies on that plan for all her medical needs, including contraceptives.  \nFrom 2010 until June 2018, Member 2 used the NuvaRing, a hormonal contraceptive with no \ngeneric alternative, both to prevent pregnancy and to reduce pain during menstruation, which she \nhas experienced since suffering complications from a surgery.  During the 2017-18 school year, \nI4RH  Member  2  received  contraceptive  coverage  without  cost-sharing  through  the \naccommodation process from Aetna Student Health.  Through the accommodation process, Aetna \ncovered the full cost of I4RH Member 2’s NuvaRing.  Beginning August 15, 2018, Member 2 \n8 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 9 of 47\n \nhas had to pay coinsurance for her NuvaRing.  To avoid this added cost, Member 2 had to switch \nto  a  hormonal  long-acting  intrauterine  device  while  she  still  had  coverage  through  the \naccommodation.  Since August 15, 2018, Member 2 is subject to cost-sharing for removal or \nreplacement of the IUD and for help with complications should any occur, including the cost of \noffice visits related to her IUD. \nc.  I4RH Member 3 is a graduate student at the University and lives in South \nBend, Indiana.  She is a woman of child-bearing age who is enrolled in the University’s student \nhealth-insurance plan and relies on that plan for all her medical needs, including contraceptives.  \nI4RH Member 3 uses an oral contraceptive that she refills every three months to prevent \npregnancy.  I4RH Member 3 pays coinsurance for her oral contraceptive out of pocket every time \nshe refills her prescription. \nd.  All members of I4RH who rely on University-sponsored health insurance \nfor their contraceptive needs are subject to the University’s new contraceptive coverage policy.  \nAll members of I4RH who rely on University health insurance for their contraceptive needs are \nnow subject to cost-sharing for some contraceptive methods and are being deprived of coverage \nfor other methods.  As all members of I4RH enrolled in University-sponsored health insurance \nare subject to the same illegal University policy and seek the same form of relief, neither the \nclaims asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in this \nlawsuit. \n14.  Plaintiff Natasha Reifenberg is a recent graduate of the University and lives in \nSouth Bend, Indiana.  She is a woman of child-bearing age who is enrolled as a dependent in the \nUniversity’s faculty and staff health plan.  Ms. Reifenberg relies on that plan for all her medical \nneeds.  Ms. Reifenberg previously received coverage for her contraception without cost-sharing \n9 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 10 of 47\n \nthrough the accommodation process.  Ms. Reifenberg has used oral contraceptives in the past and \nlater had need to switch to a long-acting, reversible form of contraception going forward.  Ms. \nReifenberg was unable to obtain a long-acting form of contraception before the University’s \nrevised employee plan went into effect on July 1, 2018, because her OB-GYN had relocated, and \nshe had to undertake the process of finding a new doctor to provide this service.  Ms. Reifenberg \nhas since chosen an OB-GYN and arranged for insertion of a long-acting intrauterine device.  The \ncost of the device and the cost of the office visit for the insertion procedure were only 85% covered \nthrough Ms. Reifenberg’s health plan, and both were subject to a deductible.  Ms. Reifenberg is \nnow subject to cost-sharing for removal or replacement of the IUD and for help with complications \nshould any occur, including the cost of office visits related to her IUD.     \n15.  Plaintiff Jane Doe 1 is a graduate student at the University and lives in Granger, \nIndiana.  She is a woman of child-bearing age who is enrolled in the University’s student health-\ninsurance plan and relies on that plan for all her medical needs, including contraceptives.  Doe 1 \nuses an oral contraceptive that she refills every three months to prevent pregnancy.  During the \n2017-18 school year, Doe 1 received contraceptive coverage without cost-sharing through the \naccommodation process from Aetna Student Health.  Through the accommodation process, Aetna \npreviously  covered  the  full  cost  of  Doe 1’s  oral  contraception.    Since  the  changes  to  the \nUniversity’s student health plan went into effect on August 15, 2018, Doe 1 has paid coinsurance \nfor her oral contraceptive out of pocket. \n16.  Plaintiff Jane Doe 2 is the daughter of a professor at the University and lives in \nSouth Bend, Indiana.  She is a woman of child-bearing age who is enrolled as a dependent in the \nUniversity’s faculty and staff health plan and relies on that plan for all her medical needs, including \ncontraceptives.  Doe 2 received coverage for her contraception without cost-sharing through the \n10 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 11 of 47\n \naccommodation process until July 1, 2018.  Doe 2 uses an oral contraceptive both for non-\ncontraceptive medical purposes and to prevent pregnancy.  Through the accommodation process, \nOptumRx previously covered the full cost of Doe 2’s prescription.  Since the changes to the \nUniversity’s employee plan went into effect on July 1, 2018, Doe 2 has paid a copayment for her \noral contraceptive out of pocket.   \n17.  Plaintiff Jane Doe 3 is a recent professional school graduate student and lives in \nIllinois.  She is a woman of child-bearing age who is enrolled in Notre Dame’s faculty and staff \nhealth plan and relies on that plan for all her medical needs, including contraceptives.  Doe 3 \nreceived coverage for her contraception without cost-sharing through the accommodation process \nuntil July 1, 2018.  Doe 3 has been relying on oral contraception since 2013 to prevent pregnancy, \nto control acne, and to regulate her menstrual cycle.  Through the accommodation process, \nOptumRx previously covered the full cost of Doe 3’s oral contraception.  Since the changes to the \nUniversity’s employee plan went into effect on July 1, 2018, Doe 2 has paid a copayment for her \noral contraceptive out of pocket. \n18.

The Importance of Contraception \n22.  Regardless of their religious affiliation, 99% of women of reproductive age who \nhave had sexual intercourse report using at least one form of contraception at some point in their \nlives.  K. Daniels, W.D. Mosher & J. Jones, Contraceptive Methods Women Have Ever Used: \nUnited States, 1982–2010, National Health Statistics Reports, 2013, No. 62. \n23.  Contraception is critical to women’s and children’s health.   \n24.  Research has also shown that access to contraception improves the social and \neconomic status of women. \n25.  Contraception reduces unintended pregnancies, the need for abortion, adverse \npregnancy outcomes, and negative health consequences to women and children.  Inst. of Med., \nClinical Preventive Services for Women, Closing the Gaps, (“IOM Report”) at 102-109 (July 19, \n2011).5   \n26.  Contraception prevents unintended pregnancy, which can have severe negative \nconsequences for both women and their children.   \n27.  During an unintended pregnancy, a woman is more likely to receive delayed or no \nprenatal care, to be depressed, and to suffer from domestic violence.  Id. at 103.   \n28.  An unintended pregnancy may result in preterm birth and low birth weight.  Id. \n29.  Contraception allows women to postpone pregnancy and optimally space their \nchildren to avoid adverse consequences (e.g., low birth weight, premature birth) associated with \nmore than one pregnancy in 18 months.  Id. at 103. \n \n5 As of July 1, 2015, IOM changed its name to the National Academy of Medicine. It is part of the \nNational Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, which advise the nation on matters \nof science, technology, and health.  \n13 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 14 of 47\n \n30.  Contraception  is  highly  effective  in  treating  and  preventing  certain  health \nconditions.   \n31.  Contraception  decreases  the  risk  of  certain  cancers  (such  as  endometrial  and \novarian cancer), manages menstrual disorders, and protects against pelvic inflammatory disease \nand some breast diseases.  Id. at 107. \n32.  In addition, pregnancy may be dangerous to some women with certain chronic \nmedical conditions, such as diabetes, obesity, pulmonary hypertension, or heart disease.  Id. at 103. \n33.  When pregnancy is contraindicated, women may need contraception to delay \npregnancy until their medical conditions are under control or to prevent pregnancy throughout \ntheir lives.  Id. at 103-4. \n34.  In  a  national  study  conducted  in  2017,  22%  of  women  age  18-44  who  use \ncontraception said that they used contraceptives to manage a medical condition and prevent \npregnancy; 13% used contraceptives solely to manage a medical condition.  Caroline Rosenzweig \net al., Kaiser Family Found., Women’s Sexual and Reproductive Health Services: Key Findings \nfrom the 2017 Kaiser Women’s Health Survey 3 (2018), http://files.kff.org/attachment/Issue-Brief-\nWomens-Sexual-and-Reproductive-Health-Services-Key-Findings-from-the-2017-Kaiser-\nWomens-Health-Survey. \n35.  Women also rely on contraception to prevent pregnancy following a sexual assault \nand to prevent or delay pregnancy during public-health crises, such as the outbreak of the COVID-\n19 and Zika viruses. See Nat’l Women’s Law Ctr., Access to Contraceptives During the COVID-\n19 Pandemic and Recession (Jul. 2020), https://bit.ly/3aDb7ZG. \n36.  Access  to  contraception  has  been  proven  to  advance  women’s  equality  and \nparticipation in the social and economic life of this country. \n14 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 15 of 47\n \n37.  Studies show that contraception is directly linked to women’s increased educational \nand professional opportunities and increased lifetime earnings.  See, e.g., Jennifer J. Frost & Laura \nDuberstein Lindberg, Reasons for Using Contraception: Perspectives of US Women Seeking Care \nat Specialized Family Planning Clinics, 87 Contraception 465, 467 (2013); Adam Sonfield, et al., \nGuttmacher Inst., The Social and Economic Benefits of Women’s Ability to Determine Whether \nand  When  to  Have  Children  (2013),  http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/social-economic-\nbenefits.pdf. \n38.  The FDA Office of Women’s Health’s Birth Control Guide identifies 17 methods \nof birth control that are female controlled. See U.S. Food & Drug Admin., Birth Control Guide, \nhttps://www.fda.gov/media/135111/download (current as of Feb. 11, 2020). Contraceptives vary \nin effectiveness, duration, side effects, methods of action, and ease of use. Nonetheless, all new \ncontraceptive drugs and devices (just like other drugs and devices) must receive approval from the \nFDA, which requires showing through rigorous scientific testing that they are safe and effective.  \n39.  Not all women can tolerate all forms of contraception, and as the FDA has said:  \n“No one product is best for everyone.”  U.S. Food & Drug Admin., Birth Control Guide, \nhttps://www.fda.gov/media/135111/download.   \n40.  Thus,  women  need  insurance  coverage  of  all  FDA-approved  methods, \ncontraceptive counseling, and education to find the most appropriate method for them.   \n41.  Women using contraception also need insurance coverage for associated services \nthat assist them in understanding their contraceptive options, such as counseling with a health-care \nprovider to ensure the effectiveness and safety for them of their chosen form of contraception.  \nB.  Cost Barriers Impede Access to Contraception \n42.  Cost is often an impediment to women’s obtaining contraception.   \n15 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 16 of 47\n \n43.  Cost may influence women to avoid more effective but more expensive methods of \ncontraception or to forgo contraceptives altogether.   \n44.  Without insurance coverage, the most effective methods of contraception carry \nlarge up-front costs that make them unaffordable for many women.   \n45.  For example, without coverage, an IUD may cost up to $1,300.   \n46.  Studies show that the costs associated with contraception, even when small, lead \nwomen to forgo contraception completely, to choose less effective methods, or to use it inconsistently.  \nSee, e.g., Guttmacher Inst., A Real-Time Look at the Impact of the Recession on Women’s Family \nPlanning and Pregnancy Decisions 5 (Sept. 2009), http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/RecessionFP.pdf.  \nThis is particularly true during times of economic uncertainty.  Id.   \n47.  When costs lead women to forgo contraception completely, to choose less effective \nmethods, or to use it inconsistently, there is an increased risk of unintended pregnancy.  See, e.g., \nRachel Benson Gold, The Need for and Cost of Mandating Private Insurance Coverage for \nContraception, 1 Guttmacher Rep. on Pub. Pol’y 5, 6 (1998).   \n48.  Cost barriers to contraception in and of themselves not only threaten the economic \nsecurity of women and their families, but in undermining access to contraception they also threaten \nwomen’s long-term financial well-being, job security, workforce participation, and educational \nattainment. \nC.  The ACA and the Contraceptive Coverage Requirement \n49.  Since the ACA was passed by Congress and signed by the President in March 2010, \nit has extended accessible and affordable health-insurance coverage to millions of Americans and \nreduced sex discrimination in health care.   \n50.  To  ensure  that  health  insurance  remains  accessible  and  affordable,  the  ACA \n16 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 17 of 47\n \ncontains a number of critical provisions.   \n51.  Among  these  provisions  is  the  requirement  that  group  health  plans  include \ninsurance coverage for preventive health services with no cost-sharing.  42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a).   \n52.  To protect women’s health, to ensure that women do not pay more for insurance \ncoverage, and to advance women’s equality and well-being, Congress included the Women’s \nHealth Amendment in the ACA.   \n53.  The  Women’s  Health  Amendment  requires  insurance  plans  to  cover  certain \nwomen’s preventive health services without cost-sharing.  42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4). \n54.  Before the ACA was enacted, insurers had not consistently covered women’s \npreventive health services.   \n55.  Women had historically paid much more in out-of-pocket health costs, based \nlargely on significant costs for basic and necessary preventive care; and in some instances, women \nwere unable to obtain this care at all because of cost barriers.   \n56.  Congress included the Women’s Health Amendment in the ACA to help alleviate \nthe “punitive practices of insurance companies that charge women more and give [them] less in a \nbenefit” and to combat other forms of widespread sex discrimination in the health-insurance \nmarket.  155 Cong. Rec. S12,021, S12,026 (daily ed. Dec. 1, 2009) (statement of Sen. Mikulski).   \n57.  Congress specifically intended for the Women’s Health Amendment to improve \nwomen’s health by providing “affordable family planning services” to “enable women and \nfamilies to make informed decisions about when and how they become parents.” 155 Cong. Rec. \nS12,033, S12,052 (daily ed. Dec. 1, 2009) (statement of Sen. Franken). \n58.  Under the Women’s Health Amendment, Congress required the Health Resources \nand Services Administration (“HRSA”), a component of HHS, to adopt guidelines on the women’s \n17 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 18 of 47\n \npreventive-care services that must be covered under the ACA without cost-sharing. \n59.  Before issuing the Guidelines, HRSA commissioned the Institute of Medicine (now \nthe National Academy of Medicine) to convene a committee of experts on women’s health, \nadolescent health, disease prevention, and evidence-based guidelines, to conduct a comprehensive \nreview of women’s preventive-health needs and to produce a report.  See IOM Report (2011).   \n60.  Based on detailed findings—including findings that access to contraception reduces \nunintended  pregnancies,  abortions,  adverse  pregnancy  outcomes,  and  negative  health \nconsequences to women and children, and that even small cost-sharing requirements significantly \nreduce the use of contraception—this expert committee of the Institute of Medicine recommended \nthat HRSA include the “full range of Food and Drug Administration approved contraceptive \nmethods,  sterilization  procedures,  and  patient  education  and  counseling  for  women  with \nreproductive capacity” as one of eight critical preventive services for women.  Id. at 109-110. \n61.  In August 2011, HRSA adopted the required Guidelines, which accepted and \nimplemented in full the Institute of Medicine’s recommendation on contraception and seven other \npreventive  services  for  women.    See  HRSA,  Women’s  Preventive  Services  Guidelines, \nhttp://hrsa.gov/womens-guidelines. \n62.  To  date,  HRSA  has  not  removed  any  services  from  the  list  set  forth  in  the \nGuidelines  regarding  which  women’s  preventive  services  must  be  covered  for  a  group  or \nindividual health plan to comply with the ACA:  Contraceptive methods and counseling remain \nrequired benefits.  See HRSA, Women’s Preventive Services Guidelines, http://hrsa.gov/womens-\nguidelines.6   \n \n6 Following  issuance  of  the  Interim  Final  Rules,  language  was  added  in  a  footnote  to  the \n“contraceptive methods and counseling” line of the Guidelines with the text of the Religious and \n \n18 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 19 of 47\n \n63.  As recently as December 2016, a panel of experts convened by the American \nCollege  of  Obstetricians  and  Gynecologists,  through  a  cooperative  agreement  with  HRSA, \nreaffirmed  the  importance  of  the  ACA’s  contraceptive  coverage  requirement.    Women’s \nPreventive Services Initiative, Recommendations for Preventive Services for Women (2016), \nhttps://www.womenspreventivehealth.org/final-report/. \n64.  After the IOM Report and years of comments, the three departments primarily \nresponsible for implementing the Women’s Health Amendment—the Departments of Health and \nHuman  Services,  Labor,  and  Treasury—finalized  the  preventive-services  regulations,  which \nrequired coverage of all the women’s preventive-care services outlined in the Guidelines, including \nall FDA-approved methods of contraception and related education and counseling for women.  See \n45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv) (HHS); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv) (Labor); 26 C.F.R. \n§ 54.9815-2713(a)(1)(iv) (Treasury). \n65.  The  Departments  concluded  that  it  is  critical  to  extend  “any  coverage  of \ncontraceptive services under the HRSA Guidelines to as many women as possible.” 76 Fed. Reg. \n46,621, 46,623 (Aug. 3, 2011). \n66.  In various rulemakings, the Departments explained that they included contraceptive \nservices in these regulations based on the Departments’ factual findings regarding the benefits and \nefficacy of contraception and the critical importance of contraceptive coverage without cost-\nsharing for women’s health and equality. The Departments previously found that: \n \nMoral Exemption language.  Id.  The Guidelines on HRSA’s website have continued to include \nthis footnote, and thereby impermissibly tell entities that they may unilaterally opt out of providing \ncontraceptive coverage, even while the enabling Rules were subject to two nationwide preliminary \ninjunctions. \n19 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 20 of 47\n \na.  “[W]omen have unique health care needs” and “[s]uch needs include \ncontraceptive services.” 78 Fed. Reg. 39,872. \nb.  Contraceptives “reduc[e] the number of unintended pregnancies.” Id. \nc.   “[C]ontraceptive use helps women improve birth spacing and therefore \navoid the increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes that comes with pregnancies that are too \nclosely spaced.” Id. \nd.   “Contraceptives  also  have  medical  benefits  for  women  who  are \ncontraindicated  for  pregnancy,  and  there  are  demonstrated  preventive  health  benefits  from \ncontraceptives relating to conditions other than pregnancy (for example, prevention of certain \ncancers, menstrual disorders, and acne).” Id. \ne.  “It is for a woman and her health care provider in each particular case to \nweigh any risks against the benefits in deciding whether to use contraceptive services in general \nor any particular contraceptive service.” Id. \nf.  Before the ACA, disparities in health coverage “placed women in the \nworkforce at a disadvantage compared to their male coworkers,” and “[r]esearch shows that \naccess to contraception improves the social and economic status of women.” Id. at 39,873. \ng.  “Research also shows that cost sharing can be a significant barrier to access \nto contraception” and “eliminating cost sharing is particularly critical to addressing the gender \ndisparity [in health coverage].” Id. \nh.  “Contraceptive  coverage,  by  reducing  the  number  of  unintended  and \npotentially unhealthy pregnancies, furthers the goal of eliminating [the gender] disparity [in health \ncoverage] by allowing women to achieve equal status as healthy and productive members of the \njob force.”  77 Fed. Reg. 8,725, 8,728 (Feb. 15, 2012). \n20 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 21 of 47\n \n67.  HRSA also explained that contraception is “necessary for women’s health and well-\nbeing.”  HRSA, Women’s Preventive Services Guidelines, www.hrsa.gov/womens-guidelines. \nD.  Religious Objections to Contraceptive Coverage, and the Accommodation Process \n68.  Houses of worship were and continue to be exempt from the ACA’s contraceptive \ncoverage requirement. \n69.  Certain religiously affiliated employers and universities that did not qualify for the \nhouse-of-worship exemption objected to providing health-insurance coverage for contraception to \nemployees and students and their dependents.   \n70.  To accommodate these entities’ objections while still ensuring that women at the \nentities receive access to seamless, affordable contraceptive coverage, the Departments developed \nand  made  available  an  “accommodation”  process  for  certain  religiously  affiliated  nonprofit \ninstitutions.  See 78 Fed. Reg. 39,870, 39,871 (July 2, 2013).7 \n71.  When  revising  their  regulations  to  create  the  accommodation  process,  the \nDepartments reiterated their finding that “providing more women broad access to recommended \npreventive services, including contraceptive services, without cost sharing” advances “compelling \npublic health and gender equity interests.” 78 Fed. Reg. 39,873. Specifically, the Departments \nexplained:  “[T]he  contraceptive  coverage  requirement  serves  two  compelling  governmental \ninterests. The contraceptive coverage requirement furthers the government’s compelling interest \n \n7 While the term “accommodation” has been used as a shorthand in this context to mean the ability \nof certain qualifying employers and universities to refuse to provide the contraceptive coverage on \ngiving notice (so that the government may ensure that separate payments for contraception will be \nmade by the entity’s insurer or third-party administrator), and the term “exemption” has been used \nto mean the ability to opt out of providing the coverage without giving notice (leaving employees \nand students without coverage through their regular insurance plan), a “religious accommodation” \nis merely an exemption from a general legal requirement on religious grounds.  See generally Corp. \nof the Presiding Bishop v. Amos, 483 U.S. 327 (1987). \n21 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 22 of 47\n \nin safeguarding public health by expanding access to and utilization of recommended preventive \nservices for women. . . .  The government also has a compelling interest in assuring that women \nhave equal access to health care services. Women would be denied the full benefits of preventive \ncare if their unique health care needs were not considered and addressed. . . .  The contraceptive \ncoverage requirement helps remedy this problem [of gender disparities in health outcomes] by \nhelping to equalize the provision of preventive health care services to women and, as a result, \nhelping women contribute to society to the same degree as men.” 78 Fed. Reg. 39,887. \n72.  The Departments also determined that this accommodation process poses “no \nburden on any religious exercise,” 78 Fed. Reg. 39,887, and in all events is the “least restrictive \nmeans” of furthering their compelling interests in the contraceptive coverage requirement, id. The \nDepartments explained that they considered all proposed alternatives suggested by commenters, \n“and it was determined that they were not feasible and/or would not advance the government’s \ncompelling interests as effectively.” 78 Fed. Reg. 39,888. \n73.  The Departments made the accommodation final only after reviewing a total of \napproximately 600,000 comments on the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Notice of \nProposed Rulemaking.   \n74.  The accommodation was later extended to certain closely held, for-profit entities \nwith religious objections to contraception, in response to the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in \nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751 (2014).  See 80 Fed. Reg. 41,318 (July 14, \n2015).   \n75.  The  Departments  made  the  extension  of  the  accommodation  final  only  after \nreviewing  approximately  75,000  comments  in  response  to  the  related  Notice  of  Proposed \nRulemaking. \n22 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 23 of 47\n \n76.  The accommodation allows an objecting entity either to sign a form (EBSA Form \n700) stating its objection to providing contraceptive coverage and submit that form to the entity’s \ninsurance company, or otherwise to notify the federal government of its objection.  26 C.F.R. \n§ 54.9815-2713A (2015). \n77.  After this notification, the insurance company or third-party administrator provides \nor arranges for separate payments for contraceptive services directly to the affected women, \nwithout cost-sharing.  Id. \n78.  Thus,  under  the  accommodation,  an  objecting  entity  is  entirely  relieved  of \n“contracting, arranging, paying, or referring for contraceptive coverage,” while the women who \nare employees, students, or dependents receive the required coverage from their regular insurance \ncompany, without cost-sharing. \n79.  A  number  of  entities  that  were  eligible  for  the  accommodation  nevertheless \nchallenged  it,  contending  that  merely  filling  out  the  accommodation  form  or  notifying  the \ngovernment of their objection violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”) and the \nU.S. Constitution.   \n80.  The objecting employers and universities argued that providing notification in order \nto opt out of the ACA’s contraceptive coverage requirement is a “trigger” to women’s receiving \ncontraceptive coverage, even though the objecting entities are not required to provide the coverage. \n81.  Several of these entities filed lawsuits.  The Departments repeatedly maintained in \nlitigation their position that the accommodation process does not substantially burden religious \nexercise. \n82.  Eight of the nine federal courts of appeals to consider these cases flatly rejected the \nchallenges.  See, e.g., Eternal Word Television Network, Inc. v. Sec’y of U.S. Dep’t Health & \n23 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 24 of 47\n \nHuman Servs., 818 F.3d 1122, 1148–51 (11th Cir. 2016); Little Sisters of Poor House v.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that the accommodation \nprocess does not substantially burden Notre Dame’s exercise of religion and therefore does not \nviolate RFRA.

The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari in seven of the cases and ultimately \nvacated and remanded all the cases with the instruction that the parties “should be afforded an \nopportunity to arrive at an approach going forward that “accommodates [the entities’] religious \nexercise while at the same time ensuring that women covered by [the entities’] health plans receive \nfull and equal health coverage, including contraceptive coverage.”  Zubik v. Burwell, 136 S. Ct. \n1557, 1560 (2016) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \n85.  On  July  22,  2016,  in  light  of  the  Supreme  Court’s  decision  in  Zubik,  the \nDepartments issued a Request for Information (“RFI”) to solicit from interested parties comments \n24 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 25 of 47\n \non “whether there are alternative ways (other than those offered in current regulations) for eligible \norganizations that object to providing coverage for contraceptive services on religious grounds to \nobtain an accommodation, while still ensuring that women enrolled in the organizations’ health \nplans have access to seamless coverage of the full range of Food and Drug Administration-\napproved contraceptives without cost sharing.”  81 Fed. Reg. 47,741 (July 22, 2016). \n86.  After reviewing approximately 54,000 public comments, the federal government \nconcluded on January 9, 2017, that “the comments reviewed by the Departments in response to \nthe RFI indicate that no feasible approach has been identified at this time that would resolve the \nconcerns of religious objectors, while still ensuring that affected women receive full and equal \nhealth coverage, including contraceptive coverage,” so “the Departments continue to believe that \nthe existing accommodation regulations are consistent with RFRA . . . .”  Dept. of Labor, FAQs \nAbout  Affordable  Care  Act  Implementation  Part  36,  at  4-5  (Jan.  9,  2017), \nhttps://www.dol.gov/sites/default/files/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/aca-\npart-36.pdf. \n87.  Meanwhile, the various Zubik cases were held in abeyance while the parties \nattempted to work out resolutions to the litigation. \n88.  According to court filings in those cases, the federal government met numerous \ntimes with entities challenging the coverage requirement to discuss resolution of the claims \nconcerning the accommodation process. \n89.  Although Notre Dame students were intervenors in the University’s challenge to \nthe contraceptive coverage requirement, they were not permitted to participate in that process (see \nStatus Report of Intervenors-Appellees at 2, Univ. of Notre Dame v. Price, No. 13-3853 (7th Cir. \nOct. 2, 2017)).   \n25 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 26 of 47\n \nE.  The Interim Final Rules and Final Rules \n90.  President Trump issued an Executive Order on May 4, 2017, titled “Promoting Free \nSpeech and Religious Liberty,” directing issuance of the type of Rules challenged here.  Exec. \nOrder No. 13,798, 82 Fed. Reg. 21,675 (May 4, 2017).   \n91.  The Order states that, regarding the “Conscience Protections with Respect to \nPreventive-Care Mandate,” “[t]he Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, and the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services shall consider issuing amended regulations, consistent \nwith applicable law, to address conscience-based objections to the preventive-care mandate \npromulgated under section 300gg-13(a)(4) of title 42, United States Code.”  \n92.  Without any public notice and comment or other pre-promulgation mechanism for \nreceiving input from the public, the Departments issued the Interim Final Rules on October 6, 2017.   \n93.  The Interim Final Rules took effect immediately. \n94.  Only after the Interim Final Rules went into effect did the Departments solicit \ncomments from the public. \n95.  In December 2017, two district courts entered nationwide preliminary injunctions \ntemporarily blocking the Interim Final Rules from taking effect.  See Pennsylvania v. Trump, 281 \nF. Supp. 3d 553 (E.D. Pa. 2017); California v. HHS, 281 F. Supp. 3d 806 (N.D. Cal. 2017).  Both \ndecisions were appealed. \n96.  Despite two federal court injunctions prohibiting the Interim Final Rules from \ntaking effect, the Departments issued Final Rules on November 7, 2018, with an effective date of \nJanuary 14, 2019.  The Final Rules finalize the Interim Final Rules in all material respects and are \nas substantively unlawful as the Interim Final Rules. \n97.  The Final Rules, like the IFRs, dramatically expand the scope of the exemption and \n26 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 27 of 47\n \nthe types of entities that can claim it, allowing the covered entities to choose whether they will \nparticipate in the accommodation process or whether they will instead affirmatively prevent \nemployees and students from receiving contraceptive coverage.  \n98.  The latter approach has the effect of denying Plaintiffs and other women coverage \nto which they are otherwise legally entitled. \n99.  The Final Rules, like the IFRs, broaden the entities eligible for an exemption so that \nalmost any university, nonprofit, for-profit business (whether publicly or privately held), or other \nnongovernmental employer may refuse to cover contraception in its group health plans without \nnotifying the government. \n100.  Through the Final Rules, like the IFRs, the Departments also impermissibly attempt \nto broaden the permissible grounds for seeking the exemption, from sincerely held religious beliefs \nto sincerely held religious beliefs or sincerely held moral convictions.  \n101.  The  Final  Rules,  like  the  IFRs,  make  optional  the  previously  required \naccommodation process for objecting entities, which was designed to ensure that employees and \nstudents would continue to receive seamless contraceptive coverage.   \n102.  Under the Final Rules, like the IFRs, an employer, university, or insurance issuer \nmay claim an exemption and deny coverage, so that the insureds will no longer have seamless \ncontraceptive coverage. \n103.  The Final Rules lack adequate justification. \n104.  The Rules exempt virtually all nongovernmental employers and universities with \nreligious or moral objections to the contraceptive coverage requirement—even those who have no \nobjection  to  the  accommodation  process  and  have  not  asserted,  much  less  demonstrated,  a \nsubstantial burden on their religious exercise.  \n27 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 28 of 47\n \n105.  And the Rules abandon without reasoned explanation HHS’s factual findings that \nthe accommodation poses “no burden on any religious exercise” and that there are no feasible \nalternatives to the accommodation process. 78 Fed. Reg. 39,887–88; see also supra ¶¶ 72, 86.  \n106.  The Final Rules also fail to account for the devastating impact on the health, \neconomic security, equality, and autonomy of people who are denied contraceptive coverage.  See \ninfra Part H.  \n107.  The Rules abandon, without reasoned explanation, HHS’s prior factual findings \nregarding  the  benefits  of  contraception  to  women’s  health  and  equality,  as  well  as  HHS’s \nconclusion that the government has “compelling public health and gender equity interests” in \nensuring coverage of contraception without cost-sharing.  See supra ¶¶ 65–67, 71. Instead, the \nDepartments reproduce, without analysis, scientifically debunked assertions from commenters that \npurport to question the efficacy, safety, and importance of contraception, ignoring that the FDA \nhas, after rigorous scientific testing, approved contraceptive drugs and devices as safe and effective.  \n83 Fed. Reg. at 57,552–57,555; see also Comments of Am. Coll. of Obstetricians & Gynecologists, \nthe American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine, CMS–\n9940–IFC, at 2 (Dec. 5, 2017) (“Policies that affect individuals’ access to health care should have \na positive impact on public health, and be based on science, not on falsehoods that are not \nsupported by medical evidence. . . We oppose public policy that deviates from accepted science \nand public health evidence, as well as any non-scientific prohibitions on essential care.”). \n108.  Likewise, in citing data questioning the benefits and risks of contraception, the \nDepartments  ignore  without  any  explanation—reasoned  or  otherwise—their  previous \ndetermination that “[i]t is for a woman and her health care provider,” not the Departments, “in \neach particular case to weigh any risks against the benefits in deciding whether to use contraceptive \n28 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 29 of 47\n \nservices in general or any particular contraceptive service.” 78 Fed. Reg. 39,872. \n109.  Critically, the Rules ignore the substantial empirical and scientific data supporting \nthe Departments’ previous findings regarding the benefits and effectiveness of contraception and \ncontraceptive coverage—data and findings that were also submitted in comments opposing the \nRules’ expansive exemptions, including by leading medical organizations, see supra ¶ 107.  \n110.  The Rules also entirely fail to consider the serious reliance interests at stake.  \nNationwide, women and others who can become pregnant have chosen universities, employers, \nhealth plans, and their method of contraception with the understanding that their contraception \nwould be covered.   \n111.  Finally, the Departments’ regulatory-impact analysis fails to consider the actual \ncosts of the Rules.  Despite the Departments’ assertion that neither rule would be economically \nsignificant, the Office of Management and Budget classified the Rules as a “significant regulatory \naction” (see Section 3(f)(4) of Executive Order 12,866) because they raise “novel or legal policy \nissues”—thus triggering the requirement of a regulatory-impact analysis.  The Departments’ \nregulatory-impact analysis disregards significant direct and indirect costs identified by commenters, \nin violation of Executive Order 12,866. HHS also ignores instructions from both the Office of \nManagement and Budget’s Circular A-4 on Regulatory Analysis (2003) and HHS’s own Guidelines \nfor Regulatory Impact Analysis (2016), which detail best practices for assessing costs and benefits \nin regulatory-impact analyses and require that agencies account for and quantify both direct and \nindirect health costs to the fullest extent practicable. Yet HHS failed to account for the full scope \nof the Rules’ costs to women and others who will lose contraceptive coverage—not only the \nfinancial costs, but also the adverse effects on the health, economic security, equality, and autonomy \nof patients who lose or are delayed in access to contraception as a result of increased cost and other \n29 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 30 of 47\n \nbarriers.  HHS has failed to acknowledge that these are legitimate and actual costs of the Rules and \nfailed to incorporate them into its cost-benefit analysis. \nF.  The Settlement Agreement \n112.  On October 13, 2017, just one week after the Departments issued the Interim Final \nRules, and the same day that the Interim Final Rules were published in the Federal Register, the \nGovernment Defendants executed the Settlement Agreement, which purported to resolve several \npending cases challenging the accommodation process.   \n113.  The Government Defendants executed the Settlement Agreement with Notre Dame, \ndisposing of the University’s ongoing legal dispute.  The Settlement Agreement also resolved \nseparate legal challenges with more than 70 other private entities.   \n114.  Among other terms, the Settlement Agreement purports to exempt Notre Dame and \nthe health plans that it sponsors from complying with either the existing contraceptive coverage \nrequirement or any “materially similar regulation or agency policy” in the future (Exhibit A at 4).   \n115.  The Settlement Agreement states that “[n]o person may receive [contraceptive \ncoverage] as an automatic consequence of enrollment in any health plan sponsored by Plaintiffs” \n(Exhibit A at 4).     \n116.  The Settlement Agreement also retroactively rescinds penalties for noncompliance \nwith the contraceptive coverage requirement, providing that no fines should have been assessed \n(Exhibit A at 6). \n117.  By these provisions, the Government Defendants purport to grant private entities, \nincluding Notre Dame, a contractual right to deny contraceptive coverage to women who rely on \ntheir health plans. \n118.  As a justification for this unlawful action, the Settlement Agreement relied on “the \n30 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 31 of 47\n \nnew regulations,” notwithstanding that those Interim Final Rules were themselves unlawful \n(Exhibit A at 2). \n119.  The Settlement Agreement further awards the private entities $3 million in costs \nand fees for their legal counsel, the law firm Jones Day (Exhibit A at 7).  \n120.  Despite repeated requests by the students who intervened in the University’s \nlawsuit to be included in settlement negotiations, the intervenors were excluded from all settlement \ndiscussions and were never informed by either the Defendant University or the Government \nDefendants that a settlement agreement had been negotiated or executed.  See, e.g., Univ. of Notre \nDame v. Price, No. 13-3853 (7th Cir.), Status Report of Intervenors-Appellees at 2, (filed Oct. 2, \n2017), Status Report of Intervenors-Appellees, Dkt. 152 (filed Aug. 31, 2017). \n121.  No  court  was  informed  of,  reviewed,  or  judicially  confirmed  the  Settlement \nAgreement. \n122.  Neither the U.S. Department of Justice nor any of the Defendant agencies issued a \npublic press release announcing the Settlement Agreement.8   \n123.  Notre  Dame  voluntarily  dismissed  its  lawsuit  concerning  the  contraceptive \ncoverage requirement on October 19, 2017, less than two weeks after the Interim Final Rules were \nissued, and just days after executing the secret Settlement Agreement, although neither Plaintiffs \nhere nor the student-intervenors in Notre Dame’s suit were informed about or aware of the \nSettlement Agreement at that time, and notwithstanding that their rights were directly affected \n \n8 See U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Justice News, https://www.justice.gov/news (listing all press releases \nand revealing that no release was issued about the Settlement Agreement); U.S. Dep’t of Health & \nHuman  Servs.,  2017  News  Releases,  https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2017-news-\nreleases/index.html#October  (same);  U.S.  Dep’t  of  Labor,  Newsroom, \nhttps://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/date/2017/October (same); U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, Press \nReleases, https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases (same).   \n31 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 32 of 47\n \nthereby.  See Univ. of Notre Dame v. Sebelius, No. 13-cv-1276 (N.D. Ind.); Univ. of Notre Dame \nv. Price, No. 13-3853 (7th Cir.) (appeal dismissed October 17, 2017). \nG.  Notre Dame’s Changes to Contraceptive Coverage \n124.  On October 27, 2017, Notre Dame announced in e-mails to students, faculty, and \nstaff its intention to withdraw contraceptive coverage from its health plans beginning in the new \nplan years. \n125.  After the University’s October 27 announcement, students began to organize in \nresponse to the University’s decision to withdraw contraceptive coverage.   \n126.  Students who would soon form Plaintiff I4RH collected 516 signatures from \nundergraduate students, graduate students, faculty, and alumni on a statement condemning the \nUniversity’s decision to withdraw contraceptive coverage.   \n127.  During this same period, individuals covered by Notre Dame’s health plans— \nincluding some of the Plaintiffs in this case9—filed lawsuits against the Departments, challenging \nthe Interim Final Rules that had given rise to the University’s announced policy changes.   \n128.  Several Notre Dame students filed a lawsuit in this Court.  Shiraef v. Hargan, 3:17-\ncv-817 (N.D. Ind.) (filed October 31, 2017).   \n129.  Two other Notre Dame students, along with a national student association, filed a \nlawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.  Medical Students for Choice v. \nWright, 1:17-cv-02096, (D.D.C.) (filed on October 10, 2017). \n130.  Following public expression of serious concerns from students, alumni, and faculty, \nthe University soon reversed course on its decision to terminate contraceptive coverage.   \n131.  In early November 2017, the University sent e-mails to students, faculty, and staff \n \n9 The plaintiffs in these prior suits included Plaintiffs Natasha Reifenberg and Jane Doe 2. \n32 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 33 of 47\n \nannouncing that it would “not interfere” with the provision of contraceptive coverage to students \nby Aetna or to faculty and staff by Meritain Health and OptumRx. \n132.  In reliance on Notre Dame’s statements that it would “not interfere” with the \nprovision of contraceptive coverage by the insurance companies, the plaintiffs in the cases \nidentified in Paragraphs 128 and 129 filed notices of voluntarily dismissal.   \n133.  The Courts granted voluntary dismissal of the District of Columbia and Northern \nDistrict of Indiana cases without prejudice on February 6 and 7, 2018. \n134.  Also on February 7, immediately after the dismissal orders were entered, the \nUniversity again reversed course, announcing that it would, in fact, be terminating insurance \ncoverage for certain FDA-approved methods of contraception.  For employees, the change would \ntake effect on July 1, 2018, in the middle of the plan year; for students, the change would take \neffect beginning with the new plan year, in August 2018. \n135.  In  justifying  this  change  in  coverage,  the  University  publicly  invoked  the \nSettlement Agreement as independent authority.10   \n136.  As explained in two letters sent on February 7, 2018, by Notre Dame’s President, \nJohn Jenkins, to “Aetna Student Health Enrollees” and to “Faculty and Staff,” a “favorable” \nsettlement with the U.S. government purportedly gave “the University, its insurers and third party \nadministrators the option of an exemption from providing” coverage for all FDA-approved \nmethods of contraception without cost-sharing.  Jenkins’s letters did not state which contraceptive \nmethods would continue to be covered and which would not.   \n137.  Following the February 7 announcements, students, faculty, and staff were left \n \n10 The University has subsequently also stated that Notre Dame considers itself “fully exempt from \nthe [contraceptive coverage] mandate” under “current regulations.”  ECF No. 35-1 at 8. \n33 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 34 of 47\n \nguessing whether their methods of contraception would remain covered. \n138.  On March 25, 2018, University Health Services circulated a “Health Care Coverage \nUpdate” to students, which directed students to review a “Frequently Asked Questions about \nContraceptive  Coverage”  (“FAQ”)  webpage  for  more  information  about  the  changes  to \ncontraceptive coverage in the student health plan.  \n139.  The FAQ explains that the University will provide no coverage for copper IUDs or \nemergency contraceptives.   \n140.  The FAQ also explains that even though the University said that it will “cover” \ncertain methods of contraception, it will require students to pay sums out-of-pocket for any covered \ncontraceptive method, in direct contravention of the Women’s Health Amendment, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 300gg-13(a)(4), and implementing regulations.   \n141.  According  to  the  FAQ,  students  must  pay  the  same  out-of-pocket  costs  for \ncontraception covered by the plan as for other prescription drugs.   \n142.  On April 30, 2018, Plaintiff I4RH sent Notre Dame President Jenkins an “insurance \nclarity petition” with more than 100 signatures from Notre Dame undergraduates, graduate \nstudents, alumni, faculty, and staff, demanding additional details about the University’s announced \nchanges to contraceptive coverage.   \n143.  The petition also expressed disapproval of the change in policy and the “lack of \ntransparency that has characterized the [university] administration’s every move on this issue since \nOctober 2017.”   \n144.  On May 4, 2018, Ann Firth, Chief of Staff in the Notre Dame Office of the President, \nresponded to I4RH that the University would not issue any more details about the Aetna student \nhealth plan until July 1, which was after matriculating and returning students would already have \n34 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 35 of 47\n \nto commit to their programs. \n145.  Throughout the course of the two years since Notre Dame’s announcement, the \nUniversity has been relying on the Settlement Agreement and Rules to deny certain contraceptive \ncoverage altogether and/or to deny any contraceptive coverage without cost-sharing.  Plaintiffs \nand others have thus not had access to insurance coverage of some preferred methods of FDA-\napproved contraception.  For example, at least one member of I4RH was unable to obtain either a \nhormonal IUD or implant, their preferred methods of contraception, because the cost would be \n“prohibitively expensive.” See supra ¶ 13(a).  To the extent Plaintiffs and others on Notre Dame’s \nhealth plans have been able to obtain coverage contraceptive coverage, they have been required to \ndo so with a co-pay and/or subject to a deductible.     \nH.  Effect of the Rules and Settlement Agreement \n146.  The  expanded  exemptions  in  the  Rules  effectively  nullify  the  contraceptive \ncoverage requirement, including regulations that took over six years to promulgate and involved \nmultiple consultations with expert committees as well as six rounds of notice-and-comment \nrulemaking in the form of Advanced Notices of Proposed Rulemaking, Notices of Proposed \nRulemaking, Interim Final Rules with comment periods, and Requests for Information, which \ntogether elicited more than 725,000 comments.   \n147.  The Settlement Agreement and other similar settlements, separate and apart from \nthe Rules, constitute a general policy not to enforce the contraceptive coverage requirement, and \neffectively nullify the contraceptive coverage requirement as to its signatories and unknown \nrelated entities offering coverage through the health plan of a signatory. Indeed, the Government \nDefendants have refused to substantively defend all litigation challenging the contraceptive \ncoverage requirement. \n35 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 36 of 47\n \n148.  The expanded exemptions in the Rules allow virtually any employer or university \nto evade the contraceptive coverage requirement and thereby to harm women by imposing their \nreligious and moral views on employees and students.   \n149.  The Rules, the Settlement Agreement, and any other similar settlements create a \nmajor change in law.   \n150.  The Rules, the Settlement Agreement, and any other similar settlements establish \nand impose one subset of religious views while denying health care to those with different beliefs.   \n151.  The result is that Plaintiffs and other women are denied coverage for contraception \nand related services and thus are harmed. \n152.  The expanded exemptions jeopardize the health, economic security, and equality of \nmore than 62 million women who currently have coverage for all FDA-approved contraceptive \nmethods and related education and counseling without out-of-pocket costs.  See Nat’l Women’s \nLaw Center, New Data Estimate 61.4 Million Women Have Coverage of Birth Control without \nOut-of-Pocket Costs (Dec. 2019), https://bit.ly/3gcpmpi. \n153.  The Rules, the Settlement Agreement, and any other similar settlements reinstate \nthe cost barriers to contraceptive care. \n154.  Additionally,  the  Rules,  the  Settlement  Agreement,  and  any  other  similar \nsettlements impose other significant informational, administrative, and logistical burdens on \nPlaintiffs and other women, who will need to navigate finding other sources of contraceptive care.   \n155.  Some women will not have access to contraception at all because of the Rules, the \nSettlement Agreement, and any other similar settlements.   \n156.  Congress included the Women’s Health Amendment in the ACA to improve \nwomen’s health by removing cost and access barriers, to protect women’s economic security, and \n36 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 37 of 47\n \nto remedy systemic sex discrimination in the insurance market.   \n157.  Yet by means of the Rules, the Settlement Agreement, and other similar settlements, \nthe Departments authorize and enable employers and universities to exempt themselves from the \ncontraceptive coverage requirement and prevent plan participants and beneficiaries from receiving \nthe coverage through the accommodation, thus shifting to women, who are supposed to receive \nthe  coverage,  the  burdens  and  costs  of  supporting  and  underwriting  their  employers’  and \nuniversities’ religious beliefs, while at the same time directly undermining the legislative purposes \nof the Women’s Health Amendment. \n158.  The  Rules,  the  Settlement  Agreement,  and  other  similar  settlements  create \nunreasonable barriers to critical health care services for Plaintiffs and countless other women. \n159.  The Rules, the Settlement Agreement, and other similar settlement agreements fail \nto account for these important interests, are not narrowly tailored to address actual burdens on \nreligious exercise, and lack adequate justification. \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION—GOVERNMENT DEFENDANTS \n(Settlement Agreement Violates the Administrative Procedure Act) \n160.  The foregoing allegations are re-alleged and incorporated by reference as if restated \nfully here. \n161.  Plaintiffs are entitled to relief under the Administrative Procedure Act because the \nSettlement Agreement is illegal under and contrary to controlling orders and precedential decisions \nof the federal courts, federal statutes, and the U.S. Constitution. \n162.  HHS, the Department of Labor, and the Department of the Treasury are “agencies” \nunder the Administrative Procedure Act.  See 5 U.S.C. § 551(1). \n163.  The Government Defendants’ decision to enter into the Settlement Agreement is a \nfinal agency action subject to judicial review under 5 U.S.C. § 551(13) and 5 U.S.C. § 704. \n37 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 38 of 47\n \n164.  The Administrative Procedure Act requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside” \nany agency action, finding, or conclusion that is “an abuse of discretion,” “not in accordance with \nthe  law,”  or  “contrary  to  constitutional  right,  power,  privilege,  or  immunity.”    5  U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A)-(C). \n165.  The Settlement Agreement is contrary to the Establishment Clause of the First \nAmendment because, among other constitutional defects, it prefers some religious beliefs and \ndenominations over others and imposes costs, burdens, and harms on Plaintiffs to favor the \nreligious beliefs of the University. \n166.  The  Settlement  Agreement  is  unlawful  because  it  exceeds  the  Government \nDefendants’ settlement authority, in contravention of law and long-standing, binding Department \nof Justice policy. The Government Defendants are prohibited from entering into settlement \nagreements that “limit[] the discretion of a[n executive] department or agency” or that would \nconvert a federal agency’s discretionary authority into a mandatory duty for the agency. See \nMemorandum from Edwin Meese III, Attorney General, to all Assistant Attorneys General and \nAll United States Attorneys 3 (Mar. 13, 1986) (the “Meese Memo”), reprinted in U.S. Dep’t of \nJustice, Office of Legal Pol’y, Guidelines on Constitutional Litigation 150, 152–53 (Feb. 19, 1988). \n167.  The Settlement Agreement is contrary to law because it violates the Women’s \nHealth Amendment, the Final Rules, and the previously operative implementing regulations (see \n78 Fed. Reg. 39,870; 80 Fed. Reg. 41,318) by allowing group health plans and health insurance \nissuers to charge copayments, coinsurance, or deductibles for contraception that they otherwise \ncover without objection, in contravention of the statute’s requirement that they “shall not impose \nany cost sharing requirements.”  \n38 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 39 of 47\n \n168.  The  Settlement  Agreement  is  contrary  to  law  because  it  violates  the  lawful \nregulations implementing the Women’s Health Amendment —i.e., the regulations operative prior \nto the Final Rules (see 78 Fed. Reg. 39,870; 80 Fed. Reg. 41,318)—by allowing group health plans \nand health insurance issuers to refuse to comply with the accommodation process and in doing so \nto prevent plan participants and beneficiaries from receiving the contraceptive coverage to which \nthey are entitled under those regulations. \n169.  By entering an illegal Settlement Agreement, the Government Defendants abused \ntheir discretion in violation of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n170.  Because the Government Defendants’ actions are “not in accordance with law,” are \n“in excess of authority,” are “contrary to constitutional right,” and are “an abuse of discretion,” \nthe Government Defendants have violated the Administrative Procedure Act. \n171.  Absent declaratory and injunctive relief, the Government Defendants’ violations \nwill cause ongoing harm to Plaintiffs. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION—ALL DEFENDANTS \n(Settlement Agreement is Void for Illegality) \n172.  The foregoing allegations are re-alleged and incorporated by reference as if restated \nfully here. \n173.  Under  federal  common  law,  contracts  that  are  illegal  are  void  ab  initio  and \nunenforceable. See, e.g., U.S. Nursing Corp. v. Saint Joseph Med. Ctr., 39 F.3d 790, 792 (7th Cir. \n1994); Zimmer, Inc. v. Nu Tech Med., Inc., 54 F. Supp. 2d 850, 863 (N.D. Ind. 1999). \n174.  The Settlement Agreement is illegal under and contrary to controlling orders and \nprecedential decisions of federal courts, federal statutes, and the U.S. Constitution.   \n175.  The Settlement Agreement violates:  \na.  The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \n39 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 40 of 47\n \nb.  Long-standing and binding Department of Justice policy that precludes \nGovernment Defendants from entering into settlement agreements that would convert a federal \nagency’s discretionary authority into a mandatory duty for the agency. \nc.  The Women’s Health Amendment, 42 U.S.C. § 300gg–13, to the extent \nthat the Settlement Agreement allows group health plans and health insurance issuers to charge \ncopayments, coinsurance, or deductibles for contraception that they otherwise are willing to cover, \nin contravention of the statute’s requirement that they “shall not impose any cost sharing \nrequirements.”  \nd.  Lawful regulations implementing the Women’s Health Amendment, 78 Fed. \nReg. 39,870; 80 Fed. Reg. 41,318. \n176.  The Settlement Agreement is null and void ab initio because it is illegal. \n177.  Absent declaratory and injunctive relief voiding the Settlement Agreement and \nenjoining its enforcement, Defendants’ violations will cause ongoing harm to Plaintiffs. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION—GOVERNMENT DEFENDANTS \n(Administrative Procedure Act—The Final Rules Violate the Substantive Requirements of \nthe Administrative Procedure Act) \n178.  The foregoing allegations are re-alleged and incorporated by reference as if restated \nfully here. \n179.  Plaintiffs are entitled to relief under the Administrative Procedure Act because the \nRules are illegal under the Constitution and federal statutes. \n180.  The Administrative Procedure Act requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside” \nany agency action, finding, or conclusion that is “arbitrary,” “capricious,” “an abuse of discretion,” \n“not in accordance with the law,” “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity,” \nor “in excess of statutory . . . authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.”  5 U.S.C. \n40 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 41 of 47\n \n§ 706(2)(A)-(C). \n181.  The Rules are contrary to the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. \n182.  The Rules are arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion in violation of the \nAdministrative  Procedure  Act,  5  U.S.C.  §  706(2)(A),  because,  among  other  reasons,  the \nDepartments failed to:  \na.  offer adequate justification for the Rules; \nb.  tailor the Rules’ exemptions to apply only when necessary to alleviate a \nsubstantial burden on religious exercise; \nc.  consider the Rules’ deleterious effects on the health, economic security, \nequality, and autonomy of women and others who will lose coverage for contraception;  \nd.  respond to significant comments regarding the Rules’ detrimental effects on \naccess to contraception, and the resulting harm to women’s health, economic security, equality, \nand autonomy;  \ne.  consider the weight of the hundreds of thousands of comments that were \nsubmitted for each of the previous rules relating to the contraceptive coverage requirement, or the \npost-promulgation comments submitted following the Interim Final Rules; \nf.  provide any reasoned explanation—let alone the more detailed justification \nthat is legally required—for abandoning the Departments’ earlier, detailed, and highly persuasive \nfactual findings regarding the benefits of contraception to women’s health and equality; \ng.  provide any reasoned explanation—let alone the more detailed justification \nthat is legally required—for abandoning the Departments’ earlier, detailed, and highly persuasive \nfactual findings supporting their conclusion that the government has a compelling governmental \ninterest in ensuring that individuals receive coverage of contraception without cost-sharing. \n41 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 42 of 47\n \nh.  provide any reasoned explanation—let alone the more detailed justification \nthat is legally required—for abandoning their own long-standing position—advanced to this Court \nand  to  multiple  federal  courts  of  appeals—that  the  preexisting  accommodation  does  not \nsubstantially burden religious exercise; \ni.  provide any reasoned explanation—let alone the more detailed justification \nthat is legally required—for abandoning the Departments’ earlier determinations that no feasible \nalternatives are available and that the accommodation is the least restrictive means of furthering \nthe government’s compelling interest in the contraceptive coverage requirement; \nj.  consider the serious reliance interests of Plaintiffs and countless others on \nthe contraceptive coverage requirement and preexisting accommodation process; \nk.  conduct an adequate regulatory-impact analysis that considers, as it must, \nthe full scope of costs to the health, economic security, equality, and autonomy of women and \nothers who can become pregnant. \n183.  The Rules are therefore arbitrary and capricious because they lack a rational \nconnection to the problem identified, because the Departments failed to consider an important \naspect of the problem, and because the agency offered an explanation for its decision that runs \ncounter to the evidence before the agency.  \n184.  The Rules are also arbitrary and capricious because the Departments failed to \nprovide any reasoned explanation for their dramatic reversal of policy, let alone the more detailed \njustification required when, as here, there are serious reliance interests at stake and the Rules rest \nupon factual findings that contradict those which underlay the prior policy.   \n185.  By issuing illegal Rules, the Government Defendants abused their discretion in \nviolation of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n42 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 43 of 47\n \n186.  Because the Government Defendants’ actions are “not in accordance with law,” \n“contrary to constitutional right,” “arbitrary and capricious,” and “an abuse of discretion,” the \nGovernment Defendants have violated the Administrative Procedure Act. \n187.  Absent declaratory and injunctive relief, the Government Defendants’ violations \nwill cause ongoing harm to Plaintiffs. \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION—GOVERNMENT DEFENDANTS \n(First Amendment—Violation of the Establishment Clause) \n188.  The foregoing allegations are re-alleged and incorporated by reference as if restated \nfully here. \n189.  Plaintiffs are entitled to relief because the Settlement Agreement and the Rules \nsubject,  and  will  continue  to  subject,  Plaintiffs  to  deprivations  of  their  rights  under  the \nEstablishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.   \n190.  The Establishment Clause provides that “Congress shall make no law respecting an \nestablishment of religion.” \n191.  The Government Defendants have violated, and will continue to violate, Plaintiffs’ \nrights under the Establishment Clause, including in the following ways: \na.  The Settlement Agreement and the Rules are governmental conduct that \nhas and will continue to have the primary purpose and principal effect of promoting, advancing, \nand endorsing religion. \nb.  The Settlement Agreement and the Rules coercively impose religious \nbeliefs and practices to which Plaintiffs and other affected persons do not subscribe. \nc.  The  Settlement  Agreement  and  the  Rules  excessively  entangle  the \ngovernment with religion. \nd.  The  Settlement  Agreement  and  the  Rules  impermissibly  impose  on \n43 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 44 of 47\n \nPlaintiffs and other third parties undue costs, burdens, and harms arising from the granting of \nreligious exemptions from the ACA, including by depriving them of, or limiting their access to, \ncontraceptive services, a critical preventive health service, and by shifting to and imposing on \nthem costs to obtain contraceptives and contraceptive services that they otherwise would not have \nto pay out-of-pocket. \ne.  The Settlement Agreement and the Rules impermissibly favor and prefer \nsome denominations and religious beliefs over others. \n192.  Absent declaratory and injunctive relief, the Government Defendants’ violations \nwill cause ongoing harm to Plaintiffs. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court: \na.  Declare the Settlement Agreement between the Departments and Notre \nDame void because it violates the Administrative Procedure Act, orders and precedential decisions \nof federal courts, and the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution;  \nb.  Enter a permanent injunction prohibiting Notre Dame from implementing, \nenforcing, or relying on the Settlement Agreement or any provision thereof; \nc.  Enter  a  permanent  injunction  prohibiting  the  Departments  from \nimplementing, enforcing, or relying on the Settlement Agreement, or any provision thereof, with \nrespect to Notre Dame and any of the health plans that it sponsors; \nd.  Enjoin the Government Defendants from authorizing or permitting Notre \nDame to sponsor any student or employee health plan that fails to comply with operative laws and \nregulations; \ne.  Declare that the Final Rules were issued in violation of, and violate, the \n44 \n     \n   \n\nUSDC IN/ND case 3:18-cv-00491-PPS-JEM   document 102   filed 08/20/20   page 45 of 47\n \nAdministrative Procedure Act and the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; \nf.  Vacate and set aside the Final Rules; \ng.  Enter a permanent injunction prohibiting the Government Defendants from \nimplementing or enforcing the Final Rules; \nh.  Retain jurisdiction until Defendants have fully satisfied their court-ordered \nobligations; \ni.  Award nominal damages in the sum of $1.00; \nj.  Award Plaintiffs attorneys’ fees and costs, as provided by any applicable \nstatute or regulation or the inherent powers of the Court;  \nk.  Grant all further and additional relief that the Court may determine is just \nand proper. \n \nDated:  August 20, 2020  Respectfully submitted, \n_______/s/_____________ \nMichelle Banker (admitted pro hac vice) \nFatima Goss Graves* \nGretchen Borchelt (admitted pro hac vice) \nSunu Chandy (admitted pro hac vice) \nLauren Gorodetsky** \nNational Women’s Law Center \n11 Dupont Circle, NW, Suite 800 \nWashington, DC 20036 \nTelephone: (202) 588-5180 \nmbanker@nwlc.org \nfgraves@nwlc.org  \ngborchelt@nwlc.org \nschandy@nwlc.org \nlgorodetsky@nwlc.org \n \nRichard B.
