On December 27, 2018, the Chief Judge of this district filed a \"Temporary Administrative Order Relating to Civil Cases Involving the United States.\" See In Re Civil Proceedings Involving the United States During Federal Lapse in Appropriations, 18-MC-00004-55 and 18-MC-00035-02 (D.N.M.). This order imposed a temporary stay in \"all civil cases within the District of New Mexico wherein the United States or an agency, corporation, officer or employee, deemed or otherwise, of the United States is a party[.]\" Id. 3. The order also extended all deadlines in affected cases \"for a period of time commensurate with the duration of the lapse in appropriations, but in no case beyond January 16, 2019, absent further Order of the Court.\" Id. Consequently, because this civil case involves as a party the United States or an agency thereof, this case is TEMPORARILY STAYED pending further order of this Court. All current deadlines will be EXTENDED by the number of days that elapse between December 21, 2018 and the lifting of the temporary stay. So ordered. [THIS IS A TEXT-ONLY ENTRY.

    "summary": "<p dir=\"ltr\">This is a case about administration of child welfare. Plaintiffs were private citizens of New Mexico and non-profit organizations Disability Rights New Mexico and Native American Disability Law Center, bringing a class action complaint against Secretary for the Children, Youth, and Families Department (CYFD) Monique Jacobson and Secretary for the Human Services Department (HSD) Brent Earnest. The action was brought in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico on December 28, 2018. The action was brought under 29 U.S.C. &sect; 701 (Rehabilitation Act), 42 U.S.C. &sect; 12132 (ADA), 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1396 (Medicaid Act), and 25 U.S.C. &sect; 1915 (Indian Child Welfare Act). The complaint alleged denial of benefits and segregation in violation of the Rehabilitation Act, discrimination and segregation in violation of the ADA, violation of the plaintiffs&rsquo; Fourteenth Amendment Due Process rights, denial of services and promptness in violation of the Medicaid Act, and denial of least-restrictive setting placements in violation of the Indian Child Welfare Act. The case was assigned to Magistrate Judges Kirtan Khalsa and Laura Fashing, then reassigned to Chief District Judge William P. Johnson (ECF 36).</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the complaint, plaintiffs alleged they faced trauma related to domestic violence, sexual abuse, drug abuse, neglect, incarceration, and caregiver separation while in the custody of CYFD. Plaintiffs experienced mental health and behavioral issues as a result of their trauma. CYFD frequently moved plaintiffs to different foster care placements. CYFD did not provide timely or adequate mental and behavioral health services to address plaintiffs&rsquo; trauma, which they are entitled to under the Medicaid Act. The repeated transfers of children to new foster homes subjected plaintiffs to new traumas. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief requiring CYFD and HSD to provide reasonable accommodations including providing mandatory trauma-sensitivity training for all caregivers, staff, and youth attorneys, conducting trauma-informed screenings, actively monitoring the health and treatment of the children, ensuring the children are placed in the least-restrictive environments, acquiring tribe-affiliated or approved foster families, establishing and implementing statewide individualized services in the least restrictive environment, and ensuring CYFD and HSD have sufficient capacity to meet the needs of the children and fulfill their obligations under the law. Plaintiffs sought Declaratory relief that the defendants had violated the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Rehabilitation Act, the ADA, the Medicaid Act, and the Indian Child Welfare Act.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The plaintiffs sought to certify a class of children statewide who were in the custody of CYFD and had experienced or were at risk of experiencing trauma. The common questions of law and fact were whether defendants had a system in place to provide children who had experienced trauma with the most appropriate and least restrictive services and placements, whether defendants screen children in a timely and adequate manner for mental and behavioral health needs and these needs are being served, and whether defendants have violated the plaintiffs Due Process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Defendants filed an answer on April 10, 2019, denying the substantive allegations regarding the deficient treatment of children who had experienced trauma in the custody of CYFD and denying that plaintiffs were entitled to relief. The parties engaged in preliminary discovery disputes.</p>\r\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-732a3702-7fff-75c6-756e-777d97ccea96\"></span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On March 26, 2020, the parties entered a joint stipulation of dismissal due to a settlement agreement. The agreement was made to improve services and outcomes for Children in State Custody by developing practices and procedures to comply with the ICWA, ensure proper resources, training, and consistent procedures for providing care to Children in State Custody, and provide due process to the class. Plaintiff&rsquo;s claims were dismissed with prejudice.</p>\r\n<p>For the next several years, enforcement of the settlement continued. In 2022, the Co-Neutrals' report found that the state's child welfare system was \"in crisis.\" In 2023, the parties devised a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) to ensure that the settlement&rsquo;s original targets were met. The plan included a number of commitments, such as recruiting and retaining resource staff, bringing children placed out of state back to New Mexico, and data monitoring goals. The plan was set to expire in January 2024.</p>\r\n<p>In September 2023, the Co-Neutrals released a report finding that the state child welfare system had gotten worse since the previous year. The main issues they identified were staffing shortages, poor working conditions, and caseload backlogs. They recommended that the state immediately hire more staff to address this emergency. Four months later, on January 26, the Co-Neutrals sent the parties a letter indicating that they had conducted another inspection and found there had \"been little to no progress\" in fixing the problems they had previously identified. The following month, on February 23, the Co-Neutrals evaluated the state's compliance with the 2023 CAP and found the goals of the CAP had not been met \"in a meaningful way.\"</p>\r\n<p>The following year, on July 15, the plaintiffs filed for arbitration under the original settlement agreement, alleging that the state had failed to meet its commitments under the CAP. The plaintiffs asked the arbitrator to order specific performance to enforce the CAP.</p>\r\n<p>In January 2025, the arbitrator, attorney Charles Pfeiffer, determined that the State had failed to comply with several of the CAP commitments. These shortcomings included targets related to CYFD workforce caseloads, resource family recruitment, well-child checks and data submissions. As a result, the arbitrator mandated that the defendants take immediate corrective actions to address these failings. The decision included deadlines throughout early 2025 for the defendants to provide deliverables to ensure settlement targets are met.</p>\r\n<p>As of April 5, 2025, enforcement appears to be ongoing.</p>",

Plaintiffs sought a class certification of foster children in New Mexico. Defendants denied the substantive allegations.

HSD denies it has any \nobligation to “establish and maintain a system of care that anticipates and is capable of meeting \nthe needs” of children who have experienced abuse, abandonment and neglect as alleged in \nsentence 4.  CYFD denies Plaintiff’s characterizations of its obligations as incomplete.

Upon information and belief, Kevin S. was returned to the physical custody \nof his mother in April 2014 for a home trial visit until September 2014 when his mother regained \nfull custody.  CYFD admits that in 2016, Kevin S.’s mother requested that he be placed back in \nCYFD custody. CYFD is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the \ntruth of the remaining allegations contained in Paragraph 16, and therefore, deny the same. HSD \nhas no authority in the child welfare system and is without information sufficient to form a belief \nas to the truth of the allegations in Paragraph 16, and therefore, denies the same. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 45   Filed 04/10/19   Page 8 of 64\n17.  Defendants admit the allegations in Paragraph 17 of the Complaint.  \n18.  CYFD admits the allegations in Paragraph 18 of the Complaint. HSD has no \nauthority in the child welfare system administered by CYFD and is without information sufficient \nto form a belief as to the truth of the allegations in Paragraph 18, and therefore, denies the same.  \n19.  CYFD admits the allegations in Paragraph 19 of the Complaint. HSD has no \nauthority in the child welfare system administered by CYFD and is without information sufficient \nto form a belief as to the truth of the allegations in Paragraph 19, and therefore, denies the same.  \n20.  Upon information and belief, CYFD states that Kevin S. was returned to the \nphysical custody of his mother in April 2014 for a home trial visit until September 2014, when his \nmother fully regained custody.  CYFD admits that Kevin S.’s mother was unable to manage his \nbehavior and that, upon information and belief, shortly after she regained custody, she sent him to \na residential treatment center in Texas from about October 2014 to about March 2016.  CYFD \nadmits that Kevin S. was returned to CYFD custody in 2016. CYFD denies that Kevin S. has \nreceived inadequate mental and behavioral health services, or any other inadequate services or \ntreatment, at any time while in CYFD custody and that any escalating behavior of Kevin S. was \nattributable  to  any  such  inadequacy.  With  respect  to  the  allegations  regarding  inadequate \ncounseling with Kevin S.’s mother, CYFD denies these allegations and states that the mother’s \nattendance at family therapy sessions and at her individual therapy sessions was unreliable. At one \npoint, after it was recommended by Kevin S.’s therapist, visits with his mother were even \ntemporarily suspended for a couple of months because her inconsistent attendance disappointed \nKevin S. and resulted in negative reactions. Additionally, after Kevin S.’s mother requested that \nhe be returned to CYFD custody in 2016, she made it clear that she had no interest in seeing Kevin \nS. and ceased contact with CYFD for a period of time. Despite CYFD’s repeated efforts, family \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 45   Filed 04/10/19   Page 9 of 64\ntherapy with her could not be arranged. Any inadequacy in counseling with Kevin S.’s mother has \nbeen due to her inconsistency and unavailability. To the extent the allegations are not expressly \nadmitted, CYFD denies the remaining allegations in Paragraph 20 of the Complaint. HSD has no \nauthority in the child welfare system and is without information sufficient to form a belief as to \nthe truth of the allegations in Paragraph 20 of the Complaint, and therefore, denies the same.   \n21.  CYFD admits that Kevin S. was placed in an emergency shelter for youth ages \nsixteen to twenty-one for approximately a week, Casa Hermosa with Youth Development Institute \n(“YDI”).  This occurred when Kevin S.’s mother relinquished custody of him and he had nowhere \nto go. That emergency shelter was the only place that agreed to take Kevin S. After Kevin S. \nassaulted some of the other youth there, ran away, and refused to return, the shelter requested that \nhe be removed.  Kevin S. then went to Amistad, another YDI youth shelter. He was there for one \nnight when he punched, bit, and kicked a staff member and was kicked out of the shelter.  CYFD \nstates that it desperately tried to secure placement for Kevin S., but due to his aggressive behavior, \nhe was rejected from all New Mexico facilities.  When the residential treatment center in Colorado \naccepted Kevin S., CYFD worked to ensure Kevin S.’s placement as quickly as possible, but it \ntook a couple of days for insurance to go through, for final approval to be obtained, and for \ntransportation to be arranged.  In the meantime, no alternative placement could be found.  As a \nresult, CYFD admits that Kevin S. did spend two nights at the CYFD office and he did run away.  \nKevin S. was then sent to the RTC in Colorado. CYFD admits that there were some incident \nreports, mostly for Kevin S.’s aggressive behavior.  Upon information and belief, Kevin S. was \nonly restrained when it was necessary to prevent him from harming others or himself. Kevin S. \ndid stay at the Colorado facility for about a year. Upon his release, CYFD states that it tried to \nsecure placement for him at a New Mexico facility, but received only denials.  CYFD admits that \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 45   Filed 04/10/19   Page 10 of 64\nKevin S. was accepted to and went to an out of state residential treatment center in Utah. CYFD \nadmits that Kevin S. arrived at the Utah facility in September of 2017 and that he was moved \nbetween three facilities within the center due to behavioral issues including elopement and sexual \nmisconduct with other residents. CYFD is unsure of Plaintiffs’ definition of “placements” and so \nis without sufficient information to form a belief as to the truth of the allegations regarding the \nnumber of Kevin S.’s placements, and therefore, denies the same.

New Mexico) \n_______________________________ \n \nCORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN \nFOR PARTIAL RESOLUTION OF ISSUES IN DISPUTE \n \nBy and Between \nKevin S., et al., Plaintiffs, and the New Mexico Children, Youth and Families Department \n(CYFD) and New Mexico Human Services Department (HSD), Defendants \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n \n*  *  *  *  * \n \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nIn the spirit of collaboration, counsel for Plaintiffs, CYFD and HSD (individually as “Party” and \ncollectively as the “Parties”), employed good-faith, best efforts to discuss and resolve disputes in \nfurtherance of Step 1 of the Dispute Resolution process set forth in Section IX.A of the March \n2020 Final Settlement Agreement (“Agreement”). The purpose of this Corrective Action Plan \n(“CAP”) is to partially resolve the areas of dispute as set forth in Plaintiffs’ initiation of the dispute \nresolution process dated January 6, 2023 and attached as Exhibit A. This Corrective Action Plan \nsets forth the commitments that CYFD and HSD agree to undertake to come into compliance with \nthe Agreement between the Parties and to ensure that children currently in state custody are able \nto benefit from the State’s commitments as outlined in the Agreement.  \nMediation conducted by the Co-Neutrals was held on March 28-29, 2023, April 14, 2023, and May \n5, 2023. In addition, the Parties participated in a facilitated listening session with Nations, Pueblos \nand Tribes located in New Mexico on May 10, 2023 and attended a mediation conducted by the \nCo-Neutrals on May 12, 2023.  The Parties held additional mediation sessions on May 24, 2023 \nand June 9, 2023.   \nAs used in this CAP, the term “State” refers to CYFD and HSD.  \nNothing in this CAP shall be construed to modify the obligations in the Agreement, including but \nnot limited to timelines for monitoring and reporting and meeting the Performance Standard as set \nforth in the Agreement. The CAP identifies and describes the strategies that the Parties agree are \nnecessary to implement the Agreement. As determined appropriate by the Co-Neutrals, the CAP \ncommitments may be referenced in the Co-Neutrals’ Annual Report. The Parties have jointly \nagreed that the commitments outlined in the CAP are necessary and will be undertaken in the time \nset forth in the CAP to improve the State’s ability to comply with its commitments. The Parties \nagree that this CAP shall expire on January 5, 2024.  \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n1 \n\nThis CAP resolves only the identified issues in dispute specifically resolved in the CAP up to the \ndate of execution of this CAP. Plaintiffs will not arbitrate the remaining issues in the 2021 report \nuntil the CAP expires. For any commitment set forth in the CAP that the State fails to meet, the \nParties agree that Plaintiffs may proceed to arbitration without initiating Step 1 of the Dispute \nResolution process set forth in the Agreement.  \nFor all remaining issues that have not be resolved in the CAP, the Parties agree that Plaintiffs have \nexhausted their obligations under Step 1 of the Dispute Resolution process set forth in the \nAgreement and may proceed to arbitration. Nothing in this CAP shall be construed as a waiver of \nPlaintiffs’ right to arbitrate any and all remaining unresolved issues and to secure any and all relief \nand remedies provided by the Agreement.  \nFor each commitment, the CAP identifies the issue(s) in dispute that is resolved by agreement \nbetween the Parties.  \n \n*  *  *  *  * \n \n1.   CYFD Workforce Caseload  \nThe Parties agree that the following commitments will be implemented to improve compliance \nwith Appendix B, Target Outcome 10. While the State’s performance with respect to this target is \nno longer in dispute, this target will still be reported and monitored as required under the original \nterms of the Agreement and CYFD is obligated to meet the agreed upon Performance Standard as \nto this target as set forth in the Agreement. The commitments below are to be implemented in \naddition to the activities set forth in the Agreement Appendix B, Target Outcome 10. \n \nThe Parties agree that there is an urgent need to recruit and retain case workers and to come into \ncompliance with the caseload standard required by the Agreement. CYFD will work closely and \ncooperatively with the Co-Neutrals to ensure progress towards meeting caseload standards and \nwill take the actions described below.   \na.  By December 31, 2023, no Investigation Case, Permanency Planning, In-Home Services, \nor Placement worker will have over 200% of the applicable caseload standards \ndocumented in the 2023 Data Validation Plan approved by the Co-Neutrals , including \ntrainees with graduated caseloads. \n \nb.  By December 31, 2023, no supervisor will be carrying any cases. \n \nc.  Monthly data reports with data elements agreed to by the Co-Neutrals will be made \navailable to Co-Neutrals, which the Co-Neutrals may validate. \n \nCYFD is exploring reporting this data in a monthly dashboard format. Until a dashboard is created, \nthe data will be reported in a format matching or similar to existing reports which are currently \nbeing submitted to the Co-Neutrals and Plaintiffs pursuant to the MOU. \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n2 \n\n \n2.  Building out family-based placements \nThe Parties agree that the following commitments will be implemented to improve compliance \nwith Appendix B, Target Outcome 6. While the State’s performance with respect to this target is \nno longer in dispute, this target will still be reported and monitored as required under the original \nterms of the Agreement, and CYFD and HSD are obligated to meet the agreed upon Performance \nStandard as to this target as set forth in the Agreement. The commitments below are to be \nimplemented in addition to the activities set forth in Appendix B, Target Outcome 6 of the \nAgreement. \nCYFD will commit to public/private strategy to recruit and retain resource families. \nIn five high-needs counties (Bernalillo, Dona Ana, Santa Fe, San Juan, and Chavez/Eddy), CYFD \nwill immediately assign one placement staff to focus exclusively on recruitment until at least \nSeptember 30, 2023. The State will maintain its dedicated public staff in the 5 designated counties \nat least until the private contractor has fully ramped up its capacity in those 5 designated counties.   \nIn addition to the assignment of placement staff to focus on the five counties listed above, CYFD \nwill enter into contracts with at least one private provider for resource family recruitment by \nSeptember 30, 2023 to focus on foster home recruitment and retention with specific capacity \nfocused on growing new foster homes in each county throughout the State. The contract will \nprovide that the private entities will recruit families and support them through the licensing \nprocess.  \nCYFD will retain exclusive responsibility for assessment, licensure and supervision of all foster \nhomes,  regardless  of  whether  the  home  is  recruited  publicly  or  privately.  CYFD  regional \nplacement staff will be responsible for supervising private entities. \nBy June 30, 2023, the State will have county-specific recruitment plans for each county in the State \nthat address the needs, strategies, and targets for resource homes. Said recruitment plans will \ninclude demographics of the children and youth in state custody (Children in State Custody, \nhereafter “CISC”), including: (1) the foster youths’ age, race and ethnicity; (2) the resource \nfamilies’ age, race, ethnicity, and geographic information; (3) the bed capacity of current resource \nfamilies; and (4) the numbers of families based on type of placement (non-kin; kin; and respite).  \nBy August 1, 2023, CYFD will develop additional capacity to assess the different levels of foster \ncare payment based on child needs by county to assist with county-specific foster care recruitment \nplanning.  These plans will be provided to the Co-Neutrals by June 30, 2023, and the State will \nmeet with the Co-Neutrals to discuss any feedback.  \nCYFD will maintain on its webpage data on monthly gain/loss of resource homes. CYFD’s web \nlink will be made publicly available.  \nCYFD will provide Co-Neutrals with quarterly statewide data on gain/loss of non-relative licensed \nresource homes. Details of these data, including quarterly date ranges and submission deadlines, \nwill be agreed upon by the Co-Neutrals and the State.  \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n3 \n\n \nCYFD will collect and assess the data by county and will provide data by county to the Co-Neutrals \nas set forth below in Section 5. \nThe Parties agree that care coordinators from managed care organizations (MCOs) need to take a \ngreater role in coordinating Treatment Foster Care (TFC) placements for children in state custody \nthat are enrolled in an MCO. When a child is recommended for TFC, including but not limited to \na recommendation from a mental health provider or a request from IPP team, CYFD will submit \nthe information to the MCO to confirm medical necessity by a prior authorization.   \nOnce the TFC recommendation has been referred to the MCO by CYFD and prior authorization \nand medical necessity has been confirmed, the care coordinator assigned to the child will have the \nresponsibility of coordinating and obtaining TFC services. The  MCO care coordinator will \ndocument  such  activity  appropriately  in  the  child’s  file  kept  by  the  MCO  pursuant  to  the \nobligations as outlined in Section 4.4 of the Medicaid Managed Care Organization Service \nAgreement. See also LOD 69-1, describing new obligations under section 4.12.15.  \nFor children who are Fee for Service (FFS), CYFD will submit the referral packet to the Third \nParty Assessor (TPA). CYFD and HSD will then work with the IPP Team to find a TFC placement. \nIf the TFC recommendation is reduced, denied, modified, delayed or not approved by the MCO or \nTPA, Notice of Action and grievance protocols will be provided to the child’s caregiver, legal \nrepresentative, and legal custodian. Any Notice of Action received by CYFD will be provided to \nthe child’s Nation, Pueblo or Tribe if applicable. Any denial, reduction, modification, delay of a \nrecommendation for treatment foster care, including for prior authorization requests, will be \nreviewed by the Medical Director at the MCO or TPA, and a copy of the Medical Director’s \ndecision to be sent to the Cabinet Secretary of HSD and the Cabinet Secretary of CYFD. If TFC \nservices are not authorized by the MCO, HSD and/or CYFD, including through state general funds \nor single case agreements, the State will immediately (within 5 days) identify alternative services. \nTo address the needs of the child in state custody during the period of appeal, the child will be \nplaced in the most appropriate and least restrictive placement as identified by the IPP Team, and \nthe team may consider single case agreements as needed for community-based placement.  \nThe Parties agree that the determination (approval/denial/modification/reduction/delay) will be \ntracked by CYFD and HSD and that the time (number of days) between approval and treatment \nfoster care services beginning will be tracked. Details of these data will be tracked as follows: \nAggregate and child-specific level data for the following on a quarterly basis (data will include \nthe case and person ID, date of birth, date of request/activity or disposition decision and notice \nprovided) will be provided to the Co-Neutrals:  \n \n1.  Referrals/requests for prior authorization of TFC by CYFD to MCO  \n2.  Disposition of TFC requests for prior authorization by MCO (to include approvals, \nmodifications, denials) \n3.  For all approvals or modifications, dates and identification of provider for the following:  \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n4 \n\na.  Referral made by MCO to TFC agency (for each TFC provider the referral was \nsubmitted and corresponding dates for each referral) \nb.  Decision provided by TFC agency to MCO (for each TFC provider providing the \ndecision and corresponding dates for each decision) \nc.  For any acceptances from TFC agency, date the acceptance was received, and date \nthat service began  \nd.  For any modifications or denials from TFC agency, reason for denial and any requests \nfor supportive services that would allow for acceptance  \n4.  Requests for re-authorization of TFC to MCO  \n5.  Disposition of TFC reauthorization requests by MCO (to include approvals, modifications, \ndenials) \n6.  For all children referred by CYFD to MCO for TFC, aggregate data on the number of days \nbetween the request by CYFD for TFC prior authorization, approval by MCO, and TFC \nbeing provided to the child.  \n \nFor FFS, CYFD and HSD will track the activities above.  \n3.  Bringing children placed out of state back to New Mexico  \nThe Parties agree that the following commitments will be implemented to improve compliance \nwith Appendix B, Target Outcome 2. While the State’s performance with this target is no longer \nin dispute, this target will still be reported and monitored as required under the original terms of \nthe Agreement and CYFD and HSD are obligated to meet the agreed upon Performance Standard \nas to this target as set forth in the Agreement. The commitments below are to be implemented in \naddition to the activities set forth in the Agreement for Appendix B, Target Outcome 2.  \n \nThe Parties agree that immediate efforts must be made to end all out-of-state placements unless in \nextraordinary circumstances necessary to protect the safety and security of the child as documented \nin the child’s record and as approved by the Secretary of CYFD and the Secretary of HSD and to \ncontinued efforts to bring children who are currently placed in out-of-state congregate care back \nto  New  Mexico  with  appropriate  services.  The  State  will  immediately  launch  a  six-month \nspecialized review team (“Team”), with authority to authorize single case agreements if necessary \nto provide services and supports to children with complex needs in New Mexico. Notwithstanding \nthe January 5, 2024 expiration date of this CAP, the State agrees to continue the specialized review \nteam for six months from the date of this CAP. \n \nThe following participants will be members of the Team: Dr. George Davis, CYFD’s Optimal \nPlacement Coordinator who will have authority to authorize single case agreements, the CYFD \nCommunity Behavioral Health Clinician (CBHC), and the MCO Medical/BH Director for each \nrelevant child. The Team has authority to bring in other people with relevant knowledge about the \nchild; the child’s disability; and the services and supports that will enable the child to be returned \nto New Mexico [i.e.: DD Waiver professionals, Guardian Ad Litem/Youth Attorney, long term \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n5 \n\n \nproviders, representatives from the child’s Nation, Pueblo or Tribe]. Any engagement with those \noutside of State Agencies would require confidentiality agreements and specific parameters to \nguard the protected health information and other specific case details, as applicable, to be reviewed \nand approved by State authorities.   \n \nThe Team will meet as frequently as needed to develop a plan to bring nine currently identified \nchildren back to New Mexico and into a safe, least restrictive and appropriate setting. These nine \nchildren have been identified because they do not have a current discharge plan. If the discharge \nplans for any of the other children in state custody who are currently out of state but not part of the \nidentified nine children cannot be implemented, these children will also be reviewed by the Team. \nFor all children currently out of state, when the children return to New Mexico, their placement \nand services will be monitored by the Team every 30, 60, and 90 days pursuant to CYFD’s current \nIPP process. \n \nAt the end of the six-month pilot, the Team will analyze the effectiveness of its actions towards \nbringing children back to New Mexico successfully under single case agreements and identify \npractices and services that will be useful for avoiding out-of-state placements for CISC in the \nfuture. The findings of the Team will be shared with the Co-Neutrals and the Plaintiffs. \n \nThe State has agreed to pay Dr. George Davis at the rate of $200 an hour, with the express \nunderstanding that this rate is only for the purposes of participating in the pilot team. As a Team \nparticipant, Dr. Davis will be provided with confidential information solely for the purposes of \nidentifying the treatment and service needs of the children being reviewed by the Team.  Personal \nidentifying information regarding specific children will not be shared with the Plaintiffs’ counsel \nby Dr. Davis. However, Plaintiffs’ counsel retain all the rights to access confidential information \nas set forth in the Agreement and the Protective Order filed in this matter.  \n \nIn addition to the Team – and in order to stop sending children in state custody out of state in \nviolation of the Agreement – both the CYFD Secretary and the HSD Secretary must approve any \nout-of-state placement before placement is made.  \n \nIn addition, in order to serve more CISC in home-based settings, HSD agrees to double the \nCapacity of High-Fidelity Wraparound (HFW) Services in Medicaid by January 1, 2024. \n \nHSD and CYFD will work together to meet the goal of doubling the capacity of the newly- \napproved HFW benefit in Medicaid by the end of 2023 by committing to the following:  \n  HSD and CYFD will double the number of HFW sites from 10 to 20. \n \n  HSD and CYFD will double the number of HFW facilitators from 26 to 52. It takes six \nmonths to train HFW facilitators. HSD and CYFD will have 26 additional facilitators in \nthe training pipeline by January 1, with credentialing expected in the first quarter of 2024. \n \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n6 \n\nOn October 1, 2023, HSD and CYFD will provide the Co-Neutrals and the Plaintiffs with: 1) \nfacilitator training tracking logs to reflect HFW facilitators in training, and 2) a Medicaid provider \nenrollment report to reflect the number of enrolled HFW providers, with a final report to be \nprovided on January 15, 2024 reflecting the status as of January 1, 2024.  \n4.  Critical Incident Review (CIR) \nThe Parties agree that the following commitments will be implemented to improve compliance \nwith Appendix B, Target Outcomes 2, 3, and 4. While the State’s performance with these targets \nare no longer in dispute, these targets will still be reported and monitored as required under the \noriginal terms of the Agreement and CYFD and HSD are obligated to meet the agreed upon \nPerformance Standard as to each target as set forth in the Agreement. The commitments below are \nto be implemented in addition to the activities set forth in the Agreement for Appendix B, Target \nOutcomes 2, 3, and 4.  \n \nThe Parties agree that any determination of medical necessity and the child’s best interest must \ntake into account the safety of the child and whether the placement is the least restrictive placement \navailable for the child. In addition, the Parties seek to ensure that there is diligent and careful \noversight to ensure the safety of all children in state custody placed in offices, motels, and \ncongregate care settings.  \n \nCYFD will provide the Co-Neutrals with written notice via email within one (1) business day of \nnotification to the department of any critical incident regarding a child placed in hotels, motels, \noffices, out-of-state, in shelters, or in congregate care in New Mexico. Along with the notice of \ncritical incident(s), the State will provide a safety plan for the child, describing services and \nsupports that will be provided as necessary to address the harm of the critical incident and steps \nthat will be taken to protect the child from such harm in the immediate future. Children placed in \noffices for under 23 hours will be included in the critical incident reviews.  \nCritical incidents regarding a child placed in hotels, motels, offices, out-of-state, in shelters, or in \ncongregate care in New Mexico include:  \n●  Any 911 call \n●  Any allegations of harm \n●  Any allegations of abuse and/or neglect  \n●  Any allegation of restraint/seclusion, and  \n●  Any change in licensure within any facility in which a child in State custody is \nplaced \nThe Co-Neutral team shall continue to have immediate access to the State’s data systems and all \nrecords therein regarding the child who is subject to a critical incident pursuant to the Agreement. \nThe Co-Neutral team will be provided with any documents requested related to the placement, \nincluding emails related to staffing and oversight of placement decisions. The State shall respond \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n7 \n\nin writing within two (2) business days to the Co-Neutrals’ request for information corresponding \nto an identified critical incident.  \nThe Co-Neutrals will provide information quarterly to Plaintiffs which will at minimum detail \nnumbers of CIR by type. The CIRs will also be addressed in the Co-Neutral Annual Report.  \n \n5.  Data Needed to Monitor Progress | Real Time Data \nThe Parties agree that the following commitments will be implemented to improve compliance \nwith the Appendix B Targets above (BTO 2, 3, 4, 6, and 10). While the State’s performance with \nrespect to these targets are no longer in dispute, this target will still be reported and monitored as \nrequired under the original terms of the Agreement and CYFD and HSD are obligated to meet the \nagreed  upon  Performance  Standard  as  to  this  target  as  set  forth  in  the  Agreement.  The \ncommitments below are to be implemented in addition to the activities set forth in the Agreement \nfor Appendix B, Target Outcomes 2, 3, 4, 6, and 10. \n \nThe Parties agree that it is imperative for the State and the Co-Neutrals to have access to real time \ndata to assist the State in meeting the obligations in the Agreement and that the failure to have \naccess to real time data has already delayed needed progress on many deliverables.   \n \nIn order to more effectively monitor the State’s progress, CYFD and HSD agree to provide real \ntime data as follows:  \n \n●  All data, including real time data, that is being provided pursuant to the MOU dated \nJune 10, 2022 and fully executed on June 15, 2022 (2022 MOU) will continue to \nbe provided.  \n●  In addition, the State will include monthly submissions to the Co-Neutrals on new \nin-state  congregate  care  placements,  including  crisis  stabilization,  clinical \ncongregate care placements, and non-clinical congregate care placements.  \n●  The State will provide medical necessity determination information for new in-state \nand out-of-state clinical congregate care placements.  \n●  The State will finalize data elements necessary to track progress on foster care \nrecruitment and retention with the Co-Neutrals. The data elements will include \nquarterly statewide data on gain/loss of non-relative licensed resource homes and \ndata by county.  \n●  In addition to the data regarding treatment foster care to be provided to the Co-\nNeutrals above in Section 2, the State will provide to Co-Neutrals quarterly data on \nthe total number of treatment foster care homes.  \n●  On a quarterly basis, with one-quarter delay, the State will provide child entry \ncohort data (children who entered as children in state custody in the prior quarter) \nto the Co-Neutrals.  Beginning on July 1, 2023, the State will provide child entry \ncohort data between January 1, 2023 and March 31, 2023.  These quarterly reports \nwill be provided through January 1, 2024.   \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n8 \n\n \n \n \n6.  Pilots \nPILOTS FOR COORDINATED ACTION WITHIN LOCAL COMMUNITIES \nThe Parties agree the following commitments will be implemented to improve compliance with \nAppendix A, Target Outcome 1, and Appendix B, Target Outcomes 2, 3, 4, 6 and 1. While the \nState’s performance with respect to these targets are no longer in dispute, these targets will still be \nreported and monitored as required under the original terms of the Agreement and CYFD and HSD \nare obligated to meet the agreed upon Performance Standard as to each target as set forth in the \nAgreement. The commitments below are to be implemented in addition to the activities set forth \nin the Agreement for these targets.  \nThe pilot for coordinated action within local communities reflects the Parties agreement that \ncompliance with the Agreement will require CYFD and HSD to partner at a county office level \nand to partner with community stakeholders.  \nPURPOSE: A meaningful, solution-focused collaboration between CYFD, HSD, including their \nrespective Behavioral Health Services and Behavioral Health Services Divisions, and the local \nchild-welfare  community  to  look  at  current  practice,  identify  strengths  and  challenges  to \nimplementing an integrated system of care that meets the individualized needs of children and their \nfamilies involved with protective service in their community as guided under the commitments the \nState has made to strengthen its workforce and to provide a trauma-responsive system of care, \nstrengthen and  expand  its behavioral health services, comply  with  ICWA and pursue least \nrestrictive and appropriate placements. Emphasis will be placed on operationalizing all reasonable \nrecommendations and creative solutions brought forward and on building out the availability of \nany appropriate and needed services, including behavioral and mental health identified in the \nAgreement, in these communities. \nDESIRED OUTCOME: To provide concrete, community-specific recommendations on how to \naddress  identified  challenges  and  barriers  realistically  and  effectively  to  ensure  successful \nimplementation of a culturally supportive, trauma-responsive, and identity-affirming system of \ncare for children/youth in CYFD’s custody, to fill in any existing service gaps, and further develop \nservices, including behavioral and mental health services identified in the Agreement, in the \nidentified local communities.   \nAny proposed recommendations shall be reasonable and final decisions around implementing \nrecommendations regarding CYFD’s policy, procedures, practices, and procurement is the sole \nresponsibility and authority of the CYFD Cabinet Secretary and Director of Protective Services \nand the HSD Cabinet Secretary. Should a recommendation be deemed unreasonable or impossible, \nthe State will provide feedback to the facilitator for discussion at future meetings to identify ways \nto problem solve around such barriers where and when appropriate. Furthermore, the State will \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n9 \n\nmake efforts to implement the reasonable recommendations through various means (e.g., financial \nor technical assistance) to others such as non-profits or providers if direct implementation by the \nState is not possible. \nWHAT THIS IS NOT: An opportunity to blame or shame anyone at the table or expect that \nCYFD can implement all recommendations alone. Additionally, this team does not have the \nauthority to generate or create policies or procedures for CYFD, local providers, etc., or procure \nfunding or contracts.  \nFACILITATION and FREQUENCY: Monthly meeting, with offline assignments. Meetings \nwill be facilitated by a neutral third party agreed to by the Parties and contracted by CYFD. \nTIMEFRAME: Notwithstanding the January 5, 2024 expiration of this CAP, the State agrees to \nconvene the pilots for coordinated action within local communities from August 1, 2023 through \nApril 30, 2024.  \nCYFD will contract with a third-party to facilitate meetings and coordinate communication for \ntwo teams. The teams will be established in San Juan and Dona Ana counties. Each team will \nselect its own Co-Chairs, determine cadence of data requests and needs, written plans to guide \ntheir work, and requested frequency of updates on implementation of recommended strategies. \nThe facilitator and Co-Chairs are responsible for the final report on or before May 31, 2024.   \nThe teams are tasked with reviewing local and statewide data related to the child welfare system \nand developing innovative, realistic solutions that are responsive to on-the-ground realities. Each \nteam will document its efforts so that their plans and reports can be shared with county offices \naround the state. The primary focus of the teams is to address foundational components necessary \nto keep children and youth in safe and family-based settings in their local communities, and to be \ninclusive of tribal collaboration and youth-voices and choices around appropriate placements. \nThe  Plaintiffs’  counsel  and  the  State  will  work  together  to  identify  team  participants  and \nfacilitators before July 14, 2023. Each team will include the following, but participation will not \nbe mandated for those not employed or contracted by CYFD, HSD, or the Plaintiffs’ team:  \n●  A contracted facilitator (may not be a current State employee); \n●  Child Welfare Group Trained IPP champion; \n●  CYFD County Office Manager (COM) for local community; \n●  CYFD Regional Office Manager (ROM) for the area;  \n●  CYFD Office of Tribal Affairs representative; \n●  CYFD Behavioral Health Services representative(s) in the local community;  \n●  HSD representative familiar with the local community, including Behavioral/Medical \nHealth and MAD; \n●  MCO behavioral health and medical representatives; \n●  MCO care coordinators from MCOs serving the community; \n \nKevin S. v.

Barring any conflict of interest, a \nrepresentative from the Pilot Team will be selected to serve on the selection committee \nif CYFD issues a Request for Proposals (“RFP”) or Request for Application (“RFA”) for \nrecruitment services and efforts. \nb.  Pilot Teams will make recommendation around staff recruitment and retention \nstrategies aimed at ensuring that reasonable caseload standards are achieved and \nmaintained. \n●  Based on review of local CYFD positions, broken out by type; identification \nof all vacant positions by type; and local monthly caseload data by type of \nposition, the pilot teams will make recommendations for local recruitment \nand retention strategies to meet local vacancy and caseload needs. \n●  The COM, in collaboration with CYFD leadership, will be responsible for \nimplementing all reasonable strategies to recruit case workers and to manage \ncaseloads and must provide feedback on efforts and ongoing barriers at pilot \nteam meetings. \n2.  Recommendations on how to build upon, strengthen, or expand access to timely and \nappropriate  trauma-responsive  behavioral  and  medical  health  services  in  the  local \ncommunity. At the start of each pilot CYFD and/or HSD will provide the teams with the \ninformation needed (including information on continuum of services for families and/or \nchildren) to ensure the desired outcomes of the pilot programs can be addressed, and to \nensure the purpose and scope of the pilot team and any components thereof are understood. \n●  Based on a review of local CAT and CANs aggregate data regarding the \ntimeliness with which said screens are completed and shared as required, and \nassessment/service delays or gaps as available, the teams will recommend \nreasonable  strategies  to  improve  timely  provision  and  proper  sharing  of \nscreens, if necessary.  \n●  Pilot teams will make recommendations, if needed, on how to better ensure \nindividualized planning meetings (IPMs) are occurring timely, are meaningful to \nparticipants, and how to improve the process, if needed.  \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n12 \n\n●  Pilot  teams  will  make  recommendations,  if  needed,  to  improve  care \ncoordination.    Based  on  review  of  local  real-time  data  regarding  care \ncoordination, including percentage of required CATs/CANS provided to care \ncoordinators by CYFD, percentage of IPMs that include care coordinators \nparticipation, percentage of children who have had EPSDT well-child checks \nwithin  30  days  of  coming  into  care,  and  whether  services  identified  by \nCAT/CANS/EPSDT, IPM teams have been provided within 10 days, pilot \nteams  will  recommend  strategies  to  improve  care  coordination  capacity. \nParticular emphasis will be placed on identifying and expanding the services \nwhich  are  necessary  to  address  the  needs  of  the  local  community  as \ndemonstrated in assessments.  \n●  Pilot Teams will make recommendations, if needed, for improving access to \nlocal  culturally  relevant  services,  supports,  and  placements  for  Native \nAmerican children/youth, African American children/youth, and other cultural \nidentities  served  within  the  child  welfare  system,  as  well  as  LBGTQ+ \nidentities, disability identities, immigration status, and other intersectional \nidentities. \no  The Tribal representative, if they are able to participate, and/or the \nCYFD  Office  of  Tribal  Affairs  representative  will  be  invited  to \nidentify  challenges  or  successes  in  local  ICWA/IFPA  cases  for \nconsideration by the pilot team, including a review of local data \nregarding Native children in CYFD custody; the percentage of children \nin preferred placements; a review of the quality of OOPP meetings, \nand make recommendations to improve ICWA/IFPA compliance and \nstrengthen tribal collaboration. Individual child and Nation, Tribe or \nPueblo specific information will not be shared. \n●  The teams will identify strategies, if needed, to strengthen or expand trauma-\nresponsive behavioral health services. Based on review of county data and \ncommunity discussion, each pilot teams will make recommendations on how \nto feasibly expand intensive home-based services needed in the community \nincluding but not limited to: High Fidelity Wraparound, Mobile Response \nStabilization Services, and Therapeutic Foster Care. \n●  HSD and CYFD will identify specific persons to actively seek to expand \nservices identified by the pilot teams, including working with MCOs and the \nlocal behavioral health collaborative serving the pilot sites. These individuals \nwill provide a report on progress and barriers to the pilot teams.  \n \nA continuum of interventions is not stagnant and could include the following based on the \nappropriate assessments, need of the child and the culture of the community at a given time.  \nServices that may be considered by the pilot teams are:  \n \nKevin S. v.

Additionally, for approved recommendations, the identified person(s) will also \nmonitor progress on implementation of strategies.  \n \nHSD and CYFD will provide the Co-Neutrals and Plaintiffs the work plan and any reports \ndeveloped by the Pilot Teams and progress made towards approved recommended strategies for \nimplementation on a quarterly basis. Materials developed by the pilot teams will be made public \nand shared with COMs in other counties to provide for cross-system learning. \n \nCYFD and HSD shall, in accordance with the Performance Standard in the Agreement will make \nall reasonable efforts to implement recommendations that will improve outcomes for children as \ncontemplated in the Agreement.   \n \nII. APPENDIX C TERMS   \nCYFD and Plaintiffs have reached the following agreements on Appendix C. Plaintiffs were \nunable to reach agreement with HSD regarding any Appendix C terms. \nCYFD and the Plaintiffs agree the following commitments will be implemented to improve \ncompliance with Appendix C. While CYFD's performance under Appendix C is no longer in \ndispute, the Appendix will still be reported and monitored as required under the original terms of \nthe Agreement and CYFD and HSD are obligated to meet the agreed upon Performance Standard \nas to each target as set forth in the Agreement. The commitments below are to be implemented in \naddition to the activities set forth in the Agreement for Appendix C.  \nCYFD and the Plaintiffs recognize the unique nature of these Appendix C commitments in that \nfull  implementation  involves  not  only  a  strong  commitment  from  CYFD,  but  ongoing \ncommunication and partnership, and consultation when necessary and appropriate, with the 23 \nN/P/Ts in New Mexico, as well as meaningful engagement of affected Native American children, \nyouth, and families.  \nThe Parties also recognize that Appendix C requires groundbreaking systemic innovations, which \nwill require creativity, flexibility, and an iterative process.  To demonstrate and ensure respect for \nNew Mexico’s N/P/Ts unique interest and time constraints, CYFD is committed to leveraging \nstanding meetings it has with interested N/P/Ts or their representatives to engage and collaborate \nto put into practice the system changes further identified below. CYFD agrees to be accountable \nfor responding to the input it receives from N/P/Ts as described below.  \nCYFD and the Plaintiffs recognize that each of the N/P/Ts are sovereign entities and not parties to \nthe Agreement and that nothing in either this Corrective Action Plan (CAP) or the Final Settlement \nAgreement (FSA) binds the N/P/Ts and that this CAP cannot commit the N/P/Ts to any activity or \nengagement contemplated by this CAP or the FSA.  Furthermore, the Parties agree each of the \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n15 \n\nN/P/Ts are in no way obligated to enter into an agreement, contract or engage with either CYFD, \nand do so at their sole discretion. \nCYFD agrees that within two weeks of any signed CAP, it will be shared with the N/P/Ts. The \nParties agree that any input from the N/P/Ts regarding this agreement will be shared with all \nParties. CYFD agrees to continue to provide the Co-Neutrals and the Plaintiffs with data pursuant \nto the 2022 MOU.  \nIn addition, CYFD agrees to provide the Co-Neutrals and the Plaintiffs with the number of Native \nchildren placed in IFPA preferred placements and the number of Native children not placed in \nIFPA preferred placements on a monthly basis beginning August 15, 2023.   \n1.  Joint Powers Agreements (JPA) \nBy September 1, 2023, CYFD will make good faith efforts to engage and negotiate with five \nN/P/Ts who are interested in a new or revised JPA, with initial outreach being made to the 5 N/P/T \nwith the most children in state custody.  Proposed discussions surrounding the JPAs shall include \nobligations or actions of the State and N/P/Ts regarding children, youth, or families of the \nrespective N/P/T child(ren) who are CISC under Protective Services. Proposed discussions may \nalso include any area of the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) and the Indian Family Protection \nAct (IFPA) identified and agreed to by the N/P/Ts and CYFD. Pursuant to the interests of the \nrespective N/P/T, JPA discussions and negotiations may also include but are not limited to on-\ngoing communication and collaborations (per the State-Tribal Collaboration Act and the IFPA), \nregarding behavioral health services, culture, data, financial and technical support, jurisdiction, \nreimbursement  for  legal  services,  notice,  preferred  placement,  recruitment  and  retention  of \nresource families, or relative licensing. The State recognizes the value of services and supports \nthat N/P/T representatives bring to meetings and discussions necessary to improve the State’s \nservices for Native CISC. As part of JPA discussions, the State will explore alternative single \nsource contracts for services that benefit N/P/Ts and assist the State in activities related to family \npreservation, IFPA and ICWA. CYFD also agrees to increase the resources of the General \nCounsel’s Office to negotiate the JPAs as quickly as possible.  \nBy December 31, 2023, CYFD will make good faith efforts to initiate engagement and negotiate \nwith any remaining N/P/Ts who wish to engage in discussions on JPAs. Any current efforts CYFD \nhas taken to collaborate, communicate, and negotiate with N/P/Ts on various matters, including \nbut not limited to JPAs, will continue.  \nBy December 31, 2023, with the explicit knowledge and permission from those N/P/Ts, CYFD \nwill inform the Co-Neutrals on the status of JPAs including  presentation materials, if any, \nincluding dates of meetings held and numbers of attendees, how many JPAs are being negotiated \nand projected timeline for completion, if known.  \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n16 \n\n2.  Native Resource Family Recruitment & Retention \nBy July 31, 2023, CYFD will revise the Licensing Standards procedure to include the input \nprovided from previous discussions and review between OTA and representatives of the N/P/Ts. \nBy July 19, 2023, during their standing meetings with N/P/T representatives, CYFD will provide \nfeedback on the specific barriers, if any, to the comments the N/P/T representatives have identified. \nCYFD will make its revised policy and procedure publicly available upon approval by the Cabinet \nSecretary.  \nBy July 1, 2023, CYFD will engage with the N/P/Ts to develop a recruitment and retention plan \nwhich centers the Native child, family and community and encourages and supports Tribal \ncommunity-based and family-based alliances. The retention portion of the plan will further \nprovide: \na.  Regular, on-going support provided to the resource family to help ensure the family is well \nequipped to address the behavioral, physical and psychological needs of the child, as well \nas ensuring cultural connectedness (as identified by the child’s family, tribal community, \nand N/P/T). \nb.  A mechanism to identify and reduce barriers for reimbursement. \nc.  A child-family-community centered model where services come to the child, family, and \nN/P/T. \nd.  Allows for specific input from individual Tribes regarding how to best recruit and retain \nfamilies in a way that will meet the needs of the specific Tribal community, including \nallowing for financial support to N/P/Ts to provide this service.  \ne.  An internal paradigm within CYFD of accountability and support to ensure the child and \nfamily are provided regular, on-going supportive services based on their individual needs, \nwhich fosters and promotes reunification, stable relative and community placement. \nIn the development of the recruitment and retention plans, CYFD will leverage its current standing \nmeetings  with  representatives  from  the  N/P/T  to  engage  them  in  identifying  steps  toward \naddressing barriers and providing additional supports throughout the resource family licensing \nprocess.   \nAfter  input  from  N/P/T,  the  statewide  recruitment  and  retention  plan  or  the  individualized \nrecruitment and retention plans as determined by the preference of the N/P/T will be finalized once \nthe communication and collaboration process has concluded.  \nCYFD will report to the Co-Neutrals and the Plaintiffs on the status of its efforts under this term \nquarterly (the 2023 third quarter report will be provided on or before October 23, 2023 and the \n2023 fourth quarter report will be provided on or before January 15, 2024).   \n3.  ICWA/IFPA Preferred Placement  \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n17 \n\nBy July 31, 2023, the Office of Tribal Affairs (OTA), with the support of Protective Services \nDivision (PSD or PS), will resume as the primary facilitators of CYFD’s Out of Preferred \nPlacement (OOPP) meetings. Feedback on the OOPP Team meeting process will be gathered \nquarterly  from  representatives  of  the  N/P/Ts  and  CYFD  will  work  in  a  collaborative  and \nmeaningful way to identify and address any on-going concerns. OOPP procedures will be revised \nand finalized no later than November 1, 2023.  Any OOPP procedural revisions shall be subject to \nreview and approval by the Co-Neutrals as set forth in the Agreement. The Co-Neutrals shall not \nwithhold approval of any policy revisions if such revisions are reasonably calculated to achieve \nthe goals of the Agreement. \na.  Review of all OOPPs (non-compliant with ICWA or IFPA placement preferences): \nThe placement of Native children with relatives is the highest order of priority.  \nFIRST LEVEL REVIEW PROCESS: If a Native child is placed in a non-relative \nhome that does not meet the highest order of priority pursuant to ICWA or IFPA, PSD \nwill notify OTA and the child’s N/P/T in writing within two business days of the \nplacement and schedule a 30-day relative placement meeting on all ICWA/IFPA cases, \nto include representation from OTA and a representative from the child’s N/P/T. These \nmeetings will be held every 30 days until the child is placed with a relative. The purpose \nof this meeting is to ensure active efforts to move the child into a relative placement \nare being made and that recommendations made by the meeting participants have been \nfollowed.  \nb.  PROPOSED: Second level internal review process pending review and feedback \nfrom N/P/T representatives: If the child remains in an OOPP that is not compliant \nwith ICWA or IFPA placement preferences for sixty (60) days, OTA and Protective \nServices leadership will review barriers and identify next steps, including person(s) \nresponsible, to move the child into the highest order of preferred placement with a \nrelative based on input from representatives of the N/P/T and the child’s team. The \npurpose  of  the  review  is  to  ensure  all  active  efforts  are  being  made  and \nrecommendations followed up on by the team members. A Protective Services Field \nDeputy Director and OTA will communicate in writing to the assigned PS worker, \nsupervisor, and managers, the respective Tribal representative(s), and other participants \nof the OOPP meetings the findings of the review and specific next steps and time \nframes for the completion of identified tasks within 15 days of the review. This internal \nreview process will recur every sixty (60) days if the Indian Child remains in an OOPP. \nAdditionally, OTA and the representative from the N/P/T will be notified of the same \nin writing within two business days. \nA review of the current process for this which identifies challenges and solutions with N/P/Ts shall \nbe conducted by July 30, 2023.  \n4.  Resources \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n18 \n\nWith the input from representatives from each N/P/T who are interested, CYFD will engage, \nnegotiate,  and  develop  a  written  agreement  template,  regarding  N/P/Ts  access  to  financial \nresources, including Title IV-E funds by November 30, 2023. By November 15, 2023, CYFD will \nsolicit feedback from representatives from the N/P/Ts by leveraging standing meetings hosted by \nthe Office of Tribal Affairs to identify the barriers and challenges currently existing which prevent \naccess to financial resources and identify a process to overcoming those barriers or challenges. In \naddition, CYFD will review their administrative processes regarding access to funds to make sure \nthat there are not barriers to their use. \nCYFD will further support N/P/T representatives who, at their discretion, chose to participate in \ntrainings offered free of cost to them by CYFD which may include but are not limited to: Safe and \nTogether, READ-i NM, Qualified Expert Witness, New Employee Training and trainings offered \nthrough existing contracts CYFD has with the New Mexico State University Center for Innovation. \nCYFD will support and coordinate with N/P/Ts, who at their discretion, choose to host trauma-\ninformed/-responsive training in their communities. \nTo further support the strategies necessary to achieve the intended outcomes of Appendix C of the \nAgreement, CYFD will seek to make funding accessible to N/P/Ts, who at their discretion choose \nto provide services for Native CISC including activities such as resource parent recruitment and \nretention efforts, home study development services, and/or traditional interventions or culturally \nresponsive services.  CYFD will offer single source contracts to interested N/P/T to the maximum \nextent that such funds are available for these activities.  If there are insufficient funds available to \noffer single source contracts to interested N/P/T, CYFD will include an additional funding in its \nbudget request to the Governor in advance of the 2024 legislative session.  \nIn addition, CYFD will identify and work to secure funding for competitive bid and single source \ncontracts with culturally competent, ICWA and IFPA knowledgeable N/P/T or entities, that have \nthe experience and expertise in working with N/P/T’s, communities and families for activities \nincluding but not limited to conducting culturally responsive home studies, relative searches, etc. \non behalf of Indian children in state custody.  \n5.  Data \nBy July 30, 2023, CYFD’s Office of Tribal Affairs and the Performance and Accountability \nDirector or designated staff will have made good faith efforts to identify any and all New Mexico \nN/P/Ts who have data request(s), including those for the number and location of children from \nspecific N/P/Ts with CYFD involvement, and establish a plan to respond accordingly based on the \nnature of those requests which includes a reasonable reporting cadence that is based on the \navailability of the data and the N/P/Ts’ specific request. By December 31, 2023, CYFD will report \nto the Co-Neutrals the number of data requests made by N/P/T, the date each request was made, \nand the date that requested data was provided.  The content of the data request and the N/P/T that \nmade the request does not need to be reported. \n6.  IFPA Notice \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n19 \n\n   \nIn recognition of the concern raised by N/T/Ps that CYFD was not consistently providing notice \nas required by IFPA, CYFD’s Office of Tribal Affairs Director and PSD leadership began to meet \nin June 2023 and shall continue to meet monthly beginning July 2023 to leverage standing \nmeetings  which  include  Tribal  partners  from  N/P/Ts  and  identify  barriers,  challenges,  and \nsolutions to timely notification and data entry. CYFD’s Performance and Accountability Director \nor staff will join OTA and PSD leadership in meeting quarterly and provide available data to \nreview progress and ongoing challenges as well as contribute ideas around additional solutions.   \nBy July 1, 2023, OTA and PSD will have a plan to solicit input from PSD staff, including \ninvestigators,  permanency,  placement,  legal  and  respective  supervisors  or  County  Office \nManagers, around barriers they are experiencing which prevent timely notification. Solutions to \ntimely notification developed by OTA and PSD leadership will be inclusive of feedback from PSD \nfield staff. CYFD will analyze the feedback, implement its plan and provide the same to the Co-\nNeutrals by November 1, 2023.  \nBy August 1, 2023, all pre-initiation investigation staffings will include a discussion regarding the \nactive efforts for proper inquiry about whether the child is a member of or there is “reason to \nknow” the child is a member of a N/P/T as well as CYFD’s conclusion of whether the child is a \nmember, there is reason to know the child is a member, or the child is not a member or there is \nreason to know the child is not a member. By July 31, 2023, all pre-initiation staffing forms will \nbe updated to include documentation regarding discussion outlined above.   \nBy August 1, 2023, if CYFD concludes the child is a member or there is reason to know the \nchild is a member of a N/P/T: \na.  the supervisor will review the Notice of  Investigation to ensure it is thoroughly \ncompleted and emailed to the proper N/P/T and cc: ICWA.Notice@cyfd.nm.gov, and \ndocument in CYFD’s electronic data management system that the notice and their \nreview was completed.  \nb.  Certified Notice with return receipt requested will be sent to the N/P/T pursuant to \nIFPA. CYFD will document in the electronic data management system the date the \ncertified notice was mailed and the date the return receipt indicates the N/P/T received \nthe notice. These documents will be placed in the corresponding physical file with a \ncomment in the electronic data management system indicating the same.  \nc.  Supervisors will conduct a monthly review of ICWA/IFPA cases in FACTS and the \ncorresponding physical file to ensure timely and accurate entries are occurring. This \nincludes appropriate narrative entries as described above and demographic data to \nensure N/P/Ts are correctly identified. Supervisor case reviews will be documented in \nthe electronic data management system (FACTS). \n \nCYFD agrees to ensure that OTA has sufficient staff to be able to implement these terms.  \n7.  Listening Session Follow-up \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n20 \n\nCYFD agrees to host an event before by December 1, 2023 to address the needs of Native CISC. \nThe event will take into account the interests of N/P/Ts and may include a number of issues that \nimpact Native CISC and their N/P/Ts such as discussion of behavioral health services and the \nprovision of culturally appropriate trauma responsive services to Native CISC.  \nN/P/T will be provided with opportunities to learn about all Kevin S. deliverables, the progress the \nState is making on the deliverables, and opportunities to provide input on them.  The Co-Neutrals \nand Plaintiffs’ counsel will be invited to attend this follow-up session.  \nIII. APPENDIX D TERMS \nThe Parties agree the following commitments will be implemented to improve compliance with \nAppendix D, Target Outcome 4. While the State’s performance with respect to this targetis no \nlonger in dispute, this target will still be reported and monitored as required under the original \nterms of the Agreement and CYFD and HSD are obligated to meet the agreed upon Performance \nStandard as to the target as set forth in the Agreement. The commitments below are to be \nimplemented in addition to the activities set forth in the Agreement for Appendix D, Target \nOutcome 4.  \n \nTo come into compliance with the FSA Requirement that 100% of CISC will receive a Well-\nChild visit within 30 days of entering state custody, HSD and CYFD will implement the following \nplan to ensure that 100% of children will receive a comprehensive Well-Child visit within 30 \ndays of entering state custody. This plan also outlines monthly reporting requirements regarding \nthe implementation and ongoing monitoring of comprehensive Well-Child visits. \n \n  CYFD will establish the CYFD Category of Eligibility (COE) within 6-8 days of the \nchild being received into state custody to ensure timely entry into the Medicaid eligibility \nsystem. Currently, this process  takes up to  30 days, creating delays in  receipt of \neligibility information by the MCO and in facilitating an appointment for the Well-Child \nvisit. By July 1, 2023, CYFD will issue a clarifying email regarding its procedures which \nwill include the following: \n \n1.  CYFD staff will ensure that placements are opened for children within two business \ndays of entering custody; and \n2.  Once the placement is open, it will batch overnight and be sent to the tickler tab of \nthe IV-E Specialist the following morning to enter the COE determination and ensure \nMCO selection if not already made; and  \nOnce the determination is made, it takes 24-48 hours to batch and show the COE in the \nMedicaid portal.   \n3.  HSD will ensure that the MCOs review the enrollment data file uploaded by HSD \ndaily to identify each child entering a CYFD COE. (Per LOD-69-1) \n \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n21 \n\n  HSD will ensure that the MCOs contact the member’s assigned CYFD Permanency \nPlanning Worker (PPW) within three (3) business days of notification of the child’s \nenrollment and assign a care coordinator to engage with the child and/or the child’s team. \nThe MCO will request contact information for the child’s caregiver/resource parent, \nlegal  representative  (GAL/Youth  Attorney),  parent/guardian  and  legal  custodian \n(CYFD) during this contact. The CYFD PPW will provide all information to the MCO \nto ensure needed coordination with the persons necessary to accompany and attend the \nchild’s appointment. (Per LOD-69-1) \n \n  To ensure that the Well-Child visit is scheduled to occur within 30 days of entry into \nstate custody, HSD will require the MCO to utilize their internal resources, including the \nchild’s assigned care coordinator, a community health worker, a care worker, or a tribal \nliaison to ensure that the visit is scheduled in collaboration with the child and the child’s \nlegal custodian (CYFD PPW), caregiver/resource parent, and parent/guardian (where \nappropriate)  to  avoid  scheduling  conflicts  and  to  ensure  that  barriers  such  as \ntransportation and language access have been addressed.  Care coordination efforts will \nbe documented. \n \n  HSD will ensure that the MCOs document that the child’s legal custodian (CYFD PPW), \ncaregiver/resource  parent,  and  parent/guardian  (where  appropriate)  was  offered \neducation on the importance of the Well-Child visit and the availability of supports (such \nas transportation and translation services) to support appointment adherence. The CYFD \nPPW will ensure that all caregivers are aware of how to access MCO care coordination \nservices and of the availability of support through care coordination to schedule the \nWell-Child  visit.  The  MCO  and  CYFD  will  document  when  the  child  and/or \ncaregiver/resource parent is difficult to engage, refuses care coordination, and/or declines \nassistance with scheduling the appointment and all efforts to engage the child and/or \ncaregiver/resource parent The MCO and CYFD will also document instances in which the \nchild’s caregiver/resource parent is not able to make appointments within 30 days due \nto  a  scheduling  issue  in  the  household  and  will  document  all  efforts  made  to \naccommodate any such scheduling issue. HSD will issue a Letter of Direction to the \nMCOs regarding their obligations in this CAP by July 1, 2023.   \n \nWhen the child and/or the child’s caregiver/resource parent declines assistance with \nscheduling the appointment, the MCO will be required to follow up with the child and/or \nchild’s caregiver/resource parent within 10 days of the declination. If the appointment has \nstill not been scheduled, the MCO will once again offer assistance to the child and/or the \nchild’s caregiver/resource parent. \n \nHSD will ensure that the MCOs utilize available provider resources, including the \nchild’s Primary Care Provider (PCP), School Based Health Centers (SBHCs), Federally \nQualified Health Centers (FQHCs), Rural Health Clinic (RHCs), and/or tribal providers \nto schedule the comprehensive Well-Child visit. HSD will mandate that the MCOs \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n22 \n\npromptly reimburse providers in compliance with the timeline requirements within the \nMCO contract, section 4.19 Claims Management. and provide education and training to \nproviders to understand the requirement for a Well-Child visit within 30 days of entry \ninto state custody. HSD agrees to communicate this requirement through an LOD by \nJuly 1, 2023.  \nFor children who are in the fee-for-service (FFS) Medicaid program or for MCO enrolled children \nfor whom all provider options have been exhausted and after 21 days after entry into state custody \nan appointment has not been scheduled, HSD and CYFD will enter into a Memorandum of \nUnderstanding (MOU) to facilitate Well-Child visits so that the visit occurs within 30 days of the \nchild entering custody through public health offices at the Department of Health (DOH). The \nMOU will allow HSD, CYFD and the MCOs to work directly with DOH on facilitating Well-\nChild visits for children in state custody through Public Health Offices around the state.   \n \n  The State will come into full compliance with Target Outcome 4 (100% of children in \nstate custody receiving a Well-Child visit within 30 days) by January 1, 2024; this target \nis for remedial purposes and does not change the FSA deliverable date.  \n \nBy July 1, 2023, HSD will begin implementing the following validation protocol: \n1.  HSD will establish a process with the MCO care coordinators to collect information \nand report on completion of well-child visits for children. \n2.  CYFD will ensure case workers are entering completion of well-child visits in FACTS. \n3.  CYFD will run monthly reports on performance of completed well-child visits within \n30 days of children entering care beginning with all children who enter care on July 1, \n2023 and later. CYFD will spot check these reports for accuracy with the data provided \nby  HSD  from  care  coordinators.  For  the  purposes  of  ensuring  compliance,  the \nvalidation will not include any children in custody less than 30 days.  \n4.  By the 5th of the month following when well-child visits should occur for children \nnewly entering care, the State will provide monthly performance data which has \nundergone an initial QA check to the Co-Neutrals. For example, performance data for \nchildren who entered care in July 2023 will be provided on September 5, 2023, \nperformance data for children who entered care in August 2023 will be provided on \nOctober 5, 2023, and so on.  The final data submission will be provided on January 5, \n2024 for children who enter care in November 2023.  \n5.  The Co-Neutrals will request documentation verifying completion of a well-child visit \nfor a sample of 50% of children, but not more than 25 children. The State will provide \nthe requested information to the Co-Neutrals within 5 business days. Through the \nvalidation work, if the Co-Neutrals identify issues, they can request information for \nmore than 25 children in a month. The Co-Neutrals will share validation findings with \nthe State and Plaintiffs.   \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n23 \n\n  The State will ensure that all children who entered care before July 1, 2023 and are still \nin custody on September 15, 2023 have a completed well-child visit by September 15, \n2023. The Co-Neutrals will request documentation verifying completion of a well-child \nvisit for a sample of 10% of children in the pre-July 1, 2023 cohort. The Co-Neutrals will \nshare validation findings with the State and Plaintiffs.   \n \nIV. OTHER TERMS  \nNothing in this CAP shall preclude either Party from exercising their rights under the Agreement \nincluding, but not limited to, Plaintiffs' right to arbitrate any and all remaining unresolved issues \nand to secure any and all relief and remedies provided by the Agreement. \n \n     \nDated: 6/30/2023 By:   \nTeresa Casados, Interim Cabinet, Secretary] \nNEW MEXICO CHILDREN, YOUTH AND FAMILIES \nDEPARTMENT] \n \n \n     \n6/30/2023\nDated:  By:   \nKari Armijo, Acting Cabinet Secretary] \nNEW MEXICO HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT \n \n \n     \nDated: 6/30/2023 By:   \nTara Ford \nPLAINTIFFS’ IMPLEMENTATION TEAM \n \n \nKevin S. v.

Exercise caution prior to clicking on\nlinks or opening attachments.\nAll,\nI am writing to initiate Step 1 of the dispute resolution process described in Section IX of the\nKevin S. Final Settlement Agreement (“Settlement Agreement”).  \nAt this time, Plaintiffs invoke the dispute resolution process with respect to each and every\nImplementation Target and Target Outcome validated by the Co-Neutrals in their November\n15, 2022 Report (“November 2022 Report”) with findings that HSD and CYFD failed to meet\nthe Performance Standard agreed to in the Settlement Agreement.  Plaintiffs’ position with\nrespect to each of these issues is that CYFD and HSD have not met their obligations under the\nSettlement Agreement.\nGiven the failure to meet the Performance Standard on over half of the Implementation\nTargets and total failure to meet the Performance Standard on every Target Outcome\nmeasured for the November 2022 Report, Plaintiffs’ position is that CYFD and HSD have\nfailed to adequately staff their efforts to meet their obligations under the Settlement\n\nAgreement. \nIn further support of Plaintiffs’ position that CYFD and HSD are not adequately staffed to\ncomply with their Kevin S. obligations, we note that Plaintiffs initiated Step 1 of the dispute\nresolution process on December 8, 2021 to address issues identified in the Co-Neutral’s 2021\nReport.  In June 2022, the Parties reached an Memorandum Of Understanding (“MOU”) to\nresolve many of the issues raised in the Plaintiffs’ December 8, 2021 dispute, yet CYFD and\n[1]\nHSD failed to fully implement the MOU with respect to several specific deliverables.  In\naddition, the Parties were unable to reach agreement on two key concepts related to the\nSettlement Agreement: 1) the requirement that there must be consideration of whether\ncommunity-based services had been or could be provided when determining medical\nnecessity; and 2) reaching an agreement on the definition of extraordinary circumstances.  The\nlack of agreement on these key concepts related to the Settlement Agreement and the areas of\nnon-compliance with the MOU are outstanding disputes and Plaintiffs reserve the right to seek\narbitration related to the December 8, 2021 notice of dispute.\nIt is Plaintiffs’ position that resolution of the issues in this dispute must prioritize and\nmeasurably address the four recommendations identified in the November 2022 Co-Neutral\nReport:\n(1)strengthening and stabilizing the CYFD and HSD workforce;\n(2)growing resource family placements;\n(3)expanding behavioral and mental health services; and\n(4)strengthening the collaboration and communication with New Mexico’s Nations, Pueblos,\nand Tribes.\nResolution will also require adequate staffing and management by HSD and CYFD of the\nobligations under the Agreement.  In addition, it is Plaintiffs’ position that HSD and CYFD\nneed to provide real time data to the Co-Neutrals for more frequent validated progress reports\nto enable the parties to timely monitor progress under the Settlement Agreement.\nWe are invoking the mediation process in hopes of reaching agreement among all Parties\nabout what steps CYFD and HSD will take to bring the agencies into compliance with their\nobligations under the Settlement Agreement. We will come prepared with proposals for a\ncorrective action plan and encourage all other Parties to do the same. \nBest, \nTara\nOn Behalf of the Kevin S.

Blalock, et al., No. 1:18-cv-00896   \nAMENDED NOTICE OF ARBITRATION \nI.  Introduction \nPursuant to Section IX of the Parties’ March 2020 Final Settlement Agreement (“FSA”) in \nthe matter of Kevin S. v Blalock, et al.,1 and the Parties’ June 2023 Corrective Action Plan \n(“CAP”),2 Plaintiffs notify you of their intention to proceed to arbitration to adopt the Co-Neutrals’ \nfindings  made  in  their  January  2024  letter3  and  their  February  2024  CAP  Implementation \nMemorandum4 and to seek enforcement of the CAP.5 \nPlaintiffs  amend  the  Notice  of  Arbitration  dated  May  20,  2024  to  clarify  Plaintiffs \nrespectfully request the Arbitrator order specific performance to enforce the CAP, award attorneys’ \nfees and costs and any other relief that the Arbitrator deems fair and proper, including but not \nlimited to the relief available under the FSA. \nIn the four years since the Kevin S. lawsuit settled, the Co-Neutrals have consistently \nreported that CYFD and HSD have not complied with the crucial measures they contractually \nagreed to undertake to protect children in state custody in exchange for Plaintiffs dismissing the \nlawsuit. Most recently, in the 2023 CAP, the State agreed to perform a series of specific, \nmeasurable deliverables by December 2023. After the CAP’s deadlines expired, the Co-Neutrals \n \n1 The FSA is attached as Exhibit A.  \n2 The 2023 CAP is attached as Exhibit B. \n3 The January 26, 2024 letter is attached as Exhibit D.  \n4 The February 23, 2024 CAP Implementation Memorandum is attached as Exhibit E.  \n5 Nothing in this notice is intended to waive other arbitration claims that may develop after additional reports by the \nCo-Neutrals or as other evidence is later discovered. \n \n              \n DAVID B. MARTINEZ  |  F. MICHAEL HART  |  KELLY STOUT SANCHEZ  |  JULIO C. ROMERO  |  MICHAEL HART \n505-343-1776     l     Fax: 505-344-7709     l     1801 Rio Grande Blvd NW   -   Suite A   -   Albuquerque, NM 87104     l     OsoLawFirm.com \n\nAmended Notice of Arbitration  \nJuly 15, 2024 \nPage 2 of 6 \n_____________________ \ninvestigated the State’s performance over that six-month period agreed to in the CAP and found \nthat the State failed to keep its promises.  \nThe State’s breach of the CAP is not just a breach of contract. It is a series of fundamental \nprogrammatic failures that endanger children in state custody across New Mexico. Indeed, after \nthe Co-Neutrals’ assessment in September 2023, which described a child welfare system in a “state \nof  chaos,”  the  Co-Neutrals  reported  in  January  2024  that  “[t]he  State’s  weak  performance \nimplementing many aspects of the CAP – for example, with respect to caseloads and focused \nresource family recruitment – appears to have worsened the situation.”6 The result is “serious risk[] \nto child and staff safety.”7 \nII. Procedure \nUnder the FSA, the Parties agreed to engage in alternative dispute resolution (Step 1) prior \nto initiating binding arbitration (Step 2). Plaintiffs have fulfilled this precondition.  In December \n2021, Plaintiffs initiated Step 1 based on CYFD and HSD’s failure to comply with the FSA. \nMediation resulted in the Parties’ June 2022 Memorandum of Understanding (“2022 MOU”), \nwhich supplemented the FSA and set forth commitments the State agreed to undertake to come \ninto compliance with the State’s obligations under the FSA.8 In January 2023, based on CYFD \nand HSD’s continued breach of the FSA and noncompliance with the 2022 MOU, Plaintiffs again \ninitiated Step 1 in continued efforts to work with the State. Mediation resulted in the Parties’ June \n2023 CAP, which again supplemented the FSA and the 2022 MOU and obligated the State to take \nand accomplish specific goals in order to comply with its contractual obligations it agreed to under \nthe  FSA,  including  promises  regarding  workforce  development,  reduction  of  caseloads, \nrecruitment of resource families, and the provision of critical healthcare to children in state \ncustody. \nPursuant to the terms of the FSA, the Parties agreed that the Co-Neutrals would determine \nif Defendants met their contractual obligations to undertake Implementation Targets and reach \nTarget Outcomes in exchange for Plaintiffs’ dismissing the litigation.9  As provided by Section \nIX(A), if a party breached the FSA or a corrective action plan agreed to in a subsequent ADR \nprocess, then a party could proceed to arbitration.10  As outlined below, the Co-Neutrals have \nfound, based on the data provided by Defendants, that Defendants have failed to keep their \npromises made in the CAP.  Defendants now have the burden to show that the Co-Neutrals’ report \nwas clearly erroneous.11 \n \n \n6 Letter from Co-Neutrals to the Parties (Sept. 18, 2023) (Re: Follow up from Co-Neutrals’ Site Visit) is attached as \nExhibit C; Letter from Co-Neutrals to the Parties (Jan. 26, 2024) (Re: Follow up from Co-Neutrals’ Site Visit) is \nattached as Exhibit D. \n7 See Exhibit D. \n8 See Exhibit B. \n9 See Exhibit A, FSA Section VI(A) and (B).   \n10 Id,  FSA Section IX(A).   \n11 Id. FSA Sections VI and IX. \n\nAmended Notice of Arbitration  \nJuly 15, 2024 \nPage 3 of 6 \n_____________________ \nIII.  Disputes for Arbitration \nThe State has breached its obligations under the CAP in four areas. \nA.  CYFD Workforce Caseloads \nIn the CAP, CYFD promised to reach the following caseloads standards as follows: \na)  By December 31, 2023, no Investigation Case, Permanency Planning, In-Home Services, \nor Placement worker will have over 200% of the applicable caseload standards documented \nin the 2023 Data Validation Plan approved by the Co-Neutrals, including trainees with \ngraduated caseloads.  \n \nb)  By December 31, 2023, no supervisor will be carrying any cases.  \nAs provided in the Co-Neutrals’ CAP Implementation Memorandum, the Co-Neutrals \ndetermined based on the data submitted by the State, 19 percent of case-assignable CYFD workers \nhad caseloads above 200% of the applicable caseload standard.12 Of CYFD workers assigned as a \nprimary worker on at least one case, 13 percent were supervisors.13  CYFD has breached its \ncontractual obligations under the CAP regarding caseloads. \nB.  Resource Family Recruitment \nIn the CAP, CYFD and HSD are required to coordinate and find Treatment Foster Care \n(TFC) placements for children in state custody that are enrolled in a managed care organization.14 \nAs such, CYFD and HSD are necessarily responsible for recruiting additional TFC placements. In \naddition, CYFD promised to reach the following standards regarding resource family recruitment. \na)  In five high-needs counties (Bernalillo, Dona Ana, Santa Fe, San Juan, and Chavez/Eddy), \nCYFD will immediately assign one placement staff to focus exclusively on recruitment \nuntil at least September 30, 2023. The State will maintain its dedicated public staff in the \n5 designated counties at least until the private contractor has fully ramped up its capacity \nin those 5 designated counties. \n \nb)  CYFD will enter into contracts with at least one private provider for resource family \nrecruitment by September 30, 2023 to focus on foster home recruitment and retention with \nspecific capacity focused on growing new foster homes in each county throughout the \nState.  \n \nIn September 2023, the Co-Neutrals interviewed workers at two of the five high-needs \ncounties, and “no one interviewed in either office was able to identify a placement worker whose \n \n12 Co-Neutrals’ Corrective Action Plan (CAP) Implementation Memorandum at 4-5 (Feb. 23, 2024) (with \nattachments 1 and 2) (hereinafter Co-Neutrals’ CAP Memo) is attached as Exhibit E. \n13 Id. at 5. \n14 CAP at 4. \n\nAmended Notice of Arbitration  \nJuly 15, 2024 \nPage 4 of 6 \n_____________________ \nsole, or even primary, responsibility was resource home recruitment.”15 Based on data submitted \nby the State, only one of these five counties saw any meaningful progress with resource family \nrecruitment in the period between June 30, 2023 and November 30, 2023, with three showing net \nlosses in the number of licensed resource homes.16  \n \nNor is there any evidence that the State is working on contracting with a private contractor \nto develop better resource family recruitment in each county throughout the state. Based on their \ninvestigation, the Co-Neutrals are “unable to confirm that specific capacity focused on growing \nnew resource homes in each county throughout the State has been added pursuant to the CAP \ncommitments.”17 Instead, their investigation indicated that  CYFD “appears to have lost ground” \nwith resource family recruitment; workers report that planning for resource family recruitment is \ndiscussed on an ad hoc basis, and there is no funding available for resource family recruitment \nactivities.18 As of the State’s agreed upon deadline, the State has failed to launch the private \ncontractor recruitment model in a single county.19 \n \nC.  Well-Child Visits \nIn the CAP, CYFD and HSD committed to providing the Co-Neutrals with necessary data \nto report on and to meet the following standards regarding well-child visits: \na)  The State will come into full compliance with Target Outcome 4 (100% of children in state \ncustody receiving a Well-Child visit within 30 days) by January 1, 2024; this target is for \nremedial purposes and does not change the FSA deliverable date.  \n \nb)  The State will ensure that all children who entered care before July 1, 2023 and are still in \ncustody on September 15, 2023 have a completed well-child visit by September 15, 2023.  \n \nThe Co-Neutrals reported that as of January 4, 2024 the available data “do[es] not indicate \nthat all children in state custody received a completed well-child visit within 30 days of entering \ncare.”20 Of the records the Co-Neutrals were able to review, over 25 percent of children who \nentered care in 2023 did not have a well-child visit within 30 days of entry.  \n \nD.  Data Submissions \n \nThe State promised in the CAP to provide the Co-Neutrals with real-time data necessary \nfor the Co-Neutrals to report on the State’s compliance. In January 2024, the Co-Neutrals reported \nthey were missing multiple important data submissions from the State.21 Within the timeline \nrequested, the Co-Neutrals did not receive: \n \n15 Co-Neutrals’ CAP Memo at 8 \n16 Id. at 8. \n17 Id. at 9. \n18 Id.  at 9. \n19 Id.  at 9. \n20 Id. at 18. \n21 Id. at 18-19. \n\nAmended Notice of Arbitration  \nJuly 15, 2024 \nPage 5 of 6 \n_____________________ \n1)  Quarterly data on the total number of Treatment Foster Care (“TFC”) homes. \n \n2)  Well-child records for over one-third of children whose records were requested by the \nCo-Neutrals.  \nThese failures to provide data to the Co-Neutrals are also a breach of the CAP. \nE.  Plaintiffs’ Request for Additional Documentation of Compliance  \nOn March 5, 2024, Plaintiffs requested CYFD and HSD provide Plaintiffs with the State’s \nposition regarding the Co-Neutrals’ findings set forth in Co-Neutrals’ CAP Memo.22 The State \nresponded by letter dated March 12, 2024, which letter did not dispute that key elements of the \nCAP were not achieved.23 \nIV. Conclusion \n \nThe Co-Neutrals’ findings clearly demonstrate that the State has not performed a number \nof its essential obligations in the CAP—promises that the Co-Neutrals have repeatedly stressed \nare crucial to the safety and wellbeing of children in state custody in New Mexico. Plaintiffs remain \ncommitted to enforcing CYFD and HSD’s contractual promises. Based on the State’s breach of \nthe CAP, Plaintiffs are seeking specific performance of the CAP, attorneys’ fees and costs, and \nany other relief that the Arbitrator deems fair and proper, including but not limited to the relief \navailable under the FSA. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \nF.

In the event that any of the Co-Neutrals are \nunavailable to serve in this role or become unable to serve in this role during the term of this \nAgreement, the Parties agree to appoint a subject matter expert to serve in their place, so that \nthere are always three Co-Neutrals at any time.     \nRole as Neutrals: The Co-Neutrals shall function in a neutral capacity and shall exercise \ntheir duties under this Agreement in good faith and without bias in favor of or against any Party.  \nThe retention of the Co-Neutrals shall be conducted solely pursuant to the procedures set forth in \nthis Agreement and shall not be governed by any formal or legal procurement requirements.  The \nCo-Neutrals shall hire such staff and engage such consultants as the Co-Neutrals deem necessary \nto discharge their responsibilities under this Agreement.  As a courtesy, the Co-Neutrals shall \nprovide the resumes of any staff members or consultants working on the implementation of this \nAgreement to Defendants, but Defendants shall not have any authority over the Co-Neutrals’ \nchoice or assignment of staff members and/or consultants. \nFees: Defendants shall be responsible for paying the Co-Neutrals’ fees and costs and the \nfees and costs required for staff and/or consultants assisting the Co-Neutrals. \nAuthority: The Co-Neutrals shall have the authority reasonably necessary to validate \nbaseline performance related to all Target Outcomes and to evaluate and audit progress toward \nachievement of the Implementation Targets and Target Outcomes.  That authority includes the \nability to hire staff and engage consultants; contract with entities for data analysis and/or \nvalidation; request and receive reports and updates at regular intervals; request underlying data, \nfiles, and records; conduct verification activities, including communicating independently with \nany individual, including but not limited to executive branch staff, providers, caregivers and \nothers as they determine necessary; and gather other information from Defendants.  Defendants \nshall provide the Co-Neutrals with remote access to the Agencies’ electronic data systems that \ncollect or record information necessary to validate performance under this Agreement.  All final \nreports prepared by the Co-Neutrals in connection with this Agreement shall be public \ndocuments and shall be posted on the Parties’ websites.  The Co-Neutrals shall have the authority \nto change the deadlines for the Co-Neutrals’ reports, but changes to any such deadlines will not \nhave the effect of changing the deadlines for Defendants’ reports. \nB.  Implementation Targets and Target Outcomes \nImplementation Targets are process commitments that Defendants agree to undertake as \nintermediary and necessary steps toward reaching the Target Outcomes.  \n \nTarget Outcomes are performance commitments that Defendants agree to reach in \nconsideration for Plaintiffs’ agreement to dismiss the Kevin S. Litigation.  \n \n  The Appendices define and set forth Implementation Targets and Target Outcomes in the \nfollowing subject areas:       \n– Trauma-Responsive System of Care (Appendix A) \n– Least Restrictive and Appropriate Placements (Appendix B) \n42822446.1   \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 5 \n\n \n– Indian Child Welfare Act (Appendix C) \n– Behavioral Health Services (Appendix D) \n \nDeadlines:  The Parties have negotiated specific completion dates for each \nImplementation Target and Target Outcome.  Defendants agree to adhere to these deadlines.  The \nParties may not modify, amend or extend these deadlines other than by mutual consent in \nwriting.   \nC.  Implementation \n1. Data Validation Plan: By December 1, 2020, Defendants will submit to Plaintiffs and \nthe Co-Neutrals a written Data Validation Plan that has been approved by the Co-Neutrals.  \nDefendants and the Co-Neutrals shall begin to collaborate on the Data Validation Plan by March \n15, 2020.  The Data Validation Plan will set forth a process, including methodology and data \nsources, for validating Defendants’ progress toward achieving the Implementation Targets and \nTarget Outcomes.  The Data Validation Plan will set clear timelines for taking any intermediary \nsteps necessary to validate progress toward the Implementation Targets and Target Outcomes \nand assign responsibility for supplying information necessary to fulfill the Data Validation Plan.  \nThe Co-Neutrals will evaluate the Data Validation Plan in consultation with each Party.  \nCompletion of a Data Validation Plan that has the approval of the Co-Neutrals is an \nImplementation Target.  The Parties will attempt to resolve any disagreements about the Data \nValidation Plan in good faith.  If they cannot do so, any disputes about the Data Validation Plan \nshall proceed through the dispute resolution process in Section IX on an expedited basis, with \ndeadlines set by the Co-Neutrals and the arbitrator, as appropriate.   \n    2. Baseline Reports:  By December 1, 2020, Defendants will provide to Plaintiffs and \nthe Co-Neutrals a baseline report and all data underlying the report.  The baseline report shall \nassess Defendants’ achievement of the Implementation Targets.  It shall also describe \nDefendants’ baseline performance with respect to the Target Outcomes during the period from \nJanuary 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019.   \n    By April 1, 2021, the Co-Neutrals shall provide a baseline report to Plaintiffs and \nDefendants.  The Co-Neutrals’ baseline report shall validate Defendants’ achievement of the \nImplementation Targets pursuant to the Data Validation Plan and shall include a determination \nof whether Defendants have met the Performance Standard with respect to each Implementation \nTarget.  The Co-Neutrals’ baseline report shall also validate Defendants’ performance with \nrespect to the Target Outcomes during the period from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019.   \n    If the Co-Neutrals cannot validate Defendants’ data in accordance with the Data \nValidation Plan for any reason, including but not limited to concerns about availability or \naccuracy of data sources, the Co-Neutrals and their staff and/or consultants will establish a \nbaseline using a quantitative and qualitative review protocol, which may incorporate third party \ndata, information from Plaintiffs, and sampling procedures. \n42822446.1   \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 6 \n\n \n  Before issuing their final report, the Co-Neutrals will: 1) provide the Parties no fewer than \n15 Days to comment on a draft report, 2) confer with each party about the draft report, and 3) \ntake into consideration each party’s comments.   \n  The baseline reports shall be made public on the Parties’ websites.  \n    3. Data: By May 1, 2021, and every twelve months thereafter, Defendants shall provide \nto Plaintiffs and the Co-Neutrals any data required to validate the Target Outcomes for the \nprevious calendar year.  For example, data covering the period from January 1, 2020 to \nDecember 31, 2020 shall be provided by May 1, 2021. \n    4. Annual Reports:  By August 1, 2021, and every twelve months thereafter, Defendants \nshall provide to Plaintiffs and the Co-Neutrals a written report of their progress with respect to \nthe Target Outcomes and Implementation Targets.  The period of assessment for each annual \nreport shall be the previous calendar year—for example, the report due by May 1, 2021 shall \ndescribe Defendants’ performance from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020.  Defendants’ \nannual reports and any plans, reviews, or policies referenced therein shall be made public on the \nParties’ websites.  These assessments are intended to be informational, and disagreements related \nto the content of these reports shall not proceed through the dispute resolution process in Section \nIX. \n  By November 15, 2021, and at least every twelve months thereafter, the Co-Neutrals shall \nprovide a report to the Parties on Defendants’ progress towards the Implementation Targets and \nTarget Outcomes.  The period of assessment for each annual report shall be the previous calendar \nyear—for example, the report due by November 15, 2021 shall describe Defendants’ \nperformance from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020.  The Co-Neutrals shall give the Parties \nno fewer than 15 Days to comment on a draft report, shall confer with each Party, and shall take \nthe Parties’ comments into consideration when finalizing their reports.     \n  The Defendants’ and Co-Neutrals’ reports will assess Defendants’ progress with respect to \neach Implementation Target and Target Outcome and will evaluate whether Defendants have met \nthe Performance Standard with respect to any Implementation Target and Target Outcome for \nwhich the deadline is due or has passed.  In making these assessments, Defendants and the Co-\nNeutrals shall consider evidence gathered pursuant to the Data Validation Plan and any \nqualitative review protocol, as well as data and information provided by the Parties, data and \ninformation available from third party sources, and other relevant factors.  They shall also \nconsider the Goals and the prefatory language in each Appendix.  A lack of progress shown in \ndata (or even negative data) as to any Implementation Target or Target Outcome does not require \na finding that Defendants have not met the Performance Standard.  If Defendants fail to provide \naccurate and verifiable data in a timely manner, the Co-Neutrals may find that they have not met \nthe Performance Standard. \n  Defendants’ and the Co-Neutrals’ annual reports shall also discuss efforts by Defendants to \nachieve the designated Performance Standard for each Implementation Target and Target \nOutcome and any activities that Defendants and/or the Co-Neutrals have undertaken to meet \ntheir obligations under this Agreement during the previous year.  \n  The Co-Neutrals’ methods may include, but are not limited to, analyses of information \ncollected by Defendants’ management and information systems (if and when available and \n42822446.1   \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 7 \n\naccurate), reviews of case records, aggregation of data, and interviews with Defendants’ \npersonnel, contractors and their staff and/or consultants, service providers and their staff and/or \nconsultants, Children in State Custody or formerly in state custody and their families, and other \nchild welfare and behavioral health stakeholders.  A Child in State Custody will only be \ninterviewed if they affirmatively agree to be interviewed.  The Co-Neutrals will provide \nreasonable notice of any planned interview with a Child in State Custody to the child’s Guardian \nad Litem or Youth Attorney.  If the Guardian ad Litem or Youth Attorney believes that an \ninterview will harm the Child in State Custody, the Guardian ad Litem or Youth Attorney will \nnotify the Co-Neutrals and the interview will not proceed.  \n5. Monitoring: The Implementation Targets are steps that need not be monitored once \nthey have been achieved.  If the Co-Neutrals find that the Defendants have met the Performance \nStandard for a specific Implementation Target, that Implementation Target shall not be \nreassessed in further reports.  If the Co-Neutrals find that the Defendants have not met the \nPerformance Standard for a specific Implementation Target, the Implementation Target shall be \nreassessed every year thereafter until the Performance Standard is met. \nEach Target Outcome shall be monitored until Defendants have met the Performance \nStandard for that Target Outcome continuously for a period of at least 24 months, as described in \nSection VIII. \n6. Meetings: The Co-Neutrals shall preside over a meeting between the Parties at least \ntwice a year.  In 2020, the Parties and Co-Neutrals shall make every effort to hold these meetings \nin July and December.  In all subsequent years, the Parties and Co-Neutrals shall make every \neffort to hold the first meeting no more than 30 Days after the release of Defendants’ annual \nreport and the second meeting no more than 30 Days after the release of the Co-Neutrals’ annual \nreport.  The Parties may provide comments on Defendants’ and/or the Co-Neutrals’ reports to the \nCo-Neutrals and all other Parties in advance of each meeting.   \nVII.REQUESTS FOR AND ACCESS TO INFORMATION\nRequests for Information: The Parties agree that in order to create the Data Validation\nPlan, to set a baseline for the Target Outcomes, and to evaluate progress toward achieving the \nImplementation Targets and Target Outcomes, the Co-Neutrals and their staff and/or consultants \nwill require reasonable access to information.  \nDefendants will designate an employee to facilitate the Co-Neutrals’ access to information, \nincluding access to Defendants’ personnel.  The employee will be accountable to both CYFD \nand HSD and will have expertise in the issues covered by this Agreement and its Appendices.  \nThe designated employee will provide the Co-Neutrals and their staff and/or consultants with \naccess to all requested information, including confidential information, and will not have the \nauthority to deny any Co-Neutral’s request for information or access, or otherwise to restrict the \nCo-Neutrals’ access to information.  In addition to ensuring that the Co-Neutrals have remote \nelectronic access to Defendants’ data systems that collect or record information necessary to \nvalidate performance under this Agreement, Defendants will respond to any requests for \nadditional information from the Co-Neutrals within 14 Days of the request unless the Co-\n42822446.1 \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 8 \n\n \nNeutrals agree to a different deadline.  Plaintiffs may submit proposed written requests for \ninformation to the Co-Neutrals, who may in their discretion submit such requests to Defendants.  \n  The Parties and Co-Neutrals will enter into a Protective Order to facilitate access to \nconfidential information.  In the event the Co-Neutrals seek the review of confidential \ninformation contained in the individual records of Proposed Class members not named as \nplaintiffs in this proceeding, Disability Rights New Mexico (“DRNM”) and Native American \nDisability Law Center (“NADLC”) may obtain those records and release them to counsel \npursuant to their federal authority and with the consent of the individual or their guardian.  \nWhere DRNM and NADLC lack authority to obtain or release the record, the following \nprocedures will apply: \na)  Plaintiffs will obtain a release from the individual child if they are age 14 or older and from \nthe child’s parent/guardian if they are younger than 14.  Plaintiffs may use the release to obtain \nthe information sought directly.  \nb)  If the name/contact information is not known to Plaintiffs but is known to Defendants, \nDefendants will provide that information so that Plaintiffs may obtain a release. \nc)  If there is no way to obtain a release or if Plaintiffs believe that effort will be futile and there \nis reasonable cause to believe that an individual child is not being appropriately served under this \nAgreement, Plaintiffs may seek an order from any court of competent jurisdiction requiring the \nrelease of confidential information from CYFD, HSD, and/or the provider of services.  Under \nmost circumstances, Defendants will take no position on the request or will stipulate to the order \nfor the release of information so long as notice is provided to the individual child and legal \nguardian and they are given an opportunity to be heard, and so long as the requested order \nincludes provisions adequate to protect the confidential information from unauthorized \ndisclosure.    \n  Access to Defendants’ Personnel: As reasonably necessary to assess the implementation of \nthis Agreement, the Co-Neutrals and their staff and/or consultants shall have the power to confer \nwith and interview Defendants’ personnel.  The Co-Neutrals must direct any request to meet \nwith Defendants’ personnel to the employee designated to facilitate the Co-Neutrals’ access to \ninformation in first instance.  Plaintiffs and Defendants’ Counsel shall receive reasonable notice \nof the dates and topics of such meetings and may propose that alternate or additional personnel \nprovide information to the Co-Neutrals regarding the designated topics.  The Co-Neutrals shall \ndecide whether to confer with and interview the alternate or additional personnel proposed by the \nParties.  Neither Party shall send representatives to such meetings aside from the personnel to be \ninterviewed.  Defendants’ personnel must participate in the meeting in good faith and Defendants \nshall not retaliate against any of their personnel who provide information to the Co-Neutrals or \ntheir designees.  The Parties may propose to the Co-Neutrals the names or positions of any of \nDefendants’ personnel that they believe should be interviewed about Defendants’ progress \ntowards meeting the Implementation Targets and Target Outcomes.    \n \nVIII.  CERTIFICATION OF IMPLEMENTATION TARGETS AND TARGET \nOUTCOMES \n42822446.1   \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 9 \n\n \n  When the Co-Neutrals certify that Defendants have met the Performance Standard for an \nImplementation Target, or have met the Performance Standard for a Target Outcome for a \ncontinuous period of no less than 24 months, they may certify that Defendants have done so and \nmay declare that the Implementation Target or Target Outcome is no longer subject to \nmonitoring in the Co-Neutrals’ reports.  Once an Implementation Target or Target Outcome is no \nlonger subject to monitoring, it is severable from the rest of the Agreement for the purposes of \ndetermining expiration of the Agreement.   \n \nIX.  DISPUTE RESOLUTION \n  A. Alternative Dispute Resolution and Arbitration.  Any dispute arising out of or \nrelated to this Agreement shall be subject to the following process:   \n \nStep 1 – Alternative Dispute Resolution:  At any time following the execution of this \nAgreement, any Party or Parties may notify the other Parties that they are initiating the \nalternative dispute resolution process by providing written notice of the issue in dispute, the \ninitiating Party’s position on that dispute, and their choice to initiate the dispute resolution \nprocess to all other Parties and to the Co-Neutrals.  The Co-Neutrals shall attempt to resolve the \ndispute through mediation within 30 Days of the initiation of the dispute.  The Parties shall use \ngood-faith, best efforts to discuss and resolve the dispute.   \n \nFor any dispute over whether the Defendants have met the Performance Standard for an \nImplementation Target or Target Outcome by the agreed-upon deadline, the Co-Neutrals and the \nParties shall attempt to agree on a corrective action plan through mediation.  No Party shall \ninitiate the arbitration process in Step 2 until the time for Defendants to complete any corrective \naction plan has expired. \n \nStep 2– Arbitration: After the Parties have completed the alternative dispute resolution process \nset forth in Step 1 and any time to resolve the disputed issue through a corrective action plan has \nelapsed, any Party may initiate binding arbitration.  A Party may not initiate arbitration without \nhaving completed the alternative dispute resolution process set forth in Step 1.  The Parties \nintend arbitration to be the exclusive means for resolving any disputes arising out of or related to \nthis Agreement that cannot be resolved through the alternative dispute resolution process set \nforth in Step 1.  To the maximum extent allowed by law, the Parties hereby voluntarily and \nknowingly waive their rights to bring a dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement in \ncourt.   \n \n  1.  Arbitration Procedure:  A Party may initiate arbitration by providing written \nnotice to the other Parties of their choice to do so no less than 14 Days from the completion of \nthe mediation or the expiration of the corrective action plan, whichever is longer.  The Parties \nappoint Hon. James Hall (Ret.) as the arbitrator for any disputes arising under this provision.  In \nthe event that Hon. James Hall is unavailable to serve in this role or becomes unable to serve in \nthis role during the term of this Agreement, the Parties agree to appoint a new arbitrator to serve \nin his place. \n \n42822446.1   \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 10 \n\n \n    a.  Briefing:  Within 14 Days of the initiating Party’s provision of written \nnotice, the Parties shall file simultaneous opening briefs.  Within 14 Days of the filing of the \nopening briefs, the Parties shall file simultaneous rebuttal briefs.  No reply briefs by any Party \nshall be permitted. \n \n    b.  Hearing:  Subject to the arbitrator’s availability, the arbitrator will hold a \nhearing on the issues in dispute within 7 business days after the filing of rebuttal briefs.  If the \narbitrator is not available within 7 business days, then the hearing shall take place at the \narbitrator’s earliest convenience.  The Co-Neutrals shall not be called as witnesses in the \narbitration but their reports may be submitted as evidence.  \n \n    c.  Decision:  The arbitrator shall render a reasoned decision within 14 Days \nafter the hearing or at the arbitrator’s earliest convenience thereafter.  The arbitrator’s decision \nshall be final and non-appealable except on grounds set forth in the AAA’s Commercial \nArbitration Procedures.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to award any relief necessary to \neffectuate the purpose of this Agreement, including all types of relief, other than monetary \ndamages, that a state or federal court in New Mexico could issue, such as specific performance, \ninjunctive relief, declaratory relief, and reasonable non-monetary sanctions.  If Plaintiffs are the \nprevailing party, the arbitrator, in his discretion, may allow Plaintiffs reasonable attorneys’ fees \nand costs. \n \n    d.  Post-Arbitration Relief:  If the Party against whom the arbitrator rules \nfails to comply with the arbitrator’s ruling in the time set forth in the arbitrator’s decision, the \nprevailing party may confirm and enforce the arbitrator’s award pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. § \n44-7A-23.   \n \n  e.  Other Matters:  The Parties’ arbitration briefs, as well as the arbitrator’s \ndecision, shall be public. The arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by Defendants.  \n \n \nX. DISMISSAL AND NON-RELEASED CLAIMS  \nA. Dismissal: Within 30 Days of the execution of this Agreement by the Parties, \nPlaintiffs shall promptly and voluntarily dismiss with prejudice all causes of action and claims \nalleged in the Kevin S. litigation.  \nB. No Release of Claims for Money Damages: Because the Kevin S. case was limited to \nclaims for injunctive and declaratory relief and for recovery of attorneys’ fees and costs, nothing \nin this Agreement shall be deemed a release, settlement, or waiver of claims by the Plaintiffs or \nmembers of the Proposed Class for money damages against Defendants.   \nC.  No Release of Future Claims: Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed a release, \nsettlement, or waiver of claims by the named Plaintiffs or members of the Proposed Class related \nto or arising out of acts or omissions by Defendants after the Effective Date of this Agreement. \nD.  No Limitation on DRNM and NADLC’s Duties Under Federal Law:  Nothing in \nthis Agreement shall be deemed to limit DRNM and NADLC’s ability to fulfill their duties or \nroles under the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness (“PAIMI”) Act, 42 \n42822446.1   \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 11 \n\n \nU.S.C. § 10801, et. seq., and the regulations promulgated thereto, 42 C.F.R. § 51, et seq., and the \nDevelopmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights (“DD”) Act, 42 U.S.C. § 15041, et \nseq., and the regulations promulgated thereto, 45 C.F.R. § 1386 et seq. \n \nXI.  ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS  \n  Within 90 Days of the Effective Date of this Agreement, Defendants shall pay $2,400,000 in \nPlaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees and costs in consideration for Plaintiffs’ role in initiating the Kevin S. \nlitigation and implementing this Agreement. Plaintiffs may also receive attorneys’ fees and costs \nin connection with arbitration proceedings, as described in Section IX.  Defendants shall be \nresponsible for the payment of their own attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in the litigation and \nnegotiation of this Agreement.    \n \nXII.  OTHER PROVISIONS  \nA.  Choice of Law: This Agreement shall be interpreted under the laws of the State of \nNew Mexico without regard to that State’s choice of law principles. \nB. Authority to Execute: The signatories to this Agreement represent and warrant that \nthey have the full authority to execute this Agreement on behalf of, and to bind, any person \nwhom they represent. \nC.

A trauma-\nresponsive system includes culturally appropriate services and supports.  A trauma-responsive \nsystem of care should utilize collaborative decision-making to identify strengths and needs and \nto develop an individualized plan for the child.  Children should have a voice in decisions about \nwhere and with whom they should live and what services they should receive, and these \ndecisions should occur in a timely manner.  Accurate, complete, and relevant evidence-based \nquality management tools and measures are necessary for the State to implement and refine a \ntrauma-responsive system of care.  The Co-Neutrals will assess whether Defendants have met the \nPerformance Standard with respect to the commitments in this Appendix. \nIMPLEMENTATION TARGETS \nBy December 1, 2020, CYFD and HSD will take the following specific steps necessary to create \nan effective trauma-responsive system of care for Children in State Custody. \n1.  CYFD, with input and collaboration from HSD, will establish Child and Adolescent Needs and \nStrengths (“CANS”) and functional trauma assessment criteria for access to intensive home-\nbased services in consultation with clinical experts agreed upon by Defendants and Plaintiffs.  \nThe criteria will aim to help CYFD, stakeholders, and providers identify children and youth \nfor whom intensive home-based services are medically necessary and will include but not be \nlimited to consideration of Serious Emotional Disturbance (“SED”) criteria, CANS, and \nfunctional trauma assessment screening.  CYFD and HSD will revise SED criteria to clarify \nthat removal from home is not a requirement to access these services. \n \n2.  Trauma-Responsive Training and Coaching Plan.  CYFD and HSD will create a cross-\ndepartmental Trauma-Responsive Training and Coaching Plan that describes in writing a plan \nand process for providing mandatory, high-quality trauma-responsive training to all CYFD \nemployees,  Designated  HSD  Employees1  and  employees  of  child-serving  agencies  that \ncontract with CYFD or HSD to provide care to Children in State Custody.  Training will \naddress the impact of trauma including its neurodevelopmental effects, implementing and \naccessing trauma-responsive supports and services, and secondary trauma.  Training will \n                                                           \n1 “Designated HSD Employees” refers to (1) Social and Community Services Coordinators, their \nsupervisors and managers, including the Behavioral Health Services Division Director; and (2) \nany HSD employee or their designee involved in care coordination activities, EPSDT services, or \ndeterminations about service utilization for Children in State Custody, including supervisory and \nmanagement level employees. \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 1a \n \n\ncomply with professional standards and best practices in adult education, including by being \ncase-based and interactive, and including an assessment component to measure effectiveness.  \nTrauma-responsive training will consist of initial or pre-service training as well as consistent, \nongoing in-service training, mentoring, coaching, and support.  The Trauma-Responsive \nTraining and Coaching Plan will also provide for mandatory trauma-responsive training for \nResource Families and optional trauma-responsive training for Respondents. Training for \nResource Families and Respondents will be accessible both online and in person, and CYFD \nwill provide childcare during any in-person sessions if needed.  Notice of training shall be \nprovided to Resource Families and Respondents reasonably in advance of any scheduled \ntraining, and no less than 14 Days in advance of any scheduled training. Notices will state that \nchildcare will be provided and that requests for childcare must be received 48 hours prior to \nthe training, or a lesser number of hours determined by CYFD and/or HSD.  The written plan \nwill include identification of the training program or materials to be used and the number of \nhours of training to be received by each category of trainee.  The trauma-responsive training \nand coaching described in the plan must be sufficient to allow the Departments to meet their \nobligations under this Agreement.  The Co-Neutrals must approve the Trauma-Responsive \nTraining and Coaching Plan. \nTARGET OUTCOMES \n1.  Screening. By December 1, 2021, every Child in State Custody will receive the screenings \nindicated below.  CYFD and HSD will identify, and Co-Neutrals must approve, the form of \nthe Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths Crisis Assessment Tool (“CANS-CAT”) and \ncomprehensive CANS screening tools to be used.  CYFD will ensure that every Child in State \nCustody  receives  the  indicated  screenings  and  will  provide  the  results  of  the  indicated \nscreenings to HSD (through its MCOs and/or their successors).  HSD will ensure that MCOs \nand/or their successors have capacity to provide indicated screenings. \na.  Results of initial screening using the CANS-CAT will be filed with the court no less \nthan 24 hours before the child’s 10-day hearing.  If this deadline falls on a weekend or \nholiday, the screening results must be filed no less than one business day prior to the \n10-day hearing. \nb.  Comprehensive screening using a CANS-Trauma Comprehensive instrument or a \ncomprehensive CANS assessment instrument with a trauma module will be conducted \nwithin 45 Days of removal from the home.  Any child discharged from CYFD’s legal \ncustody before these screenings are conducted will be provided a referral for the \nscreenings. \nc.  Follow  up  screening  indicated  by  the  CANS-CAT,  CANS,  and/or  any  other \ninformation available to CYFD or HSD, including screening for intellectual and \ndevelopmental disabilities and/or sexual exploitation, will be conducted immediately \nwhere possible and within 10 Days of indication otherwise.  Any child discharged from \nCYFD’s legal custody before these screenings are conducted will be provided a referral \nfor them. \n \n2.  Services.  By December 1, 2022, every Child in State Custody will receive age-appropriate \ntrauma-responsive services, supports, and/or treatment to meet his or her individualized \nneeds indicated by the CANS and functional trauma assessments, beginning immediately \nwhere possible and not to exceed 10 Days after the date of the screening and/or assessment.  \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 2a \n \n\nHSD and CYFD will work with MCOs and other entities designated to provide care \ncoordination to make sure medically necessary services are provided, documented in the \nchild’s file, and analyzed when developing plans for future care and services.  HSD and \nCYFD will expand and offer community-based, evidence-based, well-supported, and \npromising trauma-responsive services, which include mobile crisis response services, \nintensive case management, intensive home-based services, and trauma-based therapies \nincluding Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Multi-Systemic Therapy (MST), trauma-\ninformed Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Functional Family Training (FFT), and Eye \nMovement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy (EMDR).  These services will be \navailable to all Children in State Custody for whom the services are medically necessary and \nwill be available immediately where possible and within 10 Days of the determination of \nmedical necessity otherwise.   \n \n3.  Training \na.  By December 1, 2021, all CYFD employees, designated HSD employees, employees \nof child serving agencies that contract with CYFD or HSD to provide care to Children \nin State Custody, and Resource Families will receive the training identified in the \nTrauma-Responsive Training and Coaching Plan.  All Respondents will be offered the \ntrauma training identified in the Trauma-Responsive Training and Coaching Plan. \nb.  By  December  1,  2021,  all  CYFD  employees,  designated  HSD  employees,  and \nemployees of child serving agencies that contract with CYFD or HSD who provide \ncare to Children in State Custody will demonstrate through competency assessments \nand self-reporting that they have received adequate trauma-responsive training. \n \n4.  Individualized Planning Meetings. Subject to the approval of the Co-Neutrals, CYFD and \nHSD will develop and implement a process (the Individualized Planning Meeting Plan) for \nconvening an Individualized Planning Meeting team for making decisions and for delivering \nservices and supports for each Child in State Custody.  The Individualized Planning Meeting \nprocess shall be informed by Child and Family Teaming (CFT), collaborative decision-making, \nand High Fidelity Wraparound models, and shall prioritize the child’s voice and choice.  The \nprocess shall also be strengths-based, connected to natural supports, and respectful of the \nchild’s family and unique cultural heritage.  The Co-Neutrals shall not withhold approval of \nthe Individualized Planning Meeting Plan if it is reasonably calculated to achieve the Goals of \nthis Agreement.  The Individualized Planning Meeting Plan will be completed and approved \nby December 1, 2020, and fully implemented by December 1, 2022. \n \n5.  Quality Assurance, Improvement, and Evaluation.  CYFD and HSD  will create and \nimplement  a  Quality  Assurance,  Improvement,  and  Evaluation  Plan,  including  quality \nmanagement tools and measures to be used for reporting on CYFD and HSD’s capacity to meet \nthe needs of Children in State Custody, including measures for reporting on providing and \nimproving quality of care, collaborating across Departments, and for providing transparency \nand accountability.  The Plan will include: consistent definitions and terms across CYFD and \nHSD, data exchange and matching across CYFD and HSD, clarification of existing measures \nand indicators, self-assessments, metrics as indicators of system performance (including \nprocess indicators, client outcomes, and system impact), a continuous quality improvement \nprocess that provides information in real time to decision-makers, and a process for responding \nto findings from the Plan.  CYFD will develop a meaningful quality assurance process to ensure \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 3a \n \n\nthat  training,  policy,  and  procedure  is  being  properly  utilized  and  integrated  into  daily \nprocesses.    The  Co-Neutrals  must  approve  the  Quality  Assurance,  Improvement,  and \nEvaluation Plan.  CYFD and HSD will develop the Quality Assurance, Improvement, and \nEvaluation Plan by December 1, 2020 and fully implement it by December 1, 2021. \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 4a \n \n\nAPPENDIX B: LEAST RESTRICTIVE AND APPROPRIATE PLACEMENTS \n \nWhen assessing CYFD’s and HSD’s efforts to implement the commitments in this Appendix, the \nCo-Neutrals will consider, in addition to other data and information, the extent to which CYFD \nand HSD build a system for placing children in out-of-home care in stable, safe, appropriate, \ncommunity-based placements in the least-restrictive environment.  Children in out-of-home care \nshould have caregivers who understand their strengths and needs and are able to support them to \ngrow and heal.  Children in out-of-home placements should be in the least restrictive, most \nconnected, most family-like setting appropriate for their unique needs.  Children aged 14 and \nolder should be consulted on their express placement preferences.  Children in out-of-home \nplacements should have stable placements that meet their needs and should be protected from the \nharm caused by multiple placement moves.  Foster care should be as temporary an arrangement \nas possible, with its goal being to provide children in out-of-home placements a safe, nurturing, \nand permanent home quickly.  The Co-Neutrals will assess whether Defendants have met the \nPerformance Standard with respect to the commitments in this Appendix. \n \nIMPLEMENTATION TARGETS \n \nBy December 1, 2020, HSD and CYFD will take the following specific steps: \n \n1.  CYFD and HSD will develop a plan to (1) increase recruitment and retention of culturally \nreflective, community-based placements, with a focus on maximizing family supports and \nserving rural areas and difficult-to-place populations and (2) ensure that children in out-of-\nhome care remain in stable placement and educational settings to the maximum extent feasible \nand that any change in placement is made in the best interests of the child and consistent with \nachieving the child’s permanency goals. \n \n2.  CYFD will publish guidance prohibiting retaliation against any person, including foster \nparents, for raising concerns related to the unmet needs of Children in State Custody or their \ncaregivers.  \n \n3.  CYFD and HSD will develop and promote a warm line for Resource Families and \nRespondents who need assistance meeting the behavioral needs of the children in their \ncare.  CYFD will promote its internal Grievance Procedure for youth. CYFD will also \ndevelop a Grievance Procedure for Resource Families. \n \nTARGET OUTCOMES \n \n1.  By December 1, 2020, no child under 18 will be placed in any hotel, motel, out-of-state \nprovider, office of a contractor, or state agency office unless in extraordinary circumstances \nnecessary to protect the safety and security of the child as documented in the child’s record \nand approved by the Secretary or the Protective Services Director of CYFD.  In any such \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 5a \n \n \n \n\nextraordinary circumstance, CYFD shall provide notice to the child’s Guardian ad Litem and \nYouth Attorney immediately where possible, and not more than 24 hours after the placement \nof the child.  Notification to the dependency court to which the child’s case is assigned must \noccur within 3 business days.  When a child is placed with an out-of-state provider, notice to \nthe child’s Guardian ad Litem, Youth Attorney, and the dependency court to which the child’s \ncase is assigned will be given prior to the move, pursuant to statute.  \n \n2.  By December 1, 2020, HSD and CYFD will conduct a joint clinical review of any out-of-state \nplacement, where the child’s out-of-state placement is not the child’s permanency plan, at least \non a monthly basis.  A CYFD caseworker known to the child will conduct in-person visits \nevery month.  Within the first 30 Days of the placement, the out-of-state Individualized \nPlanning Meeting team will develop a discharge plan which includes identification of in-state \nresources that need to be developed for the child to return to New Mexico.  The CYFD \ncaseworker will do so by working with HSD or its designee to secure services that could be \nfunded  by  Medicaid.    Individualized  Planning  Meetings,  which  may  take  place  during \nscheduled treatment team meetings for children in residential care, will be held every 30 Days \nto support the child and identify steps necessary to promote discharge.  \n \n3.  By December 1, 2021, for any child placed in a congregate care setting due to a medical \nnecessity determination that the child requires residential treatment, the finding of medical \nnecessity will be clinically reviewed every 30 Days, or more frequently as needed.  The finding \nof medical necessity must take into consideration whether community-based mental health \nservices have been or could be provided.  Individualized Planning Meetings will be held every \n30 Days to support the child and identify steps necessary to promote discharge.   \n \n4.  By December 1, 2021, any placement in a congregate care setting that is not supported by a \ndetermination of medical necessity, including placement in specialized group homes such as \nTransitional Living Placements, Maternity Group Homes, or settings for Commercial Sexual \nExploitation of Children, must be supported by a determination of the Individualized Planning \nMeeting team, including a mental health professional, that it is in the best interests of the child.  \nThe best interest determination will be reviewed by the Individualized Planning Meeting team, \nincluding a mental health professional, every 90 Days, or more frequently as needed.  If \nextraordinary circumstances require placement of a child in a shelter, CYFD will conduct an \nIndividualized Planning Team meeting within 48 hours to identify an appropriate placement \nto which to move the child and any medically necessary services needed by the child, and will \nnotify the child’s legal representative of the result of the review.     \n \n5.  By December 1, 2021, every child in out-of-home care will be in a licensed foster home \nplacement unless a current finding of medical necessity requires otherwise or an Individualized \nPlanning Meeting team determines that a non-clinical setting is in the child’s best interest. The \nfinding of medical necessity for a more restrictive setting (residential treatment or Qualified \nResidential Treatment Programs) will be reviewed every 30 Days or more frequently as needed \nand will take into consideration whether community-based mental health services and supports \nhave been or could be provided.   \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 6a \n \n \n \n\n6.  Beginning on December 1, 2020, and on an annual basis by December 31 each year thereafter, \nthe Co-Neutrals will approve a Target Outcome for CYFD to approve a specified number of \nnew culturally reflective foster homes during the following year, and for HSD to approve a \nspecified number of new treatment foster care placements during the following year. \n \n7.  By December 1, 2022, at least 40% of children in out-of-home care will be placed with kin.  \nCYFD will use Seneca Family Finding software to attempt to identify and locate family \nmembers for every Child in State Custody within 48 hours of entering state custody.  \n \n8.  By December 1, 2022, for children under 18 in out-of-home care, the rate of moves from a \nplacement  setting  shall  not  exceed  3  moves  per  1,000  Days  in  care.    The  educational \nconsequences  of  a  change  in  placement  must  be  considered  in  all  placement  change \ndeterminations and must be discussed at Individualized Planning Meetings.  Any change in \nplacement that impacts the child’s education must be accompanied by a written plan to ensure \ncontinuity in the child’s education, including transportation and educational supports to \nminimize the impact of the transition.   \n \n9.  Of all children in care for 12-23 months at the start of a 12-month period, 40% will achieve \npermanency (reunification, adoption, or permanent guardianship) within 12 months of the \nstart of that period by December 2023.   \n \n10. CYFD Workforce Development Plan.  CYFD will create a CYFD Workforce Development \nPlan that will ensure CYFD’s workforce has adequate qualifications, expertise, skills, and \nnumbers of personnel.  The CYFD Workforce Development Plan will describe in writing the \nexpected  nature,  scope,  capacity,  and  structure  of  the  workforce  necessary  to  meet  the \nobligations described in this Agreement.  The plan will include a specific hiring plan that \nidentifies, by county, the number of staff, credentials, and training required to meet the \nobjectives identified in the CYFD Workforce Development Plan and outlines strategies to \nrecruit and retain staff. The Plan will require that all caseworkers and supervisors have \nsufficient educational credentials and/or directly relevant experience.  It will require that \nCYFD have a sufficient number of caseworkers to ensure that no caseworker will carry a case \nload of greater than the current professional standard identified by the Child Welfare League \nof America (CWLA).  It will also include sufficient numbers of staff trained and able to \nimplement ICWA guidelines using culturally responsive practices.  The Plan will describe \nspecific  strategies  to  attract  and  retain  diverse,  high-quality  staff  with  appropriate \nqualifications and skills.  Co-Neutrals must approve the CYFD Workforce Development Plan.  \nCYFD  will  develop  the  Workforce  Development  Plan  by  December  1,  2020  and  fully \nimplement it by December 1, 2021. \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 7a \n \n \n \n\nAPPENDIX C: INDIAN CHILD WELFARE ACT \n \nWhen assessing CYFD’s and HSD’s efforts to implement the commitments in this Appendix, the \nCo-Neutrals will consider, in addition to other data and information, the extent to which CYFD \nand HSD serve Native American families, build a relationship with each of the New Mexico \nTribes and Pueblos, and comply with the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) in its letter and \nintent.  The State has an obligation to comply with ICWA and shall make every effort to ensure \nthat all Native Children and families receive appropriate support and services.  The Co-Neutrals \nwill assess whether Defendants have met the Performance Standard with respect to the \ncommitments in this Appendix. \n \nIMPLEMENTATION TARGETS \n \nBy December 1, 2020, HSD and CYFD will take the following specific steps necessary to create \na culturally responsive system of support for Native Children in State Custody: \n \n1.  CYFD and HSD will work with the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) and with \nNew Mexico Tribes and Pueblos to draft a State ICWA law that mirrors and expands upon \nthe federal version.  The drafting committee will include representatives of New Mexico \nTribes and Pueblos, representatives of Native Children, Native parents, and other caregivers \ninvolved in the child welfare system, experts on the federal ICWA, and providers of \nculturally relevant services and supports.  The drafting committee will have discretion to \ndetermine the content of the law and will consider definitions of “active efforts,” “qualified \nexpert witness,” including qualifications of for determining a “qualified expert witness,” and \ndevelopment of a pool of potential expert witnesses.  HSD and CYFD will identify and \narrange for an appropriate facilitator such as the New Mexico Department of Indian Affairs \nto convene the drafting committee to assist in drafting the law.  CYFD and HSD will actively \npromote passage of the law, including by making a positive recommendation of the bill to the \nGovernor’s Office with appropriate justification. \n \n2.  With the input of New Mexico’s Tribes and Pueblos, CYFD and HSD will develop processes \nand procedures to promote traditional interventions as first-line interventions and services, \nusing an assessment tool for Native Children in State Custody, modifications of existing \nassessment tools, or other means recommended by Native experts.  The form of the \nassessment tool or other means shall be approved by the Co-Neutrals, but the Co-Neutrals \nshall not withhold approval of the assessment tool if it is reasonably calculated to achieve the \nGoals of this Agreement.    \n \n3.  HSD and CYFD will pursue federal funding to the maximum extent allowable through \nMedicaid and IV-E funding for traditional and culturally responsive treatments, \ninterventions, and supports, including non-medicalized interventions, for Native Children in \nState Custody. \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 8a \n\n4.  CYFD will maintain a full-time employee responsible for developing and maximizing \nculturally responsive services for Native Children in State Custody and for coordinating and \noverseeing provision of culturally responsive services to Native Children in State Custody by \nlocal staff throughout the state. \n \n5.  CYFD will develop a plan to increase recruitment and retention of Native Resource Families. \nThe plan will include identifying relatives of Native Children, as required by ICWA or the \nNew Mexico Tribe or Pueblo’s preferred placement priorities, as well as identifying other \npotential Native Resource Families.  The plan will include identification of additional \nsupports needed for Native Resource Families, including supports and services that are \nculturally responsive and are not the same as those provided to non-Native parents, as well as \nproviding assistance for families to navigate Resource Family licensing requirements.  One \nmethodology for identifying additional needed supports will be surveying former Native \nResource Families to determine why they have stopped serving as a Resource Family and \nsurveying potential Native Resource Families that did not complete the process to determine \nwhy they chose not to become a Resource Family.   \n \n6.  CYFD will work with New Mexico Tribes and Pueblos to engage in dialogue, develop \nagreements, and take any other steps necessary to help New Mexico Tribes and Pueblos \nbetter access IV-E funding to improve services for Native Children, including additional \nfunding for legal representation for New Mexico Tribes and Pueblos and Respondents. \n \n7.  CYFD and HSD will collect and analyze data sufficient to understand the characteristics and \nneeds of Native Children in State Custody and the capabilities of the State to meet those \nneeds.  The data to be collected will include (1) data about Native Children in State Custody, \nincluding tribal membership status, confirmation and correction of birth certificates, removal \nrates, and placements (including whether children are placed with relative, non-relative \nNative, or non-relative non-Native Resource Families, Treatment Foster Care, congregate \ncare, residential placement, or other out of home placement); (2) data on the demographics \nand characteristics of placements available to Native children (including Resource Families); \nand (3) data on the demographics, characteristics and services provided by treatment \nproviders available to Native Children in State Custody.  \n \n8.  CYFD and HSD will create and maintain a dedicated ICWA unit in the 2nd Judicial District \nthat includes dedicated and specially trained caseworkers, supervisors, and children’s court \nattorneys who will specialize in ICWA and act as consultants and trainers on ICWA cases. \nCYFD will work with the AOC to implement lessons learned from the ICWA unit and court \nin the 2nd Judicial District throughout the State.   \n  \nTARGET OUTCOMES \n1.  By December 1, 2021, assessments using the tool developed for Native Children in State \nCustody or other process developed per Implementation Target 2 above will be conducted \nwithin 30 Days of CYFD filing a petition for custody of a Native Child in State Custody.   \n \n2.  CYFD will work with New Mexico Tribes and Pueblos, families, and Native Children to \nidentify culturally responsive services.  HSD will develop and expand access to traditional \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 9a \n\nand culturally responsive treatments, interventions, and supports.  CYFD will develop and \narrange for traditional and culturally competent interventions, which may include \ninterventions that are not medicalized and/or have not been evaluated as evidence-based, \nwell-supported, or promising.  CYFD and HSD will expand culturally relevant services that \ncan be used as an active effort to keep families intact and to avoid taking children into \ncustody.  \na.  By December 1, 2022, Individualized Planning Meetings for every Native Child in \nState Custody will address the need for traditional or culturally responsive services, \nsupports, or interventions, including non-medicalized interventions, to meet his or her \nindividualized needs as indicated by his or her assessments.  \nb.  While a family can decline CYFD’s assistance, CYFD recognizes that it has the \nresponsibility to coordinate services and ensure they are provided; \nc.  When appropriate traditional or culturally responsive services, supports or \ninterventions, including non-medicalized interventions, are identified, they will be \nprovided immediately where possible and not to exceed 10 Days after the date of \nidentifying the need, unless a longer period is necessary due to cultural traditions, \nnorms, or factors outside of CYFD’s control.  \nd.  If there is a basis for delaying the intervention as outlined under subpart c above, then \nit will be identified and communicated in writing to the Individualized Planning team \nand reviewed at subsequent meetings. \ne.  If the intervention requires involvement from the tribe or tribal community, CYFD \nwill identify the nature of the community’s involvement and the reason for any delay \nin provision of the intervention, if any, for the Individualized Planning team and it \nwill be reviewed at subsequent meetings. \n \nCYFD will make every effort to ensure that services are provided as quickly as possible with \nconsideration of the traditions and culture of the Native Child’s tribe or pueblo, as well as \nchild and family preferences. \n \nBy December 1, 2020, CYFD will develop policies to ensure that Native Children in State \nCustody receive traditional or culturally responsive services, supports, or interventions, \nincluding interventions which are non-medicalized and/or have not been evaluated as \nevidence-based, well-supported, or promising, including collecting data on the \nimplementation of the protocols.  The Co-Neutrals will approve the policies and evaluate the \nDepartment’s compliance with the policy.  The Co-Neutrals shall not withhold approval of \nthe policy if it is reasonably calculated to achieve the Goals of this Agreement.   \n \n3.  By December 1, 2020, CYFD will develop a policy to provide or ensure provision of direct \nassistance for traditional ceremonies, including arranging for all preparation and providing \npayment if needed, if Native Children want to participate. The policy will 1) provide for \nNative Children in State Custody to be presented with information about traditional \nceremonies with sufficient time to decide whether they want to participate, 2) affirmatively \nencourage participation, and 3) facilitate all necessary preparation activities.  The Co-\nNeutrals will approve the policy and evaluate the Department’s compliance with the policy.  \nThe Co-Neutrals shall not withhold approval of the policy if it is reasonably calculated to \nachieve the Goals of this Agreement.   \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 10a \n\n \n4.  CYFD is committed to having Native Children in ICWA-preferred placements.  By \nDecember 1, 2020, when a Native Child is in a non-ICWA-preferred placement, the  \nplacement will be reviewed every 30 Days.  CYFD will establish protocols governing the 30-\nDay review process to include families, tribal representatives, legal representatives, and \nResource Families. The protocols will require that the aim of the placement review will be to \ndetermine what actions, services and supports will enable the child to be moved to an ICWA-\napproved placement. If State ICWA legislation is passed and is more protective than the \nfederal ICWA, a placement may meet this standard by being preferred by or consistent with \nthe State ICWA legislation. The Co-Neutrals shall approve the protocols, but the Co-Neutrals \nshall not withhold approval of the protocols if they are reasonably calculated to achieve the \nGoals of this Agreement.  The Co-Neutrals will evaluate compliance with the protocols.  \nCYFD will work with New Mexico Tribes and Pueblos to identify any tribal placement \npreferences that deviate from ICWA.  CYFD will create procedures that enhance \naccountability for ICWA placement preferences, including allowing the child’s tribe or \npueblo and extended family members to participate in ICWA-preferred placement reviews, \nIndividualized Planning Meetings and case decision making meetings.    \n \n5.  Training. CYFD will develop an ICWA training plan by December 1, 2020, and implement \nit by December 1, 2021.  ICWA trainings will be developed collaboratively with the CYFD’s \nAcademy for Training and Professional Development Team, Protective Services Tribal \nLiaison, CYFD Tribal Liaison, Tribal Advisors, and culturally responsive experts.  The \nICWA training will include specific information on the history of ICWA, historic relations \nbetween Native American people and state and national government, and the history of \nculturally insensitive social work practices.  It will also include skills development in \nworking with Native families and communities, historical trauma, engagement, cultural \nhumility and culturally responsive intervention techniques for Native American parents and \nyouth and community engagement with New Mexico Tribes and Pueblos, as well as best \npractices for ICWA.  The training will include information on New Mexico Tribes and \nPueblos, sovereignty, and jurisdictional issues.  The Co-Neutrals shall approve the ICWA \ntraining plan, but the Co-Neutrals shall not withhold approval of the training plan if it is \nreasonably calculated to achieve the Goals of this Agreement.  The Co-Neutrals will evaluate \nimplementation of the training plan. \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 11a \n\nAPPENDIX D: BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES \n \nWhen assessing CYFD’s and HSD’s efforts to implement the commitments in this Appendix, \nthe Co-Neutrals will consider, in addition to other data and information, the extent to which \nCYFD and HSD structure and build a statewide, community-based mental health system that all \nchildren and families will be able to access.  A statewide system is necessary to ensure that \nChildren in State Custody and their families have prompt access to necessary services \nregardless of where they live.  These services are critical to keeping children with their families \nor in the most family-like setting possible.  This system will include a diverse and full spectrum \nof community-based services, will decrease reliance on congregate care, keep families together \nin their community to the maximum extent possible, and greatly reduce reliance on out of state \nresidential placements.  Medically necessary mental health services will be provided, in \ndescending order of preference: at home, in a family setting, or in the most home-like setting \nappropriate to a child’s needs and consistent with the Children’s Code.  The Co-Neutrals will \nassess whether Defendants have met the Performance Standard with respect to the commitments \nin this Appendix.  \n \nIMPLEMENTATION TARGETS \n \nBy December 1, 2020, HSD and CYFD will take the following specific steps necessary to create \nan effective system for delivery of community-based mental and behavioral health services—\nincluding  screening/assessment,  High  Fidelity  Wraparound  services,1  evidence-based,  well-\nsupported, or promising therapeutic treatment for children with complex trauma, intensive case \nmanagement, mobile crisis response services and intensive home-based services—to Children in \nState Custody. \n \n1.  Behavioral Health Care Workforce Development Review.  HSD and CYFD will create a \nBehavioral Health Care Workforce Development Review with the objective of supporting and \nexpanding provider capacity to provide community-based mental and behavioral health \nservices with reasonable promptness that are accessible throughout the State, and particularly \nin rural areas.  The Behavioral Health Care Workforce Development Review will describe in \nwriting the expected nature, scope, capacity, and structure of the workforce necessary to meet \nthe obligations described in this Agreement, including how HSD works with MCOs on \nincreasing  capacity  to  make  available  screening/assessment,  High  Fidelity  Wraparound \nservices, evidence-based, well-supported, or promising therapeutic treatment for children \nwith  complex  trauma,  intensive  case  management,  mobile  crisis  response  services  and \nintensive home-based services to every Child in State Custody for whom they are medically \nnecessary.  HSD will either create or require MCOs to create a specific hiring/contracting plan \nthat identifies, by county, the number of staff and credentials required to meet the objectives \nidentified in the Behavioral Health Care Workforce Development Review.  The Co-Neutrals \nmust approve the Behavioral Health Care Workforce Development Review. \n                                                           \n1 High Fidelity Wraparound services are a critical component in a well-functioning system of \ncare, ensuring children and youth with complex behavioral health needs receive care that is \nindividualized, family and youth driven, strengths-based, culturally competent, and coordinated \nacross systems, particularly for children and youth who are at risk for out of home placements.  \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 12a \n\n \n2.  To  assess  need,  HSD  and  CYFD  will  define  initial  expected  service  utilization  for \nscreening/assessment, High Fidelity Wraparound services, evidence-based, well-supported, \nor  promising  therapeutic  treatment  for  children  with  complex  trauma,  intensive  case \nmanagement, mobile crisis response services and intensive home-based services. The Co-\nNeutrals must approve the methodology for predicting expected utilization of these services. \n \n3.  HSD will develop and publish reimbursement methodology, billing rates (taking into account \nvalidated  information  regarding  adequate  rates),  and  guidance  for  providers  for \nscreening/assessment, High Fidelity Wraparound services, evidence-based, well-supported, \nor  promising  therapeutic  treatment  for  children  with  complex  trauma,  intensive  case \nmanagement, mobile crisis response services and intensive home-based services, leveraging \nMedicaid whenever possible. The methodology and guidance will include provider eligibility \ncriteria as well as billing and coding procedures. \n \n4.  CYFD, with input from HSD, will adopt regulations governing medication protocols to ensure \nthat Children in State Custody are not overmedicated, while ensuring timely access to \nmedically necessary medication and treatment. The regulations will include a mandatory \nclinical review process provided by an independent mental health professional with a license \nto prescribe psychotropic medication for all children prescribed psychotropic medication \nwhile in state custody and will include guidance aimed to ensure that medication is not \nmisused as a primary response to trauma-related behaviors.  In addition, the regulations will \nrequire specific review of: 1) any use of polypharmacology; 2) dosage for all prescribed \nmedication; and 3) use of atypical anti-psychotics.  Co-Neutrals must approve the final form \nof these regulations.   \n \n5.  HSD will monitor implementation of a term in all contracts with its designees to require that \ncare coordination include identification of physical, behavioral health, and long-term care \nneeds, and providing services to address said needs, in compliance with Section 4.4 of \nCentennial Care 2.0 Managed Care Organization contracts with HSD. \n \n6.  HSD will reinstate language in its Medicaid contracts to prevent children from being rejected \nor removed from behavioral health services providers. HSD will work with providers to \nidentify and remove other administrative barriers to providing services.  \n \n7.  HSD will revise its Notice of Action and grievance protocols to require a Notice of Action be \nprovided to the child’s caregiver, legal representative, and legal custodian whenever a service \nrecommended by an Individualized Planning Meeting Team is reduced, modified, delayed, or \ndenied, or if the service or is not approved within 10 Days.    \n \n8.  HSD and CYFD will review and identify the responsibilities shared by both Departments and \ncreate a joint process for offering services and supports include screening, assessing, referring, \ntreating and providing transition services to Children in State Custody of the department, \nincluding Children in State Custody who were never removed from Respondents’ homes or \nchildren who have returned to Respondents’ homes but who remain Children in State Custody.  \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 13a \n\nThe goal of this joint process shall be to maximize each child’s access to services and to create \nunified process for offering services and supports. \n \n9.  HSD or its designees will require training through its contracts for those providing care \ncoordination  for  children  in  state  custody  who  receive  Medicaid,  consistent  with  the \nrequirements in place under Section 3.3.5 and 4.4 of the Centennial Care 2.0 MCO contracts \nwith HSD.  HSD will require this training in any and all future contracts with its designees. \n \nTARGET OUTCOMES \n \n1.  Workforce Development. HSD will work with MCOs to implement the Behavioral Health \nCare Workforce Development Review, with the objective of expanding and developing the \nstatewide workforce sufficient to implement the system for delivery of community-based \nmental and behavioral health services described in this Agreement.  \na.  By December 1, 2021, HSD will employ sufficient staff such that it has the internal \ncapacity to effectively oversee, monitor, and manage the MCOs and to oversee and \ndevelop policy and procedures related to EPSDT. \nb.  By December 1, 2021, HSD will require that MCOs have a provider network sufficient \nto meet the needs identified in the Behavioral Health Care Workforce Development \nReview and hiring plans. \n \n2.  Training.  By December 1, 2021, HSD or its designees will provide incentives for providers \nto be trained in evidence-based, well-supported, and promising trauma-responsive services, \nwhich include intensive case management, High Fidelity Wraparound services, intensive \nhome-based services, and trauma-based therapies including Dialectical Behavior Therapy \n(DBT), Multi-Systemic Therapy (MST), trauma-informed Cognitive Behavioral Therapy \n(CBT),  Functional  Family  Training  (FFT),  and  Eye  Movement  Desensitization  and \nReprocessing therapy (EMDR).  Training will comply with professional standards and best \npractices  in  adult  education,  including  by  incorporating  experiential  and  interactive \ncomponents and using evaluations to measure effectiveness. \n \n3.  Community-Based Mental and Behavioral Health Services.  By December 1, 2022, the \nfollowing services will be available to every Child in State Custody for whom they are \nmedically necessary, as indicated by the CANS and functional trauma assessments and any \nfollow up.  Services will be available immediately where possible and not to exceed 10 Days \notherwise.  \na.  High Fidelity Wraparound services \nb.  intensive case management \nc.  intensive home-based services, which include mobile crisis response services and \nevidence-based, well-supported, or promising trauma-responsive therapies such as \nDialectical  Behavior  Therapy  (DBT),  Multi-Systemic  Therapy  (MST),  trauma-\ninformed Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Functional Family Training (FFT), \nand Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy (EMDR).   \n \n4.  By December 1, 2021, every Child in State Custody will receive a comprehensive well-child \ncheckup within 30 Days of entering state custody. \nKevin S. v.

New Mexico) \n_______________________________ \n \nCORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN \nFOR PARTIAL RESOLUTION OF ISSUES IN DISPUTE \n \nBy and Between \nKevin S., et al., Plaintiffs, and the New Mexico Children, Youth and Families Department \n(CYFD) and New Mexico Human Services Department (HSD), Defendants \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n \n*  *  *  *  * \n \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nIn the spirit of collaboration, counsel for Plaintiffs, CYFD and HSD (individually as “Party” and \ncollectively as the “Parties”), employed good-faith, best efforts to discuss and resolve disputes in \nfurtherance of Step 1 of the Dispute Resolution process set forth in Section IX.A of the March \n2020 Final Settlement Agreement (“Agreement”). The purpose of this Corrective Action Plan \n(“CAP”) is to partially resolve the areas of dispute as set forth in Plaintiffs’ initiation of the dispute \nresolution process dated January 6, 2023 and attached as Exhibit A. This Corrective Action Plan \nsets forth the commitments that CYFD and HSD agree to undertake to come into compliance with \nthe Agreement between the Parties and to ensure that children currently in state custody are able \nto benefit from the State’s commitments as outlined in the Agreement.  \nMediation conducted by the Co-Neutrals was held on March 28-29, 2023, April 14, 2023, and May \n5, 2023. In addition, the Parties participated in a facilitated listening session with Nations, Pueblos \nand Tribes located in New Mexico on May 10, 2023 and attended a mediation conducted by the \nCo-Neutrals on May 12, 2023.  The Parties held additional mediation sessions on May 24, 2023 \nand June 9, 2023.   \nAs used in this CAP, the term “State” refers to CYFD and HSD.  \nNothing in this CAP shall be construed to modify the obligations in the Agreement, including but \nnot limited to timelines for monitoring and reporting and meeting the Performance Standard as set \nforth in the Agreement. The CAP identifies and describes the strategies that the Parties agree are \nnecessary to implement the Agreement. As determined appropriate by the Co-Neutrals, the CAP \ncommitments may be referenced in the Co-Neutrals’ Annual Report. The Parties have jointly \nagreed that the commitments outlined in the CAP are necessary and will be undertaken in the time \nset forth in the CAP to improve the State’s ability to comply with its commitments. The Parties \nagree that this CAP shall expire on January 5, 2024.  \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n1 \n\nThis CAP resolves only the identified issues in dispute specifically resolved in the CAP up to the \ndate of execution of this CAP. Plaintiffs will not arbitrate the remaining issues in the 2021 report \nuntil the CAP expires. For any commitment set forth in the CAP that the State fails to meet, the \nParties agree that Plaintiffs may proceed to arbitration without initiating Step 1 of the Dispute \nResolution process set forth in the Agreement.  \nFor all remaining issues that have not be resolved in the CAP, the Parties agree that Plaintiffs have \nexhausted their obligations under Step 1 of the Dispute Resolution process set forth in the \nAgreement and may proceed to arbitration. Nothing in this CAP shall be construed as a waiver of \nPlaintiffs’ right to arbitrate any and all remaining unresolved issues and to secure any and all relief \nand remedies provided by the Agreement.  \nFor each commitment, the CAP identifies the issue(s) in dispute that is resolved by agreement \nbetween the Parties.  \n \n*  *  *  *  * \n \n1.   CYFD Workforce Caseload  \nThe Parties agree that the following commitments will be implemented to improve compliance \nwith Appendix B, Target Outcome 10. While the State’s performance with respect to this target is \nno longer in dispute, this target will still be reported and monitored as required under the original \nterms of the Agreement and CYFD is obligated to meet the agreed upon Performance Standard as \nto this target as set forth in the Agreement. The commitments below are to be implemented in \naddition to the activities set forth in the Agreement Appendix B, Target Outcome 10. \n \nThe Parties agree that there is an urgent need to recruit and retain case workers and to come into \ncompliance with the caseload standard required by the Agreement. CYFD will work closely and \ncooperatively with the Co-Neutrals to ensure progress towards meeting caseload standards and \nwill take the actions described below.   \na.  By December 31, 2023, no Investigation Case, Permanency Planning, In-Home Services, \nor Placement worker will have over 200% of the applicable caseload standards \ndocumented in the 2023 Data Validation Plan approved by the Co-Neutrals , including \ntrainees with graduated caseloads. \n \nb.  By December 31, 2023, no supervisor will be carrying any cases. \n \nc.  Monthly data reports with data elements agreed to by the Co-Neutrals will be made \navailable to Co-Neutrals, which the Co-Neutrals may validate. \n \nCYFD is exploring reporting this data in a monthly dashboard format. Until a dashboard is created, \nthe data will be reported in a format matching or similar to existing reports which are currently \nbeing submitted to the Co-Neutrals and Plaintiffs pursuant to the MOU. \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n2 \n\n \n2.  Building out family-based placements \nThe Parties agree that the following commitments will be implemented to improve compliance \nwith Appendix B, Target Outcome 6. While the State’s performance with respect to this target is \nno longer in dispute, this target will still be reported and monitored as required under the original \nterms of the Agreement, and CYFD and HSD are obligated to meet the agreed upon Performance \nStandard as to this target as set forth in the Agreement. The commitments below are to be \nimplemented in addition to the activities set forth in Appendix B, Target Outcome 6 of the \nAgreement. \nCYFD will commit to public/private strategy to recruit and retain resource families. \nIn five high-needs counties (Bernalillo, Dona Ana, Santa Fe, San Juan, and Chavez/Eddy), CYFD \nwill immediately assign one placement staff to focus exclusively on recruitment until at least \nSeptember 30, 2023. The State will maintain its dedicated public staff in the 5 designated counties \nat least until the private contractor has fully ramped up its capacity in those 5 designated counties.   \nIn addition to the assignment of placement staff to focus on the five counties listed above, CYFD \nwill enter into contracts with at least one private provider for resource family recruitment by \nSeptember 30, 2023 to focus on foster home recruitment and retention with specific capacity \nfocused on growing new foster homes in each county throughout the State. The contract will \nprovide that the private entities will recruit families and support them through the licensing \nprocess.  \nCYFD will retain exclusive responsibility for assessment, licensure and supervision of all foster \nhomes,  regardless  of  whether  the  home  is  recruited  publicly  or  privately.  CYFD  regional \nplacement staff will be responsible for supervising private entities. \nBy June 30, 2023, the State will have county-specific recruitment plans for each county in the State \nthat address the needs, strategies, and targets for resource homes. Said recruitment plans will \ninclude demographics of the children and youth in state custody (Children in State Custody, \nhereafter “CISC”), including: (1) the foster youths’ age, race and ethnicity; (2) the resource \nfamilies’ age, race, ethnicity, and geographic information; (3) the bed capacity of current resource \nfamilies; and (4) the numbers of families based on type of placement (non-kin; kin; and respite).  \nBy August 1, 2023, CYFD will develop additional capacity to assess the different levels of foster \ncare payment based on child needs by county to assist with county-specific foster care recruitment \nplanning.  These plans will be provided to the Co-Neutrals by June 30, 2023, and the State will \nmeet with the Co-Neutrals to discuss any feedback.  \nCYFD will maintain on its webpage data on monthly gain/loss of resource homes. CYFD’s web \nlink will be made publicly available.  \nCYFD will provide Co-Neutrals with quarterly statewide data on gain/loss of non-relative licensed \nresource homes. Details of these data, including quarterly date ranges and submission deadlines, \nwill be agreed upon by the Co-Neutrals and the State.  \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n3 \n\n \nCYFD will collect and assess the data by county and will provide data by county to the Co-Neutrals \nas set forth below in Section 5. \nThe Parties agree that care coordinators from managed care organizations (MCOs) need to take a \ngreater role in coordinating Treatment Foster Care (TFC) placements for children in state custody \nthat are enrolled in an MCO. When a child is recommended for TFC, including but not limited to \na recommendation from a mental health provider or a request from IPP team, CYFD will submit \nthe information to the MCO to confirm medical necessity by a prior authorization.   \nOnce the TFC recommendation has been referred to the MCO by CYFD and prior authorization \nand medical necessity has been confirmed, the care coordinator assigned to the child will have the \nresponsibility of coordinating and obtaining TFC services. The  MCO care coordinator will \ndocument  such  activity  appropriately  in  the  child’s  file  kept  by  the  MCO  pursuant  to  the \nobligations as outlined in Section 4.4 of the Medicaid Managed Care Organization Service \nAgreement. See also LOD 69-1, describing new obligations under section 4.12.15.  \nFor children who are Fee for Service (FFS), CYFD will submit the referral packet to the Third \nParty Assessor (TPA). CYFD and HSD will then work with the IPP Team to find a TFC placement. \nIf the TFC recommendation is reduced, denied, modified, delayed or not approved by the MCO or \nTPA, Notice of Action and grievance protocols will be provided to the child’s caregiver, legal \nrepresentative, and legal custodian. Any Notice of Action received by CYFD will be provided to \nthe child’s Nation, Pueblo or Tribe if applicable. Any denial, reduction, modification, delay of a \nrecommendation for treatment foster care, including for prior authorization requests, will be \nreviewed by the Medical Director at the MCO or TPA, and a copy of the Medical Director’s \ndecision to be sent to the Cabinet Secretary of HSD and the Cabinet Secretary of CYFD. If TFC \nservices are not authorized by the MCO, HSD and/or CYFD, including through state general funds \nor single case agreements, the State will immediately (within 5 days) identify alternative services. \nTo address the needs of the child in state custody during the period of appeal, the child will be \nplaced in the most appropriate and least restrictive placement as identified by the IPP Team, and \nthe team may consider single case agreements as needed for community-based placement.  \nThe Parties agree that the determination (approval/denial/modification/reduction/delay) will be \ntracked by CYFD and HSD and that the time (number of days) between approval and treatment \nfoster care services beginning will be tracked. Details of these data will be tracked as follows: \nAggregate and child-specific level data for the following on a quarterly basis (data will include \nthe case and person ID, date of birth, date of request/activity or disposition decision and notice \nprovided) will be provided to the Co-Neutrals:  \n \n1.  Referrals/requests for prior authorization of TFC by CYFD to MCO  \n2.  Disposition of TFC requests for prior authorization by MCO (to include approvals, \nmodifications, denials) \n3.  For all approvals or modifications, dates and identification of provider for the following:  \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n4 \n\na.  Referral made by MCO to TFC agency (for each TFC provider the referral was \nsubmitted and corresponding dates for each referral) \nb.  Decision provided by TFC agency to MCO (for each TFC provider providing the \ndecision and corresponding dates for each decision) \nc.  For any acceptances from TFC agency, date the acceptance was received, and date \nthat service began  \nd.  For any modifications or denials from TFC agency, reason for denial and any requests \nfor supportive services that would allow for acceptance  \n4.  Requests for re-authorization of TFC to MCO  \n5.  Disposition of TFC reauthorization requests by MCO (to include approvals, modifications, \ndenials) \n6.  For all children referred by CYFD to MCO for TFC, aggregate data on the number of days \nbetween the request by CYFD for TFC prior authorization, approval by MCO, and TFC \nbeing provided to the child.  \n \nFor FFS, CYFD and HSD will track the activities above.  \n3.  Bringing children placed out of state back to New Mexico  \nThe Parties agree that the following commitments will be implemented to improve compliance \nwith Appendix B, Target Outcome 2. While the State’s performance with this target is no longer \nin dispute, this target will still be reported and monitored as required under the original terms of \nthe Agreement and CYFD and HSD are obligated to meet the agreed upon Performance Standard \nas to this target as set forth in the Agreement. The commitments below are to be implemented in \naddition to the activities set forth in the Agreement for Appendix B, Target Outcome 2.  \n \nThe Parties agree that immediate efforts must be made to end all out-of-state placements unless in \nextraordinary circumstances necessary to protect the safety and security of the child as documented \nin the child’s record and as approved by the Secretary of CYFD and the Secretary of HSD and to \ncontinued efforts to bring children who are currently placed in out-of-state congregate care back \nto  New  Mexico  with  appropriate  services.  The  State  will  immediately  launch  a  six-month \nspecialized review team (“Team”), with authority to authorize single case agreements if necessary \nto provide services and supports to children with complex needs in New Mexico. Notwithstanding \nthe January 5, 2024 expiration date of this CAP, the State agrees to continue the specialized review \nteam for six months from the date of this CAP. \n \nThe following participants will be members of the Team: Dr. George Davis, CYFD’s Optimal \nPlacement Coordinator who will have authority to authorize single case agreements, the CYFD \nCommunity Behavioral Health Clinician (CBHC), and the MCO Medical/BH Director for each \nrelevant child. The Team has authority to bring in other people with relevant knowledge about the \nchild; the child’s disability; and the services and supports that will enable the child to be returned \nto New Mexico [i.e.: DD Waiver professionals, Guardian Ad Litem/Youth Attorney, long term \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n5 \n\n \nproviders, representatives from the child’s Nation, Pueblo or Tribe]. Any engagement with those \noutside of State Agencies would require confidentiality agreements and specific parameters to \nguard the protected health information and other specific case details, as applicable, to be reviewed \nand approved by State authorities.   \n \nThe Team will meet as frequently as needed to develop a plan to bring nine currently identified \nchildren back to New Mexico and into a safe, least restrictive and appropriate setting. These nine \nchildren have been identified because they do not have a current discharge plan. If the discharge \nplans for any of the other children in state custody who are currently out of state but not part of the \nidentified nine children cannot be implemented, these children will also be reviewed by the Team. \nFor all children currently out of state, when the children return to New Mexico, their placement \nand services will be monitored by the Team every 30, 60, and 90 days pursuant to CYFD’s current \nIPP process. \n \nAt the end of the six-month pilot, the Team will analyze the effectiveness of its actions towards \nbringing children back to New Mexico successfully under single case agreements and identify \npractices and services that will be useful for avoiding out-of-state placements for CISC in the \nfuture. The findings of the Team will be shared with the Co-Neutrals and the Plaintiffs. \n \nThe State has agreed to pay Dr. George Davis at the rate of $200 an hour, with the express \nunderstanding that this rate is only for the purposes of participating in the pilot team. As a Team \nparticipant, Dr. Davis will be provided with confidential information solely for the purposes of \nidentifying the treatment and service needs of the children being reviewed by the Team.  Personal \nidentifying information regarding specific children will not be shared with the Plaintiffs’ counsel \nby Dr. Davis. However, Plaintiffs’ counsel retain all the rights to access confidential information \nas set forth in the Agreement and the Protective Order filed in this matter.  \n \nIn addition to the Team – and in order to stop sending children in state custody out of state in \nviolation of the Agreement – both the CYFD Secretary and the HSD Secretary must approve any \nout-of-state placement before placement is made.  \n \nIn addition, in order to serve more CISC in home-based settings, HSD agrees to double the \nCapacity of High-Fidelity Wraparound (HFW) Services in Medicaid by January 1, 2024. \n \nHSD and CYFD will work together to meet the goal of doubling the capacity of the newly- \napproved HFW benefit in Medicaid by the end of 2023 by committing to the following:  \n  HSD and CYFD will double the number of HFW sites from 10 to 20. \n \n  HSD and CYFD will double the number of HFW facilitators from 26 to 52. It takes six \nmonths to train HFW facilitators. HSD and CYFD will have 26 additional facilitators in \nthe training pipeline by January 1, with credentialing expected in the first quarter of 2024. \n \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n6 \n\nOn October 1, 2023, HSD and CYFD will provide the Co-Neutrals and the Plaintiffs with: 1) \nfacilitator training tracking logs to reflect HFW facilitators in training, and 2) a Medicaid provider \nenrollment report to reflect the number of enrolled HFW providers, with a final report to be \nprovided on January 15, 2024 reflecting the status as of January 1, 2024.  \n4.  Critical Incident Review (CIR) \nThe Parties agree that the following commitments will be implemented to improve compliance \nwith Appendix B, Target Outcomes 2, 3, and 4. While the State’s performance with these targets \nare no longer in dispute, these targets will still be reported and monitored as required under the \noriginal terms of the Agreement and CYFD and HSD are obligated to meet the agreed upon \nPerformance Standard as to each target as set forth in the Agreement. The commitments below are \nto be implemented in addition to the activities set forth in the Agreement for Appendix B, Target \nOutcomes 2, 3, and 4.  \n \nThe Parties agree that any determination of medical necessity and the child’s best interest must \ntake into account the safety of the child and whether the placement is the least restrictive placement \navailable for the child. In addition, the Parties seek to ensure that there is diligent and careful \noversight to ensure the safety of all children in state custody placed in offices, motels, and \ncongregate care settings.  \n \nCYFD will provide the Co-Neutrals with written notice via email within one (1) business day of \nnotification to the department of any critical incident regarding a child placed in hotels, motels, \noffices, out-of-state, in shelters, or in congregate care in New Mexico. Along with the notice of \ncritical incident(s), the State will provide a safety plan for the child, describing services and \nsupports that will be provided as necessary to address the harm of the critical incident and steps \nthat will be taken to protect the child from such harm in the immediate future. Children placed in \noffices for under 23 hours will be included in the critical incident reviews.  \nCritical incidents regarding a child placed in hotels, motels, offices, out-of-state, in shelters, or in \ncongregate care in New Mexico include:  \n●  Any 911 call \n●  Any allegations of harm \n●  Any allegations of abuse and/or neglect  \n●  Any allegation of restraint/seclusion, and  \n●  Any change in licensure within any facility in which a child in State custody is \nplaced \nThe Co-Neutral team shall continue to have immediate access to the State’s data systems and all \nrecords therein regarding the child who is subject to a critical incident pursuant to the Agreement. \nThe Co-Neutral team will be provided with any documents requested related to the placement, \nincluding emails related to staffing and oversight of placement decisions. The State shall respond \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n7 \n\nin writing within two (2) business days to the Co-Neutrals’ request for information corresponding \nto an identified critical incident.  \nThe Co-Neutrals will provide information quarterly to Plaintiffs which will at minimum detail \nnumbers of CIR by type. The CIRs will also be addressed in the Co-Neutral Annual Report.  \n \n5.  Data Needed to Monitor Progress | Real Time Data \nThe Parties agree that the following commitments will be implemented to improve compliance \nwith the Appendix B Targets above (BTO 2, 3, 4, 6, and 10). While the State’s performance with \nrespect to these targets are no longer in dispute, this target will still be reported and monitored as \nrequired under the original terms of the Agreement and CYFD and HSD are obligated to meet the \nagreed  upon  Performance  Standard  as  to  this  target  as  set  forth  in  the  Agreement.  The \ncommitments below are to be implemented in addition to the activities set forth in the Agreement \nfor Appendix B, Target Outcomes 2, 3, 4, 6, and 10. \n \nThe Parties agree that it is imperative for the State and the Co-Neutrals to have access to real time \ndata to assist the State in meeting the obligations in the Agreement and that the failure to have \naccess to real time data has already delayed needed progress on many deliverables.   \n \nIn order to more effectively monitor the State’s progress, CYFD and HSD agree to provide real \ntime data as follows:  \n \n●  All data, including real time data, that is being provided pursuant to the MOU dated \nJune 10, 2022 and fully executed on June 15, 2022 (2022 MOU) will continue to \nbe provided.  \n●  In addition, the State will include monthly submissions to the Co-Neutrals on new \nin-state  congregate  care  placements,  including  crisis  stabilization,  clinical \ncongregate care placements, and non-clinical congregate care placements.  \n●  The State will provide medical necessity determination information for new in-state \nand out-of-state clinical congregate care placements.  \n●  The State will finalize data elements necessary to track progress on foster care \nrecruitment and retention with the Co-Neutrals. The data elements will include \nquarterly statewide data on gain/loss of non-relative licensed resource homes and \ndata by county.  \n●  In addition to the data regarding treatment foster care to be provided to the Co-\nNeutrals above in Section 2, the State will provide to Co-Neutrals quarterly data on \nthe total number of treatment foster care homes.  \n●  On a quarterly basis, with one-quarter delay, the State will provide child entry \ncohort data (children who entered as children in state custody in the prior quarter) \nto the Co-Neutrals.  Beginning on July 1, 2023, the State will provide child entry \ncohort data between January 1, 2023 and March 31, 2023.  These quarterly reports \nwill be provided through January 1, 2024.   \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n8 \n\n \n \n \n6.  Pilots \nPILOTS FOR COORDINATED ACTION WITHIN LOCAL COMMUNITIES \nThe Parties agree the following commitments will be implemented to improve compliance with \nAppendix A, Target Outcome 1, and Appendix B, Target Outcomes 2, 3, 4, 6 and 1. While the \nState’s performance with respect to these targets are no longer in dispute, these targets will still be \nreported and monitored as required under the original terms of the Agreement and CYFD and HSD \nare obligated to meet the agreed upon Performance Standard as to each target as set forth in the \nAgreement. The commitments below are to be implemented in addition to the activities set forth \nin the Agreement for these targets.  \nThe pilot for coordinated action within local communities reflects the Parties agreement that \ncompliance with the Agreement will require CYFD and HSD to partner at a county office level \nand to partner with community stakeholders.  \nPURPOSE: A meaningful, solution-focused collaboration between CYFD, HSD, including their \nrespective Behavioral Health Services and Behavioral Health Services Divisions, and the local \nchild-welfare  community  to  look  at  current  practice,  identify  strengths  and  challenges  to \nimplementing an integrated system of care that meets the individualized needs of children and their \nfamilies involved with protective service in their community as guided under the commitments the \nState has made to strengthen its workforce and to provide a trauma-responsive system of care, \nstrengthen and  expand  its behavioral health services, comply  with  ICWA and pursue least \nrestrictive and appropriate placements. Emphasis will be placed on operationalizing all reasonable \nrecommendations and creative solutions brought forward and on building out the availability of \nany appropriate and needed services, including behavioral and mental health identified in the \nAgreement, in these communities. \nDESIRED OUTCOME: To provide concrete, community-specific recommendations on how to \naddress  identified  challenges  and  barriers  realistically  and  effectively  to  ensure  successful \nimplementation of a culturally supportive, trauma-responsive, and identity-affirming system of \ncare for children/youth in CYFD’s custody, to fill in any existing service gaps, and further develop \nservices, including behavioral and mental health services identified in the Agreement, in the \nidentified local communities.   \nAny proposed recommendations shall be reasonable and final decisions around implementing \nrecommendations regarding CYFD’s policy, procedures, practices, and procurement is the sole \nresponsibility and authority of the CYFD Cabinet Secretary and Director of Protective Services \nand the HSD Cabinet Secretary. Should a recommendation be deemed unreasonable or impossible, \nthe State will provide feedback to the facilitator for discussion at future meetings to identify ways \nto problem solve around such barriers where and when appropriate. Furthermore, the State will \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n9 \n\nmake efforts to implement the reasonable recommendations through various means (e.g., financial \nor technical assistance) to others such as non-profits or providers if direct implementation by the \nState is not possible. \nWHAT THIS IS NOT: An opportunity to blame or shame anyone at the table or expect that \nCYFD can implement all recommendations alone. Additionally, this team does not have the \nauthority to generate or create policies or procedures for CYFD, local providers, etc., or procure \nfunding or contracts.  \nFACILITATION and FREQUENCY: Monthly meeting, with offline assignments. Meetings \nwill be facilitated by a neutral third party agreed to by the Parties and contracted by CYFD. \nTIMEFRAME: Notwithstanding the January 5, 2024 expiration of this CAP, the State agrees to \nconvene the pilots for coordinated action within local communities from August 1, 2023 through \nApril 30, 2024.  \nCYFD will contract with a third-party to facilitate meetings and coordinate communication for \ntwo teams. The teams will be established in San Juan and Dona Ana counties. Each team will \nselect its own Co-Chairs, determine cadence of data requests and needs, written plans to guide \ntheir work, and requested frequency of updates on implementation of recommended strategies. \nThe facilitator and Co-Chairs are responsible for the final report on or before May 31, 2024.   \nThe teams are tasked with reviewing local and statewide data related to the child welfare system \nand developing innovative, realistic solutions that are responsive to on-the-ground realities. Each \nteam will document its efforts so that their plans and reports can be shared with county offices \naround the state. The primary focus of the teams is to address foundational components necessary \nto keep children and youth in safe and family-based settings in their local communities, and to be \ninclusive of tribal collaboration and youth-voices and choices around appropriate placements. \nThe  Plaintiffs’  counsel  and  the  State  will  work  together  to  identify  team  participants  and \nfacilitators before July 14, 2023.

Recommendations for strategies to keep children in safe and family-based settings in their \nlocal community, and inclusive of tribal and youth-voice and choices around appropriate \nplacements. \na.  Pilot Teams will identify strategies to expand the number of culturally responsive \nresource parents available to provide home-based care for children. \nStrategies can include, but are not limited to: \n●  Achievable monthly targets for local resource parent recruitment, \nincluding respite, Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 placements.  \n●  Ideas and strategies for Foster Care Plus. \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n11 \n\n \n●  Identification of barriers (e.g., lack of prompt response to potential \nresource parents, reimbursement issues, etc.) and recommended strategies \nto support resource parents (e.g., mentorship, training, etc.).  \n \n●  Ideas and strategies identified by Nation, Pueblo or Tribal (N/P/T) partners \nto implement the requirements of IFPA. \nCYFD  will  identify  specific  persons  at  CYFD  responsible  for  leading  the \nimplementation of resource family recruitment and who will be responsible for reporting \non progress to the pilot teams until such time as the independent contractor is hired to \nlead CYFD’s Resource Parent recruitment efforts. Barring any conflict of interest, a \nrepresentative from the Pilot Team will be selected to serve on the selection committee \nif CYFD issues a Request for Proposals (“RFP”) or Request for Application (“RFA”) for \nrecruitment services and efforts. \nb.  Pilot Teams will make recommendation around staff recruitment and retention \nstrategies aimed at ensuring that reasonable caseload standards are achieved and \nmaintained. \n●  Based on review of local CYFD positions, broken out by type; identification \nof all vacant positions by type; and local monthly caseload data by type of \nposition, the pilot teams will make recommendations for local recruitment \nand retention strategies to meet local vacancy and caseload needs. \n●  The COM, in collaboration with CYFD leadership, will be responsible for \nimplementing all reasonable strategies to recruit case workers and to manage \ncaseloads and must provide feedback on efforts and ongoing barriers at pilot \nteam meetings. \n2.  Recommendations on how to build upon, strengthen, or expand access to timely and \nappropriate  trauma-responsive  behavioral  and  medical  health  services  in  the  local \ncommunity. At the start of each pilot CYFD and/or HSD will provide the teams with the \ninformation needed (including information on continuum of services for families and/or \nchildren) to ensure the desired outcomes of the pilot programs can be addressed, and to \nensure the purpose and scope of the pilot team and any components thereof are understood. \n●  Based on a review of local CAT and CANs aggregate data regarding the \ntimeliness with which said screens are completed and shared as required, and \nassessment/service delays or gaps as available, the teams will recommend \nreasonable  strategies  to  improve  timely  provision  and  proper  sharing  of \nscreens, if necessary.  \n●  Pilot teams will make recommendations, if needed, on how to better ensure \nindividualized planning meetings (IPMs) are occurring timely, are meaningful to \nparticipants, and how to improve the process, if needed.  \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n12 \n\n●  Pilot  teams  will  make  recommendations,  if  needed,  to  improve  care \ncoordination.    Based  on  review  of  local  real-time  data  regarding  care \ncoordination, including percentage of required CATs/CANS provided to care \ncoordinators by CYFD, percentage of IPMs that include care coordinators \nparticipation, percentage of children who have had EPSDT well-child checks \nwithin  30  days  of  coming  into  care,  and  whether  services  identified  by \nCAT/CANS/EPSDT, IPM teams have been provided within 10 days, pilot \nteams  will  recommend  strategies  to  improve  care  coordination  capacity. \nParticular emphasis will be placed on identifying and expanding the services \nwhich  are  necessary  to  address  the  needs  of  the  local  community  as \ndemonstrated in assessments.  \n●  Pilot Teams will make recommendations, if needed, for improving access to \nlocal  culturally  relevant  services,  supports,  and  placements  for  Native \nAmerican children/youth, African American children/youth, and other cultural \nidentities  served  within  the  child  welfare  system,  as  well  as  LBGTQ+ \nidentities, disability identities, immigration status, and other intersectional \nidentities. \no  The Tribal representative, if they are able to participate, and/or the \nCYFD  Office  of  Tribal  Affairs  representative  will  be  invited  to \nidentify  challenges  or  successes  in  local  ICWA/IFPA  cases  for \nconsideration by the pilot team, including a review of local data \nregarding Native children in CYFD custody; the percentage of children \nin preferred placements; a review of the quality of OOPP meetings, \nand make recommendations to improve ICWA/IFPA compliance and \nstrengthen tribal collaboration. Individual child and Nation, Tribe or \nPueblo specific information will not be shared. \n●  The teams will identify strategies, if needed, to strengthen or expand trauma-\nresponsive behavioral health services.

APPENDIX C TERMS   \nCYFD and Plaintiffs have reached the following agreements on Appendix C. Plaintiffs were \nunable to reach agreement with HSD regarding any Appendix C terms. \nCYFD and the Plaintiffs agree the following commitments will be implemented to improve \ncompliance with Appendix C. While CYFD's performance under Appendix C is no longer in \ndispute, the Appendix will still be reported and monitored as required under the original terms of \nthe Agreement and CYFD and HSD are obligated to meet the agreed upon Performance Standard \nas to each target as set forth in the Agreement. The commitments below are to be implemented in \naddition to the activities set forth in the Agreement for Appendix C.  \nCYFD and the Plaintiffs recognize the unique nature of these Appendix C commitments in that \nfull  implementation  involves  not  only  a  strong  commitment  from  CYFD,  but  ongoing \ncommunication and partnership, and consultation when necessary and appropriate, with the 23 \nN/P/Ts in New Mexico, as well as meaningful engagement of affected Native American children, \nyouth, and families.  \nThe Parties also recognize that Appendix C requires groundbreaking systemic innovations, which \nwill require creativity, flexibility, and an iterative process.  To demonstrate and ensure respect for \nNew Mexico’s N/P/Ts unique interest and time constraints, CYFD is committed to leveraging \nstanding meetings it has with interested N/P/Ts or their representatives to engage and collaborate \nto put into practice the system changes further identified below. CYFD agrees to be accountable \nfor responding to the input it receives from N/P/Ts as described below.  \nCYFD and the Plaintiffs recognize that each of the N/P/Ts are sovereign entities and not parties to \nthe Agreement and that nothing in either this Corrective Action Plan (CAP) or the Final Settlement \nAgreement (FSA) binds the N/P/Ts and that this CAP cannot commit the N/P/Ts to any activity or \nengagement contemplated by this CAP or the FSA.  Furthermore, the Parties agree each of the \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n15 \n\nN/P/Ts are in no way obligated to enter into an agreement, contract or engage with either CYFD, \nand do so at their sole discretion. \nCYFD agrees that within two weeks of any signed CAP, it will be shared with the N/P/Ts. The \nParties agree that any input from the N/P/Ts regarding this agreement will be shared with all \nParties. CYFD agrees to continue to provide the Co-Neutrals and the Plaintiffs with data pursuant \nto the 2022 MOU.  \nIn addition, CYFD agrees to provide the Co-Neutrals and the Plaintiffs with the number of Native \nchildren placed in IFPA preferred placements and the number of Native children not placed in \nIFPA preferred placements on a monthly basis beginning August 15, 2023.   \n1.  Joint Powers Agreements (JPA) \nBy September 1, 2023, CYFD will make good faith efforts to engage and negotiate with five \nN/P/Ts who are interested in a new or revised JPA, with initial outreach being made to the 5 N/P/T \nwith the most children in state custody.  Proposed discussions surrounding the JPAs shall include \nobligations or actions of the State and N/P/Ts regarding children, youth, or families of the \nrespective N/P/T child(ren) who are CISC under Protective Services. Proposed discussions may \nalso include any area of the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) and the Indian Family Protection \nAct (IFPA) identified and agreed to by the N/P/Ts and CYFD. Pursuant to the interests of the \nrespective N/P/T, JPA discussions and negotiations may also include but are not limited to on-\ngoing communication and collaborations (per the State-Tribal Collaboration Act and the IFPA), \nregarding behavioral health services, culture, data, financial and technical support, jurisdiction, \nreimbursement  for  legal  services,  notice,  preferred  placement,  recruitment  and  retention  of \nresource families, or relative licensing. The State recognizes the value of services and supports \nthat N/P/T representatives bring to meetings and discussions necessary to improve the State’s \nservices for Native CISC. As part of JPA discussions, the State will explore alternative single \nsource contracts for services that benefit N/P/Ts and assist the State in activities related to family \npreservation, IFPA and ICWA. CYFD also agrees to increase the resources of the General \nCounsel’s Office to negotiate the JPAs as quickly as possible.  \nBy December 31, 2023, CYFD will make good faith efforts to initiate engagement and negotiate \nwith any remaining N/P/Ts who wish to engage in discussions on JPAs. Any current efforts CYFD \nhas taken to collaborate, communicate, and negotiate with N/P/Ts on various matters, including \nbut not limited to JPAs, will continue.  \nBy December 31, 2023, with the explicit knowledge and permission from those N/P/Ts, CYFD \nwill inform the Co-Neutrals on the status of JPAs including  presentation materials, if any, \nincluding dates of meetings held and numbers of attendees, how many JPAs are being negotiated \nand projected timeline for completion, if known.  \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n16 \n\n2.  Native Resource Family Recruitment & Retention \nBy July 31, 2023, CYFD will revise the Licensing Standards procedure to include the input \nprovided from previous discussions and review between OTA and representatives of the N/P/Ts. \nBy July 19, 2023, during their standing meetings with N/P/T representatives, CYFD will provide \nfeedback on the specific barriers, if any, to the comments the N/P/T representatives have identified. \nCYFD will make its revised policy and procedure publicly available upon approval by the Cabinet \nSecretary.  \nBy July 1, 2023, CYFD will engage with the N/P/Ts to develop a recruitment and retention plan \nwhich centers the Native child, family and community and encourages and supports Tribal \ncommunity-based and family-based alliances. The retention portion of the plan will further \nprovide: \na.  Regular, on-going support provided to the resource family to help ensure the family is well \nequipped to address the behavioral, physical and psychological needs of the child, as well \nas ensuring cultural connectedness (as identified by the child’s family, tribal community, \nand N/P/T). \nb.  A mechanism to identify and reduce barriers for reimbursement. \nc.  A child-family-community centered model where services come to the child, family, and \nN/P/T. \nd.  Allows for specific input from individual Tribes regarding how to best recruit and retain \nfamilies in a way that will meet the needs of the specific Tribal community, including \nallowing for financial support to N/P/Ts to provide this service.  \ne.  An internal paradigm within CYFD of accountability and support to ensure the child and \nfamily are provided regular, on-going supportive services based on their individual needs, \nwhich fosters and promotes reunification, stable relative and community placement. \nIn the development of the recruitment and retention plans, CYFD will leverage its current standing \nmeetings  with  representatives  from  the  N/P/T  to  engage  them  in  identifying  steps  toward \naddressing barriers and providing additional supports throughout the resource family licensing \nprocess.   \nAfter  input  from  N/P/T,  the  statewide  recruitment  and  retention  plan  or  the  individualized \nrecruitment and retention plans as determined by the preference of the N/P/T will be finalized once \nthe communication and collaboration process has concluded.  \nCYFD will report to the Co-Neutrals and the Plaintiffs on the status of its efforts under this term \nquarterly (the 2023 third quarter report will be provided on or before October 23, 2023 and the \n2023 fourth quarter report will be provided on or before January 15, 2024).   \n3.  ICWA/IFPA Preferred Placement  \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n17 \n\nBy July 31, 2023, the Office of Tribal Affairs (OTA), with the support of Protective Services \nDivision (PSD or PS), will resume as the primary facilitators of CYFD’s Out of Preferred \nPlacement (OOPP) meetings. Feedback on the OOPP Team meeting process will be gathered \nquarterly  from  representatives  of  the  N/P/Ts  and  CYFD  will  work  in  a  collaborative  and \nmeaningful way to identify and address any on-going concerns. OOPP procedures will be revised \nand finalized no later than November 1, 2023.  Any OOPP procedural revisions shall be subject to \nreview and approval by the Co-Neutrals as set forth in the Agreement. The Co-Neutrals shall not \nwithhold approval of any policy revisions if such revisions are reasonably calculated to achieve \nthe goals of the Agreement. \na.  Review of all OOPPs (non-compliant with ICWA or IFPA placement preferences): \nThe placement of Native children with relatives is the highest order of priority.  \nFIRST LEVEL REVIEW PROCESS: If a Native child is placed in a non-relative \nhome that does not meet the highest order of priority pursuant to ICWA or IFPA, PSD \nwill notify OTA and the child’s N/P/T in writing within two business days of the \nplacement and schedule a 30-day relative placement meeting on all ICWA/IFPA cases, \nto include representation from OTA and a representative from the child’s N/P/T. These \nmeetings will be held every 30 days until the child is placed with a relative. The purpose \nof this meeting is to ensure active efforts to move the child into a relative placement \nare being made and that recommendations made by the meeting participants have been \nfollowed.  \nb.  PROPOSED: Second level internal review process pending review and feedback \nfrom N/P/T representatives: If the child remains in an OOPP that is not compliant \nwith ICWA or IFPA placement preferences for sixty (60) days, OTA and Protective \nServices leadership will review barriers and identify next steps, including person(s) \nresponsible, to move the child into the highest order of preferred placement with a \nrelative based on input from representatives of the N/P/T and the child’s team. The \npurpose  of  the  review  is  to  ensure  all  active  efforts  are  being  made  and \nrecommendations followed up on by the team members. A Protective Services Field \nDeputy Director and OTA will communicate in writing to the assigned PS worker, \nsupervisor, and managers, the respective Tribal representative(s), and other participants \nof the OOPP meetings the findings of the review and specific next steps and time \nframes for the completion of identified tasks within 15 days of the review. This internal \nreview process will recur every sixty (60) days if the Indian Child remains in an OOPP. \nAdditionally, OTA and the representative from the N/P/T will be notified of the same \nin writing within two business days. \nA review of the current process for this which identifies challenges and solutions with N/P/Ts shall \nbe conducted by July 30, 2023.  \n4.  Resources \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n18 \n\nWith the input from representatives from each N/P/T who are interested, CYFD will engage, \nnegotiate,  and  develop  a  written  agreement  template,  regarding  N/P/Ts  access  to  financial \nresources, including Title IV-E funds by November 30, 2023. By November 15, 2023, CYFD will \nsolicit feedback from representatives from the N/P/Ts by leveraging standing meetings hosted by \nthe Office of Tribal Affairs to identify the barriers and challenges currently existing which prevent \naccess to financial resources and identify a process to overcoming those barriers or challenges. In \naddition, CYFD will review their administrative processes regarding access to funds to make sure \nthat there are not barriers to their use. \nCYFD will further support N/P/T representatives who, at their discretion, chose to participate in \ntrainings offered free of cost to them by CYFD which may include but are not limited to: Safe and \nTogether, READ-i NM, Qualified Expert Witness, New Employee Training and trainings offered \nthrough existing contracts CYFD has with the New Mexico State University Center for Innovation. \nCYFD will support and coordinate with N/P/Ts, who at their discretion, choose to host trauma-\ninformed/-responsive training in their communities. \nTo further support the strategies necessary to achieve the intended outcomes of Appendix C of the \nAgreement, CYFD will seek to make funding accessible to N/P/Ts, who at their discretion choose \nto provide services for Native CISC including activities such as resource parent recruitment and \nretention efforts, home study development services, and/or traditional interventions or culturally \nresponsive services.  CYFD will offer single source contracts to interested N/P/T to the maximum \nextent that such funds are available for these activities.  If there are insufficient funds available to \noffer single source contracts to interested N/P/T, CYFD will include an additional funding in its \nbudget request to the Governor in advance of the 2024 legislative session.  \nIn addition, CYFD will identify and work to secure funding for competitive bid and single source \ncontracts with culturally competent, ICWA and IFPA knowledgeable N/P/T or entities, that have \nthe experience and expertise in working with N/P/T’s, communities and families for activities \nincluding but not limited to conducting culturally responsive home studies, relative searches, etc. \non behalf of Indian children in state custody.  \n5.  Data \nBy July 30, 2023, CYFD’s Office of Tribal Affairs and the Performance and Accountability \nDirector or designated staff will have made good faith efforts to identify any and all New Mexico \nN/P/Ts who have data request(s), including those for the number and location of children from \nspecific N/P/Ts with CYFD involvement, and establish a plan to respond accordingly based on the \nnature of those requests which includes a reasonable reporting cadence that is based on the \navailability of the data and the N/P/Ts’ specific request. By December 31, 2023, CYFD will report \nto the Co-Neutrals the number of data requests made by N/P/T, the date each request was made, \nand the date that requested data was provided.  The content of the data request and the N/P/T that \nmade the request does not need to be reported. \n6.  IFPA Notice \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n19 \n\n   \nIn recognition of the concern raised by N/T/Ps that CYFD was not consistently providing notice \nas required by IFPA, CYFD’s Office of Tribal Affairs Director and PSD leadership began to meet \nin June 2023 and shall continue to meet monthly beginning July 2023 to leverage standing \nmeetings  which  include  Tribal  partners  from  N/P/Ts  and  identify  barriers,  challenges,  and \nsolutions to timely notification and data entry. CYFD’s Performance and Accountability Director \nor staff will join OTA and PSD leadership in meeting quarterly and provide available data to \nreview progress and ongoing challenges as well as contribute ideas around additional solutions.   \nBy July 1, 2023, OTA and PSD will have a plan to solicit input from PSD staff, including \ninvestigators,  permanency,  placement,  legal  and  respective  supervisors  or  County  Office \nManagers, around barriers they are experiencing which prevent timely notification. Solutions to \ntimely notification developed by OTA and PSD leadership will be inclusive of feedback from PSD \nfield staff. CYFD will analyze the feedback, implement its plan and provide the same to the Co-\nNeutrals by November 1, 2023.  \nBy August 1, 2023, all pre-initiation investigation staffings will include a discussion regarding the \nactive efforts for proper inquiry about whether the child is a member of or there is “reason to \nknow” the child is a member of a N/P/T as well as CYFD’s conclusion of whether the child is a \nmember, there is reason to know the child is a member, or the child is not a member or there is \nreason to know the child is not a member. By July 31, 2023, all pre-initiation staffing forms will \nbe updated to include documentation regarding discussion outlined above.   \nBy August 1, 2023, if CYFD concludes the child is a member or there is reason to know the \nchild is a member of a N/P/T: \na.  the supervisor will review the Notice of  Investigation to ensure it is thoroughly \ncompleted and emailed to the proper N/P/T and cc: ICWA.Notice@cyfd.nm.gov, and \ndocument in CYFD’s electronic data management system that the notice and their \nreview was completed.  \nb.  Certified Notice with return receipt requested will be sent to the N/P/T pursuant to \nIFPA. CYFD will document in the electronic data management system the date the \ncertified notice was mailed and the date the return receipt indicates the N/P/T received \nthe notice. These documents will be placed in the corresponding physical file with a \ncomment in the electronic data management system indicating the same.  \nc.  Supervisors will conduct a monthly review of ICWA/IFPA cases in FACTS and the \ncorresponding physical file to ensure timely and accurate entries are occurring. This \nincludes appropriate narrative entries as described above and demographic data to \nensure N/P/Ts are correctly identified. Supervisor case reviews will be documented in \nthe electronic data management system (FACTS). \n \nCYFD agrees to ensure that OTA has sufficient staff to be able to implement these terms.  \n7.  Listening Session Follow-up \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n20 \n\nCYFD agrees to host an event before by December 1, 2023 to address the needs of Native CISC. \nThe event will take into account the interests of N/P/Ts and may include a number of issues that \nimpact Native CISC and their N/P/Ts such as discussion of behavioral health services and the \nprovision of culturally appropriate trauma responsive services to Native CISC.  \nN/P/T will be provided with opportunities to learn about all Kevin S. deliverables, the progress the \nState is making on the deliverables, and opportunities to provide input on them.  The Co-Neutrals \nand Plaintiffs’ counsel will be invited to attend this follow-up session.  \nIII. APPENDIX D TERMS \nThe Parties agree the following commitments will be implemented to improve compliance with \nAppendix D, Target Outcome 4. While the State’s performance with respect to this targetis no \nlonger in dispute, this target will still be reported and monitored as required under the original \nterms of the Agreement and CYFD and HSD are obligated to meet the agreed upon Performance \nStandard as to the target as set forth in the Agreement. The commitments below are to be \nimplemented in addition to the activities set forth in the Agreement for Appendix D, Target \nOutcome 4.  \n \nTo come into compliance with the FSA Requirement that 100% of CISC will receive a Well-\nChild visit within 30 days of entering state custody, HSD and CYFD will implement the following \nplan to ensure that 100% of children will receive a comprehensive Well-Child visit within 30 \ndays of entering state custody. This plan also outlines monthly reporting requirements regarding \nthe implementation and ongoing monitoring of comprehensive Well-Child visits. \n \n  CYFD will establish the CYFD Category of Eligibility (COE) within 6-8 days of the \nchild being received into state custody to ensure timely entry into the Medicaid eligibility \nsystem. Currently, this process  takes up to  30 days, creating delays in  receipt of \neligibility information by the MCO and in facilitating an appointment for the Well-Child \nvisit. By July 1, 2023, CYFD will issue a clarifying email regarding its procedures which \nwill include the following: \n \n1.  CYFD staff will ensure that placements are opened for children within two business \ndays of entering custody; and \n2.  Once the placement is open, it will batch overnight and be sent to the tickler tab of \nthe IV-E Specialist the following morning to enter the COE determination and ensure \nMCO selection if not already made; and  \nOnce the determination is made, it takes 24-48 hours to batch and show the COE in the \nMedicaid portal.   \n3.  HSD will ensure that the MCOs review the enrollment data file uploaded by HSD \ndaily to identify each child entering a CYFD COE. (Per LOD-69-1) \n \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n21 \n\n  HSD will ensure that the MCOs contact the member’s assigned CYFD Permanency \nPlanning Worker (PPW) within three (3) business days of notification of the child’s \nenrollment and assign a care coordinator to engage with the child and/or the child’s team. \nThe MCO will request contact information for the child’s caregiver/resource parent, \nlegal  representative  (GAL/Youth  Attorney),  parent/guardian  and  legal  custodian \n(CYFD) during this contact. The CYFD PPW will provide all information to the MCO \nto ensure needed coordination with the persons necessary to accompany and attend the \nchild’s appointment. (Per LOD-69-1) \n \n  To ensure that the Well-Child visit is scheduled to occur within 30 days of entry into \nstate custody, HSD will require the MCO to utilize their internal resources, including the \nchild’s assigned care coordinator, a community health worker, a care worker, or a tribal \nliaison to ensure that the visit is scheduled in collaboration with the child and the child’s \nlegal custodian (CYFD PPW), caregiver/resource parent, and parent/guardian (where \nappropriate)  to  avoid  scheduling  conflicts  and  to  ensure  that  barriers  such  as \ntransportation and language access have been addressed.  Care coordination efforts will \nbe documented. \n \n  HSD will ensure that the MCOs document that the child’s legal custodian (CYFD PPW), \ncaregiver/resource  parent,  and  parent/guardian  (where  appropriate)  was  offered \neducation on the importance of the Well-Child visit and the availability of supports (such \nas transportation and translation services) to support appointment adherence. The CYFD \nPPW will ensure that all caregivers are aware of how to access MCO care coordination \nservices and of the availability of support through care coordination to schedule the \nWell-Child  visit.  The  MCO  and  CYFD  will  document  when  the  child  and/or \ncaregiver/resource parent is difficult to engage, refuses care coordination, and/or declines \nassistance with scheduling the appointment and all efforts to engage the child and/or \ncaregiver/resource parent The MCO and CYFD will also document instances in which the \nchild’s caregiver/resource parent is not able to make appointments within 30 days due \nto  a  scheduling  issue  in  the  household  and  will  document  all  efforts  made  to \naccommodate any such scheduling issue. HSD will issue a Letter of Direction to the \nMCOs regarding their obligations in this CAP by July 1, 2023.   \n \nWhen the child and/or the child’s caregiver/resource parent declines assistance with \nscheduling the appointment, the MCO will be required to follow up with the child and/or \nchild’s caregiver/resource parent within 10 days of the declination. If the appointment has \nstill not been scheduled, the MCO will once again offer assistance to the child and/or the \nchild’s caregiver/resource parent. \n \nHSD will ensure that the MCOs utilize available provider resources, including the \nchild’s Primary Care Provider (PCP), School Based Health Centers (SBHCs), Federally \nQualified Health Centers (FQHCs), Rural Health Clinic (RHCs), and/or tribal providers \nto schedule the comprehensive Well-Child visit. HSD will mandate that the MCOs \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n22 \n\npromptly reimburse providers in compliance with the timeline requirements within the \nMCO contract, section 4.19 Claims Management. and provide education and training to \nproviders to understand the requirement for a Well-Child visit within 30 days of entry \ninto state custody. HSD agrees to communicate this requirement through an LOD by \nJuly 1, 2023.  \nFor children who are in the fee-for-service (FFS) Medicaid program or for MCO enrolled children \nfor whom all provider options have been exhausted and after 21 days after entry into state custody \nan appointment has not been scheduled, HSD and CYFD will enter into a Memorandum of \nUnderstanding (MOU) to facilitate Well-Child visits so that the visit occurs within 30 days of the \nchild entering custody through public health offices at the Department of Health (DOH). The \nMOU will allow HSD, CYFD and the MCOs to work directly with DOH on facilitating Well-\nChild visits for children in state custody through Public Health Offices around the state.   \n \n  The State will come into full compliance with Target Outcome 4 (100% of children in \nstate custody receiving a Well-Child visit within 30 days) by January 1, 2024; this target \nis for remedial purposes and does not change the FSA deliverable date.  \n \nBy July 1, 2023, HSD will begin implementing the following validation protocol: \n1.  HSD will establish a process with the MCO care coordinators to collect information \nand report on completion of well-child visits for children. \n2.  CYFD will ensure case workers are entering completion of well-child visits in FACTS. \n3.  CYFD will run monthly reports on performance of completed well-child visits within \n30 days of children entering care beginning with all children who enter care on July 1, \n2023 and later. CYFD will spot check these reports for accuracy with the data provided \nby  HSD  from  care  coordinators.  For  the  purposes  of  ensuring  compliance,  the \nvalidation will not include any children in custody less than 30 days.  \n4.  By the 5th of the month following when well-child visits should occur for children \nnewly entering care, the State will provide monthly performance data which has \nundergone an initial QA check to the Co-Neutrals. For example, performance data for \nchildren who entered care in July 2023 will be provided on September 5, 2023, \nperformance data for children who entered care in August 2023 will be provided on \nOctober 5, 2023, and so on.  The final data submission will be provided on January 5, \n2024 for children who enter care in November 2023.  \n5.  The Co-Neutrals will request documentation verifying completion of a well-child visit \nfor a sample of 50% of children, but not more than 25 children. The State will provide \nthe requested information to the Co-Neutrals within 5 business days. Through the \nvalidation work, if the Co-Neutrals identify issues, they can request information for \nmore than 25 children in a month. The Co-Neutrals will share validation findings with \nthe State and Plaintiffs.   \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock, Case No. 1:18-cv-00896  Corrective Action Plan \n \nJune 30, 2023 \n23 \n\n  The State will ensure that all children who entered care before July 1, 2023 and are still \nin custody on September 15, 2023 have a completed well-child visit by September 15, \n2023. The Co-Neutrals will request documentation verifying completion of a well-child \nvisit for a sample of 10% of children in the pre-July 1, 2023 cohort. The Co-Neutrals will \nshare validation findings with the State and Plaintiffs.   \n \nIV. OTHER TERMS  \nNothing in this CAP shall preclude either Party from exercising their rights under the Agreement \nincluding, but not limited to, Plaintiffs' right to arbitrate any and all remaining unresolved issues \nand to secure any and all relief and remedies provided by the Agreement. \n \n     \nDated: 6/30/2023 By:   \nTeresa Casados, Interim Cabinet, Secretary] \nNEW MEXICO CHILDREN, YOUTH AND FAMILIES \nDEPARTMENT] \n \n \n     \n6/30/2023\nDated:  By:   \nKari Armijo, Acting Cabinet Secretary] \nNEW MEXICO HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT \n \n \n     \n6/30/2023\nDated:  By:   \nTara Ford \nPLAINTIFFS’ IMPLEMENTATION TEAM \n \n \nKevin S. v.

Exercise caution prior to clicking on\nlinks or opening attachments.\nAll,\nI am writing to initiate Step 1 of the dispute resolution process described in Section IX of the\nKevin S. Final Settlement Agreement (“Settlement Agreement”).  \nAt this time, Plaintiffs invoke the dispute resolution process with respect to each and every\nImplementation Target and Target Outcome validated by the Co-Neutrals in their November\n15, 2022 Report (“November 2022 Report”) with findings that HSD and CYFD failed to meet\nthe Performance Standard agreed to in the Settlement Agreement.  Plaintiffs’ position with\nrespect to each of these issues is that CYFD and HSD have not met their obligations under the\nSettlement Agreement.\nGiven the failure to meet the Performance Standard on over half of the Implementation\nTargets and total failure to meet the Performance Standard on every Target Outcome\nmeasured for the November 2022 Report, Plaintiffs’ position is that CYFD and HSD have\nfailed to adequately staff their efforts to meet their obligations under the Settlement\n\nAgreement. \nIn further support of Plaintiffs’ position that CYFD and HSD are not adequately staffed to\ncomply with their Kevin S. obligations, we note that Plaintiffs initiated Step 1 of the dispute\nresolution process on December 8, 2021 to address issues identified in the Co-Neutral’s 2021\nReport.  In June 2022, the Parties reached an Memorandum Of Understanding (“MOU”) to\nresolve many of the issues raised in the Plaintiffs’ December 8, 2021 dispute, yet CYFD and\n[1]\nHSD failed to fully implement the MOU with respect to several specific deliverables.  In\naddition, the Parties were unable to reach agreement on two key concepts related to the\nSettlement Agreement: 1) the requirement that there must be consideration of whether\ncommunity-based services had been or could be provided when determining medical\nnecessity; and 2) reaching an agreement on the definition of extraordinary circumstances.  The\nlack of agreement on these key concepts related to the Settlement Agreement and the areas of\nnon-compliance with the MOU are outstanding disputes and Plaintiffs reserve the right to seek\narbitration related to the December 8, 2021 notice of dispute.\nIt is Plaintiffs’ position that resolution of the issues in this dispute must prioritize and\nmeasurably address the four recommendations identified in the November 2022 Co-Neutral\nReport:\n(1)strengthening and stabilizing the CYFD and HSD workforce;\n(2)growing resource family placements;\n(3)expanding behavioral and mental health services; and\n(4)strengthening the collaboration and communication with New Mexico’s Nations, Pueblos,\nand Tribes.\nResolution will also require adequate staffing and management by HSD and CYFD of the\nobligations under the Agreement.  In addition, it is Plaintiffs’ position that HSD and CYFD\nneed to provide real time data to the Co-Neutrals for more frequent validated progress reports\nto enable the parties to timely monitor progress under the Settlement Agreement.\nWe are invoking the mediation process in hopes of reaching agreement among all Parties\nabout what steps CYFD and HSD will take to bring the agencies into compliance with their\nobligations under the Settlement Agreement. We will come prepared with proposals for a\ncorrective action plan and encourage all other Parties to do the same. \nBest, \nTara\nOn Behalf of the Kevin S.

Plaintiffs’ team \n \nVia electronic mail \nRe: Follow up from Co-Neutrals’ Site Visit   \nDear Acting Secretaries and Ms. Ford, \n \nThank you for meeting with us last week in New Mexico. Over the course of the week, we met \nwith CYFD caseworkers, supervisors and managers in Albuquerque and Santa Fe (including \nnumerous  personnel  also  covering  additional  CYFD  county  offices);  CYFD  staff  and \nsupervisors at the Receiving Center in Albuquerque; the Governor of the Taos Pueblo, his staff \nand CYFD and HSD leadership at the Santa Fe Indian School; the Lieutenant Governor of the \nLaguna Pueblo, his staff and CYFD and HSD leadership at the Laguna Pueblo; child behavioral \nhealth stakeholders; as well as the parties.  \n \nWe are appending our letter to the CYFD and HSD Secretaries of September 2022, in which we \nexpressed concerns about challenges we observed during our site visits in New Mexico last \nyear, including high CYFD staff caseloads, the agencies’ inadequate supply of family-based \nplacements and CYFD’s on-call system. In that letter, we made numerous recommendations, \nwhich we have discussed repeatedly with State leaders over the past year. To our dismay, across \nthe board, CYFD staff at all levels during our meetings last week described conditions in the \nCYFD offices as significantly worse than last year, in part due to the decision to pause most \nroutine hiring at CYFD for months. We were repeatedly and consistently told the result has been \nsubstantial  vacancies  across  the  agency  in  investigative  positions,  PPWs,  senior  workers, \nsupervisors  and  management  staff.  This  has  created  unreasonably  large  caseloads  among \ncaseworkers and supervisors with managers at multiple levels carrying caseloads as well.  \n \nHSD and CYFD staff and managers at all levels expressed to us their passion for the agencies’ \nmissions, as well as a commitment to the children and families of New Mexico. Because it was \nnot possible to proceed with the parties’ meeting last week, we want to convey to you directly \nthe feedback that we received during our recent meetings in New Mexico. The information is of \ndeep concern to us and includes conditions for children that are currently dangerous. \n \n\n September 18, 2023 \n Follow up from Co-Neutrals’ Site Visit \nPage 2 \nDuring our meetings, we learned: \n \n•  CYFD staff and managers at all levels consistently reported that conditions in the CYFD \noffices are significantly worse than last year, primarily due to exorbitant caseloads and \nsubstantial vacancies caused by attrition, insufficient hiring and numerous employees \ncurrently on Family and Medical Leave.  \n•  CYFD staff and managers at all levels reported that CYFD paused routine hiring of \nfrontline staff and supervisors across the state in May 2023. They described two CYFD \nrapid-hire events – one in May and one in August – but said the results of those events \ndid  not  keep  pace  with  attrition,  and  left  many  positions  vacant,  resulting  in  high \ncaseloads for caseworkers and supervisors that many described as “unprecedented” in \ntheir experience at CYFD. We were told the rapid hire events did not include supervisors \nand senior workers.  \n•  For  example,  CYFD  staff  reported  to  us  that  as  of  this  week,  there  is  no  PPW \ncaseworker  in  CYFD’s  Santa  Fe  Office.  One  investigator  reported  51  open  child \nabuse/neglect investigations, including six new cases assigned the morning we met.  \n•  Because of substantial vacancies, all the CYFD county office managers with whom we \nmet  described  serving  as  the  primary  caseworker  for  between  25  and  40  children \ncurrently. These case assignments, we were told, in numerous instances do not appear in \nthe agency’s data reports. In our work with other states, we have never seen so many \nchildren’s cases being managed directly by supervisors and county managers. \n•  CYFD  supervisors  and  managers  reported  that  CYFD  essentially  stopped  hiring \nsupervisors and senior staff in May 2023, and did not include these positions in the \nagency’s August 2023 rapid-hire event, despite pervasive supervisor and senior staff \nvacancies. They reported the vacancies have deprived many caseworkers of adequate \nsupervision and support and some workers currently have no direct supervisors.  \n•  The remaining CYFD supervisors with whom we spoke reported they directly carry \nmany children’s cases, without exception, and expressed concern that they have been \nunable  to  supervise  their  staff  appropriately  due  to  burgeoning  workloads.  Many \ndescribed their jobs as “impossible” because of the large number of staff they are \nassigned to supervise and the substantial number of children whose cases they are \ndirectly managing.  \n•  At  least  eight  CYFD  employees  –  both  managers  and  staff  – indicated  they  have \nprepared  their  resignations  and  are  currently  discerning  whether  to  terminate  their \nemployment with CYFD because of the conditions that had worsened since May 2023. \nThey report that they have stayed because of their commitment to their colleagues and \ntheir desire to not make things even more difficult for them.  \n•  The lack of staffing is exacerbated by the requirements for additional on-call work. \nMany  CYFD  caseworkers  and  supervisors  are  required  to  work  “on-call”  shifts \novernight, and inadequate staffing means many of them do so numerous times per \n \n\n September 18, 2023 \n Follow up from Co-Neutrals’ Site Visit \nPage 3 \nmonth. The on-call assignments require staff and supervisors to respond to emergencies \novernight then report to work the next morning. The result in multiple instances was \nreported to be caseworkers and supervisors going without sleep for more than 24 hours, \nseveral times per month, including in some instances during extensive drives when they \nare forced to transport children because of a lack of transportation aides. This practice is \na serious safety concern. Many CYFD staff and supervisors said the practice had led \nnumerous colleagues to resign since May 2023. \n•  CYFD staff reported to us that vacancies and insufficient hiring in Albuquerque have \nalso resulted in many CYFD caseworkers and supervisors being required to monitor \nchildren in offices because of a lack of safe placements for children and/or older youth’s \nreported refusal of placements. They feel untrained to take on these direct caregiving \nresponsibilities and are frequently in situations where they feel unsupported and unsafe.  \n•  Because of staffing shortages, CYFD staff and supervisors reported a significant backlog \nof legally free children in pre-adoptive homes for whom permanency is stalled because \nCYFD staff have been unable to complete the disclosures necessary to advance the case.  \n•  CYFD staff, supervisors and managers at all levels reported that staff shortages had \nworsened communication with relative and non-relative caregivers, and contributed to \nfamilies choosing to close their homes over the past several months, worsening the \nshortage of family-based placements. Several tribal representatives with whom we met \nalso described poor communication with staff in CYFD offices, citing unreturned phone \ncalls and emails due to staffing shortages.  \n•  CYFD staff and managers in Albuquerque reported that one of the most significant \nproviders of behavioral health services to children in Bernalillo County had notified the \nState it was closing at the end of this month. CYFD staff and managers said there is no \nplan in place to transition children in custody to new providers and they were unaware \nof  HSD,  the  MCOs  or  the  CBHC  playing  any  visible  role  to  prevent  a  cutoff  in \nbehavioral health services to children in state custody as a result of the closure.  \n•  CYFD staff reported a backlog for families awaiting home studies in order to become \nresource parents. Some CYFD staff said they understood the contract for the vendor who \ntrains CYFD staff to conduct home studies, Children’s Consortium, had not been timely \nrenewed  by  CYFD  in  July  2023.  Numerous  other  CYFD  staff  and  managers  in \nAlbuquerque reported that one of CYFD’s private vendors, All Faiths, told CYFD staff \nthat it could not accept new home study referrals in September due to volume. At least \none staff reported they have been assigned to complete home studies for new families \nbut they have not received specialized training to do so. \n•  CYFD staff who are assigned to recruit families as resource caregivers said they lacked \nresources and an overall strategy to do the work effectively, and in any event, many said \nthe CYFD offices had become so consumed by rising caseloads that they have shifted \ntheir focus to include helping their colleagues manage children’s cases. They felt that \n \n\n September 18, 2023 \n Follow up from Co-Neutrals’ Site Visit \nPage 4 \neven if they identified willing families, there were insufficient staff to conduct home \nstudies and complete licensure for them.  \n•  CYFD managers reported that a major reorganization of CYFD is scheduled to take \neffect at the end of the month, but they were unaware of a communication strategy to \ninform frontline employees of the changes. Among the CYFD staff at all levels with \nwhom we spoke, there is widespread confusion about the nature of the reorganization, its \npurpose, the timing of the personnel shifts and its intended impact.  \n•  Because the CYFD supervisors and county managers with whom we spoke are carrying \na diverse portfolio of children’s cases (e.g., Investigations, PPW, Placement and In \nHome) they assumed they would have to continue to do so regardless of what, if any, \nnew role they were assigned as part of the reorganization. \n•  Many  CYFD  caseworkers  and  supervisors,  in  particular,  expressed  confusion  and \nanxiety about the reorganization, unsure of what it meant. We learned from several \nCYFD  managers  that  the  reorganization  will  move  primary  case  management  for \nadoption cases from Placement staff to PPW staff, but none of the Placement and PPW \nstaff with whom we met were aware of that possible shift. Some of the CYFD managers \nexpressed concern to us that shifting this responsibility for primary case management of \nadoption cases to PPW staff, although theoretically a positive change, in the midst of the \ncurrent staffing shortages would worsen conditions in the offices. \n•  CYFD staff and managers at all levels consistently said that once the agency begins to \nhire staff and supervisors routinely again, it will take a while to recover from the hiring \npause. They acknowledged the state hiring process, the schedule for New Employee \nTraining  and  graduated  caseloads,  which  is  an  essential  retention  strategy,  meant \nmeaningful caseload relief for incumbent CYFD caseworkers, supervisors and managers \nwas unlikely before 2024.  \n•  CYFD staff and managers at all levels described substantial service gaps for children, \nparticularly behavioral health services, and with few exceptions, did not describe any \nmeaningful assistance in their cases from HSD or the MCOs.  \n \nLast year we described to the Parties a system that was in crisis. This year, based on reports \nfrom scores of CYFD employees at all levels and key stakeholders with whom we met, we \nbelieve the system is in a state of chaos. Positions are pervasively vacant in CYFD due to \nattrition, and numerous staff are reported to be on Family and Medical leaves due to job stress. \nSupervisors and managers are acting out of role, directly managing children’s cases. They \ndescribe doing their very best, but the reality leaves them too little time for actual supervision of \nstaff, many of whom are reportedly resigning before their first anniversary because of poor \nwork conditions. Resource families are closing their homes, reportedly in numerous instances \ndue to poor communication with overwhelmed caseworkers and supervisors. At the same time, \na reported backlog of new (kin and non-relative) families awaiting home studies grows. A \nmounting number of children and families ready for adoption reportedly await the completion \n \n\n September 18, 2023 \n Follow up from Co-Neutrals’ Site Visit \nPage 5 \nof their case disclosures; CYFD staffing shortages are stalling permanency cases. And some \ninvestigators are assigned dangerously high caseloads, unable to keep up with the crush of \nwork. From the many consistent reports we received, the situation is worse than last year, \ndeteriorating, and requires effective immediate action to protect children’s safety. \n \nLast year we made numerous recommendations to the agencies (see attached) and we restate \nthose here because they remain critical opportunities to establish stability in order to advance \nthe Kevin S. commitments. We urge the State first and foremost to take every reasonable step as \nurgently as possible to ensure adequate staffing and repair conditions in the CYFD offices. In \naddition,  we  recommend  CYFD  quickly  retain  a  group  of  temporary  workers,  perhaps \nexperienced retirees as other states have done, to move permanency cases toward adoption \nfinalization by completing backlogged disclosures, and hire staff specifically for the CYFD on-\ncall system as other states have done. \n \nThank you again for your time last week. We are available to meet with you to discuss ideas for \ndealing with this emergency. \n \n \nSincerely, \n                                       \nJudith Meltzer     Kevin Ryan       \nCenter for the Study     Public Catalyst      \nof Social Policy             \n                 \n \ncc:   Julie Sakura, General Counsel, CYFD \nJohn Emery, Acting General Counsel, HSD  \nAlex Castillo Smith, Deputy Cabinet Secretary, HSD \nGovernor Perez, Special Projects Coordinator, CYFD \nFarra Fong, Deputy Director, Fostering Connections Bureau, CYFD \nJennifer Archuleta-Earp, Program Deputy Director, CYFD \n  Sarah Meadows, Performance and Accountability, CYFD \nBianca Foppert, Change Implementation Coordinator, CYFD \nSally Jameson, Project Manager, Office of the Secretary, HSD \n \n \nAttachment  \n \n\nEXHIBIT D \n   \n\n \n \n \nJanuary 26, 2024 \n \nCabinet Secretary Teresa Casados  \nNew Mexico Children, Youth, and Families Department  \n \nCabinet Secretary Kari Armijo  \nNew Mexico Human Services Department  \n \nTara Ford \nKevin S. Plaintiffs’ team \n \nVia electronic mail \nRe: Follow up from Co-Neutrals’ Site Visit   \nDear Secretaries and Ms. Ford, \nWe are glad to have had the opportunity to meet with you while we were in New Mexico. Over \nthe course of the week, we and our teams met with many CYFD caseworkers, supervisors and \nmanagers in the Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Las Vegas, Dona Ana, Roswell, San Juan, McKinley, \nand Valencia offices; CYFD staff and supervisors at the Receiving Center in Albuquerque; the \nGovernor and staff of one Pueblo and leaders from other Pueblos; other community members, \nincluding behavioral health stakeholders; and the Kevin S. lawsuit parties. We found staff at all \nlevels to be candid in their conversations. Given that Secretary Casados and CYFD leadership \nvisited  many  of  the  same  offices  that  we  did  earlier  this  month,  we  believe  many  of  the \nobservations that we outline in this letter will not be surprising.   \nWe had hoped when undertaking these visits to county offices, four months after our last site \nvisits, that we would see evidence of improvement. However, what we heard and observed was \nto the contrary; we heard about deteriorating conditions and crisis situations in most of the \noffices we visited. In our assessment, the issues we identified in our September 2023 letter \nremain and, for the most part, there has been little to no progress in addressing them. Last year \nthe parties engaged in extensive discussions to reach agreement on a Corrective Action Plan \n(CAP) designed to address many of the problems we identified last year and in 2022. The State’s \nweak performance implementing many aspects of the CAP  – for example, with respect to \ncaseloads and focused resource family recruitment – appears to have worsened the situation. We \nplan to send you an updated memo on the CAP next month after we have completed our \nassessment  of  additional  data  and  information.  But  we  do  not  want  to  wait  until  then  to \ncommunicate to you our understanding that there currently exist serious risks to child and staff \nsafety, as we underscored when we spoke with you on January 18, 2024. \n \n\n \n \nJanuary 26, 2024 \nFollow up from Co-Neutrals’ Site Visit \nPage 2 \nThere are areas where we think there is some positive momentum. Implementation of the pilot in \nDona Ana is on track. In comparison to other CYFD offices visited, Dona Ana’s staffing, \nalthough incomplete, appears more stable than other CYFD offices.  Our on-site validation of \ncaseload data with CYFD staff supported our view that while the work is not complete, the State \nis making real improvements in the accuracy of caseload data. Also, the continuing work to \nlisten to and engage with Tribal and Pueblo leaders and staff is beginning to make a difference in \nincreased trust and better working relationships with the Nations, Pueblos, and Tribes, based on \nthe feedback we heard. There remains a lot of work to be done in both of these areas, but \nconstructive work has started.  \nSimilar to our prior visits, we again encountered CYFD staff who were committed and dedicated \nto their jobs and to the children and families they serve, and who are waiting for vacancies to be \nfilled and resources to be provided as anticipated in CYFD’s implementation of its Workforce \nDevelopment Plan. In most sites, there was a sense of camaraderie among staff units, although \nmany staff, supervisors, and managers reported that the restructuring that occurred in October \n2023 has caused divisions and silos to emerge or deepen. \nWhen we met with the parties on January 18, 2024, we provided a general verbal summary of \nour observations. We have outlined below more specific information.   \n \nCaseloads and Staffing \n•  Prior to our meetings in New Mexico, we worked with CYFD’s data staff to assess worker \nlevel caseload data as of January 5, 2024. We frequently shared this information with staff in \nthe county offices that we visited, and often found that the data on current caseloads were \naccurate.  \n•  We heard that CYFD managers and supervisors in most of the offices we visited continue to \ncarry cases, which is sometimes reflected in the data.  \n•  Seven  investigative  staff  in  Bernalillo  County  reported  responsibility  for  over  40 \ninvestigations each, including two who reported their caseloads as over 120 investigations.  \nSeveral  days  before  our  visit,  three  investigators  had  departed  the  agency,  leaving  376 \ninvestigations to be newly re-assigned to investigators, supervisors, and managers, many of \nwhom already manage unreasonably high caseloads. \n•  We also learned that there is a backlog of over 2,000 investigations in CYFD’s Metro and \nNortheast regions that are in various stages of inquiry and decision-making. Some of the \npending investigations, we were told, date back to the first half of 2023. Staff in one office \nreported there are numerous investigations where children have never been seen by CYFD \neven  after  the  agency  determined  that  a  report  of  alleged  abuse  or  neglect  warranted \ninvestigation. This is a clear and urgent safety risk for children.  \n \n\n \n \nJanuary 26, 2024 \nFollow up from Co-Neutrals’ Site Visit \nPage 3 \n \n•  Most CYFD supervisors and new staff were unaware of the graduated caseload standards and \nhow  they  should  be  implemented.  Given  the  crisis  situation  in  most  offices,  there  are \npowerful incentives to ignore the graduated caseload standards.  \n•  CYFD managers, supervisors, and staff across the state repeatedly reported that the agency’s \nmonths-long hiring freeze in 2023 worsened staffing levels among positions that are essential \nto the work of the agency, regardless of organizational structure, such as investigators, PPWs, \nand placement staff. Staff turnover and the number of vacancies continue to be very high, \nplacing a consistent strain on current staff. Some of the staff, supervisors, and managers with \nwhom we spoke reported they are planning their own retirements and resignations in the near \nfuture which will create yet more vacancies that need to be filled.  \n \nWorkforce Support  \n•  Although CYFD re-commenced hiring staff in September 2023, many staff and supervisors \nreported the training academy was not able to accommodate the influx of workers needing \nNew Employee Training, which created delays in new staff receiving training, and in turn, \ntheir ability to begin assisting with caseload assignments. Some workers reported waiting \nover a month. \n•  Many CYFD managers are stretched unreasonably thin, with lengthy travel now required in \nmany instances in order to provide support and supervision to the staff they manage across \ndifferent and distant counties in the new pillar system. In some cases, managers serve as the \ninterim supervisor for vacant supervisor positions although their responsibilities span several \noffices. The need for supervisors (and managers serving as proxy supervisors) to sign off on \ndecisions, guide case direction, and/or participate in required staffings has caused further \ndelays in closing investigations and moving children toward permanency, whether it be \nreunification or adoption.  \n•  Most  CYFD  staff  reported  feeling  supported  by  their  supervisors.  Others  reported  they \neffectively do not have a supervisor because the position is vacant and a manager is filling in \nas supervisor but is seldom available because of their new managerial responsibilities over \nother counties in the pillar system.  \n•  Some CYFD staff have received promotions to supervisory positions but they reported they \nwere  not  provided  with  supervisory  training  to  prepare  them  for  their  new  role  and \nresponsibilities.  \n•  Some CYFD workers reported that they received training on recognizing and responding to \ntrauma in children, but they reported feeling that the stress and trauma they are experiencing \n \n\n \n \nJanuary 26, 2024 \nFollow up from Co-Neutrals’ Site Visit \nPage 4 \n– particularly with respect to critical incidents in the CYFD offices and unreasonably high \ncaseloads – have gone unrecognized by leadership.  \n•  CYFD staff in one office reported no longer receiving reimbursement for mileage when they \nutilize their own cars to transport children or drive to/from visits.  \n•  There was a reported change in the process for staff in one office to request and receive \novertime compensation, but this has not been clearly communicated to CYFD workers.  \n•  The on-call requirement for CYFD’s case-carrying staff in most offices was viewed by \nalmost every worker as untenable and not sustainable. The frequency with which it occurs \nand the hours that it involves result in CYFD staff reporting that they get little to no sleep \nbefore the following workday when they are required to show up at the beginning of their \nshifts. Although the pillar system focuses on specialization, CYFD’s legacy on-call system \ndoes not. In most of the CYFD offices we visited, investigators, PPWs, and placement staff \nare required to work on-call shifts. PPW and placement supervisors and staff reported they \nare routinely working out of their pillar practice areas to conduct and oversee investigations \nduring on-call shifts, but without sufficient training. New CYFD staff reported they receive \nlittle training for on-call assignments to respond to investigations after hours (sometimes only \ntwo instances of observing investigative staff) and many reported feeling unprepared when \nthey are required to respond to investigate allegations of abuse and neglect during their \nmandatory on-call shift.  \n \nOffice Stays and Child Safety  \n•  CYFD  personnel  reported  that  children’s  stays  within  the  Roswell,  Las  Vegas,  and \nAlbuquerque offices have occurred consistently for more than a year. Staff reported they are \nmandated to work shifts to provide supervision for children in the offices, many of whom \nprovide  serious  emotional,  medical,  and  behavioral  challenges  that  CYFD  staff  are  not \nprepared to handle. In Roswell, this has resulted in repeated calls to law enforcement to assist \nin  managing  youth’s  behaviors.  Staff  reported  not  receiving  the  necessary  training  to \nadminister medication to children, which staff described as unsafe and extremely stressful.  \nSome CYFD offices are currently using temporary workers or contracted aides to assist staff \nwith supervising children, however, it does not appear that these staff have been provided \nwith adequate training on trauma, behavior management, medication management, and how \nto de-escalate behaviors when conflicts or crises occur. In Roswell, CYFD staff frequently \nrespond by calling law enforcement and transferring children to hospital emergency rooms.  \n•  In CYFD offices where staff are repeatedly responsible for supervising children who are \nsleeping overnight in offices, the staff report not feeling safe. In reviewing critical incident \nreports provided by CYFD over the last six months in addition to what we heard from staff \n \n\n \n \nJanuary 26, 2024 \nFollow up from Co-Neutrals’ Site Visit \nPage 5 \nduring our meetings, we believe there are conditions now that are unsafe for children and \nunsafe for staff.   \n•  CYFD managers, supervisors, and staff repeatedly reported that office stays are a direct result \nof New Mexico not having developed an appropriate and adequate array of community-based \nplacements and services.  \n \nResource Family Recruitment and Retention  \n•  In every CYFD office we visited, we were unable to identify a staff person who is singularly \nor mainly charged with recruitment of non-relative resource homes and has the time and \nresources to perform that function. Implementation of county-based recruitment plans is not \nwell  organized  or  proactive.  We  were  told  that  when  resource  family  recruitment  is \ndiscussed, it is during ad-hoc meetings among existing investigative, PPW, and placement \nstaff at the county offices as an additional piece of work. Staff pervasively reported that there \nis no funding available for resource family recruitment activities.  \n•  Many CYFD staff and supervisors told us they did not learn that their offices had a 2023 \nrecruitment target for resource families until the Fall of last year. \n•  Given children’s office stays, placement challenges, and other demands on too few workers, \nthere continues to be a lack of focus on retention of resource parents.  \n•  Babies and infants are being placed at the Receiving Center – some for more than a week – \nreflecting a significant and unacceptable deficiency in the pool of available resource homes.  \n•  Adoption specialist positions have been eliminated in some counties, leaving no local staff \nresponsible and available for recruiting adoptive families for legally free children except for \nPPWs who are already overburdened with high caseloads and other responsibilities.  \n \nAccess to Community-based Services \n•  The  lack  of  access  to  community-based  services  to  support  families  and  treat  children \nremains a pressing need. We rarely heard staff identify community-based services that were \nreadily available and accessible to the children and families with whom they work. CYFD \npersonnel reported long wait lists for services ranging from well-child medical check-ups to \nmedication management. Some counties had no providers for specific services necessary to \nmeet children’s needs. We were told that TFC placements within New Mexico are so difficult \nto obtain that staff in one office reported having to contact other states for this level of \nservice. \n \n\n \n \nJanuary 26, 2024 \nFollow up from Co-Neutrals’ Site Visit \nPage 6 \n•  CYFD staff reported frequently not knowing who to ask for help in securing resources, a \nproblem that is currently more pronounced due to the reorganization. As staff roles have \nchanged, workers are unclear how to get help in their efforts to help families. \n \nOffice Morale and Culture  \n•  Across the board, CYFD staff feel stressed by unreasonable expectations, frustrated by the \nlack of services and resources, angry at unreasonably high caseloads, often fearful about \nchildren’s office stays and the safety of children they are unable to visit or see due to their \ncaseloads, and unsupported by leadership.  \n•  There is widespread confusion about CYFD’s reorganization by staff at all levels. According \nto  most  of the  CYFD  staff  who  spoke  with  us,  this  change  felt  abrupt  and  with  little \ncommunication or clarity. Staff reported a continued lack of communication over roles and \nresponsibilities  which  is  exacerbating  staff’s  feelings  of  not  being  heard  or  supported. \nWorkers reported that it has resulted in, or deepened, silos within offices and an erosion of \nteamwork.  \n•  CYFD staff salaries were assessed late last year, and in some cases adjusted in a positive \ndirection though not by an amount that has made much of a difference to workers given the \nreported uptick in benefits costs to staff. Staff also reported that the criteria used to make \nsalary adjustment determinations were not transparent or clearly communicated to staff. As \nthe 10 percent pay raise that occurred at the beginning of last year was eliminated once the \nsalaries were adjusted, some staff reported the amount in their paycheck actually decreased.  \n•  CYFD staff reported again about the inequity in pay band classification with PPW positions \nreceiving the lowest pay. Given the centrality of the PPW position, workers and managers \nbelieve there should be parity across pay bands. Many staff said such parity would be fair \ngiven the demands and skills required for the different jobs, and would reduce what is viewed \nas  excessive  movement  between  staff  positions  –  from  PPW  roles  to  investigation  or \nplacement staff positions.  \n \nNeed for Immediate Action  \nWe understand that CYFD leadership is committed to hiring additional staff through rapid-hire \nevents and other staff recruitment strategies. However, based on what we learned during our \nmeetings in New Mexico, we believe leadership must take immediate and extraordinary steps to \nstabilize the conditions in many of the CYFD offices we visited. The unsafe backlog of child \nabuse and neglect investigations requires the deployment of new, additional resources, such as \ncontracting with retirees and deploying trained staff and managers from CYFD’s central team. \nExorbitant caseloads and very high staff turnover warrant hiring goals and performance that are \nat  least  25  percent  greater  than  the  number  of  investigator,  PPW,  and  placement  positions \n \n\n \n \nJanuary 26, 2024 \nFollow up from Co-Neutrals’ Site Visit \nPage 7 \ncurrently assessed to be needed. Like other States across the nation that have undertaken the \ninitial phase of systemic reform in the face of crushing caseloads, New Mexico needs to over-\nhire in order to account for continuing turnover. An influx of new workers requires the State to \nexpand its training capacity and ensure that new personnel can expeditiously begin the process of \nonboarding and training. We have made these and other recommendations previously, and we are \nhappy to discuss them with you. In sum, the agency must begin acting like there is in fact a crisis \nthat threatens children’s safety and compels new, urgent, barrier-breaking activity.  \n \nThank you again for your time last week. We look forward to meeting with you to discuss ideas \nfor dealing with these issues that require immediate action.  \n \nSincerely, \n                                       \nJudith Meltzer     Kevin Ryan       \nCenter for the Study     Public Catalyst      \nof Social Policy             \n                 \n \ncc:   Julie Sakura, General Counsel, CYFD \nMark Reynolds, Chief General Counsel, HSD  \nAlex Castillo Smith, Deputy Cabinet Secretary, HSD \nMark Velarde, PS Director, CYFD \nFarra Fong, Deputy Director, CYFD \nJennifer Archuleta-Earp, Program Deputy Director, CYFD \n  Sarah Meadows, Performance and Accountability, CYFD \n  Kathy Kunkel, Consultant, CYFD and HSD \nBianca Foppert, Change Implementation Coordinator, CYFD \nSally Jameson, Project Manager, Office of the Secretary, HSD \n \n\nEXHIBIT E \n   \n\n \n \nFebruary 23, 2024 \n \nCabinet Secretary Teresa Casados  \nNew Mexico Children, Youth, and Families Department  \n \nCabinet Secretary Kari Armijo  \nNew Mexico Human Services Department  \n \nTara Ford \nKevin S. Plaintiffs’ team \n \nVia Electronic Mail \n \nRe: Kevin S., et al. v. Blalock et al.  \nCo-Neutrals’ Corrective Action Plan (CAP) Implementation Memorandum \n \nOn June 30, 2023, the Parties to Kevin S., et al v. Blalock signed a negotiated Corrective Action \nPlan (CAP)1 that includes strategies deemed necessary to implement the Kevin S. Final Settlement \nAgreement (FSA).2 Specifically, the CAP “…sets forth the commitments that CYFD and HSD \nagree to undertake to come into compliance with the Agreement between the Parties and to ensure \nthat children currently in state custody are able to benefit from the State’s commitments as \noutlined in the Agreement.” Additionally, “[t]he Parties have jointly agreed that the commitments \noutlined in the CAP are necessary and will be undertaken in the time set forth in the CAP to \nimprove the State’s ability to comply with its commitments. The Parties agree that this CAP shall \nexpire on January 5, 2024.” \nThis memorandum was prepared by the Kevin S. Co-Neutrals to provide information on the State’s \nimplementation  of  select  CAP  commitments  for  which  the  State  has  provided  data  and/or \ninformation to the Co-Neutrals. The Co-Neutrals have prepared this memorandum to ensure that \ncertain relevant and current information is available to the Parties to inform their ongoing \ndiscussions about progress in Kevin S. \nThe preliminary analyses in this memorandum are based on data provided by CYFD and HSD. \nThe  Co-Neutrals  gathered  additional  information  during  discussions  with  the  Parties,  key \nstakeholders, and CYFD staff during meetings in New Mexico in September 2023 and January \n2024.  The  Co-Neutrals  do  not  make  any  judgments  regarding  FSA  Performance  Standard \nachievement within this memorandum; those judgments are reserved for the Co-Neutrals’ Annual \nReport, which is due on November 15, 2024. Additionally, as the data analysis included in this \nmemorandum is based upon preliminary data submissions by the State, most data have not yet \n \n1 The Kevin S. CAP can be found here. \n2 The Kevin S. FSA can be found here. \n\nFebruary 23, 2024      \nCo-Neutrals’ CAP \nImplementation Memorandum  \n \nbeen validated by the Co-Neutrals. Wherever possible, the Co-Neutrals in this memorandum used \nmethodologies  consistent  with  the  approved  Data  Validation  Plan  (DVP),3  although  some \ndifferences between the structure and content of the preliminary data and the State’s annual data \nprevented uniform application. Wherever methodologies varied, this memorandum describes the \nlimitation that led to the discrepancy and provides detail of the approach applied in this analysis.  \nIn this memorandum, the following CAP provisions are discussed:  \n•  CYFD Workforce Caseloads (FSA BTO10) \n•  Family Based Placements (FSA BTO6)  \n•  Treatment Foster Care (FSA BTO6) \n•  Behavioral Health Services (FSA DTO3)  \n•  Critical Incident Review (FSA BTO2, 3, 4) \n•  Joint Powers Agreement and Tribal Resources (FSA Appendix C) \n•  Well-Child Visits (FSA DTO4)  \n•  Data Submissions \nIn each section, the Co-Neutrals summarize the CAP commitments and provide the most recent \ndata available to assess progress on that commitment.  \nFor a number of CAP commitments – for example, including but not limited to, implementation \nof pilots for coordinated action within local communities and follow up to the Appendix C Tribal \nListening Session – the State and/or Co-Neutrals have previously reported information related to \nimplementation with the Parties; thus, discussion of these are not included in this memorandum.  \n \n1.  CYFD Workforce Caseloads (FSA BTO10)  \nCAP Commitments:  \na.  By December 31, 2023, no Investigation Case, Permanency Planning, In-Home \nServices, or Placement worker will have over 200% of the applicable caseload \nstandards documented in the 2023 Data Validation Plan approved by the Co-\nNeutrals, including trainees with graduated caseloads.  \nb.  By December 31, 2023, no supervisor will be carrying any cases.  \nc.  Monthly data reports with data elements agreed to by the Co-Neutrals will be made \navailable to Co-Neutrals, which the Co-Neutrals may validate. \n \n \n \n3 The Kevin S. DVP can be found here. \n2 \n \n\nFebruary 23, 2024      \nCo-Neutrals’ CAP \nImplementation Memorandum  \n \nData and Discussion:  \nThe State provided the Co-Neutral team with a list of all individuals assigned as primary worker \non at least one case as of January 5, 2024. The DVP defines case-assignable workers as, “staff with \nany of the following titles – Investigation Case Worker, Permanency Planning Worker, In-Home \nServices Provider, or Placement Worker – who have completed New Employee Training (NET) \nand are eligible for case assignments.”4 Individuals with supervisory and managerial titles are not \ncase-assignable, nor are staff with titles such as “Investigations Case Aide,” “Kinship Specialist,” \nand other positions that do not typically require case-carrying duties.5 \nAs defined in the CYFD Workforce Development Plan (WDP),6 Investigations Case Workers may \nbe assigned as primary workers for a maximum of 12 investigations; Permanency Planning \nWorkers (PPW) for a maximum of 15 children; In-Home Services Workers for a maximum of eight \ncases; and Placement Workers for a maximum of either 15 adoption cases, 20 licensed families, or \n15 home studies.  \nThe WDP also prescribes graduated caseloads for case-assignable workers who have recently \ncompleted NET, such that the maximum number of investigations or permanency cases an \nindividual may be assigned as a primary worker depends on the number of months since the worker \ncompleted NET.7,8 Per the methodology agreed upon in the DVP, the applicable caseload standard \nfor individuals with mixed caseloads weights each case according to its type (e.g., an investigations \ncase counts as one-twelfth or 8% of the standard, a child in a permanency case counts as one-\nfifteenth or 7% of the standard, and so on).  \n \n4 DVP p. 6. \n5 DVP pgs. 99-100. \n6 CYFD’s WDP can be found here. \n7 The State agreed that in the first two months after completing NET, a worker cannot be assigned as primary for any \ninvestigation case but can be assigned as primary for up to five permanency cases. In the third and fourth months after \nNET, a worker can be assigned as primary for up to three investigations cases or eight permanency cases. In the fifth \nand sixth months after NET, a worker can be assigned as primary for up to six investigations cases or 12 permanency \ncases. After the sixth month following NET completion, a worker is eligible for full caseloads. There is no graduated \ncaseload standard for placement or in-home services. \n8 The data the State submitted did not include a NET completion date for 268 of the 364 individuals assigned as \nprimary on at least one case. Of these 268, 200 are in case-assignable roles. Individuals in case-assignable roles are \nonly eligible for case assignment after completing NET, and the graduated caseload period is calculated from the NET \ncompletion date. Therefore, the Co-Neutrals cannot determine with certainty which and how many primary cases an \nindividual in a case-assignable role is eligible to carry without knowing the date of NET completion. \n3 \n \n\nFebruary 23, 2024      \nCo-Neutrals’ CAP \nImplementation Memorandum  \n \nAccording to data submitted by CYFD,9 there were 364 CYFD staff assigned as a primary worker \nto at least one case as of January 5, 2024.10 As summarized in Table 1: \n•  23 percent of these individuals had caseloads compliant with the applicable caseload \nstandards as defined in the CYFD WDP; \n•  34 percent had caseloads above the applicable standard, including 19 percent (70) of \ncase-assignable workers whose caseloads were above 200 percent of the standard, the \ncommitment set forth in the CAP.11 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9 The State submitted data from three sources. Primary case assignments for January 5, 2024 were from FACTS data \n(CYFD’s system of record). The position titles and start dates of individuals were from CYFD’s Human Resources \nsystem (SHARE). NET completion dates for individuals were from Cornerstone (an online training platform). The \nState completed a name match to link the SHARE and Cornerstone data to the FACTS assignment data. The State was \nnot able to find a current match in SHARE for 15 workers who were assigned as primary on at least one case on \nJanuary 5, 2024; in the data submitted to the Co-Neutrals, six individuals were listed as “Termination,” four were \nlisted as “No longer with Agency,” two as “Temp,” and three as “Not found.” \n10 Excludes 15 workers who were assigned as primary workers but did not appear in CYFD’s Human Resources system \n(SHARE) as current staff on January 5, 2024. \n11 For this analysis, the Co-Neutrals assumed that case-assignable workers missing a NET completion date who were \nhired in 2021 or later and did not have a senior job title (e.g., “Investigations Senior Case Worker” or “Permanency \nPlanning Senior Worker”) (n = 81) had not completed NET and were thus ineligible to carry cases. If a case-assignable \nworker missing a NET completion date had a senior job title (n = 79), or they had a non-senior job title but were hired \nbefore 2021 (n = 40), they were assumed to be eligible to carry a full caseload. The year 2021 was selected as the \ncutoff for these assumptions because in 2021 the DVP was finalized, and the Co-Neutrals and the State reached \nagreement on caseload standards and the commitment that workers needed to complete NET before being assigned \nany cases.  \n4 \n \n\nFebruary 23, 2024      \nCo-Neutrals’ CAP \nImplementation Memorandum  \n \nTable 1: Count of Individuals Assigned as Primary on Any Case,  \nby Compliance with Caseload Standard12 \n   N  % \nIndividuals assigned as primary on any case  364    \nTotal caseload compliant w. standard  82  23% \n0-50%        33  9% \n51-100%        49  13% \nTotal caseload above standard  124  34% \n101-200%     54  15% \n201-400%     54  15% \n+400%        16  4% \nIneligible for assignment  158  43% \nIneligible - new hire (with NET)  4  1% \nIneligible - hired after 2020 (no NET)  81  22% \nIneligible - role     73  20% \nSource: Analysis of data submitted by CYFD on January 12, 2024. \nForty-six (13%) of the 364 individuals assigned as primary worker on at least one case on \nJanuary 5, 2024 were supervisors, 27 others were in a non-case-assignable role,13 and another \n81 (22%) appear to be ineligible to carry cases because there was no record in the submitted \ndata that they completed NET.14 Another four individuals were assigned as primary worker on \nat least one investigation, but had completed NET within the two months before January 5, 2024, \nand were therefore ineligible for case assignment per the State’s graduated caseload standard.  \n \n \n \n \n \n12 This table reflects the analytic assumptions described in footnote 11. To assess the sensitivity of findings to the \nspecific assumptions, the Co-Neutrals calculated compliance using a range of assumptions. Under the most stringent \nassumptions – that individuals with no record of NET completion who were hired after 2020, regardless of their job \ntitle, are ineligible to carry cases – 20 percent of individuals had caseloads compliant with the standard, while 27 \npercent had caseloads above the standard, including 16 percent whose caseloads were above 200 percent of the \nstandard. Under more flexible assumptions – that all individuals with missing NET dates completed NET on their date \nof hire – 32 percent of individuals had caseloads compliant with the standard, while 46 percent had caseloads above \nthe standard, including 25 percent whose caseloads were above 200 percent of the standard.  \n13 Supervisory and managerial titles are not case-assignable, nor are titles such as “Investigations Case Aide,” “Kinship \nSpecialist,” and other positions that do not typically require case-carrying duties. \n14 See discussion in footnote 11. \n5 \n \n\nFebruary 23, 2024      \nCo-Neutrals’ CAP \nImplementation Memorandum  \n \nThe State has reported making significant progress addressing issues with the quality of its \ncaseload data. The Co-Neutrals confirmed this progress during interviews with CYFD staff during \nsite visits to eight county CYFD offices across New Mexico in January 2024, but some issues \nremain. For example, 84 cases had no primary worker assigned on January 5, 2024 in the data \nsubmitted, and 15 individuals assigned as primary workers did not appear to be current CYFD \nemployees (assigned as primary workers for a total of 141 cases).15 When the Co-Neutral team \nreviewed reported caseloads with some CYFD staff during interviews in January 2024, the results \nwere mixed. Some staff agreed on reported caseload assignments, and others reported meaningful \ndiscrepancies between their understanding of their caseloads and the counts reflected in FACTS. \nAdditionally, some supervisors and managers reported that they were assigned to work on cases \nas the primary worker but those assignments were not reflected in FACTS.  \n \n2.  Family-Based Placements (FSA BTO6) \n \nCAP Commitments: \na.  In  five  high-needs  counties  (Bernalillo,  Dona Ana,  Santa  Fe,  San  Juan,  and \nChavez/Eddy),  CYFD  will  immediately  assign  one  placement  staff  to  focus \nexclusively  on  recruitment  until  at  least  September  30,  2023. The  State  will \nmaintain its dedicated public staff in the 5 designated counties at least until the \nprivate contractor has fully ramped up its capacity in those 5 designated counties.  \nb.  CYFD will enter into contracts with at least one private provider for resource family \nrecruitment by September 30, 2023 to focus on foster home recruitment and \nretention with specific capacity focused on growing new foster homes in each \ncounty throughout the State. \nc.  CYFD will provide Co-Neutrals with quarterly statewide data on gain/loss of non-\nrelative licensed resource homes. Details of these data, including quarterly date \nranges and submission deadlines, will be agreed upon by the Co-Neutrals and the \nState. CYFD will collect and assess the data by county and will provide data by \ncounty to the Co-Neutrals. \n \n \n \n \n \n15 See discussion in footnote 9. \n6 \n \n\nFebruary 23, 2024      \nCo-Neutrals’ CAP \nImplementation Memorandum  \n \nData and Discussion: \nCYFD has provided the following data related to resource home gains and losses between June \n30, 2023 and November 30, 2023. These data have not been validated by the Co-Neutrals; \nvalidated data will be included in the Co-Neutrals' next Annual Report.16  \nDuring the five-month period of July 2023 to November 2023, CYFD reports that the agency \nlicensed 32 new non-relative resource homes and 161 relative homes, for a statewide total of 193 \nresource homes. During the same period, the State reports 228 resource homes (both relative and \nnon-relative) were discontinued, representing a net loss of 35 homes. The number of newly \nlicensed and discontinued relative resource homes is relatively flat – 161 new and 169 closed. The \nnumber of new non-relative resource homes (32) is nearly half the number of non-relative resource \nhomes that discontinued their license (59). See Table 2 for county-by-county detail on discontinued \nand new resource homes. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n16 CYFD reports that valid data related to the exact dates providers discontinue providing placement services is \ninconsistently documented. For example, workers may take steps to inactivate a license when a provider discontinues \nplacement services or the license may lapse without a renewal.  \n7 \n \n\nFebruary 23, 2024      \nCo-Neutrals’ CAP \nImplementation Memorandum  \n \nTable 2: Number of Discontinued and New Non-Relative and Relative Resource Homes \nJune 30, 2023 – November 30, 2023  \nDiscontinued  Newly Licensed \nCounty  Relative    Relative \nFoster Care  Total  Foster Care  Total \nHome  Home \nBernalillo            14  31  45  9  56  65 \nChaves                0  5  5  1  7  8 \nCibola                0  4  4  0  4  4 \nColfax                3  2  5  0  2  2 \nCurry                 2  3  5  2  7  9 \nDe Baca               0  1  1  0  0  0 \nDona Ana              8  16  24  4  13  17 \nEddy                  1  11  12  1  10  11 \nGrant                 0  2  2  0  1  1 \nLea                   6  17  23  3  4  7 \nLincoln               3  0  3  0  0  0 \nLos Alamos  0  0  0  0  1  1 \nLuna                  0  4  4  1  0  1 \nMcKinley              2  3  5  2  9  11 \nMora                  0  2  2  0  0  0 \nOtero                 4  3  7  1  4  5 \nQuay  0  0  0  0  2  2 \nRio Arriba            0  5  5  0  1  1 \nRoosevelt             1  4  5  0  2  2 \nSan Juan              1  12  13  1  6  7 \nSan Miguel            0  6  6  2  3  5 \nSandoval              6  7  13  1  3  4 \nSanta Fe              1  9  10  1  6  7 \nSierra                1  0  1  0  2  2 \nSocorro               1  0  1  0  4  4 \nTaos                  1  2  3  0  2  2 \nTorrance              1  3  4  0  1  1 \nValencia              3  17  20  3  11  14 \nStatewide  59  169  228  32  161  193 \nSource: Data provided by CYFD; data have not been validated by the Co-Neutrals  \nTo increase capacity and focus on resource home recruitment and retention, the State committed \nin the CAP to assign one placement staff in Bernalillo, Dona Ana, Santa Fe, San Juan, and \nChavez/Eddy to focus exclusively on recruitment from July 2023 until at least September 30, 2023. \nIn September 2023, the Co-Neutrals met with Placement workers in two of these county offices \nand no one interviewed in either office was able to identify a Placement worker whose sole, or \neven primary, responsibility was resource home recruitment. Staff reported that due to vacancies \n8 \n \n\nFebruary 23, 2024      \nCo-Neutrals’ CAP \nImplementation Memorandum  \n \nand the workload of other staff in their units, that in addition to recruitment, they had other \nsubstantial assignments such as completing adoption disclosures, providing training for resource \nparents, and supervising children who were placed in the CYFD office.  \nPer the CAP agreement, in July 2023, CYFD reported that they executed a contract with a private \ncontractor to develop recruitment and retention strategies to increase the number of family-based \nplacements throughout the state. The contractor has proposed a plan for a “spider-web networking” \nmodel  that  includes  holding  house  meetings  to  use  word-of-mouth  advertising  to  generate \napplicants, and is developing a mobile app to assist with placement matching and resource parent \nsupport. The State reported that it expects to launch this model in one county in February 2024.  \nThe contractor also reported meeting with County Based Recruitment Teams and other CYFD \nstatewide  and  regional  Placement  staff  to  discuss  general  recruitment,  targeted  recruitment, \nsupport, and retention of resource parents.  \nDespite the still-urgent need to recruit additional resource parents, the Co-Neutrals are unable to \nconfirm that specific capacity focused on growing new resource homes in each county \nthroughout the State has been added pursuant to the CAP commitments. In fact, in the eight \ncounties visited by the Co-Neutrals in January 2024, CYFD appears to have lost ground and staff \nreported that they do not have dedicated time and resources for this work. Implementation of \ncounty-based recruitment plans was not well organized or proactive. CYFD staff repeatedly and \nconsistently reported that when resource family recruitment is discussed, it is during ad-hoc \nmeetings among existing investigative, PPW, and Placement staff at the county offices as an \nadditional piece of their work. Staff pervasively reported that there is no funding available for \nresource family recruitment activities. The acute shortage of resource families has led the State to \nplace babies and infants at the Bernalillo County Receiving Center – some for weeks – reflecting \na significant and unacceptable deficiency in the pool of available resource homes.  \n \n3.  Treatment Foster Care (FSA BTO6) \nCAP Commitments: \na.  When  a  child  is  recommended  for  TFC,  including  but  not  limited  to  a \nrecommendation from a mental health provider or a request from IPP team, CYFD \nwill submit the information to the MCO to confirm medical necessity by a prior \nauthorization. The MCO care coordinator will document such activity appropriately \nin the child’s file kept by the MCO pursuant to the obligations as outlined in Section \n4.4 of the Medicaid Managed Care Organization Service Agreement. See also LOD \n69-1, describing new obligations under section 4.12.15. The Parties agree that the \ndetermination (approval/denial/modification/reduction/delay) will be tracked by \n9 \n \n\nFebruary 23, 2024      \nCo-Neutrals’ CAP \nImplementation Memorandum  \n \nCYFD and HSD and that the time (number of days) between approval and treatment \nfoster care services beginning will be tracked. \nb.  Aggregate and child-specific level data for the following on a quarterly basis (data \nwill include the case and person ID, date of birth, date of request/activity or \ndisposition decision and notice provided) will be provided to the Co-Neutrals. \nData and Discussion:  \nPursuant  to  the  CAP,  the  State  instituted  new  processes  and  procedures  for  managed  care \norganization (MCO) care coordinators to seek and secure Treatment Foster Care (TFC) placements \nfor children. These procedures are outlined in LOD #10017 (effective August 14, 2023) which \nincludes the following:  \n•  When a child is recommended for TFC, CYFD will submit the referral packet and current \nassessment to the MCO for medical necessity review and pre-approval.  \n•  In response, the MCO sends the pre-approval notification with the medical necessity \ndetermination back to CYFD.   \n•  The MCO care coordinator assigned to the child has the responsibility for coordinating and \nobtaining TFC services for the child, and will document all activities in the child’s file.  \n•  Any denials, reductions, or modifications for TFC service requests will be reviewed by the \nMedical Director at the MCO, and the Medical Director’s decision will be sent to the CYFD \nand HSD Cabinet Secretaries.  \n•  If TFC services are not authorized by the MCO, HSD, and/or CYFD, the State will identify \nalternative services for the child within five days.  \nThe MCOs are required to collect data related to this process and the results. \nData submitted by HSD18 indicate that between August 15, 2023 and December 31, 2023, CYFD \nsent referrals to MCOs for TFC services for 23 children, and five (22%) of these children \nwere ultimately placed in TFC. There were an additional 10 requests for reauthorizations of TFC \nservices for children who were already in a TFC placement to authorize them to remain in their \nplacement as the initial authorizations were time limited; two of these were for two of the five \nchildren who received referrals for new TFC services and were ultimately placed in TFC in the \nperiod. All 10 of these reauthorization requests were approved.19 See Table 3 for a summary. \n \n17 LOD #100 can be found here.  \n18 The summary presented here is based on the unvalidated data the Co-Neutrals received from HSD and thus may not \nbe a comprehensive view of TFC services in the third and fourth quarters of 2023. It is possible that referrals and \nplacements took place that are not reflected in the submitted data. \n19 The data submitted by the State do not describe why reauthorizations were necessary for these placements. Two of \nthe  reauthorizations  were  requested  by  CYFD  within  a  month  of  the  initial  placement.  For  the  other  eight \nreauthorizations, the data did not include the date of the initial referral for TFC services or the initial placement. \n10 \n \n\nFebruary 23, 2024      \nCo-Neutrals’ CAP \nImplementation Memorandum  \n \nAmong the 18 children who were referred and not placed in TFC, MCOs sent referrals to an \naverage of seven TFC agencies per child. HSD reports that the TFC agencies took an average of \nsix days to respond to referrals. Agencies denied 84 percent of these referrals, and no response was \nrecorded by the MCO to the remaining 16 percent. The most common reason for the TFC agencies \nto deny placement as documented by the MCOs was the lack of an appropriate treatment match \n(74% of denied referrals). There were no substantial differences in the response trends between \nthe three MCOs. \nTable 3: Summary of Children Referred for New or Reauthorized TFC from \nAugust 15, 2023 to December 31, 2023 \nTotal number of children referred for new or reauthorized TFC services  31 \nChildren for whom CYFD submitted new requests for TFC services  23 \nChildren placed in TFC services  5 (22%) \nAvg. number. of days between the MCO’s referral to TFC agency and start       \n16 \nof TFC services \nChildren not placed in TFC services  18 (78%) \nAvg. number of TFC agencies to which MCO sent referrals for a child  7 \nAvg. number. of days from MCO referral to TFC agency response  6 \nReferrals with no recorded response from agency  20 (16%) \nReferrals denied (denied reason below)  104 (84%) \nNo appropriate treatment match  77 (74%) \nNo available space  15 (14%) \nOther20  7 (7%) \nNo reason given  5 (5%) \nChildren in TFC placements who received a reauthorization of TFC services  10* \nSource: Analysis of data submitted by HSD on December 12, 2023 and January 31, 2024. \n* Includes two of the 23 children for whom CYFD submitted new requests for TFC services (their new services \nbegan and were reauthorized within the period in question) and eight additional children who received reau-\nthorizations for existing services. \nAlthough required by the CAP, the State did not provide the Co-Neutrals with quarterly data on \nthe total number of TFC homes. In information provided by CYFD to San Juan community pilot \nmembers in February 2024, CYFD reports that as of mid-January 2024, there were nine active \nTFC providers with a total of 189 TFC homes statewide. This data has not been validated by the \nCo-Neutrals.  \nThe Co-Neutrals spoke with four TFC providers in late 2023 to discuss current strengths and \nchallenges in providing TFC services. They all expressed concerns with the shrinking capacity of \n \n20 Such as “Age criteria not met” or “Clinical criteria not met.” \n11 \n \n\nFebruary 23, 2024      \nCo-Neutrals’ CAP \nImplementation Memorandum  \n \nthis service across the state and were unable to identify specific strategies that the State was \nimplementing to prevent further loss. Themes from these conversations are bulleted below:  \n•  Similar to CYFD, TFC providers are also experiencing challenges in recruiting new \nresource home providers, and they have lost previously licensed TFC providers due to \nreported challenges in working with CYFD.   \n•  In order to support more TFC homes, private agencies report needing additional capacity \nand staffing within their agencies, specifically treatment coordinators and therapists. \n•  Placements in TFC are based on whether the service is clinically appropriate for the child \nand if there is a therapeutic match with an available home. Providers report that they decline \nplacement if they do not have a home that is a therapeutic match with the child. However, \nproviders express that if there were more TFC homes, there would be a larger pool from \nwhich to match children with an appropriate and available home. \n•  Lack  of  available  and  supportive  community-based  services  in  rural  communities \nthroughout the state was cited as a challenge to TFC placements. Agencies indicated TFC \nfamilies are hesitant to accept children with challenging needs and behaviors if they do not \nhave the supports necessary to successfully care for the child.  \n•  Agencies cited interpretation and application of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)21 \nas a significant roadblock to finding TFC placements for children. Providers and other \nstakeholders report that when a therapeutic match is identified, it could be outside of the \ntransportation zone of the child’s school of origin and require significant transportation \nsupport, resulting in the home not being selected as appropriate. Despite many reported \nmeetings among CYFD and providers to address and resolve this issue, there has not been \nany reported progress.  \n \n4.  Behavioral Health Services (FSA DTO3)  \nCAP Commitments: \na.  HSD and CYFD will double the number of High-Fidelity Wraparound (HFW) sites \nfrom 10 to 20. \nb.  HSD and CYFD will double the number of HFW facilitators from 26 to 52. \na.  It takes six months to train HFW facilitators. HSD and CYFD will have 26 \nadditional  facilitators  in  the  training  pipeline  by  January  1,  with \ncredentialing expected in the first quarter of 2024. \nc.  On  October  1,  2023,  HSD  and  CYFD  will  provide  the  Co-Neutrals  and  the \nPlaintiffs with: 1) facilitator training tracking logs to reflect HFW facilitators in \n \n21 NM’s State Plan for the Every Student Succeeds Act can be found here. \n12 \n \n\nFebruary 23, 2024      \nCo-Neutrals’ CAP \nImplementation Memorandum  \n \ntraining, and 2) a Medicaid provider enrollment report to reflect the number of \nenrolled HFW providers. \nd.  [HSD and CYFD will provide the Co-Neutrals and the Plaintiffs with] a final report \n[on HFW] to be provided on January 15, 2024 reflecting the status as of January 1, \n2024. \nData and Discussion:  \nThe State provided the following data and materials regarding the expansion of High-Fidelity \nWraparound (HFW) services between July 1, 2023 and December 31, 2023: facilitator training \nlogs as of October 1, 2023 and January 1, 2024; lists of HFW providers enrolled and active with \nMedicaid as of October 1, 2023 and January 1, 2024; and information on facilitator training and \ncertification requirements.  \nAccording to data provided by the State, there are 11 active HFW sites in New Mexico as of \nJanuary 1, 2024, operated by nine total HFW providers. In terms of trained facilitators, there are \n35 certified HFW facilitators as of January 1, 2024, with three additional Facilitators-in-Training \nexpected to be certified by the end of the first quarter of 2024. Seventeen additional HFW \nFacilitators-in-Training are still completing their certification training, which generally takes \nbetween six months to one year to complete. Facilitators-in-Training are able to provide HFW \nservices to families under the supervision of a HFW coach prior to being certified after completing \nsome of the required foundational training.  \nTo collect additional information regarding the State’s expansion of HFW, the Co-Neutrals spoke \nwith various stakeholders who have experience with the service, including multiple HFW agencies, \nCYFD staff, staff from the NMSU Center of Innovation (COI), and resource parents. Many \nproviders and staff spoke about the challenges faced due to a lack of available and appropriate staff \nto hire and train to provide HFW. HFW requires a lengthy training and certification process, and \nwith the current turnover rates behavioral health providers are experiencing, there are concerns \nabout the sustainability of training staff who in turn leave the agency within a short period of time. \nIt was also shared that some providers have difficulty accessing training when they hire new staff, \nas new staff may wait weeks or longer before being able to begin the training process. The delays \nin access to training and staff costs that cannot be billed for hired staff who are waiting for training \nor are in the training/certification process are an additional financial burden for HFW provider \nagencies.  \nProviders also expressed frustration with the roll-out process once HFW became a Medicaid-\nbillable service, and many had concerns regarding the change in requirements to be a HFW coach. \nSpecifically, the change requiring a Bachelor’s degree for HFW coaches was identified as a barrier \nto expanding HFW services. Providers in different areas of the state expressed disappointment \nover the lack of referrals from CYFD, and noted that there appears to be staff confusion regarding \n13 \n \n\nFebruary 23, 2024      \nCo-Neutrals’ CAP \nImplementation Memorandum  \n \nthe differences between HFW and the newly implemented Individualized Planning Process (IPP) \nMeetings conducted by CYFD. \n \n5.  Critical Incident Review (FSA BTO2, 3, 4) \nCAP Commitments: \na.  CYFD will provide the Co-Neutrals with written notice via email within one (1) \nbusiness day of notification to the department of any critical incident regarding a \nchild placed in hotels, motels, offices, out-of-state, in shelters, or in congregate care \nin New Mexico…...The Co-Neutrals will provide information quarterly to Plaintiffs \nwhich will at minimum detail numbers of CIR by type. \nData and Discussion: \nThe CAP defines critical incidents as any situation that occurred for a child placed in a hotel/motel, \nCYFD office, out-of-state facility, shelter, or congregate care facility in New Mexico that results \nin either a 911 call, an allegation of harm, an allegation of abuse and/or neglect, an allegation of \nrestraint/seclusion, or a change in licensure of a facility. The State is required to notify the Co-\nNeutrals in writing that a critical incident occurred within one business day of the incident.  \nThe State provided the Co-Neutrals with documentation of 58 Critical Incident Reports (CIRs) for \ncritical incidents that occurred between July 1, 2023 and January 5, 2024.22 The Co-Neutrals \npreviously provided two quarterly detailed summaries of the CIRs received to the Parties; the \nsummaries are attached to this memo with redactions to protect child confidentiality. \nThe 58 CIRs reviewed by the Co-Neutrals involved 29 unique children, with many children \ninvolved in multiple incidents. The majority of CIRs (49 out of 58, or 84%) document incidents \nthat occurred at a CYFD office (including the Receiving Center), with the remaining incidents \noccurring in a kinship home, out-of-state residential treatment center (RTC), and in-state RTC. \nMost critical incidents were 911 calls (45 out of 58 CIRs, or 76%) made regarding an incident at \na CYFD office.23 \n \n22 Most of these critical incident notifications were provided by CYFD to the Co-Neutrals within a short time following \nthe incident. During the Co-Neutrals’ case record reviews of children’s placements in offices and shelters in CY2023, \nthe Co-Neutral team identified seven possible critical incidents documented within children’s case records for which \na CIR report was not initially submitted by CYFD to the Co-Neutrals. The Co-Neutrals requested information from \nthe State regarding these incidents on February 8, 2024, and as of February 22, 2024, CYFD has submitted two \nadditional CIRs based on their review of children’s records; these critical incidents are included in the data analysis in \nthis section. The Co-Neutrals continue to await a response on the other five potential critical incidents.  \n23 Two CIRs categorized as 911 calls were for children staying in either a kinship home or an in-state RTC. All other \nCIRs marked as 911 calls occurred for children housed in a CYFD office. One CIR was categorized as both a 911 call \nand an allegation of harm (toward staff). \n14 \n \n\nFebruary 23, 2024      \nCo-Neutrals’ CAP \nImplementation Memorandum  \n \nTable 4 outlines the CIRs reviewed by the Co-Neutrals. \nTable 4: Summary of Critical Incidents Reviewed by the Co-Neutrals \nType of Critical Incident Reviewed \nMonth Critical \nNumber of  Number of \nIncident  Number  Number of  Number of \nAllegations of  Changes in \nOccurred  of 911  Allegations  Allegations of  Total \nAbuse and/or  Licensure of a \ncalls  of Harm24  Restraint/Seclusion \nNeglect  Facility \nJuly 2023  5  0  0  0  0  5 \nAugust 2023  7  1  1  1  0  10 \nSeptember 2023  12  2  0  2  0  16 \nOctober 2023  625  0  0  1  0  7 \nNovember 2023  5  2  0  1  0  8 \nDecember 2023  9  0  0  0  0  9 \nJanuary 2024  1  1  0  1  0  3 \nTotal  45  6  1  6  0  58 \nSource: CIRs provided by CYFD and case records reviewed by the Co-Neutrals \n \n6.  Joint Powers Agreement and Tribal Resources (FSA Appendix C) \nCAP Commitments: \na.  By September 1, 2023, CYFD will make good faith efforts to engage and \nnegotiate with five N/P/Ts who are interested in a new or revised JPA, with \ninitial outreach being made to the 5 N/P/T with the most children in state \ncustody. \nb.  By  December  31,  2023,  CYFD  will  make  good  faith  efforts  to  initiate \nengagement and negotiate with any remaining N/P/Ts who wish to engage in \ndiscussions on JPAs. Any current efforts CYFD has taken to  collaborate, \ncommunicate, and negotiate with N/P/Ts on various matters, including but not \nlimited to JPAs, will continue. \nc.  With the input from representatives from each N/P/T who are interested, CYFD \nwill engage, negotiate, and develop a written agreement template, regarding \nN/P/Ts access to financial resources, including Title IV-E funds by November \n30, 2023. \n \n \n24 Five out of six allegations of harm appear to be alleged harm against staff, not against the identified child in each \nCIR reviewed. \n25 One CIR was categorized as both a 911 call and as an allegation of harm (toward staff). For the purposes of this \nreview, it is counted here only in the 911 category. \n15 \n \n\nFebruary 23, 2024      \nCo-Neutrals’ CAP \nImplementation Memorandum  \n \nDiscussion:  \nThe CAP states that CYFD will inform the Co-Neutrals of the status of Joint Power Agreements \n(JPAs) with the explicit knowledge and permission of those Nations, Pueblos, and Tribes. CYFD \nhas informed the Co-Neutrals that they have received permission from three Pueblos to share this \ninformation. As of this writing, no new JPAs have been executed.  \nBetween July and December 2023, CYFD reports that the Office of Tribal Affairs (OTA) met at \nleast once with 10 separate Nations, Pueblos, and Tribes to discuss JPAs. \n \n7.  Well-Child Visits (FSA DTO4)  \nCAP Commitments: \na.  The State will come into full compliance with Target Outcome 4 (100% of \nchildren in state custody receiving a Well-Child visit within 30 days) by January \n1, 2024; this target is for remedial purposes and does not change the FSA \ndeliverable date. \nb.  The State will ensure that all children who entered care before July 1, 2023 and \nare still in custody on September 15, 2023 have a completed well-child visit by \nSeptember 15, 2023. \nData and Discussion:  \nPursuant to the CAP, HSD issued LOD #96 titled “Comprehensive Well Child Checkups for \nChildren in State Custody (CISC) Within 30 Days” on June 30, 2023.26 LOD #96 outlines the \nresponsibilities and reporting requirements of MCOs to ensure all children in state custody have a \nwell-child checkup within 30 days of entering care.  \nCYFD reported the agency hired a full-time EPSDT coordinator in June 2023 to assist in \nfacilitating  the  completion  of  well-child  visits.    CYFD  also  reported  it  is  working  on  a \nMemorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Department of Health to assist in getting well-\nchild visits completed.  \nThe State provided the Co-Neutrals with a preliminary list of children who entered care each month \nfrom January through November 2023, as well as a list of children in care on September 15, 2023 \nwho had entered care prior to 2023.27 From these lists, the Co-Neutrals selected a random sample \n \n26 LOD #96 can be found here. \n27 As required by the CAP, beginning in September 2023, the State provided preliminary monthly well-child \nperformance data on the 5th day of the following month of when the visits were due (for example, the July 2023 \nperformance data was provided to the Co-Neutrals on September 5, 2023.)  \n16 \n \n\nFebruary 23, 2024      \nCo-Neutrals’ CAP \nImplementation Memorandum  \n \nof children to review,28 and requested documentation to verify completion of a well-child visit \nfrom the State for each child in the sample. In response to the Co-Neutrals’ sample requests, the \nState provided appointment documentation, and preliminary billing data provided by HSD.  \nTo assess timeliness, the Co-Neutrals removed from analysis children in the pre-July 2023 sample \nwho entered care before January 1, 2023, as the State provided records for these children’s most \nrecent well-child visit prior to September 15, 2023, and not for the first well-child visit the child \nreceived after they entered care which may have been 12 or more months prior. The Co-Neutrals \nreviewed the number of days between a child’s date of entry and the date of well-child checkup \non records provided by the State. Due to the preliminary nature of the billing data, the Co-Neutrals \ndid not consider the submission of HSD billing dates without corroboration from additional \nmedical record documentation for the purpose of CAP data validation.29 \nTo assess completeness, the Co-Neutrals reviewed children’s medical records provided by the \nState  to  determine  whether  required  and  applicable30  elements  of  a  well-child  visit  were \ndocumented. Required elements were derived using the criteria from HSD’s Keeping Kids Healthy \nwebsite,31 which lists the required elements as: medical history; measurements of height, weight, \nand BMI; unclothed physical examination; nutrition screening; vision and hearing screenings; \ndevelopmental/behavioral assessment; hematocrit/hemoglobin at nine months and 13 years; lead \nscreening at 12 months and 24 months; immunizations; selective screenings necessary according \nto risk factors;32 and anticipatory guidance.33  \n \n28 The Co-Neutrals selected random samples of 50 percent of the children in each of the monthly cohorts (not to exceed \n25 children) to verify completion of well-child visits consistent with the CAP. For the pre-July cohort, the Co-Neutrals \nselected a 10 percent stratified sample, with half of the sample from children who entered care between January 1 and \nJune 30, 2023, and half of the sample from children who entered care before January 1, 2023. \n29 The Kevin S. DVP metric for this FSA commitment specifies applicable billing codes providers may use to identify \nwhether a medical appointment should be considered as a well-child visit, however, this level of detail is not yet \navailable due to the preliminary nature of the data. HSD confirmed to the Co-Neutrals that HSD provided only those \nbilling dates consistent with the applicable billing codes as agreed upon in the DVP. \n30 All elements listed within HSD’s Keeping Kids Health guidance for well-child visits are not required for every child \nat every well-child visit, depending on the child’s chronological age. To assess applicability of required elements, \nreviewers referred to the NM Periodicity Schedule, which can be found here, and NM’s Medical Assistance Division’s \nRecommended Behavioral/Developmental Assessment poster, which can be found here. \n31 HSD’s Keeping Kids Healthy website can be found here. \n32 During the course of their evaluation, providers may identify risk factors for children for which they are then \nexpected to complete additional screenings. This may include a Tobacco, Alcohol, or Drug Use Assessment if the child \ndemonstrates behavior that may put them at risk for drug use, or STI testing due to sexual behavior. Additional \ninformation on screening for risk factors can be found here and here. \n33 Anticipatory guidance is given by the health care provider to assist parents, guardians, or caretakers in the \nunderstanding of the expected growth and development of children. Anticipatory guidance, specific to the age of the \npatient, includes information about the benefits of healthy lifestyles and practices that promote injury and disease \nprevention. This guidance may be given in the form of a handout or verbally. Additional information on anticipatory \nguidance can be found here. \n17 \n \n\nFebruary 23, 2024      \nCo-Neutrals’ CAP \nImplementation Memorandum  \n \nAt this time and with the information available, the Co-Neutrals are unable to validate whether \nrequirements outlined in the LOD have occurred. The data provided by the State do not indicate \nthat all children in state custody received a completed well-child visit within 30 days of \nentering care. Specifically, the Co-Neutrals found that: \n•  The State was able to produce records to verify completion of a well-child visit for 36 \npercent (108 out of 303) of the records requested by the Co-Neutrals.34 \n•  Of the 86 records reviewed for a sample of children who entered care in 2023, a well-\nchild visit occurred within 30 days of entry for 74 percent of those children (64 out of \n86 records reviewed).35 \n•  All required and applicable elements of a well-child checkup were documented for 51 \npercent of children in the reviewed sample (55 out of 108 records reviewed).36 Of the \nremaining 53 records reviewed, 52 showed documentation of at least two or more of \nthe required well-child checkup elements, while one record showed documentation of \nonly one required element.37 \nDuring the Co-Neutrals’ site visits to CYFD county offices in September 2023 and January 2024, \nCYFD staff identified barriers they have experienced in scheduling and completing well-child \nappointments for children on their caseloads. Staff expressed there is often role confusion over \nwho is responsible to schedule and facilitate well-child visits, particularly for children whose \nappointments might be made by the investigation worker prior to the child being assigned to a \nPPW. While some workers reported receiving reminders to schedule well-child appointments from \nthe EPSDT coordinator, the lack of available  providers in certain parts of the state makes \nscheduling an appointment in a timely manner challenging.  \n \n34 The total number of records requested (303) includes records requested for children who entered care prior to \nJanuary 1, 2023 who remained in care as of September 15, 2023. The State advised that some records were not \nproduced in time to provide the documentation to the Co-Neutrals within the five-day turnaround period, and some \nrecords were not produced at all. The State also stated that some caregivers and youth over the age of 14 had not \nconsented by signed release for providers to send the records to CYFD, which the State described as a cause of some \nrecords not being produced. \n35 The Co-Neutrals reviewed timeliness only for children in the sample who entered care after January 1, 2023 (215 \nof 303 entries in the full sample) for whom the State was able to produce records to verify completion of a well-child \nvisit (86 of the 215 children in the sample who entered care after January 1, 2023). The Co-Neutrals did not examine \ntimeliness for the 88 children in the full sample who entered care before 2023 as the records provided by the State \nmay not have reflected the first well-child visit the child received after entering care.  \n36 The Co-Neutrals reviewed the completeness of well-child visits for all children in the sample for whom the State \nwas able to produce records to verify completion of a well-child visit – including records provided for children who \nentered care prior to 2023, for a total of 108 records reviewed.  \n37 The Co-Neutrals identified quality issues with some of the records provided which impacted validation efforts. For \nthe July and October 2023 medical record submission, in some instances, the State produced documentation for dental, \nvision, or sick appointments rather than well-child appointments. In other instances, the documentation provided \nincluded records on a CYFD form presumably completed by the provider detailing what was discussed and assessed \nduring the visit. There were also multiple instances where the records submitted appeared to be missing pages which \nmay have provided additional information on what well-child elements occurred during the visit. \n18 \n \n\nFebruary 23, 2024      \nCo-Neutrals’ CAP \nImplementation Memorandum  \n \nFurther detail on the Co-Neutral’s verification process is provided in the initial update shared with \nthe Parties on December 6, 2023.  \n \n8.  Data Submissions  \nCAP Commitment: \na.  The Parties agree that it is imperative for the State and the Co-Neutrals to have access to \nreal time data to assist the State in meeting the obligations in the Agreement and that the \nfailure to have access to real time data has already delayed needed progress on many \ndeliverables. In order to more effectively monitor the State’s progress, CYFD and HSD \nagree to provide real time data as outlined in CAP.  \nDiscussion:  \nThe Co-Neutrals have received most data identified in the CAP from the State. Some of the \nprovided data required additional clarification or structuring, and the data were not consistently \nprovided within the timelines outlined in the CAP. As of this writing, the Co-Neutrals have not \nreceived all medical necessity determination information for new in-state and out-of-state clinical \ncongregate care placements nor quarterly data on the total number of TFC homes despite repeated \nrequests from the Co-Neutrals.  \n*** \nThe CAP was intended to address previously noted deficiencies and areas where progress has \nlagged. Overall, this has not occurred in a meaningful way. Further, as identified in the Co-\nNeutrals’ January 26, 2024 letter to the Parties, there are urgent, critical issues threatening child \nand worker safety which undermine the ability of the State to implement its Kevin S. commitments \nin good faith. We urge the State to address those issues immediately. \n \nSincerely, \n \n                                        \nJudith Meltzer      Kevin Ryan       \nCenter for the Study     Public Catalyst     \nof Social Policy            \n                 \n \ncc:   Julie Sakura, General Counsel, CYFD \nMark Reynolds, Chief General Counsel, HSD  \nAlex Castillo Smith, Deputy Cabinet Secretary, HSD \n19 \n \n\nFebruary 23, 2024      \nCo-Neutrals’ CAP \nImplementation Memorandum  \n \nMark Velarde, PS Director, CYFD \nFarra Fong, Deputy Director, CYFD \nJennifer Archuleta-Earp, Program Deputy Director, CYFD \n  Sarah Meadows, Performance and Accountability, CYFD \n  Kathy Kunkel, Consultant, CYFD and HSD \nBianca Foppert, Change Implementation Coordinator, CYFD \nSally Jameson, Project Manager, Office of the Secretary, HSD \n \nAttachments: \n2 2024 Attachment 1.pdf \n2 2024 Attachment 2.pdf \n20 \n \n\nEXHIBIT F \n   \n\n \n \nTHE PUBLIC INTEREST LAW OFFICE OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND BEVERLY HILLS BAR ASSOCIATIONS \nThe Southern California Affiliate of The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law \n \n \nMarch 5, 2024 \n \nVia Email and U.S. Mail \n \nTeresa Casados, Cabinet Secretary   Kari Armijo, Cabinet Secretary \nChildren, Youth and Families Department  Health and Human Services Department \nState of New Mexico  Office of the Governor \nP.O.

Most recently, on February 23, 2024, the Co-Neutrals \nwrote to provide the parties with information regarding the State’s purported implementation of \nselected commitments contained in the June 23, 2023 Corrective Action Plan (“CAP”).  The \ninformation provided by the Co-Neutrals confirms that CYFD and HSD have failed to comply \nwith significant CAP commitments.  \nPlaintiffs are committed to holding CYFD and HSD responsible for their promises to \nimplement the Settlement and CAP and to building a child welfare system that incorporates the \nchanges promised in those covenants.  In order to ensure that we have the necessary information \nto inform our decisions regarding how to best enforce the Settlement and CAP, we request that \nCYFD and HSD provide the Plaintiffs with the State’s position regarding the Co-Neutrals’ \nfindings.  For any finding that CYFD or HSD believes is inaccurate, please provide us with the \nbasis and the information supporting the State’s position.   \nIn addition, if there is information that was not provided to the Co-Neutrals, either \ninformation due to the Co-Neutrals under the CAP or new information regarding CAP \nimplementation, we request that the information be provided to Plaintiffs and the Co-Neutrals.   \nCYFD and HSD have asserted that they are dedicated to implementing Kevin S.  The \nSettlement and CAP underscore the importance of accurate and transparent data to inform \ndeterminations regarding the State’s performance.  In this spirit, and to avoid unnecessary further \ndisputes, we request that you provide us with the requested information no later than March 11, \n2024.  \n \n610 SOUTH ARDMORE AVENUE · LOS ANGELES, CA 90005 · TEL: 213.385.2977 FAX: 213.385.9089 · WWW.PUBLICCOUNSEL.ORG  \n“There is no greater justice than equal justice” \n\nNon-Compliance with June 30, 2023 CAP \nMarch 5, 2024 \nPage 2 of 2 \n \nThank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.

Blalock, et al., No. 1:18-CV-00896 \n  Non-Compliance with the June 30, 2023 CAP \n \nDear Counsel, \n \nThis letter is in response to your letter dated March 5, 2024 concerning the Co-Neutrals’ letter of \nFebruary 23, 2024.  Our response follows the format of the March 5th letter and is as follows: \n \n1.  CYFD Workforce Caseloads (FSA BTO10)  \n \nThe State is committed to steady progress in addressing issues with the quality of caseload \ndata. These efforts include:  \n \n•  Continue to improve data quality through regular calculation of caseloads \nacross case types and updating personnel data.  \n•  Accessing a more reliable list of temporary/contractor staff who are helping \ncounties with especially high caseloads and staff shortages (many of whom \nare  former  employees).  If  unable  to  identify  staff,  it  causes  more \nunaccounted cases in the analysis.  \n•  Proper documentation of secondary assignment of cases so data does not \nreflect  new  workers  carrying  cases.  This  assignment  will  allow  these \nworkers as secondary assignees to access the case as part of their training \nprocess.   \n•  As the state continues to hire and onboard new staff, we should see better \ncompliance  with  graduated  caseload  standards,  and  with  caseload \ncompliance more generally.   \n•  Supervisors and managers will be directed to ensure all case assignments \nare properly reflected in FACTS.  \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: 0257C5DA-5485-40C4-A5CA-CF9112B40DF7\nMarch 12, 2024 \nPage 2 of 8 \n \n•  The  Co-Neutrals’  wrote  “Some  staff  agreed  on  reported  caseload \nassignments, and others reported meaningful discrepancies between their \nunderstanding of their caseloads and the counts reflected in FACTS”  the \nState is requesting information to determine how to address the caseload \ndiscrepancies.   \n \n2.  Family Based Placements (FSA BTO6)  \n \nThe state agrees with the Co-Neutrals' statements regarding family-based placements. The \nfollowing actions are underway to improve compliance with BTO6 :   \n \n•  There are many reasons for the discontinuation of a relative license. In \ngeneral, a relative license is obtained for a specific child(ren) and is often \nshort-term.  \n•  The net loss of 27 non-relative foster homes is concerning to CYFD. CYFD \nis utilizing the same strategy with foster families as with its employees, \nincluding stay interviews, exit interviews, continual training, peer support \nand reestablishing respite foster care.  \n•  The state will continue to track licensing and retention of non-relative foster \nhomes, including those which are successful conversions of relative homes. \nThese homes are of particular interest, as they require less onboarding and \ntraining efforts, although they will still require significant support. In order \nto better understand the impact these families have on foster home needs \nwithin each community, CYFD will track placement patterns among these \n“dually licensed” providers to see if, generally speaking, the conversion \nstrategy is effective in meeting the needs of children in the community. \n•  The state will continue to work with a contractor implementing a spider-\nweb  referral  model.  After  working  with  the  contractor  to  assess  the \ncertification process, procedures, and data, the state now has the foundation \nneeded to continue  with this strategic  referral model. This strategy is \nunderway as several resource parents have volunteered to host these referral \nmeetings. \nThe state will also continue to implement internal recruitment and retention \nstrategies. These recruitment events are ongoing and have resulted in 94 \ninquiries in January and 102 inquiries in February.    \n•  Because of staffing vacancies, the assigned placement worker for the five \ncounties did not take place during the designated time. However, the State \nhas since made these appointments. They include:  \n \nBernalillo – Stephanie Gallegos  \nDona Ana – Sabrina Gabaldon  \nSanta Fe – Arlene Riboni  \nSan Juan – Patricia Hale  \nChaves – Lori Hicks  \n     \n \n        \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: 0257C5DA-5485-40C4-A5CA-CF9112B40DF7\nMarch 12, 2024 \nPage 3 of 8 \n \n•  CYFD has established specific pillars, one concentrating on placement. \nThis team is focusing on strengthening the county-based recruitment plans \nand providing technical support for execution of these plans.  \n \n3.  Treatment Foster Care (FSA BTO6)  \n \nWhile the state does not dispute the findings from the tracking process described, the state’s \ndata system indicates that 82 children were placed in TFC between August 15th, 2023 and \nDecember 31, 2023. Some of these placements were quite short in duration (i.e., fewer than \n30 days, N=27) and many were likely not tracked through the new MCO approval process \nif authorization was sought before this process went into effect. Since CY 2020, around \n250 children are placed in TFC each year, which admittedly is a decline from prior years \n(an average of 380 per year from 2017-2019). Between the 10 TFC agencies in New \nMexico, there are a total of 189 TFC Homes (with various bed capacities).   \n \n4.  Behavioral Health Services  \n  \n•  As of January 2024.  There are eleven (11) sites operated by eight (8) \nproviders.    \n \nACTIVE PROVIDERS  COUNTY SITE \nAll Faiths   Bernalillo  \nAll Faiths   Valencia  \nMental Health Resources   Roosevelt  \nMental Health Resources   Curry  \nGuidance Center    Lea   \nNew Day   Bernalillo  \nDesert View   San Juan  \nDesert View   McKinley  \nLa Casa   Chaves  \nUNM-HSC   Sandoval  \nFYI+   Dona Ana  \nTOTAL   11  \n  \n   \n     \n \n        \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: 0257C5DA-5485-40C4-A5CA-CF9112B40DF7\nMarch 12, 2024 \nPage 4 of 8 \n \n•  Regarding the number of HFW facilitators, below are the numbers as of \nJanuary 2024:  \n \nCertified Wraparound Facilitator   35  \nCredentialing Anticipated in Q1   3  \nStill in Training/ Credentialing Past Q1   17  \nTOTAL   55  \n  \nThe HSD LOD states: “Wraparound Facilitators must be certified or be actively enrolled \nas a FIT to begin serving families. Wraparound facilitators must also be certified in \nWraparound by the NMCBBHP between 6 to 12 months from completing the “Foundations \nof Wraparound Practice” training;”  \n  \nOngoing Efforts to Improve the Program:  \n \nIn FY’24, CYFD executed a four (4)-year Intergovernmental Agreement \n(IGA)  with the NMSU COI to support HFW  provider and  workforce \ndevelopment.  This IGA supports the following:  \n \n  Along with the CYFD BHS HFW team, training has been \nprovided to Wrapround staff regarding all aspects of the \nHFW model.  NMCOI provides coordination and tracking of \nall HFW trainings.  \n  Endorsed  coaches  to  support  current  and  future  HFW \nproviders.  \n  Positions to help support the expansion of HFW.   \n  HFW  Facilitator  tracking  sheets  to  track  educational \nrequirements for HFW Facilitators.  \n  Contracting  with  and  coordination/tracking  of  HFW \nCertification through the New Mexico Credentialing Board \nfor Behavioral Health Professionals (NMCBBHP).   \n  Updates to the NMSU COI website to include HFW provider \ninquiries:   \n \nhttps://centerofinnovationnm.org/nm-wraparound/wrap-provider-application/wrp-provider-interest/  \n \n  CYFD  BHS  HFW  team  will  continue  to  hold  outreach \nevents to meet and train on HFW with providers who inquire \nabout HFW, and to help generate referrals in current HFW \nprovider  locations.  They  will  discuss  with  prospective \nproviders  the  structural  requirements  in  the  HFW \nimplementation plan and Medicaid rate. \n \n     \n \n        \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: 0257C5DA-5485-40C4-A5CA-CF9112B40DF7\nMarch 12, 2024 \nPage 5 of 8 \n \n  The CYFD BHS HFW team will meet with the providers \nwho submitted a letter of interest to become a Wraparound \nProvider.  \n \n  In SFY’24, CYFD BHS allocated State General Funds to \ncontract with the vendor It Takes a Village to support current \nand future HFW providers with a sustainability/business \nplan in sustaining and/or becoming a HFW provider.   \n \nRegarding the hiring of staff and training:  \n \n•  The challenges of hiring staff do not appear to be specifically related to the \nHFW program, but rather a statewide workforce situation.   The HFW \nprogram was intentionally selected as it does not require licensed clinicians \nto serve as Facilitators, allowing for a range of experience and education.    \n•  BHS  is  not  aware  of  Provider  concerns  related  to  “lengthy” \ntrainings.  Ongoing training is necessary to be considered a high-quality and \n“high-fidelity” model and is necessary to become a credentialed position \nwith  the  New  Mexico  Credentialing  Board  for  Behavioral  Health \nProfessionals.  All training is based upon national technical  assistance \nCYFD  received  while  developing  the  NM  HFW  model.   The  training \nrequirements were included in the rate development process with Mercer \nand HSD, so the current Medicaid rate includes the lost productivity that \noccurs when Facilitators attend these trainings.  \n•  BHS is not aware of provider difficulty accessing training, especially for \nnew hires.  Since FY’21, BHS has scheduled training in advance for the \nentire year on the NMSU COI’s website to allow providers to align hiring \nwith the scheduled training.  BHS offers “Contingency Trainings” for when \na  Facilitator  is  hired  in  between  Foundations  trainings  to  begin  the \nengagement process with youth and families, prior to completion of the \nFoundations  Training  and  formal  assignment.   BHS  also  schedules  or \nreschedules Foundations Training if the need is there.  \n•  From BHS’ experience, some HFW Providers require internal on-boarding \ntraining before sending them to Foundations that can be up to thirty (30) \ndays. Other Providers have hired a Facilitator on Friday and sent them to \nFoundations Training the following Monday. BHS works closely with HFW \nProviders to coordinate training that meets their staffing needs. \n \n•  Below are the dates of Foundations Trainings provided in FY’23 and \nFY’24:  \nJuly 11-15, 2022  \nOctober 24-28, 2022  \nDecember 21, 2022 (Contingency Training)  \nJanuary 23-27, 2023  \nMay 24, 2023 (Contingency Training)  \n     \n \n        \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: 0257C5DA-5485-40C4-A5CA-CF9112B40DF7\nMarch 12, 2024 \nPage 6 of 8 \n \nJuly 17-21, 2023  \nOctober 2-6, 2023  \nDecember 11-15, 2024 (Cancelled due to not enough registrations)  \nJanuary 22-26, 2024  \nMarch 19-22, 2024 (planned)  \nMay 21-24, 2024 (planned)  \n  \nProviders  are  concerned  about  changes  (requiring  a  bachelor's  degree)  in \nrequirements to be a HFW coach:  \n \n•  Provider questions/concerns regarding changes in requirements to the HFW \ncoach have been raised to both HSD and CYFD BHS.  HSD MAD has taken \nthose concerns to CMS; a response is pending.  \n•  In July 2023, BHS immediately began funding the two providers that did \nnot transition to Medicaid because of this reason.    \n•  There appears to be confusion between HFW and IPP process.  \n•  Regarding any confusion between HFW and IPP process, the expectations \nof the HFW Facilitator and team meetings are clearly delineated in the HFW \nProgram Manual and training.    \n  \nAdditional Program Improvement efforts:  \n \n•  CYFD-BHS has contracted with the New Mexico State University Center \nof Innovation (NMSU-COI) to hold periodic Quality Service Reviews \n(QSR) at HFW sites. Current efforts based upon recent QSR findings \ninclude:  \n•  In the fall of 2023, CYFD BHS began working with Providers statewide to \nevolve the monthly coordination meeting to increase review by program \nexpectations  data,  including  referrals,  enrollment,  and  capacity  rates. \nCYFD-BHS will provide technical assistance when these data points are \nbelow best practice benchmarks.  \n•  CYFD-BHS is implementing training for supervisors, through its coaching \nmodel,  on  the  use  of  data  to  monitor  program  implementations \nexpectations.   This  training  includes  regular  pulls  of  data  from  the \nWraparound  databases,  specifically  referrals,  enrollment,  and  practice \nexpectations.  CYFD-BHS, in partnership with NMSU-COI and the UNM \nEvaluation team, is also reviewing and will then adapt its training regarding \nevaluation and data collection.  \n  \n5.   Critical Incident Review (FSA BTO2,3, 4)  \n \nCYFD acknowledges the need for improvement in identifying, reporting, and addressing \ncritical incidents. We have drafted and are finalizing a directive regarding critical incident \nreporting  which  will  be  provided  to  the  Co-Neutrals  on  Thursday,  March  14th  for \nreview.   The following actions are underway to improve compliance with BTO2,3,4. \n     \n \n        \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: 0257C5DA-5485-40C4-A5CA-CF9112B40DF7\nMarch 12, 2024 \nPage 7 of 8 \n \n \nWe continue to meet with our partners to include Treatment Foster Care providers to \ndevelop a more robust and appropriate placement option for difficult to place youth \n(including our youth who are in congregate care settings).    \n  \n6.  Joint Power Agreement and Tribal Resources (FSA Appendix C)  \n \nCYFD  essentially  agrees  with  the  statements  regarding  JPA  and  Tribal  Resources, \nhowever, CYFD further states that the following actions demonstrate compliance with FSA \nCAP Appendix C:  \n  \n•  CYFD did reach out and met with the five New Mexico N/P/Ts with most \nchildren in state custody. During the CAP period CYFD sought to meet with \nall remaining New Mexico N/P/Ts and those efforts continue. During \ndiscussions with all N/P/Ts on JPAs, the discussion items identified in the \nCAP are raised by the state. OTA has received permission from 3 N/P/Ts to \ndisclose information regarding JPA negotiations with the Co-Neutrals and \nhas provided the same permission to the Co-Neutrals. \n•  CYFD has revised its licensing standards effective January 2024 and the \nsame are publicly available at https://www.cyfd.nm.gov/policies/.   \n•  OTA is in discussion with N/P/Ts on a recruitment and retention plan(s) that \ncenters Native children, family, and community.   \n•  OTA is the primary facilitator of OOPP meetings and gathers feedback at \nweekly meetings. CYFD’s OOPP policy was revised and made effective \nDecember 1, 2023. The first level review is carried out weekly on Mondays \nand Thursdays and upstaffings with leadership from OTA and PS occur \nweekly on Mondays. \n•  A pilot is underway and a written template for access to financial resources \nis in progress at CYFD. Feedback on the same is solicited weekly at \nstanding  meetings  with  N/P/T  representatives.  CYFD  has  reviewed \nadministrative barriers regarding access to funds and are pending resolution \nin the final template mentioned above.  \n•  CYFD provides N/P/Ts with free access to all Workforce Development \ntraining provided to CYFD staff as well as CYFD’s trauma training. CYFD \nalso sought to make funding through Title IV-E, Title IV-B, and State \nGeneral Funds available to N/P/Ts. CYFD is offering, through available \nchannels, funding to two (2) interested N/P/Ts for activities to include \nculturally responsive home studies. To date, no additional requests for \nfunding from interested N/P/Ts have been received by CYFD.   \n•  CYFD created a process for N/P/Ts to request data, but no requests have \nbeen received to date. OTA continues to send quarterly data to all N/P/Ts.  \n•  OTA and PSD meet monthly, and the PSD director joins quarterly.   \n•  OTA sent a report to the Co-Neutrals on barriers to timely notification on \nNovember 1, 2023. CYFD has also implemented Pre- and Post-Initiation \n     \n \n        \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: 0257C5DA-5485-40C4-A5CA-CF9112B40DF7\nMarch 12, 2024 \nPage 8 of 8 \n \nstaffing forms including solicitation of information on whether a child is a \nmember of an N/P/T or if there is reason to know.  \n•  Finally, CYFD and HSD hosted an event on November 28, 2023, to provide \nN/P/Ts an opportunity to learn more about Kevin S., its deliverables, and an \ninvitation to both Plaintiffs and the Co-Neutrals was extended.  \n  \n7.  Well- Child Visits (FSA DTO4)  \n \nGenerally, the state agrees with the statements the Co-Neutrals have made regarding well-\nchild visits. However, as the Co-Neutrals did not consider HSD billing or service dates \nprovided (data used under the Data Validation Plan for the Annual Report) and as the state \nhad late data entries, the state counts are slightly inconsistent with the numbers reported by \nthe Co-Neutrals. \n \nAs noted by the Co-Neutrals, the state did hire an EPSDT Coordinator and has been \nworking with the Department of Health since late summer 2023 including establishing a \nMemorandum of Understanding with the Department of Health. The State has also begun \nto track at more frequent intervals data surrounding well-child visits for children in care \nfor 30 days or longer. Consistent practice has remained a challenge statewide, although \nHSD has seen progress toward compliance month over month since implementation of the \nCAP. \n \n8.  Data Submissions   \n  \nThe State agrees with the Co-Neutrals. Due to technical difficulties, not all medical \nnecessity  determination  documentation  for  new  in-  and  out-of-state  congregate  care \nplacements has been provided. However, at the time of writing those issues have been \nresolved and the state has provided most documentation requested. CYFD produced TFC \nhome numbers for the Co-Neutrals earlier this year and is in the process of working with \nTFC agencies to be able to provide 2023 TFC home numbers for quarters 3 and 4.  \n  \nWe encourage continued conversations to ensure the safety and wellbeing for all New Mexican \nchildren.    \n \nVery truly yours, \n \n \n \nTeresa Casados, Cabinet Secretary    Kari Armijo, Cabinet Secretary \nChildren, Youth and Families Dept.

This action is brought by fourteen foster children1 and by non-profit organizations \nDisability Rights New Mexico and Native American Disability Law Center on behalf of a class of \ntrauma-impacted children in the custody of New Mexico’s child welfare system (collectively, \n“Plaintiffs”) against the state officials responsible for administering and supervising New Mexico’s \nsystems for child welfare and delivery of Medicaid services to eligible children (“Defendants”). \n2.  New Mexico has profoundly and consistently failed to fulfill the federal legal \nobligations it owes to the foster children entrusted to its care, with tragic and enduring consequences \nfor the health, safety, and life chances of a generation of the nation’s most vulnerable children.2 \nNumerous federal and state laws reflect and enforce the long-settled determination that when a child \nis unsafe in his or her home, the state has an obligation to step in and provide what all children need \nto succeed and thrive: a safe and stable place to live and the necessary support and services to meet \ntheir medical, mental health, and behavioral needs. But New Mexico’s broken system of child \nwelfare fails to provide the stability and support that children in state custody need to be safe and \nhealthy, locking New Mexico’s foster children into a vicious cycle of declining physical, mental \nand behavioral health and increasingly inappropriate, restrictive, and punitive placements and \ntreatment.  \n                                                 \n1 Plaintiffs are minor children and are referred to in this Complaint by pseudonyms. Plaintiffs have \nconcurrently filed a Motion to Proceed Using Fictitious Names. \n2  See,  e.g.,  Annie  E.  Casey  Foundation,  2018  Kids  Count  Data  Book  at  21,  available  at \nhttp://www.aecf.org/m/resourcedoc/aecf-2018kidscountdatabook-2018.pdf (ranking New Mexico \nlast in overall childhood well-being). The phrase “foster children” is used in this complaint to refer \nto children in the legal custody of New Mexico’s Children, Youth and Families Department due to \nallegations of abuse, neglect, or abandonment pursuant to NMSA 1978 § 32A-4-1 et seq.  \n  2 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 3 of 99\n3.  New Mexico’s system of child welfare has repeatedly failed federal audits, has \nconsistently fallen short of national, research-based standards for adequate levels of staffing, and is \namong the worst in the nation. Its most glaring structural deficiencies fall into three inter-connected \nareas: \n4.  First, because New Mexico lacks a system to ensure stable placement in safe and \nsupportive home environments, foster children are routinely cycled through numerous short-term \nemergency  shelters,3  foster  placements,4  residential  treatment  facilities,5  hospitals—even \novernights in state government offices—that are inappropriate, overly restrictive, and lack the \n                                                 \n3 Emergency crisis centers, also known as homeless shelters for the general youth population, are \nmeant to be short-term placements (no more than 90 days) until a long-term solution can be \narranged. Emergency crisis centers house foster children, along with homeless non-foster children, \nsome in a dorm-room setting, usually with two or three youth to a room, where the youth are free \nto come and go, subject to curfews. In practice, CYFD will cycle children through multiple \nsuccessive crisis centers throughout the state and away from their schools and communities in an \nattempt to circumvent the 90-day limit, using these shelters as placements of first resort. \n4 Treatment foster care (also referred to as therapeutic foster care) is a Medicaid funded placement \ndesigned to provide therapeutic care in a structured home environment, with treatment families who \nhave specialized training to care for children and youth with significant emotional, behavioral, or \nsocial  issues  or  medical  needs.  U.S.  DEPARTMENT  OF  HEALTH  &  HUMAN  SERVICES,  CHILD \nWELFARE INFORMATION GATEWAY, TREATMENT FOSTER CARE, https://www.childwelfare.gov/ \ntopics/outofhome/foster-care/treat-foster/. In practice, however, New Mexico’s treatment foster \nparents often do not receive sufficient training to meet their foster placements’ needs. Moreover, \ntreatment foster care is a Medicaid service that requires a finding of medical necessity. Hence by \nits nature, treatment foster care necessarily is a short-term placement designed to address a specific \nneed and children must be discharged when the child no longer needs that level of care. \n5 Residential treatment centers are high-cost placements paid for by Medicaid for foster children \nwith significant mental illnesses or behavioral problems and provide inpatient therapeutic services \nin an institutional setting that the youth are not permitted to leave. Like treatment foster care, \nresidential treatment centers require a medical necessity determination. While treatment foster care \nand residential treatment centers both were designed to treat particular mental health and behavioral \nconditions in therapeutic settings, they function in practice as increasingly punitive housing \nfacilities  for  foster  children  who  have  experienced  challenges  in  less-restrictive  placements, \nregardless of true medical necessity. In other words, if a youth “acts out” in a regular foster home, \nhe or she will be sent to a treatment foster care facility. If the youth then “acts out” in treatment \nfoster care, he or she will be sent to a residential treatment facility, without a medical determination \nto confirm such placement is appropriate. \n  3 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 4 of 99\nsupport and capacity to meet the individual needs of the children placed there. Moreover, defaulting \nto placements in institutional settings such as shelters, residential treatment centers, and hospitals \ndenies  foster  children  the  opportunity  to  develop  sustaining  relationships  with  stable,  adult \ncaretakers as surrogate parents. In an approximately two-year period, for example, Plaintiff Diana \nD. has been repeatedly transferred among at least eleven short-term, inappropriate and unsafe \nplacements,  including  emergency  crisis  shelters,  treatment  foster  care,  residential  treatment \nfacilities, and multiple psychiatric hospitals. This grim pattern is the inevitable consequence of the \nNew Mexico Children Youth and Family Department (“CYFD”) and the New Mexico Human \nServices Department’s (“HSD”) failure to recruit, license, train, and support sufficient numbers of \nappropriate foster care placements and its failure to hire, train, and support staff and service \nproviders in sufficient numbers and with appropriate expertise. CYFD’s and HSD’s failure to \nmaintain a system to ensure appropriate placements prevents children from developing stable bonds \nwith a caretaker; interrupts delivery of medical, mental, and behavioral health care; and disrupts \nschool attendance and educational attainment. In sum, Defendants’ failures harm the health, well-\nbeing, and life chances of foster children. \n5.  Second, because New Mexico lacks a functioning system to meet the medical, \nmental health, and behavioral needs of children in state custody, these children are likewise denied \naccess  to  necessary  services,  including  the  federally  mandated  medical,  mental  health,  and \nbehavioral health screenings and services provided by New Mexico’s Medicaid program to which \nvirtually all such children are entitled. CYFD and HSD must evaluate a child’s health within thirty \ndays of entering state custody and ensure a coordinated and integrated system of care in the least \nrestrictive environment. 42 U.S.C. § 622(b)(2). But children languish in state custody without \nreceiving appropriate screening, much less appropriate or consistent services.  For example, \n  4 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 5 of 99\nPlaintiff David G. was not provided an appropriate psychological evaluation or care coordinator \nuntil he had been in CYFD custody for more than two years. During this time, he was repeatedly \nprescribed inappropriate psychotropic medication, requiring him to be taken to the emergency room \non at least two occasions. CYFD’s and HSD’s failure to implement a system capable of promptly \nscreening, diagnosing, and providing a spectrum of appropriate, consistent therapeutic services in \na community setting causes notable deterioration of the physical, mental, and behavioral health of \nchildren in state custody, leading to unnecessary placement in residential facilities, often out of \nstate, that—as CYFD and HSD have stated—are costly to the state and have not been shown to be \neffective.6 \n6.  These systemic deficiencies are particularly devastating and legally indefensible \nbecause the very purpose of the state’s system of child welfare is to serve children who have been \nentrusted  to  state  custody  due  to  their  experience  with  tragic  traumas  such  as  child  abuse, \nabandonment, and neglect.  \n7.  Third, because New Mexico’s child welfare system has failed to implement trauma-\nsensitive practices, children in state custody are unable to access even the limited services that are \navailable. CYFD and HSD know that New Mexico foster children are highly likely to have \nexperienced complex trauma, a term that describes children’s exposure to multiple, persistent \nsources of adversity, violence, and loss, as well as the impact of this exposure. Every child entering \nthe child welfare system has, at minimum, experienced the trauma of child abuse, abandonment, or \n                                                 \n6 Results First: Children’s Behavioral Health, presented to the N.M. Legislative Finance Committee \nJune 7, 2017, at 33 (hereinafter “Results First”), https://www.nmlegis.gov/Entity/LFC/Documents/ \nResults_First/Results%20First%20Children%27s%20Behavioral%20Health.pdf.  For  example, \nCYFD and HSD reported that New Mexico spends $68 million a year to treat the five most \nexpensive child behavioral health disorders. Estimates show that New Mexico loses $8 billion in \nlifetime earnings for children currently affected by substance abuse and psychological disorders. \n  5 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 6 of 99\nneglect, and separation from a caregiver. As the experiences of the individual Plaintiffs reflect, the \ntraumas to which youth in the foster system are subjected include, but are not limited to, physical, \nemotional,  and  sexual  abuse;  emotional  and  physical  neglect;  homelessness;  the  death, \nincarceration, or deportation of a parent; domestic violence; and parental substance abuse, mental \nillness, or involvement in sex work.  \n8.  Publicly available data show that foster children in New Mexico are particularly \nlikely to have experienced multiple forms of trauma prior to entering state custody. New Mexico \nhas the highest rate of childhood trauma exposure in the country, with 18% of all children in the \nstate having  experienced three or more significant traumatic experiences.7 New Mexico has \nrepeatedly been ranked last in the country in overall child well-being and currently has the nation’s \nhighest rate of child poverty.8 \n9.  Medical and social science have firmly established that such exposure to complex \ntrauma  significantly  impacts  brain  activity,  function,  and  development,  particularly  in  the \ndeveloping brain of a child or young person. When unaddressed, the neurobiological effects of \ntrauma exposure often result in predictable changes to numerous essential functions and life \nactivities  including  behavior,  emotional  self-regulation,  concentration,  sleep,  and  cognition. \nChildren and young people in state custody who are affected by trauma require accommodations in \nthe form of system-wide, trauma-sensitive policies and practices in order to access the child welfare \nand Medicaid services and benefits to which they are entitled. As administrators of state agencies \ncharged  with  protecting  the  health  and  safety  of  children  who  have  experienced  abuse, \n                                                 \n7 The Prevalence of  Adverse Childhood Experiences, Nationally, By State, and By Race or \nEthnicity, CHILD TRENDS,  Feb.  12,  2018,  https://www.childtrends.org/publications/prevalence-\nadverse-childhood-experiences-nationally-state-race-ethnicity.  \n8 2018 Kids Count Data Book, supra note 2, at 21, 26. \n  6 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 7 of 99\nabandonment, and neglect, CYFD and HSD have an obligation to establish and maintain a system \nof care that anticipates and is capable of meeting the needs of the children for whom the system is \nbuilt. But New Mexico’s fractured system of child welfare lacks even the rudimentary elements of \na trauma-informed system of care, elements that are necessary to ensure meaningful access to \nappropriate placements and delivery of medical, mental, and behavioral health services.  \n10.  Worse  yet, New  Mexico’s child welfare practices systematically  re-traumatize \nvulnerable children. The predictable result of New Mexico’s failure to recruit an adequate number \nof foster care parents has been to subject children to a series of temporary placements in which any \nbonds they can form with caregivers are promptly broken. Inadequate placement options result in \nchildren being situated in overly restrictive environments, where they may suffer additional trauma \nfrom the effects of restraint, seclusion, or even violence. Compounding the trauma, New Mexico \nhas failed to adequately train its staff and foster parents on childhood trauma or to help them in \ndealing with the secondary trauma that they themselves often suffer. Ill-prepared to understand and \nrespond to trauma, those on the front lines of New Mexico’s child welfare system may inadvertently \nsubject children in their care to additional trauma. \n11.   Federal and state laws recognize the state’s obligation to safeguard the rights, \nhealth, and well-being of children in state custody who, by definition, have no parent or guardian \ncapable of advocating on their behalf. Yet CYFD and HSD have repeatedly shown disregard for \nand deliberate indifference to this fundamental duty, at tragic cost to the health, well-being, and life \nchances of the children in CYFD custody.  \na.  For children who have experienced complex trauma that substantially limits \nmajor life activities, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title II of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) require CYFD and HSD to ensure \n  7 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 8 of 99\nmeaningful access to the public benefits, including the child welfare and Medical \nbenefits, to which these children are entitled. Yet CYFD and HSD operate \nsystems that fail to reasonably accommodate the impact of complex trauma, and \neven re-traumatize children and inflict further harm. \nb.  To  provide  meaningful  access  to  the  child  welfare  system  and  the  state’s \nMedicaid program, CYFD and HSD must have a system for addressing the needs \nof children with disabilities who are impacted by complex trauma by providing \ntrauma-sensitive approaches and training that have been shown to mitigate the \neffects of trauma. CYFD and HSD must also avoid repeated transfers of children \namong inappropriate facilities. These transfers subject children to new traumas, \nworsen their conditions, and further limit their ability to access the foster care \nand Medicaid systems. CYFD and HSD must also offer adequate medical, \nmental, and behavioral health screening, treatment, and monitoring to avoid \nexacerbating the effects of past trauma (including any trauma resulting from \nCYFD’s or HSD’s own acts) in order for these children to have meaningful \naccess to the state’s foster care and Medicaid services. \nc.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title II of the ADA also require that \nchildren be placed in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs. But \nCYFD and HSD frequently violate this requirement by administering a system \nthat places children in unduly restrictive residential treatment facilities rather \nthan appropriate community-based placements.  \nd.  The Fourteenth Amendment’s Substantive Due Process Clause imposes a \nduty on state officials to keep children in foster care reasonably safe from harm. \n  8 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 9 of 99\nInstead, CYFD’s and HSD’s failure to implement a trauma-informed system that \nensures appropriate placements and delivery of medical, mental health, and \nbehavioral health services threatens the health, safety, and welfare of children in \nCYFD’s and HSD’s custody. \ne.  The Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq., requires HSD, as the single state \nagency designated to administer New Mexico’s Medicaid program, to arrange \nfor early screening and diagnostic services that would determine the existence \nof physical or mental illnesses or behavioral health conditions, to do so with \nreasonable promptness, to arrange for necessary medical, mental, and behavioral \nhealth services, and to inform eligible children of these available services. But \nCYFD and HSD have failed to create a system of care capable of assessing the \nneeds of children in the child welfare system and delivering appropriate services. \nf.  The Indian Child Welfare Act (“ICWA”), 25 U.S.C. § 1915(a), (b), sets forth \nstandards to meet the needs of children covered by ICWA, including that Native \nchildren in foster care be placed in the least restrictive setting that approximates \na family and that they receive placements consistent with ICWA’s placement \npreferences. 25 U.S.C. 1915(b). But CYFD and HSD have failed to maintain a \nsystem capable of complying with these ICWA obligations, resulting in, among \nother problems, the cycling of Native children in custody through multiple, non-\npreferred placements. \n12.  CYFD and HSD know that their broken child welfare system is inflicting harm on \nthe children in its care, and they also know how to fix it. Section VII of this Complaint catalogues \nrepeated acknowledgments by CYFD and HSD that New Mexico’s system of child welfare is \n  9 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 10 of 99\nfailing to meet the needs of children in its custody, failing to meet federal standards, deteriorating \nin performance, and causing devastating harm to foster children across the state.  \n13.  CYFD  and  HSD  have  also  acknowledged  that  evidence-based,  high-quality \nsolutions are available; namely, a trauma-informed system of care capable of supporting and \nhealing foster children who have experienced abuse, abandonment, and neglect. Experts agree that \nsuch a system must include the following core elements: (1) building human capital, including \nsufficient numbers of case workers, foster parents, and mental health professionals with appropriate \nexpertise and training; (2) screening for trauma and prompt provision of appropriate, adequate, and \ncoordinated medical, mental health, and behavioral health services; (3) monitoring a child’s health \nand treatment; (4) ensuring appropriate placements and placement supports; and (5) implementing \na wraparound model that facilitates collaboration among parties responsible for care and service \nprovision, an individualized planning process for each child, and a focus on sustaining relationships. \n14.  Because New Mexico has failed to comply with its statutory and constitutional \nobligations, and because that failure has inflicted enormous harm on the Plaintiff-children and other \nchildren who are similarly situated, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that this Court order implementation \nof a trauma-informed care system for New Mexico’s trauma-impacted foster care children. \n \nPARTIES \nA.

Plaintiff Kevin S. is a Latino fourteen-year-old from Bernalillo County. He \nentered CYFD custody in 2009 due to physical abuse, sexual abuse, and neglect. Kevin S. \nreturned to his mother’s custody in 2013. In 2016, his mother requested he be placed back in \nCYFD custody. Kevin S.’s mother was previously missing and is not a consistent presence in \nKevin S.’s life. Kevin S. likes skateboarding, riding his bike, and listening to all kinds of music, \nincluding rap and country. Kevin S. wants to attend college, where he hopes to play basketball or \nfootball. \n17.  Kevin S. is enrolled in Medicaid. \n18.  Kevin S. has experienced multiple forms of trauma, including repeated childhood \nsexual abuse by his mothers’ partners, physical abuse, exposure to domestic violence, neglect, and \nseparation from a caregiver.  \n19.  Kevin S. has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar I, insomnia, \nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder, reactive attachment disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation \ndisorder, borderline intellectual functioning, and learning disorders. Kevin S. has difficulty making \ndecisions, planning, communicating, focusing, sleeping, understanding cues and communications \nfrom others, and sitting still. As a result of his exposure to repeated and sustained trauma, Kevin S. \nsometimes experiences behavioral challenges, such as periodic outbursts. \n20.  Despite his diagnoses and exposure to repeated and sustained trauma, Kevin S. has \nnot received adequate mental and behavioral health services to which he is entitled through \nMedicaid while in CYFD custody. From 2009 to 2013, Kevin S. received insufficient services and \ntreatment, and his behavioral challenges have continued to escalate. In 2013, Kevin S. was returned \n  11 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 12 of 99\nto his mother who, unable to manage his escalating behavior, sent him to a residential treatment \ncenter in Texas for two years. Since he reentered CYFD custody in 2016, he has continued to \nreceive insufficient treatment. Across placements, he has received only phone counseling with his \nmother, inadequate counseling, or no counseling at all.  \n21.  CYFD has cycled Kevin S. through at least eleven placements during his two times \nin state custody. When he entered the child welfare system for the second time in September 2016, \nat age twelve, Kevin S. was placed in an emergency youth shelter for ages sixteen to twenty-one \nfor approximately one week. After that, he spent two nights sleeping in the CYFD office, which \nhas neither a formal sleeping space nor a shower. Due to the fact that CYFD staff are not equipped \nto securely monitor children in the office overnight, Kevin S. was able to run away and was found \ndodging in and out of traffic. CYFD then sent Kevin S. to a residential treatment center in Colorado, \nwhere he was repeatedly harmed by both staff and other residents. Kevin S. was restrained multiple \ntimes a week for substantial periods of time, sometimes for an entire hour, by staff. He was also \nrepeatedly harmed by other children at the center, including receiving black eyes and other facial \nwounds. Even though CYFD received multiple incident reports detailing how Kevin S. had been \nrepeatedly harmed by both staff and other residents, CYFD kept him at this placement for a year. \nDue to CYFD’s inability to secure a single placement in New Mexico, CYFD subsequently sent \nKevin S. to another out-of-state residential treatment center in Utah. Since Kevin S. arrived at the \nUtah facility in September of 2017, he has been cycled through three different facilities within the \ncenter. Even though Kevin S. has been in this placement for months, his CYFD Permanency \nPlanning Worker has still not visited him.  \n22.  Kevin S. brings this action through his Next Friend Bette Fleishman. \n  12 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 13 of 99\n23.  Plaintiff  Chris  W.  is  an  African-American  fourteen-year-old  from  Torrance \nCounty. He entered CYFD custody in April 2016 when his mom died of asthma. Chris W.’s father \nhas been in and out of prison and is currently incarcerated. He loves boxing and playing musical \ninstruments. His goal is to be reunited with his two brothers and to have a home. \n24.  Chris W. is enrolled in Medicaid. \n25.  Chris W. has experienced multiple forms of trauma, including the death of a parent, \nincarceration of a parent, parental substance abuse, and separation from a caregiver. \n26.  Chris  W.  sometimes  experiences  behavioral  challenges,  including  outbursts. \nChris W.  has  difficulty  making  decisions,  planning,  communicating,  focusing,  sleeping,  and \nunderstanding cues and communications from others. He has been diagnosed with post-traumatic \nstress disorder, behavioral dysregulation, oppositional defiant disorder, intermittent explosive \ndisorder, and additional trauma-related disorders, among other diagnoses. \n27.  Despite his exposure to repeated and sustained trauma and his diagnoses, Chris W. \nhas not received adequate medical, mental, and behavioral health services to which he is entitled \nthrough Medicaid while in CYFD custody. Chris W. did not receive any individual therapy until he \nhad been in CYFD custody for nearly four months. Two years into custody, Chris W. has still not \nbeen provided with grief counseling, even though he was very close to his mother and her death \nwas the cause of his entry into CYFD custody.  \n28.  CYFD has cycled Chris W. through at least nine placements in the two years since \nhe entered CYFD’s custody. Chris W. and his two brothers were initially placed together with a \nfoster family in Edgewood, but when CYFD and HSD failed to provide any supports for his foster \nparents, they requested that Chris W. be removed. CYFD separated Chris W. from his siblings and \ncycled him through several placements, including another foster home, multiple short-term shelters, \n  13 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 14 of 99\nand a residential treatment center. Chris W. stayed at the residential treatment center for only a few \nmonths and was provided with inadequate services. He was blamed for his lack of response to \ninadequate services, repeatedly restrained, and forced to move from one section of the center to \nanother almost every night for months. In the two months after he left the residential treatment \ncenter, Chris W. was cycled through four placements, including multiple short-term youth shelters \nin Taos and Albuquerque and a treatment foster home in Las Cruces. When the treatment foster \nhome notified CYFD that it was going to discharge Chris W. due to behavioral issues, CYFD could \nnot identify a single placement in New Mexico that would accept Chris W. Chris W. ran away and \nwent missing for nearly a month. After Chris W. was found, only one placement in New Mexico, a \nresidential treatment center in Albuquerque, accepted his application for placement. Within a month \nhe was thrown out of that facility, housed in a juvenile detention center and is currently out of state \nin a treatment center in Arizona. \n29.  Chris W. brings this action through his Next Friend Bette Fleishman. \n30.  Plaintiff Jennifer H. is a bi-racial 17-year-old from Socorro County who first \nentered CYFD custody in May of 2014 due to emotional abuse by her grandmother. In August of \n2014, Jennifer H. was returned to her grandmother, who then asked that she be placed back in \nCYFD custody in September of 2016. Jennifer H.’s father is deceased, and her mother does not \nhave a consistent presence in Jennifer H.’s life.  \n31.  Jennifer H. is enrolled in Medicaid. \n32.  Jennifer H. has experienced multiple forms of trauma, including emotional abuse, \nalleged sexual abuse, death of a parent, and separation from a caregiver.  \n33.  Jennifer H. sometimes experiences behavioral challenges, including running away. \nJennifer H. has difficulty making decisions, planning, communicating, focusing, sleeping, and \n  14 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 15 of 99\nunderstanding cues and communications from others. She has been diagnosed with post-traumatic \nstress disorder, depression, anxiety, and oppositional defiant disorder.  \n34.  Despite her exposure to repeated and sustained trauma and her diagnoses, Jennifer \nH. has not received adequate medical, mental, and behavioral health services to which she is entitled \nthrough Medicaid while in CYFD custody. Although a psychological evaluation stated that she \nneeded targeted analytic behavior therapy and structured peer interactions, CYFD has repeatedly \nplaced her in unstructured environments that have resulted in her running away. Jennifer H.’s \ntherapist indicated that she needs an attachment model and trauma-informed services. \n35.  CYFD has cycled Jennifer H. through at least nine placements since she entered \nCYFD custody in 2016, including a shelter and multiple residential treatment centers, treatment \nfoster care placements, multiple foster homes, and children’s psychiatric centers. In one foster \nhome, Jennifer H. alleged she was the victim of sexual abuse from her foster father. After she \nalleged sexual abuse, CYFD was unable to identify a single placement that would accept Jennifer \nH. CYFD’s “solution” was to remove Jennifer H. from New Mexico and send her to a residential \ntreatment center approximately one thousand miles away in Missouri. By cycling Jennifer H. \nthrough numerous facilities and ultimately transferring her across the country, CYFD and HSD \nhave prevented Jennifer H. from receiving consistent care or forming a stable relationship with a \ntherapist or foster parent, and have inflicted additional trauma on Jennifer H. \n36.  Jennifer H. brings this action through her Next Friend Liz McGrath.  \n37.  Plaintiff Diana D. is a sixteen-year-old from San Juan County who is enrolled with \nthe Navajo Nation. She is a child covered by the Indian Child Welfare Act (“ICWA”). In particular, \nbecause Diana D. is enrolled with the Navajo Nation, she meets the definition of an “Indian child” \nunder ICWA. See 25 U.S.C. § 1903(4).  \n  15 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 16 of 99\n38.  For most of Diana D.’s life, her mother has struggled with substance abuse and \nchronic homelessness. As a result, Diana D. has spent much of her life in a shelter for homeless \nyouth in Farmington, New Mexico. Diana D. entered CYFD custody in 2016. Diana D.’s mother \nreportedly continues to struggle with substance abuse and homelessness. Her father has been absent \nmost of her life and his location is unknown. Diana D. enjoys watching movies, playing the clarinet, \ndrawing, writing poetry, and reading mystery books.  \n39.  Diana D. is enrolled in Medicaid. \n40.  Diana D. has experienced multiple forms of trauma, including substance abuse and \nneglect by her mother, sexual abuse by an older brother, chronic homelessness, consistent bullying \nat school, and separation from a caregiver.  \n41.  As a result of the repeated and sustained trauma that Diana D. has experienced, \nDiana D. has trouble regulating her emotions, making decisions, focusing, interpreting cues from \nothers, sleeping, eating, accepting change, and forming trusting relationships with peers or adults. \nDiana D. has difficulty focusing because she frequently ruminates on the neglect she experienced \ngrowing up as well as her mother’s substance abuse and homelessness. She feels guilt and shame \nthat her two older sisters had to care for her because of their absent mother, and she blames herself \nfor her siblings’ entry into CYFD custody. She has great difficulty communicating about her \nexperiences with abuse and neglect and sometimes denies them. During her time in CYFD custody, \nDiana D. has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation \ndisorder, recurrent major depressive disorder with severe psychotic symptoms, bipolar 1, an eating \ndisorder,  complex  neurodevelopmental  trauma,  and  borderline  personality  traits.  A  recent \nneuropsychological evaluation suggested that Diana D. may have schizoaffective disorder, although \nher current treating psychiatrist has ruled the disorder out at this time due to her age and the complex \n  16 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 17 of 99\ntrauma she has experienced. As of November 2018, her residential treatment center said her current \ndiagnoses are: PTSD and recurrent major depressive disorder with severe psychotic symptoms.  \n42.  Despite her diagnoses and exposure to repeated and sustained trauma, Diana D. has \nnot received adequate medical, mental, and behavioral health services to which she is entitled \nthrough Medicaid while in CYFD custody. She did not receive any services until she had been in \nCYFD custody for over a month, and she waited over a year and a half for a neuropsychological \nevaluation. She finally received the neuropsychological evaluation in May 2018. Nor has Diana D. \nbeen provided with continuity of care; despite her known serious emotional and mental health \nneeds, Diana D. has gone weeks at a time without any services, and had three different therapists \nwithin the first two months of her most recent residential treatment center placement. Within a one-\nyear period, she has been prescribed at least nine different psychiatric medications by physicians at \nsix placements and additional medications to address medication-induced symptoms, including \nCogentin for medication-induced tics. Currently, Diana D. is taking Wellbutrin for depression and \nmood, Seroquel for PTSD and mood, Prazosin for PTSD and nightmares, Miralax and a multi-\nvitamin. Diana D. recently asked for an increase in her Prazosin to help her sleep because her \nnightmares are worsening. \n43.  Since Diana D. entered CYFD custody in October 2016, CYFD has cycled her \nthrough at least eleven placements, including a crisis shelter, various hospitals, a treatment foster \ncare, and residential treatment centers. In violation of ICWA’s list of preferential placements, none \nof CYFD’s placements for Diana D. have been with a Navajo foster family or other Native \nAmerican care provider. In November 2018, Diana D. was discharged from a residential treatment \ncenter to a treatment foster care placement.  Although Diana D. expressed her wish to be placed in \na community setting, due to the lack of available community-based placements she was instead \n  17 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 18 of 99\nplaced into treatment foster care.  Diana D.’s treatment foster care placement is a short-term \nplacement that is only available to her as long as it is deemed medically necessary.  Diana D. \npreviously resided in this treatment foster care placement from March 3, 2017 to June 5, 2017, \nwhen the placement was disrupted after, due to inappropriate supervision, Diana D. ingested an \nunknown substance, and held a knife to herself.  \n44.  Due to CYFD’s failure to provide stability and appropriate medical, mental, and \nbehavioral health services to which she is entitled through Medicaid, Diana D.’s mental health has \nnotably  deteriorated.  When  Diana  D.  entered  CYFD  custody,  she  cracked  jokes,  enjoyed \nsocializing, was open and communicative with her Youth Attorney and participated actively in team \ntreatment meetings. After nearly two years in CYFD custody, Diana D. is mostly uncommunicative \nin team treatment meetings, avoids speaking of her past, and has conveyed that she does not want \nto participate in or receive updates about in-person or telephonic court hearings. Due to the failure \nto address the impact of trauma on Diana D.’s health, she has experienced behavioral challenges \nwhich have resulted in her removal from placements and further disruption of her medical, mental, \nand behavioral health services. This has prevented her from forming a stable relationship with a \nfoster parent. \n45.  Diana D. also has not received adequate, continuous, and timely dental care. Diana \nD. received braces when she was first placed in Albuquerque, but when she was moved to \nFarmington, she was not provided an orthodontist. As a result, Diana D. suffered from broken \nbraces cutting her mouth for over six months. To date, upon information and belief, Diana D. has \nonly seen the orthodontist twice; her residential treatment center failed to transport her for one \nappointment and took her to the wrong provider on another occasion. Diana D. only recently saw \nher orthodontist to get her upper braces maintained.  \n  18 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 19 of 99\n46.  Due to multiple placements, placements with inadequate educational opportunities, \nand CYFD’s failure to inform placements of Diana D.’s special education needs, Diana D.’s \neducation has suffered. Diana D. did not earn a single high school credit for months at one of her \nplacements, a residential treatment center. At her most recent prior placement, another residential \ntreatment center, Diana D. was provided with limited instruction in a basement because she was not \naccepted into the facility’s charter school, which uses a lottery system. Diana D. received 5.5 high \nschool credits as a ninth grader. Even though this instruction was provided on the grounds of the \nresidential treatment center, Diana D. was subject to a daily “blanket search”: every day after \nschool, she is required to strip down to her underwear behind a blanket so that her clothes can be \nsearched before returning to her unit. In addition to being deprived of an adequate school setting, it \nis unclear whether Diana D. is being provided with special education services. Diana D. was \npreviously  identified  as  needing  special  education  services  as  a  student  with  an  emotional \ndisturbance, but CYFD had failed to ensure that Diana D. had an individualized education plan \n(IEP) in place. Diana D.’s November 2018 placement change in placement required her to change \nschools during the school year.  She is currently enrolled in the tenth grade at her local high school, \nbut her Youth Attorney has not been informed as to whether her new school has received her IEP \nfrom her prior educational placement.     \n47.  Diana D. brings this action through her Next Friend Ernestina R. Cruz. \n48.  Plaintiff  Brian  J.  is  a  Latino  thirteen-year-old  from  Bernalillo  and  Valencia \nCounties. He entered CYFD custody in May 2017 with his two brothers after a CYFD safety plan \nfailed to prevent them from being physically abused. His father has been incarcerated for the \nmajority of the past ten years as a result of multiple domestic violence convictions for abusing Brian \nJ., his brothers, and their mother. Brian J. enjoys going to the pool with his brothers and friends.  \n  19 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 20 of 99\n49.  Brian J. is enrolled in Medicaid. \n50.  Brian J. has experienced multiple forms of trauma, including physical abuse by \nmultiple family members, exposure to domestic violence, living with a caregiver with untreated \nmental health challenges, and separation from a caregiver due to incarceration. \n51.  As a result of sustained and repeated exposure to trauma, Brian J. has difficulty \nconcentrating,  responding  appropriately  to  redirection,  self-regulating  emotionally,  and \nunderstanding and complying with directives. Brian J. has also been diagnosed with attention-\ndeficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, specific learning disorder (with moderate to severe \nimpairment in reading, written expression, and arithmetic), adjustment disorder with anxiety, \nsibling relational problems, and borderline intellectual functioning.  \n52.  Despite his exposure to repeated and sustained trauma and his diagnoses, Brian J. \nhas not received adequate medical, mental, and behavioral health services to which he is entitled \nthrough Medicaid while in CYFD custody. Brian J. did not receive a comprehensive psychological \nevaluation until he had been in custody for eleven months. This evaluation recommended that Brian \nJ. meet with a child psychiatrist for a medication evaluation, but none has been provided. The only \nmental health support that Brian J. received during his entire first year in CYFD custody was a few \nweeks of therapy that Brian J.’s aunt secured without the assistance of CYFD. CYFD failed to \nfollow up on Brian J.’s needed services and he was not re-enrolled in counseling for several months. \n53.  CYFD has cycled Brian J. through five placements since he entered CYFD custody \napproximately sixteen months ago. Due to the absence of placements in Brian J.’s hometown, he \nand his brothers were first sent to a foster home approximately one hour away. After three weeks, \nwith no prior notice to their Guardian ad Litem, the brothers were moved over two hundred miles \naway to a youth shelter in Farmington, New Mexico, where they stayed for approximately three \n  20 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 21 of 99\nweeks. Due to CYFD’s failure to secure a placement closer to the boys’ mother and failure to \nprovide adequate transportation, they were unable to have any visits with their mother while they \nstayed in Farmington. CYFD then placed the boys with their paternal aunt near the first foster \nplacement. Because Brian J. did not receive adequate mental or behavioral health services and his \naunt did not receive adequate foster parent support, his aunt requested multiple times that Brian J. \nbe removed on an emergency basis. Due to CYFD’s delay in appropriately responding to this \nrequest and failure to identify any appropriate and safe alternative placement, CYFD separated \nBrian J. from his siblings and placed him with his mother in Valencia County, over the objection \nof his Guardian ad Litem that this placement would be detrimental to Brian J.’s safety and well-\nbeing. While Brian J. was placed with his mother, CYFD failed to provide Brian J. and his mother \nwith appropriate in-home supports and family counseling services to address both of their mental \nhealth needs. After about seven weeks with his mother, Brian J. was removed again and placed in \na runaway youth shelter in Albuquerque, where he stayed for ten weeks. CYFD did not identify an \nin-state therapeutic placement option for Brian J. He was accepted into residential treatment in \nUtah. With no appropriate in state therapeutic placement options, Brian J. was placed at home with \nhis mother again.  \n54.  As a result of the denial of appropriate medical, mental, and behavioral health \nservices and a stable placement while in CYFD custody, Brian J.’s behavior deteriorated. Brian J. \nexhibited positive behaviors at his first placement but, due to the denial of necessary services, he \nbegan to exhibit defiance, physical aggression, violent outbursts, and a lack of age-appropriate \nbehavioral controls. Brian J.’s behavioral changes resulted in multiple school suspensions. CYFD \nalso failed to ensure that Brian J., who has had an IEP for years, was provided special education \nsupport. For multiple months, CYFD made no attempt to determine his educational needs.  \n  21 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 22 of 99\n55.

He entered CYFD custody in May 2017 with his two brothers after a CYFD safety plan \nfailed to prevent them from being physically abused. His father has been incarcerated for the \nmajority of the past ten years as a result of multiple domestic violence convictions for abusing Elliot \nJ., his brothers, and their mother. Elliot J. enjoys going to school and his favorite subject is math.  \n57.  Elliot J. is enrolled in Medicaid. \n58.  Elliott J. has experienced multiple forms of trauma, including physical abuse by \nmultiple family members, exposure to domestic violence, living with a caregiver with untreated \nmental health challenges, and separation from a caregiver due to incarceration. \n59.  As a result of sustained and repeated exposure to trauma, Elliot J. sometimes exhibits \nbehavioral challenges, including outbursts, and he has tried to run away. Elliot J. has difficulty \nregulating  his  emotions,  concentrating,  staying  engaged,  expressing  himself  verbally,  and \nexhibiting age-appropriate behavioral controls. Elliot J. has also been diagnosed with attention-\ndeficit/hyperactivity  disorder,  an  intellectual  development  disorder,  language  disorder  with \nspeech/language  impairment,  unspecified  neurodevelopmental  disorder,  sibling  relational \nproblems, and parent-child relational problems. He takes prescribed medication for ADHD. \n60.  Despite his exposure to repeated and sustained trauma and his diagnoses, Elliot J. \nhas not received adequate medical, mental, and behavioral health services to which he is entitled \nthrough Medicaid while in CYFD custody. Elliot J. did not receive a comprehensive psychological \nevaluation until he had been in CYFD’s custody for eleven months. The only mental health support \nthat Elliot J. received during his entire first year in CYFD custody was a few weeks of therapy that \nElliot J.’s aunt secured without the assistance of CYFD. CYFD failed to follow up on Elliot J.’s \n  22 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 23 of 99\nneeded services and he was not re-enrolled in counseling for four months. The new therapy was \nalso secured by Elliot J.’s aunt without the assistance of CYFD.  \n61.  CYFD has cycled Elliot J. through four placements since he entered CYFD’s \ncustody in May 2017. Due to the absence of placements in Elliot J.’s hometown, he and his brothers \nwere first sent to a foster home approximately one hour away. Due to inadequate services, support, \nand supervision at this placement, Elliot J. experienced significant behavioral challenges and \nattempted to run away. After three weeks, with no prior notice to their Guardian ad Litem, the \nbrothers were moved over two hundred miles away to a youth shelter in Farmington, New Mexico, \nwhere they stayed for approximately three weeks. Due to CYFD’s failure to secure a placement \ncloser to the boys’ mother and failure to provide adequate transportation, they were unable to have \nany visits with their mother while they stayed in Farmington. CYFD then placed the boys with their \npaternal aunt near their first foster placement. Due to insufficient support by CYFD, the paternal \naunt chose to stop serving as a foster parent after ten and a half months as the brothers’ placement, \nand Elliot J. and his brother Michael J. were removed from her home and placed back with their \nmother.  \n62.  CYFD also failed to ensure that Elliot J., who has had an IEP for years, was provided \nspecial education support. For several months, CYFD made no attempt to determine his educational \nneeds. \n63.  Elliot J. brings this action through his Next Friend Feliz Rael. \n64.  Plaintiff Michael J. is a twelve-year-old Latino child from Bernalillo and Valencia \nCounties. He entered CYFD custody in May 2017 with his two brothers after a CYFD safety plan \nfailed to prevent them from being physically abused. His father has been incarcerated for the \nmajority of the past ten years as a result of multiple domestic violence convictions for abusing \n  23 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 24 of 99\nMichael J., his brothers, and their mother. Michael J. enjoys going to school and his favorite subject \nis math.  \n65.  Michael J. is enrolled in Medicaid. \n66.  Michael J. has experienced multiple forms of trauma, including physical abuse by \nmultiple family members, exposure to domestic violence, living with a caregiver with untreated \nmental health challenges, and separation from a caregiver due to incarceration. \n67.  As a result of sustained and repeated exposure to trauma, Michael J. struggles with \nself-confidence  and  task-avoidance.  He  also  avoids  disclosing  abuse  in  order  to  not  disrupt \nplacements. Michael J. has been diagnosed with adjustment disorder, sibling relational problems, \nparent-child relational problems, and specific learning disorders with impairments in written \nexpression and arithmetic. \n68.  Despite his diagnoses and exposure to repeated and sustained trauma, Michael J. has \nnot received adequate medical, mental, and behavioral health services to which he is entitled \nthrough  Medicaid  while  in  CYFD  custody.  Michael  J.  did  not  receive  a  comprehensive \npsychological evaluation until he had been in custody for eleven months. This evaluation noted an \nadequate prognosis for Michael J., if provided with “ample support and guidance.” CYFD has failed \nto provide this. The only mental health support that Michael J. received during his entire first year \nin CYFD custody was a few weeks of therapy that Michael J.’s aunt secured without the assistance \nof CYFD. CYFD failed to follow-up on Michael J.’s needed services, and he was not re-enrolled \nin counseling for four months. The new therapy was also secured by Michael J.’s aunt without the \nassistance of CYFD.  \n69.  CYFD has cycled Michael J. through four placements since he entered CYFD \ncustody in May 2017. Due to the absence of placements in Michael J.’s hometown, he and his \n  24 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 25 of 99\nbrothers were first sent to a foster home approximately one hour away. After three weeks, with no \nprior notice to their Guardian ad Litem, the brothers were moved over two hundred miles away to \na shelter in Farmington, New Mexico, where they stayed for approximately three weeks. Due to \nCYFD’s failure to secure a placement closer to the boys’ mother and failure to provide adequate \ntransportation,  they  were  unable  to  have  any  visits  with  their  mother  while  they  stayed  in \nFarmington. CYFD then placed the boys with their paternal aunt near the first foster placement. \nDue to insufficient support by CYFD, the paternal aunt chose to stop serving as a foster parent after \nten and a half months as the brothers’ placement, and Michael J. and his brother Elliot J. were \nremoved from her home and placed back with their mother.  \n70.  CYFD also failed to ensure that Michael J., who has had an IEP for years, was \nprovided special education support, and CYFD made no attempt to determine his educational needs \nfor several months. \n71.  Michael J. brings this action through his Next Friend Feliz Rael. \n72.  Plaintiff Olivia L. is a thirteen-year-old Hispanic child from Bernalillo County. She \nentered CYFD custody for the second time in 2016 due to sexual abuse by her mother’s partners \nand physical abuse and neglect by her mother. Olivia L. and her twin also were in CYFD custody \nin 2012. Her father is deceased. Olivia L. and her three siblings are all in CYFD custody.  \n73.  Olivia L. is enrolled in Medicaid. \n74.  Olivia L. has experienced multiple forms of trauma, including sexual and physical \nabuse, multiple rapes, neglect, death of a parent and separation from caregivers. \n75.  As a result of repeated and sustained trauma, Olivia L. experiences severe and \nchronic flashbacks and self-harming behaviors, including cutting. Olivia L. has difficulty sleeping \nand frequently wakes up in the middle of the night crying. She also has difficulty making decisions, \n  25 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 26 of 99\nconcentrating, regulating her emotions and behavior, interpreting cues from others, and making \nage-appropriate judgments. Olivia L. has been diagnosed with depression, post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, and reactive attachment disorder.  \n76.  Despite her exposure to repeated and sustained trauma and her diagnoses, Olivia L. \nhas not received adequate medical, mental, and behavioral health services to which she is entitled \nthrough Medicaid while in CYFD custody.  \n77.  Since Olivia L. reentered CYFD custody in August 2016, CYFD has cycled her \nthrough seven placements, including a treatment foster care placement, psychiatric hospital, relative \nplacement, multiple short-term shelters, and a residential treatment center. CYFD first placed \nOlivia L. in a treatment foster care placement from August 2016 to March 2017. CYFD removed \nOlivia L. when she was found cutting herself and using substances and sent her to a psychiatric \nhospital for acute care, where she stayed for several months. While living at the hospital, Olivia L. \nonly received one or two sessions of family therapy before she was discharged to her aunt. \nOlivia L.’s aunt repeatedly requested support services from CYFD but received none. After less \nthan one month, Olivia L.’s aunt requested that she be removed. Olivia L. was then cycled through \nmultiple short-term shelters, where she was raped by two adults. CYFD then placed Olivia L. in a \nresidential treatment center. Olivia L. was transferred to treatment foster care in April 2018 but \nrefused to enter the placement and instead stayed briefly with her biological mother. CYFD was \nnotified of Olivia L.’s location and eventually placed her in a shelter over 300 miles from \nAlbuquerque, where she stayed for over one month. CYFD then moved Olivia L. to another \nresidential treatment facility in Albuquerque in mid-June 2018.  \n78.  Olivia L. brings this action through her Next Friend Georgia Berrenberg. \n  26 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 27 of 99\n79.  Plaintiff Matty B. is a white eleven-year-old from Torrance County who entered \nCYFD custody with his two brothers in November 2016 due to neglect. Matty B. likes riding his \nbike, playing tag and Connect 4 with his brothers and friends, and flying his toy helicopter.  \n80.  Matty B. is enrolled in Medicaid. \n81.  Matty B. has experienced multiple forms of trauma, including neglect, sexual abuse, \nwitnessing domestic violence, witnessing the sexual abuse of his sister, living with caregivers with \nsubstance abuse and significant mental health challenges, and witnessing the death of his sister in \na fire that burned down their home in May 2016.  \n82.  As a result of sustained and repeated exposure to trauma, Matty B. has difficulty \nmanaging  anger,  regulating  his  emotions,  concentrating,  accepting  redirection  from  others, \ninterpreting cues and communications from others, exhibiting age-appropriate sexual behavior, and \nrecognizing  personal  boundaries.  Matty  B.  experiences  depressive  symptoms  and  is  easily \nfrustrated when he struggles with school lessons, peer interactions, and extracurricular activities. \nHe has difficulty focusing because, among other reasons, he frequently thinks about his unstable \nhome life and his parents’ substance use, and he worries about the safety of his younger brothers. \nMatty B. has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, unspecified disruptive behavior \ndisorder, sibling-relational problems, and parent-child relational problems.  \n83.  Despite his diagnosis and exposure to repeated and sustained trauma, Matty B. has \nnot received adequate medical, mental, and behavioral health services to which he is entitled \nthrough  Medicaid  while  in  CYFD  custody.  Matty  B.  did  not  receive  a  neuropsychological \nevaluation  until  he  had  been  in  CYFD  custody  for  nearly  eight  months.  This  evaluation \nmisdiagnosed  Matty  B.  with  unspecified  neurocognitive  disorder  and  borderline  intellectual \nfunctioning. Eight months later, Matty B.’s schools identified this as a misdiagnosis, determining \n  27 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 28 of 99\nthat Matty B. was in fact eligible for special education services due to emotional disturbance, not \nintellectual disability. The misdiagnosis of borderline intellectual functioning and unspecified \nneurocognitive disorder negatively affected Matty B.’s self-esteem, hopefulness for his future, and \neducational achievement.  \n84.  While in CYFD custody, Matty B. did not receive timely and adequate therapy to \naddress his grief over his sister’s death in the house fire, the sexual trauma he had experienced and \nhis related sexualized behaviors, the neglect he experienced while living with his parents, or his \nadditional behavioral challenges. Matty B. received no individual therapy until three months after \nhe came into CYFD custody. He received family counseling that was abruptly discontinued \nunilaterally by the foster parent without adequate therapeutic basis, any discharge planning, or \noversight by CYFD. As a result, Matty B.’s outbursts quickly returned and escalated, resulting in \nCYFD removing Matty B. and one of his brothers from the foster home on an emergency basis at \nthe request of the foster mother in August 2017. Matty B. and his family did not receive court-\nordered family therapy until December 2017, four months later. In April 2018, Matty B.’s therapist \nresigned from his treatment foster care agency, again suspending the children’s family therapy \nsessions for approximately six weeks. \n85.  CYFD has cycled Matty B. through five placements, including multiple foster \nhomes and treatment foster care homes. Placement changes have separated Matty B. from his \nsiblings and parents and also required changes in Matty B.’s school setting and service providers, \nrepeatedly disrupting his relationships with peers and mental health professionals. Matty B. was \nplaced with his two brothers in a home in Estancia due to a lack of available foster homes closer to \nMatty B.’s hometown. Because of CYFD’s failure to provide transportation assistance, Matty B. \nwas required to change schools and Matty B. and his brothers were unable to consistently visit with \n  28 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 29 of 99\ntheir parents during this time. At another point, Matty B. was again separated from his siblings and \nsent to an emergency foster care placement for twelve days. Matty B. was then sent to a treatment \nfoster care home in Albuquerque, nearly an hour away from his parents and again requiring a change \nin his school setting. Matty B.’s behavior has deteriorated as a result of CYFD’s failure to provide \nMatty B. with stability and as a result of the denial of appropriate medical, mental, and behavioral \nhealth services to which he is entitled.  \n86.  Despite Matty B.’s clear academic challenges, he was not assessed for special \neducation needs until August 2017, approximately ten months after he was initially taken into \nCYFD custody.  \n87.  Matty B. brings this action through his Next Friend Gabrielle Valdez.  \n88.  Plaintiff Justin B. is a white six-year-old from Torrance County who entered CYFD \ncustody with his two brothers in November 2016 due to neglect. \n89.   Justin B. is enrolled in Medicaid. \n90.  Justin B. has experienced multiple forms of trauma, including neglect, witnessing \nthe death of his sister in a fire that burned down his home, witnessing his parents abuse marijuana \nand crystal methamphetamine, witnessing domestic violence between his parents, and living with \ncaregivers with severe mental health challenges. \n91.  As a result of sustained and repeated exposure to trauma, Justin B. has difficulty \nconcentrating, expressing his emotions, accepting redirection, and recognizing personal boundaries. \nJustin B. has a history of self-harming, acting impulsively, and experiencing anxiety. Justin B. has \nreported experiences of auditory and visual hallucinations of his deceased sister and previously \nclaimed that she was controlling his behaviors. Justin B. blamed himself for the fire that killed his \nolder sister, even though he was only three years old when the fire occurred. He becomes frustrated \n  29 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 30 of 99\neasily when he struggles with school lessons, peer interactions, and extracurricular activities, and \nhe has difficulty understanding the progress his parents have made in their treatment plans and \ntrusting them to provide him safety. He has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, \ndisinhibited social engagement disorder, developmental delay, parent-child relational problems, \nand sibling relational problems. Justin B. has been prescribed medication since November 2017 for \nnightmares, anxiety, and self-harming behaviors. \n92.  Despite Justin B.’s exposure to repeated and sustained trauma and his diagnoses, he \nhas not received adequate mental and behavioral health services to which he is entitled through \nMedicaid while in CYFD custody. Justin B. did not receive a neuropsychological evaluation until \nhe had been in CYFD custody for nearly one year. While in CYFD custody, Justin B. did not receive \ntimely and adequate therapy to address his grief and guilt over his sister’s death in the house fire, \nongoing sexualized behaviors, the neglect he experienced while living with his parents, or his \noverall behavioral challenges. He briefly received family counseling that was abruptly discontinued \nunilaterally  by  the  foster  parents  without  adequate  therapeutic  basis,  discharge  planning,  or \noversight by CYFD. As a result, Justin B.’s behavioral challenges quickly returned and escalated, \nresulting in CYFD removing Justin B. and one of his brothers from the foster home on an emergency \nbasis at the request of the foster mother in August 2017. Justin B. and his family did not receive \ncourt-ordered family therapy until December 2017, four months later, and a month after the Court-\nordered deadline to begin the service.  \n93.  CYFD has cycled Justin B. through three placements, including regular foster care, \nan emergency shelter, and treatment foster care. Justin B. was placed with his two brothers in a \nhome in Estancia due to a lack of available foster homes closer to Justin B.’s hometown. Due to \nCYFD’s failure to provide transportation assistance, Justin B. and his brothers were unable to \n  30 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 31 of 99\nconsistently visit with their parents during this time. As a result of the denial of appropriate medical, \nmental, and behavioral health services to which he is entitled through Medicaid, and the denial of \na stable placement while in CYFD custody, Justin B.’s behavior deteriorated. Justin B. was \nseparated from his siblings and sent to an emergency foster care placement for twelve days. CYFD \nthen sent Justin B. to a treatment foster care home in Albuquerque, which is nearly an hour away \nfrom his parents, and which required a change in school.  \n94.  Justin B. brings this action through his Next Friend Gabrielle Valdez. \n95.  Plaintiff Jackson B. is a white two-year-old from Torrance County who entered \nCYFD custody, along with his two older brothers, in November 2016 after he tested positive for \nmethamphetamine and marijuana at birth. \n96.  Jackson B. is enrolled in Medicaid. \n97.  Jackson B. has experienced multiple forms of trauma, including neglect and being \nborn addicted to crystal methamphetamine.  \n98.  Even though Jackson B. was born addicted to methamphetamine and his exposure \nto drugs was the reason he was brought into custody, Jackson B. has not received adequate medical, \nmental, and behavioral health services to which he is entitled through Medicaid while in CYFD \ncustody. Nor has he received appropriate medical services to diagnose, treat, and monitor his health \nissues, including severe asthma and respiratory issues.  \n99.  Despite his young age, Jackson B. has already been cycled through three placements. \nJackson B. was initially placed at a foster home with his two older brothers, Matty B. and Justin B. \nDue to the failure to secure mental and behavioral health services for his brothers they were \nremoved from the foster home and Jackson B. was separated from his siblings in August 2017. Due \nto CYFD’s failure to provide transportation assistance, Jackson B. did not have consistent family \n  31 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 32 of 99\nvisitation with his parents or brothers. In October 2017, Jackson B. was transferred to a new foster \nplacement. CYFD failed to provide proper support, training, and information to the new foster \nfamily, who, as a result, hindered reunification efforts. Seven months later, on April 25, 2018, \nJackson B. was removed from this placement on an emergency basis and sent back to his first foster \nmother in Estancia. \n100.  Jackson B. brings this action through his Next Friend Gabrielle Valdez. \n101.  Plaintiff Lucas M. is a white five-year-old from Bernalillo County. Lucas M. and \nhis brother Julian M. entered CYFD custody in April 2018 due to neglect and domestic violence. \nHis father abuses alcohol and his mother recently began abusing methamphetamines. Lucas M. \nlikes to do gymnastics every week with his brother, Julian M., and play with dogs.  \n102.  Lucas M. is enrolled in Medicaid.  \n103.  Lucas M. has experienced multiple forms of trauma, including witnessing his father \nkick and beat his mother and being neglected and separated from a caregiver.  \n104.  As a result of repeated and sustained trauma, Lucas M. sometimes experiences \nbehavioral challenges, including having difficulty planning, focusing, and regulating his emotions, \nespecially after he sees his mother. When Lucas M. sees his mother and father, he manifests \nregressive behavior by, for example, insisting that his parents feed him. When Lucas M. entered \nCYFD custody, he insisted on sleeping in the same bed as his nine-year-old brother.  Only recently \ndid his foster placement transition him into a bunk bed with his brother.  Plaintiff Lucas M. also \nhas a severe speech impediment. \n105.  Despite his  exposure to repeated and sustained trauma and his severe speech \nimpediment, Lucas M. has not received adequate medical, mental, and behavioral health services \nto which he is entitled through Medicaid while in CYFD custody. Lucas M. has still not received \n  32 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 33 of 99\nan EPSDT screening or a neuropsychological evaluation after being in CYFD custody for over three \nmonths. Before Lucas M. entered CYFD custody, he was receiving speech therapy during the \nschool year through his preschool. Even though Lucas M. has a severe speech impediment and his \nmother notified CYFD of the impediment the day he was taken into custody, Lucas M. did not \nreceive a referral to a speech therapist when the school year ended until his Guardian ad Litem \nadvocated for one. Lucas M. did not have an intake appointment with a psychotherapist until he \nhad been in custody for over two months. He has received only one session of therapy, which was \na session of talk therapy with his brother and his foster mother in which neither Lucas M. nor his \nbrother felt comfortable speaking.  At the request of his foster parent and Guardian ad Litem, Lucas \nM. recently had two play therapy sessions.  CYFD did not schedule the intake; the foster parent \nsought out play therapy on her own.  \n106.  CYFD has cycled Lucas M. through three placements since he entered custody. \nCYFD first placed Lucas M. and his brother in a non-relative foster placement for almost five weeks \nuntil it found a relative foster placement. CYFD placed Lucas M. and his brother with their aunt, \nthe relative foster placement, for only two weeks. The aunt was not provided with any supports \nfrom CYFD and eventually felt she could not handle fostering Julian M. and Lucas M. in addition \nto supporting her son with special needs who lived with her. CYFD then placed Julian M. and \nLucas M. with a fictive kin.  \n107.  Lucas M. brings this action through his Next Friend Mariel Willow. \n108.

Julian M. is enrolled in Medicaid.  \n110.  Julian M. has experienced multiple forms of trauma, including witnessing his father \nkick and beat his mother and being neglected and separated from a caregiver.  \n111.  As a result of repeated and sustained trauma, Julian M. sometimes experiences \nbehavioral  challenges,  including  outbursts.  Julian  M.  has  difficulty  regulating  his  emotions, \nplanning and making decisions. Julian M. has extreme difficulty trusting others, especially adults. \nHe is very protective of his mother and younger brother, Lucas M. \n112.  Despite his exposure to repeated and sustained trauma, Julian M. has not received \nadequate medical, mental, and behavioral health services to which he is entitled through Medicaid \nwhile  in  CYFD  custody.  Julian  M.  has  still  not  received  an  EPSDT  screening  or  a \nneuropsychological evaluation after being in CYFD custody for over three months. Julian M. did \nnot have an intake appointment with a therapist until he had been in custody for over two months. \nHe has only had one session with the therapist, a session of talk therapy with the foster mom and \nLucas M. in which the boys barely spoke. At the request of his foster parent and Guardian ad Litem, \nJulian M. recently had two play therapy sessions.

David G.’s  mother  is  currently  incarcerated  and  his  father  is  currently \nhomeless. David G. entered  CYFD  custody  when,  following  his  mother’s  incarceration,  his \ngrandmother asked that he be removed from her care and placed in CYFD custody. \n116.  David G. is enrolled in Medicaid. \n117.  David G. has experienced multiple forms of trauma, including physical, sexual, and \nemotional abuse, neglect, losing a sibling to suicide, the incarceration of a parent, the incarceration \nof  a  sibling,  chronic  homelessness,  and  separation  from  a  caregiver. David G. witnessed  his \nmother’s involvement in the sex trade and was included in the background of her advertisements \nfor sexual services and homemade pornographic movies. David G. and his siblings were routinely \nlocked for long periods of time in the bathroom while his mother sold drugs or entertained clients \nin their home. One of David G.’s older brothers committed suicide by hanging himself from a tree \nin the family’s front yard. Another of his brothers is currently incarcerated. David G. is currently \nseparated from his younger brother, who is staying with the children’s grandmother. \n118.  As a result of sustained and repeated exposure to trauma, David G. experiences \nbehavioral challenges, including outbursts, impulsivity, and irritability. David G. has difficulty \nplanning,  making  decisions,  focusing,  regulating  emotions,  interpreting  communication  and \ncues from others, and maintaining mutual conversations or social interactions. He lacks age-\nappropriate behavioral controls and age-appropriate judgment. David G. cannot sleep without \nmedication and often cannot manage hygiene when his behaviors are not properly addressed. He \nperseverates in thinking about his older brother’s suicide and his inability to care for his younger \nbrother now that they are separated. Sometimes, David G. worries so much about his younger \n  35 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 36 of 99\nbrother’s safety and well-being that he fears that, like his older brother, he may have committed \nsuicide. David G. also ruminates on his inability to have prevented his mother’s involvement in the \ndrug and sex trades. David G. often feels overwhelmingly abandoned, alone, and misunderstood. \nHe sometimes self-harms by vigorously rubbing his knuckles against his jeans until his knuckles \nare raw. David G. also has a tendency to feel isolated and when there is no one with whom he can \nspeak, his feelings of abandonment and emotional dysregulation increase. \n119.  Despite diagnoses and exposure to repeated and sustained trauma, David G. has not \nreceived adequate medical, mental, and behavioral health services which he is entitled to through \nMedicaid while in CYFD custody. David G. did not receive an appropriate psychological exam \nor Medicaid care coordinator until he had been in custody for nearly two years. Although there are \nmental health providers in his area, none have been made available to him, and the next closest \nprovider, to which CYFD failed to send him, is a two-hour drive away. Under CYFD custody and \nHSD’s supervision of Medicaid, David G.’s Medicaid managed care organization, Blue Cross Blue \nShield, did not assign him a Medicaid care coordinator until 2018, after David G. had been in \nCYFD custody for almost two years.  \n120.  David G. also  has  not  received the adequate  mental  or  behavioral  therapy  or \nmedication  management to  which  he  is  entitled through  Medicaid while  in  CYFD  custody. \nHe received no therapy at all during his first three placements. In subsequent treatment foster care \nplacements, David G. received inadequate therapy, was repeatedly mis-medicated, and has suffered \nsevere adverse responses to the medication he has been prescribed. In a treatment foster care \nplacement, David G. was administered an anti-depressant which caused him symptoms suggesting \na diagnosis of bipolar disorder, including anger, irritability, and outbursts, as well as feelings and \nexpressions of hopelessness, being unloved, and being abandoned. David G. was not provided a \n  36 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 37 of 99\ncomprehensive  psychological  examination  and  the  medication  was  not  discontinued.  As  a \nresult, David G. had an outburst and was sent to the emergency room overnight, where he received \nno therapy or acute services. The next day, David G. was placed in an acute care unit at the \nUniversity of New Mexico, where he was taken off the medication and his behavior rapidly \nimproved and stabilized. David G. was then sent back to the same treatment foster care, where he \nwas assigned to an even less-experienced therapist and put back on the same anti-depressant that \nhad caused the previously observed adverse symptoms. Within hours of being administered the \nmedication, David G. had an outburst and was taken by police back to the emergency room.  \n121.  CYFD has cycled David G. through at least nine placements in his less than two \nyears in CYFD custody, including at least three regular foster placements, at least three treatment \nfoster care placements, multiple emergency rooms, and a residential treatment center. Due to the \nlack  of  a  stable  placement  and  appropriate  medical,  mental,  and  behavioral  health \nservices David G. has received while in CYFD custody, his health and behavior have notably \ndeteriorated, resulting in increasingly restrictive placements. David G. was initially placed with \nfoster parents and received no mental health support. He was then sent to treatment foster care \nplacements where he was mis-medicated and twice transferred to the emergency room. On the \nsecond occasion, David G. remained in the emergency room for almost a week because no shelter, \ntreatment foster care, or residential treatment placements were available. David G. was then placed \nin a foster home, the only placement available, which was already over capacity and lacked the \nability to meet David G.’s mental health and behavioral needs. David G. stayed in this placement \nfor less than a week, was transferred to another emergency placement for only a few days, and then \nwas transferred to a residential treatment facility, which was the only available placement in the \nstates of New Mexico, Texas, and Arizona. In this placement, David G. has been and continues to \n  37 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 38 of 99\nbe repeatedly restrained by the staff of the residential treatment center; he was restrained thirteen \nof his first fourteen days in the placement. Despite knowledge of these incidents, CYFD has not \nchanged David G.’s placement.  \n122.  By  cycling David G. through  numerous  facilities  and  failing  to  provide  any \ndischarge  planning  or  involve  his Medicaid managed  care  coordinator,  CYFD and  HSD have \nprevented David G. from receiving consistent care or forming a stable relationship with a therapist, \ndoctor, or foster parent. In addition, due to the deterioration of David G.’s health and behaviors \nwhile in CYFD custody, CYFD did not find a school or educational program placement for David. \n123.  David G. brings this action through his Next Friend Heidi Todacheene. \n124.  Plaintiff Disability Rights New Mexico (“DRNM”) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit New \nMexico corporation, designated as New Mexico’s protection and advocacy organization (“P&A”), \nwhose mission is to protect, promote, and expand the rights of persons with disabilities. DRNM is \npart of a nationwide network of disability rights agencies established by Congress in 1975 and has \nprovided advocacy services to New Mexicans with disabilities since 1979. The Developmental \nDisabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act, the original legislation establishing the P&A systems, \nauthorizes P&As to “pursue legal, administrative, and other appropriate remedies or approaches to \nensure the protection of, and advocacy for, the rights of such individuals within the state who are \nor who may be eligible for treatment, services, or habilitation.”9 \n                                                 \n9 42 U.S.C. § 15043(a)(2)(A)(i) (2004). Several other pieces of enabling legislation authorize \nsimilar activities. See, e.g., Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act, 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 10801–10827 (1986) (charging P&As with the duty to protect and advocate for the rights \nof people with mental illness); Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Traumatic Brain \nInjury (“PATBI”), 42 U.S.C. § 300d-53 (2014) (advocating for individuals with traumatic brain \ninjury (TBI) and their families), Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights Act (“PAIR”), 29 \n \n  38 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 39 of 99\n125.  DRNM’s constituency includes children and adults with mental illness, intellectual \nand developmental disabilities, traumatic brain injuries, and other disabilities. Particular to this \ncase, the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act of 1986 (“PAIMI”)10 \ncharges P&As in each state with the duty to protect and advocate for the rights of people with \nmental illness. When enacting the law, Congress specifically found that “individuals with mental \nillness are subject to neglect, including lack of treatment . . . health care and discharge planning.” \n42 U.S.C. § 10801(a)(3). Congress further found that state systems for monitoring the rights of \nindividuals with mental illness are varied and often inadequate. Id. at (a)(4). \n126.  Recognizing  the  vulnerability  of  individuals  with  mental  illness,  Congress \nauthorized DRNM to “protect and advocate the rights of such individuals through activities to \nensure the enforcement of the constitution and federal and state statutes.”11 Children involved in \nthe child welfare system by definition have experienced trauma leading to behavioral and mental \nhealth diagnoses. These children have a right to appropriate and timely screening and treatment for \nbehavioral and mental health disorders as well as physical health care needs. Children with mental \nimpairments are entitled to an avenue to secure these vital health care services.  \n127.  DRNM has the authority to pursue strategies to secure medically necessary mental \nand physical health care for children in custody with behavioral health diagnoses. DRNM provides \nindividual advocacy services to children whose foster parents or guardians ad litem have had \ndifficulty getting appropriate health care, most particularly behavioral health care. DRNM also \n                                                 \nU.S.C. § 794e (2014) (advocating for individuals with disabilities who are not eligible for other \nprotection and advocacy programs). \n10 42 U.S.C. §§ 10801–10827 (1986). \n11 42 U.S.C. § 10801(b)(2)(A) (1991). \n  39 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 40 of 99\nprovides support and technical assistance to attorneys serving children and youth in the child \nwelfare system. \n128.  Plaintiff Native American Disability Law Center (“NADLC”) is a 501(c)(3) \nnonprofit organization based in Farmington, New Mexico. NADLC advocates for the legal rights \nof  Native  Americans  with  disabilities.  Like  DRNM,  NADLC  is  a  protection  and  advocacy \norganization authorized by relevant federal statutes to initiate legal action designed to protect the \nrights of persons with disabilities, including children in the foster care system. See 42 U.S.C. \n§§ 15041 et seq., 10801 et seq. NADLC’s mission is to advocate so that the rights of Native \nAmericans with disabilities in the Four Corners area are enforced, strengthened, and brought in \nharmony with their communities. NADLC represents Native American children with disabilities in \nthe child welfare system as Guardians ad Litem and Youth Attorneys. \n129.  NADLC is required to expend significantly more resources to represent children in \nthe child welfare system when CYFD and HSD fail to appropriately place children, subject children \nto repeated changes of placements, and fail to provide caregivers and children with necessary \nMedicaid services. The allocation of resources necessary due to these failures diverts NADLC from \nproviding other essential legal services to Native Americans with disabilities. \nB.  Defendants \n130.  Defendants  include  state  officials  from  the  two  state  agencies  responsible  for \nadministering and supervising the child welfare system and Medicaid services to eligible children. \nCYFD is responsible for “administering and supervising” New Mexico’s child welfare services. \n§ 8.8.2.8(A) NMAC. HSD has the authority to “establish, administer and supervise child welfare \nactivities and social services to children,” NMSA 1978, § 9-8-13(A)(1), and is the single state \n  40 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 41 of 99\nagency designated to administer New Mexico’s Medicaid program. 8.291.400.9 NMAC, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396a(a)(5).12  \n131.  Defendant  Monique  Jacobson  is  the  Cabinet  Secretary  of  the  New  Mexico \nChildren, Youth, and Families Department. As such, she is responsible for administering child \nwelfare services in New Mexico, including ensuring CYFD meets it obligations to license and \nmonitor appropriate placements for children in the child welfare system; provide for the care, \nprotection and wholesome mental and physical development of children in state custody; and ensure \na coordinated and integrated system of care and services for children, youth, and families. The \nCYFD Secretary retains “final decision-making authority and responsibility for the administration \nof any such laws as provided in Subsection B of Section 7 of the Children, Youth and Families \nDepartment Act.” NMSA 1978, § 9-2A-9. \n132.  Defendant  Brent  Earnest  is  Secretary  of  the  New  Mexico  Human  Services \nDepartment. As such, “[i]t is his duty to manage all operations of the department,” “enforce the \nlaws with which he or the department is charged,” and exercise “general supervisory and appointing \nauthority over all department employees.” NMSA 1978, §§ 9-8-6(A), 9-8-6(B)(1). The Social \nServices Division of HSD establishes, administers and supervises child welfare activities. Id. §§ 9-\n8-6(A), 9-8-13(A). The Medical Assistance Division of HSD administers New Mexico’s Medicaid \nprogram. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(5); 42 C.F.R. § 431.10 (2013); NMSA 1978, §§ 9-8-12, 27-2-16. \nEarnest is also Secretary Co-chair of the Behavioral Health Collaborative. The collaborative is \nresponsible  for  (1)  “[c]omprehensive  planning  and  meeting  state  and  federal  requirements”; \n                                                 \n12 All references herein to CYFD reference Defendant Jacobson her official capacity at CYFD, not \nagainst CYFD as an entity, and all references to HSD reference Defendant Earnest in his official \ncapacity at HSD, not against HSD as an entity. \n  41 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 42 of 99\n(2) “[c]reating a single behavioral health care and services delivery system that promotes mental \nhealth, emphasizes prevention, early intervention, resiliency, recovery and rehabilitation”; and \n(3) “[m]onitoring  service  capacities  and  utilization  in  order  to  achieve  desired  performance \nmeasures and outcomes.”13 \n133.  At all times hereto, Defendants were acting under color of state law. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n134.  The Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 \nbecause it arises under the laws of the United States. This Court has personal jurisdiction over \nDefendants because the individual defendants are domiciled in this district and because Defendants’ \nacts and omissions took place within this district. \n135.  Venue is proper in this federal district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), (c). \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n136.  Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief applicable to members of the Plaintiff Class and Sub-\nclass as defined below. The requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(2), are \nmet with respect to the classes defined below. \n137.  The plaintiff class (“Plaintiff Class”) is defined as a statewide class of children and \nyoung people who are in the legal custody of the Children, Youth and Families Department and \nwho have experienced or are at significant risk of experiencing complex trauma that substantially \nlimits major life activities. The class includes, but is not limited to, children with trauma-related \nconditions recognized by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition \n                                                 \n13 NMSA 1978, § 9-7-6.4; New Mexico Human Services Department, Medical Assistance Division, \nhttp://www.hsd.state.nm.us/behavioral-health-collaborative.aspx (last visited July 18, 2018).  \n  42 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 43 of 99\n(DSM-5), including post-traumatic stress, anxiety, dissociative, conduct, depressive, and substance-\nrelated and addictive disorders.  \n138.  A sub-class of individuals (“Sub-Class”) is defined as individuals in the above-\nnamed Plaintiff Class who also qualify for protections under the Indian Child Welfare Act. \n139.  There exist questions of law and/or fact common to the Plaintiff Class and Sub-Class \n(collectively, the “Classes”) that predominate over any individual question. Common questions of \nfact and law include, without limitation: \n•  Whether Defendants have a system in place that provides children impacted by \ntrauma in state custody with placements and services that are the most appropriate and least \nrestrictive, as required by law; \n•  Whether Defendants have a system in place that adequately and timely screens \nchildren in their custody for medical, mental health, and behavioral needs, as required by law;  \n•  Whether Defendants have a system in place that ensures provision and coordination \nof medical, mental health, and behavioral health services, as required by law; \n•  Whether  any  of  Defendants’  alleged  policies  or  practices  violate  plaintiffs’ \nsubstantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, the \nRehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Medicaid Act, and/or the Indian Child \nWelfare Act. \n140.  The Classes are so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. According \nto the most recent available data, the total number of children who had spent time in foster care in \nfiscal year 2017 in New Mexico was 4,737.14 \n                                                 \n14 CYFD, FY 2018 Annual Report and Strategic Plan 13 (2018), https://cyfd.org/docs/ \nfy18_annual_report_v2-3.pdf.  \n  43 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 44 of 99\n141.  The dispersed and changing geographic location of members of the Classes also \nmakes joinder impracticable. Due to CYFD’s placement practices, members of the Classes are \nplaced in multiple states and are frequently forced to change placements.  \n142.  The claims of all the named individual Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of members \nof the Classes. The claims of Diana D. are typical of the claims of claims of members of the Sub-\nclass. Each Plaintiff is a member of the class he or she seeks to represent. Plaintiffs and members \nof the Classes have all experienced complex trauma that substantially limits major life activities, \nsuch  as  eating,  sleeping,  concentrating,  thinking,  communicating,  learning,  emotional  self-\nregulation,  setting  goals,  and  long-term  planning,  and  major  bodily  functions  of  the  brain, \nneurological, and endocrine systems. As a result of Defendants’ acts, omissions, policies, and \npractices that apply to Plaintiffs and the Classes, Plaintiffs and members of the Classes are denied \nmeaningful access to the benefits of New Mexico’s child welfare system. \n143.  Plaintiffs and their Next Friends will fairly and adequately protect the interests of \nthe Classes. The Plaintiffs are represented by experienced counsel who will adequately represent \nthe interests of the Classes.  \n144.  Defendants have acted and refused to act and continue to do so on grounds generally \napplicable to the Classes that Plaintiffs represent, thereby rendering appropriate injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief for the Classes as a whole.  \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nI.  CYFD AND HSD ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR NEW MEXICO’S SYSTEM OF \nCHILD WELFARE AND DELIVERY OF MEDICAL, MENTAL HEALTH, \nAND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. \nA.  CYFD’s Duty to Administer New Mexico’s Child Welfare System \n  44 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 45 of 99\n145.  New  Mexico  has  established  a  system  of  child  welfare  to  prevent  the  abuse, \nabandonment, or neglect of children and to ensure that youth in state custody have safe and \npermanent homes and that their well-being is promoted. This system reflects the parens patriae \nprinciple that state government has a paramount interest in ensuring the protection of children.  \n146.  CYFD is the child welfare agency responsible for child protective services in New \nMexico, and its duties are laid out in detail in Articles 1 and 4 of the New Mexico’s Children’s \nCode. Among other obligations, state law identifies CYFD as the state agency responsible for \nexecuting the following duties to protect the safety and welfare of New Mexico’s children: \n•  receiving and investigating reports of child abuse and neglect, NMSA 1978, §§ 32A-\n4-3, -4, and initiating court proceedings to remove children from their homes when necessary to \nensure a child’s safety, see 10 N.M. Reg. 311; \n•  serving as the legal custodian for children who are removed from their homes, \nNMSA 1978, §§ 32A-4-7, -16, -18, -22, -25;  \n•  placing children in CYFD custody in appropriate, “community-based” licensed \nfoster homes, approved adoptive homes, certified treatment facilities, shelters, or with relatives, id. \n§§ 32A-1-4(P), 32A-4-8; \n•  licensing foster homes, certifying treatment facilities and shelters and approving \nadoptive homes, id. §§ 40-7A-1, et seq.; \n•  establishing and making reasonable efforts to implement permanency plans for \nchildren in custody, id. §§ 32A-4-22(J), -25.1;  \n•  “enact[ing] regulations to control disposition and placement of children under the \nChildren’s Code, including regulations to limit or prohibit the out-of-state placement of children, \n  45 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 46 of 99\nincluding those who have developmental disabilities or emotional, neurobiological or behavioral \ndisorders, when in-state alternatives are available,” id. § 9-2A-8(F); \n•  “assum[ing] and implement[ing] responsibility for children’s mental health and \nsubstance abuse services in the state, coordinating with the human services department and the \ndepartment of health,” id. § 9-2A-8(H); \n•  developing and facilitating treatment plans for children in custody, id. §§ 32A-4-21, \n-22, -25; \n•  developing standards of service within the department that focus on prevention, \nearly intervention, monitoring and outcomes; id. §§ 9-2A-8(D), -8(J); and \n•  “develop[ing] and maintain[ing] a statewide database, including client tracking of \nservices for children, youth and families,” id. § 9-2A-8(C). \n147.  Federal law likewise imposes duties on CYFD to ensure the safety, permanence, and \nwell-being of children in state custody. New Mexico receives federal funding under Title IV-E of \nthe Social Security Act for partial reimbursement of the cost of providing foster care, adoption \nassistance, and kinship guardianship assistance to children who meet federal eligibility criteria. As \na condition of receiving this funding, New Mexico must develop and adhere to a plan that satisfies \na number of requirements, including: \n•  placing each child in foster care in a foster placement that conforms to nationally \nrecommended professional standards, 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(10);  \n•  providing each child in foster care with quality services to protect his or her safety \nand health, id. § 671(a)(22); \n•  providing a written case plan for each child that includes (i) a plan to provide safe, \nappropriate, and stable foster care placements and implementation of that plan, id. §§ 671(a)(16), \n  46 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 47 of 99\n675(1)(A); (ii) where reunification is not possible or appropriate, a written case plan that ensures \nthe location of an appropriate adoptive or other permanent home for the child and implementation \nof that plan, id. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(E); (iii) a plan to ensure the educational stability of the child \nwhile in foster care and implementation of that plan, id. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(G); and \n•  maintaining a case review system in which the status of each child in foster care is \nreviewed every six months for purposes of determining the safety of the child, the continuing \nnecessity  and  appropriateness  of  the  foster  placement,  the  extent  of  compliance  with  the \npermanency plan, and the projected date of permanency, id. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(5)(B), 675(5)(C). \n148.  The Indian Child Welfare Act sets forth steps to be taken to meet the distinct needs \nof children covered by ICWA who are in the child welfare system. Children in state custody who \nare covered by ICWA are to be placed in the least restrictive setting that most approximates a family \nand in which the child’s special needs, if any, may be met and “within reasonable proximity to his \nor her home, taking into account any special needs of the child.” 25 U.S.C. § 1915(b). It further \nrequires preference in foster placements to be given to “(i) a member of the Indian child’s extended \nfamily; (ii) a foster home licensed, approved, or specified by the Indian child’s tribe; (iii) an Indian \nfoster home licensed or approved by an authorized non-Indian licensing authority; or (iv) an \ninstitution for children approved by an Indian tribe or operated by an Indian organization which has \na program suitable to meet the Indian child’s needs.” Id. ICWA also requires preference in adoptive \nplacements to be given to “(1) a member of the child’s extended family; (2) other members of the \nIndian child’s tribe; or (3) other Indian families.” Id. § 1915(a). CYFD must maintain a record of \neach placement of children covered by ICWA and show evidence of efforts to comply with the \norder of preferences. Id. § 1915(e). CYFD must also make active efforts to provide remedial \n  47 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 48 of 99\nservices and rehabilitation programs designed to prevent the breakup of Indian families. 25 U.S.C. \n§ 1912(d). \nB.  HSD’s Medicaid Obligations to Provide a System of Medical, Mental \nHealth, and Behavioral Health Screening and Services  \n \n149.  Medicaid is a federal program enacted in 1965 as part of the Social Security Act. \nAlthough a state’s participation in the Medicaid program is voluntary, New Mexico has elected to \nparticipate and has designated HSD as the state agency responsible for administering the program. \nNMSA  1978,  § 9-8-12;  42  U.S.C.  § 1396(a)(5);  42  C.F.R.  § 431.10.  Once  a  state  elects  to \nparticipate in the Medicaid program, it must follow program requirements mandated by the federal \ngovernment. State participants must administer Medicaid in “the best interests of recipients,” 42 \nU.S.C. § 1396a(a)(19), provide services with reasonable promptness, id. § 1396a(a)(8), and ensure \nthere is an adequate provider network to deliver those services, id. § 1396u-2(b)(5), 42 C.F.R. \n§ 438.68, 8.308.2.9 NMAC.  \n150.  The child health component of Medicaid, Early Periodic Screening Diagnosis and \nTreatment (“EPSDT”), was enacted in 1967. The goal of EPSDT was to focus on prevention and \nearly intervention in order to reduce health problems among poor children and offer them equal \nopportunities for access to health care and healthy lives. All state Medicaid plans are required to \nprovide for “[s]uch other necessary health care, diagnostic services, treatment, and other measures \n. . . to correct or ameliorate defects and physical and mental illnesses and conditions discovered by \nthe screening services.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(r)(5). \n151.  As a participant in the Medicaid program, New Mexico must provide all Medicaid-\neligible persons in the state under the age of 21 with periodic EPSDT screenings that include “a \ncomprehensive health and developmental history (including assessment of both physical and mental \n  48 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 49 of 99\nhealth development),” a comprehensive physical exam, appropriate immunizations, lab tests and \nhealth education, 42 U.S.C.§ 1396d(r)(1)(B), as well as assessment of the child’s vision, dental and \nhearing needs, id. § 1396d(r)(2)-(4); see also 8.308.9.19 NMAC. New Mexico must further provide \nand arrange for the treatment services necessary to correct or ameliorate a psychiatric, behavioral, \nor emotional condition of a Medicaid-eligible child or youth under the age of 21. 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396d(a). Among the intensive home and community-based services that the state is obligated to \nprovide are: home health care services, id. § 1396d(a)(7), rehabilitative services, id. § 1396d(a)(13), \ncase  management  services,  id.  §§ 1396d(a)(19),  1396n(g);  and  personal  care  services,  id. \n§ 1396d(a)(24); see 8.308.9.19 NMAC, 8.321.2.11(B)(4(c) NMAC, 8.321.2.16(B)(3)(c) NMAC. \nEPSDT services include all behavioral and mental health Medicaid-covered services that are \nmedically necessary for children.15  \n152.  EPSDT treatment services must be timely, individualized, and consistent with \naccepted medical standards. Services must be initiated within six months from the date of request. \n42 C.F.R. § 441.56(e). \n153.  In order to provide these required services, “[t]he [Medicaid] agency must make \navailable a variety of individual and group providers qualified and willing to provide EPSDT \nservices.” 42 C.F.R. § 441.61(b). While states may adopt managed care, contract with entities to \n                                                 \n15 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(r)(5).  Consistent with federal Medicaid law, the New Mexico Children’s \nCode defines medically necessary services as: “clinical and rehabilitative physical, mental or \nbehavioral health services that are: (1) essential to prevent, diagnose or treat medical conditions or \nare essential to enable the child to attain, maintain or regain functional capacity; (2) delivered in \nthe amount, duration, scope and setting that is clinically appropriate to the specific physical, mental \nand behavioral health care needs of the child; (3) provided within professionally accepted standards \nof practice and national guidelines; and (4) required to meet the physical, mental and behavioral \nhealth needs of the child and are not primarily for the convenience of the child, provider or payer[.]” \nSee NMSA 1978, § 32A-6A-4(T).  \n  49 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 50 of 99\noversee the delivery of services and arrange services through provider networks, states retain \nresponsibility for ensuring compliance with all relevant Medicaid requirements, including the \nmandates of the EPSDT program. 42 U.S.C. § 1396u-2.  \nII.  NEW MEXICO FOSTER CHILDREN ARE IMPACTED BY COMPLEX \nTRAUMA. \nA.  New Mexico Foster Children’s Exposure to Trauma \n154.  New Mexico foster children have experienced and continue to experience traumatic \nevents  that  profoundly  affect  their  psychological,  emotional,  and  physical  well-being.  At  a \nminimum,  children  in  New  Mexico’s  foster  system  have  experienced  childhood  abuse, \nabandonment, or neglect. In particular, they may experience physical, emotional, or sexual abuse; \nemotional or physical neglect; homelessness; the death, incarceration, or deportation of a parent; \ndomestic violence; parental substance abuse, mental illness, or involvement in sex work. For \nchildren in the child welfare system, research confirms that the experience of abuse, abandonment, \nneglect, and instability is often compounded by unfair treatment due to their race or ethnicity, sexual \norientation or gender identity, as well as extreme poverty and other socioeconomic hardship. \n155.  In addition to experiencing abuse, abandonment, and neglect at home, New Mexico \nfoster children have also, by definition, experienced separation from a caregiver upon entering \nCYFD custody. Separation from a caregiver, even an abusive or neglectful caregiver, is traumatic \nfor a child.16 A child may experience separation from an abusive or neglectful caregiver as more \ntraumatic than the abuse or neglect itself. The trauma of being separated from one’s parental figures \nis often compounded by the trauma of being separated from one’s siblings. The separation of \n                                                 \n16 The Nat’l Child Traumatic Stress Network, Children with Traumatic Separation: Information for \nProfessionals 2, https://www.nctsn.org/sites/default/files/resources/children_with_traumatic \n_separation_professionals.pdf.  \n \n  50 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 51 of 99\nsiblings in foster care is associated with negative adjustment outcomes, including running away and \nincreased behavioral health issues.17 Due to CYFD’s inadequate array of placements and routine \ncycling of children through multiple placements, the agency often fails to place siblings in the same \nplacement, or even geographical region. Plaintiffs Chris W., Diana D., Olivia L., Matty B., Justin \nB., Jackson B., Brian J., Elliot J., and Michael J. have all been separated from a sibling who is also \nin foster care.  \n156.  Although even a single traumatic experience can impair a child’s well-being, for \nNew Mexico foster children, these events do not take place in isolation. New Mexico foster children \nare subjected to multiple, repeated, and sustained traumatic experiences. As such, they have \nexperienced complex trauma—the exposure to multiple traumatic events, often of an invasive, \ninterpersonal nature and the wide-ranging, long-term impact of this exposure.18 \n157.  Indeed, as catalogued above, each member of the Classes experienced multiple \nforms of trauma. Plaintiff David G., for example, has experienced multiple forms of trauma, \nincluding physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, as well as neglect, losing a sibling to suicide, the \nincarceration of a parent, the incarceration of a sibling, and homelessness. For example, Plaintiff \nDiana D. has experienced the traumas of substance abuse and neglect by her mother, sexual abuse \nby an older brother, homelessness, and consistent bullying at school.

Complex  Trauma’s  Effects  on  Brain  Development,  Function,  and \nNeurobiology  \n \n158.  Decades of medical research have overwhelmingly established that the brains of \nchildren who experience chronic or repeated traumas undergo material changes. These changes \ndemonstrably  impair  brain  functioning  and  the  neurological  and  endocrine  systems.  This \nimpairment in turn interferes with the ability to perform daily activities, including eating, sleeping, \nconcentrating, thinking, communicating, learning, emotional-self regulation, setting goals, and \nlong-term planning. These impairments fall squarely within the meaning of “disability” under the \nRehabilitation Act and the ADA.  \n159.  The human brain, especially the developing brain of a child, is plastic and adaptable. \nThis plasticity allows us to meet the challenges, tasks, and situations we encounter in our daily \nlives. However, when an individual is repeatedly exposed to trauma, the brain becomes over-\nsensitized to any potential stimulus that might signal a threat. Such a person may perceive ordinary \nencounters as threatening ones, triggering a reactive “fight or flight” or dissociative mode.19 \n                                                 \n19 Bruce D.

With severe or chronic trauma, “states become traits”: the hyper-aroused “fight” \nstate or the detached, dissociative state becomes the brain’s new equilibrium. In practice, this means \nthat if a child repeatedly experiences fear, the areas of the brain that control behavior directed by \nfear can become over-sensitized, and “full-blown response patterns”—such as hyper-arousal or \ndisassociation—can be triggered by seemingly innocuous stimuli.20 The child might reasonably \nperceive ordinary questions from therapists or foster parents, sudden physical movements, or \ndisagreements as challenges, triggering hostility or withdrawal. In a child welfare system that is not \ntrauma-sensitive, this child will likely be treated as disruptive and will be removed and taken to \nanother, likely more restrictive, placement. \n161.  The  wounds  inflicted  by  trauma  may  be  invisible,  but  they  are  unmistakably \nrevealed  by  brain  imaging  of  children  exposed  to  traumatic  experiences  such  as  abuse, \nabandonment, and neglect. The figure below shows abnormal brain development following neglect \nin early childhood. The CT scan on the left is an image from a healthy three-year-old with an \naverage head size (50th percentile). The CT scan on the right is an image from a three-year-old \nsuffering from extreme neglect. This child’s brain is significantly smaller than average (3rd \npercentile).21 \n                                                 \n20How ‘States’ Become ‘Traits’, supra note 19, at 277–79. \n21See Victor G.

The effects of unaddressed exposure to complex trauma can have far reaching \nconsequences for the life activities of children and young people. Some of the activities impacted \ninclude: \n•  Abnormal Sleeping and Eating Patterns. Children impacted by complex trauma \noften experience sleep disturbances and eating disorders.23 Plaintiffs Chris W., Kevin S., Jennifer \nH., and Olivia L. have abnormal sleeping patterns. Plaintiff Diana D. has been diagnosed with an \neating disorder. \n•  Impact  on  Cognition, Learning,  and  Concentrating.  Trauma  affects  mental \nreasoning  functions,  including  reasoning,  problem  solving,  or  evaluating  cause-and-effect \nrelationships.24 A child who is exposed to severe or chronic trauma may also become preoccupied \nwith the traumatic events and replay them over and over in her mind, making it harder for her to \nthink, learn, and focus.25 The difficulty concentrating caused by exposure to trauma can impair a \n                                                 \n22 Bruce D.

Children impacted by complex trauma \noften have difficulty communicating their wishes and needs and interpreting cues from others.27 \nPlaintiffs Chris W., Kevin S., Jennifer H., Diana D., Olivia L., Matty B., Brian J., and Elliot J. have \ndifficulty communicating with others and interpreting cues from others.  \n•  Emotional Self-Regulation. Complex trauma often induces a predictable set of \nbehaviors due to loss of ability to emotionally self-regulate, including aggression, disproportionate \nreactivity, impulsivity, distractibility, or withdrawal and avoidance. Plaintiffs Chris W., Jennifer H., \nKevin S., Diana D., Olivia L., Matty B., Justin B., Elliot J. and Brian J. have difficulty emotionally \nself-regulating. Plaintiffs Chris W., Jennifer H., Kevin S., and Diana D. have been diagnosed with \ndisorders indicating inhibited emotional self-regulation, including oppositional defiant disorder, \nintermittent explosive disorder, and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.  \n•  Goal-Setting and Long-Term Planning. Traumatized children also have a more \ndifficult time setting and achieving goals. Children who do not feel safe at their placement, school, \nor therapy and who are often in a state of hypervigilance tend to “act instead of plan,”28 focusing \n                                                 \n26 Bessel A.

Consequently, their ability to make plans or \ndecisions, set goals, work toward those goals, and reflect on progress can be compromised.29 \nPlaintiffs Chris W., Kevin S., Jennifer H., and Diana D. have difficulty making decisions, setting \ngoals, and long-term planning.  \n•  Ability to Care for Oneself. Traumatized children can have difficulty caring for \nthemselves and managing their hygiene. Plaintiff David G. periodically has trouble caring for \nhimself and managing hygiene. \n163.  Because the developing brain of a child is plastic and adaptable, widely published \nand peer-reviewed research shows that trauma-informed, evidence-based treatment, services and \nsupports help children impacted by complex trauma heal, ameliorating the impacts of the condition.  \nC.  Trauma Exposure and Adverse Outcomes for New Mexico’s Foster \nYouth \n \n164.  Because members of the Classes have endured more than one form of trauma, they \nare more likely to experience significant adverse outcomes.30 \n                                                 \n29 Ray Wolpow et al., The Heart of Learning and Teaching: Compassion, Resiliency, and Academic \nSuccess 12 (2009) (hereinafter “The Heart of Learning”), available at http://://www.k12.wa.us/ \ncompassionateschoolspubdocs/TheHeartofLearningandTeachingTheHeartofLearningandTeaching.p\ndf; Bruce D.

Failure  to  address  the  trauma  experienced  by  foster  children  has  lasting \nconsequences for their health, educational achievement, and economic self-sufficiency. Research \nshows that foster children have lower educational outcomes and higher rates of unemployment, \nhomelessness, and incarceration than non-foster children. Elementary-aged foster children achieve \nlower proficiency in English language arts and math than their peers31 and are twice as likely to be \nheld back in school.32 School-age foster children are also more likely to face harsh school discipline. \n66.8% of former foster children surveyed in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin had been suspended from \nschool, more than double the national sample, and 16.5% had been expelled, almost four times the \n                                                 \n4_10_12.pdf (longitudinal study showing that rates of homelessness, joblessness, poverty, and \nincarceration for former foster children well exceed those of peers with no foster care history); Jessica \nBartlett et al., The Impact of a Statewide Trauma-Informed Care Initiative in Child Welfare on the \nWell-being of Children and Youth with Complex Trauma, 84 CHILD.

CYFD AND HSD HAVE FAILED TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN A \nSYSTEM  TO  ENSURE  STABLE  AND  APPROPRIATE  FOSTER  CARE \nPLACEMENTS.  \n166.  CYFD has failed to establish and maintain a system capable of placing children in \nstable foster care placements appropriate to their individual needs. First, CYFD has failed to secure \nan adequate array of placements. As a result, placement decisions are overwhelmingly driven by \nthe vagaries of availability instead of a child’s individual medical, mental, and behavioral health \nneeds. Second, CYFD has failed to hire, support and train staff and service providers—including \ncase workers and mental health providers—in sufficient numbers and with appropriate expertise. \nCYFD  is  therefore  not  capable  of  providing  the  support  and  services  necessary  to  making \nplacements  healthy,  safe,  and  sustainable.  Worse,  by  cycling  children  through  multiple \ninappropriate placements, CYFD harms their mental health and well-being, preventing the creation \nof stable bonds with a caretaker, and interrupting medical, mental health, and behavioral health \ncare. \n167.   HSD’s failure to adequately ensure provision of timely medical, mental health, and \nbehavioral health services for children contributes to CYFD’s failed placement practices. As a \n                                                 \n33 Mark E.

Inadequate and Inappropriate Array of Placements \n1.  Numerous and Short-Term Placements \n168.  Due  to  CYFD’s  systemic  failure  to  secure  an  adequate  array  of  appropriate \nplacements and services for children in its custody, CYFD routinely cycles children through \nnumerous short-term placements, including the CYFD office and short-term shelters. Placing \nchildren in multiple short-term placements devastates their sense of stability. With each removal, \nchildren  sever  ties  with  classmates,  teachers,  therapists,  service  providers,  and  community \nmembers. They must begin forming critical relationships anew, hoping that, but never knowing \nwhether, they will live in their new location long enough to make progress before yet another \nremoval.  \n169.  CYFD routinely cycles children through a series of emergency shelters that are \ndesigned for short term emergency stays and, thus, are not designed to maintain or establish long-\nterm mental health, behavioral health, or medical care. In fact, CYFD rotates children through a \nseries of emergency shelters so frequently that these shelters routinely set up calls with each other \nto plan how they can transfer children from shelter to shelter.  \n170.  CYFD routinely places children in these short-term emergency shelters for months \nat a time. Plaintiffs Chris W., Kevin S., Jennifer H., and Diana D. have been cycled through multiple \nshort-term placements, including the CYFD office, emergency shelters, and acute child psychiatric \nunits. Plaintiff Chris W. was cycled through four placements, including multiple short-term youth \nshelters in Taos and Albuquerque, within a two-month period. \n  59 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 60 of 99\n2.  Overly Restrictive Placements  \n171.  Defendants’  have  an  inadequate  array  of  less-restrictive  placements.  CYFD \ntherefore routinely places children in residential treatment centers not because of medical necessity, \nbut because no other placement options are available. Residential treatment centers are among the \nmost restrictive placements for children in state custody. Children in state custody have the right to \nthe least restrictive treatment and should only be placed in residential treatment centers if it is \nmedically necessary. Defendants’ failure to secure enough placements within New Mexico results \nin children being sent to out-of-state residential treatment centers. According to CYFD, as of \nMay 2018, 137 New Mexico children were placed in out-of-state residential treatment centers; \napproximately 24% of those children were foster children in state custody.35 Plaintiffs Kevin S. and \nJennifer H. are currently placed in residential treatment centers in Utah and Missouri, respectively. \nCYFD does not regularly monitor children once they send them out of the state. Plaintiff Kevin S. \nwas never visited by a CYFD staff member while living in a residential treatment center in Utah \nfor eleven months. \n172.  For example, Plaintiff Jennifer H. was removed from her Medicaid treatment foster \ncare in New Mexico and sent to a residential treatment center in Missouri, again paid for by \nMedicaid. She was moved to a residential treatment center not because her service providers \nrecommended a placement in residential treatment, but because Defendants were unable to identify \na single placement in New Mexico that would accept Jennifer H. after she made an allegation of \nsexual abuse against a foster father. After making this allegation, Jennifer H. was effectively \npunished by being removed and sent to an out-of-state, more restrictive placement. In addition to \n                                                 \n35  CYFD’s  response  to  an  Inspection  of  Public  Records  Act  request  entitled  “Out  of  State \nResidential Placement of NM Children and Youth (12/01/17), produced April 12, 2018. \n  60 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 61 of 99\nbeing overly restrictive for Jennifer H., this placement does not provide her with the services her \ntherapist indicated she needed, including an attachment model and trauma-informed services. \nB.  Unsafe  and  Traumatic  Practices,  Including  Use  of  Restraint  and \nSeclusion  \n \n173.  Defendants routinely deprive children in state custody of their right to be free from \nthe unreasonable use of restraint and seclusion. Restraint and seclusion may be used only if the \ntechnique  is  imposed  to  ensure  physical  safety  of  a  resident  or  staff  member.  42  U.S.C. \n§ 290ii(b)(1). Under Defendants’ supervision, however, residential treatment centers and treatment \nfoster care providers routinely use restraints and seclusions on children in CYFD custody for \nprohibited reasons, including for staff convenience, or as coercion, discipline, or retaliation by staff.  \n174.  Restraint and seclusion are ineffective36 methods of behavioral control and result in \nsevere  physical  and  psychological  harm  to  children,  especially  children  who  have  already \nexperienced trauma. Studies have shown that being restrained is a traumatizing experience in and \nof itself.37 Those who are secluded reportedly experience higher feelings of stress, vulnerability, \n                                                 \n36 Studies have shown that the use of restraint and seclusion intervention leads to an increase in many \nof the behaviors that those utilizing the intervention hope to eliminate. See, e.g., R.J. Jones & G.D. \nTimbers, An analysis of the restraint event and its behavioral effects on clients and staff, 11 \nRECLAIMING CHILD. AND YOUTH,  37–41  (2002),  available  at  https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ646799. \nThose who experience restraint or seclusion are both more likely to remain in care longer and to be \nreadmitted for care upon release. Alternative behavioral intervention strategies such as collaborative \nproblem solving (CBS), which place an emphasis on directly addressing a child’s trauma, have been \nproven more effective in constructively managing an intensely frustrated child that would otherwise \nbe subject to restraint or seclusion. Andrés Martin et al., Reduction of Restraint and Seclusion \nThrough Collaborative Problem Solving: A Five-Year Prospective Inpatient Study, 59 PSYCHIATRIC \nSERVICES 1406 (2008), available at https://www.livesinthebalance.org/sites/default/files/Martin%20 \nPsychiatric%20Services%202008.pdf. \n37 Kathleen Ferreira, Promoting Alternatives to the Use of Seclusion and Restraint, Issue Brief #1, \nU.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration \n2 (2010), https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/topics/trauma_and_violence/ \nseclusion-restraints-1.pdf . \n \n  61 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 62 of 99\nneglect, fear, rejection, and anger. For those children that have already experienced trauma, the use \nof restraints can be re-traumatizing.38 \n175.  The use of restraint and seclusion as a behavioral intervention strategy places \nchildren at risk of serious physical harm. Personal restraints can subject children to a variety of \ninjuries, including coma, broken bones, bruises, cuts, and facial damage. It can also cause death due \nto asphyxiation, strangulation, cardiac arrest, blunt trauma, and choking. Plaintiff Kevin S. was \nrepeatedly restrained, often for over an hour at a time. As a result, he appeared at a court hearing \nwith bruised eyes and other facial wounds. \n176.  Chemical restraints are similarly dangerous to children’s health and yet are routinely \nused on children in CYFD custody. The powerful psychotropic drugs and sedatives used pose a \nsignificant risk to children’s physical and mental health, and in some cases can lead to death by \ndrug overdose. For example, staff at one of the largest residential treatment centers in Albuquerque, \nroutinely use or threaten to use “booty juice,” a sedative or other psychotropic medications on \nchildren when their disruptive behaviors do not threaten the child or another with imminent, serious \nphysical harm. \n177.  CYFD has failed to uphold its obligation to ensure that inappropriate restraint and \nseclusion practices are not used39 against children in its custody,40 including children in out-of-state \nresidential treatment centers.41 It has failed to ensure that the policies and practices of a placement \nit  certifies  comply  with  CYFD  regulations,  including  CYFD  regulations  on  restraints  and \n                                                 \n38 Id.  \n39 N.M.

For example, Plaintiff David G. was restrained 13 out of 14 days at his residential \ntreatment center in Albuquerque, yet he remains in this placement. CYFD received multiple \nincident reports detailing how Plaintiff Kevin S. had been repeatedly harmed by both staff and other \nresidents and how he had repeatedly been restrained multiple times a week for substantial periods \nof time, sometimes for an entire hour, by staff. Nevertheless, CYFD kept Kevin S. at this placement \nfor a year. Plaintiff Chris W. was also repeatedly restrained at his residential treatment center. \nC.  Inappropriate Placements for Children Covered by ICWA \n178.  CYFD has failed to place children covered by ICWA within its custody in the least \nrestrictive setting that approximates a family. In New Mexico, over 50% of the Native children in \nCYFD’s custody from 2010 to 2016 were cycled through two or more placements.44 By being \npushed from one placement to the next, these children are deprived of a setting that “approximates \na family.” \n179.  Further, though required to by law, CYFD has not put a preference on placing Indian \nchildren with a member of their family or with their tribe. “Having enough families to meet the \nintent of the Indian Child Welfare Act is a big problem,” according to the Director of CYFD’s \n                                                 \n42 N.M.

Governor Martinez conceded that “the state foster care system needs more Native \nAmerican foster families.”46 She acknowledged that as of 2012, CYFD had sixty-five Indian foster \nchildren in its custody in Bernalillo County, yet had only three Native foster families in that \ncounty.47 Further, CYFD only had two Native foster homes to serve the fifty-two Native foster \nchildren in San Juan County.48 Though there were seventy Native foster children in McKinley \nCounty, CYFD only had three Native licensed foster homes there in 2012, with another ten homes \non the Navajo Reservation.49 Between 2012 and 2016, the number of Native children in CYFD’s \ncustody has increased by almost 42%.50 \n181.  In addition to having inadequate foster placements, ICWA protected children in \nCYFD’s custody are also “often . . . adopted by non-Native families,” according to the Director of \nCYFD’s Protective Services Division.51 Infrequent adoption of Native children by Native families \nis inconsistent with the intent of ICWA.  \n                                                 \n45 Dan Frosch, Focus on Preserving Heritage Can Limit Foster Care for Indians, N.Y.

Inadequate Support and Trainings for Foster Families or Relatives \n182.  When CYFD does place children with foster families, rather than at the CYFD \noffice, emergency short-term center, or a restrictive residential treatment center, it fails to provide \nfoster families with the support and trauma-informed trainings necessary to equip the foster parent \nto care for the child. As a result, foster parents often feel they cannot adequately meet a child’s \nmedical, mental health, and behavioral needs and have no choice but to request the child’s removal.  \n183.  For example, due to CYFD’s failure to provide the necessary support for Chris W.’s \nfoster parents, his foster parents requested he be removed. As a result, CYFD separated Chris W. \nfrom his siblings and cycled him through several short-term placements. Due to CYFD’s failures \nto provide Brian J.’s aunt with sufficient foster parent services, his aunt requested that he be \nremoved on an emergency basis. CYFD separated Brian J. from his siblings and placed him back \nwith his mother, even though his Guardian ad Litem repeatedly expressed that this placement would \nharm Brian J.’s safety and well-being. While Brian J. was placed with his mother, CYFD again \nfailed to provide the mother with sufficient in-home support, and Brian J. was removed and sent to \na shelter within three weeks. \n184.  CYFD fails to provide adequate trauma-informed trainings and services even to \nthose foster parents who have explicitly requested them. Plaintiff Olivia L.’s aunt repeatedly \nrequested support services from CYFD but received none. After less than one month, Olivia L.’s \naunt requested that her niece be removed. Olivia L. was then cycled through multiple short-term \nshelters and was raped by two adults at one of those shelters. \nE.  School Disruption and Inappropriate Placements  \n185.  CYFD’s failure to understand the impact of trauma and separation on children is \ndemonstrated by its failure to keep children in their home schools, despite its legal obligations to \n  65 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 66 of 99\nmaintain school placements. CYFD’s placement practices make staying in the same school nearly \nimpossible. In the 2013-14 school year, 26% of children in protective services custody were in more \nthan one school district and 55% experienced one or more withdrawals.52 Since entering CYFD \ncustody in November 2016, Matty B. has been cycled through five placements and three schools, \nsometimes changing schools in the middle of the semester. Plaintiff Diana D. has not earned a single \nhigh school credit in a year as a result of CYFD cycling her through at least eleven placements in \nunder two years.  \n186.  Although complex trauma impacts learning, CYFD fails to address children’s needs \nfor services and support in school. Even when children have known learning needs, CYFD routinely \nfails to identify children who need an IEP, notify a child’s new school that he or she qualifies for \nspecial education services, or ensure that children’s IEPs are followed.53 Plaintiff Justin B. was \nevaluated for an IEP only after his foster mother urged the school to evaluate him. He qualified for \nservices due to a developmental delay in his fine motor skills and sensory processing. CYFD failed \nto ensure that Brian J., Elliot J., and Diana D., all of whom have had IEPs for years, were provided \nIEPs when they changed schools.  \nIV.  NEW MEXICO’S SYSTEM OF CHILD WELFARE IS UNDERSTAFFED \nAND LACKS NECESSARY EXPERTISE.  \n187.  New Mexico’s system of child welfare lacks the capacity to provide necessary \nsupport  and  training  to  foster  children,  foster  families,  and  relatives  because  it  is  woefully \n                                                 \n52 FosterEd New Mexico, Building Champions for System-Involved Students: FosterEdProgress \nUpdate, FosterEd 3 (Feb. 23, 2018), http://foster-ed.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FosterEd-\nNM-Progress-Update.pdf”(hereinafter “Building Champions”). \n 53 The statewide special education participation rate was 13.9 and the rate for protective services \ninvolved students was 31.3%.

CYFD’s System Lacks Internal Expertise and Does Not Provide \nSufficient Staff Trainings or Support \n \n188.  CYFD has recognized the need to appropriately train staff and address the impact of \ntrauma on children and secondary trauma on staff members in particular.54 Yet it has wholly failed \nto do so. CYFD does not provide or require its staff to participate in comprehensive, ongoing, in-\nperson trainings on trauma, secondary-trauma, compassion fatigue, or self-care. Rather, CYFD \noccasionally provides trauma-related trainings, some of which last only one hour, are offered only \nonline, and only to some staff members.55 CYFD’s current trainings are not mandatory and are not \navailable to foster parents, kinship caregivers and birth parents. The core of a trauma-informed child \nwelfare system is ongoing training for the full child welfare workforce, and this core cannot be \nmaintained by occasional, optional one-hour trainings for only a portion of CYFD’s staff. \n189.  Research has demonstrated that, without appropriate support and training, social \nworkers and other service providers working closely with traumatized children may experience \n                                                 \n54 CYFD, Key Quarterly Performance Measures Report, 2d Quarter, Fiscal Year 2018, at 14 (N.M. \n2018).  \n55 CYFD, 2015 – 2016 Comprehensive Training Plan (Title IV-E, Title IV-B, CAPTA, CFCIP, \nCBCAP), https://cyfd.org/docs/2015-2016_Comprehensive_Training_Plan.pdf (last visited July 23, \n2018).  \n \n  67 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 68 of 99\ncompassion fatigue,56 secondary traumatic stress (or “vicarious trauma”), and burnout.57 Work-\nrelated exposure to the trauma of others can manifest in the same symptoms exhibited by those who \nendured  the  underlying  trauma—including  physical  distress,  fatigue,  difficulty  sleeping, \ndetachment, numbness, despair, depression, anxiety, increased irritability, intrusive thoughts, social \nwithdrawal, and diminished concentration.58 In the longer term, unaddressed secondary traumatic \nstress leads to burnout, “a state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion,” and increased \nturnover of service providers.59As a result, even dedicated CYFD staff may be less likely to remain \nin the job for long. At the end of fiscal year 2016, CYFD reported a 29.7 percent turnover rate for \nprotective services workers.60 In addition to being costly for the system, the turnover that can result \nfrom burnout and secondary traumatic stress exacerbates the complex trauma experienced by the \nchildren by creating an unstable and unpredictable environment.61 \nB.

The number of personnel employed by Defendant CYFD is insufficient to meet \nCYFD legal obligations to children in state custody. Experts have established nationally recognized \nstandards for the maximum number of cases to be assigned to a single caseworker while still \nachieving effective and responsive services. Both the Child Welfare League of America, a coalition \nof private and public agencies that develops child welfare policies, and the Council on Accreditation \n(COA), an independent and nonprofit organization that publishes accreditation standards for state \nwelfare agencies, have established that caseloads should not exceed 15 children per caseworker for \npermanency planners62 or 12 children per caseworker for investigators.63 CYFD’s caseloads fail to \nmeet these national standards. \n191.  CYFD has admitted that high caseloads have resulted in failure to keep children safe \nfrom harm, failure to provide appropriate services, and/or failure to promptly identify a permanent \nplacement. For example, although New Mexico law requires that its caseworkers visit each of their \nchildren at least once every thirty days, 8.26.2.17 NMAC, as a result of high caseloads, CYFD \ncaseworkers were unable to visit all of the children for whom they were responsible each month.64 \nExcessive  job  vacancy  was  identified  as  a  cause  of  CYFD’s  failure  to  identify  or  prevent \nmaltreatment of over 15% of children in CYFD’s custody for 12 months or longer.65 CYFD has \n                                                 \n62 Sean Hughes & Suzanne Lay, Child Welfare League of America, Direct Service Worker’s \nRecommendations for Child Welfare Financing and System Reform 5 (2012), https://www.cwla.org/ \nwp-content/uploads/2014/05/DirectServiceWEB.pdf; State of N.M., Rep. of the Legis.

Caseworkers are not consistently engaging with \ncaregivers and children effectively in order to assess needs, case plan, provide services, and monitor \nprogress.”66  Finally,  CYFD  reports  that  “high”  caseloads  contributed  to  its  failure  to  attain \npermanency for 70% of children within 12 months of their entry into CYFD’s custody.67 Research \nhas likewise shown that high caseworker turnover is strongly correlated with children experiencing \nmultiple placements, receiving fewer services, staying in foster care longer, and failing to achieve \npermanency. \nV.  CYFD’S  AND  HSD’S  FAILURE  TO  ESTABLISH  AND  MAINTAIN  A \nSYSTEM  FOR  DELIVERY  OF  MEDICAL,  MENTAL  HEALTH,  AND \nBEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES CAUSES CHILDREN’S HEALTH TO \nDETERIORATE WHILE IN STATE CUSTODY. \n192.  CYFD and HSD have failed to put a system in place that would enable them to \nmeet their legal obligation to conduct comprehensive health screenings for children in state \ncustody and to promptly provide necessary and required services. CYFD’s and HSD’s failure to \nimplement a system of assessment, preventative care, and delivery of necessary and effective \nhome- and community-based services to identify and meet children’s needs early in the process \nhas had devastating consequences for the mental health, safety, and well-being of Plaintiffs and \nmembers of the Classes.  \nA.  CYFD’s and HSD’s Failure to Adequately Screen for Trauma and \nMental and Behavioral Health Needs \n \n193.  When children enter state custody due to allegations of abuse and neglect, CYFD \nand HSD have no comprehensive, coordinated, or appropriate system for assessing their mental \n                                                 \n66 Id. at 18; see also N.M.

They routinely fail to conduct appropriate screening for mental health and behavioral \nhealth needs, including needs related to the impact of trauma. Although mental and behavioral \nhealth screenings should be conducted as soon as a child enters the child welfare system, CYFD \nand HSD have no system in place for ensuring these screenings occur promptly. The legally \nmandated comprehensive screening for EPSDT is required to include mental and behavioral health \nscreening, but often only consists of a basic health assessment. Without screening, CYFD and HSD \ncannot ensure that Plaintiffs and members of the Classes receive support and services that are \nessential to their health and well-being. \n194.  If and when children do receive a screening for mental and behavioral health, the \nscreening is not consistently conducted in a high-quality manner: screenings are not comprehensive, \nstandardized,  integrated  with  other  health  assessments,  and/or  conducted  by  qualified  and \nappropriately trained professionals. CYFD’s and HSD’s woefully insufficient screenings do not \ncomport with the prevailing standards of care for assessing trauma-impacted youth. The screenings \nprovide insufficient data to allow CYFD and HSD to identify children who need further assessment \nand intervention, to form the basis for a child’s treatment,68 or to meet an individual child’s trauma-\nrelated needs and mental, emotional, or behavioral disorders or conditions.  \n195.  Even if a child receives a proper mental and behavioral health screening under \nEPSDT,  and  even  if  the  screening  indicates  that  the  child  needs  a  full  neuropsychological \nevaluation, he or she will often wait an entire year to receive the evaluation. Plaintiffs Chris W., \nBrian J., Elliot J., and Michael J., for example, did not receive the required evaluations until they \nhad been in custody for eleven months or more. Diana D. did not receive a comprehensive mental \n                                                 \n68 The social worker assigned to children in CYFD custody must participate in the development of \nany behavioral health treatment plan. 8.320.2.15(c)(2)(c) NMAC.  \n  71 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 72 of 99\nor behavioral health evaluation when she entered state custody, and over a year later, is still on a \nwaitlist for a neuropsychological evaluation. \n196.  CYFD and HSD have no system in place to ensure ongoing monitoring of children’s \nmental and behavioral health needs, including assessment of complex trauma and psychotropic drug \nprescriptions. Both the Medicaid Act and evidence-based practices for trauma-informed care \nrequire screening and monitoring to be repeated, at prescribed intervals and after major events, such \nas a change in placement. But CYFD and HSD have no system in place for proactively identifying \nnew symptoms, assessing treatment progress, monitoring outcomes, or guiding case progress. \nInstead, changes to a child’s treatment are nearly exclusively made reactively, and typically under \ncrisis circumstances when the manifestations of ineffective and insufficient treatment plans emerge.  \n197.  CYFD and HSD overuse psychotropic drugs, which are not meant to be a long-term \ntreatment, to manage symptoms that escalate as a result of CYFD’s failure to provide adequate \nservices. CYFD and HSD lack a system for ongoing monitoring of the use of psychotropic \nmedication to ensure that children are not being over- or mis-medicated.69 For example, Diana D. \nwas prescribed at least nine different psychiatric medications by at least six different physicians in \na one-year period. \nB.  CYFD’s and HSD’s Failure to Ensure Delivery of Appropriate and \nCoordinated Mental and Behavioral Health Services \n \n                                                 \n69 Children in foster care are more likely to be prescribed psychotropic drugs, some of which carry \nhigh-risk side-effects. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., Center for Medicaid and CHIP \nServices, Opinion Letter (July 11, 2013). These drugs may be overprescribed in the first instance \ndue to lack of appropriate screening, assessment, and treatment. Id. When prescribed, the use of \npsychotropic drugs should be justified by clinical evidence identified in screenings, mental health \nassessments, and the child’s treatment plan.  \n  72 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 73 of 99\n198.  CYFD and HSD have failed to implement a system to ensure prompt delivery of \nappropriate and coordinated behavioral and mental health services to children in state custody. Even \nif such a system were implemented, CYFD and HSD have failed to ensure that an appropriate and \ncoordinated network of providers exists to deliver sufficient home and community-based mental \nhealth services to children in CYFD custody. As a result, many Plaintiffs and members of the \nClasses are not receiving necessary services, and the services that are delivered are inconsistent and \nuncoordinated, undermining their efficacy. \n199.  Decades of research and clinical experience have established that intensive home \nand community-based mental and behavioral health services are both successful and cost-effective. \nThey are a necessary treatment method for children with the most severe emotional and behavioral \nproblems.  Indeed,  in  recognition  of  the  superior  outcomes  achieved  by  offering  home-  and \ncommunity-based care options, New Mexico developed its Medicaid program “to maximize the \nincentives to support people in their homes and communities.”70 Yet despite the state’s obligation \nto ensure an adequate provider network exists to deliver necessary services, see 42 U.S.C. § 1396u-\n2(b)(5); 42 C.F.R. § 438.68, 8.308.2.9 NMAC, intensive home- and community-based mental and \nbehavioral health services are simply unavailable to Plaintiffs and members of the Classes. And \ndespite  the  requirements  that  services  be  delivered  with  reasonable  promptness,  even  in \nAlbuquerque, the largest city in the state, children requiring access linger on waiting lists for months \n                                                 \n70 N.M.

Members of the Classes placed in rural areas of the state have even less access to necessary \nservices.  \n200.  Because of the lack of available home- and community-based mental and behavioral \nhealth services, many Plaintiffs and members of the Classes receive woefully insufficient services \nor do not receive these services at all. Services are denied even when screening identifies them as \nnecessary. For example, Jennifer H. was repeatedly denied the targeted analytic behavior therapy \nand structured peer interactions required by her psychological evaluation. Children living in rural \ncommunities outside of major cities have particular difficulty in securing services and appropriate \nevaluations because of the absence of providers in rural areas. \n201.  Further,  HSD’s  system  of  delivering  Medicaid  medical,  mental  health,  and \nbehavioral health services does not coordinate among service providers through a wraparound \nservices  model.  As  a  result,  the  limited  services  available  to  Plaintiffs  are  delivered  in  an \ninconsistent and uncoordinated manner, seriously undermining their effectiveness. For example, \nChris W. received no individual therapy until he had been in CYFD custody for nearly four months \nand, two years later, still has not received grief counseling after his mother’s death. Diana D. \nreceived no services at all for her first month in custody and has since gone weeks at a time without \nany services. Plaintiffs Matty B. and Justin B. did not receive court-ordered family therapy with \ntheir parents until they had been in custody for two years. \n202.  CYFD also routinely fails to oversee children’s discharge from therapy. As a result, \nchildren  are  prematurely  discharged  from  therapy  while  in  CYFD  custody,  their  behavioral \nchallenges return and escalate, and that predictably results in their removal from their placements. \n  74 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 75 of 99\n203.  Overly restrictive placements exacerbate the physical, mental, and behavioral health \nchallenges that Plaintiffs and members of the Classes face.71 As HSD and CYFD have recognized, \n“residential treatment is a non-evidence based practice and the most costly behavioral health service \nfor children.”72 Placing children in residential facilities is not only ineffective, but also significantly \nmore expensive than providing appropriate home- and community-based care. \nVI.  TRAUMA-SENSITIVE PRACTICES IN SYSTEMS OF CHILD WELFARE \nARE EFFECTIVE AND NECESSARY. \n204.  In a child welfare system, in which every child has been impacted by trauma, \nmodification of the entire system is not only an effective means to address complex trauma \nexperienced by children, but is essential in order to meaningfully accommodate the effects of \ntrauma.  \n205.  Child welfare and mental health professionals have developed and implemented \nevidence-based, trauma-informed child welfare systems that successfully address the impact of \ntrauma on children in foster care.73 Effective, trauma-informed systems of child welfare share the \n                                                 \n71 New Mexico’s application stated that children and youth with Serious Emotional Disturbance \n(SED) were best served using a system of care approach. Waiver Application, id. at 18 (“Single \nservices (such as residential treatment or medication) provided in isolation with no linkage to other \nneeded services for severe or complex, chronic behavioral health disorders rarely leads to sustained \nand  stable  recovery  and  wellness.  These  isolated  services  can  paradoxically  exacerbate \nsymptomalogy and increase risk much as an inadequate dosage of antibiotics can greatly increase \nthe danger from infection.”) \n72 Results First, supra note 6, at 33 (collaboration between New Mexico Legislative Finance \nCommittee, HSD, and CYFD); see id. at 1 (“Forty-six percent of the state’s children’s behavioral \nhealth spending in 2015 was for acute out-of-home treatment without evidence of its effectiveness. \nGreater investment in prevention and early and community-based interventions, emphasizing \ncommunity-based  interventions,  is  needed  to  reduce  out-of-home  treatment  and  improve \noutcomes.”). \n73  See  The  Nat’l  Child  Traumatic  Stress  Network,  Creating  Trauma-Informed  Systems, \nhttps://www.nctsn.org/trauma-informed-care/creating-trauma-informed-systems  (last  visited \nJuly 18, 2018). \n \n  75 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 76 of 99\nfollowing core elements: (1) trauma-sensitive training for all involved adults; (2) screening for \ntrauma and prompt provision of appropriate, adequate, and coordinated behavioral and mental \nhealth services; (3) monitoring a child’s health and treatment; (4) ensuring appropriate placements \nand placement supports; and (5) implementing wraparound services. \n206.  Trauma-Sensitivity Training for Child Welfare Workforce and Families. The \ncore of a trauma-informed child welfare system is ongoing training for staff at all agency levels,74 \nincluding frontline staff, caseworkers, supervisors, administrators, and other staff, as well as foster \nparents,75 kinship caregivers and birth parents.76 Trauma-sensitive training should enable the adult \nworkforce to (1) recognize and understand trauma and its prevalence in the child welfare system, \n(2) implement proven trauma-focused responses to address the needs of individual children, \n(3) understand and respond appropriately to their own secondary trauma and (4) know agency \npolicy and procedures supporting trauma-informed care.77 \n207.  Screening for Trauma, Assessing Functional and Mental Health, and Promptly \nProviding Appropriate, Adequate, and Coordinated Medical, Mental Health, and Behavioral \nHealth Services. Trauma-informed child welfare systems include a trauma screening, a functional \n                                                 \n74  Even  though  child  welfare  staff  may  not  be  responsible  for  delivering  trauma-informed \ninterventions, they must be able to appropriately assess and refer families to evidenced-based \ntreatment providers and they must be able to assess if interventions being delivered are having \npositive  outcomes.

Ongoing Monitoring of a Child’s Health and Treatment. After the initial trauma \nscreening, screening should be repeated periodically, such as every six months or after major events \nsuch as a change in placement, in order to identify new symptoms and assess treatment progress.80 \nLikewise, trauma-informed systems must monitor the use of psychotropic medication to ensure that \nchildren are not being over or mis-medicated.  \n209.  Ensuring Appropriate Placements and Placement Supports. Trauma-informed \nsystems  also  provide  children  in  foster  care  with  safe,  stable,  and  ultimately  permanent \nplacements. This is necessary because multiple placements are especially harmful to children \nimpacted by complex trauma and disrupt their medical, mental health, and behavioral health \ntreatment, as well as appropriate family contact. Trauma-informed placements also provide children \nin foster care with the least restrictive placements that meet their individualized medical, mental \nhealth, and behavioral health needs. Placement stability should prioritize fewer placements and \nplacements that are closer to the child’s original home, school, and community. Services and \nsupports should be provided in a child’s own community and within their own culture.81 Services \n                                                 \n78 Susan Ko et al., Creating Trauma-Informed Systems: Child Welfare, Education, First Responders, \nHealth Care, Juvenile Justice, 39 PROF.

Wraparound Services. A trauma-informed system should effectively coordinate \namong  providers  of  medical,  mental  health,  and  behavioral  health  care  services  through \nwraparound services. Children and families involved in foster care have complex needs and there \nare often multiple agencies and caregivers involved in each child’s care. The wraparound model \naddresses this challenge by creating a specific team for each child that includes his or her family, \nall other providers, as well as other natural supports that the family and youth may identify.83 The \nteam creates a plan for services together, ensures the provision of services, and adjusts the plan as \nneeded based on the changing needs of a child.84 The wraparound approach has shown positive \neffects for child outcomes and expenditure reduction in other states and a New Mexico legislative \nreport has noted the program’s efficacy.85 \nVII.  CYFD AND HSD ARE DELIBERATELY INDIFFERENT TO PLAINTIFFS’ \nRIGHTS.  \n211.  For decades, Defendants have stood witness to the profound impacts that trauma has \non the mental, behavioral, and physical health of New Mexico’s foster care children. Current and \nformer CYFD and HSD leaders have repeatedly acknowledged the impact of trauma on the \nbehavioral and mental health of children, especially children in foster care.86 CYFD leaders have \nalso repeatedly acknowledged that their system is failing to meet the needs of children in its custody, \n                                                 \n82 Id. \n83 Center for Health Care Strategies, Making Medicaid Work for Children in Child Welfare: Examples \nfrom the Field 10 (2013), https://www.chcs.org/media/Making_Medicaid_Work.pdf.  \n84 Id. at 10. \n85 Results First, supra note 6, at 30–31.  \n86 New Mexico Legislative Finance Committee, HSD, and CYFD, Building A Better Children’s \nBehavioral Health Care System 2, 3 (Jan. 11, 2018) (unpublished PowerPoint presentation).  \n \n  78 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 79 of 99\nfailing to meet federal standards,87 deteriorating in performance, and causing devastating harm to \nfoster children.  \n212.  In addition to making such public statements, CYFD and HSD have repeatedly been \nplaced on notice of the need to address trauma in the child welfare system and the impact of their \nfailure to do so. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act (CFSIA) requires \nstates to report on “how health needs identified through screenings will be monitored and treated, \nincluding emotional trauma associated with a child’s maltreatment and removal from home . . . .” \n42 U.S.C. § 622(b)(15)(A)(ii). The media has repeatedly covered CYFD’s and HSD’s failures and \nthe  harms  they  have  caused  children.88  Even  though  CYFD  and  HSD  have  repeatedly \nacknowledged their failures and have repeatedly been placed on notice of the harms their failures \nhave caused, they have not meaningfully addressed them. \n213.  CYFD has also repeatedly acknowledged in its annual reports that it has failed to \nmeet the needs of children in its custody, citing the very deprivations at issue in this complaint, \nincluding: \n                                                 \n87 Key Quarterly Performance Measures Report, supra note 54, at 20. \n88See, e.g., Ed Williams, A pattern of failures: Investigation reveals serious abuses within treatment \nfoster care system, Searchlight New Mexico (May 16, 2018), http://projects.searchlightnm.com/rnm-\nbreaking/treatment-foster-care/; Ed Williams, From foster care to youth advocate: After passing \nthrough more foster homes than he can count, Albuquerque man works to help others, Searchlight \nNew  Mexico,  http://projects.searchlightnm.com/rnm-breaking/treatment-foster-care-qna/,  (last \nvisited July 18, 2018); Cynthia Miller, Foster care survivors fight to improve the system, SANTA FE \nNEW MEXICAN (July 16, 2016), http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/foster-care-\nsurvivors-fight-to-improve-the-system/article_1eb904ae-52b6-596e-9af3-304a3d2a8206.html.  \n \n  79 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 80 of 99\n•  the failure to meet the federal standard regarding placement moves per 1,000 days \nof foster care for children entering foster care in a twelve-month period due to “the number of \navailable foster families…and the array of services available to meet the needs of foster children”;89 \n•  that children are “frequently” placed in “short term emergency placements at the \ntime of removal,”90 including CYFD offices, and the need to “[d]evelop crisis continuum services \nto avoid overnight stays in CYFD offices”91; \n•  regional disparities in stability of placements.92 For example, compared to the state \naverage of 3.0 placement moves per 1,000 days in care, as of the second quarter of 2018, that \naverage  was  double  or  nearly  double  in  several  regions,  including  Chaves  (7.3  moves), \nColfax/Union (5.9 moves), and Curry (5.8 moves);93 \n•  an overall lack of an “array of services available to meet the needs of foster \nchildren”94 and the need “to increase trauma-informed practices in all levels of care”95 and “to \nincrease capacity to provide wraparound services targeting CYFD-involved youth in or at risk of \nout-of-home placements”;96 \n•  the need to reduce protective services worker caseloads, both to “[m]inimize further \nharm to children and youth” and to reduce the staff turnover rate;97 \n                                                 \n89 Key Quarterly Performance Measures Report, supra note 54, at 20.  \n90 Id.  \n91 CYFD, Annual Report and Strategic Plan, Fiscal Year 2017 at 21 (N.M. 2017). \n92 See generally Children Youth & Families Dep’t Protective Servs., 360 Quarterly State and County \nProfiles, 2d Quarter, Fiscal Year 2018 (N.M. 2018).  \n93 See id. at 44, 78, 83. \n94 Key Quarterly Performance Measures Report, supra note 54, at 11.  \n95  CYFD,  Annual  Report  and  Strategic  Plan,  Fiscal  Year  2017  at  21  (N.M.  2017), \nhttps://cyfd.org/docs/fy17_annual_report_final.pdf. \n96 Id.  \n97 Id. at 15–16.  \n \n  80 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 81 of 99\n•  that protective services worker retention is a “key challenge” and requires trainings \nthat “address[] secondary trauma”;98 and  \n•  the need to “[t]ighten financial controls to ensure that funds are monitored and \nallocated to reduce waste and improve the quality of life of our clients.”99 \n214.

CYFD has acknowledged that its performance is deteriorating. In the first quarter of \n2012, 17.5% of children in foster care for up to twelve months had three or more placements.104 In \nthe first quarter of 2017, that number was over 27%.105 \n216.  CYFD and HSD have also acknowledged that trauma-informed wraparound and \ncommunity-based services are effective and have made it a goal “to increase capacity to provide \nwraparound services targeting CYFD-involved youth in or at risk of out-of-home placements.”106  \n217.  Notwithstanding these deficiencies CYFD has acknowledged, CYFD has failed to \nspend funds that had been allocated or appropriated for implementation of programs to improve \nservices for children in its custody.107 \n218.  HSD officials have acknowledged that PTSD is the most expensive child behavioral \nhealth disorder in New Mexico and that residential treatment centers are the highest cost service for \nchildren, making up 22% of the of the state’s expenditures on children’s behavioral health.108 \nNonetheless, HSD and CYFD continue to ignore early intervention community-based treatments \nthat would prevent delayed, acute intervention from being necessary, save individual children the \npain of unaddressed medical, mental health, and behavioral health issues, and save the state money.  \nVIII.  THIS ACTION CANNOT BE BROUGHT IN THE CHILDREN’S COURT \nAND IT DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH THE CHILDREN’S COURT \nJURISDICTION.  \n219.

Plaintiffs instead challenge the unlawful systemic practices of CYFD and \nHSD officials, practices that the Children’s Court is incapable of remedying.  \n220.  The systemic issues alleged in this complaint are ones that cannot be remedied in \nthe Children’s Court, either because State law bars the interposition of Plaintiffs’ claims in \nChildren’s Court or because the systemic nature of the claims and remedies renders the Children’s \nCourt an inadequate forum.  These limitations are described in the Affidavit of the Hon. John J. \nRomero, Senior Judge of the Children’s Court Division of the Second Judicial District of New \nMexico, attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated herein by reference.  \n221.  “[T]he children’s court is only permitted to do what is specifically authorized by the \nCode.” State of N.M. ex rel. CYFD v. Paul G., 2006-NMCA-038, ¶15, 139 N.M. 258 (internal \nquotation and citation omitted). The Children’s Code does not authorize the Children’s Court to: \n•  order CYFD to recruit and license the necessary number of foster care placements \nin New Mexico;  \n•  require CYFD to secure an adequate array of services for children in its custody; \n•  mandate that CYFD identify family members or recruit an adequate number of tribe-\naffiliated or approved foster families for children covered by ICWA; \n•  assess the appropriate level of CYFD staffing or to order CYFD to employ more \ncaseworkers or other employees; \n•  order CYFD or HSD to change its policies and practices. \n222.  Nor is the Children’s Court able to: \n•  order  CYFD  to  place  children,  including  children  covered  by  ICWA,  in  less \nrestrictive placements when such placements, because of the Defendants’ failures, are unavailable; \n  83 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 84 of 99\n•  order  CYFD  or  HSD  to  provide  services  that  they  have  not  made  available, \nincluding,  but  not  limited  to,  ICWA-required  remedial  services  and  rehabilitation  programs \ndesigned to prevent the breakup of Indian families; \n•  remedy CYFD and HSD’s failure to put in place processes and services sufficient to \nprovide for the needs of Plaintiffs and similarly situated children and to comply with their \nobligations under federal law.  \n223.  Even if these issues were not systemic, CYFD’s practices render the Children’s \nCourt an inadequate forum to remedy CYFD’s failures even in individual cases. This is true for \nmultiple reasons:  \n•  First, CYFD routinely engages in emergency placement changes that do not result \nin advance notice to the Children’s Court or to a child’s Guardian ad Litem or youth attorney; \nlacking notice, there is no opportunity to contest the move before it occurs.  \n•  Second, even when placement changes are not made on an emergency basis, CYFD \nattorneys regularly fail to timely file notices of change of placement. As a result, guardians ad litem \nand youth attorneys do not learn about placement changes until weeks later, when it is too late to \nadvocate against that change in placement without running the risk that such a motion, even if \nsuccessful, will only uproot the child again, thereby inflicting more trauma.  \n•  Third, because there are insufficient quality placements in New Mexico to meet the \nneeds of all children in the foster care system, if and when the Children’s Court does order CYFD \nto alter a specific placement decision, even if that new placement proves adequate for that child, it \nlimits placement options for other children.  \n224.  The remedies Plaintiffs seek to address CYFD’s failures will promote, not interfere \nwith, the Children’s Court’s ability to exercise its jurisdiction. By requiring CYFD to secure more \n  84 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 85 of 99\nplacement options, Plaintiffs’ requested relief will afford the Children’s Court more options and \nflexibility when it concludes that CYFD has abused its discretion in a particular placement decision. \nSimilarly, remediation of CYFD’s inadequate staffing levels will promote, not interfere with, the \nChildren’s Court’s ability to exercise its jurisdiction under the Children’s Code. CYFD’s employees \nplay critical roles in the custody adjudication process that is the responsibility of the Children’s \nCourt. These staffing shortages necessarily limit the quantity and quality of information that CYFD \ncan gather and provide to the Children’s Court in making its custody determinations and thereby \ndirectly interfere with the Children’s Court’s ability to exercise its jurisdiction. Likewise, the \ntraining Plaintiffs seek through this action will promote the Children’s Court’s ability to perform \nits statutorily authorized functions. When CYFD staff suffer from burnout, exhaustion, and high \nrates of turnover, they are less able to assist the Children’s Court in providing the information that \nit needs to function effectively.  \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Against All Defendants for Violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act) \n225.  Plaintiffs hereby re-allege and incorporate by reference the foregoing paragraphs of \nthis Complaint as though fully set forth herein.  \n226.  Under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, “[n]o otherwise qualified individual \nwith a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation \nin, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under . . . any program or activity \nreceiving federal financial assistance….” 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n227.  A “program or activity” includes “all of the operations of a department…of a State.” \nId. § 794(b)(1)(A). \n  85 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 86 of 99\n228.  CYFD  and  HSD  receive  federal  funds  and  are  therefore  covered  by  the \nRehabilitation Act. \n229.  As children in the custody of the State of New Mexico who have been adjudicated \nabused, abandoned or neglected, Plaintiffs and members of the Classes are eligible for the public \nbenefit of the New Mexico child welfare system and Medicaid. \n230.  For purposes of the Rehabilitation Act, an “individual with a disability” is defined \nas it is in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”). See 29 U.S.C. § 794(a); 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12101 et seq.  \n231.  The definition of “disability” under the ADA is a “physical or mental impairment \nthat substantially limits one or more life activities,” including, but not limited to, “caring for oneself, \nperforming manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, \nspeaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working.” 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 12102(1)(A), (2)(A) (emphasis added).  \n232.  The effects of complex trauma cause impairment that limits a child’s ability to \nperform major life activities including eating, sleeping, concentrating, thinking, communicating, \nlearning,  emotional-self  regulation,  setting  goals,  and  long-term  planning,  and  major  bodily \nfunctions of the brain, neurological, and endocrine systems. \n233.  Plaintiffs and members of the Classes have experienced complex trauma and its \neffects,  substantially  limiting  them  with  regard  to  eating,  sleeping,  concentrating,  thinking, \ncommunicating, learning, emotional-self regulation, setting goals, and long-term planning, and \nmajor bodily functions of the brain, neurological, and endocrine systems. Plaintiffs therefore meet \nthe definition of “individuals with disabilities” within the meaning of the Act and are entitled to \n“meaningful access” to the benefits, services, and programs provided by CYFD and the benefits, \n  86 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 87 of 99\nservices, and programs established, administered, supervised, and provided for by HSD through its \nMedicaid program. \n234.  Solely by reason of their exposure to complex trauma and its effects, each of the \nPlaintiffs and members of the Classes have been denied meaningful access to the New Mexico child \nwelfare system. Complex trauma impairs a child’s ability to meaningfully access the benefits of the \nfoster care and Medicaid systems where reasonable accommodations have not been made for \nchildren impacted by complex trauma.  \n235.  There  are  effective  and  reasonable  accommodations  that  Defendants  could \nimplement that would create a trauma-informed child welfare system that would allow Plaintiffs \nand members of the Classes to enjoy the benefits of the foster care and Medicaid systems. Examples \ninclude trauma-sensitive training for all staff; screening children for trauma; promptly providing \nappropriate, adequate and coordinated medical, behavioral health, and mental health services; \nmonitoring  a  child’s  health  and  treatment;  ensuring  appropriate  placements  and  placements \nsupports; and providing wraparound services.  \n236.  Defendants have failed to implement reasonable accommodations that would allow \nmembers of the Classes to receive the benefits of the child welfare system offered by Defendants. \n237.  Defendants have also engaged in acts or omissions that inflict and exacerbate \ncomplex trauma on children in New Mexico’s child welfare system. For example, Defendants have \nrepeatedly transferred children between placements, many of which are overly restrictive, remote, \nand/or utilize inappropriate physical and chemical restraints. These acts can and do create trauma \nfor children in CYFD’s custody who are enrolled in or are eligible for HSD’s Medicaid program. \nThis trauma in turn can result in disabilities that interfere with these children’s ability to access \n  87 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 88 of 99\nfoster care and Medicaid services. CYFD’s and HSD’s failure to accommodate the very disability \nthey helped facilitate constitutes discrimination on the basis of disability. \n238.  Because of these acts and omissions, the Plaintiffs and members of the Classes have \nbeen denied the benefits of New Mexico’s child welfare and Medicaid systems solely on the basis \nof their disability. \n239.  Plaintiffs and members of Classes are entitled to appropriate relief. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Against All Defendants for Discrimination Under the Americans with  \nDisabilities Act of 1990) \n240.  Plaintiffs hereby re-allege and incorporate by reference the foregoing paragraphs of \nthis Complaint as though fully set forth herein. \n241.  Under Title II of the ADA, “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason \nof such disability, be excluded from participation in, or be denied the benefits of the services, \nprograms, or activities of a public entity, or subjected to discrimination by any such entity.” 42 \nU.S.C. § 12132. \n242.  CYFD and HSD are public entities under Title II of the ADA.  \n243.  As children in the custody of the State of New Mexico who have been adjudicated \nabused, abandoned or neglected, Plaintiffs and members of the Classes are eligible for the public \nbenefits of the New Mexico child welfare system and New Mexico’s Medicaid system. \n244.  The definition of “disability” is a “physical or mental impairment that substantially \nlimits one or more life activities,” including, but not limited to, “caring for oneself, performing \nmanual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, \n  88 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 89 of 99\nbreathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working.” 42 U.S.C. \n§§ 12102(1)(A), (2)(A) (emphasis added).  \n245.  The effects of complex trauma cause impairment that limits a child’s ability to \nperform major life activities including eating, sleeping, concentrating, thinking, communicating, \nlearning,  emotional-self  regulation,  setting  goals,  and  long-term  planning,  and  major  bodily \nfunctions of the brain, neurological, and endocrine systems. \n246.  Plaintiffs and members of the Classes have experienced complex trauma and its \neffects,  substantially  limiting  them  with  regard  to  eating,  sleeping,  concentrating,  thinking, \ncommunicating, learning, emotional-self regulation, setting goals, and long-term planning, and \nmajor bodily functions of the brain, neurological, and endocrine systems. \n247.  Solely by reason of their exposure to complex trauma and its effects, each of the \nPlaintiffs and members of the Classes have been denied meaningful access to the New Mexico \nfoster care and Medicaid systems. Complex trauma impairs a child’s ability to meaningfully access \nthe benefits of the child welfare system where reasonable accommodations have not been made for \nchildren impacted by complex trauma.  \n248.  There  are  effective  and  reasonable  accommodations  that  Defendants  could \nimplement that would create a trauma-informed child welfare system and would allow Plaintiffs \nand members of the Classes to enjoy the benefits of the child welfare system. Examples include \ntrauma-sensitive  training  for  all  staff;  screening  children  for  trauma;  promptly  providing \nappropriate, adequate and coordinated medical, mental health, and behavioral health services; \nmonitoring  a  child’s  health  and  treatment;  ensuring  appropriate  placements  and  placements \nsupports; and providing wraparound services.  \n  89 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 90 of 99\n249.  Defendants have failed to implement reasonable accommodations that would allow \nmembers of the Classes to receive the benefits of the child welfare system offered by Defendants. \n250.  Defendants have also engaged in acts or omissions that inflict and exacerbate \ncomplex trauma on children in New Mexico’s child welfare system. \n251.  Because of this failure, the Plaintiffs and members of the Classes have been denied \nthe benefits of adequate foster care and Medicaid services solely on the basis of their disability. \n252.  Plaintiffs and members of the Classes are entitled to appropriate relief. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Against All Defendants for Unlawful Segregation Under Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990)  \n \n253.  Plaintiffs hereby re-allege and incorporate by reference the foregoing paragraphs of \nthis Complaint as though fully set forth herein. \n254.  CYFD and HSD receive federal financial assistance. \n255.  CYFD and HSD are public entities under title II of the Americans with Disabilities \nAct. \n256.  Complying with the state’s Medicaid obligations to provide prompt and adequate \nscreening, treatment,  and monitoring of medical, mental, and behavioral health issues is, at \nminimum, a reasonable modification and indeed is independently required by the Medicaid Act. \n257.  Defendants have failed to administer services, programs and activities in the most \nintegrated setting appropriate to the needs of children in CYFD’s custody. 28 C.F.R. §35.130(d).  \n258.  Plaintiffs and members of the Classes have been placed in unduly restrictive settings, \ndespite their ability to benefit more from treatment in a less restrictive setting.  \n  90 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 91 of 99\n259.  Both Section 504 and the ADA prohibit unjustified segregation of persons with \ndisabilities. See 29 U.S.C. § 794; 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101(a)(2), (a)(5). This means that the state must \nprovide appropriate community based treatment services. Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 \nU.S. 581, 602 (1999). \n260.  Unjustified segregation, in the form of treatment settings that severely limit the \nexposure of persons to the outside community, constitutes discrimination on the basis of disability. \nId. at 597. \n261.  The segregation of children in the CYFD system into environments that are more \nrestrictive than necessary constitutes discrimination as defined in Olmstead under both Section II \nof the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  \n262.  Defendants have discriminated against Plaintiffs by denying them the opportunity \nto participate in CYFD’s and HSD’s foster care and Medicaid programs and services; and aiding \nand perpetuating discrimination by assisting other Defendant agencies in discriminating against \nPlaintiffs. 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1). \n263.  Defendants have further discriminated against Plaintiffs in violation of the ADA by \nutilizing criteria or methods of administration that have the effect of (i) subjecting Plaintiffs to \ndiscrimination  on  the  basis  of  disability;  (ii)  substantially  impairing  accomplishment  of  the \nobjectives of CYFD’s foster care program and HSD’s Medicaid program; and (iii) perpetuating \ndiscrimination by other Defendant agencies subject to common administrative control. 28 C.F.R. \n§ 35.130(b)(3).  \n264.  Plaintiffs and members of the Classes are entitled to appropriate relief. \n  91 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 92 of 99\nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Against All Defendants for Violation of Substantive Due Process under the 14th \nAmendment to the United States Constitution)  \n \n265.  Plaintiffs hereby re-allege and incorporate by reference the foregoing paragraphs of \nthis Complaint as though fully set forth herein. \n266.  Defendants have restrained Plaintiffs’ personal liberty by taking these minors into \nstate custody, assuming responsibility for their safety and general well-being, and thereby rendering \nthem wholly dependent on Defendants. \n267.  Defendants,  while  acting  under  color  of  law,  have  developed  and  maintained \ncustoms, policies, and practices that deprive children who have experienced complex trauma of \ntheir constitutional rights, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983, by failing to provide them with basic \nneeds, including adequate and appropriate medical care and services; conditions of confinement \nthat are reasonably related to the purpose of their custody; reasonable care and safety; and freedom \nfrom an unreasonable risk of harm. CYFD’s and HSD’s practices have caused Plaintiffs’ conditions \nto deteriorate and have subjected them to unsafe conditions and psychological and physical harm, \nin violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Whitley v. New Mexico \nChildren, Youth & Families Dep’t, 184 F. Supp. 2d 1146, 1155 (D.N.M. 2001) (citing DeShaney v. \nWinnebago Cty. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 199–200 (1989)). \n268.  As set forth above, Defendants have acted with deliberate indifference towards \nPlaintiffs. CYFD’s and HSD’s own statements, and the various publications that have put them on \nnotice, establish that Defendants know of the danger to Plaintiffs. In failing to address Plaintiffs’ \ncomplex trauma and in taking actions that worsen Plaintiffs’ complex trauma, Defendants have \nabdicated their duty to act professionally and have thereby caused Plaintiffs’ injuries. \n  92 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 93 of 99\n269.  Plaintiffs and members of the Classes are entitled to appropriate relief. \nFIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Against All Defendants for Violation of the Medicaid Act, Early and Periodic \nScreening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) Services, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq.) \n \n270.  Plaintiffs hereby re-allege and incorporate by reference the foregoing paragraphs of \nthis Complaint as though fully set forth herein. \n271.  Defendants,  while  acting  under  color  of  law,  have  developed  and  maintained \ncustoms, polices, and practices that deprive Plaintiffs and members of the Classes of statutory \nrights, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq. Defendants have failed to provide or otherwise \narrange for early screening and diagnostic services that would determine the existence of any \nphysical  or  mental  illnesses  or  conditions,  in  violation  of  42  U.S.C.  §§ 1396a(a)(10)(A), \n1396a(a)(43)(B),  1396d(a)(4)(B),  and  1396d(r)(1)(A).  Defendants  have  failed  to  arrange  for \nnecessary mental and behavioral health services, including intensive, community, and home-based \nmental  health  services,  that  would  treat  or  ameliorate  their  physical  or  mental  illnesses  or \nconditions, in violation of 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(10)(A), 1396a(a)(43)(C),), 1396d(r)(5).  \n272.  Plaintiffs and members of the Classes are entitled to appropriate relief. \nSIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Against All Defendants for Violation of the Medicaid Act, Reasonable Promptness \nProvision, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8)).  \n \n273.  Plaintiffs hereby re-allege and incorporate by reference the foregoing paragraphs of \nthis Complaint as though fully set forth herein. \n274.  The Medicaid Act requires states to provide EPSDT services to Medicaid-eligible \nchildren under the age of 21 with “reasonable promptness.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8). Defendants \nhave failed to furnish required medical services with reasonable promptness. \n  93 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 94 of 99\n275.  Plaintiffs and members of the Classes are entitled to appropriate relief. \nSEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Against All Defendants for Violation of the Indian Child Welfare Act, U.S.C. \n§ 1915(a) & (b)).  \n \n276.  Plaintiffs hereby re-allege and incorporate by reference the foregoing paragraphs of \nthis Complaint as though fully set forth herein. \n277.  The Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) requires that children covered by ICWA who \nare in foster care receive placements in a least restrictive setting that approximates a family. 25 \nU.S.C. § 1915(b). ICWA also requires that covered children receive preferred placements – for both \npre-adoption and adoption – in Indian foster homes or settings approved by the Indian child’s tribe. \n25 U.S.C. § 1915(a), (b).  \n278.  ICWA defines “Indian child” to mean “any unmarried person who is under the age \neighteen and is either (a) a member of an Indian tribe or (b) is eligible for membership in an Indian \ntribe and is the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe.” 25 U.S.C. § 1903(4). Defendants \nhave failed to promptly identify which children in state custody qualify as Indian children for \npurposes of ICWA.  \n279.  Defendants have denied Sub-Class members access to the least restrictive setting \nthat approximates a family by pushing a majority of the children in CYFD’s custody through \nmultiple placements.  \n280.  Defendants have failed  to have a system of services and supports capable of \nproviding remedial services and rehabilitation programs designed to prevent the breakup of Indian \nfamilies as required by ICWA. 25 U.S.C. §1912(d) \n  94 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 95 of 99\n281.  Defendants have also denied Sub-Class members of the legally preferred pre-\nadoptive placements by failing to acquire an adequate number of tribe-affiliated or approved foster \nfamilies, failing to make appropriate efforts to coordinate with tribes to recruit and support \nplacements, and failing to promptly identify family members or appropriate tribal placements.  \n282.  Defendants have further denied Sub-Class members the legally preferred adoptive \nplacements by too often facilitating the adoption of Indian children by non-Native families.  \n283.  Plaintiffs and members of the Classes are entitled to appropriate relief. \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request the following relief:  \n1.  A determination by this Court that this action may be maintained as a class action. \n2.  Injunctive relief requiring Defendants to implement reasonable accommodations in \nthe form of trauma-sensitive policies and procedures that will allow the members of the Classes an \nopportunity to meaningfully access the child welfare system, including, but not limited to: \na.

Conducting  trauma-informed  screening  for  medical,  mental  health,  and \nbehavioral needs and prompt establishment and provision of appropriate, accessible, adequate, and \ncoordinated medical, mental health, and behavioral health services;  \nc.  Monitoring children’s health and treatment, including periodic functional \nassessments, providing new assessments whenever a child’s placement is changed, and monitoring \nthe use of psychotropic medications; \nd.  Ensuring children are placed in safe and stable placements that are the least \nrestrictive appropriate to their needs, including, but not limited to, ensuring children are not placed \nin CYFD offices; prioritizing keeping sibling groups together and keeping children geographically \nclose to their home communities; eliminating the practice of placing children in multiple short-term \nplacements; enhancing permanency placing; and recruiting, training, and supporting an array of \nappropriate foster placements that meet the individualized behavioral, cultural and mental health \nneeds of children; \ne.  Complying  with  their  obligations  under  ICWA,  including  acquiring  an \nadequate number of tribe-affiliated or approved foster families, making appropriate efforts to \ncoordinate with tribes to recruit and support placements, promptly identifying children covered by \nICWA and family members or appropriate tribal placements, facilitating legally preferred adoptive \nplacements, and providing a system of services and supports capable of providing remedial services \nand rehabilitation programs designed to prevent the breakup of Indian families,  \nf.  Establishing  and  implementing  coordinated,  statewide  individualized \nservices in the least restrictive environment, including but not limited to the provision of intensive \ncommunity based services and needed wraparound services;  \n  96 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 16   Filed 12/28/18   Page 97 of 99\ng.  Ensuring  CYFD  and  HSD  have  sufficient  capacity  to  meet  children’s \nmedical, mental health, and behavioral needs so that medically necessary services for children are \navailable, appropriate, accessible, individualized and promptly delivered; and  \nh.  Ensuring CYFD and HSD coordinate in fulfilling their obligations under the \nlaw and the prayed relief.  \n3.  A declaration that Defendants, through their actions and omissions and policies and \nprocedures complained of, violate: \na.

Many of the documents and much of the information (“Materials” \nas defined herein) to be exchanged through the processes described in the Agreement are \nnormally kept confidential by the parties.  The Materials may contain confidential, proprietary, \nor private information, as is contemplated by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(c)(1), for which \nspecial protection from public disclosure and from use for any purpose other than implementing \nthe Agreement may be warranted. The parties and the Co-Neutrals have agreed to be bound by \nthe terms of this Stipulated Confidentiality and Protective Order (“Order”) in this action to \nfacilitate the exchange of information, and protect the respective interests of the parties in their \nconfidential, proprietary, or private information. This Order shall remain in effect unless \nmodified pursuant to the terms contained in this Order. \nSTATEMENT OF GOOD CAUSE \nThere is good cause for this protective order.  The individual plaintiffs in this action are \nall minors.  The implementation of the Agreement action is likely to involve Children Youth and \nFamilies Department (“CYFD”) official files that are confidential pursuant to NMSA § 32A-4-\n33, education records, disciplinary records, personal information, and medical information of \nminors involved in the child welfare system and their families.  Special protection for these files, \nrecords, and information from public disclosure and from use for any purpose other than the \nprosecution of this action is warranted.  The implementation of the Agreement also is likely to \ninvolve Human Services Department (“HSD”) files, including medical and behavioral health \nrecords of minors that are protected by state and federal confidentiality laws.  Such confidential \nand sensitive materials and information consist of, among other things, confidential behavioral \nhealth, and physical health records; confidential educational records; confidential discipline \nrecords and alleged infractions of students; the confidential and sensitive history of the \nindividual plaintiffs’ personal lives including, but not limited to, experiences of abuse and \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 64   Filed 03/27/20   Page 3 of 10\nneglect and details which may subject them to retaliation in the form of physical harm or \neconomic loss; and other information generally unavailable to the public, or which may be \nprivileged or otherwise protected from disclosure under state or federal statutes, court rules, case \ndecisions, or common law. \n  Further, CYFD official files concerning the plaintiff children, and possibly documents in \npossession of other parties, may constitute confidential records pursuant to NMSA § 32A-4-33.  \nHowever, the Co-Neutrals and counsel for all parties in this case have a legitimate interest as \nprovided in NMSA § 32A-4-33(16) in the records concerning the parties to this action.  \nAccordingly, to expedite the flow of information, to facilitate the prompt resolution of \ndisputes over confidentiality of materials, to adequately protect information the parties are \nentitled to keep confidential, to ensure that the parties and the Co-Neutrals are permitted \nreasonable necessary uses of such material in implementing the Agreement, to address their \nhandling at the expiry of the Agreement, and to serve the ends of justice, a confidentiality and \nprotective order for such information is justified in this matter. \n  IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED THAT:  \n1.  Counsel for CYFD will provide electronic access and/or will make available copies of all \nfiles requested by the Co-Neutrals to the Co-Neutrals and to all counsel as described in Sections \nVI and VII of the Agreement. \n2.  HSD will provide electronic access and/or will make available copies of all files requested \nby the Co-Neutrals to the Co-Neutrals and to all counsel as described in Sections VI and VII of \nthe Agreement.  \n3.  Any document or information produced or exchanged by any of the parties to this \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 64   Filed 03/27/20   Page 4 of 10\naction, or the Co-Neutrals and their staff and/or consultants, or any of their attorneys, which a party \nor Co-Neutral believes is of a confidential nature, may be designated as Confidential.  All such \ndocuments, and all copies (referred to collectively as “Confidential Information”), shall be treated \nas confidential and shall not be disclosed except as provided in this Order. \n4.  The following categories of documents may be designated as “Confidential Information”: \n  CYFD official files that are confidential pursuant to NMSA § 32A-4-33; \n  HSD official files that are confidential; \n  Private medical and/or behavioral health information;  \n  Private health insurance information; \n  Confidential student educational records;  \n  Confidential information regarding discipline; \n  Information about the history of the children’s personal life.  \n \nInformation or documents that are available to the public or that have not previously been kept in \na confidential manner may not be designated as “Confidential Information.”  A party or Co-\nNeutral may designate documents described in this order as Confidential Information by \nimprinting the word “Confidential” on the document or by identifying documents as Confidential \nin writing at the time of transmission.  \n5.  Each and every page of each document designated as Confidential Information shall be \nstamped or marked. If it is not feasible to stamp or mark each page of a document, appropriate \nmeasures, such as the use of binders or containers to house such documents shall be taken.  \n6.  Neither the Confidential Information, nor its contents, shall be disclosed to any other \nperson without the agreement of the party or Co-Neutral who designates the information as \nconfidential, except that counsel or Co-Neutrals may, without further agreement or court order, \ndisclose the Confidential Information to the following persons for use solely in connection with \nthis action under the following conditions: \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 64   Filed 03/27/20   Page 5 of 10\nA.  Attorneys and legal assistants of counsel’s firm and to any other employees of \ncounsel’s firm who shall handle the Confidential Information under normal \noffice procedure; \nB.

The Court and any Court staff and administrative personnel. \nI.  Any mediator, arbitrator, court of competent jurisdiction, or neutral third party \nmutually agreed upon by the parties, including the arbitrator described in the \nAgreement. \n7.  Individuals authorized to review Confidential Information pursuant to this Protective Order \nshall hold the Confidential Information in confidence and shall not divulge the Confidential \nInformation, either verbally or in writing, to any other person or entity, except as provided in \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 64   Filed 03/27/20   Page 6 of 10\nParagraph 6 above.  Individuals given access to Confidential Information under 9(C) or 9(D) of \nthis Order shall be provided with a copy of and shall be bound by this Order. \n8.  The party’s counsel or Co-Neutral who receives Confidential Information or discloses \nConfidential  Information  to  authorized  persons  as  provided  in  Paragraph  6  above  shall  be \nresponsible for assuring compliance with the terms of this Protective Order. \n9.  No copies of Confidential Information shall be made except by, or on behalf of counsel in \nthis litigation and the Co-Neutrals, and such copies shall be made and used solely for purposes of \nimplementing  the  terms  of  the  Agreement.  All  individuals  who  have  been  provided  with \nConfidential Information in the context of this case and in the course of the implementation of the \nAgreement will be bound by the terms of this Order. \n10. If a party or Co-Neutral objects to the designation of documents or other information as \n“Confidential Information”, the party or Co-Neutral shall promptly inform all parties’ counsel and \nall Co-Neutrals in writing of the specific grounds of objection to the designation.  All counsel and \nthe Co-Neutrals shall then, in good faith and on an informal basis, attempt to resolve the dispute.  \nIf after such good faith attempt, all counsel and the Co-Neutrals are unable to resolve the dispute, \nthe  party  or  Co-Neutral  opposing  the  designation  of  documents  or  other  information  as \n“Confidential Information” may move for a disclosure order from the arbitrator or a court of \ncompetent jurisdiction consistent with this Order.  The documents or information shall continue to \nhave Confidential Information status from the time it is produced until the ruling by the arbitrator \nor a court on the motion. \n11. Counsel for the party designating any document as Confidential may, in writing and \nwithout arbitrator or court approval, agree to release any of the Confidential Information from the \nrequirements of this Order. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 64   Filed 03/27/20   Page 7 of 10\n12. Nothing in this Order shall be read to modify the parties’ obligations under the Agreement, \nincluding  the  obligation  to  make  public  certain  final  reports  and  plans  as  specified  in  the \nAgreement. \n13. Neither the conclusion of this action nor the expiry of the Agreement shall relieve counsel, \nthe Co-Neutrals, or other persons obligated under this Protective Order from their responsibility \nto maintain the confidentiality of Confidential Information pursuant to this Protective Order.  A \nparty may seek leave to reopen the case to enforce this Protective Order’s provisions if the case \nhas terminated or may seek to enforce this Order through the dispute resolution procedure in the \nAgreement. \n14. After the expiry of the Agreement, the Co-Neutrals and counsel of record for each of the \nParties shall either return or destroy the Confidential Material that is the subject of this Protective \nOrder and is no longer needed for record-keeping or documentation requirements imposed by law \nor contractual requirements and provide written confirmation to the other counsel of record that \nthe return or destruction of the Confidential Material has occurred. \n15. Nothing in this Protective Order shall preclude any party from filing a motion seeking \nfurther or different protection from the Court under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 26 or 37. \n16. This Order shall remain in effect unless modified by the Court. \nThe terms of this protective order do not preclude, limit, restrict, or otherwise apply to the use of \ndocuments at court proceedings, in arbitration, or in the implementation of the Agreement. Subject \nto the Federal Rules of Evidence, a confidential document may be offered into evidence at trial or \nany court or arbitration hearing, provided that the proponent of the evidence gives advance notice \nto opposing counsel of the intended use of the confidential document as may be required by a \nscheduling or other order.  Any party may move the Court or arbitrator for an order that the \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 64   Filed 03/27/20   Page 8 of 10\nconfidential document be received in camera or under other conditions to prevent unnecessary \ndisclosure.  The Court or arbitrator will then determine whether the proffered evidence should \ncontinue to be treated as a confidential document and, if so, what protection(s) may be afforded to \nsuch information at the trial or hearing.  \n \n            ________________________________ \nLAURA FASHING \nUNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE \n \n \n \nAgreed, Stipulated and Submitted by: \n \nApproved: \n \n/s/ Jesselyn Friley    /s/ Grant Davis-Denny   \nMark Rosenbaum   Grant A.

Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 4 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 62-1   Filed 03/26/20   Page 6 of 51\n \nA.  Co-Neutrals \nAppointment: The Parties appoint Kevin Ryan, Judith Meltzer, and Pamela Hyde as the \nthree Co-Neutrals referenced in this Agreement.  In the event that any of the Co-Neutrals are \nunavailable to serve in this role or become unable to serve in this role during the term of this \nAgreement, the Parties agree to appoint a subject matter expert to serve in their place, so that \nthere are always three Co-Neutrals at any time.     \nRole as Neutrals: The Co-Neutrals shall function in a neutral capacity and shall exercise \ntheir duties under this Agreement in good faith and without bias in favor of or against any Party.  \nThe retention of the Co-Neutrals shall be conducted solely pursuant to the procedures set forth in \nthis Agreement and shall not be governed by any formal or legal procurement requirements.  The \nCo-Neutrals shall hire such staff and engage such consultants as the Co-Neutrals deem necessary \nto discharge their responsibilities under this Agreement.  As a courtesy, the Co-Neutrals shall \nprovide the resumes of any staff members or consultants working on the implementation of this \nAgreement to Defendants, but Defendants shall not have any authority over the Co-Neutrals’ \nchoice or assignment of staff members and/or consultants. \nFees: Defendants shall be responsible for paying the Co-Neutrals’ fees and costs and the \nfees and costs required for staff and/or consultants assisting the Co-Neutrals. \nAuthority: The Co-Neutrals shall have the authority reasonably necessary to validate \nbaseline performance related to all Target Outcomes and to evaluate and audit progress toward \nachievement of the Implementation Targets and Target Outcomes.  That authority includes the \nability to hire staff and engage consultants; contract with entities for data analysis and/or \nvalidation; request and receive reports and updates at regular intervals; request underlying data, \nfiles, and records; conduct verification activities, including communicating independently with \nany individual, including but not limited to executive branch staff, providers, caregivers and \nothers as they determine necessary; and gather other information from Defendants.

All final \nreports prepared by the Co-Neutrals in connection with this Agreement shall be public \ndocuments and shall be posted on the Parties’ websites.  The Co-Neutrals shall have the authority \nto change the deadlines for the Co-Neutrals’ reports, but changes to any such deadlines will not \nhave the effect of changing the deadlines for Defendants’ reports. \nB.  Implementation Targets and Target Outcomes \nImplementation Targets are process commitments that Defendants agree to undertake as \nintermediary and necessary steps toward reaching the Target Outcomes.  \n \nTarget Outcomes are performance commitments that Defendants agree to reach in \nconsideration for Plaintiffs’ agreement to dismiss the Kevin S. Litigation.  \n \n  The Appendices define and set forth Implementation Targets and Target Outcomes in the \nfollowing subject areas:       \n– Trauma-Responsive System of Care (Appendix A) \n– Least Restrictive and Appropriate Placements (Appendix B) \n42822446.1   \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 5 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 62-1   Filed 03/26/20   Page 7 of 51\n \n– Indian Child Welfare Act (Appendix C) \n– Behavioral Health Services (Appendix D) \n \nDeadlines:  The Parties have negotiated specific completion dates for each \nImplementation Target and Target Outcome.  Defendants agree to adhere to these deadlines.  The \nParties may not modify, amend or extend these deadlines other than by mutual consent in \nwriting.   \nC.  Implementation \n1. Data Validation Plan: By December 1, 2020, Defendants will submit to Plaintiffs and \nthe Co-Neutrals a written Data Validation Plan that has been approved by the Co-Neutrals.  \nDefendants and the Co-Neutrals shall begin to collaborate on the Data Validation Plan by March \n15, 2020.  The Data Validation Plan will set forth a process, including methodology and data \nsources, for validating Defendants’ progress toward achieving the Implementation Targets and \nTarget Outcomes.  The Data Validation Plan will set clear timelines for taking any intermediary \nsteps necessary to validate progress toward the Implementation Targets and Target Outcomes \nand assign responsibility for supplying information necessary to fulfill the Data Validation Plan.  \nThe Co-Neutrals will evaluate the Data Validation Plan in consultation with each Party.  \nCompletion of a Data Validation Plan that has the approval of the Co-Neutrals is an \nImplementation Target.  The Parties will attempt to resolve any disagreements about the Data \nValidation Plan in good faith.  If they cannot do so, any disputes about the Data Validation Plan \nshall proceed through the dispute resolution process in Section IX on an expedited basis, with \ndeadlines set by the Co-Neutrals and the arbitrator, as appropriate.   \n    2. Baseline Reports:  By December 1, 2020, Defendants will provide to Plaintiffs and \nthe Co-Neutrals a baseline report and all data underlying the report.  The baseline report shall \nassess Defendants’ achievement of the Implementation Targets.  It shall also describe \nDefendants’ baseline performance with respect to the Target Outcomes during the period from \nJanuary 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019.   \n    By April 1, 2021, the Co-Neutrals shall provide a baseline report to Plaintiffs and \nDefendants.  The Co-Neutrals’ baseline report shall validate Defendants’ achievement of the \nImplementation Targets pursuant to the Data Validation Plan and shall include a determination \nof whether Defendants have met the Performance Standard with respect to each Implementation \nTarget.  The Co-Neutrals’ baseline report shall also validate Defendants’ performance with \nrespect to the Target Outcomes during the period from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019.   \n    If the Co-Neutrals cannot validate Defendants’ data in accordance with the Data \nValidation Plan for any reason, including but not limited to concerns about availability or \naccuracy of data sources, the Co-Neutrals and their staff and/or consultants will establish a \nbaseline using a quantitative and qualitative review protocol, which may incorporate third party \ndata, information from Plaintiffs, and sampling procedures. \n42822446.1   \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 6 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 62-1   Filed 03/26/20   Page 8 of 51\n \n  Before issuing their final report, the Co-Neutrals will: 1) provide the Parties no fewer than \n15 Days to comment on a draft report, 2) confer with each party about the draft report, and 3) \ntake into consideration each party’s comments.   \n  The baseline reports shall be made public on the Parties’ websites.  \n    3. Data: By May 1, 2021, and every twelve months thereafter, Defendants shall provide \nto Plaintiffs and the Co-Neutrals any data required to validate the Target Outcomes for the \nprevious calendar year.  For example, data covering the period from January 1, 2020 to \nDecember 31, 2020 shall be provided by May 1, 2021. \n    4. Annual Reports:  By August 1, 2021, and every twelve months thereafter, Defendants \nshall provide to Plaintiffs and the Co-Neutrals a written report of their progress with respect to \nthe Target Outcomes and Implementation Targets.  The period of assessment for each annual \nreport shall be the previous calendar year—for example, the report due by May 1, 2021 shall \ndescribe Defendants’ performance from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020.  Defendants’ \nannual reports and any plans, reviews, or policies referenced therein shall be made public on the \nParties’ websites.  These assessments are intended to be informational, and disagreements related \nto the content of these reports shall not proceed through the dispute resolution process in Section \nIX. \n  By November 15, 2021, and at least every twelve months thereafter, the Co-Neutrals shall \nprovide a report to the Parties on Defendants’ progress towards the Implementation Targets and \nTarget Outcomes.  The period of assessment for each annual report shall be the previous calendar \nyear—for example, the report due by November 15, 2021 shall describe Defendants’ \nperformance from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020.  The Co-Neutrals shall give the Parties \nno fewer than 15 Days to comment on a draft report, shall confer with each Party, and shall take \nthe Parties’ comments into consideration when finalizing their reports.     \n  The Defendants’ and Co-Neutrals’ reports will assess Defendants’ progress with respect to \neach Implementation Target and Target Outcome and will evaluate whether Defendants have met \nthe Performance Standard with respect to any Implementation Target and Target Outcome for \nwhich the deadline is due or has passed.  In making these assessments, Defendants and the Co-\nNeutrals shall consider evidence gathered pursuant to the Data Validation Plan and any \nqualitative review protocol, as well as data and information provided by the Parties, data and \ninformation available from third party sources, and other relevant factors.  They shall also \nconsider the Goals and the prefatory language in each Appendix.  A lack of progress shown in \ndata (or even negative data) as to any Implementation Target or Target Outcome does not require \na finding that Defendants have not met the Performance Standard.  If Defendants fail to provide \naccurate and verifiable data in a timely manner, the Co-Neutrals may find that they have not met \nthe Performance Standard. \n  Defendants’ and the Co-Neutrals’ annual reports shall also discuss efforts by Defendants to \nachieve the designated Performance Standard for each Implementation Target and Target \nOutcome and any activities that Defendants and/or the Co-Neutrals have undertaken to meet \ntheir obligations under this Agreement during the previous year.  \n  The Co-Neutrals’ methods may include, but are not limited to, analyses of information \ncollected by Defendants’ management and information systems (if and when available and \n42822446.1   \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 7 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 62-1   Filed 03/26/20   Page 9 of 51\naccurate), reviews of case records, aggregation of data, and interviews with Defendants’ \npersonnel, contractors and their staff and/or consultants, service providers and their staff and/or \nconsultants, Children in State Custody or formerly in state custody and their families, and other \nchild welfare and behavioral health stakeholders.  A Child in State Custody will only be \ninterviewed if they affirmatively agree to be interviewed.  The Co-Neutrals will provide \nreasonable notice of any planned interview with a Child in State Custody to the child’s Guardian \nad Litem or Youth Attorney.  If the Guardian ad Litem or Youth Attorney believes that an \ninterview will harm the Child in State Custody, the Guardian ad Litem or Youth Attorney will \nnotify the Co-Neutrals and the interview will not proceed.  \n5. Monitoring: The Implementation Targets are steps that need not be monitored once \nthey have been achieved.  If the Co-Neutrals find that the Defendants have met the Performance \nStandard for a specific Implementation Target, that Implementation Target shall not be \nreassessed in further reports.  If the Co-Neutrals find that the Defendants have not met the \nPerformance Standard for a specific Implementation Target, the Implementation Target shall be \nreassessed every year thereafter until the Performance Standard is met. \nEach Target Outcome shall be monitored until Defendants have met the Performance \nStandard for that Target Outcome continuously for a period of at least 24 months, as described in \nSection VIII. \n6. Meetings: The Co-Neutrals shall preside over a meeting between the Parties at least \ntwice a year.  In 2020, the Parties and Co-Neutrals shall make every effort to hold these meetings \nin July and December.  In all subsequent years, the Parties and Co-Neutrals shall make every \neffort to hold the first meeting no more than 30 Days after the release of Defendants’ annual \nreport and the second meeting no more than 30 Days after the release of the Co-Neutrals’ annual \nreport.  The Parties may provide comments on Defendants’ and/or the Co-Neutrals’ reports to the \nCo-Neutrals and all other Parties in advance of each meeting.   \nVII.REQUESTS FOR AND ACCESS TO INFORMATION\nRequests for Information: The Parties agree that in order to create the Data Validation\nPlan, to set a baseline for the Target Outcomes, and to evaluate progress toward achieving the \nImplementation Targets and Target Outcomes, the Co-Neutrals and their staff and/or consultants \nwill require reasonable access to information.  \nDefendants will designate an employee to facilitate the Co-Neutrals’ access to information, \nincluding access to Defendants’ personnel.  The employee will be accountable to both CYFD \nand HSD and will have expertise in the issues covered by this Agreement and its Appendices.  \nThe designated employee will provide the Co-Neutrals and their staff and/or consultants with \naccess to all requested information, including confidential information, and will not have the \nauthority to deny any Co-Neutral’s request for information or access, or otherwise to restrict the \nCo-Neutrals’ access to information.  In addition to ensuring that the Co-Neutrals have remote \nelectronic access to Defendants’ data systems that collect or record information necessary to \nvalidate performance under this Agreement, Defendants will respond to any requests for \nadditional information from the Co-Neutrals within 14 Days of the request unless the Co-\n42822446.1 \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 8 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 62-1   Filed 03/26/20   Page 10 of 51\n \nNeutrals agree to a different deadline.  Plaintiffs may submit proposed written requests for \ninformation to the Co-Neutrals, who may in their discretion submit such requests to Defendants.  \n  The Parties and Co-Neutrals will enter into a Protective Order to facilitate access to \nconfidential information.  In the event the Co-Neutrals seek the review of confidential \ninformation contained in the individual records of Proposed Class members not named as \nplaintiffs in this proceeding, Disability Rights New Mexico (“DRNM”) and Native American \nDisability Law Center (“NADLC”) may obtain those records and release them to counsel \npursuant to their federal authority and with the consent of the individual or their guardian.  \nWhere DRNM and NADLC lack authority to obtain or release the record, the following \nprocedures will apply: \na)  Plaintiffs will obtain a release from the individual child if they are age 14 or older and from \nthe child’s parent/guardian if they are younger than 14.  Plaintiffs may use the release to obtain \nthe information sought directly.  \nb)  If the name/contact information is not known to Plaintiffs but is known to Defendants, \nDefendants will provide that information so that Plaintiffs may obtain a release. \nc)  If there is no way to obtain a release or if Plaintiffs believe that effort will be futile and there \nis reasonable cause to believe that an individual child is not being appropriately served under this \nAgreement, Plaintiffs may seek an order from any court of competent jurisdiction requiring the \nrelease of confidential information from CYFD, HSD, and/or the provider of services.  Under \nmost circumstances, Defendants will take no position on the request or will stipulate to the order \nfor the release of information so long as notice is provided to the individual child and legal \nguardian and they are given an opportunity to be heard, and so long as the requested order \nincludes provisions adequate to protect the confidential information from unauthorized \ndisclosure.    \n  Access to Defendants’ Personnel: As reasonably necessary to assess the implementation of \nthis Agreement, the Co-Neutrals and their staff and/or consultants shall have the power to confer \nwith and interview Defendants’ personnel.  The Co-Neutrals must direct any request to meet \nwith Defendants’ personnel to the employee designated to facilitate the Co-Neutrals’ access to \ninformation in first instance.  Plaintiffs and Defendants’ Counsel shall receive reasonable notice \nof the dates and topics of such meetings and may propose that alternate or additional personnel \nprovide information to the Co-Neutrals regarding the designated topics.  The Co-Neutrals shall \ndecide whether to confer with and interview the alternate or additional personnel proposed by the \nParties.  Neither Party shall send representatives to such meetings aside from the personnel to be \ninterviewed.  Defendants’ personnel must participate in the meeting in good faith and Defendants \nshall not retaliate against any of their personnel who provide information to the Co-Neutrals or \ntheir designees.  The Parties may propose to the Co-Neutrals the names or positions of any of \nDefendants’ personnel that they believe should be interviewed about Defendants’ progress \ntowards meeting the Implementation Targets and Target Outcomes.    \n \nVIII.  CERTIFICATION OF IMPLEMENTATION TARGETS AND TARGET \nOUTCOMES \n42822446.1   \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 9 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 62-1   Filed 03/26/20   Page 11 of 51\n \n  When the Co-Neutrals certify that Defendants have met the Performance Standard for an \nImplementation Target, or have met the Performance Standard for a Target Outcome for a \ncontinuous period of no less than 24 months, they may certify that Defendants have done so and \nmay declare that the Implementation Target or Target Outcome is no longer subject to \nmonitoring in the Co-Neutrals’ reports.  Once an Implementation Target or Target Outcome is no \nlonger subject to monitoring, it is severable from the rest of the Agreement for the purposes of \ndetermining expiration of the Agreement.   \n \nIX.  DISPUTE RESOLUTION \n  A. Alternative Dispute Resolution and Arbitration.  Any dispute arising out of or \nrelated to this Agreement shall be subject to the following process:   \n \nStep 1 – Alternative Dispute Resolution:  At any time following the execution of this \nAgreement, any Party or Parties may notify the other Parties that they are initiating the \nalternative dispute resolution process by providing written notice of the issue in dispute, the \ninitiating Party’s position on that dispute, and their choice to initiate the dispute resolution \nprocess to all other Parties and to the Co-Neutrals.  The Co-Neutrals shall attempt to resolve the \ndispute through mediation within 30 Days of the initiation of the dispute.  The Parties shall use \ngood-faith, best efforts to discuss and resolve the dispute.   \n \nFor any dispute over whether the Defendants have met the Performance Standard for an \nImplementation Target or Target Outcome by the agreed-upon deadline, the Co-Neutrals and the \nParties shall attempt to agree on a corrective action plan through mediation.  No Party shall \ninitiate the arbitration process in Step 2 until the time for Defendants to complete any corrective \naction plan has expired. \n \nStep 2– Arbitration: After the Parties have completed the alternative dispute resolution process \nset forth in Step 1 and any time to resolve the disputed issue through a corrective action plan has \nelapsed, any Party may initiate binding arbitration.  A Party may not initiate arbitration without \nhaving completed the alternative dispute resolution process set forth in Step 1.  The Parties \nintend arbitration to be the exclusive means for resolving any disputes arising out of or related to \nthis Agreement that cannot be resolved through the alternative dispute resolution process set \nforth in Step 1.  To the maximum extent allowed by law, the Parties hereby voluntarily and \nknowingly waive their rights to bring a dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement in \ncourt.   \n \n  1.  Arbitration Procedure:  A Party may initiate arbitration by providing written \nnotice to the other Parties of their choice to do so no less than 14 Days from the completion of \nthe mediation or the expiration of the corrective action plan, whichever is longer.  The Parties \nappoint Hon. James Hall (Ret.) as the arbitrator for any disputes arising under this provision.  In \nthe event that Hon. James Hall is unavailable to serve in this role or becomes unable to serve in \nthis role during the term of this Agreement, the Parties agree to appoint a new arbitrator to serve \nin his place. \n \n42822446.1   \nKevin S. v.

Briefing:  Within 14 Days of the initiating Party’s provision of written \nnotice, the Parties shall file simultaneous opening briefs.  Within 14 Days of the filing of the \nopening briefs, the Parties shall file simultaneous rebuttal briefs.  No reply briefs by any Party \nshall be permitted. \n \n    b.  Hearing:  Subject to the arbitrator’s availability, the arbitrator will hold a \nhearing on the issues in dispute within 7 business days after the filing of rebuttal briefs.  If the \narbitrator is not available within 7 business days, then the hearing shall take place at the \narbitrator’s earliest convenience.  The Co-Neutrals shall not be called as witnesses in the \narbitration but their reports may be submitted as evidence.  \n \n    c.  Decision:  The arbitrator shall render a reasoned decision within 14 Days \nafter the hearing or at the arbitrator’s earliest convenience thereafter.  The arbitrator’s decision \nshall be final and non-appealable except on grounds set forth in the AAA’s Commercial \nArbitration Procedures.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to award any relief necessary to \neffectuate the purpose of this Agreement, including all types of relief, other than monetary \ndamages, that a state or federal court in New Mexico could issue, such as specific performance, \ninjunctive relief, declaratory relief, and reasonable non-monetary sanctions.  If Plaintiffs are the \nprevailing party, the arbitrator, in his discretion, may allow Plaintiffs reasonable attorneys’ fees \nand costs. \n \n    d.  Post-Arbitration Relief:  If the Party against whom the arbitrator rules \nfails to comply with the arbitrator’s ruling in the time set forth in the arbitrator’s decision, the \nprevailing party may confirm and enforce the arbitrator’s award pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. § \n44-7A-23.   \n \n  e.  Other Matters:  The Parties’ arbitration briefs, as well as the arbitrator’s \ndecision, shall be public. The arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by Defendants.  \n \n \nX. DISMISSAL AND NON-RELEASED CLAIMS  \nA. Dismissal: Within 30 Days of the execution of this Agreement by the Parties, \nPlaintiffs shall promptly and voluntarily dismiss with prejudice all causes of action and claims \nalleged in the Kevin S. litigation.  \nB. No Release of Claims for Money Damages: Because the Kevin S. case was limited to \nclaims for injunctive and declaratory relief and for recovery of attorneys’ fees and costs, nothing \nin this Agreement shall be deemed a release, settlement, or waiver of claims by the Plaintiffs or \nmembers of the Proposed Class for money damages against Defendants.   \nC.  No Release of Future Claims: Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed a release, \nsettlement, or waiver of claims by the named Plaintiffs or members of the Proposed Class related \nto or arising out of acts or omissions by Defendants after the Effective Date of this Agreement. \nD.

A trauma-\nresponsive system includes culturally appropriate services and supports.  A trauma-responsive \nsystem of care should utilize collaborative decision-making to identify strengths and needs and \nto develop an individualized plan for the child.  Children should have a voice in decisions about \nwhere and with whom they should live and what services they should receive, and these \ndecisions should occur in a timely manner.  Accurate, complete, and relevant evidence-based \nquality management tools and measures are necessary for the State to implement and refine a \ntrauma-responsive system of care.  The Co-Neutrals will assess whether Defendants have met the \nPerformance Standard with respect to the commitments in this Appendix. \nIMPLEMENTATION TARGETS \nBy December 1, 2020, CYFD and HSD will take the following specific steps necessary to create \nan effective trauma-responsive system of care for Children in State Custody. \n1.  CYFD, with input and collaboration from HSD, will establish Child and Adolescent Needs and \nStrengths (“CANS”) and functional trauma assessment criteria for access to intensive home-\nbased services in consultation with clinical experts agreed upon by Defendants and Plaintiffs.  \nThe criteria will aim to help CYFD, stakeholders, and providers identify children and youth \nfor whom intensive home-based services are medically necessary and will include but not be \nlimited to consideration of Serious Emotional Disturbance (“SED”) criteria, CANS, and \nfunctional trauma assessment screening.  CYFD and HSD will revise SED criteria to clarify \nthat removal from home is not a requirement to access these services. \n \n2.  Trauma-Responsive Training and Coaching Plan.  CYFD and HSD will create a cross-\ndepartmental Trauma-Responsive Training and Coaching Plan that describes in writing a plan \nand process for providing mandatory, high-quality trauma-responsive training to all CYFD \nemployees,  Designated  HSD  Employees1  and  employees  of  child-serving  agencies  that \ncontract with CYFD or HSD to provide care to Children in State Custody.  Training will \naddress the impact of trauma including its neurodevelopmental effects, implementing and \naccessing trauma-responsive supports and services, and secondary trauma.  Training will \n                                                           \n1 “Designated HSD Employees” refers to (1) Social and Community Services Coordinators, their \nsupervisors and managers, including the Behavioral Health Services Division Director; and (2) \nany HSD employee or their designee involved in care coordination activities, EPSDT services, or \ndeterminations about service utilization for Children in State Custody, including supervisory and \nmanagement level employees. \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 1a \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 62-1   Filed 03/26/20   Page 39 of 51\ncomply with professional standards and best practices in adult education, including by being \ncase-based and interactive, and including an assessment component to measure effectiveness.  \nTrauma-responsive training will consist of initial or pre-service training as well as consistent, \nongoing in-service training, mentoring, coaching, and support.  The Trauma-Responsive \nTraining and Coaching Plan will also provide for mandatory trauma-responsive training for \nResource Families and optional trauma-responsive training for Respondents. Training for \nResource Families and Respondents will be accessible both online and in person, and CYFD \nwill provide childcare during any in-person sessions if needed.  Notice of training shall be \nprovided to Resource Families and Respondents reasonably in advance of any scheduled \ntraining, and no less than 14 Days in advance of any scheduled training. Notices will state that \nchildcare will be provided and that requests for childcare must be received 48 hours prior to \nthe training, or a lesser number of hours determined by CYFD and/or HSD.  The written plan \nwill include identification of the training program or materials to be used and the number of \nhours of training to be received by each category of trainee.  The trauma-responsive training \nand coaching described in the plan must be sufficient to allow the Departments to meet their \nobligations under this Agreement.  The Co-Neutrals must approve the Trauma-Responsive \nTraining and Coaching Plan. \nTARGET OUTCOMES \n1.  Screening. By December 1, 2021, every Child in State Custody will receive the screenings \nindicated below.  CYFD and HSD will identify, and Co-Neutrals must approve, the form of \nthe Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths Crisis Assessment Tool (“CANS-CAT”) and \ncomprehensive CANS screening tools to be used.  CYFD will ensure that every Child in State \nCustody  receives  the  indicated  screenings  and  will  provide  the  results  of  the  indicated \nscreenings to HSD (through its MCOs and/or their successors).  HSD will ensure that MCOs \nand/or their successors have capacity to provide indicated screenings. \na.  Results of initial screening using the CANS-CAT will be filed with the court no less \nthan 24 hours before the child’s 10-day hearing.  If this deadline falls on a weekend or \nholiday, the screening results must be filed no less than one business day prior to the \n10-day hearing. \nb.  Comprehensive screening using a CANS-Trauma Comprehensive instrument or a \ncomprehensive CANS assessment instrument with a trauma module will be conducted \nwithin 45 Days of removal from the home.  Any child discharged from CYFD’s legal \ncustody before these screenings are conducted will be provided a referral for the \nscreenings. \nc.  Follow  up  screening  indicated  by  the  CANS-CAT,  CANS,  and/or  any  other \ninformation available to CYFD or HSD, including screening for intellectual and \ndevelopmental disabilities and/or sexual exploitation, will be conducted immediately \nwhere possible and within 10 Days of indication otherwise.  Any child discharged from \nCYFD’s legal custody before these screenings are conducted will be provided a referral \nfor them. \n \n2.  Services.  By December 1, 2022, every Child in State Custody will receive age-appropriate \ntrauma-responsive services, supports, and/or treatment to meet his or her individualized \nneeds indicated by the CANS and functional trauma assessments, beginning immediately \nwhere possible and not to exceed 10 Days after the date of the screening and/or assessment.  \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 2a \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 62-1   Filed 03/26/20   Page 40 of 51\nHSD and CYFD will work with MCOs and other entities designated to provide care \ncoordination to make sure medically necessary services are provided, documented in the \nchild’s file, and analyzed when developing plans for future care and services.  HSD and \nCYFD will expand and offer community-based, evidence-based, well-supported, and \npromising trauma-responsive services, which include mobile crisis response services, \nintensive case management, intensive home-based services, and trauma-based therapies \nincluding Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Multi-Systemic Therapy (MST), trauma-\ninformed Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Functional Family Training (FFT), and Eye \nMovement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy (EMDR).  These services will be \navailable to all Children in State Custody for whom the services are medically necessary and \nwill be available immediately where possible and within 10 Days of the determination of \nmedical necessity otherwise.   \n \n3.  Training \na.  By December 1, 2021, all CYFD employees, designated HSD employees, employees \nof child serving agencies that contract with CYFD or HSD to provide care to Children \nin State Custody, and Resource Families will receive the training identified in the \nTrauma-Responsive Training and Coaching Plan.  All Respondents will be offered the \ntrauma training identified in the Trauma-Responsive Training and Coaching Plan. \nb.  By  December  1,  2021,  all  CYFD  employees,  designated  HSD  employees,  and \nemployees of child serving agencies that contract with CYFD or HSD who provide \ncare to Children in State Custody will demonstrate through competency assessments \nand self-reporting that they have received adequate trauma-responsive training. \n \n4.  Individualized Planning Meetings. Subject to the approval of the Co-Neutrals, CYFD and \nHSD will develop and implement a process (the Individualized Planning Meeting Plan) for \nconvening an Individualized Planning Meeting team for making decisions and for delivering \nservices and supports for each Child in State Custody.  The Individualized Planning Meeting \nprocess shall be informed by Child and Family Teaming (CFT), collaborative decision-making, \nand High Fidelity Wraparound models, and shall prioritize the child’s voice and choice.  The \nprocess shall also be strengths-based, connected to natural supports, and respectful of the \nchild’s family and unique cultural heritage.  The Co-Neutrals shall not withhold approval of \nthe Individualized Planning Meeting Plan if it is reasonably calculated to achieve the Goals of \nthis Agreement.  The Individualized Planning Meeting Plan will be completed and approved \nby December 1, 2020, and fully implemented by December 1, 2022. \n \n5.  Quality Assurance, Improvement, and Evaluation.  CYFD and HSD  will create and \nimplement  a  Quality  Assurance,  Improvement,  and  Evaluation  Plan,  including  quality \nmanagement tools and measures to be used for reporting on CYFD and HSD’s capacity to meet \nthe needs of Children in State Custody, including measures for reporting on providing and \nimproving quality of care, collaborating across Departments, and for providing transparency \nand accountability.  The Plan will include: consistent definitions and terms across CYFD and \nHSD, data exchange and matching across CYFD and HSD, clarification of existing measures \nand indicators, self-assessments, metrics as indicators of system performance (including \nprocess indicators, client outcomes, and system impact), a continuous quality improvement \nprocess that provides information in real time to decision-makers, and a process for responding \nto findings from the Plan.  CYFD will develop a meaningful quality assurance process to ensure \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 3a \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 62-1   Filed 03/26/20   Page 41 of 51\nthat  training,  policy,  and  procedure  is  being  properly  utilized  and  integrated  into  daily \nprocesses.    The  Co-Neutrals  must  approve  the  Quality  Assurance,  Improvement,  and \nEvaluation Plan.  CYFD and HSD will develop the Quality Assurance, Improvement, and \nEvaluation Plan by December 1, 2020 and fully implement it by December 1, 2021. \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 4a \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 62-1   Filed 03/26/20   Page 42 of 51\nAPPENDIX B: LEAST RESTRICTIVE AND APPROPRIATE PLACEMENTS \n \nWhen assessing CYFD’s and HSD’s efforts to implement the commitments in this Appendix, the \nCo-Neutrals will consider, in addition to other data and information, the extent to which CYFD \nand HSD build a system for placing children in out-of-home care in stable, safe, appropriate, \ncommunity-based placements in the least-restrictive environment.  Children in out-of-home care \nshould have caregivers who understand their strengths and needs and are able to support them to \ngrow and heal.  Children in out-of-home placements should be in the least restrictive, most \nconnected, most family-like setting appropriate for their unique needs.  Children aged 14 and \nolder should be consulted on their express placement preferences.  Children in out-of-home \nplacements should have stable placements that meet their needs and should be protected from the \nharm caused by multiple placement moves.  Foster care should be as temporary an arrangement \nas possible, with its goal being to provide children in out-of-home placements a safe, nurturing, \nand permanent home quickly.  The Co-Neutrals will assess whether Defendants have met the \nPerformance Standard with respect to the commitments in this Appendix. \n \nIMPLEMENTATION TARGETS \n \nBy December 1, 2020, HSD and CYFD will take the following specific steps: \n \n1.  CYFD and HSD will develop a plan to (1) increase recruitment and retention of culturally \nreflective, community-based placements, with a focus on maximizing family supports and \nserving rural areas and difficult-to-place populations and (2) ensure that children in out-of-\nhome care remain in stable placement and educational settings to the maximum extent feasible \nand that any change in placement is made in the best interests of the child and consistent with \nachieving the child’s permanency goals. \n \n2.  CYFD will publish guidance prohibiting retaliation against any person, including foster \nparents, for raising concerns related to the unmet needs of Children in State Custody or their \ncaregivers.  \n \n3.  CYFD and HSD will develop and promote a warm line for Resource Families and \nRespondents who need assistance meeting the behavioral needs of the children in their \ncare.  CYFD will promote its internal Grievance Procedure for youth. CYFD will also \ndevelop a Grievance Procedure for Resource Families. \n \nTARGET OUTCOMES \n \n1.  By December 1, 2020, no child under 18 will be placed in any hotel, motel, out-of-state \nprovider, office of a contractor, or state agency office unless in extraordinary circumstances \nnecessary to protect the safety and security of the child as documented in the child’s record \nand approved by the Secretary or the Protective Services Director of CYFD.  In any such \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 5a \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 62-1   Filed 03/26/20   Page 43 of 51\nextraordinary circumstance, CYFD shall provide notice to the child’s Guardian ad Litem and \nYouth Attorney immediately where possible, and not more than 24 hours after the placement \nof the child.  Notification to the dependency court to which the child’s case is assigned must \noccur within 3 business days.  When a child is placed with an out-of-state provider, notice to \nthe child’s Guardian ad Litem, Youth Attorney, and the dependency court to which the child’s \ncase is assigned will be given prior to the move, pursuant to statute.  \n \n2.  By December 1, 2020, HSD and CYFD will conduct a joint clinical review of any out-of-state \nplacement, where the child’s out-of-state placement is not the child’s permanency plan, at least \non a monthly basis.  A CYFD caseworker known to the child will conduct in-person visits \nevery month.  Within the first 30 Days of the placement, the out-of-state Individualized \nPlanning Meeting team will develop a discharge plan which includes identification of in-state \nresources that need to be developed for the child to return to New Mexico.  The CYFD \ncaseworker will do so by working with HSD or its designee to secure services that could be \nfunded  by  Medicaid.    Individualized  Planning  Meetings,  which  may  take  place  during \nscheduled treatment team meetings for children in residential care, will be held every 30 Days \nto support the child and identify steps necessary to promote discharge.  \n \n3.  By December 1, 2021, for any child placed in a congregate care setting due to a medical \nnecessity determination that the child requires residential treatment, the finding of medical \nnecessity will be clinically reviewed every 30 Days, or more frequently as needed.  The finding \nof medical necessity must take into consideration whether community-based mental health \nservices have been or could be provided.  Individualized Planning Meetings will be held every \n30 Days to support the child and identify steps necessary to promote discharge.   \n \n4.  By December 1, 2021, any placement in a congregate care setting that is not supported by a \ndetermination of medical necessity, including placement in specialized group homes such as \nTransitional Living Placements, Maternity Group Homes, or settings for Commercial Sexual \nExploitation of Children, must be supported by a determination of the Individualized Planning \nMeeting team, including a mental health professional, that it is in the best interests of the child.  \nThe best interest determination will be reviewed by the Individualized Planning Meeting team, \nincluding a mental health professional, every 90 Days, or more frequently as needed.  If \nextraordinary circumstances require placement of a child in a shelter, CYFD will conduct an \nIndividualized Planning Team meeting within 48 hours to identify an appropriate placement \nto which to move the child and any medically necessary services needed by the child, and will \nnotify the child’s legal representative of the result of the review.     \n \n5.  By December 1, 2021, every child in out-of-home care will be in a licensed foster home \nplacement unless a current finding of medical necessity requires otherwise or an Individualized \nPlanning Meeting team determines that a non-clinical setting is in the child’s best interest. The \nfinding of medical necessity for a more restrictive setting (residential treatment or Qualified \nResidential Treatment Programs) will be reviewed every 30 Days or more frequently as needed \nand will take into consideration whether community-based mental health services and supports \nhave been or could be provided.   \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 6a \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 62-1   Filed 03/26/20   Page 44 of 51\n6.  Beginning on December 1, 2020, and on an annual basis by December 31 each year thereafter, \nthe Co-Neutrals will approve a Target Outcome for CYFD to approve a specified number of \nnew culturally reflective foster homes during the following year, and for HSD to approve a \nspecified number of new treatment foster care placements during the following year. \n \n7.  By December 1, 2022, at least 40% of children in out-of-home care will be placed with kin.  \nCYFD will use Seneca Family Finding software to attempt to identify and locate family \nmembers for every Child in State Custody within 48 hours of entering state custody.  \n \n8.  By December 1, 2022, for children under 18 in out-of-home care, the rate of moves from a \nplacement  setting  shall  not  exceed  3  moves  per  1,000  Days  in  care.    The  educational \nconsequences  of  a  change  in  placement  must  be  considered  in  all  placement  change \ndeterminations and must be discussed at Individualized Planning Meetings.  Any change in \nplacement that impacts the child’s education must be accompanied by a written plan to ensure \ncontinuity in the child’s education, including transportation and educational supports to \nminimize the impact of the transition.   \n \n9.  Of all children in care for 12-23 months at the start of a 12-month period, 40% will achieve \npermanency (reunification, adoption, or permanent guardianship) within 12 months of the \nstart of that period by December 2023.   \n \n10. CYFD Workforce Development Plan.  CYFD will create a CYFD Workforce Development \nPlan that will ensure CYFD’s workforce has adequate qualifications, expertise, skills, and \nnumbers of personnel.  The CYFD Workforce Development Plan will describe in writing the \nexpected  nature,  scope,  capacity,  and  structure  of  the  workforce  necessary  to  meet  the \nobligations described in this Agreement.  The plan will include a specific hiring plan that \nidentifies, by county, the number of staff, credentials, and training required to meet the \nobjectives identified in the CYFD Workforce Development Plan and outlines strategies to \nrecruit and retain staff. The Plan will require that all caseworkers and supervisors have \nsufficient educational credentials and/or directly relevant experience.  It will require that \nCYFD have a sufficient number of caseworkers to ensure that no caseworker will carry a case \nload of greater than the current professional standard identified by the Child Welfare League \nof America (CWLA).  It will also include sufficient numbers of staff trained and able to \nimplement ICWA guidelines using culturally responsive practices.  The Plan will describe \nspecific  strategies  to  attract  and  retain  diverse,  high-quality  staff  with  appropriate \nqualifications and skills.  Co-Neutrals must approve the CYFD Workforce Development Plan.  \nCYFD  will  develop  the  Workforce  Development  Plan  by  December  1,  2020  and  fully \nimplement it by December 1, 2021. \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 7a \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 62-1   Filed 03/26/20   Page 45 of 51\nAPPENDIX C: INDIAN CHILD WELFARE ACT \n \nWhen assessing CYFD’s and HSD’s efforts to implement the commitments in this Appendix, the \nCo-Neutrals will consider, in addition to other data and information, the extent to which CYFD \nand HSD serve Native American families, build a relationship with each of the New Mexico \nTribes and Pueblos, and comply with the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) in its letter and \nintent.  The State has an obligation to comply with ICWA and shall make every effort to ensure \nthat all Native Children and families receive appropriate support and services.  The Co-Neutrals \nwill assess whether Defendants have met the Performance Standard with respect to the \ncommitments in this Appendix. \n \nIMPLEMENTATION TARGETS \n \nBy December 1, 2020, HSD and CYFD will take the following specific steps necessary to create \na culturally responsive system of support for Native Children in State Custody: \n \n1.  CYFD and HSD will work with the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) and with \nNew Mexico Tribes and Pueblos to draft a State ICWA law that mirrors and expands upon \nthe federal version.  The drafting committee will include representatives of New Mexico \nTribes and Pueblos, representatives of Native Children, Native parents, and other caregivers \ninvolved in the child welfare system, experts on the federal ICWA, and providers of \nculturally relevant services and supports.  The drafting committee will have discretion to \ndetermine the content of the law and will consider definitions of “active efforts,” “qualified \nexpert witness,” including qualifications of for determining a “qualified expert witness,” and \ndevelopment of a pool of potential expert witnesses.  HSD and CYFD will identify and \narrange for an appropriate facilitator such as the New Mexico Department of Indian Affairs \nto convene the drafting committee to assist in drafting the law.  CYFD and HSD will actively \npromote passage of the law, including by making a positive recommendation of the bill to the \nGovernor’s Office with appropriate justification. \n \n2.  With the input of New Mexico’s Tribes and Pueblos, CYFD and HSD will develop processes \nand procedures to promote traditional interventions as first-line interventions and services, \nusing an assessment tool for Native Children in State Custody, modifications of existing \nassessment tools, or other means recommended by Native experts.  The form of the \nassessment tool or other means shall be approved by the Co-Neutrals, but the Co-Neutrals \nshall not withhold approval of the assessment tool if it is reasonably calculated to achieve the \nGoals of this Agreement.    \n \n3.  HSD and CYFD will pursue federal funding to the maximum extent allowable through \nMedicaid and IV-E funding for traditional and culturally responsive treatments, \ninterventions, and supports, including non-medicalized interventions, for Native Children in \nState Custody. \n \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 8a \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 62-1   Filed 03/26/20   Page 46 of 51\n4.  CYFD will maintain a full-time employee responsible for developing and maximizing \nculturally responsive services for Native Children in State Custody and for coordinating and \noverseeing provision of culturally responsive services to Native Children in State Custody by \nlocal staff throughout the state. \n \n5.  CYFD will develop a plan to increase recruitment and retention of Native Resource Families. \nThe plan will include identifying relatives of Native Children, as required by ICWA or the \nNew Mexico Tribe or Pueblo’s preferred placement priorities, as well as identifying other \npotential Native Resource Families.  The plan will include identification of additional \nsupports needed for Native Resource Families, including supports and services that are \nculturally responsive and are not the same as those provided to non-Native parents, as well as \nproviding assistance for families to navigate Resource Family licensing requirements.  One \nmethodology for identifying additional needed supports will be surveying former Native \nResource Families to determine why they have stopped serving as a Resource Family and \nsurveying potential Native Resource Families that did not complete the process to determine \nwhy they chose not to become a Resource Family.   \n \n6.  CYFD will work with New Mexico Tribes and Pueblos to engage in dialogue, develop \nagreements, and take any other steps necessary to help New Mexico Tribes and Pueblos \nbetter access IV-E funding to improve services for Native Children, including additional \nfunding for legal representation for New Mexico Tribes and Pueblos and Respondents. \n \n7.  CYFD and HSD will collect and analyze data sufficient to understand the characteristics and \nneeds of Native Children in State Custody and the capabilities of the State to meet those \nneeds.  The data to be collected will include (1) data about Native Children in State Custody, \nincluding tribal membership status, confirmation and correction of birth certificates, removal \nrates, and placements (including whether children are placed with relative, non-relative \nNative, or non-relative non-Native Resource Families, Treatment Foster Care, congregate \ncare, residential placement, or other out of home placement); (2) data on the demographics \nand characteristics of placements available to Native children (including Resource Families); \nand (3) data on the demographics, characteristics and services provided by treatment \nproviders available to Native Children in State Custody.  \n \n8.  CYFD and HSD will create and maintain a dedicated ICWA unit in the 2nd Judicial District \nthat includes dedicated and specially trained caseworkers, supervisors, and children’s court \nattorneys who will specialize in ICWA and act as consultants and trainers on ICWA cases. \nCYFD will work with the AOC to implement lessons learned from the ICWA unit and court \nin the 2nd Judicial District throughout the State.   \n  \nTARGET OUTCOMES \n1.  By December 1, 2021, assessments using the tool developed for Native Children in State \nCustody or other process developed per Implementation Target 2 above will be conducted \nwithin 30 Days of CYFD filing a petition for custody of a Native Child in State Custody.   \n \n2.  CYFD will work with New Mexico Tribes and Pueblos, families, and Native Children to \nidentify culturally responsive services.  HSD will develop and expand access to traditional \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 9a \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 62-1   Filed 03/26/20   Page 47 of 51\nand culturally responsive treatments, interventions, and supports.  CYFD will develop and \narrange for traditional and culturally competent interventions, which may include \ninterventions that are not medicalized and/or have not been evaluated as evidence-based, \nwell-supported, or promising.  CYFD and HSD will expand culturally relevant services that \ncan be used as an active effort to keep families intact and to avoid taking children into \ncustody.  \na.  By December 1, 2022, Individualized Planning Meetings for every Native Child in \nState Custody will address the need for traditional or culturally responsive services, \nsupports, or interventions, including non-medicalized interventions, to meet his or her \nindividualized needs as indicated by his or her assessments.  \nb.  While a family can decline CYFD’s assistance, CYFD recognizes that it has the \nresponsibility to coordinate services and ensure they are provided; \nc.  When appropriate traditional or culturally responsive services, supports or \ninterventions, including non-medicalized interventions, are identified, they will be \nprovided immediately where possible and not to exceed 10 Days after the date of \nidentifying the need, unless a longer period is necessary due to cultural traditions, \nnorms, or factors outside of CYFD’s control.  \nd.  If there is a basis for delaying the intervention as outlined under subpart c above, then \nit will be identified and communicated in writing to the Individualized Planning team \nand reviewed at subsequent meetings. \ne.  If the intervention requires involvement from the tribe or tribal community, CYFD \nwill identify the nature of the community’s involvement and the reason for any delay \nin provision of the intervention, if any, for the Individualized Planning team and it \nwill be reviewed at subsequent meetings. \n \nCYFD will make every effort to ensure that services are provided as quickly as possible with \nconsideration of the traditions and culture of the Native Child’s tribe or pueblo, as well as \nchild and family preferences. \n \nBy December 1, 2020, CYFD will develop policies to ensure that Native Children in State \nCustody receive traditional or culturally responsive services, supports, or interventions, \nincluding interventions which are non-medicalized and/or have not been evaluated as \nevidence-based, well-supported, or promising, including collecting data on the \nimplementation of the protocols.  The Co-Neutrals will approve the policies and evaluate the \nDepartment’s compliance with the policy.  The Co-Neutrals shall not withhold approval of \nthe policy if it is reasonably calculated to achieve the Goals of this Agreement.   \n \n3.  By December 1, 2020, CYFD will develop a policy to provide or ensure provision of direct \nassistance for traditional ceremonies, including arranging for all preparation and providing \npayment if needed, if Native Children want to participate. The policy will 1) provide for \nNative Children in State Custody to be presented with information about traditional \nceremonies with sufficient time to decide whether they want to participate, 2) affirmatively \nencourage participation, and 3) facilitate all necessary preparation activities.  The Co-\nNeutrals will approve the policy and evaluate the Department’s compliance with the policy.  \nThe Co-Neutrals shall not withhold approval of the policy if it is reasonably calculated to \nachieve the Goals of this Agreement.   \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 10a \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 62-1   Filed 03/26/20   Page 48 of 51\n \n4.  CYFD is committed to having Native Children in ICWA-preferred placements.  By \nDecember 1, 2020, when a Native Child is in a non-ICWA-preferred placement, the  \nplacement will be reviewed every 30 Days.  CYFD will establish protocols governing the 30-\nDay review process to include families, tribal representatives, legal representatives, and \nResource Families. The protocols will require that the aim of the placement review will be to \ndetermine what actions, services and supports will enable the child to be moved to an ICWA-\napproved placement. If State ICWA legislation is passed and is more protective than the \nfederal ICWA, a placement may meet this standard by being preferred by or consistent with \nthe State ICWA legislation. The Co-Neutrals shall approve the protocols, but the Co-Neutrals \nshall not withhold approval of the protocols if they are reasonably calculated to achieve the \nGoals of this Agreement.  The Co-Neutrals will evaluate compliance with the protocols.  \nCYFD will work with New Mexico Tribes and Pueblos to identify any tribal placement \npreferences that deviate from ICWA.  CYFD will create procedures that enhance \naccountability for ICWA placement preferences, including allowing the child’s tribe or \npueblo and extended family members to participate in ICWA-preferred placement reviews, \nIndividualized Planning Meetings and case decision making meetings.    \n \n5.  Training. CYFD will develop an ICWA training plan by December 1, 2020, and implement \nit by December 1, 2021.  ICWA trainings will be developed collaboratively with the CYFD’s \nAcademy for Training and Professional Development Team, Protective Services Tribal \nLiaison, CYFD Tribal Liaison, Tribal Advisors, and culturally responsive experts.  The \nICWA training will include specific information on the history of ICWA, historic relations \nbetween Native American people and state and national government, and the history of \nculturally insensitive social work practices.  It will also include skills development in \nworking with Native families and communities, historical trauma, engagement, cultural \nhumility and culturally responsive intervention techniques for Native American parents and \nyouth and community engagement with New Mexico Tribes and Pueblos, as well as best \npractices for ICWA.  The training will include information on New Mexico Tribes and \nPueblos, sovereignty, and jurisdictional issues.  The Co-Neutrals shall approve the ICWA \ntraining plan, but the Co-Neutrals shall not withhold approval of the training plan if it is \nreasonably calculated to achieve the Goals of this Agreement.  The Co-Neutrals will evaluate \nimplementation of the training plan. \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 11a \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 62-1   Filed 03/26/20   Page 49 of 51\nAPPENDIX D: BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES \n \nWhen assessing CYFD’s and HSD’s efforts to implement the commitments in this Appendix, \nthe Co-Neutrals will consider, in addition to other data and information, the extent to which \nCYFD and HSD structure and build a statewide, community-based mental health system that all \nchildren and families will be able to access.  A statewide system is necessary to ensure that \nChildren in State Custody and their families have prompt access to necessary services \nregardless of where they live.  These services are critical to keeping children with their families \nor in the most family-like setting possible.  This system will include a diverse and full spectrum \nof community-based services, will decrease reliance on congregate care, keep families together \nin their community to the maximum extent possible, and greatly reduce reliance on out of state \nresidential placements.  Medically necessary mental health services will be provided, in \ndescending order of preference: at home, in a family setting, or in the most home-like setting \nappropriate to a child’s needs and consistent with the Children’s Code.  The Co-Neutrals will \nassess whether Defendants have met the Performance Standard with respect to the commitments \nin this Appendix.  \n \nIMPLEMENTATION TARGETS \n \nBy December 1, 2020, HSD and CYFD will take the following specific steps necessary to create \nan effective system for delivery of community-based mental and behavioral health services—\nincluding  screening/assessment,  High  Fidelity  Wraparound  services,1  evidence-based,  well-\nsupported, or promising therapeutic treatment for children with complex trauma, intensive case \nmanagement, mobile crisis response services and intensive home-based services—to Children in \nState Custody. \n \n1.  Behavioral Health Care Workforce Development Review.  HSD and CYFD will create a \nBehavioral Health Care Workforce Development Review with the objective of supporting and \nexpanding provider capacity to provide community-based mental and behavioral health \nservices with reasonable promptness that are accessible throughout the State, and particularly \nin rural areas.  The Behavioral Health Care Workforce Development Review will describe in \nwriting the expected nature, scope, capacity, and structure of the workforce necessary to meet \nthe obligations described in this Agreement, including how HSD works with MCOs on \nincreasing  capacity  to  make  available  screening/assessment,  High  Fidelity  Wraparound \nservices, evidence-based, well-supported, or promising therapeutic treatment for children \nwith  complex  trauma,  intensive  case  management,  mobile  crisis  response  services  and \nintensive home-based services to every Child in State Custody for whom they are medically \nnecessary.  HSD will either create or require MCOs to create a specific hiring/contracting plan \nthat identifies, by county, the number of staff and credentials required to meet the objectives \nidentified in the Behavioral Health Care Workforce Development Review.  The Co-Neutrals \nmust approve the Behavioral Health Care Workforce Development Review. \n                                                           \n1 High Fidelity Wraparound services are a critical component in a well-functioning system of \ncare, ensuring children and youth with complex behavioral health needs receive care that is \nindividualized, family and youth driven, strengths-based, culturally competent, and coordinated \nacross systems, particularly for children and youth who are at risk for out of home placements.  \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 12a \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 62-1   Filed 03/26/20   Page 50 of 51\n \n2.  To  assess  need,  HSD  and  CYFD  will  define  initial  expected  service  utilization  for \nscreening/assessment, High Fidelity Wraparound services, evidence-based, well-supported, \nor  promising  therapeutic  treatment  for  children  with  complex  trauma,  intensive  case \nmanagement, mobile crisis response services and intensive home-based services. The Co-\nNeutrals must approve the methodology for predicting expected utilization of these services. \n \n3.  HSD will develop and publish reimbursement methodology, billing rates (taking into account \nvalidated  information  regarding  adequate  rates),  and  guidance  for  providers  for \nscreening/assessment, High Fidelity Wraparound services, evidence-based, well-supported, \nor  promising  therapeutic  treatment  for  children  with  complex  trauma,  intensive  case \nmanagement, mobile crisis response services and intensive home-based services, leveraging \nMedicaid whenever possible. The methodology and guidance will include provider eligibility \ncriteria as well as billing and coding procedures. \n \n4.  CYFD, with input from HSD, will adopt regulations governing medication protocols to ensure \nthat Children in State Custody are not overmedicated, while ensuring timely access to \nmedically necessary medication and treatment. The regulations will include a mandatory \nclinical review process provided by an independent mental health professional with a license \nto prescribe psychotropic medication for all children prescribed psychotropic medication \nwhile in state custody and will include guidance aimed to ensure that medication is not \nmisused as a primary response to trauma-related behaviors.  In addition, the regulations will \nrequire specific review of: 1) any use of polypharmacology; 2) dosage for all prescribed \nmedication; and 3) use of atypical anti-psychotics.  Co-Neutrals must approve the final form \nof these regulations.   \n \n5.  HSD will monitor implementation of a term in all contracts with its designees to require that \ncare coordination include identification of physical, behavioral health, and long-term care \nneeds, and providing services to address said needs, in compliance with Section 4.4 of \nCentennial Care 2.0 Managed Care Organization contracts with HSD. \n \n6.  HSD will reinstate language in its Medicaid contracts to prevent children from being rejected \nor removed from behavioral health services providers. HSD will work with providers to \nidentify and remove other administrative barriers to providing services.  \n \n7.  HSD will revise its Notice of Action and grievance protocols to require a Notice of Action be \nprovided to the child’s caregiver, legal representative, and legal custodian whenever a service \nrecommended by an Individualized Planning Meeting Team is reduced, modified, delayed, or \ndenied, or if the service or is not approved within 10 Days.    \n \n8.  HSD and CYFD will review and identify the responsibilities shared by both Departments and \ncreate a joint process for offering services and supports include screening, assessing, referring, \ntreating and providing transition services to Children in State Custody of the department, \nincluding Children in State Custody who were never removed from Respondents’ homes or \nchildren who have returned to Respondents’ homes but who remain Children in State Custody.  \nKevin S. v. Blalock et. al., 1:18-cv-00896 \nPage 13a \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896-KWR-LF   Document 62-1   Filed 03/26/20   Page 51 of 51\nThe goal of this joint process shall be to maximize each child’s access to services and to create \nunified process for offering services and supports. \n \n9.  HSD or its designees will require training through its contracts for those providing care \ncoordination  for  children  in  state  custody  who  receive  Medicaid,  consistent  with  the \nrequirements in place under Section 3.3.5 and 4.4 of the Centennial Care 2.0 MCO contracts \nwith HSD.  HSD will require this training in any and all future contracts with its designees. \n \nTARGET OUTCOMES \n \n1.  Workforce Development. HSD will work with MCOs to implement the Behavioral Health \nCare Workforce Development Review, with the objective of expanding and developing the \nstatewide workforce sufficient to implement the system for delivery of community-based \nmental and behavioral health services described in this Agreement.  \na.  By December 1, 2021, HSD will employ sufficient staff such that it has the internal \ncapacity to effectively oversee, monitor, and manage the MCOs and to oversee and \ndevelop policy and procedures related to EPSDT. \nb.  By December 1, 2021, HSD will require that MCOs have a provider network sufficient \nto meet the needs identified in the Behavioral Health Care Workforce Development \nReview and hiring plans. \n \n2.  Training.  By December 1, 2021, HSD or its designees will provide incentives for providers \nto be trained in evidence-based, well-supported, and promising trauma-responsive services, \nwhich include intensive case management, High Fidelity Wraparound services, intensive \nhome-based services, and trauma-based therapies including Dialectical Behavior Therapy \n(DBT), Multi-Systemic Therapy (MST), trauma-informed Cognitive Behavioral Therapy \n(CBT),  Functional  Family  Training  (FFT),  and  Eye  Movement  Desensitization  and \nReprocessing therapy (EMDR).  Training will comply with professional standards and best \npractices  in  adult  education,  including  by  incorporating  experiential  and  interactive \ncomponents and using evaluations to measure effectiveness. \n \n3.  Community-Based Mental and Behavioral Health Services.  By December 1, 2022, the \nfollowing services will be available to every Child in State Custody for whom they are \nmedically necessary, as indicated by the CANS and functional trauma assessments and any \nfollow up.  Services will be available immediately where possible and not to exceed 10 Days \notherwise.  \na.  High Fidelity Wraparound services \nb.  intensive case management \nc.  intensive home-based services, which include mobile crisis response services and \nevidence-based, well-supported, or promising trauma-responsive therapies such as \nDialectical  Behavior  Therapy  (DBT),  Multi-Systemic  Therapy  (MST),  trauma-\ninformed Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Functional Family Training (FFT), \nand Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy (EMDR).   \n \n4.  By December 1, 2021, every Child in State Custody will receive a comprehensive well-child \ncheckup within 30 Days of entering state custody. \nKevin S. v.

This action is brought by thirteen foster children1 and by non-profit organizations \nDisability Rights New Mexico and Native American Disability Law Center on behalf of a class of \ntrauma-impacted children in the custody of New Mexico’s child welfare system (collectively, \n“Plaintiffs”) against the state officials responsible for administering and supervising New Mexico’s \nsystems for child welfare and delivery of Medicaid services to eligible children (“Defendants”). \n2.  New Mexico has profoundly and consistently failed to fulfill the federal legal \nobligations it owes to the foster children entrusted to its care, with tragic and enduring consequences \nfor the health, safety, and life chances of a generation of the nation’s most vulnerable children.2 \nNumerous federal and state laws reflect and enforce the long-settled determination that when a child \nis unsafe in his or her home, the state has an obligation to step in and provide what all children need \nto succeed and thrive: a safe and stable place to live and the necessary support and services to meet \ntheir medical, mental health, and behavioral needs. But New Mexico’s broken system of child \nwelfare fails to provide the stability and support that children in state custody need to be safe and \nhealthy, locking New Mexico’s foster children into a vicious cycle of declining physical, mental \nand behavioral health and increasingly inappropriate, restrictive, and punitive placements and \ntreatment.  \n                                                 \n1 Plaintiffs are minor children and are referred to in this Complaint by pseudonyms. Plaintiffs have \nconcurrently filed a Motion to Proceed Using Fictitious Names. \n2  See,  e.g.,  Annie  E.  Casey  Foundation,  2018  Kids  Count  Data  Book  at  21,  available  at \nhttp://www.aecf.org/m/resourcedoc/aecf-2018kidscountdatabook-2018.pdf (ranking New Mexico \nlast in overall childhood well-being). The phrase “foster children” is used in this complaint to refer \nto children in the legal custody of New Mexico’s Children, Youth and Families Department due to \nallegations of abuse, neglect, or abandonment pursuant to NMSA 1978 § 32A-4-1 et seq.  \n  2 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 3 of 95\n3.  New Mexico’s system of child welfare has repeatedly failed federal audits, has \nconsistently fallen short of national, research-based standards for adequate levels of staffing, and is \namong the worst in the nation. Its most glaring structural deficiencies fall into three inter-connected \nareas: \n4.  First, because New Mexico lacks a system to ensure stable placement in safe and \nsupportive home environments, foster children are routinely cycled through numerous short-term \nemergency  shelters,3  foster  placements,4  residential  treatment  facilities,5  hospitals—even \novernights in state government offices—that are inappropriate, overly restrictive, and lack the \n                                                 \n3 Emergency crisis centers, also known as homeless shelters for the general youth population, are \nmeant to be short-term placements (no more than 90 days) until a long-term solution can be \narranged. Emergency crisis centers house foster children, along with homeless non-foster children, \nsome in a dorm-room setting, usually with two or three youth to a room, where the youth are free \nto come and go, subject to curfews. In practice, CYFD will cycle children through multiple \nsuccessive crisis centers throughout the state and away from their schools and communities in an \nattempt to circumvent the 90-day limit, using these shelters as placements of first resort. \n4 Treatment foster care (also referred to as therapeutic foster care) is a Medicaid funded placement \ndesigned to provide therapeutic care in a structured home environment, with treatment families who \nhave specialized training to care for children and youth with significant emotional, behavioral, or \nsocial  issues  or  medical  needs.  U.S.  DEPARTMENT  OF  HEALTH  &  HUMAN  SERVICES,  CHILD \nWELFARE INFORMATION GATEWAY, TREATMENT FOSTER CARE, https://www.childwelfare.gov/ \ntopics/outofhome/foster-care/treat-foster/. In practice, however, New Mexico’s treatment foster \nparents often do not receive sufficient training to meet their foster placements’ needs. Moreover, \ntreatment foster care is a Medicaid service that requires a finding of medical necessity. Hence by \nits nature, treatment foster care necessarily is a short-term placement designed to address a specific \nneed and children must be discharged when the child no longer needs that level of care. \n5 Residential treatment centers are high-cost placements paid for by Medicaid for foster children \nwith significant mental illnesses or behavioral problems and provide inpatient therapeutic services \nin an institutional setting that the youth are not permitted to leave. Like treatment foster care, \nresidential treatment centers require a medical necessity determination. While treatment foster care \nand residential treatment centers both were designed to treat particular mental health and behavioral \nconditions in therapeutic settings, they function in practice as increasingly punitive housing \nfacilities  for  foster  children  who  have  experienced  challenges  in  less-restrictive  placements, \nregardless of true medical necessity. In other words, if a youth “acts out” in a regular foster home, \nhe or she will be sent to a treatment foster care facility. If the youth then “acts out” in treatment \nfoster care, he or she will be sent to a residential treatment facility, without a medical determination \nto confirm such placement is appropriate. \n  3 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 4 of 95\nsupport and capacity to meet the individual needs of the children placed there. Moreover, defaulting \nto placements in institutional settings such as shelters, residential treatment centers, and hospitals \ndenies  foster  children  the  opportunity  to  develop  sustaining  relationships  with  stable,  adult \ncaretakers as surrogate parents. In an approximately two-year period, for example, Plaintiff Diana \nD. has been repeatedly transferred among at least eleven short-term, inappropriate and unsafe \nplacements,  including  emergency  crisis  shelters,  treatment  foster  care,  residential  treatment \nfacilities, and multiple psychiatric hospitals. This grim pattern is the inevitable consequence of the \nNew Mexico Children Youth and Family Department (“CYFD”) and the New Mexico Human \nServices Department’s (“HSD”) failure to recruit, license, train, and support sufficient numbers of \nappropriate foster care placements and its failure to hire, train, and support staff and service \nproviders in sufficient numbers and with appropriate expertise. CYFD’s and HSD’s failure to \nmaintain a system to ensure appropriate placements prevents children from developing stable bonds \nwith a caretaker; interrupts delivery of medical, mental, and behavioral health care; and disrupts \nschool attendance and educational attainment. In sum, Defendants’ failures harm the health, well-\nbeing, and life chances of foster children. \n5.  Second, because New Mexico lacks a functioning system to meet the medical, \nmental health, and behavioral needs of children in state custody, these children are likewise denied \naccess  to  necessary  services,  including  the  federally  mandated  medical,  mental  health,  and \nbehavioral health screenings and services provided by New Mexico’s Medicaid program to which \nvirtually all such children are entitled. CYFD and HSD must evaluate a child’s health within thirty \ndays of entering state custody and ensure a coordinated and integrated system of care in the least \nrestrictive environment. 42 U.S.C. § 622(b)(2). But children languish in state custody without \nreceiving appropriate screening, much less appropriate or consistent services.  CYFD’s and HSD’s \n  4 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 5 of 95\nfailure to implement a system capable of promptly screening, diagnosing, and providing a spectrum \nof appropriate, consistent therapeutic services in a community setting causes notable deterioration \nof the physical, mental, and behavioral health of children in state custody, leading to unnecessary \nplacement in residential facilities, often out of state, that—as CYFD and HSD have stated—are \ncostly to the state and have not been shown to be effective.6 \n6.  These systemic deficiencies are particularly devastating and legally indefensible \nbecause the very purpose of the state’s system of child welfare is to serve children who have been \nentrusted  to  state  custody  due  to  their  experience  with  tragic  traumas  such  as  child  abuse, \nabandonment, and neglect.  \n7.  Third, because New Mexico’s child welfare system has failed to implement trauma-\nsensitive practices, children in state custody are unable to access even the limited services that are \navailable. CYFD and HSD know that New Mexico foster children are highly likely to have \nexperienced complex trauma, a term that describes children’s exposure to multiple, persistent \nsources of adversity, violence, and loss, as well as the impact of this exposure. Every child entering \nthe child welfare system has, at minimum, experienced the trauma of child abuse, abandonment, or \nneglect, and separation from a caregiver. As the experiences of the individual Plaintiffs reflect, the \ntraumas to which youth in the foster system are subjected include, but are not limited to, physical, \nemotional,  and  sexual  abuse;  emotional  and  physical  neglect;  homelessness;  the  death, \n                                                 \n6 Results First: Children’s Behavioral Health, presented to the N.M. Legislative Finance Committee \nJune 7, 2017, at 33 (hereinafter “Results First”), https://www.nmlegis.gov/Entity/LFC/Documents/ \nResults_First/Results%20First%20Children%27s%20Behavioral%20Health.pdf.  For  example, \nCYFD and HSD reported that New Mexico spends $68 million a year to treat the five most \nexpensive child behavioral health disorders. Estimates show that New Mexico loses $8 billion in \nlifetime earnings for children currently affected by substance abuse and psychological disorders. \n  5 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 6 of 95\nincarceration, or deportation of a parent; domestic violence; and parental substance abuse, mental \nillness, or involvement in sex work.  \n8.  Publicly available data show that foster children in New Mexico are particularly \nlikely to have experienced multiple forms of trauma prior to entering state custody. New Mexico \nhas the highest rate of childhood trauma exposure in the country, with 18% of all children in the \nstate having  experienced three or more significant traumatic experiences.7 New Mexico has \nrepeatedly been ranked last in the country in overall child well-being and currently has the nation’s \nhighest rate of child poverty.8 \n9.  Medical and social science have firmly established that such exposure to complex \ntrauma  significantly  impacts  brain  activity,  function,  and  development,  particularly  in  the \ndeveloping brain of a child or young person. When unaddressed, the neurobiological effects of \ntrauma exposure often result in predictable changes to numerous essential functions and life \nactivities  including  behavior,  emotional  self-regulation,  concentration,  sleep,  and  cognition. \nChildren and young people in state custody who are affected by trauma require accommodations in \nthe form of system-wide, trauma-sensitive policies and practices in order to access the child welfare \nand Medicaid services and benefits to which they are entitled. As administrators of state agencies \ncharged  with  protecting  the  health  and  safety  of  children  who  have  experienced  abuse, \nabandonment, and neglect, CYFD and HSD have an obligation to establish and maintain a system \nof care that anticipates and is capable of meeting the needs of the children for whom the system is \nbuilt. But New Mexico’s fractured system of child welfare lacks even the rudimentary elements of \n                                                 \n7 The Prevalence of  Adverse Childhood Experiences, Nationally, By State, and By Race or \nEthnicity, CHILD TRENDS,  Feb.  12,  2018,  https://www.childtrends.org/publications/prevalence-\nadverse-childhood-experiences-nationally-state-race-ethnicity.  \n8 2018 Kids Count Data Book, supra note 2, at 21, 26. \n  6 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 7 of 95\na trauma-informed system of care, elements that are necessary to ensure meaningful access to \nappropriate placements and delivery of medical, mental, and behavioral health services.  \n10.  Worse  yet, New  Mexico’s child welfare practices systematically  re-traumatize \nvulnerable children. The predictable result of New Mexico’s failure to recruit an adequate number \nof foster care parents has been to subject children to a series of temporary placements in which any \nbonds they can form with caregivers are promptly broken. Inadequate placement options result in \nchildren being situated in overly restrictive environments, where they may suffer additional trauma \nfrom the effects of restraint, seclusion, or even violence. Compounding the trauma, New Mexico \nhas failed to adequately train its staff and foster parents on childhood trauma or to help them in \ndealing with the secondary trauma that they themselves often suffer. Ill-prepared to understand and \nrespond to trauma, those on the front lines of New Mexico’s child welfare system may inadvertently \nsubject children in their care to additional trauma. \n11.   Federal and state laws recognize the state’s obligation to safeguard the rights, \nhealth, and well-being of children in state custody who, by definition, have no parent or guardian \ncapable of advocating on their behalf. Yet CYFD and HSD have repeatedly shown disregard for \nand deliberate indifference to this fundamental duty, at tragic cost to the health, well-being, and life \nchances of the children in CYFD custody.  \na.  For children who have experienced complex trauma that substantially limits \nmajor life activities, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title II of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) require CYFD and HSD to ensure \nmeaningful access to the public benefits, including the child welfare and Medical \nbenefits, to which these children are entitled. Yet CYFD and HSD operate \n  7 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 8 of 95\nsystems that fail to reasonably accommodate the impact of complex trauma, and \neven re-traumatize children and inflict further harm. \nb.  To  provide  meaningful  access  to  the  child  welfare  system  and  the  state’s \nMedicaid program, CYFD and HSD must have a system for addressing the needs \nof children with disabilities who are impacted by complex trauma by providing \ntrauma-sensitive approaches and training that have been shown to mitigate the \neffects of trauma. CYFD and HSD must also avoid repeated transfers of children \namong inappropriate facilities. These transfers subject children to new traumas, \nworsen their conditions, and further limit their ability to access the foster care \nand Medicaid systems. CYFD and HSD must also offer adequate medical, \nmental, and behavioral health screening, treatment, and monitoring to avoid \nexacerbating the effects of past trauma (including any trauma resulting from \nCYFD’s or HSD’s own acts) in order for these children to have meaningful \naccess to the state’s foster care and Medicaid services. \nc.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title II of the ADA also require that \nchildren be placed in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs. But \nCYFD and HSD frequently violate this requirement by administering a system \nthat places children in unduly restrictive residential treatment facilities rather \nthan appropriate community-based placements.  \nd.  The Fourteenth Amendment’s Substantive Due Process Clause imposes a \nduty on state officials to keep children in foster care reasonably safe from harm. \nInstead, CYFD’s and HSD’s failure to implement a trauma-informed system that \nensures appropriate placements and delivery of medical, mental health, and \n  8 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 9 of 95\nbehavioral health services threatens the health, safety, and welfare of children in \nCYFD’s and HSD’s custody. \ne.  The Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq., requires HSD, as the single state \nagency designated to administer New Mexico’s Medicaid program, to arrange \nfor early screening and diagnostic services that would determine the existence \nof physical or mental illnesses or behavioral health conditions, to do so with \nreasonable promptness, to arrange for necessary medical, mental, and behavioral \nhealth services, and to inform eligible children of these available services. But \nCYFD and HSD have failed to create a system of care capable of assessing the \nneeds of children in the child welfare system and delivering appropriate services. \nf.  The Indian Child Welfare Act (“ICWA”), 25 U.S.C. § 1915(a), (b), sets forth \nstandards to meet the needs of children covered by ICWA, including that Native \nchildren in foster care be placed in the least restrictive setting that approximates \na family and that they receive placements consistent with ICWA’s placement \npreferences. 25 U.S.C. 1915(b). But CYFD and HSD have failed to maintain a \nsystem capable of complying with these ICWA obligations, resulting in, among \nother problems, the cycling of Native children in custody through multiple, non-\npreferred placements. \n12.  CYFD and HSD know that their broken child welfare system is inflicting harm on \nthe children in its care, and they also know how to fix it. Section VII of this Complaint catalogues \nrepeated acknowledgments by CYFD and HSD that New Mexico’s system of child welfare is \nfailing to meet the needs of children in its custody, failing to meet federal standards, deteriorating \nin performance, and causing devastating harm to foster children across the state.  \n  9 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 10 of 95\n13.  CYFD  and  HSD  have  also  acknowledged  that  evidence-based,  high-quality \nsolutions are available; namely, a trauma-informed system of care capable of supporting and \nhealing foster children who have experienced abuse, abandonment, and neglect. Experts agree that \nsuch a system must include the following core elements: (1) building human capital, including \nsufficient numbers of case workers, foster parents, and mental health professionals with appropriate \nexpertise and training; (2) screening for trauma and prompt provision of appropriate, adequate, and \ncoordinated medical, mental health, and behavioral health services; (3) monitoring a child’s health \nand treatment; (4) ensuring appropriate placements and placement supports; and (5) implementing \na wraparound model that facilitates collaboration among parties responsible for care and service \nprovision, an individualized planning process for each child, and a focus on sustaining relationships. \n14.  Because New Mexico has failed to comply with its statutory and constitutional \nobligations, and because that failure has inflicted enormous harm on the Plaintiff-children and other \nchildren who are similarly situated, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that this Court order implementation \nof a trauma-informed care system for New Mexico’s trauma-impacted foster care children. \n \nPARTIES \nA.

They bring this case on behalf of a class \nof trauma-impacted children currently in the custody of New Mexico’s child welfare system to \nensure that New Mexico’s state officials responsible for administering the child welfare system \nfulfill their federal legal obligations.  \n  10 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 11 of 95\n16.  Plaintiff Kevin S. is a Latino fourteen-year-old from Bernalillo County. He \nentered CYFD custody in 2009 due to physical abuse, sexual abuse, and neglect. Kevin S. \nreturned to his mother’s custody in 2013. In 2016, his mother requested he be placed back in \nCYFD custody. Kevin S.’s mother was previously missing and is not a consistent presence in \nKevin S.’s life. Kevin S. likes skateboarding, riding his bike, and listening to all kinds of music, \nincluding rap and country. Kevin S. wants to attend college, where he hopes to play basketball or \nfootball. \n17.  Kevin S. is enrolled in Medicaid. \n18.  Kevin S. has experienced multiple forms of trauma, including repeated childhood \nsexual abuse by his mothers’ partners, physical abuse, exposure to domestic violence, neglect, and \nseparation from a caregiver.  \n19.  Kevin S. has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar I, insomnia, \nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder, reactive attachment disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation \ndisorder, borderline intellectual functioning, and learning disorders. Kevin S. has difficulty making \ndecisions, planning, communicating, focusing, sleeping, understanding cues and communications \nfrom others, and sitting still. As a result of his exposure to repeated and sustained trauma, Kevin S. \nsometimes experiences behavioral challenges, such as periodic outbursts. \n20.  Despite his diagnoses and exposure to repeated and sustained trauma, Kevin S. has \nnot received adequate mental and behavioral health services to which he is entitled through \nMedicaid while in CYFD custody. From 2009 to 2013, Kevin S. received insufficient services and \ntreatment, and his behavioral challenges have continued to escalate. In 2013, Kevin S. was returned \nto his mother who, unable to manage his escalating behavior, sent him to a residential treatment \ncenter in Texas for two years. Since he reentered CYFD custody in 2016, he has continued to \n  11 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 12 of 95\nreceive insufficient treatment. Across placements, he has received only phone counseling with his \nmother, inadequate counseling, or no counseling at all.  \n21.  CYFD has cycled Kevin S. through at least eleven placements during his two times \nin state custody. When he entered the child welfare system for the second time in September 2016, \nat age twelve, Kevin S. was placed in an emergency youth shelter for ages sixteen to twenty-one \nfor approximately one week. After that, he spent two nights sleeping in the CYFD office, which \nhas neither a formal sleeping space nor a shower. Due to the fact that CYFD staff are not equipped \nto securely monitor children in the office overnight, Kevin S. was able to run away and was found \ndodging in and out of traffic. CYFD then sent Kevin S. to a residential treatment center in Colorado, \nwhere he was repeatedly harmed by both staff and other residents. Kevin S. was restrained multiple \ntimes a week for substantial periods of time, sometimes for an entire hour, by staff. He was also \nrepeatedly harmed by other children at the center, including receiving black eyes and other facial \nwounds. Even though CYFD received multiple incident reports detailing how Kevin S. had been \nrepeatedly harmed by both staff and other residents, CYFD kept him at this placement for a year. \nDue to CYFD’s inability to secure a single placement in New Mexico, CYFD subsequently sent \nKevin S. to another out-of-state residential treatment center in Utah. Since Kevin S. arrived at the \nUtah facility in September of 2017, he has been cycled through three different facilities within the \ncenter. Even though Kevin S. has been in this placement for months, his CYFD Permanency \nPlanning Worker has still not visited him.  \n22.  Kevin S. brings this action through his Next Friend Bette Fleishman. \n23.  Plaintiff  Chris  W.  is  an  African-American  fourteen-year-old  from  Torrance \nCounty. He entered CYFD custody in April 2016 when his mom died of asthma. Chris W.’s father \n  12 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 13 of 95\nhas been in and out of prison and is currently incarcerated. He loves boxing and playing musical \ninstruments. His goal is to be reunited with his two brothers and to have a home. \n24.  Chris W. is enrolled in Medicaid. \n25.  Chris W. has experienced multiple forms of trauma, including the death of a parent, \nincarceration of a parent, parental substance abuse, and separation from a caregiver. \n26.  Chris  W.  sometimes  experiences  behavioral  challenges,  including  outbursts. \nChris W.  has  difficulty  making  decisions,  planning,  communicating,  focusing,  sleeping,  and \nunderstanding cues and communications from others. He has been diagnosed with post-traumatic \nstress disorder, behavioral dysregulation, oppositional defiant disorder, intermittent explosive \ndisorder, and additional trauma-related disorders, among other diagnoses. \n27.  Despite his exposure to repeated and sustained trauma and his diagnoses, Chris W. \nhas not received adequate medical, mental, and behavioral health services to which he is entitled \nthrough Medicaid while in CYFD custody. Chris W. did not receive any individual therapy until he \nhad been in CYFD custody for nearly four months. Two years into custody, Chris W. has still not \nbeen provided with grief counseling, even though he was very close to his mother and her death \nwas the cause of his entry into CYFD custody.  \n28.  CYFD has cycled Chris W. through at least nine placements in the two years since \nhe entered CYFD’s custody. Chris W. and his two brothers were initially placed together with a \nfoster family in Edgewood, but when CYFD and HSD failed to provide any supports for his foster \nparents, they requested that Chris W. be removed. CYFD separated Chris W. from his siblings and \ncycled him through several placements, including another foster home, multiple short-term shelters, \nand a residential treatment center. Chris W. stayed at the residential treatment center for only a few \nmonths and was provided with inadequate services. He was blamed for his lack of response to \n  13 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 14 of 95\ninadequate services, repeatedly restrained, and forced to move from one section of the center to \nanother almost every night for months. In the two months after he left the residential treatment \ncenter, Chris W. was cycled through four placements, including multiple short-term youth shelters \nin Taos and Albuquerque and a treatment foster home in Las Cruces. When the treatment foster \nhome notified CYFD that it was going to discharge Chris W. due to behavioral issues, CYFD could \nnot identify a single placement in New Mexico that would accept Chris W. Chris W. ran away and \nwent missing for nearly a month. After Chris W. was found, only one placement in New Mexico, a \nresidential treatment center in Albuquerque, accepted his application for placement. Within a month \nhe was thrown out of that facility, housed in a juvenile detention center and is currently out of state \nin a treatment center in Arizona. \n29.  Chris W. brings this action through his Next Friend Bette Fleishman. \n30.  Plaintiff Jennifer H. is a bi-racial 17-year-old from Socorro County who first \nentered CYFD custody in May of 2014 due to emotional abuse by her grandmother. In August of \n2014, Jennifer H. was returned to her grandmother, who then asked that she be placed back in \nCYFD custody in September of 2016. Jennifer H.’s father is deceased, and her mother does not \nhave a consistent presence in Jennifer H.’s life.  \n31.  Jennifer H. is enrolled in Medicaid. \n32.  Jennifer H. has experienced multiple forms of trauma, including emotional abuse, \nalleged sexual abuse, death of a parent, and separation from a caregiver.  \n33.  Jennifer H. sometimes experiences behavioral challenges, including running away. \nJennifer H. has difficulty making decisions, planning, communicating, focusing, sleeping, and \nunderstanding cues and communications from others. She has been diagnosed with post-traumatic \nstress disorder, depression, anxiety, and oppositional defiant disorder.  \n  14 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 15 of 95\n34.  Despite her exposure to repeated and sustained trauma and her diagnoses, Jennifer \nH. has not received adequate medical, mental, and behavioral health services to which she is entitled \nthrough Medicaid while in CYFD custody. Although a psychological evaluation stated that she \nneeded targeted analytic behavior therapy and structured peer interactions, CYFD has repeatedly \nplaced her in unstructured environments that have resulted in her running away. Jennifer H.’s \ntherapist indicated that she needs an attachment model and trauma-informed services. \n35.  CYFD has cycled Jennifer H. through at least nine placements since she entered \nCYFD custody in 2016, including a shelter and multiple residential treatment centers, treatment \nfoster care placements, multiple foster homes, and children’s psychiatric centers. In one foster \nhome, Jennifer H. alleged she was the victim of sexual abuse from her foster father. After she \nalleged sexual abuse, CYFD was unable to identify a single placement that would accept Jennifer \nH. CYFD’s “solution” was to remove Jennifer H. from New Mexico and send her to a residential \ntreatment center approximately one thousand miles away in Missouri. By cycling Jennifer H. \nthrough numerous facilities and ultimately transferring her across the country, CYFD and HSD \nhave prevented Jennifer H. from receiving consistent care or forming a stable relationship with a \ntherapist or foster parent, and have inflicted additional trauma on Jennifer H. \n36.  Jennifer H. brings this action through her Next Friend Liz McGrath.  \n37.  Plaintiff Diana D. is a sixteen-year-old from San Juan County who is enrolled with \nthe Navajo Nation. She is a child covered by the Indian Child Welfare Act (“ICWA”). In particular, \nbecause Diana D. is enrolled with the Navajo Nation, she meets the definition of an “Indian child” \nunder ICWA. See 25 U.S.C. § 1903(4).  \n38.  For most of Diana D.’s life, her mother has struggled with substance abuse and \nchronic homelessness. As a result, Diana D. has spent much of her life in a shelter for homeless \n  15 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 16 of 95\nyouth in Farmington, New Mexico. Diana D. entered CYFD custody in 2016. Diana D.’s mother \nreportedly continues to struggle with substance abuse and homelessness. Her father has been absent \nmost of her life and his location is unknown. Diana D. enjoys watching movies, playing the clarinet, \ndrawing, writing poetry, and reading mystery books.  \n39.  Diana D. is enrolled in Medicaid. \n40.  Diana D. has experienced multiple forms of trauma, including substance abuse and \nneglect by her mother, sexual abuse by an older brother, chronic homelessness, consistent bullying \nat school, and separation from a caregiver.  \n41.  As a result of the repeated and sustained trauma that Diana D. has experienced, \nDiana D. has trouble regulating her emotions, making decisions, focusing, interpreting cues from \nothers, sleeping, eating, accepting change, and forming trusting relationships with peers or adults. \nDiana D. has difficulty focusing because she frequently ruminates on the neglect she experienced \ngrowing up as well as her mother’s substance abuse and homelessness. She feels guilt and shame \nthat her two older sisters had to care for her because of their absent mother, and she blames herself \nfor her siblings’ entry into CYFD custody. She has great difficulty communicating about her \nexperiences with abuse and neglect and sometimes denies them. During her time in CYFD custody, \nDiana D. has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation \ndisorder, recurrent major depressive disorder with severe psychotic symptoms, bipolar 1, an eating \ndisorder,  complex  neurodevelopmental  trauma,  and  borderline  personality  traits.  A  recent \nneuropsychological evaluation suggested that Diana D. may have schizoaffective disorder, although \nher current treating psychiatrist has ruled the disorder out at this time due to her age and the complex \ntrauma she has experienced. In June 2018, her treating psychiatrist said her current diagnoses are: \nPTSD, complex neurodevelopmental trauma, depression and borderline personality traits.  \n  16 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 17 of 95\n42.  Despite her diagnoses and exposure to repeated and sustained trauma, Diana D. has \nnot received adequate medical, mental, and behavioral health services to which she is entitled \nthrough Medicaid while in CYFD custody. She did not receive any services until she had been in \nCYFD custody for over a month, and she waited over a year and a half for a neuropsychological \nevaluation. She finally received the neuropsychological evaluation in May 2018. Nor has Diana D. \nbeen provided with continuity of care; despite her known serious emotional and mental health \nneeds, Diana D. has gone weeks at a time without any services, and had three different therapists \nwithin the first two months of her most recent residential treatment center placement. Within a one-\nyear period, she has been prescribed at least nine different psychiatric medications by physicians at \nsix placements and additional medications to address medication-induced symptoms, including \nCogentin for medication-induced tics. Currently, Diana D. is taking Wellbutrin for depression and \nmood, Seroquel for PTSD and mood, Prazosin for PTSD and nightmares, and Benadryl to help her \nsleep at night. Diana D. recently asked for an increase in her Prazosin to help her sleep because her \nnightmares are worsening. \n43.  Since Diana D. entered CYFD custody in October 2016, CYFD has cycled her \nthrough at least eleven placements, including a crisis shelter, various hospitals, a treatment foster \ncare, and residential treatment centers. In violation of ICWA’s list of preferential placements, none \nof CYFD’s placements for Diana D. have been with a Navajo foster family or other Native \nAmerican care provider. Diana D. is currently ready to discharge from her residential treatment \ncenter. But because CYFD has not identified a placement for her, she remains placed in an overly \nrestrictive setting.  Diana D. is experiencing increased  anxiety about her discharge from the \nresidential treatment center and where she will be placed next. \n  17 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 18 of 95\n44.  Due to CYFD’s failure to provide stability and appropriate medical, mental, and \nbehavioral health services to which she is entitled through Medicaid, Diana D.’s mental health has \nnotably  deteriorated.  When  Diana  D.  entered  CYFD  custody,  she  cracked  jokes,  enjoyed \nsocializing, was open and communicative with her Youth Attorney and participated actively in team \ntreatment meetings. After nearly two years in CYFD custody, Diana D. is mostly uncommunicative \nin team treatment meetings and avoids speaking of her past. Due to the failure to address the impact \nof trauma on Diana D.’s health, she has experienced behavioral challenges which have resulted in \nher removal from placements and further disruption of her medical, mental, and behavioral health \nservice. This has prevented her from forming a stable relationship with a foster parent. \n45.  Diana D. also has not received adequate, continuous, and timely dental care. Diana \nD. received braces when she was first placed in Albuquerque, but when she was moved to \nFarmington, she was not provided an orthodontist. As a result, Diana D. suffered from broken \nbraces cutting her mouth for over six months. To date, upon information and belief, Diana D. has \nonly seen the orthodontist twice; her residential treatment center failed to transport her for one \nappointment and took her to the wrong provider on another occasion. Diana D. only recently saw \nher orthodontist to get her upper braces maintained.  \n46.  Due to multiple placements, placements with inadequate educational opportunities, \nand CYFD’s failure to inform placements of Diana D.’s special education needs, Diana D.’s \neducation has suffered. Diana D. did not earn a single high school credit for months at one of her \nplacements, a residential treatment center. At her current placement, another residential treatment \ncenter, Diana D. was provided with limited instruction in a basement because she was not accepted \ninto the facility’s charter school, which uses a lottery system. Diana D. received 5.5 high school \ncredits as a ninth grader. Even though this instruction is provided on the grounds of the residential \n  18 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 19 of 95\ntreatment center, Diana D. is subject to a daily “blanket search”: every day after school, she is \nrequired to strip down to her underwear behind a blanket so that her clothes can be searched before \nreturning to her unit. In addition to being deprived of an adequate school setting, it is unclear \nwhether Diana D. is being provided with special education services. Diana D. was previously \nidentified as needing special education services as a student with an emotional disturbance, but \nCYFD had failed to ensure that Diana D. had an individualized education plan (IEP) in place. \nAlthough Diana D. has been at her current residential treatment center since November 2017, \nCYFD only recently notified Diana D.’s attorney that the center would be holding an IEP meeting. \nDiana D. is currently being educated in a segregated classroom at the residential treatment center. \nIt is unclear who made this decision or why.    \n47.  According to her residential treatment center educational records, Diana D. had an \nIEP meeting in May 2018, but it does not appear her Youth Attorney or CYFD was invited. The \nIEP lists her previous treatment foster care parent as her legal guardian, not CYFD. The IEP is \nlargely blank and does not contain a single signature on the meeting participant page.  \n48.  Diana D. brings this action through her Next Friend Ernestina R. Cruz. \n49.  Plaintiff  Brian  J.  is  a  Latino  thirteen-year-old  from  Bernalillo  and  Valencia \nCounties. He entered CYFD custody in May 2017 with his two brothers after a CYFD safety plan \nfailed to prevent them from being physically abused. His father has been incarcerated for the \nmajority of the past ten years as a result of multiple domestic violence convictions for abusing Brian \nJ., his brothers, and their mother. Brian J. enjoys going to the pool with his brothers and friends.  \n50.  Brian J. is enrolled in Medicaid. \n  19 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 20 of 95\n51.  Brian J. has experienced multiple forms of trauma, including physical abuse by \nmultiple family members, exposure to domestic violence, living with a caregiver with untreated \nmental health challenges, and separation from a caregiver due to incarceration. \n52.  As a result of sustained and repeated exposure to trauma, Brian J. has difficulty \nconcentrating,  responding  appropriately  to  redirection,  self-regulating  emotionally,  and \nunderstanding and complying with directives. Brian J. has also been diagnosed with attention-\ndeficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, specific learning disorder (with moderate to severe \nimpairment in reading, written expression, and arithmetic), adjustment disorder with anxiety, \nsibling relational problems, and borderline intellectual functioning.  \n53.  Despite his exposure to repeated and sustained trauma and his diagnoses, Brian J. \nhas not received adequate medical, mental, and behavioral health services to which he is entitled \nthrough Medicaid while in CYFD custody. Brian J. did not receive a comprehensive psychological \nevaluation until he had been in custody for eleven months. This evaluation recommended that Brian \nJ. meet with a child psychiatrist for a medication evaluation, but none has been provided. The only \nmental health support that Brian J. received during his entire first year in CYFD custody was a few \nweeks of therapy that Brian J.’s aunt secured without the assistance of CYFD. CYFD failed to \nfollow up on Brian J.’s needed services and he was not re-enrolled in counseling for several months. \n54.  CYFD has cycled Brian J. through five placements since he entered CYFD custody \napproximately sixteen months ago. Due to the absence of placements in Brian J.’s hometown, he \nand his brothers were first sent to a foster home approximately one hour away. After three weeks, \nwith no prior notice to their Guardian ad Litem, the brothers were moved over two hundred miles \naway to a youth shelter in Farmington, New Mexico, where they stayed for approximately three \nweeks. Due to CYFD’s failure to secure a placement closer to the boys’ mother and failure to \n  20 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 21 of 95\nprovide adequate transportation, they were unable to have any visits with their mother while they \nstayed in Farmington. CYFD then placed the boys with their paternal aunt near the first foster \nplacement. Because Brian J. did not receive adequate mental or behavioral health services and his \naunt did not receive adequate foster parent support, his aunt requested multiple times that Brian J. \nbe removed on an emergency basis. Due to CYFD’s delay in appropriately responding to this \nrequest and failure to identify any appropriate and safe alternative placement, CYFD separated \nBrian J. from his siblings and placed him with his mother in Valencia County, over the objection \nof his Guardian ad Litem that this placement would be detrimental to Brian J.’s safety and well-\nbeing. While Brian J. was placed with his mother, CYFD failed to provide Brian J. and his mother \nwith appropriate in-home supports and family counseling services to address both of their mental \nhealth needs. After about seven weeks with his mother, Brian J. was removed again and placed in \na runaway youth shelter in Albuquerque, where he stayed for ten weeks. CYFD did not identify an \nin-state therapeutic placement option for Brian J. He was accepted into residential treatment in \nUtah. With no appropriate in state therapeutic placement options, Brian J. was placed at home with \nhis mother again.  \n55.  As a result of the denial of appropriate medical, mental, and behavioral health \nservices and a stable placement while in CYFD custody, Brian J.’s behavior deteriorated. Brian J. \nexhibited positive behaviors at his first placement but, due to the denial of necessary services, he \nbegan to exhibit defiance, physical aggression, violent outbursts, and a lack of age-appropriate \nbehavioral controls. Brian J.’s behavioral changes resulted in multiple school suspensions. CYFD \nalso failed to ensure that Brian J., who has had an IEP for years, was provided special education \nsupport. For multiple months, CYFD made no attempt to determine his educational needs.  \n56.  Brian J. brings this action through his Next Friend Matthew Bernstein.  \n  21 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 22 of 95\n57.  Plaintiff  Elliot  J.  is  a  Latino  fourteen-year-old  from  Bernalillo  and  Valencia \nCounties. He entered CYFD custody in May 2017 with his two brothers after a CYFD safety plan \nfailed to prevent them from being physically abused. His father has been incarcerated for the \nmajority of the past ten years as a result of multiple domestic violence convictions for abusing Elliot \nJ., his brothers, and their mother. Elliot J. enjoys going to school and his favorite subject is math.  \n58.  Elliot J. is enrolled in Medicaid. \n59.  Elliott J. has experienced multiple forms of trauma, including physical abuse by \nmultiple family members, exposure to domestic violence, living with a caregiver with untreated \nmental health challenges, and separation from a caregiver due to incarceration. \n60.  As a result of sustained and repeated exposure to trauma, Elliot J. sometimes exhibits \nbehavioral challenges, including outbursts, and he has tried to run away. Elliot J. has difficulty \nregulating  his  emotions,  concentrating,  staying  engaged,  expressing  himself  verbally,  and \nexhibiting age-appropriate behavioral controls. Elliot J. has also been diagnosed with attention-\ndeficit/hyperactivity  disorder,  an  intellectual  development  disorder,  language  disorder  with \nspeech/language  impairment,  unspecified  neurodevelopmental  disorder,  sibling  relational \nproblems, and parent-child relational problems. He takes prescribed medication for ADHD. \n61.  Despite his exposure to repeated and sustained trauma and his diagnoses, Elliot J. \nhas not received adequate medical, mental, and behavioral health services to which he is entitled \nthrough Medicaid while in CYFD custody. Elliot J. did not receive a comprehensive psychological \nevaluation until he had been in CYFD’s custody for eleven months. The only mental health support \nthat Elliot J. received during his entire first year in CYFD custody was a few weeks of therapy that \nElliot J.’s aunt secured without the assistance of CYFD.

The new therapy was \nalso secured by Elliot J.’s aunt without the assistance of CYFD.  \n62.  CYFD has cycled Elliot J. through four placements since he entered CYFD’s \ncustody in May 2017. Due to the absence of placements in Elliot J.’s hometown, he and his brothers \nwere first sent to a foster home approximately one hour away. Due to inadequate services, support, \nand supervision at this placement, Elliot J. experienced significant behavioral challenges and \nattempted to run away. After three weeks, with no prior notice to their Guardian ad Litem, the \nbrothers were moved over two hundred miles away to a youth shelter in Farmington, New Mexico, \nwhere they stayed for approximately three weeks. Due to CYFD’s failure to secure a placement \ncloser to the boys’ mother and failure to provide adequate transportation, they were unable to have \nany visits with their mother while they stayed in Farmington. CYFD then placed the boys with their \npaternal aunt near their first foster placement. Due to insufficient support by CYFD, the paternal \naunt chose to stop serving as a foster parent after ten and a half months as the brothers’ placement, \nand Elliot J. and his brother Michael J. were removed from her home and placed back with their \nmother.  \n63.  CYFD also failed to ensure that Elliot J., who has had an IEP for years, was provided \nspecial education support. For several months, CYFD made no attempt to determine his educational \nneeds. \n64.  Elliot J. brings this action through his Next Friend Feliz Rael. \n65.  Plaintiff Michael J. is a twelve-year-old Latino child from Bernalillo and Valencia \nCounties. He entered CYFD custody in May 2017 with his two brothers after a CYFD safety plan \nfailed to prevent them from being physically abused. His father has been incarcerated for the \nmajority of the past ten years as a result of multiple domestic violence convictions for abusing \n  23 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 24 of 95\nMichael J., his brothers, and their mother. Michael J. enjoys going to school and his favorite subject \nis math.  \n66.  Michael J. is enrolled in Medicaid. \n67.  Michael J. has experienced multiple forms of trauma, including physical abuse by \nmultiple family members, exposure to domestic violence, living with a caregiver with untreated \nmental health challenges, and separation from a caregiver due to incarceration. \n68.  As a result of sustained and repeated exposure to trauma, Michael J. struggles with \nself-confidence  and  task-avoidance.  He  also  avoids  disclosing  abuse  in  order  to  not  disrupt \nplacements. Michael J. has been diagnosed with adjustment disorder, sibling relational problems, \nparent-child relational problems, and specific learning disorders with impairments in written \nexpression and arithmetic. \n69.  Despite his diagnoses and exposure to repeated and sustained trauma, Michael J. has \nnot received adequate medical, mental, and behavioral health services to which he is entitled \nthrough  Medicaid  while  in  CYFD  custody.  Michael  J.  did  not  receive  a  comprehensive \npsychological evaluation until he had been in custody for eleven months. This evaluation noted an \nadequate prognosis for Michael J., if provided with “ample support and guidance.” CYFD has failed \nto provide this. The only mental health support that Michael J. received during his entire first year \nin CYFD custody was a few weeks of therapy that Michael J.’s aunt secured without the assistance \nof CYFD. CYFD failed to follow-up on Michael J.’s needed services, and he was not re-enrolled \nin counseling for four months. The new therapy was also secured by Michael J.’s aunt without the \nassistance of CYFD.  \n70.  CYFD has cycled Michael J. through four placements since he entered CYFD \ncustody in May 2017. Due to the absence of placements in Michael J.’s hometown, he and his \n  24 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 25 of 95\nbrothers were first sent to a foster home approximately one hour away. After three weeks, with no \nprior notice to their Guardian ad Litem, the brothers were moved over two hundred miles away to \na shelter in Farmington, New Mexico, where they stayed for approximately three weeks. Due to \nCYFD’s failure to secure a placement closer to the boys’ mother and failure to provide adequate \ntransportation,  they  were  unable  to  have  any  visits  with  their  mother  while  they  stayed  in \nFarmington. CYFD then placed the boys with their paternal aunt near the first foster placement. \nDue to insufficient support by CYFD, the paternal aunt chose to stop serving as a foster parent after \nten and a half months as the brothers’ placement, and Michael J. and his brother Elliot J. were \nremoved from her home and placed back with their mother.  \n71.  CYFD also failed to ensure that Michael J., who has had an IEP for years, was \nprovided special education support, and CYFD made no attempt to determine his educational needs \nfor several months. \n72.  Michael J. brings this action through his Next Friend Feliz Rael. \n73.  Plaintiff Olivia L. is a thirteen-year-old Hispanic child from Bernalillo County. She \nentered CYFD custody for the second time in 2016 due to sexual abuse by her mother’s partners \nand physical abuse and neglect by her mother. Olivia L. and her twin also were in CYFD custody \nin 2012. Her father is deceased. Olivia L. and her three siblings are all in CYFD custody.  \n74.  Olivia L. is enrolled in Medicaid. \n75.  Olivia L. has experienced multiple forms of trauma, including sexual and physical \nabuse, multiple rapes, neglect, death of a parent and separation from caregivers. \n76.  As a result of repeated and sustained trauma, Olivia L. experiences severe and \nchronic flashbacks and self-harming behaviors, including cutting. Olivia L. has difficulty sleeping \nand frequently wakes up in the middle of the night crying. She also has difficulty making decisions, \n  25 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 26 of 95\nconcentrating, regulating her emotions and behavior, interpreting cues from others, and making \nage-appropriate judgments. Olivia L. has been diagnosed with depression, post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, and reactive attachment disorder.  \n77.  Despite her exposure to repeated and sustained trauma and her diagnoses, Olivia L. \nhas not received adequate medical, mental, and behavioral health services to which she is entitled \nthrough Medicaid while in CYFD custody.  \n78.  Since Olivia L. reentered CYFD custody in August 2016, CYFD has cycled her \nthrough seven placements, including a treatment foster care placement, psychiatric hospital, relative \nplacement, multiple short-term shelters, and a residential treatment center. CYFD first placed \nOlivia L. in a treatment foster care placement from August 2016 to March 2017. CYFD removed \nOlivia L. when she was found cutting herself and using substances and sent her to a psychiatric \nhospital for acute care, where she stayed for several months. While living at the hospital, Olivia L. \nonly received one or two sessions of family therapy before she was discharged to her aunt. \nOlivia L.’s aunt repeatedly requested support services from CYFD but received none. After less \nthan one month, Olivia L.’s aunt requested that she be removed. Olivia L. was then cycled through \nmultiple short-term shelters, where she was raped by two adults. CYFD then placed Olivia L. in a \nresidential treatment center. Olivia L. was transferred to treatment foster care in April 2018 but \nrefused to enter the placement and instead stayed briefly with her biological mother. CYFD was \nnotified of Olivia L.’s location and eventually placed her in a shelter over 300 miles from \nAlbuquerque, where she stayed for over one month. CYFD then moved Olivia L. to another \nresidential treatment facility in Albuquerque in mid-June 2018.  \n79.  Olivia L. brings this action through her Next Friend Georgia Berrenberg. \n  26 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 27 of 95\n80.  Plaintiff Matty B. is a white ten-year-old from Torrance County who entered CYFD \ncustody with his two brothers in November 2016 due to neglect. Matty B. likes riding his bike, \nplaying tag and Connect 4 with his brothers and friends, and flying his toy helicopter.  \n81.  Matty B. is enrolled in Medicaid. \n82.  Matty B. has experienced multiple forms of trauma, including neglect, sexual abuse, \nwitnessing domestic violence, witnessing the sexual abuse of his sister, living with caregivers with \nsubstance abuse and significant mental health challenges, and witnessing the death of his sister in \na fire that burned down their home in May 2016.  \n83.  As a result of sustained and repeated exposure to trauma, Matty B. has difficulty \nmanaging  anger,  regulating  his  emotions,  concentrating,  accepting  redirection  from  others, \ninterpreting cues and communications from others, exhibiting age-appropriate sexual behavior, and \nrecognizing  personal  boundaries.  Matty  B.  experiences  depressive  symptoms  and  is  easily \nfrustrated when he struggles with school lessons, peer interactions, and extracurricular activities. \nHe has difficulty focusing because, among other reasons, he frequently thinks about his unstable \nhome life and his parents’ substance use, and he worries about the safety of his younger brothers. \nMatty B. has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, unspecified disruptive behavior \ndisorder, sibling-relational problems, and parent-child relational problems.  \n84.  Despite his diagnosis and exposure to repeated and sustained trauma, Matty B. has \nnot received adequate medical, mental, and behavioral health services to which he is entitled \nthrough  Medicaid  while  in  CYFD  custody.  Matty  B.  did  not  receive  a  neuropsychological \nevaluation  until  he  had  been  in  CYFD  custody  for  nearly  eight  months.  This  evaluation \nmisdiagnosed  Matty  B.  with  unspecified  neurocognitive  disorder  and  borderline  intellectual \nfunctioning. Eight months later, Matty B.’s schools identified this as a misdiagnosis, determining \n  27 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 28 of 95\nthat Matty B. was in fact eligible for special education services due to emotional disturbance, not \nintellectual disability. The misdiagnosis of borderline intellectual functioning and unspecified \nneurocognitive disorder negatively affected Matty B.’s self-esteem, hopefulness for his future, and \neducational achievement.  \n85.  While in CYFD custody, Matty B. did not receive timely and adequate therapy to \naddress his grief over his sister’s death in the house fire, the sexual trauma he had experienced and \nhis related sexualized behaviors, the neglect he experienced while living with his parents, or his \nadditional behavioral challenges. Matty B. received no individual therapy until three months after \nhe came into CYFD custody. He received family counseling that was abruptly discontinued \nunilaterally by the foster parent without adequate therapeutic basis, any discharge planning, or \noversight by CYFD. As a result, Matty B.’s outbursts quickly returned and escalated, resulting in \nCYFD removing Matty B. and one of his brothers from the foster home on an emergency basis at \nthe request of the foster mother in August 2017. Matty B. and his family did not receive court-\nordered family therapy until December 2017, four months later. In April 2018, Matty B.’s therapist \nresigned from his treatment foster care agency, again suspending the children’s family therapy \nsessions for approximately six weeks. \n86.  CYFD has cycled Matty B. through five placements, including multiple foster \nhomes and treatment foster care homes. Placement changes have separated Matty B. from his \nsiblings and parents and also required changes in Matty B.’s school setting and service providers, \nrepeatedly disrupting his relationships with peers and mental health professionals. Matty B. was \nplaced with his two brothers in a home in Estancia due to a lack of available foster homes closer to \nMatty B.’s hometown. Because of CYFD’s failure to provide transportation assistance, Matty B. \nwas required to change schools and Matty B. and his brothers were unable to consistently visit with \n  28 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 29 of 95\ntheir parents during this time. At another point, Matty B. was again separated from his siblings and \nsent to an emergency foster care placement for twelve days. Matty B. was then sent to a treatment \nfoster care home in Albuquerque, nearly an hour away from his parents and again requiring a change \nin his school setting. Matty B.’s behavior has deteriorated as a result of CYFD’s failure to provide \nMatty B. with stability and as a result of the denial of appropriate medical, mental, and behavioral \nhealth services to which he is entitled.  \n87.  Despite Matty B.’s clear academic challenges, he was not assessed for special \neducation needs until August 2017, approximately ten months after he was initially taken into \nCYFD custody.  \n88.  Matty B. brings this action through his Next Friend Gabrielle Valdez.  \n89.  Plaintiff Justin B. is a white six-year-old from Torrance County who entered CYFD \ncustody with his two brothers in November 2016 due to neglect. \n90.   Justin B. is enrolled in Medicaid. \n91.  Justin B. has experienced multiple forms of trauma, including neglect, witnessing \nthe death of his sister in a fire that burned down his home, witnessing his parents abuse marijuana \nand crystal methamphetamine, witnessing domestic violence between his parents, and living with \ncaregivers with severe mental health challenges. \n92.  As a result of sustained and repeated exposure to trauma, Justin B. has difficulty \nconcentrating, expressing his emotions, accepting redirection, and recognizing personal boundaries. \nJustin B. has a history of self-harming, acting impulsively, and experiencing anxiety. Justin B. has \nreported experiences of auditory and visual hallucinations of his deceased sister and previously \nclaimed that she was controlling his behaviors. Justin B. blamed himself for the fire that killed his \nolder sister, even though he was only three years old when the fire occurred. He becomes frustrated \n  29 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 30 of 95\neasily when he struggles with school lessons, peer interactions, and extracurricular activities, and \nhe has difficulty understanding the progress his parents have made in their treatment plans and \ntrusting them to provide him safety. He has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, \ndisinhibited social engagement disorder, developmental delay, parent-child relational problems, \nand sibling relational problems. Justin B. has been prescribed medication since November 2017 for \nnightmares, anxiety, and self-harming behaviors. \n93.  Despite Justin B.’s exposure to repeated and sustained trauma and his diagnoses, he \nhas not received adequate mental and behavioral health services to which he is entitled through \nMedicaid while in CYFD custody. Justin B. did not receive a neuropsychological evaluation until \nhe had been in CYFD custody for nearly one year. While in CYFD custody, Justin B. did not receive \ntimely and adequate therapy to address his grief and guilt over his sister’s death in the house fire, \nongoing sexualized behaviors, the neglect he experienced while living with his parents, or his \noverall behavioral challenges. He briefly received family counseling that was abruptly discontinued \nunilaterally  by  the  foster  parents  without  adequate  therapeutic  basis,  discharge  planning,  or \noversight by CYFD. As a result, Justin B.’s behavioral challenges quickly returned and escalated, \nresulting in CYFD removing Justin B. and one of his brothers from the foster home on an emergency \nbasis at the request of the foster mother in August 2017. Justin B. and his family did not receive \ncourt-ordered family therapy until December 2017, four months later, and a month after the Court-\nordered deadline to begin the service.  \n94.  CYFD has cycled Justin B. through three placements, including regular foster care, \nan emergency shelter, and treatment foster care. Justin B. was placed with his two brothers in a \nhome in Estancia due to a lack of available foster homes closer to Justin B.’s hometown. Due to \nCYFD’s failure to provide transportation assistance, Justin B. and his brothers were unable to \n  30 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 31 of 95\nconsistently visit with their parents during this time. As a result of the denial of appropriate medical, \nmental, and behavioral health services to which he is entitled through Medicaid, and the denial of \na stable placement while in CYFD custody, Justin B.’s behavior deteriorated. Justin B. was \nseparated from his siblings and sent to an emergency foster care placement for twelve days. CYFD \nthen sent Justin B. to a treatment foster care home in Albuquerque, which is nearly an hour away \nfrom his parents, and which required a change in school.  \n95.  Justin B. brings this action through his Next Friend Gabrielle Valdez. \n96.  Plaintiff Jackson B. is a white one-year-old from Torrance County who entered \nCYFD custody, along with his two older brothers, in November 2016 after he tested positive for \nmethamphetamine and marijuana at birth. \n97.  Jackson B. is enrolled in Medicaid. \n98.  Jackson B. has experienced multiple forms of trauma, including neglect and being \nborn addicted to crystal methamphetamine.  \n99.  Even though Jackson B. was born addicted to methamphetamine and his exposure \nto drugs was the reason he was brought into custody, Jackson B. has not received adequate medical, \nmental, and behavioral health services to which he is entitled through Medicaid while in CYFD \ncustody. Nor has he received appropriate medical services to diagnose, treat, and monitor his health \nissues, including severe asthma and respiratory issues.  \n100.  Despite his young age, Jackson B. has already been cycled through three placements. \nJackson B. was initially placed at a foster home with his two older brothers, Matty B. and Justin B. \nDue to the failure to secure mental and behavioral health services for his brothers they were \nremoved from the foster home and Jackson B. was separated from his siblings in August 2017. Due \nto CYFD’s failure to provide transportation assistance, Jackson B. did not have consistent family \n  31 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 32 of 95\nvisitation with his parents or brothers. In October 2017, Jackson B. was transferred to a new foster \nplacement. CYFD failed to provide proper support, training, and information to the new foster \nfamily, who, as a result, hindered reunification efforts. Seven months later, on April 25, 2018, \nJackson B. was removed from this placement on an emergency basis and sent back to his first foster \nmother in Estancia. \n101.  Jackson B. brings this action through his Next Friend Gabrielle Valdez. \n102.  Plaintiff Lucas M. is a white five-year-old from Bernalillo County. Lucas M. and \nhis brother Julian M. entered CYFD custody in April 2018 due to neglect and domestic violence. \nHis father abuses alcohol and his mother recently began abusing methamphetamines. Lucas M. \nlikes to do gymnastics every week with his brother, Julian M., and play with dogs.  \n103.  Lucas M. is enrolled in Medicaid.  \n104.  Lucas M. has experienced multiple forms of trauma, including witnessing his father \nkick and beat his mother and being neglected and separated from a caregiver.  \n105.  As a result of repeated and sustained trauma, Lucas M. sometimes experiences \nbehavioral challenges, including having difficulty planning, focusing, and regulating his emotions, \nespecially after he sees his mother. When Lucas M. sees his mother and father, he manifests \nregressive behavior by, for example, insisting that his parents feed him. When Lucas M. entered \nCYFD custody, he insisted on sleeping in the same bed as his nine-year-old brother.  Only recently \ndid his foster placement transition him into a bunk bed with his brother.  Plaintiff Lucas M. also \nhas a severe speech impediment. \n106.  Despite his  exposure to repeated and  sustained trauma and his severe speech \nimpediment, Lucas M. has not received adequate medical, mental, and behavioral health services \nto which he is entitled through Medicaid while in CYFD custody. Lucas M. has still not received \n  32 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 33 of 95\nan EPSDT screening or a neuropsychological evaluation after being in CYFD custody for over three \nmonths. Before Lucas M. entered CYFD custody, he was receiving speech therapy during the \nschool year through his preschool. Even though Lucas M. has a severe speech impediment and his \nmother notified CYFD of the impediment the day he was taken into custody, Lucas M. did not \nreceive a referral to a speech therapist when the school year ended until his Guardian ad Litem \nadvocated for one. Lucas M. did not have an intake appointment with a psychotherapist until he \nhad been in custody for over two months. He has received only one session of therapy, which was \na session of talk therapy with his brother and his foster mother in which neither Lucas M. nor his \nbrother felt comfortable speaking.  At the request of his foster parent and Guardian ad Litem, Lucas \nM. recently had two play therapy sessions.  CYFD did not schedule the intake; the foster parent \nsought out play therapy on her own.  \n107.  CYFD has cycled Lucas M. through three placements since he entered custody. \nCYFD first placed Lucas M. and his brother in a non-relative foster placement for almost five weeks \nuntil it found a relative foster placement. CYFD placed Lucas M. and his brother with their aunt, \nthe relative foster placement, for only two weeks. The aunt was not provided with any supports \nfrom CYFD and eventually felt she could not handle fostering Julian M. and Lucas M. in addition \nto supporting her son with special needs who lived with her. CYFD then placed Julian M. and \nLucas M. with a fictive kin.  \n108.  Lucas M. brings this action through his Next Friend Mariel Willow. \n109.  Plaintiff Julian M. is a white nine-year-old from Bernalillo County. Julian M. and \nhis brother Lucas M. entered CYFD custody in April 2018 due to neglect and domestic violence. \nHis father abuses alcohol and his mother recently began abusing methamphetamines. Julian M. \nlikes to ride his bike, do gymnastics, and play with dogs.  \n  33 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 34 of 95\n110.  Julian M. is enrolled in Medicaid.  \n111.  Julian M. has experienced multiple forms of trauma, including witnessing his father \nkick and beat his mother and being neglected and separated from a caregiver.  \n112.  As a result of repeated and sustained trauma, Julian M. sometimes experiences \nbehavioral  challenges,  including  outbursts.  Julian  M.  has  difficulty  regulating  his  emotions, \nplanning and making decisions. Julian M. has extreme difficulty trusting others, especially adults. \nHe is very protective of his mother and younger brother, Lucas M. \n113.  Despite his exposure to repeated and sustained trauma, Julian M. has not received \nadequate medical, mental, and behavioral health services to which he is entitled through Medicaid \nwhile  in  CYFD  custody.  Julian  M.  has  still  not  received  an  EPSDT  screening  or  a \nneuropsychological evaluation after being in CYFD custody for over three months. Julian M. did \nnot have an intake appointment with a therapist until he had been in custody for over two months. \nHe has only had one session with the therapist, a session of talk therapy with the foster mom and \nLucas M. in which the boys barely spoke. At the request of his foster parent and Guardian ad Litem, \nJulian M. recently had two play therapy sessions.  CYFD did not schedule the intake; the foster \nparent sought out play therapy on her own.  \n114.  CYFD has cycled Julian M. through three placements since he entered state custody. \nCYFD first placed Julian M. and his brother in a non-relative foster placement for almost five weeks \nuntil it found a relative foster placement. CYFD placed Julian M. and his brother with their aunt, \nthe relative foster placement, for only two weeks. The aunt was not provided with any supports \nfrom CYFD and eventually felt she could not handle fostering Julian M. and Lucas M. in addition \nto supporting her son with special needs who lived with her.

Julian M. brings this action through his Next Friend Mariel Willow. \n116.  Plaintiff Disability Rights New Mexico (“DRNM”) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit New \nMexico corporation, designated as New Mexico’s protection and advocacy organization (“P&A”), \nwhose mission is to protect, promote, and expand the rights of persons with disabilities. DRNM is \npart of a nationwide network of disability rights agencies established by Congress in 1975 and has \nprovided advocacy services to New Mexicans with disabilities since 1979. The Developmental \nDisabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act, the original legislation establishing the P&A systems, \nauthorizes P&As to “pursue legal, administrative, and other appropriate remedies or approaches to \nensure the protection of, and advocacy for, the rights of such individuals within the state who are \nor who may be eligible for treatment, services, or habilitation.”9 \n117.  DRNM’s constituency includes children and adults with mental illness, intellectual \nand developmental disabilities, traumatic brain injuries, and other disabilities. Particular to this \ncase, the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act of 1986 (“PAIMI”)10 \ncharges P&As in each state with the duty to protect and advocate for the rights of people with \nmental illness. When enacting the law, Congress specifically found that “individuals with mental \nillness are subject to neglect, including lack of treatment . . . health care and discharge planning.” \n                                                 \n9 42 U.S.C. § 15043(a)(2)(A)(i) (2004). Several other pieces of enabling legislation authorize \nsimilar activities. See, e.g., Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act, 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 10801–10827 (1986) (charging P&As with the duty to protect and advocate for the rights \nof people with mental illness); Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Traumatic Brain \nInjury (“PATBI”), 42 U.S.C. § 300d-53 (2014) (advocating for individuals with traumatic brain \ninjury (TBI) and their families), Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights Act (“PAIR”), 29 \nU.S.C. § 794e (2014) (advocating for individuals with disabilities who are not eligible for other \nprotection and advocacy programs). \n10 42 U.S.C. §§ 10801–10827 (1986). \n \n  35 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 36 of 95\n42 U.S.C. § 10801(a)(3). Congress further found that state systems for monitoring the rights of \nindividuals with mental illness are varied and often inadequate. Id. at (a)(4). \n118.  Recognizing  the  vulnerability  of  individuals  with  mental  illness,  Congress \nauthorized DRNM to “protect and advocate the rights of such individuals through activities to \nensure the enforcement of the constitution and federal and state statutes.”11 Children involved in \nthe child welfare system by definition have experienced trauma leading to behavioral and mental \nhealth diagnoses. These children have a right to appropriate and timely screening and treatment for \nbehavioral and mental health disorders as well as physical health care needs. Children with mental \nimpairments are entitled to an avenue to secure these vital health care services.  \n119.  DRNM has the authority to pursue strategies to secure medically necessary mental \nand physical health care for children in custody with behavioral health diagnoses. DRNM provides \nindividual advocacy services to children whose foster parents or guardians ad litem have had \ndifficulty getting appropriate health care, most particularly behavioral health care. DRNM also \nprovides support and technical assistance to attorneys serving children and youth in the child \nwelfare system. \n120.  Plaintiff Native American Disability Law Center (“NADLC”) is a 501(c)(3) \nnonprofit organization based in Farmington, New Mexico. NADLC advocates for the legal rights \nof  Native  Americans  with  disabilities.  Like  DRNM,  NADLC  is  a  protection  and  advocacy \norganization authorized by relevant federal statutes to initiate legal action designed to protect the \nrights of persons with disabilities, including children in the foster care system. See 42 U.S.C. \n§§ 15041 et seq., 10801 et seq. NADLC’s mission is to advocate so that the rights of Native \n                                                 \n11 42 U.S.C. § 10801(b)(2)(A) (1991). \n  36 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 37 of 95\nAmericans with disabilities in the Four Corners area are enforced, strengthened, and brought in \nharmony with their communities. NADLC represents Native American children with disabilities in \nthe child welfare system as Guardians ad Litem and Youth Attorneys. \n121.  NADLC is required to expend significantly more resources to represent children in \nthe child welfare system when CYFD and HSD fail to appropriately place children, subject children \nto repeated changes of placements, and fail to provide caregivers and children with necessary \nMedicaid services. The allocation of resources necessary due to these failures diverts NADLC from \nproviding other essential legal services to Native Americans with disabilities. \nB.  Defendants \n122.  Defendants  include  state  officials  from  the  two  state  agencies  responsible  for \nadministering and supervising the child welfare system and Medicaid services to eligible children. \nCYFD is responsible for “administering and supervising” New Mexico’s child welfare services. \n§ 8.8.2.8(A) NMAC. HSD has the authority to “establish, administer and supervise child welfare \nactivities and social services to children,” NMSA 1978, § 9-8-13(A)(1), and is the single state \nagency designated to administer New Mexico’s Medicaid program. 8.291.400.9 NMAC, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396a(a)(5).12  \n123.  Defendant  Monique  Jacobson  is  the  Cabinet  Secretary  of  the  New  Mexico \nChildren, Youth, and Families Department. As such, she is responsible for administering child \nwelfare services in New Mexico, including ensuring CYFD meets it obligations to license and \nmonitor appropriate placements for children in the child welfare system; provide for the care, \n                                                 \n12 All references herein to CYFD reference Defendant Jacobson her official capacity at CYFD, not \nagainst CYFD as an entity, and all references to HSD reference Defendant Earnest in his official \ncapacity at HSD, not against HSD as an entity. \n  37 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 38 of 95\nprotection and wholesome mental and physical development of children in state custody; and ensure \na coordinated and integrated system of care and services for children, youth, and families. The \nCYFD Secretary retains “final decision-making authority and responsibility for the administration \nof any such laws as provided in Subsection B of Section 7 of the Children, Youth and Families \nDepartment Act.” NMSA 1978, § 9-2A-9. \n124.  Defendant  Brent  Earnest  is  Secretary  of  the  New  Mexico  Human  Services \nDepartment. As such, “[i]t is his duty to manage all operations of the department,” “enforce the \nlaws with which he or the department is charged,” and exercise “general supervisory and appointing \nauthority over all department employees.” NMSA 1978, §§ 9-8-6(A), 9-8-6(B)(1). The Social \nServices Division of HSD establishes, administers and supervises child welfare activities. Id. §§ 9-\n8-6(A), 9-8-13(A). The Medical Assistance Division of HSD administers New Mexico’s Medicaid \nprogram. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(5); 42 C.F.R. § 431.10 (2013); NMSA 1978, §§ 9-8-12, 27-2-16. \nEarnest is also Secretary Co-chair of the Behavioral Health Collaborative. The collaborative is \nresponsible  for  (1)  “[c]omprehensive  planning  and  meeting  state  and  federal  requirements”; \n(2) “[c]reating a single behavioral health care and services delivery system that promotes mental \nhealth, emphasizes prevention, early intervention, resiliency, recovery and rehabilitation”; and \n(3) “[m]onitoring  service  capacities  and  utilization  in  order  to  achieve  desired  performance \nmeasures and outcomes.”13 \n125.  At all times hereto, Defendants were acting under color of state law. \n                                                 \n13 NMSA 1978, § 9-7-6.4; New Mexico Human Services Department, Medical Assistance Division, \nhttp://www.hsd.state.nm.us/behavioral-health-collaborative.aspx (last visited July 18, 2018).  \n  38 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 39 of 95\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n126.  The Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 \nbecause it arises under the laws of the United States. This Court has personal jurisdiction over \nDefendants because the individual defendants are domiciled in this district and because Defendants’ \nacts and omissions took place within this district. \n127.  Venue is proper in this federal district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), (c). \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n128.  Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief applicable to members of the Plaintiff Class and Sub-\nclass as defined below. The requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(2), are \nmet with respect to the classes defined below. \n129.  The plaintiff class (“Plaintiff Class”) is defined as a statewide class of children and \nyoung people who are in the legal custody of the Children, Youth and Families Department and \nwho have experienced or are at significant risk of experiencing complex trauma that substantially \nlimits major life activities. The class includes, but is not limited to, children with trauma-related \nconditions recognized by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition \n(DSM-5), including post-traumatic stress, anxiety, dissociative, conduct, depressive, and substance-\nrelated and addictive disorders.  \n130.  A sub-class of individuals (“Sub-Class”) is defined as individuals in the above-\nnamed Plaintiff Class who also qualify for protections under the Indian Child Welfare Act. \n131.  There exist questions of law and/or fact common to the Plaintiff Class and Sub-Class \n(collectively, the “Classes”) that predominate over any individual question. Common questions of \nfact and law include, without limitation: \n  39 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 40 of 95\n•  Whether Defendants have a system in place that provides children impacted by \ntrauma in state custody with placements and services that are the most appropriate and least \nrestrictive, as required by law; \n•  Whether Defendants have a system in place that adequately and timely screens \nchildren in their custody for medical, mental health, and behavioral needs, as required by law;  \n•  Whether Defendants have a system in place that ensures provision and coordination \nof medical, mental health, and behavioral health services, as required by law; \n•  Whether  any  of  Defendants’  alleged  policies  or  practices  violate  plaintiffs’ \nsubstantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, the \nRehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Medicaid Act, and/or the Indian Child \nWelfare Act. \n132.  The Classes are so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. According \nto the most recent available data, the total number of children who had spent time in foster care in \nfiscal year 2017 in New Mexico was 4,737.14 \n133.  The dispersed and changing geographic location of members of the Classes also \nmakes joinder impracticable. Due to CYFD’s placement practices, members of the Classes are \nplaced in multiple states and are frequently forced to change placements.  \n134.  The claims of all the named individual Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of members \nof the Classes. The claims of Diana D. are typical of the claims of claims of members of the Sub-\nclass. Each Plaintiff is a member of the class he or she seeks to represent. Plaintiffs and members \nof the Classes have all experienced complex trauma that substantially limits major life activities, \n                                                 \n14 CYFD, FY 2018 Annual Report and Strategic Plan 13 (2018), https://cyfd.org/docs/ \nfy18_annual_report_v2-3.pdf.  \n  40 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 41 of 95\nsuch  as  eating,  sleeping,  concentrating,  thinking,  communicating,  learning,  emotional  self-\nregulation,  setting  goals,  and  long-term  planning,  and  major  bodily  functions  of  the  brain, \nneurological, and endocrine systems. As a result of Defendants’ acts, omissions, policies, and \npractices that apply to Plaintiffs and the Classes, Plaintiffs and members of the Classes are denied \nmeaningful access to the benefits of New Mexico’s child welfare system. \n135.  Plaintiffs and their Next Friends will fairly and adequately protect the interests of \nthe Classes. The Plaintiffs are represented by experienced counsel who will adequately represent \nthe interests of the Classes.  \n136.  Defendants have acted and refused to act and continue to do so on grounds generally \napplicable to the Classes that Plaintiffs represent, thereby rendering appropriate injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief for the Classes as a whole.  \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nI.  CYFD AND HSD ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR NEW MEXICO’S SYSTEM OF \nCHILD WELFARE AND DELIVERY OF MEDICAL, MENTAL HEALTH, \nAND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. \nA.  CYFD’s Duty to Administer New Mexico’s Child Welfare System \n137.  New  Mexico  has  established  a  system  of  child  welfare  to  prevent  the  abuse, \nabandonment, or neglect of children and to ensure that youth in state custody have safe and \npermanent homes and that their well-being is promoted. This system reflects the parens patriae \nprinciple that state government has a paramount interest in ensuring the protection of children.  \n138.  CYFD is the child welfare agency responsible for child protective services in New \nMexico, and its duties are laid out in detail in Articles 1 and 4 of the New Mexico’s Children’s \nCode. Among other obligations, state law identifies CYFD as the state agency responsible for \nexecuting the following duties to protect the safety and welfare of New Mexico’s children: \n  41 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 42 of 95\n•  receiving and investigating reports of child abuse and neglect, NMSA 1978, §§ 32A-\n4-3, -4, and initiating court proceedings to remove children from their homes when necessary to \nensure a child’s safety, see 10 N.M. Reg. 311; \n•  serving as the legal custodian for children who are removed from their homes, \nNMSA 1978, §§ 32A-4-7, -16, -18, -22, -25;  \n•  placing children in CYFD custody in appropriate, “community-based” licensed \nfoster homes, approved adoptive homes, certified treatment facilities, shelters, or with relatives, id. \n§§ 32A-1-4(P), 32A-4-8; \n•  licensing foster homes, certifying treatment facilities and shelters and approving \nadoptive homes, id. §§ 40-7A-1, et seq.; \n•  establishing and making reasonable efforts to implement permanency plans for \nchildren in custody, id. §§ 32A-4-22(J), -25.1;  \n•  “enact[ing] regulations to control disposition and placement of children under the \nChildren’s Code, including regulations to limit or prohibit the out-of-state placement of children, \nincluding those who have developmental disabilities or emotional, neurobiological or behavioral \ndisorders, when in-state alternatives are available,” id. § 9-2A-8(F); \n•  “assum[ing] and implement[ing] responsibility for children’s mental health and \nsubstance abuse services in the state, coordinating with the human services department and the \ndepartment of health,” id. § 9-2A-8(H); \n•  developing and facilitating treatment plans for children in custody, id. §§ 32A-4-21, \n-22, -25; \n•  developing standards of service within the department that focus on prevention, \nearly intervention, monitoring and outcomes; id. §§ 9-2A-8(D), -8(J); and \n  42 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 43 of 95\n•  “develop[ing] and maintain[ing] a statewide database, including client tracking of \nservices for children, youth and families,” id. § 9-2A-8(C). \n139.  Federal law likewise imposes duties on CYFD to ensure the safety, permanence, and \nwell-being of children in state custody. New Mexico receives federal funding under Title IV-E of \nthe Social Security Act for partial reimbursement of the cost of providing foster care, adoption \nassistance, and kinship guardianship assistance to children who meet federal eligibility criteria. As \na condition of receiving this funding, New Mexico must develop and adhere to a plan that satisfies \na number of requirements, including: \n•  placing each child in foster care in a foster placement that conforms to nationally \nrecommended professional standards, 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(10);  \n•  providing each child in foster care with quality services to protect his or her safety \nand health, id. § 671(a)(22); \n•  providing a written case plan for each child that includes (i) a plan to provide safe, \nappropriate, and stable foster care placements and implementation of that plan, id. §§ 671(a)(16), \n675(1)(A); (ii) where reunification is not possible or appropriate, a written case plan that ensures \nthe location of an appropriate adoptive or other permanent home for the child and implementation \nof that plan, id. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(E); (iii) a plan to ensure the educational stability of the child \nwhile in foster care and implementation of that plan, id. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(G); and \n•  maintaining a case review system in which the status of each child in foster care is \nreviewed every six months for purposes of determining the safety of the child, the continuing \nnecessity  and  appropriateness  of  the  foster  placement,  the  extent  of  compliance  with  the \npermanency plan, and the projected date of permanency, id. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(5)(B), 675(5)(C). \n  43 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 44 of 95\n140.  The Indian Child Welfare Act sets forth steps to be taken to meet the distinct needs \nof children covered by ICWA who are in the child welfare system. Children in state custody who \nare covered by ICWA are to be placed in the least restrictive setting that most approximates a family \nand in which the child’s special needs, if any, may be met and “within reasonable proximity to his \nor her home, taking into account any special needs of the child.” 25 U.S.C. § 1915(b). It further \nrequires preference in foster placements to be given to “(i) a member of the Indian child’s extended \nfamily; (ii) a foster home licensed, approved, or specified by the Indian child’s tribe; (iii) an Indian \nfoster home licensed or approved by an authorized non-Indian licensing authority; or (iv) an \ninstitution for children approved by an Indian tribe or operated by an Indian organization which has \na program suitable to meet the Indian child’s needs.” Id. ICWA also requires preference in adoptive \nplacements to be given to “(1) a member of the child’s extended family; (2) other members of the \nIndian child’s tribe; or (3) other Indian families.” Id. § 1915(a). CYFD must maintain a record of \neach placement of children covered by ICWA and show evidence of efforts to comply with the \norder of preferences. Id. § 1915(e). CYFD must also make active efforts to provide remedial \nservices and rehabilitation programs designed to prevent the breakup of Indian families. 25 U.S.C. \n§ 1912(d). \nB.  HSD’s Medicaid Obligations to Provide a System of Medical, Mental \nHealth, and Behavioral Health Screening and Services  \n \n141.  Medicaid is a federal program enacted in 1965 as part of the Social Security Act. \nAlthough a state’s participation in the Medicaid program is voluntary, New Mexico has elected to \nparticipate and has designated HSD as the state agency responsible for administering the program. \nNMSA  1978,  § 9-8-12;  42  U.S.C.  § 1396(a)(5);  42  C.F.R.  § 431.10.  Once  a  state  elects  to \nparticipate in the Medicaid program, it must follow program requirements mandated by the federal \n  44 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 45 of 95\ngovernment. State participants must administer Medicaid in “the best interests of recipients,” 42 \nU.S.C. § 1396a(a)(19), provide services with reasonable promptness, id. § 1396a(a)(8), and ensure \nthere is an adequate provider network to deliver those services, id. § 1396u-2(b)(5), 42 C.F.R. \n§ 438.68, 8.308.2.9 NMAC.  \n142.  The child health component of Medicaid, Early Periodic Screening Diagnosis and \nTreatment (“EPSDT”), was enacted in 1967. The goal of EPSDT was to focus on prevention and \nearly intervention in order to reduce health problems among poor children and offer them equal \nopportunities for access to health care and healthy lives. All state Medicaid plans are required to \nprovide for “[s]uch other necessary health care, diagnostic services, treatment, and other measures \n. . . to correct or ameliorate defects and physical and mental illnesses and conditions discovered by \nthe screening services.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(r)(5). \n143.  As a participant in the Medicaid program, New Mexico must provide all Medicaid-\neligible persons in the state under the age of 21 with periodic EPSDT screenings that include “a \ncomprehensive health and developmental history (including assessment of both physical and mental \nhealth development),” a comprehensive physical exam, appropriate immunizations, lab tests and \nhealth education, 42 U.S.C.§ 1396d(r)(1)(B), as well as assessment of the child’s vision, dental and \nhearing needs, id. § 1396d(r)(2)-(4); see also 8.308.9.19 NMAC. New Mexico must further provide \nand arrange for the treatment services necessary to correct or ameliorate a psychiatric, behavioral, \nor emotional condition of a Medicaid-eligible child or youth under the age of 21. 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396d(a). Among the intensive home and community-based services that the state is obligated to \nprovide are: home health care services, id. § 1396d(a)(7), rehabilitative services, id. § 1396d(a)(13), \ncase  management  services,  id.  §§ 1396d(a)(19),  1396n(g);  and  personal  care  services,  id. \n§ 1396d(a)(24); see 8.308.9.19 NMAC, 8.321.2.11(B)(4(c) NMAC, 8.321.2.16(B)(3)(c) NMAC. \n  45 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 46 of 95\nEPSDT services include all behavioral and mental health Medicaid-covered services that are \nmedically necessary for children.15  \n144.  EPSDT treatment services must be timely, individualized, and consistent with \naccepted medical standards. Services must be initiated within six months from the date of request. \n42 C.F.R. § 441.56(e). \n145.  In order to provide these required services, “[t]he [Medicaid] agency must make \navailable a variety of individual and group providers qualified and willing to provide EPSDT \nservices.” 42 C.F.R. § 441.61(b). While states may adopt managed care, contract with entities to \noversee the delivery of services and arrange services through provider networks, states retain \nresponsibility for ensuring compliance with all relevant Medicaid requirements, including the \nmandates of the EPSDT program. 42 U.S.C. § 1396u-2.  \nII.

New Mexico foster children have experienced and continue to experience traumatic \nevents  that  profoundly  affect  their  psychological,  emotional,  and  physical  well-being.  At  a \nminimum,  children  in  New  Mexico’s  foster  system  have  experienced  childhood  abuse, \nabandonment, or neglect. In particular, they may experience physical, emotional, or sexual abuse; \n                                                 \n15 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(r)(5).  Consistent with federal Medicaid law, the New Mexico Children’s \nCode defines medically necessary services as: “clinical and rehabilitative physical, mental or \nbehavioral health services that are: (1) essential to prevent, diagnose or treat medical conditions or \nare essential to enable the child to attain, maintain or regain functional capacity; (2) delivered in \nthe amount, duration, scope and setting that is clinically appropriate to the specific physical, mental \nand behavioral health care needs of the child; (3) provided within professionally accepted standards \nof practice and national guidelines; and (4) required to meet the physical, mental and behavioral \nhealth needs of the child and are not primarily for the convenience of the child, provider or payer[.]” \nSee NMSA 1978, § 32A-6A-4(T).  \n  46 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 47 of 95\nemotional or physical neglect; homelessness; the death, incarceration, or deportation of a parent; \ndomestic violence; parental substance abuse, mental illness, or involvement in sex work. For \nchildren in the child welfare system, research confirms that the experience of abuse, abandonment, \nneglect, and instability is often compounded by unfair treatment due to their race or ethnicity, sexual \norientation or gender identity, as well as extreme poverty and other socioeconomic hardship. \n147.  In addition to experiencing abuse, abandonment, and neglect at home, New Mexico \nfoster children have also, by definition, experienced separation from a caregiver upon entering \nCYFD custody. Separation from a caregiver, even an abusive or neglectful caregiver, is traumatic \nfor a child.16 A child may experience separation from an abusive or neglectful caregiver as more \ntraumatic than the abuse or neglect itself. The trauma of being separated from one’s parental figures \nis often compounded by the trauma of being separated from one’s siblings. The separation of \nsiblings in foster care is associated with negative adjustment outcomes, including running away and \nincreased behavioral health issues.17 Due to CYFD’s inadequate array of placements and routine \ncycling of children through multiple placements, the agency often fails to place siblings in the same \nplacement, or even geographical region. Plaintiffs Chris W., Diana D., Olivia L., Matty B., Justin \nB., Jackson B., Brian J., Elliot J., and Michael J. have all been separated from a sibling who is also \nin foster care.  \n                                                 \n16 The Nat’l Child Traumatic Stress Network, Children with Traumatic Separation: Information for \nProfessionals 2, https://www.nctsn.org/sites/default/files/resources/children_with_traumatic \n_separation_professionals.pdf.  \n 17 Children’s Bureau, Child Welfare Information Gateway, Sibling Issues in Foster Care and \nAdoption 7 (Jan. 2013) (hereinafter “Sibling Issues in Foster Care”) , https://www.childwelfare.gov/ \npubpdfs/siblingissues.pdf (citing Hegar, R.

Although even a single traumatic experience can impair a child’s well-being, for \nNew Mexico foster children, these events do not take place in isolation. New Mexico foster children \nare subjected to multiple, repeated, and sustained traumatic experiences. As such, they have \nexperienced complex trauma—the exposure to multiple traumatic events, often of an invasive, \ninterpersonal nature and the wide-ranging, long-term impact of this exposure.18 \n149.  Indeed, as catalogued above, each member of the Classes experienced multiple \nforms of trauma. For example, Plaintiff Diana D. has experienced the traumas of substance abuse \nand neglect by her mother, sexual abuse by an older brother, homelessness, and consistent bullying \nat school. Plaintiff Kevin S.’s experience with trauma includes repeated childhood sexual abuse by \nhis mothers’ partners, physical abuse, exposure to domestic violence, and neglect.  \nB.  Complex  Trauma’s  Effects  on  Brain  Development,  Function,  and \nNeurobiology  \n \n150.  Decades of medical research have overwhelmingly established that the brains of \nchildren who experience chronic or repeated traumas undergo material changes. These changes \ndemonstrably  impair  brain  functioning  and  the  neurological  and  endocrine  systems.  This \nimpairment in turn interferes with the ability to perform daily activities, including eating, sleeping, \nconcentrating, thinking, communicating, learning, emotional-self regulation, setting goals, and \nlong-term planning. These impairments fall squarely within the meaning of “disability” under the \nRehabilitation Act and the ADA.  \n                                                 \n18  Bruce  D.

The human brain, especially the developing brain of a child, is plastic and adaptable. \nThis plasticity allows us to meet the challenges, tasks, and situations we encounter in our daily \nlives. However, when an individual is repeatedly exposed to trauma, the brain becomes over-\nsensitized to any potential stimulus that might signal a threat. Such a person may perceive ordinary \nencounters as threatening ones, triggering a reactive “fight or flight” or dissociative mode.19 \n152.  With severe or chronic trauma, “states become traits”: the hyper-aroused “fight” \nstate or the detached, dissociative state becomes the brain’s new equilibrium. In practice, this means \nthat if a child repeatedly experiences fear, the areas of the brain that control behavior directed by \nfear can become over-sensitized, and “full-blown response patterns”—such as hyper-arousal or \ndisassociation—can be triggered by seemingly innocuous stimuli.20 The child might reasonably \nperceive ordinary questions from therapists or foster parents, sudden physical movements, or \ndisagreements as challenges, triggering hostility or withdrawal. In a child welfare system that is not \ntrauma-sensitive, this child will likely be treated as disruptive and will be removed and taken to \nanother, likely more restrictive, placement. \n                                                 \n19 Bruce D.

The  wounds  inflicted  by  trauma  may  be  invisible,  but  they  are  unmistakably \nrevealed  by  brain  imaging  of  children  exposed  to  traumatic  experiences  such  as  abuse, \nabandonment, and neglect. The figure below shows abnormal brain development following neglect \nin early childhood. The CT scan on the left is an image from a healthy three-year-old with an \naverage head size (50th percentile). The CT scan on the right is an image from a three-year-old \nsuffering from extreme neglect. This child’s brain is significantly smaller than average (3rd \npercentile).21 \n22 \n154.  The effects of unaddressed exposure to complex trauma can have far reaching \nconsequences for the life activities of children and young people. Some of the activities impacted \ninclude: \n•  Abnormal Sleeping and Eating Patterns. Children impacted by complex trauma \noften experience sleep disturbances and eating disorders.23 Plaintiffs Chris W., Kevin S., Jennifer \n                                                 \n21See Victor G.

Plaintiff Diana D. has been diagnosed with an \neating disorder. \n•  Impact  on  Cognition, Learning,  and  Concentrating.  Trauma  affects  mental \nreasoning  functions,  including  reasoning,  problem  solving,  or  evaluating  cause-and-effect \nrelationships.24 A child who is exposed to severe or chronic trauma may also become preoccupied \nwith the traumatic events and replay them over and over in her mind, making it harder for her to \nthink, learn, and focus.25 The difficulty concentrating caused by exposure to trauma can impair a \nchild’s ability to process, retain, synthesize, and recall information as well.26 Plaintiffs Chris W., \nJennifer H., Kevin S., Diana D., Brian J., Elliot J., and Olivia L. have difficulty concentrating. \nPlaintiffs Kevin S., Justin B., Matty B., Brian J. and Elliot J. have been diagnosed with ADHD.  \n•  Verbal Processing and Communication. Children impacted by complex trauma \noften have difficulty communicating their wishes and needs and interpreting cues from others.27 \nPlaintiffs Chris W., Kevin S., Jennifer H., Diana D., Olivia L., Matty B., Brian J., and Elliot J. have \ndifficulty communicating with others and interpreting cues from others.  \n•  Emotional Self-Regulation. Complex trauma often induces a predictable set of \nbehaviors due to loss of ability to emotionally self-regulate, including aggression, disproportionate \nreactivity, impulsivity, distractibility, or withdrawal and avoidance. Plaintiffs Chris W., Jennifer H., \n                                                 \n24 Effects of Complex Trauma, supra note 18, at 3. \n25  Sheryl  Kataoka  et  al.,Responding  to  Students  with  PTSD  in  Schools,  21  CHILD.

Plaintiffs Chris W., Jennifer H., Kevin S., and Diana D. have been diagnosed with \ndisorders indicating inhibited emotional self-regulation, including oppositional defiant disorder, \nintermittent explosive disorder, and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.  \n•  Goal-Setting and Long-Term Planning. Traumatized children also have a more \ndifficult time setting and achieving goals. Children who do not feel safe at their placement, school, \nor therapy and who are often in a state of hypervigilance tend to “act instead of plan,”28 focusing \nonly on their immediate surroundings and situation. Consequently, their ability to make plans or \ndecisions, set goals, work toward those goals, and reflect on progress can be compromised.29 \nPlaintiffs Chris W., Kevin S., Jennifer H., and Diana D. have difficulty making decisions, setting \ngoals, and long-term planning.  \n•  Ability to Care for Oneself. Traumatized children can have difficulty caring for \nthemselves and managing their hygiene.  \n155.  Because the developing brain of a child is plastic and adaptable, widely published \nand peer-reviewed research shows that trauma-informed, evidence-based treatment, services and \nsupports help children impacted by complex trauma heal, ameliorating the impacts of the condition.  \n                                                 \n28 Bessel A.

Trauma Exposure and Adverse Outcomes for New Mexico’s Foster \nYouth \n \n156.  Because members of the Classes have endured more than one form of trauma, they \nare more likely to experience significant adverse outcomes.30 \n157.  Failure  to  address  the  trauma  experienced  by  foster  children  has  lasting \nconsequences for their health, educational achievement, and economic self-sufficiency. Research \nshows that foster children have lower educational outcomes and higher rates of unemployment, \nhomelessness, and incarceration than non-foster children. Elementary-aged foster children achieve \nlower proficiency in English language arts and math than their peers31 and are twice as likely to be \nheld back in school.32 School-age foster children are also more likely to face harsh school discipline. \n                                                 \n30 See Robert Anda et al., The Enduring Effects of Abuse and Related Adverse Experiences in \nChildhood: A Convergence of Evidence from Neurobiology and Epidemiology, 256 EUROPEAN \nARCHIVES OF PSYCHIATRY AND CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE 174 (2006), https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ \npmc/articles/PMC3232061/pdf/nihms340170.pdf  (finding  that  the  risk  of  adverse  outcomes \nthroughout a person’s lifespan “in the affective, somatic, substance abuse, memory, sexual, and \naggression related domains increased in a graded fashion as the ACE score increased”); see also Mark \nE.

CYFD AND HSD HAVE FAILED TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN A \nSYSTEM  TO  ENSURE  STABLE  AND  APPROPRIATE  FOSTER  CARE \nPLACEMENTS.  \n \n158.  CYFD has failed to establish and maintain a system capable of placing children in \nstable foster care placements appropriate to their individual needs. First, CYFD has failed to secure \nan adequate array of placements. As a result, placement decisions are overwhelmingly driven by \nthe vagaries of availability instead of a child’s individual medical, mental, and behavioral health \nneeds. Second, CYFD has failed to hire, support and train staff and service providers—including \ncase workers and mental health providers—in sufficient numbers and with appropriate expertise. \nCYFD  is  therefore  not  capable  of  providing  the  support  and  services  necessary  to  making \nplacements  healthy,  safe,  and  sustainable.

HSD’s failure to adequately ensure provision of timely medical, mental health, and \nbehavioral health services for children contributes to CYFD’s failed placement practices. As a \nresult, the mental and physical health of children in CYFD custody deteriorates, placements become \nunsustainable, and children are unnecessarily removed and cycled through progressively more \nrestrictive placements.  \nA.  Inadequate and Inappropriate Array of Placements \n1.  Numerous and Short-Term Placements \n160.  Due  to  CYFD’s  systemic  failure  to  secure  an  adequate  array  of  appropriate \nplacements and services for children in its custody, CYFD routinely cycles children through \nnumerous short-term placements, including the CYFD office and short-term shelters. Placing \nchildren in multiple short-term placements devastates their sense of stability. With each removal, \nchildren  sever  ties  with  classmates,  teachers,  therapists,  service  providers,  and  community \nmembers. They must begin forming critical relationships anew, hoping that, but never knowing \nwhether, they will live in their new location long enough to make progress before yet another \nremoval.  \n161.  CYFD routinely cycles children through a series of emergency shelters that are \ndesigned for short term emergency stays and, thus, are not designed to maintain or establish long-\nterm mental health, behavioral health, or medical care. In fact, CYFD rotates children through a \nseries of emergency shelters so frequently that these shelters routinely set up calls with each other \nto plan how they can transfer children from shelter to shelter.  \n  55 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 56 of 95\n162.  CYFD routinely places children in these short-term emergency shelters for months \nat a time. Plaintiffs Chris W., Kevin S., Jennifer H., and Diana D. have been cycled through multiple \nshort-term placements, including the CYFD office, emergency shelters, and acute child psychiatric \nunits. Plaintiff Chris W. was cycled through four placements, including multiple short-term youth \nshelters in Taos and Albuquerque, within a two-month period. \n2.  Overly Restrictive Placements  \n163.  Defendants’  have  an  inadequate  array  of  less-restrictive  placements.  CYFD \ntherefore routinely places children in residential treatment centers not because of medical necessity, \nbut because no other placement options are available. Residential treatment centers are among the \nmost restrictive placements for children in state custody. Children in state custody have the right to \nthe least restrictive treatment and should only be placed in residential treatment centers if it is \nmedically necessary. Defendants’ failure to secure enough placements within New Mexico results \nin children being sent to out-of-state residential treatment centers. According to CYFD, as of \nMay 2018, 137 New Mexico children were placed in out-of-state residential treatment centers; \napproximately 24% of those children were foster children in state custody.35 Plaintiffs Kevin S. and \nJennifer H. are currently placed in residential treatment centers in Utah and Missouri, respectively. \nCYFD does not regularly monitor children once they send them out of the state. Plaintiff Kevin S. \nwas never visited by a CYFD staff member while living in a residential treatment center in Utah \nfor eleven months. \n164.  For example, Plaintiff Jennifer H. was removed from her Medicaid treatment foster \ncare in New Mexico and sent to a residential treatment center in Missouri, again paid for by \n                                                 \n35  CYFD’s  response  to  an  Inspection  of  Public  Records  Act  request  entitled  “Out  of  State \nResidential Placement of NM Children and Youth (12/01/17), produced April 12, 2018. \n  56 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 57 of 95\nMedicaid. She was moved to a residential treatment center not because her service providers \nrecommended a placement in residential treatment, but because Defendants were unable to identify \na single placement in New Mexico that would accept Jennifer H. after she made an allegation of \nsexual abuse against a foster father. After making this allegation, Jennifer H. was effectively \npunished by being removed and sent to an out-of-state, more restrictive placement. In addition to \nbeing overly restrictive for Jennifer H., this placement does not provide her with the services her \ntherapist indicated she needed, including an attachment model and trauma-informed services. \nB.  Unsafe  and  Traumatic  Practices,  Including  Use  of  Restraint  and \nSeclusion  \n \n165.  Defendants routinely deprive children in state custody of their right to be free from \nthe unreasonable use of restraint and seclusion. Restraint and seclusion may be used only if the \ntechnique  is  imposed  to  ensure  physical  safety  of  a  resident  or  staff  member.  42  U.S.C. \n§ 290ii(b)(1). Under Defendants’ supervision, however, residential treatment centers and treatment \nfoster care providers routinely use restraints and seclusions on children in CYFD custody for \nprohibited reasons, including for staff convenience, or as coercion, discipline, or retaliation by staff.  \n166.  Restraint and seclusion are ineffective36 methods of behavioral control and result in \nsevere  physical  and  psychological  harm  to  children,  especially  children  who  have  already \n                                                 \n36 Studies have shown that the use of restraint and seclusion intervention leads to an increase in many \nof the behaviors that those utilizing the intervention hope to eliminate. See, e.g., R.J. Jones & G.D. \nTimbers, An analysis of the restraint event and its behavioral effects on clients and staff, 11 \nRECLAIMING CHILD. AND YOUTH,  37–41  (2002),  available  at  https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ646799. \nThose who experience restraint or seclusion are both more likely to remain in care longer and to be \nreadmitted for care upon release. Alternative behavioral intervention strategies such as collaborative \nproblem solving (CBS), which place an emphasis on directly addressing a child’s trauma, have been \nproven more effective in constructively managing an intensely frustrated child that would otherwise \nbe subject to restraint or seclusion. Andrés Martin et al., Reduction of Restraint and Seclusion \n \n  57 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 58 of 95\nexperienced trauma. Studies have shown that being restrained is a traumatizing experience in and \nof itself.37 Those who are secluded reportedly experience higher feelings of stress, vulnerability, \nneglect, fear, rejection, and anger. For those children that have already experienced trauma, the use \nof restraints can be re-traumatizing.38 \n167.  The use of restraint and seclusion as a behavioral intervention strategy places \nchildren at risk of serious physical harm. Personal restraints can subject children to a variety of \ninjuries, including coma, broken bones, bruises, cuts, and facial damage. It can also cause death due \nto asphyxiation, strangulation, cardiac arrest, blunt trauma, and choking. Plaintiff Kevin S. was \nrepeatedly restrained, often for over an hour at a time. As a result, he appeared at a court hearing \nwith bruised eyes and other facial wounds. \n168.  Chemical restraints are similarly dangerous to children’s health and yet are routinely \nused on children in CYFD custody. The powerful psychotropic drugs and sedatives used pose a \nsignificant risk to children’s physical and mental health, and in some cases can lead to death by \ndrug overdose. For example, staff at one of the largest residential treatment centers in Albuquerque, \nroutinely use or threaten to use “booty juice,” a sedative or other psychotropic medications on \nchildren when their disruptive behaviors do not threaten the child or another with imminent, serious \nphysical harm. \n                                                 \nThrough Collaborative Problem Solving: A Five-Year Prospective Inpatient Study, 59 PSYCHIATRIC \nSERVICES 1406 (2008), available at https://www.livesinthebalance.org/sites/default/files/Martin%20 \nPsychiatric%20Services%202008.pdf. \n37 Kathleen Ferreira, Promoting Alternatives to the Use of Seclusion and Restraint, Issue Brief #1, \nU.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration \n2 (2010), https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/topics/trauma_and_violence/ \nseclusion-restraints-1.pdf . \n38 Id.  \n \n  58 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 59 of 95\n169.  CYFD has failed to uphold its obligation to ensure that inappropriate restraint and \nseclusion practices are not used39 against children in its custody,40 including children in out-of-state \nresidential treatment centers.41 It has failed to ensure that the policies and practices of a placement \nit  certifies  comply  with  CYFD  regulations,  including  CYFD  regulations  on  restraints  and \nseclusion.42 Furthermore, CYFD has failed to respond appropriately to incident reports it receives \neach time a child is subjected to restraint or seclusion.43 Even after CYFD receives incident reports \nindicating inappropriate restraint or seclusion, it keeps children in the same placements instead of \nremoving them. For example, CYFD received multiple incident reports detailing how Plaintiff \nKevin S. had been repeatedly harmed by both staff and other residents and how he had repeatedly \nbeen restrained multiple times a week for substantial periods of time, sometimes for an entire hour, \nby staff. Nevertheless, CYFD kept Kevin S. at this placement for a year. Plaintiff Chris W. was also \nrepeatedly restrained at his residential treatment center. \nC.  Inappropriate Placements for Children Covered by ICWA \n170.  CYFD has failed to place children covered by ICWA within its custody in the least \nrestrictive setting that approximates a family. In New Mexico, over 50% of the Native children in \nCYFD’s custody from 2010 to 2016 were cycled through two or more placements.44 By being \n                                                 \n39 N.M.

Further, though required to by law, CYFD has not put a preference on placing Indian \nchildren with a member of their family or with their tribe. “Having enough families to meet the \nintent of the Indian Child Welfare Act is a big problem,” according to the Director of CYFD’s \nProtective Services Division.45 CYFD cannot achieve such placement preferences because it has \nnot recruited enough tribe-approved foster parents or families that otherwise meet the placement \npreference categories.  \n172.  Governor Martinez conceded that “the state foster care system needs more Native \nAmerican foster families.”46 She acknowledged that as of 2012, CYFD had sixty-five Indian foster \nchildren in its custody in Bernalillo County, yet had only three Native foster families in that \ncounty.47 Further, CYFD only had two Native foster homes to serve the fifty-two Native foster \nchildren in San Juan County.48 Though there were seventy Native foster children in McKinley \nCounty, CYFD only had three Native licensed foster homes there in 2012, with another ten homes \n                                                 \n45 Dan Frosch, Focus on Preserving Heritage Can Limit Foster Care for Indians, N.Y.

In addition to having inadequate foster placements, ICWA protected children in \nCYFD’s custody are also “often . . . adopted by non-Native families,” according to the Director of \nCYFD’s Protective Services Division.51 Infrequent adoption of Native children by Native families \nis inconsistent with the intent of ICWA.  \nD.  Inadequate Support and Trainings for Foster Families or Relatives \n174.  When CYFD does place children with foster families, rather than at the CYFD \noffice, emergency short-term center, or a restrictive residential treatment center, it fails to provide \nfoster families with the support and trauma-informed trainings necessary to equip the foster parent \nto care for the child. As a result, foster parents often feel they cannot adequately meet a child’s \nmedical, mental health, and behavioral needs and have no choice but to request the child’s removal.  \n175.  For example, due to CYFD’s failure to provide the necessary support for Chris W.’s \nfoster parents, his foster parents requested he be removed. As a result, CYFD separated Chris W. \nfrom his siblings and cycled him through several short-term placements. Due to CYFD’s failures \nto provide Brian J.’s aunt with sufficient foster parent services, his aunt requested that he be \nremoved on an emergency basis. CYFD separated Brian J. from his siblings and placed him back \nwith his mother, even though his Guardian ad Litem repeatedly expressed that this placement would \nharm Brian J.’s safety and well-being. While Brian J. was placed with his mother, CYFD again \n                                                 \n49 Id. \n50 The Annie E.

CYFD fails to provide adequate trauma-informed trainings and services even to \nthose foster parents who have explicitly requested them. Plaintiff Olivia L.’s aunt repeatedly \nrequested support services from CYFD but received none. After less than one month, Olivia L.’s \naunt requested that her niece be removed. Olivia L. was then cycled through multiple short-term \nshelters and was raped by two adults at one of those shelters. \nE.  School Disruption and Inappropriate Placements  \n177.  CYFD’s failure to understand the impact of trauma and separation on children is \ndemonstrated by its failure to keep children in their home schools, despite its legal obligations to \nmaintain school placements. CYFD’s placement practices make staying in the same school nearly \nimpossible. In the 2013-14 school year, 26% of children in protective services custody were in more \nthan one school district and 55% experienced one or more withdrawals.52 Since entering CYFD \ncustody in November 2016, Matty B. has been cycled through five placements and three schools, \nsometimes changing schools in the middle of the semester. Plaintiff Diana D. has not earned a single \nhigh school credit in a year as a result of CYFD cycling her through at least eleven placements in \nunder two years.  \n178.  Although complex trauma impacts learning, CYFD fails to address children’s needs \nfor services and support in school. Even when children have known learning needs, CYFD routinely \nfails to identify children who need an IEP, notify a child’s new school that he or she qualifies for \n                                                 \n52 FosterEd New Mexico, Building Champions for System-Involved Students: FosterEdProgress \nUpdate, FosterEd 3 (Feb. 23, 2018), http://foster-ed.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FosterEd-\nNM-Progress-Update.pdf”(hereinafter “Building Champions”). \n \n  62 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 63 of 95\nspecial education services, or ensure that children’s IEPs are followed.53 Plaintiff Justin B. was \nevaluated for an IEP only after his foster mother urged the school to evaluate him. He qualified for \nservices due to a developmental delay in his fine motor skills and sensory processing. CYFD failed \nto ensure that Brian J., Elliot J., and Diana D., all of whom have had IEPs for years, were provided \nIEPs when they changed schools.  \nIV.  NEW MEXICO’S SYSTEM OF CHILD WELFARE IS UNDERSTAFFED \nAND LACKS NECESSARY EXPERTISE.  \n179.  New Mexico’s system of child welfare lacks the capacity to provide necessary \nsupport  and  training  to  foster  children,  foster  families,  and  relatives  because  it  is  woefully \nunderstaffed, does not have sufficient mental health services capacity and expertise in-house, and \nfails to properly train and support its staff. \nA.  CYFD’s System Lacks Internal Expertise and Does Not Provide \nSufficient Staff Trainings or Support \n \n180.  CYFD has recognized the need to appropriately train staff and address the impact of \ntrauma on children and secondary trauma on staff members in particular.54 Yet it has wholly failed \nto do so. CYFD does not provide or require its staff to participate in comprehensive, ongoing, in-\nperson trainings on trauma, secondary-trauma, compassion fatigue, or self-care. Rather, CYFD \noccasionally provides trauma-related trainings, some of which last only one hour, are offered only \nonline, and only to some staff members.55 CYFD’s current trainings are not mandatory and are not \navailable to foster parents, kinship caregivers and birth parents. The core of a trauma-informed child \n                                                 \n 53 The statewide special education participation rate was 13.9 and the rate for protective services \ninvolved students was 31.3%.

Research has demonstrated that, without appropriate support and training, social \nworkers and other service providers working closely with traumatized children may experience \ncompassion fatigue,56 secondary traumatic stress (or “vicarious trauma”), and burnout.57 Work-\nrelated exposure to the trauma of others can manifest in the same symptoms exhibited by those who \nendured  the  underlying  trauma—including  physical  distress,  fatigue,  difficulty  sleeping, \ndetachment, numbness, despair, depression, anxiety, increased irritability, intrusive thoughts, social \nwithdrawal, and diminished concentration.58 In the longer term, unaddressed secondary traumatic \nstress leads to burnout, “a state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion,” and increased \nturnover of service providers.59As a result, even dedicated CYFD staff may be less likely to remain \nin the job for long. At the end of fiscal year 2016, CYFD reported a 29.7 percent turnover rate for \nprotective services workers.60 In addition to being costly for the system, the turnover that can result \n                                                 \n56 Steven Hydon, Marleen Wong, et al., Preventing Secondary Traumatic Stress in Educators, 24 \nChild and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America 319, 321 (2015); Charles R.

Failure to Employ Sufficient Numbers of Staff \n182.  The number of personnel employed by Defendant CYFD is insufficient to meet \nCYFD legal obligations to children in state custody. Experts have established nationally recognized \nstandards for the maximum number of cases to be assigned to a single caseworker while still \nachieving effective and responsive services. Both the Child Welfare League of America, a coalition \nof private and public agencies that develops child welfare policies, and the Council on Accreditation \n(COA), an independent and nonprofit organization that publishes accreditation standards for state \nwelfare agencies, have established that caseloads should not exceed 15 children per caseworker for \npermanency planners62 or 12 children per caseworker for investigators.63 CYFD’s caseloads fail to \nmeet these national standards. \n183.  CYFD has admitted that high caseloads have resulted in failure to keep children safe \nfrom harm, failure to provide appropriate services, and/or failure to promptly identify a permanent \nplacement. For example, although New Mexico law requires that its caseworkers visit each of their \nchildren at least once every thirty days, 8.26.2.17 NMAC, as a result of high caseloads, CYFD \n                                                 \n61Maltreatment, supra note 29, at 3 (“It is paramount that we provide environments which are \nrelationally enriched, safe, predictable, and nurturing.

Caseworkers are not consistently engaging with \ncaregivers and children effectively in order to assess needs, case plan, provide services, and monitor \nprogress.”66  Finally,  CYFD  reports  that  “high”  caseloads  contributed  to  its  failure  to  attain \npermanency for 70% of children within 12 months of their entry into CYFD’s custody.67 Research \nhas likewise shown that high caseworker turnover is strongly correlated with children experiencing \nmultiple placements, receiving fewer services, staying in foster care longer, and failing to achieve \npermanency. \nV.  CYFD’S  AND  HSD’S  FAILURE  TO  ESTABLISH  AND  MAINTAIN  A \nSYSTEM  FOR  DELIVERY  OF  MEDICAL,  MENTAL  HEALTH,  AND \nBEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES CAUSES CHILDREN’S HEALTH TO \nDETERIORATE WHILE IN STATE CUSTODY. \n184.  CYFD and HSD have failed to put a system in place that would enable them to \nmeet their legal obligation to conduct comprehensive health screenings for children in state \ncustody and to promptly provide necessary and required services. CYFD’s and HSD’s failure to \nimplement a system of assessment, preventative care, and delivery of necessary and effective \nhome- and community-based services to identify and meet children’s needs early in the process \n                                                 \n64 Key Quarterly Performance Measures Report, supra note 54, at 13. \n65 Id. at 16. \n66 Id. at 18; see also N.M. Children Youth & Families Dep’t 2015–2019 Child and Family Services \nPlan at 24 (2014).  \n67 Key Quarterly Performance Measures Report, supra note 54, at 18. \n  66 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 67 of 95\nhas had devastating consequences for the mental health, safety, and well-being of Plaintiffs and \nmembers of the Classes.  \nA.  CYFD’s and HSD’s Failure to Adequately Screen for Trauma and \nMental and Behavioral Health Needs \n \n185.  When children enter state custody due to allegations of abuse and neglect, CYFD \nand HSD have no comprehensive, coordinated, or appropriate system for assessing their mental \nhealth needs. They routinely fail to conduct appropriate screening for mental health and behavioral \nhealth needs, including needs related to the impact of trauma. Although mental and behavioral \nhealth screenings should be conducted as soon as a child enters the child welfare system, CYFD \nand HSD have no system in place for ensuring these screenings occur promptly. The legally \nmandated comprehensive screening for EPSDT is required to include mental and behavioral health \nscreening, but often only consists of a basic health assessment. Without screening, CYFD and HSD \ncannot ensure that Plaintiffs and members of the Classes receive support and services that are \nessential to their health and well-being. \n186.  If and when children do receive a screening for mental and behavioral health, the \nscreening is not consistently conducted in a high-quality manner: screenings are not comprehensive, \nstandardized,  integrated  with  other  health  assessments,  and/or  conducted  by  qualified  and \nappropriately trained professionals. CYFD’s and HSD’s woefully insufficient screenings do not \ncomport with the prevailing standards of care for assessing trauma-impacted youth. The screenings \nprovide insufficient data to allow CYFD and HSD to identify children who need further assessment \n  67 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 68 of 95\nand intervention, to form the basis for a child’s treatment,68 or to meet an individual child’s trauma-\nrelated needs and mental, emotional, or behavioral disorders or conditions.  \n187.  Even if a child receives a proper mental and behavioral health screening under \nEPSDT,  and  even  if  the  screening  indicates  that  the  child  needs  a  full  neuropsychological \nevaluation, he or she will often wait an entire year to receive the evaluation. Plaintiffs Chris W., \nBrian J., Elliot J., and Michael J., for example, did not receive the required evaluations until they \nhad been in custody for eleven months or more. Diana D. did not receive a comprehensive mental \nor behavioral health evaluation when she entered state custody, and over a year later, is still on a \nwaitlist for a neuropsychological evaluation. \n188.  CYFD and HSD have no system in place to ensure ongoing monitoring of children’s \nmental and behavioral health needs, including assessment of complex trauma and psychotropic drug \nprescriptions. Both the Medicaid Act and evidence-based practices for trauma-informed care \nrequire screening and monitoring to be repeated, at prescribed intervals and after major events, such \nas a change in placement. But CYFD and HSD have no system in place for proactively identifying \nnew symptoms, assessing treatment progress, monitoring outcomes, or guiding case progress. \nInstead, changes to a child’s treatment are nearly exclusively made reactively, and typically under \ncrisis circumstances when the manifestations of ineffective and insufficient treatment plans emerge.  \n189.  CYFD and HSD overuse psychotropic drugs, which are not meant to be a long-term \ntreatment, to manage symptoms that escalate as a result of CYFD’s failure to provide adequate \nservices. CYFD and HSD lack a system for ongoing monitoring of the use of psychotropic \n                                                 \n68 The social worker assigned to children in CYFD custody must participate in the development of \nany behavioral health treatment plan. 8.320.2.15(c)(2)(c) NMAC.  \n \n  68 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 69 of 95\nmedication to ensure that children are not being over- or mis-medicated.69 For example, Diana D. \nwas prescribed at least nine different psychiatric medications by at least six different physicians in \na one-year period. \nB.  CYFD’s and HSD’s Failure to Ensure Delivery of Appropriate and \nCoordinated Mental and Behavioral Health Services \n \n190.  CYFD and HSD have failed to implement a system to ensure prompt delivery of \nappropriate and coordinated behavioral and mental health services to children in state custody. Even \nif such a system were implemented, CYFD and HSD have failed to ensure that an appropriate and \ncoordinated network of providers exists to deliver sufficient home and community-based mental \nhealth services to children in CYFD custody. As a result, many Plaintiffs and members of the \nClasses are not receiving necessary services, and the services that are delivered are inconsistent and \nuncoordinated, undermining their efficacy. \n191.  Decades of research and clinical experience have established that intensive home \nand community-based mental and behavioral health services are both successful and cost-effective. \nThey are a necessary treatment method for children with the most severe emotional and behavioral \nproblems.  Indeed,  in  recognition  of  the  superior  outcomes  achieved  by  offering  home-  and \ncommunity-based care options, New Mexico developed its Medicaid program “to maximize the \nincentives to support people in their homes and communities.”70 Yet despite the state’s obligation \n                                                 \n69 Children in foster care are more likely to be prescribed psychotropic drugs, some of which carry \nhigh-risk side-effects. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., Center for Medicaid and CHIP \nServices, Opinion Letter (July 11, 2013). These drugs may be overprescribed in the first instance \ndue to lack of appropriate screening, assessment, and treatment. Id. When prescribed, the use of \npsychotropic drugs should be justified by clinical evidence identified in screenings, mental health \nassessments, and the child’s treatment plan.  \n70 N.M. Human Servs. Dep’t, New Mexico’s Centennial Care, A Waiver Request Submitted Under \nthe Authority of Section 1115 of the Social Security Act, Apr. 25, 2012, at 14 (emphasis added) \n \n  69 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 70 of 95\nto ensure an adequate provider network exists to deliver necessary services, see 42 U.S.C. § 1396u-\n2(b)(5); 42 C.F.R. § 438.68, 8.308.2.9 NMAC, intensive home- and community-based mental and \nbehavioral health services are simply unavailable to Plaintiffs and members of the Classes. And \ndespite  the  requirements  that  services  be  delivered  with  reasonable  promptness,  even  in \nAlbuquerque, the largest city in the state, children requiring access linger on waiting lists for months \non end. Members of the Classes placed in rural areas of the state have even less access to necessary \nservices.  \n192.  Because of the lack of available home- and community-based mental and behavioral \nhealth services, many Plaintiffs and members of the Classes receive woefully insufficient services \nor do not receive these services at all. Services are denied even when screening identifies them as \nnecessary. For example, Jennifer H. was repeatedly denied the targeted analytic behavior therapy \nand structured peer interactions required by her psychological evaluation. Children living in rural \ncommunities outside of major cities have particular difficulty in securing services and appropriate \nevaluations because of the absence of providers in rural areas. \n193.  Further,  HSD’s  system  of  delivering  Medicaid  medical,  mental  health,  and \nbehavioral health services does not coordinate among service providers through a wraparound \nservices  model.  As  a  result,  the  limited  services  available  to  Plaintiffs  are  delivered  in  an \ninconsistent and uncoordinated manner, seriously undermining their effectiveness. For example, \nChris W. received no individual therapy until he had been in CYFD custody for nearly four months \nand, two years later, still has not received grief counseling after his mother’s death. Diana D. \n                                                 \n(hereinafter  “Waiver  Application”),  https://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-\nInformation/By-Topics/Waivers/1115/downloads/nm/Centennial-Care/nm-centennial-care-\nwaiver-reg-04252012.pdf.  \n  70 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 71 of 95\nreceived no services at all for her first month in custody and has since gone weeks at a time without \nany services. Plaintiffs Matty B. and Justin B. did not receive court-ordered family therapy with \ntheir parents until they had been in custody for two years. \n194.  CYFD also routinely fails to oversee children’s discharge from therapy. As a result, \nchildren  are  prematurely  discharged  from  therapy  while  in  CYFD  custody,  their  behavioral \nchallenges return and escalate, and that predictably results in their removal from their placements. \n195.  Overly restrictive placements exacerbate the physical, mental, and behavioral health \nchallenges that Plaintiffs and members of the Classes face.71 As HSD and CYFD have recognized, \n“residential treatment is a non-evidence based practice and the most costly behavioral health service \nfor children.”72 Placing children in residential facilities is not only ineffective, but also significantly \nmore expensive than providing appropriate home- and community-based care. \nVI.  TRAUMA-SENSITIVE PRACTICES IN SYSTEMS OF CHILD WELFARE \nARE EFFECTIVE AND NECESSARY. \n196.  In a child welfare system, in which every child has been impacted by trauma, \nmodification of the entire system is not only an effective means to address complex trauma \n                                                 \n71 New Mexico’s application stated that children and youth with Serious Emotional Disturbance \n(SED) were best served using a system of care approach. Waiver Application, id. at 18 (“Single \nservices (such as residential treatment or medication) provided in isolation with no linkage to other \nneeded services for severe or complex, chronic behavioral health disorders rarely leads to sustained \nand  stable  recovery  and  wellness.  These  isolated  services  can  paradoxically  exacerbate \nsymptomalogy and increase risk much as an inadequate dosage of antibiotics can greatly increase \nthe danger from infection.”) \n72 Results First, supra note 6, at 33 (collaboration between New Mexico Legislative Finance \nCommittee, HSD, and CYFD); see id. at 1 (“Forty-six percent of the state’s children’s behavioral \nhealth spending in 2015 was for acute out-of-home treatment without evidence of its effectiveness. \nGreater investment in prevention and early and community-based interventions, emphasizing \ncommunity-based  interventions,  is  needed  to  reduce  out-of-home  treatment  and  improve \noutcomes.”). \n \n  71 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 72 of 95\nexperienced by children, but is essential in order to meaningfully accommodate the effects of \ntrauma.  \n197.  Child welfare and mental health professionals have developed and implemented \nevidence-based, trauma-informed child welfare systems that successfully address the impact of \ntrauma on children in foster care.73 Effective, trauma-informed systems of child welfare share the \nfollowing core elements: (1) trauma-sensitive training for all involved adults; (2) screening for \ntrauma and prompt provision of appropriate, adequate, and coordinated behavioral and mental \nhealth services; (3) monitoring a child’s health and treatment; (4) ensuring appropriate placements \nand placement supports; and (5) implementing wraparound services. \n198.  Trauma-Sensitivity Training for Child Welfare Workforce and Families. The \ncore of a trauma-informed child welfare system is ongoing training for staff at all agency levels,74 \nincluding frontline staff, caseworkers, supervisors, administrators, and other staff, as well as foster \nparents,75 kinship caregivers and birth parents.76 Trauma-sensitive training should enable the adult \nworkforce to (1) recognize and understand trauma and its prevalence in the child welfare system, \n(2) implement proven trauma-focused responses to address the needs of individual children, \n                                                 \n73  See  The  Nat’l  Child  Traumatic  Stress  Network,  Creating  Trauma-Informed  Systems, \nhttps://www.nctsn.org/trauma-informed-care/creating-trauma-informed-systems  (last  visited \nJuly 18, 2018). \n74  Even  though  child  welfare  staff  may  not  be  responsible  for  delivering  trauma-informed \ninterventions, they must be able to appropriately assess and refer families to evidenced-based \ntreatment providers and they must be able to assess if interventions being delivered are having \npositive  outcomes.

Screening for Trauma, Assessing Functional and Mental Health, and Promptly \nProviding Appropriate, Adequate, and Coordinated Medical, Mental Health, and Behavioral \nHealth Services. Trauma-informed child welfare systems include a trauma screening, a functional \nassessment, and a mental health assessment for each child.78 Screenings and assessments should be \nperformed as soon as a child enters the child welfare system and should be integrated with other \ncomprehensive screenings, including medical screenings.79 Based on the results of the screenings \nand assessments, a child must promptly be provided with appropriate, adequate, and coordinated \nmedical, mental health, and behavioral health services.  \n200.  Ongoing Monitoring of a Child’s Health and Treatment. After the initial trauma \nscreening, screening should be repeated periodically, such as every six months or after major events \nsuch as a change in placement, in order to identify new symptoms and assess treatment progress.80 \nLikewise, trauma-informed systems must monitor the use of psychotropic medication to ensure that \nchildren are not being over or mis-medicated.  \n201.  Ensuring Appropriate Placements and Placement Supports. Trauma-informed \nsystems  also  provide  children  in  foster  care  with  safe,  stable,  and  ultimately  permanent \nplacements. This is necessary because multiple placements are especially harmful to children \nimpacted by complex trauma and disrupt their medical, mental health, and behavioral health \n                                                 \n77 Children’s Bureau, U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., Developing a Trauma-Informed Child \nWelfare System 4 (hereinafter “Developing a Trauma Informed Child Welfare System”) (2015).  \n78 Susan Ko et al., Creating Trauma-Informed Systems: Child Welfare, Education, First Responders, \nHealth Care, Juvenile Justice, 39 PROF.

Trauma-informed placements also provide children \nin foster care with the least restrictive placements that meet their individualized medical, mental \nhealth, and behavioral health needs. Placement stability should prioritize fewer placements and \nplacements that are closer to the child’s original home, school, and community. Services and \nsupports should be provided in a child’s own community and within their own culture.81 Services \nand supports should be provided in the family’s natural setting and children should not be forced to \nmove to receive a specific type of service.82 \n202.  Wraparound Services. A trauma-informed system should effectively coordinate \namong  providers  of  medical,  mental  health,  and  behavioral  health  care  services  through \nwraparound services. Children and families involved in foster care have complex needs and there \nare often multiple agencies and caregivers involved in each child’s care. The wraparound model \naddresses this challenge by creating a specific team for each child that includes his or her family, \nall other providers, as well as other natural supports that the family and youth may identify.83 The \nteam creates a plan for services together, ensures the provision of services, and adjusts the plan as \nneeded based on the changing needs of a child.84 The wraparound approach has shown positive \neffects for child outcomes and expenditure reduction in other states and a New Mexico legislative \nreport has noted the program’s efficacy.85 \nVII.  CYFD AND HSD ARE DELIBERATELY INDIFFERENT TO PLAINTIFFS’ \nRIGHTS.  \n                                                 \n81 Id. \n82 Id. \n83 Center for Health Care Strategies, Making Medicaid Work for Children in Child Welfare: Examples \nfrom the Field 10 (2013), https://www.chcs.org/media/Making_Medicaid_Work.pdf.  \n84 Id. at 10. \n85 Results First, supra note 6, at 30–31.  \n \n  74 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 75 of 95\n203.  For decades, Defendants have stood witness to the profound impacts that trauma has \non the mental, behavioral, and physical health of New Mexico’s foster care children. Current and \nformer CYFD and HSD leaders have repeatedly acknowledged the impact of trauma on the \nbehavioral and mental health of children, especially children in foster care.86 CYFD leaders have \nalso repeatedly acknowledged that their system is failing to meet the needs of children in its custody, \nfailing to meet federal standards,87 deteriorating in performance, and causing devastating harm to \nfoster children.  \n204.  In addition to making such public statements, CYFD and HSD have repeatedly been \nplaced on notice of the need to address trauma in the child welfare system and the impact of their \nfailure to do so. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act (CFSIA) requires \nstates to report on “how health needs identified through screenings will be monitored and treated, \nincluding emotional trauma associated with a child’s maltreatment and removal from home . . . .” \n42 U.S.C. § 622(b)(15)(A)(ii). The media has repeatedly covered CYFD’s and HSD’s failures and \nthe  harms  they  have  caused  children.88  Even  though  CYFD  and  HSD  have  repeatedly \nacknowledged their failures and have repeatedly been placed on notice of the harms their failures \nhave caused, they have not meaningfully addressed them. \n                                                 \n86 New Mexico Legislative Finance Committee, HSD, and CYFD, Building A Better Children’s \nBehavioral Health Care System 2, 3 (Jan. 11, 2018) (unpublished PowerPoint presentation).  \n87 Key Quarterly Performance Measures Report, supra note 54, at 20. \n88See, e.g., Ed Williams, A pattern of failures: Investigation reveals serious abuses within treatment \nfoster care system, Searchlight New Mexico (May 16, 2018), http://projects.searchlightnm.com/rnm-\nbreaking/treatment-foster-care/; Ed Williams, From foster care to youth advocate: After passing \nthrough more foster homes than he can count, Albuquerque man works to help others, Searchlight \nNew  Mexico,  http://projects.searchlightnm.com/rnm-breaking/treatment-foster-care-qna/,  (last \nvisited July 18, 2018); Cynthia Miller, Foster care survivors fight to improve the system, SANTA FE \nNEW MEXICAN (July 16, 2016), http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/foster-care-\nsurvivors-fight-to-improve-the-system/article_1eb904ae-52b6-596e-9af3-304a3d2a8206.html.  \n \n  75 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 76 of 95\n205.  CYFD has also repeatedly acknowledged in its annual reports that it has failed to \nmeet the needs of children in its custody, citing the very deprivations at issue in this complaint, \nincluding: \n•  the failure to meet the federal standard regarding placement moves per 1,000 days \nof foster care for children entering foster care in a twelve-month period due to “the number of \navailable foster families…and the array of services available to meet the needs of foster children”;89 \n•  that children are “frequently” placed in “short term emergency placements at the \ntime of removal,”90 including CYFD offices, and the need to “[d]evelop crisis continuum services \nto avoid overnight stays in CYFD offices”91; \n•  regional disparities in stability of placements.92 For example, compared to the state \naverage of 3.0 placement moves per 1,000 days in care, as of the second quarter of 2018, that \naverage  was  double  or  nearly  double  in  several  regions,  including  Chaves  (7.3  moves), \nColfax/Union (5.9 moves), and Curry (5.8 moves);93 \n•  an overall lack of an “array of services available to meet the needs of foster \nchildren”94 and the need “to increase trauma-informed practices in all levels of care”95 and “to \n                                                 \n89 Key Quarterly Performance Measures Report, supra note 54, at 20.  \n90 Id.  \n91 CYFD, Annual Report and Strategic Plan, Fiscal Year 2017 at 21 (N.M. 2017). \n92 See generally Children Youth & Families Dep’t Protective Servs., 360 Quarterly State and County \nProfiles, 2d Quarter, Fiscal Year 2018 (N.M. 2018).  \n93 See id. at 44, 78, 83. \n94 Key Quarterly Performance Measures Report, supra note 54, at 11.  \n95  CYFD,  Annual  Report  and  Strategic  Plan,  Fiscal  Year  2017  at  21  (N.M.  2017), \nhttps://cyfd.org/docs/fy17_annual_report_final.pdf. \n \n  76 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 77 of 95\nincrease capacity to provide wraparound services targeting CYFD-involved youth in or at risk of \nout-of-home placements”;96 \n•  the need to reduce protective services worker caseloads, both to “[m]inimize further \nharm to children and youth” and to reduce the staff turnover rate;97 \n•  that protective services worker retention is a “key challenge” and requires trainings \nthat “address[] secondary trauma”;98 and  \n•  the need to “[t]ighten financial controls to ensure that funds are monitored and \nallocated to reduce waste and improve the quality of life of our clients.”99 \n206.  Defendant  Monique  Jacobson,  CYFD’s  Cabinet  Secretary,  acknowledged  that \nchildren are placed overnight in the CYFD office, stating, “We all agree that should never happen. \nBut the fact of the matter is, it does happen.”100 A year later, Jacobson was quoted about the same \nissue, stating that, “I can’t tell you with confidence that we will always be able to find a placement \nfor a child before the sun sets.”101 In 2017, the Albuquerque Journal reported that to address safety \nconcerns associated with children staying overnight at their office, CYFD implemented new safety \nmeasures, including having workers “wear devices to call 911 in case of emergency in the office” \nand “when children spend the night, usually two employees will watch them.”102 Jacobson also \n                                                 \n96 Id.  \n97 Id. at 15–16.  \n98 Key Quarterly Performance Measures Report, supra note 54, at 14.  \n99 Id. at 15.  \n100 Id. \n101 Colleen Heild, Some Troubled Kids in NM Have No Place to Go, ALBUQUERQUE J.

CYFD has acknowledged that its performance is deteriorating. In the first quarter of \n2012, 17.5% of children in foster care for up to twelve months had three or more placements.104 In \nthe first quarter of 2017, that number was over 27%.105 \n208.  CYFD and HSD have also acknowledged that trauma-informed wraparound and \ncommunity-based services are effective and have made it a goal “to increase capacity to provide \nwraparound services targeting CYFD-involved youth in or at risk of out-of-home placements.”106  \n209.  Notwithstanding these deficiencies CYFD has acknowledged, CYFD has failed to \nspend funds that had been allocated or appropriated for implementation of programs to improve \nservices for children in its custody.107 \n210.  HSD officials have acknowledged that PTSD is the most expensive child behavioral \nhealth disorder in New Mexico and that residential treatment centers are the highest cost service for \nchildren, making up 22% of the of the state’s expenditures on children’s behavioral health.108 \nNonetheless, HSD and CYFD continue to ignore early intervention community-based treatments \nthat would prevent delayed, acute intervention from being necessary, save individual children the \npain of unaddressed medical, mental health, and behavioral health issues, and save the state money.  \n                                                 \n103 Cynthia Miller, CYFD Struggles To Create Child Wellness Center Continue, SANTA FE NEW \nMEXICAN (Mar. 16, 2017), http://www.santafenewmexican.com/life/family/cyfd-struggles-to-create-\nchild-wellness-centercontinue/article_56d09ec6-ec7d-5d27-ba7c-ccdc19ac5601.html. \n104 CYFD Protective Services, 360 Yearly State Fiscal Year 2017, 14 (2017).  \n105 Id.  \n106 2017 Annual Report and Strategic Plan, supra note 95, at 21; Results First, supra note 6, at 40.  \n107 See, e.g., Dan Boyd, CYFD Returned $6.6 Million of Budgeted Funds, ALBUQUERQUE J.

THIS ACTION CANNOT BE BROUGHT IN THE CHILDREN’S COURT \nAND IT DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH THE CHILDREN’S COURT \nJURISDICTION.  \n211.  Plaintiffs in this action do not challenge or seek to enjoin the Children’s Court’s \ncustody determinations. Plaintiffs in particular do not request any relief that would restrain the \nability of the Children’s Court to temporarily or permanently remove a child from the custody of \nparents or guardians. Plaintiffs instead challenge the unlawful systemic practices of CYFD and \nHSD officials, practices that the Children’s Court is incapable of remedying.  \n212.  The systemic issues alleged in this complaint are ones that cannot be remedied in \nthe Children’s Court, either because State law bars the interposition of Plaintiffs’ claims in \nChildren’s Court or because the systemic nature of the claims and remedies renders the Children’s \nCourt an inadequate forum.  \n213.  “[T]he children’s court is only permitted to do what is specifically authorized by the \nCode.” State of N.M. ex rel. CYFD v. Paul G., 2006-NMCA-038, ¶15, 139 N.M. 258 (internal \nquotation and citation omitted). The Children’s Code does not authorize the Children’s Court to: \n•  order CYFD to recruit and license the necessary number of foster care placements \nin New Mexico;  \n•  require CYFD to secure an adequate array of services for children in its custody; \n•  mandate that CYFD identify family members or recruit an adequate number of tribe-\naffiliated or approved foster families for children covered by ICWA; \n•  assess the appropriate level of CYFD staffing or to order CYFD to employ more \ncaseworkers or other employees; \n•  order CYFD or HSD to change its policies and practices. \n214.  Nor is the Children’s Court able to: \n  79 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 80 of 95\n•  order  CYFD  to  place  children,  including  children  covered  by  ICWA,  in  less \nrestrictive placements when such placements, because of the Defendants’ failures, are unavailable; \n•  order  CYFD  or  HSD  to  provide  services  that  they  have  not  made  available, \nincluding,  but  not  limited  to,  ICWA-required  remedial  services  and  rehabilitation  programs \ndesigned to prevent the breakup of Indian families; \n•  remedy CYFD and HSD’s failure to put in place processes and services sufficient to \nprovide for the needs of Plaintiffs and similarly situated children and to comply with their \nobligations under federal law.  \n215.  Even if these issues were not systemic, CYFD’s practices render the Children’s \nCourt an inadequate forum to remedy CYFD’s failures even in individual cases. This is true for \nmultiple reasons:  \n•  First, CYFD routinely engages in emergency placement changes that do not result \nin advance notice to the Children’s Court or to a child’s Guardian ad Litem or youth attorney; \nlacking notice, there is no opportunity to contest the move before it occurs.  \n•  Second, even when placement changes are not made on an emergency basis, CYFD \nattorneys regularly fail to timely file notices of change of placement. As a result, guardians ad litem \nand youth attorneys do not learn about placement changes until weeks later, when it is too late to \nadvocate against that change in placement without running the risk that such a motion, even if \nsuccessful, will only uproot the child again, thereby inflicting more trauma.  \n•  Third, because there are insufficient quality placements in New Mexico to meet the \nneeds of all children in the foster care system, if and when the Children’s Court does order CYFD \nto alter a specific placement decision, even if that new placement proves adequate for that child, it \nlimits placement options for other children.  \n  80 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 81 of 95\n216.  The remedies Plaintiffs seek to address CYFD’s failures will promote, not interfere \nwith, the Children’s Court’s ability to exercise its jurisdiction. By requiring CYFD to secure more \nplacement options, Plaintiffs’ requested relief will afford the Children’s Court more options and \nflexibility when it concludes that CYFD has abused its discretion in a particular placement decision. \nSimilarly, remediation of CYFD’s inadequate staffing levels will promote, not interfere with, the \nChildren’s Court’s ability to exercise its jurisdiction under the Children’s Code. CYFD’s employees \nplay critical roles in the custody adjudication process that is the responsibility of the Children’s \nCourt. These staffing shortages necessarily limit the quantity and quality of information that CYFD \ncan gather and provide to the Children’s Court in making its custody determinations and thereby \ndirectly interfere with the Children’s Court’s ability to exercise its jurisdiction. Likewise, the \ntraining Plaintiffs seek through this action will promote the Children’s Court’s ability to perform \nits statutorily authorized functions. When CYFD staff suffer from burnout, exhaustion, and high \nrates of turnover, they are less able to assist the Children’s Court in providing the information that \nit needs to function effectively.  \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Against All Defendants for Violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act) \n217.  Plaintiffs hereby re-allege and incorporate by reference the foregoing paragraphs of \nthis Complaint as though fully set forth herein.  \n218.  Under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, “[n]o otherwise qualified individual \nwith a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation \nin, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under . . . any program or activity \nreceiving federal financial assistance….” 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n  81 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 82 of 95\n219.  A “program or activity” includes “all of the operations of a department…of a State.” \nId. § 794(b)(1)(A). \n220.  CYFD  and  HSD  receive  federal  funds  and  are  therefore  covered  by  the \nRehabilitation Act. \n221.  As children in the custody of the State of New Mexico who have been adjudicated \nabused, abandoned or neglected, Plaintiffs and members of the Classes are eligible for the public \nbenefit of the New Mexico child welfare system and Medicaid. \n222.  For purposes of the Rehabilitation Act, an “individual with a disability” is defined \nas it is in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”). See 29 U.S.C. § 794(a); 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12101 et seq.  \n223.  The definition of “disability” under the ADA is a “physical or mental impairment \nthat substantially limits one or more life activities,” including, but not limited to, “caring for oneself, \nperforming manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, \nspeaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working.” 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 12102(1)(A), (2)(A) (emphasis added).  \n224.  The effects of complex trauma cause impairment that limits a child’s ability to \nperform major life activities including eating, sleeping, concentrating, thinking, communicating, \nlearning,  emotional-self  regulation,  setting  goals,  and  long-term  planning,  and  major  bodily \nfunctions of the brain, neurological, and endocrine systems. \n225.  Plaintiffs and members of the Classes have experienced complex trauma and its \neffects,  substantially  limiting  them  with  regard  to  eating,  sleeping,  concentrating,  thinking, \ncommunicating, learning, emotional-self regulation, setting goals, and long-term planning, and \nmajor bodily functions of the brain, neurological, and endocrine systems. Plaintiffs therefore meet \n  82 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 83 of 95\nthe definition of “individuals with disabilities” within the meaning of the Act and are entitled to \n“meaningful access” to the benefits, services, and programs provided by CYFD and the benefits, \nservices, and programs established, administered, supervised, and provided for by HSD through its \nMedicaid program. \n226.  Solely by reason of their exposure to complex trauma and its effects, each of the \nPlaintiffs and members of the Classes have been denied meaningful access to the New Mexico child \nwelfare system. Complex trauma impairs a child’s ability to meaningfully access the benefits of the \nfoster care and Medicaid systems where reasonable accommodations have not been made for \nchildren impacted by complex trauma.  \n227.  There  are  effective  and  reasonable  accommodations  that  Defendants  could \nimplement that would create a trauma-informed child welfare system that would allow Plaintiffs \nand members of the Classes to enjoy the benefits of the foster care and Medicaid systems. Examples \ninclude trauma-sensitive training for all staff; screening children for trauma; promptly providing \nappropriate, adequate and coordinated medical, behavioral health, and mental health services; \nmonitoring  a  child’s  health  and  treatment;  ensuring  appropriate  placements  and  placements \nsupports; and providing wraparound services.  \n228.  Defendants have failed to implement reasonable accommodations that would allow \nmembers of the Classes to receive the benefits of the child welfare system offered by Defendants. \n229.  Defendants have also engaged in acts or omissions that inflict and exacerbate \ncomplex trauma on children in New Mexico’s child welfare system. For example, Defendants have \nrepeatedly transferred children between placements, many of which are overly restrictive, remote, \nand/or utilize inappropriate physical and chemical restraints. These acts can and do create trauma \nfor children in CYFD’s custody who are enrolled in or are eligible for HSD’s Medicaid program. \n  83 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 84 of 95\nThis trauma in turn can result in disabilities that interfere with these children’s ability to access \nfoster care and Medicaid services. CYFD’s and HSD’s failure to accommodate the very disability \nthey helped facilitate constitutes discrimination on the basis of disability. \n230.  Because of these acts and omissions, the Plaintiffs and members of the Classes have \nbeen denied the benefits of New Mexico’s child welfare and Medicaid systems solely on the basis \nof their disability. \n231.  Plaintiffs and members of Classes are entitled to appropriate relief. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Against All Defendants for Discrimination Under the Americans with  \nDisabilities Act of 1990) \n232.  Plaintiffs hereby re-allege and incorporate by reference the foregoing paragraphs of \nthis Complaint as though fully set forth herein. \n233.  Under Title II of the ADA, “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason \nof such disability, be excluded from participation in, or be denied the benefits of the services, \nprograms, or activities of a public entity, or subjected to discrimination by any such entity.” 42 \nU.S.C. § 12132. \n234.  CYFD and HSD are public entities under Title II of the ADA.  \n235.  As children in the custody of the State of New Mexico who have been adjudicated \nabused, abandoned or neglected, Plaintiffs and members of the Classes are eligible for the public \nbenefits of the New Mexico child welfare system and New Mexico’s Medicaid system. \n236.  The definition of “disability” is a “physical or mental impairment that substantially \nlimits one or more life activities,” including, but not limited to, “caring for oneself, performing \nmanual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, \n  84 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 85 of 95\nbreathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working.” 42 U.S.C. \n§§ 12102(1)(A), (2)(A) (emphasis added).  \n237.  The effects of complex trauma cause impairment that limits a child’s ability to \nperform major life activities including eating, sleeping, concentrating, thinking, communicating, \nlearning,  emotional-self  regulation,  setting  goals,  and  long-term  planning,  and  major  bodily \nfunctions of the brain, neurological, and endocrine systems. \n238.  Plaintiffs and members of the Classes have experienced complex trauma and its \neffects,  substantially  limiting  them  with  regard  to  eating,  sleeping,  concentrating,  thinking, \ncommunicating, learning, emotional-self regulation, setting goals, and long-term planning, and \nmajor bodily functions of the brain, neurological, and endocrine systems. \n239.  Solely by reason of their exposure to complex trauma and its effects, each of the \nPlaintiffs and members of the Classes have been denied meaningful access to the New Mexico \nfoster care and Medicaid systems. Complex trauma impairs a child’s ability to meaningfully access \nthe benefits of the child welfare system where reasonable accommodations have not been made for \nchildren impacted by complex trauma.  \n240.  There  are  effective  and  reasonable  accommodations  that  Defendants  could \nimplement that would create a trauma-informed child welfare system and would allow Plaintiffs \nand members of the Classes to enjoy the benefits of the child welfare system. Examples include \ntrauma-sensitive  training  for  all  staff;  screening  children  for  trauma;  promptly  providing \nappropriate, adequate and coordinated medical, mental health, and behavioral health services; \nmonitoring  a  child’s  health  and  treatment;  ensuring  appropriate  placements  and  placements \nsupports; and providing wraparound services.  \n  85 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 86 of 95\n241.  Defendants have failed to implement reasonable accommodations that would allow \nmembers of the Classes to receive the benefits of the child welfare system offered by Defendants. \n242.  Defendants have also engaged in acts or omissions that inflict and exacerbate \ncomplex trauma on children in New Mexico’s child welfare system. \n243.  Because of this failure, the Plaintiffs and members of the Classes have been denied \nthe benefits of adequate foster care and Medicaid services solely on the basis of their disability. \n244.  Plaintiffs and members of the Classes are entitled to appropriate relief. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Against All Defendants for Unlawful Segregation Under Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990)  \n \n245.  Plaintiffs hereby re-allege and incorporate by reference the foregoing paragraphs of \nthis Complaint as though fully set forth herein. \n246.  CYFD and HSD receive federal financial assistance. \n247.  CYFD and HSD are public entities under title II of the Americans with Disabilities \nAct. \n248.  Complying with the state’s Medicaid obligations to provide prompt and adequate \nscreening, treatment,  and monitoring of medical, mental, and behavioral health issues is, at \nminimum, a reasonable modification and indeed is independently required by the Medicaid Act. \n249.  Defendants have failed to administer services, programs and activities in the most \nintegrated setting appropriate to the needs of children in CYFD’s custody. 28 C.F.R. §35.130(d).  \n250.  Plaintiffs and members of the Classes have been placed in unduly restrictive settings, \ndespite their ability to benefit more from treatment in a less restrictive setting.  \n  86 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 87 of 95\n251.  Both Section 504 and the ADA prohibit unjustified segregation of persons with \ndisabilities. See 29 U.S.C. § 794; 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101(a)(2), (a)(5). This means that the state must \nprovide appropriate community based treatment services. Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 \nU.S. 581, 602 (1999). \n252.  Unjustified segregation, in the form of treatment settings that severely limit the \nexposure of persons to the outside community, constitutes discrimination on the basis of disability. \nId. at 597. \n253.  The segregation of children in the CYFD system into environments that are more \nrestrictive than necessary constitutes discrimination as defined in Olmstead under both Section II \nof the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  \n254.  Defendants have discriminated against Plaintiffs by denying them the opportunity \nto participate in CYFD’s and HSD’s foster care and Medicaid programs and services; and aiding \nand perpetuating discrimination by assisting other Defendant agencies in discriminating against \nPlaintiffs. 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1). \n255.  Defendants have further discriminated against Plaintiffs in violation of the ADA by \nutilizing criteria or methods of administration that have the effect of (i) subjecting Plaintiffs to \ndiscrimination  on  the  basis  of  disability;  (ii)  substantially  impairing  accomplishment  of  the \nobjectives of CYFD’s foster care program and HSD’s Medicaid program; and (iii) perpetuating \ndiscrimination by other Defendant agencies subject to common administrative control. 28 C.F.R. \n§ 35.130(b)(3).  \n256.  Plaintiffs and members of the Classes are entitled to appropriate relief. \n  87 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 88 of 95\nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Against All Defendants for Violation of Substantive Due Process under the 14th \nAmendment to the United States Constitution)  \n \n257.  Plaintiffs hereby re-allege and incorporate by reference the foregoing paragraphs of \nthis Complaint as though fully set forth herein. \n258.  Defendants have restrained Plaintiffs’ personal liberty by taking these minors into \nstate custody, assuming responsibility for their safety and general well-being, and thereby rendering \nthem wholly dependent on Defendants. \n259.  Defendants,  while  acting  under  color  of  law,  have  developed  and  maintained \ncustoms, policies, and practices that deprive children who have experienced complex trauma of \ntheir constitutional rights, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983, by failing to provide them with basic \nneeds, including adequate and appropriate medical care and services; conditions of confinement \nthat are reasonably related to the purpose of their custody; reasonable care and safety; and freedom \nfrom an unreasonable risk of harm. CYFD’s and HSD’s practices have caused Plaintiffs’ conditions \nto deteriorate and have subjected them to unsafe conditions and psychological and physical harm, \nin violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Whitley v. New Mexico \nChildren, Youth & Families Dep’t, 184 F. Supp. 2d 1146, 1155 (D.N.M. 2001) (citing DeShaney v. \nWinnebago Cty. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 199–200 (1989)). \n260.  As set forth above, Defendants have acted with deliberate indifference towards \nPlaintiffs. CYFD’s and HSD’s own statements, and the various publications that have put them on \nnotice, establish that Defendants know of the danger to Plaintiffs. In failing to address Plaintiffs’ \ncomplex trauma and in taking actions that worsen Plaintiffs’ complex trauma, Defendants have \nabdicated their duty to act professionally and have thereby caused Plaintiffs’ injuries. \n  88 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 89 of 95\n261.  Plaintiffs and members of the Classes are entitled to appropriate relief. \nFIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Against All Defendants for Violation of the Medicaid Act, Early and Periodic \nScreening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) Services, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq.) \n \n262.  Plaintiffs hereby re-allege and incorporate by reference the foregoing paragraphs of \nthis Complaint as though fully set forth herein. \n263.  Defendants,  while  acting  under  color  of  law,  have  developed  and  maintained \ncustoms, polices, and practices that deprive Plaintiffs and members of the Classes of statutory \nrights, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq. Defendants have failed to provide or otherwise \narrange for early screening and diagnostic services that would determine the existence of any \nphysical  or  mental  illnesses  or  conditions,  in  violation  of  42  U.S.C.  §§ 1396a(a)(10)(A), \n1396a(a)(43)(B),  1396d(a)(4)(B),  and  1396d(r)(1)(A).  Defendants  have  failed  to  arrange  for \nnecessary mental and behavioral health services, including intensive, community, and home-based \nmental  health  services,  that  would  treat  or  ameliorate  their  physical  or  mental  illnesses  or \nconditions, in violation of 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(10)(A), 1396a(a)(43)(C),), 1396d(r)(5).  \n264.  Plaintiffs and members of the Classes are entitled to appropriate relief. \nSIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Against All Defendants for Violation of the Medicaid Act, Reasonable Promptness \nProvision, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8)).  \n \n265.  Plaintiffs hereby re-allege and incorporate by reference the foregoing paragraphs of \nthis Complaint as though fully set forth herein. \n266.  The Medicaid Act requires states to provide EPSDT services to Medicaid-eligible \nchildren under the age of 21 with “reasonable promptness.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8). Defendants \nhave failed to furnish required medical services with reasonable promptness. \n  89 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 90 of 95\n267.  Plaintiffs and members of the Classes are entitled to appropriate relief. \nSEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Against All Defendants for Violation of the Indian Child Welfare Act, U.S.C. \n§ 1915(a) & (b)).  \n \n268.  Plaintiffs hereby re-allege and incorporate by reference the foregoing paragraphs of \nthis Complaint as though fully set forth herein. \n269.  The Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) requires that children covered by ICWA who \nare in foster care receive placements in a least restrictive setting that approximates a family. 25 \nU.S.C. § 1915(b). ICWA also requires that covered children receive preferred placements – for both \npre-adoption and adoption – in Indian foster homes or settings approved by the Indian child’s tribe. \n25 U.S.C. § 1915(a), (b).  \n270.  ICWA defines “Indian child” to mean “any unmarried person who is under the age \neighteen and is either (a) a member of an Indian tribe or (b) is eligible for membership in an Indian \ntribe and is the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe.” 25 U.S.C. § 1903(4). Defendants \nhave failed to promptly identify which children in state custody qualify as Indian children for \npurposes of ICWA.  \n271.  Defendants have denied Sub-Class members access to the least restrictive setting \nthat approximates a family by pushing a majority of the children in CYFD’s custody through \nmultiple placements.  \n272.  Defendants have failed  to have a system of services and supports capable of \nproviding remedial services and rehabilitation programs designed to prevent the breakup of Indian \nfamilies as required by ICWA. 25 U.S.C. §1912(d) \n  90 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 91 of 95\n273.  Defendants have also denied Sub-Class members of the legally preferred pre-\nadoptive placements by failing to acquire an adequate number of tribe-affiliated or approved foster \nfamilies, failing to make appropriate efforts to coordinate with tribes to recruit and support \nplacements, and failing to promptly identify family members or appropriate tribal placements.  \n274.  Defendants have further denied Sub-Class members the legally preferred adoptive \nplacements by too often facilitating the adoption of Indian children by non-Native families.  \n275.  Plaintiffs and members of the Classes are entitled to appropriate relief. \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request the following relief:  \n1.  A determination by this Court that this action may be maintained as a class action. \n2.  Injunctive relief requiring Defendants to implement reasonable accommodations in \nthe form of trauma-sensitive policies and procedures that will allow the members of the Classes an \nopportunity to meaningfully access the child welfare system, including, but not limited to: \na.  Providing mandatory, ongoing trauma-sensitive training for all health care \nproviders, foster care parents, respondents, Guardians ad litem, Youth Attorneys, and CYFD and \nHSD staff to enable them to (1) be aware of the prevalence and impact of complex trauma in foster \ncare children, (2) understand and respond appropriately to the needs of individual children impacted \nby complex trauma, (3) know agency policy and procedures supporting trauma-informed care, \n(4) create a safe, positive, stable environment in a child’s placement, (5) deliver proven trauma \ninterventions that reduce the impact of complex trauma on children and avoid re-traumatization and \n(6) understand and respond appropriately to their own secondary trauma to reduce workforce \nburnout and turnover; \n  91 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 92 of 95\nb.  Conducting  trauma-informed  screening  for  medical,  mental  health,  and \nbehavioral needs and prompt establishment and provision of appropriate, accessible, adequate, and \ncoordinated medical, mental health, and behavioral health services;  \nc.  Monitoring children’s health and treatment, including periodic functional \nassessments, providing new assessments whenever a child’s placement is changed, and monitoring \nthe use of psychotropic medications; \nd.  Ensuring children are placed in safe and stable placements that are the least \nrestrictive appropriate to their needs, including, but not limited to, ensuring children are not placed \nin CYFD offices; prioritizing keeping sibling groups together and keeping children geographically \nclose to their home communities; eliminating the practice of placing children in multiple short-term \nplacements; enhancing permanency placing; and recruiting, training, and supporting an array of \nappropriate foster placements that meet the individualized behavioral, cultural and mental health \nneeds of children; \ne.  Complying  with  their  obligations  under  ICWA,  including  acquiring  an \nadequate number of tribe-affiliated or approved foster families, making appropriate efforts to \ncoordinate with tribes to recruit and support placements, promptly identifying children covered by \nICWA and family members or appropriate tribal placements, facilitating legally preferred adoptive \nplacements, and providing a system of services and supports capable of providing remedial services \nand rehabilitation programs designed to prevent the breakup of Indian families,  \nf.  Establishing  and  implementing  coordinated,  statewide  individualized \nservices in the least restrictive environment, including but not limited to the provision of intensive \ncommunity based services and needed wraparound services;  \n  92 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00896   Document 1   Filed 09/22/18   Page 93 of 95\ng.  Ensuring  CYFD  and  HSD  have  sufficient  capacity  to  meet  children’s \nmedical, mental health, and behavioral needs so that medically necessary services for children are \navailable, appropriate, accessible, individualized and promptly delivered; and  \nh.  Ensuring CYFD and HSD coordinate in fulfilling their obligations under the \nlaw and the prayed relief.  \n3.  A declaration that Defendants, through their actions and omissions and policies and \nprocedures complained of, violate: \na.  The Substantive Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution;  \nb.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act; \nc.  The Americans with Disabilities Act; \nd.

The Reasonable Promptness Provision of the Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396a(a)(8)); \nf.  The Indian Child Welfare Act, U.S.C. § 1915(b)). \n4.  An award of costs and attorney’s fees and expenses pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 794a, \n42 U.S.C. § 1988, and any other applicable provisions of law. \n5.
