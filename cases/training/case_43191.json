    "summary": "<p>This is a case about the administration of child welfare. &nbsp;On September 30, 2019, twelve named plaintiffs, all children in the custody of West Virginia's Department of Health and Human Resources (DHHR), brought a class action complaint against the Governor of West Virginia Jim Justice, as well as the Cabinet Secretary for the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), the Deputy Secretary for the West Virginia DHHS, and the Commissioner for Bureau of Children and Families (BCF) Linda Watts, and West Virginia DHHS. Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia the plaintiffs sued under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 670 et seq. (Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (CWA)), 42 U.S.C. &sect; 12132 (Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)), and 29 U.S.C. &sect; 701 (Rehabilitation Act). The complaint alleged failure to provide reasonable care and protect from harm the foster children in violation of their Fourteenth Amendment due process protections. It further deniedfurther, denying the right of familial association and protection from psychological harm in violation of their First Amendment right of association, Ninth Amendment reservation of rights to the people, and Fourteenth Amendment&rsquo;s substantive due process protections, the failure to provide a written case plan for the benefit of the foster children and parents in violation of the CWA, and failure to provide adequate services to disabled children in violation of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the systematic deficiencies they alleged. The case was assigned to Judge Robert C. Chambers, then reassigned to Chief Judge Thomas E. Johnston.</p>\r\n<p>In the complaint, plaintiffs alleged they faced repeated maltreatment due to a lack of protection while in state custody, faced discrimination due to disability, and failure to be placed in the least restrictive environment that has resulted in emotional and physical harms. Children in DHHR custody were moved between foster homes repeatedly and in short timespans and provided with inadequate mental and emotional health support. Plaintiffs sought injunctive relief that DHHR complete a needs assessment and care plan for children placed in their custody to determine if the child has disabilities and how to meet their needs, ensure adequate DHHR staffing and training of support staff, place disabled children in the most integrated setting and provide therapeutic services, and continue to meet the needs of children approaching adulthood in DHHR custody.</p>\r\n<p>On September 2, 2020, plaintiffs sought class certification of one class and three subclasses, including the Kinship Subclass, the ADA Subclass, and the Aging Out Subclass. The general class included all West Virginia foster children. The Kinship Subclass included children who \"are or will be in kinship placements, or who were in kinship placements that unnecessarily disrupted...case management and other services, and permanency planning\"; the ADA subclass included children who \"have physical, intellectual, cognitive, or mental health disabilities\"; and the Aging Out Subclass included children who \"are or will be fourteen years or older, who are eligible to receive age-appropriate transition planning...\".&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Throughout the litigation, each of the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. The defendants argued that the six plaintiffs' claims were moot and that they should be removed from the action. Defendants also argued that under Younger (a case which expanded the Middlesex factors to noncriminal proceedings involving important state interests), abstention was appropriate. The plaintiffs, in response, argued that their claims fell into the exception of mootness for a controversy that is capable of repetition yet evading review, arguing that the challenged action was too short in duration to be fully litigated before cessation but there was a reasonable likelihood that the same party would be subjected to the same action again.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On July 28, 2021, the court removed six of the named plaintiffs from the action and granted the motion to dismiss. 2021 WL 3195020. Regarding mootness, Chief Judge Johnston held that the claims of six of the named plaintiffs were moot, as each plaintiff was no longer in Defendants' legal or physical custody, and therefore they had no legally cognizable interest in the outcome of the litigation. Further, there was no evidence to meet the burden of establishing the mootness exception for claims evading review yet capable of repetition, and the nature of the case being a class action did not change the analysis as to the six named plaintiffs who were no longer in custody. Next, the court found that abstention under Younger applied, as the case involved \"state-initiated abuse and neglect proceedings,\" as well as a request for the court to issue an injunction aimed at preventing events that could take place in future abuse and neglect proceedings; thus an analysis of the Middlesex factors was necessary to determine if abstention was appropriate. Chief Judge Johnston found that under all three Middlesex factors were satisfied, finding that (1) the relief sought by plaintiffs would \"interfere extensively with ongoing state court proceedings for each of the named Plaintiffs\"; (2) \"the protection fo abused and neglected children is a vital and important state interest\"; and (3) the plaintiffs had not proved that the circuit courts lacked jurisdiction or ability to adjudicate the claims during periodic review proceedings as a part of the plaintiff's ongoing abuse and neglect proceedings. Finally, Chief Judge Johnston found that no exceptions toYounger applied, and thus review of the case was inappropriate and the court was barred from considering it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On August 4, 2021, plaintiffs appealed the motion to dismiss to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. A panel of the Fourth Circuit, including Circuit Judges Harris, Rushing, and Floyd heard argument on March 9, 2022 and issued its opinion affirming in part and denying in part on July 20, 2022. The Fourth Circuit held that named plaintiffs' claims were rendered moot; exception to mootness that allowed certification of class to relate back to filing of complaint if named plaintiffs' claims were rendered moot applied; Younger abstention did not apply; and Rooker-Feldman abstention did not apply. Beginning with mootness, the Fourth Circuit agreed with plaintiffs' argument that where a named plaintiff's individual claim becomes moot before the district court has an opportunity to certify the class, the certification may \"relate back\" to the filing of the complaint if other class members will continue to be subject to the challenged conduct and claims raised were inherently transitory (relying on Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103 (1975)). In particular, the Fourth Circuit focused on the unpredictability of foster-care placements and the danger of devastating entire childhoods. 41 F.4th 316.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On the application of Younger abstention, the Fourth Circuit disagreed with the district court's holding that this case fell within federal abstention because state circuit courts have exclusive jurisdiction over the setting in which children are placed. The Fourth Circuit held that quarterly state court hearings were not entitled to Younger treatment (they aren't criminal trials, nor do they fit within the type of civil enforcement or judicial process proceedings to which Younger would apply) and would not further any federalism interests in comity. In addition, the Fourth Circuit thought it was premature to dismiss the case before the court has an opportunity to consider what relief could properly constitute. The Fourth Circuit rejected defendants' arguments for applying Rooker-Feldman abstention for similar reasons and because plaintiffs did not object to a state court decision but to a state Department, which does not fall within the doctrine. 41 F.4th 316.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Defendants filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking review of the Fourth Circuit opinion. The Supreme Court denied cert on October 11, 2022, notifying the Fourth Circuit in a letter.</p>\r\n<p>The parties proceeded with discovery and defendants submitted status reports. On September 20, 2022, defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and stay discovering pending the motion to dismiss. The court granted a two week stay on September 28, 2022, to allow parties to engage in discussions. On December 19, 2022, defendants filed a motion for a protective order, which the court granted on January 10, 2023. The court granted and denied in part defendants' motion to dismiss on January 13, 2023. The court analyzed each of plaintiffs' five claims under their proposed classes: the general class (all children who are or will be in West Virginia foster care); kinship subclass (children who are, will be, or have been placed in kinship placements); the ADA subclass (children who have or will have physical, intellectual, cognitive, or mental health disabilities) and the Aging Out subclass. Plaintiffs' substantive due process claims were dismissed as to all proposed classes, with the court emphasizing the difference between what West Virginia should do versus what is legally required. Plaintiffs' second claim, the right to familial association, also did not pass the court's muster. The court noted that plaintiffs failed to allege a violation of their right to familial association with their parents, that the Constitution's protection of sibling relationships does not apply in the foster care context, and that the grandparent-grandchild relationship claim was foreclosed by Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000). Plaintiffs' &sect; 1983 claim under the Adoption Assistance and child Welfare Act was similarly denied. The court denied the motion to dismiss plaintiffs' claims under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act relying on Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581 (1999).</p>\r\n<p>The parties entered into settlement negotiations and the court consequently stayed discovery on February 16, 2023.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Johnston recused himself from the case on April 3, 2023. Judge Johnston's recusal came after emails and documents obtained through a public records request showed regular communication between Johnston, state lawmakers, and government staffers. More information on Judge Johnston's recusal may be found here.</p>\r\n<p>The case was reassigned to District Judge Joseph R. Goodwin, with discovery matters referred to Magistrate Judge Cheryl A. Eifert. Judge Eifert later retired, and on September 3, 2024, discovery supervision transferred to Magistrate Judge Joseph K. Reeder.</p>\r\n<p>On August 17, 2023, Judge Goodwin granted in part plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for class certification, allowing the case to proceed on behalf of a General Class of all children in West Virginia foster care and an ADA Subclass of foster children with disabilities. Other requested subclasses, including the kinship and aging-out groups, were not certified. The court appointed class counsel and set deadlines for discovery and expert disclosures.</p>\r\n<p>During late 2023 and early 2024, the parties engaged in extensive discovery and motion practice. On March 28, 2024, the court granted in part plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for sanctions under Federal Rule 37(e) for the state&rsquo;s failure to preserve electronically stored information. Judge Goodwin barred defendants from arguing that the missing data would have disproved deliberate indifference and ordered them to reimburse plaintiffs&rsquo; reasonable fees and costs for litigating the issue.</p>\r\n<p>The next day, the court authorized additional Rule 30(b)(6) depositions and extended deposition hours, and on April 1, 2024, issued an amended scheduling order setting expert-disclosure and dispositive-motion deadlines and scheduling a bench trial for November 5, 2024. In the months that followed, the parties conducted numerous depositions of Department of Health and Human Resources staff and third-party witnesses.</p>\r\n<p>In April and May 2024, the court resolved a separate sanctions dispute and approved the parties&rsquo; stipulated withdrawal of plaintiffs&rsquo; application for attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses, which had been filed under the March 28 sanctions order.</p>\r\n<p>On July 8, 2024, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. The parties submitted extensive briefing and exhibits through September, during which the court entered several orders on sealing and redaction to protect identifying information.</p>\r\n<p>In early September 2024, both sides filed motions to exclude or limit expert testimony under Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, addressing multiple expert witnesses on class-wide foster-care practices and disability services. Oppositions were filed by late September 2024.</p>\r\n<p>Starting in fall 2024, the parties continued pretrial filings (including sealing/redactions, Rule 26 disclosures, objections, and multiple motions in limine). On October 15, 2024, the court reset the schedule, ultimately moving the pretrial conference to April 10, 2025, and a bench trial to May 6, 2025. In early 2025 the parties exchanged additional witness/exhibit disclosures and litigated calendar issues.</p>\r\n<p>On February 28, 2025, the district court sua sponte dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction and entered judgment with prejudice, directing that the published opinion be posted on the court&rsquo;s website. Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on March 10, 2025 (4th Cir. No. 25-1232). Defendants filed a conditional cross-appeal on March 12, 2025 (No. 25-1239), and on March 13, 2025 the Fourth Circuit consolidated the matters, designating No. 25-1232 as the lead appeal. The case is now pending before the Fourth Circuit.&nbsp;</p>",

Plaintiffs sought a class certification of foster children in West Virginia and certification of three subclasses. Defendants moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted. The court granted this motion and plaintiffs appealed to the Fourth Circuit court. After the district judge recused himself in April 2023, the case was reassigned to Judge Joseph R. Goodwin. In August 2023, the court certified a general class and an ADA subclass. The parties engaged in extensive discovery through 2024, with the court issuing a partial sanctions order against defendants for failing to preserve electronically stored information and setting a November 2024 trial date. The defendants moved for summary judgment.  On February 28, 2025, the district court sua sponte dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction and entered judgment with prejudice.

So when suit was brought \nagainst West Virginia state officials and a state agency for \npurportedly mishandling that treatment and care, the suit \nnecessarily  implicated  related  state-court  proceedings.  \nThe district court recognized as much and thus abstained.  \nIn contrast, the Fourth Circuit concluded that the suit \nmust remain in federal court.  It believed that a state \nfoster-care proceeding is not the sort of case that can ever \ntrigger abstention and that the plaintiffs might struggle to \nobtain class-wide relief in state court.  Now, the plaintiffs \ncan pursue systemic relief in federal court that could both \nfundamentally  upset  the  ways  West  Virginia  courts \nadminister the State’s child welfare laws and indefinitely \nrequire the federal court to superintend the State’s entire \nchild welfare system. \nThe questions presented are: \n1. Must  federal  courts  abstain  from  interfering  with \nstate-court child welfare proceedings under Younger\nv. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971)? \n2. May federal courts refuse to abstain because plaintiffs \nseek class-wide relief? \n\nII \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioners who were defendants in the district court \nand defendants-appellees in the court of appeals are Jim \nJustice, in his official capacity as the Governor of West \nVirginia; Bill Crouch, in his official capacity as the Cabinet \nSecretary of the West Virginia Department of Health and \nHuman  Resources;  Jeremiah  Samples,  in  his  official \ncapacity as the Deputy Secretary of the Department of \nHealth and Human Resources; Linda Watts, in her official \ncapacity as the Commissioner of the Bureau for Children \nand  Families;  and  the  West  Virginia  Department  of \nHealth and Human Resources. \nRespondents who were plaintiffs in the district court \nand  plaintiffs-appellants  in  the  court  of  appeals  are \nJonathan  R.,  minor,  by  Next  Friend,  Sarah  Dixon; \nAnastasia M., minor, by Next Friend, Cheryl Ord; Serena \nS., minor, by Next Friend, Sarah Dixon; Theo S., minor, \nby Next Friend, L.

See Younger\nv.  Harris,  401  U.S.  37  (1971).    And  though  Younger \ninvolved a pending state criminal prosecution, the Court \nhas  never  limited  Younger  abstention to  that  narrow \ncontext.    The  doctrine  now  extends  to  state  civil \nenforcement  proceedings  and  other  civil  matters  that \nadvance state courts’ abilities to perform their judicial \nfunctions.  See Sprint Commc’ns, Inc. v. Jacobs, 571 U.S. \n69, 73 (2013).   \nNot long after deciding Younger, the Court brought \nstate child welfare litigation within its scope in Moore v. \nSims, 442 U.S. 415 (1979).  And three decades later the \nCourt confirmed that Moore is as correct as ever.  See \nSprint, 571 U.S. at 79 (citing Moore with approval).  Most \nof the courts of appeals have thus held that federal courts \nmust abstain when federal plaintiffs’ claims interfere with \nongoing child welfare proceedings.  Not may or might or \nshould—must.   \nNot all courts, though, have applied Moore’s message \nthis way.  When this suit was brought on behalf of a group \nof West Virginia foster children challenging the State’s \nchild welfare system, the federal district court did what it \nshould have:  It abstained under Younger and dismissed \nthe case.  See App.48a-81a.  But when the Fourth Circuit \nlooked at West Virginia’s comprehensive child welfare \nregime, it reversed and held that federal courts—not the \nState’s courts—should decide whether relief is warranted \nfor  the  deficiencies  Respondents  allege.    The  Fourth \nCircuit  believed  that  West  Virginia’s  child  welfare \nproceedings  are  not  the  sort  of  actions  Younger \naddressed; it also thought that Respondents’ request for \nclass-wide relief created a special need for a federal forum.   \n\n2 \nThe decision below drips with antipathy towards state \ncourts and the State of West Virginia generally.  See, e.g., \nApp.7a (“[W]hen all else fails—which it often does in West \nVirginia ….”).  Starting from that vantage point, there is \nlittle surprise that it got Younger abstention so wrong.  It \nalso exacerbated circuit splits on two important issues.  In \nboth, the Fourth Circuit now sits in the minority.   \nFirst,most circuits abstain in cases that implicate state \nchild welfare proceedings.  But even in the face of Moore \n(and  the  strong  circuit  consensus  that  tracks  it),  the \nFourth Circuit joined two other circuits in refusing to do \nso.    Along  the  way,  it  infringed  the  dual  sovereignty \ncentral to our constitutional system.  It ignored West \nVirginia’s deep interest in the welfare of its children—an \ninterest  that  the  continuous  judicial  proceedings \nconcerning every foster child in the State reflects.  And it \nescalated confusion around Moore’s continued vitality.       \nSecond, courts are split on how to apply Younger to \nclass  complaints.    Some  circuits—the  Fourth  now \nincluded—find  a  state  forum  inadequate  for  Younger \npurposes  if  the  plaintiff  seeks  class-wide  relief  in  the \nfederal suit and it is not obvious that the plaintiff could \nseek that relief in the state forum.  But other circuits are \nsatisfied so long as the plaintiff could seek individual relief \nin  state  court.    This  difference  matters,  as  the  first \napproach may allow procedural class-certification rules to \ndetermine a party’s substantive rights to relief in federal \ncourt.  Congress never meant for the rules to do that.  \nMore concerning, refusing to abstain because the plaintiff \nwants  class-wide  relief  invites  a  degree  of  federal \noversight over state courts that this Court has rejected \nbefore—and should again here. \nSplits  aside,  this  case  involves  one  of  the  most \nimportant  and  urgent  duties  the  States  shoulder: \n\n3 \nguaranteeing the welfare of our children.  West Virginia \npursued its role as “ultimate protector of the rights of [its] \nminors,” In re B.C., 755 S.E.2d 664, 671 (W. Va. 2014), by \nbuilding a state-court-directed process to ensure children \nreceive the care and attention they deserve.  The decision \nbelow takes that system, at least in part, out of the state \ncourts’ hands.  The Court should grant review to return \nWest Virginia’s children and families to firmer ground, \nknowing  that  their  state  officials  and  courts  are \nresponsible for disputes over how this process succeeds. \nThis case is also the right vehicle to tackle these issues.  \nIt  turns  on  clean  questions  of  law,  not  case-specific \ndiscretionary  factors.    Its  issues  need  no  further \npercolation; all the relevant circuits have weighed in on \nthe  first  question,  and  the  split  on  the  second  is  well \ndefined.  And the decision below exemplifies the worst \nproblems in the minority sides of both splits.  The Fourth \nCircuit ignored the complexities of West Virginia’s child \nwelfare  system.    It  disregarded  state  procedural \nprotections for parents and children alike.  It minimized \nthe State’s interest in the subject matter.  It brushed aside \ninterference  with  the  same  ongoing  state-court \nproceedings it considered incapable of delivering relief.  In \nshort, it made no bones about its disdain for state-led \nsystems  and  courts.    The  Court  should  take  this \nopportunity to insist that federal courts give their state \ncounterparts the equal respect that federalism demands. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe Fourth Circuit’s opinion (App.1a-47a) is reported \nat 41 F.4th 316.  The district court’s opinion (App.48a-81a) \nis unreported but available at 2021 WL 3195020. \n\n4 \nJURISDICTION \nThe Fourth Circuit entered judgment on July 20, 2022.  \nPetitioners  timely  filed  this  petition  for  certiorari  on \nSeptember 12, 2022.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 \nU.S.C. § 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant  West  Virginia  Code  provisions  appear  at \nApp.82a-131a. \nSTATEMENT \n1.  When  the  Court in  Younger  reversed  the \ninjunction of a California criminal prosecution in 1971, it \nseemed likely that this brand of abstention would reach \nother contexts, too.  The wait was not long.  The Court \nstarted by expanding the protection to three kinds of civil \nproceedings  that  directly  involve  the  State—public \nnuisance judgments, Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U.S. \n592 (1975); judicial contempt proceedings, Juidice v. Vail, \n430 U.S. 327 (1977); and state welfare payment recovery \nactions, Trainor v. Hernandez, 431 U.S. 434 (1977).  Child \nabuse  and  neglect  proceedings  were  not  far  behind.  \nMoore v. Sims, 442 U.S. 415 (1979).  Then the Court \ncovered  state  bar  disciplinary  proceedings,  Middlesex \nCnty. Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar Ass’n, 457 U.S. \n423  (1982),  and  sex  discrimination  actions,  Ohio  C.R. \nComm’n  v.  Dayton  Christian  Sch.,  Inc.,  477  U.S.  619 \n(1986).  And after that, the Court reached a civil action \nbetween two private parties.  See Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco \nInc., 481 U.S. 1 (1987) (judgments pending appeal).  Only \nwhen faced with an “essentially legislative act”—a city \ncouncil’s decision to issue a rate order—did the Court \ndecline  to  expand  Younger  abstention  further.    New \n\n5 \nOrleans  Pub.  Serv.,  Inc.  v.  Council  of  City  of  New \nOrleans, 491 U.S. 350 (1989) (NOPSI). \nEvery time the Court applied Younger to a new type of \nstate  proceeding,  the  doctrine’s  scope  became  a  little \nclearer.  Most relevant here, for example, Moore stressed \nthat  “important  state  interests”  like  “the  informed \nevolution of state policy by state tribunals” are often found \nin certain key civil proceedings—including child welfare \nactions.  442 U.S. at 423 (citing Trainor, 431 U.S. at 445).  \nSo  “unless  state  law  clearly  bars”  presentation  of \nconstitutional claims in the forum, federal courts must \nabstain.  Id. at 425-26, 432.  The Court strengthened this \nprinciple in Middlesex, confirming that state proceedings \nmust be ongoing to trigger abstention.  457 U.S. at 432.  \nAnd  NOPSI  clarified  that  Younger  extends  to  state \nproceedings that are “judicial in nature.”  491 U.S. at 369-\n70. \nThe Court’s 2013 decision in Sprint Communications, \nInc. v. Jacobs synthesized this string of rulings into a rule:  \nAlthough  “federal  courts  are  obliged  to  decide  cases \nwithin  the  scope  of  federal  jurisdiction,”  “exceptional \ncircumstances” require abstaining from three categories \nof proceedings, so long as they satisfy Middlesex’s three \n“additional factors.”  571 U.S. at 72, 78, 81-82 (emphasis \nin original).  Those categories are “ongoing state criminal \nprosecutions,” “civil enforcement proceedings” that are \n“akin  to  criminal  prosecutions,”  and  civil  proceedings \n“that implicate a State’s interest in enforcing the orders \nand judgments of its courts.”  Id. at 72-73, 78 (cleaned up).  \nAs for the additional factors, the state proceedings must \nbe  ongoing,  “implicate  important  state  interests,”  and \n“afford an adequate opportunity … to raise constitutional \nchallenges.”  Middlesex, 457 U.S. at 432; accord Sprint, \n571 U.S. at 81.\n\n6 \n2.  West Virginia’s child welfare system addresses the \nkind of critical state interests that Younger and Sprint \nsaid—and Moore confirmed—belong to state courts.  And \nindeed,  West  Virginia  law  gives  its  courts  significant \nauthority over that system.  Circuit court judges across \nWest Virginia’s 55 counties decide whether a child will \nenter state custody and then make the key decisions as \nlong as he or she remains there.  App.72a-75a.  West \nVirginia’s Department of Health and Human Resources \n(DHHR) provides for these children, but they are ordered \ninto DHHR’s care “by courts” and courts alone.  W. VA.\nCODE § 49-2-101(a).   \nCourts typically order children into DHHR custody \nthrough one of two proceedings.   \nOne is an abuse-and-neglect hearing.  W. VA. CODE \n§ 49-4-601.    The  children  involved  in  these  hearings \ncomprise the customary foster care population and include \n90 percent of the children in DHHR’s care.  App.5a.  West \nVirginia treats these “abuse and neglect cases” as “among \nthe  highest  priority  for  the  courts’  attention.”    In  re \nCarlita B., 408 S.E.2d 365, 375-76 (W. Va. 1991). \nThe other is a juvenile-justice hearing.  Circuit courts \nconduct a juvenile-delinquency or juvenile-status-offense \nproceeding either while a charge is pending against a \nminor or after an adjudication.  W.VA.CODE § 49-4-701, et \nseq.  These proceedings turn on factors like the child’s best \ninterest and the public safety.  See id. § 49-4-714.  They \ngive the State a middle ground between returning child \noffenders to their parents and placing them in a state \ndetention facility. \n3.  Whichever  process  is  involved  (and  sometimes, \nboth are), West Virginia courts comprehensively oversee \nfoster care.  State courts direct a child’s placement and \n\n7 \nthen monitor the child’s safety and well-being, W. VA.\nCODE  §  49-4-110(a),  as  part  of  a  “systematic  review,” \nCarlita B., 408 S.E.2d at 376.  Foster children and juvenile \njustice children are served by DHHR’s Child Protective \nServices and Youth Services caseworkers, respectively.  \nBut once the State initiates a child welfare proceeding, the \nchild  remains  under  the  state  court’s  continuous \njurisdiction until he or she is no longer in state custody.  \nSee W.VA.CODE §§ 49-4-601, et seq., 49-4-701, et seq.; see \nalso, e.g., In re J.L., 763 S.E.2d 654, 660 (W. Va. 2014) \n(stressing  state  courts’  “continuing  jurisdiction”  over \nabuse-and-neglect matters). \nAbuse-and-neglect  proceedings  start,  continue,  and \nend with the state circuit court.  The circuit court first \ndecides whether to grant temporary custody of a child to \nDHHR,  then  conducts  preliminary  and  adjudicatory \nhearings to develop the record and decide whether the \nchild  is,  in  fact,  being  abused  or  neglected.    W. VA.\nCODE §§ 49-4-105, 49-4-601.  To be sure, the court works \nwith others, including DHHR, court-appointed counsel, \nand the parties themselves.  Id. §§ 49-4-405, 49-4-601(c), \n(f).  But every central decision belongs to the circuit court.  \nThe  court  determines  whether  the  child  is  abused  or \nneglected, whether removal from the home is in the child’s \nbest  interests,  where  the  child  should  be  placed  if \nnecessary, whether family visitation should be allowed, \nwhat services the child and family will receive, and what \npermanency plan to pursue.  Id. §§ 49-4-108, 49-4-110, 49-\n4-404,  49-4-601(i),  49-4-602(b),  49-4-604(c), 49-4-608(e).  \nUltimately, the circuit court keeps “exclusive jurisdiction \nto determine the permanent placement of a [foster] child.”  \nW. Va. R. P. Child Abuse and Neglect Proceedings 36(e); \nsee also id. at R. 6; W.VA.CODE § 49-4-606. \n\n8 \nThe framework is generally the same for children who \nenter  the  system  through  juvenile-justice  proceedings, \nexcept that the hearings are adversarial against the child \ninstead of the parents.  See generally W.VA.CODE § 49-4-\n701, et seq.  \nIn short, while “both” DHHR and the circuit court \nwork to ensure a foster child’s care, the court decides \nwhere children will be placed and what services they will \nreceive while in state custody.  State v. Chafin, 444 S.E.2d \n62, 70 (W. Va. 1994); W. VA. CODE §§ 49-4-604, 49-4-714.  \nAnd  ongoing  state-court  jurisdiction  is  not  an  empty \npromise.  So long as a child is in state custody, the circuit \ncourt holds quarterly post-adjudication hearings—every \n90 days—and issues new orders concerning the child’s \ncare.  Id. §§ 49-4-110, 49-4-405, 49-4-406.  Here again, \nthese  orders  reach  all  manner  of  questions,  including \nplacement, State v. Michael M., 504 S.E.2d 177, 184-86 (W. \nVa. 1998); visitation, id. at 186-87; placement in an out-of-\nstate facility, W. VA. CODE § 49-4-608(d); modification of \nthe child’s case plan, see, e.g., State v. Dyer, 836 S.E.2d \n472, 522 n.29 (W. Va. 2019); compliance with the case plan, \nW. VA. CODE § 49-4-404; and transition to independent \nliving,  id. § 49-4–608(c). \nFurther, the child’s representative can raise federal \nclaims, constitutional or otherwise.  The circuit courts that \nhear child welfare cases in West Virginia are courts of \n“general jurisdiction.”  W. Va. Const. art. 8, § 6; State v.\nPancake, 544 S.E.2d 403, 404 (W. Va. 2001) (citing W.VA.\nCODE  §  49-6-1,  et  seq.).    They  thus  have  “power  to \ndetermine all controversies that can possibly be made the \nsubject of civil actions,” including federal constitutional \nclaims  like  Respondents’  here.    State  ex  rel.  Silver  v.\nWilkes, 584 S.E.2d 548, 552 (W. Va. 2003); compare with\nMoore, 442 U.S. at 425 & n.9 (emphasizing that the state \n\n9 \nforum  could  hear  federal  claims  as  part  of  abstention \nrationale).    And  should  parties  to  a  child  welfare \nproceeding be unhappy with the circuit court’s resolution, \nthey can appeal any final ruling to the Supreme Court of \nAppeals  of  West  Virginia.    W. VA. CODE  §  49-4-102.  \nDHHR too—if it disagrees with a circuit court’s child \nwelfare order, it “cannot ignore or refuse to comply” with \nit.  State ex rel. Daniel M. v. DHHR, 516 S.E.2d 30, 34 (W. \nVa. 1999).  It must appeal.  Id.\nFinally,  these  child  welfare  proceedings—including \nthe  ongoing  post-adjudication  hearings—mirror  many \nelements of a criminal trial.  See W.VA.CODE §§ 49-4-110, \n49-4-601 (applying procedural rights to “any proceeding \nunder this article”).  With the State serving as the moving \nparty,  each  county’s  prosecuting  attorney  represents \nDHHR  and  participates  with  any  multidisciplinary \ntreatment team advising the court.  Id. §§ 49-4-402, 49-4-\n501; compare with Moore, 442 U.S. at 419 (noting that \nstate proceeding was “precipitated” by local authorities \nsupervised by relevant state agency).  The court takes \nevidence and finds facts using formal rules of evidence.  Id.\n§§ 49-4-601(k), 49-4-701(k).  Defendants have the right to \ncross-examine witnesses, and both parents and children \nhave the right to be heard.  Id. §§ 49-4-405, 49-4-601, 49-4-\n701.  The circuit court appoints counsel for the child and \nany parent or custodian involved.  Id. §§ 49-4-601, 49-4-\n701.  Finally, adjudicatory proceedings have evidentiary \nburdens elevated beyond the ordinary civil standard, with \nabuse-and-neglect  hearings  requiring  “clear  and \nconvincing  evidence,”  id.  § 49-4-601,  and  delinquency \nhearings using the “constitutionally imposed burden to \nprove the juvenile’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,” \nState v. Peterman, 260 S.E.2d 728, 728 (W. Va. 1979).  \nBeyond  that,  juvenile-delinquency  proceedings  are \n\n10 \ncriminal proceedings.  See, e.g., State v. Allah Jamaal W., \n543 S.E.2d 282, 284 (W. Va. 2000). \n4.  Respondents, next friends of 12 children who were \nin West Virginia’s foster care system at the time, filed a \nclass  action  suit  in  federal  court  seeking  broad \ninstitutional and system-wide changes to West Virginia’s \nchild welfare system.  App.4a.  They named as defendants \nDHHR and various executive state officers.  And they \ndefined the putative class to include all children who had \nentered or would enter the State’s custody through either \nentry point, currently or in the future.  App.49a-50a.  \nThe complaint alleged many problems with the State’s \nchild welfare system and argued that DHHR failed to \nadequately  prevent  or  address  them.    The  allegations \nincluded  lack  of  staffing,  poorly  trained  foster-care \nfamilies  leading  to  a  lack  of  stability,  and  reliance  on \ninstitutionalized  facilities  (including  out-of-state \nplacements).  App.9a.  Respondents invoked substantive \ndue process, “the right to familial association,” the Social \nSecurity Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the \nRehabilitation Act.  App.9a-10a.   \nMuch of Respondents’ requested relief would dictate \nhow  West  Virginia’s  circuit  courts  administer  child \nwelfare proceedings.  Among other things, the plaintiffs \nask for specific directives on where children can be placed, \nincluding in residential care or with “kin” who have not \nbeen certified as foster families; they also seek specific \nstaffing ratios, new requirements for services for disabled \nchildren, new standards for handling children over the age \nof 14, and a federally appointed monitor to oversee the \nwhole enterprise.  App.53a-54a.   \n\n11 \nGiven the relief sought, Petitioners moved to dismiss \nbased on Younger and other abstention and jurisdictional \ngrounds.   \n5.  The district court granted Petitioners’ motion in \nJuly 2021, holding that Younger required it to abstain.   \nIn  the  district  court’s  view,  the  State’s  foster  care \nproceedings “easily” fell into a “hybrid” of two categories \nof  proceedings  that  the  Court  has  confirmed  warrant \nYounger abstention: “state civil proceedings that are akin \nto criminal prosecutions” and “civil proceedings involving \ncertain  orders  ...  uniquely  in  furtherance  of  the  state \ncourts’  ability  to  perform  their  judicial  function.”  \nApp.67a-68a  (quoting  Sprint,  571  U.S.  at  78).    West \nVirginia’s  child  welfare  proceedings  resemble  state-\ninitiated civil enforcement actions, as in Moore, 442 U.S. \nat  415,  and  are  core  judicial  proceedings  that  make \ninterference inappropriate, as in O’Shea v. Littleton, 414 \nU.S. 488 (1974).  App.68a.    \nThe district court also held that West Virginia’s child \nwelfare proceedings satisfy the three Middlesex factors \nthat further counsel for abstention.  App.70a-80a.  First, \nRespondents’ required relief would interfere with West \nVirginia’s ongoing child welfare proceedings.  App.70a-\n78a.  The district court detailed how “heavily involved” \nWest  Virginia’s  state  courts  are  at  all  stages  of  the \nprocess.  App.72a-76a.  State courts (not DHHR officials) \nare responsible for the key decisions relating to every \nindividual foster child’s placement and services.  Granting \nRespondents’  requested  relief  would  thus  “[r]emov[e]” \nthe state courts’ “discretion” and replace it with “federal \ncourt review over [their] decisions.”  App.77a.  Second, the \ncourt held that West Virginia’s child welfare proceedings \nimplicate  important  state  interests—a  point  no  party \ndisputed.  App.78a.  Third, it held that Respondents had \n\n12 \nadequate opportunity to raise their claims in the state-\ncourt  proceedings  themselves.    App.78a-80a.    West \nVirginia’s courts are “capable of hearing” Respondents’ \nfederal claims.  App.79a.  Respondents had just never \ngiven them “an opportunity to consider” them.  App.79a. \nHolding  that  the  State’s  child  welfare  proceedings \nsatisfied every requirement for Younger abstention and \ntriggered  none  of  its  exceptions,  the  district  court \ndismissed the case.  App.81a. \n6.  In July 2022, the Fourth Circuit issued a decision \naffirming in part and reversing in part the district court’s \norder, and remanding the case.  Judge Rushing wrote \nseparately to dissent in part from the opinion and concur \nin the judgment. \nAfter dispensing with a concern over mootness, the \nFourth Circuit moved to Younger.  It started by treating \nthe quarterly post-adjudication state-court hearings as \nthe only relevant ongoing proceedings, even though they \nare part of a unified case beginning with the petition to \nremove a child from the home.  App.17a, 21a.  The court \nthen held that these quarterly hearings did not fall within \nany of the three Younger categories laid out in Sprint.  \nThe proceedings were not criminal because West Virginia \nconceded  as  much.    App.21a.    They  were  not  akin  to \ncriminal  prosecutions  because  they  “proceed  in  a \n‘conciliatory’ manner.”  App.21a-22a. And they were not \nthe  right  kind  of  civil  proceedings  because  “[n]othing \nabout  [them]  implicates  ‘the  administration’  of  West \nVirginia’s judiciary.”  App.24a.  In the Fourth Circuit’s \nview,  the  possibility  that  the  federal  action  would \nundermine state courts’ ability to issue contempt orders \ndid not trigger the next phase of the abstention analysis, \neither.  App.24a-25a.   \n\n13 \nAlthough it recognized that other circuits had decided \ndifferently, App.25a-26a & n.7, the Fourth Circuit found \nthat no “historical precedent” supported West Virginia’s \nargument,  App.18a.    It  thought  Moore,  for  example,\naddressed only the parental-rights side of the process.  \nApp.21a.    The  Fourth  Circuit  deemed  hearings  on \nparental rights distinct from any continuing hearings on \nthe  status  of  the  child—so  even  though  these  latter \nhearings are part of the same case, they could not trigger \nabstention.  App.21a-22a.  In sum, the court believed that \nthe  suit  did  “not  challenge”  West  Virginia  courts’ \n“authority” over foster proceedings.  App.24a. \nTwo judges on the panel opined further that the other \nfactors justifying abstention would be missing even if the \nproceedings  had  fit  into  a  Younger  category.    They \nbelieved that “halting the litigation on th[e] record would \nbe premature” because it was not yet clear what relief the \nplaintiffs would obtain.  App.31a.  They also thought the \nplaintiffs were complaining about DHHR’s conduct, not \nthe courts’—even though they recognized that the “buck” \nstops with the courts.  App.6a, 28a-29a.  And the panel \nmajority felt that the suit did not ask the district court to \nunduly  involve  itself  in  state  judicial  administration \nbecause, unlike in O’Shea, the federal court’s final order in \nthe case would not issue against judges directly.  App.30a.   \nThese issues aside, the two-judge majority also fretted \nthat—even if the plaintiffs could obtain all requested relief \nin their individual cases—the state proceedings would not \ngive them the tools to effect “systemic” change (read: \nclass-wide  relief)  across  the  entire  foster-care  system.  \nApp.31a-36a; contrast Moore, 442 U.S. at 426 (reversing a \nrefusal to abstain premised on the idea that a challenge to \nthe  “entire  statutory  scheme”  for  protecting  children \nshould be heard in federal court).  These judges concluded \n\n14 \nthat it would be unfair to ask Respondents to “litigate \ntheir  claims  piecemeal.”    App.5a.    They  thought \nRespondents’  “only  real  choice”  for  relief  was  a  class \naction.  App.36a. \nThe majority then catalogued prior cases in which it \nthought that West Virginia’s courts should have ordered \nmore relief to children; it supposed that those cases reflect \n“state courts’ reluctance to order deep structural changes \nwithin [DHHR].”  App.38a.  So with this precedent in \nhand, any court in the Fourth Circuit may now declare a \nstate  forum  inadequate  for  Younger  purposes  if  it \ndisagrees  with  the  results  of  prior  cases  addressing \nsimilar issues.  But see, e.g., Baffert v. Cal. Horse Racing \nBd., 332 F.3d 613, 621 (9th Cir. 2003) (explaining that a \nparty’s lack of prior success in state court “does not render \nthe forum inadequate”). \nFollowing  the  opinion,  Petitioners  moved  for  the \nFourth Circuit to stay the mandate.  The court denied the \nmotion on August 15, 2022.  This Petition followed. \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nI. The Court Should Resolve Whether Younger \nAbstention Applies To State Child Welfare \nProceedings. \nThe  decision  below  deepens  a  circuit  split  over \nabstention from state child welfare proceedings—one side \nholds that federal courts must abstain and the other holds \nthat they cannot.  This issue should have been settled \nyears ago when the Court decided Moore.  But instead the \nconfusion has grown broad and deep in the ensuing 43 \nyears. \nOne  thing  has  not  changed  since  Moore:  the \nimportance of the issue.  Child welfare proceedings matter \n\n15 \nto us all.  So does the degree to which federal courts can \ndictate how States and their courts address the critical \nquestions that arise throughout the hundreds of those \nproceedings that take place every day nationwide.  These \nare matters of federalism, comity, and primacy at the \nheart of our constitutional order. \nThe decision below intensifies an open and \nacknowledged circuit split. \n1.   Every circuit except the Federal Circuit has now \nconsidered  whether  Younger  applies  to  child  welfare \nproceedings—and they are firmly split over the answer.  \nOn one side are decisions like the one here:  Three circuits \nhave held that abstaining from state-court child welfare \nproceedings  is  not  an  option.    On  the  other  side,  ten \ncircuits have said that federal courts must abstain.  Those \ncourts are on the same page on the issues that count—\nrespect for state courts, noninterference with legitimate \nstate functions, protection of strong state interests, and all \nthe rest.  They also sit above district courts that have \ndeclined to abstain despite contrary precedent from their \nown circuit courts.  See App.40a; see also David Marcus, \nGroups and Rights in Institutional Reform Litigation, 97 \nNOTRE DAME L.REV. 619, 672 (2022) (“Younger motions \nhave left a mess of contradictory decisions for foster care \nreform litigation.”).  So the confusion runs even deeper \nthan the lopsided circuit count shows.  This is both the \ntime and the case for the Court to intervene.   \n2.   Take  first  the  ten  circuits  that  have  held  that \nYounger  requires  federal  courts  to  abstain  from \ninterfering with state-court child welfare proceedings.\nThe Seventh Circuit is the most emphatic.  In a string \nof three recent decisions, it discussed several reasons why \nfederal courts must yield to state courts.  Those reasons \n\n16 \nrange from the State’s strong interest in their children’s \nwelfare, to principles of federalism and comity, to the \nopportunity to raise a particular challenge in the state-\ncourt proceedings, to the adequacy of the state system \nitself  to  address  claims  like  these.    See  Ashley  W.  v. \nHolcomb, 34 F.4th 588, 593-94 (7th Cir. 2022); Nicole K. v. \nStigdon, 990 F.3d 534, 538 (7th Cir. 2021); Milchtein v.\nChisholm,  880  F.3d  895,  899  (7th  Cir.  2018);  accord \nBrunken v. Lance, 807 F.2d 1325, 1330-31 (7th Cir. 1986) \n(requiring abstention from child custody proceedings).   \nAlso  in  the  last  five years,  the  Second  and  Eighth \nCircuits issued similar rulings.  The Second Circuit’s case \naddressed  state  abuse-and-neglect  investigations  and \nproceedings.  Lowell v. Vermont Dep’t of Child. & Fams., \n835 F. App’x 637 (2d Cir. 2020).  The Eighth’s concerned \ntemporary custody proceedings.  Oglala Sioux Tribe v. \nFleming, 904 F.3d 603, 610 (8th Cir. 2018).  Because these \nproceedings fell within the Sprint categories and satisfied \nthe Middlesex factors, both circuits held that abstention \nwas required.  See Lowell, 835 F. App’x at 639-40; Oglala, \n904 F.3d at 607-13 (8th Cir. 2018). \nOver the course of the two prior decades—between this \nCourt’s NOPSI and Sprint decisions—four other circuits \nlooked at similar state proceedings and held the same.  \nThe Third and Ninth Circuits required abstaining from \npending state proceedings that involved areas of state \ninterest  and  concern  that  also  afforded  sufficient \nopportunity to adjudicate the claims plaintiffs would have \npreferred to litigate in federal court.  See Wattie-Bey v. \nAtt’y  Gen.’s  Off.,  424  F.  App’x  95,  97  (3d  Cir.  2011); \nLazaridis v. Wehmer, 591 F.3d 666, 670-71 (3d Cir. 2010); \nZimmermann v. Gregoire, 18 F. App’x 599, 601 (9th Cir. \n2001); H.C. ex rel. Gordon v. Koppel, 203 F.3d 610, 613 (9th \nCir. 2000); cf.E.T. v. Cantil-Sakauye, 682 F.3d 1121, 1124 \n\n17 \n(9th  Cir.  2012)  (relying  on  Younger  principles  to  find \nO’Shea  abstention  appropriate  in  challenge  to  size  of \nfoster-children’s attorneys’ caseloads).  \nIn the same period, the Tenth and Eleventh Circuits \nlikewise  mandated  abstention  for  state  child  welfare \nproceedings.  Their rulings upheld the States’ important \ninterests  in  these  areas.    They  also  worried  that  the \nrequested  relief  would  give  federal  courts  an \nimpermissible degree of control over state proceedings \ncontrary to Younger’s letter and purpose.  See J.B. ex rel. \nHart v. Valdez, 186 F.3d 1280, 1291, 1293 (10th Cir. 1999); \nJoseph A. ex rel. Corrine Wolfe v. Ingram, 275 F.3d 1253, \n1268, 1271-72 (10th Cir. 2002); 31 Foster Children v. Bush, \n329 F.3d 1255, 1274-82 (11th Cir. 2003). \nAnd decades before, the First, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits \nhad  planted  the  flag  that  abstention  from  state  child \nwelfare proceedings is required.  Their reasons should \nsound familiar by now: The States’ interests were strong, \nthe subject matter fell within the States’ wheelhouses, and \nstate courts were capable of addressing the claims.  See \nMalachowski v. City of Keene, 787 F.2d 704, 708-09 (1st \nCir. 1986); DeSpain v. Johnston, 731 F.2d 1171, 1179-81 \n(5th Cir. 1984); Parker v. Turner, 626 F.2d 1, 4, 6, 8-10 (6th \nCir. 1980); Huynh Thi Anh v. Levi, 586 F.2d 625, 633 (6th \nCir. 1978).\n3.   Three  circuits  looked  at  state  child  welfare \nproceedings and Younger and went a different way.  In \nLaShawn A. v. Kelly, the D.C. Circuit called the D.C. \nSuperior Court’s Family Division a “questionable vehicle \nfor adjudicating” claims from a class of foster children \nchallenging Family Division proceedings.  990 F.2d 1319, \n1323 (D.C. Cir. 1993).  Charging the Division with refusal \nand general inability to hear these claims, the D.C. Circuit \nreasoned that there was no “adequate forum” for claims \n\n18 \nseeking “broad-based injunctive relief based on federal \nlaw.”  Id. at 1323-24.  Thus, held the court, abstention was \nnot an option.\nThree  years  earlier  over in  the  Ninth  Circuit,  that \ncourt began what would become an intra-circuit split.  In \nL.H.  v.  Jamieson,  the  court  reversed  an  abstention \nfinding in a case involving juvenile plaintiffs who sought \nmore funding for the various state-care facilities where \nthey lived.  643 F.2d 1351 (9th Cir. 1981).  Their request \nfell outside the realm of what the plaintiffs could raise as \neither a claim or defense in an ongoing state proceeding, \nconvincing the court that Younger did not apply. Id. at \n1354.  And because the older case prevails when two cases \nfrom the Ninth Circuit conflict, United States v. Hardesty, \n958 F.2d 910, 914 (9th Cir. 1992), the circuit’s more recent \nattempts at course-direction only add to district courts’ \nconfusion.  See, e.g., Tinsley v. McKay, 156 F. Supp. 3d \n1024, 1036 (D. Ariz. 2015) (relying on L.H.’s rejection of an \nargument  based  on  “inherent  interference”  with  state \nchild welfare proceedings).   \nThen, of course, there is the Fourth Circuit’s decision \nhere forbidding Younger abstention.  Intent, it seems, on \namplifying the circuit split, the court tried to distinguish \nmany of the decisions above, including Moore and the \nrecent decisions from the Seventh, Eighth, Tenth, and \nEleventh Circuits.  See App.25a-26a.  It leaned instead on \na so-called “overwhelming majority” of largely district-\ncourt “cases [that] have rejected Younger abstention in \nsimilar  lawsuits  challenging  foster  care  systems”—\nshowing that even circuits on the other side of the divide \nhave  not  been  wholly  successful  putting  the  confusion \naround this issue to rest.  App.39a-40a (citing L.H., 643 \nF.2d at 1352 and quoting M.D. v. Perry, 799 F. Supp. 2d \n712, 723 (S.D. Tex. 2011)).   \n\n19 \n*  *  *  * \nWith  all  the  relevant  circuits  now  weighing  in,  the \ncircuit split is deep and fresh.  There is no way out of it \nwithout the Court’s intervention. \nThe split implicates profoundly important \nmatters of federalism. \nThe circuits in the majority did more than get Younger \nright.  They also advanced the currents of federalism and \ncomity that flow through it and the cases applying it.  \nAbstention respects the States by staying out of their \nlegitimate functions.  It recognizes that state courts are \njust as competent as federal ones to resolve claims of all \nkinds.  It honors the role state courts play in shaping state \nlaw, especially when it comes to the traditional state zone \nof domestic relations.  All these markers are missing from \nthe  decision  below  (and  its  Ninth  and  D.C.  Circuit \ncounterparts).  The Court should take up this case and \nreverse  to  solidify  the  principled  federalism  of  the \nmajority approach.   \n1.   Federalism and comity animate Younger.  For the \nStates,  parsing  responsibilities  among  sovereigns \nproperly is no small thing.  Our system of government \nrecognizes that States retain “residuary and inviolable \nsovereignty,” Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 715 (1999) \n(quoting THE FEDERALIST NO. 39, at 245), “subject only \nto limitations imposed by the Supremacy Clause,” Tafflin\nv. Levitt, 493 U.S. 455, 458 (1990).  Younger brings that \ndoctrine to life.  It emphasizes “sensitivity” to the States’ \ninterests  rather  than  “undu[e]  interfere[nce]”  in  their \n“legitimate activities.”  Younger, 401 U.S. at 44.   \nThe Court acted on the same consideration when it \nexpanded  Younger  abstention  to  the  civil  realm.  \n\n20 \n“[C]entral”  to  Younger—and  “even  more  vital”  than \nnoninterference  with  “state  criminal  proceedings”—is \nfederalism and its “notion of comity.”  Huffman, 420 U.S. \nat 600-01.  Younger allows a suite of abstention-related \nbenefits  to  run  their  natural  course.    It  lets  States \n“effectuat[e] [their] substantive policies” and “vindicate \nany constitutional objections interposed against” them.  \nId. at 604.  It avoids “duplicative legal proceedings” and \nthe waste, frustration, and confusion left in their wake.  Id.\nAnd it discredits the lie that state courts cannot “enforce \nconstitutional principles.”  Id.   \nThese concepts are important.  The result of abstention \nis  “proper  respect  for  state  functions”  by  leaving  the \n“States and their institutions … free to perform [them] in \ntheir separate ways.”  Juidice, 430 U.S. at 334 (quoting \nHuffman, 420 U.S. at 601).  Abstention cases’ “common \nthread,” then, is “that they all implicate … underlying \nprinciples of equity, comity, and federalism foundational \nto our federal constitutional structure.”  J.B. v. Woodard, \n997 F.3d 714, 722 (7th Cir. 2021).   \n2.   Clarifying Younger’s proper reach also respects \nthe importance of noninterference with “the operation of \nstate courts.”  Trainor, 431 U.S. at 441.  Federal courts \nmust  treat  state  courts  as  equals  with  their  federal \nsiblings.    Yet  despite  the  Court’s  “repeated[]  and \nemphatic[] reject[ion]” of the idea that “state courts [are] \nnot competent to adjudicate federal constitutional claims,”  \nMoore, 442 U.S. at 430, some lower federal courts believe \nit anyway.  In fact, it happened here—the Fourth Circuit \nspeculated that West Virginia’s courts are too “reluctan[t] \nto order deep structural changes.”  App.38a.  That belief \nis wrong.  Dual sovereignty means that “state courts have \ninherent  authority,  and  are  thus  presumptively \n\n21 \ncompetent, to adjudicate claims arising under the laws of \nthe United States.”  Tafflin, 493 U.S. at 458.   \n3.   Any  law  student  passingly  familiar  with  Erie \nknows  another  reason  to  insist  that  lower  courts  get \nabstention right: “State courts are the principal expositors \nof state law.”  Moore, 442 U.S. at 429-30; see Schlesinger, \n420 U.S. at 755-56.  When federal courts interfere with \nstate-court actions—particularly, as here, “far ranging” \n“constitutional challenge[s]”—that intervention halts “the \ninformed  evolution  of  state  policy  by  state \ntribunals.”  Moore, 442 U.S. at 429-30.  It is especially \ndangerous when federal courts draw conclusions about \nstate-law  systems  as  complex  as  those  here.    See \nRobinson v. Thomas, 855 F.3d 278, 285 (4th Cir. 2017) \n(reasoning, in applying Younger, that a State’s interest in \ninterpreting its own laws is “strengthened” when those \nlaws reflect “a complex web” of legal developments). \nWhat is more, it is hard to name an area of the law on \nwhich States have a tighter traditional grip than domestic \nrelations.  The Court has “consistently recognized” that \n“the whole subject … belongs to the laws of the States,” \nRose v. Rose, 481 U.S. 619, 625 (1987) (cleaned up), and to \n“state regulation,” United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. \n598, 615-16 (2000).  From the “century and a half” old \ndomestic-relations  exception  to  federal  jurisdiction, \nAnkenbrandt v. Richards, 504 U.S. 689, 694-95 (1992), to \nthe Court’s general refusal to hear most matters involving \ndivorce and alimony, Ohio ex rel. Popovici v. Agler, 280 \nU.S. 379, 383 (1930), and child custody, Ex parte Burrus, \n136  U.S.  586,  594  (1890),  one  thing  is  clear:    Family \nmatters belong in state court.  See Moore, 442 U.S. at 435.  \nSo “[i]f ever there were an area” for Justice Holmes’s \n“admonition … that ‘a page of history is worth a volume of \nlogic,’” “domestic relations” is it.  Santosky v. Kramer, 455 \n\n22 \nU.S. 745, 770 (1982) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (footnote \nomitted).   \nIn line with that state court-federal court divide, “[t]he \nfederal courts generally have applied Younger abstention \nin a variety of cases implicating underlying state-court \ndomestic relations” issues.  Meredith Johnson Harbach, Is \nthe Family A Federal Question?, 66 WASH.&LEE L.REV.\n131, 150 n.76 (2009) (collecting authorities).  Yet the court \nbelow was unwilling to recognize the heightened state \ninterests  here.    It  thought  that  because  the  federal \ngovernment  provides  some  funding  to  foster  care \nprograms, it “arguably has just as much at stake as West \nVirginia.”  See, e.g., App.36a.  Whether the Fourth Circuit \nwas right goes to federalism’s core.   \n4.   State  sovereignty,  state-court  competence,  and \nstate  primacy  over  domestic  relations  are  all  vital \ninterests—important  enough  to  justify  this  Court’s \nattention.  But at bottom, this case also strikes at another \none of every State’s most critical interests: the well-being \nof  children.    Though  the  court  below  mocked  West \nVirginia, e.g., App.7a (“when all else fails—which it often \ndoes in  West  Virginia”),  the  State  carries  a  deep  and \nabiding interest for its children.  The State “is the ultimate \nprotector of the rights of minors” and has “a substantial \ninterest in providing for their health, safety, and welfare.”  \nIn re Betty J.W., 371 S.E.2d 326, 329 (W. Va. 1988).  The \ndecision below creates uncertainty over how the State’s \nchild welfare system will be administered—and who will \nadminister it.  If left standing, it will erase previously long-\nsettled expectations that state courts will and should take \nthe lead.    \nThe Court should grant review to rectify this unsettling \ndecision.  In this case and those like it, federal courts must \nabstain.     \n\n23 \nII. The Court Should Resolve Whether Federal \nCourts May Refuse To Abstain Under Younger\nBecause Plaintiffs Seek Class-Wide Relief. \nTwo members of the panel refused to stop at ordering \nthe district court not to abstain from child welfare cases \ngenerally.  They also held that Younger was unavailable \nbecause  West  Virginia’s  child  welfare  proceedings \npurportedly  did  not  give  the  plaintiffs  an  adequate \nopportunity to litigate their claims, and those claims did \nnot interfere with ongoing state actions.  The majority \nreasoned  that  the  plaintiffs  were  pursuing  “systemic,” \nclass-wide relief, and the State failed to show that similar \ncollective relief was available in state court.  App.34a-36a.  \nThis holding ignores that without “unambiguous authority \nto the contrary” federal courts must “assume that state \nprocedures will afford an adequate remedy”—particularly \nwhere, as here, “a litigant has not attempted to present his \nfederal  claims  in  related  state-court  proceedings.”  \nPennzoil, 481 U.S. at 15.   \nThe holding also deepens another circuit split, this time \non whether a request for class relief is relevant to Younger \nat all.  Like the first, this split does substantial harm.  \nCourts that factor class relief into their analysis allow \nprocedural rules to warp substantive rights.  Worse still, \nfavoring a federal forum in class cases invites the sort of \nintrusive litigation and far-flung judicial oversight that \nthis Court has said—more than once—does not belong in \nfederal courts.  The Court should intervene on this issue \nas well to ensure that federal courts do not act as indefinite \noverseers of critical state systems. \n\n24 \nThe decision below deepens another circuit \nsplit. \nThe Fourth Circuit jumped into a second crystallized \ncircuit  split  on  a  straightforward  issue:    May  federal \ncourts  decline  to  abstain  under  Younger  whenever  a \nlitigant wants—but might not get—class-wide relief in the \nstate forum?     \n1.  The Tenth and Eleventh Circuits stand on one side \nof the split. \nIn  Joseph  A.,  the  Tenth  Circuit  considered  an \ninstitutional-reform  challenge  to  New  Mexico’s  foster-\ncare system.  275 F.3d at 1253.  Much like the plaintiffs \nhere, those plaintiffs argued that the State’s “Children’s \nCourt” was “not authorized to hear class actions and other \nrepresentative suits.”  Id. at 1274.  The court took that fact \nas true but found it irrelevant.  It sufficed that “no case … \nhold[s] that a party is entitled to avoid the effects of [] \nYounger … where relief is available to individual litigants \nin  ongoing  state  proceedings  but  not  to  represented \nparties in a class action.”  Id.   \nSimilarly, in 31 Foster Children, the Eleventh Circuit \ndescribed  an  earlier  case  in  which  it  abstained  from \ndeciding claims that plaintiffs “could have brought” in \n“individual criminal trials, even though it [was] obvious \nthat  the  broad-sweeping  remedy”  they  wanted  “was \nunavailable there.”  329 F.3d at 1281 n.12 (citing Luckey v. \nMiller, 976 F.2d 673, 676, 679 (11th Cir. 1992)).  That \ncircuit has also doubled down on the idea that state forums \nare adequate if members of a potential federal class could \n“raise[] their claims during their” individual state-court \nproceedings.  Pompey v. Broward Cnty., 95 F.3d 1543, \n1551 (11th Cir. 1996). \n\n25 \nThese decisions track the notion that Younger “does \nnot require that all the procedures for the interposition of \nthe federal defense be as advantageous in the state court \nas in the federal action.”  Kirschner v. Klemons, 225 F.3d \n227, 235 (2d Cir. 2000); accord Boyd v. Mich. Sup. Ct., No. \n95-1180, 1995 WL 538693, at *2-3 (6th Cir. Sept. 8, 1995) \n(affirming  Younger  abstention  despite  argument  that \n“state court relief for a single plaintiff cannot vindicate the \nrights of the affected ‘class’”); Carson P. ex rel. Foreman\nv.  Heineman,  240  F.R.D.  456,  531  (D.  Neb.  2007) \n(existence of class relief irrelevant to Younger analysis). \n2.  On the other side of the divide are the D.C. Circuit \nand, now, the Fourth.  Turning again to LaShawn A., \nthere the D.C. Circuit found that the Family Division of \nthe District’s judiciary was not “an appropriate forum for \n[a] multi-faceted class-action challenge to the [District’s] \nadministration of its entire foster-care system.”  990 F.2d \nat 1323.  The court leaned heavily on the D.C. Superior \nCourt’s  refusal  in  another  case  to  hear  claims  that \nstretched beyond the disposition of a single child.  Id.   \nBuilding in part on LaShawn A., the Fourth Circuit \nwent further—holding that any ability to bring a claim in \nsystemic  fashion  that  does  not  include  everything  a \nfederal  class  action  permits  renders  the  state  forum \ninadequate.    See  App.34a-36a,  39a-40a;  see  also,  e.g., \nTinsley, 156 F. Supp. 3d at 1040-41 (“[I]t does not appear \nPlaintiffs could raise their classwide claims or pursue the \nsystemic reforms they seek within the framework of the \nperiodic review hearings in the juvenile courts.”); Perry, \n799 F. Supp. 2d at 721-22 (“[T]here is no indication that \n[plaintiffs] could seek or obtain [in state court] the type of \nwide-ranging injunctive and declaratory relief that they \ndesire [as a class].”). \n\n26 \n3.  Finally, the Fifth Circuit seems to take a half-loaf \nposition.  In Bice v. LouisianaPublic Defense Board, that \ncourt rejected the argument that “[r]elief sought on behalf \nof  an  uncertified  class  should  be  considered  in  the \nYounger abstention analysis.”  677 F.3d 712, 720 (5th Cir. \n2012)  (emphasis  added).    It  deliberately  left  open  the \npossibility, though, that a state court’s lack of a class-wide \nremedy might make it inadequate in cases where a class \nhas been certified.  See id. at 720 n.8 (distinguishing a \ndistrict court opinion finding state forums inadequate to \naddress “systemic concerns” because “a class had already \nbeen certified before the court decided whether to abstain \nunder Younger”); but see, e.g., Hernandez v. Finley, 471 \nF. Supp. 516, 521 (N.D. Ill. 1978) (explaining that district \ncourts should reach Younger abstention “first and only \ndetermine  class  certification  if  dismissal  based  on \nabstention is not proper”). \nAgain one thing is plain:  The circuits do not agree.     \nThe split raises serious questions about \nclass actions and the role of federal courts \nin overseeing state institutions. \nUsually the “breadth of a challenge to a complex state \nstatutory  scheme”  “militate[s]  in  favor  of  abstention.”  \nMoore, 442 U.S. at 427 (emphasis in original).  Moore thus \nrejected the argument that a suit belonged in federal court \nbecause  it  challenged  a  State’s  entire  child  custody \nsystem.    Id.  at  426.    The  Fourth  Circuit  flipped  that \nstandard, finding that the “wide-reaching, intertwined, … \n‘systemic,’” and class-wide nature of the relief plaintiffs \nseek  counseled  against  abstention.    App.34a.    That \ninversion creates two problems that justify the Court’s \nattention. \n\n27 \n1.  The first:  The Fourth Circuit’s decision elevates \nthe ability to pursue a class action to a substantive-right \nstatus it has never enjoyed before.  A litigant’s right “to \nemploy Rule 23 is a procedural right only, ancillary to the \nlitigation  of  substantive  claims.”    Deposit  Guar.  Nat’l \nBank v. Roper, 445 U.S. 326, 332 (1980).  Thus, the class-\naction rule “leaves the parties’ legal rights and duties \nintact and the rules of decision unchanged.”  Shady Grove \nOrthopedic Assocs., P.A. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393, \n408 (2010) (opinion of Scalia, J.).  By allowing the existence \n(or non-existence) of this procedural right in state court to \ndetermine whether plaintiffs must be allowed to pursue \ntheir claims in a federal forum, the Fourth Circuit rewrote \nthe parties’ legal rights.  That was wrong.  See Wal-Mart \nStores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 367 (2011) (rejecting \nan  attempt  to  the  use  class-action  rule  to  change  a \ndefendant’s defenses); cf. Roper, 445 U.S. at 355 (Powell, \nJ., dissenting) (“[T]he Court’s concern for compensation \nof putative class members,” which led it to tweak the \nmootness standard, was “at worst inconsistent with the \ncommand of the Rules Enabling Act.”). \nThe decision below shows how things go awry when \ncourts  elevate  the  class-action  rule  to  the  level  of \nsubstantive  right—especially  before  any  court  has \ndecided that a class should be certified in the first place.  \nFor example, the Fourth Circuit found that class relief \nmust be available to help individual plaintiffs overcome \nproblems like standing and mootness.  See App.34a-35a.  \nBut no authority holds that a class must be in the offing \nany time an individual plaintiff might otherwise struggle \nto mount a case.  Cf. Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 552 \n(2011) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (finding that no “procedural \nprinciple justifies certifying a class of plaintiffs so they \nmay  assert  a  claim  of  systemic  unconstitutionality”).  \nStanding  and  mootness,  after  all,  are  not  arbitrary \n\n28 \n“hurdles” thrown in a plaintiff’s way, but constitutional \nrequirements grounded in Article III.  App.34a.   \nLikewise,  the  decision  below  speculates  that  an \nindividual plaintiff may face problems summoning enough \nevidence  to  support  relief  without  help  from  a  class.  \nApp.34a-35a.  But here again, no case suggests that the \nchallenges of building a case should justify twisting legal \ndoctrines to make it easier.  A plaintiff wanting to take on \na big case will often have to bear big responsibilities.  \nAbstention is concerned with whether the plaintiff can \nraise his or her claims in the state forum, not whether \nraising them in federal court is easier.   \nAnd  all  in  all,  the  Fourth  Circuit  confused  Rule \n23(b)(3)’s superiority analysis with the adequacy aspect of \nYounger.    See,  e.g.,  App.35a-36a  (relying  on  authority \ndescribing some of the reasons why class actions can be \nsuperior  in  explaining  why  West  Virginia  courts  are \npurportedly  inadequate).    It  must  be  said  for  a  third \ntime—no authority supports that approach.   \n2.  The second problem:  The Fourth Circuit greenlit \nthe sort of institutional oversight of state institutions by \nfederal courts that this Court repudiated in O’Shea.  That \ncase  precluded  “an  ongoing  federal  audit  of  state … \nproceedings.”  O’Shea, 414 U.S. at 500.  It took particular \nissue with federal proceedings that could impair state-\ncourt  administration—permitting  those  suits  “would \nindirectly  accomplish  the  kind  of  interference  that \nYounger … and related cases sought to prevent.”  Id.  As \nthe Tenth Circuit has explained, “O’Shea and its progeny \nsuggest[]  that  federal  court  oversight  of  state  court \noperations, even if not framed as direct review of state \ncourt judgments, may nevertheless be problematic for \nYounger purposes.”  Joseph A., 275 F.3d at 1271.  And \nO’Shea works hand-in-hand with more recent decisions \n\n29 \nwarning  about  the  “sensitive  federalism  concerns” \ninherent in “institutional reform litigation”; concerns that \nare “heightened” when that litigation “has the effect of \ndictating  state  or  local  budget  priorities.”    Horne  v. \nFlores, 557 U.S. 433, 448 (2009). \nThe “systemic” relief the plaintiffs seek here would \nrequire pervasive institutional oversight in every sense.  It \nwould involve “intensive, context-specific legal inquiry” to \ndetermine whether DHHR submits the right plans, makes \nthe right placements, offers the right services, and keeps \nthe right children in state custody for the right amount of \ntime.  Courthouse News Serv. v. Planet, 750 F.3d 776, 791 \n(9th Cir. 2014).  State courts, with continuing state-law \njurisdiction over child welfare cases, would be relegated to \nsomething  approaching  an  “assistant  manager”  role.  \nEach  of  their  judgments  would  be  subject  to  direct \nfederal-court review—precisely the interference O’Shea \nand the many cases like it rejected.   \nThe district court realized that it didn’t take a seer to \npredict this result.  The relief at stake—including a federal \n“monitor” to “implement and oversee” the court’s order—\nis  “highly  problematic”  because  it  would  “interfere \nextensively  with  ongoing  state  court  proceedings”  as \n“articulated in O’Shea.”  App.75a-78a.  The potential for \nindefinite federal oversight of state child welfare systems \nthrough  watered  down  abstention  standards  is  not \nconfined to West Virginia, either.  Quite the opposite.  \nMost of the States have faced or are currently facing \nsimilar broad-ranging institutional reform suits in this \narea.  See, e.g., A.A. v. Buckner, No. 2:21-cv-367 (M.D. Ala. \nMay 20, 2021); Jeremiah M. v. Crumb, No. 3:22-cv-00129 \n(D. Alaska May 19, 2022); Bryan C. v. Lambrew, No. 1:21-\ncv-00005 (D. Me. Jan. 6, 2021); G.K. v. Sununu, No. 1:21-\ncv-00004 (D.N.H. Jan. 5, 2021); Elisa W. v. New York, No. \n\n30 \n1:15-cv-05273 (S.D.N.Y. July 8, 2015); Wyatt B. v. Brown, \nNo. 6:19-cv-00556 (D. Or. Apr. 16, 2019).  \nFinally,  the  Fourth  Circuit’s  new  amenability  to \nsystem-wide litigation challenging state-wide systems is \nnot limited to the child welfare context.  The decision \nbelow gives all future institutional-reform plaintiffs who \nmight otherwise face a Younger problem a simple way out: \nplead a claim for class relief.  Justices have condemned \nfederal  courts’  attempts  to  “direct[]  or  manage[]  the \nreconstruction of entire institutions and bureaucracies” \nbefore.    Missouri  v.  Jenkins,  515  U.S.  70,  126  (1995) \n(Thomas, J., concurring).  State courts are at least “the \nlegatees  of  a  considerable  tradition  of  state  judicial \nsupervision  over  the  activities  and  affairs  of  local \ngovernment.”    JOHN  MARTINEZ, LOCAL  GOVERNMENT \nLAW § 29:8 (2022 supp.).  The same cannot be said about \nfederal courts.  But with a new get-out-of-abstention-free \ncard  in  hand,  institutional-reform  plaintiffs  can  more \naggressively  seek  broad  forms  of  relief  and  federal \nmonitoring  against  state-related  targets.    The  Fourth \nCircuit’s  “decision  not  only  affirms  the  structural \ninjunction but vastly expands its use.”  Brown, 563 U.S. at \n555 (Scalia, J., dissenting). \nThe Court should grant certiorari to address these \nimportant concerns.  A State’s decision not to mirror Rule \n23 in all state forums should not allow federal courts to \nabstain.   \nIII. The Decision Below Is Wrong—But The Right \nVehicle For Review. \nThe Fourth Circuit should have required abstention.  \nState courts can vindicate federal rights.  Federal courts \ncan too, but only with “sensitivity to [] legitimate [state] \ninterests”  and  without  “unduly  interfer[ing]  with \n\n31 \nlegitimate [state] activities.”  Younger, 401 U.S. at 44.  The \ndecision below shows no sensitivity—the court hardened \nitself to West Virginia’s legitimate interests.  \nA.  The  Fourth  Circuit  should  not  have  limited  its \nYounger  analysis  to  the  quarterly  post-adjudication \nhearing  phase  of  West  Virginia’s  child  welfare \nproceedings.  App.21a-23a.  Those hearings are part of a \nsingle,  unified  case  in  which  state  courts  make  and \ncontinuously  assess  decisions  regarding  placement, \nreunification, and permanency.  W.VA.CODE §§ 49-4-102, \n49-4-110.  By divorcing the hearings from everything that \ncomes before, the court below ignored the full context it \nneeded  to  determine  whether  federal  oversight  is \n“antipathetic to established principles of comity.”  O’Shea, \n414 U.S. at 501. \nAnyway, the Fourth Circuit was wrong in thinking \nthat  the  quarterly  hearings  do  not  qualify  as  civil \nenforcement.  A state actor “routinely [is] a party” in civil \nenforcement “and often initiates the action.”  Sprint, 571 \nU.S. at 79.  So too here.  See W.VA.CODE§§ 49-4-402, 49-\n4-501.    Yet  the  court  dismissed  the  hearings  as \n“conciliatory,”  App.21a-22a,  contrasting  the  intent  to \n“sanction”  that  Sprint  highlighted,  571  U.S.  at  79-80.  \nTrue, these hearings are rooted in rehabilitation and care, \nnot  punishment.    But  so  are  the  State’s  indisputably \ncriminal  juvenile-justice  proceedings.    And  make  no \nmistake:    Real  liberty—including  “institutionalization,” \ntermination  of  parental  rights,  “or  other  similar \nrestraint[s]”—is at stake.  DeShaney v. Winnebago Cnty. \nDep’t of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 200 (1989); W.VA.CODE\n§§ 49-4-110, 49-4-608.  The court below also ignored that \nabuse-and-neglect  proceedings  use  the  cardinal  “due \nprocess protections for a criminal trial.”  Doe v. Univ. of \nKy.,  860  F.3d  365,  370  (6th  Cir.  2017).    Children  and \n\n32 \nparents alike have rights to counsel, to be heard, to cross-\nexamine, to the rules of evidence, and to elevated burdens \nof proof.  W.VA.CODE §§ 49-4-110, 49-4-601, 49-4-701.  The \nFourth Circuit should have recognized these marks of \nproceedings “akin to a criminal prosecution.”  Sprint, 571 \nU.S. at 79 (cleaned up). \nB. The  Fourth  Circuit  also  misapplied  Younger’s \nthird category,  which  covers  orders  “uniquely  in \nfurtherance of the state courts’ ability to perform their \njudicial functions.”  Sprint, 571 U.S. at 78.  It held that \nletting the federal case proceed would not interfere with \nthe state courts’ power to issue initial orders concerning \nfoster  children’s  placement  and  care.    App.25a.    That \nconclusion is wrong on the law.  For one, its presumption \nthat “court orders will be obeyed,” App.25a, means that \nthe federal court’s orders will almost certainly conflict \nwith  competing  state  orders  from  the  quarterly \nproceedings, which monitor “compliance” with the case \nplan  and  constitute  “judgment[s]  of  [the]  court.”  \nPennzoil, 481 U.S. at 13-14; W.VA.CODE § 49-4-110.  The \nquarterly proceedings are also “integral to” West Virginia \n“court[s’] ability to” administer the child welfare system, \na core “judicial function” in domestic affairs.  See Falco v.\nJust. of the Matrimonial Parts of Sup. Ct. of Suffolk \nCnty., 805 F.3d 425, 428 (2d Cir. 2015) (recognizing the \nthird Younger category applied to a court order, after a \ncustody dispute, regarding payment for a child guardian).  \nLetting federal jurisdiction override the status hearings \nwould thus undermine the system from start to finish.   \nC.  And the Fourth Circuit was wrong in believing that \nthe  plaintiffs’  requested  relief  would  only  “enjoin  the \nDepartment’s actions.”  App.24a (emphasis in original).  \nEven  if  relief  were  directed  solely  to  DHHR,  what \nhappens when a state court believes that foster care is “in \n\n33 \naccordance  with  federal  standards,”  App.52a,  but  the \nfederal court disagrees?  Who decides whether a child \nneeds  out-of-state  or  institutionalized  care—the  state \ncourt tasked to do so by statute, W.VA.CODE § 49-4-608, \nor the federal court Respondents ask to limit this very \npossibility?    App.7a-9a,  50a.    Refusing  abstention  is \nvirtually certain to render some West Virginia state-court \njudgments “nugatory.”  Pennzoil, 481 U.S. at 14 n.12. \nD.  Perhaps the only good news here is that this case \nis a clean vehicle to rectify these issues.  The doctrines at \nstake are straightforward and legal.  Factual disputes do \nnot cloud the issues; the features of West Virginia’s state-\ncourt-directed child welfare system are set by statute.  \nThe decision below took a firm—but misguided—position \non the legal questions, consciously putting itself at odds \nwith other courts of appeals.  Nor is this a request for case-\nspecific error-correction.  As noted above, using federal \njurisdiction to force system-wide change to state child \nwelfare  regimes  is  no  one-off.    The  Fourth  Circuit’s \napproach  conflicts  with  decisions  of  this  Court,  other \nfederal courts, and basic constitutional norms.  The Court \nshould intervene and set it right. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should grant the Petition. \n\n34 \nRespectfully submitted.\nPATRICK MORRISEY LINDSAY S.SEE\n  Attorney General    Solicitor General \n  Counsel of Record\nOFFICE OF THE \nWEST VIRGINIA  MICHAEL R.WILLIAMS\nATTORNEY GENERAL   Senior Deputy Solicitor \nState Capitol Complex  General \nBuilding 1, Room E-26 \nCharleston, WV 25305  GRANT A.NEWMAN* \nlindsay.s.see@wvago.gov    Special Counsel \n(304) 558-2021 \nMAX A.SCHREIBER** \n  Fellow \n*admitted in Michigan; \npracticing under supervision of \nWest Virginia attorneys \n**admitted in Indiana;  \npracticing under supervision of \nWest Virginia attorneys \nCounsel for Petitioners  ",

The State’s child welfare system is the last hope for children who have \nbeen physically abused, sexually abused, or neglected and left to fend for themselves, or all of the \nabove.  And it is undisputed that the opioid crisis has made the State’s task considerably harder: \nthe number of children in foster care in West Virginia has increased by a staggering 80 percent, \nfrom approximately 4,000 in 2010 to 6,633 in 2017.1   \nThe Defendants have met these challenges head-on, with transparency, determination, and \ninnovation.  For example, in 2015, the State implemented the Safe at Home West Virginia \ndemonstration to provide intensive behavioral health services to adolescent children at risk of \nresidential treatment to keep them in their homes and communities.  Earlier this year, the \nlegislature enacted H.B. 2010, which creates a comprehensive managed care program specifically \ndesigned to improve the availability and coordination of community health services and social \nservices for foster children; establishes a Foster Care Ombudsman to advocate for foster children \nand foster parents, investigate complaints, and monitor compliance with state and federal law and \npolicies, among other things; and mandates the creation of new minimum standards for certifying \nfoster homes.  See W. Va. Code § 9-5-27; W. Va. Code § 49-2-107.  In addition, as noted in the \nComplaint, the State recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice (“DOJ”) in which the State commits to significantly expand community \n                                                 \n1 See Annie E. Casey Foundation, Children in Foster Care in West Virginia, Kids Count Data \nCenter  (table)  https://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/tables/6243-children-in-foster-\ncare#detailed/2/50/false/871,870,573,869,36,868,867,133,38,35/any/12987 (updated Oct. 2019).  \n \n\n \nmental health services for children with serious mental health or behavioral disorders, many of \nwhom end up in the State’s custody.  \nMany of the State’s efforts are reflected in the most recent Child and Family Service Plan \nthat the State has submitted to the Children’s Bureau within the U.S. Department of Health and \nHuman Services, which closely supervises state child welfare programs receiving federal funds.2  \nThe  State  and  the  Children’s  Bureau  are  also in  the  process  of  finalizing  West  Virginia’s \n“Performance Improvement Plan” arising out of its most recent Child and Family Services Review, \nwhich is a periodic review undertaken by state and federal officials, working together, to rigorously \nevaluate the strengths and need for improvement in every state’s child welfare program, 45 C.F.R. \n§ 1355.33(b)(1).   \nPrior to initiating this litigation, Plaintiffs’ counsel never once contacted Department of \nHealth and Human Resources (“DHHR”) leadership to learn about the State’s efforts to improve \nthe child welfare system or to discuss their apparent concerns with that system.  Instead, Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel filed a Complaint to seize control of the foster care program from state officials and hand \nit over to a court-appointed monitor.  This Complaint follows the template of the two other \ncomplaints Plaintiffs’ counsel has filed in the last eight months against two other States: heart-\nrending allegations regarding individual children; system-wide allegations based on frank public \nassessments by state officials that are then used against them; cookie-cutter causes of action that \nbear little or no relationship to the facts alleged; and virtually identical prayers for relief, all of \n                                                 \n2  A  copy  of  the  Child  and  Family  Service  Plan  is  publicly  available  at: \nhttps://dhhr.wv.gov/bcf/Reports/Documents/West%20Virginia%20Child%20and%20Family%20\nService%20Plan%20%28CFSP%29%202019-2024.pdf.   “In reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, \n[the court] may properly take judicial notice of matters of public record.”  Philips v. Pitt County \nMemorial Hosp., 572 F.3d 176, 180 (4th Cir. 2009).  For the convenience of the Court, this public \ndocument is reproduced in the Appendix.  \n2 \n \n\n \nwhich call for appointing a third-party monitor to oversee the program.  See Complaint, Wyatt B. \nv. Brown, No. 19-cv-00556 (D. Or. Apr. 16, 2019); Complaint, Ashley W. v. Holcomb, 19-cv-\n00129 (S.D. Ind. June 25, 2019).   \nIn West Virginia’s case, some of the allegations in the Complaint are wrong, some display \na lack of familiarity with West Virginia’s child welfare system, and some are true but wholly \ndevoid of context.  But Defendants do not believe this Court will need to sort out which is which, \nbecause Plaintiffs’ claims do not belong in federal district court.  First, principles of federalism \nand comity mandate that this Court abstain from ongoing oversight of child welfare decisions over \nwhich the state courts have exclusive and continuous jurisdiction.  Second, the federal laws upon \nwhich Plaintiffs premise their claims do not provide a basis for the relief that they are seeking. \nDismissing the Complaint does not mean the Plaintiffs are without a remedy.  Each of the \nnamed Plaintiffs (like all children in foster care) has an ongoing matter in state circuit court, in \nwhich the child’s placement, service plan, and permanency plan are reviewed every 90 days by a \ncircuit court judge.  Every child in foster care in West Virginia also has an attorney acting as a \nGuardian ad Litem who is obligated to represent the child’s best interests before the court.   \nAdministration of the child welfare program in West Virginia is challenging, complex, and \ndynamic, requiring DHHR to work closely not only with state legislators and state judges, but also \nwith its federal counterparts at the Children’s Bureau and now with DOJ.  All of these state and \nfederal officials are already working together to achieve the system-wide improvements that \nPlaintiffs now ask this Court to order, oversee, and monitor.  The Court does not have jurisdiction \nto do so, nor do Plaintiffs make a legally cognizable claim for the relief they seek.  The Complaint \nshould be dismissed.   \n \n3 \n \n\n \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nWhen a Rule 12 motion is based on more than one ground, the court should consider the \n12(b)(1) challenge first because, if it must dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter \njurisdiction, all other defenses and objections become moot.  See Sucampo Pharm., Inc. v. Astellas \nPharma, Inc., 471 F.3d 544, 548 (4th Cir. 2006).  Under Rule 12(b)(1), the party asserting federal \njurisdiction has the burden of proving subject matter jurisdiction.  Richmond, Fredericksburg & \nPotomac R. Co. v. U.S., 945 F.2d 765, 768 (4th Cir. 1991) (citing Adams v. Bain, 697 F.2d 1213, \n1219 (4th Cir. 1982)).  Under Rule 12(b)(6), the court must “accept as true all well-pleaded facts \nin a complaint and construe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.”  Matherly v. Andrews, \n859 F.3d 264, 274 (4th Cir. 2017).  However, “[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of \naction, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice” to survive a motion to dismiss.  \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  Further, “the tenet that a court must accept as true all \nof the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions.”  Id.     \nARGUMENT \nI.  THE COURT DOES NOT HAVE, OR SHOULD NOT EXERCISE, JURISDICTION \nOVER CHILD WELFARE DECISIONS OF WEST VIRGINIA STATE COURTS.     \nThe complaint should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Rule \n12(b)(1).  Plaintiffs’ claims and requested relief seek federal court review and ongoing oversight \nof West Virginia’s courts.  The issues raised are ones that could be, should be, and in some cases \nhave been raised in state court.  As the U.S. Supreme Court has explained, under principles of \ncomity and federalism, federal courts should not “conclude that state processes are unequal to the \ntask of accommodating the various interests and deciding the constitutional questions that may \narise in child-welfare litigation.”  See Moore v. Sims, 442 U.S. 415, 435 (1979).    \n4 \n \n\n \nA.  West Virginia’s Circuit Courts Have Exclusive and Ongoing Jurisdiction Over \nChild Welfare Proceedings. \nIn West Virginia, the circuit courts exercise continuous oversight over every foster child’s \ninterests throughout the duration of their time in the custody of DHHR.  This jurisdiction extends \nto children removed from their families due to abuse or neglect, youths who have committed status \noffenses, and youths who have been adjudicated as delinquent.   \nFor abuse and neglect cases, circuit court jurisdiction begins the moment a petition is filed \nto remove a child from the home.  W. Va. Code § 49-4-303.3  Once such a petition is filed, “the \ncourt may order that the child” be removed only if it finds that the child is in “imminent danger” \nwith “no reasonably available alternatives,” and that “continuation in the home is contrary to the \nbest interests of the child.”  Id. § 49-4-602.  The court must also determine whether DHHR “made \nreasonable efforts to preserve the family” or whether an “emergency situation made those efforts \nunreasonable or impossible.”  Id. § 49-4-602(a).   \nAfter the petition is filed, the circuit court appoints counsel for the child to serve as a \nGuardian ad Litem; a court-appointed special advocate representative for the child (if available in \nthat county); and additional counsel for any parent, guardian, or custodian named in the petition.  \nW. Va. Code § 49-4-601; West Virginia Rules of Procedure for Child Abuse and Neglect \nProceedings (hereinafter “WV Rule”), WV Rule 52.  In addition, a multi-disciplinary treatment \nteam – which includes case managers, parents, foster parents, attorneys, counsel, the child, and \nanyone else “who may assist in providing recommendations for” the child’s needs – is assigned to \nthe child’s case and must be convened within 30 days of removal.  W. Va. Code § 49-4-405; WV \n                                                 \n3  This section sets forth a truncated description of West Virginia court process.  A fuller \ndescription is detailed in the West Virginia “Judicial Benchbook,” which is a public document \navailable  at  http://www.courtswv.gov/public-resources/2017-AandN-Benchbook.pdf.  For  the \nconvenience of the Court, this public document is reproduced in the Appendix.   \n5 \n \n\n \nRule 51(a).  The multi-disciplinary treatment team is required to meet at least quarterly, during the \nduration of the time the child is in the custody of DHHR, “to assess, plan and implement a \ncomprehensive, individualized service plan,” and “advise the court” through “written reports” as \nto the “types of services” and “type of placement” “which will best serve” the child’s needs.  § 49-\n4-405.   \nIf a multi-disciplinary treatment team determines that an out-of-home placement will best \nserve the needs of the child, the team must first consider placement with appropriate relatives, also \ncalled a “kinship” placement.  If the team determines there is no appropriate kinship placement, \nthen it will consider foster care homes, facilities, or programs located within the State.  § 49-4-\n406.  The team may only recommend placement in an out-of-state facility if it concludes, after \nconsidering the best interests and overall needs of the child, that there is no available and suitable \nin-state placement.  Id.   \nThe multi-disciplinary treatment team’s placement determination is effectively only a \nrecommendation to the circuit court, which must approve all placements as in the best interests of \nthe child and may order “modification” of a case plan “by reason of [its] findings.”  WV Rule \n35(b)(1).  In addition, the circuit court’s role does not end after it approves of the initial placement \nand plan.  At least every 90 days, for the duration of the child’s time in DHHR custody, the circuit \ncourt must hold a hearing or otherwise review, and issue an order regarding, “the safety of the \nchild,” “the continuing necessity for and appropriateness of the placement,” “compliance with the \ncase  plan,”  and  the  “progress . . .  toward  alleviating  or  mitigating  the  causes  necessitating \nplacement in foster care,” and “a likely date” for permanent placement.  § 49-4-110(a).  “The court \nretains exclusive jurisdiction over placement of the child . . . as well as over any subsequent \nrequests for modification.”  WV Rule 6; WV Rule 36(e); § 49-4-606. \n6 \n \n\n \nSimilar  processes  for  court  oversight  of  placement  and  treatment  exist  for  children \nadjudicated to the custody of DHHR and placed into foster care on the basis of status or juvenile \noffenses.  W. Va. Code § 49-4-701, et seq. \nB.  The Rooker-Feldman Doctrine Bars Federal Court Review of State Court \nDecisions. \nUnder Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 412 (1923), and District of Columbia Court \nof Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462 (1983), a federal district court cannot directly review a state \ncourt decision or entertain a claim that is “inextricably intertwined” with a state court decision, \nunless Congress has specifically authorized it.  Feldman, 460 U.S. at 483-84 n. 16.    \nAs this Court and others have repeatedly held, the Rooker-Feldman limitation on federal \ncourt jurisdiction applies to review of state court child welfare decisions.  Those decisions present \nissues of a “highly sensitive” and “delicate” nature that “[w]ithout question . . . are first and \nforemost the concerns of state courts.”  Stewart v. Logan Cty. Dep’t. of Health & Human Servs., \n2013 WL 3821282, at *2 (S.D. W.Va. 2013) (unpublished); see also Stratton v. Mecklenburg Cty. \nDep’t. of Soc. Servs., 521 Fed. App’x 278, 288–89 (4th Cir. 2013) (unpublished); Tacza v. Martin, \n2019 WL 3928658, at *3 (S.D. W.Va. 2019) (unpublished); Duby v. Moran, 901 F.Supp. 215, 216-\n217 (S.D. W.Va. 1995).   \nThe  gravamen  of  Plaintiffs’  Complaint  is  that  West  Virginia  foster  children  are  in \ninappropriate placements (e.g., residential treatment instead of family homes; foster family homes \ninstead of kinship placements; kinship that do not meet all certification standards).  But placement \ndecisions are ultimately state court decisions, not the decision of DHHR or any of the Defendants.  \nSee  § 49-4-606;  Rule  6;  Rule  36(e)  (“The  circuit  court . . .  has  exclusive  jurisdiction  over \nplacement of the child.”).  In Tacza, this Court recently dismissed a plaintiff’s suit challenging her \ngranddaughter’s placement with a foster family, concluding that the alleged injuries “derive[] not \n7 \n \n\n \nfrom the actions of Defendants but from the state court’s order.”  2019 WL 3928658, at *2.  (“[T]he \nultimate injury Plaintiff alleges – that her granddaughter was placed with a foster family instead \nof with her – is the result of the state court’s order,” and “the state court – not Defendants – \nultimately found that it was appropriate to separate siblings.”).  Id.  That is also true in this case: \nthe placements about which the Plaintiffs complain “derive not from the actions of the Defendants \nbut from the state court’s order[s].” \nThe Rooker-Feldman analysis does not change simply because there are several plaintiffs \nin this case instead of one, or because the relief sought is system-wide.  As the Fourth Circuit has \nheld, “review of a state court decision . . . cast . . . in general constitutional terms” must still be \ndismissed  under  Rooker-Feldman,  because  the  plaintiff’s  broader  challenges  to  the  state’s \npractices are “inextricably intertwined with the specific adjudications already made by the state \ncourt” in a specific case.  Berry v. South Carolina Dept. of Soc. Servs., 121 F.3d 697 (table), 1997 \nWL 499950, at *2 (4th Cir. 1997) (unpublished); see also Feldman, 460 U.S. at 486–87; Guess v. \nBd. of Med. Examiners of State of N.C., 967 F.2d 998, 1002-04 (4th Cir. 1992); Czura v. Supreme \nCourt of South Carolina, 813 F.2d 644, 646 (4th Cir. 1987).  \nThere is no question here that Plaintiffs seek federal court oversight of circuit court \nplacement decisions.  For example, the Plaintiffs seek a court order requiring an “outside entity” \nto “determine the full range and number of appropriate foster care placements”; requiring that \n“outside entity” to monitor that “all children . . . are placed in a safe home or facility”; and \nrequiring “all children with physical, mental, intellectual, or cognitive disability . . . receive foster \ncare services in the most integrated setting appropriate.”  Compl. ¶ 405.  The result would be the \nsame as that presented in Tacza, only writ large: federal court review of existing and future state \n8 \n \n\n \ncourt child placement decisions for the named plaintiffs and, if a class is certified, for all West \nVirginia foster children.   \nFurther, even the relief the Plaintiffs seek apart from court oversight of child placement \ninvolves decisions over which the state circuit court has jurisdiction and issues orders.  The multi-\ndisciplinary treatment teams are convened under the authority of the court; the child’s service and \npermanency plans are provided to and approved by the court; and the court must determine, among \nother things, the child or family’s need for services or treatment, and issue any necessary orders \nfor examinations and evaluations.  See W. Va. Code § 49-4-602(a)(1)(B), § 49-4-602(b)(1), (b)(5); \nState ex rel. Aaron M. v. W. Virginia Dep’t of Health & Human Resources, 212 W. Va. 323, 324 \n(2001) (reviewing court’s order of “medical care, treatment, and services”); Judicial Benchbook, \nCh. 2, pp. 7, 14 (disposition hearing and case plan checklist; permanency hearing and permanency \nplan checklist).  Yet, under the requested relief, the Plaintiffs are asking this Court – through an \noutside monitor – to also review all of those plans and resulting court orders to determine if each \nchild had an “an adequate and individualized written case plan for treatment, services, and supports \nto address the child’s identified needs.”  See Comp. ¶ 405(a)(iii).  \nEven Plaintiffs’ claims for relief that are not directly related to the placement, plans, and \nservices of individual children – for example, the request that this Court order DHHR to “hire, \nemploy, and retain an adequate number of qualified and appropriately trained caseworkers” – \ninterfere with the decisions of the West Virginia state courts.  These courts of general jurisdiction \nare able to hear, and in some cases have heard, challenges to DHHR’s staffing at CPS and its \ntraining of CPS workers. \n \n \n9 \n \n\n \nC.  The Younger Doctrine Likewise Requires Abstention from Interference in \nOngoing State Court Proceedings.   \nTo the extent Plaintiffs contend that Rooker-Feldman does not apply because they are not \nasking this Court to review existing state court decisions, but rather seek oversight only of future \nplacement decisions, the line of cases beginning with Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971), also \nrequires abstention.   \nStemming from principles of “comity and federalism,” and “from a recognition that state \ncourts are as capable as federal courts of deciding federal and constitutional issues,” the Younger \ndoctrine requires a federal court to abstain from exercising jurisdiction when the relief sought \nwould: (1) enjoin or interfere with a state proceeding; (2) that “implicate[s] important state \ninterests”  and  (3)  “offer[s]  an  adequate  opportunity  for  presentation  of  the  federal  and \nconstitutional claims.”  Berry, 1997 WL 499950, at *3; see Middlesex Cty. Ethics Comm. v. \nGarden State Bar Ass’n, 457 U.S. 423, 432 (1982); O’Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488 (1974); 31 \nFoster Children v. Bush, 329 F.3d 1255, 1274 (11th Cir. 2003); J.B. ex rel. Hart v. Valdez, 186 \nF.3d 1280, 1291 (10th Cir. 1999).   \nThis case satisfies each of the three requirements under Younger. \nFirst, Plaintiffs seek relief that would enjoin and interfere with West Virginia circuit court’s \nongoing state child welfare proceedings.  See Section I.A., supra (describing circuit court’s \ncontinuous oversight of child welfare proceedings); In re T.M. and S.M., No. 19-0068, 2019 WL \n5875222, at *6 (W. Va. 2019) (“[T]he circuit court retains jurisdiction to oversee the custodial \nplacement of children subject to abuse and neglect proceedings . . . as well as any future custody, \nvisitation, or support proceedings”).  Federal courts have repeatedly held that state child welfare \nproceedings are “ongoing state proceedings” for purposes of Younger.  See 31 Foster Children, \n329 F.3d at 1277; J.B. ex rel. Hart, 186 F.3d at 1291 (holding that “the continuing jurisdiction of \n10 \n \n\n \nthe [juvenile] court to modify a child’s disposition . . . coupled with the mandatory six-month \nperiodic review hearings . . . constitutes an ongoing state judicial proceeding”); Berry, 1997 WL \n499950, at *4 (holding that since “the Family Courts retain jurisdiction over the … children” in \n“the child custody and welfare proceedings,” “were the [federal] court to grant the injunctive relief \nrequested by [Plaintiff] it would plainly be violating the doctrine of [Younger] abstention”). \nIn O’Shea, class plaintiffs sought to enjoin allegedly discriminatory practices by state \ncourts in setting bond, sentencing, and imposing jury fees “that might take place in the course of \nfuture state criminal trials.”  414 U.S. at 500.  The defendant objected under Younger “to \nunwarranted anticipatory interference in the state criminal process by means of continuous or \npiecemeal interruptions of the state proceedings by litigation in the federal courts,” id., and the \nSupreme Court agreed, holding that such an injunction “‘would require for its enforcement the \ncontinuous supervision by the federal court over the conduct’ of the state judicial officers.”  Suggs \nv. Brannon, 804 F.2d 274, 279 (4th Cir. 1986) (quoting O’Shea, 414 U.S. at 501).  In other words, \n“Younger governs whenever the requested relief would interfere with the state court’s ability to \nconduct proceedings, regardless of whether the relief targets the conduct of a proceeding directly.”  \nJoseph A. ex rel. Wolfe v. Ingram, 275 F.3d 1253, 1272 (10th Cir. 2002).   \nSuch  “unwarranted  anticipatory  interference”  is  precisely  Plaintiffs’  objective  here.  \nO’Shea, 404 U.S. at 500.  Plaintiffs seek a federal court order handing supervision of what has \nlong been handled in West Virginia circuit court proceedings to this Court and an outside \n“monitor” tasked with overseeing placement and treatment decisions.  Under this relief, all circuit \ncourt orders – relating to the placement of a child, the provision of treatment and services, or \nplanning for the child’s permanency – would be subject to review by the monitor, and the circuit \ncourt’s decision about what is in the best interest of the child could very well conflict (and \n11 \n \n\n \npresumably will conflict in many instances) with the views of that monitor.  As in O’Shea, this \nenforcement would require nothing less than “an ongoing federal audit of state [child welfare] \nproceedings which would indirectly accomplish the kind of interference that Younger . . . sought \nto prevent.”  Id.  As the Supreme Court has stated regarding a state’s child welfare system: \nThe breadth of a challenge to a complex state statutory scheme has \ntraditionally  militated  in favor of  abstention,  not against it . . . \nreflect[ing] the same sensitivity to the primacy of the State in the \ninterpretation of its own laws and the cost to our federal system of \ngovernment inherent in federal-court interpretation and subsequent \ninvalidation of parts of an integrated statutory framework.   \n \nMoore, 442 U.S. at 427.   \nSecond, the interference with the state circuit court proceedings pursued by Plaintiffs \n“implicate[s] important state interests.” Middlesex, 457 U.S. at 432; Moore, 442 U.S. at 416, 423; \nJ.B. ex rel. Hart, 186 F.3d at 1291.  The relief requested by Plaintiffs is particularly inconsistent \nwith Younger’s principles of comity and federalism given the State’s historic and compelling \ninterest in ensuring proper care of its own children, including those most vulnerable.  See, e.g., \nSantosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 766 (1982) (“State has an urgent interest in the welfare of the \nchild . . . the State’s goal is to provide the child with a permanent home.”); Moore, 442 U.S. at 435 \n(“Family relations are a traditional area of state concern.”); Harper v. Pub. Serv. Comm’n of WV, \n396 F.3d 348, 354 (4th Cir. 2005) (“Interests like … family law… lie at the heart of state \nsovereignty, and a failure to abstain in the face of ongoing state proceedings would disrespect the \nallocation of authority laid in place by the Framers.”).   \nThird,  state  circuit  court  proceedings  “afford  an  adequate  opportunity  to  raise  the \nconstitutional claims” and the federal statutory claims.  Middlesex, 457 U.S. at 432; see Moore, \n442 U.S. at 416, 430; J.B. ex rel. Hart, 186 F.3d at 1291.  “Where vital state interests are involved, \na federal court should abstain unless state law clearly bars the interposition of the [federal or] \n12 \n \n\n \nconstitutional claims.”  Middlesex, 457 U.S. at 424.  That is not the case in West Virginia, as the \ncircuit courts are courts of general jurisdiction competent to hear questions of federal and \nconstitutional law.  See W.Va. Const. Art. 8. § 6; Allstate Insurance Co. v. West Virginia State \nBar, 233 F.3d 813, 815 n.1 (4th Cir. 2000) (“A West Virginia circuit court is a court of general \njurisdiction.”).  Furthermore, at every stage of a child welfare proceeding, the child is represented \nby a court-appointed attorney (referred to as a “Guardian ad Litem” or “GAL”) who “thoroughly \nunderstand[s] and investigate[s] the case.”4  This includes “formulat[ing] meaningful arguments \nand written recommendations to the court” and “actively participat[ing] in all aspects of litigation.”  \nId.; W. Va. Code §§ 49-4-601, 49-4-602.  Guardians ad Litem can, and often do, challenge circuit \ncourt orders in abuse and neglect proceedings, and appropriately do so in state court.  Matter of \nScottie D., 406 S.E.2d 214, 221 (W. Va. 1991) (Guardian ad Litem’s “duty includes exercising the \nappellate rights of the children, if, in the reasonable judgment of the guardian ad litem, an appeal \nis necessary”); see, e.g., In re K.L., 826 S.E.2d 671 (W. Va. 2019); In re S.W., 779 S.E.2d 577 (W. \nVa. 2015); In re Elizabeth F., 696 S.E.2d 296 (W. Va. 2010); In Interest of Renae Ebony W., 452 \nS.E.2d 737 (W. Va. 1994).  Here, however, there is no allegation in the Complaint that Plaintiffs’ \nGuardians ad Litem ever raised any of their claims before the circuit courts.  See, e.g., Moore v. \nCity of Asheville, N.C., 396 F.3d 386, 394 (4th Cir. 2005) (“[A] necessary concomitant of Younger \nis that a party . . . must exhaust his state appellate remedies before seeking relief in the District \nCourt.” (internal citations omitted)); Norfolk S. Ry. Co. v. McGraw, 71 Fed. App’x 967, 972 (4th \nCir. 2003) (quoting Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., 481 U.S. 1, 15 (1987)) (“[W]hen a litigant has \n                                                 \n4 W. Va. Judiciary, Rules of Procedure for Child Abuse & Neglect Proceedings, Appendix A: \nGuidelines  for  Children’s  Guardians  ad  Litem  in  Child  Abuse  and  Neglect  Cases, \nhttp://www.courtswv.gov/legal-community/court-rules/child-abuse/appendixA.html  (last  visited \nNov. 21, 2019). \n13 \n \n\n \nnot attempted to present his federal claims in related state-court proceedings, a federal court should \nassume that state procedures will afford an adequate remedy, in the absence of unambiguous \nauthority to the contrary.”).   \nA  “federal  court  may  disregard Younger’s mandate to abstain from interfering with \nongoing state proceedings only where ‘extraordinary circumstances’ exist.”  Robinson v. Thomas, \n855 F.3d 278, 286 (4th Cir. 2017) (quoting Kugler v. Helfant, 421 U.S. 117, 124 (1975)).  This \nexception does not apply here, as Plaintiffs allege neither “bad faith or harassment by state \nofficials”  nor  that  state  law  is  “flagrantly  and  patently  violative  of  express  constitutional \nprohibitions.”  Id. (quoting Kugler, 421 U.S. at 124).  Plaintiffs had (and have) “adequate \nopportunit[ies]” in the circuit court proceedings to raise their claims.     \nII.  EVEN IF THE COURT DOES EXERCISE JURISDICTION, THE COMPLAINT \nSHOULD BE DISMISSED FOR FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM FOR WHICH \nRELIEF CAN BE GRANTED. \nEven if the Complaint is not dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, none of the counts state a \nclaim for which relief can be granted, and therefore the Complaint should be dismissed under Rule \n12(b)(6). \nA.  The Substantive Due Process Claims (Count I) Fail as a Matter of Law. \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint takes “aspirational statutory, regulatory, and private standards as to \na variety of topics within the overall complex of foster child care” and attempts to “convert each \nof them to constitutional requirements.”  Connor B. ex rel. Vigurs v. Patrick, 774 F.3d 45, 55 (1st \nCir. 2014).  But that is not the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process protections.  See \nid. (“The district court correctly rejected that attempt, as do we.”). \nAs the Fourth Circuit has explained, “as a general rule, ‘the Due Process Clause works only \nas a negative prohibition on state action.’”  Doe v. South Carolina Dep’t of Health & Human \n14 \n \n\n \nServices, 597 F.3d 163, 170 (4th Cir. 2010) (quoting Pinder v. Johnson, 54 F.3d 1169, 1174 (4th \nCir.1995) (en banc)).  Accordingly, substantive due process “serves ‘as a limitation on the State’s \npower to act, not as a guarantee of certain minimal levels of safety and security,’ and ‘does not \nrequire governmental actors to affirmatively protect life, liberty, or property against intrusion by \nprivate third parties.’”  Id. at 171 (quoting Patten v. Nichols, 274 F.3d 829, 836 (4th Cir. 2001); \nPinder, 54 F.3d at 1174). \nHowever, in certain circumstances, “when a state involuntarily removes a child from her \nhome, thereby taking the child into its custody and care,” id. at 175, substantive due process may \nimpose some obligation on the State to “‘provide for [the child’s] basic human needs.’”  Id. at 171 \n(quoting DeShaney v. Winnebago Cty. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 200 (1989)).  But see \nMilburn v. Anne Arundel Cty. Dep’t of Soc. Services, 871 F.3d 474 (4th Cir. 1989) (holding that \nsubstantive due process did not impose legal duty on State with respect to child whose biological \nfamily placed the child in foster care); White ex rel. White v. Chambliss, 112 F.3d 731 (4th Cir. \n1997) (Milburn not limited to “situations where parents had voluntarily placed their children in \nfoster care” because “the state ha[s] no affirmative constitutional obligation to protect individuals \nagainst private violence”).  \nTo survive a motion to dismiss on a substantive due process claim, including a claim that \nthe State violated substantive due process in its treatment of children in foster care, a plaintiff must \nallege facts that show: (1) deprivation of a cognizable constitutional right; (2) the defendants’ \npolicies  and  practices  about  which  the  plaintiffs  complain  “shocked  the  conscience”  and \nconstituted  “deliberate  indifference”;  and  (3)  the  defendants’  conscious-shocking  deliberate \nindifference caused the constitutional deprivation.  See, e.g., Cty. of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. \n833, 846-50 (1998); Rios v. City of Del Rio, Tex., 444 F.3d 417, 422-24, 426-27 (5th Cir. 2006) \n15 \n \n\n \n(citing Collins v. City of Harker Heights, 503 U.S. 115 (1992)); Serna v. Colorado Dep’t of Corr., \n455 F.3d 1146, 1151 (10th Cir. 2006); Mark v. Borough of Hatboro, 51 F.3d 1137, 1149 (3d Cir. \n1995). \nThis is a very high bar, and Plaintiffs in this case have failed to allege facts that satisfy any \nof the three prongs of this test.  \nWith respect to the first prong, in the context of foster care, a child has the right to “basic \nhuman needs”; that is, once a State takes a child into custody, the State becomes responsible for \nproviding “basic human needs—e.g., food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and reasonable safety.”  \nDeShaney, 489 U.S. at 200.  West Virginia state law and policy appropriately demand that \nDefendants  provide  foster  children  with  much  more  than  their  “basic  human  needs,”  and \nDefendants are deeply devoted to doing so.  However, the constitutional protections of substantive \ndue process apply only to the narrow band of “basic human needs.”   \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint does not allege that they have been deprived of “basic human needs.”  \nInstead, they assert a litany of rights, purportedly secured by the U.S. Constitution, to a certain \ntype or length of custodial arrangement or placement,5 to certain types of social services,6 and to \n                                                 \n5 See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 373(d); 373(f); 373(g); 374(b)(ii) (“the right to conditions and duration of \nfoster care reasonably related to the purpose of government custody”; “the right not to be \nmaintained in custody longer than is necessary to accomplish the purpose to be served by taking a \nchild into government custody”; “the right to services in the least restrictive, most family-like \nsetting;” “the right to services in the most integrated setting appropriate to the person’s needs”). \n6  See,  e.g.,  Compl.  ¶¶  373(c);  373(e);  373(g);  374(a)(ii);  374(a)(iii);  374(b)(iv);  374(c)(i); \n374(c)(ii) (“the right to services necessary to prevent unreasonable risk of harm”; “the right to \ntreatment and cares consistent with the purpose and assumptions of government custody;” “the \nright to services in the least restrictive, most family-like setting;” “the right to supportive and case \nmanagement services to ensure placement stability and ensure the child is free from harm;” “the \nright to a plan and corresponding services for a permanent home;” “the right to ensure access to \nan array of community-based placements and services;” “the right to independent living services \nto prepare to exit foster care;” “the right to assistance to find lawful, suitable permanent housing.”) \n \n16 \n \n\n \ncertain types of non-familial relationships. 7  While many of the asserted “rights” are sound policy \n– indeed, many reflect the laws and policies of West Virginia – they are not constitutionally \nmandated rights of children in state custody. \nThe Supreme Court has rejected the notion that substantive due process extends to the type \nof placement decisions that form the crux of the Plaintiffs’ complaint.  In Reno v. Flores, detained \nmigrant children asserted a substantive due process right to be placed with a non-relative custodian \nrather than a child-care institution.  507 U.S. 292, 302 (1993).  In rejecting that claim, the Court \nexpressly addressed the consequences that a contrary holding would have for state child welfare \nsystems: \nIf  there  exists  a  fundamental  right  to  be  released  into  what \nrespondents inaccurately call a “noncustodial setting,” . . . we see no \nreason  why  it  would  apply  only  in  the  context  of  government \ncustody incidentally acquired in the course of law enforcement.  It \nwould  presumably  apply  to  state  custody  over  orphans  and \nabandoned children as well, giving federal law and federal courts a \nmajor new role in the management of state orphanages and other \nchild care institutions. . . . The mere novelty of such a claim is reason \nenough to doubt that “substantive due process” sustains it[.]  \n \nId.   \nNot surprisingly, a number of courts have similarly rejected substantive due process claims \nthat the type and duration of foster care placement is subject to review under substantive due \nprocess principles.  See, e.g., K.H. Through Murphy v. Morgan, 914 F.2d 846, 853 (7th Cir. 1990) \n(rejecting substantive due process claim to a “stable foster-home environment”); Clark K. v. \nGuinn, 2007 WL 1435428, at *11 (D. Nev. 2007) (no right “to placement in the least restrictive, \nmost family-like setting”) (unpublished); Charlie H. v. Whitman, 83 F. Supp. 2d 476, 507 (D.N.J. \n                                                 \n7 See, e.g., Compl. ¶ 373(c)(iii) (“the right to connection with an adult resource who will maintain \na stable, long-term relationship with the child”). \n17 \n \n\n \n2000) (no “substantive due process right to ‘not remain in state custody unnecessarily,’ or ‘be \nhoused in the least restrictive, most appropriate and family-like placement while in state custody” \n(citations omitted)); Eric L. By and Through Schierberl v. Bird, 848 F. Supp. 303, 307 (D.N.H. \n1994) (rejecting substantive due process claim to placement stability); B.H. v. Johnson, 715 F. \nSupp. 1387, 1397-987 (N.D. Ill. 1989) (substantive due process does not extend to “stable \nplacements in the least restrictive setting”). \nAs for the Plaintiffs’ claims that the Constitution entitles them to certain services, the \nSupreme Court has concluded that “substantive due process” requires the State to provide only the \n“minimally adequate care and treatment” required to assure personal safety.  Youngberg v. Romeo, \n457  U.S.  307,  319  (1982).    “Even  then  a  State  necessarily  has  considerable  discretion  in \ndetermining the nature and scope of its responsibilities,” and the Court has cautioned that a State \nneed not “choose between attacking every aspect of a problem or not attacking the problem at all.”  \nId. at 317.  Applying this standard to state child welfare class actions, courts have rejected the \nargument that a State can be constitutionally liable for the “alleged failure to provide [an] array of \nsocial services.”  Mark G. v. Sabol, 717 N.E.2d 1067 (N.Y. 1999); see also Baby Neal v. Casey, \n821 F. Supp. 320, 335-39 (E.D. Pa. 1993) (no right to broad array of foster care services), rev'd on \nother grounds, 43 F.3d 48 (3d Cir. 1994); B.H., 715 F. Supp. at 1397 (rejecting due process claim \nof entitlement to “family reunification” services, “parental and sibling visitation,” and “adequate \ncaseworkers”). \nOnly two of the 17 due process “rights” that the Plaintiffs assert even arguably relate to the \n“basic human need” of physical safety.8  But for these, the allegations in the Complaint fail to \n                                                 \n8  See  Compl.  ¶¶  373(a);  373(c)  (“the  right  to  freedom  from  maltreatment  and  repeated \nmaltreatment”; the right to services “necessary to prevent unreasonable risk of harm”). \n18 \n \n\n \nsatisfy the second and third prongs of the substantive due process test because the Plaintiffs have \nnot alleged facts sufficient to show the Defendants’ policies and practices constitute “deliberate \nindifference” that is “conscience shocking” and caused a constitutional deprivation.  See Lewis, \n523 U.S. at 850.  As applied in the foster care context, the Fourth Circuit has articulated the State’s \nduty as being one “not to make a foster care placement that is deliberately indifferent to the child’s \nright to personal safety and security.”  Doe, 597 F.3d at 175.  That duty, according to the Court of \nAppeals, does not extend to protection against “unknown harm or dangers,” “incidental injuries,” \n“infrequent acts of abuse,” or acts of “negligence . . . even carelessness.”  Id.   \nAs a matter of state policy, every injury or act of maltreatment for a child in state custody \n– including those that are unknown, infrequent, incidental, or negligent – is intolerable.  But as a \nmatter of constitutional law, Plaintiffs have failed to identify a single policy or practice that \nresulted in Defendants making foster care placements that were deliberately indifferent to every \nchild’s right to personal safety and security.  See M.D. by Stukenberg v. Abbott, 907 F.3d 237, 251 \n(5th Cir. 2018) (“Incidental psychological injury that is the natural, if unfortunate consequence of \nbeing a ward of the state does not give rise to the level of a substantive due process violation.”).   \nGeneric and rote allegations in the Complaint that Defendants “may well have prevented \nadditional trauma” if they “had made reasonable professional judgments, engaged in reasonable \ncase planning and placement matching, not acted in disregard of professional standards . . . and \nnot acted with deliberate indifference to [the named plaintiffs’] legal rights” are not sufficient to \nsurvive a motion to dismiss.  “A plaintiff's obligation to provide the ‘grounds’ of his ‘entitle[ment] \nto relief’ requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of \na cause of action will not do.”  Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombley, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007); see \nalso Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S 265, 286 (1986) (on a motion to dismiss, courts “are not bound to \n19 \n \n\n \naccept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation”).  Plaintiffs do not identify a \nsingle action by a single defendant that could possibly establish “deliberate indifference” to the \nbasic needs of children in foster care that “shocks the conscience.” \nThe Complaint’s extended discussion of West Virginia law and policy (Compl. ¶¶ 202-17), \nand the suggestions that Defendants are not following it, only confirms the point.  Violation of \nstate laws is not a constitutional violation.  “A State may, through its courts and legislatures, \nimpose such affirmative duties of care . . . as it wishes.”  DeShaney, 489 US. at 202.  But not all \n“duties owed by government actors . . . [are] constitutionalized by the Fourteenth Amendment,” \nid., and “it is well settled that violations of state law cannot provide the basis for a due process \nclaim.”  See Pennhurst State School & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 134 (1984); Weller v. \nDep’t of  Soc. Servs. for Baltimore, 901 F.2d 387, 392 (4th Cir. 1990); Jensen v. Conrad, 747 F.2d \n185, 195 n.12 (4th Cir. 1984).   \nFor these reasons, the substantive due process claims should be dismissed. \nB.  The Constitutional “Familial Association” Claims (Count II) Fail as a Matter \nof Law.   \nPlaintiffs also assert a vague right to “familial association” secured by the First and Ninth \nAmendments and applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause.  \nThese claims, too, should be rejected. \nNo  court  has  recognized  the  Ninth  Amendment  “as  independently  securing  any \nconstitutional right, for the purposes of pursuing a civil rights claim.”  Strandberg v. City of \nHelena, 791 F.2d 744, 748-49 (9th Cir. 1986); see also, Goodpaster v. City of Indianapolis, 736 \nF.3d 1060, 1075 (7th Cir. 2013); Johnson v. Texas Bd. of Criminal Justice, 281 Fed. App’x 319, \n320 (5th Cir. 2008) (unpublished); Morgan v. Logan Cty. Comm’n, 2019 WL 1748534, at *4 n.3 \n20 \n \n\n \n(S.D. W. Va. 2019) (unpublished); Hardway for Hardway v. Lemmon, 2006 WL 8438638, at *3 \n(S.D. W. Va. 2006) (unpublished).  \nWhile the First Amendment may protect some aspects of the parent-child relationship, it \nhas not been found to extend to more extended kinship relationships, and it does not “impose a \nconstitutional obligation on the state to ensure a particular type of family life or to create such an \nobligation ‘through the penumbral constitutional … right to family privacy.’”  Marisol A. by \nForbes v. Giuliani, 929 F. Supp. 662, 676 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (quoting B.H. v. Johnson, 715 F. Supp. \nat 1397); Charlie H., 83 F. Supp. 2d at 513-14 (“The so-called right to family integrity will not be \nextended to situations where a plaintiff … alleges limited familial contact, as compared to no \ncontact.”).  Nor is there a First Amendment right to a permanent home and family, see M.D. v. \nPerry, 294 F.R.D. 7, 97 (S.D. Tex. 2013) (“plaintiffs cite no legal authority in support” of claimed \n“right to family integrity, derived primarily from the First Amendment”); B.H. v. Johnson, 715 F. \nSupp. at 1396-98 (dismissing substantive due process claims alleging that the state failed to \nprovide training necessary to reunite children with their families or to ensure sufficient parental \nand sibling visitation).  \nC.  The Child Welfare Act Claims (Count III) Fail as a Matter of Law.   \nPlaintiffs’ third cause of action alleges violations of the Adoption Assistance and Child \nWelfare Act, as amended.  Specifically, Plaintiffs assert violations of 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(10) and \n(a)(16), together with several defined terms set forth at 42 U.S.C. § 675.  All of these sections \nappear in Title IV-E of the Social Security Act.9 \n                                                 \n9 Most Spending Clause legislation involving federal assistance programs, including the ones at \nissue in the Complaint, are made as amendments to different titles of the Social Security Act.  By \nconvention, the federal and state agencies administering these programs refer to the provisions by \ntheir placement in the Social Security Act, not by the codified section in the U.S. Code, and the \n \n21 \n \n\n \nSection 671(a) provides that in order for a State to be eligible for federal payments under \nTitle IV-E, it must have a plan approved by the Secretary that includes certain features.  Suter v. \nArtist M., 503 U.S. 347, 351 (1992).  Plaintiffs claim a cause of action under two of the \nrequirements in Section 671(a).  First, Section 671(a)(10) requires that a State be responsible for \n“establishing and maintaining standards for foster family homes and child care institutions which \nare reasonably in accord with recommended standards of national organizations” and “that the \nstandards established . . . . shall be applied by the State to any foster family home or child care \ninstitution.”  Second, Section 671(a)(16) provides that the State plan must \nProvide[ ] for the development of a case plan (as defined in section \n675(a) of this title and in accordance with the requirements of \nsection  675a  of  this  title)  for  each  child  receiving  foster  care \nmaintenance payments under the State plan and provide[] for a case \nreview system meets the requirements described in sections 675(5) \nand 675a of this title with respect to each such child[.] \n \nThe rest of the statutory provisions cited in the Complaint are definitional.  Section 675(1) sets \nforth a definition of “case plan,” to include various components, including that the plan include a \ndiscussion of placement, need for services, and consideration of educational stability.  Complaint \n¶ 382 (citing Section 675(1)(A), (B), (G)).  Section 675(5) includes a definition of a “case review \nsystem,” which requires a review of the child’s placement at least every six months, including a \nplan for permanency at the end of 12 months.  Id. (citing Section 675(5)(A)-(C)). \n                                                 \nnumbering of the two sources is different.  For the provisions relevant in this case, which are \ncodified in Title IV of the Social Security Act, the Social Security Act cite is numerically 200 less \nthan the U.S. Code cite, so that Section 471 of the Social Security Act is codified at 42 U.S.C. § \n671, Section 472 is codified at 42 U.S.C. § 672, and so forth.   \nPlaintiffs refer to their claims as arising under the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare.  \nFederal and state officials, however, would refer to these provisions as being part of the “Title IV-\nE” program, because they are found in Title IV-E of the Social Security Act.  Most of the decisions \naddressing similar challenges to those at issue have referred to the U.S. Code numbering, which is \nthe format followed here. \n22 \n \n\n \n  None of these provisions create a private cause of action enforceable under Section 1983. \n1.  The Cited Provisions Do Not Meet the Blessing/Gonzaga Standard.   \nSection 1983 “does not provide an avenue for relief every time a state actor violates a \nfederal law.”  City of Rancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 544 U.S. 113, 119 (2005).  Rather, a plaintiff \nseeking redress “must assert the violation of a federal right, not merely a violation of federal law.”  \nBlessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 340 (1997).  “If Congress is silent or ambiguous, courts may \nnot find a cause of action ‘no matter how desirable that may be as a policy matter.’”  Planned \nParenthood South Atlantic v. Baker, 2019 WL 5555641, at *5 (4th Cir. 2019) (citations omitted) \n(not yet published).   \nThree requirements must be met for a statute to create a private right enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at *6.  “First, Congress must have intended that the provision in question benefit \nthe plaintiff.”  Blessing, 520 U.S. at 340.  “Second, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the right \nassertedly protected by the statute is not so ‘vague and amorphous’ that its enforcement would \nstrain judicial competence.”  Id. at 340-41.  “Third, the statute must unambiguously impose a \nbinding obligation on the States” by speaking “in mandatory, rather than precatory, terms.”  Id. at \n341.   \nThe Supreme Court further clarified the first prong of the Blessing test in Gonzaga v. Doe, \n536 U.S. 273, 282-83 (2002).  Gonzaga held that the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act \n(“FERPA”) created no private right of action for students whose data was disclosed in violation of \nthe act.  “[U]nless Congress ‘speaks with a clear voice,’ and manifests an ‘unambiguous’ intent to \nconfer individual rights, federal funding provisions provide no basis for private enforcement by \n§ 1983.”  Id. at 280 (quoting Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17, 28 n.21 \n(1981)).  The Court held that FERPA’s focus on the policies and procedures of educational \n23 \n \n\n \ninstitutions, rather than the individuals impacted by such policies, made it “two steps removed \nfrom the interests” of those individuals and “clearly [did] not confer the sort of ‘individual \nentitlement’ that is enforceable under § 1983.”  Id. at 287 (quoting Blessing, 520 U.S. at 343).  In \nsum, where statutes have an “aggregate focus,” rather than an individualized focus on “whether \nthe needs of any particular person have been satisfied,” such laws do not confer individual rights \nenforceable under § 1983.  Id. at 288–90.  \nNone of the statutory provisions cited by Plaintiffs meet the Blessing/Gonzaga standard.  \nAll are focused on actions that the State must take to secure federal funds, not on the rights of the \nindividuals qualifying for Title IV-E payments.  Indeed, even before its decision in Blessing, the \nSupreme Court held that provisions in Title IV-E, substantially similar to those at issue here, were \nnot privately enforceable.  Specifically, in Suter the Court held that Section 671(a)(15), which \nrequires that “reasonable efforts shall be made” to achieve permanency for a child, was not \n \nprivately enforceable.  503 U.S. at 358.  With “[n]o further statutory guidance . . . as to how \n‘reasonable efforts’ are to be measured,” the Court concluded that the phrase would “obviously \nvary with the circumstances of each individual case,” providing insufficient guidance for federal \ncourt enforcement.  Id. at 360.  The Court similarly held that Section 671(a)(9) – which requires \nan agency to refer suspected cases of abuse or neglect to law enforcement – was not privately \nenforceable.  Id. at 359 n.10.10 \n                                                 \n10 The Suter decision also suggested that Section 671(a) as a whole “only goes so far as to ensure \nthat the State have a plan approved by the Secretary which contains the 16 listed features.”  503 \nU.S. at 358.  That portion of the opinion had implications for many public assistance programs \nbeyond Title IV-E, including Medicaid, all of which are framed in terms of provisions to be \nincluded in a federally-approved “state plan.”  Congress legislatively overruled that aspect of the \nopinion, but affirmed the holding of Suter that “section [42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(15)] is not enforceable \nin a private right of action.”  42 U.S.C. § 1320a-2. \n24 \n \n\n \nThe logic in Suter, Blessing, and Gonzaga forecloses Plaintiffs’ statutory causes of action.  \nWith respect to Plaintiffs’ claim for relief under Section 671(a)(10), the law in this Circuit is clear: \n“Section 671(a)(10) does not create an enforceable right.”  White by White, 112 F.3d at 739.  The \nCourt of Appeals reached this determination after reviewing the Supreme Court’s decision in \nSuter, and concluded that “[t]he requirement that a state’s plan be ‘reasonably in accord with \nrecommended standards of national organizations,’ is no more specific than section 671(a)(15)’s \n“reasonable efforts” requirement.”  Id.  That holding has been echoed in cases throughout the \ncountry.11  \nThe same analysis requires dismissal of Plaintiffs’ claims under the “case plan” and the \n“case review” provision of Section 671(a)(16) (and the corresponding definitions at Section 675(1) \nand (5)).  Prior to the Supreme Court’s Blessing decision in 1997, some courts (including the \nFourth Circuit, see infra Section II.C.2.) found this section to be privately enforceable.  After \nBlessing, however, the great majority of courts that have addressed the issue have concluded that \nSection 671(a)(16) does not contain sufficient “rights-creating” language to satisfy the first prong \nof the Blessing test.12  \n                                                 \n11 See Barricelli v.

City of New York, 115 F.Supp.2d 423, 428 (S.D.N.Y. \n2000); Charlie H., 83 F. Supp.2d at 489-90.  The minority of courts that have concluded the \nopposite include Henry A. v. Willden, 678 F.3d 991, 1006-07 (9th Cir. 2012); Sam M. v. Chafee, \n \n25 \n \n\n \nThe text of Section 671(a)(16) itself does not “unambiguously confer” any individual \nenforcement right for Plaintiffs.  See John B. v. Goetz, 626 F.3d 356, 363 (6th Cir. 2010) (“We \neasily conclude that the statute, which requires the state to develop a ‘case plan’ and a ‘case review \nsystem’ for each child, does not create enforceable rights.”).  Plaintiffs do not allege that a case \nplan has not been developed for any of the Named Plaintiffs or that there is not a system of case \nreview.  Rather, Plaintiffs’ claims are that the case plans and case review system do not produce \nthe desired results described in the definitions set forth in Section 675.  Among other things, those \ndefinitions provide that the case plan is intended to “discuss” “the safety and appropriateness of \nthe placement;” “assure” that the child “receives safe and proper care” and “appropriate[ ] . . . \nservices;” and “takes into account” “educational stability.”  See 42 U.S.C. § 675(1)(A), (B), (G).  \nLikewise, the “case review system” is defined to mean “a procedure for assuring . . . placement in \na safe setting that is the least restrictive . . . and most appropriate setting available . . . consistent \nwith  the  best  interest  and  special  needs  of  the  child,”  and  periodic  review  by  a  court  or \nadministrative agency.  See 42 U.S.C. § 675(5)(A), (B), (C).    \nWhile the case plan and case review system serve an important function, nothing in the \nstatutory language creates an individually-enforceable right to implementation of the particulars \nof the plan, much less successful achievement of all the desired outcomes.  As in Gonzaga, \n“references to individual children and their placements are made in the context of describing what \nthe procedure is supposed to ensure,” not how it will be ultimately implemented.  31 Foster \n                                                 \n800 F.

At least one Court has found that some \nof the definitions in Section 675 are rights-creating, while others are not.  See Barricelli v. City of \nNew York, 2016 WL 4750178 (S.D.N.Y. 2016). \n26 \n \n\n \nChildren, 329 F.3d at 1272 (citing Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 289).  See Brinkley v. Hill, 981 F. Supp. \n423 (S.D. W. Va. 1997) (distinguishing between statutes “which prescribe a specific course of \nconduct to be followed by the State” and those enforceable under Section 1983 “which specifically \nenumerate that an individual plaintiff is to receive a personally precise benefit.”).  \nPlaintiffs’ claim to a private enforcement right under Section 671(a)(16) also fails under \nBlessing’s second prong: the asserted right is “vague and amorphous,” such that its enforcement \nwould “strain judicial competence.” 520 U.S. at 340–41. Far from providing an “objective \nbenchmark” for federal judicial enforcement, Section 671(a)(16)’s guidance for States is “couched \nin broad, goal-oriented terms,” referencing amorphous concepts such as “proper care,” “facilitating \nreturn of the child to his home or the permanent placement of the child,” and “discussing the \nappropriateness of the services that have been provided to the child.”  Del A. v. Roemer, 777 F. \nSupp. 1297, 1309 (E.D. La. 1991).  Such generalized terms, like the “reasonable efforts” language \naddressed in Suter, provide a federal court with little, if any, meaningful guidance to determine \nwhether a State’s actions comply.  503 U.S. at 363.  The simple truth is that “there is no way to \nmeasure the normal or average needs of a child in foster care.”  Roemer, 777 F. Supp. at 1309.  \nThe statutes cited do not meet the standards for creating a private cause of action. \n2.  The Court Is Not Bound by the Fourth Circuit’s 1988 L.J. II Decision.  \nIn 1988, prior to Suter, Blessing, and Gonzaga, the Fourth Circuit summarily concluded, \nin upholding a preliminary injunction against the City of Baltimore’s foster care program, that the \ncase plan and case file review provisions of Section 671(a)(16), “taken together” with the \n“recommended standards” provision of Section 671(a)(10) and the referral requirements of Section \n671(a)(9) “spell out a standard of conduct, and as a corollary rights in plaintiffs” that were privately \nenforceable under Section 1983, despite the fact that “the statutes are largely statutes relating to \n27 \n \n\n \nappropriations.”  L.J. by and through Darr v. Massinga, 838 F.2d 118, 123 (4th Cir. 1988) (later \ncases refer to this decision as “L.J. II”). \nThat analysis – the sum total of which is spelled out above – does not survive Suter, \nBlessing and Gonzaga.  At the time L.J. II was decided, the Supreme Court had not yet made it \nclear  that  a  cause  of  action  only  arises  out  of  a  federal  statute  when  the  “statute  itself \nunambiguously ‘confers an individual right’ on the plaintiff”; rather, the law at the time was that \nit sufficed for plaintiffs to “[fall] ‘within the general zone of interest’ of a federal statute” in order \nto state a federal claim.  Planned Parenthood, 2019 WL 5555641, at *5.  \nIn fact, a few years after L.J. II was decided, the Supreme Court in Suter concluded that \none of the three provisions on which L.J. II relied – Section 671(a)(9) – did not create a cause of \naction.  Suter, 503 U.S. at 359 n.10.  Shortly thereafter, the Fourth Circuit reached a similar \nconclusion with respect to the second provision, Section 671(a)(10).  See White by White, 112 F.3d \nat 739.  Therefore, the actual holding of L.J. II that the three provisions “taken together” create a \ncause of action has been abrogated by these later cases.   \nThe Court of Appeals had occasion to revisit L.J. II in 2011, when the Baltimore defendants \nsought to vacate the consent decree that had been negotiated after the court’s initial L.J. II decision.  \nL.J. v. Wilbon, 633 F.3d 297 (4th Cir. 2011) (“L.J. III”).  In upholding the district court’s denial of \nthat motion, the Fourth Circuit held that its prior decision regarding the enforceability of Section \n671(a)(16) was the “law of the case,” and must apply unless that decision had been “directly \noverruled” or was “clearly erroneous and would work manifest injustice.”  Id. at 308.  The holding \nin L.J. II with respect to Section 671(a)(16) had not been directly overruled by Suter, and the court \nconcluded that it did not qualify for the “clearly erroneous” exception to the “law of the case” \ndoctrine.  The court explained that under the “clearly erroneous” standard, a prior decision could \n28 \n \n\n \nnot be “just maybe or probably wrong; it must ... strike us as wrong with the force of a five-week-\nold, unrefrigerated dead fish.’”  Id. (quoting TWFS, Inc. v. Franchot, 572 F.3d 186, 194 (4th Cir. \n2009)).  Applying that odiferous standard, the court concluded that the Baltimore defendants had \nnot carried their burden of establishing that the decision in L.J. II was so “dead wrong” as to require \nvacatur of the consent decree.  In so holding, the court emphasized that “we do not now hold that \n§ 671(a)(16) provides a private right of action.”  Id. \nFortunately, this Court is not faced with law-of-the-case issues and thus need not accept \nthe holding of L.J. II under the “five-week-old, unrefrigerated dead fish” standard.  Rather, the \nquestion for this court is simply whether L.J.II is still good law, in light of: the intervening case \nlaw in Suter, Blessing, and Gonzaga; the fact that two of the provisions which the court considered \n“together with” Section 671(a)(16) have been determined not to be privately enforceable; and the \nFourth Circuit’s most recent pronouncement that it “[does] not hold that Section 671(a)(16) \nprovides a private right of action.”   For the reasons explained above, the reasoning in L.J. II has \nclearly been abrogated by later case law and is not binding on this Court. 13   \n3.  Many  Children  in  the  Putative  Class  Are  Not  the  Intended \nBeneficiaries of the Cited Provisions.   \nEven if the Court finds that Section 671(a)(16) is privately enforceable (or believes that it \nis bound by L.J. II), that provision can only be enforced by a child receiving federally supported \nbenefits under Title IV-E. \n                                                 \n13 Though ordinarily “a district court is bound by the precedent set by its Circuit Court of Appeals,” \nan exception to this rule is if “such precedent is overruled by the appellate court or the United \nStates Supreme Court.”  See Strickland v. U.S., 423 F.3d 1335, 1338 n.3 (Fed. Cir. 2005); U.S. v. \nCobbs, 274 F. Supp. 3d 390, 394 (S.D. W. Va. 2017); Condon v. Haley, 21 F. Supp. 3d 572, 587 \n(D.S.C. 2014). \n29 \n \n\n \nAs explained above, the statutory provisions cited in the Complaint are all part of Title IV-\nE of the Social Security Act.  Title IV-E is a federal matching program in which the federal \ngovernment agrees to fund a portion of state expenditures on “maintenance” payments (essentially, \nroom and board) and certain administrative costs for foster care and adoption assistance, but only \nfor children who meet eligibility criteria set forth in the statute.   \nIn order for a child to be Title IV-E eligible, the statute requires that he or she must have \nbeen removed from their family pursuant to a judicial determination that continuation in the home \nwould be “contrary to [their] welfare” and that there have been “reasonable efforts to prevent \nremoval,” 42 U.S.C. § 672(a)(2)(A); (2) that the family from which the child was removed would \nhave qualified for assistance under the former Aid to Families with Dependent Children program \nas it existed before it was repealed, 42 U.S.C. § 672(a)(1)(B); (3) that the child is placed in a fully \nlicensed foster family home or childcare institution, 42 U.S.C. § 672(b), (c); and (4) that the State \nhas performed required background checks on the caregivers of children placed in foster care, 42 \nU.S.C. § 671(a)(20)(A).   \nThe percentage of children in a State’s child welfare program who meet these requirements \n(and thus are eligible for federal funded assistance) is known as the Title IV-E “coverage rate” or \n“penetration rate.”  West Virginia’s current penetration rate is approximately 60%; that is, 40% of \nchildren in foster care are not eligible for Title IV-E benefits.   \nAlthough West Virginia does not distinguish between Title IV-E eligible children and those \nwho are not for purposes of administering its program, children who are not Title IV-E eligible \nwould not be “receiving foster care maintenance payments under the State plan” within the \nmeaning of Section 671(a)(16).  For these children, there is no possible argument that Congress \nintended the statute to create an enforceable right.   \n30 \n \n\n \nD.  The ADA and Rehabilitation Act Claims (Counts IV and V) Fail as a Matter \nof Law.    \nCounts IV and V should be dismissed because Plaintiffs have failed to state a cause of \naction for which relief can be granted under the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq., and the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 794 et seq.   \nTitle II of the ADA provides that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason \nof such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, \nprograms, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.”  42 \nU.S.C. § 12132.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act has “different language” but imposes \n“similar requirements.”  Halpern v. Wake Forest Univ. Health Sciences, 669 F.3d 454, 461 (4th \nCir. 2011).  To prove a violation of either the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act, “the plaintiff must \nestablish that (1) he has a disability, (2) he is otherwise qualified to participate in the defendant’s \nprogram, and (3) he was excluded from the program on the basis of his disability.”  Id. \nPlaintiffs do not contend that DHHR has excluded members of the purported “ADA \nSubclass” from the foster care program on the basis of their disability; indeed, Plaintiffs repeatedly \nallege that there are numerous children in DHHR custody who have a variety of physical, \nintellectual, and psychiatric disabilities.  Compl. ¶ 31(c).  Rather, the Plaintiffs assert that \nDefendants have violated the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act by not placing them in the “most \nintegrated setting available,” and ask the Court to order DHHR to “develop” an “adequate array” \nof “additional” community placements and services.  Compl. ¶¶ 393, 405(c).   \n1.  Plaintiffs’ Allegations Do Not Constitute a Claim of Discrimination \nRemediable Under the ADA.   \nPlaintiffs’ claim fails as a matter of law for the simple reason that they have not alleged \nfacts that show actual discrimination on the basis of disability.  Plaintiffs allege a dearth of \n31 \n \n\n \ncommunity-based services and placements for foster children with disabilities in West Virginia, \nand the State does not dispute that its community-based behavioral health infrastructure is in need \nof significant improvement.  That is why it created the Safe at Home West Virginia demonstration, \nenacted  legislation  creating  a  managed  care  program  specifically  targeted  at  increasing \ncommunity-based services for foster children, and agreed to an MOU with the DOJ that requires \nthe State to improve the availability of these services.  But shortcomings in the State’s community-\nbased mental health care system – which are not unique to foster care but are a problem statewide \n– do not constitute discrimination under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.  To the contrary, the \nSupreme Court has expressly held that these statutes do not “require[] States to ‘provide a certain \nlevel of benefits to individuals with disabilities,’” Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581, \n603 n.14 (1999); see also Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 303 (1985) (holding that the \nRehabilitation Act “does not require the State to alter [its] definition of the benefit being offered \nsimply to meet the reality that the handicapped have greater medical needs”); Rodriguez v. City of \nNew York, 197 F.3d 611, 619 (2d Cir. 1999) (“Olmstead reaffirms that the ADA does not mandate \nthe provision of new benefits.”).  \nEven if Plaintiffs could pursue an ADA or Rehabilitation Act claim based on an alleged \nlack of community behavioral health services, their claim in this case would still fail.  Plaintiffs \nrely on a regulation promulgated by the DOJ, which provides that “[a] public entity shall \nadminister services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs \nof qualified individuals with disabilities,”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d), and the Supreme Court’s \ndecision in Olmstead, which held that “unjustified isolation of persons with disabilities is a form \nof discrimination.”  527 U.S. at 597.  Citing the DOJ regulation and Olmstead, Plaintiffs ask the \n32 \n \n\n \nCourt to order that children in the custody of DHHR must be placed in the “most integrated \nsetting.”  Compl. ¶¶ 393, 405(c).   \n  Plaintiffs’ reliance on Section 35.130(d) and Olmstead is misplaced.  With respect to the \nformer, Section 35.130(d) should not be interpreted – and was not intended – to automatically \ntrump the specific “best interests of the child” standard that is applied by West Virginia Circuit \nCourts in determining an appropriate placement for a child.  See W. Va. Code § 49-4-608(e).  \nSection 35.130(d) does not require the State to place all children with disabilities in the “most \nintegrated setting” regardless of the individual circumstances of the case, and it does not require \nthe State to create settings that do not exist.  Section 35.130(d) allows for consideration of what \nsettings are in fact available to the State, and it allows the State to consider which setting is \n“appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities,” which is what the state circuit \ncourt does in West Virginia.  If one of the Plaintiffs seeks a more “integrated” setting, there is no \nquestion Plaintiff (or Plaintiff’s Guardian ad Litem) may raise that issue in state circuit court, see \nW.  Va.  Code  §  49-4-608(e)(3)  (requiring  the  circuit  court  to  make  findings  as  to  “the \nappropriateness of the child’s current placement, including its distance from the child’s home and \nwhether or not it is the least restrictive one (most family-like one) available”).   \nNor does Olmstead support the Plaintiffs’ claim.  Olmstead had nothing to do with foster \ncare placement, but involved a State’s alleged refusal to provide two Medicaid enrollees with \ncommunity-based services that the State provided to other people.  In holding that “unjustified” \nplacement in an institution could give rise to a discrimination claim under the ADA, the Supreme \nCourt made clear that its decision did not “require[] States to ‘provide a certain level of benefits to \nindividuals with disabilities,’” Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 603 n.14, which is exactly what Plaintiffs in \nthis case seek.  Further, in this case, there is no “unjustified” institutional placement: each and \n33 \n \n\n \nevery placement has been approved by a state circuit court as in the best interest of the child.  W. \nVa. Code § 49-4-110; § 49-4-601.  This is in stark contrast to Olmstead, where the treatment team \nbelieved community-based placement was most appropriate for both plaintiffs. \n2.  Even If the ADA Requires the State to Develop Community Services \nand Placements, the State has a Robust Plan to Do So.   \nIn Olmstead, the Supreme Court held there is not an ADA violation if a State has “a \ncomprehensive, effectively working plan for placing qualified persons with mental disabilities in \nless restrictive settings, and a waiting list that move[s] at a reasonable pace not controlled by the \nState’s endeavors to keep its institutions fully populated, the reasonable-modifications standard \nwould be met.”  527 U.S. at 605-06; see Martin v. Taft, 222 F. Supp. 2d 940, 984 (S.D. Ohio 2002) \n(“If the defendant [has a plan to move individuals to a less restrictive setting], it has essentially \nproven that it has already reasonably accommodated the plaintiff’s request for participation in a \ncommunity-based program.” (emphasis in original)).  West Virginia has such a “comprehensive, \neffectively working plan.”   \nThe State’s Child and Family Services Plan reflects West Virginia’s “comprehensive, \neffectively working plan” to ensure children with disabilities are placed in the least restrictive \nsettings that are appropriate for them, including two recent developments.  First, in March 2019, \nthe West Virginia Legislature enacted H.B. 2010, which made a number of changes to the state \nfoster care system, including a number of provisions directed to improved access to community \nservices and reduced use of institutional care: \n  Ordering the provision of Medicaid services to foster children through managed \ncare in a manner that: delivers needed supports and services in the most integrated, \nappropriate, and cost-effective way possible; offers a continuum of acute care \nservices, which includes an array of home and community-based options; and \nincludes a comprehensive quality approach across the entire continuum of care \n34 \n \n\n \nservices.  H.B. 2010, W. Va. Leg., 2019 Reg. Sess. (Mar. 8, 2019) (codified as W. \nVa. Code § 9-5-27).14   \n  \n  Providing for the Office of Inspector General to employ an independent Foster Care \nOmbudsman, with experience as a former foster parent or experience in the area of \nchild welfare, whose duties are to advocate for the rights of foster children and \nfoster parents, and participate in any procedure relating to action, inaction of \ndecisions of providers of managed care services.  Id. (codified as W. Va. Code § 9-\n5-27(i)).  DHHR hired its first Foster Care Ombudsman effective Oct. 29, 2019.   \n \n  Requiring residential child care centers discharging a child who does not meet the \nresidential treatment level and target population to request a multi-disciplinary \ntreatment team and work toward alternative placement.  Id. (amending W. Va. Code \n§ 49-2-113(j)). \n \n  Prohibiting a court from ordering a child to be placed in an out-of-state facility \nunless the child is diagnosed with a health issue that no in-state facility or program \nserves.  Id. (amending W. Va. Code § 49-4-608(d)).15 \nSecond, in May 2019, the State entered into a MOU with DOJ as a result of an investigation \nand findings by the DOJ raising issues virtually identical to the issues alleged in the Complaint.16  \nThe MOU targets all children under the age of 21 who have a serious emotional or behavioral \ndisorder or disturbance that results in a functional impairment who are placed (or reasonably may \n                                                 \n14 This transition is scheduled to occur on January 1, 2020.  DHHR issued a Request for Proposal \nto select a single, state-wide qualified contractor on July 1, 2019, and announced the award on \nNovember 5, 2019.  The RFP and resulting contract include numerous requirements regarding the \nprovision of a robust array of community-based services.  A draft of the RFP can be found at:  \nhttps://dhhr.wv.gov/bcf/Documents/Draft%20Managed%20Care%20for%20Vulnerable%20Yout\nh%20and%20Families%20RFP_1-3-19.pdf.  \n15  H.B.  2010  is  available  on  the  West  Virginia’  legislature’s  website  here: \nhttp://www.wvlegislature.gov/bill_Status/bills_text.cfm?billdoc=HB2010%20SECOND%20SU\nB%20ENR.htm&yr=2015&sesstype=RS&billtype=B&houseorig=H&i=2010.   \n16  The  DOJ’s  findings  are  in  a  publicly  available  document  available  at \nhttps://www.ada.gov/olmstead/documents/west_va_findings_ltr.pdf.    The  MOU  is  a  publicly \navailable  document  available  at  https://www.ada.gov/olmstead/documents/wv_agreement.pdf.  \nBoth are referenced throughout the Complaint.  For the convenience of the Court, both of these \npublic documents are reproduced in the Appendix.  \n35 \n \n\n \nbe expected to be placed) in a Residential Mental Health Treatment Facility.  Under the MOU, the \nState has agreed to: \n  Screen children within the target population to determine if they should be referred \nfor further mental health evaluation or services. \n  Ensure that every child for whom community-based services is deemed appropriate \nreceives timely access to these services in a convenient location and in the intensity \nand duration that they need them. \n  Expand and develop community-based services so that children throughout the \nState have access to treatment.  These services include: wraparound facilitation, \nbehavioral support services, family support and training services, in-home therapy, \nchildren’s mobile crisis response, therapeutic foster care, and Assertive Community \nTreatment.  All in-home and community-based mental health services must be \navailable statewide by October 1, 2020.  \n  Eliminate the unnecessary use of residential mental health treatment facilities.  By \nthe end of 2024, a qualified professional must have assessed all children living in a \nfacility and determined that this setting is the most appropriate setting for each \nindividual child. \n \n  Develop a Quality Assurance and Performance Improvement system to allow the \nState to assess the quality of its mental health services and timely address gaps in \nservices across the State. \nThe State has also agreed to develop an implementation plan to explain the steps it will \ntake to create mental health services that are sustainable, statewide, and available to children in the \ntarget  population,  and  to  hire  a  subject  matter  expert  to  provide  technical  assistance  and \nrecommendations for attaining compliance with the agreement.  The subject matter expert will \nprepare a comprehensive report on the status of the State’s compliance with the agreement twice \na year, which will be posted publicly.  If the State fails to comply with the provisions in the \nagreement, DOJ may file a lawsuit for breach.  See MOU, supra note 18. \nThe MOU “addresses the United States’ allegations regarding DHHR’s service system” \nand reflects the belief of both parties that “successful reforms can be implemented in a timely \nmanner.”  MOU, supra note 18.  In that context, DOJ’s determination that the MOU suffices to \n36 \n \n\n \naddress the alleged noncompliance with the ADA and its own regulation is an agency decision to \nwhich this Court should grant significant deference.  See Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 597-98 (“Because \nthe Department [of Justice] is the agency directed by Congress to issue regulations implementing \nTitle II . . . its views warrant respect.”).  Even though Plaintiffs rely on DOJ’s “most integrated \nsetting” regulation, they are effectively asking this Court to overrule DOJ’s decision that the MOU \nsuffices to remedy the noncompliance that they allege.  And Plaintiffs did not even give Defendants \na chance to implement that MOU, filing their Complaint within three months of it being signed, \nalleging simply that it is “unlikely to be successfully implemented by DHHR.”  Complaint ¶ 358.17   \nDefendants acknowledge that the MOU does not eliminate the right of a private party to \nbring his or her own action against the State, see 28 C.F.R. § 35.172(d).  However, this action is \nnot an individual suit alleging a discrete discriminatory act and seeking a tailored remedy.  Rather, \nit is a purported class action demanding broad and sweeping institutional reforms on the grounds \nthat such changes are required by the ADA, even though West Virginia has just entered into an \nagreement with DOJ.  \nGiven that “Congress envisioned that . . . the Federal Government would take a central role \nin enforcing the standards” of the ADA to “address the major areas of discrimination faced day-\nto-day by people with disabilities,” United States v. Florida, 938 F.3d 1221, 1226 (11th Cir. 2019), \nit would be inappropriate to allow this action to interfere with the MOU at this stage.  At the very \nleast, any claim by Plaintiffs that the ADA requires more than what the MOU provides must \n                                                 \n17 Plaintiffs also allege that the MOU is too “limited in scope,” because it is targeted to children in \nresidential mental health facilities, or at risk of placement in such a facility.  But Defendants \nunderstand that to be the substance of Plaintiffs’ claim under the ADA and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act.  If it is not, then Defendants ask that the Court treat this motion as including a \nmotion under Rule 12(e) and order Plaintiffs to file a more definite statement as to their ADA and \nSection 504 claims to which the Defendants can reasonably prepare a response.   \n37 \n \n\n \nspecify the additional modifications that Plaintiffs believe are both reasonable and necessary to \nenforce the DOJ regulations on which they rely.   \nCONCLUSION \nFor all of the reasons set forth above, the Complaint should be dismissed for lack of subject \nmatter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) or for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be \ngranted under Rule 12(b)(6). \n            Respectfully submitted,  \n/s/ Philip J.

INTRODUCTION1 \n \nFoster children face severe and ongoing harm in West Virginia—a harm that Defendants \nappear to ignore or, worse, condone. The State has long known about the grievous constitutional \ndeficiencies that beleaguer its foster care system. Yet, with each passing year, Defendants have \nchosen to leave the deficiencies firmly in place. Foster children still suffer through inadequate and \nunsafe placements. The State still fails to provide medical, behavioral, mental health, and other \nhealth services. And overworked caseworkers are still largely unable to meet their case planning \nresponsibilities, upon which children depend to achieve any modicum of stability. Although the \n \n1 All cited exhibits will be references at “Ex. _” and are attached to the Declaration of Marcia Robinson Lowry \n(hereinafter “Lowry Dec.”), filed with this Memorandum with a citation to the relevant pages. \n  1 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 131   Filed 09/02/20   Page 2 of 61 PageID #: 7733\nWest Virginia foster care population expanded from 2013 through early 2020, Defendants have \ncontinued to ignore the urgent need to address the long-standing crisis that is its foster care system.2  \nThis putative class action is brought on behalf of the foster children who suffer injuries \nresulting from Defendants’ inaction. These foster children seek to enjoin Defendants, the State \nactors charged with protecting them, from continuing to subject them to substantial risk of harm \nfrom statewide policies, both written and unwritten,3 and practices that degrade their worth and \nwell-being. The aforementioned policies and practices include a shortage of placements, the near \nabandonment of timely assessments and case plans, chronically high caseloads, and an insufficient \nnumber of caseworkers.4 The harms, which affect all foster children in West Virginia, especially \nendanger those foster children belonging to the subclasses of this action: children with disabilities, \nchildren in kinship care, and older teens “aging out” of foster care.  \nDefendants appear to appreciate that the West Virginia foster care system has fallen apart. \nAn internal email from 2016 reveals the panic of Nancy Exline, the Commissioner for the Bureau \nfor Children and Families, over the severe shortage of caseworkers. She writes, \"[w]e need to \ndeclare this as a crisis & send up a white flag to the feds & others . . . I truly no longer know how \nwe can do CPS as we are required.”5 In 2017, DHHR took a more measured tone: “[T]he way we \n \n2  See  Bureau  for  Children  and  Families,  Legislative  Foster  Care  Reports,  available  at \nhttps://dhhr.wv.gov/bcf/Reports/Pages/Legislative-Foster-Care-Reports.aspx (documenting general increase in West \nVirginia foster care population from 2013 through July 2020).  \n3 Defendants’ policies, which Plaintiff Children allege violate their constitutional and federal statutory rights, are not \nalways written policies. (See, e.g., ex. 1 at D139302, 310-11 (Kinship Care Strengths Assessment, A Second Chance, \nInc. (March 2019)) (hereinafter “Kinship Care Strengths Assessment”)). Defendants maintain both formal and \ninformal policies that guide the agency’s action and decisions, and that place Plaintiff Children at risk of harm.  \n4 Ex. 2 at D003776, 782 (Child and Family Services Reviews: West Virginia Final Report, U.S. Dep’t of Health and \nHuman Resources (2017) (hereinafter “2017 CFSR”) (noting, “caseworkers are not adequately assessing and \naddressing safety and risk initially or on an ongoing basis. . . . Contributing to these and other findings in the CFSR \nwas a consistent lack of or only limited contact with children and families. . . . The agency is not consistently \ncompleting quality comprehensive assessments of the needs of children and parents. . . . [T]he completion of quality \nongoing assessments is most challenging.”). \n5 Ex. 3 at D062426 (Email from Nancy Exline to Tina Mitchell (Aug. 3, 2016)). \n  2 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 131   Filed 09/02/20   Page 3 of 61 PageID #: 7734\nhave traditionally practiced may not always result in the best possible outcomes for our children \nand families.”6  \nYet even the unabashed failures of foster care in West Virginia have not driven Defendants \nto undertake wholehearted reform. For example, DHHR has continuously opted out of creating \nlong-term retention plans for its overly shaky workforce and has done little to ensure that workers \ndevelop plans and deliver services to children in its custody. One report observed, “[t]here is not \na sense of urgency by the BCF in achieving a CPS workforce capable of conducting timelier \ninvestigations of child abuse allegations.”7 Similarly, West Virginia has lacked an adequate array \nof foster homes since as early as 2002.8 Nonetheless, as of 2017, Defendants had not yet developed \nand implemented “[a]n effective recruitment plan . . . to meet the increased need for quality homes \nin the state,”9 according to a federal audit. \n   Class action is the only remaining avenue to rouse Defendants from the stupor that enables \nan openly injurious foster care system to continue crippling children without reserve. Plaintiffs \nnow seek class certification on behalf of a general class of foster children, and three subclasses, to \nredress the federal statutory and constitutional violations that have come to define West Virginia’s \nchild welfare system.  \nII.  STATEMENT OF FACTS \n \nA.  West Virginia’s Foster Care System Has a Long Record of Common Failures \n \nThe evidentiary record developed thus far establishes that the practices and policies of \nDefendants expose the children in DHHR custody to a substantial risk of harm, in violation of their \n \n6 Ex. 4 at D057473, 476 (Semi-Annual Progress Report, West Virginia Dep’t of Health & Human Resources (Oct. 31, \n2017)). \n7 Ex. 5 at D055679, 680 (Summary of Child Welfare & CPS Audits, Dep’t of Health & Human Resources (April 10, \n2018)). \n8 Ex. 6 at D003152, 183 (Final Report, West Virginia Child and Family Services Review, U.S. Dep’t of Health and \nHuman Services Administration for Children and Families (October 2002) (hereinafter “2002 CFSR”)). \n9 Ex. 2 at D003776, 782 (2017 CFSR)). \n  3 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 131   Filed 09/02/20   Page 4 of 61 PageID #: 7735\nconstitutional and federal statutory rights.10 The practices and policies incontrovertibly promote \nthis risk of harm by (1) failing to maintain an adequate array of foster care placements, both in \nnumber and type; (2) failing to engage in adequate and appropriate case planning; and (3) failing \nto maintain appropriate staffing, which results in high caseloads and over-extended workers. \nCritically, these practices and policies affect all foster children in DHHR custody—whether they \nentered foster care due to a child abuse or neglect proceeding or a juvenile justice proceeding.  \nThe case files that Defendants have produced for the Named Plaintiff Children prove \nwoefully deficient. Expert witnesses for Plaintiffs did not hesitate in avowing that “[a]ll nine cases \nlacked even the rudimentary organization that child welfare case records require. Documents were \norganized neither by chronological date nor by categories.”11 The failure of Defendants to maintain \naccessible records has undoubtedly forced “DHHR workers and supervisors [to] reckon with a \nresource that resembles a giant, disassembled jigsaw puzzle rather than a professionally organized, \nlegal case record.”12 As a result, these records could not have “be[en] used for supervisory review, \ncontinuous quality improvement, safety assessment, safety planning or critical decision-making \nreview.”13 \n  Yet even fragmentary documentation cannot conceal the systemic failures and ensuing \ninjuries that pervade foster care in West Virginia. The case files of the nine Named Plaintiffs—\nwho entered foster care in different counties, for different reasons, and at different times—reveal \nthat DHHR committed the same chronic failures despite repeated warnings of the need for \nsignificant improvement. Indeed, Plaintiffs’ expert witnesses have concluded, “[w]hile some \n \n10 Cf. M.D. v. Perry, 294 F.R.D. 7, 45 (S.D. Tex. 2013) (“Individuals in the State's custody have a constitutional right \nto be free from an undue risk of harm, or, the same thing stated another way, a right to reasonably safe living \nconditions.”). \n11 Ex. 7, Declarations and Expert Report of Jan Flory, M.S.W., Susan Getman, M.S.W., and Elsa Popchak, L.S.W. \n(Aug. 2020) (hereinafter “Flory, Getman, and Popchak Report”) at p. 31. \n12 Id. at p. 31. \n13 Id. at p. 69. \n  4 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 131   Filed 09/02/20   Page 5 of 61 PageID #: 7736\nthemes are evident in 100% of the reviewed cases, . . . each remaining theme amounts to a major \nshortfall evident in 44% - 89% of the reviewed cases.”14 \nFirst, every child suffered the consequences of Defendant’s failure to assign them to stable \nplacements. This failure followed from both a haphazard placement process and an inadequate \nplacement array that has driven numerous foster children into out-of-state institutions.15 “The \ntrauma of multiple placements for [the Named Plaintiff] children was not only immediate but \ncumulative over many disruptions, resulting in behavior that was increasingly difficult to manage \nfor caregivers.”16 Plaintiffs’ experts thus concluded, “DHHR moved the children in these nine \ncases quickly from one placement to another, mostly without evidence of any pre-placement \nactivities to help them adjust to new living environments.”17  Indeed, in 2017, DHHR placed over \nnine percent of children in custody for less than a year in three or more placements. DHHR also \nplaced over twenty-eight percent of children in custody between twelve and twenty-four months \nin three or more placements.18 \nSecond, Plaintiffs’ experts also determined that Defendants consistently disregarded the \ncase planning necessary for any foster child to achieve stability. That is, “DHHR caseworkers do \nnot appear to engage in sufficient case planning so as to anticipate and strategize about beneficial \ninterventions to avoid foster care disruptions when a child has an outburst of negative behavior or \na mental health crisis.”19 And “caseworkers who were aware of a child’s pending discharge date \n \n14 Id. at p. 2. \n15 See ex. 8, Declaration and Expert Report of Nisha Sachdev, Psy.D.,_(Aug. 11, 2020) (hereinafter “Expert Report \non ADA Subclass”) at p. 39 (“The increase in youth placed out of state indicates that West Virginia still has significant \ngaps in in-state services to meet certain youth’s needs.”). \n16 Ex. 7, Flory, Getman, and Popchak Report at p. 15. \n17 Id. at p. 21. \n18 Ex. 9 at D137680, 689 (West Virginia AFCARS Context Data). \n19 Ex. 7, Flory, Getman, and Popchak Report at p. 25. \n  5 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 131   Filed 09/02/20   Page 6 of 61 PageID #: 7737\nfor a specific treatment program did not engage in sufficient planning regarding where the child \nwould be placed next.”20 \nAnd, third, the case files of the Named Plaintiffs demonstrate that DHHR has not sustained \na workforce capable of ensuring the children’s safety and wellbeing. Instead, “[t]he casework \npractice that was documented in these records raises serious concerns regarding the knowledge \nand skill  of frontline workers and supervisors.”21  Relatedly, “the shortage of qualified  and \nexperienced staff, high turnover, and high caseloads, result in the failed implementation of \n[DHHR] policies and procedures.”22  \nB.  Defendants’  Policies  and  Practices  Expose  Named  Plaintiffs  to  Actual, \nSubstantial Harm \n \nThe Named Plaintiff Children have suffered actual injuries. Defendants’ common policies \nand practices place the General Class at substantial risk of suffering as well. In the Fourth Circuit, \nsuch exposure to a substantial risk of harm establishes a constitutional injury. \n1.  Theo S.23 \nTheo S. is eight years old and has been in foster care for over four years. Although Theo \nwas born with a high drug withdrawal score, DHHR screened out the report and released him to \nhis mother. Over the following years, DHHR received eight additional reports of suspected child \nabuse and neglect relating to drug abuse, domestic violence, housing instability, and inappropriate \nliving conditions. DHHR finally removed Theo from his parents at the age of three.  \nOver the past four years, DHHR has placed Theo in eleven different placements, including \neight foster or kinship placements, two psychiatric hospitals, and an out-of-state residential \ntreatment program where he still remains. Throughout these placements, caregivers have reported \n \n20 Id. at p. 22. \n21 Id. at p. 32. \n22 Ex. 8, Expert Report on ADA Subclass at p. 16. \n23 Ex. 7, Flory, Getman, and Popchak Report at pp. 36-79. \n  6 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 131   Filed 09/02/20   Page 7 of 61 PageID #: 7738\nto DHHR Theo’s escalating and alarming behaviors, including threats to kill himself. Despite the \nobvious signs of his need for help, DHHR did not try to implement individualized treatments to \naddress his behavioral needs until his tenth placement. Moreover, the record does not specify \nTheo’s permanency plan or the steps that DHHR has taken to move him towards permanency.  \n2.  Serena S.24  \nSerena is eleven years old. She was born with both Down Syndrome and congenital heart \ndisease. In January 2019, DHHR removed ten-year-old Serena and her brother from their home \ndue  to  educational  neglect  and  her  parents’  failure  to  provide  safe  and  adequate  living \narrangements. Although DHHR set Serena’s permanency goal as reunification, the record does not \nreflect any efforts by the Department to arrange for parental visits. In September 2019—nine \nmonths after her removal—the court terminated her parents’ parental rights.  \nSince Serena entered foster care, DHHR has placed her in four foster homes and one \nkinship placement. Notably, in each placement, caseworker contact notes are sparse and sometimes \noccur months apart. DHHR also failed to arrange visits between Serena and her brother, and sibling \nvisits did not occur until her foster parents arranged visits in August 2019. Additionally, Serena \nhas consistently displayed sexually inappropriate behavior and disclosed that a bearded monster \nwould “eat her down there”. Despite these remarks, DHHR has not conducted an investigation or \nevaluated  Serena  for  possible  sexual  abuse.  Her  entire  record  is  “extraordinarily  poorly \ndocumented” and “out of compliance with . . . DHHR’s policies [and] its very foundational \nprinciples.” \n3.  Anastasia M.25 \n \n24 Id. at pp. 80-132. \n25 Id. at pp. 134-75.  \n  7 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 131   Filed 09/02/20   Page 8 of 61 PageID #: 7739\nAnastasia M. is a twelve-year-old girl. She has been in DHHR’s custody twice. When \nAnastasia was four years old, DHHR removed her from her parents and placed her brother and her \nwith a foster mother, Ann M. Shortly thereafter, DHHR investigated and closed Ann’s foster home \nand removed the children. Over the next several months, Anastasia cycled through multiple \nplacements until DHHR returned Anastasia to Ann. Ann later adopted Anastasia.  \nDHHR received multiple reports of Ann’s abuse towards Anastasia and her adoptive \nsiblings, including reports of extreme disciplinary practices. Finally, in February 2019, DHHR \nremoved eleven-year-old Anastasia, as well as the other children in Ann’s care, and placed her in \nfoster care. Since she re-entered state custody, DHHR has placed Anastasia in at least five different \nplacements. She currently resides in a congregate care facility in Georgia. The court, meanwhile, \nhas issued a no-contact order between Anastasia and her adoptive mother. Despite the order, \nDHHR’s current permanency plan for Anastasia remains reunification with Ann.  \n4.  Ace L.26 \nAce L. is a thirteen-year-old boy who has been in DHHR custody twice. DHHR first \nremoved Ace, along with his older sister, from his mother’s care when he was three years old due \nto allegations of  neglect, drug abuse, and exposure to physical and sexual abuse. Following an \nimprovement period, DHHR returned the children to their mother. Over the next four years, Ace \nand his sister suffered continued abuse and neglect. In 2016, DHHR again removed the children. \nOver the past four years, DHHR has placed Ace in nineteen different placements, which \nhave included foster homes, emergency shelters, psychiatric hospitals, and in-state and out-of-state \ngroup care facilities. During this time, DHHR has failed to provide Ace with adequate services to \naddress, among other issues, his encopresis, a disorder that frequently results from sexual abuse. \n \n26 Id. at pp. 177-219.  \n  8 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 131   Filed 09/02/20   Page 9 of 61 PageID #: 7740\nIt has also shuffled Ace from placement to placement and, as a result, he has lost most of his \nfamilial and community connections. Still further, Defendants have failed to search for a family-\nlike placement that would accommodate his specialized needs.  \n5.  Karter W.27 \nKarter W. is fourteen years old and has been in foster care in West Virginia for four years. \nBefore placing Karter in foster care, DHHR received twenty-two reports of suspected abuse or \nneglect, several of which occurred during the first two years of his life. Nonetheless, DHHR did \nnot remove Karter from his mother’s care until he was ten years old. Shortly after his removal, his \nmother voluntarily relinquished her parental rights. Despite his young age, DHHR never looked \nfor a permanent home for Karter. Instead, DHHR set his permanency goal as independence.  \nIn the four years that Karter has been in foster care, DHHR has placed him in eight different \nplacements, including four emergency shelters, one temporary therapeutic foster home, in-state \nand out-of-state long-term psychiatric facilities, and an out-of-state congregate care facility. \nDHHR moved Karter from his seventh placement, a psychiatric facility in Virginia, after staff \nallegedly used excessive force to restrain him. He currently resides in a residential treatment \nfacility in Pennsylvania.  \n6.  Gretchen C.28 \nGretchen C. is sixteen years old. She first came to the attention of DHHR when she was \neight months old. Over the years that followed, DHHR received many reports of alleged abuse and \nneglect of Gretchen, including reports of sexual abuse, parental drug use, and exposure to domestic \nviolence. Still, DHHR did not remove her. Eventually, Gretchen began exhibiting her own extreme \nbehaviors. And, in March 2016, she entered foster care pursuant to a delinquency proceeding. Over \n \n27 Id. at pp. 220-66.  \n28 Id. at pp. 267-322.  \n  9 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 131   Filed 09/02/20   Page 10 of 61 PageID #: 7741\nless than four years, DHHR cycled Gretchen through sixteen different placements. Her placements \nincluded a detention center, five emergency shelters, four short-term psychiatric hospitals, and six \nresidential facilities, one of which was out of state. In December 2019, Gretchen was placed in the \ncustody of her grandmother and exited DHHR custody.  \n7.  Jonathan R.29  \nJonathan R. is seventeen years old. DHHR has had custody of him for roughly four years. \nHis biological parents physically, mentally, and sexually abused Jonathan and struggled with drug \naddictions. When Jonathan was seven years old, they consented to a private adoption of Jonathan \nand his younger brother. From April 2010 until May 2016, Jonathan remained with his adoptive \nparents. Throughout these six years, DHHR received numerous reports about Jonathan’s safety in \nthe home, and, in May 2016, removed Jonathan from his adoptive home.  \nDuring four years in foster care, Jonathan has experienced twelve placements, including \nthree emergency shelters, three psychiatric hospitals, two out-of-state residential care facilities, \ntwo in-state residential care facilities, and one kinship placement.30 Several different DHHR \ncaseworkers have been assigned to his case. Jonathan became increasingly depressed while in \nDHHR custody, and, in December 2018, he was hospitalized after threatening to harm himself and \nstaff. Jonathan’s mother reportedly was present for his hospital admission. She petitioned the court \nto reinstate her parental rights, but the court denied her petition. In February 2019, DHHR placed \nJonathan with his maternal grandmother, who later became certified as a foster parent.   \n8.  Dennis C.31 \nDennis C. is seventeen years old and has been in DHHR custody twice. In 2003, DHHR \nremoved him from his family when he was six months old because he suffered a brain injury and \n \n29 Id. at pp. 323-60.  \n30 DHHR failed to document one of Jonathan’s 2018 placements.   \n31 Id. at pp. 361-402.  \n  10 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 131   Filed 09/02/20   Page 11 of 61 PageID #: 7742\nstroke from Shaken Baby Syndrome. As a result of the injuries, Dennis experiences cognitive \ndelays, an intellectual disability, a weakened left hand and arm, and other mental health disorders. \nDHHR soon returned Dennis to his family. Between 2013 and 2014, DHHR received seven reports \nof alleged abuse and neglect. In 2014, DHHR again removed Dennis, along with his older brother.  \nSince  Dennis  re-entered  foster  care,  DHHR  has  moved  him  between  ten  different \nplacements. DHHR has placed Dennis in three foster homes (two of which were therapeutic), with \nrelatives on three separate occasions, in three emergency shelter care placements, and in one \nresidential facility. DHHR has also set various permanency goals for Dennis that ranged from \nadoption and guardianship with relatives to independent living. Although Dennis was legally freed \nfor adoption in 2015 and has stated that he wants to live with his grandmother, his case file contains \nminimal, if any, record of permanency planning by DHHR. Dennis currently resides at a residential \nfacility in West Virginia. From this facility, DHHR plans to transition him to assisted living in the \ncommunity. Dennis’s functioning renders this goal unlikely to succeed. \n9.  Garrett M.32  \nIn April 2020, Garrett M. turned eighteen years old. He had been in DHHR custody for \nseven years. Garrett was born in New York, where he lived with his biological parents and siblings. \nNew York’s Administration for Children’s Services became involved with his family after his \nyoungest sister was born testing positive for opiates. Garrett’s father and other family members \nphysically and sexually abused Garrett and his younger sisters. In January 2011, Garrett’s mother \ndied of a drug overdose. His father subsequently lost custody of the children.  \nGarrett and his sisters were sent to live in West Virginia with their aunt and uncle. In May \n2013, DHHR removed the children from their aunt and uncle’s home following investigations of \n \n32 Id. at pp. 404-56.  \n  11 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 131   Filed 09/02/20   Page 12 of 61 PageID #: 7743\nphysical abuse. DHHR moved Garrett to at least eighteen different institutional placements during \nhis time in its custody. Garrett, severely depressed, attempted suicide at least twice while in foster \ncare. His placements included only two therapeutic foster homes, several emergency shelters, \nseveral detention centers, a placement with his father, at least two congregate care facilities, and a \nkinship placement in Ohio. DHHR failed to prepare him for adulthood, and ultimately discharged \nhim to a relative with whom he had not visited during his entire seven years in foster care.   \n10.  Calvin K., Chris K., and Carolina K.33 \nCalvin K., Chris K., and Carolina K. are siblings, over whom DHHR maintained custody \nat the time Plaintiffs filed their Complaint. They were subsequently adopted, and, on February 2, \n2020, Defendants moved to dismiss their claims. (See ECF No. 56.) Plaintiffs opposed Defendants’ \nmotion, noting that, in their Complaint, Plaintiffs alleged that Chris and Calvin had been in foster \ncare for three years, Carolina had been in foster care for two years, and DHHR had placed all three \nin multiple foster homes. (See ECF No. 61.)  \nIII.  LEGAL STANDARD OF REVIEW \n \nA.  The Legal Standard for Class Certification \n \nClass certification is proper where a proposed class satisfies the four prerequisites of Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 23(a) and fits into one of the three types of class actions described in Rule 23(b). See, \ne.g., Berry v. Schulman, 807 F.3d 600, 608-609 (4th Cir. 2015).34 Rule 23(a) requires a plaintiff to \nshow “(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are \nquestions of law or fact common to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties \n \n33 Defendants have refused to produce the case files of Calvin K., Chris K., and Carolina K. Thus, Plaintiffs’ experts \nwere unable to prepare a report analyzing their experiences in foster care.  \n34 Cf. The Fourth Circuit acknowledges that “certification as a class action serves important public purposes,” \nincluding “promoting judicial economy and efficiency” and “afford[ing] aggrieved persons a remedy . . . not \neconomically feasible . . . through the traditional framework of multiple individual damage actions.” Gunnells v. \nHealthplan Servs., 348 F.3d 417, 424 (4th Cir. 2003) (quoting Moore’s Fed. Practice §23.02 (3d ed. 1999)). \n  12 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 131   Filed 09/02/20   Page 13 of 61 PageID #: 7744\nare typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). Moreover, Rule 23(b)(2), \ncommonly used to certify civil rights class actions, is satisfied where “the party opposing the class \nhas acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  \nWhile conducting a “rigorous analysis” to ensure Rule 23’s requirements have been met, \nWal-Mart Stores, Inc., v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 351 (2011), courts may consider merits questions \n“to the extent—but only to the extent—that they are relevant to determining whether the Rule 23 \nprerequisites for class certification are satisfied”, and may not “engage in free-ranging merits \ninquiries at the certification stage,” Amgen Inc. v. Conn. Ret. Plans & Tr. Funds, 568 U.S. 455, \n466 (2013). \nAt the same time, in determining whether proponents of certification have met their burden, \ndistrict courts have “wide discretion.” Id. at 424. Indeed, precedent has directed federal courts to \n“give Rule 23 a liberal rather than a restrictive construction, adopting a standard of flexibility in \napplication which will . . . ‘best serve the ends of justice for the affected parties and . . . promote \njudicial efficiency.’” Gunnells, 348 F.3d at 424  (quoting In re A.H. Robins, 880 F.2d 709, 740 \n(4th Cir. 1989)).35 \nCourts especially favor class certification, when, as here, the named plaintiffs allege civil \nrights violations that can be addressed on a class-wide basis. Nonetheless, the Fourth Circuit has \nheld that the decision of whether or not to certify a class must factor in the nature of the allegations. \nBrown, 785 F.3d at 921 (vacating district court’s decision denying certification to proposed \nplaintiff class alleging discriminatory work-place policies and practices and noting, “the nature of \n \n35 See also Brown v. Nucor Corp., 785 F.3d 895, 921 (4th Cir. 2015) (holding “Rule 23 provides wide discretion to \ndistrict courts, in part, to promote the systemic class action virtues of efficiency and flexibility. The realization of such \nbenefits, however, requires that a district court exercise its judgment in a reasoned and expeditious manner.”).  \n  13 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 131   Filed 09/02/20   Page 14 of 61 PageID #: 7745\nthe allegations, the evidentiary support . . . and the inherent  cohesiveness  of the  class  all \ndemonstrate that the court’s failure to certify was an error.”).  \nSignificantly, courts within the Fourth Circuit have consistently certified classes that, like \nthe proposed class and subclasses, are comprised of individuals in state custody whose rights \ndefendants’ policies and practices violate. See, e.g., Scott v. Clarke, 61 F. Supp. 3d 569, 583 (W.D. \nVa. 2014) (certifying class of approximately 1,200 female prisoners alleging that the policies and \npractices at the correctional facility subjected them to substandard medical care in violation of \ntheir constitutional rights).36 In the foster care context, federal courts across the country have \ngranted class certification where plaintiff children allege that state child welfare agencies, through \ntheir policies and practices, subjected class members to harm, or a substantial risk thereof, in \nviolation of their constitutional rights. See, e.g., B.K. v. Snyder, 922 F.3d 957 (9th Cir. 2019), cert. \ndenied, No. 19-765, 2020 U.S. LEXIS 1731, at *1 (Mar. 23, 2020).37 \nIn  this  instance,  Plaintiffs  have  satisfied  the  four  Rule  23(b)  prerequisites.  Because \nPlaintiffs’ requested injunctive relief aims at correcting Defendants’ unconstitutional conduct, the \nclass action is therefore properly maintained under Rule 23(b)(2).38 See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 564 \n \n36 See also Buffkin v. Hooks, No. 1:18-CV-502, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 202875, at *44 (M.D.N.C. Nov. 30, 2018) \n(certifying a class of “all current and future prisoners in [the Department of Public Safety’s custody] who have or will \nhave chronic Hepatitis C virus and have not” received proper treatment); Bumgarner v. NCDOC, 276 F.R.D. 452 \n(E.D.N.C. 2011) (certifying “a class of all present and future disabled inmates of the [Department of Corrections] \n‘who have been, and may in the future be, . . . denied the benefits of the DOC’s sentence reduction credit program by \nreason of their disabilities.’”).  \n37 See also M.D. v. Abbott, 907 F.3d 237, 271 (5th Cir. 2018); DG v. Devaugh, 594 F.3d 1188, 1194 (10th Cir. 2010); \nMarisol A. by Forbes v. Giuliani, 126 F.3d 372, 380 (2d Cir. 1997); Baby Neal v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 56 (3d Cir. 1994). \n38 Plaintiffs are not required to establish ascertainability under Rule 23(b)(2) in the instant action. While “Rule \n23 contains an  implicit  threshold  requirement  that  the  members  of  a  proposed  class  be  ‘readily \nidentifiable,’” Krakauer v. Dish Network, L.L.C., 925 F.3d 643, 654-55 (4th Cir. 2019), the implicit “ascertainability” \nrequirement does not apply to Rule 23(b)(2) class actions seeking only injunctive and declaratory relief, as Plaintiffs \ndo here, because Rule 23(b)(2) class actions do not require notice as do (b)(3) class actions. Cole v. City of Memphis, \n839 F.3d 530, 542 (6th Cir. 2016) (“The decisions of other federal courts and the purpose of Rule 23(b)(2) persuade \nus that ascertainability is not an additional requirement for certification of a (b)(2) class seeking only injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief.”); Shelton v. Bledsoe, 775F.3d 554, 561 (3d Cir. 2015) (“a judicially created implied requirement \nof ascertainability—that the members of the class be capable of specific enumeration—is inappropriate for (b)(2) \nclasses.”); Shook v. El Paso Cty., 386 F.3d 963, 972 (10th Cir. 2004) (“while the lack of identifiability is a factor that \nmay defeat Rule 23(b)(3) class certification, such is not the case with respect to class certification under Rule \n  14 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 131   Filed 09/02/20   Page 15 of 61 PageID #: 7746\nU.S. at 360 (stating Rule 23(b)(2) is appropriate when “a single injunction or declaratory judgment \nwould provide relief to each member of the class.”).  \nIV.  THE COURT SHOULD CERTIFY THE GENERAL CLASS AND ALL THREE \nSUBCLASSES  BECAUSE  PLAINTIFF  CHILDREN  MEET  THE \nREQUIREMENTS OF RULE 23(A) \n \nA.  The Plaintiff Class Is So Numerous that Joinder Is Impracticable \n \nUnder Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1), the proposed class is sufficiently numerous to make joinder \nimpracticable. “[A]pplication of the Rule is to be considered in light of the particular circumstances \nof the case”. Cypress v. Newport News Gen. & Nonsectarian Hosp. Ass’n., 375 F.2d 648, 653 (4th \nCir. 1967). Generally, “where [] knowledge and common sense would indicate that [the proposed \nclass] is large, the numerosity requirement is satisfied.” Mitchell-Tracey v. United Gen. Title Ins. \nCo., 237 F.R.D. 551, 556 (D. Md. 2006). \nAlthough “[n]o specified number is needed to maintain a class action,” Cypress, 375 F.2d \nat 145, “a class of as few as twenty-five to thirty members raises a presumption that joinder would \nbe impracticable,” Rodger v. Elec. Data Sys. Corp., 160 F.R.D. 532, 535 (E.D.N.C. 1995).39 In \nfact, the Fourth Circuit has affirmed certification for putative classes with as few as eighteen \nmembers. See Cypress, 375 F.2d at 653. Additionally, “where the relief sought for the class is \ninjunctive and declaratory in nature, more speculative representations as to the size of the class \nsuffice as to the numerosity requirement.” L.S. by and through Ron S. v. Delia, No. 5:11-CV-354-\nFL, 2012 WL 12911052, *22 (E.D.N.C. Mar. 29, 2012).  \nIn  this  instance,  the  General  Class  and  each  Subclass  easily  satisfy  the  numerosity \nrequirement. The General Class consists of approximately 6,970 children currently in the custody \n \n23(b)(2).”); Yaffe v. Powers, 454 F.2d 1362, 1366 (1st Cir. 1972) (\"Notice to the members of a (b)(2) class is not \nrequired and the actual membership of the class need not therefore be precisely delimited.”). \n39 See also Dameron v. Sinai Hosp. of Baltimore, Inc., 595 F. Supp. 1404, 1407 (D. Md. 1984) (certifying “class \nconsist[ing] of at least 47 to 51 persons.”). \n  15 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 131   Filed 09/02/20   Page 16 of 61 PageID #: 7747\nof DHHR.40 The ADA Subclass and the Kinship Subclass each consists of thousands of children \ncurrently in foster care.41 Similarly, the Aging Out Subclass includes roughly 2,000 youth.42 These \nclasses are clearly large enough to make joinder impracticable. They also far exceed the thresholds \nof twenty-five to thirty named plaintiffs at which joinder remains presumptively impracticable. \nTherefore, Plaintiffs easily satisfy the numerosity requirement.  \nB.  The Putative Classes and Subclasses Share Common Questions of Law and \nFact \n \n1.  The commonality standard \n \n\"[F]or  purposes  of Rule  23(a)(2), even  a  single  common  question  will\"  satisfy  the \nrequirement for class certification of questions of law or fact common to the class. Wal-Mart \nStores, Inc., 564 U.S. at 359 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). The “common \ncontention . . . must be of such a nature that . . . determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an \nissue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.” Id. at 350. While class \nmembers must have suffered “a shared injury . . . spring[ing] forth from the same ‘common \ncontention,’” Ealy  v.  Pinkerton  Gov't  Servs.,  514  F.  App'x  299,  304  (4th  Cir.  2013),  “the \ncommonality requirement does not require that all class members share identical factual histories,” \nClarke, 61 F. Supp. at 586.43 Rather, “[d]espite the presence of individual factual questions, the \n \n40 Foster Care Placements Report, West Virginia Dep’t of Health & Human Resources (July 31, 2020) (hereinafter \n“2020 Placements Report”), available at https://dhhr.wv.gov/bcf/Reports/Documents/2020%20August%20 \nLegistlative%20Foster%20Care%20Placements%20Report.pdf).

Asbestos Processing, LLC, No. 0:11-cv-01800-JFA, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n1765, at *19 (D.S.C. Jan. 8, 2015).45 For “[b]oth the existence and the ‘common reach’ of such \nobjectively applied patterns or practices are likely to be indisputable from the outset, so that no \nreal commonality problems for class action maintenance ever arise in this regard.” Stastny v. S. \nBell Tel. & Tel. Co., 628 F.2d 267, 274 n.10. (4th Cir. 1980). Moreover, the commonality element \nis more easily established in proposed class actions that, like this action, seek injunctive or \ndeclaratory relief.  See Clarke, 61 F. Supp. 3d at 585.46 \nThe Supreme Court has compared commonality to the “glue” holding together plaintiffs’ \nclaims. See Wal-Mart, Inc., 564 U.S. at 352. For instance, statistical and anecdotal evidence can \nprovide the “glue” of commonality that Walmart requires. Brown, 785 F.3d at 915. Indeed—\nalthough “[c]ertification is only concerned with the commonality (not the apparent merit) of the \nclaims,” Lilly v. Harris-Teeter Supermarket, 720 F.2d 326, 332-33 (4th Cir. 1983)—the necessary \ninference, statistical data, and direct  evidence within this Motion establish the system-wide \npractice that both fulfills the commonality requirement for class certification and furthermore \nharms all class members or exposes them to a substantial risk of harm. See Stastny, 628 F.2d at \n \n44 See Neal, 43 F.3d at 59 (“[M]any . . . lawsuits challenging the provision of services to foster children have been \ncertified despite the varieties of factual differences that characterize the plaintiffs in each case and despite the variety \nof legal claims any one class may make.”). \n45 See also Thorn v. Jefferson-Pilot Life Ins. Co., 445 F.3d 311, 319 (4th Cir. 2006) (“A common question is one that \ncan be resolved for each class member in a single hearing, such as the question of whether an employer engaged in a \npattern and practice of unlawful discrimination against a class of its employees.”). \n46 See also McGlothlin v. Connors, 142 F.R.D. 626, 633 (W.D. Va. 1992) (“[S]uits for injunctive relief by their very \nnature present common questions of law or fact”); Twyman v. Rockville Hous. Auth., 99 F.R.D. 314, 321 (D. Md. \n1983) (same). \n  17 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 131   Filed 09/02/20   Page 18 of 61 PageID #: 7749\n278 (recognizing that commonality “might conceivably be shown by necessary inference from \nevidence of a sufficient number of instances . . . by statistical data . . . Or, of course, it may be \nshown by direct evidence or by admission that there is in fact such a system-wide practice.”). \nAt the same time, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. reversed certification of the plaintiffs’ class when \nthey could not demonstrate that class members had “suffered the same injury.”47 In Wal-Mart, 1.5 \nmillion female employees had argued that local store supervisors had violated Title VII by \ndiscriminating against them on the basis of sex. Id. at 343. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that \nsupervisors, who exercised wide discretion over such individual decisions, had issued employee \npay increases and promotions on a discriminatory basis. Id. at 344-45. Nonetheless, as the Supreme \nCourt responded, class certification requires more than “merely that [class members] have all \nsuffered a violation of the same provision of law.” Id. at 350. Rather, “[t]heir claims must depend \nupon a common contention—for example, the assertion of discriminatory bias on the part of the \nsame supervisor.” Id. Clearly, the plaintiff employees had not satisfied the standard.  \nThe Fourth Circuit has noted that “Wal-Mart did not set out a per se rule against class \ncertification where subjective decision-making or discretion is alleged. Rather, where subjective \ndiscretion is involved, Wal-Mart directs courts to examine whether . . . discretion [is exercised] in \na common way with some common direction.” Scott v. Family Dollar Stores, Inc., 733 F.3d 105, \n113 (4th Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted).48 Similarly, “[o]ther district courts have \nrecognized . . . that [Wal-Mart’s] analytical regime concerning ‘commonality’ does not serve as a \n \n47 Wal-Mart, Inc., 564 U.S. at 350. \n48 For instance, in Family Dollar Stores, similarities between the proposed class and the class in Wal-Mart did not \nstop the Fourth Circuit from holding, on review, that, “[t]he district court’s denial of leave to amend the complaint on \ngrounds that it was foreclosed by Wal-Mart is erroneous and based on a misapprehension of the applicable law.” 733 \nF.3d at112. Family Dollar Stores concerned fifty-one named plaintiffs seeking to represent a putative class of female \nstore managers. Id. at 108. The plaintiffs alleged that Defendants violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \nand the Equal Pay Act by paying plaintiffs less than their male counterparts. Id. At the time, Family Dollar operated \napproximately 7,000 stores across forty states.

As the \nPlaintiff  Children  allege  harms  stemming  from  Defendants’  unconstitutional  policies  and \npractices, their claims depend upon a “common contention.” That is, the approximately 7,000 class \nmembers, who generally reside in West Virginia, all allege harms that stem from statewide policies \nand practices and are therefore capable of resolution in “one stroke” as Wal-Mart requires.49  \n2.  Substantial evidence of commonality exists with respect to the General \nClass \n \nThe General Class50 identifies common questions of fact and law, each of which satisfies \nthe commonality requirement and are capable of resolution in “one stroke” on a classwide basis. \nQuestions of fact common to the classes include: \n•  whether Defendants fail to protect the General Class from physical, psychological, and \nemotional harm, and risk of harm; \n•  whether Defendants deprive Plaintiffs of the Kinship Subclass of necessary home safety \nassessments, case management and other services, and permanency planning; \n•  whether Defendants deprive Plaintiffs of the ADA Subclass of necessary and appropriate \nservices and treatment to make them as able as their non- disabled peers to access an array \nof community-based placements and services to ensure access to the least restrictive \nenvironment;  \n•  whether the Defendants offer supports and caseworker resources adequate to ensure that \nfoster children fourteen years or older receive transition planning such that children that \nage out of the system into adulthood have adequate planning and resources to meet future \nhousing, employment, educational, and other social needs.  \n \n49 See e.g., M.D. v. Perry, C.A. No. C-11-84, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 152121, at *5-6 (S.D. Tex. July 21, 2011) \n(“Whereas ‘the respondents [in Wal-Mart] wish[ed] to sue about literally millions of employment decisions at once,’ \nwhich occurred all around the nation, here Plaintiffs’ claimed injuries result from the common alleged deficiencies in \nthe Texas foster care system. Those alleged deficiencies are the ‘glue’ holding the claims together here. Plaintiffs have \nmuch more in common than did the million-plus, nation-wide class at issue in Wal-Mart.” (internal citation omitted)).  \n50 In West Virginia, children enter foster care, and therefore DHHR custody, through both dependency and juvenile \njustice proceedings. See DHHR Foster Care Police § 1.8 (describing seven avenues through which children may enter \nfoster care, which include, inter alia, CPS taking a child into emergency custody after filing a petition alleging \nabuse/neglect, a status offense bringing the child to the attention of the juvenile court, or a child being charged and/or \nadjudicated as a delinquent). All such children belong to Plaintiffs’ General Class.  \n  19 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 131   Filed 09/02/20   Page 20 of 61 PageID #: 7751\n•  whether the Defendants operate a system that promptly and adequately assesses the \nindividual needs of members of the class;  \n•  whether Defendants operate a system that adequately plans placements, treatment, and \nsupports appropriate to the individual needs of the members of the class and subclasses;  \n•  whether the Defendants operate a system that provides an adequate diversity of placements \nto permit the members of the class to reside in the most integrated, least restrictive, and \nmost family-like environment; and \n•  whether the Defendants provide adequate caseworker resources to ensure that members of \nthe class can routinely meet with caseworkers face-to-face and engage in individual \nservices. \n \nQuestions of law common to the classes include: \n \n•  whether Defendants’ systemic failures violate Plaintiffs’ substantive rights under the Due \nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, including \nexposing children to further neglect, abuse, and trauma through unnecessary and too-\nfrequent moves;  \n•  whether Defendants’ systemic failures violate Plaintiffs’ right to all reasonable efforts to \nachieve permanency, under the First, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United \nStates Constitution, including by separating them unnecessarily from their families and \nsiblings, and segregating them in institutions;  \n•  whether  Defendants’  systemic  failures  violate  Plaintiffs’  rights  under  the  Adoption \nAssistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, as amended by the Adoption and Safe Families \nAct of 1997, including their right to placement in the least restrictive, most family-like \nhome and their right to all reasonable efforts to achieve permanency; and  \n•  whether Defendants’ systemic failures violate Plaintiffs’ rights under the Americans with \nDisabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act \n(“RA”), 29 U.S.C. § 794, and the respective implementing regulations, including by \nunnecessarily placing youth with disabilities in institutional settings and denying them \naccess to community-based treatment.  \n \nAs  Plaintiffs  allege  that  Defendants’  system-wide  policies  and  practices  expose  all \nmembers of the General Class to a substantial risk of harm, in violation of their constitutional and \nfederal  statutory  rights,  “defendant's  allegedly  standardized practices  .  .  .  support  a  finding \nof commonality.” Hoffman v.

As the \nWashington Post recently reported, “[f]or more than a decade, foster homes and emergency \nshelters have been short of beds.”86 In fact, as early as 2002, “the CFSR process indicated that \nmost children in the foster care cases reviewed did not have permanency and stability in their living \nsituations.”87 The report specified that the instability followed from “(1) a scarcity of specialized \nplacements for children with behavioral problems or special care needs and, (2) an inconsistency \nin matching children with appropriate foster families or placement settings.”88 Even then, “children \noften [were] placed in shelters because there [was] nowhere else to put them and some children \nremain[ed] in shelters for long periods of time.”89 After fifteen years, at the time of the next federal \nreview, Defendants still had not remedied the problem.

Foster care providers have “reported not being treated with respect and \nnot having their opinions heard or considered.”94  \nOf course, Defendants already know that DHHR does not respect foster parents in the \nagency process. A 2015 investigation by the DOJ informed the State that “[f]amilies perceive their \ninteractions with DHHR as more punitive than supportive, undermining the potential to develop \nstrengths in the home and keep children in the community.”95 Likewise, “many parents report[ed] \nthat the state did not treat them as a partner in the treatment decision-making process.”96 The 2017 \nCFSR reached an analogous conclusion: “the needs of foster parents [in West Virginia] are not \nconsistently assessed and services provided as appropriate.’”97  \n \n90 Ex. 2, 2017 CFSR at D003797-98. \n91 Id. at D003782. \n92 PIP Review at p. 36. \n93 Ex. 20 at D066935, 938-939 (2019 Memorandum of Understanding Between the State of West Virginia and  \nthe United States Department of Justice (May 9, 2019)). \n94 PIP Review at p. 38. \n95 DOJ letter at p. 3.  \n96 Id. at p. 11. \n97 Ex. 2, 2017 CFSR at D003782. \n  26 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 131   Filed 09/02/20   Page 27 of 61 PageID #: 7758\nWhether  Defendants’  statewide  failure  to  recruit  and  retain  an  adequate  array  of \nappropriate foster placements exposes all West Virginia foster children to a substantial risk of \nharm is a common question of law and fact suitable for class treatment, and thus satisfies \ncommonality.  \nb.  Lack of appropriate case planning \n \nChild welfare policy in West Virginia recognizes that “[t]he likelihood of achieving \noutcomes [in child welfare] is directly related to the appropriateness of case planning.”98 Thus, \n“permanency planning efforts should begin as soon as a child enters care”99 and “concurrent \nplanning should be utilized in an effort to expedite the achievement of permanency for these \nchildren.”100 In practice, however, DHHR has all but abandoned State policy. The Department \ndoes not engage in critical permanency planning or effective case review for the majority of \nchildren in the West Virginia foster care system.  \nDefendants avoid proper case planning in part by excluding integral participants from the \nplacement process, including from participation in multidisciplinary team (“MDT”) meetings.101 \nAs “[c]aregivers have rights related to privacy and due process . . . includ[ing] being informed and \ninvolved,”102 State policy requires that “[s]pecial attention be placed on engaging the family and \nthe foster parents in the MDT process.”103 Yet, in a 2017 survey, only “28% of foster parents \nindicated that they were always notified of MDTs” and only nineteen percent of foster parents \nindicated that they “participate[d] with the development of case planning.”104 Thus, DHHR fails \n \n98 DHHR Youth Services Policy, § 6.1, July 2020, available at https://dhhr.wv.gov/bcf/policy/Documents/Youth \n%20Service%20Policy%20July%202020.pdf. \n99 Foster Care Policy at § 1.1; see also Adoption Policy at § 1.2. \n100 Ex. 11, 2015-2019 CFSP at D004013; see also Adoption Policy at § 4.11. \n101 See ex. 21 at D003816, 948 (West Virginia 2019 Child and Family Services Plan (hereinafter “2019 CFSP”)).  \n102 DHHR Child Protective Services Policy, § 1.2, July 2020, available at https://dhhr.wv.gov/bcf/policy/Documents \n/CPS%20Policy%20July%202020%202nd%20Version.pdf.  \n103 Adoption Policy at § 4.9.1. \n104 Ex. 21, 2019 CFSP at D003922. \n  27 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 131   Filed 09/02/20   Page 28 of 61 PageID #: 7759\nto  consistently  notify  “resource  parents  (foster  parents,  pre-adoptive  parents,  and  relative \ncaretakers) . . . about reviews or hearings with respect to a child in their care and their right to be \nheard.”105  \nLikewise, the 2017 CFSR found that “concurrent plans are viewed too often as consecutive \nplans and are not pursued concurrently,”106 and “concurrent goals are not being worked until after \nthe primary permanency plan has failed.”107 By depriving foster children of adequate case \nplanning, West Virginia has forced them to move through the system without safe ends in sight. \nChildren with complex needs suffer most acutely from this failure as addressing their needs \ngenerally depends upon methodical preparation.   \nDefendants further evade case planning through inaction outside of the MDT process. \nCaseworkers neglect to complete quality comprehensive assessments of the needs of children and \ntheir  parents.108  Nor  does  DHHR  contact  families  to  review  the  progress  of  case  goals.109 \nPredictably, foster parents have expressed an extreme dissatisfaction with the lack of appropriate \nand informational communication between case workers  and foster parents.110 This lack of \nmeaningful contact between caseworkers and families amounts to an underlying cause of poor \nperformance for child and family involvement in case planning.111 \nThe Named Plaintiffs have moved through the West Virginia foster care system without \nany cogent plan in place.

For  almost  two \ndecades, the Children’s Bureau has cautioned West Virginia against negligent case planning and \nagainst excluding families from the case planning process. The 2002 CFSR identified “a lack of \nclear documentation and identification of permanency goals” and “a need for more focus on \ndiligent efforts to achieve permanency for children.”115 More generally, the same report noted, \n“DHHR had not appropriately involved parents or children in the case planning process.”116 The \n2009 CFSR also concluded that “[t]he agency did not consistently facilitate the involvement of \nchildren and families in case planning, contrary to State policy.”117 By 2017, “[t]he agency [still] \nstruggled to make concerted efforts for the goals of timely reunification, discharge to guardianship, \nand timely adoption,”118 and “permanency goals were not established timely for children in foster \ncare in a significant number of cases.”119 The West Virginia 2019 Child and Family Services Plan \nmost recently observed a “lack of establishment of case plans/goals through engagement of family \nmembers.”120 \nAll class members are at substantial risk of harm due to Defendants’ failure to engage in \nadequate case planning.

An absence of consistent caseworker contact only aggravates these \ndeficiencies. Whether Defendants’ policies and practices related to case-planning thus expose \nchildren to a substantial risk of harm, in violation of their constitutional rights, is a common \nquestion of law and fact that satisfies the commonality requirement.  \nc.  High caseloads and chronic understaffing \n \nExcessive caseloads prevent caseworkers from ensuring the safety and wellbeing of foster \nchildren.121 DHHR, which has not established a caseload standard,122 counts the cases that a \ncaseworker carries by family.123 It counts the cases that a caseworker carries by child only after \nthe termination of parental rights.124  \nWhile the Child Welfare League of America recommends that caseworkers carry between \ntwelve and fifteen cases, and, for in-custody children, requires that cases be counted by child,125 \nDefendants have disregarded both standards. As of April 2020, caseworkers across the State \ncarried eighteen cases on average and also counted cases by family rather than by child in many \ninstances.126 In some counties, caseworkers carried more than thirty cases on average.127 Such high \ncaseloads cripple caseworkers from effectively doing their jobs.128 \n \n121 See ex. 8, Expert Report on ADA Subclass at p. 16 (“High turnover, child welfare workers overburdened with high \ncaseloads, and staff inexperience negatively impact the ability of the agency to assess children’s safety, ensure \nappropriate assessments and service provision, and engage families in the casework process.”). \n122 Ex. 24 at p. 2 (Email from Philip Peisch to Marcia Lowry, et al.

The audit listed the “[b]arriers to children receiving behavioral health assessments \nand/or services [as]: lack of contact by agency staff with children in non-placement cases, lack of \nmental health providers within a district, the focus on one child and failing to assess all children \nin the home, and limited follow-up on behavioral health issues when a child is reunified.”199 As of \nat least May 2015, BCF had already “identified the lack of treatment foster care and in-home \nservices and a weak children's mental health system as contributing factors to the high use of \ncongregate care.”200 \nThe uniformity of the criticisms over almost twenty years establishes that Defendants have \nnot taken meaningful action to correct their failures regarding the treatment of foster children with \ndisabilities.

For example, the 2019 CFSP found that DHHR issues caregiver payments inconsistently, \nfails to meet the needs of both the families and children, and does not adequately link caregivers \nto appropriate services.227 A 2019 internal study also warned that DHHR failed to provide \nsufficient training to kinship caregivers. The study specifically noted that “[t]raining locations and \nschedules are restrictive in meeting the needs of relative/kinship caregivers within the licensing \ntime period,” the available training is “designed . . . for traditional foster parents” rather than \nkinship caregivers, and no “clearly defined coordination of the training between DHHR and the \nSocial Worker Education Consortium” existed.228 Dennis C. especially suffered the second-rate \ncare that has defined kinship placement in West Virginia. Upon placing Dennis with his step-\ngrandmother, DHHR neglected to offer supportive services.

Substantial evidence of commonality exists with respect to the Aging-\nOut Subclass \n \nThe common questions of fact and law raised by all members of the Aging Out Subclass, \neach of which alone satisfies the commonality requirement for the Aging Out Subclass, and are \ncapable of resolution in “one stroke” on a classwide basis, include the following:  \n•  Whether Defendants deny members of the Plaintiffs’ Aging Out Subclass skills and \nresources necessary to learn to live independently, and providing them with necessary \ntraining, skills, and assistance in securing appropriate housing upon discharge; and \n•  Whether Defendants offer supports and case worker resources adequate to ensure that \nfoster children fourteen years or older receive transition planning to ensure children that \nage out of the system into adulthood have adequate planning and resources to meet future \nhousing, employment, educational, and other social needs.  \n \nThe Aging Out Subclass seeks to represent “transition-aged” youth, who are exposed to a \nsubstantial and disproportionate risk of harm by Defendants’ policies and practices toward older \nchildren in their care as a whole. Adolescents compose an increasing portion of the foster care \npopulation in West Virginia. As of 2019, the State’s rate for entry of adolescents ages fourteen to \nseventeen amounts to 14.2 per 1,000 children.230 This rate significantly surpasses the national \naverage of 2.8 per 1,000 children.231 Plaintiffs allege that all members of the Aging Out Subclass \nare exposed to a substantial risk of harm as a result of Defendants’ policies and practices, in \nviolation of their rights under the Constitution and federal law.  \nFederal law and State policy each require DHHR to provide distinct services to youth age \nfourteen or older.232 Youths “must be taught the skills needed to become a successful, self-\n \n230 Kristin Sepulveda & Sarah Williams, Older Youth in Foster Care Need Support to Make a Successful Transition \nto Adulthood, CHILD TRENDS (May 7, 2019), available at https://www.childtrends.org/older-youth-in-foster-care-\nneed-support-to-make-a-successful-transition-to-adulthood. \n231 Id. \n232 Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008, Pub.

Caseworkers “generally lack the knowledge and/or time to explore available \nresources such as free computers for foster children who are graduating from high school.”236 \nStudies have also “noted both an abundance of inappropriate concurrent permanency plans and a \nlack of preparation for independence for older children.”237 Instead, Defendants often resort to \n“Independent  Living”  as  “the  ‘catch  all’  for  all  older  youth,  whether  or  not  the  goal  was \nappropriate.”238  Ultimately,  DHHR  institutionalizes  seventy-one  percent  of  foster  children \nbetween the ages of twelve and seventeen.239 A DHHR corporate designee nonetheless testified \nthat she did not know whether the institutions provide independent living services.240 The designee \nalso testified that, while DHHR encourages agencies to recruit foster parents specifically for \ntransition age youth, she was unable to determine whether the efforts were successful.241  \n \n233 Foster Care Policy at § 1.6; see also Adoption Policy at § 10.9. \n234 See Youth Transitioning at p. 2. \n235 Id. at pp. 10-12; ex. 11, 2015-2019 CFSP at D004130. \n236 Ex. 30, 2008 Assessment at D003650. \n237 Id. at D003635. \n238 Ex. 11, 2015-2019 CFSP at D004013. \n239 DOJ Letter at p. 6.

The statistics and studies demarcating their fates are stark. In 2020, the \nNational Conference of State Legislatures reported that, upon aging out of care, twenty percent of \nyouth were immediately homeless, only fifty-eight percent had graduated high school by age \nnineteen, twenty percent still did not have a GED or high school diploma by age twenty-six, \ntwenty-five percent were involved in the criminal justice system within two years of leaving care, \nand nearly eighty percent of women became pregnant by age twenty-six.243 The National Foster \nYouth Institute similarly reported in 2017 that only fifty percent of foster children who age out of \ncare “will have some form of gainful employment by the age of 24,” twenty-five percent of \nchildren who age out of care suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and “[t]here is less than \na 3% chance for children who have aged out of foster care to earn a college degree at any point in \ntheir life.”244 \nThe Named Plaintiffs have suffered irreparable harm from Defendants’ failure to prepare \nthem to transition out of the foster care system. For education, Gretchen relies on self-guided \nprograms that progress without a teacher at her side.245 DHHR has also taken few steps to ensure \nthat she acquires any independent living skills.246 Garret likewise has not had vocational or life \nskills training.247 Numerous moves have caused Ace and Dennis to receive similarly fragmented \n \n242 See ex. 10, Expert Report on Aging Out subclass at p. 19 (“Given DHHR’s heavy reliance on congregate care and \ncongregate care’s documented poor outcomes, it is not surprising that West Virginian foster system alumni would be \nill-prepared for adulthood when they age out of care.”). \n243 Older Youth Housing, Financial Literacy and Other Supports, National Conference of State Legislatures (last \nvisited Aug. 26, 2020), available at https://www.ncsl.org/research/human-services/supports-older-youth.aspx. \n244 Aging Out of Foster Care, National Foster Youth Institute (May 26, 2017), available at  https://www.nfyi.org/51-\nuseful-aging-out-of-foster-care-statistics-social-race-media/. \n245 Ex. 7, Flory, Getman, and Popchak Report at p. 312.  \n246 See generally id. at pp. 267-322. \n247 Id. at 455. \n  47 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 131   Filed 09/02/20   Page 48 of 61 PageID #: 7779\nand ineffectual educations.248 Dennis, who is seventeen years old, reads at a third grade level, and \nDHHR has not equipped either youth to achieve stable and sustaining lives upon aging out into \nadulthood.249  \nDefendants’ system-wide policies and practices place all members of the Aging Out \nSubclass at a substantial risk of harm, raising common questions of law and fact and therefore \nsatisfying the commonality requirement.250  \nC.  The Claims of Named Plaintiff Children Are Typical  \n \n1.  The typicality standard \n \nNamed Plaintiffs’ assertions in this action are “typical of the claims . . . of the class” as \nrequired by the Federal Rules. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3). “The threshold requirements of . . .  \ntypicality are not high”. Brown, 576 F.3d at 153 (“Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) requires only that resolution \nof the common questions affect all or a substantial number of the class members. Allegations of \nsimilar discriminatory [] practices . . . satisfy the . . . typicality requirements of Rule 23(a)”). Here, \n“[t]he essence of the typicality requirement is captured by the notion that, as goes the claim of the \nnamed plaintiff, so go the claims of the class.” Deiter v. Microsoft Corp., 436 F.3d 461, 466 (4th \nCir. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also In re NII Holdings, Inc. Sec. Litig., 311 \nF.R.D. 401, 406 (E.D. Va. 2015) (typicality is “designed to ensure that the class representative[s’] \ninterests are sufficiently aligned with those of the other class members.”). In other words, by \nprosecuting their own case, the class representatives “tend to advance the interests of the absent \nclass members.” Deiter, 436 F.3d at 466.  \n \n248 Id. at p. 198, 208; id. at pp. 378, 386-87. \n249 Id. at p. 389. \n250 Ex. 10, Expert Report on Aging Out Subclass at p. 22 (“Based on current policies, practices, and outcomes, West \nVirginia DHHR operates a system that fails to meet its stated goals for children, with its pattern of failing to address \nsafety, permanency, and well-being of transition age youth.”). \n  48 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 131   Filed 09/02/20   Page 49 of 61 PageID #: 7780\nIn the Fourth Circuit, class representatives establish typicality by belonging to the class in \nquestion “and possess[ing] the same interest and suffer[ing] the same injury as the class members.” \nIn re Titanium Dioxide Antitrust Litig., 284 F.R.D. 328, 339 (D. Md. 2012) (quoting Deiter, 436 \nF.3d at 466). This standard does not require “members of the class [to] have identical factual and \nlegal claims in all respects.” In re BearingPoint, Inc. Sec. Litig., 232 F.R.D. 534, 538 (E.D. Va. \n2006) (quoting Broussard v. Meineke Disc Muffler Shops, 155 F.3d 331, 344 (4th Cir. 1998)). \nRather, variations among class members’ injuries do not defeat typicality as long as the members’ \nclaims challenge the same course of conduct and make similar legal arguments to prove the \ndefendants’ liability. Clarke, 61 F. Supp. 3d at 589 (“It does not matter that the named plaintiffs . \n. . suffered varying injuries . . . Rule 23(a)(3) requires only that their claims be ‘typical’ of the \nclass, not that they be identically positioned . . . to every other class member” (quoting Parsons, \n754 F.3d at 686)). In the context of certifying a class of foster children alleging constitutional \nviolations by State policy, “even relatively pronounced factual differences will generally not \npreclude a finding of typicality where there is a strong similarity of legal theories.” Baby Neal, 43 \nF.3d at 58. \n2.  Plaintiffs have satisfied the typicality requirement \n \nPlaintiffs have satisfied the typicality requirement. The histories of the Named Plaintiff \nChildren do present factual variations: the Named Plaintiffs come from seven different counties \nacross the State, suffered a variety of different kinds of trauma or were involved in juvenile justice \nproceedings before entering DHHR custody, and have differing mental health diagnoses and \nplacement histories. But such differences do not pertain to determinations of typicality. Here, \nNamed Plaintiffs’ claims all rest on the same legal theory as the members of the putative class—\ntheir exposure to a substantial risk of serious harm caused by Defendants’ policies and procedures.  \n  49 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 131   Filed 09/02/20   Page 50 of 61 PageID #: 7781\n  Caselaw within the Fourth Circuit supports this conclusion. In Clarke, for example, the \nnamed plaintiffs satisfied the typicality standard when, as here, they asserted that various State \npolicies and practices violated their constitutional rights by placing them at risk of harm. 61 F. \nSupp. 3d at 587. For the plaintiff inmates suffered from a “broad variety of medical problems” \nsince coming into the care of the state, all of which allegedly resulted from the state prison’s \nsubstandard medical care policies. Id. at 589. The Clarke court looked to the “essential question” \nto determine whether typicality existed: if, “by demonstrating the facts necessary to establish . . . \ntheir claims with respect to the systemic deficiencies . . . and Defendants’ deliberate indifference \nto Plaintiffs’ serious medical needs, ‘would also prove the claims of the absent class members.’” \nId. (quoting Dieter, 436 F.3d at 467). As the various medical problems were “representative of the \nadverse health issues experienced by the entire prison population,” the answer to the question was \nyes. Id. Additionally, if the challenged policies “fail[ed] to pass constitutional muster[,] . . . the \nresulting declaratory and injunctive relief would doubtless benefit the named Plaintiffs and all \nother [] prisoners alike.” Id. \nSimilarly, the Named Plaintiffs all remained in Defendants’ custody at the time of filing \nthe Complaint, their claims are identical to the claims of each class member, and their claims all \narise from the same course of conduct. Here, Plaintiffs’ Complaint alleges specific DHHR policies \nand practices violate Plaintiffs’ constitutional and federal statutory rights. For instance, they allege \nthat Defendants  have long failed to  maintain  a sufficient  number of foster homes, operate \ndysfunctional kinship care and transition-age youth programs, create inadequate case plans, \nmaintain insufficient community-based services, and overly rely upon out-of-state congregate care \nplacements. Plaintiffs further allege that DHHR caseworkers carry unreasonably high caseloads, \nare inadequately trained, and that high vacancy rates pervade DHHR offices. Although the \n  50 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 131   Filed 09/02/20   Page 51 of 61 PageID #: 7782\nComplaint only details the irreversible impact of these policies and practices on the twelve Named \nPlaintiffs, such systemic deficiencies harm every child in DHHR custody. The Named Plaintiffs \nhave not received any unusual treatment that would render their claim atypical. Moreover, the \nrelief that the Named Plaintiffs seek would benefit all class members in an identical manner. \nAccordingly, the Named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the class as they clearly \nsatisfy the “same class,” “same interest” and “same injury” criteria for typicality required by the \nFourth Circuit. Proving their claims would also prove the claims of the absent class members.  \nD.  The Named Plaintiff Children Will Adequately Represent the Class \n \n1.  The adequacy standard \n \nThe Named Plaintiffs also satisfy the final prerequisite under Rule 23(a), which mandates \nthat “the representative parties [ ] fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.” Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23(a)(4). Courts have developed a two-pronged test to determine whether Plaintiffs satisfy \nthe adequacy requirement: “(1) the named plaintiffs must not have interests antagonistic to those \nof the class; and (2) the plaintiffs’ attorneys must be qualified, experienced, and generally able to \nconduct the litigation.” In re Serzone Products Liab. Litig., 231 F.R.D. 221, 238 (S.D. W. Va. \n2005). “The burden is on the defendant to demonstrate that the representation will be inadequate.” \nHaywood v. Barnes, 109 F.R.D. 568, 579 (E.D.N.C. 1986).  \n2.  Plaintiffs have satisfied the adequacy requirement \n \nThe adequate representation inquiry “serves to uncover conflicts of interest between named \nparities and the class they seek to represent.” In re Serzone Prods. Liab. Litig., 231 F.R.D. at 238  \n(internal quotation marks omitted). Minor conflicts between named plaintiffs and the putative class \nmembers will not render the representatives inadequate. “To defeat the adequacy requirement of \nRule 23, a conflict ‘must be more than merely speculative or hypothetical.’” Gunnells, 348 F.3d \n  51 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 131   Filed 09/02/20   Page 52 of 61 PageID #: 7783\nat 430 (quoting 5 Moore’s Federal Practice § 23.25[4][b][ii] (2002)). Only a “fundamental” \nconflict that “go[es] to the heart of the litigation” will suffice to defeat adequacy. See id. at 430-\n31. No such fundamental conflict exists when “all class members share common objectives and \nthe same factual and legal positions [and] have the same interest in establishing the liability of \n[defendants].” Ward v. Dixie Nat’l Life Ins. Co., 595 F.3d 164, 180 (4th Cir. 2010) (internal \nquotation  marks  omitted).  “The  principal  factor  in  determining  the  adequacy  of  class \nrepresentatives is whether the plaintiffs have the ability and commitment to prosecute the action \nvigorously.” Thomas v. La.-Pacific Corp., 246 F.R.D. 505, 509 (D.S.C. 2007).  \nThe Named Plaintiffs satisfy the adequacy requirements of 23(a)(4) as no conflict—let \nalone a fundamental one—exists between them and other class members. The Named Plaintiffs \nalso share a common objective with the putative class members: to pursue claims common to the \nclass as a whole and to advance the common interest of reforming Defendants’ constitutionally \ndeficient foster care system on the basis of the same factual and legal positions.251 In seeking \ninjunctive relief to alter Defendants’ conduct and improve West Virginia’s child welfare practices \nfor all class members, they share the same interest in establishing the liability of Defendants. The \nrequested relief does not include money to be divvied up between class members to form potential \nconflicts, and no competition exists to achieving a foster care system in compliance with the \nConstitution and federal law. Accordingly, “Plaintiffs do not seek relief for themselves different \nin quality or character from the relief sought for the class as a whole.” Clarke, 61 F. Supp. at \n590.252  \n \n251 See supra, Sections IV.B, C (discussing commonality and typicality). \n252 See also Thomas v. La.-Pacific Corp., 246 F.E.D. 505, 509 (D.S.C. 2007) (finding Rule 23(a)(4) was satisfied \nbecause there was no conflict between plaintiffs and the class). Clarke further clarified that “Plaintiffs do not have \nany interests in conflict with the interests of the members of the class they seek to represent . . . [because] . . . Plaintiffs \nseek a declaratory judgment and an injunctive order requiring the Defendants to provide the constitutionally-required \nlevel of care sufficient to meet the serious medical needs of all [] prisoners.” Clarke, 61 F. Supp. at 590. \n  52 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 131   Filed 09/02/20   Page 53 of 61 PageID #: 7784\nAlso, Plaintiffs’ attorneys are amply qualified, experienced, and able to conduct this \nlitigation. As discussed in Section V, infra, Plaintiffs’ counsel have both the experience and \nexpertise in handling class action and civil rights litigation, particularly in matters relating to foster \ncare, disability rights, and unconstitutional governmental policies and practices. “Courts generally \nhold that the employment of competent counsel assures vigorous prosecution.” Thomas, 246 \nF.E.D. at 509 (quoting S.C. Nat’l Bank v. Stone, 139 F.R.D. 325, 331 (D.S.C. 1991)).   \n  Named Plaintiffs are appropriate and adequate class representatives as they do not have \nany interests antagonistic to the class as a whole, and counsel who satisfies the standards set forth \nin Rule 23(g) represents them. Named Plaintiffs will therefore “fairly and adequately protect the \ninterests of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).   \nE.  The Named Plaintiff Children Satisfy the Requirements of Rule 23(b) \n \n1.  The Rule 23(b) Standard \n \nIn addition to satisfying the prerequisites of Rule 23(a), the proposed class in this case \nsatisfies Rule 23(b)(2). Certification is appropriate under Rule 23(b)(2) when “the party opposing \nthe class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final \ninjunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.” \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). Rule 23(b)(2) has been “liberally applied in the area of civil rights.” \nBumgarner, 276 F.R.D. at 457. Notably, a West Virginia district court observed that both the \nSupreme Court and the Fourth Circuit had made “affirmative statements . . . that suits brought for \ninjunctive relief alleging civil rights violations are precisely the type of suit for which Rule \n23(b)(2) was intended to provide class certification.” Harris v. Rainey, 299 F.R.D. 486, 494 (W.D. \nVa. 2014) (citing Amchem Prods., Inc., 521 U.S at 614).253 \n \n253 See also Thorn, 445 F.3d at 331 (“[C]ertification under Rule 23(b)(2) is improper when the predominant relief \nsought is not injunctive or declaratory, even if the relief is equitable in nature.”); Clarke, 61 F. Supp. 3d at 591 \n  53 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 131   Filed 09/02/20   Page 54 of 61 PageID #: 7785\n“The key to the (b)(2) class is the indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy \nwarranted.” Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 564 U.S. at 360 (internal quotation marks omitted). Under this \nrequirement, class members must share a certain cohesiveness with respect to their injuries. The \nFourth Circuit has expressly stated that “Rule 23(b)(2)'s categorical exclusion of class actions \nseeking primarily monetary relief . . . ensures that the class is sufficiently cohesive [such] that the \nclass-action device is properly employed.” Harris, 299 F.R.D. at 497 (citing Thorn, 445 F.3d at \n330). After all, \"because of the group nature of the harm alleged and the broad character of the \nrelief sought, the (b)(2) class is, by its very nature, assumed to be a homogenous and cohesive \ngroup with few conflicting interests among its members.\" Berry, 807 F.3d at 608-11 (internal \nquotation marks omitted). “The essential consideration is whether the complaint alleges that the \nplaintiffs have  been  injured  by  defendants'  conduct  which  is  based  on policies  and \npractices applicable to the entire class.” Bumgarner, 276 F.R.D. at 457-58. Certification is thus \nappropriate where, as here, final injunctive relief is sought and will “settl[e] the legality of the \nbehavior with respect to the class as a whole.” Berry v. LexisNexis Risk & Info. Analytics Grp., \nInc., No. 3:11-CV-754, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124415, at *34 (E.D. Va. Sep. 5, 2014) (citing \nThorn, 445 F.3d at 329) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nNumerous courts across the country have certified classes of foster care children under \nRule 23(b)(2) where the relief sought is injunctive and would benefit all class members. In DG v. \nDevaughn, the Tenth Circuit affirmed the district court’s ruling254 to certify a plaintiff class of \n \n(granting motion for class certification and recognizing “Rule 23(b)(2) was drafted specifically to facilitate relief in \ncivil rights suits”); Olvera-Morales v. Int’l Labor Mgmt. Corp., 246 F.R.D. 250, 252 (M.D.N.C. 2007) (granting \nmotion  for  class  certification  of  temporary  foreign  workers  alleging  discriminatory  recruitment  practices  by \nemployment agency). \n254 Defendants in Devaughn challenged the lower court’s ruling by providing evidence that caseloads were not \nexcessive in rural areas and arguing that plaintiffs failed to show sufficiently similar injuries. In rejecting defendants’ \nargument, the court explained that (1) Rule 23(b)(2) does not require named plaintiffs to prove actual harm or exposure \nto risk of harm as to every class member at the certification stage;  and (2) the injuries alleged were sufficiently similar \nif they could “be addressed in a single injunction that need not differentiate between class members.” Id. 594 F.3d at \n  54 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 131   Filed 09/02/20   Page 55 of 61 PageID #: 7786\nfoster children who sought relief in the form of an injunction both setting limits on caseworker \ncaseloads and mandating that caseworkers visit the children on their caseloads more frequently. \n594 F.3d 1188, 1201 (10th Cir. 2010). The court reasoned that all class members, by virtue of \nbeing in defendants’ custody, were subject to defendants’ practice of assigning excessive caseloads \nand failing to ensure that caseworkers adequately monitored the children on their caseloads. Id. \nFurthermore, the named plaintiffs alleged the same injury—an impermissible risk of harm—on \nbehalf of all class members as a result of these deficient practices. Id. On these grounds, the court \nfound that the proposed class satisfied the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2). Id. \nSimilarly, in Connor B v. Patrick, the court certified a class of Massachusetts foster \nchildren alleging constitutional harms and seeking several forms of injunctive relief including \n“stricter limits on caseworker caseloads and increased visitation by caseworkers of children in \nfoster homes.” 272 F.R.D. 288, 297 (D. Mass. 2011). The court held that such “relief would benefit \nthe entire class” and was “fully consistent with Rule 23(b)(2). Id. Defendants in Connor B. argued \nthat Plaintiffs’ allegations required “highly-individualized determination[s]” and therefore were \nnot proper for class-wide treatment. Id at 297. In dismissing the argument, the court explained, \n“the existence of differences among members of the Plaintiff class does not make certification \nimproper. In fact, it is not uncommon for courts . . . to certify class actions in which alleged \nsystemic deficiencies resulted in harms that manifested themselves differently among different \nsegments of the plaintiff class.” Id. M.D. v. Perry likewise certified a proposed class of Texas \nfoster children under Rule 23(b)(2) who sought injunctive relief requiring defendants to assign a \ncaseworker to all class members and to establish caseload standards. 294 F.R.D. at 46-47. As the \ncourt reasoned, “Plaintiffs have alleged a unified harm to class members—an unreasonable risk of \n \n1201 (internal quotation marks omitted). The court held that imposing caseload limits and increasing monitoring could \nsufficiently mitigate the risk of harm suffered by all class members. Id. \n  55 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 131   Filed 09/02/20   Page 56 of 61 PageID #: 7787\nharm due to ineffective monitoring and planning because caseworkers are overburdened.” Id at 47.  \nPlaintiffs’ claim also proved “susceptible to common, specific relief . . . such as: setting maximum \ncaseloads [or] hiring more caseworkers”—although “[t]he Court need not, at this stage, determine \nwhat remedy Plaintiffs would be entitled to if they prevailed on the merits of their claim.” Id. \n“Critically, injunctions of this sort would require no additional individual assessments.” Id.  \nThe Fourth Circuit has embraced the preceding principles. In other words, the Circuit \nroutinely certifies classes under Rule 23(b)(2) when plaintiffs in state custody allege systemic \nfailures. See, e.g., Clarke, 61 F. Supp. 3d at 590-91.255  \n2.  Plaintiffs have satisfied the Rule 23(b)(2) requirement \n \nNamed Plaintiffs easily satisfy the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2). Defendants, through the \npolicies, practices, and procedures that compose their foster care program, have acted or refused \nto act on grounds generally applicable to each of the class members. For all class members are \nchildren in the custody of Defendants at the time of filing and so, despite differences in individual \nhistories and circumstances, all class members are equally subject to these deficient policies and \npractices and associated risks. Accordingly, Defendants’ conduct “is such that it can be enjoined \nor declared unlawful only as to all of the class members or as to none of them.” Wal-Mart Stores, \nInc., 564 U.S. at 360.  \n \n255 In Clarke, the court found the Rule 23(b)(2) standard was met where the proposed class of prisoner plaintiffs \nalleged the defendants provided deficient medical care “on a systemic basis that jeopardize[d] the continuing health . \n. . of all other prisoners” in their facility and “[i]f Plaintiffs ultimately prevail[ed] on the merits of their claims, the \nresulting declaratory and injunctive relief [would] apply to and benefit all members of the proposed class.” Scott, 61 \nF. Supp. 3d at 590-91; see also Bumgarner, 276 F.R.D. at 457-58 (holding declaratory and injunctive relief was \nappropriate because the harm alleged by plaintiffs—a proposed class of inmates in the custody of defendants—derived \nfrom the policies and practices of defendants’ sentence reduction program, which excluded disabled inmates from \ncertain benefits and therefore satisfied the requirements under Rule 23(b)(2)); Buffkin, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 202875 \nat *21 (granting certification of a proposed class of inmates diagnosed with Hepatitis C, who, under prison policy, \nwere not treated with anti-viral drugs, and stating that “it is the policy itself that Plaintiffs are challenging and because \n[the policy] applies to all members of the class, the requested relief would benefit all members.”). \n  56 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 131   Filed 09/02/20   Page 57 of 61 PageID #: 7788\nIndeed, Plaintiffs seek to cure system-wide failures rather than to adjudicate any individual \nchild’s case. Their Complaint identifies the need for an injunction that will increase caseworker \nstaffing, increase mental health services, ensure each child has a written case plan that provides \nfor permanency or reunification, and improve the quality and quantity of foster care placements \nthroughout the State of West Virginia. (See ECF No. 1, ¶ 405.) Such injunctive and declaratory \nrelief would clearly benefit all class members. \nHere, Plaintiffs’ claims cannot receive meaningful relief without the relief proceeding on \na class-wide basis. For instance, an order granting relief with respect to only one child, without \naddressing the system shortfalls, would “rob Peter to pay Paul”256 by shifting resources to benefit \none  child  away  from  another.  Accordingly,  the  court  would  be  playing  a  zero-sum  game. \nMoreover, granting relief to a particular child may provide temporary relief, but, as that child’s \nneeds change over time, the child will once again be subject to Defendants’ policies and practices \nwhich failed to provide for their needs in the first place. Accordingly, the court should certify the \nclass under Rule 23(b)(2) because Defendants’ unconstitutional practices apply generally to the \nclass and only final injunctive and declaratory relief will “settle the legality of the behavior with \nrespect to the class as a whole”. Thorn, 445 F.3d at 329 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nEach subclass similarly seeks broad, uniform injunctive relief to redress the additional, \nparticularized harms that each subclass of children suffers as a result of Defendants’ policies and \npractices: the Kinship Subclass seeks injunctive relief requiring Defendants to develop adequate \n \n256 Braggs v. Dunn, 317 F.R.D. 634, 667-69 (M.D. Ala. 2016). Braggs certified a class of prisoners under Rule 23(b)(2) \nwho alleged system-wide deficiencies in Defendants’ mental health system. Id. at 674. The court explained that, \n“[a]lthough the court could order . . . that a particular prisoner who currently requires psychiatric care be seen by a \npsychiatrist, it cannot order that adequate staffing be provided to the extent necessary to address any one particular \nprisoner’s mental-health care needs as they develop in the future . . . Moreover, any order remedying a systemic \ndeficiency with respect to only one prisoner would rob Peter to pay Paul; the court would be playing a zero-sum game, \nshifting mental-health care resources from one prisoner to another.” Id. at 668. \n \n \n  57 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 131   Filed 09/02/20   Page 58 of 61 PageID #: 7789\nstatewide kinship placement plans, provide adequate funding to unlicensed kinship caregivers, \nproperly monitor kinship placements, and ensure the proper execution of background checks and \nhome safety inspections; the ADA Subclass seeks injunctive relief requiring Defendants to develop \nand maintain an adequate array of therapeutic services and foster placements, and to provide \nservices to children with disabilities “in the most integrated setting appropriate to the child’s \nneeds”;  and  the  Aging-Out  Subclass  seeks  injunctive  relief  requiring  DHHR  to  implement \ntransition planning for youth over fourteen who are not imminently likely to achieve permanency, \nand prohibiting the refusal of a foster placement on the grounds of the youth being over fourteen \nyears of age. These subclasses satisfy the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) because the requested \nrelief for each responds to conduct of Defendants that generally affects all subclass members and \n“would provide relief to each member of the class.” Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 544 U.S. at 360.  \nV.  THE COURT SHOULD APPOINT CLASS COUNSEL \n \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(g) requires that the Court appoint class counsel for any \ncertified class. Class counsel must “fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class.” Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(B), (g)(4). In determining whether a proposed class satisfies this requirement, \ncourts “must consider (i) the work counsel has done in identifying and investigating potential \nclaims in the action; (ii) counsel’s experience in handling class actions, other complex litigation, \nand the types of claims asserted in the action; (iii) counsel’s knowledge of the applicable law; and \n(4) the resources that counsel will commit to representing the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(A). \n“[A]n essential concomitant of adequate representation is that the party’s attorney be qualified, \nexperienced and generally able to conduct the proposed litigation.” Barton v.

Indeed, over the course of ten months, counsel made \nmultiple trips to various parts of West Virginia to meet with dozens of key stakeholders, and spent \nhundreds of hours compiling and analyzing relevant data.258 Counsel have extensive experience \nand expertise in handling class action and civil rights litigation, particularly in matters relating to \nfoster care, disability rights, and unconstitutional governmental policies and practices.259 For \ninstance, Marcia Robinson Lowry, Executive Director of ABC, has litigated class action child \nwelfare reform cases alleging system-wide deficiencies for over forty years; Disability Rights of \nWest Virginia has extensive experience and expertise representing individuals with disabilities \npursuant to the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act; and Shaffer and \nShaffer is a full-service West Virginia law firm with extensive experience in class action litigation \nand matters involving child abuse and neglect, the ADA, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct, as well as other complex litigation matters.260 Finally, in addition to knowledge of the \napplicable laws and the nuances of the claims raised thereunder, proposed class counsel have \nsufficient financial and human resources dedicated to litigating this matter.261  \nProposed class counsel also has the ability to represent the class fairly and adequately.

For the reasons \ndiscussed more fully below, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ Motions to Dismiss, (ECF Nos. 17, \n55, 88, 107, 167).    \nI.  BACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs filed this proposed class action on behalf of all children who are currently in or \nwill be placed in the custody of West Virginia’s foster care system.  (ECF No. 1 at 6, ¶ 10.)  The \nproposed class consists of one General Class and three subclasses.    The proposed Kinship \nSubclass consists of children who are or will be placed in kinship placements.1  (Id. at 10–11, ¶ \n30(a)(i).)  The proposed ADA Subclass consists of children who have or will have physical, \nintellectual, cognitive, or mental health disabilities, and the proposed Aging Out Subclass consists \nof children aged 14 years and older who are eligible for transition planning but have not been \nprovided the necessary case management and services.  (Id. at 11, ¶ (30(a)(ii–iii).)   \nThe twelve named Plaintiffs are children in the custody of West Virginia’s Department of \nHealth and Human Resources (“DHHR”).  (Id. at 2, ¶ 1.)  Plaintiffs allege that West Virginia’s \nfoster care system has operated in a state of crisis for years and that the DHHR and the Bureau for \nChildren and Families (“BCF”) have failed to protect the children in their care.   (Id. ¶ 1.)  \n \n1 West Virginia law defines “kinship placement” as “the placement of the child with a relative of the child, as defined \nherein, or a placement of a child with a fictive kin, as defined herein.”  W. Va. Code § 49–1–206.  Further, “relative \nof the child” is defined as “an adult of at least 21 years of age who is related to the child, by blood or marriage, within \nat least three degrees” and “fictive kin” is defined as “an adult of at least 21 years of age, who is not a relative of the \nchild, as defined herein, but who has an established, substantial relationship with the child, including but not limited \nto, teachers, coaches, ministers, and parents, or family members of the child's friends.”  Id.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 258   Filed 07/28/21   Page 3 of 30 PageID #: 12224\nDefendants, all sued in their official capacities, are Governor Jim Justice, Cabinet Secretary of the \nWest  Virginia  DHHR  Bill  Crouch,  Deputy  Secretary  of  the  DHHR  Jeremiah  Samples, \nCommissioner  of  the  BCF  Linda  Watts,  and  the  West  Virginia  DHHR.    Plaintiffs  allege \nDefendants are aware of the following systematic deficiencies within West Virginia’s foster care \nsystem: a lack of foster care placements; an overwhelmed system that leads to inadequate, \ntemporary, and overcrowded foster home placements; an overreliance on institutional care for \nchildren; a failure to ensure placement stability; a failure to track foster children; a failure to \nemploy and retain a sufficient number of case workers; a failure to provide and develop services; \na failure to engage in permanency planning; and a failure to properly plan for the children’s future.  \n(Id. at 4–6, ¶ 9.)  Plaintiffs allege Defendants have failed to address these issues, which has caused \nfurther harm to the children in their care.  (Id. at 4, ¶ 9.)   \nPlaintiffs seek both declaratory and injunctive relief against Defendants for these alleged \nsystematic deficiencies.  Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief which would require Defendants to \nimplement the following reforms: \na. With regard to all children in the General Class:  \ni. Require DHHR to contract with an appropriate outside entity to  \ncomplete a needs assessment of the state’s provision of foster care \nplacement and services no later than six months after judgement, to \ndetermine the full range and number of appropriate foster care \nplacements  and  services  for  all  children  needing  foster  care \nplacement, including the development of a plan, with timetables, \nwithin which such placements and services shall be secured, and \nensure that DHHR shall comply with those timetables;   \n \nii. Require that DHHR ensure that all children who enter foster care \nplacement receive within 30 days of entering care a complete and \nthorough evaluation of the child’s needs, performed by a qualified \nindividual, including whether the child has any physical and/or \nmental  disabilities  sufficient  to  be  categorized  as  a  child  with \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 258   Filed 07/28/21   Page 4 of 30 PageID #: 12225\ndisabilities under the ADA and that the child be re-evaluated as the \nchild’s needs and the information available to DHHR change;  \n   \niii. Require that DHHR ensure that all children who enter foster care \nplacement receive within 60 days of entering care an adequate and \nindividualized written case plan for treatment, services, and supports \nto  address  the  child’s  identified  needs;  describe  a  plan  for  \nreunification with the child’s parents, for adoption, or for another \npermanent, family-like setting; describing any interim placements \nappropriate for the child while the child moves towards a permanent \nhome-like setting; and describing the steps needed to keep the child \nsafe during the child’s time in DHHR’s custody.   \n \niv. Require that DHHR ensure that all children whose case plan \nidentifies a need for services and/or treatment timely receive those \nservices and/or treatment;  \n \nv. Require that DHHR shall ensure that all children who are placed \nin foster care are placed in a safe home or facility and are adequately \nmonitored in accordance with federal standards;  \n \nvi. Require that DHHR shall hire, employ, and retain an adequate \nnumber of qualified and appropriately trained caseworkers, and \nensure that caseloads do not exceed 15 children per-worker for \nchildren in placement, with caseloads adjusted for caseworkers who \ncarry mixed caseloads including children not in foster care custody; \nand  \n \nvii. Require DHHR to develop an adequate statewide plan, to be \napproved  by  the  Monitor  referred  to  below,  for  recruiting  and \nretaining foster and adoptive homes, including recruitment goals \nand timetables for achieving those goals, with which DHHR shall \ncomply. \n \nb. For all children in the Kinship Subclass:  \n \ni.  Require  DHHR  to  develop  an  adequate  statewide  kinship \nplacement plan, to be approved by the Monitor referred to below, \nfor assessing, overseeing, and monitoring kinship homes, including \ntraining  requirements  and  regular  caseworker  contact,  and \ntimetables  for  achieving  those  goals,  with  which  DHHR  shall \ncomply;  \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 258   Filed 07/28/21   Page 5 of 30 PageID #: 12226\nii.  Require  that  DHHR  shall  ensure  caseworkers  conduct \nbackground  and  safety  assessments  of  kinship  placements  as \nrequired by reasonable professional standards;  \n \niii. Require that DHHR shall ensure that kinship placements receive  \nfoster  parent  training  as  required  by  reasonable  professional \nstandards;  \n \niv. Require that DHHR shall ensure that all children in kinship \nplacements shall receive foster care services to meet the child’s \nneeds, including, in as many instances as is required by reasonable \nprofessional standards, supportive services; and  \n \nv. Require that DHHR shall ensure all children who are placed in  \nkinship placement receive permanency planning as required by  \nreasonable professional standards.  \n \nc. For all children in the ADA Subclass:  \n \ni. Require that DHHR shall ensure that all children with physical,\n  mental, intellectual, or cognitive disabilities shall receive foster care  \nservices in the most integrated setting appropriate to the child’s  \nneeds, including, in as many instances as is required by reasonable  \nprofessional  standards,  family  foster  homes  with  supportive \nservices;  \n \nii. Require that DHHR ensure that an adequate array of community \nbased therapeutic services are available to children with disabilities;  \nand  \n \niii. Require that DHHR ensure that it develop an adequate array of  \ncommunity-based therapeutic foster homes and therapeutic  \nplacements to meet the needs of children with disabilities.  \n \nd. For all children in the Aging Out Subclass:  \n \ni. Require that DHHR, when a child turns 14 years old while in its  \ncustody and is not imminently likely to be reunified with family,  \nadopted, or otherwise placed in a permanent family-like setting,  \nshall engage in transition planning to meet the health care,  \neducational, employment, housing, and other social needs of the  \nchildren in transitioning to adulthood;  \n \nii. Require that DHHR shall ensure youth be placed in the least \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 258   Filed 07/28/21   Page 6 of 30 PageID #: 12227\nrestrictive, most-family like setting possible with appropriate,  \nnecessary and individualized services; and  \n \niii. Prohibit DHHR from refusing to place a young person in a foster  \ncare placement because the child is 14 or older.  \n \n(Id. at 100–105, ¶ 405.)  Plaintiffs also ask this Court to appoint a neutral monitor to oversee \nimplementation of and compliance with these reforms.  (Id. ¶ 406.)   \nA.  Individual Allegations  \nNamed Plaintiffs Chris K., Calvin K., and Carolina K. are siblings under the age of six.  \n(ECF No. 56 at 2.)  When the Complaint was filed, the siblings were living with foster parents \nwho were in the process of adopting them.  (Id.)  On December 10, 2019, during the pendency \nof this case, Chris, Calvin, and Carolina were adopted.  (Id.)  Plaintiffs do not dispute that this \nfact.  (ECF No. 61 at 3.)  As a result of their adoption, these children are no longer in the custody \nof the DHHR and are instead in the legal custody of their adoptive parents.  (ECF No. 56 at 2.)   \nAdditionally, named Plaintiff Serena S., a twelve-year-old girl with Down Syndrome and \na congenital heart defect, was placed with a family that notified the DHHR during the pendency \nof this case that they wanted to adopt her.  (ECF No. 172 at 3.)  On September 3, 2020, Serena \nS. was adopted and is also no longer in the custody of the DHHR.  (ECF No. 168 at 1.)  This \nadoption also occurred during the pendency of this case, and Plaintiffs, again, do not dispute this \nfact.  (ECF No. 173 at 2.)     \n  Next, Defendants allege that named Plaintiffs Garrett M. and Gretchen C. are also no longer \nin the custody of the DHHR.  Both Garrett and Gretchen were involved in juvenile delinquency \nproceedings, and the circumstances surrounding their involvement with the DHHR is slightly \ndifferent than the other Plaintiffs.  West Virginia law authorizes the DHHR to “accept children \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 258   Filed 07/28/21   Page 7 of 30 PageID #: 12228\nfor care from their parent or parents, guardian, custodian or relatives and to accept the custody of \nchildren committed to its care by courts.”  W. Va. Code § 49–2–101(a).  Children typically enter \nDHHR  custody  through  either  abuse  and  neglect  petitions  or  in  connection  with  juvenile \ndelinquency proceedings or juvenile status offense proceedings.  See W. Va. Code § 49–4–601; \nW. Va. Code § 49–4–701(e).  West Virginia law allows its circuit courts to place these juvenile \noffenders in DHHR custody as an alternative to placement in a Bureau of Juvenile Services \n(“BJS”) secure detention facility.  W. Va. Code § 49–2–901.  Further, some children may come \ninto DHHR custody through an abuse and neglect proceeding and may also be the subject of a \njuvenile delinquency or juvenile status offense proceeding.  (ECF No. 109–1 at 4.)      \nThe parties dispute whether named Plaintiff Garrett M. was in the custody of the DHHR at \nthe time the Complaint was filed.  The parties agree that Garrett originally came into the legal and \nphysical custody of the DHHR in 2013 in connection with an abuse and neglect case.  (ECF No. \n97 at 3; ECF No. 98 at 4.)  In March of 2018, Plaintiffs argue that the BJS filed a delinquency \npetition against Garrett and that he was then undergoing both dependency and delinquency \nproceedings at the same time.  (ECF No. 98 at 4.)  Plaintiffs further argue that Garrett remained \nin the custody of the DHHR even after his parent’s parental rights were restored in 2018, and that \nGarrett was in the custody of the DHHR when the Complaint was filed.  (Id. at 5.)   \nOn the other hand, Defendants argue that the DHHR was no longer Garrett’s guardian after \nhis parental rights were restored, which occurred well over one year before the Complaint was \nfiled.  (ECF No. 97 at 5.)  Defendants argue Garrett was solely in the custody of the BJS at the \ntime the Complaint was filed and that he resided at a juvenile detention facility as a result of a \njuvenile delinquency adjudication.  (ECF No. 97 at 2.)  Defendants argue that Garrett was in the \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 258   Filed 07/28/21   Page 8 of 30 PageID #: 12229\ncustody of the BJS from June of 2019, until his release in December of 2019.  (Id. at 3.)  \nHowever, the parties agree that Garrett left the custody of the DHHR during the pendency of this \ncase because he turned 18 years of age.  (ECF No. 97 at 3; ECF No. 98 at 1.)     \nNamed Plaintiff Gretchen C. was never removed from her family as a result of abuse and \nneglect proceedings but was placed in an institution solely as a result of an adjudicated delinquency \nproceeding for a violent offense.  (ECF No. 109–1 at 2.)  The Complaint states that Gretchen \nentered foster care as a result of abuse and neglect proceedings, but Plaintiffs admit that the \nComplaint is incorrect.  (ECF No. 116 at 2.)  Further, Gretchen was released to the custody of a \nfamily member in December of 2019 and is no longer in the custody of the DHHR or the BJS.  \n(ECF No. 109–1 at 14.)  Plaintiffs acknowledge that Gretchen was released from DHHR custody \nand is no longer in its care.  (ECF No. 116 at 9.)        \nOn November 26, 2019, Defendants filed their first Motion to Dismiss.  (ECF No. 17.)  \nPlaintiffs timely responded, (ECF No. 29), and Defendants timely replied, (ECF No. 35).  Further, \non January 29, 2020, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ Motion for Leave to file Sur–Reply in Response \nto Defendants’ Reply.  (ECF Nos. 51, 52.)  Next, on February 7, 2020, Defendants filed their \nsecond Motion to Dismiss.  (ECF No. 55.)  Plaintiffs timely responded, (ECF No. 61), and \nDefendants timely replied, (ECF No. 65).  On June 4, 2020, Defendants filed their third Motion \nto Dismiss.  (ECF No. 88.)  Plaintiffs timely responded, (ECF No. 98), and Defendants timely \nreplied, (ECF No. 103).  On July 31, 2020, Defendants filed their fourth Motion to Dismiss.  \n(ECF No. 107.)  Plaintiffs timely responded, (ECF No. 116), and Defendants timely replied, (ECF \nNo. 129).   Finally, on November 19, 2020, Defendants filed their fifth Motion to Dismiss.  (ECF \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 258   Filed 07/28/21   Page 9 of 30 PageID #: 12230\nNo. 167.)  Plaintiffs timely responded, (ECF No. 172), and Defendants timely replied, (ECF No. \n219).   As such, these motions are fully briefed and ripe for adjudication.     \nII.  DISCUSSION \n \nPlaintiffs’  Class  Action  Complaint  alleges  the  following  five  causes  of  action:  (1) \nviolations of substantive due process under the United States Constitution; (2) violations of the \nFirst, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; (3) violations of the \nAdoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980; (4) violations of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act; and (5) violations of the Rehabilitation Act.  (ECF No. 1.)  Defendants argue \nthis Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims and requested relief because they \nseek federal review and ongoing oversight over West Virginia state court decisions.2  (ECF No. \n18 at 12.)  Specifically, Defendants argue the principles of federalism and comity require this \nCourt to abstain from oversight of West Virginia’s child welfare system because its state courts \nhave exclusive and continuous jurisdiction over such determinations.  (Id. at 11.)  Additionally, \nDefendants challenge all five counts of the Complaint for failure to state a claim and argue that \nthe federal laws upon which Plaintiffs base their claims do not support the relief they seek.  (Id.)  \nDefendants also allege that named Plaintiffs Chris K., Calvin K., Carolina K., Garrett M., Gretchen \nC., and Serena S. are no longer in DHHR custody, are no longer in the putative class, and that their \nclaims are now moot.   \n \n2 Despite Defendants’ arguments to the contrary, the Court’s decision to abstain under the Younger abstention doctrine \nis not based on a finding that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this case.  See Nivens v. Gilchrist, 444 F.3d 237, \n247 n.7 (4th Cir. 2006).  Younger abstention “does not arise from lack of jurisdiction in the District Court, but from \nstrong policies counseling against the exercise of such jurisdiction where particular kinds of state proceedings have \nalready been commenced.”  Ohio Civil Rights Comm'n v. Dayton Christian Sch., Inc., 477 U.S. 619, 626 (1986). \n \n   \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 258   Filed 07/28/21   Page 10 of 30 PageID #: 12231\nFirst,  the  Court  must  address  the  threshold  question  of  whether  the  six  challenged \nPlaintiffs’ claims present a justiciable claim or controversy.  Then, it will consider Defendants’ \narguments related to abstention.  Both questions must be decided before this Court can address \nthe merits of Plaintiffs’ claims.       \nA.  Mootness \nFirst, the Court will address Defendants’ motions to dismiss named Plaintiffs Chris K., \nCalvin K., Carolina K., Garrett M., Gretchen C., and Serena S.  (ECF Nos. 55, 88, 107, 167.)    \nArticle III of the United States Constitution limits a federal courts’ jurisdiction to cases and \ncontroversies.  U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl.1.  “The doctrine of mootness originates in Article III's \n‘case’ or ‘controversy’ language.”  Incumaa v. Ozmint, 507 F.3d 281, 286 (4th Cir. 2007) (quoting \nDaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 352 (2006)) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \n“Simply stated, a case is moot when the issues presented are no longer ‘live’ or the parties lack a \nlegally cognizable interest in the out-come.”  Incumaa, 507 F.3d at 286 (quoting Powell v. \nMcCormack, 395 U.S. 486, 496 (1969)).  Further, “even if a plaintiff has standing when he or she \nfiles a complaint, subsequent events can moot the claim.”  Pashby v. Delia, 709 F.3d 307, 316 \n(4th Cir. 2013).  Thus, “[t]o remain a justiciable controversy, a suit must remain alive throughout \nthe course of litigation, to the moment of final appellate disposition.”  Catawba Riverkeeper \nFound. v. N. Carolina Dep't of Transportation, 843 F.3d 583, 588 (4th Cir. 2016) (quoting \nBahnmiller v. Derwinski, 923 F.2d 1085, 1088 (4th Cir. 1991) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \n“A case that becomes moot at any point during the proceedings is ‘no longer a “Case” or \n“Controversy” for purposes of Article III,’ and is outside the jurisdiction of the federal courts.”  \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 258   Filed 07/28/21   Page 11 of 30 PageID #: 12232\nUnited States v. Sanchez-Gomez, 138 S. Ct. 1532, 1537 (2018) (quoting Already, LLC v. Nike, \nInc., 568 U.S. 85, 91 (2013)). \n  Plaintiffs Chris K., Calvin K., Carolina K., and Serena S. were adopted during the pendency \nof this litigation.  (ECF No. 56 at 2; ECF No. 61 at 3.)  In addition, Plaintiff Garrett M. reached \nthe age of eighteen during the pendency of this case and is also no longer in the custody of the \nDHHR.  (ECF No. 97 at 3; ECF No. 98 at 1.)  Finally, Gretchen C. completed her juvenile \ndelinquency rehabilitation and is also no longer in the custody of the DHHR.  (ECF No. 109–1 at \n14; ECF No. 116 at 9.)  There is no dispute that these six Plaintiffs are no longer in the custody \nof the DHHR or in the foster care system.  \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint seeks injunctive and declaratory relief against Defendants to prevent \nfuture harm to the children in their custody due to an alleged deficient child welfare system.  \nBecause these Plaintiffs have all left Defendants’ legal or physical custody, they can neither be \nfurther harmed by Defendants alleged illegal practices nor do they have a current claim for \ninjunctive relief against Defendants arising from the operation of its child welfare system.  With \nregard to these six Plaintiffs, they now “lack a legally cognizable interest in the out-come” of this \ncase and no live controversy exists between the parties.  Incumaa, 507 F.3d at 286.  Courts \nconsidering similar system wide challenges to a state’s foster care system have held the same.  \nSee, e.g., 31 Foster Children v. Bush, 329 F.3d 1255, 1263 (11th Cir. 2003) (dismissing adopted \nplaintiffs’ claims as moot because “they are no longer in the defendants' legal or physical custody \nand therefore cannot be further harmed by the defendants' alleged illegal practices”); J.B. ex rel. \nHart v. Valdez, 186 F.3d 1280, 1290 (10th Cir. 1999) (dismissing plaintiffs “because they have \nreached the age of majority or otherwise fallen outside of state custody and their claims are now \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 258   Filed 07/28/21   Page 12 of 30 PageID #: 12233\nmoot”); Carson P. ex rel. Foreman v. Heineman, 240 F.R.D. 456, 510–11 (D. Neb. 2007) \n(dismissing  plaintiffs’  claims  as  moot  because  they  aged  out  of  the  foster  care  system).  \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs Chris K., Calvin K., Carolina K., Garrett M., Gretchen C., and Serena S. \nhave no legally cognizable interest in the outcome of this litigation and their claims are moot.   \na.  Wrongs Capable of Repetition Yet Evading Review  \nPlaintiffs argue that the claims brought by all six of these Plaintiffs fall within the \n“exception to the mootness doctrine for a controversy that is capable of repetition, yet evading \nreview.”3   Kingdomware Technologies, Inc. v. United States, 136 S.Ct. 1969, 1976 (2016) \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  This doctrine has been applied where “the apparent absence \nof a live dispute is merely a temporary abeyance of a harm that is capable of repetition, yet evading \nreview.”  Brooks v. Vassar, 462 F.3d 341, 348 (4th Cir. 2006) (internal quotations omitted).  “A \ndispute qualifies for that exception only if (1) the challenged action is in its duration too short to \nbe fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration, and (2) there is a reasonable expectation that \nthe same complaining party will be subjected to the same action again.”  Sanchez–Gomez, 138 S. \nCt. at 1540 (internal quotations omitted).  The second prong of this test requires “a reasonable \nexpectation or a demonstrated probability that the same controversy will recur involving the same \n \n3 Plaintiffs’ briefing demonstrates a lack of understanding between the very different standards for the “capable of \nrepetition yet evading review” and “voluntary cessation” mootness exceptions.  Plaintiffs rely on a quote from Am. \nCivil Liberties Union of Massachusetts v. Sebelius, 821 F. Supp. 2d 474, 481 (D. Mass. 2012), a decision vacated by \nthe First Circuit Court of Appeals, to argue that Defendants bear a heavy burden here.  (ECF No. 61 at 5.)  Plaintiffs \nfurther argue that it is “predictable” that children will be discharged from the foster care system over the course of this \nlitigation because Defendants control this process and it is in Defendants’ “best interest to pick off named plaintiffs \nwith the goal of dismissing the entire case as moot.”  (Id. at 7.)  In this regard, Plaintiffs’ argument invokes the \nvoluntary cessation exception.  In these types of cases, a defendant voluntarily ceases the alleged improper behavior \nbut is free to return to it at any time.  See, e.g., United States v. W.T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629 (1953).  Here, Plaintiffs’ \ninsinuation that Defendants are removing children from their care simply to get this case dismissed is absurd and \ncontrary to the undisputed facts.  The Plaintiffs’ adoption date, birth date, and completion date for rehabilitation were \nwell known before this case was filed and are beyond the manipulation of Defendants.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ \nvoluntary cessation exception arguments are easily rejected.            \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 258   Filed 07/28/21   Page 13 of 30 PageID #: 12234\ncomplaining party.”  Fed. Election Comm'n v. Wisconsin Right To Life, Inc., 551 U.S. 449, 463 \n(2007) (internal quotations omitted).  Supreme Court precedent holds that “the same controversy \n[is] sufficiently likely to recur when a party has a reasonable expectation that it ‘will again be \nsubjected to the alleged illegality,’ or ‘will be subject to the threat of prosecution’ under the \nchallenged law.’”    Id. (internal citations omitted).    Finally, this exception applies “only in \nexceptional situations.”  Kingdomware, 136 S.Ct. at 1976.   \nThe parties dispute both prongs of this test.  First, Plaintiffs argue “that foster care is \nintended to be a short–term, temporary stay for children.”  (ECF No. 61 at 7.)  However, as \nDefendants argue, this argument is in direct conflict with Plaintiffs’ continuing arguments that \nchildren in West Virginia’s foster care system “languish” for years.  (ECF No. 1 at 79, ¶ 328; ECF \nNo. 29 at 1.)  Further, the allegations contained within the Complaint itself contradict Plaintiffs’ \nargument.  For example, Plaintiffs allege that named Plaintiff Johnathan R. has spent the last \nseven years in institutional care and describes alleged failures in his case that go back to 2013.  \n(ECF No. 1 at 16 ¶¶ 42, 45.)  Next, Plaintiffs allege that Gretchen C. has been in the custody of \nthe DHHR since April of 2015, which means she was in custody for over four years before she \nwas placed in the custody of her grandmother.  (Id. at 32, ¶ 121.)  Plaintiffs also allege that named \nPlaintiff Dennis C. has been in DHHR custody for over five years, (ECF No. 1 at 35, ¶ 137), that \nnamed Plaintiffs Karter W. and Ace L. have both been in DHHR custody since 2016, (Id. at 41, \n45 ¶ 164, 183), and that Garrett M. has been in custody since 2012, (Id. at 27, ¶ 102.)  In fact, the \nmajority of the named Plaintiffs have been in DHHR custody for significant periods of time which \nundermines Plaintiffs’ argument that the children’s time in DHHR custody is too short to allow \nthis action to be fully litigated.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 258   Filed 07/28/21   Page 14 of 30 PageID #: 12235\n Next, Plaintiffs argue that Chris K., Calvin K., Carolina K., Serena S., and Gretchen C. \nall face “some likelihood of reentering the West Virginia foster care system in the future.”  (See, \ne.g., ECF No. 61 at 6.)  Again, this argument is contradicted by the facts of this case.  Chris K., \nCalvin K., and Carolina K were legally adopted on December 10, 2019, Serena S. was legally \nadopted on September 3, 2020, and Gretchen C. was placed in the custody of her grandmother in \nDecember of 2019.  None of these Plaintiffs returned to the custody of the DHHR or the BJS, \nwhich does not support a conclusion that there is a “reasonable expectation” that these six Plaintiffs \n“will be subjected to the same action again.”  Plaintiffs have presented no other evidence to allow \nthis Court to conclude that there is “a reasonable expectation or a demonstrated probability” that \nthese children will return to West Virginia’s foster care system and be subject to harm.        \nFinally, Garrett M. has reached the age of majority and is not now and can never again be \nin the custody of the DHHR or involved in West Virginia’s foster care system.  Garrett M. has \nneither a current nor future claim for relief against Defendants arising from its deficient child \nwelfare system.  Thus, there is no “reasonable expectation” that he will again be subjected to the \nactions that lead to this Complaint.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs have failed to carry their burden and \nhave not presented evidence to allow this Court to conclude that these six Plaintiffs’ claims fit \nwithin the definition of claims that are capable of repetition, yet evading review. \nb.  Class Action Context  \nNext, Plaintiffs argue that these six Plaintiffs’ claims are “inherently transitory” and that \nthis Court should still retain jurisdiction over these claims and allow these Plaintiffs to assert \nclaims on behalf of the putative class members.  (See, e.g., ECF No. 172 at 8.)  Generally, in the \nclass action context, a named plaintiff’s claims must be dismissed if the claim becomes moot prior \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 258   Filed 07/28/21   Page 15 of 30 PageID #: 12236\nto the certification of the class.    See,  e.g., Sanchez-Gomez, 138 S.  Ct. 1532, 1538 (2018) \n(“Normally a class action would be moot if no named class representative with an unexpired claim \nremained at the time of class certification.”).  However, the United States Supreme Court has \ncarved out an exception to this mootness doctrine in particular types of class actions and has held \nthat the mootness of a named plaintiff’s claim after the class action has been properly certified \ndoes not render the action moot.  See Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393 (1975).  The Supreme Court \nhas made clear that it has “never adopted a flat rule” that certification of the class alone is sufficient \nto allow a court to determine the merits of a case once the claims of the named parties are moot.  \nKremens v. Bartley, 431 U.S. 119, 130 (1977).  This exception is not applicable here because this \nCourt has not yet considered Plaintiffs’ pending motion for class certification and no class \ncurrently exists.  \nPlaintiffs’ argument here relies on a separate but related line of cases established in actions \nlike here, where the claims of named plaintiffs are mooted prior to the certification.  In Sosna, the \nSupreme Court  \nsuggested that, where a named plaintiff's individual claim becomes moot before the \ndistrict court has an opportunity to rule on the certification motion, and the issue \nwould otherwise evade review, the certification might “relate back” to the filing of \nthe complaint.  The Court has since held that the relation-back doctrine may apply \nin Rule 23 cases where it is “certain that other persons similarly situated” will \ncontinue to be subject to the challenged conduct and the claims raised are “‘so \ninherently transitory that the trial court will not have even enough time to rule on a \nmotion  for  class  certification  before  the  proposed  representative's  individual \ninterest expires.’” \n \nGenesis Healthcare Corp. v. Symczyk, 569 U.S. 66, 75–76 (2013).  “The ‘inherently transitory’ \nrationale was developed to address circumstances in which the challenged conduct was effectively \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 258   Filed 07/28/21   Page 16 of 30 PageID #: 12237\nunreviewable, because no plaintiff possessed a personal stake in the suit long enough for litigation \nto run its course.”  Genesis Healthcare Corp., 569 U.S. at 76.   \nAs discussed above in relation to Plaintiffs’ “capable of repetition yet evading review” \nargument, Plaintiffs have failed to show that these children have been moved so quickly in and out \nof DHHR custody that their claims are effectively unreviewable.  In fact, the facts alleged in the \nComplaint are likewise contrary to Plaintiffs’ arguments here.  Further, unlike in the majority of \ncases that apply this narrow exception, the dismissal of these six named Plaintiffs is not a \ndispositive determination and this action is not being dismissed because of this determination.  In \nfact, six other named Plaintiffs remain and Plaintiffs have not argued that dismissal of Chris K., \nCalvin K., Carolina K., Garrett M., Gretchen C., and Serena S. would moot any of their claims.  \nThus, this exception is inapplicable here.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs Chris K., Calvin K., Carolina \nK., Garrett M., Gretchen C., and Serena S. have no legally cognizable interest in the outcome of \nthis litigation, and they are DISMISSED as parties to this action.    \nB.  Younger Abstention  \n Next, Defendants argue that abstention is appropriate under Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. \n37 (1971).    The Supreme Court has stated that federal courts have a “virtually unflagging \nobligation . . . to exercise the jurisdiction given them.”  Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. \nv. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 817 (1976).  Quite simply, “federal courts lack the authority to \nabstain from the exercise of jurisdiction that has been conferred.”  New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc. \nv. Council of City of New Orleans, 491 U.S. 350, 358 (1989).  There are, however, circumstances \nunder  which  a  federal  court  must  withhold  relief  to  prevent  interference  with  state  court \nproceedings.  Id. at 359.  The Supreme Court has cautioned that these exceptions are “carefully \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 258   Filed 07/28/21   Page 17 of 30 PageID #: 12238\ndefined” and “remain the exception, not the rule.”  Id. (internal quotations omitted) (citing Hawaii \nHousing Authority v. Midkiff, 467 U.S. 229, 236 (1984)).   \nIn Younger and its progeny, the Supreme Court has reiterated “a strong federal policy \nagainst federal-court interference with pending state judicial proceedings absent extraordinary \ncircumstances.”  Middlesex Cty. Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar Ass'n, 457 U.S. 423, 431 \n(1982).  The reason for restraining federal courts from exercising jurisdiction in these types of \nactions is the notion of “comity,” which includes  \na proper respect for state functions, a recognition of the fact that the entire country \nis made up of a Union of separate state governments, and a continuance of the belief \nthat the National Government will fare best if the States and their institutions are \nleft free to perform their separate functions in their separate ways. \n \nYounger, 401 U.S. at 44.  “The [Younger abstention] doctrine recognizes that state courts are fully \ncompetent to decide issues of federal law and has as a corollary the idea that all state and federal \nclaims should be presented to the state courts.”  Richmond, Fredericksburg & Potomac R.R. Co. \nv. Forst, 4 F.3d 244, 251 (4th Cir. 1993).   \nAlthough Younger involved state criminal proceedings, the Supreme Court has expanded \nits application to “noncriminal judicial proceedings when important state interests are involved.”  \nMiddlesex, 457 U.S. at 432.  “Where vital state interests are involved, a federal court should \nabstain unless state law clearly bars the interposition of the constitutional claims.”  Id. (internal \nquotations omitted) (quoting Moore v. Sims, 442 U.S. 415, 426 (1979)).  In Middlesex, the \nSupreme Court articulated the following three–part test: “first, do [these proceedings] constitute \nan  ongoing  state  judicial  proceeding;  second,  do  the  proceedings  implicate  important  state \ninterests; and third, is there an adequate opportunity in the state proceedings to raise constitutional \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 258   Filed 07/28/21   Page 18 of 30 PageID #: 12239\nchallenges.”    Id.  at 432; see also Martin Marietta Corp. v. Maryland Comm'n on Human \nRelations, 38 F.3d 1392, 1396 (4th Cir. 1994).      \nYounger abstention applies only to “three exceptional categories” of cases: (1) “parallel, \npending state criminal proceeding[s]”; (2) “state civil proceedings that are akin to criminal \nprosecutions”; and (3) “civil proceedings involving certain orders . . . uniquely in furtherance of \nthe state courts' ability to perform their judicial functions.”  Sprint Commc'ns, Inc. v. Jacobs, 571 \nU.S. 69, 78 (2013).  These three categories of cases define the scope of Younger.  Id. at 82. \nThe ongoing state court proceeding must be “the type of proceeding to which Younger \napplies.”  New Orleans Public Serv., Inc. v. Council of City of New Orleans, 491 U.S. 350, 367 \n(1989).   Plaintiffs argue that this case does not fit within any of these exceptional circumstances.  \n(ECF No. 29 at 13.)  However, this argument is easily dismissed.  This case is perhaps best \nclassified as a hybrid of both the second and third categories of cases.  Not only does this action \ninvolve state-initiated abuse and neglect proceedings like in Moore v. Sims, 442 U.S. 415 (1979), \nbut Plaintiffs are also asking this Court to issue an injunction “aimed at controlling or preventing \nthe occurrence of specific events that might take place in the course of future state” abuse and \nneglect proceedings, like in O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 500 (1974).   \n  After a petition is filed, the state of West Virginia initiates the abuse and neglect \nproceeding and is a party throughout the case.  W. Va. Code § 49–4–501 (“The prosecuting \nattorney shall render to the Department of Health and Human Resources . . . the legal services as \nthe department may require.”).   The Supreme Court has held that the principles of Younger and \nHuffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U.S. 592 (1975) apply to civil proceedings where the state is a party.  \nTrainor  v.  Hernandez,  431  U.S.  434,  444  (1977).    Further,  in  Moore  v.  Sims,  the  Texas \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 258   Filed 07/28/21   Page 19 of 30 PageID #: 12240\nDepartment of Human Resources removed children from their parents, who were suspected of \nchild abuse, and the state then initiated child abuse proceedings.  442 U.S. at 418.  The parents \nfiled suit in federal court challenging the constitutionality of Texas’ laws relating to the authority \nof the Department of Human Resources to protect children.  Id.  The Supreme Court held that \nYounger applied and stated that Texas “was a party to the state proceedings, and the temporary \nremoval of a child in a child-abuse context is, like the public nuisance statute involved in Huffman, \n‘in aid of and closely related to criminal statutes.’”  Id. at 423.  The Court further held that “[t]he \nexistence of these conditions, or the presence of such other vital concerns as enforcement of \ncontempt proceedings or the vindication of ‘important state policies such as safeguarding the fiscal \nintegrity  of  [public  assistance]  programs’  determines  the  applicability  of  Younger-Huffman \nprinciples as a bar to the institution of a later federal action.”  Id.   \nIn addition, in O'Shea, the proposed class of plaintiffs filed a lawsuit alleging that a state \nmunicipal court system intentionally discriminated against black citizens in various patterns and \npractices in its criminal justice system.    414 U.S. at 490.    The Supreme Court ultimately \ndismissed the case due to ripeness but suggested that the principles of Younger should be applied \nto prevent federal court review.  Id. at 498–499.  The plaintiffs sought to challenge criminal \nprosecutions “brought under seemingly valid state laws” and, in essence, sought an order that \n“would contemplate interruption of state proceedings to adjudicate assertions of noncompliance” \nby the defendants.”  Id. at 500.  The Court held that such a system seemed to be “nothing less \nthan an ongoing federal audit of state criminal proceedings which would indirectly accomplish the \nkind of interference that Younger v. Harris, supra, and related cases sought to prevent.”  Id.   \nThus, the proposed relief contemplated in O’Shea appears quite similar to Plaintiffs’ request here.   \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 258   Filed 07/28/21   Page 20 of 30 PageID #: 12241\nFurther, other courts have similarly held that Younger applies to system–wide challenges to a \nstate’s foster care system.  See, e.g., 31 Foster Children v. Bush, 329 F.3d 1255, 1260 (11th Cir. \n2003); J.B. ex rel. Hart v. Valdez, 186 F.3d 1280, 1291 (10th Cir. 1999).  Accordingly, Younger \nhas been found to apply to “exceptional categories” of cases which present factual issues very \nsimilar to the case at hand.    \na.  First Middlesex Factor  \nThis Court must first determine whether there is an ongoing state court proceeding and \nwhether Plaintiffs’ required relief would interfere with those proceedings.  Some courts have \nrequired an additional finding be made before the three–part test established in Middlesex can be \napplied. 4  Specifically, these courts require a determination that the federal relief sought would \ninterfere directly with state court litigation.  Here, Plaintiffs have not acknowledged that the \nremaining Plaintiffs, as children in the custody of West Virginia, are currently, or were, subject to \nabuse and neglect proceedings or other ongoing proceedings before West Virginia’s Circuit \nCourts.  However, the factual allegations contained in the Complaint allow this Court to infer as \nmuch.5  Further, these ongoing state court abuse and neglect proceedings involving each of the \n \n4 In 31 Foster Children, the Eleventh Circuit joined its “sister circuits in explicitly stating that an essential part of the \nfirst Middlesex factor in Younger abstention analysis is whether the federal proceeding will interfere with an ongoing \nstate court proceeding.”  329 F.3d at 1276.  While the Fourth Circuit has not expressly held that the first Middlesex \nfactor requires such interference with the state court proceeding, it seems to have implicitly assumed as much.  See, \ne.g., Beam v. Tatum, 299 F. App'x 243, 246 (4th Cir. 2008) (“We consider first whether there is an ongoing state \nproceeding.”); Norfolk S. Ry. Co. v. McGraw, 71 F. App'x 967, 970 (4th Cir. 2003) (same).  Further, the majority of \ncircuits which have considered this issue have required the same.  See 31 Foster Children, 329 F.3d at 1276; Green \nv. City of Tucson, 255 F.3d 1086, 1097 (9th Cir. 2001) (en banc); J.B., 186 F.3d at 1291; FOCUS v. Allegheny County \nCourt of Common Pleas, 75 F.3d 834, 843 (3d Cir. 1996). \n5 The Court has dismissed the six named Plaintiffs who are no longer in the custody of the DHHR.  (See Section \nIII.A.)  Further, Plaintiffs do not argue that any of the remaining named children are not involved with West Virginia’s \nstate courts such that decisions about their welfare would not be subject to review by these courts.  For some named \nPlaintiffs, the Complaint alleges they were subject to abuse and neglect proceedings or that their parents had their \nparental rights terminated.  For the others, sufficient information is not provided, and Plaintiffs have failed to present \nany evidence or arguments to the contrary.  \n  In addition, the Court has also dismissed Gretchen C., who appears to be the only named plaintiff who was \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 258   Filed 07/28/21   Page 21 of 30 PageID #: 12242\nplaintiffs are ongoing proceedings for the purposes of the Middlesex analysis.  See J.B. ex rel. \nHart v. Valdez, 186 F.3d 1280, 1291 (10th Cir. 1999) (holding that continuing jurisdiction of \njuvenile court and six-month periodic review hearings constituted an ongoing state judicial \nproceeding); see also 31 Foster Children v. Bush, 329 F.3d 1255, 1275 (11th Cir. 2003).  Once \nan abuse and neglect petition is filed, that child remains subject to the continuing jurisdiction of \nthe state circuit courts until they reach eighteen years of age or find a permanent placement.  W. \nVa. Code § 49–4–608.  Further, the state is required by law to hold mandatory, periodic review \nof these cases.  Id.  Thus, these proceedings constitute ongoing judicial proceedings for the \npurposes of Younger.      \nNext, this Court must determine whether the relief sought here would result in interference \nwith ongoing state proceedings.  This inquiry depends on the way in which West Virginia’s \nCircuit  Courts  oversee  these  cases.    According  to  the  factual  allegations  contained  in  the \nComplaint, all the remaining named Plaintiffs were the subject of either abuse and neglect \nproceedings or their parents had their parental rights terminated, which would have put them under \njurisdiction of West Virginia’s Circuit Courts.  (ECF No. 1 at 15–48, ¶¶ 42–198.)  Thus, each of \n \nin the custody of the DHHR as a result of a juvenile delinquency proceeding and not an abuse and neglect proceeding.  \nPlaintiffs admit that the Complaint misstates that Gretchen C. entered foster care as a result of an abuse and neglect \nproceeding.  (ECF No. 116 at 2.)  In fact, Gretchen C. was never removed from her family as a result of an abuse \nand neglect proceeding but was in DHHR custody solely as a result of a juvenile delinquency petition.  (ECF No. 121 \nat 7.)  Further, the parties dispute whether juvenile justice youth who came into DHHR custody through juvenile \ndelinquency or juvenile stats offenses should be considered within the proposed class definition.  (ECF No. 121.)  \nThe Court does not consider the merits of this issue.  However, Plaintiffs do not argue that any of the remaining \nnamed children are in the custody of the DHHR solely because of a juvenile delinquency or juvenile status offense \nproceeding.  For some named Plaintiffs, the Complaint alleges they were subject to juvenile delinquency proceedings \nbut also alleges that they suffered some type of abuse.  Sufficient information is not provided to determine if these \nremaining children are in DHHR custody solely the result of a juvenile delinquency proceeding, and Plaintiffs have \nfailed to present any evidence or arguments to the contrary.  Accordingly, the Court focuses its analysis here on West \nVirginia’s abuse and neglect proceedings system.    \n \n \n \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 258   Filed 07/28/21   Page 22 of 30 PageID #: 12243\nthe named Plaintiffs and every child adjudicated under the West Virginia Child Welfare Act are \nsubject to the continuing jurisdiction of West Virginia’s Circuit Courts.  See W. Va. Code § 49–\n1–101. \nWest  Virginia’s  Circuit  Courts  play  an  important  role  in  child  abuse  and  neglect \nproceedings from the outset of the child’s case.  After a petition is filed, the state court will issue \nan initial order either granting temporary custody of the child to the DHHR or not.  Id. § 49–4–\n602.  Depending on whether temporary custody is granted, the court is required to hold a \npreliminary hearing within a certain time period.  Id.  At the preliminary hearing, the court will \nreview the petition and take evidence regarding the status of the child; determine whether the \nDHHR has made reasonable efforts to preserve the family; and determine whether imminent \ndanger requires the removal of the child from the custody of the parents or whether emergency \ncustody should continue.  Id. § 49–4–105.  Next, the court is required to hold an adjudicatory \nhearing within a certain time, depending on what was ordered at the preliminary hearing.  Id. § \n49–4–601.  At the adjudicatory hearing, the court is required to determine whether the child has \nbeen abused and neglected.  Id. § 49–4–602.   \nNext,  a  disposition  hearing  must  occur  within  forty–five  days  of  the  entry  of  the \nadjudicatory order.  W. Va. R. Child and Abuse and Neglect Proceedings 32(a).   If the child is \nfound to be abused and neglected, the DHHR is required to provide the court with a copy of the \nchild’s case plan which includes the following: a permanency plan which documents efforts to \nensure that the child is returned home in the appropriate time or efforts to place the child for \nadoption or with a legal guardian and, if applicable, states why reunification is not possible and \ndetails the alternative permanent placement; a family case plan; a description of the type of home \n22 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 258   Filed 07/28/21   Page 23 of 30 PageID #: 12244\nor institution where the child will be placed, including a discussion of the appropriateness of that \nplacement and how the agency will ensure that the child receives proper care and services and \naccommodations as required under the Americans with Disabilities Act; “[a] plan to facilitate the \nreturn of the child to his or her own home or the concurrent permanent placement of the child”; \nand a plan to address the needs of the child while in kinship or foster care, which must include a \ndiscussion of the appropriateness of the services that have already been provided for that child.  \nW. Va. Code § 49–4–604(a)(1–2).  The state court is required to make findings of fact and \nconclusions of law, which includes, among others, dismissing the petition; returning the child to \nhis or her own home; referring the child and parent to a community agency for assistance; \ncommitting the child to the care of the DHHR, a private child welfare agency, or an appointed \nguardian; or terminating parental rights and permanently committing the child to the custody of \nthe non-abusing parent, the DHHR, or a child welfare agency.  Id. § 49–4–604(c)(1–6).   \nFinally, the state court will hold a permanency hearing where the court will determine the \npermanency plan and what efforts are being made to provide the child with a permanent home.  \nId. § 49–4–608.  “The court has exclusive jurisdiction to determine the permanent placement of a \nchild.”  W. Va. R. P. Child Abuse and Neglect Proceedings 36(e).  The court also makes the \ndetermination as to whether the DHHR is required to make reasonable efforts to preserve the \nfamily.  Id. § 49–4–608(a).  Further, the court is required to have a permanency hearing every 12 \nmonths until permanency is achieved.  Id. § 49–4–608(b).  The DHHR is required to file “a \nprogress report with the court detailing the efforts that have been made to place the child in a \npermanent home and copies of the child's case plan, including the permanency plan . . . .”  Id.  \nUnder the statute, the purpose of these hearings is to “review the child's case, to determine whether \n23 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 258   Filed 07/28/21   Page 24 of 30 PageID #: 12245\nand under what conditions the child's commitment to the department shall continue, to determine \nwhat efforts are necessary to provide the child with a permanent home, and to determine if the \ndepartment has made reasonable efforts to finalize the permanency plan.”  Id. \nIn addition, within thirty days of the original filing of the petition, the state court is required \nto convene a meeting of a multidisciplinary treatment team6 (“MDT”) and the MDT is required to \nsubmit written reports to the court and will meet with the court at least every three months until \npermanency is achieved and the child’s case is dismissed.  W. Va. Code §§ 49–4–405, 602.  Once \nthe court finds that a permanent placement has been achieved, the court may dismiss the case.  W. \nVa. R. P. Child Abuse and Neglect Proceedings 42(b).       \nWest Virginia Circuit Courts are required to make additional determinations.  They are \nresponsible for determining what services are needed to help children make the transition from \nfoster care to adulthood and independent living.  Id. § 49–4–608(c).  Further, “[a] court may not \norder a child to be placed in an out of state facility unless the child is diagnosed with a health issue \nthat no in-state facility or program serves, unless a placement out of state is in closer proximity to \nthe child's family for the necessary care, or the services are able to be provided more timely.”  Id. \n§ 49–4–608(d).  In addition, the DHHR is required to file a disclosure stating its determinations \nas to whether any relatives or family members are appropriate placement options for the child.  Id. \n§ 49–4–601a(4).  This document must be filed with the court within forty–five days of the filing \nof the petition.  Id.    \n \n6 The MDT is established by the prosecuting attorney of the county where the case is initiated and consists of the \nprosecuting attorney, a caseworker from the DHHR, a local law enforcement officer, a child advocacy center \nrepresentative, a health care provider, a mental health professional, an educator, and a representative from a licensed \ndomestic violence program.

Code § 49–4–402(a)(1–8).      \n24 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 258   Filed 07/28/21   Page 25 of 30 PageID #: 12246\nIt is clear that West Virginia’s state courts are heavily involved in abuse and neglect \nproceedings and are required to oversee and approve the majority of the determinations related to \nthe child’s care and placement.  A ruling favorable to Plaintiffs would interfere with and disrupt \nthese ongoing state court proceedings.  Plaintiffs’ request that this Court enjoin the executive \nDefendants  from  actions  that  West  Virginia’s  Circuit  Courts  are  currently  responsible  for \noverseeing and approving.  Specifically, Plaintiffs request oversight of needs assessments of \nfoster children; case plans; placement decisions; and plans for reunification.  Further, Plaintiffs \nrequest that this Court ensure children receive services and treatments; ensure that foster care \nplacements are safe or adequately monitored; oversee kinship placements; properly assess kinship \nplacements; ensure children and families in kinship placements receive services; ensure that \nkinship placements receive permanency planning; and ensure that disabled children receive \nservices.  (ECF No. 1 at 100–104, ¶¶ 405(a)(i)–(d)(iii)).  Plaintiffs further request that both this \nCourt and a neutral monitor oversee the implementation of these reforms.  (Id. at 104, ¶ 406.)  \nThus, this Court would be tasked with ensuring that West Virginia’s state courts comply with its \nmandate.  Such an order would essentially be taking decisions that are now in the hands of state \ncourts and placing them under the supervision of a federal district court.  Issuing Plaintiffs the \ndeclaratory  and  injunctive  relief  they  seek  would  undoubtedly  interfere  with  state  court \nproceedings.  There is a possibility that this Court and the state court could issue conflicting orders \nconcerning  which  placement  decision  or  which  services  were  best  for  a  child.    Such \ndeterminations are left to the state courts under West Virginia law, but this Court’s order would \nreassign these responsibilities, likely leading to confusing and conflicting results.   \n25 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 258   Filed 07/28/21   Page 26 of 30 PageID #: 12247\nPlaintiffs emphasize in their briefing that they are seeking relief from West Virginia’s \nexecutive agencies and the DHHR and any order entered by this Court would be enforced against \nthese Defendants.  (ECF No. 29 at 14.)  However, West Virginia law is clear that its state courts, \nnot the DHHR, have the ultimate decision-making authority over whether to approve the child’s \ncase plan and to ensure that that plan is followed.  W. Va. Code § 49–4–608.  Plaintiffs ask this \nCourt to permanently enjoin Defendants from a long list of practices that they argue violates their \nrights.  They further request that a neutral monitor be appointed to implement and oversee an \norder  issued  by  this  Court.    Removing  discretion  from  West  Virginia’s  state  courts  and \nimplementing federal court review over these decisions is highly problematic.  It makes no \ndifference that this case is directed at the state’s executive agencies because the practical effects \nin enforcing an order reforming West Virginia’s foster care system would undoubtedly impact the \nstate’s circuit courts.  Even though Plaintiffs have not framed their request as a direct review of \nstate court judgments, that would be the result.  As the Supreme Court articulated in O’Shea,  \n[t]he objection is to unwarranted anticipatory interference in the state . . . process \nby means of continuous or piecemeal interruptions of the state proceedings by \nlitigation in the federal courts; the object is to sustain “(t)he special delicacy of the \nadjustment  to  be  preserved  between  federal  equitable  power  and  State \nadministration of its own law.” \n \nO’Shea, 414 U.S. at 500 (quoting Stefanelli v. Minard, 342 U.S. 117, 120 (1951)).  The relief \nPlaintiffs seek would interfere extensively with ongoing state court proceedings for each of the \nnamed Plaintiffs. 7  Accordingly, the first Middlesex factor is satisfied.   \n \n7 The majority of Plaintiffs arguments in opposition demonstrate a misunderstanding of the Younger abstention \ndoctrine and its purpose as well as a misunderstanding of how abuse and neglect proceedings are conducted in the \nState of West Virginia.  Plaintiffs argue that “West Virginia circuit courts, like other state courts, review agency \nplacement decisions” and “the state circuit courts do not identify placements or place children in specific foster care \nsetting.”  (ECF No. 52 at 3.)  However, this argument is contradicted expressly by Rule 36 of West Virginia’s Rules \nof Procedure for Child Abuse and Neglect Proceedings.  W. Va. R. P. Child Abuse and Neglect Proceedings 36(e) \n26 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 258   Filed 07/28/21   Page 27 of 30 PageID #: 12248\nb.  Second Middlesex Factor  \nNext, the Court must determine if the ongoing state court proceedings implicate important \nstate interests.  Plaintiffs do not dispute that the state has an important interest in the care, \ndisposition, and welfare of the children in its custody.  While Plaintiffs do not address this factor \nin  their  arguments,  they  repeatedly  emphasized  the  importance  of  West  Virginia’s  role  in \nprotecting the children in its custody.  (ECF No. 1 at 2, ¶ 1.)  There can be little dispute that the \nprotection of abused and neglected children is a vital and important state interest.  Accordingly, \nthe second Middlesex factor is satisfied.   \nc.  Third Middlesex Factor  \nFinally, for abstention to be appropriate, Plaintiff must have an adequate opportunity to \nraise and litigate their constitutional claims in the state court proceedings.  Middlesex, 457 U.S. \nat 432.  “The question is whether that challenge can be raised in the pending state proceedings \nsubject to conventional limits on justiciability.”  Moore v. Sims, 442 U.S. at 425.  The plaintiff \nhas the burden to show “that state procedural law barred presentation of their claims.”  Id. at 432.     \nFurther, “when a litigant has not attempted to present his federal claims in related state–court \nproceedings, a federal court should assume that state procedures will afford an adequate remedy, \nin the absence of unambiguous authority to the contrary.”  Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., 481 U.S. \n1, 15 (1987).   \nIn the present case, Plaintiffs did not give West Virginia’s state courts an opportunity to \nconsider their constitutional claims, and they cannot demonstrate that West Virginia’s courts were \n \n(“The court has exclusive jurisdiction to determine the permanent placement of a child.”).  Further, Plaintiffs’ \narguments ignore the fact that West Virginia’s Circuit Courts are involved from the moment an abuse and neglect \npetition is filed and retain continuous jurisdiction over the case as it proceeds.   \n27 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 258   Filed 07/28/21   Page 28 of 30 PageID #: 12249\nunavailable.  Child abuse and neglect proceedings are handled by West Virginia’s Circuit Courts, \nwhich are trial courts of general jurisdiction.  See Syl. Pt. 2, State ex rel. Rose L. v. Pancake, 544 \nS.E.2d 403, 404 (W. Va. 2001) (“A circuit court has jurisdiction to entertain an abuse and neglect \npetition and to conduct proceedings in accordance therewith as provided by W. Va. Code § 49–6–\n1, et seq.”); see also State ex rel. Silver v. Wilkes, 584 S.E.2d 548, 552 (W. Va. 2003) (“Circuit \ncourts are courts of general jurisdiction and have power to determine all controversies that can \npossibly be made the subject of civil actions.”).  Plaintiffs argue that the West Virginia Supreme \nCourt of Appeals did not contemplate state circuit courts considering claims arising under federal \nlaw or the United States Constitution.  (ECF No. 52 at 8.)  This argument is completely baseless.  \nThe United States Supreme Court has been clear that “[m]inimal respect for the state processes . . \n. precludes any presumption that the state courts will not safeguard federal constitutional rights.”  \nMiddlesex, 457 U.S. at 431.  As courts of general jurisdiction, West Virginia’s Circuit Courts are \ncapable of hearing federal claims.  \nThe law is clear that Plaintiffs bear the burden here, and Plaintiffs have presented no \n“unambiguous authority to the contrary” to prove that West Virginia’s Circuit Courts lack the \njurisdiction or ability to adjudicate their federal statutory and constitutional claims during abuse \nand neglect proceedings.  In fact, this factor is what separates this case from other child welfare \nclass actions where Younger abstention was denied.  See, e.g., Connor B. ex rel. Vigurs v. Patrick, \n771 F. Supp. 2d 142, 158 (D. Mass. 2011); M.D. v. Perry, 799 F. Supp. 2d 712, 723 (S.D. Tex. \n2011); LaShawn A. by Moore v. Kelly, 990 F.2d 1319, 1323 (D.C. Cir. 1993); but see 31 Foster \nChildren,  329  F.3d  at  1281;  J.B.,  186  F.3d  at  1292–93;  Carson  P,  240  F.R.D.  at  532.  \nAccordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have failed to prove that West Virginia’s Circuit Courts \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 258   Filed 07/28/21   Page 29 of 30 PageID #: 12250\nprevent the presentation of these claims during the periodic review proceedings conducted as a \npart of these children’s ongoing abuse and neglect proceedings.  The third and final prong of the \nYounger analysis is satisfied.    \nd.  Exceptions to Younger  \nThe Supreme Court has established three exceptions to Younger abstention: (1) “‘there is \na showing of bad faith or harassment by state officials responsible for the prosecution’; (2) ‘the \nstate law to be applied in the criminal proceeding is flagrantly and patently violative of express \nconstitutional prohibitions’; or (3) ‘other extraordinary circumstances’ exist that present a threat \nof immediate and irreparable injury.”  Nivens v. Gilchrist, 444 F.3d 237, 241 (4th Cir. 2006) \n(quoting Kugler v. Helfant, 421 U.S. 117, 124 (1975)).  The Supreme Court has recognized that a \nfederal court may disregard Younger’s requirements only under these circumstances.  Plaintiffs \nhave made no showing that would allow this Court to conclude that any of these exceptions should \nbe applied here.  Accordingly, there is no basis to support the conclusion that Younger abstention \nis  inappropriate,  and  all  three  Middlesex  factors  are  satisfied.    This  Court  is  barred  from \nconsideration of this case under Younger and its progeny.   \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ five Motions to Dismiss.  \n(ECF Nos. 17, 55, 88, 107, 167.)  The following six named Plaintiffs are removed from this action: \nSerena S., Garrett M., Gretchen C., Chris K., Calvin K., and Carolina K.  Further, it is ORDERED \nthat this civil action is DISMISSED and retired from the docket of this Court.  The Court \nDIRECTS the Clerk to remove this matter from the Court’s docket. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n29 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 258   Filed 07/28/21   Page 30 of 30 PageID #: 12251\nThe Court DIRECTS the Clerk to send a copy of this Order to counsel of record and any \nunrepresented party.   \nENTER:  July 28, 2021  \n \n \n \n \n \n30 \n ",

CIVIL ACTION NO.  3:19-cv-00710 \n \nJIM JUSTICE, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \nORDER \n \n \nPending before the Court is Defendants Jim Justice, Bill Crouch, Jeremiah Samples, Linda \nWatts,  and  the  West  Virginia  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Resources’  (collectively \n“Defendants”) Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ Complaint.  (ECF No. 17.)  For the reasons more \nfully explained below, the Motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs are children in the West Virginia foster care system.  (ECF No. 1 at 2, ¶ 2.)  \nThey  allege  this  system,  as  run  by  Defendants,  is  structurally  inept,  in  violation  of  their \nconstitutional and statutory rights.  (Id. at 6, ¶ 10.)  Seeking system-wide reform, Plaintiffs \nbrought this putative class action on behalf of all children who are, or will be, placed in West \nVirginia foster care.  (See id.) \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint describes a legion of shortcomings in the foster care system.  For \ninstance, Plaintiffs allege that the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 2 of 43 PageID #: 13004\n(“DHHR”) “lacks a sufficient number of foster care placements.”  (Id. at 4, ¶ 9(a).)  This, in turn, \nleads to DHHR “segregate[ing] children in institutions,” placing some in temporary shelters for \nindefinite stints of time, leaving others in “known abusive or neglectful homes,” or placing them \nin poorly vetted and overcrowded foster homes.  (Id. at 4, ¶ 9(b).)  Among this slate of improper \nplacements, Plaintiffs allege DHHR has a go-to: institutions.  (Id. at 4, ¶ 9(c).)  Nearly three-\nquarters of the children in DHHR custody between the ages of 12 and 17 are institutionalized.  \n(Id. at 3, ¶7.)  Plaintiffs allege these institutions run “rampant [with] sexual, physical, and \nemotional abuse,” (Id. at 69, ¶ 281), and are more akin to “youth corrections facilit[ies]” than foster \nplacements.  (See e.g., id. at 33, ¶ 127.)  Worse yet, Plaintiffs allege many of these institutions \nare  outside  West  Virginia,  which  all  but  isolates  foster  children  from  their  families  and \ncommunities.  (Id. at 69, ¶ 278.)  Even when DHHR keeps foster children in-state, they are \nroutinely separated from their siblings, and DHHR fails to arrange any visitation or communication \nbetween them.  (Id. at 21–22, ¶ 71.)  Plaintiffs further allege that all these placements, institutions \nand foster homes alike, are unstable, and that DHHR oftentimes shuttles them from one placement \nto another rather than securing them a permanent home.  (Id. at 59–62, ¶¶ 244–55.)   \nStaff shortages also plague the foster care system.  DHHR, according to Plaintiffs, “fails \nto employ and retain a sufficient number of appropriately trained caseworkers.”  (Id. at 5, ¶ 9(f)).  \nThis leaves caseworkers swamped with “unmanageable caseloads,” sometimes “two or three times \n. . . the recommended standard.”  (Id. at 71, ¶ 288.)  DHHR unsurprisingly has an “alarmingly \nhigh caseworker turnover” rate.  (Id. at 72, ¶ 292.)  Unfortunately, DHHR’s hiring practices only \nmake matters worse: it routinely fills vacancies with unqualified applicants that have no training \nor education in social work.  (Id. at 72, ¶ 293.)  These shortcomings, Plaintiffs allege, have \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 3 of 43 PageID #: 13005\nresulted in DHHR employing caseworkers that are “poorly trained [and] ill-equipped to help West \nVirginian families.”  (Id. at 70, ¶ 283.) \nUnqualified, overworked caseworkers lead to other deficiencies in West Virginia’s foster \ncare system.  High caseloads prevent caseworkers from “timely assess[ing] [the needs of] children \nentering the foster care system.”  (Id. at 75, ¶ 308.)  Without timely assessments, DHHR cannot \nproperly develop a foster child’s individualized case plan.  (Id.)  Caseworkers are often unable \nto engage in meaningful visits with foster children, which further impedes case plan development.  \n(Id. at 76, ¶ 313.)  Unsurprisingly, individualized case plans are sometimes never developed.  \n(Id.)  DHHR then adds insult to injury by “fail[ing] to engage in necessary permanency planning \nfor [foster] children.”  (Id. at 79, ¶ 328.)  These failures, Plaintiffs allege, force foster children to \n“languish in the foster care system for years.”  (Id.)   \nSimilar shortcomings permeate the foster care system, further exacerbating an already \ndifficult situation.  For example, a considerable number of foster children—Plaintiffs included—\nhave mental health disabilities, ranging from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (“ADHD”) to \npost-traumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”).  (Id. at 78, ¶ 321.)  Yet DHHR has failed to create \nsufficient  community  or  home-based  mental  health  services  to  treat  foster  children; \ninstitutionalization is the only option.  (Id. at 78–79, ¶¶ 323–24.)  DHHR does not provide certain \nfoster parents with much-needed services, such as financial assistance and training for how to raise \nfoster children with disabilities.  (Id. at 62–67, ¶¶ 256–74.)  When it comes time for a foster child \nto age out of the system, DHHR all but abandons them—caseworkers “sometimes [wait until] as \nlate as weeks before a teen’s 18th birthday” to develop any sort of transitional plan for adulthood.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 4 of 43 PageID #: 13006\n(Id. at 83, ¶ 342.)  Plaintiffs allege these last-minute efforts are futile, and foster children are \ninevitably thrust “into either unstable situations or directly into homelessness.”  (Id. at 82, ¶ 340.)   \nPlaintiffs filed suit in this Court on September 30, 2019.  (ECF No. 1.)  The Complaint \nproposes one General Class, consisting of all children who are will be in West Virginia foster care, \nand three subclasses.  (Id. at 10–11, ¶ 30.)  The proposed Kinship Subclass consists of children \nwho are, will be, or have been placed in kinship placements.1  (Id. at 10–11, ¶ 30(a)(i).)  The \nproposed  ADA  Subclass  consists  of  children  who  have  or  will  have  physical,  intellectual, \ncognitive, or mental health disabilities.  (Id. at 11, ¶ 30(a)(ii).)  The proposed Aging Out Subclass \nconsists of children who are or will be 14 years old and older, who are eligible to receive age-\nappropriate transition planning but have not been provided the necessary case management and \nservices.  (Id. at 11, ¶ 30(a)(iii).)   \nThe Complaint includes five causes of action.  First, the General class and each subclass \nallege violations of their substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.  (Id. at \n90–93, ¶¶ 368–74.)  Second, each class asserts violations of their right to familial association \nunder the First, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments.  (Id. at 93–94, ¶¶ 375–80.)  Third, all classes \nallege violations of the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (“AACWA”).  (Id. \nat 94–96, ¶¶ 381–83.)  Fourth, the ADA subclass alleges violations of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act (“ADA”).  (Id. at 96–98, ¶¶ 384–94.)  Fifth, the ADA subclass asserts a claim \nfor violations of the Rehabilitation Act.  (Id. at 98–99, ¶¶ 395–402.)   \n \n1 West Virginia law defines “kinship placement” as “the placement of the child with a relative of the child, as defined \nherein, or a placement of a child with a fictive kin, as defined herein.”  W. Va. Code § 49–1–206.  Further, “relative \nof the child” is defined as “an adult of at least 21 years of age who is related to the child, by blood or marriage, within \nat least three degrees” and “fictive kin” is defined as “an adult of at least 21 years of age, who is not a relative of the \nchild, as defined herein, but who has an established, substantial relationship with the child, including but not limited \nto, teachers, coaches, ministers, and parents, or family members of the child's friends.”  Id. \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 5 of 43 PageID #: 13007\nPlaintiffs sued Defendants, Governor Jim Justice, then-Cabinet Secretary of the DHHR \nBill Crouch, Deputy Secretary of the DHHR Jeremiah Samples, Commissioner of the Bureau for \nChildren and Families Linda Watts, in their official capacity, as well as the DHHR.  (Id. at 8–9, ¶ \n21–25.)  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief against Defendants for the alleged \ndeficiencies in the foster care system they oversee.  (Id. at 99–104, ¶ 403–08.)  Boiled down, \nPlaintiffs seek three things.  First, a declaration that these systematic deficiencies are unlawful.  \n(Id. at 99–100, ¶ 404.)  Second, injunctive relief that would require Defendants to overhaul the \nWest Virginia foster care system.  (Id. at 100–03, ¶ 405.)  Third, a court-appointed Monitor to \noversee Defendants’ compliance with the injunction.  (Id. at 104, ¶ 406.) \nDefendants moved to dismiss the Complaint for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).2  (ECF No. 17.)  The matter has since been fully briefed and is now \nripe for adjudication.  (ECF Nos. 18, 29, 35, & 52.) \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nA motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted tests the \nlegal sufficiency of a civil complaint.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  A plaintiff must allege sufficient \nfacts, which, if proven, would entitle him to relief under a cognizable legal claim.  Bell Atl. Corp. \nv. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 554–55 (2007).  A case should be dismissed if, viewing the well-\npleaded factual allegations in the complaint as true and in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, \nthe complaint does not contain “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  \n \n2 In their motion, Defendants also moved to dismiss the case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under Rule \n12(b)(1), arguing that abstention was appropriate under Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971), or, alternatively, the \nRooker-Feldman doctrine.  (ECF No. 18 at 4–14.)  The Court previously granted this motion and abstained from \nexercising jurisdiction under Younger.  (ECF No. 258.)  Plaintiffs appealed, and the Fourth Circuit reversed.  \nJonathan R. by Dixon v. Justice, 41 F.4th 316 (4th Cir. 2022).  In doing so, the Fourth Circuit held that both Younger \nand Rooker-Feldman abstention were inapplicable.  Id. at 339, 341.  Now, on remand, the Court must turn to the \nmerits and determine whether Plaintiffs have stated a claim for relief. \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 6 of 43 PageID #: 13008\nId. at 570.  In applying this standard, a court must utilize a two-pronged approach.  First, it must \nseparate the legal conclusions in the complaint from the factual allegations.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, \n556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  Second, assuming the truth of only the factual allegations, the court \nmust  determine  whether  the  plaintiff’s  complaint  permits  a  reasonable  inference  that  “the \ndefendant  is  liable  for  the  misconduct  alleged.”    Id.    Well-pleaded  factual  allegations  are \nrequired; labels, conclusions, and a “formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will \nnot do.”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555; see also King v. Rubenstein, 825 F.3d 206, 214 (4th Cir. \n2016) (“Bare legal conclusions ‘are not entitled to the assumption of truth’ and are insufficient to \nstate a claim.” (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679)).  A plaintiff’s “[f]actual allegations must be \nenough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level,” thereby “nudg[ing] [the] claims across \nthe line from conceivable to plausible.”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, 570. \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nAs stated above, Plaintiffs allege violations of their substantive due process rights, right to \nfamilial association, AACWA, ADA, and Rehabilitation Act.  Defendants urge the Court to \ndismiss each for failure to state a claim.  Against this backdrop, the Court turns to the task at hand. \nA.  Count I – Substantive Due Process \nThe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that “[n]o State shall . . . \ndeprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”  U.S. CONST. amend. \nXIV,  §  1.    This  Clause  has  two  distinct  components.    The  first,  procedural  due  process, \nguarantees citizens “fair procedure[s]” before being deprived of life, liberty, or property.  Collins \nv. City of Harker Heights, 503 U.S. 115, 125 (1992).  The second, substantive due process, \n“provides heightened protection against government interference with certain fundamental rights \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 7 of 43 PageID #: 13009\nand liberty interests.”  Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 720 (1997); see also County of \nSacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 840 (1998) (The Due Process Clause “cover[s] a substantive \nsphere as well, barring certain government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used \nto implement them.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).  \nThe Due Process Clause typically functions “as a negative prohibition on state action.”  \nPinder v. Johnson, 54 F.3d 1169, 1174 (4th Cir. 1995) (en banc).  It serves, by and large, “as a \nlimitation on the State’s power to act,” thereby “prevent[ing] government from abusing [its] power, \nor employing it as an instrument of oppression.”  DeShaney v. Winnebago County Department of \nSocial Services, 489 U.S. 189, 195–96 (1989) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  Thus, the Due Process Clause ordinarily “does not require governmental actors to \naffirmatively protect life, liberty, or property.”  Pinder, 54 F.3d at 1174.  \nBut there are exceptions to this general rule.  One exception exists when the government \ntakes an individual into government custody, thereby creating a custodial relationship between the \ntwo.  Id. at 1174–75.  During this custodial relationship, substantive due process imposes an \naffirmative duty on the government to care for the individual.  Id.  Plaintiffs allege Defendants \nhave failed to carry out this constitutional command.  The affirmative duty to care for another is \nbest understood by reviewing the cases developing it.  The Court will first discuss a trilogy of \nSupreme Court opinions, and then look to Fourth Circuit precedent applying this affirmative duty \nin the foster care context.  Once this is done, the Court will analyze Plaintiffs’ claims. \na.  Governing Law \nThe Supreme Court first found an affirmative duty to act in Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97 \n(1976).  In Estelle, the prisoner-plaintiff was working when a cotton bale fell, struck him, and \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 8 of 43 PageID #: 13010\ninjured his back.  Id. at 99.  Despite receiving medical attention for his injury, the plaintiff’s pain \nnever  subsided.    Id.  at  99–101.    He  later  sued,  claiming  he  received  inadequate  medical \ntreatment, which subjected him to cruel and unusual punishment.3  Id. at 101.  When analyzing \nhis claim, the Court recognized that the government has an “obligation to provide medical care for \nthose whom it is punishing by incarceration.”  Id. at 103.  This affirmative duty exits because \n“inmate[s] must rely on prison authorities to treat [their] medical needs; if the authorities fail to do \nso, those needs will not be met.”  Id. (emphasis added). \nThe Court built on this reasoning in Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982), where it \noutlined the substantive due process rights guaranteed to those involuntarily in state custody for \nnon-penal reasons.  Romeo was 33-year-old man with an IQ of between 8 and 10.  Id. at 309.  \nHis mother was unable to care for him or control his violence, so she sought his institutionalization.  \nId.  She was successful, and Romeo was involuntarily committed to a mental institution.  Id. at \n310.  Once there, “Romeo was injured on numerous occasions, both by his own violence and by \nthe reactions of other residents to him.”  Id.  The infirmary doctor then ordered that Romeo be \nrestrained to protect both himself and other patients.  Id. at 310–11.  Romeo’s mother challenged \nhis  living  conditions,  arguing  the  institution  “failed  to  [provide]  appropriate  preventive \nprocedures” and “appropriate treatment or programs for his mental retardation.”  Id. (internal \nquotation marks omitted).  These failures, she claimed, violated her son’s substantive due process \nrights.  See id. at 311, 314–15, 316.   \nThe Court held that the state unquestionably owed citizens “wholly dependent” on it \nseveral rights.  Id. at 317.  For instance, the state must “provide adequate food, shelter, clothing, \n \n3 Notably, the prisoner-plaintiff brought a § 1983 action for an Eight Amendment violation, not substantive due \nprocess.  Id. at 101. \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 9 of 43 PageID #: 13011\nand medical care,” as well as “reasonable safety [to] all residents.”  Id. at 324.  Those, it held, \nwere “the essentials.”  Id.  The Court further held that the state must provide some individuals \nwith training or habilitation when necessary to protect the individuals’ substantive due process \nrights, such as their right to safety or freedom from bodily restraint.  See id.  Importantly, \nhowever, states “necessarily ha[ve] considerable discretion in determining the nature and scope of \n[their] responsibilities.”4  Id. at 317.  They need not “choose between attacking every aspect of a \nproblem or not attacking the problem at all.”  Id.   \nThen, in DeShaney v. Winnebago County Department of Social Services, 489 U.S. 189 \n(1989), the Court explained when this affirmative duty is triggered.  In DeShaney, the county’s \ndepartment of social services (“DSS”) knew that Randy DeShaney was abusing his son, but it \nfailed to intervene.5  Id. at 192.  Randy finally beat his boy into a coma, and although the boy \nsurvived, he was expected to live out the remainder of his days in an institution for the feeble \nminded.  Id. at 192–93.  The boy’s mother filed suit against Winnebago County, DSS, and \nvarious DSS employees, alleging they violated her son’s substantive due process right to protection \nfrom a “risk of violence at his father’s hands,” about which they knew or shown have known.  Id. \nat 193.  Specifically, the mother argued that, notwithstanding there generally being no duty to \nprotect, DSS stood in a “special relationship” to her boy because it knew of his danger.  Id. at 197.  \nThe Court rejected this argument because the boy was in his father’s custody, not the State’s, when \n \n4 The Court held that when deciding whether training or habilitation should be provided, “courts must show deference \nto the judgment exercised by a qualified professional.”  Id. at 322.  A decision made by a professional is thus \n“presumptively valid” and will not be interfered with by courts unless “the decision by the professional is such a \nsubstantial departure from accepted professional judgment, practice, or standards as to demonstrate that the person \nresponsible actually did not base the decision on such a judgment.”  Id. at 323. \n5 The boy had previously been hospitalized from what was suspected child abuse, and DSS had obtained a court order \ngranting temporary custody to the hospital.  Id. at 192.  However, the county determined there was insufficient \nevidence of child abuse to retain custody, so the boy was returned to his father.  Id. \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 10 of 43 PageID #: 13012\nthe harm occurred, and the State played no part in creating the danger.  Id. at 201.  In doing so, \nthe Court offered the following explanation for when—and why—this affirmative duty arises: \nTaken together, [Estelle and Youngberg] stand only for the proposition that \nwhen the State takes a person into its custody and holds him there against his will, \nthe  Constitution  imposes  upon  it  a  corresponding  duty  to  assume  some \nresponsibility for his safety and general well-being.  The rationale for this principle \nis simple enough: when the State by the affirmative exercise of its power so \nrestrains an individual's liberty that it renders him unable to care for himself, and at \nthe same time fails to provide for his basic human needs—e.g., food, clothing, \nshelter, medical care, and reasonable safety—it transgresses the substantive limits \non state action set by the Eighth Amendment and the Due Process Clause.  The \naffirmative duty to protect arises not from the State's knowledge of the individual's \npredicament or from its expressions of intent to help him, but from the limitation \nwhich it has imposed on his freedom to act on his own behalf.   \n \nId. at 199–200. (footnotes omitted) (internal citations omitted). \n  The Fourth Circuit then applied DeShaney to the foster care context in Doe ex rel. Johnson \nv. South Carolina Department of Social Services, 597 F.3d 163 (4th Cir. 2010).  There, state social \nworkers removed two siblings, Jane and Kameron, from their home after receiving reports of \nsexual abuse.  Id. at 166.  Once in state custody, the social worker placed Jane in a foster home \nwith Kameron, despite knowing Kameron had sexually abused Jane.  Id. at 166–68.  This sexual \nabuse continued in foster care.  Id. at 168.  Jane’s adoptive parents sued on her behalf, arguing \nthat the social worker violated Jane’s substantive due process rights by placing her in a foster home \nthe social worker knew was dangerous.  Id.  The Court agreed.  Id. at 175.  It reasoned that “the \nstate ha[d] taken [the] affirmative act” of “involuntarily remov[ing] [Jane] from her home,” \nthereby restraining her liberty.  Id. at 175.  This affirmative act triggered substantive due process \nprotections and thus imposed “some responsibility for [Jane’s] safety and general well-being.” Id. \n(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting DeShaney, 489 U.S at 200).  Children involuntarily \nplaced in foster care therefore enjoy those substantive due process rights guaranteed by Youngberg \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 11 of 43 PageID #: 13013\nand DeShaney.  Id.  Before concluding, the Fourth Circuit also held that state actors cannot be \ndeliberately indifferent these substantive due process rights.  Id.  \nb.  Plaintiffs’ Claims \nThe proposed General Class and every subclass assert various substantive due process \nrights, all of which they allege Defendants have violated.  The General Class asserts the following \nseven substantive due process rights: (1) the right to freedom from maltreatment and repeated \nmaltreatment, while under the protective supervision of the State; (2) the right to protection from \nunnecessary intrusions into the child’s emotional wellbeing once the State has established a special \nrelationship with that child; (3) the right to services necessary to prevent an unreasonable risk of \nharm; (4) the right to conditions and duration of foster care reasonably related to the purpose of \ngovernment  custody;  (5)  the  right  to  treatment  and  care  consistent  with  the  purpose  and \nassumptions of government custody; (6) the right not to be maintained in custody longer than is \nnecessary to accomplish the purpose to be served by taking a child into government custody; and \n(7) the right to services in the least restrictive, most family-like setting.  (ECF. No. 1 at 91–92, ¶ \n373(a)–(g)).   \nThe proposed Kinship Subclass asserts the following three substantive due process rights: \n(1) the right to placement in the least-restrictive most family-like setting that is properly assessed \nto determine whether it is a safe and appropriate placement; (2) the right to supportive and case \nmanagement services to ensure placement stability and ensure the child is free from harm; and (3) \nthe right to a plan and corresponding services for a permanent home.  (Id. at 92, ¶ 374(a)(i)–(iii)).   \nThe proposed ADA Subclass claims four substantive due process rights: (1) the right to be \nfree from discrimination by reason of disability; (2) the right to services in the most integrated \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 12 of 43 PageID #: 13014\nsetting  appropriate  to  the  person’s  needs;  (3)  the  right  to  be  free  from  unnecessary \ninstitutionalization and to be placed in the least restrictive setting; and (4) the right to ensure access \nto an array of community-based placements and services to ensure access to the least restrictive \nalternative.  (Id. at 92–93, ¶ 374(b)(i)–(iv)).   \nThe proposed Aging Out Subclass claims three substantive due process rights: (1) the right \nto independent living services to prepare to exit foster care successfully including, but not limited \nto,  vocational  and  other  educational  services;  money  management,  household  maintenance, \ntransportation, legal issues, health, community resources, housing options, personal hygiene, \nemployment readiness, and educational assistance; (2) the right to assistance to find lawful, \nsuitable permanent housing that will not result in homelessness upon exit from foster care; and (3) \nthe right to a connection with an adult resource who will maintain a stable, long-term relationship \nwith the child after he or she ages out of the system.  (Id. at 93, ¶ 374(c)(i)–(iii)).   \nc.  Analysis \nDefendants take issue with most of Plaintiffs’ substantive due process claims.  Although \nDefendants  concede  that  they  owe  Plaintiffs  the  “basic  human  needs”  that  Youngberg  and \nDeShaney demand, they argue nothing is owed beyond that.  (ECF No. 18 at 16.)  Defendants \nmaintain that Plaintiffs are trying to take the “aspirational statutory, regulatory, and private \nstandards” applicable to the West Virginia foster care system and “convert each of them [in]to \nconstitutional requirements.”  (Id. at 14) (quoting Connor B. ex rel. Vigurs v. Patrick, 774 F.3d \n45, 55 (1st Cir. 2014)).  Plaintiffs, however, counter that they do not seek “an aspirational child \nwelfare system, but merely a constitutionally adequate one.”  (ECF No. 29 at 17–18) (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted.)  Plaintiffs believe Defendants are pulling a slight of hand, \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 13 of 43 PageID #: 13015\nusing precedent to “convert the floor of constitutional protection into its ceiling.”  (Id. at 21.)  \nWith these arguments in mind, the Court must now parse through each asserted substantive right, \ntesting the legal basis for each. \ni.  General Class \nLooking first at the proposed General Class, Defendants do not dispute that the Due Process \nClause requires them to protect against maltreatment and repeated maltreatment.  (See ECF No. \n18 at 18 n.8.)  Instead, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not adequately alleged Defendants’ \ndeliberate indifference to this duty.  (Id. at 18–19.)  The Court disagrees.  Plaintiffs’ Complaint \nadequately alleges that Defendants have placed Plaintiffs in placements known to be dangerous.  \nFor example, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants placed Anastasia M., an 11-year-old girl, in a facility \nwith a history of child molestation, sexual battery, and sexual assault by patients and employees \nalike.  (ECF No. 1 at 20, ¶ 63.)  Plaintiffs further allege that Defendants placed a then-12-year-\nold Garrett M. in “an institutional residential placement for male sex offenders.”  (Id. at 29–30, ¶ \n111.)  Garrett is not a sex offender, nor has he ever been charged with a sex offense.  (Id. at 30, \n¶ 115.)  Nevertheless, Defendants placed 12-year-old Garrett among sex offenders, many of \nwhom were 15 years of age and older.  (Id. at 29–30, ¶ 111.)  These claims adequately allege that \nDefendants turned a blind eye to a known danger that Plaintiffs would be mistreated and abused \nwhile in State custody.  Doe, 597 F.3d at 176 (“[S]tate officials responsible for [placement] \ndecisions ha[ve] a corresponding duty to refrain from placing [children] in a known, dangerous \nenvironment in deliberate indifference to [their] right to personal safety and security.”).   \nDefendants  next  seek  dismissal  of  Plaintiffs  claim  for  the  right  to  protection  from \nunnecessary intrusions into the child’s emotional wellbeing while in State custody.  The Court \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 14 of 43 PageID #: 13016\ndeclines to do so.  As outlined above, the Due Process Clause requires Defendants to protect foster \nchildren’s well-being.  See, e.g., DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 200; Doe, 597 F.3d at 175.  The only \nissue here is whether this duty extends to protecting a foster child’s emotional well-being.  The \nCourt believes it does.  As another district court aptly put it, this “conclusion is grounded in \ncommon sense.”  B.H. v. Johnson, 715 F. Supp. 1387, 1395 (N.D. Ill. 1989).  Children’s physical \nand emotional well-being are equally important.  Id.  Although physical injuries mend, emotional \ntrauma inflicted during a child’s tender years has “an indelible effect” from which they may never \nrecover.  Id.  It would be an odd result for the Fourteenth Amendment to require Defendants to \nprotect against possible short-term injuries, while at the same time providing no protection against \nlifelong harm.  This is hardly a novel idea, and the Court readily accepts it.  See e.g., M.D. by \nStukenberg v. Abbott, 907 F.3d 237, 250 (5th Cir. 2018) (holding that substantive due process \nensures the right “to be free from severe psychological abuse and emotional trauma”) (emphasis \nin original); Wyatt B. by McAllister v. Brown, No. 6:19-cv-00556, 2021 WL 4434011, at *8 (D. \nOr. Sept. 27, 2021); Connor B. ex rel. Vigurs v. Patrick, 771 F. Supp. 2d 142, 161 (D. Mass. 2011); \nMarisol A. by Forbes v. Giuliani, 929 F. Supp. 662, 675 (S.D.N.Y. 1996); B.H., 715 F. Supp. at \n1395. \nDefendants next take aim at Plaintiffs’ third claimed right—the right to services necessary \nto prevent unreasonable risk of harm.  Like the right to prevent maltreatment, Defendants concede \nthis right “arguably relate[s] to the basic human need of physical safety,” but contend Plaintiffs \nhave not plead deliberate indifference to the right.  (ECF No. at 18 n.8) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  The Court rejects, at this juncture, Defendants’ position that Plaintiffs have failed to \nallege deliberate indifference here.  The Complaint includes a host of allegations that Plaintiffs \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 15 of 43 PageID #: 13017\nhave not been provided the services necessary to ensure their reasonable safety.  (See e.g., ECF \nNo. 1, at 17, 21, ¶¶ 52, 70.)  For example, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants do not conduct \nbackground checks on potential foster parents before placing children in their care; Plaintiffs also \nallege that Defendants do not always inspect foster homes before placing Plaintiffs in them.  (Id.)  \nTaking these allegations as true, which the Court must at the pleading stage, one could reasonably \ninfer that Defendants were deliberately indifferent to Plaintiffs’ rights.  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.   \n  Next, the Court addresses two overlapping rights: the right to conditions and duration of \nfoster care reasonably related to the purpose of government custody, and the right not to be \nmaintained in custody longer than is necessary to accomplish the purpose to be served by taking a \nchild into government custody.  Defendants assert that, although these rights are “sound policy,” \nthey are “not constitutionally mandated.”  (ECF No. 18 at 17.)  The Court disagrees.  In Jackson \nv. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715 (1972), the Supreme Court said that “due process requires that the nature \nand duration of [custody] bear some reasonable relation to the purpose for which the individual is \n[in custody].”  Id. at 738 (emphasis added).  Plaintiffs are in Defendants’ custody largely because \nthey have been abused or neglected by their parents.  These terrible conditions justify Defendants \n“intru[ding] on [the] family relationships” that are “ranked as of basic importance in our society.”  \nM.L.B. v. S.L.J., 519 U.S. 102, 116 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Boddie v. \nConnecticut, 401 U.S. 371, 376 (1971).  Once these conditions cease, so do the justifications for \nremoval.   \n  The Court now turns to the right to treatment and care consistent with the purpose and \nassumptions of government custody.  Once more, Defendants urge the Court to dismiss this claim, \nbelieving it is a matter of state policy, not constitutional law.  (ECF No. 18 at 16–17.)  Jackson, \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 16 of 43 PageID #: 13018\nand Doe say otherwise.  As previously discussed, substantive due process requires that the nature \nof custody reasonably relate to its purpose.  Jackson, 406 U.S. at 738.  Here, Plaintiffs are in \nDefendants’ custody because Defendants sought to prevent Plaintiffs’ abuse and neglect.  Due \nprocess imposes a corresponding duty on Defendants to ensure that Plaintiffs are neither abused \nnor neglected while in their custody.  Doe confirms this: “when a state involuntarily removes a \nchild from her home” to prevent abuse and neglect,” due process imposes “some responsibility for \n[the child's] safety and general well-being.’”  Doe, 597 U.S. at 175 (alteration in original) (quoting \nDeShaney, 489 U.S. at 200).  The Court notes, however, that substantive due process does not \ndemand optimal treatment, Charlie H. v. Whitman, 83 F. Supp. 2d 476, 507 (D.N.J. 2000), and the \nState need not “choose between attacking every aspect of a problem or not attacking the problem \nat all.”  Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 317.  Defendants need only provide for Plaintiffs’ basic human \nneeds  and  prevent  further  abuse  and  neglect.    Thus,  to  the  extent  Plaintiffs  have  alleged \nDefendants failed to uphold this constitutional duty, they have stated a claim for relief. \n  Finally, the Court addresses the General Class’s last asserted right: the right to services in \nthe least restrictive, most family-like setting.  The Court is unconvinced that substantive due \nprocess goes this far.  Plaintiffs’ fail to cite a single case where any court has stretched substantive \ndue process this far.  The Court is unsurprised that no court has found this right since Youngberg \nand DeShaney merely impose a duty to provide for an individual’s basic human needs.  Plaintiffs \nclaim that limiting substantive due process protections to their basic human needs—as Youngberg \nand DeShaney instruct—is “regressive” and “outdated.”  (ECF No. 29 at 17.)  However, that is \nthe law as it exists today, and the Court declines to “turn[] any fresh furrows in the ‘treacherous \nfield’ of substantive due process.”  Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 76 (2000) (Souter., J., \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 17 of 43 PageID #: 13019\nconcurring in the judgment) (quoting Moore v. City of E. Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 502 (1977) \n(opinion of Powell J.)).   \nii.  Kinship Subclass \n  The Court now turns to the proposed Kinship subclass, beginning with their second \nasserted right.  Substantive due process, according to this Subclass, guarantees them the right to \nsupportive and case management services to ensure placement stability and ensure the child is free \nfrom harm.  As noted above, due process requires Defendants to provide for foster children’s \nreasonable safety.  Doe, 597 F.3d at 175.  This, in turn, requires Defendants to implement the \nservices necessary to ensure that the Subclass is free from harm.  However, substantive due \nprocess goes no further.  It simply does not provide a right to stability while in foster care.  \nAbbott, 907 F.3d at 268; Eric L. By and Through Schierberl v. Bird, 848 F. Supp 303, 307 (D.N.H. \n1994) (finding that “[t]he complaint pleads no facts tending to establish that [social services’] \nplacement of children with successive foster parents is so devoid of justification as to give rise to \na substantive violation of the Due Process Clause.”).  \nThe first and third rights claimed by this Subclass have no basis in substantive due process.  \nThe Court has previously explained that substantive due process does not protect the right to the \nleast-restrictive, most family-like setting available while in foster care; the conditions of foster \ncare need only to relate to its purpose.  Jackson, 406 U.S. at 738.  Similarly, substantive due \nprocess does not require Defendants to do more than provide for foster children’s basic human \nneeds.  DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 200.  While it would certainly be sound policy for Defendants to \nadopt, that is a matter for West Virginia’s elected officials to address, not the federal judiciary.  \nAccord Connor B., 774 F.3d at 48. \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 18 of 43 PageID #: 13020\niii.  ADA Subclass \nThe Court can dispose of the proposed ADA subclass’ claims in short order.  First, there \nis no substantive due process right to be free from discrimination by reason of disability.  That \nright is protected by the ADA, not the Fourteenth Amendment.  See generally 42 U.S.C. § 12101, \net seq.  As DeShaney explained, not “every [statutory violation] committed by a state actor [is] a \nconstitutional violation.”  DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 202.  Second, there is no right to services in the \nmost integrated setting appropriate to the person’s needs.  Jackson, 406 U.S. at 738; Wyatt B., \n2021  WL  4434011,  at  *8–9.    Third,  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  does  not  protect  against \nunnecessary institutionalization, nor does it guarantee placement in the least restrictive setting.  \nWyatt B., 2021 WL 4434011, at *8–9.  That, too, is a claim cognizable under the ADA rather than \nsubstantive due process. Compare Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581 (1999), with \nYoungberg, 457 U.S. 307 (1982).  Fourth, “the right to ensure access to an array of community-\nbased placements and services to ensure access to the least restrictive alternative” is a far cry from \nthe basic human needs DeShaney requires.  Substantive due process does not extend this far.  \niv.  Aging Out Subclass \nSubstantive due process also does not protect any of the rights claimed by the proposed \nAging Out subclass.  Although the services they seek “would obviously . . . benefit . . . the \nchild[ren] and . . . society,” Wyatt B., 2021 WL 4434011, at *9, not every laudable goal is enshrined \nin the Fourteenth Amendment.  Each proposed right instead goes well beyond DeShaney, and the \nCourt declines to wander into that uncharted territory.  This decision comes not from a lack of \ncompassion for Plaintiffs, but instead from a mindfulness that each time the Court “break[s] new \nground in this [area of substantive due process],” it strips the West Virginia Legislature of its \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 19 of 43 PageID #: 13021\nability to decide the matter on behalf of the people of West Virginia.  Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at \n720.    Cognizant that “the Due Process Clause does not empower the judiciary to sit as a \nsuperlegislature,” Exxon Corp. v. Governor of Md., 437 U.S. 117, 124 (1978) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted) (quoting Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U.S. 726, 731 (1963)), the Court faithfully \napplies precedent to reach this conclusion.  For these reasons, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss \nCount I is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. \nB.  Count II – Familial Association \nThe Court now turns to Count II, wherein Plaintiffs allege Defendants violated their right \nto familial association under the First, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments.  The Court will first \nreview each amendment and pertinent case law before analyzing Plaintiffs’ claims.   \na.  Governing Law \ni.  Fourteenth Amendment \nThe Supreme Court first recognized that the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause \nprotects the family unit a century ago.  Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399 (1923) (finding the \nFourteenth Amendment guarantees the right “to marry, establish a home and bring up children.”).  \nThe Court has since created a “private realm of family life which the state cannot enter.”  Prince \nv. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166 (1944).  In these cases, the Court has applied substantive due \nprocess to stave off government interference in two aspects of family life: the parent-child \nrelationship, Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745 (1982), and particularly intimate family decisions, \nsuch as marriage and childbearing.  See e.g., Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. LaFleur, 414 U.S. 632 \n(1974); Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S.1 (1967).  \nThe lone instance where the Court applied substantive due process beyond these two \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 20 of 43 PageID #: 13022\ncategories was in Moore v. City of East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494 (1977) (plurality opinion), where \nit held that family members may live together free from undue government interference.6  There, \nthe city enacted an ordinance restricting many homes to single-family use.  Id. at 495–96.  The \nordinance included a narrow definition of “family,” however, which criminalized a grandmother \nand grandchild living together.  Id. at 496–97.  Outlawing the grandmother’s decision to live with \nher grandson was “no mere incidental result of the ordinance.”  Id. at 498.  Instead, the city \nintended to “regulate the occupancy of” households, deciding for itself “who may live together \nand [who] may not.”  Id. at 498–99.  The Court struck down the ordinance as an “intrusive \nregulation” that “slic[ed] deep[] into the family itself.”  Id. at 498.  Substantive due process \nprevents the government from regulating family living arrangements, the Court explained, because \n“this Nation[] [has a long] history and tradition” of extended kin “sharing a household” and “major \nresponsibilit[ies] for the rearing of . . . children.”  Id. at 503–05.  In light of this tradition, the \nCourt found that extended family have a constitutional right to reside together.  Id. at 504.  While \nthe Court acknowledged “the family is not beyond regulation,” the city had no compelling interest \nthat justified the ordinance.  Id. at 499–500.   \nii.  First Amendment \nThe First Amendment prohibits the government from “abridging the freedom of speech, or \nof the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for \n \n6 Justice Powell, joined by three other Justices, authored the lead opinion.  Moore, 431 U.S. at 495.  Justice Stevens \nconcurred in the judgment but on somewhat different grounds. He reasoned that the States cannot constitutionally \ninterfere with a residential property owner’s right “to determine the internal composition of his household,” unless \ndone to ensure that those homes “remain nontransient, single-housekeeping units.”  Id. at 518–19 (Stevens, J., \nconcurring in the judgment).  In other words, Justice Stevens would extend the constitutional right to cohabitate to \nunrelated individuals, so long as there was no “transient occupancy.”  Id. at 516–19.  Seeing how Justice Powell’s \nopinion is the narrower of the two, it must be treated as controlling.  A.T. Massey Coal Co. v. Massanari, 305 F.3d \n226, 236 (4th Cir. 2002) (“[W]hen a decision of the [Supreme] Court lacks a majority opinion, the opinion of the \nJustices concurring in the judgment on the “narrowest grounds” is to be regarded as the Court's holding.”). \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 21 of 43 PageID #: 13023\na redress of grievances.”  U.S. CONST. amend. I.  The Supreme Court has “long understood as \nimplicit” in these First Amendment guarantees “a corresponding right to associate with others.”  \nAms. For Prosperity Found. v. Bonta, 141 S. Ct. 2373, 2382 (2021) (quoting Roberts v. U.S. \nJaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 622 (1984)). \nIn Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609 (1984), the Court recognized that this \nright to association includes the right to intimate, or familial, association.  There, the Jaycees, a \nnon-profit organization, limited full-fledged membership to men.  Id. at 613.  A state statute, \nhowever, required the Jaycees to provide women equal membership.  Id. at 614–15.  The Jaycees \nchallenged the statute, arguing that requiring women’s equal membership violated its members’ \nFirst Amendment right to freedom of association.  Id. at 615.   \nWhen  analyzing  this  intimate  association  claim,  the  Court  explained  that  the  First \nAmendment protects “certain kinds of highly personal relationships” because “individuals draw \nmuch of their emotional enrichment from close ties with others.”  Id. at 618–19.  The Court \nlooked to its substantive due process cases, such as Moore and Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 \n(1967), for examples of intimate relationships worthy of “constitutional shelter.”  Id. at 618–20.  \nFrom these intimate relationships, the Court found a common thread: each “attend[ed] the creation \nand sustenance of a family,” such as marriage, childbirth, raising children, and living with \nrelatives.  Id. at 619.  These constitutionally protected relationships differ from others, the Court \nreasoned, because they “are distinguished by such attributes as relative smallness, a high degree \nof selectivity in decisions to begin and maintain the affiliation, and seclusion from others in critical \naspects of the relationship.”  Id. at 619–20.  However, the Court cautioned against extending \nprotection to other relationships, saying that its substantive due process cases “suggest[ed] some \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 22 of 43 PageID #: 13024\nrelevant limitations” on First Amendment protection.  Id. at 619.  As for the Jaycees, they lacked \nmany of these traits.  They were “large and basically unselective.”  Id. at 621.   The Jaycees \nwere also anything but intimate and secluded—in fact, “much of the activity central to the \nformation and maintenance of the [Jaycees] involve[d] the participation of strangers.”  Id. \niii.  Ninth Amendment \n“The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or \ndisparage others retained by the people.”  U.S. CONST. amend. IX.  The Framers adopted the \nNinth Amendment because they “believed that there are additional fundamental rights . . . which \nexist alongside those fundamental rights specifically mentioned” in the Bill of Rights.  Griswold \nv. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 488 (1965) (Goldberg, J., concurring).  The Ninth Amendment thus \nstands  for  a  simple  proposition—the  first  eight  amendments  are  a  non-exhaustive  list  of \nconstitutionally protected rights.  Id. at 490.  Importantly, however, the Ninth Amendment does \nnot confer any individual rights.  See id. at 493.  It merely “lends strong support to the view that” \nindividual  liberty,  as  protected  by  the  Fourteenth  Amendment,  “is  not  restricted  to  rights \nspecifically mentioned in the first eight amendments.”  Id.   \nb.  Analysis \nHaving now reviewed the First, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments, the Court can glean \na few principles from each.  First, the Ninth Amendment does not confer a right to familial \nassociation; it simply provides that the right may exist alongside those included in the Bill of \nRights.    Second,  the  First  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  each  protect  the  right  to  familial \nassociation, and the two seemingly complement one another.  Roberts’ reliance on the Court’s \nFourteenth Amendment cases when describing the First Amendment doctrine proves that the two \n22 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 23 of 43 PageID #: 13025\nare one and the same.  See Roberts, 468 U.S. at 619–20 (citing Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 \n(1967), for the proposition that the First Amendment “imposes constraints on the State's power to \ncontrol the selection of one's spouse.”).  Put differently, those familial relationships worthy of \nsubstantive due process protection always have the distinguishing attributes Roberts found worthy \nof First Amendment protection.  Third, not every government action that interferes with the \nfamily is unconstitutional.  The government may, in certain circumstances, have a sufficiently \ncompelling interest, such that the intrusion is not “undue” in the constitutional sense.  Roberts, \n468 U.S. at 617–18; see also Moore, 431 U.S. at 499.  With these principals in mind, the Court \nnow turns to Plaintiffs’ allegations. \nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants have violated their right to familial association “[b]y \nfailing to take all reasonable efforts towards fostering familial association and securing [them] a \npermanent home and family.”  (ECF No. 1 at 94, ¶ 379.)  Plaintiffs further allege that Defendants \nhave “systematically and improperly intruded upon” their “‘intimate human relationships’ with \ntheir parents, siblings, and other family members.”  (ECF No. 29 at 25.)  Defendants concede \nthat the constitution “may protect some aspects of the parent-child relationship,” but contend those \nprotections  do  not  apply  “to  more  extended  kinship  relationships.”    (ECF  No.  18  at  21.)  \nDefendants also argue that the constitution does not require them “to ensure a particular type of \nfamily life,” nor does it guarantee the “right to a permanent home and family.”  (Id.)  The Court \nagrees. \nFor starters, nothing in the First or Fourteenth Amendments require Defendants to nurture \nPlaintiffs’ familial relationships.  Marisol A., 929 F. Supp. at 676 (“[C]ourts . . . have been loathe \nto impose a constitutional obligation on the state to ensure a particular type of family life.”).  \n23 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 24 of 43 PageID #: 13026\nThese  Amendments  instead  work  as  negative  prohibitions  on  the  government,  providing \n“constitutional shelter” “against undue intrusion by the State.”  Roberts, 468 U.S. at 617–18, 619.  \nPlaintiffs resist this conclusion with an implicit reliance on DeShaney.  Specifically, Plaintiffs \nargue that Defendants have “remov[ed] [Plaintiffs] from their homes,” “thereby forming a ‘special \nrelationship’ with [Plaintiffs].”  (ECF No. 29 at 26.)  Because of this “special relationship,” \nPlaintiffs  believe  they  are  constitutionally  entitled  to  services  that  “foster[]  [their]  familial \nassociation” and “secur[e] [them] a permanent home and family.”  (ECF No. 1 at 94, ¶ 379.)  \nNegative prohibitions on state action afford no such entitlement.7  Neither the Supreme Court nor \nthe Fourth Circuit have broached—much less recognized—this affirmative duty.  The Court \ndeclines to do so today. \nPlaintiffs have also failed to allege that Defendants improperly intruded on their parent-\nchild relationships.  To be clear, “[t]he bonds between parent and child are, in a word, sacrosanct, \nand the relationship between parent and child inviolable except for the most compelling reasons.”  \nJordan by Jordan v. Jackson, 15 F.3d 333, 343 (4th Cir. 1994).  The Supreme Court has said, \nhowever, that States’ “parens patriae interest in preserving and promoting the welfare of the child” \nis a sufficiently compelling reason to justify State interference.  Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. \n745, 766 (1982).  Such is the case here.  Defendants, acting according to state law, properly \nremoved Plaintiffs from their parents’ care to prevent further abuse and neglect.  Plaintiffs do not \ncontend otherwise, so the Court is left with the inevitable conclusion that their removal was \n \n7 Even if DeShaney did impose some affirmative duty on Defendants—a proposition the Court seriously doubts—\nYoungberg makes clear that Defendants need not “choose between attacking every aspect of a problem or not attacking \nthe problem at all.”  Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 317.  Thus, Defendant’s decision to remove a child to prevent abuse \nand neglect would not create a corresponding constitutional duty to ensure that the child is later provided a permanent \nhome. \n24 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 25 of 43 PageID #: 13027\nconstitutional.  The only lingering issue then is whether Defendants have “improperly intruded \nupon” “Plaintiffs’ ‘intimate human relationships’ with their parents” post-removal.  (ECF No. 29 \nat 25.)  Interestingly enough, not a single Plaintiff wishes to be placed back in their parents’ \ncustody.  The 105-page Complaint is entirely devoid of a single allegation that any Plaintiff was \never denied contact with, or access to, their parents.  Plaintiffs have thus failed to allege a violation \nof their right to familial association with their parents. \nNor have Plaintiffs adequately alleged that Defendants violated their right to familial \nassociation with their siblings.    Plaintiffs  make a  compassionate  argument that Defendants \nunnecessarily separate Plaintiffs from their siblings, oftentimes failing to arrange any visitation or \ncommunication between them.  (ECF No. 1 at 21–22, ¶ 71.)  Unfortunately for Plaintiffs, the \nconstitution does not, in the foster care context, protect the sibling-sibling relationship.  While \nmapping out the boundaries of the “constitutional shelter” afforded to “certain intimate . . . \nrelationships,” the Roberts Court said that its precedent “suggest[s] some relevant limitations on” \nthe right.  Roberts, 468 U.S. at 617, 619.  And that precedent does not extend to the relationship \nbetween siblings.  Nearly all the cases Roberts cited, many of which were substantive due process \ncases, involved relationships far more intimate than that between siblings—namely, marriage and \nthe parent-child relationship.  Id. at 618–20 (collecting cases).  The lone case Roberts cited that \nwent further was Moore, which simply allowed a grandmother to live with her grandson because \ngrandparents—much like parents—have traditionally played a vital role in childrearing.  Moore, \n431 U.S. at 504–05.  The Court thinks Moore is too thin a reed to justify extending constitutional \nprotection beyond its current, fixed boundaries.8   \n \n8 While Roberts did provide factors to consider when determining whether to extend First Amendment protection to \ndifferent relationships, Roberts, 468 U.S. at 619–20, the Court is unconvinced that the sibling-sibling relationship \n25 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 26 of 43 PageID #: 13028\nEven if the Constitution did generally protect the relationship between siblings, that \nprotection would not apply in the foster care context.  Roberts and Moore both recognized that \nstates  may  have  a  sufficiently  compelling  interest  that  justifies  interference  with  familial \nrelationships.  Roberts, 468 U.S. at 617–18; Moore, 431 U.S. at 499.  Here, West Virginia has a \ncompelling parens patriae interest in preventing Plaintiffs’ abuse and neglect.  Lassiter v. Dep’t \nof Soc. Servs. of Durham Cnty., 452 U.S. 18, 27 (1981) (“State[s] ha[ve] an urgent interest in the \nwelfare of the[ir] child[ren].”); Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 649 (1972) (“The State[] [has a] \nright—indeed, duty—to protect [its] minor children.”).  West Virginia’s compelling interest in \nprotecting Plaintiffs’ well-being thus justifies any disruption to Plaintiffs’ relationships with their \nsiblings.  In other words, even if the constitution did apply to the sibling-sibling relationship, \nintruding on that relationship in the foster care context would not be “undue” given the State’s \ncompelling, countervailing interest.  Roberts, 468 U.S. at 617–18; Moore, 431 U.S. at 499. \nFinally, Plaintiffs’ claim for interference with their grandparent-grandchild relationships is \nforeclosed by Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000) (plurality opinion).  In Troxel, a mother \nsought to limit visitation time between her children and their paternal grandparents.  Id. at 60–61.  \nWhen the grandparents petitioned for more visitation time than the mother permitted, the Court \nsquarely rejected their efforts to override the mother’s decision.  Id. at 61, 72.  The Court, citing \nPierce, explained that “parents and guardians” of young children have a constitutional right “to \ndirect the upbringing . . . of children under their control.”  Id. at 65 (emphasis added).  This \n \nmeets this criteria.  Siblings certainly have “deep attachments” to one another, but they lack other critical attributes \nRoberts found necessary for constitutional protection.   For instance, siblings are not secluded from others in critical \naspects of their relationship in the same way as spouses, nor do they share distinctively personal aspects of their lives \nas a parent does with their child.  Roberts explained that only certain intimate relationships receive constitutional \nprotection, and the Court is unpersuaded that the sibling-sibling relationship is sufficiently similar to those the \nSupreme Court has previously protected.  Roberts, 468 U.S. at 617–18. \n26 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 27 of 43 PageID #: 13029\nincludes the right “to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children.”  \nId. at 66.  In light of this well-established precedent, the Court concluded that the grandparents \nhad no right to challenge the mother’s decision.   Id. at 69–70.   \nTroxel is persuasive, if not controlling.  Plaintiffs’ biological parents would typically be \nthe ones to decide every aspect of Plaintiffs’ relationships with their grandparents.  Everything \nfrom whether Plaintiffs would live with their grandparents—or have no communication at all—\nwould normally be their parents’ decision alone.  But their parental rights have been judicially \nterminated,  and  Defendants  have  stepped  into  their  shoes  as  Plaintiffs’  legal  guardians.  \nDefendants thus have “the right, coupled with the high duty,” to nurture Plaintiffs and “direct \nthe[ir] upbringing.”  Troxel, 530 U.S. at 65 (quoting Pierce, 268 U.S. at 535).  This includes the \nright to restrict contact with their grandparents.  Make no bones about it, however—cutting off all \ncontact between foster children and their grandparents during this low point in their young lives is \nunfathomable.  But it is not unconstitutional.  The Court GRANTS Defendants’ Motion to \nDismiss Count II. \nC.  Count III – Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act \nIn Count III, Plaintiffs bring a § 1983 claim, alleging Defendants violated the Adoption \nAssistance and Child Welfare Act (“AACWA”).  “Section 1983 imposes liability on anyone who, \nunder color of state law, deprives a person of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the \nConstitution and laws.”  Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 340 (1997) (internal quotation \nmarks  omitted).    Importantly,  litigants  invoking  §  1983  “must  assert  the  violation  of  a \nfederal right, not merely a violation of federal law.”  Id. (emphasis in original).  This distinction \ngives rise to the parties’ next disagreement: Plaintiffs allege Defendants violated their rights under \n27 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 28 of 43 PageID #: 13030\ncertain sections of the AACWA; Defendants counter that those sections do not confer privately \nenforceable rights. \na.  An Overview of the AACWA \n Enacted pursuant to the Spending Clause, the AACWA created “a federal reimbursement \nprogram for certain expenses incurred by the States in administering foster care and adoption \nservices.”  Suter v. Artist M., 503 U.S. 347, 350–51, 356 (1992).  States become eligible for \nreimbursement by satisfying certain requirements.  As relevant here, States must submit to the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services a plan for foster care and adoption assistance.  42 U.S.C. \n§ 671(a).  This plan must include 16 different features before the Secretary will approve it.  Id.  \nPlaintiffs’ claim focuses on two.  First, § 671(a)(10) requires the plan to  \nestablish[]  and  maintain[]  standards  for foster  family  homes and child care \ninstitutions  which  are  reasonably  in  accord  with  recommended  standards  of \nnational organizations concerned with standards for the institutions or homes, \nincluding standards related to admission policies, safety, sanitation, and protection \nof civil rights, and which shall permit use of the reasonable and prudent parenting \nstandard. \n \nSecond, § 671(a)(16) requires the plan to \nprovide[] for the development of a case plan (as defined in section 675(1) of this \ntitle and in accordance with the requirements of section 675a of this title) for \neach child receiving foster care maintenance payments under the State plan and \nprovides for a case review system which meets the requirements described in \nsections 675(5) and 675a of this title with respect to each such child. \n \nThe cross-references in § 671(a)(16) are definitional, none of which are particularly relevant to the \ncurrent dispute.  Section 675(1) defines “case plan,” § 675(5) defines “case review system,” and \n§ 675a further defines the requirements for case plans and case review systems.   \n  The State is not home free once the Secretary approves its plan.  Following approval, the \nSecretary continues to monitor the State’s compliance with § 671(a).  42 U.S.C. § 1320a-2a.  \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 29 of 43 PageID #: 13031\nShould the Secretary find that the State is not upholding its end of the bargain, he must withhold \nfunding.  Id.; 45 C.F.R. §§ 1355.35(c)(4), 1355.36(b).  Importantly, the State is not required to \nbe perfect; it need only “substantial[ly] conform[]” to § 671(a)’s requirements.  42 U.S.C. § \n1320a-2a.   \nb.  Fourth Circuit Precedent \nThe Fourth Circuit has previously considered whether § 671(a)(10) and § 671(a)(16) create \nprivately enforceable rights, so the Court finds it best to begin there. \ni.  Section 671(a)(10) \nThe Fourth Circuit addressed § 671(a)(10) in White by White v. Chambliss, 112 F.3d 731 \n(4th Cir. 1997).  There, a mother was suspected of child abuse, so the Department of Social \nServices (“DSS”) took her children into protective custody.  White, 112 F.3d at 734.  Once in \nprotective custody, DSS placed the children in various foster homes.  Id.  One placement proved \ntragic—the child died at the hands of her foster parents.  Id. at 735.  The mother sued DSS \nofficials, claiming they violated her daughter’s “right to protection” under § 671(a)(10).  Id. at \n738.  The Fourth Circuit disagreed.  Id.  Relying on Suter, a then-recent Supreme Court opinion \nthat analyzed other subsections of § 671(a), the panel held that § 671(a)(10) does not create a \nprivately enforceable right.  Id. at 739.   \nPlaintiffs  ignore  White  entirely,  urging  the  Court  to  nevertheless  find  a  privately \nenforceable right under § 671(a)(10).  (ECF No. 29 at 32–34.)  The Court is not at liberty to do \nso.  United States v. Cobb, 274 F. Supp. 3d 390, 394 (S.D. W. Va. 2017) (“[A] district court is \nbound by the precedent set by its Circuit Court of Appeals, until such precedent is overruled by \nthe appellate court or the United States Supreme Court.”).  Plaintiffs offer no reason to believe \n29 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 30 of 43 PageID #: 13032\nthat White is no longer good law.  As such, the Court concludes that § 671(a)(10) does not create \na privately enforceable right. \nii.  Section 671(a)(16) \nThe Fourth Circuit’s jurisprudence on § 671(a)(16) is anything but cut-and-dry.  The Court \nfirst grappled with § 671(a)(16) in L.J. by and Through Darr v. Massinga, 838 F.2d 118 (4th Cir. \n1988) (L.J. II).  L.J. II involved a class action of children in Baltimore’s foster care system.  Id. \nat 119.  The plaintiffs alleged the city’s poor administration of the foster care system resulted in \ntheir abuse.  Id.  On appeal, the Baltimore defendants argued that §§ 671(a)(9), (10), and (16) of \nthe AACWA  were not privately  enforceable.9   Id. at 123.    The  Fourth Circuit disagreed, \nreasoning that “[t]aken together . . . these statutory provisions spell out a standard of conduct, and \nas a corollary rights in plaintiffs, which plaintiffs have alleged have been denied.”  Id.  Thus, it \noriginally appeared that § 671(a)(16) was privately enforceable. \nSubsequent decisions soon began eroding L.J. II’s holding.  In Suter, the Supreme Court \nconsidered whether certain portions of the AACWA were privately enforceable.  Suter, 503 U.S. \nat 350–51.  The Court spent the bulk of its analysis determining that § 671(a)(15) was not \nprivately enforceable, but its conclusion on § 671(a)(9) was equally clear—§ 671(a)(9) “does not \nafford a cause of action.”  Id. at 259 n.10.  Then, in White, the Fourth Circuit further undermined \nL.J. II when it held that “[§] 671(a)(10) does not create an enforceable right.”  White, 112 F.3d at \n739.  Suter and White thus eliminated two of the three sections L.J. II relied on when it concluded \nthat §§ 671(a)(9), (10), and (16)—when “taken together”—create a privately enforceable right.  \nSee L.J. II, 838 F.2d at 123. \n \n9 Section 671(a)(9) requires States to “report to an appropriate agency or official, known or suspected instances of \nphysical or mental injury, sexual abuse or exploitation, or negligent treatment or maltreatment of a child.”  \n30 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 31 of 43 PageID #: 13033\nThe Fourth Circuit then revisited § 671(a)(16) in L.J. v. Wilbon, 633 F.3d 297 (4th Cir. \n2011).  This time, the Baltimore defendants tried to invalidate a consent decree they entered \nfollowing the L.J. II decision.  Id. at 301–02.  The Baltimore defendants attacked the consent \ndecree by arguing that Suter had overruled L.J. II, thereby eliminating any legal basis for the \nconsent decree.  Id. at 308.  This argument relied on dicta from Suter that suggested the States \nneed only “have a plan approved by the Secretary which contains the 16 listed features.”  Suter, \n503 U.S. at 358.  So long as the States had cleared that low bar, the AACWA as a whole was not \nprivately enforceable.  See id.  There were only two problems.  First, Congress rejected this \ndicta following Suter.  42 U.S.C. 1320a-2 (rejecting the notion that a statute is “unenforceable \nbecause of its inclusion in a section . . . requiring a State plan or specifying the required contents \nof a State plan.”).10  Second, the Court applied the “law of the case doctrine,” which requires prior \ndecisions to govern the same issues at all stages of the case, unless they had been overruled or \nproven clearly wrong.  Wilbon, 633 F.3d at 308.  The Fourth Circuit thus rejected the Baltimore \ndefendants’ argument because they “failed to meet the[ir] burden of showing that . . . L.J. II ha[d] \nbeen overruled by Suter.”  Id.  Notably, the Court did not reaffirm its prior holding in L.J II.  The \nCourt instead made “clear [that it did] not [then] hold that § 671(a)(16) provides a private right of \naction.”  Id. at 312.   \nThe parties here dispute whether the Court is bound by L.J. II.  Defendants argue that Suter \nand White “clearly . . . abrogated” L.J. II such that it does not bind the Court.  (ECF No. 18 at 29.)  \nPlaintiffs, on the other hand, contend that Wilbon’s refusal to hold that “L.J. II has been overruled \n \n10 Importantly, however, Congress did not “alter the holding in [Suter] that [§] 671(a)(15) . . . is not enforceable in a \nprivate right of action.”  Id.   \n31 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 32 of 43 PageID #: 13034\nby Suter” compels the Court to apply L.J. II.  (ECF No. 29 at 28.)  Plaintiffs also claim that \nDefendants are making “an identical argument” to the one Wilbon rejected.  (Id. at 30.)  Not so. \nDefendants’ position here is easily distinguishable from the Baltimore defendants in \nWilbon.  As noted above, the Baltimore defendants argued that Suter overruled L.J. II when it said \nthat a plan need only satisfy § 671(a)’s 16 requirements.  The Fourth Circuit, following Congress’ \nlead, rejected this argument.  Here, Defendants are making a fundamentally different one: that \nL.J. II does not bind the Court since Suter and White eliminated two of three provisions L.J. II \nfound, “taken together,” create a privately enforceable right.  And that, coupled with the Fourth \nCircuit making “clear [that the Court] do[es] not now hold that § 671(a)(16) provides a private \nright of action,” Wilbon, 633 F.3d at 312, proves that L.J. II did not survive those later cases.  The \nCourt agrees.  Just as a milking stool cannot stand having lost two of its three legs, L.J. II’s \nconclusion that § 671(a)(16) creates a privately enforceable right cannot stand in light of Suter and \nWhite.11  The Court must therefore start from scratch, determining for itself whether § 671(a)(16) \nis privately enforceable. \nc.  § 671(a)(16) is not privately enforceable \n“[U]nless Congress speak[s] with a clear voice, and manifests an unambiguous intent to \ncreate individually enforceable rights, federal funding provisions provide no basis for private \nenforcement by § 1983.”  Hensley v. Koller, 722 F.3d 177, 181 (4th Cir. 2013) (alteration in \noriginal) (quoting Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 280 (2002)).  In Blessing v. Freestone, \n520 U.S. 329 (1997), the Supreme Court articulated a three-factor test to determine whether \n \n11 This conclusion is only bolstered by Wilbon’s recognition that, rather than finding a right by cobbling different \nsections together, courts must instead perform “a section-specific inquiry” to determine whether that particular section \nis privately enforceable.  Wilbon, 633 F.3d at 309. \n32 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 33 of 43 PageID #: 13035\nCongress unambiguously intended “a particular statutory provision [to create] a federal right” \nprivately enforceable under [] § 1983.  Id. at 340.  The Blessing test caused confusion in the \nlower courts  and, for  a moment, established “a relatively loose standard for  finding rights \nenforceable by § 1983.”  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 282.  The Supreme Court promptly rejected this \nlaxed standard in Gonzaga when it held that nothing “short of an unambiguously conferred right” \ncan support a § 1983 claim.  Id. at 283.  Gonzaga instructs courts to analyze the “text and \nstructure of [the] statute” to discern whether “Congress intend[ed] to create new individual rights.”  \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 286.  When doing so, courts should consider whether the statute uses \n“rights-creating language,” has an aggregate, rather than individual, focus, and whether Congress \nprovided a federal review mechanism.  See id. at 287–88, 289–90. \nPlaintiffs here contend that § 671(a)(16)’s focus on “each child” unambiguously creates a \nprivately enforceable, one the Court should not render “illusory.”  (ECF No. 29 at 29–30.)  \nDefendants, on the other hand, argue that § 671(a)(16) speaks in terms of institutional practices \nand lacks rights-creating language, which precludes a finding of private enforceability.  (ECF No. \n18 at 24–25.) \nNone  of  the  three  considerations  Gonzaga  used  to  determine  whether  Congress \nunambiguously conferred a right weigh in Plaintiffs’ favor.  First, § 671(a)(16) does not feature \nthe rights-creating language Congress typically uses when creating privately enforceable rights.  \nThe Supreme Court has explained that rights-creating language focuses on “the individuals \nprotected” instead of “the person regulated.”  Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 289 (2001).  \nPut differently, rights-creating language is “individually focused.”  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 287.  \nHere, § 671(a)(16) clearly focuses on Defendants, who it regulates, rather than Plaintiffs, who \n33 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 34 of 43 PageID #: 13036\nstand to benefit.  Section 671(a)(16) does nothing more than tell Defendants what their plan must \ninclude before the Secretary can approve it.  If Defendants’ plan “provides for the development \nof a case plan” and “a case review system” for “each child” in West Virginia’s foster care system, \nDefendants will receive federal funding.  If not, they will not.   \nSection 671(a)(16) stands in stark contrast to statutes that do use rights-creating language.  \nTake Title VI for instance.  It provides that “[n]o person . . . shall, on the ground of race, color, or \nnational origin . . . be subjected to discrimination.”  42 U.S.C. § 2000d.  Title IX uses near-\nidentical language: “No person . . . shall, on the basis of sex . . . be subjected to discrimination.”  \n20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  Congress could have easily written § 671(a)(16) in a similar fashion, using \nan individual focus.  Congress could have said, for example, that “each child shall have a case \nplan and a case review system.”  Such “individually focused terminology,” “phrased in terms of \nthe person[] benefitted,” would have shown congressional intent to create an individual right.  \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284, 287.  But Congress chose not to focus on the individual.  And since \nCongress “knows how to . . . expressly” “create a private cause of action” when it wants, Carey v. \nThrowe, 957 F.3d 468, 479 (4th Cir. 2020), § 671(a)(16)’s focus on the person regulated is telling. \nPlaintiffs resist this conclusion, arguing that § 671(a)(16)’s requirement of a case plan and \ncase review system for “each child” shows an unmistakable focus on the individual.  (ECF No. \n29 at 29.)  Plaintiffs essentially ask the Court to read the phrase “each child” out of context, which \nthe Court cannot do.  When interpreting statutes, the Court cannot “construe statutory phrases in \nisolation.”  United States v. Morton, 467 U.S. 822, 828 (1984).  The Court must instead read the \nstatutory provision as a whole.  Id.  When the Court reads § 671(a)(16) as whole, as it did above, \nthere is but one conclusion: the statute focuses on the person regulated, not the individual \n34 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 35 of 43 PageID #: 13037\nbenefited.  Plaintiffs’ reading may very well hold water when done “in a vacuum,” Sturgeon v. \nFrost, 577 U.S. 424, 438 (2016), but it becomes simply “untenable in light of [§ 671(a)(16)] as a \nwhole.”  King v. Burwell, 576 U.S. 473, 497 (2015) (quoting Dep’t of Revenue of Or. v. ACF \nIndus., Inc., 510 U.S. 332, 343 (1994)).   \nSecond, § 671(a)(16) focuses on the aggregate, not the individual.  Statutes with an \n“aggregate,” rather than individual, focus “cannot ‘give rise to individual rights.’”  Gonzaga, 536 \nU.S. at 288 (quoting Blessing, 520 U.S. at 344).  The tell-tale sign of a statute with an aggregate \nfocus is one that is “not concerned with ‘whether the needs of any particular person have been \nsatisfied.’”  Id. at 288 (emphasis added) (quoting Blessing, 520 U.S. at 343).  The Supreme Court \nhas twice dealt with statutes that, like § 671(a)(16), did not require perfect performance by the \nStates.    Neither  conferred  an  individual  right.    In  Blessing,  the  statute  at  issue  required \n“substantial compliance.”  Blessing, 520 U.S. at 335.  The Blessing Court said that “[f]ar from \ncreating an individual entitlement to services, the [substantial compliance] standard is simply a \nyardstick . . . to measure the systemwide performance.”  Id. (emphasis in original).  Likewise in \nGonzaga, the Court found that a similar “substantial compliance” requirement was concerned with \n“polic[ies] and practice[s], not individual[s].”  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 288.  Section 671(a)(16) is \nno different.  While § 671(a)(16) imposes a clear obligation on Defendants, they need not comply \nwith it in every individual case—they need only substantially conform to § 671(a)(16) to receive \nfunding.  42  U.S.C.  §  1320a-2a.    Put  differently,  so  long  as  Defendants’  system—as  an \naggregate—substantially complies with § 671(a)(16), the Secretary has no cause for concern.  The \nCourt is therefore satisfied that § 671(a)(16) has an aggregate, rather than individual, focus. \n35 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 36 of 43 PageID #: 13038\nThird, § 671(a)(16) provides a federal review mechanism to enforce its requirements, \nwhich further cuts against private enforceability.  Congress required the Secretary to promulgate \nregulations to review AACWA programs implemented by the States.  42 U.S.C. § 1320a-2a.  The \nSecretary has done so.  45 C.F.R. §§ 1355.35(c)(4), 1355.36(b).  This review mechanism, as \npreviously explained, exists to ensure substantial compliance.  Should a State fail to substantially \ncomply, the Secretary withholds funding.  This, too, is a night-and-day difference from the few \nSpending Clause statutes the Supreme Court has concluded confer individual rights.  See Wilder \nv. Va. Hosp. Ass’n., 496 U.S. 498 (1990); Wright v. Roanoke Redevelopment & Housing Authority, \n479 U.S. 418 (1987).  In each case, the Court relied in large part on the fact that the statute lacked \nsufficient means of enforcement.  Wilder, 496 U.S. at 522–23; Wright, 479 U.S. at 426; see also \nGonzaga,  536  U.S.  at 289–90  (noting  that  Congress’  decision  to  provide  a  federal  review \nmechanism “counsel[s] against . . . finding a congressional intent to create individually enforceable \nprivate rights.”).  But here, Congress enabled the Secretary to withhold federal funding, thereby \nensuring that § 671(a)(16) is anything but “a dead letter.”  Suter, 503 U.S. at 360–01.   \nSince Congress has not “spok[en] with a clear voice” and “manifest[ed] an ‘unambiguous’ \nintent to confer [an] individual right[],” Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 280, the Court finds that § 671(a)(16) \nis not privately enforceable.  Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Count III is GRANTED. \nD.  Counts IV & V – Americans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act \nPlaintiffs’ Counts IV and V allege violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nthe Rehabilitation Act, respectively.  The parties address the two claims as one, and the Court \nfollows suit.  See e.g., Halpern v. Wake Forest Univ. Health Scis., 669 F.3d 454, 461 (4th Cir. \n2012) (construing “the ADA and Rehabilitation Act to impose similar requirements.”). \n36 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 37 of 43 PageID #: 13039\na.  Governing Law \nTitle II of the Americans with Disabilities Act provides that “no qualified individual with \na disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the \nbenefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination \nby any such entity.”12  42 U.S.C. § 12132.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act similarly \nprovides that “[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of \nher or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected \nto discrimination under any program” that receives federal funds.13  29 U.S.C. § 794.   \nTitle  II  and  §  504  do  more  than  share  similar  language—they  also  impose  similar \nrequirements.  Halpern, 669 F.3d at 461.  One such requirement is the “integration mandate.”  \nPublic entities must “administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting \nappropriate to the needs of qualified individuals.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d); see also 34 C.F.R. § \n104.4(b)(2) (imposing a similar integration requirement).  Federal regulations define the “most \nintegrated setting appropriate to the needs of [the] individual[]” as one that “enables individuals \n \n12 A “public entity” is defined as “any State or local government” or “any department, agency, special purpose district, \nor other instrumentality of a State . . . or local government.”  42 U.S.C. § 12131(1)(A)–(B).  Also, a “qualified \nindividual with a disability” “means an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable modifications to \nrules, policies, or practices, the removal of architectural, communication, or transportation barriers, or the provision \nof auxiliary aids and services, meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the participation \nin programs or activities provided by a public entity.”  Id. § 12131(2).  Defendants do not dispute that they are \ncovered by the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, nor do they challenge whether Plaintiffs are qualified individuals under \nthe statutes. \n13 The Fourth Circuit has interpreted these to require a three-part showing by litigants bringing Title II and \nRehabilitation Act claims.  Constantine v. Rectors & Visitors of George Mason Univ., 411 F.3d 474, 498 (4th Cir. \n2005).  Plaintiffs must show that they (1) have a disability; (2) are otherwise qualified to receive the benefits of the \ngovernment program; and (3) were excluded from the program because of their disability.  Id.  Defendants concede \nPlaintiffs meet the first two requirements, but argue Plaintiffs have not alleged discrimination on the basis of their \ndisabilities.  (See ECF No. 29 at 31.)  As such, the Court cabins its inquiry to whether Plaintiffs have alleged \ndisability-based discrimination.  The Court also notes that Title II and § 504 have different causation standards, \nHalpern, 669 F.3d at 461–62, but believes that this is a non-issue here, as Plaintiffs’ Complaint easily meets both \nstandards.  \n37 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 38 of 43 PageID #: 13040\nwith disabilities to interact with nondisabled persons to the fullest extent possible.”  28 C.F.R. pt. \n35, app. B.    Public entities must also abide by the “reasonable modification” requirement.  \n“A public entity shall make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when \nthe modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability.”  28 C.F.R. § \n35.130(b)(7)(i).  This latter command has a caveat.  A modification is not required if “the public \nentity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the \nservice, program, or activity.”  Id.   \nThe Supreme Court interpreted these requirements in Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 \nU.S. 581 (1999), where it held that the unnecessary institutionalization of individuals with mental \ndisabilities is discrimination under Title II.  In Olmstead, the plaintiffs, two mentally disabled \nwomen, were institutionalized for psychiatric  treatment.    Id.  at 593.    Their condition later \nimproved, but they remained institutionalized, despite being approved for treatment in community-\nbased  settings.    Id.    The  plaintiffs  alleged  that  defendants’  “failure  to  place  [them]  in  a \ncommunity-based program” violated the integration mandate, thus constituting discrimination \nunder Title II.  Id. at 594.  The defendants fought this, arguing that the plaintiffs had not been \ndiscriminated  against  because  “no  similarly  situated  individuals  [were]  given  preferential \ntreatment” in placement decisions.  Id. at 598.   \nThe Court rejected the defendants’ narrow reading of Title II because “Congress had a \nmore comprehensive view . . . of discrimination” when it enacted the ADA.  Id. at 598.  Title II \nis not, as the defendants believed, limited to only those instances of “uneven treatment [among] \nsimilarly  situated  individuals.”    Id.    Title  II  instead  encompasses  the  unjustified \ninstitutionalization  of  the  mentally  disabled.    See  id.    The  Court  reasoned  that  unjustified \n38 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 39 of 43 PageID #: 13041\ninstitutionalization creates “[d]issimilar treatment” because the mentally disabled must “relinquish \n[their ability to] participat[e] in community life” “to receive needed medical services.”  Id. at 601.  \n“[P]ersons without mental disabilities,” on the other hand, “can receive the medical services they \nneed without similar sacrifice.”  Id.  Title II thus requires public entities to provide individuals \nwith mental disabilities community-based treatment when appropriate.14  Id. at 600. \nThe integration mandate, however, is not an immediate, unyielding command.  The Court \nrecognized that “States [may] resist modifications that entail a “fundamenta[l] alter[ation]” of the \nStates' services and programs.”  Id. at 603 (some alterations in original).  This “fundamental-\nalteration” defense, the Court said, “allow[s] . . . State[s] to show that, in the allocation of available \nresources, immediate relief for the plaintiffs would be inequitable” because of prior commitments \nto the many other mentally disabled individuals to whom the State must provide care.  Id. at 604.  \nThis  standard  would  be  met,  for  instance,  if  a  “State  [could]  demonstrate  that  it  had  a \ncomprehensive, effectively working plan for placing qualified persons with mental disabilities in \nless restrictive settings, and a waiting list that moved at a reasonable pace.”  Id. at 605–06.  If so, \n“court[s] would have no warrant” to bump “persons at the top of the community-based treatment \nwaiting list” in favor of “individuals lower down who commenced civil actions.”  Id. at 606. \nb.  Analysis \nPlaintiffs  allege  Defendants  have  discriminated  against  them  in  two  ways.    First, \nDefendants offer “intensive mental health services” “almost exclusively in institutional settings \nrather than in the community.”  (ECF No. 1 at 78–79, ¶ 323.)  This, in and of itself, Plaintiffs say \n \n14 When determining whether community-based care is appropriate for any particular individual, the Court held that \n“State[s] generally may rely on the reasonable assessments of [their] own professionals in determining whether an \nindividual” should be placed in a community-based setting.  Id. at 602.  “Absent such [a finding], it would be \ninappropriate to remove a patient from the more restrictive setting.”  Id.   \n39 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 40 of 43 PageID #: 13042\nis  discriminatory  because  it  results  in  Plaintiffs’  unnecessary  institutionalization.    (See  id.)  \nSecond, Plaintiffs allege Defendants do not provide sufficient mental health services and disability \nsupports—in other words, reasonable accommodations—necessary for Plaintiffs to receive the full \nbenefits of the foster care system.  (Id. at 77–79, ¶ 318–27.)  Defendants launch a litany of attacks \nat  these  claims.    First,  Defendants  say  they  never  discriminated  against  Plaintiffs  because \n“shortcomings in the State’s community-based mental health care system” affect everyone equally.  \n(ECF No. 18 at 31–32.)  Second, Defendants argue they are not required to “provide a certain \nlevel of benefits” or services to Plaintiffs.  (Id.)  Third, Defendants claim that the integration \nmandate is inapplicable here because the best-interest-of-the-child standard trumps federal law \nwhen it comes to determining Plaintiffs’ placements.  (Id. at 33.)  Fourth, Defendants claim there \nare no unjustified placements because “each and every placement has been approved by a state \ncircuit court as in the best interest of the child.”  (Id. at 33–34.)  Fifth, and finally, Defendants \nsay that even if the integration mandate does apply, they have a “‘comprehensive, effectively \nworking plan’ to ensure children with disabilities are placed in the least restrictive settings.”  (Id. \nat 34–38.)  Defendants’ efforts fall flat. \nOlmstead rejected Defendants’ first argument.  Discrimination under Title II is not limited \nto the “uneven treatment of similarly situated individuals.”  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 598.  Instead, \nTitle II discrimination includes the “unjustified institutional[ization]” of persons with mental \ndisabilities.  Id. at 600.  Defendants’ argument is thus beside the point: it does not matter that \neveryone in their custody is needlessly institutionalized.  Title II simply requires a showing that \nPlaintiffs have been “unjustifi[ably] institutional[ized]” when a less restrictive placement would \nhave been appropriate.  Id. at 598.  The Complaint is riddled with these claims.   \n40 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 41 of 43 PageID #: 13043\nDefendants’ second argument rests on a faulty reading of Olmstead.  Specifically, they \nhone in on language from a footnote where the Court said that the ADA does not require states to \n“provide a certain level of benefits to individuals with disabilities.”  (ECF No. 18 at 32–33) \n(quoting Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 603 n.14.)  The very next sentence in that footnote, however, says, \n“that States must adhere to the ADA's nondiscrimination requirement with regard to the services \nthey in fact provide.”  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 603 n.14.  Defendants here offer a service—the \nfoster  care  system—to  Plaintiffs.    And  when  offering  this  service,  Defendants  must  make \nreasonable modifications so that Plaintiffs can fully participate in it.  Requiring Defendants to \nprovide Plaintiffs with mental health services and disability supports is entirely consistent with \nthis mandate—these services are necessary for Plaintiffs to participate in the foster care system, \nand they are not entirely new, stand-alone programs.  Compare Townsend v. Quasim, 328 F.3d \n511 (9th Cir. 2003), with Rodriguez v. City of New York, 197 F.3d 611 (2d Cir. 1999). \nDefendants’ third argument is even less persuasive.  Defendants claim that Plaintiffs are \nputting Title II and § 504 “on a collision course with” child welfare jurisprudence by asking for \nplacements in less restrictive settings.  (ECF No. 35 at 19.)  This argument relies on a cherry-\npicked reading of the integration mandate: that “plac[ing] all children with disabilities in the ‘most \nintegrated setting’ regardless of the individual circumstances of the case” would be contrary to the \nchild’s best interest.  (ECF No. 18 at 33.)  Defendants conveniently ignore the integration \nmandate’s qualifying language—“the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of [the] \nqualified individual[].”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d) (emphasis added).  Nothing in this mandate \nconflicts with the best-interest-of-the-child standard; the two exist in perfect harmony.  The \nintegration mandate simply requires Defendants to make available “a range of facilities for the \n41 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 300   Filed 01/13/23   Page 42 of 43 PageID #: 13044\ncare and treatment of persons with diverse mental disabilities.”  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 597.  \nFrom this range of placement options, state court judges select the one they determine is in the \nchild’s best interest.  See W. Va. Code § 49-4-608(e).  The integration mandate does not, as \nDefendants believe, force anyone to place Plaintiffs in “an inappropriate setting.”  Olmstead, 527 \nU.S. at 605; see also 28 C.F.R. 35.130(e)(1) (allowing qualified individuals to decline benefits \nconferred by the ADA).  It merely requires Defendants to make available placements that would \ntruly be in the child’s best interest. \nDefendants’ fourth argument fares no better.  Defendants claim that Plaintiffs have not \nbeen unjustifiably institutionalized because “each and every placement has been approved by a \nstate circuit court as in the best interest of the child.”  (ECF No. 18 at 33–34.)  This turns a blind \neye to Plaintiffs’ allegations.  The Complaint details a foster care system in utter disarray, where \ninstitutionalization  is  the  default.    (ECF  No.  1  at  85,  ¶  352.)    This  is  not  because \ninstitutionalization is the answer to Plaintiff’s problems; Defendants have simply failed to create \nin-home and community-based treatment settings.  Thus, when placing Plaintiffs, state courts had \nno choice but to institutionalize them.  To the extent Defendants think these placements were in \nany way “justified” under Olmstead, they are wrong. \nDefendants’ fifth and final argument is nothing more than a last-ditch effort to convince \nthe Court that they have the “comprehensive, effectively working plan” that Olmstead demands.  \n(ECF No. 18 at 34–38.)  Maybe so, but that is a factual determination, which the Court cannot \nmake at the pleading stage.  Matrix Cap. Mgmt. Fund, LP v. BearingPoint, Inc., 576 F.3d 172, \n176 (4th Cir. 2009).

For years, West Virginia’s child welfare system has operated in a state of crisis. \nDuring this time, West Virginia and its Department of Health and Human Resources (“DHHR”), \nthe legal guardian of children in the state’s foster care system, and Bureau for Children and \nFamilies (“BCF”), which is responsible for the fostering and adoption of West Virginian children, \nhave repeatedly failed the children they are charged with protecting.  \n2.  On Defendants’ watch, Plaintiffs, children in West Virginia’s foster care system, \nhave been abused and neglected, put in inadequate and dangerous placements, institutionalized \nand segregated from the outside world, left without necessary services, and forced to unnecessarily \nlanguish in foster care for years. Defendants, well aware of these problems, have answered with \nempty promises and unfulfilled initiatives. Today, West Virginia continues to infringe upon the \nrights of its foster children, jeopardizing their most basic needs.  \n3.  Federal data and reports paint a grim picture of how vulnerable West Virginian \nchildren fare compared to those in the rest of the country. In 2017, the rate of child deaths related \nto abuse and neglect per 100,000 children in West Virginia was more than double the national \naverage. Similarly, the rate of child victims of maltreatment was double the national average. The \nrate of referrals to DHHR for abuse and neglect was over one-and-a-half times the national \naverage. And the rate of child abuse and neglect investigations or assessments was more than triple \nthe national average. Moreover, near fatalities of children known to DHHR due to abuse or neglect \nrose by more than 20 percent per year for four years between 2014 and 2018. \n4.  The number of youth entering the broken West Virginia foster care system has \nskyrocketed in recent years. Between 2013 and 2017, the foster care population swelled by 67 \npercent—substantially higher than the national average increase of 11 percent during the same \n \n2 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 3 of 105 PageID #: 3\nyears.  A  variety  of  factors  played  a  role  in  causing  this  spike.  For  one,  the  opioid  crisis \ndisproportionately affected West Virginia, the 47th poorest state in the nation.  \n5.  West Virginia suffers from the highest age-adjusted rate of drug overdose deaths \ninvolving opioids in the nation. Caregiver addiction and deaths stemming from substance abuse \nhave driven more and more children into the system.  \n6.  In 2018, West Virginia led the nation in the number of removals performed by its \nchild welfare agency, stretching the limits of an already overburdened system. A significant \nportion of these children were teens. As of 2017, the state had the highest rate of foster care entries \nfor youth ages 14 to 17 at 14.2 per 1,000 children, as compared to the national average of 2.8 per \n1,000 children.   \n7.  But Defendants fail to maintain an adequate number of appropriate placements for \nyouth entering foster care in West Virginia. As a result, they resort to quickly placing children into \nkinship placements that are not sufficiently vetted, supported, or monitored to ensure children’s \nsafety and wellbeing while in those placements, or institutionalizing them. DHHR increased their \nreliance upon kinship caregivers by more than 30 percentage points over the last five years. In \nWest Virginia, a disproportionate number of adolescents in foster care are sent to residential \nfacilities: 71 percent of youth between the ages of 12 and 17 are institutionalized. Many of these \nteens are sent to out-of-state facilities that are far from their families and communities. As of June \n2019, DHHR placed 327 foster children in out-of-state institutions. In-state, DHHR placed 588 \nyouth in residential care and 83 in psychiatric facilities. \n8.  West Virginia’s child welfare system is fraught with significant administrative \nproblems that hinder its ability to operate effectively. Although a state-run model, there are \nregional variations in interpretation of policy and practice. A number of staffing challenges also \n \n3 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 4 of 105 PageID #: 4\ncompromise  DHHR’s  ability  to  perform  essential  child  welfare  functions,  such  as  case \nmanagement and permanency planning. For instance, West Virginia has averaged a 23 percent \nvacancy rate for CPS positions—nearly a quarter of its workforce—in recent years.  \n9.  Defendants’ response to identified problems in the child welfare system has been \nslow, indecisive and inadequate. Defendants have failed to strategically address issues facing the \nchild  welfare  system,  thus  causing  further  harm  to  children  while  in  Defendants’  custody. \nSpecifically:   \na.  West Virginia lacks a sufficient number of foster care placements. As a \nresult, DHHR is in a perpetual state of crisis when it has to find placements \nfor  children.  Defendants  regularly  match  children  with  any  available \nplacement regardless of its appropriateness. \nb.  Upon information and belief, West Virginia’s foster care system is so \noverwhelmed, and there is such an acute shortage of adequate foster home \nplacements, that DHHR has segregated children in institutions, lodged \nchildren in temporary shelter care well past the standard time frames, \nrefrained from removing children from known abusive or neglectful homes, \ntemporarily housed children in overcrowded general foster care homes, or \nplaced children in poorly screened kinship foster homes. \nc.  DHHR relies indiscriminately on institutional care for children despite \nextensive  evidence  and  guidance  in  the  child  welfare  field  about  the \nimportance of minimizing institutional care for children as well as federal \nprohibitions on segregating people with disabilities from their homes and \ncommunities. \n \n4 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 5 of 105 PageID #: 5\nd.  West Virginia routinely fails to ensure that children achieve placement \nstability while in foster care. DHHR shuffles children, many of whom have \ncomplex  needs,  from  placement  to  placement  without  engaging  in \nthoughtful placement matching. This instability further traumatizes these \nchildren.  \ne.  West Virginia is also losing track of an alarming number of foster children. \nIn 2018, West Virginia had 791 reported runaways from its foster care \nsystem, and the state is on track to exceed that number in 2019. \nf.  West  Virginia  fails  to  employ  and  retain  a  sufficient  number  of \nappropriately trained caseworkers. DHHR is plagued by high caseworker \nturnover.  DHHR fills the increasing vacancies with unqualified applicants, \nwho have little experience in the field, resulting in diminished caseworker \ncontinuity and inconsistencies in policy interpretation and practice. Further, \nDHHR fails to adequately screen their applicants for criminal backgrounds \nor drug use.  \ng.  Defendants fail to engage in timely and meaningful assessments and case \nplanning, and this all but ensures that the limited resources West Virginia \nmakes available are not used well. \nh.  Many children in foster care do not receive necessary services. Further, \nmany caseworkers have inappropriately heavy caseloads that preclude them \nfrom either developing appropriate case plans or ensuring that necessary \nservices are provided. \ni.  West Virginia has failed to develop a sufficient array of in-home and \n \n5 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 6 of 105 PageID #: 6\ncommunity-based  mental  health  services.  Instead,  the  entire  children’s \nmental health system is centered around placement in segregated residential \ntreatment facilities. \nj.  DHHR fails to engage in critical permanency planning, leaving children to \nlanguish in foster care for years. \nk.  Adolescents in foster care are often forgotten.  Upon information and belief, \ncaseworkers view their permanency planning efforts as futile and make \ninsufficient efforts to develop and implement permanency plans for this \npopulation.  Instead, West Virginia abruptly discharges most of these youth \nfrom  institutional  care  without  proper  planning  or  any  connections  to \nsupportive adult programs. These children lack sufficient educational or \nvocational training that would enable them to achieve a sustainable and safe \nadulthood.  \n10.  The named Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit as a civil rights action on behalf of all \nchildren who are now, or will be, in the custody of DHHR. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and \ninjunctive relief against the Defendants, the state agency and  state officials responsible for \noperating West Virginia’s foster care system, for violating Plaintiffs’ rights under the U.S. \nConstitution and federal laws. Defendants’ actions and inactions have caused chronic and system-\nwide failures in West Virginia’s foster care system—a system intended to protect the state’s most \nvulnerable children.  \n \n \n \n \n6 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 7 of 105 PageID #: 7\nPARTIES \n \nI.

This action arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States, including \n42 U.S.C. § 1983. The Court has jurisdiction over the federal claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 \nand  1343(a),  as  well  as  under  the  Adoption  Assistance  and  Child  Welfare  Act  of  1980 \n(“AACWA”), 42 U.S.C. § 670 et. seq., the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12131(2), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (“Section 504” or “RA”), 29 U.S.C. § 794, and \nthe respective implementing regulations. \n27.  This Court has jurisdiction to issue declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 and Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n28.  Venue in the Huntington Division of the Southern District of West Virginia is \nproper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), because a substantial part of the events and omissions \ngiving rise to the claims herein occurred in the Huntington Division of the Southern District of \nWest Virginia, and three of the named Plaintiffs’ child welfare cases were filed within the \njurisdiction of the Huntington Division of the Southern District of West Virginia. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n \n29.  This action is properly maintained as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and \n23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n30.  This action consists of one major class and three subclasses:  \na.  All children for whom DHHR has or will have legal responsibility and who \nare or will be in the legal and physical custody of DHHR , (“the General Class”); and, as \nsubclasses: \ni.  Children who are or will be in kinship placements, or who were in \nkinship placements that unnecessarily disrupted, for whom DHHR \n \n10 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 11 of 105 PageID #: 11\nis  required  to  provide  initial  home  safety  assessments,  case \nmanagement and other services, and permanency planning (“the \n“Kinship Subclass”).  \nii.  Children who have or will have physical, intellectual, cognitive, or \nmental health disabilities (the “ADA Subclass”).  \niii.  Children who are or will be 14 years old and older, who are eligible \nto receive age-appropriate transition planning but are not provided \nthe necessary case management and services and are therefore at risk \nof aging out  of foster  care without a proper  plan  to  transition \nsuccessfully and safely into adulthood (the “Aging Out Subclass”). \n31.  Each class is sufficiently numerous to make joinder impracticable.  \na.  The General Class consists of approximately 6,800 children who currently \nare in the foster care custody of the West Virginia DHHR.  \nb.  The Kinship Subclass consists of at least 3,400 children who are currently \nin the custody of the West Virginia DHHR. Approximately half of the \nstate’s foster children are placed with relatives or fictive kin.  \nc.  The ADA Subclass consists of over 25 percent of children currently in foster \ncare who  experience physical, intellectual, cognitive, or mental health \nconditions and nearly 950 children who have been segregated in congregate \ncare or psychiatric institutions both in and out of the state. \nd.  The Aging Out Subclass consists of at least 1,600 youth, all of whom are \n14 years of age or older, are in foster care, and to whom DHHR is required \nto provide Transitional Living Services. \n \n11 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 12 of 105 PageID #: 12\n32.  The questions of fact and law raised by named Plaintiffs are common to and \ntypical of those of each putative member of the class and subclasses whom they seek to represent. \n33.  The named Plaintiffs rely on Defendants for foster care services in West Virginia \nand wholly depend on DHHR for provision of those services. \n34.  Defendants’  long-standing  and  well-documented  actions  and  inactions \nsubstantially depart from accepted professional judgment and constitute deliberate indifference to \nthe harm, risk of harm, and violations of legal rights suffered by the named Plaintiffs and the class \nand subclasses they represent. \n35.  Questions of fact common to the classes include: \na.  whether  Defendants  fail  to  protect  the  General  Class  from  physical, \npsychological, and emotional harm, and risk of harm; \nb.  whether  Defendants deprive  Plaintiffs of the Kinship Subclass of necessary \nhome  safety  assessments,  case  management  and  other  services,  and \npermanency planning; \nc.  whether Defendants deprive Plaintiffs of the ADA Subclass of necessary \nand appropriate services and treatment to make them as able as their non-\ndisabled peers to access an  array of community-based placements and \nservices to ensure access to the least restrictive environment; \nd.  whether the Defendants offer supports and caseworker resources adequate \nto ensure that foster children 14 years or older receive transition planning \nsuch that children that age out of the system into adulthood have adequate \nplanning and resources to meet future housing, employment, educational, \nand other social needs.   \n \n12 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 13 of 105 PageID #: 13\ne.  whether the Defendants operate a system that promptly and adequately \nassesses the individual needs of members of the class; \nf.  whether Defendants operate a system that adequately plans placements, \ntreatment, and supports appropriate to the individual needs of the members \nof the class and subclasses; \ng.  whether the Defendants operate a system that provides an adequate diversity \nof placements to permit the members of the class to reside in the most \nintegrated, least restrictive, and most family-like environment;  \nh.  whether the Defendants provide adequate caseworker resources to ensure \nthat members of the class can routinely meet with caseworkers face-to-face \nand engage in individual services; and \n36.  Questions of law common to the classes include: \n \na.  whether Defendants’ systemic failures violate Plaintiffs’ substantive rights \nunder the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution, including exposing children to further neglect, abuse, \nand trauma through unnecessary and too-frequent moves; \nb.  whether  Defendants’  systemic  failures  violate  Plaintiffs’  right  to  all \nreasonable  efforts  to  achieve  permanency,  under  the  First,  Ninth,  and \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, including by \nseparating  them  unnecessarily  from  their  families  and  siblings,  and \nsegregating them in institutions; \nc.  whether Defendants’ systemic failures violate Plaintiffs’ rights under the \nAdoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, as amended by the \n \n13 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 14 of 105 PageID #: 14\nAdoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, including their right to placement \nin  the  least  restrictive,  most  family-like  home  and  their  right  to  all \nreasonable efforts to achieve permanency; and \nd.  whether Defendants’ systemic failures violate Plaintiffs’ rights under the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2), Section \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act (“RA”), 29 U.S.C. § 794, and the respective \nimplementing regulations, including by unnecessarily placing youth with \ndisabilities in institutional settings and denying them access to community-\nbased treatment. \n37.  The violations of law and resulting harms alleged by Plaintiffs are typical of the \nlegal violations and harms and/or risk of harms experienced by all of the children in the class and \nsubclasses. \n38.  The named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class and \nsubclasses that they seek to represent. \n39.  Defendants have acted or failed to act on grounds generally applicable to all \nmembers of the class or, where appropriate, subclasses, necessitating class-wide declaratory and \ninjunctive relief. \n40.  Counsel for Plaintiffs know of no conflict among the class members.   \n41.  The named Plaintiffs are represented by the following attorneys, who are competent \nand experienced in class action litigation, child welfare litigation, and complex civil litigation: \n  Attorneys  from  A  Better  Childhood, Inc.,  a  non-profit  legal  advocacy \norganization, including the Executive Director, Marcia Robinson Lowry, \nwho has extensive experience and expertise in federal child welfare class \n \n14 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 15 of 105 PageID #: 15\nactions throughout the United States, Deputy Director Dawn J Post, who has \nover 16 years of experience in child welfare practice and litigation, and staff \nattorneys Allison Mahoney and Valerie McLaughlin;  \n  Attorneys from Shaffer and Shaffer, PLLC, a full-service West Virginia law \nfirm  with  extensive  experience  in  class  action  litigation  and  matters \ninvolving child abuse and neglect, the ADA, and Section 504 of the RA, \nincluding  senior  associate  Richard  W.

Since she has assumed his case, Ms. Dixon \nhas visited Jonathan, remains in regular communication with him, and is committed to representing  \n \n15 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 16 of 105 PageID #: 16\nhis best interests in this case.   \n43.  Jonathan’s biological parents physically, sexually, and emotionally abused him. \nCPS received a referral and DHHR opened an investigation. While DHHR was conducting their \ninvestigation, Jonathan’s parents relinquished their parental rights through a private adoption they \narranged with a family friend. Upon information and belief, DHHR never verified the suitability \nof the adoptive parents and abruptly closed the incomplete investigation.  \n44.  As a result, DHHR never provided Jonathan or his caregivers with supportive \nservices. Jonathan began struggling with severe depression, suicidal ideations, and aggression \ntowards others. He also began starting fires.  \n45.  In 2013, when Jonathan’s suicidal ideations became particularly acute, his \nadoptive family had him admitted into Highland Psychiatric Hospital. Upon information and \nbelief, DHHR paid for these institutionalizations but never opened a formal investigation into \nJonathan’s adoptive home.  \n46.  In March of 2015, when Jonathan was 11 years old, a mandatory reporter at his \nschool called CPS to report that she believed Jonathan was being emotionally and physically \nabused by his adoptive mother. Jonathan reported that the adoptive mother hit him with various \nitems including a vacuum attachment, a broom handle, and a switch so hard that it broke. On one \noccasion, Jonathan told his adoptive mother that he would call the cops on her to which she replied, \n“before the cops get here you will be dead.” DHHR failed to open an investigation, and Jonathan \nremained in the adoptive home.  \n47.  Jonathan continued to suffer in the home and his behaviors worsened. In January \n2016, another mandatory reporter at Jonathan’s school made a referral alleging ongoing physical \nand emotional abuse of Jonathan in his home. Once again, DHHR failed to open an investigation.  \n \n16 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 17 of 105 PageID #: 17\n48.  In May 2016, Jonathan’s adoptive parents had him admitted into Highland \nPsychiatric Hospital due to allegations that he had sexual contact with another child. They refused \nto allow Jonathan to return to their home, indicating that they had only adopted him because he \nhad been “left on their doorstep.”  \n49.  That month DHHR finally took custody of Jonathan. Upon information and \nbelief, DHHR made no effort to place Jonathan into a foster home and instead placed him in an \nout-of-state institutional care facility in Savannah, Georgia, called Coastal Harbor Treatment \nCenter.  \n50.  DHHR later moved Jonathan from Coastal Harbor Center to Heritage Home, an \nout-of-state institutional care facility located in Nashville, Tennessee. Heritage Home has a \ntargeted  treatment  program  for  adjudicated  juvenile  sex  offenders.  West  Virginia  never \nadjudicated  Jonathan  to  be  sex  offender,  let  alone  charged  him  with  committing  a  crime. \nNevertheless, DHHR forced Jonathan to remain at Heritage Home and participate in their six-\nmonth program as a pre-condition to his discharge.  \n51.  Following Jonathan’s discharge from Heritage Home, DHHR failed to locate a \nfoster home placement for Jonathan and placed him at Stepping Stones Boys Home in West \nVirginia, yet another residential care facility. Upon information and belief, he remained there for \nover two-and-a-half years.  \n52.  In August 2019, DHHR placed Jonathan with his biological grandmother, but, \nupon information and belief, DHHR failed to thoroughly vet this placement and has failed to \nprovide the family with any services or financial supports.  \n53.  Jonathan  is  diagnosed  with  post-traumatic  stress  disorder,  attention-\ndeficit/hyperactivity disorder, and reactive attachment disorder.  \n \n17 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 18 of 105 PageID #: 18\n54.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Jonathan has suffered \nand continues to suffer emotional and psychological harm. Specifically, if Defendants had made \nreasonable professional judgments, engaged in reasonable case planning and placement matching, \nnot acted in disregard of professional standards as to the management of Jonathan’s case, and not \nacted  with  deliberate  indifference  to  his  legal  rights,  Defendants  may  well  have  prevented \nadditional trauma Jonathan has suffered while in the custody of the DHHR.   \nAnastasia M. \n55.  Anastasia is an 11-year-old girl who has been in foster care twice. She is a \nmember of the General Class and the ADA Subclass. She appears through her next friend, Cheryl \nOrd. Ms. Ord was Anastasia’s pre-school teacher and is a long-time foster mother. Ms. Ord \nremained in contact with Anastasia and her adoptive mother over the years. Ms. Ord has fostered \nover 200 children between 1976 and 2006, has taught foster parent training classes, and is \ncommitted to advocating for the best interests of Anastasia. \n56.  Anastasia entered foster care in West Virginia for the first time when she was \nfour years old. She was adopted but, following her mother’s incarceration, re-entered foster care \nfor the second time at the age of 10 along with her younger half-brother. \n57.  After her first removal, DHHR placed Anastasia and her brother with a foster \nmother (“AM) who, at the time, was a single mother of five, including four adopted children. \nAnastasia lived with AM for 18 months. AM planned to petition for adoption once the mother’s \nparental rights were terminated.  \n58.  CPS  opened  an  internal  investigation  on  AM  after  her  son,  who,  upon \ninformation and belief, had behavioral issues, made a report to CPS. Upon information and belief, \nDHHR did not substantiate those allegations yet DHHR removed Anastasia and her brother from \n \n18 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 19 of 105 PageID #: 19\nAM’s home. All AM’s other children, including the son who alleged abuse, remained in the home.  \n59.  Over  the  next  six  months,  upon  information  and  belief,  DHHR  shuffled \nAnastasia and her brother between seven different placements, including four foster homes and \nthree respite care placements. DHHR eventually placed Anastasia and her brother back into AM’s \ncare. Approximately seven months later, just before Anastasia’s seventh birthday, AM adopted the \nchildren. In total, Anastasia was in out-of-home care for 31 months. \n60.  After three-and-a-half  years the placement disrupted, and DHHR removed \nAnastasia and placed her back in foster care. While in AM’s care, Anastasia was admitted to \nHighland Psychiatric Hospital because she was at risk of harming herself. AM had also sent \nAnastasia to a six-month program at ChildHelp East, a residential facility in Virginia. After \nreturning, in February 2019, Anastasia and her adopted sister were caught shoplifting, and DHHR \nremoved both girls from AM.  \n61.  DHHR  placed  Anastasia  in  an  emergency  shelter  in  Clarksburg.  Upon \ninformation and belief, after approximately 60 days DHHR moved Anastasia to another temporary \nshelter in Cabell County. Upon information and belief, she was abruptly discharged from the \nCabell County Shelter because she sprayed Lysol on a staff member. Anna was charged with \nassault and, just before her 11th birthday, she was sent to the Robert L. Shell Juvenile Detention \nCenter. Most of the residents were over 15 years old. Upon information and belief, Anastasia \nremained there for over three months and slept on a mattress on the cement floor in a single-room \ncell. Anastasia has said, “I don’t think I need help, I need love.” \n62.  Upon information and belief, DHHR wanted  to send Anastasia to an out-of-\nstate residential facility but the charges pending against her were a barrier to admission. As a result, \nupon information and belief, DHHR worked with the court to have the charges dropped.  \n \n19 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 20 of 105 PageID #: 20\n63.  Upon information and belief, Anastasia is currently residing at the Lighthouse \nCare Center of Augusta in Augusta, Georgia, a residential treatment facility for children and teens \nwith psychiatric issues. The facility has been in the news for wrongdoing on multiple occasions. \nIn 2017, their admissions coordinator was charged with child molestation, sexual battery, and \nsexual assault, among other charges, for the attack of a 14-year-old, suicidal, female patient. That \nsame year, an on-campus mental health provider was arrested for the sexual assault of a 16-year-\nold patient. In May 2019, it was reported that a teenage patient was accused of sexually abusing \nanother teenage patient at the facility. The facility also has a history of violating regulations: in \n2012, the Georgia Healthcare Facility Regulation Division cited Lighthouse Care Center for failure \nto staff a registered nurse on more than 25 percent of night shifts within a three-month period.  \n64.  Anastasia is exceptionally bright and has an IQ of 130. As a result of her early \nchildhood trauma and subsequent traumas related to her multiple placement disruptions, Anastasia \nsuffers  from  the  symptoms  of  attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder,  reactive  attachment \ndisorder, and other psychological issues.  \n65.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Anastasia has suffered \nand continues to suffer emotional and psychological harm. Specifically, if Defendants had made \nreasonable professional judgments, engaged in reasonable case planning and placement matching, \nnot acted in disregard of professional standards as to the management of Anastasia’s case, and not \nacted with  deliberate indifference to  her legal  rights,  Defendants  may well have prevented \nadditional trauma Anastasia has suffered while in the custody of the DHHR. \nSerena S. \n66.  Serena is an 11-year-old girl who has Down syndrome. She is verbal but \ndependent on others to perform daily activities such as maintaining basic hygiene. Serena is a \n \n20 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 21 of 105 PageID #: 21\nmember of the General Class, the Kinship Subclass, and the ADA Subclass. She appears through \nher next friend, Sarah Dixon. Ms. Dixon has been Serena’s guardian ad litem for over a year, visits \nher regularly, remains in regular communication with her, and is truly dedicated to Serena’s best \ninterests.   \n67.  Serena came into foster care in December 2018, because she had missed an \nexcessive amount of school.  Prior to entering care, she was the subject of several child protective \nreferrals based on educational neglect. During the 2018 – 2019 school year, Serena’s parents \nstopped sending her to school altogether after truancy proceedings were initiated. Serena’s parents \nclaimed that the symptoms of her Down syndrome made it difficult to get her to school, even \nthough door-to-door transportation services were provided to Serena.  \n68.  Serena’s parents were convicted of educational neglect and sentenced to serve \ntime in prison, but, upon information and belief, they never reported to the state to serve their \nsentences.  \n69.  At the behest of the truancy judge, DHHR filed an abuse or neglect petition, and \ntook Serena and her three-year-old brother into the custody of the state. Serena’s parents have only \nappeared in court once and refused to submit to drug screenings. It is unknown whether their \nparental rights were terminated.  \n70.  Serena and her younger brother were first placed together in the home of their \nmaternal aunt, whose four biological children also lived in the home. DHHR did not certify the \naunt as a foster parent and failed to provide her with financial supports or, upon information and \nbelief, services, to help care for Serena and her brother. After only five weeks, the placement \ndisrupted.  \n71.  After DHHR removed the children from their aunt’s home, DHHR placed \n \n21 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 22 of 105 PageID #: 22\nSerena in a regular non-kinship foster home and separated her from her brother. Upon information \nand belief, DHHR recognized that Serena requires a special needs foster home. These homes \nreceive specialized training and supports and are meant to provide for children with severe \ndevelopmental disabilities. But, upon information and belief, DHHR claimed that they could not \nlocate a special needs home for Serena. Further, upon information and belief, DHHR claimed that \nthey could not find a home that would accept both Serena and her brother given Serena’s special \nneeds. Serena was distraught over the separation from her little brother. Even worse, DHHR did \nnot put a formal sibling visitation plan in place and did not otherwise arrange visits between Serena \nand her brother for, upon information and belief, months.  \n72.  In April 2019, Serena’s non-kinship foster placement disrupted, and DHHR \nplaced Serena in yet another regular non-kinship foster home without her brother. She remains \nthere today. Serena’s current foster home is not pre-adoptive. DHHR plans to eventually send \nSerena to an institutional care facility called The Potomac Center—altogether skipping any \nintermediate levels of care in less restrictive settings, such as a specialized or therapeutic foster \nhome.  \n73.  Upon information and belief, the Potomac Center is marked by a low staff-to-\nresident ratio, poor training and oversight of their staff, and abuse and neglect from staff towards \nthe residents. In 2017, formal allegations were filed against the facility claiming that, among other \nabuses, the disabled residents did not receive the services the facility claimed to offer and they \nfailed to hire, train, and supervise their employees adequately. Separately, as a result of an ongoing \ncriminal investigation, state police have claimed that Potomac Center staff abused 12 children, \nages  seven  to  17,  subjecting  them  to  physical,  sexual,  and  psychological  abuse,  including \n“inhumane and degrading treatment by some employees of the Potomac Center, Inc. facility.” Four \n \n22 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 23 of 105 PageID #: 23\nsenior administrators were charged with failing to report the abuse.  \n74.  Serena’s current foster parent has begged the caseworker to leave Serena in her \ncare indefinitely to avoid the unnecessary institutionalization of Serena, even though she does not \nplan on adopting Serena. To date, DHHR has provided no information concerning their efforts to \nfind Serena a pre-adoptive home or to develop a long-term plan involving a less restrictive \nplacement option than an institution. \n75.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Serena has suffered and \ncontinues to suffer emotional and psychological harm. Specifically, if Defendants had made \nreasonable professional judgments, engaged in reasonable case planning and placement matching, \nnot acted in disregard of professional standards as to the management of Serena’s case, and not \nacted with  deliberate indifference to  her legal  rights,  Defendants  may well have prevented \nadditional trauma Serena has suffered while in the custody of the DHHR.   \nTheo S. \n76.  Theo S. is a seven-year-old boy who is currently placed in an out-of-state \ninstitution. He is a member of the General Class and the ADA Subclass. Theo appears through his \nnext friend, L. Scott Briscoe. Mr. Briscoe has been Theo’s guardian ad litem for over two years, \nvisits him regularly, remains in regular communication with him, and is truly dedicated to Theo’s \nbest interests.   \n77.  Theo first came to DHHR’s attention on June 14, 2012, three days after his birth. \nTheo was born suffering from opioid withdrawal. His withdrawal symptoms were severe enough \nto necessitate pharmacologic treatment, such as morphine. Despite this, DHHR declined to open a \ncase.    \n78.  Three years later, on July 9, 2015, CPS observed Theo’s mother to be under the \n \n23 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 24 of 105 PageID #: 24\ninfluence of drugs. Theo’s mother admitted to the DHHR caseworker that she had a long-term \nsubstance abuse issue. During DHHR’s investigation, the mother was arrested on a warrant related \nto a domestic assault altercation.   \n79.  Theo’s maternal aunt agreed to watch Theo for a week and have no contact with \nTheo’s mother until DHHR put a protective plan in place. Theo’s mother subsequently participated \nin an in-home safety plan and services and Theo returned to her care. But, in the following months, \nshe missed many drugs screens.     \n80.  On January 29, 2016, the mother informed the caseworker that there was \ndomestic violence in the home involving Theo’s father.  She called the police but declined to press \ncharges. DHHR implemented another protective plan, removed Theo from the home, and again \nplaced him with his maternal aunt. \n81.  On February 4, 2016, during a home visit, the caseworker smelled urine in the \nmother’s home. The caseworker observed a bucket near the window that Theo had been using to \nrelieve himself. The mother’s hands were covered in black and the caseworker saw a syringe lying \non the table. Theo informed the caseworker that his mother took shots provided by the doctor.   \n82.  DHHR filed a petition for abuse and neglect on February 5, 2016, and the \nfollowing day placed Theo in foster care. DHHR placed him in two non-kinship homes before \nplacing Theo with his paternal aunt and uncle.   \n83.  On February 8, 2016, the mother admitted to neglecting Theo due to substance \nabuse and domestic violence, and the court adjudicated Theo a neglected child. The father failed \nto appear in court and was subsequently adjudicated neglectful. \n84.  Between March 2016 and December 2016, Theo’s mother failed to engage in \nher DHHR service plan. Theo’s father neither appeared in court nor availed himself of services.  \n \n24 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 25 of 105 PageID #: 25\nOn December 19, 2016, Theo’s parents’ rights were terminated. \n85.  On March 20, 2017, DHHR submitted a report to the court for a permanency \nreview. DHHR indicated that the permanency plan was for Theo’s paternal aunt and uncle to adopt \nhim, which the court approved.  \n86.  Three months later, on June 21, 2017, DHHR submitted another report to the \ncourt indicating that Theo was doing well in his placement, and DHHR was transferring his case \nto the adoption unit. The court again approved the permanency plan of adoption.  \n87.  But, soon thereafter, on September 25, 2017, Theo’s caseworker testified in \ncourt that the aunt had indicated that Theo was “too much” in her home. Therefore, the caseworker \nwas searching for another relative to take Theo. \n88.  The following day DHHR removed Theo from his pre-adoptive placement and \nplaced him with his maternal aunt—his fourth placement in less than two years. \n89.  On January 12, 2018, less than four months later, the maternal aunt gave her 10-\nday notice to have Theo removed. DHHR placed Theo in a non-kinship foster home on January \n22, 2018, but, upon information and belief, they also asked DHHR to remove Theo.  \n90.  On February 16, 2018, DHHR moved Theo to a relative’s home, where he \nremained for only a week, before they also gave notice, stating that they could not handle Theo’s \nbehaviors.  \n91.  DHHR moved Theo to his seventh placement, a non-kinship foster home over \nfour hours away from his home county.  \n92.  Between February 2018 to June 2018, Theo was placed in four different non-\nkinship placements.  During a May 29, 2018 multi-disciplinary team  (\"MDT\") meeting, the \ncaseworker indicated that Theo’s most recent placement was pre-adoptive.   \n \n25 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 26 of 105 PageID #: 26\n93.  On  September  20,  2018,  it  was  reported  that  six-year-old  Theo  had  been \ndischarged from his fifth daycare and had attacked his foster mother.  Theo was taken to the Ohio \nValley emergency room, where he remained for a week. On September 27, 2018, Ohio Valley \nindicated that Theo was discharge ready and recommended that he be placed at Highland-\nClarksburg Hospital, which had an acute program for children with intellectual or developmental \ndisabilities who also had a mental health disorder.  \n94.  On October 4, 2018, Theo was transferred to Highland-Clarksburg Hospital’s \nacute unit while it was determined whether he qualified for their intellectual or developmental \ndisabilities program.     \n95.  Upon information and belief, DHHR could not find a suitable placement for \nTheo in West Virginia following his hospitalizations. Therefore, on December 13, 2018, DHHR \nmoved six-year-old Theo to ChildHelp Treatment Facility in Virginia, which is located over five \nhours away from his home county. At the time of admission, Theo was diagnosed with reactive \nattachment  disorder,  disruptive  mood  dysregulation  disorder,  chronic  post-traumatic  stress \ndisorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactive disorder. Theo was also confirmed to have a history of \nphysical and psychological abuse as well as neglect. A diagnosis was later added for fetal alcohol \nsyndrome. Moreover, he was at an early kindergarten level when assessed educationally.     \n96.  Theo’s initial medication regimen consisted of three drugs for the treatment of \nattention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (Guanfacine, Clonidine, and Focalin XR), one drug for the \ntreatment of insomnia (Clonidine) and a fifth drug for mood-stabilization (Risperdal, later replaced \nwith Trileptal). These medications all have seemingly conflicting side-effects.  \n97.  As for Theo’s medical visits, his weight frequently concerned clinicians. A side-\neffect of taking both antipsychotics and antidepressants (which are prescribed to Theo) include \n \n26 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 27 of 105 PageID #: 27\nweight-gain and weight-retention. Theo was noted to have a high body mass index, placing him at \nthe 97th percentile for his age group.   \n98.  Theo has frequently visited the nurse’s office due to injuries sustained from \nother residents, who have punched Theo in the forehead and right eye, kicked his ribs, and hit his \nelbow with a thrown chair.  \n99.  While at ChildHelp, Theo exhibited symptoms that were clinically significant \nfor depression. Theo said that when he feels sad, he will “color and be safe” or will hug his bear.  \nTo work on his anger, Theo has stated that “hugs might help” and he would “use [his] coping skills \nlike hug[ging] [his] hedgehog.” \n100.  ChildHelp estimates that Theo will be discharged in December 2019, but this is \ncontingent on DHHR finding an appropriate foster home placement. ChildHelp has recommended \nfamily  engagement  with  a  prospective  foster  family  before  Theo’s  discharge.  But,  upon \ninformation and belief, DHHR is not making sufficient efforts to locate an alternative and less \nrestrictive placement for Theo. \n101.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Theo has suffered and \ncontinues to suffer emotional and psychological harm. Specifically, if Defendants had made \nreasonable professional judgments, engaged in reasonable case planning and placement matching, \nnot acted in disregard of professional standards as to the management of Theo’s case, and not acted \nwith deliberate indifference to his legal rights, Defendants may well have prevented additional \ntrauma Theo has suffered while in the custody of DHHR. \nGarrett M. \n102.  Garrett M. is 17 years old and has been in the custody of DHHR since 2012. \nGarrett is a member of the General Class, the ADA Subclass, and the Aging Out Subclass. Garrett \n \n27 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 28 of 105 PageID #: 28\nappears through his next friend L. Scott Briscoe. Mr. Briscoe has been Garrett’s guardian ad litem \nfor over seven years, visits him regularly, remains in regular communication with him, and is truly \ndedicated to Garrett’s best interests. \n103.  Garrett was born in Staten Island, New York, where he lived with his mother, \nfather, two younger sisters, and two older brothers. Garrett’s mother had a significant child \nprotective history in New York and died of an overdose in January 2011. At the time, his father \nwas mentally unstable and could no longer provide for the children. Eight-year-old Garrett and his \ntwo younger sisters were sent to live with a paternal aunt and uncle in West Virginia.  \n104.  Garrett and his sisters remained in their relatives’ care for almost two years. \nDuring this time, the children were physically and emotionally abused. Almost daily, the children \nhad their hands tied behind their backs while they were struck with a belt. Any attempt to block \nthe blows by moving their hands earned them each five more strikes. Eventually, teachers at the \nchildren’s school, who noticed marks on the children, made a report to DHHR.  \n105.  DHHR removed the children and placed  them in a non-kinship foster home. A \nfew months later, the foster parents expressed a preference for the younger sisters over Garrett. \nUpon information and belief, they did not like that Garrett was protective over his sisters, and this \ncreated an uneasiness between Garrett and his new foster father. Upon information and belief, the \nuneasiness led to a physical altercation between Garrett and his foster father one evening when the \nfoster father found Garrett sleeping outside of the girls’ bedroom. \n106.  Soon thereafter, the foster parents accused Garrett of inappropriately touching \nhis sisters, and DHHR removed him from the home. Garrett maintains that he was wrongfully \naccused. DHHR conducted an investigation but there were never any formal charges against \nGarrett. Furthermore, Garrett disclosed at the time of the investigation as well as later during \n \n28 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 29 of 105 PageID #: 29\nseveral multi-disciplinary team (MDT) meetings that his older brother sexually abused him when \nhe was young. Garrett suspects this brother abused his sisters as well. Upon information and belief, \nGarrett’s allegations against his brother were never investigated, and DHHR treated Garrett like a \nsexual  offender.  Upon  information  and  belief,  this  has  hindered  Garrett’s  ability  to  find  a \npermanent placement. \n107.  In September 2015, the court granted DHHR’s request to separate Garrett and \nhis sisters and entered a no-contact order. The foster parents adopted Garrett’s sisters, and Garrett \nlost all contact with them. \n108.  After  leaving  the  foster  home,  DHHR  placed  Garrett  at  Sam’s  House,  a \ntemporary shelter located four hours away from his community. Sam’s House accepts residents \nbetween 15 and 17 years old. Garrett was only 11 years old and subject to daily ridicule from the \nolder residents. He felt overwhelmed and depressed. In a moment of despair, Garrett devised a \nnoose out of a leather belt. A staff member discovered him hanging in his room gasping for air. \n109.  After his suicide attempt, Garrett was admitted to Hillcrest Psychiatric Hospital \nfor a six-month treatment program. Upon his discharge, DHHR again placed him in a temporary \nshelter where his fellow residents were older, attended an off-site public school, and enjoyed \nfamily visits—privileges that Garrett was unable to enjoy. Once again, staff discovered Garrett in \nhis room hanging from a rope around his neck.  \n110.  Garrett spent the next six months at River Park Psychiatric Hospital where he \nwas treated with heavy dosages of mostly off-label psychotropic drugs, which made him feel like \n“a  walking  zombie.”  Even  his  attorney  described  him  during  his  stay  at  River  Park  as \n“unrecognizable, and completely out of it.” \n111.  After his discharge from the hospital, DHHR sent then 12-year-old Garrett to an \n \n29 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 30 of 105 PageID #: 30\ninstitutional residential placement for male sex offenders called Cedar Grove in Tennessee. Most \nresidents were over the age of 15 and had charges pending against them for sex offenses, including \nrape. Garrett was forced to participate in group therapy, which required the participants to identify \nas sex offenders and disclose the details of their offenses to the group. Garrett tried to refuse \ntherapy and hide in his room but he was punished by the loss of hard-to-come-by privileges. As a \nresult, Garrett felt pressured into making an admission to get out of the program.    \n112.  Garrett begged his caseworker to move him. He told her that he was not a sex \noffender and felt uncomfortable at the facility.  But DHHR left Garrett in Tennessee for 18 months.  \n113.  DHHR moved Garrett back to West Virginia in 2015. In West Virginia, DHHR \nbounced him amongst multiple placements, primarily residential facilities.  \n114.  In 2018, during a juvenile delinquency proceedings, Garrett  admitted to the \ncharge of “terroristic threats” and was sentenced to probation. The charge arose out of a jealously \ninduced online argument Garrett had with a peer over a girl. West Virginia placed Garrett at the \nDonald R. Kuhn Detention Center. At the detention center, Garrett attended an online school and \nslept on a mattress on a cement floor in a single-occupancy locked cell. \n115.  In late 2018, upon information and belief, Garrett’s caseworker placed Garrett \ninto another residential program for sex offenders at River Park Psychiatric Hospital. At an \nemergency hearing challenging the placement, the judge stated “[Garrett] came into State’s \ncustody because he was a victim in an abuse and neglect case. I think calling a child a rapist when \nhe’s never been judicially determined to be a rapist goes too far. So, I am going to order a new \nworker. I want the order to reflect that [Garrett] has never been adjudicated as a sex offender, and \nthere has never been any evidence introduced at any hearing of any type of sex offense.” Further, \nthe judge acknowledged that “the state’s improper labeling of [Garrett] as a sex offender has \n \n30 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 31 of 105 PageID #: 31\nwrongfully made his placement options more difficult.” \n116.  DHHR failed to identify a foster home placement for Garrett, so they moved \nGarrett back to the Donald R. Kuhn Detention Center, where he spent his 17th birthday.   \n117.  In May 2019, DHHR finally moved Garrett to a residential facility that was \nsupposed to offer him transitional living skills and vocational training. Garrett ran away from the \nfacility.  \n118.  Garrett is currently placed at the Rubenstein facility, which is a secure group \nhome. At the group home, Garrett is working towards a high school diploma through an online \nself-guided educational “click-through” program. He is not receiving any vocational training.  \n119.  Garrett is increasingly nervous about his upcoming 18th birthday, because he \nwill age-out of the system. He has no plans to attend college, and DHHR has failed to provide him \nwith any type of vocational training or other life skills. Moreover, Garrett has no adults whom he \ncan turn to when he leaves foster care. He is afraid that when he ages out in less than a year, he \nwill become homeless. Garrett does not trust that DHHR, which has failed him so many times, \nwill help him even if he remained in care. He dreams of possibly finding family in New York who \nwill take him in. \n120.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Garrett has suffered and \ncontinues to suffer emotional and psychological harm. Specifically, if Defendants had made \nreasonable professional judgments, engaged in reasonable case planning and placement matching, \nnot acted in disregard of professional standards as to the management of Garrett’s case, and not \nacted  with  deliberate  indifference  to  his  legal  rights,  Defendants  may  well  have  prevented \nadditional trauma Garrett has suffered while in the custody of the  DHHR.   \nGretchen C. \n \n31 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 32 of 105 PageID #: 32\n121.  Gretchen C. is 15 years old and has been in the care and custody of DHHR since \nApril 2015. She is a member of the General Class, the ADA Subclass, and the Aging Out Subclass. \nGretchen appears through her next friend April Flowers. Ms. Flowers is Gretchen’s paternal aunt \nand has known her since birth. Ms. Flowers is a mother to seven children, Gretchen’s cousins, and \nis very committed to serving her best interests in this action.  \n122.  DHHR removed Gretchen from her biological mother when she was 11 years \nold  due  to  her  mother’s  drug  abuse.  DHHR  had  received  several  reports  about  domestic \ndisturbances in the home before removing Gretchen. DHHR placed Gretchen in a temporary \nshelter, and the court granted Gretchen’s mother an improvement period during which she was \nrequired to complete parenting classes.  \n123.  During the pendency of the neglect case, Gretchen’s mother failed to cooperate \nwith DHHR or visit Gretchen. It is unknown whether her parental rights were ever terminated. \nDHHR has failed to form a reunification plan and, instead, left Gretchen to linger in the custody \nof the state without a path to permanency. \n124.  During the past four years, DHHR has never placed Gretchen in a foster home. \nInstead, she has spent time in in temporary shelters, four different West Virginia group homes, and \none large out-of-state institution, where she currently resides. \n125.  Gretchen was first placed at the Gutske Child Center, a temporary shelter in \nWest Virginia. DHHR then moved her to another temporary shelter called the Helinski Child \nShelter.  After this, DHHR moved Gretchen to the Burlington United Methodist Family Services \nResidential Program. And, after this, DHHR placed her in yet another residential facility. \n126.  Since Gretchen entered care over four years ago, her paternal grandmother has \nasked to care for Gretchen. She is a certified foster mother. But, upon information and belief, the \n \n32 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 33 of 105 PageID #: 33\ncaseworker refuses to place Gretchen with the grandmother because Gretchen is a child who \n“doesn’t listen” and has gotten into physical altercations in residential facilities. \n127.  In September 2018, DHHR placed Gretchen in the Children’s Center of Ohio, a \nprivate residential treatment center for boys and girls who are considered “troubled.” This 60-bed \nfacility located in rural Patriot, Ohio, is referred to in the media as a “youth corrections facility.” \nUpon  information  and  belief,  the  Children’s  Center  fails  to  meet  Gretchen’s  therapeutic, \neducational, and other developmental needs. Many of the residents at this facility are adjudicated \nfor violent offenses or are currently receiving treatment for aggression. Gretchen in contrast, a \nneglected youth, has never been adjudicated as a delinquent. \n128.  Gretchen has been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and is prescribed Adderall, Trazodone, and \nCelexa. According to her grandmother, Gretchen did not need medication prior to entering foster \ncare.  Upon  information  and  belief,  the  Children’s  Center  only  provides  group  therapy  and \nGretchen is uncomfortable sharing her thoughts in front of a group. She has repeatedly asked her \ncaseworker for one-on-one therapy, but DHHR has failed to arrange it. Upon information and \nbelief, the daily cost of residing at The Children’s Center of Ohio is approximately $800. \n129.  Upon information and belief, the Children’s Center engages in controversial \ntherapeutic practices such as peer shaming. Research shows that these aversion techniques have \nlong lasting adverse impacts on children’s psychological wellbeing. Shaming is proven to be \nineffective, anger-inducing, and often results in social withdrawal and in some cases mental \nillnesses. Historically, this form of behavior control has been used at larger residential facilities \nwith a low staff-to-resident ratio, like the Children’s Center.  \n130.  The Children’s Center of Ohio also requires children to perform unusual forms \n \n33 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 34 of 105 PageID #: 34\nof manual labor. The residents are frequently required to reap the surrounding undeveloped \nacreage, including a steep hillside, using a scythe, a farming tool with a long blade attached to a \nwooden handle. Requiring children, many of whom suffer from behavioral and mental health \nissues or have committed violent offenses, to handle these farming tools is especially dangerous. \nFurther, the requirement to reap the fields does not exclude residents who are on psychotropic \nmedications with common side effects such as drowsiness, lightheadedness, and blurred vision.  \n131.  DHHR has transferred Gretchen to five schools over the past four years, and she \nstruggles to remain at a peer-appropriate level. At her current placement, Gretchen is bused to a \nnearby university to complete online classes. There is no live instructor, rather, there is a teacher \nwho is “in the building” during class time.  If Gretchen needs help, she sends him an email and he \neither responds via email or comes to the classroom from another floor. The program is completely \nself-guided, and it is unknown if Gretchen will obtain any transferable credits.   \n132.  The program at the Children’s Center of Ohio is strict, regimented, and punitive. \nUpon information and belief, privileges are hard to come by but easy to lose. One privilege is \nresidents’ ability to decorate their personal space with family photos. Visitation rights are another \nprivilege but are commonly revoked. The facility has denied Gretchen permission to return to West \nVirginia to see her grandmother and cousins for Christmas, Easter, and her birthday due to her \n“mistakes” within the program, including rolling her eyes at a staff member.  \n133.  Recently, Gretchen was sent home to visit her grandmother. That was her first \ntime home in approximately seven months. During the visit, family members noticed an unusual \nquietness about Gretchen. Gretchen observed, “I have no social skills.”  \n134.  Gretchen also has discomfort about some of the Children’s Center staff. Upon \ninformation and belief, a male staff member told her, “I should restrain you,” and when she asked \n \n34 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 35 of 105 PageID #: 35\nwhy, he responded “no reason.”  Later, the same male staff member said, “I would like for you to \ntry to restrain me.”  \n135.  Upon information and belief, DHHR has no permanency plan in place for \nGretchen, and DHHR is not providing her with independent living skills as an alternative to \npermanency. Gretchen feels hopeless and states, “I know that they have given up on me, they think \nI am manipulative and lazy.” She believes she will be stuck in the system forever. Gretchen would \nlike to return home to West Virginia and live with her grandmother, finish high school, and then \nattend college to study interior design. \n136.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Gretchen has suffered \nand continues to suffer emotional and psychological harm. Specifically, if Defendants had made \nreasonable professional judgments, engaged in reasonable case planning and placement matching, \nnot acted in disregard of professional standards as to the management of Gretchen’s case, and not \nacted with  deliberate indifference to  her legal  rights,  Defendants  may well  have prevented \nadditional trauma Gretchen has suffered while in the custody of DHHR.   \nDennis C. \n137.  Dennis is 16 years old and has been in the custody of DHHR since he was 11. \nHe is a member of the General Class, the Kinship Subclass, the ADA Subclass, and the Aging Out \nSubclass. Dennis appears through his next friend, Debbie Short, his step-grandmother. She has \nknown Dennis his entire life and is committed to representing his best interests in this case.   \n138.  Dennis’s parents abused him from a young age. He is diagnosed with cerebral \npalsy, which is likely a result of shaken baby syndrome. His condition causes his entire body to \nshake and his left arm is underdeveloped and atrophied. Dennis missed school frequently and when \nhe did go to school, staff bathed him and gave him clean clothes because his home lacked  \n \n35 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 36 of 105 PageID #: 36\nelectricity.  \n139.  Despite these obvious signs of abuse and neglect, CPS did not become involved \nin Dennis’s life until he was 11 years old, when a school official called in a report. But, upon \ninformation and belief, Debbie Short and Dennis’s biological grandmother began reporting the \nabuse to CPS at least a year prior to this incident. During that year, DHHR took no action.  \n140.  After conducting an investigation, DHHR removed Dennis and his 17-year-old \nbrother from their home and filed a neglect petition against their parents. Dennis’s biological \nparents’ rights were eventually terminated due to the abuse and neglect. \n141.  Originally,  DHHR  placed  the  brothers  together  in  a  foster  home.  Shortly \nthereafter, Dennis was removed from the foster home but his brother remained in that placement \nuntil his graduation from high school. Dennis has not talked to his brother since his removal.  \n142.  In addition to this original foster placement, Dennis has experienced four other \nfailed foster home placements. Dennis has specialized needs due to his history of trauma and his \ncerebral palsy diagnosis and requires a therapeutic or special needs foster home. But DHHR has \nnever provided Dennis a therapeutic or special needs placement. Such foster homes are supposed \nto be specially prepared to deal with a child, such as Dennis, who has special needs, difficulty in \nschool, and behavioral risks. As part of the licensing requirements the foster parents should receive \nspecial training to successfully deal with the particular child’s issues, and the number of other \nbiological or foster children in the home is limited.  \n143.  Not only has Dennis never been placed into a therapeutic or special needs foster \nhome, but he has gone long periods of time without receiving therapy because of his multiple \nplacement moves. After multiple failed placements, DHHR began placing him into group homes \nand other institutional settings.  \n \n36 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 37 of 105 PageID #: 37\n144.  At the time of his original removal, Dennis’s step-grandmother went to the \nRoane County DHHR office to request that Dennis be placed with her. After changing her \nresidence and completing the vetting process and foster parent training, DHHR approved her for \nplacement and moved Dennis moved into her home. Almost immediately, the placement became \nstrained because Dennis began displaying challenging behaviors at home and at school. Dennis \nneeded mental health, behavior health and educational supports, but DHHR failed to provide them \nto the family.  \n145.  When Dennis began threatening to harm himself, Ms. Short felt she had to report \nthis to his caseworker. Dennis was sent to Highland-Clarksburg Hospital for short-term mental \nhealth support. After returning home from the hospital, Dennis continued acting out. He was \nexpelled from school, and Ms. Short felt she could no longer keep Dennis absent receiving further \nsupport from DHHR. DHHR removed Dennis from her home and placed him in a shelter in \nMorgantown.  \n146.  Dennis has had to attend many different schools over the years due to his \nmultiple placements and, as such,  his education is disjointed. Dennis needs special education \nservices and supports, but DHHR has failed to ensure he receives these. Dennis has received good \ngrades in school but does not know how to read or write despite his good grades. \n147.  On August 16, 2019, DHHR moved Dennis to the Potomac Center in West \nVirginia. Upon information and belief, many of the residents at this facility are disabled, low \nfunctioning, and have demanding therapeutic needs. Further, the residents are isolated on campus \nand do not integrate into the surrounding community. This is a higher level of care than Dennis \nrequires.  \n148.  The Potomac Center runs a youth program as well as an adult program. Upon \n \n37 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 38 of 105 PageID #: 38\ninformation and belief, DHHR’s long-term plan for Dennis is for him to graduate from the youth \nprogram straight into the adult residential care program. DHHR’s placement of Dennis at the \nPotomac Center undermines all of the years of hard work that Dennis put into physical therapy, \nschool, and behavioral therapy.  \n149.  Dennis dreams of graduating high school, getting a driver’s license, living with \nhis step-grandmother, getting a job, saving enough money to secure his own apartment, and \nultimately living independently. DHHR, however, has fallen back on the incorrect assumption that \nbecause Dennis is disabled, he requires institutionalization for the rest of his adult life.  \n150.  Worse still, the Potomac Center, discussed infra ¶ 73, serves children and adults \nwith disabilities. As previously mentioned, the facility lost its license in 2014 following allegations \nthat the staff had sexually and emotionally abused several children in its care. Further, due to the \nhighly regimented program, minimal engagement with the surrounding community, and other \ninstitutional approaches to caretaking, the Potomac Center has the reputation of being the “last \nstop” before placement into a state hospital.     \n151.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Dennis has suffered and \ncontinues to suffer emotional and psychological harm. Specifically, if Defendants had made \nreasonable professional judgments, engaged in reasonable case planning and placement matching, \nnot acted in disregard of professional standards as to the management of Dennis’s case, and not \nacted  with  deliberate  indifference  to  his  legal  rights,  Defendants  may  well  have  prevented \nadditional trauma Dennis has suffered while in the custody of the DHHR.   \nCalvin D., Chris D., and Caroline D. \n152.  Calvin entered foster care when he was 14 months old due to his parents’ drug \naddiction and related neglect. His siblings, Chris and Caroline, entered foster care at birth. They \n \n38 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 39 of 105 PageID #: 39\nare now ages four, three and two, respectively. The siblings are all members of the General Class. \nThey appear through their next friend Katherine Huffman. Ms. Huffman first met the children \napproximately three years ago through a close network of local foster parents and children in \nBarbour County, West Virginia. She had regular contact with them during their almost two-year \nplacement in  Barbour County  and, as a former foster mother herself, and is  committed to \nrepresenting their best interests in this case.  \n153.  Shortly after the children’s entry into foster care their parents’ rights were \nterminated and they were freed for adoption. DHHR initially placed all three children together in \na pre-adoptive home. The foster parents expressed their interest in adoption, but DHHR, upon \ninformation and belief, repeatedly delayed the adoption process for unknown reasons.  \n154.  Unexpectedly, the foster parents were relocated for work to New Hampshire. \nDHHR told the foster parents they could not take the children with them. Upon information and \nbelief, DHHR did not submit an Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children to allow the \nchildren to remain with the pre-adoptive parents out of state pending the adoption. As a result, \nDHHR removed Caroline and Calvin from the only home they had ever known and Chris from the \nhome in which he had lived for the majority of his young life.  \n155.  DHHR struggled to find a new placement for all three children. Eventually, they \nturned to a local foster mother and advocate (“RK”), who organizes support groups for foster \nfamilies. This foster mother taught foster parent training classes on behalf of DHHR.   \n156.  RK was knowledgeable about the foster families in her network, and DHHR \nfrequently turned to her for assistance in locating homes with open beds when children entered \nfoster care.  \n157.  At the time of the siblings’ placement disruption, RK and her husband had seven \n \n39 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 40 of 105 PageID #: 40\nchildren in their care, ages one through 10 years old. Despite this, DHHR asked RK and her \nhusband, who were still actively licensed to foster, to take the siblings. And, in July 2017, Calvin, \nChris, and Caroline were placed with the family. Less than a year later, in April 2018, RK and her \nhusband applied to adopt them.  \n158.  In August 2018, while the adoption was pending, RK was diagnosed with uterine \ncancer, and in late September 2018, she had surgery to remove the cancer. On October 4, 2018, \ntwo weeks after RK’s surgery, a DHHR employee visited the house to check on the children. Upon \ninformation and belief, the house was in disarray as RK was unable to maintain organization in \nthe house during her recovery. \n159.  Only a few months after RK’s diagnosis, on October 29, 2018, DHHR removed \nCalvin, Chris, and Caroline from RK’s home on allegations that they were in “imminent danger.” \nRK’s seven other children remained in the home. Upon information and belief, Calvin, Chris, and \nCaroline were inconsolable, and the DHHR caseworker did not attend the removal. Rather, a CPS \nsupervisor sent the new foster mother to retrieve the children from RK. No one from DHHR \naccompanied her to RK’s home, and the children did not know the new foster mother.  \n160.  In May 2019, during a grievance hearing, the court ruled that DHHR failed to \nestablish that the siblings were in imminent danger at the time of their removal from RK’s home \nand directed that DHHR reopen RK’s home. RK requested that DHHR return the siblings, but, \nupon information and belief, DHHR refused to place the siblings back with RK and her family—\nclaiming it was over-capacity, even though no new children were in the home.  \n161.  Calvin, Chris, and Caroline came into the DHHR’s care and custody as babies. \nBecause Defendants have failed to properly manage their cases, the children have experienced two \nunnecessary placement disruptions from pre-adoptive homes.  \n \n40 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 41 of 105 PageID #: 41\n162.  After their removal from RK and her husband, DHHR placed Calvin, Chris, and \nCaroline into a foster home one town over, where they currently remain. \n163.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Calvin, Chris, and \nCaroline have suffered and continue to suffer emotional and psychological harm. Specifically, if \nDefendants had made reasonable professional judgments, engaged in reasonable case planning and \nplacement matching, not acted in disregard of professional standards as to the management of \nCalvin, Chris, and Caroline’s case, and not acted with deliberate indifference to their legal rights, \nDefendants may well have prevented additional trauma Calvin, Chris, and Caroline have suffered \nwhile in the custody of the DHHR.   \nKarter W. \n164.  Karter W. is 13 years old. He has been in the care and custody of DHHR since \nJuly 2016. Karter is a member of the General Class and the ADA Subclass. Karter appears through \nhis next friend, L. Scott Briscoe. Scott Briscoe is an attorney licensed in the state of West Virginia \nwhere he regularly serves as a guardian ad litem on abuse and neglect cases. He has represented \nKarter since he first entered care in 2016. Scott visits with Karter at least monthly and maintains \nregular contact by phone or email in between visits. \n165.  Before entering foster care, Karter lived with his mother and two older half-\nsisters. When Karter was nine years old, Karter’s teacher reported to CPS suspected child abuse in \nKarter’s home. CPS conducted an investigation, which revealed that Karter’s mother was using \ndrugs and her boyfriend was physically abusive towards her and Karter. The DHHR caseworker \nput an in-home safety plan in place that required Karter’s mother to submit to routine drug screens \nand have no contact with her boyfriend.   \n166.  Karter’s mother failed several drug screens over the next two months, and as a \n \n41 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 42 of 105 PageID #: 42\nresult, DHHR referred her to an in-patient treatment facility. She completed a six-day detox \ntreatment, but soon thereafter, stopped appearing for her drug screens. Additionally, the DHHR \ncaseworker discovered that her abusive boyfriend was back in the home. DHHR filed a petition \nseeking the removal of Karter and his two sisters.  \n167.  DHHR placed Karter’s two older siblings with their biological father and placed \nKarter in a non-kinship foster home. DHHR was unable to locate Karter’s estranged biological \nfather, and the court eventually terminated his paternal rights. \n168.  Karter’s non-kinship foster home had five other foster children living in it. \nMoreover, the foster mother viewed Karter as a “bad kid” and treated him differently from the \nother children. She forced Karter to sleep and spend his free time in the basement while the other \nchildren roamed freely about the house and yard. In the basement, Karter was isolated and \nunsupervised. He was only permitted to leave the basement for dinner and to attend school. He did \nnot interact with the other children in the home, who were forbidden from entering the basement.  \n169.  Karter’s living conditions violated DHHR’s homefinding policy which requires \nthat bedrooms have windows, children not be housed in unapproved rooms, foster children be \nsupervised, and children be disciplined with kindness and understanding.  \n170.  DHHR removed  Karter from  the  placement but did  not revoke the foster \nmother’s license. DHHR failed to locate another foster home for Karter and placed him in a \ntemporary shelter where he remained for the next three months. All the while, Karter believed he \nwould be returned to his mother as soon as she was drug-free.  \n171.  During this time, Karter attended a court hearing related to his case. He was \nshocked when his mother testified that she wished to voluntarily relinquish her parental rights. \nKarter laid down on the courtroom floor and sobbed uncontrollably, pleading with his mother to \n \n42 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 43 of 105 PageID #: 43\nchange her mind. Karter’s caseworker did not prepare him in advance for this news, and upon \ninformation and belief, failed to obtain any therapeutic supports for Karter afterwards. \n172.  Karter’s non-kinship foster home was his only community placement since \nentering foster care. For the past three years, DHHR has shuffled Karter between at least three \ntemporary shelters and institutional care settings. Karter’s stay at each of the temporary shelters \nexceeded DHHR’s 30-day limit.  \n173.  Emergency shelter care is supposed to be a short-term placement while DHHR \nconducts an organized search for an appropriate, long-term placement for the child. It is possible \nto request an extension for another 30 days, but anything beyond that violates DHHR policy.  \n174.  Karter does not like living in emergency shelters or residential facilities. He \nprefers to be in a foster home. Karter stated, “I only got one chance for a foster home and then I \nwas never given another chance.” \n175.  Karter is diagnosed with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and attention-\ndeficit/hyperactivity disorder. Further, he struggles with depression and self-harming behaviors. \nHe benefits from behavioral therapy but has experienced many interruptions in his treatment due \nto DHHR’s lack of appropriate placement planning. Upon information and belief, DHHR has \nsecured an array of psychotropic medications for him but has not offered treatment to address the \nroot causes of his mental health problems through therapy. Notably, while at the Paul Miller \nTemporary Shelter, he was prescribed 32 pills per day.  \n176.  While in the state’s custody, Karter was placed into at least two psychiatric \nresidential treatment facilities: Highland Hospital and River Park Hospital. At each placement, he \nwas prescribed multiple psychotropic medications that made him feel “numbed and flat.”  \n177.  Karter is currently placed at ChildHelp, a 61-bed private psychiatric residential \n \n43 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 44 of 105 PageID #: 44\ntreatment center, in Virginia. This is located more than five hours away from Karter’s home. He \nis educated on campus and must obtain permission every time he wants to go outside. \n178.  At ChildHelp, Karter has engaged in self-harming behaviors twice. One time he \nbanged his head against the wall repeatedly and another he stabbed himself in the wrist with a \nmechanical pencil. In a report, Karter’s therapist indicated that she believed that this was the result \nof Karter feeling that his caseworker had given up on him and that he would never be placed in a \nfoster home. Upon information and belief, when Karter has called his caseworker, she has taken \nweeks to return his calls. \n179.  Karter has often told his caseworker that he wants to have a connection with his \ngrandfather. This past spring, Karter learned that his grandfather had a terminal illness and was \nabout to pass away. Desperate to connect with him, Karter left several urgent voice messages and \nemails for his caseworker. Upon information and belief, staff at ChildHelp also attempted to \ncontact the caseworker without success. Karter’s caseworker never responded to either Karter or \nthe staff at the facility, and his grandfather passed away before Karter had the chance to speak with \nhim.  At the next court appearance Karter explained his feelings to the court with the support of \nstaff from ChildHelp, and the judge removed Karter’s caseworker from his case. Yet, upon \ninformation and belief, DHHR continues to employ her. \n180.  This was not the first caseworker the judge removed from Karter’s case. Upon \ninformation and belief, the judge removed Karter’s original caseworker, who displayed a callous \ndisregard for Karter and spoke disparagingly about him. Upon information and belief, DHHR \ncontinues to employ that caseworker also. \n181.  Karter yearns for a normal childhood: “I want a loving home, I want to attend a \nnormal school. I want to be able to go outside without needing to ask permission every time, and \n \n44 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 45 of 105 PageID #: 45\nI want to know friends and school kids my age.” Upon information and belief, DHHR is making \nno efforts to return Karter to his home community let alone to West Virginia.   \n182.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Karter has suffered and \ncontinues to suffer emotional and psychological harm. Specifically, if Defendants had made \nreasonable professional judgments, engaged in reasonable case planning and placement matching, \nnot acted in disregard of professional standards as to the management of Karter’s case, and not \nacted  with  deliberate  indifference  to  his  legal  rights,  Defendants  may  well  have  prevented \nadditional trauma Karter has suffered while in the custody of DHHR. \nAce L. \n183.  Ace L. is 12 years old and has been in the care and custody of DHHR since \n2016. This is Ace’s second episode in foster care. Ace is a member of the General Class and the \nADA Subclass. Ace appears through his next friend Isabelle Santillion. Ms. Santillion is Ace’s \nadult sister and has known him his entire life. She has maintained close contact with her brother \nduring his time in foster care, and she is committed to representing his best interests in this case.  \n184.  Ace and his family have had multiple interactions with DHHR over the course \nof his life, resulting in two removals and placements into foster care. When Ace was four years \nold, DHHR placed him and his 13-year-old sister into foster care based on allegations that his \nmother and stepfather were physically and sexual abusive towards the children. DHHR initially \nplaced the siblings together in a foster home, where they remained for 18 months.  \n185.  Ace suffers from encopresis, which is frequently related to physical and sexual \ntrauma. When Ace had accidents the foster parents “whooped” Ace with their hands or with a belt. \nUpon information and belief, Isabelle reported this to the caseworker, but the caseworker did \nnothing. Upon information and belief, Ace received no therapeutic interventions to address the \n \n45 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 46 of 105 PageID #: 46\nunderlying abuse or his encopresis.   \n186.  DHHR returned Ace and his sister to their mother’s home after she completed \nan improvement period and agreed to exclude the stepfather from the home.  \n187.  But the child abuse soon resumed. Ace’s mother abused drugs and, over the \nyears, left him at home in the care of her boyfriends and Ace’s stepfather. During those times a \nnumber of people physically, sexually, and emotionally abused Ace.    \n188.   In 2016, DHHR again removed nine-year-old Ace and his sister. This time \nDHHR immediately separated Ace and his sister. Ace relied on his sister as the only stable “adult” \nand protector in his life.  \n189.  During Ace’s second episode in foster care, his mother relinquished her parental \nrights to him. Ace was abused in his new foster home and ridiculed almost daily at school for his \nencopresis.  \n190.  His placement disrupted, and in the following years, DHHR bounced Ace from \nplacement to placement. Upon information and belief, Ace’s placements often disrupted due to his \nencopresis; other foster children taunted and made fun of Ace, and he, in turn, isolated himself and \nbecame depressed or acted out in anger. Foster parents have indicated that they are unwilling to \ndeal with Ace’s “hygiene issues.” With each disrupted placement, Ace has felt rejected and his \nperception is that he is  broken and unwanted.   \n191.  When Ace was 11 years old, he started suffering from depression and anxiety. \nDHHR placed him at Highland Psychiatric Hospital in their ‘Bound for Success’ program. A \nfellow resident relentlessly made fun of  Ace for his encopresis. The hospital staff did not \neffectively shield Ace from the daily torment, and Ace acted out with bursts of anger. Ace was \nplaced on a cocktail of off-label medications that made him drowsy and “out of it” during most of \n \n46 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 47 of 105 PageID #: 47\nhis waking hours. The hospital routinely experimented with Ace’s medications and dosages trying \ndifferent combinations for trial periods, leaving Ace without a consistent pharmaceutical plan.  \n192.  During Ace’s 10-month stay at Highland Hospital he only attended a non-\naccredited learning program that consisted of a couple of hours of teaching instruction per day, \nalongside other residents of various ages and academic capabilities.  \n193.  Over the years, DHHR has also placed Ace in a number of institutional or group \nhome placements, including Greenbrier Valley Children’s Home, Highland’s Bound for Success \nprogram, Child Help East, Inc., and New River Ranch.  \n194.  After Ace’s stay at Highland Hospital, he lived with his 20-year-old sister \nIsabelle.  However, she was provided little support, despite requesting it from the caseworker, and \nstruggled to provide the care that Ace needed when she was also parenting an infant.   \n195.  Ace left his sister’s home and is currently placed at a temporary shelter in \nCharleston called the Davis Child Shelter. Although his placement has already exceeded the 60-\nday limit, DHHR has failed to find another placement for him.  \n196.  Ace has completed the sixth grade but feels that he is significantly behind his \npeers. He has been in so many different schools and placements that he has been unable to keep \nup educationally.  \n197.  While on paper Ace’s permanency plan is adoption, DHHR has made no efforts \nto effectuate the plan even though Ace has been freed for adoption for approximately three years.  \nAce believes that his future only holds institutional placements that do not meet his needs. \n198.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Ace has suffered and \ncontinues to suffer emotional and psychological harm. Specifically, if Defendants had made \nreasonable professional judgments, engaged in reasonable case planning and placement matching, \n \n47 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 48 of 105 PageID #: 48\nnot acted in disregard of professional standards as to the management of Ace’s case, and not acted \nwith deliberate indifference to his legal rights, Defendants may well have prevented additional \ntrauma Ace has suffered while in the custody of the DHHR.   \nFederal and State Requirements for Child Protection Systems \n \nI.  The  United  States  Constitution  and  Federal  Law  Impose  Certain \nRequirements for the West Virginia Child Welfare System. \n \n199.  The  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  United  States  Constitution  imposes  an \naffirmative obligation upon state and local child welfare officials to: \na.  ensure that each child placed in foster care is free from the foreseeable risk \nof physical, mental, and emotional harms; \nb.  ensure that each child placed in foster care receives the services necessary \nto ensure their physical, mental, intellectual, and emotional wellbeing in the \nleast restrictive environment; \nc.  provide each child placed in foster care with conditions, treatment, and care \nconsistent with the purpose and assumption of custody; \nd.  ensure that each child placed in foster care is not maintained in custody \nlonger than is necessary to accomplish the purpose of custody; and \ne.  provide each child placed in foster care with reasonable efforts to obtain an \nappropriate permanent home and family within a reasonable period of time. \n200.  Federal law requires that state and local child welfare officials: \n \na.  Place each child in foster care in a foster placement that conforms to \nnationally recommended professional standards, 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(10); \nb.  Provide for each child placed in foster care a written case plan that includes \na plan to provide safe, appropriate, and stable foster care placements and \n \n48 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 49 of 105 PageID #: 49\nimplement that plan, 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(A); \nc.  Provide for each child placed in foster care, where reunification is not \npossible or appropriate, a written case plan that ensures the location of an \nappropriate adoptive or other permanent home for the child and implement \nthat plan, 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(E); \nd.  Provide for each child placed in foster care a written case plan that ensures \nthe educational stability of the child while in foster care and implement that \nplan, 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(G); \ne.  Maintain a case review system in which each child in foster care has a case \nplan  designed  to  achieve  safe,  appropriate,  and  stable  foster  care \nplacements, 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(5)(A); \nf.  Maintain a case review system in which the status of each child in foster \ncare is reviewed every six months by a court, or person responsible for case \nmanagement,  for  purposes  of  determining  the  safety  of  the  child,  the \ncontinuing necessity and appropriateness of the foster placement, the extent \nof  compliance  with  the  permanency  plan,  and  the  projected  date  of \npermanency, 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(5)(B), 675(5)(C); \ng.  Maintain a case review system that ensures that for each child in foster care \nfor 15 of the most recent 22 months, the responsible child welfare agency \nfiles a petition to terminate the parental rights of the child’s parents and \nconcurrently identifies, recruits, processes, and approves a qualified family \nfor an adoption, or documents compelling reasons for determining that \nfiling such a petition would not be in the best interests of the child, 42 U.S.C. \n \n49 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 50 of 105 PageID #: 50\n§§ 671(a)(16), 675(5)(B), 675(5)(E); and \nh.  Provide to each child in foster care quality services to protect his or her \nsafety and health, 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(22). \n201.  In  addition,  the  American  with  Disabilities  Act  requires  that  DHHR  provide \nchildren who experience physical, mental, intellectual or cognitive disabilities, with an array of \ncommunity-based placements and services to ensure access to the least restrictive environment.  \nSee 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2), 29 U.S.C. § 794, and the respective implementing regulations; 42 U.S.C. \n§ 622(b)(8)(A)(iii); and 42 U.S.C. § 675(5)(A). \nII.  West  Virginia’s  Laws  Also  Impose  Requirements  on  the  Child  Welfare \nSystem. \n \n202.  The West Virginia State Legislature has committed itself to ensuring that every \nchild in the state’s foster care system “grow[s] to reach his or her potential . . . .” W.Va. Code § \n49-2-126. In doing so, the state statutorily recognizes children’s rights to a family; a safe home \nfree of violence, abuse, neglect, and danger; an education; and participation in extracurricular \nactivities and community events. See id.  \n203.  The West Virginia State Legislature has enacted laws to provide a coordinated \nsystem of child welfare and juvenile justice for children in the state. The goals of these laws are, \namong other things, to “assure each child care, safety and guidance; [s]erve the mental and physical \nwelfare of the child; [p]reserve and strengthen the child’s family ties; [and] [r]ecognize the \nfundamental rights of children and parents . . . .” W.Va. Code § 49-1-1. \n204.  DHHR is the custodian of and responsible for the safety and wellbeing of children \nin West Virginia’s child welfare system. See W.Va. Code § 49-2-1. DHHR is charged with \nadvising, assisting, and supervising all child welfare agencies which care for neglected children. \nSee W.Va. Code § 49-2-3. DHHR is an umbrella agency that operates through several different \n \n50 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 51 of 105 PageID #: 51\nbureaus, each responsible for specific programs and services related to public health and the \nwellbeing of the citizens of West Virginia.  \n205.  The Bureau of Children and Families (BCF), a subdivision of DHHR, is responsible \nfor administering the State’s child welfare system, including the fostering and adoption of West \nVirginia children. See W.Va. Code § 49-1-105. BCF ensures that children in out-of-home care and \ntheir  families  receive  adequate  and  appropriate  services  that  meet  their  needs  for  safety, \npermanency, and wellbeing to help them achieve their “maximum potential and improve their \nquality of life.” W.Va. CPS Policy § 1.3. Also, BCF is responsible for developing all policies and \nprograms pertaining to child welfare and conducts ongoing research and evaluation of the system \nto identify areas in need of improvement.  \n206.  BCF divides the state into four regions that it serves: Region I, Region II, Region \nIII, and Region IV. \n207.  BCF operates a Centralized Intake Unit, available 24 hours per day, to receive \nreports of suspected child abuse or neglect. The intake worker assesses whether there is reasonable \ncause to believe that child abuse or neglect exists. If so, a referral is made to a CPS worker who \nwill investigate the allegations. The worker will then meet with the family and conduct a Family \nFunctioning Assessment to determine if the child is safe. DHHR has 30 days from the date of the \nreport to complete the Family Functioning Assessment.  \n208.  If the Family Functioning Assessment reveals that the child is in need of protection \nand cannot safely remain in the home, the caseworker files a petition with the appropriate circuit \ncourt alleging that the child is abused or neglected and requests permission to take custody of the \nchild pursuant to an out-of-home safety plan. The safety plan must identify an appropriate \nplacement and the length of time the child is to remain there. In addition, the caseworker must \n \n51 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 52 of 105 PageID #: 52\nconduct a child assessment prior to placement to determine the child’s needs.  \n209.  A removal may occur on an emergency basis, before the filing of a petition, if the \nCPS worker believes the child would be in imminent danger if left in the home.  \n210.  After placing a child into foster care, the caseworker is required to conduct a \ndiligent search for relatives who may be able to provide kinship care, or take steps to involve \nknown relatives in the child’s life while he or she is in placement. Also, the caseworker must \nschedule an initial health check appointment immediately.  \n211.  West Virginia’s child welfare system is further required to adopt procedures and \nprograms that are family-focused and involve the child and family caregiver in the planning and \ndelivery of such programs and to provide early intervention to respond to and prevent child abuse \nand neglect.  W.Va. Code § 49-1-5,6, 8. \n212.  The State, through DHHR must provide services that are “community-based, in the \nleast restrictive settings that are consonant with the needs and potentials of the child and his or her \nfamily.” W.Va. Code § 49-1-7. \n213.  West Virginia recognizes the need to provide appropriate placements that will offer \n“the best care possible for every child who is in the custody of the state” by placing the child in \nthe “least restrictive (most family-like) setting” able to accommodate, among other things, that \nchild’s medical needs, educational needs, psychological and emotional characteristics, and family \nvisitation requirements. W.Va. Foster Care Policy §§ 1.16, 2.1.2. \n214.  For every child involved in an abuse and neglect case, West Virginia law recognizes \nthe critical importance of well-informed planning for treatment, placement, and permanency and \nrequires court orders to be informed by multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings. See W.Va. Code \n§ 49-4-405. The MDTs are critical and serve as the “Central Point for decision making during the \n \n52 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 53 of 105 PageID #: 53\nlife of a case.” DHHR Foster Care Policy § 4.1. They must be arranged within 30 days of filing an \nabuse and neglect petition. See id. Importantly, the participants must approve the caseworker’s \ncase plan that will be submitted to the court. See id. The case plan includes the service and \npermanency plan. See id. These meetings are supposed to be held at least every 90 days or in \nadvance of every major decision. See id.  \n215.  Each child must also receive a monthly in-person visit with DHS caseworker staff, \nand the staffer must determine if the child’s needs are being met and determine if their needs have \nchanged. See W.Va. Foster Care Policy §§ 5.2.1-3. \n216.  In 2005, the West Virginia legislature created the Commission to Study Residential \nPlacement of Children after finding that the state’s current system of serving children and families \nin need of or at risk of needing social, emotional and/or behavioral health services was fragmented, \nresulting in financial waste, duplication of efforts, and poor collaboration among functional \nprograms. The Commission was intended to bring transparency to the issues plaguing the system, \nincluding practices of placing children, the adequacy, capacity, availability and utilization of \nplacements,  staffing  issues,  oversight  of  multidisciplinary  team  meetings,  availability  of \ncommunity-based  alternatives  to  residential  placements,  methods  to  reduce  out-of-state \nplacements, and many more critical components of a child welfare system.  \n217.  In 2010, a Senate Bill was passed to reconstitute the Commission. See W.Va. Code \n§ 49-2-125.  However, the Commission has taken little to no action beyond organizing working \ngroups. \nSystemic Deficiencies Plague West Virginia’s Child Welfare System \nI.  Child and Family Service Reviews & State Audit \n \n218.  Since the early 2000s, the Children’s Bureau of the United States Department of \n \n53 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 54 of 105 PageID #: 54\nHealth and Human Services has conducted audits of each state’s child welfare system.  These \naudits are called Child and Family Service Reviews (“CFSRs”). West Virginia has been evaluated \nthree times through the CFSR process: October 2002, May 2009 and late 2017.   \n219.  The CFSRs evaluate seven “outcomes” of the safety, wellbeing and permanency of \nchildren in foster care—the three objectives of all child welfare systems, pursuant to federal \nstatutory law. The CFSRs also report on seven “systemic factors,” which are practices and \nstructures that affect the delivery of foster care services. Taken together, these fourteen metrics are \nmeant to provide a comprehensive analysis tool for each state; by identifying areas of weakness, \nstates can work towards implementing corrective actions to ultimately improve outcomes for \nchildren.   \n220.  Outcomes for West Virginia’s children have not improved since the CFSR process \nwas initiated. Rather, West Virginia’s performance has worsened in each subsequent CFSR.  In \nthe initial October 2002 CFSR, West Virginia did not achieve any of the “outcomes” relating to \nthe permanency, safety or wellbeing of children in foster care, but notably was in substantial \nconformity with six of the seven “systemic factors.”  In the subsequent May 2009 audit, West \nVirginia had not improved; the state still did not achieve any of the “outcomes” and was in \nsubstantial conformity with just four of the “systemic factors.” \n221.  West Virginia received its worst audit on the 2017 CFSR; the state again did not \nachieve any of the “outcomes” relating to the permanency, safety and wellbeing of children in \ncare, and was in substantial conformity with only three of the seven “systemic factors.” The \nChildren’s Bureau conducted a review of 65 cases to make its determinations for the achievement \nof its safety, permanency and wellbeing “outcomes.” In the area of safety, the Children’s Bureau \ndecided that “children are, first and foremost, protected from abuse and neglect” in only 56 percent \n \n54 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 55 of 105 PageID #: 55\nof applicable cases in its review. The Children’s Bureau determined that just 20 percent of the \nchildren in the case review had “permanency and stability in their living situations.” DHHR is also \nstruggling to provide for the wellbeing of children in its care; the Children’s Bureau determined \nthat families had “enhanced capacity to provide for children’s needs” in just 26 percent of the cases \nreviewed. For all of these three “outcomes,” 95 percent of cases would have needed to meet the \nmetric in order to be in “substantial conformity.” \n222.  West Virginia struggles on many of its “systemic factors,” which are measures of \nhow the child welfare structure functions. For example, the state did not achieve conformity with \nthe Children’s Bureau’s requirements for its Case Review System. For the “Written Case Plan” \nitem, interviews revealed that case plans are “generally not developed jointly with parents”; \ninterviewees reported that although the “intent” is often there, large caseloads prevent parental \ninvolvement in case planning.     \n223.  The 2017 CFSR also indicated that West Virginia was not in conformity with the \n“Service Array and Resource Development” item. The Children’s Bureau noted: “the two areas of \ngreatest need for which services and resources are lacking are substance abuse treatment and the \navailability of foster homes.” The agency also struggles to provide support in the following areas: \nmental health services for children, kinship family support services and housing. Ultimately, \nservices in West Virginia do not meet the needs of children and families.  \n224.  The “Diligent Recruitment of Foster and Adoptive Homes” was marked as an area \nthat “needed improvement” in the 2017 CFSR. DHHR had no “statewide coordinated efforts” to \nrecruit new resource homes for the increasing foster care population; rather, the agency relies on \nkinship homes and re-evaluation. The reviewers were told that “the shortage of homes has resulted \nin children sometimes sleeping in offices and being placed in shelter care.” \n \n55 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 56 of 105 PageID #: 56\n225.  State reviews have also highlighted significant issues in child welfare. \n226.  In a February 2013 Legislative Audit Report, the Performance Evaluation and \nResearch Division (“PERD”) of the West Virginia Legislative Auditor’s Office expressed concern \nover West Virginia having the highest and second highest incidence of child deaths related to abuse \nand neglect in the nation for six of the 12 years between 2000 and 2011. The audit found that the \ndata collected on child fatalities in West Virginia was poorly documented. Moreover, no statewide \nperformance data was being gathered to determine the state’s needs for training, policy, or field \nimprovements that could reduce future child fatalities and near fatalities.  \n227.  In recent years, West Virginia has continued to have higher rates of abuse and/or \nneglect-related child fatalities. In 2016, the national average was 2.36 deaths per 100,000; West \nVirginia had an average of 5.33, approximately double the national average, surpassed only by \nMississippi. Near fatalities of children known to DHRR due to abuse or neglect have steadily risen.   \nII.  West Virginia Has an Inadequate Array of Appropriate Foster Placements  \n228.  There are nearly 6,800 children in out-of-home placements in West Virginia. \nBut West Virginia suffers a shortage of foster homes and other placement types to handle the rising \nnumber of children who are removed from their homes and placed in foster care. \n229.  This problem is specifically acute for children with disabilities, who have higher \ntherapeutic needs. Indeed, children who are diagnosed with physical, mental, intellectual, or \ncognitive disabilities often find their health conditions worsen while in foster care. \n230.  Because DHHR does not have enough placements for children, when they are \nfirst removed DHHR will often force them to sleep in DHHR offices or hotels until placements  \nare identified.  \n231.  DHHR contracts with private foster care agencies who perform foster home \ninspections,  training,  licensing,  and  monitoring  of  foster  homes.  These  agencies  are  also \n \n56 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 57 of 105 PageID #: 57\nresponsible for recruiting foster parents. Recruiting foster families can be a difficult task, but is \neven more challenging in West Virginia because DHHR has a reputation for treating foster families \npoorly and retaliating against them. Upon information and belief, DHHR caseworkers routinely \nexclude foster parents from MDT meetings, verbally threaten to remove children from foster \nparents’ care when they engage in any sort of advocacy that challenges the caseworkers’ orders, \nare difficult to contact in crisis situations (such as when consent is needed for medical or behavioral \nhealth care), and often speak disrespectfully towards foster parents.  \n232.  The  Office of Health Facility Licensure and Certification, a subdivision within \nDHHR, licenses and monitors residential and congregate care facilities.  \n233.  DHHR places children in foster care in a number of different placement types, \nincluding, but not limited to, licensed kinship care; unlicensed kinship care; non-kinship care; \ngroup  residential  care,  which  includes  residential  treatment  facilities;  psychiatric  residential \ntreatment facilities, and psychiatric hospitals; emergency shelter care; transitional living; and out-\nof-state placements.  \n234.  In total, there are approximately 70 congregate care facilities in West Virginia, \nincluding 50 residential facilities, ranging amongst three different service levels, 15 emergency \nshelters, five psychiatric residential treatment facilities, three facilities for mentally disabled youth, \nand two transitional living facilities.  \n235.  As of August 2019, DHHR reported that it had placed only 246 (less than four \npercent) of children in foster care in agency foster homes and approximately 25 percent of children \nin therapeutic foster care. But DHHR divides its therapeutic program into three tiers, and tier one \nis simply traditional foster family care, which draws into question how it categorizes its data.  \n236.  Additionally, nearly 20 percent of children were placed in unlicensed kinship \n \n57 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 58 of 105 PageID #: 58\ncare; approximately 30 percent were placed in licensed kinship care; and approximately 13 percent \nwere placed in group residential facilities, including long-term psychiatric facilities, both in and \nout of state. Notably, of those placed in group residential facilities, nearly 30 percent were sent out \nof state.  \n237.  Upon  information  and  belief,  West  Virginia’s  foster  care  system  is  so \noverwhelmed, and there is such an acute shortage of adequate foster home placements, that DHHR \nroutinely shuffles children from temporary placement to temporary placement, disregarding their \nunique needs. For instance, DHHR has resorted to placing and leaving children in emergency \nshelters past the permitted time frames, and when forced to move them elsewhere has merely \nmoved them to new shelters to start the clock anew. In other instances, DHHR has refrained from \nremoving children from known abusive or neglectful homes; temporarily housed children in \novercrowded foster homes; placed children in poorly screened kinship homes; and indiscriminately \ninstitutionalized children, especially those with disabilities, in violation of federal prohibitions on \nsegregating people with disabilities away from their homes and communities. \n238.  These  actions  are  direct  violations  of  federal  law  and  widely  accepted \nprofessional standards, which  require West Virginia to ensure that each child in its custody is \nplaced in the most appropriate, least restrictive placement available, consistent with the child’s \nneeds.  \n239.  The lack of appropriate placements and lack of placement matching ultimately \nresult in additional placements for children in foster care in West Virginia, despite clear goals in \nthe child welfare field to minimize the number of placements and moves that children experience.  \n240.  Moreover, children placed in temporary placements often lose continuity of \nschooling, are often not placed with siblings, and often experience disruption of, or unavailability \n \n58 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 59 of 105 PageID #: 59\nof, mental, medical, behavioral, and other health services they need.  \n241.  What is more, Defendants are losing hundreds of foster children each year. \nIndeed, in 2018, West Virginia reported that 791 children had run away from its foster care system. \nIn 2019, 651 foster children have run away from their placements thus far. Most of these runaways \nare boys between the ages of 13 and 17 who DHHR had placed in group homes or emergency \nshelters.  \n242.  Defendant Samples voiced concerns about possible sex trafficking of these \nmissing children in testimony, stating, “when we talk about sex trafficking and dangers of the \nmodern world—it’s just an alarming number that we have to find some solutions to.”  \n243.  West Virginia’s lack of foster care placements, and resulting over-reliance on \ntemporary  placements  and  institutional  care,  substantially  departs  from  widely  accepted \nprofessional standards,  violates  federal  law  prohibiting  discrimination,  and  demonstrates  a \ndeliberate indifference to the risk of harm to the Plaintiffs and the classes they represent.   \nIII.  Placement Instability Harms Children. \n244.  West  Virginia  subjects  foster  children  to  multiple  placement  moves \nexacerbating the trauma that the children are already experiencing as a result of their removals. \nDefendants have acknowledged they have an insufficient placement array, an insufficient number \nof placement resources, and an insufficient number of homes that are willing to accept older \nchildren, children with severe behavioral issues, and large sibling groups. Moreover, there is no \nmechanism in place to accurately and appropriately match children who are coming into the foster \ncare system with foster care providers.   \n245.  This results in a significant number of unnecessary and harmful placement \nchanges for foster children. In 2017, 59 percent of foster children who had spent 24 months or \n \n59 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 60 of 105 PageID #: 60\nmore in foster care had three or more placements.   \n246.  For instance, DHHR has placed seven year-old Theo S., one of the Named \nPlaintiffs, in at least a dozen foster care placements. DHHR shuffled another Named Plaintiff, \nKarter W., amongst at least three temporary shelters and residential facilities as well as two \npsychiatric  residential  treatment  facilities.  And  DHHR  has  placed  Gretchen  C.  in  multiple \ntemporary shelters, four group homes, and an out-of-state institution. \n247.  Even  kinship  placements,  which  historically  have  shown  to  have  greater \nstability, are not immune. A recent study concluded that “it is not unusual that a relative/kinship \ncaregiver will not see a caseworker after the original placement.” One consequence is disruptions \nin placements.    \n248.  It is agreed among behavioral therapists, policy makers, and child welfare \nadvocates that permanency is the most important factor affecting a foster child’s wellbeing. The \nnegative implications of placement instability for permanency goals are compounded because each \nnew placement delays permanency, and statistically, there is a direct correlation between the \namount of time a child spends in foster care and the number of placements that child will \nexperience.   \n249.  Continuous movement has a substantial and immeasurable negative effect on a \nchild’s outcomes related to their psychological, emotional, behavioral, social, cognitive, and \nmental wellbeing as well. \n250.  Placement instability poses a greater risk of harm toward young children due to \nthe fragility of their developing brains. Neuroscientists have found that placement instability can \nfundamentally and permanently alter the functioning of key neural systems involved in learning, \nmemory, and self-regulation. One study examining the performance in neuropsychological tasks \n \n60 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 61 of 105 PageID #: 61\nof a group of preschool-aged foster children found that those with multiple placements performed \nsignificantly worse than those with stable placements.   \n251.  West Virginia’s own case law touches upon this. In In re R.J.M, 164 W.Va. 496 \n(1980), Chief Justice Neely stated that, “numerous placements [at an early age] may severely retard \nthe child's ability to form lasting attachments.” \n252.  Placement stability also plays a critical role in the development of adolescent-\naged foster children. Problems linked to a lack of placement stability in adolescent children include \nsubstance abuse, juvenile arrests, failing out of school, social network disruption, and mental \nhealth issues. Research shows that children who age out of foster care systems are more likely to \nexperience negative life outcomes, such as premature pregnancy, incarceration and homelessness. \nFurther, placement instability in adolescent children greatly inhibits academic achievement. \n253.  DHHR  acknowledges  that  “frequent  moves  to  new  placements  left  many \nchildren with little sense of stability or continuity in their lives.” DHHR Foster Care Policy § 1.1. \nThe three most pressing goals of any child welfare agency—safety, permanency, and wellbeing—\nare negatively impacted when a child is not provided placement stability. Frequent moves while \nin  foster  care  are  associated  with  maltreatment,  delays  in  permanency,  poorer  educational \noutcomes, and increased mental health issues. Even worse, sex traffickers target children who have \nunstable home lives, particularly foster children, and who are unattached to caring adults.  \n254.  Yet, the 2017 CFSR federal auditors continue to find that “the needs of foster \nparents [in West Virginia] are not consistently assessed,” and service provision is often inadequate, \n“potentially adversely affecting a child’s placement stability.” According to that same report, West \nVirginia was in “substantial conformity” with only “20% of the 40 applicable cases reviewed” for \nthe item “Children have permanency and stability in their living situations.” \n \n61 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 62 of 105 PageID #: 62\n255.  DHHR subjects children in West Virginia’s foster care system to the harm, and \nrisk of harm, of placement instability, and has long known the negative consequences of doing so, \nyet has failed to take action to address this issue, which substantially departs from widely accepted \nprofessional standards and demonstrates a deliberate indifference to the risk of harm to the \nPlaintiffs and the classes they represent.  \nIV.  Defendants Fail to Properly Support Foster Children in Kinship Placements, \nPutting Them at Increased Risk of Harm.  \n \n256.  West Virginia relies heavily on kinship placements, with nearly half of the \nState’s foster care population residing with relatives—20 percent of whom are unlicensed.  \n257.  But West Virginia fails to keep kinship-placed children free from harm or the \nrisk of harm. Instead, Defendants operate a kinship program that regularly allows for short-cuts \nand side-steps of many of the child protective policies and practices. West Virginia fails to ensure \nthat the kinship homes are safe, children in kinship placements receive critical services, kinship \ncaregivers are properly trained, and sufficient monetary supports are provided. \n258.  Kinship caregivers are a critical component of West Virginia’s foster care \nsystem. Over the last five years, the number of children taken into custody by DHHR through \nremovals as a result of abuse and neglect has increased significantly—by approximately 67 \npercent. Because West Virginia has been unable to secure an adequate supply of foster homes and \nkinship placements are generally favored over stranger foster parents by child welfare advocates, \nthe state heavily relies on kinship caregivers to help absorb this influx of foster children. But \nDefendants are not managing the kinship program safely. \n259.  As of August 31, 2019, West Virginia  reported that 6,796 children were in foster \ncare. Of these, 49 percent (3,347) were placed in kinship homes, as compared to five years ago \nwhen only 15 percent (663 out of a total of 4,299 foster children) were placed in kinship homes. \n \n62 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 63 of 105 PageID #: 63\nIndeed, West Virginia has significantly increased its reliance upon kinship caregivers to help \nmanage the dramatic increase in their foster care population. Child welfare experts generally prefer \nkinship placements over stranger foster home placements but it is critical to the child’s wellbeing, \nsafety, and permanency that the homes and caregivers are properly vetted and that children are \nproperly supported in the placements. In West Virginia, because approximately 50 percent of the \ntotal foster care population are in kinship homes, a well-functioning kinship program is essential. \nBut in West Virginia, policies and rules designed to protect the kinship-placed child population \nare routinely disregarded, resulting in harm or risk thereof to these children. \n260.  To ensure the safety of children placed with relatives, kinship homes must meet \nthe same standards as certified foster homes. West Virginia, however, does not require all kinship \nplacements to be certified and a significant portion of children are placed in uncertified homes. \nUpon information and belief, DHHR regularly discourages kinship caregivers from seeking foster \nhome certification by either failing to inform them of their option to become certified, or by \n“warning” them that they will likely not meet the certification requirements and may instead risk \nlosing the foster children if they seek certification.  \n261.  According to DHHR policy, uncertified kinship homes are required to complete \nthe same home study as certified foster homes. However, this policy is not enforced. Upon \ninformation and belief, the home study is often waived or significantly abridged.  Caseworkers \nroutinely submit waiver requests to the Regional Home Finding Supervisor in FACTS , DHHR’s \ndata system that it shares with the foster care agencies, and approval of the waivers are  often \nrubber stamped. This means that caregiver qualifications are not critically evaluated and little if \nany effort is made to assess the safety or adequacy of the homes or the ability of the placements to \nmeet the needs of vulnerable children. \n \n63 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 64 of 105 PageID #: 64\n262.  Under DHHR’s Home Finding Policy, before a child is placed in a home, DHHR \nmust complete background checks for all adult occupants in the home. Upon information and \nbelief, in practice DHHR fails to conduct a diligent search aimed at identifying all of the adults \nwho either reside in the home or have unrestricted access to the home. Instead, DHHR focuses \ntheir  background  checks  narrowly  on  only  the  intended  caregiver.  DHHR’s  limited-scope \nbackground check practice places all kinship-placed children at risk of exposure to further abuse \nand neglect. \n263.  To ensure the safety of kinship-placed children,  kinship  caregivers should \ncomplete the same training as certified foster parents. Upon information and belief, although West \nVirginia’s policy requires kinship caregivers to complete the requisite training, they often do not. \nInstead,  DHHR  either  routinely  approves  caseworkers’  requests  to  waive  the  important \nrequirement or cherry-picks a limited set of trainings for the kinship caregiver to attend based on \na cursory review of their skills.  \n264.  The  needs  and  challenges  faced  by  kinship  families  are  oftentimes  more \ndemanding or intense than those faced by unrelated foster caregivers for two reasons: (1) generally, \nthey are grandparents, and, thus, an older generation who have not parented in a long time, and (2) \nunlike those who voluntarily become foster parents, they did not expect to face such a stressful \nand life-altering event. DHHR places these children at risk of harm by placing them with caregivers \nwho are ill-prepared or not properly supported by DHHR to care for trauma-exposed children. \n265.  All children in state custody should receive financial support to help cover the \nunplanned costs for food, clothing, and other necessities. Under West Virginia policy, children in \nuncertified kinship placements receive less funding than is provided to children in certified foster \nhomes. Certified foster parents, whether kinship or non-kinship, receive a monthly subsidy of \n \n64 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 65 of 105 PageID #: 65\n$600, a Medicaid card for the child, clothing vouchers, and other reimbursements. On the other \nhand, uncertified kinship caregivers must rely on public assistance, and many have few financial \nresources to begin with. Uncertified kinship homes frequently struggle to provide even the bare \nnecessities for an unexpected dependent child even when the child is in state foster care custody.  \n266.  Studies show that when a child experiences stress about the provision of basic \nnecessities, it negatively impacts the child’s health, cognitive development, social and emotional \ndevelopment, and academic outcomes. Also, where the placement poses such a financial strain on \nthe caregiver, the placement is at risk of disrupting, and thereby further exposing the child to \ntrauma. \n267.  Further, DHHR is failing to provide kinship placements, both certified and \nuncertified, with adequate casework. The casework requirements are the same for all children \nplaced into foster care, which “includes, but is not limited to, placements in foster family homes \nof relatives, group homes, emergency shelters, residential facilities, child care institutions, and pre-\nadoptive homes.” DHHR Foster Care Policy § 5.2.1.  \n268.  When a child is placed in a kinship home it is the responsibility of the DHHR \ncaseworker to maintain regular contact with the child to ensure that the placement is meeting the \nchild’s needs and that the child is safe. The visits must satisfy the requirements under the Child \nand Family Services Improvement Act, which includes face-to-face visits at least once per month \nwith a majority of those visits occurring in the placement. See 42 U.S.C. § 624(f)(1)(A); see also \nDHHR Foster Care Policy §§ 5.2.2-3. Further, the caseworker is required to provide adequate case \nengagement and planning to ensure that the child is receiving necessary therapeutic services, that \nthere  is  a  plan  for  permanency  in  place,  visits  with  biological  family  are  provided  where \nappropriate, and educational needs are met. \n \n65 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 66 of 105 PageID #: 66\n269.  West Virginia fails to satisfy the casework standards required for their kinship-\nplaced population. Upon information and belief, there is an apparent lower-tier regard for the \nkinship-placed foster children reflected in the lack of effort and time spent by caseworkers to \nmanage these  cases  as compared to  children in  traditional foster placements. There is  less \ncaseworker contact, loose or non-existent permanency planning, and the provision of fewer \nservices. Put simply, DHHR fails to afford children in kinship placements the protections that they \nare entitled to receive under the Constitution and federal laws.  \n270.  For example, DHHR placed Dennis C. with his step-grandmother but failed to \nprovide supportive services to the family, which caused the kinship placement to unnecessarily \ndisrupt.  \n271.  Due to a lack of caseworker engagement, kinship caregivers must figure out \nchildren’s diagnoses, required services, and how to obtain those services on their own. As a result, \nmany children go without supports and services, which are often critical to their wellbeing.  \n272.  In  March  2019,  A  Second  Chance,  Inc.,  a  nationally-\nrecognized kinship care agency, released an assessment of West Virginia’s kinship care program \nconcluding that although the state has shown a commitment to increasing reliance upon kinship \ncaregivers, the state’s ability to properly administer a kinship program is hindered by significant \nsystemic failures that include high caseloads, high turnover, varied interpretations of policy by \nregion, and other administrative challenges. The assessment noted that while complexities in a \nwelfare  system  are  to  be  expected,  West  Virginia’s  particular  issues  posed  a  threat  to  the \nfunctionality and consistency of the kinship system—a system that is responsible for nearly 50 \npercent of the total population of foster children in the state. \n273.  The report found that West Virginia lacks data to support key decisions; has \n \n66 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 67 of 105 PageID #: 67\ninadequate casework to provide much-needed services and supports in homes; has inaccessible \ncaregiver  training  and  education;  and  employs  DHHR  staff  who  struggle  with  a  lack  of \nunderstanding about state laws and policy that govern kinship care placements. The report also \npointed to significant regional variations in key elements of a kinship foster program, including \ninterpretations of critical timelines and the use of placement waivers, resulting in a total lack of \ncohesion from within DHHR around such policies and practices. And the report further found that \n“it is not unusual that a relative/kinship caregiver will not see a caseworker after the original \nplacement.” A SECOND CHANCE, INC., KINSHIP CARE STRENGTHS ASSESSMENT (Presented to West \nVirginia Department of Health and Human Resources, March 2019). \n274.  Defendants  maintain  lower  standards  for  accountability,  casework  engagement, \noversight and adherence to policies, and side-step vetting requirements for kinship placements, all of which \nsubstantially depart from widely accepted professional standards and demonstrate a deliberate indifference \nto the risk of harm to the Plaintiff children brought into and placed in kinship foster care.  \nV.  Defendants are Overly Reliant on Institutional Placements, both in West \nVirginia and Other States.  \n \n275.  West Virginia institutionalizes 71 percent of foster children between the ages of \n12-17 and sends a substantial number of foster children to out-of-state residential facilities, many \nof which are for-profit. As of August 31, 2019,  DHHR placed 314 West Virginia children in out-\nof-state institutions, 245 of which were in group residential care and 69 were in long-term \npsychiatric facilities. In the same month, DHHR placed 630 youth in in-state institutions, 573 of \nwhich were in group residential care and 57 were in long-term psychiatric facilities.   \n276.  DHHR placed several of the Named Plaintiffs in institutional care. For instance, \nDHHR placed Theo S., a seven-year-old boy, in at an institutional facility in Virginia; Karter W., \na 13-year-old boy, in two in-state and one out-of-state psychiatric residential treatment facilities; \n \n67 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 68 of 105 PageID #: 68\nand Gretchen C., a 15-year-old girl, in an out-of-state institution. \n277.  Out-of-state,  for-profit  facilities  have  repeatedly  demonstrated  ineffective \nmanagement practices, lack of staff training, misuse of physical restraints, and deceptive marketing \npractices. Indeed, federal and local governments have called for enhanced oversight of such \nfacilities that deal with children with emotional disabilities.   \n278.  Moreover,  most  of  these  out-of-state  facilities  are  located  far  from  any \npopulation centers. They are generally locked or secure facilities. Children are so distant from their \nfamilies, friends, or other West Virginian ties that maintaining those connections is virtually \nimpossible. \n279.  Youth, during their time at these facilities, have no contact with the community \noutside of other segregated children and staff. Meaningful integration with the community is rarely \npossible. \n280.  Many of these out-of-state placements, have been the subject of criminal and \nlicensure investigations. By way of example: \na.  In 2018, at Abraxas Academy in Morgantown, Pennsylvania, an employee \npled guilty to sexually harassing and twice sexually assaulting a female \nresident.  The  facility  ignored  the  girl’s  complaints  even  though  staff \nmembers  filed  a  number  of  “unusual  incident  reports”  detailing  his \ninappropriate behavior. One supervisor “became so concerned with [his] \nbehavior that she refused to allow him on the girls’ side of the housing area \nduring her periods of supervision.” At that same facility, another employee \nwas terminated after being caught on video assaulting a child. The employee \nstated that, “[a] lot of other stuff staff members did was worse and they were \n \n68 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 69 of 105 PageID #: 69\nable to keep their jobs because it wasn’t on video.” As of June 2019, West \nVirginia housed 10 children at Abraxas Academy at a daily rate of $373.40 \nper child. \nb.  Last year, at the Devereux Behavioral Health Facility located in Viera, \nFlorida, a male employee was terminated after being accused of becoming \nsexually involved with a recently discharged resident of the facility. This \nincident was one of 14 incidents that constituted “sex crimes” reported at \nthe facility between January and August of 2017. As of June 2019, DHHR \nhad placed 15 children at this facility with a daily rate of $409.91 per child. \nc.  In 2017, at a separate Devereaux facility in Kennesaw, Georgia, a male \ntherapist was arrested on charges of both possessing and distributing child \npornography and admitted to “grooming” two teenage boys for the purpose \nof engaging in sexual intercourse with them. There are five West Virginian \nfoster children at this facility, with the state paying a daily rate of $349.67 \nper child. \n281.  As  of  June  2019,  West  Virginia  was  spending  $112,826.78  per  day  or \napproximately $41,181,775 per year to place their children in out-of-state congregate care facilities \nthat are too frequently the subject of investigations that confirm rampant sexual, physical, and \nemotional abuse at the hands of employees who are undertrained and not properly screened. Not \nonly do innocent foster children fall victim to staff, they are also subject to victimization at the \nhands of other  residents—including juvenile delinquents—due to  improper placement, poor \nsupervision, and outright negligence. \n282.  West Virginia’s oversight of the children placed at these facilities is limited at \n \n69 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 70 of 105 PageID #: 70\nbest and substantially departs from widely accepted professional standards and demonstrates a \ndeliberate indifference to the risk of harm to the Plaintiffs and the classes they represent. \nVI.  West Virginia Fails to Employ and Retain a Sufficient Number of Properly \nTrained  Caseworkers  and  its  Caseworkers  Carry  Unreasonably  High \nCaseloads. \n \n283.  DHHR and BCF struggle with high caseworker turnover. And, the caseworkers \nthe agency does employ are poorly trained, ill-equipped to help West Virginian families, and carry \nunmanageable  caseloads.  Caseworkers  are  consistently  unprepared  to  participate  in  critical \nmeetings in which permanency plans will be developed or recommendations made on residential \nplacements. This combination of high turnover and lack of proper training places West Virginia \nchildren at a serious disadvantage compared to children in states with robust and comprehensively \ntrained caseworker networks.  Defendants have known about these issues for over a decade yet \nhave failed to take meaningful action. \n284.  The 2008 federal audit noted that West Virginia’s low performance in regard to \nthe CFSR outcomes was likely attributed to, at least in part, the fact that DHHR experienced a high \nrate  of  turnover  in  the  caseworker  position,  which  accounted  for  inconsistency  in  practice \nthroughout the child welfare system.   \n285.  In  August  2013,  the  West  Virginia  Performance  Evaluation  and  Research \nDivision (PERD) issued an audit related to BCF.  The audit concluded that BCF needed to improve \nits management of child protective services caseworkers by developing a long-term work-force \nplan, crafting retention goals and reliable labor management measures in order to have timelier \ninvestigations, and improving recruitment and retention given the high turnover rates. \n286.  PERD observed that BCF lacked a sense of urgency around these critical issues \nthat had been known for some time and remained unaddressed. According to the PERD audit, BCF \n \n70 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 71 of 105 PageID #: 71\nlacked a clear picture of its own workforce and struggled to respond to requests for the total number \nof allocated CPS positions both statewide and by region.  \n287.  In the PERD audit, the turnover rate for CPS trainees at the state level was 55.35 \npercent, 24.23 percent for CPS workers, and 11.39 percent for supervisors.  PERD concluded that \nsuch high turnover, particularly among trainees, likely created functional difficulties for BCF and \nplaced West Virginia children at risk of further harm.   \n288.  In 2014, DHHR employees, including child welfare caseworkers, picketed \noutside the agency's Fayette County office to  raise awareness over what they called large, \nunmanageable  caseloads,  which  they  claimed  placed  children  at  risk.  They  stated  that  the \nemployees  at  the  area  office  had  caseloads  that  were  two  or  three  times  larger  than  the \nrecommended standard. Upon information and belief, the recommended standards are not public. \n289.  In January 2015, PERD audited BCF and determined that its recommendations \nfrom the 2013 audit related to caseworker retention had not been addressed. \n290.  At the time the audit was issued, some county-level human services and social \nworkers employed by DHHR were handling twice as many cases as those deemed appropriate by \nthe agency’s own caseload standards outlined years before, despite promises from the agency to \nalleviate the heavy caseloads. \n291.  In May 2019, a DHHR manager explained during a child welfare collaborative \nmeeting that retention continued to be a significant problem for BCF and that DHHR had plans to \ndevelop an exit interview and survey protocol in order to find out why caseworkers were leaving. \nSignificantly, six years earlier, the 2013 PERD audit specifically recommended exit interviews \nand noted that properly designed exit interviews could offer significant insight for the reasons CPS \nworkers and trainees were voluntarily leaving their jobs. DHHR ignored this recommendation.   \n \n71 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 72 of 105 PageID #: 72\n292.  Because West Virginia caseworkers remain overburdened, BCF continues to \nhave alarmingly high caseworker turnover and is struggling to fill the vacancies. While 48 new \npositions were added in March 2018 to address increasing caseloads, as of May 2018, 108 of 472 \n(approximately 23 percent of) child welfare positions across the state were vacant. In January 2019, \n213 positions were vacant, amounting to, upon information and belief, a 45 percent vacancy rate \namongst caseworkers.  \n293.  West Virginia’s high caseworker turnover exacerbates problems throughout its \nchild protection system. In fact, West Virginia allows graduates with Bachelor of Arts degrees to \napply  for  provisional  social  work  licenses  where  critical  shortages  exist  at  DHHR.  Upon \ninformation  and  belief,  DHHR  outsources  supervision  of  these  employees  with  provisional \nlicenses to social workers who have a degree and license but are not employed by DHHR. These \nexternal supervisors report that while this was originally intended to apply to individuals with a \nBachelor of Arts in a field related to social work, they have observed that DHHR now includes \nindividuals with completely unrelated degrees. This practice puts West Virginia children at risk of \nharm—these foster children need caseworkers who have the relevant education necessary to \nperform the highly specialized child welfare work they are required to perform. \n294.  In addition to West Virginia’s lax standards for job applicants’ professional \nqualifications, DHHR fails to properly screen potential employees for criminal or drug-related \nhistory. The West Virginia job application for CPS workers specifies that it “may include” looking \ninto criminal records, driving records, abuse registry records, employment history, and education \nand training, among other things. In 2018, a CPS employee, Dustin Kinser was arrested and \ncharged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Upon information and belief, Mr. Kinser \ngained information about a 17-year-old girl using the DHHR FACTS system, and then used that \n \n72 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 73 of 105 PageID #: 73\ninformation to connect with her over social media. She was reported missing for days during which \nit was reported that she stayed with him in a hotel room and his home. At the time that DHHR \nhired Mr. Kinser, he was listed on an abuse registry for a domestic violence but DHHR failed to \ncheck the registry when hiring him.  \n295.  High turnover also results in a failure to ensure that caseworkers maintain \nregular contact with children, parents, and foster parents. Foster children have and will continue \nto suffer harm because their assigned caseworkers are unable to meaningfully assess their safety \nand wellbeing and to facilitate the provision of services that are necessary to reunite them with \ntheir parents or to place them into a safe, permanent home. \n296.  Additionally, West Virginia has failed for years to ensure that its caseworkers \ncarry caseloads consistent with reasonable professional standards. \n297.  Child welfare research has clearly demonstrated that high caseworker caseloads \nnegatively impact children in foster care. Specifically, caseworkers with high caseloads have less \ntime to interact with children, families, and service providers or to provide meaningful and \nappropriate case plans, necessary services, and timely casework and decision-making around \nissues such as permanency planning. It is therefore critical that caseworkers have manageable \ncaseloads.   \n298.  The Child Welfare League of America, a coalition of private and public agencies \nthat develops child welfare policies and promotes sound child welfare practice, has established \nnationally recognized standards for caseworker caseloads.  Those standards governing foster care \ncaseworkers limit caseloads to between 12 and 15 children in foster care per worker. Yet, West \nVirginia caseworkers carry far higher caseloads. \n299.  In  2005,  West  Virginia  Code  Section    9-2-6a  was  passed,  directing  the \n \n73 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 74 of 105 PageID #: 74\nCommissioner of Human Services to develop caseload standards based on the actual duties of \nemployees in each program area of the department, taking into consideration existing professional \ncaseload standards in order to ensure standards are reasonable and achievable. Upon information \nand belief, the commissioner never developed such caseload standards. \n300.  Upon information and belief, it is not uncommon for caseworkers to carry a \ncaseload of up to 50 cases, for DHHR managers to go beyond the scope of their managerial role \nand actually carry an active caseload and, as a result of both, for cases to languish unserviced.   \n301.  Upon information and belief, West Virginia contracts with private agencies to \nassist with their backlog of open pre-custodial investigations to bring them to closure.    \n302.  Upon information and belief, foster parents, kinship caregivers, and foster \nchildren consistently report inadequate communication with their caseworkers citing long periods \nof time during which they never hear from them despite multiple attempts to communicate and \nmultiple messages requesting a return call. \n303.  In 2012, UE Local 170, the union representing DHHR caseworkers, reached an \nagreement with DHHR for the agency to comply with Section 9-2-6a of the West Virginia Code, \nregarding the development of reasonable and achievable caseload standards for its program areas.  \nIn July 2013, caseload standard recommendations, developed by workgroups compromised of \nmembers of the UE Local 170, the West Virginia Chapter of the National Association of Social \nWorkers, and DHHR, were given to then DHHR Secretary Bowlin.   \n304.  Upon receipt of the recommendations, BCF indicated that the results were of \nlimited value given that the study included five classifications of social workers and should have \nhad a work group assigned to study and provide detailed recommendations for implementation.  \nUpon information and belief, the recommendations were never implemented and no further studies \n \n74 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 75 of 105 PageID #: 75\ntook place.  \n305.  The 2017 federal audit noted that DHHR was experiencing higher caseloads and \ngreater  demand  on  limited  resources.  Specifically,  the  findings  included  that  DHHR  had \nexperienced limited success in its efforts to recruit and retain DHHR staff which continued to \nadversely affect outcomes for children and families served by the agency and the delivery of \nservices.  \n306.  Defendant Crouch has acknowledged that child protective caseworkers should \nhave no more than 15 cases.  Yet, he confirmed in an interview in 2018 that in some areas of the \nstate, caseworkers were carrying as high as 25 to 30 cases per caseworker.    \n307.  Ultimately, West Virginia’s failure to employ and retain a sufficient number of \ncaseworkers and ensure that caseworkers carry reasonable caseloads substantially departs from \nwidely accepted professional standards and demonstrates a deliberate indifference to the risk of \nharm to the Plaintiffs and the classes they represent. West Virginia has done little to address the \nneed for more caseworkers in the state other than continually request waivers for professional \nqualifications for caseworkers.  \nVII.  DHHR Performs Inadequate Assessments and Case Planning \n308.  Before the foster care system can provide the services a child needs, it must \nunderstand a child’s needs and create an individualized plan for delivering services that meet those \nneeds. West Virginia routinely fails to timely assess children entering the foster care system. The \nstate also fails to create meaningful and informed service plans. \n309.  The 2017 federal audit found that West Virginia has a poorly functioning case \nreview system, in part, because of the state’s failure to engage in effective assessments and case \nplanning.  \n \n75 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 76 of 105 PageID #: 76\n310.  The 2017 audit revealed that DHHR was “not consistently completing quality \ncomprehensive assessments of the needs of children and parents.” The completion of ongoing \nassessments was an  especially challenging area—both for in-home and foster care cases.  \n311.  Moreover, the same federal  audit found that “appropriate services are not \nconsistently provided to address the identified needs.” \n312.  Federal auditors reported that DHHR failed to consistently address the needs of \nfoster parents and provide appropriate services. This, in turn, could adversely affect a child’s \nplacement stability. \n313.  The audit also determined that West Virginia failed to ensure quality caseworker \nvisits with children and parents in order to complete comprehensive assessments. Indeed, DHHR \nengaged in insufficient contact with families to achieve case goals. Moreover, “[v]isits often \noccurred during a court hearing or multi-disciplinary team meeting, which may not facilitate \nquality engagement with parents. It was also found that children and parents are not consistently \ninvolved in the case planning process. In a number of cases reviewed, a case plan had not been \ndeveloped.” \n314.  MDTs, discussed supra  ¶ 213, are supposed to include the DHHR caseworker, \nparents or other family (unless rights have been terminated), foster or pre-adoptive parents, \nattorneys for any attendees, the prosecuting attorney, the child’s guardian ad litem, members of \nthe child advocacy center involved in the case, other professionals who may assist in providing \nrecommendations for the child’s best interests, and possibly the child if he or she is old enough. \nBut, upon information and belief, in West Virginia integral participants are either not included or \nparties, such as the attorneys or caseworkers, are unprepared and lack necessary information to \nhold a productive meeting.  \n \n76 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 77 of 105 PageID #: 77\n315.  This is significant, because, during MDTs, the group is supposed to assess the \nchild’s  safety,  wellbeing,  and  permanency.  MDT  members  monitor  the  progress  of  adult \nrespondents as well and ensure they are on track to successfully satisfy the terms of their \nimprovement period if reunification is the permanency plan.  \n316.  What is more, caseworker visits with parents, essential parties in the case \nplanning  process,  are  regularly  held  in  public  forums  rather  than  in  private  settings  more \nappropriate for these often sensitive and personal conversations. \n317.  West Virginia’s failure to appropriately plan for the children in its custody \nsubstantially departs from widely accepted professional standards and demonstrates a deliberate \nindifference to the risk of harm to the Plaintiffs and the classes they represent. \n \nVIII.  DHHR Routinely Fails to Obtain Timely Mental Health Assessments and \nServices and Fails to Ensure that There is an Adequate Array of Mental Health \nServices Available to Foster Children \n \n318.  Defendants are well aware that West Virginia’s child welfare system lacks a \nsufficient array of mental and behavioral health services and professionals needed to administer  \nthose services.  \n319.  In the 2017 federal audit, “[s]takeholders consistently reported that the two areas \nof greatest need for which services and resources are lacking are substance abuse treatment and \nthe availability of foster homes. Other necessary services for children and families that were also \nnoted as lacking included mental health services for children, sex offender treatment, batterer \noffender  treatment,  autism  support  services,  postadoption  services,  kinship  family  support \nservices, and housing.” \n320.  Although federal law requires that services must be provided, children often remain \n \n77 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 78 of 105 PageID #: 78\non waiting lists for services; accurate and necessary information about children’s circumstances, \nboth medical and social history, as well as special needs requirements are withheld from foster \nparents; and biological parents are referred to services that exist in such small numbers that they \nnever become available within the limited timeframe the parents have to comply with their case \nplans. \n321.  The  need  for  timely  and  appropriate  therapeutic  interventions  cannot  be \noverstated given the prevalence of mental health conditions in the foster care population, such as \nreactive attachment disorder, adjustment disorder, bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity \ndisorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. \n322.  In 2012 the Bureau of Business and Economic Research College of Business \nand  Economics  at  West  Virginia  University  provided  a  report  to  the  West  Virginia  State \nLegislature  entitled  Identifying  and  Meeting  Children’s  Behavioral  Health  Needs:  Current \nPolicies,  Perspectives,  and  Opportunities.  The  report  concluded,  inter  alia,  that  timely \nidentification and effective treatment to meet mental and behavioral needs of foster children was \ncritical and issued a series of recommendations, including the implementation of a state-wide \ntreatment-focused foster care model, development of a state-wide plan to meet the behavioral \nneeds of West Virginia children and families, allocation of resources to prevention and early \nintervention services, and reduction of barriers to accessing necessary services in the communities. \nUpon information and belief, Defendants failed to implement these recommendations.   \n323.  The  Department of Justice conducted a subsequent investigation in 2015, \ndiscussed further, infra Part XI, A, and found that intensive mental health services were offered \nalmost exclusively in institutional settings rather than in the community. Children tended to remain \nin residential placements for longer than necessary because there were not community-based \n \n78 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 79 of 105 PageID #: 79\nservices to support their return to home.  \n324.  The 2017 CFSR indicated that the lack of available and accessible quality \nservices statewide precluded the individualization of services for children. Individualized services \nare critical to support the unique needs of each child.  \n325.  In January 2019, Deputy Secretary Samples testified before the Senate Finance \nCommittee that West Virginia lacked the basic mental and behavioral health infrastructure to \nprovide treatment to foster children, including basic services such as counseling for girls who \nsuffered through sexual abuse, even though 39 percent of foster children had a mental health \ndiagnosis in the last year.  \n326.  Moreover, West Virginia lacks adequate community-based support services that \nwould enable children to be placed in community-based, family-like settings appropriate to the \nemotional and behavioral needs of West Virginian youth. The required number of therapeutic \nfamily foster homes, with foster parents who have adequate experience and training in dealing \nwith emotional and behavioral needs, simply does not exist. This is especially relevant to members \nof the ADA Subclass. \n327.  All of these failures have been well known to Defendants, and all of them \nconstitute  a  significant  departure  from  reasonable  professional  standards  and  deliberate \nindifference to the substantial harm and risk of harm to the Plaintiffs and the classes they represent.  \nIX.  DHHR Has Inadequate Permanency Planning for Youth in Foster Care \n   \n328.  Defendants fail to engage in necessary permanency planning for children in \nfoster care. As a result, children are forced to languish in the foster care system for years. \n329.  For instance, Theo S. and Ace L. were freed for adoption nearly three years ago \nyet  have  not  achieved  permanency.  DHHR  has  also  left  Gretchen  C.  in  foster  care  for \n \n79 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 80 of 105 PageID #: 80\napproximately four-and-a-half years and Garrett M. in foster care for seven years.  \n330.  Defendants’ failure to ensure children in foster care receive appropriate case \nplans and services and habit of shuffling children from placement to placement or segregating \nthem in institutions add up to an overwhelming failure to ensure children achieve permanency. \n331.  Upon information and belief, West Virginia’s failure to provide necessary \nservices to children and parents substantially impedes reunification efforts because reunification \noften is not possible, legally and practically, in the absence of such services. In the alternative, \nchildren often are returned to the care of their parents even though the conditions underlying the \nremoval of the children have not been addressed. \n332.  Research has shown that the longer a child remains in care the less likely they \nare to be adopted.  Similarly, children who have previously been placed in congregate care often \nfail to receive adoption services. Defendants routinely create permanency plans that do not even \ninclude adoption as a goal for foster children who need specialized mental health or medical \nservices, even when adoption might be a reasonable concurrent plan. This happens with even \ngreater frequency to those foster children with physical, emotional, or cognitive disabilities.   \n333.  Only a small fraction of those foster children who are freed for adoption are \ncurrently listed on West Virginia’s adoption page which helps DHHR find adoptive homes for \nchildren.  As of August 2019, only 49 children are listed for adoption, 23 of whom were added \nbetween 2011 and 2017. \n334.  For older teens who may express the view that they do not want to be adopted, \nDHHR often fails to explore non-adoptive options that nevertheless would be conducive to the \nchild’s long-term stability, such as facilitating the child’s connection with a non-adoptive kinship \nresource who will maintain a stable, long-term relationship with the child after they age out of the \n \n80 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 81 of 105 PageID #: 81\nsystem.    \n335.  Upon information and belief, West Virginia is quick to terminate parental rights, \nfrequently within months of the initial placement.  This has resulted in an almost doubling of the \nsize of the population whose parents’ rights have been terminated, from 1,040 in 2013 to 1,988 in \n2017.    \n336.  Adoption numbers have not kept pace with the number of terminations, leading \nto more children becoming legal orphans, frequently left in institutional settings. According to the \nAdoption and Foster Care and Analysis Reporting System, which collects case-level information \nfrom states on children in foster care, data that runs through 2017, West Virginia terminates \nparental rights in 25.8 percent of cases of children waiting for adoption, compared to a national \naverage of 14.75 percent. West Virginia is the sixth worst state under this metric.  Although not \ninclusive of children with emancipation as their permanency goal, termination of parental rights \npetitions are utilized in 9.35 percent of the cases, more than double the national average of 4.4 \npercent. It also ranks sixth highest in this category overall. \n337.  Even  those  children  who  have  been  adopted  in  West  Virginia  have  not \nnecessarily received true permanency. As of March 2018, 14 percent of West Virginian children \nthat were placed in out-of-state institutions had been previously adopted.   \n338.  This number suggests that while DHHR may technically guide the children to \npermanency through to adoption, little to no consideration may be given to whether or not the \nadoptive placement is a good match for the children, later resulting in adopted children returning \nto placement. This is particularly true when assessments as to the appropriateness of adoptive \nplacements and the future needs of the child and adoptive parents are made by inexperienced and \noverworked caseworkers.  \n \n81 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 82 of 105 PageID #: 82\n339.  These  failures  have  been  well  known  to  the  Defendants  and  constitute  a \nsignificant departure from reasonable professional standards and deliberate indifference to the \nsubstantial harm and risk of harm to the Plaintiffs and the classes they represent. \nX.  Defendants Fail to Engage in Transition Planning and Thoughtful Discharge \nfrom Foster Care \n \n340.  Adolescents in the West Virginia foster care system are not prepared for \nsuccessful transitions to adulthood and, as a result, are aging out into either unstable situations or \ndirectly into homelessness. In addition to homelessness, youth aging out of foster care experience \nhigh rates of incarceration, unemployment, early parenthood, and earnings below the poverty line. \nOnce they age out, these victims of the child welfare system lack education, life skills, and \nsupportive adult relationships to help them overcome these debilitating barriers. Even high-\nfunctioning aging-out youth find themselves having to make difficult decisions such as choosing \nbetween  attending  school  or  working  to  pay  their  rent,  thus  limiting  their  opportunities. \nEconomically impaired and alone, aging-out youth are also frequently the targets of predatory \ncrime recruitment involving prostitution and drugs. \n341.  As a critical part of their responsibility to develop youth into self-sufficient \nadults, DHHR caseworkers are required by federal law to provide age appropriate case planning \nto youth who are age 14 or older by assessing each youth for eventual independence, developing \na detailed learning and transition plan, ensuring the youth are exposed to positive adult role models, \nand providing necessary services to assist youth in achieving independence. Such preparations \nshould include vocational and other educational services such as money management, household \nmaintenance, transportation, legal issues, health, community resources, housing options, personal \nhygiene, employment readiness, and educational assistance. But DHHR fails to engage in such \ncase planning for older youth.  \n \n82 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 83 of 105 PageID #: 83\n342.  DHHR fails to prepare youth who are aging out of the child welfare system for \nadulthood and life on their own. Upon information and belief, caseworkers do not engage in timely \ntransitional planning with youth. Rather, caseworkers attempt to plan for the transition out of foster \ncare when youth are on the verge of aging out, sometimes as late as weeks before a teen’s 18th \nbirthday. Without any plan in place, young people are being dropped off at homeless shelters.  \n343.  For instance, Garrett M. is 17 years old, but DCS has not prepared him for his \ntransition out of foster care. DHHR merely enrolled him in an educational “click-through” \nprogram. DHHR has failed to provide him with any vocational training.  \n344.  In the 2017 federal audit, it was determined that West Virginia did not make \nconcerted efforts to place youth with a goal of Another Planned Permanent Living Arrangement \nin a viable permanent arrangement.  \n345.  Historically, West Virginia has claimed that 73 percent of all the youth who \nwere in care on their 18th birthday achieved permanency—primarily through reunification with \nparent/primary caretaker. Although reunification is the preferred permanency option for children \nunder the age of 18, 18-year-olds who are discharged from foster care to a parent that they may \nnot have had contact with in years and/or could not be reunited with while they were a minor is \nnot reunification. This is an improper classification of youth who were abandoned by West \nVirginia.  \n346.  This is a particularly critical demographic for West Virginia because, as of \n2017, the state had the highest rate in the country of foster care entries for youth ages 14 to 17 per \n1,000 at 14.2, as compared to the national average of 2.8 per 1,000. \n347.  In West Virginia 71 percent of foster children between the ages of 12 and 17 \nare institutionalized. The most recent placement before exiting foster care for the majority of these \n \n83 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 84 of 105 PageID #: 84\nyouth is a group home or institution. They are never given the opportunity to develop consistent \nand nurturing relationships with adults who will support them beyond their adolescence and \nthrough their transition to adulthood; aging-out youth lack a “safety net” as they begin to navigate \nlife on their own.   \n348.  Outside of education, other relevant outcomes for youth who will age out of the \nfoster care system are devastating. National data shows that over 20 percent will become homeless \nshortly after aging out or will age out directly into homelessness; 71 percent of women will be \npregnant by 21; 50 percent of the youth will remain unemployed by the age of 24; less than three \npercent will have completed college; and 25 percent will suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. \n349.  A longitudinal study following youth who have aged out released in 2015 found \nthat of West Virginia youth who spent time in foster care, by age 19, 18 percent experienced \nhomelessness in the previous two years and, by age 21, 28  percent experienced homelessness.  At \nage 19, only 33 percent had a full or part-time job and by age 21, only 43 percent were employed. \n350.  DHHR’s failure to develop and implement meaningful case and transitional \nplanning for youth who are aging out of foster care substantially departs from widely accepted \nprofessional standards and demonstrates a deliberate indifference to the risk of harm to the \nPlaintiffs and the classes they represent.  \nXI.  Defendants’ Failure to Keep Foster Children Safe has Resulted in Action by \nFederal Regulators and the State Legislature \n \nA.  The United States Department of Justice has Found West Virginia in \nViolation of the ADA with Regard to how the State Cares for Children \nin Need of Mental Health Services \n \n351.  In April 2014, the Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of \nJustice (“USDOJ”), launched an investigation into West Virginia’s system of care for children in \nneed of mental health services. Upon completion of the year-long investigation, the USDOJ found \n \n84 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 85 of 105 PageID #: 85\nthat West Virginia was causing psychological, developmental, and other harm to children by \nunnecessarily placing them into segregated residential treatment facilities instead of providing the \nfederally-required in-home and community-based services. The USDOJ declared the State to be \nin violation of Title II of the ADA due to their failure to provide services to children with \nsignificant mental health conditions in the most integrated settings appropriate to their needs.  \n352.  The scope of the investigation included the mental health services available to \nchildren in the child welfare system, the juvenile justice system, or who were Medicaid dependent. \nIn their findings report dated June 1, 2015, the USDOJ concluded that the entire children’s mental \nhealth system was built around placement in segregated residential treatment facilities such that, \nfor children with serious mental  health conditions, the “default service in  West Virginia is \ninstitutionalization.” Letter from Dep’t of Justice, Civil Rights Div., to Office of the Governor, \nState of West Virginia (June 1, 2015) (emphasis added). This included group residential care, \npsychiatric residential treatment facilities, and psychiatric hospitals. Such care facilities provided \nstructured  24-hour  group  care,  highly-regimented  programs  with  invasive  therapeutic \ninterventions  including  seclusion,  and  physical  and  chemical  restraint  of  children  by  staff \nmembers.  \n353.  The USDOJ stated that West Virginia “needlessly segregated thousands of \nchildren far from family and other people important in their lives” even though they could \nsuccessfully treat these children in their homes and communities. Id. (emphasis added). The report \nspecified that West Virginia failed to establish even the most basic service provisions that were \nconsidered the “standard of care” for children with mental health needs; they failed to develop \ncommunity-based wraparound supports and in-home crisis response services, they did not take full \nadvantage of Medicaid support for such services, and they failed to reallocate existing resources \n \n85 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 86 of 105 PageID #: 86\neffectively.  \n354.  Ten years prior to the issuance of the DOJ findings report, Defendants released \na  strategic  plan  to  build-out  community-based  services  in  order  to  prevent  the  harms  of \ninstitutionalization, but it was never implemented. Instead, in the years leading up to the USDOJ \ninvestigation, DHHR licensed new in-state facilities, increased bed capacity at existing facilities, \nand increased the number of children they sent out of state to private, for-profit, residential care \nfacilities. Currently, there are approximately 50 residential treatment facilities across the state of \nWest Virginia into which foster children are regularly placed. These consist of Level I, II, and III \nfacilities  and  psychiatric  treatment  centers.  Generally,  the  specific  program  levels  reflect \ndifferences in level of care, therapeutic approaches, and security. Additionally, there are 53 out-\nof-state facilities that have a contract to receive placements from DHHR, as of April 30, 2019.  \n355.  Studies show that segregated residential treatment facilities cause psychological \nand emotional harm to children. Children that have spent time in a facility may become socially \nwithdrawn, develop attention-seeking behaviors including self-harming, have difficulty learning \nand concentrating, and lose the ability to form emotional attachments with caregivers and peers. \nChildren may lose the ability to make ordinary life decisions because facilities control all daily \nactivities.  Due to the high turnover of residential staff and therapists, and poor contact with other \nadult  caregivers,  children  are  deprived  of  opportunities  to  establish  stable  and  continuous \nrelationships.  Such  relationships  are  critical  to  a  child’s  development  and  success  in  their \ntreatment, especially for the children in care who have experienced trauma. Further, residential \ntreatment facilities are associated with higher rates of maltreatment, exposing the residents to new \nand additional trauma.  \n356.  The USDOJ’s investigation revealed that West Virginia’s children in segregated \n \n86 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 87 of 105 PageID #: 87\nresidential treatment facilities were required to complete “arbitrary” behavioral goals that did not \nrelate to their individual treatment needs or provide the children with the life or social skills \nnecessary to establish relationships or navigate everyday social encounters. They described the \nprograms as restrictive and rigid, stating that “these goals can be very difficult to achieve due to \nthe combined effect of their disabilities.” Id. (emphasis added). The behavioral goals, which \nrefused to yield to a specific child’s limitations, slowed their transition back to community living \nand placement with their families, thereby maintaining them in a restrictive and isolated setting \nfor reasons that had nothing to do with their treatment needs.   \n357.  Segregated residential treatment facilities are expensive and impede the state’s \nability to develop community-based mental health services, thereby perpetuating the resulting \nharms to the children dependent upon state-provided mental health care. The USDOJ’s report \nestimated that the average cost of in-state placement in segregated residential treatment facilities \nranged from $5,623 to $9,088 per month per child. DHHR spent over $67.5 million dollars on \nresidential care in fiscal year 2012 and the number of children entering custody has significantly \nincreased since 2012. \n358.  In May 2019, West Virginia and the USDOJ entered into a Memorandum of \nUnderstanding  (“MOU”).  The  MOU  is  limited  in  scope  and  unlikely  to  be  successfully \nimplemented by DHHR. Specifically, it covers only children under the age of 21 who have a \nserious emotional or behavioral disorder or disturbance that results in a functional impairment, and \n(i) who are placed in a residential mental health treatment facility or (ii) who reasonably may be \nexpected to be placed therein and have their mental health services provided or paid for by DHHR.  \nThe MOU fails to capture the pressing needs of a significant portion of foster children who do not \nfit into these tightly defined parameters yet are in need of mental health services. \n \n87 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 88 of 105 PageID #: 88\n359.  For  children  with  serious  mental  health  conditions,  DHHR  is  required  to \nimplement in-home and community-based mental health services and to limit the use of segregated \nresidential treatment facilities to children for whom residential placement qualifies as the most \nappropriate setting given their individualized service plan; provisions that were already legally \nrequired. Under the MOU, a Subject Matter Expert, chosen by DHHR, will periodically monitor \nthe state’s compliance.  \n360.  As specified in the agreement, the goal is that by 2024, 10 years after the \ncommencement of the initial DOJ investigation, every child in residential care will be in their most \nappropriate setting and West Virginia will offer mental health services to the defined target \npopulation in the most integrated setting possible.  \n361.  But the goals in the agreement modestly call for a 25 percent reduction of the \nJune 2015 number of children in out-of-state placement by 2022. An even more glaring flaw in \nthe agreement is that it does not explicitly require West Virginia to reduce the number of children \nplaced into in-state residential treatment facilities, which threatens their developmental progress \nand overall wellbeing just as much as placement in an out-of-state facility. Lastly, the MOU is \nself-enforcing and there is little to no oversight.   \nB.  The West Virginia Legislature Recently Enacted a Bill to Improve One \nAspect of the Foster Care System, but it Fails to Address the Major \nComponents of the System that are Dysfunctional and Cause Harm to \nPlaintiffs \n \n362.  The foster care system in West Virginia had become so dysfunctional that the \nstate legislatures have begun to demand action. Under scrutiny, representatives from DHHR made \npublic statements blaming their failures entirely on the drug crisis. Such statements grossly \nmisrepresent DHHR’s performance history and the state of the department leading up to the crisis. \nWest Virginia’s foster care system was already strained and mismanaged prior to the opioid \n \n88 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 89 of 105 PageID #: 89\nepidemic. The drug epidemic was not the root of the problem but rather toppled an already \nfractured system. The public statements display a lack of accountability but nonetheless, clearly \nacknowledge that the system is in fact in crisis.  \n363.  In March 2019, the Defendant Governor Jim Justice signed into law House Bill \n2010, widely referred to as the “Foster Care Reform Bill.” Despite what the encompassing name \nindicates, this bill does not provide the kind of reform that the foster children of West Virginia, \nand the Plaintiffs in this lawsuit, desperately need.   \n364.  The  primary  purpose  of  the  bill  is  to  convert  the  existing  fee-for-service \nMedicaid-based system  of reimbursement to  a  private for-profit managed care organization \n(“MCO”). Transition to a single MCO is to be completed by January 1, 2020.  The chosen MCO \nwill oversee medical health services, pharmacy services, dental care, behavioral health services, \nwraparound services, residential-care services, and socially necessary services for West Virginia’s \nvulnerable youth populations.   \n365.  This provision was met with strong opposition by organized foster family \ngroups, child welfare advocates, and other stakeholders as it made its way through the legislature. \nTheir chief concern was that medically vulnerable groups, such as foster children who often have \nmultiple diagnoses due to a history of trauma, are notoriously underserved by private managed \ncare systems with profit motives.  Further, the MCO will cost the state $200 million per year; \nmoney which could have been spent to improve the existing system.  \n366.  Despite the opposition, Defendant Jeremiah Samples justified the legislation by \nstating, “. . . doing anything is better than doing nothing.”  Yet, Defendants are doing little more \nthan nothing to effectively address the most pressing shortcomings which contribute to the current \nfoster care crisis, and render Defendants unable to safely care for their growing foster care \n \n89 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 90 of 105 PageID #: 90\npopulation.  \n367.  West Virginia’s foster care system is in desperate need of thoughtful well-\ncrafted reform  to  address  the many long-standing systemic deficiencies including:  a severe \nshortage of foster care homes, which results in children sleeping in DHHR offices, staying in \nemergency  shelter  care  for  extended  periods  of  time,  living  in  delinquency  facilities,  and \nexperiencing multiple placement disruptions due to inappropriate or overcrowded placements; \nkinship homes that are not properly vetted or supported, such that children are placed into homes \nthat put them at risk of maltreatment or cannot provide for their wellbeing; an over-reliance on \nsegregated residential care facilities, such that children are needlessly institutionalized or sent out \nof state; a lack of uniformity in DHHR policy and practice across the state; egregiously high \ncaseworker  caseloads  and  high  caseworker  turnover  that  renders  proper  case  management \nimpossible; a lack of service providers and other critical infrastructure that would allow children \nwith mental health service needs to remain in their communities; a failure to ensure children \nachieve timely or lasting permanency or have their in-placement needs met; and a failure to \nproperly prepare older youth for aging out, and therefore placing them at risk of experiencing \nhomelessness, drug addiction, or recruitment into crime. The Foster Care Reform Bill addresses \nnone of these issues.  \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nSubstantive Due Process under the U.S. Constitution \n(On Behalf of the General Class and All Subclasses Against All Defendants) \n \n368.  Each of the foregoing allegations is incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n369.  A state assumes an affirmative duty under the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution to provide reasonable care, to and to protect from harm, a child with \nwhom it has formed a special relationship, such as a child in foster care.   \n \n90 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 91 of 105 PageID #: 91\n370.  The foregoing actions and omissions of Defendants constitute a policy, pattern, \npractice, and/or custom that is inconsistent with the exercise of accepted professional judgment \nand amounts to deliberate indifference to the constitutionally protected liberty and privacy interests \nof all of the members of the General Class. \n371.  Defendants are well aware of the policies and practices that prevent these class \nmembers from receiving adequate protection from harm after the State has formed a special \nrelationship with them. \n372.  As a result, the named Plaintiffs and all of the members of the General Class and \nsubclasses of children to whom the state owes a special duty, children in foster care, have been, \nand are, at risk of being deprived of substantive due process rights conferred upon them by the \nUnited States Constitution. \n373.  These substantive due process rights include, but are not limited to: \na.  the right to freedom from maltreatment and repeated maltreatment, while \nunder the protective supervision of the State; \nb.  the  right  to  protection  from  unnecessary  intrusions  into  the  child’s \nemotional wellbeing once the State has established a special relationship \nwith that child; \nc.  the right to services necessary to prevent unreasonable risk of harm; \n \nd.  the right to conditions and duration of foster care reasonably related to the \npurpose of government custody; \ne.  the right to treatment and cares consistent with the purpose and assumptions \nof government custody;  \nf.  the right  not  to be maintained in  custody longer than is  necessary to \n \n91 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 92 of 105 PageID #: 92\naccomplish the purpose to be served by taking a child into government \ncustody; and \ng.  the right to services in the least restrictive, most family-like setting. \n374.   Moreover, the named Plaintiffs and all of the members of Kinship, ADA, and \nAging Out Subclasses have been, and are, at risk of being deprived of substantive due process \nrights conferred upon them by the United States Constitution. \na.  With respect  to  the Kinship Subclass of children, the substantive due \nprocess rights include, but are not limited to: \ni.  The  right  to  placement  in  the  least-restrictive  most  family-like \nsetting that is properly assessed to determine whether it is a safe and \nappropriate placement;  \nii.  The right to supportive and case management services to ensure \nplacement stability and ensure the child is free from harm; and \niii.  The right to a plan and corresponding services for a permanent \nhome.  \nb.  With respect to the ADA subclass of children, the substantive due process \nrights include, but are not limited to: \ni.  The right to be free from discrimination by reason of disability;   \nii.  The right to services in the most integrated setting appropriate to the \nperson’s needs; \niii.  The right to be free from unnecessary institutionalization and to be \nplaced in least restrictive setting; and  \niv.   The  right  to  ensure  access  to  an  array  of  community-based \n \n92 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 93 of 105 PageID #: 93\nplacements and  services to  ensure  access  to  the  least  restrictive \nalternative. \nc.  With respect to the Aging Out Subclass of children, the substantive due \nprocess rights include, but are not limited to: \ni.  The right to independent living services to prepare to exit foster care \nsuccessfully including,  but  not  limited to,  vocational  and other \neducational services; money management, household maintenance, \ntransportation, legal issues, health, community resources, housing \noptions, personal hygiene, employment readiness, and educational \nassistance;  \nii.  The right to assistance to find lawful, suitable permanent housing \nthat will not result in homelessness upon exit from foster care; and \niii.  The right to a connection with an adult resource who will maintain \na stable, long-term relationship with the child after he or she ages \nout of the system. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nFirst, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution \n (On Behalf of the General Class and All Subclasses Against All Defendants) \n \n375.  Each of the foregoing allegations is incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n376.  Plaintiffs and the class members they represent are in Defendants’ custody or \nguardianship  and  are  wholly  dependent  on  Defendants  to  provide  for  their  basic  physical, \npsychological,  and emotional needs, and to  protect  them from  physical,  psychological,  and \nemotional harm.  \n377.  Children  frequently  and  foreseeably  suffer  physical,  psychological,  and \n \n93 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 94 of 105 PageID #: 94\nemotional harm in DHHR custody. They suffer harm in part because, in sharp contrast with the \nideal of a stable and permanent home and family, they are continually shuttled between temporary \nand often non-familial custodial arrangements. Professional judgment and standards of conduct \nrequire the Defendants to make reasonable efforts toward placing children in their care in stable, \npermanent homes and families.  \n378.  The foregoing actions and inactions of Defendants constitute a policy, pattern, \npractice, and/or custom that is inconsistent with the exercise of professional judgment and amounts \nto deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of Plaintiffs and the members of the General \nClass and Subclasses.  \n379.  By failing to take all reasonable efforts towards fostering familial association \nand securing a permanent home and family for the named Plaintiffs and the class members they \nrepresent, Defendants have failed to protect them from psychologically and emotionally harmful \ntemporary living arrangements.  \n380.  As a result, the named Plaintiffs and all of the members of the General Class and \nSubclasses have been, and are at risk of being, deprived of the right to familial association and \nreasonable protection from psychological and emotional harm while in Defendants’ custody, in \nviolation of the First Amendment’s right of association, the Ninth Amendment’s reservation of \nrights to the people, and the Fourteenth Amendment’s substantive due process protections. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \nThe Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. § 670 et seq.  \n(On Behalf of the General Class and All Subclasses Against All Defendants) \n \n381.  Each of the foregoing allegations is incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n382.  The foregoing actions and inactions of Defendants constitute a policy, pattern, \npractice, and/or custom of depriving the named Plaintiffs and the classes they represent of the \n \n94 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 95 of 105 PageID #: 95\nrights contained in the Child Welfare Act of 1980, as amended by the Adoption and Safe Families \nAct of 1997, to: \na.  a written case plan that includes a plan to provide safe, appropriate \nand stable placements, 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(A); \nb.  placement  in  a  foster  placement  that  conforms  to  nationally \nrecommended professional standards, 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(10); \nc.  a written case plan that ensures that the child receives safe and \nproper care while in foster care and implementation of that plan, \n42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(B); \nd.  a written case plan that ensures provision of services to parents, \nchildren, and foster parents to facilitate reunification, or where that is \nnot possible, the permanent placement of the child and implementation \nof that plan, 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(B);  \ne.  a written case plan that ensures provision of services to parents, \nchildren and foster parents to facilitate reunification, or where that is \nnot possible, the permanent placement of the child and implementation  \nof that plan, 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(B); \nf.  a written case plan that ensures the educational stability of the child \nwhile in foster care and implementation of that plan, 42 U.S.C. §§ \n671(a)(16), 675(1)(G); \ng.  a case review system in which each child has a case plan designed to \nachieve  safe  and  appropriate  foster  care  placements  in  the  least \nrestrictive  and  most  family-like  setting,  closest  to  their  home \n \n95 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 96 of 105 PageID #: 96\ncommunity, 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(5)(A), and; \nh.  a case review system in which the status of the child is reviewed no \nless frequently than every six months by a court, or person responsible \nfor case management, for purposes of determining the safety of the \nchild,  continuing  necessity  and  appropriateness  of  the  placement, \nextent of compliance with their permanency plan and projected date of \npermanency, 41 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(5)(B), 675(5)(C). \n383.  These provisions of the Child Welfare Act of 1980, as amended by the Adoption \nand Safe Families Act of 1997, are clearly intended to benefit Plaintiffs and the classes they \nrepresent; the rights conferred are neither vague nor amorphous sch to strain judicial competence; \nand the statute imposes a binding obligation on the states, 42 U.S.C. § 1983; see also Henry A. \nWilden, 678 F.3d 991, 1008-09 (9th Cir. 2012).  \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nAmericans with Disabilities Act \n(On Behalf of the ADA Subclass Against All Defendants) \n \n384.  Each of the foregoing allegations is incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n385.  Title  II  of  the  ADA,  as  amended,  42  U.S.C.  §  12132,  and  its  enabling \nregulations, 28 C.F.R. 35.101 et seq., prohibit discrimination against individuals with disabilities. \n386.  Plaintiffs have physical, mental, intellectual, or cognitive disabilities that qualify \nthem as individuals with disabilities within the meaning of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2). They \nmeet the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of foster care services provided by \nDHHR. \n387.  Defendants are public entities, or are public officials of a public entity, subject \nto the provisions of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1)(A). \n \n96 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 97 of 105 PageID #: 97\n388.  Title II of the ADA prohibits a public entity from excluding a person with a \ndisability from participating in, or denying the benefits of, the goods, services, programs and \nactivities of the entity or otherwise discriminating against a person on the basis of disability. \n389.  Under the regulations  enforcing the ADA, the state may not  “[p]rovide a \nqualified individual with a disability with an aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective in \naffording equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same \nlevel of achievement as that provided to others. . . .” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(iii). \n390.  Accordingly,  DHHR  must  provide  children  with  disabilities  an  equal \nopportunity to access foster care services as it provides to children without disabilities in its \ncustody. \n391.  Moreover,  defendants  have  an  affirmative  duty,  to  “make  reasonable \nmodifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the \nmodifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.” 28 C.F.R. \n§ 35.130(b)(7). \n392.  As set forth above, the regulatory hallmark and guiding force of disability law \nrequires  the  provision  of  services,  including  the  child’s  placement  in  the  most  integrated \nenvironment appropriate to the youth’s needs.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 US \n581, 602 (1999). \n393.  As a result of the foregoing, named Plaintiffs in the ADA Subclass and the \nmembers they represent have, and are at risk of being, deprived of their statutory right to access \nadditional mental health services to make them as able as their non-disabled peers to access a \nstable, family-like foster placement and for appropriate placement in the most integrated setting \n \n97 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 98 of 105 PageID #: 98\nappropriate to their needs. \n394.  As a direct and proximate result of defendants’ violations of Title II of the ADA, \nplaintiffs have been or are at risk of being injured as set forth above and will continue to suffer \ninjury until defendants are required to, and have, come into compliance with the requirements of \nthe ADA. \nFIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nRehabilitation Act \n(On Behalf of the ADA Subclass Against All Defendants) \n \n395.  Each of the foregoing allegations is incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n396.  Plaintiffs have physical, mental, intellectual, or cognitive disabilities that qualify \nthem as individuals with disabilities within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act. See 29 U.S.C. \n§ 794; 29 U.S.C. § 705(20). They meet the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of foster \ncare services provided by DHHR. \n397.  DHHR  receives  substantial  federal  funding  to  support  its  child  welfare \noperations and thus must comply with the Rehabilitation Act. See 29 U.S.C. § 794(b); 34 C.F.R. \n104.51. The individually-named Defendants are all agents for the state of West Virginia sued in \ntheir official capacities. Their respective agencies and offices all receive substantial federal \nfunding.  \n398.  Like the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act and its enabling regulations prohibit \ndiscrimination in the provision of services by any entity receiving federal funding. See 29 U.S.C. \n§ 794(a); 34 C.F.R. 104.4.  \n399.  Like the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act also requires an \"equal opportunity\" for \npeople with disabilities to benefit from the services of a public entity. 34 C.F.R. 104.4(b)(1)(ii) & \n(b)(2); 34 C.F.R. 104.52(a)(2).  \n \n98 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 99 of 105 PageID #: 99\n400.  Like the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act requires federal funds recipient to provide \nservices in the most integrated setting appropriate. See 34 C.F.R. 104.4(b)(2).  \n401.  Defendants, in actions and omissions described above, fail to give children with \ndisabilities an equal opportunity to succeed in remaining in a family home, reunifying with their \nparents, finding a permanent home, receiving necessary health care, and receiving appropriate \nplacement in the most integrated, community-based setting appropriate to their needs. \n402.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants' violations of Rehabilitation Act, \nPlaintiffs have been or are at risk of being injured as set forth above and will continue to suffer \ninjury until Defendants are required to, and have, come into compliance with the requirements of \nthe Rehabilitation Act.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, the named Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and the classes, respectfully \nrequest that this Court: \n403.  Order that this action may be maintained as a class action pursuant to Rule \n23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; \n404.  Pursuant  to  Rule  57  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  declare \nunconstitutional and unlawful: \na.  Defendants’ violation of Plaintiffs’ and class members’ right to be free from harm \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; \nb.  Defendants’ violation of Plaintiffs’ and class members’ rights under the First, \nNinth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; \nc.  Defendants’ violation of Plaintiffs’ and class members’ rights under the Adoption \nAssistance and Child Welfare Action of 1980, as amended by the Adoption and \n \n99 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 100 of 105 PageID #: 100\nSafe Families Act of 1997, 42 U.S.C. § 670 et seq.; and \nd.  Defendants’ violation of Plaintiffs’ and class members’ rights under ADA, 42 \nU.S.C. § 12131(2), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (“Section 504” or “RA”), \n29 U.S.C. § 794, and the respective implementing regulations. \n405.  Permanently enjoin Defendants from subjecting Plaintiff Children to practices that \nviolate their rights, including: \na.  With regard to all children in the General Class: \ni.  Require DHHR to contract with an appropriate outside entity to \ncomplete a needs assessment of the state’s provision of foster care \nplacement and services no later than six months after judgement, to \ndetermine the full range and number of appropriate foster care \nplacements  and  services  for  all  children  needing  foster  care \nplacement, including the development of a plan, with timetables, \nwithin which such placements and services shall be secured, and \nensure that DHHR shall comply with those timetables;  \nii.  Require that DHHR ensure that all children who enter foster care \nplacement receive within 30 days of entering care a complete and \nthorough evaluation of the child’s needs, performed by a qualified \nindividual, including whether the child has any physical and/or \nmental  disabilities  sufficient  to  be  categorized  as  a  child  with \ndisabilities under the ADA and that the child be re-evaluated as the \nchild’s needs and the information available to DHHR change;   \niii.  Require that DHHR ensure that all children who enter foster care \n \n100 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 101 of 105 PageID #: 101\nplacement receive within 60 days of entering care an adequate and \nindividualized written case plan for treatment, services, and supports \nto  address  the  child’s  identified  needs;  describe  a  plan  for \nreunification with the child’s parents, for adoption, or for another \npermanent, family-like setting; describing any interim placements \nappropriate for the child while the child moves towards a permanent \nhome-like setting; and describing the steps needed to keep the child \nsafe during the child’s time in DHHR’s custody.  \niv.  Require  that  DHHR  ensure  that  all  children  whose  case  plan \nidentifies a need for services and/or treatment timely receive those \nservices and/or treatment; \nv.  Require that DHHR shall ensure that all children who are placed in \nfoster care are placed in a safe home or facility and are adequately \nmonitored in accordance with federal standards; \nvi.  Require that DHHR shall hire, employ, and retain an adequate \nnumber of qualified and appropriately trained caseworkers, and \nensure that caseloads do not exceed 15 children per-worker for \nchildren in placement, with caseloads adjusted for caseworkers who \ncarry mixed caseloads including children not in foster care custody; \nand \nvii.  Require  DHHR  to  develop  an  adequate  statewide  plan,  to  be \napproved  by  the  Monitor  referred  to  below,  for  recruiting  and \nretaining foster and adoptive homes, including recruitment goals \n \n101 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 102 of 105 PageID #: 102\nand timetables for achieving those goals, with which DHHR shall \ncomply. \nb.  For all children in the Kinship Subclass: \ni.  Require DHHR to develop an adequate statewide kinship placement \nplan, to be approved by the Monitor referred to below, for assessing, \noverseeing,  and  monitoring  kinship  homes,  including  training \nrequirements and regular caseworker contact, and timetables for \nachieving those goals, with which DHHR shall comply; \nii.  Require that DHHR shall ensure caseworkers conduct background \nand  safety  assessments  of  kinship  placements  as  required  by \nreasonable professional standards; \niii.  Require that DHHR shall ensure that kinship placements receive \nfoster  parent  training  as  required  by  reasonable  professional \nstandards; \niv.  Require  that  DHHR  shall  ensure  that  all  children  in  kinship \nplacements shall receive foster care services to meet the child’s \nneeds, including, in as many instances as is required by reasonable \nprofessional standards, supportive services; and \nv.  Require that DHHR shall ensure all children who are placed in \nkinship  placement receive permanency planning  as required by \nreasonable professional standards. \nc.  For all children in the ADA Subclass: \ni.  Require that DHHR shall ensure that all children with physical, \n \n102 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00710   Document 1   Filed 09/30/19   Page 103 of 105 PageID #: 103\nmental, intellectual, or cognitive disabilities shall receive foster care \nservices in the most integrated setting appropriate to the child’s \nneeds, including, in as many instances as is required by reasonable \nprofessional  standards,  family  foster  homes  with  supportive \nservices; \nii.  Require that DHHR ensure that an adequate array of community-\nbased therapeutic services are available to children with disabilities; \nand \niii.  Require that DHHR ensure that it develop an adequate array of \ncommunity-based  therapeutic  foster  homes  and  therapeutic \nplacements to meet the needs of children with disabilities. \nd.  For all children in the Aging Out Subclass: \ni.
