These individuals sought to represent all persons who had in the past participated, presently were participating, or may have in the future participated in, or been present at, demonstrations and crowd events within the city of Oakland in exercise of their rights of free speech, assembly, association, petition, and of the press (\"the plaintiffs\").</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs sued the city of Oakland, the Interim Chief of Police of the OPD, the Deputy Chief of Police of the OPD, Alameda County, and the Sheriff and Coroner of Alameda County (\"the defendants\") alleging that the defendants violated the plaintiffs' rights under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution; California state law; and the Declaratory Judgment Act. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants retaliated against the plaintiffs' exercise of their right to peaceably assemble and protest, used excessive force against protestors, wrongfully arrested and imprisoned protestors, targeted people of color who were protesting anti-Black racist police violence, and conspired to violate the plaintiffs' constitutional rights. Additionally, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants committed assault and battery, failed to intervene, and engaged in negligence.</p>\r\n<p>In their complaint, the plaintiffs asked the court for injunctive, declaratory, and monetary relief. The plaintiffs requested that the court enjoin the defendants from using chemical weapons, explosive grenades, and impact munitions in crowds, and that the court require the defendants to seal and destroy records derived from the arrests of the named plaintiffs. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on August 24, 2021.</p>\r\n<p>Chief Judge Richard Seeborg granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion to dismiss on October 1, 2021.

INTRODUCTION \nS d nr\nee 17  Plaintiffs were injured by police while protesting police brutality last summer. They sued \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  the unknown law enforcement officers who injured them, the Oakland Police Department and \n19  some of its leaders, and Alameda County and its Sheriff, Gregory Ahern. Alameda County and \n20  Sheriff Ahern move to dismiss. They argue Plaintiffs cannot show they will likely be injured \n21  again, or that the County can be held liable for its deputiesโ actions in this case. Neither of \n22  Defendantsโ arguments supply sufficient grounds to dismiss Plaintiffsโ core claims. Plaintiffs \n23  adequately plead that Defendantsโ failure to train, for example, may give rise to liability. However, \n24  Defendants are correct that Plaintiffs have not averred enough facts for their conspiracy claim. \n25  Similarly, the Complaint contains no facts to explain how Defendants could have discriminated \n26  against Plaintiffs based on religion or national origin. For the reasons further set out below, \n27  Defendantsโ motion is denied, except that it is granted as to the conspiracy count and part of the \n28  Ralph Act count. \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-RS   Document 40   Filed 10/01/21   Page 2 of 12\n \n1  II. BACKGROUND1 \n2  On May 29, 2020, several thousand protestors took to the streets of Oakland to \n3  demonstrate against police brutality and in support of Black Lives Matter. They were spurred to \n4  protest by the police officer killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis earlier that week. The \n5  protestors contend they faced the very same excessive force against which they were protesting. \n6  The Oakland Police Department had called in the Alameda Countyโs Sheriffโs Office as a mutual \n7  aid partner. Officers from both agencies formed a line across Broadway. Without giving the crowd \n8  a chance to disperse, they began firing impact munitions, explosive grenades, and chemical agents \n9  into the crowd. (Impact munitions are projectiles intended to be non-lethal, e.g., bean bag rounds, \n10  although they can cause serious injury and even death.) Plaintiff Jasmine Gaffett was near the \n11  front of the crowd when she was shot twice in the leg with impact munitions. Ms. Gaffett turned to \n12  run and was shot again with impact munitions, over and overโat least twenty shots hit the back of \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  her body. She was severely injured: the police had broken her finger, she could barely move, and \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  she was in considerable pain. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Three days later, a youth-led march for racial justice took place. At 5:00 PM, Oakland and \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Alameda County declared a curfew would take effect at 8:00 PM. The march had already begun \nS de nre 17  before the curfew was announced. Plaintiff Toshua Sears was at the intersection of 8th and \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Broadway, before 8:00 PM, when law enforcement blocked three sides of the intersection. They \n19  then deployed chemical weapons, explosive grenades, and impact munitions. Mr. Sears did not \n20  hear any warning or order to disperse beforehand. As he tried to leave, he was hit by impact \n21  munitions and tear gas. He suffered pain and impaired vision thereafter. \n22  The same night, Plaintiff Kierra Brown joined the demonstrators at 14th and Broadway, \n23   \n1 The factual background is based on the allegations in the first amended complaint, which must \n24 \nbe taken as true for this motion. United States v. Ritchie, 342 F.3d 903, 908 (9th Cir. 2003). \nDefendants seek judicial notice of facts such as how many Sheriffโs deputies were at the protests \n25 \nrelative to other agencies, and that Sheriff Ahern was the regional mutual aid coordinator. Judicial \nnotice of these facts is inappropriate as they are not generally known, nor can they be determined \n26 \nfrom sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned. Khoja v. Orexigen Therapeutics, \nInc., 899 F.3d 988, 999 (9th Cir. 2018) (citing Fed. R. Evid. 201(b)(1)). In any case, these facts \n27 \nwould not affect the outcome here. \n28  ORDER DENYING IN PART AND GRANTING IN PART MOTION TO DISMISS \nCASE NO.  21-cv-02881-RS \n2 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-RS   Document 40   Filed 10/01/21   Page 3 of 12\n \n1  washing the eyes of teargassed protestors. Officers approached her โaggressivelyโ and she ran \n2  towards 15th Street, believing this was what they wanted. An officer shot her with impact \n3  munitions, then arrested her, also before the curfew had taken effect. Ms. Brown has not regained \n4  full sensation in her leg and is at risk of losing mobility in her foot. No officer tried to intervene in \n5  these uses of force, nor did any officer provide first aid.  \n6  This case does not arise in a vacuum. Oakland P.D. remains under a negotiated settlement \n7  agreement relating to excessive force first entered in 2003. Allen v. City of Oakland, N.D. Cal. No. \n8  3:00-cv-04599. Plaintiffs allege that despite this history, Oakland P.D. and the Alameda Sheriffโs \n9  Office failed to provide adequate training on their policies and constitutional restrictions on use of \n10  force at protests. Oakland P.D. maintains policies on the use of force at protests: impact munitions \n11  may not be used for crowd control or dispersal. In a crowd, they may only be used against \n12  someone who poses an immediate threat of loss of life or serious injury. Even then, impact \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  munitions should be used only when other means of arrest are unsafe and the officer has a clear \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  shot, not when they may hit someone else. Chemical agents and hand thrown pyrotechnic devices \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  may not be used in crowd events without the approval of the Incident Commander, absent exigent \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  circumstances. \nS d nr\nee 17  Plaintiffs allege Sheriff Ahern authorized the use of impact munitions without sufficient \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  justification, resulting in such weapons being used unconstitutionally. None of this should surprise \n19  the leaders of Oakland P.D. and the Sheriffโs Office, Plaintiffs argue. To the contrary, Sheriff \n20  Ahern told Oakland P.D. ahead of time that when providing mutual aid, his deputies would not \n21  comply with Oakland P.D.โs restrictions on the use of chemical agents and impact munitions. He \n22  communicated the same (possibly tacitly) to his deputies. This way, Oakland P.D. allowed the \n23  Sheriffโs deputies to do its โdirty work,โ i.e., attack protestors because Oakland P.D. felt more \n24  constrained. To bolster their claims, Plaintiffs point to past demonstrations in which Sheriffโs \n25  deputies used excessive force, and were supported by Sheriff Ahern. Plaintiffs also contextualize \n26  these events by noting the Alameda Sheriffโs Office ranks third in the nation for wrongful deaths \n27  and excessive force payouts per officer.   \n28  ORDER DENYING IN PART AND GRANTING IN PART MOTION TO DISMISS \nCASE NO.  21-cv-02881-RS \n3 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-RS   Document 40   Filed 10/01/21   Page 4 of 12\n \n1  In this suit, Plaintiffs aver the behavior at the protests at issue violated Oaklandโs own \n2  policies, the federal consent decree entered in Allen, common law duties, statutes, and the state \n3  and federal Constitutions. They seek injunctive relief, in the form of an order prohibiting Oakland \n4  P.D. and the Sheriffโs Office from using certain weapons in crowds, and destroying Ms. Brownโs \n5  arrest records. They also seek declaratory relief and damages. Plaintiffs plan to seek a class action \n6  but have not yet brought a motion for class certification. Plaintiffs amended their complaint in \n7  response to a previous motion to dismiss. \n8  There are 12 counts in total, with two naming only the Oakland Defendants. Alameda \n9  County and Sheriff Ahern bring a motion to dismiss, and curiously include one of the two counts \n10  in which they are not named Defendants, the false arrest and imprisonment count. Def.โs Mot. To \n11  Dismiss at 14:22, Dkt. No. 32. They do not mention count eight, the Bane Act violation. \n12  III. LEGAL STANDARDS \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Rule 12(b)(6) governs motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim. A complaint must \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  contain a short and plain statement of the claim showing the pleader is entitled to relief. Fed. R. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Civ. P. 8(a). While โdetailed factual allegationsโ are not required, a complaint must have sufficient \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  factual allegations to โstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.โ Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 \nS d nr\nee 17  U.S. 662, 678, (2009) (quoting Bell Atlantic v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, (2007)). A Rule \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  12(b)(6) motion tests the legal sufficiency of the claims alleged in the complaint. Parks Sch. of \n19  Bus., Inc. v. Symington, 51 F.3d 1480, 1484 (9th Cir. 1995). Thus, dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) \n20  may be based on either the โlack of a cognizable legal theoryโ or on โthe absence of sufficient \n21  facts allegedโ under a cognizable legal theory. UMG Recordings, Inc. v. Shelter Cap. Partners \n22  LLC, 718 F.3d 1006, 1014 (9th Cir. 2013). When evaluating such a motion, courts generally \n23  โaccept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and construe the pleadings in the light most \n24  favorable to the nonmoving party.โ Knievel v. ESPN, 393 F.3d 1068, 1072 (9th Cir. 2005). \n25  However, โ[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory \n26  statements, do not suffice.โ Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. \n27  A supervisor can be liable for a subordinateโs violations if there is a sufficient causal \n28  ORDER DENYING IN PART AND GRANTING IN PART MOTION TO DISMISS \nCASE NO.  21-cv-02881-RS \n4 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-RS   Document 40   Filed 10/01/21   Page 5 of 12\n \n1  connection between his or her wrongful conduct and the constitutional violations, specifically \n2  through their (a) failure to stop actions they should have known would cause injury, (b) inaction in \n3  training or supervision, or (c) reckless indifference to othersโ rights. Starr v. Baca, 652 F.3d 1202, \n4  1205-08 (9th Cir. 2011). \n5  A local government can be held liable if a plaintiff can establish a policy or custom \n6  attributable to policymakers was the โmoving forceโ behind the constitutional deprivation. Monell \n7  v. Dep't. of Social Services of City of N.Y., 436 U.S. 658, 691โ694 (1978). The Ninth Circuit \n8  recognizes three main theories of Monell liability: (1) an unconstitutional custom or policy behind \n9  the violation; (2) a deliberately indifferent omission, such as a failure to train; and (3) a final \n10  policy-makerโs involvement in, or ratification of, the conduct underlying the violation of rights. \n11  Clouthier v. County of Contra Costa, 591 F.3d 1232, 1249โ1250 (9th Cir. 2010). \n12  IV. DISCUSSION \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  A.  Responsibilities of Mutual Aid Agencies \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Defendants frame an overriding issue: does a mutual aid agency need to abide by the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  requesting agencyโs policies and procedures? Defendants believe the answer is no, or at least that \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  it is unclear, and this dooms Plaintiffsโ case. The answer is indeed not clear. See Anti Police-\nS d nr\nee 17  Terror Project, et al., v. City of Oakland, et al., No. 20-CV-03866-JCS 2020 WL 6381358, at *30 \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  (N.D. Cal. Oct. 31, 2020) (arising from the same protests at issue here). Defendants also raise a \n19  policy argument: the answer must be no, because to hold otherwise would be unworkable and chill \n20  mutual aid by exposing agencies to liability for othersโ policies. Whatever dire consequences \n21  might ensue, Plaintiffs now insist they do not depend on this issueโs resolution. To be fair, \n22  Defendantsโ reading of the Complaint is reasonable. At times, it seems like Plaintiffs are using the \n23  failure to follow Oaklandโs policies as a basis for their Complaint. However, Plaintiffsโ current \n24  position is only intended to explain why the Sheriffโs Office acted unconstitutionally. It is part of \n25  their factual narrative, they insist, not a purported basis for relief. Plaintiffs do not presume \n26  Oaklandโs policies create a private right of action, or that violating them is per se evidence of a \n27  constitutional violation. \n28  ORDER DENYING IN PART AND GRANTING IN PART MOTION TO DISMISS \nCASE NO.  21-cv-02881-RS \n5 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-RS   Document 40   Filed 10/01/21   Page 6 of 12\n \n1  B.  Sherriff Ahernโs Liability \n2  Defendants next argue the claims against Sheriff Ahern should be dismissed because \n3  Plaintiffs fail to show he was personally involved in the alleged violations. Jones v. Williams, 297 \nF.3d 930, 934 (9th Cir. 2002). Plaintiffs respond that all the law requires is a sufficient causal \n4 \nconnection between his wrongful conduct and the constitutional violation. Starr v. Baca, 652 F.3d \n5 \n1202, 1207 (9th Cir. 2011). A supervisor can be liable through their (a) failure to stop actions they \n6 \nshould have known would cause injury, (b) inaction in training or supervision, or (c) reckless \n7 \nindifference to othersโ rights. Id. at 1205โ08. Defendants claim Plaintiffsโ avermentsโthat Sheriff \n8 \nAhern failed to intervene, failed to train adequately, and was deliberately indifferentโdo not \n9 \nmake out a claim for supervisory liability under Starr, but only a claim for municipal liability. \n10 \nThis argument completely misses the mark. Plaintiffsโ claims fit comfortably into the Starr \n11 \nframework.  \n12 \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Plaintiffs convincingly argue that when responding to a large event like the protests at \nCfi\n tclaC 14  issue, with a department-wide response, one can presume the agencyโs head was in control, or at \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  the least ratifying his subordinatesโ actions. (Citing Martinez v. City of Santa Rosa, 499 F. Supp. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  3d 748, 750 (N.D. Cal. 2020).) Defendants argue Martinez is distinguishable because the situation \nS d nr in that case involved the full attention of the police department. It beggars belief to state these \nee 17 \nth\nintr\nUo protests also did not involve the full attention of the police department. These were epochal, \nN 18 \nheadline-dominating protests about police brutality. In Oakland, they caused a state of emergency \n19 \nto be declared, as Defendants emphasize. It is hard to imagine a situation when it would be more \n20 \nimplausible to state it did not have the full attention of the police. Moreover, a claim for failure to \n21 \ntrain or reckless indifference does not depend on the supervisor being in control. Under those \n22 \ntheories, the lack of control itself is the sufficient causal connection between the supervisor and \n23 \nthe violations. \n24 \nPlaintiffs have pled plausibly that Sheriff Ahern was a cause of wrongful conduct. This is \n25 \nparticularly true for the second protest: even if the first protest was a fluke no Sheriff could have \n26 \nprevented, the same behavior repeating itself days later suggests wrongful conduct under any of \n27 \n28  ORDER DENYING IN PART AND GRANTING IN PART MOTION TO DISMISS \nCASE NO.  21-cv-02881-RS \n6 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-RS   Document 40   Filed 10/01/21   Page 7 of 12\n \n1  the Starr categories. 652 F.3d at 1208. \n2  C.  Counts One and Two: Injunctive and Declaratory Relief \n3  Defendants argue Plaintiffs lack standing for injunctive relief because they cannot show \n4  the requisite sufficient likelihood they will be subject to excessive force again. City of Los Angeles \n5  v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 103 (1983). They argue the confluence of contingencies is too remote: there \n6  must be another protest, Plaintiffs must attend, Defendants must use excessive force, Plaintiffs \n7  must be injured. Unfortunately, one need look only to the motion for relating this case to others to \n8  see these cases are all too common. Dkt. No. 7. In their Complaint, Plaintiffs describe a pattern of \n9  excessive force at protests, andโagain, unfortunatelyโthere is a high chance there will be similar \n10  incidents to protest. It is uncertain whether Plaintiffs will be subject to excessive force again. \n11  Indeed, one can only hope they never even have to attend another protest of police brutality. Still, \n12  the likelihood is high enough that Plaintiffs have standing for an injunction, at least at this early \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  point. Lyons is distinguishable: the chance of one person being put in an illegal chokehold is much \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  lower than the chance of Plaintiffs being subject to excessive force at future demonstrations. 461 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  U.S. at 95. Defendants object that Plaintiffs have not protested again; Plaintiffs note they seek \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  injunctive relief precisely because they do not feel safe protesting again without such relief. \nS d nr\nee 17  Defendants move to dismiss the claim for declaratory relief because it would be \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  superfluous of a grant of damages. They add that the declaration Plaintiffs seek is unclear, but \n19  even if it can be determined, it is unnecessary to clarify any legal issues. For their part, Plaintiffs \n20  note the existence of another adequate remedy does not preclude declaratory judgment. Fed. R. \n21  Civ. P. 57. They also frame the clash here as in part over whether Defendantsโ policies and \n22  practices are lawful. Defendantsโ assertion that no legal issues will require clarification through \n23  declaratory judgment seems correct. That said, for now, there is at least some uncertainty on this \n24  point, so declaratory relief cannot be dismissed at this stage.  \n25  D.  Count Six: Conspiracy \n26  Several of Defendantsโ arguments against count six fail, but one succeeds. Count six is \n27  deficient because Plaintiffs have not averred adequate facts from which to infer the requisite \n28  ORDER DENYING IN PART AND GRANTING IN PART MOTION TO DISMISS \nCASE NO.  21-cv-02881-RS \n7 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-RS   Document 40   Filed 10/01/21   Page 8 of 12\n \n1  intent. Defendants argue Plaintiffs merely recite the elements of conspiracy without alleging the \n2  unlawful purpose the conspiracy was for, or any specifics of the supposed conspiracy, e.g., the \n3  time or place or persons involved. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. It is true, as Plaintiffs note, direct \n4  evidence of conspiracy will rarely be available, even after discovery. Conspiracy is generally a \n5  factual issue best left for the jury if it can be inferred, even if from only circumstantial evidence. \n6  Mendocino Envtl. Ctr., 192 F.3d at 1302.  \n7  The issue is Plaintiffs specifically aver only a conspiracy to violate Oakland P.D.โs \n8  policies. As discussed above, they disavow this as the legal basis for their claim. Here, they view \n9  this as evidence that Defendants also had an agreement to violate the Constitution. Even taking \n10  Plaintiffsโ averments as true, that would not be a reasonable inference for a jury to draw. The \n11  Sheriffโs deputies could have ignored Oaklandโs policies and still have followed the law easily. \n12  For example, Oakland requires an Incident Commander to approve the use of chemical agents for \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  crowd control; Sheriffโs deputies could use these agents constitutionally without seeking this \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  approval. It is plausible to infer they were negligent concerning the risk of excessive force; it is \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  implausible to infer they intended to break the law on these threadbare facts. Twombly requires \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  conspiracy allegations to be more specific and more plausible. 550 U.S. at 565, fn. 10. \nS d nr\nee 17  Accordingly, this claim for relief must be dismissed with leave to amend. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  If the conspiracy claim had enough factual support, Defendantsโ other arguments would \n19  not defeat it. Defendants argue it is deficient because conspiracy itself is not a constitutional tort \n20  under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. Plaintiffs must show there was an agreement to violate some \n21  constitutional right, and the violation actually occurred. Mendocino Envtl. Ctr. v. Mendocino \n22  Cnty., 192 F.3d 1283, 1301 (9th Cir. 1999). This point is somewhat confusing. Plaintiffs do not \n23  allege conspiracy alone; they aver conspiracy to commit the other torts in their Complaint. \n24  Alameda County also points to caselaw that it takes to mean it cannot possess the required \n25  state of mind for a conspiracy. E.g., Scott v. Township of Bristol, et al., 1990 WL 178556, *6 (E.D. \n26 \n27 \n28  ORDER DENYING IN PART AND GRANTING IN PART MOTION TO DISMISS \nCASE NO.  21-cv-02881-RS \n8 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-RS   Document 40   Filed 10/01/21   Page 9 of 12\n \n1  Pa. Nov. 14, 1990).2 Plaintiffs distinguish the cases Defendants invoke as holding only that \n2  government entities cannot conspire with their own employees. This is known as the \n3  intracorporate conspiracy doctrineโand Plaintiffs rightly note it is unclear whether it even applies \n4  to ยง 1983 cases. Ziglar v. Abbasi, 137 S.Ct. 1843, 1868 (U.S. 2017). Plaintiffs argue a government \n5  entity is a person which can conspire under ยง 1983. Although they point to no direct authority so \n6  holding, a basic principle from Monell is that municipalities are persons for ยง 1983 purposes. \n7  Defendants also object to Plaintiffsโ claim that Sheriff Ahern โand/orโ his agents \n8  communicated to Oakland P.D. that they would not comply with Oaklandโs policies. In their view, \n9  this vague, โshotgunโ pleading makes it impossible for them to respond. The better reading of \n10  โand/orโ is simply that Sheriff Ahern may have communicated to Oakland P.D. through his \n11  agents, and therefore does not create an unmanageable assertion.3  \n12  E.  Count 7: Failure to Intervene \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Law enforcement officers have a duty to intervene, if possible, when other officers violate \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  constitutional rights, as Defendants acknowledge. Cunningham v. Gates, 229 F.3d 1271, 1289 (9th \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Cir. 2000). Defendants argue Plaintiffs have not adequately described the failure to intervene of \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  any Defendants, even the unknown individual officers. They allege Plaintiffs have only recited the \nS d nr\nee 17  elements. Plaintiffs contend they have clearly pled a failure to intervene: they describe the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  violations happening in plain view of other officers, and note no officer intervened. They argue \n19  this is also proof of the governmentโs failure to train and supervise. Plaintiffs are correct this claim \n20  is adequately pled. Failing to intervene is an omission: only its absence can be shown. How else \n21 \n \n22 \n2 They also rely on Woodrum v. Woodward Cty., 866 F.2d 1121, 1126 (9th Cir. 1989), which does \n23  not discuss this at all. \n3 Defendants also nitpick various supposed flaws in Plaintiffsโ conspiracy claim, e.g., they allege \n24 \nSheriff Ahern has conspired โfor years,โ but the conspiracy here arises out of protests in 2020. The \ntwo are logically consistent with an ongoing conspiracy or a series of conspiracies. Defendants \n25 \nalso argue their purported lies to the media after the protests cannot be evidence of a conspiracy \nbeforehand. This seems obviously incorrect. Actions taken after a conspiracy has achieved its \n26 \ngoals can be evidence of its existence. A coverup is evidence of a crime, albeit weak evidence in \nthis case. Anyway, these quibbles are somewhat frivolous, because they concern disputes over \n27 \nfactual details which would not doom the claim at the pleading stage in any event. \n28  ORDER DENYING IN PART AND GRANTING IN PART MOTION TO DISMISS \nCASE NO.  21-cv-02881-RS \n9 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-RS   Document 40   Filed 10/01/21   Page 10 of 12\n \n1  could Plaintiffs plead no officer intervened? While some proof will eventually be required for this \n2  claim, e.g., videos or affidavits, for now this claim survives.  \n3  F.  Municipal Liability Claims \n4  Defendants argue counts three, four, and at least one other count should be dismissed \n5  because they were not the โmoving forceโ behind the violations.4 Monell, 436 U.S. at 694. These \n6  counts involve violations of the First Amendment, and excessive force. Plaintiffsโ main theory is a \n7  failure to train and supervise. Defendants insist Plaintiffs fail to allege any specifics. They bolster \n8  their argument by noting a municipalityโs culpability is most tenuous when the claim is for failure \n9  to train. Connick v. Thompson, 563 U.S. 51, 61-62 (2011). Under this theory, Defendants must be \n10  deliberately indifferent to the victimsโ rights. City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 389 (1989). \n11  Defendants frame this count as elevating Oaklandโs crowd control policy into a constitutional \n12  standard, as discussed above. \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Plaintiffs argue they have adequately pled all bases of Monell liability, and their complaint \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  makes out a plausible case that Defendants are the moving force behind the constitutional \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  deprivations. Specifically, Sherriff Ahernโs authorization of his deputies to use impact munitions, \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  without sufficient justification, would be enough. Beyond that, the repeated violations by the \nS d nr\nee 17  Sheriffโs Department evidence both a ratification of unconstitutional customs and a failure to train \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  to prevent these customs. In other words, for the second protest in particular, the Alameda \n19  Defendants bear at least some responsibility, not only individual officers. These are adequately \n20  pled to have been the moving force behind the violations.  \n21  G. Count Nine: Ralph Act \n22  Count nine claims a violation of the Ralph Act, California Civil Code ยง 51.7.5 The \n23 \n \n24 \n4 Defendants refer to the third count they discuss in this section as count seven, conspiracy. \n25  Conspiracy is count six, and Plaintiffs discuss count seven, failure to intervene, elsewhere in their \nbrief too. Plaintiffs assert Defendants are liable for count eight under respondeat superior, which \n26  Defendants do not mention in their motion or reply. Plaintiffs share some responsibility for the \nconfusion, as Plaintiffs mistakenly repeat โCount 11โ to label Count 12 in their complaint. \n27  5 Defendants mistakenly refer to this as count 10 instead of count nine. \n28  ORDER DENYING IN PART AND GRANTING IN PART MOTION TO DISMISS \nCASE NO.  21-cv-02881-RS \n10 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-RS   Document 40   Filed 10/01/21   Page 11 of 12\n \n1  elements include that the defendant was motivated by his or her perception of plaintiffโs political \n2  affiliation or protected characteristics. Austin B. v. Escondido Union Sch. Dist., 149 Cal. App. 4th \n3  860, 880โ81 (2007). Plaintiffs contend the officers targeted some in the crowd because of their \n4  race, and some because of their religion; seemingly on the surface inconsistent with officers \n5  targeting them because of their political affiliation or other characteristics. Plaintiffs explain in \n6  response that they were targeted for multiple reasons. There are few facts identified for the \n7  targeting, but the lack of motive for instigating violence makes it a plausible inference, which \n8  must be drawn in favor of Plaintiffs as the non-moving party. On the other hand, Plaintiffs offer no \n9  pleaded facts that any Defendant could have known of any Plaintiffโs national origin or religion. \n10  There are no allegations of visible markers of these characteristics at the protest, or that Plaintiffs \n11  communicated about them to Defendants. Thus, Defendantsโ motion to dismiss is granted as to the \n12  portion of the Ralph Act claim based on religion and national origin, with leave to amend. \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  H. Counts 8 and 10-12: Common Law-Type Claims and Bane Act \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Defendants argue Plaintiffs have not provided a statutory basis for the counts of assault \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  and negligence. Cal. Gov. Code ยง 815; Susman v. City of Los Angeles, 269 Cal. App. 2d 803, 808โ\n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  09 (1969). These counts are at root based on common law. Plaintiffs need not, however, cite state \nS d nr\nee 17  law codifying common law torts and outlining defenses. The key issue is whether they have \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  offered enough facts to make out the claim, which they have. Additionally, Plaintiffs note they \n19  cited Cal. Gov. Code ยง 910, when discussing their compliance with the California Tort Claims \n20  Act. \n21  Defendantsโ attack on two additional counts merit no extended discussion here. Defendants \n22  move to dismiss count 11, the false arrest claim, but it is one of the two counts not asserted against \n23  them. (The other is count five, for wrongful arrest.) Also, Plaintiffs assume Defendants challenge \n24  count eight, the Bane Act claim, on the grounds they have not stated the statutory basis for \n25  liability.

Police have been targeting, brutalizing, and killing Black people since the inception of \n28  law enforcement in the United States, and Oaklandโs police force has shown a demonstrable \n \n \nNo. 3:21-cv-02881-RS Gaffett v.

This action \n2 \narises out of protests across the nation in response to the May 25, 2020, murder of George \n3 \nFloyd by Minneapolis Police Department officers. The events in Minneapolis, soon after the \n4 \ndeaths of Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, brought out millions of people around the \n5 \ncountry to condemn the deaths of Black and Brown people by law enforcement in one of the \n6 \n7  largest social justice movements in the United States history.1 \n8 \n2.  In Oakland, thousands took to the streets on a daily basis starting on May 29, 2020, to \n9 \nmake their viewpoint known that police brutality and institutionalized racism must end. The \n10 \nOakland Police Department (โOPDโ), and its mutual aid partner Alameda County Sheriff \n11 \nOffice (โACSOโ), brutally repressed the Oakland demonstrators, targeting protestors with \n12 \n13  highly dangerous impact munitions (also known as Specialty Impact Munitions โSIMโ, Kinetic \n14 \nImpact Projectiles โKIPโ, or Projectile Impact Weapons โPIWโ), explosive grenades and \n15 \nchemical agents, and wrongful arrests.  \n16 \n3.  This misconduct by OPD and ACSO violated the plaintiffsโ constitutional rights, and \n17 \nthe CITY OF OAKLAND Police Departmentโs own Crowd Control and Crowd Management \n18 \n19  Policy. Said Policy was adopted by the CITY OF OAKLAND and OPD as part of the federal \n20 \ncourt settlement orders in four prior federal lawsuits arising from mass injuries caused by \n21 \nOPDโs and assisting agenciesโ (including ACSOโs) constitutional violations, including \n22 \nmisuse of these weapons and wrongful mass arrests at demonstrations: Coles / Local 10, ILWU \n23 \nv.

This is a civil rights action for damages, injunctive and declaratory relief arising from \n5 \nthe unconstitutional OPD and ACSO violence toward demonstrators on May 29 and June 1, \n6 \n7  2020. \n8 \nII. JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n9 \n5.  This action seeks damages and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.  This Court has \n10 \njurisdiction over the action under 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and 1343. It has supplemental jurisdiction \n11 \nover the state law claims under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367.  \n12 \n13  6.  Venue properly lies within this District under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b). The named \n14 \ndefendants perform their official duties in this District, and the events and omissions giving rise \n15 \nto plaintiffsโ claims occurred in this District.  \n16 \n7.  Plaintiffs JASMINE GAFFETT, KIERRA BROWN and TOSHUA SEARS have filed \n17 \nadministrative claims with the City of Oakland and with Alameda County, in compliance with \n18 \n19  California Government Code ยง 910 et seq. The City of Oakland denied plaintiffsโ claim on \n20 \nFebruary 1, 2021. More than 45 days have elapsed since the claim against Alameda County was \n21 \nsubmitted on October 16, 2020; therefore that claim is deemed denied. \n22 \nIII. INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT \n23 \n8.

FACTS \n16 \n24.  On May 25, 2020, Minneapolis police officers killed George Floyd, a 46-year-old \n17 \nBlack Minneapolis resident. A white police officer knelt on Mr. Floydโs neck for nearly nine \n18 \n19  minutes while three other officers observed. Mr. Floyd died calling out for his mother and \n20 \nbegging for his life as his death was recorded by passersby. The recording was shared on \n21 \nmultiple media platforms for all the world to witness. \n22 \n25.  In the days and weeks following Mr. Floydโs death, people across the country flooded \n23 \ninto streets demanding an end to police brutality against Black people; protesting the deaths of \n24 \n25  Mr. Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and countless others at the hands of police, \n26 \nthrough vigils, demonstrations, and public gatherings. \n27 \n28 \n \n \nNo. 3:21-cv-02881-RS Gaffett v. City of Oakland | 2d AMD CMPLT |   6 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-RS   Document 44   Filed 10/22/21   Page 7 of 46\n \n1  26.  OPD Command Staff, including defendants MANHEIMER, ARMSTRONG, and \n2 \nHOLMGREN, were aware of the potential for large demonstrations to occur in Oakland as the \n3 \nweekend drew near, and eventually that a demonstration had been called for that Friday \n4 \nevening, May 29. They planned for the May 29 demonstration, including by calling in mutual \n5 \naid through the Regional Mutual Aid Coordinator, defendant AHERN and ACSO. \n6 \n7  27.  Also in anticipation of the Oakland protest organized for the evening of May 29, 2020, \n8 \nearlier that day, attorneys of record for plaintiffs in the prior crowd control settlements emailed \n9 \ndefendants MANHEIMER, ARMSTRONG and HOLMGREN, along with Assistant Chief \n10 \nDarren Allison, Mayor Libby Schaaf, and City Attorney Barbara Parker to remind them of the \n11 \nCity of Oaklandโs and the OPDโs legal obligation to comply with the OPD Crowd \n12 \n13  Management and Crowd Control Policy in policing anticipated demonstrations (Exhibit B, \n14 \nMay 29, 2020, Letter).  \n15 \n28.  Specifically, the May 29, 2020 Letter reminded OPD and CITY OF OAKLAND \n16 \nofficials that the federal court settlement agreements and orders in Spalding, et al. v. City of \n17 \nOakland, C11-02867, and Campbell, et al. v. City of Oakland, C11-05498, mandate adherence \n18 \n19  to the Crowd Control Policy, promulgated as OPD Training Bulletin III-G, in all crowd \n20 \nsituations, and require OPD and the City to meet and confer with plaintiffs' counsel before \n21 \nmaking any material change to TB III-G and associated training outlines. (Exhibits A and B.) \n22 \n29.  The May 29, 2020 Letter specifically mentioned that the Policy prohibits certain \n23 \nweapons and types of force in the crowd context and restricts others. Chemical agents and hand \n24 \n25  thrown pyrotechnic devices may not be used in crowd events without the approval of the \n26 \nIncident Commander, absent exigent circumstances. (Exhibit A, ยถ V.H.4, p. 13, and Exhibit B.) \n27 \nHand thrown pyrotechnic devices such as CS Blast grenades may not be thrown directly into a \n28 \n \n \nNo. 3:21-cv-02881-RS Gaffett v. City of Oakland | 2d AMD CMPLT |   7 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-RS   Document 44   Filed 10/22/21   Page 8 of 46\n \n1  crowd. They must be deployed to explode at a safe distance from the crowd to minimize the \n2 \nrisk of serious injury. (Exhibit A, ยถ V.H.5, p. 14, and Exhibit B.) The May 29, 2020 Letter also \n3 \nmentioned that these devices have caused serious burns and permanent hearing loss when used \n4 \nin Oakland crowds. (Exhibit B.) \n5 \n30.   The May 29, 2020 Letter specified that, according to Oaklandโs own policy, โSpecialty \n6 \n7  Impact Less-Lethal Munitions (SIM) such as so called โfoamโ or โspongeโ rounds and bean \n8 \nbags may never be used for crowd control or dispersal. In a crowd situation, the Policy requires \n9 \na different standard for SIM than on patrol. SIM may only be used against a specific individual \n10 \nwho is engaging in conduct that poses an immediate threat of loss of life or serious bodily \n11 \ninjury to him or herself, officers, or the general public or who is engaging in substantial \n12 \n13  destruction of property which creates an immediate risk to the lives or safety of other persons. \n14 \nIn such instances, SIM shall be used only when other means of arrest are unsafe and when the \n15 \nindividual can be targeted without endangering other crowd members or bystanders, i.e., when \n16 \nthe officer has a clear shot โ not in the midst of a crowd. (Exhibit A, ยถ VI.F.2, p. 15 and \n17 \nExhibit B.)  \n18 \n19  31.  An OPD Chiefโs Memorandum to all personnel further clarifies OPDโs policy regarding \n20 \nuse of SIM at crowd events, stating: โThe mere fact that an individual is picking up, about to \n21 \nthrow, or throwing a chemical agent canister previously deployed by OPD, or other object, \n22 \ndoes not automatically constitute an immediate threat of loss of life or serious bodily injury. \n23 \nMembers must consider the size and composition of the object and the distance from which it is \n24 \n25  being thrown.โ (Exhibit C, Chiefโs Nov. 19, 2014 Memo.) \n26 \n32.  The Chiefโs Memorandum goes on to clarify that โEven when an individual's conduct \n27 \ndoes constitute an immediate threat of loss of life or serious bodily injury, Direct Fired SIM \n28 \n \n \nNo. 3:21-cv-02881-RS Gaffett v. City of Oakland | 2d AMD CMPLT |   8 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-RS   Document 44   Filed 10/22/21   Page 9 of 46\n \n1  shall be used only when other means of arrest are unsafe and when the individual can be \n2 \ntargeted without endangering other crowd members or bystanders. The member using SIM \n3 \nmust have a shot the member reasonably believes can be taken and will only impact the \n4 \nintended target, given consideration of how close the individual is to others, whether crowd \n5 \nmembers are moving, and factors that may affect visibility and the accuracy of shot placement, \n6 \n7  such as chemical agent deployment.โ (Exhibit C.) \n8 \n33.  The Chiefโs Memorandum also states that โMedical attention shall be provided to any \n9 \nindividual struck by SIM. All officers at the scene are responsible for ensuring that medical \n10 \nattention is available for injured persons and for people affected by \n11 \nchemical agents.โ (Exhibit C.) \n12 \n13  34.  OPD and the City adopted these restrictions to prevent another tragedy like the \n14 \npermanent brain damage sustained by Scott Olsen, a young veteran who was accidentally \n15 \nstruck in the head with a police \"bean bag\" while peacefully standing at a 2011 demonstration. \n16 \nMr. Olsen received a $4.5 million settlement from the City, but will never regain full mental \n17 \nfunction.โ2 \n18 \n19  35.  It is well recognized that impact munitions or SIM, also known as KIP or PIW, can \n20 \ncause injuries ranging from localized contusions to severe organ damage and death. Data from \n21 \n1,984 SIM injuries revealed that 3% died and 15.5% were permanently disabled as a result of \n22 \nbeing shot with SIM.3 \n23 \n24 \n \n25 \n \n26 \n2Olsen v.

Indeed, close-range firing of SIM/ KIP results in injury patterns similar to those seen \n2 \nwith live ammunition, causing severe injuries and disabilities. It is important to note that while \n3 \nfactors such as a large surface area may reduce the risk of skin penetration, they increase the \n4 \ninaccuracy of the weapon. SIMs/ KIPs, therefore, are not only likely to be lethal at close range, \n5 \nbut are likely to be inaccurate and indiscriminate at longer ranges, even those recommended by \n6 \n7  manufacturers for safety.4 Following an extensive review of the medical literature, Physicians \n8 \nfor Human Rights made findings consistent with OPDโs prohibition on using SIM for crowd \n9 \ncontrol:  \n10 \nThe classification of KIPs as โless-lethalโ contradicts extensive research illustrating \n11 \nthat these weapons can cause serious injuries, permanent disabilities, and death. Severe \n12  injuries are more likely when KIPs are fired at close range, as some types of KIPs have \nthe same ability to penetrate the skin as conventional live ammunition and can be just \n13 \nas lethal. When launched or fired from afar, these weapons are often inaccurate and can \n14  strike vulnerable body parts, causing unintended injuries to bystanders. Therefore, PHR \nconsiders that KIPs are not an appropriate weapon for crowd management and \n15 \nspecifically for dispersal purposes. PHR thus recommends that localities move to ban \n16 \ntheir use altogether in crowd-control situations, due to the egregious and life-\nthreatening injuries they can cause, particularly given their inherently indiscriminate \n17 \nnature in crowd-control situations.5  \n18 \n \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22   \n \n23 \n24  doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2017-018154; <https://bmjopen.bmj.com โบ bmjopen โบ 7 โบ \ne018154.full.pdf>, accessed Oct. 17, 2021, pp. 2-5. \n25  4 Physicians for Human Rights and INCLO Lethal in Disguise: The Health Impacts of Crowd-\nControl Weapons (2016) https://www.inclo.net/issues/lethal-in-disguise/ accessed Oct. 17, 2021. \n26 \n \n27  5 Physicians for Human Rights, Shot in the Head, Sept. 14, 2020, \nhttps://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/29cbf2e87b914dbaabdec2f3d350839e accessed Oct. 17, \n28  2021, emphasis added. \n \n \n \nNo. 3:21-cv-02881-RS Gaffett v.

Are briefed and in agreement with OPDโs Unity of Command structure under \nwhich only OPD Commanders may authorize the use of less lethal munitions \n10 \nfor crowd control and dispersal;  \n11 \n2.  Are briefed on OPDโs policy on prohibited weapons and force; \n3.  Do not bring or use any weapons or force that is prohibited under OPDโs \n12 \npolicy;  \n13 \n4.  Are provided a copy of OPDโs Crowd Control Policy and Use of Force \n14  policies;  \n5.  Are not assigned to front-line positions or used for crowd intervention, control \n15 \nor dispersal unless there is a public safety emergencyโฆ. \n16   \n(Exhibit A, ยถ IX, pp. 20-21.) \n17 \n \n18  39.  The above provisions regarding mutual aid were added to the OPD Policy in 2013 as \n19 \npart of the aforementioned Spalding and Campbell settlement agreements, after mutual aid \n20 \nagencies such as ACSO caused many injuries through their use of SIM and hand-thrown \n21 \npyrotechnic grenades in a manner prohibited by Oaklandโs Policy during the Occupy Oakland \n22 \ndemonstrations in 2011-2012. Following widescale public outcry over the law enforcement \n23 \n24  excessive force at those demonstrations, OPD asked Sheriff AHERN and ACSO to seek \n25 \n \n26 \n \n27 \n6 Physicians for Human Rights, Shot in the Head, Sept. 14, 2020, \n28  https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/29cbf2e87b914dbaabdec2f3d350839e accessed Oct. 17, \n2021. \n \n \nNo. 3:21-cv-02881-RS Gaffett v.

In effect, Defendant \n4 \nAHERN and ALAMEDA COUNTY were condoning the use of indiscriminate, \n5 \nunconstitutionally excessive force on protesters, with the acquiescence of OPD and the CITY \n6 \n7  OF OAKLAND.7  \n8 \n40.  The City of Oakland had the Frazier Group conduct an independent investigation of the \n9 \npolice response to Occupy Oakland, and adopted its report, findings and recommendations. \n10 \nThese included, inter alia, that Mutual Aid officers should not be comingled with OPD officers \n11 \non the front lines, โeven under extreme conditionsโ, but rather, assigned specific missions to be \n12 \n13  carried out with department and unit integrity under the direction of OPD. (Frazier Report, \n14 \nJune 14, 2012, p. 13.) \n15 \n41.  However, even after the provisions concerning mutual aid were added to the OPD \n16 \nCrowd Control Policy by agreement and federal court order, ACSO continued to communicate \n17 \nto Oakland Police Department command staff that ACSO would not comply with the OPD \n18 \n19  Crowd Control Policy when providing mutual aid in Oakland. SHERIFF AHERN and/or his \n20 \nagents communicated that ACSO personnel would not comply with the Policyโs restrictions on \n21 \nuse of chemical agents and less lethal munitions; would use chemical agents and less lethal \n22 \nmunitions without the authorization of OPD Commanders; and would bring and use weapons \n23 \nand force that are prohibited under OPDโs policy while providing mutual aid in Oakland.

At about 8 p.m. on May 29, 2020, demonstrators assembled at Broadway and 14th \n9 \nStreet in Oakland to express their views regarding the policing system that has systematically \n10 \nkilled Black people and other people of color. Other participants came with medical supplies, \n11 \nwater, and other aid for the demonstrators. And others, including journalists, legal observers, \n12 \n13  and passersby, simply observed the demonstration. Most of the demonstrators and observers \n14 \nwore masks and observed social distancing. \n15 \n43.  The defendants would ultimately inflict the same sort of ruthless violence on the \n16 \ndemonstrators that the demonstrators were protesting, and that is prohibited by the OPD Crowd \n17 \nControl and Crowd Management Policy: indiscriminately dispersing teargas and shooting \n18 \n19  impact munitions into the crowd, and detonating explosive grenades to cause panic and \n20 \ndisorientation. (See Exhibit A.) \n21 \n44.  Defendant RONALD HOLMGREN was the Incident Commander, and Defendant \n22 \nRANDELL WINGATE was the Operations Chief, who planned, commanded and supervised the \n23 \nOPD and mutual aid officersโ response to the May 29, 2020, demonstration. \n24 \n25  45.  On May 29, 2020, plaintiff Jasmine Gaffett attended the demonstration in downtown \n26 \nOakland to express her opposition to racist police violence and support for the Black Lives \n27 \nMatter movement.  \n28 \n \n \nNo. 3:21-cv-02881-RS Gaffett v.

Some time after 9pm, OPD and ACSO officers, formed a line across Broadway near 7th \n2 \nStreet in which officers from both departments were comingled on the front line -- exactly as \n3 \nthe City of Oaklandโs own Frazier Report had found should not be done.  \n4 \n47.  Despite the fact that the crowd was largely peaceful, OPD declared the demonstration \n5 \nan unlawful assembly, without lawful basis. At the same time, the OPD and ACSO officers \n6 \n7  began using CS Blast grenades and Stinger Grenades, and teargas, such that the crowd did not \n8 \nhave a chance to disperse in compliance with the order before being subjected to the chemical \n9 \nagents and volley of small explosives -- which is explicitly prohibited by the OPD Policy. \n10 \n(Exhibit A, ยถ V.H.4.e, V.H.5.c, p. 14.) They also began shooting impact munitions into the \n11 \ncrowd -- which is also explicitly prohibited by the OPD Policy. (Exhibit A, ยถ VI.F.2, p. 15: \n12 \n13  โDirect Fired SIM may never be used indiscriminately against a crowd or group of persons \n14 \neven if some members of the crowd or group are violent or disruptive.โ) \n15 \n48.  Plaintiff Gaffett stood near the front of the crowd, closest to the police line, wearing a \n16 \nred bandanna. She chanted and expressed views critical of the police and their response to the \n17 \ndemonstration. Ms. Gaffett and the rest of the crowd retreated when the police began \n18 \n19  teargassing and shooting, but when the chemical agent cleared, they came back to continue \n20 \ndemonstrating against police violence. \n21 \n49.  Ms. Gaffett, and others near her, were yelling at the police and telling them that what \n22 \nthey were doing was wrong, but neither Ms. Gaffett, nor anyone near her, were throwing \n23 \nanything, physically or verbally threatening the police, or trying to breach the police line.  \n24 \n25  50.  Then, without warning, DOE OPD and/or ACSO officers shot Ms. Gaffett twice in the \n26 \nleg, in quick succession, with impact munitions. Ms. Gaffett turned around and tried to run \n27 \naway from the police, but the DOE officers aimed at her and deliberately shot her again and \n28 \n \n \nNo. 3:21-cv-02881-RS Gaffett v. City of Oakland | 2d AMD CMPLT |   14 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-RS   Document 44   Filed 10/22/21   Page 15 of 46\n \n1  again, while she fled. DOE OPD and/or ACSO \n2 \ndefendants shot Ms. Gaffett a total of at least \n3 \ntwenty times, all over her body. After the first two \n4 \nshots, the DOE defendants kept shooting Ms. \n5 \nGaffett from behind as she ran from them.  \n6 \n7  51.  Ms. Gaffett never presented any threat \n8 \nwhatsoever to any of the OPD or ACSO officers \n9 \nor to anyone else. There was no justification for \n10 \nthe defendants to use any force on her, and thus \n11 \nthe twenty-plus shots with highly dangerous \n12 \n13  impact munitions were completely unnecessary \n14 \nand unlawful. \n15 \n52.  Ms. Gaffett finally escaped further fire by lying on the ground behind a utility box. No \n16 \nOPD or ACSO officer offered her any first aid or summoned medical aid for her despite the \n17 \nfact that the shooting occurred in full view of the entire line of OPD and ACSO officers. This, \n18 \n19  too, violated the OPD Policy. (Exhibit A, ยถ VI.F.2.c, p. 15: โAny person struck by a round \n20 \nshall be transported to a hospital for observation and any necessary treatment. Ambulance \n21 \nservice, if required, shall be ordered per Department General Order I-4, AMBULANCE \n22 \nSERVICE. First aid, when necessary, shall be administered per Training Bulletin III-K, FIRST \n23 \nAID.โ) \n24 \n25  53.  A nurse who was acting as a medic for injured demonstrators gave Ms. Gaffett aid, and \n26 \nshe was eventually able to get home. \n27 \n28 \n \n \nNo. 3:21-cv-02881-RS Gaffett v.

Among other places, she was hit close to her \n2 \nspleen, kidneys, spine, and groin, and in her right ring finger. \n3 \n55.  The OPD Crowd Control Policy prohibits officers from discharging SIM at a person's left \n4 \narmpit, spine, kidneys, or groin unless deadly force would be justified. (Exhibit A, ยถ VI.F.2.h, p. \n5 \n16.) \n6 \n7  56.  In severe pain, Ms. Gaffett could barely move for two days, requiring assistance for the \n8 \nmost basic functions. She remained laid up at home, in pain, for two weeks, but because she had \n9 \nbeen laid off due to the pandemic and had no health insurance, she did not immediately seek \n10 \nhealthcare.  \n11 \n57.  When Ms. Gaffett was seen at a clinic two weeks after being shot she still had visible \n12 \n13  ecchymosis with hard, swollen lumps, and her right ring finger was found to be fractured. \n14 \nThe June 1 Oakland Demonstration: Toshua Sears and Kierra Brown \n15 \n58.  On June 1, 2020, young people including many Black and Brown high school students \n16 \nand others held a march to protest racist police violence. The march started at Oakland Technical \n17 \nHigh School, and was planned to end with speeches at the Oakland Police Administration \n18 \n19  Building. At the onset, the organizers announced that the protest was peaceful and explicitly \n20 \ncalled for โno destruction.โ  \n21 \n59.  Despite the fact that the march was peaceful, Alameda County declared an 8pm curfew. \n22 \nAlso, on June 1, 2020, the City of Oakland declared a local emergency and 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. \n23 \ncurfew.  \n24 \n25  60.  Defendant LERONNE ARMSTRONG was the Incident Commander, and Defendant \n26 \nRANDELL WINGATE was the Operations Chief, who planned, commanded and supervised the \n27 \nOPD and mutual aid officersโ response to the June 1, 2020, demonstration. \n28 \n \n \nNo. 3:21-cv-02881-RS Gaffett v.

Well prior to the curfew hour, Oakland and Alameda County officers formed lines \n2 \nblocking the demonstratorsโ path, forcing many of them to stop at Oscar Grant / Frank Ogawa \n3 \nPlaza rather than at the Police Administration Building.    \n4 \n62.  At approximately 5 p.m., after the march had already started, the County of Alameda and \n5 \nthe City of Oakland began disseminating the message that a curfew would begin just three hours \n6 \n7  later.  \n8 \n63.  A smaller number of demonstrators continued from Oscar Grant Plaza towards the Police \n9 \nAdministration Building. At Washington Street and 8th Street, the demonstrators met a line of \n10 \npolice outfitted in full riot gear. The OPD โkettledโ the group via line formations and by way of \n11 \ntheir vehicles, blocking opportunities for egress.  \n12 \n13  64.  Without warning and before the curfew hour, the OPD and ACSO used chemical \n14 \nweapons, threw explosive blast grenades and pyrotechnic devices, and shot impact munitions \n15 \ninto the crowd of confined demonstrators, causing chaos. A dispersal announcement that many \n16 \nor most of the crowd could not hear or decipher was made a couple of seconds prior to the \n17 \nbombardment of chemical weapons, impact munitions and blast grenades.  The police filled the \n18 \n19  entire block between 8th and 9th St. with a virtual wall of CS gas and smoke that impeded, rather \n20 \nthan aided the demonstrators in dispersing as people had difficult seeing and breathing, and \n21 \nimpacted neighboring residents and business in this dense urban area of downtown Oakland. \n22 \n65.  Plaintiffs KIERRA BROWN and TOSHUA SEARS each attended the June 1, 2020, \n23 \nmarch to protest racist police violence. Mr. Sears, who is Black, carried a sign, โAll lives matter \n24 \n25  even oursโ.  \n26 \n66.  TOSHUA SEARS was in the area of 8th and Broadway, when well before 8pm, DOE \n27 \nOAKLAND Police and ALAMEDA COUNTY Sheriff officers blocked egress on three sides and \n28 \n \n \nNo. 3:21-cv-02881-RS Gaffett v. City of Oakland | 2d AMD CMPLT |   17 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-RS   Document 44   Filed 10/22/21   Page 18 of 46\n \n1  at about 7:40pm, without warning, DOE OAKLAND \n2 \nand ALAMEDA COUNTY officers threw and shot \n3 \nchemical weapons, explosive grenades and SIM into \n4 \nthe crowd. The crowd had been peaceful, and Mr. \n5 \nSears did not hear the police give any warnings, \n6 \n7  orders or announcements, nor did he see any crowd \n8 \nactivity that would justify the sudden use of force. \n9 \nMr. Sears began to leave, when suddenly, he felt an \n10 \nenormous impact as a DOE OAKLAND Police or \n11 \nALAMEDA COUNTY Sheriff officer shot him with \n12 \n13  an impact projectile in the right hip / buttock area.  \n14 \n67.  At first, Mr. Sears did not know if he had been shot with a live bullet or a so-called less \n15 \nlethal impact munition. It was terrifying. Chemical agent burned Mr. Searsโ eyes, mouth and \n16 \nnose. It was hard to see and breathe. He hobbled away as best he could and called his wife to \n17 \npick him up. \n18 \n19  68.  At home, Mr. Sears washed his face and flushed his eyes out but his eyes swelled and \n20 \nremained swollen for days. His vision was affected as a result of chemical conjunctivitis caused \n21 \nby his exposure to the chemical agent. His hip remained extremely painful and developed a \n22 \nlarge, hard, swollen lump. It was hard to read or walk for some time. He could not sleep on his \n23 \nside. The lump and pain persisted for months.  \n24 \n25  69.  Mr. Sears never presented any threat whatsoever to any of the OPD or ACSO officers \n26 \nor to anyone else. There was no justification for the defendants to use any force on him, and \n27 \nthus both the shot and teargas were completely unnecessary and unlawful. \n28 \n \n \nNo. 3:21-cv-02881-RS Gaffett v.

Many other demonstrators were shot in the back as they were fleeing the shooting, \n2 \nexplosive grenades and chemical weapons, only to be impeded by police lines kettling them \n3 \nfrom all directions.  \n4 \n71.  Public health and other medical experts have condemned the use of teargas and other \n5 \nrespiratory irritants on protesters as increasing the risk for COVID-19 by making the respiratory \n6 \n7  tract more susceptible to infection, exacerbating existing inflammation, and inducing coughing, \n8 \nas well as by forcing those exposed to remove masks that have been contaminated.  \n9 \n72.  KIERRA BROWN was not at 8th and Broadway when the police used the chemical \n10 \nweapons, but went to 14th and Broadway after the march to help wash peopleโs eyes who had \n11 \nbeen affected by the chemical agent. While Ms. Brown was doing this, the police approached \n12 \n13  and pushed the crowd further up Broadway. Ms. Brown was running toward 15th Street, which \n14 \nwas what it seemed the police wanted the crowd to do, when a DOE OAKLAND or ALAMEDA \n15 \nCOUNTY Sheriff officer shot her in the back of her right leg.  \n16 \n73.  The OAKLAND and ALAMEDA COUNTY officers then trapped Ms. Brown and others \n17 \nbetween their lines and detained them, zip tying Ms. Brown and the othersโ hands. The kettling \n18 \n19  occurred before 8pm. \n20 \n74.  DOE OAKLAND Police officers took Ms. Brown to a parking garage for processing \n21 \nbefore ultimately releasing her with a citation. She was never charged with any crime.  \n22 \n75.  Ms. Brown never presented any threat whatsoever to any of the OPD or ACSO officers \n23 \nor to anyone else. There was no justification for the defendants to use any force on her, and \n24 \n25  thus shooting her with highly dangerous SIM as she attempted to flee in response to the police \n26 \naction was completely unnecessary and unlawful. \n27 \n76.  There was no probable cause to arrest Ms. Brown. \n28 \n \n \nNo. 3:21-cv-02881-RS Gaffett v.

She \n2 \nexperienced uncomfortable tingling, and her leg developed a hard, swollen lump.  \n3 \n78.  Ms. Brown has never regained full sensation in her right leg and is at risk of losing \n4 \nmobility in her foot as a result of being shot by the DOE OPD or ACSO officer. \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n \n13 \n14   \n15 \n79.  Ms. Gaffett, Ms. Brown and Mr. Sears wish to continue to express their views on police \n16 \nbrutality and institutionalized racism by participating in public protests on the streets of Oakland, \n17 \nbut are afraid that they will again be subjected to unlawful law enforcement violence and \n18 \nwrongful arrests.  \n19 \n20  80.  Defendantsโ actions on May 29 and June 1 violated every provision of the CITY OF \n21 \nOAKLANDโs Crowd Management and Crowd Control Policy that the attorneys had warned \n22 \nabout in their May 29 letter, and more. Oaklandโs own policy and the law are clear that verbal \n23 \ncriticism or abuse of officers is not grounds for arrest or use of force. And while police may use \n24 \nforce to defend themselves against an individual, it is both illegal and a violation of Oaklandโs \n25 \n26  policy to use impact munitions indiscriminately against a crowd. \n27 \n81.   Defendantsโ actions on May 29 and June 1 violated the Policyโs provisions which \n28 \nprohibit impact munitions and explosive grenades from being fired into crowds, and allow \n \n \nNo. 3:21-cv-02881-RS Gaffett v.

A, ยถ VI.F.2.a, p. 15); provisions \n5 \nlimiting the use of chemical weapons (Ex.

A, ยถ IX, p. 20). ACSO brought and used prohibited weapons including Stinger \n10 \nGrenades at the May 29 and June 1 events, violating Oaklandโs Policy, ยถ IX.3, and ACSO \n11 \nofficers, including the DOE ACSO defendants, were comingled with OPD in front-line positions, \n12 \n13  violating ยถ IX.5 and the City of Oaklandโs Frazier Report findings.  \n14 \n82.  On May 29 and June 1, defendants also violated the Crowd Control Policy provision \n15 \nproviding that โAny person struck by a round shall be transported to a hospital for observation \n16 \nand any necessary treatment.โ (Exhibit A, ยถ VI.F.2.c, p. 15.) None of the plaintiffs were offered \n17 \nmedical aid by OPD or City of Oakland personnel (or by ACSO personnel). \n18 \n19  83.  Following the May 29 โ June 1 demonstrations, CITY OF OAKLAND officials made a \n20 \nnumber of false and misleading statements to the public and media about the demonstrations and \n21 \nthe actions of OAKLAND police officers and mutual aid agencies, fabricating and/or \n22 \nexaggerating reports of property destruction and supposed aggression by demonstrators while \n23 \nminimizing the police violence and injuries caused by the police.  \n24 \n25  84.  As part of this cover-up and failure to hold officers accountable for the excessive force, \n26 \non being confronted with a photograph of Ms. Gaffettโs injuries, which were inflicted by \n27 \ndefendants on May 29, CITY OF OAKLAND officials stated falsely and publicly that the \n28 \n \n \nNo. 3:21-cv-02881-RS Gaffett v.

Defendantsโ acts were willful, wanton, malicious, and oppressive, and done with \n3 \nconscious disregard and deliberate indifference for plaintiffโs rights and safety, justifying an \n4 \naward of punitive damages.  \n5 \n86.  As a direct and proximate result of the conduct of defendants described herein, plaintiffs \n6 \n7  have been denied their constitutional, statutory and legal rights as stated below, and have \n8 \nsuffered general and special damages, including but not limited to, pain, suffering, humiliation, \n9 \nemotional distress, fear, anxiety, disabilities, medical and related expenses, and other damages in \n10 \namounts according to proof.  \n11 \n87.   Plaintiffs have incurred, and will continue to incur, attorneysโ fees and costs in amounts \n12 \n13  to be determined according to proof. \n14 \nVII.

The constitutional violations alleged herein were the proximate result of decisions, \n16 \norders, acts and omissions of the CITY OF OAKLANDโS authorized policymakers including but \n17 \nnot limited to defendants MANHEIMER and ARMSTRONG; and ALAMEDA COUNTYโs \n18 \n19  policymakers including but not limited to defendant AHERN. \n20 \n89.

These decisions, orders, acts and omissions which caused the constitutional violations \n27 \nalso included a tacit or explicit agreement by MANHEIMER, ARMSTRONG, AHERN, and \n28 \n \n \nNo. 3:21-cv-02881-RS Gaffett v.

In addition, MANHEIMER, ARMSTRONG, AHERN, and DOE City officials and \n14 \nCounty officials caused the CITY OF OAKLAND police officersโ and ALAMEDA COUNTY \n15 \nSheriffโs officersโ constitutional violations complained of herein by failing to provide adequate \n16 \npolicies, training, supervision, and command of their officers assigned to the May 29- June 1, \n17 \n2020, demonstrations to stop the officers from using excessive force, making wrongful arrests, \n18 \n19  and depriving plaintiffs and class members of their First Amendment rights. This failure to \n20 \nprovide adequate policies, training, supervision, and command included, inter alia: \n21 \nโข  MANHEIMER, ARMSTRONG, and other CITY OF OAKLAND officials failed to \n22 \nprovide OPD officers assigned to the 2020 demonstrations with sufficient, regular \n23 \ntraining on the OPD Crowd Control Policy, constitutional restrictions on the use of \n24 \n25  force, particularly in the context of crowd events and First Amendment events, and \n26 \nlawful crowd management and crowd control tactics.  \n27 \n28 \n \n \nNo. 3:21-cv-02881-RS Gaffett v.

Plaintiffs further allege that the constitutional violations alleged herein were the \n5 \nproximate result of a repeated course of conduct by members of the OPD and ACSO tantamount \n6 \n7  to a custom, policy, pattern or repeated practice of condoning, ratifying and/or tacitly \n8 \nencouraging the abuse of police authority, and disregard for the constitutional rights of citizens, \n9 \nincluding the rights of the plaintiffs and class members. \n10 \n94.  Plaintiffs are further informed and believe and thereon allege that the constitutional \n11 \nviolations alleged herein were the proximate result of a custom, policy, pattern or practice of \n12 \n13  deliberate indifference by defendants CITY OF OAKLAND and ALAMEDA COUNTY to the \n14 \nrepeated violations of the constitutional rights of citizens by defendantsโ law enforcement \n15 \nofficers, which have included, but are not limited to, the repeated use of excessive force, and the \n16 \nrepeated failure to properly and/or adequately train, supervise and/or discipline officers with \n17 \nrespect to the use of excessive force, constitutional limitations on the use of force; the repeated \n18 \n19  failure by CITY OF OAKLAND and ALAMEDA COUNTYโs high ranking officials, OPD and \n20 \nACSO managers and/or supervisors to hold officers accountable for violating the rights of \n21 \ncitizens; and/or other customs, policies and/or practices subject to continuing discovery. \n22 \n95.  The CITY OF OAKLANDโs customs, policies, pattern and practice of condoning, \n23 \nratifying, tacitly encouraging, and deliberate indifference to officersโ constitutional violations are \n24 \n25  exemplified by the following facts:  In 2003, the United States District Court approved a \n26 \nnegotiated settlement agreement (NSA) placing the Oakland Police Department under the \n27 \nCourtโs supervision until such time as it had implemented a number of specified reforms to hold \n28 \n \n \nNo. 3:21-cv-02881-RS Gaffett v. City of Oakland | 2d AMD CMPLT |   25 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-RS   Document 44   Filed 10/22/21   Page 26 of 46\n \n1  OPD officers accountable for violating peopleโs rights and to prevent excessive force and other \n2 \npolice misconduct. Allen v. City of Oakland, USDC ND Cal. No. 3:00-cv-04599. The NSA \n3 \nreforms were initially planned to take place within five years. However, in more than eighteen \n4 \nyears now, the CITY OF OAKLAND and OPD has failed to fully implement the required \n5 \nreforms. And in 2005, the CITY OF OAKLAND and OPD first agreed to follow, train on, and \n6 \n7  implement the OPD Crowd Control Policy, as described in ยถ 3 above. Yet, for sixteen years now, \n8 \nalmost every time that there is an upsurgence of demonstration activity in Oakland, such as \n9 \nduring the Justice for Oscar Grant movement, the Occupy Oakland movement, and the 2020 \n10 \nGeorge Floyd demonstrations, OPD and mutual aid assisting OPD have violated OAKLANDโs \n11 \nown Policy, invariably causing the violation of demonstrators' constitutional rights. \n12 \n13  96.   ALAMEDA COUNTYโs customs, policies, pattern and practice of condoning, ratifying, \n14 \ntacitly encouraging, and deliberate indifference to officersโ constitutional violations are \n15 \nexemplified by the following facts. During the economic justice demonstrations associated with \n16 \nthe Occupy Oakland movement in 2011-2012, and subsequent demonstrations in which ACSO \n17 \nprovided mutual aid to the CITY OF OAKLAND, deputies repeatedly used excessive force \n18 \n19  against unarmed and non-threatening demonstrators, causing serious injuries, but defendant \n20 \nAHERN failed to hold deputies accountable and has made a number of public statements \n21 \ncondoning ACSOโs use of weapons and force prohibited by the OPD Crowd Control Policy. \n22 \nAHERN has also failed to hold his deputies accountable for repeated abuses in other law \n23 \nenforcement contexts and in the ALAMEDA COUNTY Jail.  As of 2020, the ACSO led the \n24 \n25  region in wrongful deaths and excessive force payouts, with $27.6 million over five years. It \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n \nNo. 3:21-cv-02881-RS Gaffett v.

AHERNโs actions in allowing \n4 \ncondoning, or encouraging deputies to use excessive force create an atmosphere where deputies \n5 \nresort to unconstitutional excessive force because they are either encouraged to so, or at least \n6 \n7  know they will not be punished. \n8 \n97.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that defendants MANHEIMER, ARMSTRONG, \n9 \nHOLMGREN, WINGATE, AHERN, and DOE OPD and ACSO supervisors, and/or each of \n10 \nthem, caused the violation of the plaintiffsโ constitutional rights as a result of their supervisory \n11 \nmalfeasance and/or deliberate indifference to the need for more or different training, supervision \n12 \n13  and/or discipline of the CITY OF OAKLAND Police and ALAMEDA COUNTY Sheriffโs \n14 \nOffice personnel assigned to the subject incident, to prevent the foreseeable violation of \n15 \nplaintiffsโ constitutional rights, as further discussed above. \n16 \nVIII. CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n17 \n98.  Plaintiffs seek class certification pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a), and Fed.R.Civ.P. \n18 \n19  23(b)(2), to pursue claims for injunctive and declaratory relief on behalf of themselves and all \n20 \npersons similarly situated.   \n21 \n99.  The class is defined as all persons who have in the past participated, presently are \n22 \nparticipating, or may in the future participate in, or be present at, demonstrations and crowd \n23 \nevents within the City of Oakland in the lawful exercise of their rights of free speech, assembly, \n24 \n25 \n26   \n27   \n28  8 https://oaklandside.org/2021/04/13/sheriff-candidates-alameda-county-sb271-gregory-ahern-\nlaw-enforcement-experience/ \n \n \nNo. 3:21-cv-02881-RS Gaffett v.

This case satisfies the prerequisites of a Rule 23 class action. The class is so numerous \n4 \nthat joinder of all members is impracticable. The class consists of hundreds or even thousands of \n5 \npeople. \n6 \n7  101.  There are questions of law and fact common to the class, in that the named plaintiffs \n8 \nclaim that defendantsโ unlawful use of force and threats of force at the demonstrations described \n9 \nherein, were based on OPD and ACSO policies and orders that were unlawful and chilled their \n10 \nFirst Amendment rights. \n11 \n102.  The questions of law and/or fact which predominate over any question affecting only \n12 \n13  individual class members include whether defendants improperly declared an unlawful assembly \n14 \ndepriving peaceful participants of their First Amendment rights, whether defendants used \n15 \nexcessive force against peaceful participants, whether defendants' motivation was to deprive \n16 \nparticipants of their First Amendment rights, and whether defendants engaged in racial, content \n17 \nand viewpoint-discrimination. \n18 \n19  103.  By ordering and allowing officers to use unjustified force on the crowd at the \n20 \ndemonstrations, and failing to implement policies prohibiting such use of excessive force and \n21 \nrequiring OPD to brief mutual aid agencies on the Crowd Control and Crowd Management \n22 \nPolicy, ensure they do not bring or use any weapons or force that is prohibited under this policy, \n23 \nand not assign mutual aid to front-line positions unless there is a public safety emergency, \n24 \n25  defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to the class, so that injunctive and \n26 \ndeclaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.  \n27 \n28 \n \n \nNo. 3:21-cv-02881-RS Gaffett v. City of Oakland | 2d AMD CMPLT |   28 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-RS   Document 44   Filed 10/22/21   Page 29 of 46\n \n1  104.  The questions of law and fact common to the classes, which are outlined above, \n2 \npredominate over any questions affecting only individual members.  \n3 \n105.  The claims of the named plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the class in that the named \n4 \nplaintiffs and class members claim that their First Amendment rights have been chilled by the \n5 \nsame misconduct of defendants and seek protection to bar the repeat of those violations in the \n6 \n7  future.  \n8 \n106.  The class representatives will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class \n9 \nbecause they were subject to the unlawful law enforcement conduct complained of herein, and \n10 \nhave no interests antagonistic to the class.  \n11 \n107.  The class representatives will fairly and adequately represent the common class interest. \n12 \n13  The class representatives have a strong interest in achieving the relief requested in this \n14 \nComplaint, they have no conflicts with members of the plaintiff class, and they will fairly and \n15 \nadequately protect the interests of the class.  \n16 \n108.  The class representatives are represented by counsel who are well-experienced in federal \n17 \ncivil rights class action litigation and are familiar with the issues in this case. \n18 \n19  109.  Counsel for the class representatives know of no conflicts among or between members of \n20 \nthe class, the named plaintiffs, or the attorneys in this action.  \n21 \n110.  In accordance with FRCP Rule 23(b)(1)(A), the prosecution of separate actions by \n22 \nindividual members of the class would create a risk of inconsistent or incompatible standards of \n23 \nconduct for the defendants, thereby making a class action the superior method of adjudicating the \n24 \n25  controversy.  \n26 \n111.  In accordance with FRCP Rule 23(b)(1)(B), prosecutions of separate actions by \n27 \nindividual members of the classes would create a risk of adjudications with respect to individual \n28 \n \n \nNo. 3:21-cv-02881-RS Gaffett v.

In accordance with FRCP Rule 23(b)(2), defendants have acted on grounds generally \n4 \napplicable to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is \n5 \nappropriate respecting the class as a whole. \n6 \n7   \n8 \nIX.

The Defendants engaged in repeated, widespread violations of law, as outlined above, \n17 \nover the course of at least several nights, using excessive force against hundreds if not thousands \n18 \n19  of protestors in retaliation for their protected First Amendment activity; imposing a curfew \n20 \nwithout accommodating the right to peaceable assembly and protest; declaring unlawful \n21 \nassemblies without adequate sound amplification and without providing adequate notice, means \n22 \nand opportunity to disperse before taking aggressive police action including the use of highly \n23 \ndangerous impact munitions / SIM, chemical weapons and explosive grenades; hitting large \n24 \n25  numbers of protestors with impact munitions / SIM, grenades, and using chemical weapons on \n26 \nthem, all with unreasonable and excessive force; failing to provide medical aid or \n27 \ndecontamination to persons defendants shot and/or teargassed; and unlawfully arresting and \n28 \n \n \nNo. 3:21-cv-02881-RS Gaffett v.

The CITY OF OAKLAND, through MANHEIMER, ARMSTRONG and the OPD, and \n3 \nALAMEDA COUNTY, through AHERN and the ACSO, have failed to train their officers in the \n4 \nconstitutional responses to demonstrations as revealed by the above allegations. \n5 \n116.   Without intervention by this Court, the plaintiffs and class members, who have \n6 \n7  participated, observed or documented protest activities and wish to do so in the future, \n8 \nparticularly related to police violence and racial justice, are at risk of having their rights violated \n9 \nin the future due to the defendantsโ demonstrated pattern of constitutional violations. The \n10 \nplaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law to protect the future lawful exercise of their \n11 \nconstitutional rights, and, without action by this court, will suffer irreparable injury, thereby \n12 \n13  entitling them to injunctive and declaratory relief. \n14 \n117.  The Defendants have acted and refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the \n15 \nputative class. Injunctive and declaratory relief for the class as a whole is appropriate. \n16 \n118.  Defendantsโ policies, practices, customs, conduct and acts alleged herein have resulted \n17 \nand will continue to result in irreparable injury to the plaintiffs, including but not limited to \n18 \n19  violations of their constitutional and statutory rights. Plaintiffs have no plain, adequate or \n20 \ncomplete remedy at law to address the wrongs described herein. Plaintiffs intend in the future to \n21 \nexercise their constitutional rights of freedom of speech and association by engaging in \n22 \ndemonstrations, observation and documentation of demonstrations and police actions, and other \n23 \nexpressive activities in the City of Oakland. Defendantsโ conduct described herein has created \n24 \n25  fear, anxiety and uncertainty among plaintiffs with respect to their exercise now and in the future \n26 \nof these constitutional rights. \n27 \n119.  Specifically, plaintiffs are concerned that if they participate in, observe or document \n28 \n \n \nNo. 3:21-cv-02881-RS Gaffett v.

Plaintiffs are concerned that, when they are engaged in protest activities, Defendants will \n4 \nimpose curfews without accommodating or attempting to accommodate First Amendment rights; \n5 \nwill not provide adequate notice of such curfews or in the event unlawful assemblies are \n6 \n7  declared; will not provide adequate means and opportunity to disperse; and will again employ \n8 \nindiscriminate, racially discriminatory, unreasonable or excessive force, injuring and terrifying \n9 \nprotestors. \n10 \n121.  Plaintiffs are also concerned that that if they participate in, observe or document protest \n11 \nactivities in the City of Oakland they will be wrongfully detained and arrested by members of \n12 \n13  OPD and/or ACSO. \n14 \n122.  Plaintiffs therefore seek injunctive relief from this court to ensure that plaintiffs and \n15 \npersons similarly situated will not suffer violations of their rights from defendantsโ illegal and \n16 \nunconstitutional policies, customs, and practices described herein. \n17 \n123.  Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief in the form of an order prohibiting OPD and ACSO from \n18 \n19  using chemical weapons, explosive grenades, and impact munitions in crowds. \n20 \n124.  Plaintiffs also seek injunctive relief in the form of an order requiring that defendants seal \n21 \nand destroy any records derived from the arrests for curfew violations, including but not limited \n22 \nto KIERRA BROWN, including fingerprints, photographs, and other identification and \n23 \ndescriptive information, and all information, and biological samples and information obtained \n24 \n25  from such biological samples collected from such arrestees, and identify all entities and agencies \n26 \nto which such information has been disseminated; and that all such disseminated records be \n27 \ncollected and destroyed.  \n28 \n \n \nNo. 3:21-cv-02881-RS Gaffett v.

Each of the named and unidentified DOE Defendant Officers along with Defendants \n8 \nCITY OF OAKLAND, CHIEF MANHEIMER, CHIEF ARMSTRONG, CHIEF HOLMGREN, \n9 \nCAPTAIN WINGATE, ALAMEDA COUNTY, and SHERIFF AHERN, acted in concert with \n10 \neach other and conspired by concerted action to accomplish an unlawful purpose by unlawful \n11 \nmeans. \n12 \n13  148.  Each of the Defendants took concrete steps to enter into an agreement to unlawfully use \n14 \nexcessive force on Plaintiffs without cause, for the purpose of breaking up the demonstrations \n15 \nand violating Plaintiffsโ First and Fourth Amendment rights. \n16 \n149.  Specifically, the CITY OF OAKLAND adopted policies prohibiting the use of impact \n17 \nmunitions for crowd control because such weapons are inherently indiscriminate and dangerous \n18 \n19  and thus violate demonstrators and bystandersโ constitutional rights by causing serious injuries \n20 \nwithout justification (see ยถยถ 34-37), but CITY OF OAKLAND officials, including but not \n21 \nlimited to CHIEF MANHEIMER, CHIEF ARMSTRONG and CHIEF HOLMGREN, knowing \n22 \nthat SHERIFF AHERN condoned the excessive use of impact munitions on crowds and knowing \n23 \nthe risks thereof, deliberately placed ALAMEDA COUNTY personnel on the front lines at the \n24 \n25  demonstrations and encouraged or allowed them to use these highly dangerous weapons on \n26 \nOakland demonstrators, for the purpose of expediently breaking up the demonstrations with \n27 \nunconstitutional force and violating the demonstrators and bystandersโ First and Fourth \n28 \n \n \nNo. 3:21-cv-02881-RS Gaffett v.

Defendants CITY OF OAKLAND, CHIEF MANHEIMER, CHIEF ARMSTRONG, \n3 \nCHIEF HOLMGREN, ALAMEDA COUNTY, and SHERIFF AHERN, took concrete steps to \n4 \nenter into an agreement with DOE Defendants to retroactively justify and cover up Defendant \n5 \nOfficersโ unwarranted use of excessive force on all Plaintiffs for the purpose of violating \n6 \n7  Plaintiffsโ First and Fourth Amendment rights, as detailed in ยถยถ 83-84 and below. \n8 \n151.  In furtherance of this conspiracy, each of the Defendant Officers committed specific \n9 \novert acts, misusing their police powers for the purpose of violating Plaintiffโs rights. They \n10 \naccomplished this goal by using unwarranted, excessive force on all Plaintiffs, including, but not \n11 \nlimited to, using CS Blast and Stinger grenades to break up lawful demonstrations, shooting \n12 \n13  dangerous impact munitions at protestors without justification, and firing chemical weapons into \n14 \nlawful crowds, as detailed in ยถยถ 42-76.  \n15 \n152.  Defendants CITY OF OAKLAND, CHIEF MANHEIMER, CHIEF ARMSTRONG, \n16 \nCHIEF HOLMGREN, ALAMEDA COUNTY, and SHERIFF AHERN, committed additional \n17 \nspecific overt acts, misusing their powers as high-ranking officials for the purpose of violating \n18 \n19  Plaintiffโs rights. They accomplished this goal by using ACSO officers brought in as mutual aid \n20 \nto suppress the Oakland demonstration with excessive force, using unreasonably dangerous \n21 \nweapons in an indiscriminate manner that violated the plaintiffsโ constitutional rights; by issuing \n22 \nan unconstitutional curfew order without adequate notice and directing Defendant Officers to \n23 \nenforce the order against Plaintiffs. Further, they covered up Defendant Officersโ violations of \n24 \n25  Plaintiffsโ constitutional rights by falsely claiming that the police were under attack by โviolent \n26 \ndisruptorsโ and โprofessional agitatorsโ who were โstacking up bottlesโ and โmaking Molotov \n27 \ncocktailsโ to throw at the police prior to the police use of force; and by falsely claiming that a \n28 \n \n \nNo. 3:21-cv-02881-RS Gaffett v.

Each individual named or unknown Defendant is therefore liable for the violation of \n8 \nPlaintiffsโ rights by any other individual Defendant. \n9 \n154.  As a direct and proximate result of the Defendantsโ conspiracy, Plaintiffs suffered \n10 \ndamages as alleged above. \n11 \n155.

CITY OF OAKLAND | COMPLAINT |  1 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-TSH   Document 1   Filed 04/21/21   Page 2 of 31\n \n1  shown a demonstrable history of violence against Black people and other people of \n2  color in Oakland. This action arises out of protests across the nation in response to the \n3  May 25, 2020, murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis Police Department officers. \n4  The events in Minneapolis, soon after the deaths of Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud \n5  Arbery, brought out millions of people around the country to condemn the deaths of \n6  Black and Brown people by law enforcement in one of the largest social justice \n7  movements in the United States history.1 \n2.  In Oakland, thousands took to the streets on a daily basis starting on May 29, \n8 \n2020, to make their viewpoint known that police brutality and institutionalized racism \n9 \nmust end. The Oakland Police Department (โOPDโ), and its mutual aid partner \n10 \nAlameda County Sheriff Office (โACSOโ), brutally repressed the Oakland \n11 \ndemonstrators, targeting protestors with highly dangerous impact munitions (also \n12 \nknown as Specialty Impact Munitions โSIMโ, Kinetic Impact Projectiles โKIPโ, or \n13 \nProjectile Impact Weapons โPIWโ), explosive grenades and chemical agents, and \n14 \nwrongful arrests.  \n15 \n3.  This misconduct by OPD and ACSO violated the plaintiffsโ constitutional rights \n16 \nand the CITY OF OAKLAND Police Departmentโs own Crowd Control and Crowd \n17 \nManagement Policy. Said Policy was adopted by the CITY OF OAKLAND and OPD \n18 \nas part of the federal court settlement orders in four prior federal lawsuits arising from \n19 \nmass injuries caused by OPDโs and assisting agenciesโ (including ACSOโs) misuse of \n20 \nthese weapons and wrongful mass arrests at demonstrations: Coles / Local 10, ILWU, v. \n21 \nCity of Oakland, Nos. C03-2961 TEH, C03-2962 TEH; Spalding, et al. v. City of \n22 \nOakland, C11-02867 TEH, and Campbell, et al. v.

Plaintiffs will ask \n3  leave to amend this complaint to insert further charging allegations when such facts are \n4  ascertained.  \n5  19.  In doing the acts alleged herein, defendants, and each of them, acted within the \n6  course and scope of their employment.  \n7  20.  In doing the acts and/or omissions alleged herein, defendants, and each of them, \nacted under color of authority and/or under color of law.  \n8 \n21.  In doing the acts and/or omissions alleged herein, defendants, and each of them, \n9 \nacted as the agent, servant, employee and/or in concert with each of said other \n10 \ndefendants.  \n11 \nV. FACTS \n12 \n22.  On May 25, 2020, Minneapolis police officers killed George Floyd, a 46-year-\n13 \nold Black Minneapolis resident. A white police officer knelt on Mr. Floydโs neck for \n14 \nnearly nine minutes while three other officers observed. Mr. Floyd died calling out for \n15 \nhis mother and begging for his life as his death was recorded by passersby. The \n16 \nrecording was shared on multiple media platforms for all the world to witness. \n17 \n23.  In the days and weeks following Mr. Floydโs death, people across the country \n18 \nflooded into streets demanding an end to police brutality against Black people; \n19 \nprotesting the deaths of Mr. Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and countless \n20 \nothers at the hands of police, through vigils, demonstrations, and public gatherings.  \n21 \n24.  These constitutionally protected and essential protests occurred and continue \n22 \namid the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health officials advised people to wear masks \n23 \nand to stay six feet apart to minimize the spread of the virus.  \n24 \n25.  In anticipation of the Oakland protest organized for the evening of May 29, \n25 \n2020, attorneys of record for plaintiffs in the prior crowd control settlements emailed \n26 \nChief Manheimer, Assistant Chief Darren Allison, Deputy Chiefs Leronne Armstrong \n27 \nand Roland Holmgren, Mayor Libby Schaaf, and City Attorney Barbara Parker to \n28 \nremind them of the City of Oaklandโs and the OPDโs legal obligation to comply with \n \n  GAFFETT et al. v. CITY OF OAKLAND | COMPLAINT |  5 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-TSH   Document 1   Filed 04/21/21   Page 6 of 31\n \n1  the OPD Crowd Management and Crowd Control Policy in policing anticipated \n2  demonstrations (Exhibit B, May 29, 2020 Letter).  \n3  26.  Specifically, the May 29, 2020 Letter reminded OPD and City of Oakland \n4  officials that the federal court settlement agreements and orders in Spalding, et al. v. \n5  City of Oakland, C11-02867, and Campbell, et al. v. City of Oakland, C11-05498, \n6  mandate adherence to the Crowd Control Policy, promulgated as OPD Training \n7  Bulletin III-G, in all crowd situations, and require OPD and the City to meet and confer \nwith plaintiffs' counsel before making any material change to TB III-G and associated \n8 \ntraining outlines. (Exhibits A and B.) \n9 \n27.  The May 29, 2020 Letter specifically mentioned that the Policy prohibits certain \n10 \nweapons and types of force in the crowd context and restricts others. Chemical agents \n11 \nand hand thrown pyrotechnic devices may not be used in crowd events without the \n12 \napproval of the Incident Commander, absent exigent circumstances. (Exhibit A, ยถ \n13 \nV.H.4, p. 13, and Exhibit B.) Hand thrown pyrotechnic devices such as CS Blast \n14 \ngrenades may not be thrown directly into a crowd. They must be deployed to explode at \n15 \na safe distance from the crowd to minimize the risk of serious injury. (Exhibit A, ยถ \n16 \nV.H.5, p. 14, and Exhibit B.) The May 29, 2020 Letter also mentioned that these \n17 \ndevices have caused serious burns and permanent hearing loss when used in Oakland \n18 \ncrowds. (Exhibit B.) \n19 \n28.   The May 29, 2020 Letter specified that, according to Oaklandโs own policy, \n20 \nโSpecialty Impact Less-Lethal Munitions (SIM) such as so called โfoamโ or โspongeโ \n21 \nrounds and bean bags may never be used for crowd control or dispersal. In a crowd \n22 \nsituation, the Policy requires a different standard for SIM than on patrol. SIM may only \n23 \nbe used against a specific individual who is engaging in conduct that poses an \n24 \nimmediate threat of loss of life or serious bodily injury to him or herself, officers, or the \n25 \ngeneral public or who is engaging in substantial destruction of property which creates \n26 \nan immediate risk to the lives or safety of other persons. In such instances, SIM shall be \n27 \nused only when other means of arrest are unsafe and when the individual can be \n28 \ntargeted without endangering other crowd members or bystanders, i.e. when the officer \n \n  GAFFETT et al. v. CITY OF OAKLAND | COMPLAINT |  6 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-TSH   Document 1   Filed 04/21/21   Page 7 of 31\n \n1  has a clear shot โ not in the midst of a crowd. (Exhibit A, ยถ VI.F.2, p. 15 and Exhibit \n2  B.)  \n3  29.  An OPD Chiefโs Memorandum to all personnel further clarifies OPDโs policy \n4  regarding use of SIM at crowd events, stating: โThe mere fact that an individual is \n5  picking up, about to throw, or throwing a chemical agent canister previously deployed \n6  by OPD, or other object, does not automatically constitute an immediate threat of loss \n7  of life or serious bodily injury. Members must consider the size and composition of the \nobject and the distance from which it is being thrown.โ (Exhibit C, Chiefโs Nov. 19, \n8 \n2014 Memo.) \n9 \n30.  The Chiefโs Memorandum goes on to clarify that โEven when an individual's \n10 \nconduct does constitute an immediate threat of loss of life or serious bodily injury, \n11 \nDirect Fired SIM shall be used only when other means of arrest are unsafe and when \n12 \nthe individual can be targeted without endangering other crowd members or \n13 \nbystanders. The member using SIM must have a shot the member reasonably believes \n14 \ncan be taken and will only impact the intended target, given consideration of how close \n15 \nthe individual is to others, whether crowd members are moving, and factors that may \n16 \naffect visibility and the accuracy of shot placement, such as chemical agent \n17 \ndeployment.โ (Exhibit C.) \n18 \n31.  The Chiefโs Memorandum also states that โMedical attention shall be provided \n19 \nto any individual struck by SIM. All officers at the scene are responsible for ensuring \n20 \nthat medical attention is available for injured persons and for people affected by \n21 \nchemical agents.โ (Exhibit C.) \n22 \n32.  OPD and the City adopted these restrictions to prevent another tragedy like the \n23 \npermanent brain damage sustained by Scott Olsen, a young veteran who was \n24 \naccidentally struck in the head with a police \"bean bag\" while peacefully standing at a \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n  GAFFETT et al. v. CITY OF OAKLAND | COMPLAINT |  7 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-TSH   Document 1   Filed 04/21/21   Page 8 of 31\n \n1  2011 demonstration. Mr. Olsen received a $4.5 million settlement from the City, but \n2  will never regain full mental function.โ2 \n3  33.  It is well recognized that impact munitions or SIM, also known as KIP or PIW, \n4  can cause injuries ranging from localized contusions to severe organ damage and death. \n5  Data from 1,984 SIM injuries revealed that 3% died and 15.5% were permanently \n6  disabled as a result of being shot with SIM. (Haar RJ, Iacopino V, Ranadive N, et al. \n7  Death, injury and disability from kinetic impact projectiles in crowd-control settings: a \nsystematic review. BMJ Open 2017;7:e018154. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2017-018154; pp. \n8 \n2-5.) \n9 \n34.  Impact munitions caused at least 115 head injuries across the United States \n10 \nduring protests following the killing of George Floyd. (Physicians for Human Rights, \n11 \nShot in the Head, Sept. 14, 2020, \n12 \nhttps://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/29cbf2e87b914dbaabdec2f3d350839e accessed \n13 \nApr. 18, 2021.)  \n14 \n35.  In addition to the provisions mentioned in the May 29, 2020, letter, the Oakland \n15 \nCrowd Control Policy and OPD Training Bulletin III-G govern OPDโs use of mutual \n16 \naid at a demonstration or crowd event. They provide, inter alia, \n17 \nโฆ[T]he [Incident Commander] shall be responsible for ensuring to the \n18 \nextent possible that mutual aid agencies: \n19    \n1.  Are briefed and in agreement with OPDโs Unity of Command structure \n20 \nunder which only OPD Commanders may authorize the use of less \n21 \nlethal munitions for crowd control and dispersal;  \n22  2.  Are briefed on OPDโs policy on prohibited weapons and force; \n3.  Do not bring or use any weapons or force that is prohibited under \n23 \nOPDโs policy;  \n24 \n4.  Are provided a copy of OPDโs Crowd Control Policy and Use of Force \n25  policies;  \n26   \n27   \n28  2Olsen v. City of Oakland, No. C12-6333 SI; https://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/Occupy-\nprotester-wounded-by-Oakland-police-gets-5337743.php. \n \n  GAFFETT et al. v. CITY OF OAKLAND | COMPLAINT |  8 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-TSH   Document 1   Filed 04/21/21   Page 9 of 31\n \n1  5.  Are not assigned to front-line positions or used for crowd intervention, \ncontrol or dispersal unless there is a public safety emergencyโฆ. \n2 \n \n3 \n(Exhibit A, ยถ IX, pp. 20-21.) \n4   \n36.  The above provisions regarding mutual aid were added to the OPD Policy in \n5 \n2013 as part of the aforementioned Spalding and Campbell settlement agreements, after \n6 \nOPD and mutual aid agencies such as ACSO caused many injuries, including at least \n7 \none near-fatal injury, through their use of SIM and hand-thrown pyrotechnic grenades \n8 \nduring the Occupy Oakland demonstrations in 2011. Following these events, the City of \n9 \nOakland had the Frazier Group conduct an independent investigation, and adopted its \n10 \nreport, findings and recommendations. These included, inter alia, that Mutual Aid \n11 \nofficers should not be comingled with OPD officers on the front lines, โeven under \n12 \nextreme conditionsโ, but rather, assigned specific missions to be carried out with \n13 \ndepartment and unit integrity under the direction of OPD. (Frazier Report, June 14, \n14 \n2012, p. 13.) \n15 \nThe May 29 Oakland Demonstration: Jasmine Gaffett \n16 \n37.    At about 8 p.m. on May 29, 2020, demonstrators assembled at Broadway and \n17 \n14th Street in Oakland to express their views regarding the policing system that has \n18 \nsystematically killed Black people and other people of color. Other participants came \n19 \nwith medical supplies, water, and other aid for the demonstrators. And others, including \n20 \njournalists, legal observers, and passersby, simply observed the demonstration. Most of \n21 \nthe demonstrators and observers wore masks and observed social distancing. \n22 \n38.  The defendants would ultimately inflict the same sort of ruthless violence on the \n23 \ndemonstrators that the demonstrators were protesting, and that is prohibited by the OPD \n24 \nCrowd Control and Crowd Management Policy: indiscriminately dispersing tear gas \n25 \nand shooting impact munitions into the crowd, and detonating explosive grenades to \n26  cause panic and disorientation. (See Exhibit A.) \n27 \n28 \n \n  GAFFETT et al. v. CITY OF OAKLAND | COMPLAINT |  9 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-TSH   Document 1   Filed 04/21/21   Page 10 of 31\n \n1  39.  On May 29, 2020, plaintiff Jasmine Gaffett attended the demonstration in \n2  downtown Oakland to express her opposition to racist police violence and support for \n3  the Black Lives Matter movement.  \n4  40.  Some time after 9pm, OPD and ACSO officers, formed a line across Broadway \n5  near 7th Street in which officers from both departments were comingled on the front line \n6  -- exactly as the City of Oaklandโs own Frazier Report had found should not be done.  \n7  41.  Despite the fact that the crowd was largely peaceful, OPD declared the \ndemonstration an unlawful assembly, without lawful basis. At the same time, the OPD \n8 \nand ACSO officers began being using CS Blast grenades and Stinger Grenades, and \n9 \nteargas, such that the crowd did not have a chance to disperse in compliance with the \n10 \norder before being subjected to the chemical agents and volley of small explosives -- \n11 \nwhich is explicitly prohibited by the OPD Policy. (Exhibit A, ยถ V.H.4.e, V.H.5.c, p. \n12 \n14.) They also began shooting impact munitions into the crowd -- which is also \n13 \nexplicitly prohibited by the OPD Policy. (Exhibit A, ยถ VI.F.2, p. 15: โDirect Fired SIM \n14 \nmay never be used indiscriminately against a crowd or group of persons even if some \n15 \nmembers of the crowd or group are violent or disruptive.โ) \n16 \n42.  Plaintiff Gaffett stood near the front of the crowd, closest to the police line, \n17 \nwearing a red bandanna. She chanted and expressed views critical of the police and \n18 \ntheir response to the demonstration. Ms. Gaffett and the rest of the crowd retreated \n19 \nwhen the police began teargassing and shooting, but when the chemical agent cleared, \n20 \nthey came back to continue demonstrating against police violence.  \n21 \n43.  Ms. Gaffett, and others near her, were yelling at the police and telling them that \n22 \nwhat they were doing was wrong, but neither Ms. Gaffett, nor anyone near her, were \n23 \nthrowing anything, physically or verbally threatening the police, or trying to breach the \n24 \npolice line.  \n25 \n44.  Then, without warning, DOE OPD and/or ACSO officers shot Ms. Gaffett twice \n26 \nin the leg, in quick succession, with impact munitions. Ms. Gaffett turned around and \n27 \ntried to run away from the police, but the DOE officers aimed at her and deliberately \n28 \nshot her again and again, while she fled. DOE OPD and/or ACSO defendants shot Ms. \n \n  GAFFETT et al. v. CITY OF OAKLAND | COMPLAINT |  10 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-TSH   Document 1   Filed 04/21/21   Page 11 of 31\n \n1  Gaffett a total of at least twenty times, all over her body. After the first two shots, the \n2  DOE defendants kept shooting Ms. Gaffett from behind as she ran from them.  \n3  45.  Ms. Gaffett never presented any threat whatsoever to any of the OPD or ACSO \n4  officers or to anyone else. There was no justification for the defendants to use any force \n5  on her, and thus the twenty-plus shots with highly dangerous impact munitions were \n6  completely unnecessary and unlawful. \n7  46.  Ms. Gaffett finally escaped further fire by lying on the ground behind a utility \nbox. No OPD or ACSO officer offered her any first aid or summoned medical aid for \n8 \nher despite the fact that the shooting occurred in full view of the entire line of OPD and \n9 \nACSO officers. This, too, violated the OPD Policy. (Exhibit A, ยถ VI.F.2.c, p. 15: โAny \n10 \nperson struck by a round shall be transported to a hospital for observation and any \n11 \nnecessary treatment. Ambulance service, if required, shall be ordered per Department \n12 \nGeneral Order I-4, AMBULANCE SERVICE. First aid, when necessary, shall be \n13 \nadministered per Training Bulletin III-K, \n14 \nFIRST AID.โ) \n15 \n47.  A nurse who was acting as a medic for \n16 \ninjured demonstrators gave Ms. Gaffett aid, \n17 \nand she was eventually able to get home. \n18 \n48.  Ms. Gaffett was covered with large \n19 \nwelts. Among other places, she was hit close \n20 \nto her spleen, kidneys, spine, and groin, and \n21 \nin her right ring finger. \n22 \n49.  The OPD Crowd Control Policy \n23 \nprohibits officers from discharging SIM at a \n24 \nperson's left armpit, spine, kidneys, or groin \n25 \nunless deadly force would be justified. \n26 \n(Exhibit A, ยถ VI.F.2.h, p. 16.) \n27 \n50.  In severe pain, Ms. Gaffett could barely move for two days, requiring assistance \n28 \nfor the most basic functions. She remained laid up at home, in pain, for two weeks, but \n \n  GAFFETT et al. v. CITY OF OAKLAND | COMPLAINT |  11 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-TSH   Document 1   Filed 04/21/21   Page 12 of 31\n \n1  because she had been laid off due to the pandemic and had no health insurance, she did \n2  not immediately seek healthcare.  \n3  51.  When Ms. Gaffett was seen at a clinic two weeks after being shot she still had \n4  visible ecchymosis with hard, swollen lumps, and her right ring finger was found to be \n5  fractured. \n6  The June 1 Oakland Demonstration: Toshua Sears and Kierra Brown \n7 \n52.  On June 1, 2020, young people including many Black and Brown high school \n8 \nstudents and others held a march to protest racist police violence. The march started at \n9 \nOakland Technical High School, and was planned to end with speeches at the Oakland \n10 \nPolice Administration Building. At the onset, the organizers announced that the protest \n11  was peaceful and explicitly called for โno destruction.โ  \n12  53.  Despite the fact that the march was peaceful, Alameda County declared an 8pm \n13  curfew. Also, on June 1, 2020, the City of Oakland declared a local emergency and 8 \n14  p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew.  \n15  54.  On information and belief, defendant LERONNE ARMSTRONG was the Incident \n16  Commander in charge of the OPD and mutual aid officersโ response to the June 1, 2020, \n17  demonstration. \n18  55.  Well prior to the curfew hour, Oakland and Alameda County officers formed lines \n19  blocking the demonstratorsโ path, forcing many of them to stop at Oscar Grant / Frank \n20  Ogawa Plaza rather than at the Police Administration Building.    \n56.  At approximately 5 p.m., after the march had already started, the County of \n21 \nAlameda and the City of Oakland began disseminating the message that a curfew would \n22 \nbegin just three hours later.  \n23 \n57.  A smaller number of demonstrators continued from Oscar Grant Plaza towards the \n24 \nPolice Administration Building. At Washington Street and 8th Street, the demonstrators \n25 \nmet a line of police outfitted in full riot gear. The OPD โkettledโ the group via line \n26 \nformations and by way of their vehicles, blocking opportunities for egress.  \n27 \n58.  Without warning and before the curfew hour, the OPD and ACSO used chemical \n28 \n \n  GAFFETT et al. v. CITY OF OAKLAND | COMPLAINT |  12 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-TSH   Document 1   Filed 04/21/21   Page 13 of 31\n \n1  weapons, threw explosive blast grenades and pyrotechnic devices, and shot impact \n2  munitions into the crowd of confined demonstrators, causing chaos. A dispersal \n3  announcement that many or most of the crowd could not hear or decipher was made a \n4  couple of seconds prior to the bombardment of chemical weapons, impact munitions and \n5  blast grenades.  The police filled the entire block between 8th and 9th St. with a virtual \n6  wall of CS gas and smoke that impeded, rather than aided the demonstrators in dispersing \n7  as people had difficult seeing and breathing, and impacted neighboring residents and \nbusiness in this dense urban area of downtown Oakland. \n8 \n59.  Plaintiffs KIERRA BROWN and TOSHUA SEARS each attended the June 1, \n9 \n2020, march to protest racist police violence. Mr. Sears, who is Black, carried a sign, โAll \n10 \nlives matter even oursโ.  \n11 \n60.  TOSHUA SEARS was in the area of 8th and Broadway, when well before 8pm, \n12 \nDOE OAKLAND Police and ALAMEDA COUNTY Sheriff officers blocked egress on \n13 \nthree sides and at about 7:40pm, without warning, DOE OAKLAND and ALAMEDA \n14 \nCOUNTY officers threw and shot chemical weapons, explosive grenades and SIM into \n15 \nthe crowd. The crowd had been peaceful, and Mr. Sears did not hear the police give any \n16 \nwarnings, orders or announcements, nor did he see any crowd activity that would justify \n17 \nthe sudden use of force. Mr. Sears began to leave, when suddenly, he felt an enormous \n18 \nimpact as a DOE OAKLAND Police or ALAMEDA COUNTY Sheriff officer shot him \n19 \nwith an impact projectile in the right hip / buttock area.  \n20 \n61.  At first, Mr. Sears did not know if he had been shot with a live bullet or a so-called \n21 \nless lethal impact munition. It was terrifying. Chemical agent burned Mr. Searsโ eyes, \n22 \nmouth and nose. It was hard to see and breathe. He hobbled away as best he could and \n23 \ncalled his wife to pick him up. \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n  GAFFETT et al. v. CITY OF OAKLAND | COMPLAINT |  13 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-TSH   Document 1   Filed 04/21/21   Page 14 of 31\n \n1  62.  At home, Mr. Sears washed his face and \n2  flushed his eyes out but his eyes swelled and \n3  remained swollen for days. His vision was \n4  affected as a result of chemical conjunctivitis \n5  caused by his exposure to the chemical agent. \n6  His hip remained extremely painful and \n7  developed a large, hard, swollen lump. It was \nhard to read or walk for some time. He could not \n8 \nsleep on his side. The lump and pain persisted \n9 \nfor months.  \n10 \n63.  Mr. Sears never presented any threat \n11 \nwhatsoever to any of the OPD or ACSO \n12 \nofficers or to anyone else. There was no \n13 \njustification for the defendants to use any force on him, and thus both the shot and \n14 \nteargas were completely unnecessary and unlawful. \n15 \n64.  Many other demonstrators were shot in the back as they were fleeing the \n16 \nshooting, explosive grenades and chemical weapons, only to be impeded by police lines \n17 \nkettling them from all directions.  \n18 \n65.  Public health and other medical experts have condemned the use of tear gas and \n19 \nother respiratory irritants on protesters as increasing the risk for COVID-19 by making \n20 \nthe respiratory tract more susceptible to infection, exacerbating existing inflammation, \n21 \nand inducing coughing, as well as by forcing those exposed to remove masks that have \n22 \nbeen contaminated.  \n23 \n66.  KIERRA BROWN was not at 8th and Broadway when the police used the \n24 \nchemical weapons, but went to 14th and Broadway after the march to help wash peopleโs \n25 \neyes who had been affected by the chemical agent. While Ms. Brown was doing this, the \n26 \npolice approached and pushed the crowd further up Broadway. Ms. Brown was running \n27 \ntoward 15th Street, which was what it seemed the police wanted the crowd to do, when a \n28 \nDOE OAKLAND or ALAMEDA COUNTY Sheriff officer shot her in the back of her \n \n  GAFFETT et al. v. CITY OF OAKLAND | COMPLAINT |  14 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-TSH   Document 1   Filed 04/21/21   Page 15 of 31\n \n1  right leg.  \n2  67.  The OAKLAND and ALAMEDA COUNTY officers then trapped Ms. Brown and \n3  others between their lines and detained them, zip tying Ms. Brown and the othersโ hands. \n4  The kettling occurred before 8pm. \n5  68.  DOE OAKLAND Police officers took Ms. Brown to a parking garage for \n6  processing before ultimately releasing her with a citation. She was never charged with \n7  any crime.  \n69.  Ms. Brown never presented any threat whatsoever to any of the OPD or ACSO \n8 \nofficers or to anyone else. There was no justification for the defendants to use any force \n9 \non her, and thus shooting her with highly dangerous SIM as she attempted to flee in \n10 \nresponse to the police action was completely unnecessary and unlawful. \n11 \n70.  There was no probable cause to arrest Ms. Brown. \n12 \n71.  That night, Ms. Brownโs leg swelled and became numb from hip to ankle. She \n13 \nexperienced uncomfortable tingling, and her leg developed a hard, swollen lump.  \n14 \n72.  Ms. Brown has never regained full sensation in her right leg and is at risk of losing \n15 \nmobility in her foot as a result of being shot by the DOE OPD or ACSO officer. \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n \n28  73.  Ms. Gaffett, Ms. Brown and Mr. Sears wish to continue to express their views on \n \n  GAFFETT et al. v. CITY OF OAKLAND | COMPLAINT |  15 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-TSH   Document 1   Filed 04/21/21   Page 16 of 31\n \n1  police brutality and institutionalized racism by participating in public protests on the \n2  streets of Oakland, but are afraid that they will again be subjected to unlawful law \n3  enforcement violence and wrongful arrests.  \n4  74.  Defendantsโ actions on May 29 and June 1 violated every provision of the CITY \n5  OF OAKLANDโs Crowd Management and Crowd Control Policy that the attorneys had \n6  warned about in their May 29 letter, and more. Oaklandโs own policy and the law are \n7  clear that verbal criticism or abuse of officers is not grounds for arrest or use of force. \nAnd while police may use force to defend themselves against an individual, it is both \n8 \nillegal and a violation of Oaklandโs policy to use impact munitions indiscriminately \n9 \nagainst a crowd. \n10 \n75.   Defendantsโ actions on May 29 and June 1 violated the Policyโs provisions which \n11 \nprohibit impact munitions and explosive grenades from being fired into crowds, and \n12 \nallow impact munitions to be used only against โa specific individual who is engaging in \n13 \nconduct that poses an immediate threat of loss of life or serious bodily injury to him or \n14 \nherself, officers, or the general public or who is engaging in substantial destruction of \n15 \nproperty which creates an immediate risk to the lives or safety of other personsโ (Ex. A, ยถ \n16 \nVI.F.2.a, p. 15); provisions limiting the use of chemical weapons (Ex. A, ยถยถ V.H.4, \n17 \nV.H.5, pp. 13-14); and the requirement that OPD ensure mutual aid agencies do not bring \n18 \nor use any weapons or force that is prohibited under this policy, and not be assigned to \n19 \nfront-line positions unless there is a public safety emergency (Ex. A, ยถ IX, p. 20). ACSO \n20 \nbrought and used prohibited weapons including Stinger Grenades at the May 29 and June \n21 \n1 events, violating Oaklandโs Policy, ยถ IX.3, and ACSO officers, including the DOE \n22 \nACSO defendants, were comingled with OPD in front-line positions, violating ยถ IX.5 and \n23 \nthe City of Oaklandโs Frazier Report findings.  \n24 \n76.  On May 29 and June 1, defendants also violated the Crowd Control Policy \n25 \nprovision providing that โAny person struck by a round shall be transported to a hospital \n26 \nfor observation and any necessary treatment.โ (Exhibit A, ยถ VI.F.2.c, p. 15.) None of the \n27 \nplaintiffs were offered medical aid by OPD or City of Oakland personnel. \n28 \n77.  Following the May 29 โ June 1 demonstrations, CITY OF OAKLAND officials \n \n  GAFFETT et al. v. CITY OF OAKLAND | COMPLAINT |  16 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-TSH   Document 1   Filed 04/21/21   Page 17 of 31\n \n1  made a number of false and misleading statements to the public and media about the \n2  demonstrations and the actions of OAKLAND police officers and mutual aid agencies, \n3  fabricating and/or exaggerating reports of property destruction and supposed aggression \n4  by demonstrators while minimizing the police violence and injuries caused by the police.  \n5  78.  On being confronted with a photograph of Ms. Gaffettโs injuries, which were \n6  inflicted by defendants on May 29, CITY OF OAKLAND officials stated falsely and \n7  publicly that the photograph was a hoax and depicted someone in Texas.  \n79.  Defendantsโ acts were willful, wanton, malicious, and oppressive, and done with \n8 \nconscious disregard and deliberate indifference for plaintiffโs rights and safety, justifying \n9 \nan award of punitive damages.  \n10 \n80.  As a direct and proximate result of the conduct of defendants described herein, \n11 \nplaintiffs have been denied their constitutional, statutory and legal rights as stated below, \n12 \nand have suffered general and special damages, including but not limited to, pain, \n13 \nsuffering, humiliation, emotional distress, fear, anxiety, disabilities, medical and related \n14 \nexpenses, and other damages in amounts according to proof.  \n15 \n81.   Plaintiffs have incurred, and will continue to incur, attorneysโ fees and costs in \n16 \namounts to be determined according to proof. \n17 \nVII. MONELL AND SUPERVISORY LIABILITY ALLEGATIONS \n18 \n82.  The constitutional violations alleged herein were the proximate result of decisions, \n19 \norders, acts and omissions of the CITY OF OAKLANDโS authorized policymakers \n20 \nincluding but not limited to defendant MANHEIMER; and ALAMEDA COUNTYโs \n21 \npolicymakers including but not limited to defendant AHERN. \n22 \n83.  This included the decision for ALAMEDA COUNTY and the CITY OF \n23 \nOAKLAND to declare a curfew on June 1, which was unconstitutional as further \n24 \nexplained below, and used as a pretext for wrongful arrests of Ms. BROWN and others. \n25 \n84.  MANHEIMER, ARMSTRONG, AHERN, and DOE City officials and County \n26 \nofficials caused the CITY OF OAKLAND police officersโ and ALAMEDA COUNTY \n27 \nSheriffโs officersโ constitutional violations complained of herein by failing to provide \n28 \nadequate policies, training, supervision, and command of their officers assigned to the \n \n  GAFFETT et al. v. CITY OF OAKLAND | COMPLAINT |  17 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-TSH   Document 1   Filed 04/21/21   Page 18 of 31\n \n1  May 29- June 1, 2020, demonstrations to stop the officers from using excessive force, \n2  making wrongful arrests, and depriving plaintiff and class members of their First \n3  Amendment rights; and by approving the use of impact munitions, explosive grenades \n4  and pyrotechnic devices, and chemical weapons at the demonstrations, which resulted in \n5  such weapons being used in an unconstitutional, indiscriminate, unnecessary, and \n6  excessive manner. MANHEIMER, ARMSTRONG, AHERN, and DOE CITY OF \n7  OAKLAND and ALAMEDA COUNTY officials did this despite being well aware of the \nconstitutional limitations on the use of force and arrests at demonstrations and of lawful \n8 \ncrowd management and crowd control tactics, as set forth in the CITY OF OAKLANDโs \n9 \nown Crowd Management and Crowd Control Policy.  \n10 \n85.  Plaintiffs further allege that the constitutional violations alleged herein were the \n11 \nproximate result of a repeated course of conduct by members of the OPD and ACSO \n12 \ntantamount to a custom, policy, pattern or repeated practice of condoning, ratifying \n13 \nand/or tacitly encouraging the abuse of police authority, and disregard for the \n14 \nconstitutional rights of citizens, including the rights of the plaintiffs and class members. \n15 \n86.  Plaintiffs are further informed and believe and thereon allege that the \n16 \nconstitutional violations alleged herein were the proximate result of a custom, policy, \n17 \npattern or practice of deliberate indifference by defendants CITY OF OAKLAND and \n18 \nALAMEDA COUNTY to the repeated violations of the constitutional rights of citizens \n19 \nby defendantsโ law enforcement officers, which have included, but are not limited to, the \n20 \nrepeated use of excessive force, and the repeated failure to properly and/or adequately \n21 \ntrain, supervise and/or discipline officers with respect to the use of excessive force, \n22 \nconstitutional limitations on the use of force; the repeated failure by CITY OF \n23 \nOAKLAND and ALAMEDA COUNTYโs high ranking officials, OPD and ACSO \n24 \nmanagers and/or supervisors to hold officers accountable for violating the rights of \n25 \ncitizens; and/or other customs, policies and/or practices subject to continuing discovery. \n26 \n87.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that the constitutional violations alleged herein, \n27 \nto the extent they involved use of force by ALAMEDA COUNTY officers, were the \n28 \nproximate result of a policy, pattern and practice by CITY OF OAKLAND and its high \n \n  GAFFETT et al. v. CITY OF OAKLAND | COMPLAINT |  18 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-TSH   Document 1   Filed 04/21/21   Page 19 of 31\n \n1  ranking police officials of allowing ALAMEDA COUNTY officers assisting OAKLAND \n2  with mutual aid to violate OAKLANDโs Crowd Control Policy by bringing weapons to \n3  Oakland that are prohibited by the Policy, and using impact munitions, Stinger grenades \n4  and other force in a manner specifically prohibited by Oaklandโs Policy, in defiance of \n5  the Spalding and Campbell federal court settlement orders; and a policy, pattern and \n6  practice by ALAMEDA COUNTY and its Sheriff of refusing to follow OAKLANDโs \n7  Crowd Control Policy while providing mutual aid to the CITY OF OAKLAND. \n88.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that defendants MANHEIMER, \n8 \nARMSTRONG, AHERN, and DOE defendants, and/or each of them, caused the \n9 \nviolation of the plaintiffsโ constitutional rights as a result of their supervisory \n10 \nmalfeasance and/or deliberate indifference to the need for more or different training, \n11 \nsupervision and/or discipline of the CITY OF OAKLAND Police and ALAMEDA \n12 \nCOUNTY Sheriffโs Office personnel assigned to the subject incident, to prevent the \n13 \nforeseeable violation of plaintiffsโ constitutional rights, as further discussed above. \n14 \nVIII. CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n15 \n89.  Plaintiffs seek class certification pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a), and Fed.R.Civ.P. \n16 \n23(b)(2), to pursue claims for injunctive and declaratory relief on behalf of themselves \n17 \nand all persons similarly situated.   \n18 \n90.  The class is defined as all persons who have in the past participated, presently are \n19 \nparticipating, or may in the future participate in, or be present at, demonstrations and \n20 \ncrowd events within the City of Oakland in the exercise of their rights of free speech, \n21 \nassembly, association, petition, and of the press. \n22 \n91.  This case satisfies the prerequisites of a Rule 23 class action. The class is so \n23 \nnumerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. The class consists of hundreds or \n24 \neven thousands of people. \n25 \n92.  There are questions of law and fact common to the class, in that the named \n26 \nplaintiffs claim that defendantsโ unlawful use of force and threats of force at the \n27 \ndemonstrations described herein, were based on OPD and ACSO policies and orders that \n28 \nwere unlawful and chilled their First Amendment rights. \n \n  GAFFETT et al. v. CITY OF OAKLAND | COMPLAINT |  19 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-TSH   Document 1   Filed 04/21/21   Page 20 of 31\n \n1  93.  The questions of law and/or fact which predominate over any question affecting \n2  only individual class members include whether defendants improperly declared an \n3  unlawful assembly depriving peaceful participants of their First Amendment rights, \n4  whether defendants used excessive force against peaceful participants, whether \n5  defendants' motivation was to deprive participants of their First Amendment rights, and \n6  whether defendants engaged in racial, content and viewpoint-discrimination. \n7  94.  By ordering and allowing officers to use unjustified force on the crowd at the \ndemonstrations, and failing to implement policies prohibiting such use of excessive force \n8 \nand requiring OPD to brief mutual aid agencies on the Crowd Control and Crowd \n9 \nManagement Policy, ensure they do not bring or use any weapons or force that is \n10 \nprohibited under this policy, and not assign mutual aid to front-line positions unless there \n11 \nis a public safety emergency, defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to \n12 \nthe class, so that injunctive and declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a \n13 \nwhole.  \n14 \n95.  The questions of law and fact common to the classes, which are outlined above, \n15 \npredominate over any questions affecting only individual members.  \n16 \n96.  The claims of the named plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the class in that the \n17 \nnamed plaintiffs and class members claim that their First Amendment rights have been \n18 \nchilled by the same misconduct of defendants and seek protection to bar the repeat of \n19 \nthose violations in the future.  \n20 \n97.  The class representatives will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \n21 \nclass because they were subject to the unlawful law enforcement conduct complained of \n22 \nherein, and have no interests antagonistic to the class.  \n23 \n98.  The class representatives will fairly and adequately represent the common class \n24 \ninterest. The class representatives have a strong interest in achieving the relief requested \n25 \nin this Complaint, they have no conflicts with members of the plaintiff class, and they \n26 \nwill fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.  \n27 \n99.  The class representatives are represented by counsel who are well-experienced in \n28 \nfederal civil rights class action litigation and are familiar with the issues in this case. \n \n  GAFFETT et al. v. CITY OF OAKLAND | COMPLAINT |  20 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-TSH   Document 1   Filed 04/21/21   Page 21 of 31\n \n1  100.  Counsel for the class representatives know of no conflicts among or between \n2  members of the class, the named plaintiffs, or the attorneys in this action.  \n3  101.  In accordance with FRCP Rule 23(b)(1)(A), the prosecution of separate actions by \n4  individual members of the class would create a risk of inconsistent or incompatible \n5  standards of conduct for the defendants, thereby making a class action the superior \n6  method of adjudicating the controversy.  \n7  102.  In accordance with FRCP Rule 23(b)(1)(B), prosecutions of separate actions by \nindividual members of the classes would create a risk of adjudications with respect to \n8 \nindividual members of the class which would, as a practical matter, substantially impair \n9 \nor impede the interests of the other members of the class to protect their interests.  \n10 \n103.  In accordance with FRCP Rule 23(b)(2), defendants have acted on grounds \n11 \ngenerally applicable to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding \n12 \ndeclaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole. \n13 \nIX. CLAIMS FOR RELIEF  \n14 \n15  COUNT ONE โ INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n(First, Fourth And Fourteenth Amendments, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983; California \n16 \nConstitution Articles 1 ยงยง 2, 3, 7, 13; Cal. Penal Code \n17 \nยง 835.5; Civil Code ยง 52.1; and Civil Code ยง 815.6) \n18   \n104.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate herein by reference the preceding paragraphs of \n19 \nthis Complaint. \n20 \n105.  The Defendants engaged in repeated, widespread violations of law, as outlined \n21 \nabove, over the course of at least several nights, using excessive force against hundreds if \n22 \nnot thousands of protestors in retaliation for their protected First Amendment activity; \n23 \nimposing a curfew without accommodating the right to peaceable assembly and protest; \n24 \ndeclaring unlawful assemblies without adequate sound amplification and without \n25 \nproviding adequate notice, means and opportunity to disperse before taking aggressive \n26 \npolice action including the use of highly dangerous impact munitions /  SIM, chemical \n27 \nweapons and explosive grenades; hitting large numbers of protestors with impact \n28 \nmunitions / SIM, grenades, and using chemical weapons on them, all with unreasonable \n \n  GAFFETT et al. v. CITY OF OAKLAND | COMPLAINT |  21 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-TSH   Document 1   Filed 04/21/21   Page 22 of 31\n \n1  and excessive force; failing to provide medical aid or decontamination to persons \n2  defendants shot and/or teargassed; and unlawfully arresting and detaining dozens of \n3  people. \n4  106.  The CITY OF OAKLAND, through MANHEIMER, ARMSTRONG and the \n5  OPD, and ALAMEDA COUNTY, through AHERN and the ACSO, have failed to train \n6  their officers in the constitutional responses to demonstrations as revealed by the above \n7  allegations. \n107.   Without intervention by this Court, the plaintiffs and class members, who have \n8 \nparticipated, observed or documented protest activities and wish to do so in the future, \n9 \nparticularly related to police violence and racial justice, are at risk of having their rights \n10 \nviolated in the future due to the defendantsโ demonstrated pattern of constitutional \n11 \nviolations. The plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law to protect the future lawful \n12 \nexercise of their constitutional rights, and, without action by this court, will suffer \n13 \nirreparable injury, thereby entitling them to injunctive and declaratory relief. \n14 \n108.  The Defendants have acted and refused to act on grounds generally applicable to \n15 \nthe putative class. Injunctive and declaratory relief for the class as a whole is appropriate. \n16 \n109.  Defendantsโ policies, practices, customs, conduct and acts alleged herein have \n17 \nresulted and will continue to result in irreparable injury to the plaintiffs, including but not \n18 \nlimited to violations of their constitutional and statutory rights. Plaintiffs have no plain, \n19 \nadequate or complete remedy at law to address the wrongs described herein. Plaintiffs \n20 \nintend in the future to exercise their constitutional rights of freedom of speech and \n21 \nassociation by engaging in demonstrations, observation and documentation of \n22 \ndemonstrations and police actions, and other expressive activities in the City of Oakland. \n23 \nDefendantsโ conduct described herein has created fear, anxiety and uncertainty among \n24 \nplaintiffs with respect to their exercise now and in the future of these constitutional \n25 \nrights. \n26 \n110.  Specifically, plaintiffs are concerned that if they participate in, observe or \n27 \ndocument protest activities in the City of Oakland they will again be subjected to \n28 \nunreasonable and excessive force by OPD and ACSO. \n \n  GAFFETT et al. v. CITY OF OAKLAND | COMPLAINT |  22 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-TSH   Document 1   Filed 04/21/21   Page 23 of 31\n \n1  111.  Plaintiffs are concerned that, when they are engaged in protest activities, \n2  Defendants will impose curfews without accommodating or attempting to accommodate \n3  First Amendment rights; will not provide adequate notice of such curfews or in the event \n4  unlawful assemblies are declared; will not provide adequate means and opportunity to \n5  disperse; and will again employ indiscriminate, racially discriminatory, unreasonable or \n6  excessive force, injuring and terrifying protestors. \n7  112.  Plaintiffs are also concerned that that if they participate in, observe or document \nprotest activities in the City of Oakland they will be wrongfully detained and arrested by \n8 \nmembers of OPD and/or ACSO. \n9 \n113.  Plaintiffs therefore seek injunctive relief from this court to ensure that plaintiffs \n10 \nand persons similarly situated will not suffer violations of their rights from defendantsโ \n11 \nillegal and unconstitutional policies, customs, and practices described herein. \n12 \n114.  Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief in the form of an order prohibiting OPD and ACSO \n13 \nfrom using chemical weapons, explosive grenades, and impact munitions in crowds. \n14 \n115.  Plaintiffs also seek injunctive relief in the form of an order requiring that \n15 \ndefendants seal and destroy and records derived from the arrests for curfew violations, \n16 \nincluding but not limited to KIERRA BROWN, including fingerprints, photographs, and \n17 \nother identification and descriptive information, and all information, and biological \n18 \nsamples and information obtained from such biological samples collected from such \n19 \narrestees, and identify all entities and agencies to which such information has been \n20 \ndisseminated; and that all such disseminated records be collected and destroyed.  \n21 \nCOUNT TWO โ DECLARATORY RELIEF \n22 \n116.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs of this \n23 \nComplaint. \n24 \n117.  An actual controversy exists between plaintiffs and defendants in that plaintiffs \n25 \ncontend that the policies, practices and conduct of defendants alleged herein are unlawful \n26 \nand unconstitutional, whereas plaintiffs are informed and believe that defendants contend \n27 \nthat said policies, practices and conduct are lawful and constitutional. Plaintiffs therefore \n28 \nseek a declaration of rights with respect to this controversy pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง \n \n  GAFFETT et al. v. CITY OF OAKLAND | COMPLAINT |  23 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02881-TSH   Document 1   Filed 04/21/21   Page 24 of 31\n \n1  2201-2202. \n2  COUNT THREE โ 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \n3  VIOLATION OF FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS \n4  118.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs of this \n5  Complaint. \n6  119.  Plaintiffsโ association with the anti-police violence/ racial justice demonstrations \n7  and observation and/or documentation of the police response were substantial and \nmotivating factors for the defendants use of excessive force on all of the plaintiffs, and in \n8 \nthe case of KIERRA BROWN and class members, arrest them. The acts and/or omissions \n9 \nof the defendants, and each of them, individually and/or while acting in concert with one \n10 \nanother, chilled the plaintiffsโ rights to freedom of speech, expression and association, \n11 \nunder the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n12 \n120.  The curfew order also violated and chilled the plaintiffsโ First Amendment rights. \n13 \n121.  As a result of Defendantsโ wrongful conduct, the plaintiffs suffered damages as \n14 \nalleged above. \n15 \n122.  As a result of Defendantsโ wrongful conduct, and the potential that such conduct \n16 \nwill recur, the class is entitled to relief from the potential that such violations will recur.  \n17 \n123.  Wherefore, the plaintiffs pray for relief as hereinafter set forth. \n18 \nCOUNT FOUR - 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \n19 \nEXCESSIVE FORCE โ U.S. Const., 4th and 14th Amds. \n20 \n124.

Each of the named and unidentified Defendant Officers along with Defendants \n11 \nCITY OF OAKLAND, CHIEF MANHEIMER, CHIEF ARMSTRONG, ALAMEDA \n12 \nCOUNTY, and SHERIFF AHERN, acted in concert with each other and conspired by \n13 \nconcerted action to accomplish an unlawful purpose by unlawful means. \n14 \n141.  Each of the Defendants took concrete steps to enter into an agreement to \n15 \nunlawfully use excessive force on all Plaintiffs without notice or cause, and to detain and \n16 \narrest certain Plaintiffs, knowing they lacked reasonable suspicion and/or probable cause \n17 \nto do so, and for the purpose of violating Plaintiffsโ First, Fourth, and Fourteenth \n18 \nAmendment rights. \n19 \n142.

In furtherance of this conspiracy, each of the Defendant Officers committed \n26 \nspecific overt acts, misusing their police powers for the purpose of violating Plaintiffโs \n27 \nrights. They accomplished this goal by using unwarranted, excessive force on all \n28 \nPlaintiffs, including, but not limited to, using CS Blast and Stinger grenades to break up \n \n  GAFFETT et al. v.

They accomplished this goal by using ACSO officers brought \nin as mutual aid to police the Oakland demonstration and violate the OPD Crowd Control \n8 \nand Crowd Management Policy by using prohibited weapons and using force in a \n9 \nprohibited manner that violated the plaintiffsโ constitutional rights; by issuing an \n10 \nunconstitutional curfew order without adequate notice and directing Defendant Officers \n11 \nto enforce the order against Plaintiffs. Further, they covered up Defendant Officersโ \n12 \nconstitutional violations of Plaintiffsโ rights by falsely claiming that the police were \n13 \nunder attack by โviolent disruptorsโ and โprofessional agitatorsโ who were โstacking up \n14 \nbottlesโ and โmaking Molotov cocktailsโ to throw at the police prior to the police use of \n15 \nforce; and by falsely claiming that a photograph depicting plaintiff GAFFETTโs injuries \n16 \nwas a hoax and depicted someone in Texas. \n17 \n145.  Each individual named and unknown Defendant is therefore liable for the \n18 \nviolation of Plaintiffsโ rights the by any other individual Defendant. \n19 \n146.
