    "summary": "<p>On August 22, 2017, a group of protesters gathered outside the Phoenix Convention Center to protest a speech by President Donald Trump and voice disagreement with President Trump&rsquo;s anti-immigrant policies and views. Over one year later, on September 4, 2018, five individuals who attended the protest and two Arizona nonprofits (&ldquo;the plaintiffs&rdquo;) brought this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona against the City of Phoenix, the Phoenix Chief of Police, and nine other officers with the Phoenix Police Department (PPD) (&ldquo;the defendants&rdquo;) alleging that the defendants violated the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, the plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU of Arizona and private counsel, claimed that the defendants carried out an unannounced attack on the peaceful protesters on the night of August 22, 2017, using pepper spray, gas, pepper bullets, and flash-bang canisters. As such, the plaintiffs requested that the court grant them declaratory relief, a preliminary and permanent injunction prohibiting the defendants from engaging in any of the unconstitutional behaviors alleged in the complaint, monetary damage, and attorney&rsquo;s fees.</p>\r\n<p>In their complaint, the plaintiffs sought to represent themselves and also all persons who were present at the protest on August 22, 2017, who did not engage in any conduct justifying the defendants&rsquo; use of force against them. After over a year of litigation, Judge John J Tuchi granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion to certify the class on September 30, 2019. The court certified the plaintiffs&rsquo; proposed subclass as to those individuals injured by gas and chemical agents, but denied certification as to those individuals injured by projectiles. 2019 WL 4849613.</p>\r\n<p>After conducting discovery for another six months, the plaintiffs stipulated on May 6, 2020, to the dismissal from the case of three PPD officers named in the complaint as defendants. Shortly after, on May 8, 2020, both parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Two years later, on February 7, 2022, Judge Tuchi denied the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for summary judgment, granted the defendants&rsquo; motion for summary judgment as to the plaintiffs&rsquo; class-wide claims, and granted in part and denied in part the defendants&rsquo; motion as to the plaintiffs&rsquo; individual claims. The court found both that the defendants did not seize the plaintiffs under the Fourth Amendment by deploying gas and chemical agents into the crowd of protesters, and that the defendants did not act with the purpose to harm the class members unrelated to legitimate law enforcement objectives or with the purpose to chill class members&rsquo; First Amendment rights. Accordingly, Judge Tuchi concluded that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity for their actions with respect to the class members. 2022 WL 357351</p>\r\n<p>Following Judge Tuchi&rsquo;s February 7, 2022 order, the court set for trial the Fourth Amendment Excessive Force claims of three individual plaintiffs.</p>\r\n<p>In response to the court&rsquo;s decision, both the plaintiffs and defendants appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. As of June 5, 2022, these appeals are still pending and this case is ongoing.</p>",

The Court heard oral argument on the Motion on June 12, 2019. \n17  (Docs. 160, 165.) In this Order, the Court will also resolve Defendantsโ Motion for Leave \n18  to Supplement the Class Certification Record (Doc. 138), Motion to File Exhibit under Seal \n19  (Doc. 141), and Motion for Leave to File a Sur-Reply (Doc. 144), as well as Plaintiffsโ \n20  Motion to Strike Portions of Defendantsโ Supplements or Alternatively for Leave to \n21  Respond to Defendantsโ Filings (Doc. 146). \n22  I.  BACKGROUND \n23  On  August  22,  2017,  President  Donald  Trump  held  a  rally  at  the  Phoenix \n24  Convention Center, and approximately 6,000 demonstratorsโboth pro-Trump and anti-\n25  Trumpโgathered  outside  the  Convention  Center.1  The  Phoenix  Police  Department \n26 \n                                              \n1 The background facts summarized here are a synthesis of the partiesโ proffered video \n27 \nevidence  (Doc.  90  Exs.  29โ39;  Resp.  Exs.  42โ64),  testimony,  and  reports.  Certain \ndiscrepancies exist within this evidence, but the Court is satisfied that its synthesis is \n28 \nsufficiently accurate for the purpose of resolving Plaintiffsโ Amended Motion for Class \nCertification. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n1  (โPPDโ) had about a weekโs advance notice of the rally, during which it made preparations \n2  to try to ensure the safety of the downtown area during the expected demonstrations. The \n3  preparations  included  setting  up  a  โfree  speech  zoneโ  designated  for  anti-Trump \n4  demonstrators on the north side of the Convention Center, across Monroe Street. The free \n5  speech zone was bordered by 2nd Street to the west, 3rd Street to the east, and Monroe \n6  Street to the south, and demarcated by a three-foot high pedestrian fence. PPD anticipated \n7  that certain groups of demonstrators would be present, including  Antifaโa national, \n8  militant political protest movement opposing fascism and right-wing ideology  whose \n9  groups  had  disrupted  several  other  demonstrations  in  the  weeks  preceding  President \n10  Trumpโs Phoenix visitโas well as Plaintiff Puenteโa Phoenix grassroots organization \n11  representing  migrant  communities  through  lobbying,  advocacy,  and  activismโand \n12  Plaintiff Poder in Action (โPoderโ)โa Phoenix grassroots organization with a mission of \n13  empowering victims of injustice through leadership development, civic engagement, and \n14  policy advocacy. \n15    In  a  Presidential  Visit  After-Action  Report  (Doc.  101-3  at  2โ35,  Bates  Nos. \n16  COP014832โ014865, โPPD Reportโ), Defendant PPD Chief Jeri Williams stated that, on \n17  the day of the rally, PPD deployed approximately 985 officers around the Convention \n18  Center. According to the report, large crowds of demonstrators began arriving by 11:00 a.m. \n19  and, although PPD officers observed minor altercations and a few water bottles being \n20  thrown at rally attendees lining up to enter the Convention Center, the demonstrations \n21  proceeded generally without incident during the day. \n22  The rally inside the Convention Center began at 6:30 p.m. At approximately 8:15 \n23  p.m., after PPD officers around 2nd Street and Monroe reported that water bottles were \n24  being thrown at them, PPD used a Long Range Acoustic Device (โLRADโ) to make \n25  announcements instructing individuals to stop throwing objects. At 8:23 p.m., 15 to 20 \n26  individuals PPD had identified as Antifa put up large banners near the fence along Monroe, \n27  which concealed their activities from PPD officers. PPD deployed Tactical Response Unit \n28  (โTRUโ) personnel, including grenadiers trained in the deployment of chemical munitions, \n \n- 2 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  in the area where Antifa had gathered. Just after 8:32 p.m., President Trump began to leave \n2  the rally, and PPD officers observed Antifa pushing or shaking the fence.  \n3    PPD deployed its first munition in front of Antifa just before 8:33 p.m. in the form \n4  of pepper balls on the ground, which cleared most individuals from the immediate vicinity. \n5  Thereafter, PPD officers reported that rocks and bottles were being thrown and, at 8:34, \n6  officers reported that canisters of some kind of tear gas were thrown at them. At that point, \n7  PPD officers donned gas masks and, at 8:35, the grenadiers deployed inert smoke bombs. \n8  Large numbers of demonstrators began to clear the area.  \n9  After officers noted that some smoke canisters were being kicked back and a spear-\n10  like object and an incendiary device were thrown at them, the grenadiers deployed CS \n11  gasโa type of tear gasโin what they perceived to be a focused location to target specific \n12  individuals. Plaintiff Gonzalez Goodman alleges she inhaled gas. The grenadiers also \n13  deployed aerial flash bangs intended to act as auditory warnings. Demonstrators began to \n14  run away and, by 8:39, the area where individuals had been throwing projectiles was mostly \n15  empty, although demonstrators remained to the east and west of the area. \n16    From 8:36 to 8:45, PPD used additional smoke cannisters and pepper balls to clear \n17  an area so that officers could form lines to begin dispersing the crowd. Helicopters from \n18  the PPD Air Unit began arriving at 8:40, and they started making announcements directing \n19  the crowd to disperse at 8:52. In this time period, the grenadiers deployed smoke canisters, \n20  pepper balls, and OC bulletsโbullets filled with pepper sprayโone of which hit Plaintiff \n21  Guillen. Lines of PPD officers with riot shields began marching to move the crowd at 8:56. \n22  At some point between 8:42 and 8:47, PPD made the determination that the crowd was \n23  unlawfully assembled, and at 9:02, an official unlawful assembly announcement was made \n24  via a public address system from a marked police vehicle on the ground. \n25    Thereafter, the grenadiers deployed munitions in the form of pepper balls, OC \n26  bullets, and CS gas canisters at anyone who approached a police officer, and Plaintiff \n27  Travis was hit several times. PPD officers told the press to leave the area at 9:20 p.m. The \n28  crowd was dispersed and gone from the free speech area by 9:56 p.m.  \n \n- 3 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  Over the course of the evening, PPD documented eight Incident Reportsโfor \n2  criminal  damage,  disorderly  conduct,  aggravated  assault  on  Police,  and  unlawful \n3  assemblyโand made five individual arrests. After the rally, Chief Williams  publicly \n4  acknowledged that she directed PPDโs actions against the protestors and that the actions \n5  were appropriate. \n6    On September 4, 2018, Plaintiffs filed suit against PPD and certain PPD membersโ\n7  including  Chief  Williams,  Field  Force  Commander  Moore,  Grenadier  Team  Leader \n8  McBride, and Grenadiers Scott, Turiano, Neville, Sticca, White, Howell, and Herrโ\n9  raising four claims: (1) a claim under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 for excessive use of force during a \n10  search or seizure under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments; (2) a ยง 1983 claim for \n11  infringement of Plaintiffsโ freedom of speech and association rights under the First and \n12  Fourteenth  Amendments;  (3)  a  ยง  1983  claim  for  due  process  violations  under  the \n13  Fourteenth Amendment; and (4) a ยง 1983 claim for equal protection violations under the \n14  First and Fourteenth Amendments. (Doc. 1, Compl.) Plaintiffs now move to certify this \n15  suit as a class action. \n16  II.  LEGAL STANDARD \n17  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) provides that a class actionโthat is, an action \n18  in which one or more members of a class sue on behalf of all members of the classโmay \n19  proceed only if four prerequisites are met: \n20  (1)  Numerosity:  โthe  class  is  so  numerous  that  joinder  of  all  members  is \n21  impracticable;โ \n22  (2)  Commonality: โthere are questions of law or fact common to the class;โ \n23  (3)  Typicality: โthe claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of \n24  the claims or defenses of the class;โ and \n25  (4)  Adequacy  of  Representation:  โthe  representative  parties  will  fairly  and \n26  adequately protect the interests of the class.โ \n27  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n28 \n \n- 4 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1    In addition, under Rule 23(b), a court may only certify a class action if there is at \n2  least one of the following: \n3  (1)  Risk of Inconsistency: the prosecution of separate actions by individual class \n4  members would create a risk of inconsistent adjudications or adjudications \n5  that would be dispositive of non-party class member interests; or \n6  (2)  Appropriate Class-Wide Injunctive Relief: injunctive or declaratory relief is \n7  appropriate respecting the class as a whole because the conduct of  the \n8  opposing party applies generally to the class; or \n9  (3)  Predominance and Superiority: โthe court finds that the questions of law or \n10  fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting \n11  only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available \n12  methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.โ \n13  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b). \n14    โRule  23  does  not  set  forth  a  mere  pleading  standard.  A  party  seeking  class \n15  certification must affirmatively demonstrate his compliance with the Ruleโthat is, he must \n16  be prepared to prove that there are in fact sufficiently numerous parties, common questions \n17  of law or fact, etc.โ Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011). Thus, \n18  โโsometimes it may be necessary for the court to probe behind the pleadings before coming \n19  to rest on the certification question.โโ Id. (quoting Gen. Tel. Co. of the Sw. v. Falcon, 457 \n20  U.S. 147, 160 (1982)). Class certification โis proper only if โthe trial court is satisfied, after \n21  a rigorous analysis, that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) have been satisfied,โโ which will \n22  frequently โentail some overlap with the merits of the plaintiffโs underlying claim.โ Id. at \n23  350โ51 (quoting Falcon, 457 U.S. at 161). \n24  III.  ANALYSIS \n25  In the Complaint, Plaintiffs propose a โdamages classโ consisting of  \n26   \nthose persons who were present on August 22, 2017, at the Trump Protest \n27 \narea north of the Convention Center which was designated as the โfree-\n28  speech zoneโ (the area for anti-Trump protestors bounded to the south by \n \n- 5 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  Monroe Street, 2nd Street to the west, and 3rd street to the east) and forced \nby PPD onto adjacent streets at any point between 8:25 and 10:00 P.M., who \n2 \ndid not engage in any conduct justifying the Defendantsโ use of force against \n3  them, and who were subjected to the PPDโs dispersal by the use of force, or \nother unlawful police activity arising from the police response to anti-Trump \n4 \nprotestors. \n5   \n6  (Compl. ยถ 112.) Plaintiffs propose two damages subclasses: (a) โAll persons who were \n7  unlawfully dispersed by the use of gas, pepper spray, pepper bullets, or other chemical \n8  agents;โ and (b) โAll persons who were unlawfully dispersed by PPD by being struck with \n9  projectiles of any type.โ (Compl. ยถ 112.) Plaintiffs Janet Travis and Cynthia Guillen are \n10  proposed class representatives for damages subclasses (a) and (b), and Plaintiff Jacinta \n11  Gonzalez Goodman is a proposed class representative for only subclass (a).2 \n12    Plaintiffs propose an โinjunctive relief classโ consisting of \n \n13 \nall persons who have in the past, including those present at the anti-Trump \n14 \nprotest on August 22, 2017, between 8:25 and 10:00 P.M., or may in the \nfuture, participate in, or be present at, demonstrations within the City of \n15 \nPhoenix in the exercise of their rights of free speech and assembly without \n16  engaging in any conduct justifying the use of force. \n17  (Compl. ยถ 113.) Plaintiffsโ proposed injunctive relief class representatives are Travis, \n18  Guillen, and Gonzalez Goodman as well as the two Plaintiff organizations, Puente and \n19  Poder. \n20    A.  Proposed Damages Class \n21      1.  Failsafe Class Definition \n22    Defendants argue that Plaintiffsโ proposed damages class definition fails, somewhat \n23  ironically, because it is โfailsafeโโthat is, it limits โmembership to plaintiffs described by \n24  their theory of liability in the class definition such that the definition presupposes success \n25  on the merits.โ Melgar v. CSK Auto, Inc., 681 F. Appโx 605, 607 (9th Cir. 2017). Put \n26  another way, Defendants argue that, by limiting class membership to those โwho did not \n27  engage in any conduct justifying the Defendantsโ use of force against them,โ the class \n                                              \n28  2 The Complaint also named Plaintiff Ira Yedlin as a class representative, but Plaintiffs \nwithdrew him as a class representative in their Reply. (Reply at 12.) \n \n- 6 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  definition requires that the Court examine the merits of each individualโs claim before it \n2  can determine whether the individual is a member of the class, which Defendants contend \n3  is unacceptable. (Resp. at 12โ15.)  \n4    As Defendants point out, โโDefining the class is of critical importance because it \n5  identifies the persons (1) entitled to relief, (2) bound by a final judgment, and (3) entitled \n6  under Rule 23(c)(2) to the best notice practicable in a Rule 23(b)(3) action.โ Thus, a class \n7  definition โmust be precise, objective, and presently ascertainableโ before a class action can \n8  proceed.โ (Resp. at 12 (quoting Daniel F. v. Blue Shield of Cal., 305 F.R.D. 115, 121 (N.D. \n9  Cal. 2014) (internal quotations omitted)).) In Lyall v. City of Los Angeles, another District \n10  Judge declined to certify a class defined as individuals โwho did not engage in any conduct \n11  justifying their detention by [Los Angeles Police Department] officers or the officersโ \n12  forced entry over objection to the artistsโ spaceโ because the class was not presently \n13  ascertainable and therefore โunmanageable virtually by definition.โ 2010 WL 11549565, \n14  at *2โ3 (C.D. Cal. May 18, 2010) (internal quotations omitted). \n15    Plaintiffs  and  Defendants  interpret  the  proposed  damages  class  definition \n16  differently. Plaintiffs represent that they intended to define a class not by presupposing that \n17  they win the legal question at issue, but rather by limiting the class to individuals who did \n18  not engage in certain conduct. (Reply at 5โ6; Doc. 165, June 12, 2019, Hearing Transcript \n19  (โHrโg Tr.โ) at 13.) Defendants focus not on the conduct of the class members, but rather \n20  the conclusion that must be drawn from that conductโthat it did not justify Defendantsโ \n21  use of force against them. (Resp. at 13.) \n22    The Court is not entirely convinced that a failsafe class definition must fail in every \n23  instance. But Plaintiffsโ proposed damages class definition can be read to require that a \n24  legal conclusion be reached as to whether individualsโ conduct justified the force used \n25  against them before determining if they are members of the class, which the Court agrees \n26  is inconsistent with the goals of precision, objectivity, and present ascertainability in class \n27  definition. See Hagen v. City of Winnemucca, 108 F.R.D. 61, 63โ64 (D. Nev. 1985).  \n28 \n \n- 7 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1    A court โmay construct a definition of the class or may modify a proposed definition \n2  where the original is inadequate.โ Id. at 64 (internal quotations and citations omitted). Here, \n3  the Court finds the defect in Plaintiffsโ proposed damages class definition to be somewhat \n4  akin to a defective complaint in which a claim relies on allegations couched as legal \n5  conclusions instead of non-conclusory allegations of fact. If the class definition were to \n6  focus on the individualsโ conduct, as Plaintiffs intended, concerns about having to reach \n7  the merits of Plaintiffsโ claims in identifying class members would no longer be present. \n8  Moreover, the conduct Defendants have identified as justifying their use of force was only \n9  two-fold: individuals attempting to breach the free speech zone barrier and individuals \n10  throwing objects (including CS gas cannisters) at PPD officers. Thus, a more precise, \n11  presently ascertainable, non-conclusory class definition that is consistent with the class \n12  definition Plaintiffs have chosen would be as follows: \n13   \nthose persons who were present on August 22, 2017, at the Trump Protest \n14 \narea north of the Convention Center which was designated as the โfree-\n15  speech zoneโ (the area for anti-Trump protestors bounded to the south by \nMonroe Street, 2nd Street to the west, and 3rd street to the east) and forced \n16 \nby PPD onto adjacent streets at any point between 8:25 and 10:00 P.M., who \n17  neither threw objects nor attempted to breach the โfree speech zoneโ barrier \nalong Monroe Street, and who were subjected to the PPDโs dispersal by the \n18 \nuse of force, or other unlawful police activity arising from the police response \n19  to anti-Trump protestors. \n(Compl. ยถ 112 (altered provision emphasized).) Indeed, Plaintiffs propose alternative \n20 \nlanguage along these very lines in their Reply. (Reply at 8.) The Court finds this language \n21 \nwould alleviate concerns about conducting merits inquiries in forming the class. \n22 \n    2.  Numerosity, Commonality, Predominance, and Damages \n23 \nPlaintiffs  generally  describe  their  theory  of  liability  as  follows:  โPPD  used \n24 \nindiscriminate force against the whole protest (as opposed to individual protestors against \n25 \nwhom such force was justified) and declared an unlawful assembly based on the conduct \n26 \nof a few individuals who could and should have been isolated. This undifferentiated use of \n27 \nforce and wholesale crowd dispersal violated the  protestorsโ rights.โ (Reply at 5โ6.) \n28 \n \n- 8 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  Plaintiffs allege that large numbers of individuals were subject to PPDโs use of force, that \n2  common issues of law and fact apply to those individualsโ claims, and that the common \n3  issues  predominate  over  individual  issues,  thus  satisfying  the  requirements  of  Rules \n4  23(a)(1), (2), and 23(b)(3). \n5    In contrast, Defendants contend that the evidence shows that Plaintiffsโ claims โare \n6  riddled with individualized inquiries that cannot be answered on a classwide basis.โ (Resp. \n7  at 14.) Defendants point in particular to evidence that the PPD deployments of munitions, \n8  whether in the form of gas and chemical agents (Plaintiffsโ proposed damages subclass (a)) \n9  or bullets and projectiles (Plaintiffsโ proposed damages subclass (b)), were targeted at \n10  certain individuals and spread out over time and space. The Court now examines whether \n11  Plaintiffs have sufficiently demonstrated numerosity, commonality, and predominance \n12  with respect to each proposed damages subclass. \n13        a.  Proposed Damages Subclass (a) โ Gas/Chemical Agents\n14    Plaintiffs  contend  the  evidence  shows  that  the  individuals  exposed  to  gas  or \n15  chemical agents โnumber at least in the hundredsโ out of the estimated 6,000 protestors. \n16  (Mot. at 25.) They further argue that these individualsโ claims for relief require resolving \n17  central, common questions as to Defendantsโ liability and that these common questions \n18  predominate over individual issues, satisfying Rules 23(a)(2) and 23(b)(3). (Mot. at 27โ\n19  30.) Plaintiffs also argue that the individualsโ damages for deprivation of their First and \n20  Fourth  Amendment  rights,  which  resulted  from  centralized  command  decisions,  are \n21  sufficiently common, and even if they are not, individualized damages should not defeat \n22  class certification. (Mot. at 30โ31.) \n23    A  review  of  the  video  and  other  evidence  reveals  that  a  large  number  of \n24  individualsโmore than 40โappear to have been exposed to gas or chemical agents, even \n25  if in some instances it was inert smoke, and Plaintiffs therefore satisfy the numerosity \n26  requirement. \n27    As for commonality, the Court need not find that all questions of fact and law be \n28  common to the individual class members; โ[t]he existence of shared legal issues with \n \n- 9 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  divergent factual predicates is sufficient, as is a common core of salient facts coupled with \n2  disparate legal remedies within the class.โ Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1019 \n3  (9th Cir. 1998), overruled on other grounds by Dukes, 564 U.S. at 338. Plaintiffsโ First \n4  Amendment claim requires they demonstrate that Defendantsโ actions deterred or chilled \n5  their political speech and that such deterrence or chilling was a โsubstantial or motivating \n6  factorโ in Defendantsโ conduct.3 Mendocino Envtl. Ctr. v. Mendocino Cty., 192 F.3d 1283, \n7  1300 (9th Cir. 1999) (internal quotations omitted). Such intent can be demonstrated by \n8  showing that Defendantsโ acts โwould chill or silence a person of ordinary firmness from \n9  future First Amendment activities.โ Id. (internal quotations omitted). Plaintiffsโ Fourth \n10  Amendment claim requires they show that Defendantsโ use of force was not โreasonableโ \n11  under the โfacts and circumstancesโ of the case.4 Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 396 \n12  (1989). \n13    Defendants  argue  that  their  use  of  gas  and  chemical  agents  was  by  different \n14  grenadiers exercising individual judgment in response to certain actions by protestors, and \n15  each use was targeted at certain groups of individuals. As a result, Defendants contend, the \n16  factual  questions  arising  from  their  use  of  force  are  too  individualized  for  class \n17  certification. In support, they rely on cases in which courts denied class certification such \n18  as Moss v. United States Secret Service, 2015 WL 5705126, at *1โ2 (D. Or. Sep. 28, 2015), \n19  in which officers struck certain individuals or hit them with pepper spray bullets in \n20  attempting to move them from their location; Lyall, 2010 WL 11549565, at *2โ3, in which \n21  officers subjected certain individuals at a musical and cultural event to searches; and \n22  Universal Calvary Church v. City of New York, 177 F.R.D. 181, 182 (S.D.N.Y. 1998), in \n23  which officers used mace on certain individuals to prevent them from leaving a church over \n24  a period of more than twelve hours. \n25 \n                                              \n3 Plaintiffsโ Equal Protection claim will โrise and fall with the First Amendment claim.โ \n26 \nOSU Student Alliance v. Ray, 699 F.3d 1053, 1067 (9th Cir. 2012). \n \n27  4 In contrast, Plaintiffsโ Fourteenth Amendment claimโthe excessive use of force claim \nwhere there was no โseizureโโrequires they show the officersโ conduct โshock[s] the \n28 \nconscience.โ See Darrah v. City of Oak Park, 255 F.3d 301, 305โ06 (6th Cir. 2001) \n(comparing Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment excessive use of force claims).  \n \n- 10 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1    The Court disagrees with Defendants that this case is similar to those and that the \n2  factual and legal questions as to PPDโs use of gas/chemical agents are too individualized \n3  for class certification here. While the grenadiers report that they intended to target certain \n4  groups of individuals with their use of force, the very nature of the use of gas is that it is \n5  not contained to a certain individual or a small area. The video evidence shows that PPDโs \n6  use of pepper balls, tear gas, and inert smoke caused large numbers of protestors to \n7  disperse. The Court also disagrees with Defendantsโ argument that even if inert smoke \n8  appears to have had an impact on the larger number of people, it was โjust inert smokeโ \n9  and likely caused at most minimal injury. A jury could find the smoke had the effect PPD \n10  intendedโdispersal of the crowdโand that is squarely at issue in Plaintiffsโ claims. \n11    The Court also finds that Plaintiffs have satisfactorily demonstrated for the purposes \n12  of their Motion that Defendantsโ actions were likely command decisions, from the initial \n13  authorization to use gas and chemical agents, to the unlawful assembly and dispersal \n14  announcements, to the later ratification of PPDโs actions by its Chief.5 Plaintiffs thus have \n15  shown that both factual and legal questions as to the propriety of Defendantsโ use of gas \n16  and chemical agents are common among the proposed class members and predominate \n17  over any individual questions. See Multi-Ethnic Immigrant Workers Organizing Network \n18  v. City of Los Angeles, 246 F.R.D. 621, 634โ35 (C.D. Cal. 2007) (โMIWONโ). \n19    Finally, Defendants contend that determining the amount of damages each class \n20  member  is  entitled  to  demands  individual  inquiries,  which  weighs  against  class \n21  certification. (Resp. at 17 n.11.) However, as Plaintiffs point out, if they can โshow that \n22  their damages stemmed from the defendantโs actions that created their legal liability,โ the \n23  โpresence of individualized damages cannot, by itself, defeat class certification under Rule \n24  23(b)(3).โ (Mot. at 31 (quoting Leyva v. Medline Indus. Inc., 716 F.3d 510, 513โ14 (9th \n25  Cir. 2013))); see also Blackie v. Barrack, 524 F.2d 891, 905 (9th Cir. 1975) (โThe amount \n                                              \n26  5 To the extent Defendants contend that common issues do not extend to each grenadier \nand his individual use of gas and chemical agents, Plaintiffs rely on the principle of \n27 \nโintegral participation,โ which โdoes not require that each officerโs actions themselves rise \nto the level of a constitutional violationโ if the officer was aware of the decisions to use \n28 \nforce and a participant in the concerted action to use it. Boyd v. Benton Cty., 374 F.3d 773, \n780 (9th Cir. 2004). \n \n- 11 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  of  damages  is  invariably  an  individual  question  and  does  not  defeat  class  action \n2  treatment.โ) Plaintiffs have satisfactorily shown that any class-wide damages will arise \n3  from common proof regarding Defendantsโ liability to satisfy the requirements at the class \n4  certification stage. See Chua v. City of Los Angeles, 2017 WL 10776036, at *11 (C.D. Cal. \n5  May 25, 2017). \n6        b.  Proposed Damages Subclass (b) โ Projectiles \n7    As for protestors hit with projectiles, Plaintiffs state they have uncovered 20 such \n8  individuals and point out that PPD has stated it fired 590 projectiles over the course of the \n9  evening. (Mot. at 25.) Thus, Plaintiffs argue they are likely to form a class of more than 40 \n10  individuals and, in any event, the Court should certify the subclass even if it is comprised \n11  of fewer than 40 individuals under Jordan v. County of Los Angeles, 669 F.2d 1311, 1319 \n12  & n.10 (9th Cir. 1992) (identifying 8 cases certifying classes with fewer than 40 members). \n13  (Mot. at 25.) As with Defendantsโ use of gas and chemical agents, Plaintiffs argue that the \n14  individualsโ  claims  for  relief  require  resolving  central,  common  questions  as  to \n15  Defendantsโ liability and that these common questions predominate over individual issues, \n16  satisfying Rules 23(a)(2) and 23(b)(3). (Mot. at 27โ30.) \n17    Here, the Court disagrees with Plaintiffs that the issues are sufficiently common. \n18  The video and other evidence shows that Defendants used bullets and other projectiles \n19  against individual protestors under varying circumstances in different locations and at \n20  different times. Thus, both the factual questions and the legal onesโsuch as whether each \n21  deployment of bullets was reasonable under the circumstances at the timeโwill differ for \n22  each individual. See Moss, 2015 WL 5705126, at *1โ2; Lyall, 2010 WL 11549565, at *2โ\n23  3. Because Plaintiffs have not demonstrated commonality and predominance under Rules \n24  23(a)92) and 23(b)(3), the Court will decline to certify proposed damages subclass (b). \n25      3.  Typicality and Adequacy of Representation \n26    Returning  to  the  remaining  damages  classโproposed  damages  subclass  (a)โ\n27  Plaintiffs have satisfactorily demonstrated typicality and adequacy of representation with \n28  respect to the named Plaintiffs. Gonzalez Goodman, Guillen, and Travis all claim they were \n \n- 12 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  exposed to Defendantsโ gas/chemical agents and subject to Defendantsโ dispersal order. \n2  Moreover, there is no argument before the Court that the named Plaintiffs have a conflict \n3  of interest or that counsel for Plaintiffs are not competent to represent the class. Plaintiffs \n4  have therefore shown typicality and adequacy of representation under Rules 23(a)(3) and \n5  (4). Because Plaintiffs have met the requirements of Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(3), the Court \n6  will certify Plaintiffsโ proposed subclass (a) of the damages class for a class action. \n7  B.  Proposed Injunctive Relief Class \n8    1.  Standing \n9  With regard to Plaintiffsโ proposed injunctive relief class, Defendants argue that \n10  Plaintiffs do not have standing to seek injunctive relief because they have not demonstrated \n11  an actual and imminent repetition of Defendantsโ alleged violations. (Resp. at 24โ27.) A \n12  plaintiff cannot properly represent a class if the plaintiff lacks individual standing. Hawkins \n13  v. Comparet-Cassani, 251 F.3d 1230, 1238 (9th Cir. 2001). Moreover, a plaintiff โmust \n14  demonstrate standing separately for each form of relief sought.โ DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. \n15  Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 352 (2006). Article III standing has three elements. Lujan v. Defenders \n16  of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992). First, a plaintiff must have suffered an โinjury in \n17  factโan invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized . . . \n18  and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.โ Id. (internal citations and \n19  quotations omitted). Second, there must be a causal connection between the injury and the \n20  alleged violation. Id. at 560. Third, it must be likely that the injury will be redressed by a \n21  favorable decision. Id. A plaintiff must allege sufficient, specific facts in the complaint to \n22  establish standing. Schmier v. U.S. Court of Appeals for Ninth Circuit, 279 F.3d 817, 821 \n23  (9th Cir. 2002). \n24  An organization has standing โto seek judicial relief from injury to itself and to \n25  vindicate whatever rights and immunities the association itself may enjoy.โ  Warth v. \n26  Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 511 (1975). An organization also has โassociational standingโ to \n27  bring suit on behalf of its members โwhen its members would otherwise have standing to \n28  sue in their own right, the interests at stake are germane to the organizationโs purpose, and \n \n- 13 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual \n2  members in the lawsuit.โ Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., \n3  528 U.S. 167, 181 (2000) (citing Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Adver. Commโn, 432 U.S. 333, \n4  343 (1977)). \n5  To be a class representative seeking injunctive relief, a plaintiff โmust demonstrate \n6  โthat he is realistically threatened by a repetition of [the violation].โโ Armstrong v. Davis, \n7  275 F.3d 849, 860โ61 (9th Cir. 2001) (quoting City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, \n8  109 (1983)), overruled on other grounds by Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499 (2005). A \n9  plaintiff โneed not establish that future harm is certain, or even probableโ but โmust \n10  establish that recurrence is not โconjecturalโ or โhypothetical.โโ MIWON, 246 F.R.D. at 628 \n11  (citing Lyons, 461 U.S. at 105โ08). \n12  Here, Plaintiffs contend that they suffered actual injuries as a result of deficient PPD \n13  policies and that Defendantsโ conduct at the protest was officially sanctioned behavior \n14  violative of Plaintiffsโ federal rights. (Reply at 15โ16.) Defendants frame their conduct at \n15  the protest by stating, โofficers used types of force they rarely use, in response to sudden \n16  and specific threats, in an unusually tense high-security atmosphere,โ such that Plaintiffs \n17  are not realistically threatened by a repetition of the violations they allege occurred in \n18  response to the protest. (Resp. at 28.) \n19  The Court notes that although the named Plaintiffs allege their First Amendment \n20  rights have been chilled by Defendantsโ conduct, the evidence shows they have attended \n21  demonstrations in Phoenix since PPDโs use of force at issue in this lawsuit. The Court will \n22  accept Plaintiffsโ position that โchillingโ free speech rights is not equivalent to preventing \n23  Plaintiffs from protesting, but rather has made them more reluctant or fearful to do soโa \n24  proposition Defendants do not appear to challenge. (Hrโg Tr. at 29โ31.) \n25  With regard to whether Plaintiffs are realistically threatened by a repetition of \n26  Defendantsโ alleged violations, in Armstrong, the Ninth Circuit stated there are at least two \n27  ways to demonstrate that an injury is likely to recur for the purposes of standing to seek \n28  injunctive relief. 275 F.3d at 861.  \n \n- 14 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1   \nFirst, a plaintiff may show that the defendant had, at the time of the injury, a \n2 \nwritten policy, and that the injury stems from that policy. In other words, \n3  where the harm alleged is directly traceable to a written policy, there is an \nimplicit likelihood of its repetition in the immediate future. Second, the \n4 \nplaintiff may demonstrate that the harm is part of a pattern of officially \n5  sanctioned . . . behavior, violative of the plaintiffsโ [federal] rights. Thus, \nwhere the defendants have repeatedly engaged in the injurious acts in the \n6 \npast, there is a sufficient possibility that they will engage in them in the near \n7  future to satisfy the realistic repetition requirement. \n8  Id. at 861 (internal quotations and citations omitted). \n9    As for the second of these ways of demonstrating a realistic likelihood of recurrence, \n10  the parties dispute whether PPDโs past conduct is sufficient to indicate that PPD will \n11  engage in a use of force in the future similar to that alleged by Plaintiffs in this case. But \n12  the Court finds that Plaintiffs have provided enough policy evidence to meet the first of the \n13  two tests set forth in Armstrong. Specifically, Plaintiffs point to evidence that PPD had no \n14  policy in place at the time of the protest regarding the use of tear gas/chemical agents, \n15  which is directly related to Plaintiffsโ alleged injuries. (Reply at 15.) Moreover, Plaintiffs \n16  provide evidence that PPD did not change its procedures or implement corrective actions \n17  after the protest, and indeed its Chief ratified PPDโs conduct after the event. (Reply at 15โ\n18  16.) Because the harm Plaintiffs allege is traceable to PPDโs policies, or lack thereof, the \n19  Court can infer a realistic repetition of PPDโs course of action sufficient for standing \n20  purposes. \n21      2.  Rule 23(a) Elements \n22    The parties do not raise new arguments regarding whether Plaintiffsโ proposed \n23  injunctive relief class meets the Rule 23(a) requirements of numerosity, commonality, \n24  typicality, and adequacy of representation, as applied to the individual Plaintiffs and the \n25  organizational Plaintiffs in vindicating their own interests and those of their members. \n26  Instead, Defendants point out that a class action is not necessary to obtain injunctive relief \n27  when an individual plaintiff can obtain the same relief (Resp. at 27)โa proposition with \n28  which, as a practical matter, the Court agrees. However, because Plaintiffsโ damages class \n \n- 15 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  will be certified and the issues involved in seeking damages and injunctive relief largely \n2  intersect, allowing the injunctive relief class to proceed will not result in substantial \n3  unfairness or inefficiency. The Court will thus certify Plaintiffsโ proposed injunctive class. \n4    C.  Other Motions \n5    Defendants filed a Motion for Leave to Supplement the Class Certification Record \n6  (Doc. 138), which Plaintiffs opposed with a Motion to Strike (Doc. 146). The Court \n7  reviewed the deposition transcripts provided by Defendants (Docs. 139, 140) together with \n8  their Motion and did not find Defendantsโ summaries to be akin to additional briefing. The \n9  Court will therefore grant Defendantsโ Motion for Leave to Supplement (Doc. 138), grant \n10  Defendantsโ associated Motion to Seal (Doc. 141), and deny Plaintiffsโ Motion to Strike \n11  (Doc. 146). \n12  Defendants also filed a Motion for Leave to File a Sur-Reply (Doc. 144), which \n13  Plaintiffs opposed (Doc. 148). Because the Court did not rely on Defendantsโ proposed \n14  Sur-Reply in resolving Plaintiffsโ Amended Motion for Class Certification (Doc. 101), the \n15  Court will deny Defendantsโ Motion for Leave to File a Sur-Reply (Doc. 144) as moot. \n16    IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED granting in part and denying in part Plaintiffsโ \n17  Amended  Motion  for  Class  Certification  (Doc.  101).  The  Court  certifies  Plaintiffsโ \n18  proposed subclass (a) of the damages class with the modification to the class definition \n19  described in this Order, as well as Plaintiffsโ proposed injunctive relief class. The Court \n20  denies certification of Plaintiffsโ proposed damages subclass (b). \n21    IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  granting  Defendantsโ  Motion  for  Leave  to \n22  Supplement the Class Certification Record (Doc. 138) and directing the Clerk of Court to \n23  file on the docket the documents currently lodged at Docs. 139 and 140. \n24  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED granting the Motion to File Exhibit under Seal \n25  (Doc. 141) and directing the Clerk of Court to file under seal the document currently lodged \n26  under seal at Doc. 142. \n27   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED denying as moot Defendantsโ Motion for Leave to \n28  File a Sur-Reply (Doc. 144). \n \n- 16 - \n\n \n \n \n \n1  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED denying Plaintiffsโ Motion to Strike Portions of \n2  Defendantsโ Supplements or Alternatively for Leave to Respond to Defendantsโ Filings \n3  (Doc. 146). \n4    Dated this 30th day of September, 2019. \n5 \n   \nHonorable John J.

(See Doc. 334.) The \n3  Court elects to resolve the partiesโ cross motions for summary judgment without oral \n4  argument.2 See LRCiv 7.2(f). \n5  I.  BACKGROUND \n6  On  August  22,  2017,  President  Donald  Trump  held  a  rally  at  the  Phoenix \n7  Convention Center, and approximately 6,000 demonstratorsโboth pro-Trump and anti-\n8  Trumpโgathered outside the Convention Center. The Phoenix Police Department (โPPDโ) \n9  had about a weekโs advance notice of the rally, during which it made preparations to try to \n10  ensure the safety of the downtown area and the public during the expected demonstrations. \n11  The preparations included setting up a โfree speech zoneโ designated for anti-Trump \n12  demonstrators on the north side of the Convention Center, across Monroe Street. The free \n13  speech zone was bordered by 2nd Street to the west, 3rd Street to the east, and Monroe \n14  Street to the south, and demarcated by a three-foot high pedestrian fence and โDo Not \n15  Crossโ tape. PPD anticipated that certain groups of demonstrators would be present, \n16  including Antifaโa national, militant political protest movement opposing fascism and \n17  right-wing ideology whose groups had disrupted several other demonstrations, including \n18  one in Charlottesville, Virginia, in the weeks preceding President Trumpโs Phoenix visitโ\n19  as  well  as  Plaintiff  Puenteโa  Phoenix  grassroots  organization  representing  migrant \n20  communities through lobbying, advocacy, and activismโand Plaintiff Poder in Action \n21  (โPoderโ)โa Phoenix grassroots organization with a mission of empowering victims of \n22  injustice through leadership development, civic engagement, and policy advocacy. \n23    In  a  Presidential  Visit  After-Action  Report  (Doc.  101-3  at  2โ35,  Bates  Nos. \n24  COP014832โ014865, โPPD Reportโ), Defendant PPD Chief Jeri Williams stated that, on \n25  the day of the rally, PPD deployed approximately 985 officers around the Convention \n26  Center. According to the report, large crowds of demonstrators began arriving by 11:00 a.m. \n27 \n \n2 Because the Court refrains from explicitly referring to sealed evidence in this Order, the \n28 \nCourt enters the Order on the public docket. \n \n- 2 - \n\n  Case 2:18-cv-02778-JJT   Document 336   Filed 02/07/22   Page 3 of 34\n \n \n \n1  and, although PPD officers observed minor altercations and a few water bottles being \n2  thrown at rally attendees lining up to enter the Convention Center, the demonstrations \n3  proceeded generally without incident during the day. \n4  The  rally  inside  the  Convention  Center  began  at  6:30  p.m.  At  approximately \n5  8:15 p.m., after PPD officers around 2nd Street and Monroe reported that water bottles \n6  were being thrown at them, officers used a Long Range Acoustic Device (โLRADโ) to \n7  make announcements instructing individuals to stop throwing objects. At 8:23 p.m., 15 to \n8  20 individuals PPD had identified as Antifa put up large banners near the fence along \n9  Monroe,  which  concealed  their  activities  from  PPD  officers.  PPD  deployed  Tactical \n10  Response Unit (โTRUโ) personnel, including grenadiers trained in the deployment of \n11  chemical munitions, across from the area where Antifa had gathered. Just after 8:32 p.m., \n12  PPD officers observed Antifa pushing or shaking the fence in what appeared to be a breach. \n13    On orders from Field Force Commander Lt. Benjamin Moore, PPD deployed its \n14  first munition in front of Antifa just before 8:33 p.m. in the form of pepper balls on the \n15  ground, which cleared most individuals from the immediate vicinity. Thereafter, PPD \n16  officers reported that rocks and bottles were being thrown and, at 8:34, officers reported \n17  that canisters of some kind of tear gas were thrown at them. At that point, PPD officers \n18  donned gas masks and, at 8:34 to 8:35, the grenadiers deployed inert smoke bombs. Large \n19  numbers of demonstrators began to clear the area.  \n20  After officers noted that smoke canisters were being kicked and thrown back and a \n21  spear-like object and an incendiary device were thrown at them, at 8:35 to 8:36, the \n22  grenadiers were ordered to deploy CS gasโa type of tear gasโin what they perceived to \n23  be focused locations. Plaintiff Jacinta Gonzalez Goodman alleges she inhaled gas. Plaintiff \n24  Ira Yedlin, who was standing near the area where Antifa had been, was hit five times by \n25  projectiles. The grenadiers also deployed aerial flash bangs intended to act as auditory \n26  warnings. Demonstrators began to run away and, by 8:39, the area where individuals had \n27  been throwing projectiles was mostly empty, although demonstrators remained to the east \n28  and west of the area. \n \n- 3 - \n\n  Case 2:18-cv-02778-JJT   Document 336   Filed 02/07/22   Page 4 of 34\n \n \n \n1    From 8:36 to 8:45, PPD used additional smoke canisters and pepper balls to clear \n2  an area so that officers could form skirmish lines to disperse the remaining individuals. \n3  Helicopters from the PPD Air Unit began arriving at 8:40, and they started making \n4  announcements directing the crowd to disperse at 8:52. In this time period, the grenadiers \n5  deployed smoke canisters, pepper balls, muzzle blasts, and OC bulletsโbullets filled with \n6  pepper sprayโat remaining individuals, and a munition hit Plaintiff Cynthia Guillen. Lines \n7  of PPD officers with riot shields began marching to move the crowd at 8:56. At some point \n8  between  8:42  and  8:47,  PPD  had  made  the  final  determination  that  the  crowd  was \n9  unlawfully assembled, so at 9:02, an official unlawful assembly announcement was made \n10  via a public address system from a marked police vehicle on the ground. \n11    Thereafter, the grenadiers deployed munitions in the form of pepper balls, OC \n12  bullets, muzzle blasts, and CS gas canisters at anyone who approached a police officer, and \n13  Plaintiff Janet Travis was hit in the back and pepper sprayed. PPD officers told the press \n14  to leave the area at 9:20. The crowd was dispersed and gone from the free speech area by \n15  9:56 p.m.  \n16  Over the course of the evening, PPD documented eight Incident Reportsโfor \n17  criminal  damage,  disorderly  conduct,  aggravated  assault  on  Police,  and  unlawful \n18  assemblyโand made five arrests of individuals who are not named Plaintiffs in this action. \n19  After the rally, Chief Williams publicly acknowledged that she directed PPDโs actions \n20  against the protestors and that the actions were appropriate. \n21    On September 4, 2018, Plaintiffs filed suit against the City of Phoenix and certain \n22  PPD  membersโincluding  Chief  Williams,  Lt.  Moore,  Grenadier  Team  Leader  Sgt. \n23  Douglas McBride, and Grenadiers Robert Scott, Christopher Turiano, Glenn Neville, John \n24  Sticca, Lane White, Jeffrey Howell, and George Herrโraising four claims: (1) a claim \n25  under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 for excessive use of force during a search or seizure under the \n26  Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments; (2) a ยง 1983 claim for infringement of Plaintiffsโ \n27  freedom of speech and association rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments; (3) a \n28  ยง 1983 claim for due process violations under the Fourteenth Amendment; and (4) a ยง 1983 \n \n- 4 - \n\n  Case 2:18-cv-02778-JJT   Document 336   Filed 02/07/22   Page 5 of 34\n \n \n \n1  claim for equal protection violations under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. (Doc. 1, \n2  Compl.)  \n3  After Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed certain claimsโincluding the claims in their \n4  entirety against  Defendants  Neville, Sticca,  and Whiteโthe  six  Plaintiffsโ individual \n5  claims remain against Defendants the City, Chief Williams, Lt. Moore, and Sgt. McBride. \n6  (Compl.; Doc. 281.) Additionally, the individual Plaintiffs bring claims as follows: Travis \n7  against Turiano and Howell; Yedlin against Scott, Howell, and Herr; and Guillen against \n8  Scott, Turiano, Howell, and Herr. (Compl.; Doc. 281.) \n9  Plaintiffs moved to certify their claims as a class action under Federal Rule of Civil \n10  Procedure 23, and the Court granted their Motion in part. (Doc. 191.) The Court certified \n11  a โdamages classโ consisting of  \n12 \nthose persons who were present on August 22, 2017, at the Trump Protest \narea north of the Convention Center which was designated as the โfree-\n13 \nspeech zoneโ (the area for anti-Trump protestors bounded to the south by \n14  Monroe Street, 2nd Street to the west, and 3rd street to the east) and forced \nby PPD onto adjacent streets at any point between 8:25 and 10:00 P.M., who \n15 \nneither threw objects nor attempted to breach the โfree speech zoneโ barrier \n16  along Monroe Street, and who were subjected to the PPDโs dispersal by the \nuse of force, or other unlawful police activity arising from the police response \n17 \nto anti-Trump protestors. \n18   \n19  (Compl. ยถ 112, as altered in Doc. 191.) The damages class consists of only one certified \n20  subclass: (a) โAll persons who were unlawfully dispersed by the use of gas, pepper spray, \n21  pepper bullets, or other chemical agents.โ (Compl. ยถ 112.) Plaintiffs Travis, Guillen, and \n22  Gonzalez Goodman are class representatives for the damages class.  \n23    The Court also certified an โinjunctive relief classโ consisting of \n \n24 \nall persons who have in the past, including those present at the anti-Trump \n25  protest on August 22, 2017, between 8:25 and 10:00 P.M., or may in the \nfuture, participate in, or be present at, demonstrations within the City of \n26 \nPhoenix in the exercise of their rights of free speech and assembly without \n27  engaging in any conduct justifying the use of force. \n \n28 \n \n- 5 - \n\n  Case 2:18-cv-02778-JJT   Document 336   Filed 02/07/22   Page 6 of 34\n \n \n \n1  (Compl. ยถ 113.) Plaintiffs Travis, Guillen, and Gonzalez Goodman as well as the two \n2  Plaintiff organizations, Puente and Poder, are class representatives for the injunctive relief \n3  class. \n4  The Court now resolves the partiesโ cross-motions for summary judgment. \n5  II.  LEGAL STANDARD \n6  Under Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment is \n7  appropriate when: (1) the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material \n8  fact; and (2) after viewing the evidence most favorably to the non-moving party, the \n9  movant is entitled to prevail as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56; Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, \n10  477 U.S. 317, 322โ23 (1986); Eisenberg v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., 815 F.2d 1285, 1288โ89 \n11  (9th Cir. 1987). Under this standard, โ[o]nly disputes over facts that might affect the \n12  outcome of the suit under governing [substantive] law will properly preclude the entry of \n13  summary judgment.โ  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). A \n14  โgenuine issueโ of material fact arises only โif the evidence is such that a reasonable jury \n15  could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.โ Id. \n16  In considering a motion for summary judgment, the court must regard as true the \n17  non-moving partyโs evidence, if it is supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material. \n18  Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324; Eisenberg, 815 F.2d at 1289. However, the non-moving party \n19  may not merely rest on its pleadings; it must produce some significant probative evidence \n20  tending to contradict the moving partyโs allegations, thereby creating a material question \n21  of fact. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 256โ57 (holding that the plaintiff must present affirmative \n22  evidence in order to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment); First Natโl \n23  Bank of Ariz. v. Cities Serv. Co., 391 U.S. 253, 289 (1968). \n24  โA summary judgment motion cannot be defeated by relying solely on conclusory \n25  allegations unsupported by factual data.โ Taylor v. List, 880 F.2d 1040, 1045 (9th Cir. \n26  1989). โSummary judgment must be entered โagainst a party who fails to make a showing \n27  sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that partyโs case, and on \n28 \n \n- 6 - \n\n  Case 2:18-cv-02778-JJT   Document 336   Filed 02/07/22   Page 7 of 34\n \n \n \n1  which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.โ United States v. Carter, 906 F.2d \n2  1375, 1376 (9th Cir. 1990) (quoting Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322). \n3  III.  ANALYSIS \n4    A.  Class Claims \n5    The Court begins by determining whether a genuine dispute of material fact exists \n6  with regard to Plaintiffsโ class claims. Plaintiffs bring class claims against individual PPD \n7  officers and the City under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, alleging that the use of chemical agents \n8  violated class membersโ First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  โA plaintiff may \n9  bring an action under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 to redress violations of his โrights, privileges, or \n10  immunities secured by the Constitution and [federal] lawsโ by a person or entity, including \n11  a municipality, acting under color of state law.โ Awabdy v. City of Adelanto, 368 F.3d 1062, \n12  1066 (9th Cir. 2004) (citing Monell v. Depโt of Social Servs. of the City of N.Y., 436 U.S. \n13  658, 690โ95 (1978)). To succeed in a claim against an officer, the class must prove that \n14  the officerโs conduct โwas the actionable cause of the claimed injury,โ which includes \n15  โboth causation-in-fact and proximate causation.โ Harper v. City of Los Angeles, 533 F.3d \n16  1010, 1026 (9th Cir. 2008). \n17      1.  Excessive Force \n18    First, Plaintiffs, on behalf of the class, claim that PPDโs use of chemical agents \n19  without sufficient warning on protestors who neither threw objects nor attempted to breach \n20  the free speech zone barrier along Monroe Street was an excessive use of force constituting \n21  a violation of the class membersโ Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment substantive due \n22  process rights. (Compl., Counts 1 and 3.) \n23        a.  Class Claims Against Individual Defendants \n24    โQualified immunity shields an official from damages in a civil suit unless the \n25  plaintiff can make the showing that the officialโs actions violated a constitutional right, and \n26  that the right was โclearly establishedโ at the time of the violative conduct.โ Nelson v. City \n27  of Davis, 685 F.3d 867, 875 (9th Cir. 2012) (citing Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, \n28 \n \n- 7 - \n\n  Case 2:18-cv-02778-JJT   Document 336   Filed 02/07/22   Page 8 of 34\n \n \n \n1  818 (1982)). โTo survive the defendantโs invocation of qualified immunity, the plaintiff \n2  must succeed on both prongs.โ Id. \n3          i.  Constitutional Right at Issue \n4    With regard to whether individual PPD officersโ use of force was unconstitutionally \n5  excessive, the parties dispute whether the Fourth or Fourteenth Amendment applies, the \n6  resolution of which turns on whether the officers seized the class members. โA person is \n7  seized by the police and thus entitled to challenge the governmentโs action under the Fourth \n8  Amendment when the officer, by means of physical force or show of authority, terminates \n9  or restrains his freedom of movement through means intentionally applied.โ Brendlin v. \n10  California, 551 U.S. 249, 254 (2007) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Any such \n11  seizure is unconstitutional only if it is unreasonable.  Nelson, 685 F.3d at 878. โThe \n12  โreasonablenessโ of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a \n13  reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.โ Graham v. \n14  Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 396 (1989). The inquiry is thus โwhether the officersโ actions are \n15  โobjectively reasonableโ in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them.โ Id. at \n16  397. To resolve this question, a court must balance โthe nature and quality of the intrusion \n17  on the individualโs Fourth Amendment interests against the countervailing governmental \n18  interests at stake.โ Id. at 396. \n19    In contrast, the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of substantive due process, which \n20  still applies to police action even if it did not occur โin the course of an arrest, investigatory \n21  stop, or other seizure,โ id. at 395, requires a court to determine whether officersโ conduct \n22  โshocks the conscience,โ County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 854 (1988).  \n23  Where  actual  deliberation  is  practical,  then  an  officerโs  โdeliberate \nindifferenceโ may suffice to shock the conscience. On the other hand, where \n24 \na law enforcement officer makes a snap judgment because of an escalating \n25  situation, his conduct may only be found to shock the conscience if he acts \nwith a purpose to harm unrelated to legitimate law enforcement objectives. \n26 \nFor example, a purpose to harm might be found where an officer uses force \n27  to bully a suspect or โget even.โ \n28  Wilkinson v. Torres, 610 F.3d 546, 554 (9th Cir. 2010) (internal citations omitted).  \n \n- 8 - \n\n  Case 2:18-cv-02778-JJT   Document 336   Filed 02/07/22   Page 9 of 34\n \n \n \n1    At issue, then, is whether the officers seized class members by deploying inert \n2  smoke and CS gas to keep the crowd from entering Monroe Street and ultimately disperse \n3  the crowd, such that the Fourth Amendment standard applies to the officersโ conduct. \n4  Defendants argue that the officersโ use of chemical munitions was not a seizure because it \n5  did not result in class membersโ belief that they were โnot free to leave,โ but rather that \n6  they were โnot free to stay.โ (DMSJ #1 at 7 (citing Michigan v. Chesternut, 486 U.S. 567, \n7  573 (1988) (holding a seizure occurs if a person believes he or she is โnot free to leaveโ)).) \n8    The cases Plaintiffs cite from the Supreme Court and within the Ninth Circuit in \n9  support  of  their  argument  that  class  members  were  seized  by  Defendants  are \n10  distinguishable from the present one. In Brendlin, the Supreme Court held that seizure does \n11  not require a formal arrest, but rather a person is seized during a traffic stop if the person \n12  does not believe he or she is free to โterminate the encounterโ with the police. 551 U.S. at \n13  257. As Defendants argue, the opposite occurred here, and Plaintiffs present no evidence \n14  that class members did not feel free to terminate the encounter with Defendants. \n15  In Nelson, police officers fired pepper balls at a group of confined partygoers, \n16  striking the plaintiff in the eye and causing him to collapse and lie on the ground for ten to \n17  fifteen minutes. 685 F.3d at 874. The Ninth Circuit made clear that the plaintiff was โhit \n18  by a projectile that [officers] intentionally fired towards a group of which [the plaintiff] \n19  was a member,โ which was โthe application of physical force to [the plaintiffโs] person as \n20  well as the termination of his movement,โ constituting a seizure. Id. at 877. The court relied \n21  on the facts that the officers acted intentionally in firing the shots and that the plaintiff was \n22  hit and thereby immobilized. Id. Contrary to Plaintiffsโ insinuation in their brief (Pls.โ Resp. \n23  #1 at 10), the Nelson court did not state that the plaintiff would have been seized had he \n24  not been hit and immobilized. Rather, the court emphasized the plaintiff was hit, through \n25  intentional conduct of the officers, even if they intended โto impact his body elsewhereโ or \n26  โonly to spray him with [the projectileโs] contents.โ Id. But, in contrast to the present case, \n27  the result of that intentional use of force was a โtermination of freedom of movement.โ Id. \n28  at 876. The Court finds the other cases cited by Plaintiffs no more applicable to the present \n \n- 9 - \n\n  Case 2:18-cv-02778-JJT   Document 336   Filed 02/07/22   Page 10 of 34\n \n \n \n1  case. E.g., Villanueva v. California, 986 F.3d 1158, 1166 (9th Cir. 2021) (finding an \n2  officerโs action of shooting at a truck to stop its movement to be a Fourth Amendment \n3  seizure); Hamilton v. City of Olympia, 687 F. Supp. 2d 1231 (W.D. Wash. 2009) (finding \n4  an officerโs application of pepper spray to the plaintiffโs face, temporarily blinding him, \n5  โterminatedโ the plaintiffโs freedom of movement). \n6  In further support of their Fourth Amendment argument, Plaintiffs cite a case from \n7  outside the Ninth Circuit in which the court concluded that the use of tear gas to attempt to \n8  get reporters covering a protest to disperse was a seizure. Quraishi v. St. Charles Cnty., \n9  Mo., 2019 WL 2423321, at *9 (E.D. Mo. June 10, 2019). But on appeal, the Eighth Circuit \n10  recently reversed the District Court on this point because โthe reportersโ freedom to move \n11  was not terminated or restrictedโ by the deployment of tear gas in front of them such that \n12  they did not believe they were free to leave. Quraishi v. St. Charles Cnty., Mo., 986 F.3d \n13  831, 840 (8th Cir. 2021). That court also noted that, to the extent contrary case law from \n14  the Sixth Circuit exists, the Fourth Amendment law in this area was at minimum not clearly \n15  established, which itself entitled the officer to qualified immunity. Id. In an out-of-circuit \n16  case cited by Defendants, eleven plaintiffs encountered tear gas deployed by police officers \n17  that neither restrained nor prevented them from dispersing, and the court found the officersโ \n18  use of tear gas did not constitute a seizure under the Fourth Amendment because the \n19  plaintiffsโ freedom of movement was not terminated. Buck v. City of Albuquerque, 2007 \n20  WL 9734037, at *31 (D.N.M. Apr. 11, 2017). The Court finds this case akin to Buck and \n21  finds its reasoning persuasive as applied to the facts of this case and the class membersโ \n22  claims. \n23  Here,  no  evidence  demonstrates  that  a  termination  of  freedom  of  movement \n24  occurred among class members resulting from the officersโ use of chemical agents. The \n25  Court notes that, in certifying the class, it found that the claims of Plaintiffs hit and \n26  potentially  immobilized  by  projectiles  were  too  individualized,  precluding  class \n27  certification on those claims. Thus, to the extent Plaintiffs argue Defendants used force by \n28  way of hitting certain Plaintiffs with projectiles to terminate their freedom of movementโ\n \n- 10 - \n\n  Case 2:18-cv-02778-JJT   Document 336   Filed 02/07/22   Page 11 of 34\n \n \n \n1  more akin to Nelsonโthe claims predicated on that use of force are individual, not class, \n2  claims, which the Court will examine when it turns to Plaintiffsโ individual claims below. \n3  Accordingly, as urged by Defendants, the Court will apply the standard for a \n4  violation of the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of substantive due process, and not for \n5  a seizure under the Fourth Amendment, in examining the officersโ use of chemical agents \n6  as applied to the class members.3 See Am. Fedโn of Labor & Cong. of Indus. Orgs. v. City \n7  of Miami, Fla., 637 F.3d 1178, 1190โ91 (11th Cir. 2011) (finding that police officersโ acts \n8  of forcing the plaintiff off Biscayne Boulevard and deploying tear gas to which the plaintiff \n9  was exposed was not a seizure under the Fourth Amendment because โshe still had the \n10  ability to, and indeed did, walk awayโ). \n11        ii.  Evidence of Purpose to Harm \n12  As stated above, under the Fourteenth Amendment, โwhere a law enforcement \n13  officer makes a snap judgment because of an escalating situation, his conduct may only be \n14  found to shock the conscience if he acts with a purpose to harm unrelated to legitimate law \n15  enforcement objectives.โ Wilkinson, 610 F.3d at 554. Although Plaintiffs argue that the \n16  evidence showsโor at least that there is a genuine dispute of material factโthat the PPD \n17  officers had time to deliberate before they acted, subjecting the evaluation of their conduct \n18  to the less rigorous โdeliberate indifferenceโ standard, the Court finds that the evidence \n19  indisputably demonstrates a lack of time to deliberate in an escalating security situation. \n20  To begin with, protestors and rally attendees began arriving at 11:00 a.m. on the \n21  morning of the rally, and thousands of people were present in the area by 6:30 p.m. \n22  Throughout the course of the day and while the rally was taking place inside the Convention \n23  Center, no breaches of the pedestrian fencing and โDo Not Crossโ tape on Monroe Street \n24  occurred and the officers did not take any substantial action to limit the crowdโs activity or \n25  expression. The series of events upon which the class membersโ claims are principally \n \n26 \n3 Because the Court finds there is insufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could \nconclude the class members were seized, the Court need not and does not determine in the \n27 \nalternative whether Plaintiffs have raised a genuine dispute as to whether the officersโ use \nof force by way of deployment of chemical agents on class members was unreasonable \n28 \nunder the Fourth Amendment. \n \n- 11 - \n\n  Case 2:18-cv-02778-JJT   Document 336   Filed 02/07/22   Page 12 of 34\n \n \n \n1  predicated took place in less than five minutes beginning at 8:32 p.m., when members of \n2  Antifa appeared to attempt to breach the pedestrian fencing and penetrate the โDo Not Crossโ \n3  line. In response, Lt. Moore ordered the use of pepper balls targeted at a limited area where \n4  Antifa was located. The extensive video coverage of the protest provided as evidence by both \n5  sidesโwhich the Court has viewed in its entirety several timesโshows that protestors across \n6  a wide area of the crowd then began throwing a large variety of objects at the officers and, \n7  in response, Lt. Moore ordered the deployment of inert smoke at 8:34 p.m. When the crowd \n8  continued to shower objects on the officersโincluding a spear-like object, an incendiary \n9  device, rocks, and water bottlesโas well as kick canisters at the officers, Lt. Moore ordered \n10  the deployment of CS gas at 8:35 or 8:36 p.m. \n11  From the evidence, no reasonable jury could conclude that Lt. Moore had time to \n12  deliberate prior to acting in response to the sudden, violent turn of events. And he had to \n13  make his decisions keeping in mind not only the safety of the officers and the public but \n14  also the security of the Presidentโs motorcade. He thus was required to make โsnap \n15  judgmentsโ  because  of  an  โescalating  situation.โ  Wilkinson,  610  F.3d  at  554.  As \n16  Defendants point out, the facts here are quite similar to those in Porter v. Osborn, 546 F.3d \n17  1131, 1139 (9th Cir. 2008), in which officers and a motorist had a โfive-minute altercationโ \n18  that presented โan evolving set of circumstancesโ requiring โfast actionsโ and consideration \n19  of โobligations that tend to tug against each other.โ Id.  \n20  Plaintiffs argue that PPD had a week to prepare for the rally, was familiar with \n21  Antifaโs tactics before the rally, and deployed the TRU well before the situation escalated, \n22  all giving PPD time to deliberate. But there is unquestionably a distinct difference between \n23  preparation and contingency planning, on one hand, and split-second reactions to an \n24  escalating security situation, on the other. Simply because PPD tried to prepare in advance \n25  for any situation does not mean it had time to deliberate before making its decisions to \n26  react to a sudden escalation in crowd violence beginning at 8:32 p.m. See id. at 1140 (noting \n27  that โonce [the driverโs] evasive actions began the officers had to react quickly,โ and \n28  โwhether [the defendant officerโs] conduct shocks the conscience must be evaluated under \n \n- 12 - \n\n  Case 2:18-cv-02778-JJT   Document 336   Filed 02/07/22   Page 13 of 34\n \n \n \n1  the purpose to harm standard of culpabilityโ). The Court thus finds that Lt. Moore and the \n2  officers did not have time to deliberate before deploying chemical agents. \n3  Accordingly,  under  the  Fourteenth  Amendment,  the  Court  must  determine  if \n4  Plaintiffs have demonstrated a genuine issue of fact as to whether the officers acted โwith \n5  a purpose to harm [class members] unrelated to legitimate law enforcement objectives.โ \n6  Wilkinson, 610 F.3d at 554. Plaintiffs argue that a jury could find that the officersโ actions \n7  were โso grossly and unreasonably excessiveโ that they showed a purpose to harm, and \n8  that other evidence also points to a purpose to harm class members. (Pls.โ Resp. #1 at 18 \n9  (citing Nehad v. Browder, 929 F.3d 1125, 1139โ40 (9th Cir. 2019) (use of force that is \n10  โgrossly and unreasonably excessiveโ can be evidence of purpose to harm); Foster v. City \n11  of Indio, 908 F.3d 1204, 1211 (9th Cir. 2018) (finding a purpose to harm unrelated to \n12  legitimate law enforcement objectives when force was used against a clearly harmless \n13  suspect)).)  \n14  The Court disagrees that the evidence is sufficient for Plaintiffs to make such a \n15  showing. Beginning  with Plaintiffsโ  โotherโ evidence,  Plaintiffs  first point to  certain \n16  grenadiersโ possession of a challenge coinโa coin โproduced by different law enforcement \n17  agencies to commemorate events and collected by officersโ (PSOF ยถ 109)โthat was \n18  produced after the events of August 22, 2017. This particular challenge coin depicts one of \n19  the protestorsโwho by definition is not a class member hereโwho threw and kicked \n20  objects at police officers and who officers ultimately hit with a munition in the lower \n21  abdomen. The altercation was caught on live news video, which was broadcast by news \n22  outlets and instantly became popular on the internet. Multiple products were made for \n23  purchase as a result, including the challenge coin in question with a depiction of the \n24  protestor and the phrase โGood Night Left Nutโ on the front of the coin and โMaking \n25  America Great Again One Nut at a Timeโ and โPhoenix, AZ, August 22, 2017โ on the \n26  back.  (See  generally  DCSOF  ยถยถ  129โ151.)  No  evidence  in  the  record  suggests  any \n27  Defendant participated in the creation of the coin, although four grenadiers in the PPD \n28  possess it and Sgt. McBride posted an image of it on Facebook. While possessing this coin \n \n- 13 - \n\n  Case 2:18-cv-02778-JJT   Document 336   Filed 02/07/22   Page 14 of 34\n \n \n \n1  commemorating the injury of a protestor is unseemly at best, it is not sufficiently probative \n2  of purpose to harm class members at the time of the protest, particularly because the coin \n3  was produced and sold by a third party after the protest. \n4  Plaintiffs also proffer a PowerPoint slide used in PPD TRU training that depicted a \n5  leader of one of the Plaintiff organizations in handcuffs, which Plaintiffs also suggest is \n6  probative of purpose to harm. But no corroborating evidence in the record suggests the \n7  image intentionally depicted the particular person or that the creator or viewers of the image \n8  even knew who the person in the image was. This, too, has little to no probative value in \n9  assessing whether Defendants had purpose to harm class members at the time of the protest. \n10  Cf. Jurkowski v. City of Seattle, 2017 WL 4472859, at *12 (W.D. Wash. Oct. 5, 2017) \n11  (noting the use of an image of young black men beating up a white person in a Powerpoint \n12  training presentation was of an anti-violence character and not sufficient proof of intent to \n13  inhibit speech of the defendants at a later protest). \n14  The Court has reviewed the voluminous evidence proffered by the parties in its \n15  entirety and finds that no reasonable jury could conclude that the force Defendants used in \n16  response to Antifaโs attempt to breach the โDo Not Crossโ line and the subsequent, sudden \n17  escalation in violence by protestors was so grossly and unreasonably excessive that it \n18  shocks the conscience and shows a purpose to harm class members rather than a legitimate \n19  law enforcement purpose. Lt Mooreโs decision at 8:32 p.m. to deploy pepper balls in the \n20  limited area occupied by Antifa members after their attempted breach was unquestionably \n21  related to a legitimate law enforcement objective.4  \n22  As violence escalatedโthe protest was indisputably no longer โlargely peaceful,โ \n23  as Plaintiffs contendโthe evidence shows Lt. Moore directed officers to warn civilian \n24  contacts in the crowd to stop unlawful activity, and as objects continued to fly toward \n25  officers, Lt. Moore requested a helicopter, which was delayed for security reasons. At \n26 \n \n4 Moreover, the 8:32 p.m. deployment of pepper balls does not pertain to class members to \n27 \nthe extent the deployment was limited to individuals who โattempted to breach the โfree \nspeech zoneโ barrier along Monroe Street,โ which individuals are explicitly excluded from \n28 \nthe class. \n \n- 14 - \n\n  Case 2:18-cv-02778-JJT   Document 336   Filed 02/07/22   Page 15 of 34\n \n \n \n1  8:34 p.m., he directed the grenadiers to deploy inert smoke to act as an additional warning \n2  for protestors to stop unlawful activity. None of this evidence demonstrates a purpose to \n3  harm in the deployment of inert smoke, and Plaintiffs proffer no probative evidence to the \n4  contrary. \n5  Finally, the evidence shows that individuals over a wide area in the crowd continued \n6  to hurl objects, including throwing and kicking canisters and throwing an incendiary device \n7  and spear-like object at the officers, and grenadiers deployed CS gas at 8:34 or 8:35 p.m. \n8  Again, no evidence points to a purpose to harm class members where the legitimate law \n9  enforcement objective was unquestionable. See Meggs v. City of Berkeley, 246 F. Appโx \n10  402, 403 (9th Cir. 2007) (affirming summary judgment dismissing claim that โuse of force \n11  to repel [the plaintiffs] from the skirmish lineโ shocked the conscience); Jurkowski, 2017 \n12  WL 4472859, at *7โ8 (granting summary judgment for police officers on claim that police \n13  officersโ use of โblast ball deploymentโ shocked the conscience where the deployment was \n14  aimed at protestors blocking the street and throwing rocks, wrenches, traffic cones, and at \n15  least one incendiary device at officers). \n16  In sum, because Plaintiffs have not met their burden to show a genuine issue of \n17  material fact as to whether the individual Defendants violated the class membersโ Fourth \n18  or Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process rights, the individual Defendants are \n19  entitled to qualified immunity for their actions with respect to class members on August 22, \n20  2017. \n21        b.  Municipal Liability \n22  The class also raises ยง 1983 claims against the City. In Monell, the Supreme Court \n23  held that a municipality is not liable for ยง 1983 claims under a theory of respondeat \n24  superior. 436 U.S. at 694. Instead, a plaintiff must show that the municipality has adopted \n25  an โofficial policyโ or โcustomโ that caused the alleged constitutional violation, โwhether \n26  made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent \n27  official policy.โ Id. โThe โofficial policyโ requirement was intended to distinguish acts of \n28  the municipality from acts of employees of the municipality, and thereby make clear that \n \n- 15 - \n\n  Case 2:18-cv-02778-JJT   Document 336   Filed 02/07/22   Page 16 of 34\n \n \n \n1  municipal liability is limited to actions for which the municipality is actually responsible.โ \n2  Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469, 479 (1986) (quoting Monell, 436 U.S. at 694). \n3  As  Plaintiffs  cannot  show  the  class  membersโ  Fourth  or  Fourteenth  Amendment \n4  substantive due process rights were violated, the related class claims against the City fail \n5  as well. \n6  Because no reasonable jury could conclude from the evidence that class members \n7  were seized under the Fourth Amendment, or that Defendantsโ use of force shocks the \n8  conscience in violation of class membersโ Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process \n9  rights, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on the class claims of excessive use \n10  of force (Counts 1 and 3). This conclusion naturally leads to the further conclusion that the \n11  class requests for injunctive relief and punitive damages on the same basis also fail. \n12      2.  Free Speech \n13    Plaintiffs on behalf of the class next claim that PPDโs actions on August 22, 2017, \n14  violated their First Amendment rights of freedom of speech, assembly, and association, \n15  which were clearly established at the time, entitling the class to damages under ยง 1983. \n16  (Compl., Count 2.) The individual Defendants again claim they are entitled to qualified \n17  immunity on those claims, which again โshields an official from damages in a civil suit \n18  unless the plaintiff can make the showing that the officialโs actions violated a constitutional \n19  right, and that the right was โclearly establishedโ at the time of the violative conduct.โ \n20  Nelson, 685 F.3d at 875. \n21    With regard to the standard the Court should apply in determining whether the \n22  officers violated class membersโ First Amendment rights, Defendants urge the Court to \n23  apply the following Ninth Circuit Model Civil Jury Instruction, a standard Plaintiffs also \n24  recited to the Court in their Case Management Report (Doc. 43 at 8): \n25   \nTo prevail under the First Amendment against a particular defendant, the \n26 \nclass must prove the following elements: \n27 \n(1) The class members were in engaged in constitutionally protected activity; \n28 \n \n- 16 - \n\n  Case 2:18-cv-02778-JJT   Document 336   Filed 02/07/22   Page 17 of 34\n \n \n \n(2) The defendant took action that would chill a person of ordinary firmness \n1 \nfrom continuing to engage in the protected activity; and \n2 \n(3)  Chilling  the  class  membersโ  protected  activity  was  a  substantial  or \n3  motivating factor in the defendantโs conduct. \n4  (DMSJ #1 at 9 (citing Ninth Circuit Civil Jury Instruction No. 9.11).) This is also the \n5  standard  the  Court  applied  in  its  class  certification  Order.  (Doc.  191  at  10  (citing \n6  Mendocino Envtl. Ctr. v. Mendocino Cnty., 192 F.3d 1283, 1300 (9th Cir. 1999)).) \n7    Plaintiffs now dispute the use of this standard as applied to their claims because they \n8  โdo not assert a retaliation claim.โ (Pls.โ Resp. #1 at 19.) Instead, they rely on a Second \n9  Circuit case to urge the Court to focus not on whether evidence exists that chilling class \n10  membersโ First Amendment rights was a substantial or motivating factor causing the \n11  officersโ  conduct, but rather  whether the  officers  had adequate justification for their \n12  conduct, which Plaintiffs contend can only arise from a โclear and present danger of riot, \n13  imminent violence, interference with traffic or other immediate threat to public safety.โ \n14  (PMSJ at 21 (quoting Jones v. Parmley, 465 F.3d 46, 57 (2d Cir. 2006)).) \n15    The Court agrees with Defendants (Defs.โ Resp. at 9โ12) that Plaintiffsโ reading of \n16  Jones  is  overly  broad  and  inapplicable  to  the  circumstances  here.  In  Cantwell  v. \n17  Connecticut, upon which the Jones court relied, the Supreme Court resolved the question \n18  of when a government may arrest someone for engaging in speech and effectively ban \n19  speech.  310 U.S. 296, 300โ03 (1940) (holding that the arrest of peaceful  Jehovahโs \n20  witnesses going door-to-door exceeded the First Amendment limitations on the stateโs \n21  power to regulate speech). The very different question presented in this case, as well-\n22  formulated by Defendants, is when an officer may disperse a group when some but not all \n23  of the group is violent or poses a threat. (Defs.โ Resp. at 11.) The Court concludes that, in \n24  instances such as this one, a plaintiff must demonstrate the defendantโs intent to chill \n25  speech. See Barney v. City of Eugene, 20 F. Appโx 683, 685 (9th Cir. 2001); Jurkowski, \n26  2017 WL 4472859, at *12โ13.  \n27    Under either formulation, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated  a genuine issue of \n28  material fact going to whether the officersโ conduct violated the class membersโ First \n \n- 17 - \n\n  Case 2:18-cv-02778-JJT   Document 336   Filed 02/07/22   Page 18 of 34\n \n \n \n1  Amendment rights. As Defendants point out and the Court alluded to above in examining \n2  whether the officers  exhibited  a purpose to harm under the Fourteenth Amendment, \n3  Plaintiffs  have  not  produced  probative  evidence  that  chilling  class  membersโ  First \n4  Amendment rights was a substantial or motivating factor that caused the officers to take \n5  the actions they did. (DMSJ #1 at 9 (citing Nieves v. Bartlett, 139 S. Ct. 1715, 1722 (2019); \n6  Dietrich v. John Ascuagaโs Nugget, 548 F.3d 892, 900โ01 (9th Cir. 2008)).) Indeed, the \n7  evidence shows that the demonstrations took place for many hours over the course of the \n8  day and officers took no substantial action to limit protestorsโ speech or assembly; only \n9  when violence erupted did officers deploy chemical agents. The facts thus do not support \n10  a finding of Defendantsโ intent to chill class membersโ First Amendment rights. \n11    As for Plaintiffsโ โclear and present dangerโ formulation, Plaintiffs first contend that \n12  the officers here are subject to First Amendment liability because, by deploying chemical \n13  agents,  they  prevented  peaceful  protestors  from  continuing  to  express  themselves  in \n14  reaction to the unprotected activities of a few protestors (โat most twenty peopleโ). (PMSJ \n15  at 21; Pls.โ Resp. #1 at 19.) Plaintiffs argue that this case lines up with the Ninth Circuitโs \n16  decision in Collins v. Jordan, 110 F.3d 1363, 1372โ73 (9th Cir. 1996), which addressed \n17  demonstrations that occurred in San Francisco after the Rodney King trial verdicts. But in \n18  stating  that  officials  may  not  โsuppress  legitimate  First  Amendment  conduct  as  a \n19  prophylactic measure,โ the Ninth Circuit was addressing a situation in which officials \n20  prevented  demonstrations  based  on  prior  incidents  of  violence  and  the  actions  of \n21  demonstrators in a protest the day before. Id. That is not what occurred in this case. \n22    Instead, as the Court stated in its Fourteenth Amendment analysis, the evidenceโ\n23  including hours of videotapeโshows that Antifa members appeared to attempt to breach \n24  the pedestrian fence and โDo Not Crossโ tape onto Monroe Street at 8:32 p.m., and the \n25  officers took a limited, targeted action against those members in response. Only after \n26  protestors  from  across  the  free  speech  zone  showered  officers  with  projectiles  did \n27  Lt. Moore order deployment of, first, inert smoke as a warning to disperse, followed by CS \n28  gas a few minutes later, when no de-escalation of violence occurred. From the evidence, a \n \n- 18 - \n\n  Case 2:18-cv-02778-JJT   Document 336   Filed 02/07/22   Page 19 of 34\n \n \n \n1  reasonable jury could only conclude under Plaintiffsโ formulation that there was โa clear \n2  and present danger of riot, imminent violence, interference with traffic or other immediate \n3  threat to public safety.โ See Jones, 465 F.3d at 57. \n4    Plaintiffs also argue that the First Amendment requires a dispersal order before \n5  police may disperse a crowd with chemical agents, and the officersโ failure to effectively \n6  announce a dispersal order was itself a First Amendment violation. (PMSJ at 23โ25; Pls.โ \n7  Reply at 13.) The Court again agrees with Defendants that the applicable case law does not \n8  support that proposition. (Defs.โ Resp. at 12โ14.) All of the cases and the statute upon \n9  which Plaintiffs rely for the theory that a First Amendment violation occurs when a crowd \n10  is dispersed without a warning or dispersal order are in the context of arrests. See Vodak v. \n11  City of Chicago, 639 F.3d 738, 745 (7th Cir. 2011) (stating that โbefore the police could \n12  start arresting peaceable demonstrators for defying their orders they had to communicate \n13  the orders to the demonstratorsโ (emphasis added)); Garcia v. Does, 779 F.3d 84, 94 n.11 \n14  (2d Cir. 2015) (stating that Jones, upon which Plaintiffs rely here, held that officers could \n15  not indiscriminately arrest peaceful protestors without an order to disperse). No case \n16  provides that a failure to issue a dispersal order in the absence of arrests constitutes a per \n17  se First Amendment violation, and the Court will not so declare here. \n18  In sum, Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact as to \n19  whether chilling class membersโ First Amendment rights was a substantial or motivating \n20  factor that caused the officers to take the actions they did, and the Court also finds (in \n21  Plaintiffsโ  alternative  formulation)  that  no  reasonable  jury  could  conclude  from  the \n22  evidence that the officers did not have adequate justification for their actions. As a result, \n23  the individual Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity for their actions with respect \n24  to class members on August 22, 2017. Because Plaintiffs cannot show the class membersโ \n25  First Amendment rights were violated, the related class claims against the City fail as well. \n26  Defendants are thus entitled to summary judgment on the class-wide ยง 1983 claim of \n27  violation of the rights of speech and association under the First Amendment (Count 2). In \n28  addition, although Plaintiffs did not explicitly request class certification on their claim of \n \n- 19 - \n\n  Case 2:18-cv-02778-JJT   Document 336   Filed 02/07/22   Page 20 of 34\n \n \n \n1  an Equal Protection violation under the Fourteenth Amendment (Count 4), that claim fails \n2  with Plaintiffsโ First Amendment claim. See OSU Student Alliance v. Ray, 699 F.3d 1053, \n3  1067 (9th Cir. 2012). For all these reasons, the Court will grant Defendantsโ Motion for \n4  Summary  Judgment  as  to  Plaintiffsโ  Classwide  Claims  (redacted  Doc.  271,  sealed \n5  Doc. 276). \n6  B.  Individual Claims \n7    The Court now turns to the claims brought by the six Plaintiffs on an individual \n8  basis. To begin with, the Court finds that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on \n9  the claims of Gonzalez Goodman and the two organizations, Puente and Poder, because \n10  the evidence related to their claims does not go materially further than that pertaining to \n11  the class members, as limited by the class definitions, and the Court already found that \n12  evidence to be insufficient, above. With regard to Plaintiffsโ argument that Puente and \n13  Poder have associational standing to bring claims on behalf of their members (Pls.โ Resp. \n14  #2 at 12), Plaintiffs do not satisfy the third prong of the test announced in  Hunt v. \n15  Washington State Apple Advertising Commission, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977). Although \n16  participation of individual members in this lawsuit may not be required by the injunctive \n17  relief requested, it is required in terms of the substance of the remaining claims that would \n18  be  asserted  by  Puente  and  Poder.  The  Court  thus  examines  whether  the  remaining \n19  PlaintiffsโYedlin, Travis, and Guillenโhave raised at least a genuine issue of material \n20  fact as to their claims. \n21      1.  Excessive Force \n22    Unlike the claims of the class members, discussed above, the evidence shows that \n23  the three remaining Plaintiffs all were seized within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. \n24  After Yedlin inhaled PAVA powder from the grenadiersโ initial deployment of pepper balls \n25  in the area where Antifa members were standing, he shook the fence and the grenadiers \n26  aimed pepper balls at him, hitting him five timesโin the face, lower back, and three times \n27  on the legs. Travis stopped in front of a skirmish line of officers to take a photograph, and \n28  when she turned, a grenadier hit her with a muzzle blast and multiple officers barraged her \n \n- 20 - \n\n  Case 2:18-cv-02778-JJT   Document 336   Filed 02/07/22   Page 21 of 34\n \n \n \n1  with pepper spray. As other protestors helped her away, a grenadier hit her with another \n2  muzzle blast. Guillen made a video as protestors fled after grenadiers had deployed \n3  chemical agents, and then remained in the area with other protestors until 8:50 p.m., when \n4  she was hit by a muzzle blast. While Defendants contend all three Plaintiffs could still walk \n5  after they were hit by munitions, their freedom of movement was affected by the officersโ \n6  intentional  actions,  which  the  Court  finds  constituted  a  seizure  under  the  Fourth \n7  Amendment. Brendlin, 551 U.S. at 254 (โA person is seized by the police and thus entitled \n8  to challenge the governmentโs action under the Fourth Amendment when the officer, by \n9  means of physical force or show of authority, terminates or restrains his freedom of \n10  movement through means intentionally applied.โ); see also Nelson, 685 F.3d at 877. \n11    As the Court set forth above, the inquiry into whether the officersโ use of force \n12  during a Fourth Amendment seizure was excessive is subject to a reasonableness test. โThe \n13  โreasonablenessโ of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a \n14  reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.โ Graham, \n15  490  U.S.  at  396.  The  inquiry  is  thus  โwhether  the  officersโ  actions  are  โobjectively \n16  reasonableโ in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them.โ Id. at 397. To resolve \n17  this  question,  a  court  must  balance  โthe  nature  and  quality  of  the  intrusion  on  the \n18  individualโs Fourth Amendment interests against the countervailing governmental interests \n19  at stake.โ Id. at 396. \n20    Genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment on these Plaintiffsโ \n21  Fourth Amendment claims (Compl., Count 1). On one hand, the government had a stake \n22  in ensuring, among other things, the safety of the public and the officers as well as the \n23  security of transportation routes in the downtown area. On the other hand, the officers used \n24  intermediate force in striking these Plaintiffs with pepper balls and muzzle blasts without \n25  apparent provocation beyond a failure to immediately disperse (and, in the case of Yedlin, \n26  shaking the pedestrian fencing). A jury must decide whether the officers used reasonable \n27  force in the circumstances, or whether they could have employed less forceful or intrusive \n28  means to accomplish the government goals in light of the circumstances they faced. See \n \n- 21 - \n\n  Case 2:18-cv-02778-JJT   Document 336   Filed 02/07/22   Page 22 of 34\n \n \n \n1  Nelson, 685 F.3d at 883; Young v. County of Los Angeles, 655 F.3d 1156, 1161 (9th Cir. \n2  2011). \n3      2.  Free Speech \n4    It is a closer question whether a genuine dispute of material fact exists with regard \n5  to the First Amendment claims of Yedlin, Travis, and Guillen. As the Court stated above, \n6  the standard used in the Ninth Circuit to evaluate whether officersโ conduct violated a \n7  plaintiffโs First Amendment rights in instances such as the one presented in this case \n8  includes a showing that chilling those rights was a substantial or motivating factor that \n9  caused the officers to take the actions they did. See Nieves, 139 S. Ct. at 1722; Dietrich, \n10  548 F.3d at 900โ01. To that end, Plaintiffsโ argument, in its entirety, is that โ[t]he additional \n11  facts as to the named Plaintiffs outlined above also raise factual issues about Defendantsโ \n12  desire to chill Plaintiffsโ speech.โ (Pls.โ Resp. #2 at 14.) In support, Plaintiffs cite facts \n13  going to the number of times officers hit Yedlin with pepper balls even though he did not \n14  appear to be part of Antifa; the number of protestors struck by pepper balls over the course \n15  of the evening; and evidence that a grenadier celebrated hitting Travis, that other officers \n16  then used pepper spray on her, and that they struck her again as she was helped away. \n17  (PCSOF ยถยถ 11, 14, 17, 21, 35โ37.)  \n18    All of these facts go to whether the officersโ conduct was reasonable under the \n19  Fourth Amendment, but they do not by themselves show that chilling Plaintiffsโ First \n20  Amendment rights was a substantial motivating factor for the officersโ actions, let alone \n21  that the officersโ intent to chill was a but-for cause of their actions. Otherwise, Plaintiffs \n22  have proffered evidence of the challenge coin and training slide, neither of which is \n23  sufficiently probative to the question, as discussed above. For these reasons, and because \n24  Plaintiffsโ  First  Amendment  claims  as  characterized  are  duplicative  of  their  Fourth \n25  Amendment claims, which will go to trial, the Court will grant summary judgment to \n26  Defendants on these Plaintiffsโ First Amendment claims (Compl., Count 2). See Vodak, \n27  639  F.3d  at  750โ51  (characterizing  protestorsโ  First  Amendment  claims  as  โlargely \n28  duplicativeโ of the Fourth Amendment claims and advising they โconfine their claims to \n \n- 22 - \n\n  Case 2:18-cv-02778-JJT   Document 336   Filed 02/07/22   Page 23 of 34\n \n \n \n1  the Fourth Amendmentโ). Relatedly, the Court grants summary judgment to Defendants \n2  on these Plaintiffsโ Equal Protection claims (Compl., Count 4). See OSU Student Alliance, \n3  699 F.3d at 1067. \n4      3.  Qualified Immunity \n5    As laid out above, qualified immunity shields an official from damages in a ยง 1983 \n6  action if the plaintiff shows that the officialโs conduct violated a constitutional right and \n7  that the right was โclearly establishedโ at the time of the conduct. Nelson, 685 F.3d at 875. \n8  To be clearly established, โ[t]he contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a \n9  reasonable official would understand that what [the official] is doing violates that right.โ \n10  Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987). Although a case need not be โdirectly \n11  on point, . . . existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question \n12  beyond debate.โ Ashcroft v. Al-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731, 741 (2011). When factual disputes \n13  exist, summary judgment is appropriate only if the defendant is entitled to qualified \n14  immunity under the facts most favorable to the plaintiff. Blankenhorn v. City of Orange, \n15  485 F.3d 463, 477โ78 (9th Cir. 2007). \n16     Because significant issues remain to be resolved at trial as to the reasonableness of \n17  the officersโ use of force on Yedlin, Travis, and Guillen, the Court looks at Plaintiffsโ \n18  claims regarding the officersโ conduct in the light most favorable to these Plaintiffs to \n19  determine if the right allegedly violated was clearly established at the time. The Court finds \n20  that Plaintiffsโ Fourth Amendment right not to be subjected to unreasonable force during a \n21  seizureโby way of the deployment pepper balls, muzzle blasts, and pepper sprayโwhere \n22  less severe or intrusive means of applying force were available and sufficient in the \n23  circumstances was a clearly established right at the time of the officersโ use of force. See, \n24  e.g., Nelson, 685 F.3d at 875. Defendants are thus not entitled to summary judgment on the \n25  issue of qualified immunity for these Plaintiffsโ Fourth Amendment claims. \n26      4.  Individual Officer Causation \n27    Defendants  argue  that  the  individual  Plaintiffsโ  claims  fail  against  individual \n28  Defendant officers because these Plaintiffs cannot identify which officer caused which \n \n- 23 - \n\n  Case 2:18-cv-02778-JJT   Document 336   Filed 02/07/22   Page 24 of 34\n \n \n \n1  injury, and to hold an officer liable, a plaintiff must show the officerโs conduct โwas the \n2  actionable cause of the claimed injury,โ including โboth causation-in-fact and proximate \n3  cause.โ Harper, 533 F.3d at 1026. โThe inquiry into causation must be individualized and \n4  focus  on  the  duties  and  responsibilities  of  each  individual  defendant  whose  acts  or \n5  omissions are alleged to have caused a constitutional violation.โ Leer v. Murphy, 844 F.2d \n6  628, 633 (9th Cir. 1988). \n7    Plaintiffsโ theory of individual officer liability rests on the principle of โintegral \n8  participation,โ which โdoes not require that each officerโs actions themselves rise to the \n9  level of a constitutional violationโ so long as the officer was aware of the decisions to use \n10  force and a participant in the concerted action to use it. Boyd v. Benton Cnty., 374 F.3d \n11  773, 780 (9th Cir. 2004). That is, an officer can be liable for a constitutional violation \n12  โwhere there is a showing of integral participation or personal involvement in the unlawful \n13  conduct, as opposed to mere presence on the scene.โ Bonivert v. City of Clarkston, 883 \n14  F.3d  865,  879  (9th  Cir.  2018)  (internal  quotations  and  citation  omitted);  see  also \n15  Blankenhorn, 485 F.3d at 481 & n.12. For example, in Boyd, the Ninth Circuit โrecognized \n16  that officers who provide armed backup, stand at the door with a gun while other officers \n17  conduct a search inside an apartment, and participate in the search operation are integral \n18  participants.โ Id. (citing Boyd, 374 F.3d at 780). \n19    Plaintiffs have pointed to evidence that clearly shows that the individual grenadiers \n20  named as Defendants were not bystanders, but participated in a coordinated TRU effort to \n21  disperse the crowd. From the evidence demonstrating the chaotic nature of the dispersal \n22  action, there is at least a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the individual \n23  grenadiers named as Defendants in the remaining three Plaintiffsโ Fourth Amendment \n24  claims either applied the force giving rise to Plaintiffsโ claimsโdeployment of pepper \n25  balls, muzzle blasts, and pepper sprayโor were aware of the decision to use that force and \n26  participated in a concerted action to use it. Specifically, Plaintiffs point to evidence that \n27  grenadiers Scott, Howell, and Herr participated in the deployment of pepper balls that hit \n28 \n \n- 24 - \n\n  Case 2:18-cv-02778-JJT   Document 336   Filed 02/07/22   Page 25 of 34\n \n \n \n1  Yedlin.5 (Pls.โ Resp. #2 at 15.) Likewise, they point to evidence that Turiano and Howell \n2  participated in the use of force against Travis, and Scott, Turiano, Howell, and Herr \n3  participated in the use of force against Guillen. (Pls.โ Resp. #2 at 15โ16.) There remain \n4  genuine issues as to whether  the grenadiers either deployed  the particular munitions \n5  themselves that hit Plaintiffs or were simply aware of the decisions to use a particular \n6  munition or combination of munitions against Plaintiffs; indeed, the parties dispute what \n7  munitions actually hit Plaintiffs, let alone who deployed them. (E.g., Pls.โ Resp. #2 at 16 \n8  n.3; Defs.โ Reply #2 at 9 n.6.) The Court thus will let stand these Plaintiffsโ Fourth \n9  Amendment claims against the named Defendant grenadiers, and the issues surrounding \n10  causation and integral participation will be resolved at trial. \n11      5.  Supervisor Liability \n12    Next,  Defendants  contend  that  Plaintiffsโ  evidence  is  insufficient  to  hold \n13  Sgt. McBride, Lt. Moore, and Chief Williams liable for any Fourth Amendment violations \n14  arising from the grenadiersโ acts in deploying munitions to disperse the crowd. In ยง 1983 \n15  actions, โeach Government official, his or her title notwithstanding, is only liable for his or \n16  her own conduct.โ Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 677 (2009). Thus, a supervisor may \n17  only be liable \n \n18 \nif  either  (1)  he  or  she  was  personally  involved  in  the  constitutional \n19  deprivation,  or  (2)  a  sufficient  causal  connection  exists  between  the \nsupervisorโs wrongful conduct and the constitutional violation. The requisite \n20 \ncausal connection can be established by setting in motion a series of acts by \n21  others, or by knowingly refusing to terminate a series of acts by others, which \nthe supervisor knew or reasonably should have known would cause others to \n22 \ninflict a constitutional injury. There is no respondeat superior liability under \n23  section 1983. Officers may not be held liable merely for being present at the \nscene  of  a  constitutional  violation  or  for  being  a  member  of  the  same \n24 \noperational unit as a wrongdoer. \n25 \nFelarca v. Birgeneau, 891 F.3d 809, 819โ20 (9th Cir. 2018) (internal quotations and \n26 \ncitations omitted). \n27 \n \n \n28 \n5 The Court addresses Sgt. McBrideโs participation in examining supervisor liability below. \n \n- 25 - \n\n  Case 2:18-cv-02778-JJT   Document 336   Filed 02/07/22   Page 26 of 34\n \n \n \n1        a.  Sgt. McBride \n2    Plaintiffs have proffered sufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude that \n3  Sgt. McBride โset in a motion a series of acts that [he] knew or reasonably should have \n4  known would cause the officers to inflict a constitutional injury.โ Id. at 820. First, the \n5  individual grenadiers  were in the chain of command of Sgt. McBride, who was the \n6  grenadier team leader. Second, the evidence shows that Sgt. McBride briefed grenadiers in \n7  advance to deploy pepper balls to respond to an attempted breach of the Do Not Cross \n8  barrier and, along with other grenadiers, he deployed multiple rounds of pepper balls \n9  toward Yedlin. (Pls.โ Resp. #1 at 26โ27; Pls.โ Resp. #2 at 14โ16.) Third, Sgt. McBride \n10  directed โarmed backupโ to the skirmish line, instructing โthe grenadiers to support the \n11  skirmish line as [they] moved the crowd.โ (Pls.โ Resp. #2 at 16 (citing PCSOF ยถยถ 39โ41).) \n12  Because the grenadiersโ use of munitions for an attempted breach and to support the \n13  skirmish line is at issue in Plaintiffsโ Fourth Amendment claims, and Sgt. Moore gave the \n14  orders to use that level of force, Sgt. Moore may be liable for his conduct under both \n15  theories of integral participation and supervisor liability. See Blankenhorn, 485 F.3d at 481 \n16  n.12, 485. \n17        b.  Lt. Moore \n18    Likewise, sufficient evidence exists from which a jury could find Lt. Moore liable \n19  for  his  actions.  The  grenadiers  were  in  Lt.  Mooreโs  chain  of  command  and,  like \n20  Sgt. McBride, Lt. Moore was on the ground authorizing the deployment of munitions that \n21  struck Plaintiffs, as Defendants acknowledge (DMSJ #1 at 24โ25; DMSJ #2 at 13). The \n22  constitutionality of that deployment in the circumstances is at issue, and Lt. Moore may be \n23  liable for his conduct under both theories of integral participation and supervisor liability. \n24  See id. \n25        c.   Chief Williams \n26    The same cannot be said for Chief Williams. Although the grenadiers, Lt. Moore, \n27  and Sgt. McBride were all in her chain of command, the evidence is not sufficient to \n28  demonstrate that she reasonably should have known that the actions she set in motionโby \n \n- 26 - \n\n  Case 2:18-cv-02778-JJT   Document 336   Filed 02/07/22   Page 27 of 34\n \n \n \n1  way of delegating the decision as to what level of force to apply to protestorsโwould cause \n2  officers to inflict constitutional injuries. See Felarca, 891 F.3d at 820. Moreover, Plaintiffs \n3  proffer  insufficient  evidence  to  support  a  conclusion  that  Chief  Williams  failed  to \n4  discipline the grenadiers in question for a prior excessive use of force, thereby condoning \n5  such use of force in the present circumstances, see Larez v. City of Los Angeles, 946 F.2d \n6  630,  646  (9th  Cir.  1991),  or  that  she  failed  to  adequately  train  the  grenadiers  with \n7  knowledge  that  without  training,  they  would  likely  violate  constitutional  rights,  see \n8  Clement v. Gomez, 298 F.3d 898, 905 (9th Cir. 2002). Finally, Plaintiffsโ contentions that \n9  Chief Williams was โin the vicinityโ and followed radio transmissions throughout the day \n10  but โdid not intervene in the decisions to deploy forceโ are too tenuous to be sufficient. See \n11  Felarca, 891 F.3d at 820โ21. Plaintiffs must show that Chief Williams knew or should \n12  have known that her general orders and delegation of decision-making would cause the \n13  grenadiers to use unconstitutionally excessive force against Plaintiffs in the particular \n14  circumstances the grenadiers were presented with on the ground, which Plaintiffsโ evidence \n15  does not demonstrate. Chief Williams is thus entitled to summary judgment on the claims \n16  against her. \n17      6.  Municipal Liability \n18  The parties cross-move for summary judgment on Plaintiffsโ ยง 1983 claims against \n19  the  City.  As  the  Court  stated  above,  under  Monell,  a  plaintiff  must  show  that  the \n20  municipality  has  adopted  an  โofficial  policyโ  or  โcustomโ  that  caused  the  alleged \n21  constitutional violation, โwhether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts \n22  may fairly be said to represent official policy.โ Id. โThe โofficial policyโ requirement was \n23  intended to distinguish acts of the municipality from acts of employees of the municipality, \n24  and  thereby  make  clear  that  municipal  liability  is  limited  to  actions  for  which  the \n25  municipality is actually responsible.โ Pembaur, 475 U.S. at 479 (1986) (quoting Monell, \n26  436 U.S. at 694). \n27  Official policy includes โdecisions of a governmentโs lawmakers,โ โacts of its \n28  policymaking officials,โ โpractices so persistent and widespread as to practically have the \n \n- 27 - \n\n  Case 2:18-cv-02778-JJT   Document 336   Filed 02/07/22   Page 28 of 34\n \n \n \n1  force of law,โ or a โdecision not to train certain employees about their legal duty to avoid \n2  violating citizensโ rightsโ where that decision amounted to โdeliberate indifferenceโ to \n3  citizensโ rights. Connick v. Thompson, 563 U.S. 51, 61 (2011) (citations omitted). An \n4  official policy must be the โmoving forceโ behind the constitutional injuries alleged by a \n5  plaintiff for a municipality to be liable. Bd. of Commโrs of Bryan Cnty., Okl. v. Brown, 520 \n6  U.S. 397, 404 (1997). โWhere a plaintiff claims that the municipality has not directly \n7  inflicted an injury, but nonetheless has caused an employee to do so, rigorous standards of \n8  culpability and causation must be applied to ensure that the municipality is not held liable \n9  solely for the actions of its employee.โ Id. at 405. \n10  Plaintiffs assert five theories of the Cityโs liability, which the Court now examines \n11  in turn. \n12      a.  Delegation of Policymaking Authority \n13  First, relying on Ulrich v. City and County of San Francisco, 308 F.3d 968, 986 (9th \n14  Cir. 2002), Plaintiffs contend that Chief Williams delegated final policymaking authority \n15  to Lt. Moore, so his decisions constituted City policy, making the City liable for them. \n16  (Pls.โ Resp. #1 at 28.) The Court agrees with Defendants (Defs.โ Resp. at 26โ27) that this \n17  claim has no merit. Under the City Code, Phoenix City Charter, Ch. III ยงยง 1, 2, Chief \n18  Williams is not the final policymaker; the City Council and City Manager are. See Christie \n19  v. Iopa, 176 F.3d 1231, 1235 (9th Cir. 1999) (โWhether an official has final policymaking \n20  authority is a question for the court to decide based on state law.โ) This alone defeats \n21  Plaintiffโs claim. See Ellins v. City of Sierra Madre, 710 F.3d 1049, 1066 (9th Cir. 2013). \n22  Moreover, even if Chief Williams had final policymaking authority to delegate, there is a \n23  distinct  difference  between  delegating  final  policymaking  authority  and  delegating \n24  โdiscretion to act,โ as she did. Christie, 176 F.3d at 1236. Otherwise, โthe result would be \n25  indistinguishable from respondeat superior liability.โ Id. (quoting City of St. Louis v. \n26  Praprotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 126 (1988)). And even if Chief Williams delegated decision-\n27  making to Lt. Moore, he was constrained by policies, discussed further below, and subject \n28  to  review  by  others.  Id.  For  these  reasons,  Chief  Williams  did  not  delegate  final \n \n- 28 - \n\n  Case 2:18-cv-02778-JJT   Document 336   Filed 02/07/22   Page 29 of 34\n \n \n \n1  policymaking authority to Lt. Moore or any other officer and the City is not liable on this \n2  basis. \n3      b.  Ratification \n4  Next, relying on Gillette v. Delmore, 979 F.2d 1342, 1346โ47 (9th Cir. 1992), \n5  Plaintiffs  argue  that  Chief  Williams  as  final  policymaker  ratified  subordinatesโ \n6  unconstitutional actions by โapplauding the officersโ conduct on numerous occasions,โ \n7  failing โto discipline officers for any of their relevant conduct,โ and failing โto implement \n8  her own departmentโs recommendations to update its policies on crowd control weapons.โ \n9  (Pls.โ Resp. #1 at 28โ29.) To begin with, Chief Williams is not the final policymaker, as \n10  the Court stated above, so this claim fails as well. Moreover, the actions Plaintiffs refer to \n11  occurred after the event, and thus could not have been the โmoving forceโ behind the \n12  grenadiersโ alleged unconstitutional acts. Bd. of Commโrs of Bryan Cnty., Okl., 520 U.S. \n13  at 404. To the extent Plaintiffs argue (Pls.โ Reply at 17โ18) that Chief Williams is liable \n14  for her own conductโwhich goes to supervisor liability, not municipal liabilityโthe Court \n15  already found Plaintiffsโ evidence insufficient for such a conclusion, above. Plaintiffsโ \n16  ratification theory thus fails. \n17      c.  Policies Related to Chemical Agent Deployment \n18  Plaintiffs next contend that the City had โno tear gas policyโ and insufficient protocols \n19  regarding the deployment of munitions, raising municipal liability against it. (Pls.โ Resp. #1 \n20  at 29โ30 (citing City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 390 (1989)).) This theory fails for \n21  multiple reasons. First, in terms of the class claims, the Court found that the deployment of \n22  tear gas to control the sudden eruption of violence did not shock the conscience, and \n23  otherwise the deployment of tear gas does not appear to be at issue in the remaining \n24  individual Plaintiffsโ claims. Second, the evidence shows that PPD does have policies for \n25  how and when to deploy chemical agents, of which tear gas is a part, and grenadiers are \n26  trained in their use. (DMSJ #1 at 27; Defsโ Reply #1 at 18 (citing DSOF ยถยถ 14โ15; 18โ21).) \n27  Indeed, one portion of the policies states that chemical agents may be used only when \n28  โabsolutely necessaryโ and โother passive means have failed to restore order.โ (DSOF \n \n- 29 - \n\n  Case 2:18-cv-02778-JJT   Document 336   Filed 02/07/22   Page 30 of 34\n \n \n \n1  ยถ 14(d).) And third, because PPD does have policies applicable to the circumstances here, \n2  Plaintiffs have no evidence that the policies were the but-for or proximate cause of their \n3  injury. See Bd. of Commโrs of Bryan Cnty., Okl., 520 U.S. at 404โ05.  \n4  Plaintiffs argue, as their expert opined, that PPD should have addressed a post-\n5  protest recommendation that the TRU establish a protocol for munitions deployment based \n6  on the events of the protest. Post-incident evidence can be probative in evaluating a \n7  municipalityโs policy. Henry v. Cnty. of Shasta, 132 F.3d 512, 519 (9th Cir. 1997), as \n8  amended, 137 F.3d 1372 (9th Cir. 1998), (citing Grandstaff v. City of Borger, 767 F.2d 161 \n9  (5th Cir. 1985)). But because the City had a policy in place regarding the deployment of \n10  munitions, the particular post-protest evidence hereโthat the City chose not to add a new \n11  protocolโis  not  sufficiently  probative  to  show  that  the  existing  PPD  policy  was \n12  insufficient, much less that the policy was the but-for or proximate cause of Plaintiffsโ \n13  injuries. For these reasons, Plaintiffsโ defective policy claim fails. \n14      d.  Practice or Custom \n15  Plaintiffs also contend that the City is liable on account of a more recent incident in \n16  which, according to Plaintiffs, PPD turned a blind eye to constitutional violations by \n17  officers, โeven after being suedโ (in the present matter), implying a practice or custom of \n18  using excessive force. (Pls.โ Resp. #1 at 30 (citing Henry, 132 F.3d at 519).) The time \n19  difference between the incidents Plaintiffs refer to, which occurred in May 2020 following \n20  the death of  George  Floyd, and the one underlying this lawsuit, which occurred on \n21  August 22, 2017, is nearly three years, which is not particularly probative to a finding of a \n22  practice  or custom.  See Trevino v. Gates,  99 F.3d 911, 918 (9th Cir. 1996)  (noting \n23  โ[l]iability for improper custom may not be predicated on isolated or sporadic incidentsโ). \n24  And at least at the time of the briefing in the present matter, no determination of an \n25  unconstitutional use of force by PPD had been made in conjunction with the May 2020 \n26  protests.6 (See Defs.โ Reply #1 Ex. 1.) The Court finds the connection between PPDโs \n27 \n \n6 The complicated nature of any potential claims related to a separate incident between \n28 \nPPD and protestors does not lend itself to a straightforward conclusion about whether \n \n- 30 - \n\n  Case 2:18-cv-02778-JJT   Document 336   Filed 02/07/22   Page 31 of 34\n \n \n \n1  actions in May 2020 and those in 2017 underlying the present matter to be too tenuous for \n2  a reasonable jury to conclude that the City had a practice or custom of using, or turning a \n3  blind eye to the use of, excessive force. \n4      e.  Failure to Train \n5  Lastly, Plaintiffs argue that PPD provided no specific training to officers tailored to \n6  the event, even though it had advance notice of the event, and that the officersโ lack of \n7  training demonstrated a deliberate indifference sufficient to raise municipal liability. (Pls.โ \n8  Resp. #1 at 30โ31 (citing Long v. Cnty. of Los Angeles, 442 F.3d 1178, 1189 (9th Cir. \n9  2006)).) Plaintiffsโ expert opined that PPD officers lacked sufficient training, butโto the \n10  extent  that  testimony  adequately  relied  on  the  record  and  did  not  constitute  legal \n11  conclusions (see Doc. 326)โPlaintiffs do not provide sufficient evidence from which a \n12  reasonable jury could find that โthe need for more or different training [was] so obvious, \n13  and the inadequacy so likely to result in the violation of constitutional rights, that the \n14  policymakers of the city can reasonably be said to have been deliberately indifferent to the \n15  need.โ City of Canton, 489 U.S. at 390. For example, as Defendants point out, Plaintiffs \n16  identify no instance before August 22, 2017, of illegal conduct such as that alleged here \n17  that would have been probative to a finding that officer training was so obviously deficient. \n18  For their part, Defendants point to the extensive training grenadiers completed. (Defs.โ \n19  Reply #1 at 19.) Plaintiffs have not raised a genuine issue of material fact sufficient to \n20  survive summary judgment on their failure to train theory. And because none of Plaintiffsโ \n21  municipal liability theories survives, the City is entitled to summary judgment on the \n22  claims against it. \n23      7.  Injunctive Relief \n24  Next,  the  parties  filed  cross-motions  for  summary  judgment  on  the  issue  of \n25  injunctive relief. In order to obtain a preliminary injunction, each Plaintiff must show that \n26  โ(1) [he/she] is likely to succeed on the merits, (2) [he/she] is likely to suffer irreparable \n27 \n \nexcessive force was used in the separate incident, and of course this Court would not \n28 \nconduct a mini-trial on a separate matter. \n \n- 31 - \n\n  Case 2:18-cv-02778-JJT   Document 336   Filed 02/07/22   Page 32 of 34\n \n \n \n1  harm in the absence of preliminary relief, (3) the balance of equities tips in [his/her] favor, \n2  and (4) an injunction is in the public interest.โ Garcia v. Google, Inc., 786 F.3d 733, 740 \n3  (9th Cir. 2015) (citing Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 9 (2008)). \n4  In  the  Complaint,  Plaintiffs  seek  โ[a]  preliminary  and  permanent  injunction \n5  prohibiting Defendants from engaging in any of the unconstitutional behaviors as described \n6  herein and to put into place safeguards sufficient to ensure that they do not continue in the \n7  future.โ (Compl. at 46 ยถ B.) In this Order, the Court concludes that Defendants are entitled \n8  to summary judgment on the class claims as well as the claims against the City and Chief \n9  Williams, but that certain individual Plaintiffsโ Fourth Amendment claims against certain \n10  individual officers will proceed to trial. \n11  To the extent these individual Plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief against individual \n12  officers, Plaintiffsโ request for such relief fails the second prong of the Winter test. An \n13  injunction is โunavailable absent a showing of irreparable injury, a requirement that cannot \n14  be met where there is no showing of any real or immediate threat that the plaintiff will be \n15  wronged againโa likelihood of substantial and immediate irreparable injury.โ City of Los \n16  Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 111 (1983) (internal quotation and citation omitted). In \n17  Lyons, although a police officer used excessive force by way of a chokehold on the plaintiff \n18  during  a  traffic  stop,  the  Supreme  Court  concluded  the  plaintiff  was  not  entitled  to \n19  injunctive  relief  because  of  an  insufficient  โlikelihood  of  substantial  and  immediate \n20  irreparable injuryโ to the plaintiff. The Court concluded โeven assumingโ Lyons would be \n21  stopped again in the โreasonably near future,โ it is โuntenable to assertโ that officers apply \n22  chokeholds at every traffic stop. Id. at 108. \n23  The Court agrees with Defendants that this case is similar to Hernandez v. City of \n24  San Jose, 2019 WL 4450930 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 17, 2019), in which the court examined \n25  whether the plaintiffs injured at an anti-Trump protest by the police officersโ crowd control \n26  tactics could seek injunctive relief. There, Judge Koh stated that the plaintiffsโ claim of \n27  substantial and irreparable injury rested on a โstring of contingencies,โ the entire set of \n28 \n \n- 32 - \n\n  Case 2:18-cv-02778-JJT   Document 336   Filed 02/07/22   Page 33 of 34\n \n \n \n1  which must be met, including whether the plaintiffs would attend another rally, a protest \n2  would break out, and police would react the same way. Id. at 21โ23.  \n3  Here, because Plaintiffs have no remaining claims against the City, injunctive relief \n4  can only be obtained against the individual officers they are suing. That additional fact \n5  makes meeting the string of contingencies even more unlikely; even if Plaintiffs attended \n6  another protest, it is uncertain whether those officers would be present, whether Plaintiffs \n7  would encounter them, whether similar circumstances would arise, and whether those \n8  officers would act in the same way.7 Plaintiffsโ testimony that they intend to attend or have \n9  attended other protests, by itself, is not sufficient under Winter to show a likelihood of \n10  substantial and immediate irreparable injury entitling them to injunctive relief against \n11  individual officers. \n12      8.  Punitive Damages \n13    Finally, Defendants state that the evidence is insufficient for a reasonable jury to \n14  award Plaintiffs punitive damages. โ[A] jury may be permitted to assess punitive damages \n15  in an action under ยง 1983 when the defendantโs conduct is shown to be motivated by evil \n16  motive or intent, or when it involves reckless or callous indifference to the federally \n17  protected rights of others.โ Smith v. Wade, 461 U.S. 30, 56 (1983). \n18    Beyond their brief argument against punitive damages in the context of the class \n19  membersโ claims (DMSJ #1 at 35; Defs.โ Reply #1 at 21), Defendants do not provide legal \n20  support for their contention that the individual Plaintiffs should be precluded from seeking \n21  punitive damages. There is some overlap between a finding of purpose to harm with regard \n22  to a Fourteenth Amendment claimโwhich the Court determined Plaintiffs could not prove \n23  with regard to the class claimsโand the finding required for punitive damages of either evil \n24  motive or intent, or reckless or callous indifference to Plaintiffsโ rights. But the individual \n25  Plaintiffsโ punitive damages claim pertains to individual officersโ actions beyond the conduct \n26  pertaining just to the class membersโ claims. The Court finds that the evidence is sufficient \n \n27 \n7 To the extent the Complaint alleges that Plaintiffs were targeted specifically because they \nwere anti-Trump protestors (e.g., Compl. ยถยถ 7, 9โ11), the string of contingencies would be \n28 \neven more difficult to meet in the near future.  \n \n- 33 - \n\n  Case 2:18-cv-02778-JJT   Document 336   Filed 02/07/22   Page 34 of 34\n \n \n \n1  for a jury to find the individual Defendantsโ use of force involved a reckless or callous \n2  indifference to the rights of Yedlin, Travis, and Guillen. Accordingly, the Court denies \n3  Defendantsโ motion as it pertains to punitive damages on Plaintiffsโ remaining claims. See \n4  Wallisa v. City of Hesparia, 369 F. Supp. 3d 990, 1021 (C.D. Cal. 2019). \n5    IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED denying Plaintiffsโ Motion for Partial Summary \n6  Judgment (redacted Doc. 246, sealed Doc. 257). \n7    IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  granting  Defendantsโ  Motion  for  Summary \n8  Judgment as to Plaintiffsโ Classwide Claims (redacted Doc. 271, sealed Doc. 276). \n9    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED granting in part and denying in part Defendantsโ \n10  Motion for Summary Judgment as to Plaintiffsโ Individual Claims (redacted Doc. 272, \n11  sealed Doc. 277). The Court will proceed to trial on the Fourth Amendment Excessive \n12  Force claims (Count 1) of individual Plaintiffs as follows: \n13  โข  Plaintiff  Ira  Yedlin  against  Defendants  Lt.  Moore,  Sgt.  McBride,  and \n14  Grenadiers Scott, Howell, and Herr; \n15  โข  Plaintiff Janet Travis  against Defendants Lt. Moore, Sgt.

McBride, and \n18  Grenadiers Scott, Turiano, Howell, and Herr. \n19  These Plaintiffs may seek damages, including punitive damages, but not injunctive relief \n20  against these Defendants. The Court grants Defendantsโ Motion for Summary Judgment as \n21  to Plaintiffsโ Individual Claims (redacted Doc. 272, sealed Doc. 277) in all other respects. \n22    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Court will set a pre-trial conference by \n23  separate Order. \n24    Dated this 7th day of February, 2022. \n25   \n \n \nHonorable John J.

This is a class action to enforce Plaintiffsโ fundamental constitutional \n3  rights of speech and association, and to be free from excessive police force and from \n4  discrimination and harm by law enforcement based on the content of their speech. On \n5  the night of August 22, 2017, a force of close to 900 officers of the Phoenix Police \n6  Department (โPPDโ) conducted an unannounced attack on Plaintiffs and hundreds of \n7  others  who  had  gathered  outside  the  Phoenix  Convention  Center  to  protest  in \n8  connection with a speech by President Trump; the goal of this assembly was to \n9  demonstrate strong disagreement with President Trumpโs and his supportersโ racist \n10  and anti-immigrant policies and views. Defendants knew that most, if not all, of those \n11  the police attacked were acting in a peaceable manner, but disregarded the well-being \n12  of these anti-Trump protestors as well as well-established constitutional mandates and \n13  police  policies.  PPD  personnel  indiscriminately  fired  harmful  pepper  spray,  gas, \n14  pepper bullets, and flash-bang cannisters into the assembled crowd, which included \n15  children, elderly people, disabled people, and pregnant women. The failure of the \n16  Phoenix Police to warn the peaceably assembled crowd of the coming attack, as is \n17  required by the Constitution, and to provide for a safe dispersal route for the protesters \n18  to avoid the police onslaught, guaranteed the ensuing widespread panic and fear \n19  amongst those assembled and resulted in physical and emotional injuries, as well as \n20  constitutional violations. \n21  2.   Defendant Chief of Phoenix Police Jeri L. Williams predictably had \n22  fulsome praise for the Phoenix Police personnel at the scene of the attack on the \n23  assembled crowd; as then-Mayor Greg Stanton stood by, she wholeheartedly endorsed \n24  and ratified the actions taken by Phoenix Police officers. City Manager Ed Zuercher \n25  also praised the police for their conduct at the gathering. Despite a significant increase \n26  in the Phoenix Police Departmentโs use-of-force incidents against civilians, including \n27  the events of August 22, 2017, and many other police-on-civilian shootings, City \n28  officials, including the Police Chief, the Mayor, the City Manager, and the City \n3  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  Council  members  have  failed  to  condemn  this  police  violence  and  to  take  any \n2  meaningful steps to stop it, reduce it, or address the trauma that police violence causes \n3  to individuals, families, and communities in the City of Phoenix. To date in 2018, there \n4  have been thirty-seven officer-involved shootings by the Phoenix Police resulting in \n5  eighteen deaths (plus another death by taser), more than during the entire year of 2017. \n6  3.  This  action  seeks  injunctive  relief  to  restrain  the  Phoenix  Police \n7  Departmentโs use of excessive force against civilians and to prohibit future disruptions \n8  of the peaceable exercise of First Amendment rights. Absent the Courtโs intervention, \n9  those who wish to gather and speak will continue to experience understandable fear of \n10  police  retaliation  when  participating  in  protests,  demonstrations,  and  marches, \n11  particularly when expressing anti-Trump views. This action also seeks damages to \n12  compensate  Plaintiffs  and  the  class  they  represent  for  the  denial  of  their  First \n13  Amendment rights on August 22, 2017, and for the physical injuries and emotional \n14  harms resulting from the Phoenix Police Departmentโs excessive use of force. \n15  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n16  4.  This  action  arises  under  42  U.S.C.  ยง  1983  and  the  laws  and \n17  Constitution of the United States. Jurisdiction lies under 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331, 1343, and \n18  1367. The Court has jurisdiction to issue declaratory and/or injunctive relief pursuant \n19  to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201 and 2202 and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 57. The Court has \n20  authority to award attorneysโ fees under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988(b). \n21  5.  Venue properly lies within this District under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b). The \n22  Defendants are all public officials or other employees or agents of the City of Phoenix, \n23  as well as the City itself. Each of the Defendants resides within this District and/or \n24  performs official duties within the State of Arizona. This Court, accordingly, has \n25  personal jurisdiction over each of the Defendants. \n26  6.  The named Defendants perform their official duties in this District, and \n27  a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to Plaintiffsโ claims have \n28  occurred or will occur in this District. \n4  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  PARTIES \n2  Organizational Plaintiffs: Injunctive Class Representatives and Damages Plaintiffs \n3  7.  Plaintiff Puente is a grassroots nonprofit membership organization \n4  based in Phoenix, Arizona. Puenteโs mission is to develop, educate, and empower \n5  migrant communities through lobbying, advocacy, and activism. Puente provides free \n6  English classes, media trainings, know-your-rights workshops, health and wellness \n7  trainings, educational programs for children, and other services. As part of their efforts \n8  to support migrant communities, Puente members frequently organize and participate \n9  in community events and demonstrations in Phoenix. Puente members believe that the \n10  Phoenix Police Departmentโs continued unlawful use of force against organizers and \n11  protesters will deter and dissuade members and the public from participating in Puente \n12  and  community  organized  Phoenix  demonstrations  in  the  future.  Members  and \n13  supporters  of  Puente  have  been  chilled  from  participating  in  political  expressive \n14  activities by the PPDโs improper, excessive, and unconstitutional uses of force. Puente \n15  expended significant time and resources to organize and participate in the protest on \n16  August 22, 2017, to convey the message that the racist and anti-immigrant policies of \n17  the Trump administration must end; Defendantsโ actions stopped this message from \n18  reaching its intended audience. Puente members and supporters believe that they will \n19  be targeted for violent PPD retaliation if they attend future demonstrations, especially \n20  when espousing anti-Trump messages. Puente also suffered out-of-pocket damages as \n21  a result of the PPDโs unlawful actions on August 22, 2017, including for lost equipment \n22  employed at demonstrations and other events. Members were violently denied their \n23  rights to speech and association. \n24  8.  Plaintiff  Poder  in  Action  (โPoderโ)  (formerly  the  Center  for \n25  Neighborhood Leadership) is a grassroots nonprofit organization based in Phoenix, \n26  Arizona. Poderโs mission is to build power with people impacted by injustice through \n27  leadership  development,  civic  engagement,  and  policy  advocacy.  Poderโs  work \n28  includes advocacy on immigration, education, and police brutality. Poder regularly \n5  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  organizes and participates in protests and political expressive activities in Phoenix to \n2  raise awareness on issues impacting black, brown, and migrant communities, including \n3  police violence. Poder representatives believe that the PPDโs continued unlawful use of \n4  force against organizers and protesters will deter and dissuade their supporters and the \n5  public  from  participating  in  such  Phoenix  protests  in  the  future.  Members  and \n6  supporters of Poder are chilled from participating in political expressive activities by \n7  the PPDโs demonstrated improper, excessive, and unconstitutional uses of force against \n8  protesters. Poder expended significant time and resources to organize and participate in \n9  the protest on August 22, 2017, to convey the message that the racist and anti-immigrant \n10  policies  of  the  Trump  administration  must  end.  Defendantsโ  actions  stopped  this \n11  message from reaching its intended audience, which included President Trump and his \n12  supporters. \n13  Injunctive and Damages Class Representatives \n14  9.  Plaintiff Janet Travis is, and was at all relevant times, a resident of \n15  downtown Phoenix. Ms. Travis attended the protest to witness first-hand and join the \n16  opposition to Trump, to document the protest, and to express her own views critical of \n17  Trumpโs policies to Trump supporters. PPD gassed Ms. Travis causing her to inhale \n18  pepper spray, and brutally shot her multiple times with unidentified projectiles in the \n19  upper back, lower back and buttocks, causing her injuries and emotional trauma so \n20  severe  she  could  not  continue  her  expressive  activities  and  had  to  seek  medical \n21  attention. Ms. Travis wants to continue to be active in political rallies and protests in \n22  her  community,  but  is  concerned  that  the  PPD  will  continue  to  target  peaceful \n23  protesters. Ms. Travis is chilled from participating in future protests and politically \n24  expressive  activities  in  Phoenix  without  significant  reform  to  the  Phoenix  Police \n25  Departmentโs policies, practices ,and procedures concerning the use of force against \n26  peaceful protesters and protecting speech and associational rights. \n27  10.  Plaintiff Ira Yedlin is a resident of Bisbee, Arizona, and a strong critic \n28  of  President  Trumpโs  politics,  policies,  and  leadership.  Mr.  Yedlin  has  attended \n6  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  numerous protests since the Vietnam War and considers it his civic duty to participate \n2  in protests when he disagrees with government action. Mr. Yedlin and his wife attended \n3  the August 22, 2017 protest in Phoenix to express to Trump and his supporters their \n4  dissatisfaction with how President Trump governs the country. PPD gassed Mr. Yedlin \n5  causing  him  to  inhale  pepper  spray,  and  violently  shot  him  multiple  times  with \n6  unidentified projectiles in the face, upper torso, and leg area. PPD injured Mr. Yedlinโs \n7  face so severely that he could not continue to protest and had to seek treatment for his \n8  injuries in a hospital emergency room. Mr. Yedlin desires to continue to be active in \n9  political rallies and protests in Phoenix, but believes that the PPD will continue to target \n10  peaceful protesters. Mr. Yedlin is chilled from participating in future protests and \n11  politically expressive activities in Phoenix without significant reform to the Phoenix \n12  Police Departmentโs policies, practices, and procedures concerning the use of force \n13  against peaceful protesters and protecting speech and associational rights. \n14  11.  Plaintiff Cynthia Guillen is a resident of Mesa, Arizona, and an active \n15  participant in demonstrations in the Phoenix metropolitan area. Ms. Guillen participated \n16  in  the  demonstration  against  President  Trump  on  August  22,  2017,  to  make  her \n17  objections to this policies to his supporters. PPD gassed Ms. Guillen causing her to \n18  inhale pepper spray, and senselessly shot her in the lower stomach and hip with \n19  unidentified projectiles. The impact of PPDโs projectiles caused Ms. Guillen external \n20  and internal injuries that required her to leave the protest and seek medical attention; \n21  she has had ongoing medical treatment. Ms. Guillen is chilled from participating in \n22  future  protests  and  politically  expressive  activities  in  Phoenix  without  significant \n23  reform  to  the  Phoenix  Police  Departmentโs  policies,  practices,  and  procedures \n24  concerning the use of force against peaceful protesters and protecting speech and \n25  associational rights.  \n26  12.  Plaintiff Jacinta Gonzalez Goodman is a resident of Phoenix, Arizona, \n27  and a long-time activist and organizer. Ms. Gonzalez Goodman volunteers with Puente \n28  and  works  with  Mijente,  a  national  civil  rights  organization  focused  on  building \n7  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  leadership  and  social  change  in  the  Latinx  community.  Ms.  Gonzalez  Goodman \n2  participated in the demonstration against President Trump on August 22, 2017, to \n3  express her disagreement with the President and his supportersโ vision for the country, \n4  to peacefully show solidarity with her community, and to demonstrate to Trump and \n5  his supporters the intense public opposition to the Presidentโs policies and goals. Ms. \n6  Gonzalez Goodman participated in the planning of the protest, and during the protest \n7  served  as  a  liaison  between  the  protesters  and  PPD.  PPD  gassed  Ms.  Gonzalez \n8  Goodman, causing her to inhale pepper spray, which caused injuries to her lungs and \n9  eyes that lingered for a day, and forced Ms. Gonzalez Goodman to leave the protest \n10  before she could deliver her message to her intended audience. Ms. Gonzalez Goodman \n11  is chilled from participating in future protests and politically expressive activities in \n12  Phoenix  without  significant  reform  to  the  Phoenix  Police  Departmentโs  policies, \n13  practices, and procedures concerning the use of force against peaceful protesters and \n14  protecting speech and associational rights. \n15  Defendants \n16  13.  Defendant City of Phoenix is a municipal corporation, organized and \n17  existing under the laws of the State of Arizona. The Phoenix Police Department is an \n18  agency of the City of Phoenix, and all actions of the PPD are the legal responsibility of \n19  the City. \n20  14.  Defendant Jeri L. Williams is, and was at all relevant times, the Chief \n21  of Police for the City of Phoenix. As such, Chief Williams is the final policy maker for \n22  the City of Phoenix in the area of law enforcement and in setting and implementing the \n23  policies  and  practices  of  the  PPD  including  but  not  limited  to  the  development, \n24  implementation, and the training of PPD personnel in these and all PPD areas, including \n25  the procedures, policies, regulations, and practices related to the proper use of force and \n26  the need for prior warnings, in response to political protests, and public demonstrations, \n27  and marches. At all relevant times, Chief Williams was responsible for the development \n28  of policies concerning protests and the protection of participantsโ basic rights of speech \n8  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  and association, for making these policies known to all PPD personnel, and for ensuring \n2  that all members of the PPD were adequately and consistently trained in their meaning \n3  and implementation, as well as in all relevant constitutional requirements and police \n4  best practices. Chief Williams was responsible for the training and preparation of PPD \n5  personnel with respect to the events of August 22, 2017, and she approved and/or \n6  ratified the PPDโs plans for that event including the unconstitutional acts complained \n7  of herein. As set out below, Chief Williams failed to establish sufficient guidelines and \n8  regulations governing the PPD in the situation presented on August 22, 2017, and did \n9  not ensure adequate training before the event, or properly supervise and monitor the \n10  actions of PPD personnel during the protest. As set out below, after becoming aware of \n11  the events and the actions of PPD on the scene, Chief Williams praised the members of \n12  the PPD with then-Mayor Stanton by her side, and fully ratified the actions of PPD \n13  personnel. City Manager Ed Zuercher also praised and ratified the PPDโs decisions and \n14  actions complained of herein. Chief Williams is sued in her official and individual \n15  capacity. \n16  15.  Defendant Benjamin Moore is a Lieutenant with the PPD. On August \n17  22, 2017, he was designated as the โAlpha Leaderโ and โField Force Commanderโ in \n18  charge of all PPD units working the night of the Trump rally and protest. Lt. Moore \n19  gave the initial improper orders for PPD officers to use force against anti-Trump \n20  protestors  that  resulted  in  indiscriminate  attacks  against  hundreds  of  peaceable \n21  protesters without warnings and before any unlawful assembly had been declared. \n22  Plaintiffs sue Lt. Moore in his official and individual capacity. \n23  16.  Defendant Douglas McBride is a Sergeant with the PPD. On August \n24  22, 2017, he was assigned as the โGrenadier Team Leaderโ for the Trump rally and \n25  protest. According to PPD, grenadiers are โspecialty trained officers on deployment of \n26  chemical munitions.โ Plaintiffs sue Sgt. McBride in his official and individual capacity. \n27  17.  Defendant Robert Scott is an officer with the PPD who was assigned \n28  to the PPDโs Tactical Response Unit as one of the โGrenadiers.โ As set forth herein, \n9  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  Officer Scott indiscriminately fired on and injured Plaintiffs without warning. Plaintiffs \n2  sue Officer Scott in his official and individual capacity. \n3  18.  Defendant Christopher Turiano is an officer with the PPD who was \n4  assigned to the PPDโs Tactical Response Unit as one of the โGrenadiers.โ As set forth \n5  herein, Officer Turiano indiscriminately shot and injured Plaintiffs without warning. \n6  Plaintiffs sue Officer Turiano in his official and individual capacity. \n7  19.  Defendant Glenn Neville is an officer with the PPD who was assigned \n8  to the PPDโs Tactical Response Unit as one of the โGrenadiers.โ As set forth herein, \n9  Officer Neville indiscriminately shot and injured Plaintiffs without warning. Plaintiffs \n10  sue Officer Glenn in his official and individual capacity. \n11  20.  Defendant John Sticca is an officer with the PPD who was assigned to \n12  the PPDโs Tactical Response Unit as one of the โGrenadiers.โ As set forth herein, \n13  Officer Sticca indiscriminately shot and injured Plaintiffs without warning. Plaintiffs \n14  sue Officer Sticca in his official and individual capacity. \n15  21.  Defendant Lane White is an officer with the PPD who was assigned to \n16  the PPDโs Tactical Response Unit as one of the โGrenadiers.โ As set forth herein, \n17  Officer White indiscriminately shot and injured Plaintiffs without warning. Plaintiffs \n18  sue Officer White in his official and individual capacity. \n19  22.  Defendant Jeffrey Howell is an officer with the PPD who was assigned \n20  to the PPDโs Tactical Response Unit as one of the โGrenadiers.โ As set forth herein, \n21  Officer Howell indiscriminately shot and injured Plaintiffs without warning. Plaintiffs \n22  sue Officer Howell in his official and individual capacity. \n23  23.  Defendant George Herr is an officer with the PPD who was assigned \n24  to the PPDโs Tactical Response Unit as one of the โGrenadiers.โ As set forth herein, \n25  Officer Herr indiscriminately shot and injured Plaintiffs without warning. Plaintiffs sue \n26  Officer Herr in his official and individual capacity. \n27  24.  Plaintiffs  are  ignorant  of  the  true  names  and/or  capacities  of \n28  Defendants  sued  herein  as  Does  1  through  20,  inclusive,  and  therefore  sue  said \n10  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  Defendants by such fictitious names. Plaintiffs will amend this complaint to allege their \n2  true names and capacities when ascertained. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and \n3  upon such information and belief allege, that each of the Doe Defendants is legally \n4  responsible and liable for the incident, injuries, and damages hereinafter set forth, and \n5  that each of said Defendants proximately caused said incidents, injuries, and damages \n6  by reason of their failure to supervise, train, manage, or control staff, violation of \n7  constitutional rights, violation of public policy, or based on agency, employment, \n8  ownership, entrustment, custody, care, or control, or upon any other act or omission. \n9  Plaintiffs will seek leave to amend this complaint to insert further charging allegations \n10  when such facts are ascertained.  \n11  25.  Each  of  the  above  individual  Defendants  participated  in  and  has \n12  responsibility for the unlawful conduct and resulting injuries to Plaintiffs and putative \n13  damages  class  members  described  herein,  by,  among  other  things,  personally \n14  participating in the unlawful conduct, or acting jointly or conspiring with others who \n15  did so; authorizing, acquiescing in, or setting in motion policies, plans, or actions that \n16  led to the unlawful conduct; failing to take action to prevent the unlawful conduct; \n17  failing and refusing, with deliberate indifference to Plaintiffsโ rights, to initiate and \n18  maintain adequate training and supervision; and ratifying the unlawful conduct that \n19  occurred by agents and officers under their direction and control, including failing to \n20  take remedial or disciplinary action. \n21  26.  In doing the acts alleged herein, Defendants, and each of them, acted \n22  within the course and scope of their employment for the City of Phoenix. \n23  27.  In doing the acts and/or omissions alleged herein, Defendants, and \n24  each of them, acted under color of authority and/or under color of law. In doing the acts \n25  and/or omissions alleged herein, Defendants, and each of them, acted as the agent, \n26  servant, employee, and/or in concert with each of said other Defendants herein. \n27   \n28   \n11  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  STATEMENT OF FACTS \n2  28.  The election of Donald J. Trump in November 2016, and his harmful \n3  policies and attitudes related to migrants, police misconduct, discrimination, women, \n4  education, health care, foreign affairs, and gun control, to name a few, have invigorated \n5  millions  of  Americans  to  join  anti-Trump  protests  and  demonstrations  in  record \n6  numbers  across  the  nation.  Overwhelming  numbers  of  protestors,  many  newly \n7  motivated by the cruel and unjustified policies of the present administration, are \n8  participating in demonstrations for the first time to express their criticism. Arizonans \n9  found themselves the target of Trumpโs racist and anti-immigrant politics when, in the \n10  summer of 2017, he publicized his intent to pardon former Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who \n11  had been convicted of criminal contempt of court after disobeying a federal judgeโs \n12  order to end the practice of racial profiling and detaining persons suspected of being \n13  in the United States unlawfully solely based on their perceived Latino race. When \n14  Trump announced plans to speak in Phoenix just before his anticipated pardon of \n15  Arpaio (who is widely known for visiting indignities on prisoners and terrorizing \n16  immigrant communities in Maricopa County), Arizonans planned to take to the streets. \n17  Plans to Demonstrate in Quintessential Public Fora \n18  29.  On August 16, 2017, Trumpโs campaign announced that he would \n19  deliver a speech at a campaign-style rally at the Phoenix Convention Center less than a \n20  week later. This announcement came on the heels of a violent clash between two groups \n21  of  demonstrators  in  Charlottesville,  Virginia,  one  group  consisting  of  white \n22  supremacists and one group consisting of pro-social-justice advocates. One woman was \n23  killed by the intentional act of a white supremacist, and several were injured in the \n24  clashes in Charlottesville. Trump reacted to the events in Charlottesville by proclaiming \n25  that there were โgood peopleโ on both sides. \n26  30.  With the events of Charlottesville in mind, Plaintiffs Puente and Poder \n27  in Action, and other activists and groups, mobilized to plan a safe protest before and \n28  after Trumpโs rally scheduled for early evening on August 22, 2017 (โTrump Protestโ). \n12  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  PPD  liaisons  communicated  with  organizers  about  the  details  of  the  planned \n2  demonstrations. Puente and Poder also met, and otherwise communicated with PPD \n3  liaisons to discuss logistics for the demonstration to ensure that all who gathered would \n4  be  able  to  safely  exercise  their  free-speech  and  assembly  rights,  and  make  their \n5  opposition to Trumpโs actions known to his supporters. Puente, Poder, and other \n6  organizations exchanged phone calls, emails, and text messages with the PPD and other \n7  City representatives leading up to the demonstration. The ACLU of Arizona also \n8  reached out to representatives of the City of Phoenix and PPD to request that the City \n9  and the PPD put in place measures to prevent the devastation that befell protestors in \n10  Charlottesville and ensure that all could exercise their speech rights safely. City and \n11  PPD representatives assured the ACLU of Arizona that the PPD was prepared and was \n12  much more experienced in managing crowds and large demonstrations than the police \n13  in Charlottesville. \n14  31.  During the planning communications, PPD made it clear to Puente, \n15  Poder,  and  other  organizers  that  anti-Trump  protesters  would  be  relegated  to \n16  assembling  in  an  outdoor  but  confined  space  in  the  downtown  area  which  it \n17  euphemistically called the โfree-speech zone.โ PPD defined this area as follows: its \n18  southern boundary was Monroe Street, between Second and Third Streets, in front of \n19  the Herberger Theater, directly north of the Convention Centerโs northern entrance. The \n20  northern boundary of the โfree-speech zoneโ was marked by a barrier which stretched, \n21  in part, across Third Street between Monroe and Van Buren Streets. PPD restricted anti-\n22  Trump protesters to assembling, chanting, and holding signs in this zone, north of \n23  Monroe Street and south of the barrier. The streets and sidewalks of downtown Phoenix \n24  slated for use by anti-Trump protesters were traditional public fora regularly used by \n25  demonstrators for expressive events and activities.  \n26  32.  Puente and Poder shared with PPD that, based just on responses on \n27  social media, their groups alone expected upwards of 500 protestors including children \n28  and persons with disabilities, and that total attendance would far exceed that. Puente \n13  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  and Poder organized a staging and fallback area for demonstrators at the Civic Space \n2  Park,  two  blocks  north  and  three  blocks  west  of  the  main  protest  area.  They \n3  communicated to PPD that volunteers would begin gathering at the Civic Space Park \n4  by 1 P.M. or earlier and that demonstrators would arrive at the Civic Space Park by 3 \n5  P.M. or earlier. Puente and Poder expected that the demonstration would continue \n6  through  the  time  that  Trumpโs  rally  ended  and  he  and  his  supporters  exited  the \n7  Convention Center, so that protesters could reach the intended audience and express \n8  their views to Trump and his supporters. PPD was aware of proposed protest plans. \n \n9 \nPPD Used Excessive Force to Unlawfully Disperse Anti-Trump Protestors in \n10  Violation of the Fourth Amendment \n11  33.  PPD officers were present from the beginning of the demonstration. \n12  As early as 2:30 P.M., despite the absence of any indication of violence, PPD officers \n13  obscured their identities by face shields and vests and other equipment covering their \n14  badges. Many officers had weapons drawn despite the peaceful and lawful assembly as \n15  anti-Trump protesters convened throughout the afternoon, and later waited for the \n16  speech to end and the many Trump supporters to leave the Convention Center and travel \n17  close enough to hear the protestersโ chants and see their many anti-Trump signs.  \n18  34.  PPD  officers,  including  โgrenadiers,โ  were  equipped  with  several \n19  types of chemical and projectile weapons including:  \n20  a. Pepper bullets; \n21  b. 40 mm foam impact rounds, which travel at speeds pf 89 miles per \n22  hour and contained โCSโ (irritant) powder and cayenne pepper to deliver both \n23  blunt trauma and the effects of an irritant powder;   \n24  c. Flash-bang grenades, which are devices that produce loud explosive \n25  noises and bright flashes of light; \n26  d. Smoke grenades, which are explosive devices that release smoke; \n27  e. โStingers,โ which are explosive devices that release smoke, rubber, \n28  pellets, and a chemical irritant within a radius of approximately 50 feet; and \n14  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  f.  Canisters containing โCS,โ or tear gas.  \n2  The manufacturersโ specifications describe these munitions as designed to incapacitate \n3  subjects, and to inflict pain to compel compliance. Despite PPDโs presence, including \n4  many officers in riot gear with weapons powerful enough to incapacitate and cause \n5  serious and lethal injuries, anti-Trump protestors remained peaceful throughout the day.  \n6  35.  On  information  and  belief,  Trumpโs  presence  meant  that  PPD \n7  coordinated regarding plans for crowd control with officers from the Secret Service and \n8  other federal agencies.  \n9  36.  Officers from many other law enforcement agencies in Arizona were \n10  also present to provide support and assistance during the demonstrations. Among those \n11  forces present were representatives of federal agencies and mounted police from the \n12  Tempe and Scottsdale police departments, with experience and expertise in dispersing \n13  large  crowds.  The  PPD  had  the  primary  crowd-control  role  throughout  the \n14  demonstration,  and  made  the  decision  to  use  the  incapacitating  weaponry \n15  indiscriminately  against  hundreds  of  peaceably  assembled  anti-Trump  protestors \n16  without warning.  \n17  37.  President Trump arrived at the Convention Center at approximately \n18  6:32 P.M.  \n19  38.  Without provocation, at approximately 7:00 P.M., PPD officers in riot \n20  gear formed a line (โPolice Lineโ) on Monroe Street in the โsafety zoneโ in front of \n21  anti-Trump protestors who assembled during the afternoon directly across from the \n22  north entrance of the Convention Center. Anti-Trump protestors were awaiting the end \n23  of Trumpโs rally inside the Convention Center, and his and his supportersโ exit from \n24  the building. \n25  39.  Despite there being no provocation or dangerous acts by anti-Trump \n26  protestors, at approximately 7:03 P.M. and 7:13 P.M., the PPD increased its already \n27 \n28 \n15  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  forceful presence in that area as several additional police units arrived to join the \n2  growing Police Line on Monroe Street.  \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n40.  Without any precipitating conduct by the anti-Trump protestors, at \n14 \n7:19 P.M., the Police Line of officers (all wearing helmets and masks obscuring their \n15 \nfaces and badges), took several steps forward in a northern direction, in unison, towards \n16 \nthe anti-Trump protestors. Ex. 1. \n17 \n41.  On information and belief, PPD removed its officers stationed in the \n18 \ndesignated โfree-speech zoneโ nearby the anti-Trump protestors at approximately 8:20 \n19 \nP.M., without explanation or notice to protest organizers, including the Puente and \n20 \nPoder contacts who had previously been in communication with some of those officers.  \n21 \n42.  As the Trump rally inside the Convention Center was ending, several \n22 \ndozens of officers filed out of the Convention Center in riot gear heading west towards \n23 \nSecond Street to join the Police Line. By 8:29 P.M., the number of PPD officers in the \n24 \nPolice Line forcefully confronting anti-Trump protestors had grown significantly. The \n25 \nonly attempted excuse for this increased show of force was that a few individuals had \n26 \nthrown plastic water bottles; none of the officers were injured.  \n27 \n28 \n16  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  43.  PPD did not attempt to identify or separate from the gatherings of anti-\n2  Trump protesters any individuals they considered to be problematic or possibly engaged \n3  in improper conduct. As later events revealed, PPD instead opted for a โletโs fire on allโ \n4  tactic that endangered the rights and well-being of hundreds of peaceable persons, \n5  including children and the elderly; PPD personnel were apparently trained in the tactic \n6  of firing on all in a crowd as the best method for shaking out one or two persons of \n7  concern, if even present at all.  \n8  44.  At approximately 8:30 P.M., Trump and other federal officials began \n9  exiting the Convention Center. After hours of assembling and gathering in Phoenixโs \n10  sweltering heat all day, anti-Trump protesters were about to have their opportunity to \n11  chant and display their signs to express their views to Trump and his supporters as they \n12  exited the Convention Center.  \n13  45.  At  8:32  P.M.  hundreds  of  anti-Trump  protesters  were  assembled \n14  behind the pedestrian fencing along Monroe Street. As a result, a twenty-foot portion \n15  of the fence was shaken. PPD gave no warnings that either force would be used, or that \n16  the crowd would be dispersed if the fence continued to shake. Without first ordering \n17  officers to warn protestors about touching the fence, and with no warning or clear \n18  instruction about how to avoid the attack and where to disperse, Defendant Lieutenant \n19  Benjamin Moore and Defendant Sergeant Douglas McBride ordered officers to fire \n20  pepper balls. \n21  46.  At no time between 2:00 P.M. to 8:32 P.M. did PPD announce to the \n22  assembled protesters that any force would be used against them or that an attack by \n23  PPD personnel was imminent. Nonetheless, Lt. Moore ordered officers to shoot gas, \n24  projectiles, and munitions, but never ordered them to warn protestors prior to opening \n25  fire. As later acknowledged, PPD had insufficient megaphones, sound magnifying \n26  devices, or plans to effectively communicate to a large crowd. No declaration of an \n27  unlawful assembly or order to disperse was made between 2:00 P.M. and 8:32 P.M. \n28  when Defendants Lt. Moore and Sgt. McBride gave the order to use force. \n17  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  47.  Defendant Officer Robert Scott was the first to deploy pepper bullets. \n2  Scott shot the first pepper bullets, impacting the ground in front of the anti-Trump \n3  protesters closest to the fence. Other PPD officers immediately joined him, and together \n4  officers shot at least another ten pepper bullets in rapid succession towards anti-Trump \n5  protesters in the same general area. Ex. 2 (screen shot of first pepper bullet rounds). \n6  The crowd in the immediate vicinity dispersed. Ex. 3 (screen shot of โfree-speech zoneโ \n7  nearly clear of anti-Trump protestors). Despite this, Officer Scott continued to fire \n8  pepper bullets at protestors who were dispersing. Scott was apparently trained that he \n9  could ignore the PPD policy prohibiting firing pepper bullets above a personโs waist \n10  when he reported that he โdeployed multiple rounds of pepper ball,โ while โaiming at \n11  the torso of the subject.โ \n12  48.  At 8:33 P.M., one minute after officers fired the initial rounds of \n13  pepper bullets at protestors, two plastic water bottles were thrown from the crowd. One \n14  landed several feet in front of the Police Line, and another landed over their heads. No \n15  PPD officers were injured by the plastic bottles. No protestor was engaged in any \n16  violent or threatening conduct. At this time, anti-Trump protesters were chanting, \n17  โHands up! Donโt shoot!โ and other anti-Trump and social justice messages.  \n18  49.  At 8:35 P.M., without any provocation, warning, or declaration of an \n19  unlawful assembly, an officer along Monroe Street threw the first visible tear gas \n20  canister towards the anti-Trump protesters standing along the pedestrian fencing. Ex. \n21  4. That canister erupted in yellow smoke, harming protesters who had been peacefully \n22  assembled. Again without warning, a second officer threw another gas canister toward \n23  protestors. Ex. 4. Utter chaos ensued. Protestors, including children and elderly people, \n24  ran from the gas, screaming, coughing, and crying. The gas and fumes were unexpected \n25  and persons with mobility issues required assistance to retreat and get to safety. Anti-\n26  Trump protesters who remained in the area acted to kick and clear the gas canisters \n27  away from the protestors to protect them from the chemicals. PPD fired three more gas \n28  canisters, two of which were kicked or thrown in directions away from the anti-Trump \n18  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  protesters.  None  of  the  gas  canisters  thrown  or  kicked  away  by  the  anti-Trump \n2  protesters originated from Plaintiffs.  \n3  50.  PPD officers launched three more gas canisters toward the anti-Trump \n4  protesters and violently attacked them with other chemical weapons and projectiles. \n5  Protesters continued running away, screaming, confused, terrified, dodging rubber \n6  bullets, gas canisters, and unidentifiable projectiles launched at their torsos and heads \n7  in violation of PPD policy. Anti-Trump protesters fled while holding their shirts or \n8  cloths over their noses and mouths to block the gas and pepper spray that burned their \n9  eyes, throats, and lungs. Still at this point in time, the PPD had not declared an unlawful \n10  assembly and had given no dispersal order.  \n11  51.  PPD then escalated its use of force on protesters by deploying flash-\n12  bang grenades on the ground and in the air, which emitted loud booms and clouds of \n13  green and grey gas. PPD had not yet declared an unlawful assembly, given any dispersal \n14  instructions to protesters, or directed protesters to an area where they could continue \n15  their peaceful assembly. At no point before 8:32 P.M., when force was first used, did \n16  any person from PPD give Puente, Poder, or any anti-Trump protesters warning that \n17  force would be used, or information about where to go for safety or to continue their \n18  assembly. \n19  52.  Anti-Trump protesters reacted to the indiscriminate police violence \n20  and resulting physical injuries and great fear by clearing the area as of 8:42 P.M. \n21  Nonetheless, PPD officers continued shooting pepper bullets at close range toward one \n22  remaining  anti-Trump  protester,  who  posed  no  threat  and  was  filming  the  police \n23  response, hitting his upper torso in violation of department policy. Exs. 5, 6 (screen shot \n24  of anti-Trump protester being shot while recording officers).  \n25  53.  At 8:44 P.M., PPD still had not declared an unlawful assembly, or \n26  issued an order to disperse or warnings that officers would continue to use violent force. \n27  Yet, Lt. Moore next ordered PPD officers to use force against anti-Trump protesters by \n28  โmov[ing] into the crowd and clear[ing] the area all the way to Van Buren,โ without \n19  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  warning or direction to anti-Trump protesters that the area should be cleared before \n2  force was used. As ordered, PPD officers with riot helmets on, shields drawn, and rifles \n3  aimed  to  shoot  chemical  munitions  and  projectiles  advanced  on  the  anti-Trump \n4  protesters and breached the pedestrian gate on Monroe Street, at the location where \n5  Puente and Poder had positioned much of the water for protesters at PPDโs direction. \n6  Officers in the Police Line continued to fire tear gas and pepper balls into the crowd as \n7  they marched in unison towards Plaintiffs, effectively corralling them away from the \n8  designated demonstration area and water station.  \n9  54.  The  riot-gear-clad  officers  moved  into  the  areas  of  assembly \n10  designated  for  anti-Trump  protesters  while  firing  projectiles  indiscriminately  and \n11  without  prior,  or  even  simultaneous,  warnings.  Anti-Trump  protesters  had  no \n12  opportunity  to  collect  their  personal  property  and  signs  containing  their  political \n13  messages. Puente was forced to leave behind equipment it uses for demonstrations and \n14  other events, including a large inflatable screen and amplifiers. PPD also shoved the \n15  anti-Trump protesters with their shields even as the protesters were moving out of the \n16  area. As PPD advanced north, PPD trapped Plaintiffs within the barricades of the zone, \n17  forcing them to climb, jump, or otherwise find a way over the barricades to escape \n18  PPDโs attack. PPDโs actions took no considerations for the elderly or persons with \n19  limited mobility, some of whom were in wheelchairs and had to unexpectedly, and \n20  without warnings, flee PPDโs advancing violence. \n21  55.  Through all of this, PPD gave no instructions to protestors about where \n22  to disperse. All day, organizers of the demonstration had cooperated with PPD to ensure \n23  that the peaceful and lawful assembly would continue. Indeed, at the request of PPD, \n24  earlier that day, organizers were asked to move collections of water bottles to a different \n25  area, and organizers complied.  \n26  56.  PPD gave no instructions to disperse in the minutes before the first \n27  projectiles were shot by police at 8:32 P.M., through the next 30 minutes. As of 9:00 \n28  P.M., no unlawful assembly had been declared and no dispersal orders had been given \n20  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  despite the violent actions of PPD officers using their weapons to disperse the anti-\n2  Trump protesters. \n3  57.  Between 8:32 and 9:00 P.M., the Police Line continued to move north \n4  on both Second and Third Streets, forcefully driving anti-Trump protesters out from the \n5  area by indiscriminately shooting them with gas canisters and pepper bullets at close \n6  range in the head, face, upper back, stomach, and groin areas. PPD officers shot anti-\n7  Trump protesters who were taking photos or video. Ignoring department policy, as they \n8  advanced, PPD sprayed Plaintiffs in the face with pepper spray from just inches away \n9  even as they were following orders and retreating. Exs. 7, 8, 9. PPD never warned these \n10  protestors that force would be used based on any conduct they were engaging in. PPD \n11  sprayed at least one member of the media who was documenting her retreat from the \n12  violence on video, in the face and camera lens โ even as she was moving away from \n13  the Police Line. Exs. 10, 11. PPD never warned her that an officer would directly spray \n14  her face if she kept recording. \n15  58.  The first instructions to disperse were finally heard from a helicopter \n16  at approximately 9:00 P.M. PPDโs own โAfter-Action Reportโ confirms that it was not \n17  until around 9:00 P.M. that an air unit was used โto make announcement to disperse.โ \n18  The dispersal orders from the helicopter were in English only, ignoring that some of the \n19  participants may not have understood English. For nearly 30 minutes prior, PPD had \n20  rained pepper bullets, gas canisters, and pepper spray without warnings on anti-Trump \n21  protesters. These after-the-fact helicopter announcements never warned anti-Trump \n22  protesters that they would be shot with projectiles, gas, or other munitions. \n23  59.  After the dispersal order was given from the helicopter, PPD continued \n24  indiscriminately using chemical and impact munitions, pepper spray, and their shields \n25  as weapons against anti-Trump protesters in the assembly, including children, persons \n26  with disabilities and mobility issues, and the media. Dozens of individuals were shot at \n27  close  range  as  officers  unloaded  their  weapons  at  anti-Trump  protesters.  Fleeing \n28  protesters were trapped with PPD advancing violently from the south and barricades \n21  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  erected by PPD blocking their escape to the north. Individuals were forced to climb or \n2  jump over the barricades, with some people falling over them in flight and some with \n3  mobility  issues  requiring  assistance  from  others  to  breach  the  barricades.  While \n4  breaking up the lawful demonstration, PPD officers shouted obscenities at the peaceful \n5  protesters. Contemporaneous with firing chemical and impact munitions at anti-Trump \n6  protesters, PPD officers yelled: โstun bag that guy, oh yeah, yep thatโll teach him,โ and \n7  โthatโs right motherfuckers, you just smoked yourself, dumbasses.โ \n8  60.  At 9:14 P.M., several โgrenadiersโ continued to โtarget anyone who \n9  aggressively approaches the police line with pepper balls.โ As the officers moved north, \n10  they targeted anti-Trump protesters in their path with projectiles and other force as the \n11  officers continued to fire chemical and impact munitions, gas, and pepper spray at \n12  persons with no evidence that any of the persons who were shot had engaged in any \n13  improper conduct. \n14  61.  Defendant officers were aware that they were targeting protestors \n15  despite their peaceful status. PPD acknowledged in an after-action report dated August \n16  28, 2017, โIt is important to note that the vast majority of participants on August 22 \n17  in both the campaign rally and the protests outside were peaceful, prepared and civil.โ \n18  (Emphasis added.) \n19  62.  Despite knowing that anti-Trump protesters were โpeaceful, prepared \n20  and civil,โ PPD officers indiscriminately used unlawful and excessive force as follows: \n21  a.  Defendant Officer Scott was a grenadier and the first to fire chemical  \n22  weapons at the anti-Trump protesters. According to Scott, he shot at anti-Trump \n23  protesters to โmake the immediate area unpleasant to be in because of irritant in the \n24  pepper balls.โ Without warning, Scott โbegan attempting to directly impact[] the legs \n25  of the subjects that remainedโ in the area. Still giving no warning, Scott also shot the \n26  torso of an โolder maleโ who was touching the pedestrian fence with โdirect impactโ \n27  weapons. With no unlawful assembly declared, Scott โdeploy[ed] pepper ball to clear \n28  out the remaining people at the pedestrian fence.โ On orders from Moore and without \n22  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  any warnings, Scott erratically fired โmultiple rounds of pepper ball using the area \n2  saturation method.โ Officer Scott continued to fire projectiles and chemical weapons \n3  indiscriminately at anti-Trump protesters without warning throughout the night. \n4  b. Defendant Officer Turiano was among the grenadiers working at the \n5  Trump rally and protest. He saw a man in blue shorts running toward the Police Line, \n6  and despite his knowledge that an OC canister (pepper spray) reaches temperatures of \n7  800 degrees Fahrenheit, Turiano nonetheless fired an โOC impact round at the maleโs \n8  lower torsoโ hitting his groin from about 20 yards away. This protestor collapsed and \n9  was dragged off for medical assistance. Officer Turiano alone fired at least 40 rounds \n10  of impact weapons, tear gas, and smoke bombs.  \n11  c. Defendant Officer Neville was a grenadier on detail to the Trump rally \n12  and protest. He fired chemical munitions and weapons at the anti-Trump protesters \n13  without  warning.  On  information  and  belief,  Officer  Neville  continued  to  fire \n14  projectiles and chemical weapons indiscriminately at anti-Trump protesters without \n15  warning throughout the night. \n16  d. Defendant Officer Sticca was also assigned as one of the โgrenadiers.โ \n17  Officer Sticca heard protesters chanting โHands up! Donโt Shoot!โ and other anti-\n18  Arpaio, and law enforcement related messages just before he was ordered to and did \n19  deploy โsmoke canisters,โ โCS Canisters,โ pepper bullets, and projectiles toward the \n20  crowd without first warning them. Officer Sticca continued to fire projectiles and \n21  chemical  weapons  indiscriminately  at  anti-Trump  protesters  without  warning \n22  throughout the night. \n23  e. Defendant Officer White was another one of PPDโs โgrenadiersโ who \n24  arbitrarily used excessive force against anti-Trump protesters. After Lt. Moore gave the \n25  order to โsmoke,โ Lane began throwing smoke munitions in the direction of peaceful \n26  participants along the north curb of Monroe Street without warning. Additionally, when \n27  Lt.  Moore  ordered  officers  to  deploy  CS  gas,  he  deployed  CS  grenades  and  CS \n28  munitions, also without warnings. \n23  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  f.  Defendant  Officer  Howell,  another  โgrenadier,โ  began  to  deploy \n2  pepper balls to the ground directly in front of protestors who had been touching the \n3  pedestrian gate along Monroe Street after Lt. Moore gave the order. Additionally, \n4  against policy, and without warnings, Officer Howell deployed multiple pepper balls \n5  โat the torso areas of the [protestorsโ] bodies,โ and carried out โmid-torso direct \n6  impacts.โ  Officer  Howell  continued  to  fire  projectiles  and  chemical  weapons \n7  indiscriminately at anti-Trump protesters without warning throughout the night.  \n8  g. Defendant  Officer  Herr  is  a  โgrenadierโ  who  was  teamed  with \n9  Defendant Sgt. McBride at the time officers were ordered to begin using force on anti-\n10  Trump protesters. Without warning or declaration of an unlawful assembly, Herr and \n11  Sgt.  McBride  fired  pepper  ball  munitions  at  the  ground  to  disperse  anti-Trump \n12  protesters near the area where a pedestrian fence was shaking. Officer Herr next shot \n13  2-3 pepper ball munitions without any warnings at an individual protester who โwas \n14  directly impacted by the pepper ball munitions and ran towards the back of the crowd.โ \n15  Officer  Herr  also  indiscriminately  shot  pepper  balls  into  the  crowd,  โtarget[ing] \n16  individuals who were physically grabbing the fencingโ for โdirect impact of the pepper \n17  ball.โ Herr also loaded a single round of the โsuper sockโ munition, or a bean bag round, \n18  into his shotgun and against policy he shot a โlight skinned male, with no shirtโ in the \n19  โupper torso area causing him to fall to the ground.โ \n20  h. Defendant Sgt. McBride was in charge of the actions of all of these \n21  officers. Sergeant Mc Bride was on Monroe Street with his team of grenadiers when Lt. \n22  Moore ordered PPD officers to use โsmoke and gas grenadesโ on anti-Trump protesters \n23  without warning, and took no action to stop this conduct. After Lt. Moore improperly \n24  ordered the lawful assembly to be cleared, Sgt. McBride ordered the team of grenadiers \n25  to โsupport the skirmish line,โ move into the crowd, and on his orders grenadiers fired \n26  chemical and other projectiles indiscriminately without warning to โclear[] the area all \n27  the way to Van Buren.โ Sgt. McBride did nothing to intervene in the use of excessive \n28  force and violations of PPD policy. \n24  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  63.  The Phoenix Police Department had approximately 882 police officers \n2  on hand at the Trump rally and protest, yet made no attempt to isolate any individuals \n3  or groups that may have been engaging in improper or unlawful conduct. Instead, PPD \n4  used unwarranted and unlawful indiscriminate force against all anti-Trump protesters. \n5  64.  PPD officers advanced towards hundreds of anti-Trump protesters \n6  assembled north of the Convention Center, regardless of whether they had engaged in \n7  any unlawful activity โ shooting them with so-called โless lethalโ munitions designed \n8  to incapacitate, and which did knock Plaintiffs to the ground. PPD officers did not use \n9  such force to effectuate arrest, overcome resistance to arrest, or in self-defense. The \n10  anti-Trump protesters did not resist arrest, attempt to escape arrest, use force upon any \n11  person, or threaten to use force upon any person. Yet, without regard to whether anti-\n12  Trump protesters were engaged in unlawful activity, PPD officers fired their dangerous \n13  weapons  indiscriminately,  aiming  at  and  striking  the  upper  torsos  and  heads  of \n14  Plaintiffsโin violation of manufacturerโs warnings and PPD policy.  \n15  65.  As a result, Plaintiffs and putative members of the injunctive class are \n16  understandably hesitant to engage in further speech, assembly, demonstrations, and \n17  gatherings  in  Phoenix,  particularly  when  expressing  criticism  of  Trump  and  his \n18  supporters. As it was on August 22, 2017, the PPD will be the primary law enforcement \n19  agency at future demonstrations in Phoenix. \n20  66.  PPD injured Plaintiffs by this violence as follows: \n21  a. Plaintiff Puente planned, organized, and participated in the August 22, \n22  2017 Phoenix Trump protest to express its and its membersโ and supportersโ opposition \n23  to  President  Trumpโs  treatment  of  migrants,  his  immigration  policies,  and  his \n24  anticipated pardoning of former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. In planning the \n25  protest, Puente had communicated with the PPD to ensure the safety of its members, \n26  other protesters, and the community. Despite Puenteโs efforts, after Trumpโs rally \n27  ended, PPD did not communicate with Puente that it intended to end the Trump Protest \n28  or that force would be used against the anti-Trump protesters. PPD deprived Puente \n25  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  members of their First Amendment rights to criticize Trump by violently attacking \n2  them. PPD has previously used excessive force during First Amendment protected \n3  activities planned and organized by Puente, against Puente members and supporters. \n4  b. Plaintiff Poder also assisted, organized, planned, and participated in \n5  the August 22, 2017 Trump Protest to express its opposition to President Trumpโs \n6  treatment  of  migrants  and  his  immigration  policies.  During  the  protest,  Poder \n7  representatives and supporters were peaceful. Likewise, after Trumpโs rally ended, PPD \n8  did not communicate to Poder that it was dispersing the assembly. Despite having \n9  Poderโs contact information, PPD did not warn Poder that its members and supporters \n10  would be subjected to the indiscriminate use of force by PPD officers. PPD viciously \n11  attacked Poder members just as they intended to express their anti-Trump views to \n12  Trump  and  his  supporters.  PPD  has  previously  used  excessive  force  during  First \n13  Amendment protected activities planned and organized by Poder, against its supporters. \n14  c. Plaintiff  Janet  Travis  was  walking  home,  observing,  and \n15  photographing the protest and police response, when PPD gassed her, caused her to \n16  inhale pepper spray, and shot her in the upper part of her back just inches from her head, \n17  with unidentified projectiles at close range. Ms. Travis had no warning she would be \n18  gassed or shot and was not engaged in any conduct to justify the use of force against \n19  her. A PPD projectile struck Ms. Travisโs back with such force that it knocked her to \n20  the ground. Exs. 12-13. As concerned protesters aided Ms. Travis and attempted to help \n21  her to her feet, PPD struck her again with another unidentified projectile shot from close \n22  range. The second projectile struck her upper torso in the lower part of her back, and \n23  upper glute. Exs. 12-13. Ms. Travis suffered difficulties breathing, and such significant \n24  trauma and bruising along her back, buttocks, and leg that she was forced to seek \n25  medical attention for her injuries. Before opening fire on Ms. Travis and other anti-\n26  Trump protesters, PPD gave no warnings that officers were planning to use force. Since \n27  being shot, Ms. Travis is fearful and distrusting of the PPD. For Ms. Travis, it has been \n28  a source of angst to see on the internet, in newspapers, and on television reports across \n26  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  the world photos and videos of her being shot because it feels like an extreme invasion \n2  of privacy. \n3  d. Plaintiff Ira Yedlin was peacefully protesting outside the Phoenix \n4  Convention Center when PPD officers gassed him, caused him to inhale pepper spray, \n5  and shot him with unidentified projectiles five times in the legs, once in the back, and \n6  once in the face. Before opening fire on Mr. Yedlin and other anti-Trump protesters, \n7  PPD gave no dispersal instructions or warnings that officers were planning to use force. \n8  Mr. Yedlin was not engaged in any conduct that justified the use of force against him. \n9  After being shot, Mr. Yedlin quickly ran from the protest area. As Mr. Yedlin and his \n10  wife drove home, they became so overcome with the fumes from the chemical agents \n11  that remained on his clothes that they had to hang his clothes out of the window of their \n12  car as they drove away. Mr. Yedlin was forced to go to an emergency room for \n13  treatment of the injuries caused by the PPDโs indiscriminate use of force. Mr. Yedlin \n14  remains distrustful that the PPD will violently react in future protests. \n15  e. Plaintiff Cynthia Guillen was peacefully chanting and filming the \n16  protest and police response, when PPD gassed her, and shot her in the upper torso on \n17  her breast and near her stomach and hip, with an unidentified projectile. Ms. Guillen \n18  had no warning that she would be gassed or shot, and was not engaged in any conduct \n19  justifying the use of force. PPDโs projectile struck with such force it knocked the wind \n20  out of Ms. Guillen, requiring other anti-Trump protesters to help her limp away from \n21  the assembly area in severe pain as she inhaled gas and coughed. PPDโs use of force \n22  caused Ms. Guillen substantial injuries, including pancreatitis triggered by the high-\n23  impact force with which PPD hit her. Since the August 22, 2017 protest, Ms. Guillen \n24  has experienced continuing medical problems, problems working, trouble sleeping, and \n25  anxiety. \n26  f.  Plaintiff Jacinta Gonzalez Goodman was peacefully protesting and \n27  coordinating public safety for anti-Trump protesters when PPD gassed her and other \n28  protesters, prematurely ending the planned event. Despite working as a liaison between \n27  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  PPD and protest organizers, and being in direct contact with PPD Officer Brockman in \n2  person and by text message just before the attack, Ms. Gonzalez Goodman received no \n3  dispersal  instructions  or  warnings  that  officers  were  planning  to  use  force.  Ms. \n4  Gonzalez Goodman was not engaged in any conduct that justified the use of force \n5  against her. PPDโs use of force caused Ms. Gonzalez Goodman to lose the opportunity \n6  to exercise her First Amendment rights as she planned. Despite participating in dozens \n7  of protests, Ms. Gonzalez Goodman had never seen officers act so aggressively towards \n8  peaceful  protesters  without  cause  or  warning.  Ms.  Gonzalez  Goodman  remains \n9  concerned and fearful that the PPD will react violently in response to future protests. \n10  67.  PPD officers deliberately fired at these Plaintiffs and at the upper \n11  torsos of anti-Trump protesters, based on their training and with the approval of PPD \n12  command  staff.  But  even  if  the  officers  had  done  nothing  more  than  shoot \n13  indiscriminately at the lower torso area of the adults, that put them in direct range of \n14  the  upper  torsos  and  heads  of  children  and  persons  in  wheelchairs  who  were \n15  participating. It was sheer luck that (to Plaintiffsโ knowledge) no child was struck in the \n16  head with a projectile given the indiscriminate deployment of over 590 munitions at the \n17  peaceful, fleeing assembly, especially with the use of weapons intended to incapacitate \n18  and having the potential to cause death or great bodily injury when used as the PPD did \n19  on this occasionโat close range and to the upper torso, head, and face areas of \n20  protestors. \n21  68.  There was no probable cause or reasonable suspicion to believe that \n22  anti-Trump protesters posed an immediate or credible threat of injury to police or any \n23  other person. \n24  69.  The PPD never attempted to disperse the demonstrators with less \n25  violent measures, including making announcements directing the crowd to disperse, or \n26  calling in the mounted police forces from the Tempe and Scottsdale police departments \n27  who were trained in crowd control measures and deployed to the demonstration for the \n28  purpose of assisting the PPD in this very task. Nor did PPD attempt to insulate the \n28  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  overwhelming  majority  of  the  protestors,  who  they  knew  had  been  peaceable \n2  throughout the demonstration, from unnecessary attack, injuries, and loss of basic \n3  rights, by separating from the crowd the handful of persons PPD claims had acted \n4  wrongly. \n5  70.  Many  hundreds  (and  perhaps  thousands)  of  peaceful  protestors \n6  including men, women, and children who had been engaged in no criminal activityโ\n7  and who were attempting to disperse after PPDโs attack beganโwere physically injured \n8  as they were shot with munitions, gas, pepper spray, and/or assaulted by the advancing \n9  Police Line. \n \n10 \nUsing Violence, PPD Violated the First Amendment Rights of Anti-Trump \n11  Protesters to Assemble and Speak Their Views Critical of Trump \n12  71.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference as if fully set forth \n13  herein the allegations set forth previously and subsequently in this complaint. \n14  72.  Trumpโs visit received significant publicity because he had announced \n15  that he would deliver remarks that might include the pardon of former Sheriff Arpaio. \n16  On August 22, 2017, when temperatures hit 108 degrees, record numbers of anti-Trump \n17  protesters began arriving in downtown Phoenix. Some gathered downtown, while \n18  others participated in marches and demonstrations nearby in advance of the main \n19  demonstration near the Convention Center set to begin around 4 P.M.  \n20  73.  The PPD segregated those gathering in downtown into two groups: \n21  those who were there to support Trump and anti-Trump protesters. PPD ordered anti-\n22  Trump protesters to limit their activities to the assigned โfree speech zone.โ \n23  74.  Near the only area PPD made available for the anti-Trump protesters \n24  to assemble, the so-called โfree-speech zone,โ PPD set up fence barricades lining the \n25  north and south sides of Monroe Street between 2nd and 3rd Streets for the purpose of \n26  keeping Trump supporters and anti-Trump protesters separated. The street between the \n27  two groups created a โsafe zoneโ for PPD in between the two factions. There was no \n28  barricade, however, on the south side of Monroe Street, crossing 2nd Street. PPDโs \n29  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  leaving this gap in the barricades left the Trump supporters who were exiting the Trump \n2  rally around 8:30 P.M. free to harass anti-Trump protesters. \n3  75.  Trump supporters attending Trumpโs rally entered the Convention \n4  Center through the south entrance. About 15,000 Trump supporters ended up inside the \n5  Convention Center for the Trump rally, while another 4,000 to 5,000 gathered at the \n6  south end of the Convention Center.  \n7  76.  Over  6,000  peaceful  anti-Trump  protesters  assembled  in  the \n8  designated  area  north  of  the  Convention  Center,  along  the  northern  sidewalks  of \n9  Monroe Street, and along Second and Third Streets.  \n10  77.  Given Trumpโs policies and his anticipated pardon of Arpaio, anti-\n11  Trump protesters had a strong First Amendment interest in having their messages heard \n12  by Trump supporters. Protestors included young children, students, elderly people, \n13  people with disabilities, and people of various races, ethnicities, and socio-economic \n14  backgrounds. Spurred by a desire for civic engagement after Trumpโs election, many \n15  anti-Trump protesters were exercising their First Amendment speech and assembly \n16  rights for the first time. These protestors marched, calmly gathered, displayed signs, set \n17  up water stations, and peacefully chanted as early as 1:00 P.M. Throughout the day \n18  anti-Trump protesters chanted the following messages: โDonโt Pardon!โ; โNo Trump \n19  no KKK, no fascist USA!โ; and โThis is what democracy looks like!โ Trump Protestors \n20  also held posters with similar political messages. See Ex. 1. \n21  78.  As a result of PPDโs unjustified and violent termination of the Trump \n22  Protest, PPD silenced anti-Trump protesters at the precise moment that they sought to \n23  have  their  opinions  heard  by  the  intended  audienceโPresident  Trump  and  his \n24  supporters as they left the Convention Center. \n25  Defendantsโ Violence Was Directed at Anti-Trump Protestors;  \nthe Trump Supporters Were Spared \n26 \n79.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference as if fully set forth \n27 \nherein the allegations set forth previously and subsequently in this complaint. \n28 \n30  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  80.  Despite the overwhelmingly โpeaceful, prepared, and civilโ nature of \n2  the group assembled and the discussions before with organizers, the police came \n3  dressed in full riot gear and armed with weaponry to confront anti-Trump protesters. \n4  Before the Trump Protest, PPD officials had โcoordinated multiple group meetingsโ \n5  with  Secret  Service  staff.  Indeed,  the  PPDโs  โDignitary  Protection  Branch  of \n6  Operationsโ orchestrated the movements of all of the high-level officials participating \n7  in the rally inside the Convention Center: the President, Vice President, Presidentโs \n8  Chief of Staff, and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. PPD managed \n9  their movements โin partnership with federal . . . law enforcement agencies.โ  \n10  79.  PPD limited the area where anti-Trump protesters could assemble to \n11  engage in their First Amendment activities to a small area north of the Convention \n12  Center. \n13  80.  Throughout  the  day,  PPD  showed  clear  antagonism  to  the  First \n14  Amendment rights of the anti-Trump protesters in this area, and preference for Trump \n15  supporters. For instance, one PPD officer advised other officers to โstay on this side. \n16  Theyโre more pro-police on this side than that side,โ encouraging police to stay away \n17  from anti-Trump protesters and near Trump supporters. Later, another PPD officer \n18  describing Trump supporters said, โThereโs just a different look about [the Trump \n19  supporters]. Theyโre so calm on this side,โ and said without basis that the anti-Trump \n20  protesters who oppose Trumpโs politics were paid to be there. \n21  81.  On information and belief, PPD officers who dispersed the anti-Trump \n22  protesters are members of the Phoenix Law Enforcement Association (โPLEAโ). PLEA \n23  is an organization whose president has accused organizations like Plaintiffs Puente and \n24  Poder of being โradical community groupsโ โwhose disrespect for law enforcement is \n25  total.โ A PLEA publication expressed that its law enforcement members view Puente \n26  and Poder as โaggressive radical groups [that] make noise in the interest of hurting the \n27  men and women who serve daily on the frontlines of Phoenix public safety.โ \n28 \n31  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  82.  PPDโs violent dispersal of anti-Trump protesters was at the exact time \n2  that  Trump  and  his  supporters  would  be  exiting  the  Trump  rally  inside  of  the \n3  Convention Center. PPD command staff told its officers that it would end the Trump \n4  Protest by 9:00 P.M. One PPD officer told another, โBoss said weโll be out of here by \n5  nine.โ To ensure officers were โout of [t]here by nine,โ without justification, PPD \n6  violently dispersed anti-Trump protesters around 8:30 P.M. \n7  83.   Prior to the launch of the first pepper bullet and tear gas canisters by \n8  PPD, the Trump Protest was carried out by the thousands assembled in a lawful manner. \n9  Assuming some isolated incidents of throwing plastic water bottles by a few, these did \n10  not justify firing and harming the many. No Trump protester threw any dangerous \n11  objects, nor initiated use of the weapons used by the PPD; they did kick the gas canisters \n12  thrown by police away from anti-Trump protesters, or were near the shaking fence. \n13  Rather than isolating and dealing with the small number of people whose conduct it \n14  viewed  as  improper,  PPD  resorted  to  violence  against  all.  There  was  no  lawful \n15  justification for this police action as the few persons who had been near the shaking the \n16  fence and threw plastic water bottles and kicked gas away from the protestors at around \n17  8:32 P.M. had immediately dispersed. Exs. 3-6. There was no need for the PPD to \n18  continue to escalate their demonstration of force by moving the Police Line through \n19  downtown, assaulting everyone in their path.  \n20  84.  As they swept through downtown, removing everyone in sight, PPD \n21  officers deliberately targeted anti-Trump protesters and persons who were chanting and \n22  holding anti-Trump posters expressing their views critical of Trump. \n23  85.  The  conduct  complained  of  herein  was  undertaken  pursuant  to \n24  policies, practices, and customs of the PPD, an agency of the City of Phoenix, and the \n25  City of Phoenix. At all relevant times, Defendants City of Phoenix and Chief Jeri L. \n26  Williams ratified the unlawful conduct of PPD officers and command staff. \n27   \n28   \n32  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  MUNICIPAL LIABILITY \n \n2 \nDefendant City of Phoenix Is Responsible for the Illegal Policies, Procedures, and \n3  Practices Utilized by by the PPD at the Trump Protest. \n4  86.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference as if fully set forth \n5  herein the allegations set forth previously and subsequently in this complaint. \n6  87.  The City of Phoenix has vested final decision making authority in its \n7  police chief, Defendant Williams, in the area of law enforcement and setting and \n8  implementing the policies and practices of the PPD including but not limited to the \n9  development, implementation and/or ratification of the PPDโs procedures, policies, \n10  regulations, practices, and/or customs related to its use of force in response to political \n11  protests, the proper handling of large political protests, demonstrations, and marches, \n12  and the use of weapons against civilians including gas and projectiles.  \n13  88.  On August 22, 2017, PPD officers engaged in an inordinate use of \n14  force, unnecessarily injuring thousands of people at the precise moment they intended \n15  to express their views critical of Trump, without warnings. Immediately following this \n16  violent display of force, and despite acknowledging that anti-Trump protesters were \n17  โpeaceful, prepared, and civil,โ the procedures and violence used by PPD were ratified \n18  and found well within accepted City practices by the key policy makers for the City of \n19  Phoenix in these areasโChief Williams and City Manager Zuercher.  \n20  89.  In a press conference the same night (following the PPD assault of \n21  hundreds and possibly thousands of anti-Trump protesters without legal justification, \n22  with  officers  shouting  obscenities  at  the  protesters  and  indiscriminately  using \n23  dangerous weapons to disperse without warning, in violation of the constitutional \n24  protections of speech and to be free from excessive force and PPD policy), Defendant \n25  Williams stated that she was โjust so proud to be the police chief of men and women \n26  who  literally  showed  that  professionalismโunder  contentious  scenarios  and \n27  situationsโthey demonstrated it flawlessly.โ Chief Williams also repeatedly stated that \n28  on August 22, 2017, the night of Trumpโs rally, she โbelieve[s] the actions of our \n33  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  officers reflected the direction I gave them,โ and that โour community members went \n2  home safely.โ \n3  90.  Then-Mayor Stanton stood by Chief Williams in this press conference \n4  as she praised the PPD officers for displaying โprofessionalismโ as they violently \n5  silenced the views of anti-Trump protesters viewed as โradicalโ and harmful to law \n6  enforcement by PPD officers. \n7  91.   City Manager Ed Zuercher issued a memorandum on August 28, \n8  2017, to Chief Williams stating,  \n9  What  all  members  of  the  Phoenix  Police  Department \n10  accomplished  on  August  22  was  notable.  In  an  emotional \n11  atmosphere,  our  police  officers  showed  professionalism  in \n12  ensuring the safety and First Amendment rights of the community. \n13  There were no serious injuries or property damage and only four \n14  related arrests. . . .  \n15  92.  The City of Phoenix has a โstrongโ City Manager form of government, \n16  with a โweakโ Mayoral role; Zuercher has the authority to hire and fire the Chief of \n17  Police. Zuercherโs praise of Chief Williams, and the PPDโs assaults on anti-Trump \n18  protesters under her leadership as โnotable and โprofessionalโ further demonstrate \n19  after-the-fact ratification by the relevant Phoenix officials of the above-described PPD \n20  unconstitutional violent and indiscriminate acts on August 22, 2017. \n \n21 \nAs a Matter of Policy and Practice Defendant Williams Allowed Defendant City of \n22  Phoenix to Maintain Inadequate Equipment to Peacefully and Lawfully Control \nProtests and Demonstrations. \n23 \n93.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference as if fully set forth \n24 \nherein the allegations set forth previously and subsequently in this complaint. \n25 \n94.  Defendant Williams and her delegated command staff were aware \n26 \nprior to August 22, 2017, that the City did not possess the proper equipment, and in \n27 \n28 \n34  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  sufficient amount, to adequately deliver warnings and dispersal messages to protestors \n2  prior to and after commencing of the use of force. \n3  95.  The only verbal dispersal order that was given on August 22, 2017, \n4  was made about 9:00 P.M. in English only, despite PPDโs knowledge that a significant \n5  number of the protestors were Spanish speakers. In a report after the protest, City \n6  Manager Ed Zuercher, and Defendant Williams admitted that in the future the City \n7  needed to โincrease the number and useโ of bullhorns and megaphones, and other \n8  means for crowd communication and direction. \n9  96.  Moreover, after the events of August 22, 2017, Defendant Williams \n10  and Defendant City of Phoenix conceded that:  \n11  Several large protests and demonstrations have confirmed the need to \n12  upgrade the Police Departmentโs communication capabilities for safety \n13  and legal requirements. The current communication equipment, LRAD-\n14  100X, is a backpack system that was purchased in 2010. \n15  Ex. 14 at 18.  \n16  97.  It was not until June 13, 2018, that Defendant Williams submitted a \n17  procurement request to the Phoenix City Council for a new long range acoustic device \n18  โspecifically designed to address large crowds.โ  \n19  98.  Given the demonstrated lawless actions by the PPD under the direction \n20  of Defendant Williams, use of the particular LRAD device Williams has requested must \n21  be subjected to great scrutiny. It has been found in other jurisdictions that, when used \n22  at the volume levels intended by PPD, the LRAD itself becomes a weapon of excessive \n23  force and great harms, including irreversible damage to the hearing of protesters. \n \n24 \nAs a Matter of Policy, Practice, and Custom, Defendant City Through Defendant \n25  Williams Failed to Adequately Train PPD Officers in Lawful Crowd Control \nTechniques. \n26 \n99.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference as if fully set forth \n27 \nherein the allegations set forth previously and subsequently in this complaint. \n28 \n35  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  100.  Defendant Williams and her delegated command staff were aware that \n2  the unlawful use of dangerous weapons in violent and unlawful ways to break up \n3  peaceful associations and speech is a regular practice of PPD personnel, and a custom \n4  ingrained in the marrow of the PPD. It was therefore critical to take all steps necessary \n5  to ensure that official policy was changed and officers were trained in a manner \n6  sufficient to address the practice and custom to violate First and Fourth Amendment \n7  rights. \n8  101.  PPD policy directs that bean bags should not be fired at closer than \n9  five feet and that the lower torso, legs, and buttocks should be the primary targets. The \n10  PPD policy on bean bags prohibits hitting the head, neck, and spine and warns that \n11  โshots to non-target areasโ (head, neck, spine, thorax, and spine) โcan result in fatal or \n12  serious injury.โ \n13  102.  As for the use of pepper spray, PPD policy specifically orders, โDo \n14  not use within three (3) feet of a subject as soft tissue damage could occur.โ (Emphasis \n15  in policy.)  \n16  103.  PPD policy is silent on what officers and command staff must do to \n17  ensure that police warnings prior to dispersal are given and heard. Despite the legal \n18  necessity of prior warnings, the policy provides no guidance on what warnings or \n19  dispersal instructions must be given to protestors exercising their First Amendment \n20  rights.  \n21  104.  Additionally,  PPD  policy  does  not  restrict  the  use  of  less-lethal \n22  munitions on already dispersing crowds or individuals, and crowds that are retreating, \n23  nor or on persons who are using recording devices to lawfully document public police \n24  actions.  \n25  105.  The failure to maintain adequate policies, and to regularly train PPD \n26  personnel on these and proper crowd control, led to the injuries suffered by Plaintiffs. \n27  The need for training in this instance was obvious.  \n28 \n36  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  106.  Defendant  Williams  and  Defendant  City  have  known  of  the \n2  deficiencies in PPD policies and training since at least 2010 when its officers violently \n3  shot pepper spray at protesters marching for immigration reform from Falcon Park to \n4  Tent City. \n5  107.  In October 2014, at demonstration in downtown Phoenix to protest \n6  police brutality, PPD officers indiscrimately and without warning fired pepper bullets \n7  at protestors. \n8  108.  Similarly, at a rally at Phoenix City Hall in response to the fatal \n9  shooting of Alton Sterling in July 2016, PPD repeatedly pepper sprayed protestors \n10  without warning as a โcrowd-control measure.โ \n11  109.  In  all  of  the  above  actions,  the  City  has  acted  with  deliberate \n12  indifference to the rights of the public to engage in lawful expressive activity in \n13  traditional public fora within the City, and to be free from excessive force. \n14  110.  Despite the long history of unlawful PPD conduct at demonstrations, \n15  and the longstanding deficiencies in the training of PPD line and command staff on \n16  proper law enforcement conduct at demonstrations and regarding the use of force at \n17  peaceful demonstrations, the City failed to adequately train its officers and command \n18  staff prior to August 22, 2017, in the rights of demonstrators, lawful crowd control, \n19  dispersal orders, separating those engaged in unlawful conduct from those engaged in \n20  lawful  conduct,  the  permissible  use  of  โless-than-lethalโ  weapons  in  crowd \n21  control/demonstration situations, and the permissible use of force and circumstances \n22  justifying it in such situations. This failure amounted to deliberate indifference to the \n23  rights of persons with whom the police come into contact.  \n24  111.  Defendant  Williams  had  and  delegated  final  responsibility  and \n25  authority to persons within her command staff to act as the final policy maker at the \n26  Trump Protest to decide whether to declare the assembly unlawful, whether to give \n27  warnings or instructions to disperse, and whether to use force. Defendant Williams has \n28  stated that at all times during this protest the PPD officers and command staff on the \n37  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  scene were acting at her direction. The persons who made these decisions acted as the \n2  delegated policy maker for the City of Phoenix on these issues. There was no time, \n3  opportunity, or procedure for anyone to review or revise the decisions made by these \n4  delegated policy makers prior to their final implementation. \n5  CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n6  112.  The proposed damages class is defined as those persons who were \n7  present on August 22, 2017, at the Trump Protest area north of the Convention Center \n8  which was designated as the โfree-speech zoneโ (the area for anti-Trump protestors \n9  bounded to the south by Monroe Street, 2nd Street to the west, and 3rd street to the east) \n10  and forced by PPD onto adjacent streets at any point between 8:25 and 10:00 P.M., who \n11  did not engage in any conduct justifying the Defendantsโ use of force against them, and \n12  who were subjected to the PPDโs dispersal by the use of force, or other unlawful police \n13  activity  arising  from  the  police  response  to  anti-Trump  protesters.  The  proposed \n14  damages subclasses are defined as:  \n15  a.  All persons who were unlawfully dispersed by the use of gas, pepper \n16  spray, pepper bullets, or other chemical agents; \n17  b.  All persons who were unlawfully dispersed by PPD by being struck with \n18  projectiles of any type.  \n19  113.  The proposed injunctive relief class is defined as all persons who have \n20  in the past, including those present at the anti-Trump protest on August 22, 2017, \n21  between 8:25 and 10:00 P.M., or may in the future, participate in, or be present at, \n22  demonstrations within the City of Phoenix in the exercise of their rights of free speech \n23  and assembly without engaging in any conduct justifying the use of force.  \n24  114.  In accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a), the class \n25  and subclasses are so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. Plaintiffs \n26  do not know the exact number of class members. Defendantsโ After-Action Report \n27  documents that more than 500 projectiles of some type were deployed, and this figure \n28  does not include pepper spray or tear gas deployed by PPD officers. Further, PPD \n38  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  counted over 6,000 anti-Trump protesters assembled outside of the Convention Center. \n2  Thus, Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that there are in excess of \n3  500 members of the class. \n4  115.  In accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a), the claims \n5  that the class membersโ Fourth, First, and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated \n6  raise common questions of law and fact.  \n7  116.  In accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a), the claims \n8  of  the  representative  Plaintiffs  are  typical  of  the  class  they  represent.  Each \n9  representative Plaintiff was present in or about the area north of the Convention Center \n10  designated for assembly by anti-Trump protesters on August 22, 2017, between the \n11  hours of 8:25 P.M. and 10:00 P.M. Each representative Plaintiff was subjected to force \n12  in the streets north of the Convention Center or as he or she attempted to disperse from \n13  the assembly area, or as she or he attempted to disperse along Second, Third, Fourth, \n14  or Fifth Streets, or in the vicinity of those streets. No representative Plaintiff did \n15  anything to attack or threaten to attack any person, or interfere with any lawful action \n16  of anyone, or resist arrest, or escape. Except for their presence in the assembly area \n17  north  of  the  Convention  Center,  and  peaceful,  verbal,  non-violent  protests,  and \n18  observing Defendants, Plaintiffs did nothing to justify dispersal by the use of violent \n19  force. Defendants had no legal justification for ordering any representative Plaintiff to \n20  disperse and no legal justification for using force against any representative Plaintiff. \n21  117.  Each representative Plaintiff has the same interests and suffered the \n22  same type of injuries as the class members. The claims of each representative Plaintiff \n23  arose because of PPDโs unlawful dispersal orders and use of force against the anti-\n24  Trump protesters. The claims of the representative Plaintiffs are based upon the same \n25  legal theories as the claims of the class members. Each representative class member \n26  suffered actual physical injuries as a result of Defendantsโ unlawful dispersal and use \n27  of force. \n28 \n39  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  118.  In  accordance  with  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  23(a),  the \n2  representative Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. The \n3  interests of the representative Plaintiffs are consistent with and not antagonistic to the \n4  interests of the class. \n5  119.  In  accordance  with  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  23(b)(1)(A), \n6  prosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk \n7  that inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the \n8  class would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the parties opposing the \n9  class. \n10  120.  In  accordance  with  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  23(b)(1)(B), \n11  prosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk \n12  of adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would, as a \n13  practical matter, substantially impair or impede the interests of the other members of \n14  the class to protect their interests. \n15  121.  In accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2), the \n16  Defendants have acted, threatened to act, and will continue to act on grounds generally \n17  applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or declaratory \n18  relief with respect to the class as a whole. \n19  122.  In accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3), the \n20  questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any \n21  questions affecting only individual members.  \n22  123.  In accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3), this class \n23  action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of \n24  the controversy between the parties. The interest of members of the class in individually \n25  controlling the prosecution of a separate action is low, in that most class members \n26  would be unable to individually prosecute any action at all. Plaintiffs are informed and \n27  believe and thereon allege that the amounts at stake for individuals are so small that \n28  separate suits would be impossible or impracticable. Plaintiffs are informed and believe \n40  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  and thereon allege that most members of the class will not be able to find counsel to \n2  represent them. Plaintiffs are informed and believe that Defendants have no records, or \n3  virtually no records or evidence of any kind, justifying any use of force against \n4  individual anti-Trump protesters, and that Defendantsโ only justifications for any use \n5  of force against anti-Trump protesters is based on facts which apply to all anti-Trump \n6  protesters equally. \n7  124.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that it is desirable to concentrate all \n8  litigation in one forum because all of the claims arise in the same location, date, and \n9  time, i.e., in the vicinity of the streets and areas north of the Convention Center on \n10  August 22, 2017, between 8:25 P.M. and 10:00 P.M., and it will promote judicial \n11  efficiency to resolve the common questions of law and fact in one forum, rather than in \n12  multiple courts. \n13  125.  Plaintiffs do not know the identities of all of the class members. \n14  Plaintiffs are aware of the identities of approximately 200 class members. Plaintiffs are \n15  informed and believe and thereon allege that the identities of most class members may \n16  be obtained from organizations which sponsored, organized, and participated in the \n17  anti-Trump protesters including Puente, Poder, and other organizations. Plaintiffs are \n18  informed and believe and thereon allege that the identities of class members may be \n19  obtained from calls for assistance made to Puente, Poder, and other organizers. \n20  126.  In accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3), class \n21  members must be furnished with the best notice practicable under the circumstances, \n22  including individual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable \n23  effort. Plaintiffs contemplate notice through organizational โhotlinesโ devoted to the \n24  events of August 22, 2017, distribution of leaflets in the downtown Phoenix area, social \n25  media, and at gatherings of the groups which organized the anti-Trump protesters, as \n26  well as calls to Plaintiffsโ counselโs office in Arizona. Plaintiffs contemplate that the \n27  class notice will inform class members of the following: \n28  a.  The pendency of the class action, and the issues common to the class; \n41  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  b.  The nature of the action; \n2  c.  Their right to โopt outโ of the action within a given time, in which \n3  event they will not be bound by a decision rendered in the class action; \n4  d.  Their right, if they do not โopt out,โ to be represented by their own \n5  counsel and enter an appearance in the case; otherwise, they will be \n6  represented by the named Plaintiffs and their counsel; and  \n7  e.  Their right, if they do not โopt out,โ to share in any recovery in favor \n8  of the class, and conversely to be bound by any judgment on the \n9  common issues, adverse to the class.  \n10  127.  Plaintiffs  are  represented  by  counsel  with  extensive  class-action \n11  experience in civil rights cases. Attorneys Stormer, Piovia-Scott, Pรกnuco, Pochoda, \n12  Brody, and Hill have successfully litigated a number of civil rights and class actions \n13  including protester cases that have resulted in multi-million-dollar settlements and \n14  injunctive relief. \n15  128.  As a result of the conduct of Defendants described above, Plaintiffs \n16  and class members have been denied their constitutional rights. Defendantsโ policies, \n17  practices, conduct, and acts alleged herein have resulted and will continue to result in \n18  irreparable injury to Plaintiffs, including but not limited to further violations of their \n19  constitutional rights. Plaintiffs have no plain, adequate, or complete remedy at law to \n20  address  the  wrongs  described  herein.  Plaintiffs  therefore  seek  injunctive  relief \n21  restraining Defendants from continuing to engage in and enforce the unconstitutional \n22  and unlawful policies, practices, conduct, and acts described herein. \n \n23 \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n24  EXCESSIVE FORCE \n(Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \n25 \n(All the class representatives, individually, and on behalf of the class they seek to \nrepresent, against all Defendants) \n26 \n129.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference as if fully set forth \n27 \nherein the allegations set forth previously and subsequently in this complaint. \n28 \n42  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  130.  The conduct of each Defendant violated the rights of Plaintiffs and \n2  class members to not be subjected to the use of excessive force, as guaranteed by the \n3  Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and entitles \n4  Plaintiffs to bring suit and recover damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \n5  131.  As a proximate result of the wrongful, malicious, and violent acts of \n6  Defendants, and the fright caused Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs and each of them, suffered \n7  physical injuries including being hit by projectiles and inhaling gas and pepper spray, \n8  experienced shock and injury to the nervous system, and were injured in their health, \n9  strength, and activity, suffering extreme and severe mental anguish and physical pain, \n10  anxiety, humiliation, and/or emotional distress. \n11  132.  By reason of the aforementioned acts and omissions of Defendants, \n12  Plaintiffs, and each of them, have incurred and will incur in the future, medical and \n13  related expenses, past and future lost earnings, loss of property, and/or other special \n14  and general damages, in an amount according to proof, but in excess of the jurisdictional \n15  limits of this Court. \n16  133.  In doing the foregoing wrongful acts, the individual Defendants, and \n17  each  of  them,  acted  in  intentional,  reckless,  and/or  callous  disregard  for  the \n18  constitutional rights of Plaintiffs. The wrongful acts, and each of them, were willful, \n19  oppressive, fraudulent, and malicious. \n \n20 \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n21  FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND ASSOCIATION \n(First and Fourteenth Amendments, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \n22 \n(All the class representatives, individually, and on behalf of the class they seek to \nrepresent, against all Defendants) \n23 \n134.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference as if fully set forth \n24 \nherein the allegations set forth previously and subsequently in this complaint. \n25 \n135.  The actions of the Defendants, as set forth above, violated Plaintiffsโ \n26 \nrights to freedom of speech and association guaranteed by the First Amendment to the \n27 \nConstitution of the United States. Defendants acted to eliminate any possibility of \n28 \n43  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  Plaintiffsโ exercise of their rights to speech and association by the unnecessary and \n2  violent acts described above. Further, Defendants discriminated against protestors \n3  based on their viewpoint only ending the ability of those who had an anti-Trump \n4  message  to  speak,  and  provided  no  alternative  means  for  continuing  speech  and \n5  assembly. \n6  136.  As a proximate result of the wrongful, malicious, and violent acts of \n7  Defendants, Plaintiffs and each of them, suffered compensable and irreparable injuries \n8  including having their rights to engage in the constitutionally protected activities of \n9  political speech and assembly truncated, extinguished and/or deprived them. \n10  137.  In doing the foregoing wrongful acts, the individual Defendants, and \n11  each  of  them,  acted  in  intentional,  reckless,  and/or  callous  disregard  for  the \n12  constitutional rights of Plaintiffs. The wrongful acts, and each of them, were willful, \n13  oppressive, fraudulent and malicious. \n \n14 \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n15  DUE PROCESS \n(Fourteenth Amendment, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \n16 \n(All the class representatives, individually and on behalf of the class they seek to \nrepresent, against all Defendants) \n17 \n138.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference as if fully set forth \n18 \nherein the allegations set forth previously and subsequently in this complaint. \n19 \n139.  The actions of the Defendants including but not limited to targeting \n20 \nanti-Trump  protesters  and  using  excessive  force  without  warning  or  declaring  an \n21 \nunlawful assembly without regard to legitimate law enforcement objectives, were \n22 \ndeliberately indifferent to the rights and well being of anti-Trump protesters as set forth \n23 \nabove. The level of force and violence employed by Defendants shocks the conscience \n24 \nand violates Plaintiffsโ right to due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth \n25 \nAmendment of the United States Constitution.  \n26 \n140.  As a proximate result of the wrongful, malicious, and violent acts of \n27 \nDefendants, and the fright caused Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs and each of them, suffered \n28 \n44  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  physical injuries including being hit by projectiles and inhaling gas and pepper spray, \n2  experienced shock and injury to the nervous system, and were injured in their health, \n3  strength, and activity, suffering extreme and severe mental anguish and physical pain, \n4  anxiety, humiliation, and emotional distress. \n5  141.  By reason of the aforementioned acts and omissions of Defendants, \n6  Plaintiffs, and each of them, have incurred and will incur in the future, medical and \n7  related expenses, past and future lost earnings, loss of property, and/or other special \n8  and general damages, in an amount according to proof, but in excess of the jurisdictional \n9  limits of this Court. \n10  142.  In doing the foregoing wrongful acts, the individual Defendants, and \n11  each  of  them,  acted  in  intentional,  reckless,  and/or  callous  disregard  for  the \n12  constitutional rights of Plaintiffs. The wrongful acts, and each of them, were willful, \n13  oppressive, fraudulent and malicious. \n \n14 \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n15  EQUAL PROTECTION \n(First and Fourteenth Amendments, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \n16 \n(All the class representatives, individually, and on behalf of the class they seek to \nrepresent, against all Defendants) \n17 \n143.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference as if fully set forth \n18 \nherein the allegations set forth previously and subsequently in this complaint. \n19 \n144.  The actions of the Defendants, as set forth above, violated Plaintiffsโ \n20 \nFourteenth Amendment rights to equal protection of the laws of the United States. The \n21 \nPPD  discriminated  against  protestors  based  on  their  viewpoint,  made  no  lawful \n22 \ndeclaration of unlawful assembly, dispersed protestors without warning or justification, \n23 \nand provided no alternative means for continuing speech and assembly. \n24 \n145.  The actions of Defendants impermissibly treated the Trump supporters \n25 \nbetter than other persons assembled for the Trump Protest in violation of both the First \n26 \nAmendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by granting \n27 \nthe Trump supporters, whose views it found acceptable, the use of a public forum, while \n28 \n45  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  denying the same public forum to those wishing to express views less favored by \n2  Defendants. \n3  146.  As a proximate result of the wrongful, malicious, and violent acts of \n4  Defendants, and the fright caused Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs and each of them, suffered \n5  physical injuries including being hit by projectiles and inhaling gas and pepper spray, \n6  experienced shock and injury to the nervous system, and were injured in their health, \n7  strength and activity, suffering extreme and severe mental anguish and physical pain, \n8  anxiety, humiliation, and emotional distress. \n9  147.  By reason of the aforementioned acts and omissions of Defendants, \n10  Plaintiffs, and each of them, have incurred and will incur in the future, medical and \n11  related expenses, past and future lost earnings, loss of property, and other special and \n12  general damages, in an amount according to proof, but in excess of the jurisdictional \n13  limits of this Court. \n14  148.  In doing the foregoing wrongful acts, the individual Defendants, and \n15  each  of  them,  acted  in  intentional,  reckless,  and/or  callous  disregard  for  the \n16  constitutional rights of Plaintiffs. The wrongful acts, and each of them, were willful, \n17  oppressive, fraudulent and malicious. \n18  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n19  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs seek the following relief: \n20  A. Declaratory relief concerning the unconstitutionality of Defendantsโ actions \n21  as described herein; \n22  B.

Compensatory, general, statutory, and special damages for themselves and the \n27  class they represent in an amount according to proof; \n28 \n46  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1  D.
