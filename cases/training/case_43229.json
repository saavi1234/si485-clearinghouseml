    "summary": "<p>This class-action lawsuit challenged Maine&rsquo;s system of appointing private attorneys to provide representation to indigent criminal defendants. On March 1, 2022, five people currently being represented in criminal proceedings by appointed counsel filed a complaint and motion for class certification in Maine&rsquo;s Kennebec County Superior Court. The plaintiffs sued the executive director of the Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services in his official capacity, the chair of the Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services in his official capacity, and the commissioners of the Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services in their official capacities under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 and Maine law. Represented by the ACLU of Maine, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief in addition to costs and attorneys&rsquo; fees.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs claimed that the Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services (MCILS) failed to promulgate rules to administer and fund the indigent defense system and develop standards, minimum qualifications, specialized training, and performance evaluation to the attorneys providing indigent defense services. The plaintiffs alleged the system violated indigent defendants&rsquo; right to effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and Article I &sect; 6 of the Maine Constitution, the state counterpart to the Sixth Amendment. The plaintiffs also challenged the MCILS&rsquo;s &ldquo;lawyer of the day&rdquo; program, which appointed a few attorneys each day to be available for any defendant scheduled for an initial appearance. The plaintiffs alleged the program created an unconstitutional risk of ineffective assistance of counsel, because there were not enough attorneys available to enter initial pleas, advocate for pre-trial release, or negotiate bond.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs defined the putative class as &ldquo;[a]ll individuals who currently are or in the future will be eligible for the appointment of competent defense counsel by the Superior or District Court pursuant to 15 M.R.S. &sect;810 because they have been indicted for a crime punishable by imprisonment in the State Prison and they lack sufficient means to employ counsel.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>One of plaintiffs' claims regarding whether MCILS failed to adopt rules required by law was dismissed on June 2, 2022. On July 13, 2022, the court granted the plaintiffs class action status on behalf of indigent defendants in Maine.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>",

Plaintiffs meet the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2).   12\nIII.  Conclusion   13\ni\n\nMOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION\nThis case is a challenge to Defendants' failure to comply with their constitutional and\nstatutory obligations to implement a system that provides effective representation for individuals\nwho are unable to afford counsel. Plaintiffs move this Court to certify and maintain this case as a\nclass action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(2) of the Maine Rules of Civil Procedure, and to\nappoint undersigned counsel as class counsel. As set forth below in the incorporated memorandum\nof law, Plaintiffs meet all of the requirements for class certification in this case, and undersigned\ncounsel are able to provide capable representation to the class.\n1\n\nINCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW\nI.  Background \nThis is a statewide class action on behalf of adults who are eligible for court-appointed\n\"competent defense counsel\" pursuant to the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution;\nArticle I, Section 6 of the Maine Constitution; and 15 M.R.S. § 810. The defendants in this\naction—the Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services (\"MCILS\" or \"the Commission\") and\nits executive director and commissioners—are charged with carrying out the State's constitutional\nand statutory responsibility to provide meaningful representation to members of the class. In\nparticular, MCILS is responsible for \"[d]evelop[ing] and maintain[ing] a system that uses\nappointed private attorneys . . . to provide quality and efficient indigent legal services.\" 4 M.R.S.\n§ 1804(3)(A). But Defendants have failed to comply with those obligations to implement an\neffective system of indigent defense. And that failure, in turn, has created an unconstitutional risk\nthat the class members will be denied effective assistance of counsel.\nDefendants have failed to discharge their constitutional and statutory duties in several\ndistinct ways. Perhaps most notably, Defendants have failed to promulgate standards governing\nthe delivery of legal services—including standards for the minimum qualifications of counsel,\nmaximum caseloads, evaluation of counsel, and conflicts of interest. See 4 M.R.S. § 1804(2);\nComplaint irg 46-55. Defendants are required to develop these standards—both constitutionally\nand by statute (see id.)—and uniform standards for delivery of indigent legal services are \"critical\nfor public defense services because all  public defenders are required to meet the same\nconstitutional standard of effectiveness.\"' Defendants have also failed to perform adequate\noversight of rostered attorneys, including assessing whether attorneys are performing fundamental\nIrene Oritseweyinmi Joe, Structuring the Public Defender, 106 Iowa L. Rev. 113, 163 (2020).\n2\n\ndefense functions like visiting clients, returning client calls, filing appropriate motions, and\nretaining necessary expert support. See 4 M.R.S. §§ 1804(3)(G); 1805(3); Complaint ¶¶ 49-51.\nDefendants are again required by statute to perform this oversight, which is critical to evaluating\nwhether defense counsel are providing effective assistance of counsel—including,f or example, by\nfiling appropriate motions,2 and communicating with clients.3 Still more, Defendants have failed\nto adequately compensate and train rostered attorneys. See 4 M.R.S. §§ 1804(2)(B),( 3)(D),( 3)(A),\n(3)(F); Complaint IN 58-66. Again, Defendants are required by the federal and statute\nconstitutions and by statute to undertake this function, and a failure to properly train public defense\nattorneys poses a threat to an indigent defendant's constitutional rights.4\nIn light of these failures, Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief under the Maine\nAdministrative Procedure Act,5  M.R.S. § 8058, the Maine Declaratory Judgments Act, 14 M.R.S.\n§ 5951, and the Civil Rights Act of 1871,42 U.S.C. § 1983, to require Defendants to adopt and\nenforce rules, practices, and systems necessary to comply with their legal and constitutional\nobligations. The named Plaintiffs also seek certification of this case as a class action pursuant to\nRule 23(b)(2) of the Maine Rules of Civil Procedure to pursue an efficient and just resolution of\nall class members' claims. The proposed class consists of:\nAll individuals who are or will be eligible for the appointment of\ncompetent defense counsel by the Superior or District Court\npursuant to 15 M.R.S. § 810 because they have been indicted for a\ncrime punishable by imprisonment in the State Prison and they lack\nsufficient means to retain counsel.\n2 Kimmelman v. Morrison, 477 U.S. 365, 384 (1986); United States v. Wadsworth, 830 F.2d 1500, 1510 (9th Cir.\n1987).\nCommonwealth v. Brooks, 839 A.2d 245, 250 (Pa. 2003).\n3 \nMiranda v. Clark County, 319 F.3d 465,4 71 (9th Cir. 2003).\n4 \n3\n\nBecause all elements for class certification are satisfied, and because counsel for Plaintiffs are able\nto capably represent the proposed class, the Plaintiffs respectfully request that this motion be\ngranted.\nIL  Discussion\nA class should be certified if it provides a superior vehicle for resolving a dispute, if class\ncounsel is capable of adequately representing the interests of the class, and if the following\nconditions are met:( 1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2)\nthere are questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the\nrepresentative party are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative\nparty will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. M.R. Civ. P. 23(a). Additionally,\nbecause Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, they must satisfy the requirements ofR ule\n23(b)(2) by demonstrating that \"the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds\ngenerally  applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final  injunctive relief or\ncorresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.\" M.R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).\nWhile plaintiffs bear the burden of establishing that class certification is warranted, they\nare not required at this stage of the litigation to prove that they will prevail on the merits. See, e.g.\nMe. Ass' n of Retirees v. Bd. of Trs. of the Me. Pub. Ret. Sys., No. 1:12-cv-59-GZS, 2012 WL\n5874783, at *1 (D. Me. November 20, 2012)( \"[A]t the class certification stage any inquiry into\nthe merits is limited 'to the extent that the merits overlap the Rule 23 criteria.'( quoting Campbell\nv. First American Title Ins. Co., 269 F.R.D. 68, 71 (D. Me. 2010))); see also Applegate v. Formed\nFiber Tee/i., LLC,N o. 2:10-cv-00473-GZS, 2012 WL 3065542, at *2( D. Me. July 27,2 012).5 The\n5 \"Reported cases brought as class actions in Maine are rare.\" See 2 Maine Civil Practice § 23:1, at 603 (2015-2016\ned.). Maine courts therefore commonly rely on decisions of federal courts interpreting Rule 23 of the Federal Rules\nof Civil Procedure for guidance. See Bean v. Cummings, 2008 ME 18,  11, 939 A.2d 676 (stating that courts \"value\n4\n\nquestion at this stage is \"whether a class action is the most appropriate method of adjudicating\nPlaintiffs' claims.\" Coffin v. Bowater Inc., 228 F.R.D. 397, 401 (D. Me. 2005). In making that\ndetermination, the requirements in Rule 23(a) \"should be liberally construed [so as] not to\nundermine the policies underlying the class action rule.\" Lessard v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 103\nF.R.D. 608, 610( D. Me. 1984); see also Nilsen v. York Co., 219 F.R.D. 19, 21 (D. Me. 2003).\nPlaintiffs' action meets all the criteria for certification.\nA.  Joinder is impracticable.\nThe first requirement for class certification is satisfied when \"the class is so numerous that\njoinder of all members is impracticable.\" M.R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1). While there is no minimum\nnumber of class members necessary to establish this element, one court has recognized \"more than\nforty individuals\" as a useful benchmark. See Coffin, 228 F.R.D. at 402; see also Venegas v. Glob.\nAircraft Serv., Inc., 159 F. Supp. 3d 93, 98; Garcia-Rubiera v. Calderon, 570 F.3d 443, 460 (1st\nCir. 2009); Van Meter v. Harvey, 272 F.R.D. 274, 282( D. Me. 2011).\nHere, the class is so numerous that joinder of all its members is impracticable. The class\nmay contain as many as 7,269 members, which is the number of currently pending felony cases in\nthe Maine Unified Criminal Docket courts across the State, as of February 11, 2022. See \"Pending\nUCD Cases as of February 11, 2022,\" attached as Exhibit A. Some portion of defendants in these\ncases have hired their own attorneys, but Plaintiffs believe that number to be less than 20%.6\nIn addition to the sheer number of cases—pending in every corner of the State—the\ncomposition of the class is constantly changing as new cases are filed and older cases are resolved,\nconstructions and comments on the federal rule as aids in construing our parallel provision\"( emphasis and quotation\nmarks omitted)).\n6 See Caroline Wolf Harlow, Ph.D., U.S. Dep't of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Statistics,\nSpecial Report: Defense Counsel in Criminal Cases tbl. 6 (Nov. 2000), available at https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/\npdf/dccc.pdf( documenting that only 17.6% of defendants in felony cases in the 76 largest counties in America were\nrepresented by privately retained attorneys).\n5\n\ncompounding the difficulties any attempt at joinder of individual actions would create. Risinger v.\nConcannon, 201 F.R.D. 16, 19 (D. Me. 2001)( the \"geographic dispersion\" of the class and the\nlikelihood of unidentified and future class members both demonstrate that joinder is impractical).\nPlaintiffs are also bringing this action for the benefit of individuals who have not yet been accused\nof crimes, which further demonstrates that joinder is impracticable. See, e.g., Van Meter, 272\nF.R.D. at 282 (finding joinder impracticable where future class members have not yet been\nidentified); Bruce v.  Christian, 113 F.R.D. 554, 557 (S.D.N.Y. 1986) (finding joinder\nimpracticable where class included individuals who would be affected in the future, and fluid\nnature of the class meant identity of individuals would change even as harm and basic parameters\nof the group affected would remain constant).\nB.  There are question of law and fact common to the class.\nThe second requirement for class certification is that \"there are questions of law or fact\ncommon to the class.\" M.R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2). The commonality requirement is a \"low bar.\" Van\nMeter, 272 F.R.D. at 282; Applegate,2 012 WL 3065542,a t *10. In Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes,\nthe Supreme Court clarified that the commonality requirement is satisfied when \"class members\nhave suffered the same injury\" and the theory of the case rests on a \"common contention\" that is\n\"capable of classwide resolution—which means that determination of its truth or falsity will\nresolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.\" 564 U.S.\n338, 349-350 (2011). \"[F]or purposes of Rule 23(a)(2) even a single common question will do.\"\nId. at 359 (cleaned up); see, e.g., Curtis v. Scholarship Storage, No. 2:14-cv-303-NT, 2016 WL\n308779, at *2 (D. Me. Jan. 25, 2016) (applying Dukes to find the commonality requirement\nsatisfied where all plaintiffs were \"subjected to the same policies and practices\").\nAs outlined in the complaint (1193), this case rests on resolution of a set of common\nquestions, including:\n6\n\ni.  Whether Defendants have failed to comply with their constitutional and statutory\nobligations to implement an effective indigent-defense system, including their\nspecific obligations to develop standards governing the delivery of indigent legal\nservices; establish training programs and attorney qualifications; and monitor the\nindigent-defense system;\nii.  Whether Defendants' failure to adequately fund the delivery of indigent-defense\nservices, and, in particular, to ensure that attorneys are appropriately compensated,\nresults in the provision of constitutionally deficient representation;\niii.  Whether Defendants' implementation of the lawyer-of-the-day system fails to\nensure the provision of effective representation at the start of a defendant's case;\nand\niv.  Whether Defendants' failure to implement, administer, and oversee an adequate\npublic-defense system results in a violation of the state and federal constitutions.\nThese questions are capable of classwide resolution and resolving them \"will resolve an\nissue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.\" Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350.\nTo take just one example, the question of whether Defendants have failed to fulfill their statutory\nduty to promulgate rules and standards is fundamental to the issues and contentions underlying\nthis suit. That question will be resolved independent of the facts of any particular case, and it has\na single answer that will apply equally to all members of the class.\nApplying these principles, courts in analogous cases around the country have granted class\ncertification to plaintiffs challenging a state or locality's indigent-defense system. See, e.g., Order\nGranting Motion for Class Certification, Tucker v. Idaho, No. CV-OC-2015-10240( Idaho 4th Dist.\nJan. 17, 2018), available at https://bit.ly/3st7Czo and attached as Exhibit B; Wilbur v. City of\n7\n\nMount Vernon, 298 F.R.D. 665 (W.D. Wash. 2012); Hurrell-Harring v. State, 914 N.Y.S.2d 367\n(2011); Rivera v. Rowland, No. CV-95545629, 1996 WL 677452( Conn. Super. Ct. Nov. 8, 1996).\nIn Tucker, for example, plaintiffs sought certification of a class containing all persons in Idaho\neligible to use the services of the state public defender. Order Granting Motion for Class\nCertification at 2, Tucker, CV-0C-2015-10240. Like Plaintiffs here, the Tucker plaintiffs sought\na judgment that Idaho's indigent-defense system was constitutionally deficient and failed to\nprovide effective assistance of counsel. Id. In certifying the class, the court emphasized that the\ncase would \"examine [the defendants'] policies and practices concerning public defender services\nin the State of Idaho\"—not a \"multitudinous\" set of individualized \"decisions and answers.\" Id. at\n16.\nHere, too,\" there are single answers to questions such as whether the State has violated the\nUnited States and [state] Constitutions by failing to implement, administer, and oversee adequate\npublic defense.\" Id. at 16-171 In particular, as noted above, the question whether Defendants have\nfailed to fulfill their statutory obligations—leading to an unconstitutional risk of the deprivation\nof effective assistance of counsel—will have a single answer that applies equally to all class\nmembers.\nSimilarly, in Hurrell-Harring, plaintiffs sought certification of a class consisting of all\ncriminal defendants entitled to appointed representation in a set of New York counties. Hurrell-\nHarring, 81 A.D. 3d at 72. As in Tucker, the court emphasized that the case rested on the common\nquestion whether the localities had met \"the basic constitutional mandate for the provision of\ncounsel to indigent defendants at all critical stages.\" Id. at 73. As the court explained, \"[i]t is this\nconcrete legal issue, and the constitutional right to counsel sought to be vindicated, that is common\nto all members oft he class and transcends any individual questions.\" Id. That was true even though\n8\n\n\"the class members may have suffered the deprivation of their constitutional right to counsel in\nvarying manners.\" Id. Because \"it is predominance, not identity or unanimity, that is the linchpin\nof commonality,\" it was not \"fatal to the class action\" that individualized questions might \"remain\nafter resolution\" of the questions common to the class. Id. (quotation marks omitted).\nHere, that reasoning applies with equal force. Before addressing any particular plaintiffs'\nexperience with the State's indigent-defense system, the court must first decide whether\nDefendants have failed to fulfill their statutory obligations to create an effective indigent-defense\nsystem, thereby creating an unconstitutional risk of deprivation. The answer to that question will\napply to all individual cases, regardless of the precise details of any individual defendant's\ninteraction with the indigent-defense system.\nFinally, in Wilbur, plaintiffs sought certification of a class consisting of all persons in two\nWashington State towns who had been or would be represented by a public defender. 298 F.R.D.\nat 666. In determining that certification of the class was proper, the court identified multiple\ncommon questions, including  whether  the  relevant  public  defender  systems  provided\nconstitutionally adequate representation and whether the relevant towns were obligated to monitor\nthe public defenders. Id. at 667. The court emphasized, relying on Dukes, that these questions\ncould be resolved with a uniform answer. Id.\nThe result should be the same here. This case hinges on whether \"the basic constitutional\nmandate for the provision of counsel to indigent defendants . . . is at risk of being unmet because\nof systemic conditions.\" Hurrell-Harring, 914 N.Y.S.2d at 370. As described above, this question\nis both \"capable of classwide resolution\" and \"central\" to the claims of every putative class\nmember. Dukes, U.S. at 349-350. Defendants' actions and inactions have caused the same injury\nto Plaintiffs and class members: a substantial risk of the denial of adequate assistance of counsel.\n9\n\nAnd Plaintiffs and class members seek the same relief: a declaration that Defendants are not\nfulfilling their statutory and constitutional obligation to ensure effective representation, and an\ninjunction requiring Defendants to comply with their obligations.\nC.  Plaintiffs' claims are typical of those of the class.\nThe third element of class certification analysis is \"typicality\"—in other words, are the\n\"claims or defenses of the representative parties ... typical of the claims or defenses of the class.\"\nM.R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3). This requirement is satisfied when plaintiffs' injuries \"arise from the same\nevents or course of conduct as do the injuries of the class and when plaintiff's claims and those of\nthe class are based on the same legal theory.\" Applegate, 2012 WL 3065542 at *6 (quoting\nCampbell, 269 F.R.D. at 75). The commonality and typicality analyses often overlap. See, e.g., 1\nNewberg on Class Actions § 3:31 (5th ed. 2021).\nHere, Plaintiffs' claims are representative of the class members' claims because Plaintiffs,\nlike the other class members, receive representation through the State's deficient indigent-defense\nsystem. MCILS has failed to promulgate any standards for evaluating caseloads, conflicts of\ninterest, or attorneys' performance. In addition to violating the Commission's statutory\nobligations, MCILS's lax approach creates an unconstitutional risk that indigent defendants will\nbe assigned an attorney who is ill-prepared and incapable of providing effective representation.\nSee Complaint ¶¶ 76-80. Absent the required standards, MCILS has no baseline for establishing\nwhat effective representation requires—let alone mechanisms for measuring how appointed\ncounsel are performing. And even where MCILS has ostensibly put standards in place—for\nexample, with respect to attorney qualifications and training—the standards are far too low to\nensure effective representation. Complaint TT 58-63. The result is both a statutory violation under\nthe Maine Administrative Procedure Act and a constitutional violation through the resultant risk\nof deprivation of counsel. See, e.g., Luckey v. Harris, 860 F.2d 1012,1017-1018 (11th Cir. 1988);\n10\n\nHurrell-Harring v. State, 15 N.Y.3d 8, 18 (2010); Kuren v. Luzerne County, 637 Pa. 33, 38, 146\nA.3d 715, 718 (2016); Tucker v. State, 162 Idaho 1 I,  20, 394 P.3d 54, 63 (2017). Crucially, that\nrisk exists for both the named Plaintiffs and the absent class members alike.\nD.  Plaintiffs and their counsel will fairly and adequately protect the interests of\nthe class.\nThe fourth requirement for class certification is that the named plaintiffs and their counsel\nestablish that they will \"fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\" M.R. Civ. P.\n23(a)(4). Plaintiffs must show that their personal interests will not conflict with the interests of\nother class members, and counsel must show that they are \"qualified, experienced and able to\nvigorously conduct the proposed litigation.\" Van Meter, 272 F.R.D. at 283 (quoting Andrews v.\nBechel Power Corp., 780 F.2d 124 (1st Cir. 1985)).\nIn this case, the named Plaintiffs and their counsel will fairly represent and adequately\nprotect the interests of the members of the class as a whole. The named plaintiffs do not have any\ninterest antagonistic to those of other class members. By filing this action, the named plaintiffs\nhave displayed an interest in vindicating their rights, as well as the rights of others who are\nsimilarly situated. The declaratory and injunctive relief sought by the named plaintiffs will benefit\nmembers of the class generally.\nFurthermore, the named plaintiffs are represented by counsel who are skilled and\nknowledgeable about constitutional rights, civil  rights litigation, criminal procedure, the\nprosecution and management of class action litigation, and practice and procedure in Maine state\ncourts. The ACLU of Maine—an affiliate of the nationwide American Civil Liberties Union—has\nmore than five decades of experience defending the civil liberties of the people of Maine,i ncluding\nthrough state and federal civil-rights actions. Counsel at Preti, Flaherty, Beliveau & Pachios, LLP,\npossess expertise in complex litigation, administrative law, and matters relating to Maine state\n\ngovernment. And counsel at Goodwin Procter LLP have extensive experience litigating complex\nactions in trial and appellate courts, including a significant track record of litigating civil-rights\nsuits in conjunction with ACLU affiliates.\nFor these reasons, the requirements of Rule 23(a)(4) are therefore met.\nE.  Plaintiffs meet the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2).\nIn addition to satisfying the requirements of Rule 23(a), Plaintiffs must also establish that\nDefendants have \"acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby\nmaking appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the\nclass a whole.\" M.R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2); see Nilson v. York County, 219 F.R.D. 19, 21 (D. Me 2003)\n(noting that plaintiffs must satisfy one of the requirements from among the Rule 23(b) options in\naddition to all of the requirements in Rule 23(a)). Plaintiffs are not seeking an award of damages,\nwhich could necessitate individualized determinations of damages for each class member or\ncategory of class members. Cf. Nilsen, 219 F.R.D. at 23. Instead, Plaintiffs are seeking declaratory\nand injunctive relief to address Defendants' unlawful failure to adopt rules and standards and to\notherwise ensure that Plaintiffs and those similarly situated are given adequate assistance of\ncounsel. If a class is not certified, individual class members will have to bring the exact same\nclaims as the named plaintiffs in order to obtain the same relief that would be available in a class\naction. Further, due to the speed with which criminal cases are often resolved, class members\nwould need to seek preliminary injunctive relief in order to obtain review of their claims before\nthey become moot.\nDefendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class,\nthereby making final injunctive relief appropriate with respect to the class as a whole under Rule\n23(b)(2). Although class members face different criminal charges, their claims raise common legal\nissues insofar as all class members have faced, or will face, an unconstitutional risk of denial of\n12\n\nthe effective assistance of counsel at critical stages of the criminal proceeding because of the\nDefendants' failure to properly train, supervise, evaluate, or compensate the attorneys in its\nprogram. Class members share a common need for the prompt delivery of effective legal\nrepresentation in the form of criminal defense attorneys who are reasonably likely, based on the\nsystems put in place by the Defendants, to provide such assistance.\nA class action is superior to individual lawsuits for resolving this controversy because\ndetermining whether the Defendants' failure to train, evaluate, supervise, and compensate the\nlawyers in its program violates the constitution for all individuals who are entitled to legal\nassistance in a class action will conserve judicial resources. While there are hundreds of lawyers\nhandling thousands of individual cases in dozens of courts across Maine each year, each of those\nlawyers is meant to be overseen by the same named Defendants. See Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S.\n244, 267-268 (2003)( recognizing that Rule 23(b)(2) class certification saved resources for the\nparties and the courts); McCray v. Standard Oil Co., 76 F.R.D. 490, 500 (N.D. Ill. 1977)( holding\nthat Rule 23(b)(2) was \"designed to encompass classes in which the members cannot be\nspecifically enumerated, and to simplify 'across the board' demands for injunctive relief.\")\nHI.  Conclusion \nFor the reasons stated above, Plaintiffs move this Court to:\n1) Certify this case as a class action under Rule 23(a) and (b)(2) of the Maine Rules of\nCivil Procedure;\n2) Define the class as: \"All individuals who currently are or in the future will be eligible\nfor the appointment of competent defense counsel by the Superior or District Court\npursuant to 15 M.R.S. §810 because they have been indicted for a crime punishable by\nimprisomnent in the State Prison and they lack sufficient means to employ counsel;\"\n13\n\n3) Appoint Zachary L.

CIVIL ACTION\nDOCKET NO.\nANDREW ROBBINS, et al.,\nPlaintiffs,\nv.\nMAINE COMMISSION ON INDIGENT LEGAL\nSERVICES, el al.,\nDefendants.\nORDER\nPlaintiffs have filed suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief under the Maine\nAdministrative Procedures Act, 5 M.R.S. § 8058, the Maine Declaratory Judgments Act, 14\nM.R.S. § 5951, and the Civil Rights Act of 1871,4 2 U.S.C. § 1983,t o require Defendants to adopt\nand enforce rules, practices, and systems necessary to comply with their legal and constitutional\nobligations. Plaintiffs have moved this court to enter an order to certify and maintain this case as\na class action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(2) of the Maine Rules of Civil Procedure, and to\nappoint undersigned counsel as class counsel. The Court finds that Plaintiffs meet all of the\nrequirements for class certification in this case, and undersigned counsel are able to provide\ncapable representation to the class. Specifically, the Court finds that the proposed class of\n\"individuals who currently are or in the future will be eligible for the appointment of competent\ndefense counsel by the Superior or District Court pursuant to 15 M.R.S. §810\" are too numerous\nfor joinder to be practicable; that there are questions of law and fact that are common to the\nmembers of the proposed class; that the claims of the proposed class representatives are typical of\n16\n\nthose in the proposed class; and that plaintiffs and their counsel will fairly represent the interests\nof the proposed class. In addition, the Court finds that Defendants have acted or refused to act on\ngrounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making final injunctive relief appropriate with\nrespect to the class as a whole.\nTherefore, the Court ORDERS that this case is certified as a class action under Rule 23(a)\nand (b)(2) of the Maine Rules of Civil Procedure. The Plaintiff class shall be defined as,\" All\nindividuals who currently are or in the future will be eligible for the appointment of competent\ndefense counsel by the Superior or District Court pursuant to 15 M.R.S. §810 because they have\nbeen indicted for a crime punishable by imprisonment in the State Prison and they lack sufficient\nmeans to employ counsel.\" The Court appoints the following counsel to serve as class counsel:\nZachary L.

For the reasons stated herein, the Motion is GRANTED.\nOrder Granting Motion for Class Certification - I\n\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nPlaintiffs' Tracy Tucker, Jason Sharp, Naomi Morley, and Jeremy Payne (collectively,\n\"Plaintiffs\") filed the instant suit on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated\nalleging Idaho's public defense system is inadequate under state and federal constitutional\nstandards.  Plaintiffs have been represented by public defenders (or conflict counsel for the\npublic defenders) in at least eight Idaho counties, including Bonner, Boundary, Kootenai,\nShoshone, Ada, Gem, Payette, and Canyon Counties) They allege numerous instances of their\npublic defenders' inadequate representation of them in their respective cases.2 They contend that\n\"they exemplify the experiences of thousands of indigent defendants across the State, who have\nbeen denied their right to effective counsel as a result of the State's failure to provide the\nnecessary resources, robust oversight, and specialized training required to ensure that all public\ndefenders can handle all of their cases effectively and in compliance with state and federal law.\"3\nPlaintiffs now seek to certify a class of plaintiffs defined as follows:\nall indigent persons who are now or who will be under formal charge before a\nstate court in Idaho of having committed any offense, the penalty for which\nincludes the possibility of confinement, incarceration, imprisonment, or detention\nin a correction facility (regardless of whether actually imposed) and who are\nunable to provide for the full payment of an attorney and all other necessary\nexpenses of representation in defending against the charge.4\nFirst Amended Class Action Compl. for Injunctive & Declaratory Relief & Suppl. Pleading In 6-9 (filed Aug. 15,\n2017)( hereafter, \"Compl.\").\n2 Id.\n3 Id. at ¶ 10.\n4 Id. at ¶ 100.\nOrder Granting Motion for Class Certification - 2\n\n(1) Background\nIn Idaho, individual counties are tasked with the duty of administering and funding public\ndefender services. I.C. §§ 19-859, 19-862. As a result the State has 44 different systems with\ndifferent standards, resources, and varying quality of services.  About 10 years ago, the State\ncommissioned a report on Idaho's public defender services, and in 2010, the National Legal Aid\nand Defender Association (\"NLADA\")i ssued a report after studying trial level indigent services\noffered in seven Idaho counties. The report found there were no constitutionally adequate public\ndefender systems in the sample counties and identified common areas of concern, including:\nthe widespread use of fixed-fee contracts; extraordinarily high attorney caseloads\nand workloads; lack of consistent, effective, and confidential communication with\nindigent clients; inadequate, and often nonexistent, investigation of cases; lack of\nstructural safeguards to protect the independence of defenders; lack of adequate\nrepresentation of children in juvenile and criminal court; lack of sufficient\nsupervision; lack of performance-based standards; lack of ongoing training and\nprofessional development; and lack of any meaningful funding from the State.5\nIn 2014, the legislature created the Idaho Public Defense Commission (\"PDC\"). The PDC is a\nself-governing agency comprised of seven members, which includes two representatives from\nthe state legislature, one representative appointed by the chief justice of the Idaho Supreme\nCourt, and four representatives appointed by the governor. I.C. § 19-849. The PDC members'\npowers and duties have been expanded since the inception of this lawsuit, and they are tasked\nwith overseeing the delivery of public defender services in all of Idaho. The PDC is responsible\nfor promulgating statewide rules regarding: training and continuing education requirements for\npublic defenders; data reporting, including caseloads and workloads; core contract requirements;\nindigent defense grants; and indigent defense workload and performance standards, plus the\n5 Compl. ¶ 2.\nOrder Granting Motion for Class Certification - 3\n\noversight, implementation, enforcement, and modification of those standards.6 The PDC also\nhas the  authority to  adopt and enforce performance standards,7 provide counties  with\nsupplemental resources for the delivery of indigent defense services,8 and it is responsible for\nensuring that the statutory standards are met.9\nPlaintiffs contend the progress made has been inadequate:\nEach county, however, is still currently responsible for providing indigent-defense\nservices to all criminal defendants within the county who are charged with\nmisdemeanor or felony offenses and who are unable to afford an attorney. The\nfunding, oversight, and training that the State has provided since this lawsuit was\nfiled has been inadequate to remedy the systemic actual and constructive denial of\ncounsel that has continued at least since the 2010 NLADA report and the filing of\nthis lawsuit in 2015. The additional funding, oversight, and training has similarly\nfailed to prevent the systemic, actual conflict of interest that public defenders\nlabor under, because their efforts to represent one indigent client are necessarily\ncarried out at the expense of others. Even with the additional funding, oversight,\nand training, the State's public defense system continues to pose a significant risk\nthat indigent defendants will be prejudiced, that their appointed attorneys will be\nunable to  meet their professional responsibilities, and that their attorneys'\nrepresentation  of them  will  be  materially  limited  by  those  attorneys'\nresponsibilities to other clients.\nThe PDC has not fulfilled its rulemaking duties. It has not promulgated rules\nestablishing core contract requirements or uniform data reporting requirements.\nAlthough it has promulgated rules establishing some standards for defending\nattorneys, the standards are incomplete and many of them are permissive, rather\nthan mandatory, leaving them with little or no effect on the reality of public\ndefense across Idaho. Even with State funding through the PDC's Indigent\nDefense Grant program, Idaho counties are unable to meet even those standards\nthat the PDC has so far established.10\nPlaintiffs assert that the State has failed to sufficiently address the state and federal constitutional\nviolations identified in the NLADA report.  The deficiencies include (among others): public\n6 LC. § 19-850(1)(a).\n7 I.C. § 19-850(1)(a).\n81.C. § 19-862A.\n9/d.\nI° Comp1.111147-48.\nOrder Granting Motion for Class Certification - 4\n\ndefenders being absent at initial appearances, inadequate funding for public defender services,\nexcessive caseloads, and inadequate investigation into cases.\"\n(2) Named Plaintiffs\nThe four individually-named Plaintiffs allege experiences that are typical of the constitutional\ndeficiencies throughout the State of Idaho.\nPlaintiff Tracy Tucker was prosecuted in Bonner County in 2015 for attempted strangulation and\ndomestic battery in the presence of a child. Tucker was assigned a public defender, but was not\nrepresented by counsel at his initial appearance, at which time his bail was set at $40,000.\nTucker could not afford to post bail and remained in jail for the next three months. During those\nmonths in jail, Tucker's attorney had infrequent contact with him, and he met with his attorney\nonly three short times prior to pleading guilty. Tucker attempted to reach his attorney by phone\nover 50 times, and had two short phone calls with him. Tucker contends that 10 days before his\ntrial date, his attorney's demanding schedule had prevented him from conducting any meaningful\ninvestigation into Tucker's case. His attorney failed to review and explain relevant discovery\nmaterials or discuss trial strategy with him. Tucker ultimately pleaded guilty and was sentenced\nto probation. Tucker was also prosecuted in other cases in Bonner, Boundary, and Kootenai\nCounties. Tucker was not represented by counsel at initial appearances and contends that his\nother public defenders were also unable to maintain consistent contact with him.\n\" Id. at ¶¶ 49-57.\nOrder Granting Motion for Class Certification - 5\n\nPlaintiff Jason Sharp was prosecuted in Shoshone County in 2014 for burglary and grand theft.\nSharp was appointed a public defender, but was not represented by counsel at his initial\nappearance when bail was set at $50,000. During the course of proceedings, Sharp was unable to\ncommunicate effectively with his attorney regarding the status of his case.  Despite Sharp's\nrequests, his attorney failed to provide him with a copy of the discovery materials in his case for\nmonths after his arrest. Sharp was eventually granted probation; however, he was subsequently\ncharged with other felonies in Shoshone County. His public defenders again were not present at\nhis initial appearances. Sharp is currently incarcerated.\nPlaintiff Naomi Morley was prosecuted in 2014 in Ada County for driving under the influence\nand possession of a controlled substance. Morley was represented by a public defender at her\ninitial appearance, however, that attorney subsequently withdrew due to a conflict of interest and\nshe was appointed conflict counsel. Throughout the course of proceedings, Morley insisted on\nher innocence. Morley undertook significant efforts on her case while it was shuffled between\nseveral different attorneys. Morley alleges the appointed lawyers' caseloads were so large, and\ntheir resources so few, they were unable to review her extensive comments on the police reports\nor undertake any meaningful investigation. Morley was unable to communicate effectively or\nconsistently with her attorneys, and she felt pressured by them to plead guilty.  Morley turned\ndown numerous plea offers, and eventually, the State dismissed all but one charge, and she\npleaded guilty to misdemeanor possession of drug paraphernalia.\nPlaintiff Jeremy Payne was prosecuted in Gem County on an alleged probation violation and was\nunrepresented by an attorney at his initial appearance. Payne contends his public defender was\nOrder Granting Motion for Class Certification - 6\n\nso busy with his other cases that he was almost never available to take his phone calls and was\nseldom able to return those calls. His public defender met with him only briefly before his court\nappearances.  Payne has also been represented by public defenders in Payette and Canyon\nCounties. His experiences with public defense in those counties are similar: public defenders are\nso overloaded with work that they are not present at first appearances, hard to reach, and only\nable to meet with their clients briefly before court dates.\n(3) Procedural History\nOn June 17, 2015, Plaintiffs filed the instant putative class action against the State of Idaho,\nGovernor C.L. \"Butch\" Otter, and seven members of the PDC seeking declaratory and injunctive\nrelief to remedy the Defendants' failure \"to provide effective legal representation to indigent\ncriminal defendants across the State of Idaho, in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the United States Constitution, of Article  1, Section  13, of the Idaho\nConstitution, and Idaho statutes and regulations.\"1 2\nThereafter, this Court held that the claims were not justiciable and dismissed the Complaint\nbased on standing, ripeness, and separation of powers.I3 On appeal, the Idaho Supreme Court\nheld that the dismissal as to the Governor was proper, but that the suit could continue against the\nState and the individual members of the PDC.I4 The Supreme Court specifically held that this\nsuit does not implicate Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984) or necessitate \"case-by-\ncase inquiries.\" Tucker v. State, 162 Idaho 11, 394 P.3d 54, 62-63 (2017).

Id. at  394 P.3d at 69-70.\nAfter the case was remanded back to this Court, on August 15, 2017, the Plaintiffs filed a First\nAmended Class Action Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief and Supplemental\nPleading against the State of Idaho and the current seven members of the PDC in their official\ncapacities. On October 16, 2017, Defendants' the State of Idaho, the Honorable Linda Copple\nTrout, Darrel G. Bolz, Shellee Daniels, Senator Chuck Winder, and Representative Christy Perry\nfiled an Answer. Defendants' Eric Fredericksen and Paige Nolta are represented by separate\ncounsel and have not filed a separate Answer.\nThe parties subsequently submitted extensive briefing and evidence on the issue regarding class\ncertification. On December 15, 2017, a hearing was held on the Motion for Class Certification,\nthe parties presented oral argument, and the matter was taken under advisement.\nLEGAL STANDARDis\nA trial court's decision on a motion for class certification is reviewed under an abuse of\ndiscretion standard. BHA Investments, Inc. v. City of Boise, 141 Idaho 168, 171, 108 P.3d 315,\n318 (2004); Pope v. Intermountain Gas Co., 103 Idaho 217, 237, 646 P.2d 988, 1008 (1982)\n(\"Generally, the scope of review of an order denying or granting a motion to maintain a class\n15 Preliminarily, the Court notes that Idaho case law is sparse regarding class certifications. Accordingly, this Court\nhas found federal cases interpreting Rule 77 to be persuasive as IRCP 77 is substantially similar to FRCP 23. Terra-\nW., Inc. v. Idaho Mut.

Upper Valley\nTelecable Co., 96 Idaho 83, 89, 524 P.2d 1055, 1061 (1973). \"An intelligent decision on class\ncertification requires 'at least a preliminary exploration of the merits' of the plaintiff's claim.\nBased on that exploration, the court must make specific findings establishing that the case\nsatisfies the several requirements for certification.\" Pope, 103 Idaho at 237, 646 P.2d at 1008\n(citing Shelton v. Pargo, Inc., 582 F.2d 1298, 1312-13 (4th Cir. 1978)).\n\"A party seeking class certification must affirmatively demonstrate his compliance with the\nRule—that is, he must be prepared to prove that there are in fact sufficiently numerous parties,\ncommon questions of law or fact, etc.\" Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350. \"Sometimes the issues are plain\nenough from the pleadings to determine whether the interests of the absent parties are fairly\nencompassed within the named plaintiff's claim, and sometimes it may be necessary for the court\nto probe behind the pleadings before coming to rest on the certification question.\" Gen.

Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 160 (1982). \"Although we have cautioned that a court's class-\ncertification analysis must be 'rigorous' and may 'entail some overlap with the merits of the\nplaintiffs underlying claim,' Rule 23 grants courts no license to engage in free-ranging merits\nIS Although class certification may be proper upon various other grounds enumerated in Rule 77(b), Plaintiffs have\nonly asserted that certification is proper under Rule 77(b)(2).\nOrder Granting Motion for Class Certification - 10\n\ninquiries at the certification stage.

Plaintiffs contend they\nmeet all four requirements of Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 77(a) and 77(b)(2).\nDefendants contend that class certification is improper, because there is no way to establish that\nthe Plaintiffs' experiences are representative of every indigent defendant across the State of\nIdaho.  Defendants collectively19 argued that Plaintiffs have failed to show commonality,\ntypicality, adequacy, and the requirements set forth in Rule 77(b)(2).\n(1) Numerosity\nA class action may be certified only if the Court finds that \"the class is so numerous that joinder\nof all members is impracticable.\"  I.R.C.P. 77(a)(1).  \"The numerosity requirement requires\nexamination of the specific facts of each case and imposes no absolute limitations.\" Gen. Tel.\nCo. of the Nw. v. EEOC, 446 U.S. 318, 330 (1980). The Court should consider the individual\ncircumstances of the case to determine whether there are particular reasons why joinder would be\nimpracticable. BHA Investments, Inc., 141 Idaho at 172, 108 P.3d at 319 (finding that \"seventeen\n19 Defendants' Eric Frederickson and Paige Nolta are represented by separate counsel from the rest of the\nDefendants.

Plaintiffs seek to\ncertify a class of plaintiffs comprised of every single indigent criminal defendant who has\nreceived or who will receive services provided by a public defender in the State of Idaho.\nPlaintiffs provided evidence showing that public defenders handled over 55,000 felony and\nmisdemeanor cases between October 1, 2015 and September 30, 2016.20 Accordingly, the Court\nfinds that joinder of all the proposed class members would be impracticable and that Plaintiffs\nhave met the requirements of Rule 77(a)(1).\n(2) Commonality\nRule 77(a)(2) requires the Plaintiffs to show \"there are questions of law or fact common to the\nclass.\"  Commonality requires that the Plaintiffs demonstrate that the class members \"have\nsuffered the same injury\" not merely violations of \"the same provision of law.\" Falcon, 457\nU.S. at 157. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' claims \"must depend upon a common contention\" such that\n\"determination of [their] truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each\none of the claims in one stroke.\" Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350. \"What matters to class certification . .\nis not the raising of common 'questions'—even in droves—but, rather the capacity of a\nclasswide proceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.\nDissimilarities within the proposed class are what have the potential to impede the generation of\ncommon answers.\"  Id.

Whether the State is required under the United States and Idaho Constitutions,\nand under Idaho law, to provide indigent defendants with effective legal\nrepresentation, including at the time of initial appearance;\nb. Whether  the  State  is  currently  providing  constitutionally  sufficient\nrepresentation for indigent defendants in their respective jurisdictions;\nc. Whether the State has violated the United States and Idaho Constitutions by\nfailing to implement, administer, and oversee adequate public defense\nsystems;\nd. Whether, by abdicating its responsibility to adequately fund, supervise, and\nadminister indigent defense services to the  counties, the State has failed to\nensure  that  indigent  defendants  are  provided  with  effective  legal\nrepresentation, all in violation of the United States and Idaho Constitutions;\ne. Whether the State's failure to adequately fund and supervise the delivery of\nindigent defense services interferes with or impedes the provision of effective\nlegal representation to indigent defendants;\nf.  Whether the State has adequately funded public defense in Idaho, considering\nthe funding limitations of its counties;\ng. Whether the State has established statewide standards adequate to meet\nconstitutional minimums;\nh. Whether the State's system of supervising public defense in Idaho through\nelected county commissioners and a commission including elected officials\nand political appointees allows public defenders adequate independence from\nundue political and judicial pressures;\n21 Pls.'

Whether the State's system, including its funding and standards, sufficiently\nensure that public defenders are assigned as soon as feasible after clients'\narrest, detention, or request for counsel and are present and able to provide\nmeaningful assistance and representation at clients' initial appearances;\nj.  Whether the State's system, including its funding and standards, adequately\nensure that public defenders have sufficient time and space to  have\nconfidential meetings with their clients;\nk.  Whether any statewide workload and caseload standards are valid  and\nreasonable;\nI.  Whether any statewide workload and caseload standards are attainable given\navailable county and state funding;\nm. Whether existing resources for investigation, testing, and experts are adequate\nto ensure public defenders are able to promptly, routinely, and thoroughly\ninvestigate their clients' cases and challenge the prosecution's evidence;\nn. Whether the State's ban on fixed-fee contracts has actually prevented the use\nof fixed-fee contracts for public defense in Idaho;\no. Whether the State's public defense system poses a significant risk that\nindigent defendants will be prejudiced, that their appointed attorneys will be\nunable to meet their professional responsibilities, or that their attorneys'\nrepresentation  of them  will  be  materially  limited  by those attorneys'\nresponsibilities to other clients.22\nPlaintiffs rely on other cases that similarly alleged inadequate public defender services where\nclass certification was granted. See Hurrell-Harring v. State, 81 A.D.3d 69 (N.Y.S.2d 2011)( in\naction against New York state and counties, court granted class certification to class of plaintiffs\ndefined as indigent criminal defendants with charges pending in New York state courts in\nOnondaga, Ontario, Schuyler, Suffolk and Washington counties); Wilbur v. City of Mount\nVernon, 298 F.R.D. 665 (W.D. Wash. 2012) (granting class certification to indigent criminal\ndefendants in action alleging that the public defender system adopted by municipalities made it\nimpossible for appointed counsel to engage in confidential attorney-client communications or to\nfill role of advocate); Rivera v. Rowland, 1996 WL 677452 (Conn. Super. Ct. Nov. 8, 1996)\n(unreported) (granting class certification to plaintiffs in action seeking injunctive relief in\nconnection with claimed deficiencies in the legal representation being provided to various\n22 Compl. ¶ 103.\nOrder Granting Motion for Class Certification - 14\n\ncategories of indigent criminal defendants by the state's public defender system); Flournoy v.\nState, 2010 WL 9037133 (Ga. Super. 2010).\nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs have failed to show a common question of law or fact. They\ncontend that under Dukes, the dissimilarities of experiences with public defenders among the\nclass are too great to warrant certification.  Defendants contend that there is no \"monolithic\npublic defense system in Idaho,\" and as a consequence, the manner in which indigent defense\nservices are provided varies greatly throughout the State. Defendants assert that the other public\ndefender lawsuits that granted class certification are distinguishable, because they were either\nlimited to indigent persons within the counties from which the named plaintiffs were prosecuted\nor they involved a state-run public defender system, unlike Idaho's county-run system.\nDefendants also contend that CREEC v. Hospitality Property Trust supports their conclusion that\ncommonality is not met in this case.\nIn 2011, the United States Supreme Court extensively addressed the commonality requirement in\nWal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338 (2011). In that case, the plaintiffs filed a putative\nclass action, comprised of about 1.5 million female employees, against Walmart for alleged\ngender discrimination. The plaintiffs argued that the question of whether Wal-Mart's pay and\npromotion policies gave rise to unlawful discrimination was a common question. However, the\nCourt rejected that argument, holding that the plaintiffs failed to offer \"significant proof' that\nWal-Mart in fact had a companywide discriminatory pay and promotion policy.23\n23 The Court found that the evidence established that Wal-Mart had a \"policy\" of giving local supervisors discretion\nover employment matters, and while such a policy could be the basis of a Title VII disparate-impact claim,\nrecognizing that a \"claim 'can' exist does not lead to the conclusion that every employee in a company using a\nsystem of discretion has such a claim in common.\" Id. at 355.\nOrder Granting Motion for Class Certification - 15\n\nIn CREEC, three physically disabled hotel patrons filed a lawsuit against HPT, a real estate\ninvestment trust that owns hotels across the country, alleging that those hotels violated various\nrequirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found\nthat the plaintiffs could not meet the commonality requirement required for class certification:\nCREEC cannot establish a pattern of discrimination orchestrated by HPT, as it\nmust in order to establish a question of fact common to its claims against HPT.\nCREEC tried to avoid this conclusion at oral argument by insisting that HPT has a\n\"nondelegable duty\" to comply with the ADA specifically. Nondelegable duty is a\ntort concept associated with vicarious liability theories. Restatement (Third) of\nTorts: Liability for Physical and Emotional Harm § 57 cmt. b (Am. Law Inst.\n2012). Contrary to CREEC's contention, however, the concept \"does not mean\nthat an actor is  not permitted to delegate [an] activity to an independent\ncontractor.\" Id. Rather, it means that an actor \"will be vicariously liable for the\ncontractor's tortious conduct in the course of carrying out the activity.\" Id. Even if\nHPT would be vicariously liable for ADA violations by its hired contractors, we\nfail to see how this fact bears on commonality. It would only create a common\nissue as to where the financial burden of liability would fall, not one regarding the\nquestion of that liability. While the latter issue is \"central to the validity\" of\nCREEC's claims, Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350, 131 S.Ct. 2541, the former is not.\nCivil Rights Educ. & Enf't Ctr. v. Hosp. Properties Tr., 867 F.3d 1093, 1105 (9th Cir. 2017).\nThe facts in Dukes and CREEC are distinguishable from the facts in this case. Neither case\nalleged constitutional violations on a state-wide basis as this case does. Dukes involved a grant\nof discretion among thousands of managers, whereas this case concerns the State and the PDC's\nresponsibility to provide effective assistance of counsel to indigent criminal defendants in Idaho.\nThis case involves about 50,000 indigent criminal defendants, whereas, the Dukes case involved\nmillions of employees all over the country. This case will examine the State and the PDC's\npolicies and practices concerning public defender services in the State of Idaho, which is\ndissimilar from the multitudinous decisions and answers concerning why an employee might\nhave been disfavored in seeking a promotion in Dukes.  Here, there are single answers to\nOrder Granting Motion for Class Certification - 16\n\nquestions such as whether the State has violated the United States and Idaho Constitutions by\nfailing to implement, administer, and oversee adequate public defense in Idaho.\nInstead, Parsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657 (9th Cir. 2014) is more akin to this case. In Parsons, 13\nArizona state inmates and Arizona's authorized protection and advocacy agency, filed a putative\nclass action for declaratory and injunctive relief against senior officials from the Arizona\nDepartment of Corrections, asserting Eighth Amendment claims, based on alleged systemic\ndeficiencies in the conditions of confinement in isolation cells, and in the provision of privatized\nmedical, dental, and mental health care services in Arizona.  The district court granted class\ncertification.  On an interlocutory appeal, the defendants advanced a similar argument to the\nDefendants' contention in this case that the commonality requirement is not met:\n\"Eighth  Amendment healthcare  and  conditions-of-confinement  claims  are\ninherently case specific and turn on many individual inquiries. That fact is an\ninsurmountable hurdle for a commonality finding because Wal—Mart instructs that\ndissimilarities  between class members 'impede the generation of common\nanswers.' \" In other words—also from the defendants—the plaintiffs fail Rule\n23(a)(2)'s commonality test because \"a systemic constitutional violation [of the\nsort alleged here] is a collection of individual constitutional violations,\" each of\nwhich hinges on \"the particular facts and circumstances of each case.\"\nId. at 675 (citations omitted). The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals noted that the defendants\nmischaracterized the plaintiffs' claims as the case sought systemic reform:\nHere, the defendants describe the plaintiffs' claims as little  more than an\naggregation  of many claims of individual  mistreatment. That description,\nhowever, rests upon a misunderstanding of the plaintiffs' allegations. The\nComplaint does not allege that the care provided on any particular occasion to any\nparticular inmate (or group of inmates) was insufficient, see, e.g., Estelle v.\nGamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104-05, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976), but rather\nthat ADC policies and practices of statewide and systemic application expose all\ninmates in ADC custody to a substantial risk of serious harm.\nOrder Granting Motion for Class Certification - 17\n\nHere, a proper understanding of the nature of the plaintiffs' claims clarifies the\nissue of commonality. What all members of the putative class and subclass have\nin common is their alleged exposure, as a result of specified statewide ADC\npolicies and practices that govern the overall conditions of health care services\nand confinement, to a substantial risk of serious future harm to which the\ndefendants are allegedly deliberately indifferent. As the district court recognized,\nalthough a presently existing risk may ultimately result in different future harm\nfor different inmates—ranging from no harm at all to death—every inmate suffers\nexactly the same constitutional injury when he is exposed to a single statewide\nADC policy or practice that creates a substantial risk of serious harm. See, e.g.,\nFarmer, 511 U.S. at 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970; Helling, 509 U.S. at 33, 113 S.Ct. 2475;\ncf. Plata, 131 S.Ct. at 1923 (\"For years the medical and mental health care\nprovided by California's prisons has fallen short of minimum constitutional\nrequirements and has failed to meet prisoners' basic health needs. Needless\nsuffering and death have been the well-documented result.\").\nThe putative class and subclass members thus all set forth numerous common\ncontentions whose truth or falsity can be determined in one stroke: whether the\nspecified statewide policies and practices to which they are all subjected by ADC\nexpose them to a substantial risk of harm. See Dukes, 131 S.Ct. at 2551. The\ndistrict court identified 10 statewide ADC policies and practices to which all\nmembers of the class are subjected, and seven statewide ADC policies and\npractices which affect all members of the subclass. These policies and practices\nare the \"glue\" that holds together the putative class and the putative subclass;\neither each of the policies and practices is unlawful as to every inmate or it is not.\nThat inquiry does not require us to determine the effect of those policies and\npractices upon any individual class member (or class members) or to undertake\nany other kind of individualized determination.\nId. at 676-78 (9th Cir. 2014)( citation omitted).\nSimilar to Parsons, the law of this case is well established that this case does not necessitate\n\"case-by-case inquiries\"24:\nThe issues raised in this case do not implicate Strickland. Appellants alleged\nsystemic, statewide  deficiencies  plaguing  Idaho's  public  defense  system.\nAppellants seek to vindicate their fundamental right to constitutionally adequate\npublic defense at the State's expense, as required under the Sixth Amendment to\nthe U.S. Constitution, and Article I, Section 13 of the Idaho Constitution. They\nhave not asked for any relief in their individual criminal cases. Rather, they seek\nto effect systemic reform. Their allegations find support in both Gideon v.\n24 \"[T]he district court erred by attempting to undertake case-by-case inquiries into Appellants' individual criminal\ncases.\" Tucker, 162 Idaho 11, 394 P.3d at 62 .\nOrder Granting Motion for Class Certification - 18\n\nWainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 342, 83 S.Ct. 792, 795, 9 L.Ed.2d 799, 803-04 (1963),\nand State v. Montroy, 37 Idaho 684, 690, 217 P. 611, 614 (1923), which make\nclear that it is the State's obligation to provide constitutionally adequate public\ndefense at critical stages of the prosecution. Alleging systemic inadequacies in a\npublic defense system results in actual or constructive denials of counsel at\ncritical stages of the prosecution suffices to show an injury in fact to establish\nstanding in a suit for deprivation of constitutional rights. Cf. Luckey v. Harris, 860\nF.2d 1012, 1016-17 (11th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 495 U.S. 957, 110 S.Ct. 2562,\n109 L.Ed.2d 744 (1990).\nTucker v. State, 162 Idaho 11, 394 P.3d 54, 62-63 (2017).\nAs set forth in the Supreme Court's decision in Tucker v. State, the Plaintiffs have adequately\npled \"actual and constructive denials of counsel at critical stages of the prosecution.\" Id. at\n394 P.3d at 63. The Court also found that the injuries alleged were fairly traceable to the State:\nConcerning the State, Appellants satisfy the causation standard. The right to\ncounsel is \"made obligatory upon the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\nGideon, 372 U.S. at 342, 83 S.Ct. at 795, 9 L.Ed.2d at 803-04 (emphasis added);\nsee also Montroy, 37 Idaho at 690, 217 P. at 614. The State, therefore, has\nultimate  responsibility  to  ensure  that  the  public  defense  system  passes\nconstitutional muster. While the provision of public defense has been delegated to\nIdaho's forty-four counties under Idaho Code section 19-859, \"the ultimate\nresponsibility for fulfilling the . . . constitutional duty cannot be delegated.\" See\nOsmunson v. State, 135 Idaho 292, 296, 17 P.3d 236, 240 (2000)( explaining that\nthe Legislature could delegate provision of public education to school districts,\nalthough  it  could  not  delegate  the  ultimate  responsibility  of fulfilling\nconstitutional duties). Moreover, it cannot be said that the counties are third\nparties acting independently of the State with respect to public defense. Instead,\nthe counties are political subdivisions of the State. See, e.g., Idaho Const. art.\nXVIII, § 1; State v. Peterson, 61 Idaho 50, 54, 97 P.2d 603, 605 (1939). Because\nAppellants' alleged injuries are fairly traceable to the State, we hold that\ncausation as to the State is met.\nId. at  , 394 P.3d at 64. Moreover, the Supreme Court has already found that both the State\nand the PDC can redress the harms alleged by the Plaintiffs in the Complaint:\nWere the requested relief ordered, the State would be obligated to create a plan to\nensure public defense is constitutionally adequate. That plan would cover training\nstandards and workload limits, which, as discussed, stand at the root of many of\nthe injuries alleged. Entities tasked with providing and overseeing public defense\nOrder Granting Motion for Class Certification - 19\n\nwould be bound by the State's plan. Because Appellants' requested relief, if\nordered against the State, would create a substantial likelihood of redressing\nAppellants' injuries, redressability as to the State is satisfied.\nOrdering Appellants' requested relief against the PDC would create a substantial\nlikelihood of remedying the injuries alleged. That is especially true in light of the\n2016 amendments, as the PDC can promulgate rules to ensure public defense is\nconstitutionally adequate and, moreover, can intervene at the county level. Yet,\neven analyzing redressability  under the PDC's former powers shows that\nredressability is established. The 2016 amendments do not alter the PDC's duty to\npromulgate rules governing (1)t raining requirements for public defenders; and (2)\ncaseload  and  workload  reporting  requirements. I.C. § 19-850(1)(a)(i)-(ii).\nAppellants allege their injuries are caused, in part, by the PDC's failure to\npromulgate these rules. Were the PDC to exercise these powers, it would create a\nsubstantial likelihood of remedying the injuries alleged. As such, redressability is\nsatisfied as to the PDC.\nId. at  394 P.3d at 68-69.\nHere, the putative class of plaintiffs set forth numerous contentions whose truth or falsity can be\ndetermined in one stroke, including (among others), whether the State is currently providing\nconstitutionally sufficient representation for indigent defendants in their respective jurisdictions;\nwhether the State has violated the United States and Idaho Constitutions by failing to implement,\nadminister, and  oversee  adequate  public  defense  systems; whether, by abdicating  its\nresponsibility to adequately fund, supervise, and administer indigent defense services to the\ncounties, the State has failed to ensure that indigent defendants are provided with effective legal\nrepresentation, all in violation of the United States and Idaho Constitutions.  Accordingly, the\nCourt finds that the Plaintiffs have established commonality.\nOrder Granting Motion for Class Certification - 20\n\n(3) Typicality\nTypicality is met if the class members' claims are \"fairly encompassed by the named plaintiffs'\nclaims.\" In re Whirlpool Corp. Front-Loading Washer Prod. Liab. Litig., 722 F.3d 838, 852-53\n(6th Cir. 2013)( citation omitted). \"Under the rule's permissive standards, representative claims\nare 'typical' if they are reasonably coextensive with those of absent class members; they need\nnot be substantially identical.\"  Parsons at 685 (citation omitted).  The test of typicality is\n\"whether other members have the same or similar injury, whether the action is based on conduct\nwhich is not unique to the named plaintiffs, and whether other class members have been injured\nby the same course of conduct. Thus, typicality refers to the nature of the claim or defense of the\nclass representative, and not to the specific facts from which it arose or the relief sought.\" Id.\nCommonality and typicality \"tend to merge\" in practice because both of them \"serve as\nguideposts for determining whether under the particular circumstances maintenance of a class\naction is economical and whether the named plaintiff's claim and the class claims are so\ninterrelated that the interests of the class members will be fairly and adequately protected in their\nabsence.\" Dukes, 564 U.S. at 349 n. 5. In addition, commonality and typicality \"also tend to\nmerge with the adequacy-of-representation requirement, although the latter requirement also\nraises concerns about the competency of class counsel and conflicts of interest.\" Id.\nHere, the named Plaintiffs were all indigent criminal defendants who were prosecuted in\ndifferent counties within the State of Idaho. As the Supreme Court already stated in this case:\nAppellants are not the only ones who could bring this lawsuit. In fact, the\ncomplaint  alleges  \"the  circumstances  surrounding  the  named  Plaintiffs'\nOrder Granting Motion for Class Certification - 21\n\nrepresentations are not unique to them. Rather, they exemplify the experiences of\nthousands of indigent defendants across the State....\" Because any one of those\n\"thousands of indigent defendants\" could bring this lawsuit, Appellants do not\nsatisfy the relaxed standing analysis.\nTucker at  , 394 P.3d at 69-70. In Parsons, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that the\ninmates met the typicality requirement:\nThe named plaintiffs thus allege \"the same or [a] similar injury\" as the rest of the\nputative class; they allege that this injury is a result of a course of conduct that is\nnot unique to any of them; and they allege that the injury follows from the course\nof conduct at the center of the class claims. See id. Further, given that every\ninmate in ADC custody is highly likely to require medical, mental health, and\ndental care, each of the named plaintiffs is similarly positioned to all other ADC\ninmates with respect to a substantial risk of serious harm resulting from exposure\nto the defendants' policies and practices governing health care. Cf. Hanlon, 150\nF.3d at 1020 (holding that \"the broad composition of the representative parties\"\ncan \"vitiate[ ] any challenge founded on atypicality\"). It does not matter that the\nnamed plaintiffs may have in the past suffered varying injuries or that they may\ncurrently have different health care needs; Rule 23(a)(3) requires only that their\nclaims be \"typical\" of the class, not that they be identically positioned to each\nother or to every class member. See Ellis, 657 F.3d at 985 n. 9 (\"Differing factual\nscenarios resulting in a claim of the same nature as other class members does not\ndefeat typicality.\"). Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not abuse\nits discretion in determining that the plaintiffs have satisfied the typicality\nrequirement of Rule 23(a).\nParsons at 685-86. Similar to this case, Plaintiffs alleged:\nSadly, the circumstances surrounding the named Plaintiffs' representations are not\nunique to them. Rather, they exemplify the experiences of thousands of indigent\ndefendants across the State, who have been denied their right to effective counsel\nas a result of the State's failure to provide the necessary resources, robust\noversight, and specialized training required to ensure that all public defenders can\nhandle all of their cases effectively and in compliance with state and federal law.\nThe NLADA found that, for thousands of defendants  across Idaho, the\nconstitutional requirements of Gideon and its progeny have been left unfulfilled,\nand the standards set forth in the ABA's Ten Principles have gone largely\nunmet.25\n25 Compl.9   10, 36.\nOrder Granting Motion for Class Certification - 22\n\nPlaintiffs have made a sufficient showing that their individual experiences with their public\ndefenders are typical of experiences faced by other indigent criminal defendants across the State\nof Idaho, including lack of representation at initial appearances, lack of time or space for\nmeaningful communications with their public defender(s), and having public defenders with\noverwhelming caseloads. After review of the substantial evidence before the Court, the Court\nfinds that Plaintiffs claims are typical of other class members, and thus, they meet the typicality\nrequirement.\n(4) Adequacy\nRule 77(a)(4) requires Plaintiffs show that the representative parties will fairly and adequately\nprotect the interests of the class. \"Resolution of two questions determines legal adequacy:( 1) do\nthe named plaintiffs and their counsel have any conflicts of interest with other class members\nand (2) will the named plaintiffs and their counsel prosecute the action vigorously on behalf of\nthe class?\" Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1020 (9th Cir.1998).\nPlaintiffs provided Affidavits from class counsel certifying that they do not have conflicts of\ninterest with other class members and also certifying their experience in litigating class action\nlawsuits. Defendants do not contest Plaintiffs' counsels' adequacy, but rather the adequacy of\nthe individually-named Plaintiffs, specifically with respect to their credibility. They contend the\nPlaintiffs are dishonest in that they all made misrepresentations to the Court that they were\nsatisfied with their public defender and they were all convicted of crimes involving dishonesty.\nOrder Granting Motion for Class Certification - 23\n\nDefendants' arguments do not address the two questions set forth above, i.e. whether the named\nPlaintiffs and their attorneys have any conflict of interest with other class members and whether\nthey will vigorously prosecute the action on behalf of the class.  The Court does not find\nDefendants' arguments regarding the individually-named Plaintiffs' credibility to be persuasive.\nAs set forth previously, this case does not concern case-by-case inquiries. The main inquiry of\nthis case is regarding state-wide policies (or lack thereof) in providing public defender services.\nDefendants' arguments do not indicate that the named Plaintiffs have any conflict of interest with\nclass members, nor do they indicate that the named Plaintiffs will not vigorously litigate the case.\nAccordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently met the adequacy requirement.\n(5) Rule 77(b)(2)\nRule 77(b)(2) allows class treatment when \"the party opposing the class has acted or refused to\nact on grounds generally applicable to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding\ndeclaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.\"\nThe key to the (b)(2) class is \"the indivisible nature of the injunctive or\ndeclaratory remedy warranted—the notion that the conduct is such that it can be\nenjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class members or as to none of\nthem.\" In other words, Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a single injunction or\ndeclaratory judgment would provide relief to each member of the class. It does\nnot authorize class certification when each individual class member would be\nentitled to a different injunction or declaratory judgment against the defendant.\nSimilarly, it does not authorize class certification when each class member would\nbe entitled to an individualized award of monetary damages.\nDukes, 564 U.S. at 360-62.\nOrder Granting Motion for Class Certification - 24\n\nAs the Supreme Court summarized, the Complaint's prayer for relief in this case \"can be\nsimplified into a request for two main remedies: (1) a declaratory judgment that Idaho's public\ndefense system is unconstitutional; and (2) an injunction requiring [Defendants] to fix it.\"\nTucker at  394 P.3d at 71. The Supreme Court has already recognized that injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief would be appropriate with respect to the Plaintiffs' allegations: \"Were the\nrequested relief ordered, the State would be obligated to create a plan to ensure public defense is\nconstitutionally adequate. . . . Ordering Appellants' requested relief against the PDC would\ncreate a substantial likelihood of remedying the injuries alleged.\" Id. at  394 P.3d at 68-69.\nDefendants assert that a \"one size fits all\" remedy will not work, because there are over 40\ndifferent public defender systems throughout the State of Idaho. This argument has already been\naddressed by the Supreme Court and has been rejected, at least at the initial pleading stage.\nAlthough the Court is directed to make a \"rigorous\" analysis on a class certification motion, the\nCourt does not have \"license to engage in free-ranging merits inquiries at the certification stage.\nMerits questions may be considered to the extent—but only to the extent—that they are relevant\nto determining whether the Rule 23 prerequisites for class certification are satisfied.\" Amgen\nInc. v. Connecticut Ret. Plans & Tr. Funds, 568 U.S. 455, 465-66 (2013) (citations omitted).\nAfter conducting a rigorous analysis of the claims, evidence, and argument, the Court finds that\nPlaintiffs have met their burden for class certification under Rule 77(b)(2).\nOrder Granting Motion for Class Certification - 25\n\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons contained herein, Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification is GRANTED. The\nCourt HEREBY ORDERS and CERTIFIES a class of Plaintiffs defined as follows:\nall indigent persons who are now or who will be under formal charge before a\nstate court in Idaho of having committed any offense, the penalty for which\nincludes the possibility of confinement, incarceration, imprisonment, or detention\nin a correction facility (regardless of whether actually imposed) and who are\nunable to provide for the full payment of an attorney and all other necessary\nexpenses of representation in defending against the charge.\nIT IS SO ORDERED dated Sped:1/17/201El 03:34 PM\nSAMUE A.

The right to assistance of counsel in criminal proceedings is a bedrock of our\ncriminal justice system. Guaranteed by both the Sixth Amendment of the United States\nConstitution and Article 1, Section 6 of the Maine Constitution, the right ensures that the state\n\nwill provide counsel to indigent defendants facing the possibility of imprisonment. See Gideon v.\nWainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 344-345 (1963);_State v. Cook, 1998 ME 40, ¶ 6, 706 A.2d 603. In\nthe half-century since Gideon, the United States Supreme Court has expanded that obligation in\nsignificant  ways, requiring the states to  provide counsel to indigent defendants facing\nincarceration, including for misdemeanors, and extending protections to juveniles in delinquency\nproceedings. But the animating principle has remained the same: it is the state's responsibility to\nensure that \"any person haled into court, who is too poor to hire a lawyer,\" is provided with an\nadequate legal defense. Gideon, 372 U.S. at 344.\n2.  The right to counsel means more than just the appointment of an attorney for trial.\nThe government must provide effective counsel to indigent defendants under circumstances that\nallow for competent and meaningful representation. See United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648,\n659-60 (1984). Moreover, the right to assistance of counsel attaches well before trial begins,\nbecause \"certain pretrial events may so prejudice the outcome of the defendant's prosecution\nthat, as a practical matter, the defendant must be represented at those events in order to enjoy\ngenuinely effective assistance at trial.\" Rothgery v. Gillespie Cry., 554 U.S. 191, 217 (2008)( Alito,\nJ., concurring).\n3.  This lawsuit challenges the failure of the Maine Commission on Indigent Legal\nServices (\"MCILS\" or \"the Commission\") to adequately supervise, administer, and fund an\nindigent defense system, in violation of state statute and the state and federal constitutions. While\nthere are many skilled and committed defense attorneys in Maine, MCILS has failed in its\nconstitutional and statutory obligation to supervise, administer, and fund a system that provides\neffective representation to indigent defendants throughout the entire criminal legal process.\n2\n\n4.  Indigent defense is the responsibility of MCILS. By law, MCILS is responsible\nfor \"[d]evelop[ing] and maintain[ing] a system that uses appointed private attorneys ... to\nprovide quality and efficient indigent legal services.\" 4 M.R.S. § 1804(3)(A). Maine is unique in\nthe country as the only state where appointed private attorneys provide all indigent defense.\n5.  To carry out its mandate, MCILS must, among other duties, \"develop standards\ngoverning the delivery of indigent legal services,\" 4 M.R.S. § 1804(2); \"[e]stablish minimum\nqualifications  to  ensure that  attorneys  are  qualified  and  capable  of providing  quality\nrepresentation in the  case types to  which they are assigned, recognizing that  quality\nrepresentation in each of these types of cases requires counsel with experience and specialized\ntraining in that field,\" id. § 1804(3)(E); \"[e]stablish rates of compensation for assigned counsel,\"\nid. § 1804(3)(F); and \"[e]stablish a method for accurately tracking and monitoring case loads of\nassigned counsel and contract Counsel,\" id. § 1803(G).\n6.  The statutory scheme likewise sets forth specific responsibilities for the Executive\nDirector of the Commission. See 4 M.R.S. § 1805. In particular, the Executive Director must\n\"[e]nsure that the provision of indigent legal services complies with all constitutional, statutory\nand ethical standards,\" id. § 1805(1); provide \"regular\" training, id. § 1805(5); and \"[a]dminister\nand coordinate delivery of indigent legal services and supervise compliance with commission\nstandards\" id. § 1805(3).\n7.  MCILS and its Executive Director have failed to fulfill their statutory duties—\nresulting in a system that routinely and systematically denies indigent criminal defendants their\nconstitutional right to representation. Specifically, MCILS and its Executive Director have not\nfulfilled their statutory obligations to promulgate and enforce standards; to monitor and evaluate\nthe performance of rostered attorneys; or to adequately train and compensate rostered attorneys\n3\n\nas necessary to maintain a system of effective representation for indigent clients. These failings\nnot only subvert the Legislature's command in sections 1804 and 1805, they also create an\nunconstitutional risk that indigent criminal defendants will be denied their right to counsel.\n8.  Furthermore, MCILS employs a \"lawyer of the day\" program to provide\nrepresentation at the 48-hour hearing for in-custody defendants and at the initial appearance for\nout-of-custody defendants. At these hearings, defendants are required to enter an initial plea. In-\ncustody defendants are also given the opportunity to advocate for release from custody, including\nthe granting of bail and the nature and extent of any conditions of release. There is nothing per se\nunconstitutional about a lawyer-of-the-day program, but as implemented by MCILS the program\nis under-resourced to the point of constitutional deficiency. On any given day, as few as two\nlawyers may be on hand to meet with over eighty defendants. This regime violates the Sixth\nAmendment because it does not come close to providing an adequate number of lawyers to even\nmeet with—let alone provide competent representation to—defendants in need of counsel\nconcerning the implications of potential pleas or advocacy on bail and conditions of release.\n9.  The system for providing indigent legal defense in Maine is broken. Dozens of\nattorneys have stopped accepting cases from the MCILS roster, and the crisis is set to worsen\nwith the anticipated spike in trials as courts begin the process of working through the enormous\nbacklog of cases the pandemic has created. The shortage of qualified and Fostered defense\nattorneys is particularly acute in rural areas, forcing judges and MCILS to appoint attorneys from\nother counties despite the significant travel this requires.\n10.  Plaintiffs are five indigent defendants currently being represented in criminal\nproceedings by appointed counsel. They sue on their own behalf, and on behalf of all similarly\nsituated individuals, to vindicate indigent defendants' right to adequate legal representation that\n4\n\nis enshrined in the Maine and United States constitutions. More specifically, plaintiffs seek a\njudgment under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 that the deficiencies in the MCILS system create an\nunconstitutional risk that indigent criminal defendants will be denied the benefit of effective\nassistance of counsel at critical stages of their cases in violation of the Sixth Amendment of the\nUnited States Constitution and Article I, § 6 of the Maine Constitution. Plaintiffs also seek a\njudgment that the Commission's specific failure to promulgate statutorily required standards\nviolates the Maine Administrative Procedure Act, 5 M.R.S. § 11001, and Article I, § 6 of the\nMaine Constitution. Plaintiffs respectfully request appropriate declaratory and injunctive relief.\nTHE PARTIES\n11.  Plaintiff Andrew Robbins is a Maine resident who is currently incarcerated at\nCumberland County Jail awaiting trial following an arrest in the summer of 2021 on weapons\ncharges. He was initially released on bail, but he has been in custody since a subsequent October\n30, 2021, arrest for violating his conditions of release and violating a protective order, as well as\nmisdemeanor drug possession. At his initial appearance, Mr. Robbins was represented by a\n\"lawyer of the day,\" but was subsequently assigned to another lawyer. Since that point, Mr.\nRobbins has met his attorney only once, in the summer of 2021 while he was released, for an\napproximately 30-second conversation at his door. Mr. Robbins has never had a follow-up visit\nfrom his lawyer, nor has his lawyer ever arranged a video call, communicated with him about a\nplea offer, or reviewed his discovery materials with him. When Mr. Robbins received a copy of\nhis discovery material, he observed that it contained materials relating to another defendant, but\nas far as Mr. Robbins knows his attorney never took any action based on this mistake. And while\nMr. Robbins has two young daughters, who his wife is attempting to care for alone (while\n5\n\nworking full time), his attorney has refused to ask for a bail hearing following his October 30,\n2021, arrest.\n12.  Plaintiff Brandy Grover is a Maine resident currently incarcerated in Somerset\nCounty Jail awaiting sentencing following a July 9, 2021, arrest for aggravated trafficking. Ms.\nGrover developed a substance-abuse disorder after being prescribed opioids following an injury\nin her job as a certified nursing assistant. She is currently in recovery, but she briefly relapsed\nfollowing the deaths of three people close to her. After her arrest, Ms. Grover was assigned a\nlawyer through the \"lawyer of the day\" system, who did not advocate for her release, creating the\nimpression for Ms. Grover that the lawyer believed she was better off in jail. Ms. Grover\nbelieves that her lawyer was annoyed and angry at her for not taking a plea deal. Ms. Grover has\notherwise been unable to get in touch with her lawyer, who does not take her calls or the calls of\nfamily members, leaving Ms. Grover to resort to writing letters; however, she has also not yet\nreceived any responses, either by phone or by letter, to her letters. Ms. Grover eventually pled to\nClass B trafficking and awaits sentencing, but she is concerned that her attorney will not\nadequately advocate on her behalf at her sentencing. Her attorney has never advanced any\nmitigating circumstances, such as Ms. Grover's family status or her disability.\n13.  Plaintiff Ray Mack is a Maine resident currently incarcerated in Kennebec County\nJail awaiting trial following his May 27, 2021, arrest on charges of possession of a firearm and\nthreat with a dangerous weapon. Mr. Mack pled not guilty at his initial appearance, but he did\nnot feel that he had sufficient information about the proceedings to understand what was\nhappening. Mr. Mack describes his initial appearance as \"entirely one-sided.\" His lawyer spoke\nwith the court, but not with Mr. Mack, and Mr. Mack was not able to participate in the\nproceedings. Since that point, Mr. Mack has had only minimal contact with his attorney.\n6\n\nAlthough Mr. Mack is currently set to go to trial in March, his attorney has never taken the time\nto go through his discovery with him or discuss the trial in any detail.\n14.  Plaintiff Malcolm Peirce is a Maine resident who is currently incarcerated at the\nPiscataquis County Jail awaiting trial following his December 12, 2019, arrest on several drug-\nrelated charges, as well as a charge of escape. Mr. Peirce was represented by a \"lawyer of the\nday\" attorney during his initial appearance. His first assigned attorney had to withdraw from the\nrepresentation due to a conflict of interest, and Mr. Peirce has had minimal contact—a handful of\nconversations each lasting only a few minutes—with his current state-appointed attorney. Their\nlast phone call left Mr. Peirce with the impression that his attorney did not want Mr. Peirce to\ncontact him, and Mr. Peirce has not heard from his attorney since. Mr. Peirce's attorney has\nlikewise not responded to a request to provide copies of discovery, and Mr. Peirce believes his\nattorney has not reviewed his discovery.\n15.  Plaintiff Lanh Danh Huynh is a Maine resident who is currently incarcerated at\nCumberland County Jail awaiting trial following a June 1, 2021, arrest for possession of a\nfirearm and bail violations. Mr. Huynh pled not guilty, but he did not feel that he had sufficient\ninformation about the charges against him to decide how to plead. Despite having been charged\nover eight months ago, he has had minimal contact with his state-appointed attorney.. He has yet\nto see or review any of the discovery materials in his case and has had significant difficulty\ncontacting his attorney, who does not return his calls. When Mr. Huynh tried calling his lawyer's\noffice, he was told his lawyer was in court or busy, but his lawyer never called back. He has\nlikewise tried having his brother and friends call this lawyer's office to set up a meeting or call,\nbut to no avail. His attorney has otherwise had no engagement with his case; he has not filed any\nmotions on his behalf, including any motions for Mr. Huynh to be released on bail, and Mr.\n7\n\nHuynh does not know when his next court date is. His family has been attempting to put together\nenough money for him to hire a lawyer in an effort to find someone who would take a more\nactive role in his case.\n16.  Defendant MCILS is statutorily  directed to \"provide efficient, high-quality\nrepresentation to indigent criminal defendants, juvenile defendants and children and parents in\nchild protective cases, consistent with federal and state constitutional and statutory obligations\";\n\"ensure the delivery of indigent legal services by qualified and competent counsel in a manner\nthat is fair and consistent throughout the State\"; and \"ensure adequate funding of a statewide\nsystem of indigent legal services, which must be provided and managed in a fiscally responsible\nmanner, free from undue political interference and conflicts of interest.\" 4 M.R.S. § 1801.\n17.  Defendant Justin Andrus is the Executive Director of MCILS. He is required by\nstatute to \"[e]nsure that the provision of indigent legal services complies with all constitutional,\nstatutory, and ethical standards,\" 4 M.R.S. § 1805(1), and to \"[a]dminister and coordinate\ndelivery of indigent legal services and supervise compliance with commission standards,\" id.\n§ 1805(3).\n18.  Defendant Joshua  Tardy  is  a  MCILS Commissioner and  Chair  of the\nCommission.\n19.  Defendant Donald Alexander is a MCILS Commissioner.\n20.  Defendant Meegan Burbank is a MCILS Commissioner.\n21.  Defendant Michael Carey is a MCILS Commissioner.\n22.  Defendant Robert Cummins is a MCILS Commissioner.\n23.  Defendant Roger Katz is a MCILS Commissioner.\n24.  Defendant.M atthew Morgan is a MCILS Commissioner\n8\n\n25.  Defendant Ronald Schneider is a MCILS Commissioner.\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE\n26.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 4 M.R.S. § 105, 5 M.R.S.\n§ 8058, 14 M.R.S. §§ 5951-5963, and 14 M.R.S. § 6051(13).\n27.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over the defendants pursuant to 14 M.R.S.\n§ 704-A(2).\n28.  Venue is proper in Kennebec County pursuant to 14 M.R.S. § 501.\nBACKGROUND\nI.  The Right to Counsel.\n29.  The Sixth Amendment guarantees that \"in all criminal prosecutions, the accused\nshall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defense.\" U.S. Const. amend.\nVI.\n30.  In the landmark decision Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 355, 345-46 (1963), the\nSupreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment requires states to provide counsel to indigent\ncriminal defendants. Gideon's guarantee applies in any case that could result in imprisonment.\nSee Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U.S. 25, 40 (1972) (accused must receive counsel when case\ncould result \"in the actual deprivation of a person's liberty\").1\n31.  The right to counsel is not fulfilled by the mere appointment of counsel;\nsatisfaction of this constitutional obligation requires the assistance of counsel, and specifically\nthe effective assistance of counsel. United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 654 (1984)( \"Mt has\nlong been recognized that the right to counsel is the right to the effective assistance of counsel.\"\n(quoting McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, 771, n.14 (1970))); McGowan v. State, 2006 ME\nThe Maine Constitution affords a right to counsel that is coextensive with the federal Sixth Amendment. State v.\nWatson, 2006 ME 80, ¶ 14, 900 A.2d 702. As with the federal Constitution, \"the constitutional right imposes an\naffirmative obligation on the State to provide court-appointed counsel if the defendant faces incarceration.\" Id.\n9\n\n16 ¶ 9, 894 A.2d 493. If mere appointment of counsel were sufficient, the right would be \"a sham\nand nothing more than a formal compliance with the Constitution's requirement that an accused\nbe given the assistance of counsel.\" Cronic, 466 U.S. at 654 (quotation marks omitted).\n32.  Because \"the adversarial process protected by the Sixth Amendment requires that\nthe accused have 'counsel acting in the role of an advocate,'\" the right to effective assistance is\nthe \"right of the accused to require the prosecution's case to survive the crucible of meaningful\nadversarial testing.\" Cronic, 466 U.S. at 656 (quoting Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 743\n(1967)). Once \"the process loses its character as a confrontation between adversaries, the\nconstitutional guarantee is violated.\" Id. at 656-657. In short, effective counsel is counsel that\ncan, and does, put the prosecutor's case to the test.\n33.  When assessing effectiveness of counsel, \"prevailing norms of practice as\nreflected in American Bar Association standards and the like . . . are guides to determining what\nis reasonable.\" Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 366( 2010)( cleaned up).\n34.  As relevant here, the American Bar Association has outlined ten principles to\nevaluate whether a state is providing assistance of counsel at all critical stages of a proceeding\n(\"ABA Principles\").2 These standards are:\na.  The public defense function, including the selection, funding, and payment\nof defense counsel, is independent.\nb.  Where the caseload is sufficiently high, the public defense delivery system\nconsists of both a defender office and the active participation of the private bar.\n2a mSeerei cAamnebrair.coarng /Bcaorn tAesnsto/cdiaamt/iaobna,/ Taedmn i nP irsitnrcaitpilvees/ olefg aal P_auibdl_iicn dDiegfeennt_sdee fDeenldiavnetrsy/l Ss_yssctleamid,_ adveafi lteanbplrei na ct i hptltepssbo: o//kw lewtw..\npdf( last visited Feb. 24, 2022).\n10\n\nc.  Clients are screened for eligibility, and defense counsel is assigned and\nnotified of appointment as soon as feasible after clients' arrest, detention, or request for\ncounsel.\nd.  Defense counsel is provided sufficient time and a confidential space\nwithin which to meet with the client.\ne.  Defense counsel's workload is controlled to permit the rendering of\nquality representation.\n£ Defense counsel's ability, training, and experience match the complexity\nof the case.\ng.  The same attorney continuously represents the client until completion of\nthe case.\nh.  There is parity between defense counsel and the prosecution with respect\nto resources and defense counsel is included as an equal partner in the justice system.\ni. Defense counsel is provided with and required to attend continuing legal\neducation.\nDefense counsel is supervised and systematically reviewed for quality and\nefficiency according to nationally and locally adopted standards.\nH.  Indigent Defense in Maine and the MCILS.\n35.  State law provides:\nBefore arraignment, competent defense counsel shall be assigned\nby the Superior or District Court, unless waived by the accused\nafter being fully advised of his rights by the court, in all criminal\ncases charging a felony, when it appears to the court that the\naccused has not sufficient means to employ counsel. The Superior\nor District Court may in any criminal case appoint counsel when it\nappears to the court that the accused has not sufficient means to\nemploy  counsel. The District  Court  shall  order  reasonable\n11\n\ncompensation to be paid to counsel by the District Court for such\nservices in the District Court. The Superior Court shall order\nreasonable compensation to be paid to counsel out of the state\nappropriation for such services in the Superior Court.\n15 M.R.S. § 810. The statute is supplemented by Rule 44 of the Maine Rules of Unified Criminal\nProcedure, which \"implements the constitutional right to counsel in a criminal proceeding.\" State\nv. Smith, 677 A.2d 1058, 1060 (Me. 1996). The rule specifies that a defendant has a right to be\nrepresented by counsel at every stage of the proceeding \"unless the court concludes that in the\nevent of conviction a sentence of imprisonment will not be imposed.\" M.R.U. Crim. P. 44(a)(1).\n36.  The State's current system of indigent defense took shape in 2009, with the\npassage of legislation creating MCILS.\n37.  MCILS was created to address concerns about the increasing cost and lack of\nindependent oversight of the indigent defense system, which was then funded and administered\nby the judiciary. A February 2009 report (\"the Clifford Commission Report\")3 attributed\nincreased costs to a surge in felony charges (due to changes to rules and applicable laws) and an\nincrease in the number of criminal defendants qualifying as indigent. The Clifford Commission\nReport recommended \"that Maine implement an indigent legal services system that is\nindependent from the judiciary, and that provides the training and oversight necessary to ensure\nquality representation to Maine's citizens.\"\n38.  According to its enabling legislation, MCILS is \"an independent commission\nwhose  purpose is  to  provide efficient,  high-quality  representation  to  indigent criminal\ndefendants, juvenile defendants and children and parents in child protective cases, consistent\nwith  federal  and state  constitutional  and statutory  obligations.\" 4 M.R.S. § 1801. The\ncommission is tasked with \"ensur[ing] the delivery of indigent legal services by qualified and\n3 Indigent Legal Services Commission, Clifford Commission Report 10, available al https://www.maine.gov/mcils/\nsites/maine.gov.mcils/files/documents/Clifford-Commission-Report.pdf( Feb. 2009).\n12\n\ncompetent counsel in a manner that is fair and consistent throughout the State\" and \"ensur[ing]\nadequate funding of a statewide system of indigent legal services, which must be provided and\nmanaged in a fiscally responsible manner, free from undue political interference and conflicts of\ninterest.\" Id.\n39.  As described in detail below, see infra, ¶¶ 46-71, MCILS has failed to fulfill\nthese duties, leaving Maine with a system that creates an unconstitutional risk that defendants\nwill be denied effective assistance of counsel in their criminal proceedings.\n40.  The Sixth Amendment Center, a nonprofit organization dedicated to ensuring\ncompliance with the Sixth Amendment in localities around the country, has catalogued MCILS's\nsystemic failures in this area. In particular, it detailed MCILS's failings in a 2019 report\ncommissioned by the Maine Legislative Council, a 10-member body consisting of the President\nof the Senate, the Speaker of the House, and the Republican and Democratic Floor Leaders and\nAssistant Floor Leaders of each body. See Sixth Amendment Center, The Right to Counsel in\nMaine: Evaluation of Services Provided by the Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\n(2019)( \"Sixth Amendment Center Report\"), excerpts of which are attached hereto as Exhibit 1.4\nAmong other deficiencies, the report found that MCILS failed to impose adequate attorney\nqualification  standards; ensure training  of new attorneys  and  continuing education for\nexperienced attorneys; adequately supervise attorneys; ensure meaningful representation at\ncritical stages of criminal proceedings; compensate attorneys to cover overhead and an adequate\nfee; or guard against conflicts of interest. Ex. 1, at iv—ix.\n41.  These failures are also documented in extensive detail in government reports and\nMCILS's own assessment of its operations.\nSee Sixth Amendment Center, The Right to Counsel in Maine: Evaluation of Services Provided by the Maine\nCommission on Indigent Legal Services, available at https://sixthamendment.org/6AC/6AC_me_report 2019.pdf\n(last visited February 24, 2022).\n13\n\n42.  On January 10, 2020, the Maine Legislature's Government Oversight Committee\ndirected its Office of Program Evaluation & Government Accountability (\"OPEGA\") to review\nMCILS's operations.' As described in the resulting report (attached as Exhibit 2), the Legislature\nrequested that OPEGA focus on (as relevant here) the \"adequacy of the oversight structure of\nMCILS in ensuring that operations align with and accomplish the organization's purpose.\" Ex. 2\nat 1. The Report concluded that, among other failings, \"overall . . . MCILS lacks adequate\nstandard operating procedures and formal written policies to govern its primary functions.\" Id.\n33.\n431  MCILS's Executive Director subsequently wrote a series of three memoranda in\nDecember 2021 and January 20226 discussing MCILS's compliance with various obligations,\neach of which likewise reveals the Commission's failure to fulfill its duties. These memoranda\ndiscuss  MCILS's  compliance  with  (1) its  statutory  obligations (\"MCILS  Statutory\nMemorandum,\" attached as Exhibit 3); (2) recommendations from the Sixth Amendment Center\nand OPEGA reports (\"MCILS OPEGA Memorandum,\" attached as Exhibit 4); and (3) the\nABA's Ten Principles( \"MCILS Ten Principles Memorandum,\" attached as Exhibit 5).\n44.  An individual MCILS Commissioner provided his own commentary on the\nExecutive Director's Ten Principles Memorandum (\"Commissioner Redline,\" attached as\nExhibit 6), concluding that the memorandum—which itself recognized MCILS's failings—\nnevertheless did not go far enough in recognizing how substantially MCILS underperforms its\nobligations.\n5 Office of Program Evaluation & Government Accountability of the Maine State Legislature, Report on the Maine\nCommission on Indigent Legal Services, available at https://legislature.maine.gov/doc/4769 (Jan. 2020).\n6 The MCILS Ten Principles Memorandum is dated January 2021, but it was produced in January 2022.\n14\n\n45.  While these documents reveal extensive failings in multiple areas of MCILS's\noperations, two particular failures stand out with respect to this litigation: MCILS's failure to\nfulfill its statutory obligations, and its implementation of the \"lawyer of the day\" system.\n(1) Failure to Fulfill Statutory Obligations \n46.  State statutes impose obligations that guide the State's stewardship of its indigent\ndefense system. Both MCILS and its Executive Director have failed to comply with these\nstatutory commands in multiple different categories.\n(a)  Development ofS tandards\n47.  First, section 1804(2) requires MCILS to \"develop standards governing the\ndelivery of indigent legal services, including:\nA. Standards governing eligibility for indigent legal services. The\neligibility standards must take into account the possibility of a\ndefendant's or civil party's ability to make periodic installment\npayments toward counsel fees;\nB. Standards prescribing minimum experience, training and other\nqualifications for contract counsel and assigned counsel;\nC. Standards for assigned counsel and contract counsel case loads;\nD. Standards for the evaluation of assigned counsel and contract\ncounsel. The commission shall review the standards developed\npursuant to this paragraph every 5 years or upon the earlier\nrecommendation of the executive director;\nE. Standards for independent, quality and efficient representation\nof clients whose cases present conflicts of interest;\nF. Standards for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by\nassigned counsel and contract counsel; and\nG. Other standards considered necessary and appropriate to ensure\nthe delivery of adequate indigent legal services.\n4 M.R.S. § 1804(2).\n15\n\n48.  Likewise, section 1804(3)(M) provides that the Commission \"shall ... [e]stablish\nprocedures for handling complaints about the performance of counsel providing indigent legal\nservices.\" Id. § 1804(3)(M).\n49.  MCILS has not developed these standards and procedures. As OPEGA explained,\n\"even when standards are required to be established specifically in statute, MCILS relies on\ninformal methods or does not address the standard at all.\" Ex. 2 at 33.\n50.  In particular, the OPEGA Report details that MCILS has not promulgated any\nstandards or procedures regarding counsel caseloads (subsection 2(C)); evaluation of counsel\n(subsection 2(D)); conflicts of interest (subsection 2(E)); or complaints about the performance of\ncounsel (subsection 3(M)). Id.\n51.  Absent any standards in this area, MCILS has no mechanism for monitoring or\nrectifying the experience Plaintiffs have had in their cases—namely, attorneys who do not return\ntheir calls, set up meetings, review their discovery with them, or generally take an active role in\nmoving their cases forward. See supra,n11-15.\n52.  And because Maine is unique as the only state where appointed private attorneys\nprovide all indigent defense, there may be no one else able to step when an appointed attorney is\nunavailable. See Ex. 1 at 26.\n53.  MCILS has had ample time to comply with these obligations. The statutory\nmandates to implement requirements surrounding case load and conflicts of interest were enacted\nin 2009, and so have been in place for over a decade. P.L. 2009, ch. 419, § 2. The statutory\nmandates surrounding evaluation of counsel and a complaint procedure were enacted in 2017,\nlikewise providing MCILS sufficient time to comply. P.L. 2017, ch. 284, Pt. UUUU, §§ 1, 2\n(AMD).\n16\n\n54.  MCILS itself has affirmed the accuracy of OPEGA's findings on statutory\nnoncompliance. A December 28, 2021, MCILS memorandum on statutory  compliance\nacknowledges that the \"Commission has not yet promulgated case load standards,\" noting only\nthat \"Commission staff anticipates that case load standards will be part of the updated\nperformance standards under development,\" while \"[c]ase load tracking and management\" will\nbe \"part of the system design for the next case management system.\" Ex. 3, at 102. Similar\ncomments are made about evaluation standards and conflicts of interest. Id. at 102-103.\n55.  Moreover, this failure makes it impossible for MCILS to fulfill its overarching\nstatutory role—namely, \"to provide efficient, high-quality representation to indigent criminal\ndefendants, juvenile defendants, and children and parents in child protective cases.\" 4 M.R.S.\n§ 1801. Without a standard for the number of cases an attorney should be handling, MCILS has\nno way of \"ensur[ing] the delivery of indigent legal services ... in a manner that is fair and\nconsistent throughout th.e State.\" Id. Likewise, with no standards for evaluating counsel,\nreviewing complaints about counsel, or resolving conflicts of interest, the Commission cannot\nevaluate whether indigent defendants are provided \"qualified and competent counsel,\" let alone\nrectify any cases where they are not. Id.\n(b)  Attorney Qualification, Training, and Compensation\n56.  MCILS's failure to promulgate these standards is particularly problematic given\nits deficient standards for attorney qualifications and training. As described by the Sixth\nAmendment Center, \"[j]ust as you would not go to a dermatologist for heart surgery, a real estate\nor divorce lawyer cannot be expected to handle a complex criminal case competently.\" Ex. 1 at\n27. And yet, that is precisely what the State's system allows.\n17\n\n57.  MCILS is required by statute to \"[d]evelop criminal defense, child protective and\ninvoluntary  commitment representation  training  and  evaluation  programs for  attorneys\nthroughout the State to ensure an adequate pool of qualified attorneys.\" 4 M.R.S. § 1804(3)(D).\nIt is also required to \"[e]stablish minimum qualifications to ensure that attorneys are qualified\nand capable of providing quality representation in the case types to which they are assigned,\nrecognizing that quality representation in each of these types of cases requires counsel with\nexperience and specialized training in that field.\" Id. § 1804(3)(E).\n58.  The standards and systems MCILS has established with respect to attorney\nqualifications and training are woefully inadequate.\n59.  To receive an assignment from the Commission, in most cases an attorney need\nonly attend a \"Commission-approved training course for the area of the law for which the\nattorney is seeking to receive assignments.\" 94-649 C.M.R. ch. 2, § 4( 2)( 2010).\n60.  This requirement can be satisfied by attending a single training course in criminal\nlaw. Ex. 1 at 30.\n61.  While there are greater qualifications for certain categories of serious offenses\nsuch as homicide and sex offenses, even in those cases an attorney can request a waiver. 94-649\nC.M.R. ch. 3, §§ 3, 4( 1)( 2010).\n62.  Thus, regardless of background, training, or prior case experience, MCILS allows\nattorneys to take on criminal representations after attending a single-day \"Minimum Standards\"\ncourse. This system does not satisfy MCILS's statutory obligation to \"ensure that attorneys are\nqualified and capable of providing quality representation in the case types to which they are\nassigned,\" 4 M.R.S. § 1804(3)(E), particularly  when coupled with MCILS's non-existent\nstandards for evaluating counsel or resolving complaints about counsel, see supra, ¶ 50.\n18\n\n63.  As an MCILS Commissioner has explained, the Commission's \"basic eligibility\nrequirements remain too low.\" See Correspondence from Ron Schneider (Jan. 10, 2022),\nattached as Exhibit 7. The Commission does \"not want to admit that there are lawyers receiving\nassignments who should not be receiving them or are not really ready to receive them, even\nthough full-time defense lawyers and judges could name them.\" Id. As a result, \"MCILS still\ndoes not ensure that every assigned lawyer has the necessary ability, training and experience\nnecessary to handle the case assigned to them as MCILS still permits lawyers just out of law\nschool with a one-day Commission-sponsored or Commission-Approved training course to\nrepresent a person, who, by definition, faces jail, involuntary confinement in a hospital, or the\nloss of custody of a child.\" Ex. 6, at 5.\n64.  And  while  MCILS technically  requires  specialized  training  for  certain\nrepresentations, a recent report found that \"more than 1 of every 8 case assignments that required\nspecialized representation was given to an attorney who was supposed to be ineligible to serve.\"7\n65.  MCILS's mechanisms for training and supervision are also statutorily and\nconstitutionally deficient. MCILS does not require appointed attorneys to obtain any training in\nany specific practice area, beyond the minimal requirements that the attorney must meet to first\nbe placed on the roster. And while MCILS created a \"Resource Counsel Program\" to provide\nappointed attorneys with a resource for mentoring and supervision, the 25 attorneys who staff\nthis program are capped at providing 10 hours of mentoring each month—a total of 250 hours to\nmentor and supervise the  hundreds of attorneys responsible for thousands of criminal\nrepresentations in the state. Ex. 1 at 31. MCILS also has no authority to require any attorney to\n7T hSoaumsaanntdhsa  oHfo Tghaens ea nCda sAegsn eAln yPhwialyi,p, M Laaiwnyee rMso nWihtoor W (eFreeb.

Compounding these failings, MCILS has failed to ensure that attorneys are\ncompensated in a manner commensurate with \"quality and efficient indigent legal services.\" 4\nM.R.S. § 1804(3)(A), (F). As MCILS itself acknowledges, its current rate of $80 per hour is\ninadequate, particularly because it does not incorporate overhead and administrative costs, such\nas the costs of support staff See, e.g., Jewell v. Maynard, 181 W. Va. 571, 578-579 (1989)\n(recognizing that states must account for overhead costs and expenses when evaluating adequate\ncompensation for appointed attorneys). MCILS has conceded that the current rate \"does not\nallow defense counsel to practice with the same resources as attorneys for [the] state,\" and that\n\"the gulf between the practice conditions of assigned counsel and their state-employed peers is\nstark.\" Ex. 5 at 6. Such \"[i]nadequate compensation 'leads to a decrease in the overall number of\nattorneys willing to accept court appointments' and can 'encourage some attorneys to accept\nmore clients than they can effectively represent in order to make ends meet.' Ex. 1 at 77. In\nMCILS's own words, \"there is no parity between assigned counsel and the state, nor [is] the\ndefense function an equal partner\" in the criminal justice system. Ex. 5 at 6.\n(c)  Monitoring The Indigent Defense System\n67.  MCILS is separately required to establish certain processes for monitoring the\nindigent defense system. These include a statutory obligation to \"[e]stablish a method for\naccurately tracking and monitoring caseloads of assigned counsel and contract counsel.\" 4\nM.R.S. § 1804(3)(G).\n68.  But MCILS does not actually know when a case is assigned, as a court does not\ndirectly inform MCILS that a lawyer has been assigned to a case.\n20\n\n69.  As MCILS itself acknowledges, the Commission \"does not yet have processes\nand procedures that track caseloads in real time.\" Ex. 3, at 104. MCILS does not have a target\ndate for implementing such a system. Id\n70.  While a lawyer can open a new matter in MCILS's database, many wait to do so\nuntil the case has been resolved and they start the process to apply for their voucher.\n71.  Absent this information, there is no way for MCILS to fulfill its obligation to\ntrack and monitor caseloads of assigned counsel. Learning of the representation after the fact is\nof little use because MCILS does not have an accurate understanding of an attorney's caseload at\na given point in time, nor can MCILS take any responsive actions based on attorney caseload.\n(d)  MCILS's Executive Director\n72.  The statutory scheme likewise imposes a series of obligations on the Executive\nDirector of MCILS. The Executive Director must, among other obligations, \"[e]nsure that the\nprovision of indigent legal services complies with all constitutional, statutory and ethical\nstandards,\" 4 M.R.S. § 1805(1), \"[a]ssist the commission in developing standards for the delivery\nof adequate indigent legal services,\" id. § 1805(2), and \"[a]dminister and coordinate delivery of\nindigent legal services and supervise compliance with commission standards,\" id. § 1805(3).\n73.  As detailed above, see supra, ?If 46-71, MCILS has failed in each of these\ncategories: the provision of indigent legal services does not comply with all constitutional,\nstatutory, and ethical standards, 4 M.R.S. § 1805(1); MCILS has failed to develop standards for\nthe delivery of adequate indigent legal services, Id. § 1805(2); and MCILS does not coordinate\nand supervise the delivery of indigent legal services, id. § 1805(3).\n74.  Moreover, given that the Commission has no way of tracking active MCILS\ncases, see supra, IT 68-69, it is impossible for the Executive Director to fulfill his statutory\n21\n\nobligation to \"[a]dminister and coordinate delivery of indigent legal services,\" 4 M.R.S.\n§ 1805(3).\n75.  The Executive Director has thus failed in fulfilling these statutory obligations.\n* * *\n76.  In addition to violating the statute, MCILS's lax approach to its statutory\nobligations creates an unconstitutional risk that indigent defendants will be assigned an attorney\nwho is ill-prepared and incapable of providing effective representation under the federal and\nstate constitutions.\n77.  As discussed above, the constitutional right to counsel is not fulfilled by the mere\nappointment of counsel. See supra,¶1131-32; Cronic, 466 U.S. at 654. But the mere appointment\nof counsel is all that MCILS's system provides. Without any standards for evaluating caseloads,\nconflicts of interest, or attorneys' performance, MCILS has no baseline for establishing what\neffective representation requires—let alone mechanisms for measuring how appointed counsel\nare performing. And even where MCILS has ostensibly put standards in place—for example,\nwith respect to attorney qualifications and training—these standards are far too low to ensure\neffective representation. See supra, IN 58-63.\n78.  As a result, MCILS's failure is not just a statutory violation, but a constitutional\nviolation as well.\n79. •  While courts are more accustomed to evaluating compliance with the Sixth\nAmendment in the context of the effectiveness of an individual attorney's performance, the\nConstitution's guarantee of the assistance of counsel is implicated when criminal defendants\nare—either actually or constructively—denied the assistance of counsel altogether. Roe v.\nFlores-Ortega, 528 U.S. 470,483 (2000). The two claims—ineffective assistance of counsel, on\n22\n\nthe one hand, and denial of counsel, on the other—are distinct. Penson v. Ohio, 488 U.S. 75, 88\n(1988). A denial of counsel claim is not a claim of substandard representation but rather it is a\nclaim of nonrepresentation, caused either by the actual failure to provide an attorney or by\nproviding an attorney who is not able to provide real assistance. Cronic, 466 U.S. at 658-660.\n80.  The systemic structural limitations in Maine's system, including but not limited to\nMCILS's failure to even satisfy its own statutory requirements, have resulted in a system that\ndenies Plaintiffs, and those similarly situated, with actual representation, as guaranteed by\nGideon and its  progeny. \"Actual representation assumes a certain  basic representational\nrelationship,\" Hurrell-Harring v. New York, 15 N.Y.3d 8, 22 (2010), which is impossible to\ndevelop and maintain when attorneys do not meet or communicate with their clients. See Public\nDefender, Eleventh Jud. Cir. ofF la. v. State, 115 So. 3d 261, 278 (Fla. 2013)( finding denial of\ncounsel where attorneys were \"mere conduits for plea offers,\" did not communicate with clients,\nwere unable to investigate the allegations, and were unprepared for trial).\nj The Lawyer of the Day System \n81.  Rule 5 of the Maine Rules of Unified Criminal Procedure allows for the\nassignment of a \"lawyer for the day . .. for the limited purpose of representing the [defendant] at\nthe initial appearance or arraignment.\" M.R.U. Crim. P. 5(e). These lawyers appear at 48-hour\nhearings for in-custody defendants and at the initial appearance.\n82.  There is no per se problem with a lawyer-of-the-day system. But the State's\nlawyer-of-the-day system, as implemented, violates two fundamental tenets of effective\nrepresentation: effective assistance of counsel at the outset of a criminal case and continuous\nrepresentation through the completion of a case.\n23\n\n83.  First, it is critical that a defendant receive effective representation \"at the earlier\nstages of a criminal case.\" Kuren v. Luzerne Cly., 637 Pa. 33, 80 (2016). Indeed, the \"right to\ncounsel is as important in the initial stages of a criminal case as it is at trial.\" Id.; see also ABA\nPrinciple 3.\n84.  The State's lawyer-of-the-day system fails to ensure effective representation at the\nstart of a defendant's case, because it is woefully under-resourced. In Androscoggin County, for\nexample, two lawyers of the day typically represent 200 defendants, with one lawyer estimating\nthat they had about 5 minutes with each defendant. Ex. 1, at 52-53. Likewise, in Cumberland\nCounty there are an average of two lawyers of the day to handle 80 defendants. Id. at 52. These\nattorneys must set up a makeshift office in the courthouse, or else meet with defendants while in\nlock-up, requiring them to attempt to describe constitutional rights to an entire group of in-\ncustody defendants, effectively leading to a group waiver of constitutional rights. Id.; see also\nWilbur v. City of Mount Vernon, 989 F. Supp. 2d 1122, 1124( W.D. Wash. 2013)( finding that a\n\"meet and plead\" system, where clients met their attorneys for the first time in court and\nimmediately accepted a plea bargain without discussing their cases in a confidential setting,\nresulted in the lack of a representational relationship that violated the Sixth Amendment).\n85.  This problem is not one of\" limited representation,\" State v. Galarneau, 2011 ME\n60, ¶ 8, 20 A.3d 99, but rather of no real representation at all. Because attorneys are often forced\nto communicate with defendants as a group, the \"basic representational relationship\" necessary\nfor \"[a]ctual representation\" is lacking. Hurrell-Harring, 15 N.Y.3d at 22,\n86.  The resource challenges are particularly acute for in-custody hearings, in which\nthe lawyer of the day is also responsible for making arguments for release on bail. As detailed by\n24\n\nMCILS's rules for criminal practice,8 the attorney should conduct an initial interview and\ninvestigation, including health (mental and physical) and employment background, criminal\nhistory, and the general circumstances of the alleged offense. Recent amendments to the bail\nstatute allow for further argument based upon caretaking responsibilities and other factors. See\n15 M.R.S. § 1026 (4)(C)(4), (12)-(14); P.L. 2021, ch. 397, § 5 (AMD). Yet the current lawyer-\nof-the-day system provides insufficient time and resources for the assigned attorney to\nmeaningfully confer on these topics with each person on the docket.\n87.  Compounding this problem, the defendant is typically assigned a different lawyer\nto handle the case going forward, resulting in a lack of continuous representation and requiring a\nnew attorney who is unfamiliar with the case to step in. See ABA Standardsf or Criminal Justice,\nStandards 5-6.2 cmt (3d ed. 1992) (explaining that \"the risk of substandard representation\"\nincreases given the new attorney's low familiarity with the case).\n88.  Mr. Robbins and Mr. Peirce both had to switch attorneys after initially being\nassigned a lawyer through the lawyer-of-the-day system.\n89.  Even for defendants who did not switch attorneys after their initial assignment,\nthe lawyer-of-the-day system does not provide adequate time for defendants to have any\nmeaningful communication with their assigned lawyers at their initial appearance or 48-hour\nhearing.\n90.  Mr. Mack, for example. pled not guilty at his initial appearance, but did not feel\nthat he had sufficient information about the proceedings to understand what was happening, and\nhe did not speak or otherwise participate at all in court. Nor did Mr. Mack feel that his attorney\ng Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services, Chapter 102: Standards of Practice for Attorneys Who Represent\nAdults in Criminal Proceedings (Feb. 27, 2012), available at https://www.maine.govhncils/sites/maine.gov.mcils/\nfiles/inline-files/Adult%20Criminal%20Standards%20Final%20Adopted%20to%20SOS%20effdate.Pdf.\n25\n\nadequately advocated for him with respect to bail, pushing Mr. Mack to independently request\nthat the state revisit bail in his case.\n91.  The same was true with respect to Mr. Huynh, who pled not guilty at his initial\nappearance, but did not feel that he had adequate information about the proceedings or the\ncharges against him to decide how to proceed.\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS\n92.  Plaintiffs bring this class action lawsuit pursuant to Rule 23 of the Maine Rules of\nCivil Procedure on behalf of all indigent persons who are now or who will be before a state court\nin Maine under formal charge of having committed any offense, the penalty for which includes\nthe possibility of confinement, incarceration, imprisonment, or detention in a correction facility\n(regardless of whether actually imposed) and who qualify for representation through Maine's\nindigent-defense system.\n93.  There are important questions of law and fact raised in this case that are common\nto the Class, including:\ni.  Whether Defendants have failed to comply with their statutory obligations to\nimplement an effective indigent-defense system, including their specific\nobligations to develop standards governing the delivery of indigent legal\nservices; establish training programs and attorney qualifications; and monitor\nthe indigent-defense system;\nii.  Whether Defendants' failure to adequately fund the delivery of indigent-\ndefense services, and, in particular, to ensure that attorneys are appropriately\ncompensated,  results  in  the  provision  of  constitutionally  deficient\nrepresentation;\n26\n\niii.  Whether Defendants' implementation of the lawyer-of-the-day system fails to\nensure the provision of effective representation at the start of a defendant's\ncase; and\niv.  Whether Defendants failure  to, implement, administer, and oversee an\nadequate public-defense system results in a violation of the state and federal\nconstitutions.\n94.  The claims of the Plaintiffs as Class representatives are typical of the claims of\nthe Class as a whole. Like all of the Class members, the Class representatives are being denied\ntheir right to counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Article I,\n§ 6 of the Maine Constitution as a result of MCILS's ongoing failure to adequately supervise,\nadminister, and fund indigent-defense services.\n95.  Also like all Class members, the Class representatives are being harmed by\nMCILS's ongoing failure to enact regulations setting standards for an adequate public defense\nsystem.\n96.  As discussed above, MCILS's failure to adopt standards or develop procedures\ngoverning the delivery of indigent-defense services creates a series of systemic failings. See\nsupra,11146-71.\n97.  Without a limit on the number of cases each attorney should handle, attorneys can\ntake on far more defendants than they are able to competently represent. Attorneys who do are\nthen unable to communicate with defendants, promptly return their calls, review their discovery,\nand generally  ensure that they can devote the level  of attention  needed for efficient\nrepresentation—all problems experienced by Plaintiffs here. See supra, 11 11-15.\n27\n\n98.  Similarly, without any procedure for evaluating counsel, MCILS has no way of\nknowing when particular attorneys fail to provide effective representation. MCILS has not even\ntaken the basic step of setting up a formal system for reporting complaints about particular\nattorneys, which would allow it to investigate particular attorneys as necessary. These attorneys\nthus remain in the pool of rostered attorneys, continually picking up new defendants who\nlikewise receive ineffective representation, even when it was clear to all that the attorney had a\ntrack record of failing to perform even basic functions of representation,\n99.  Likewise, without any procedure for evaluating conflicts of interest, MCILS\nleaves it to individual attorneys to identify conflicts and then recuse themselves from a case.\nMCILS has no way of knowing whether this is happening, and therefore has no way of\npreventing attorneys from representing defendants even when they are conflicted.\n100.  Even where MCILS has promulgated standards—with respect to  attorney\nqualifications and training, for example—MCILS fails to ensure compliance with these\nstandards, and, regardless, the standards are too low to guarantee effective representation.\n101.  The common questions of law and fact articulated above predominate over any\nindividualized questions that may arise out of the Plaintiffs' or Class members' criminal cases.\nAccordingly, a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient\nadjudication of the allegations raised in this matter.\n102.  MCILS has failed to adequately supervise, administer, and fund an indigent\ndefense system, thereby violating the rights of poor defendants across the State. In this way,\nDefendants have acted and refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the entire Class,\nmaking it appropriate for the Court to issue final injunctive and declaratory relief for all Class\nmembers.\n28\n\n103.  The Class representatives will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the\nClass. The interests of the Class representatives are not in conflict with the interests of any other\nindigent defendant, and the Class representatives have every incentive to pursue this litigation\nvigorously on behalf of themselves and the Class as a whole.\n104.  The Class representatives are being represented by experienced, well-resourced\ncounsel in this matter, including the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, Preti Flaherty,\nBeliveau & Pachios, LLP, and Goodwin Procter LLP. The ACLU of Maine—an affiliate of the\nnationwide American Civil Liberties Union—has more than five decades of experience\ndefending the civil liberties of the people of Maine, including through state and federal civil-\nrights actions. Counsel at Preti, Flaherty, Beliveau & Pachios, LLP, possess expertise in complex\nlitigation, administrative law, and matters relating to Maine state government. And counsel at\nGoodwin Procter LLP have extensive experience litigating complex actions in trial and appellate\ncourts, including a significant track record of litigating civil-rights suits in conjunction with\nACLU affiliates.\nCOUNT I:\nVIOLATION OF THE SIXTH AMENDMENT (42 U.S.C. § 1983)\nPlaintiffs v. All Defendants\n105.  Plaintiffs reallege the preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.\n106.  42 U.S.C. § 1983 provides that \"[e]very person who, under color of any statute,\nordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State . . . subjects, or causes to be subjected, any\ncitizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of\nany rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the\nparty injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\"\n29\n\n107.  The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as applicable to the\nStates through the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that, \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the\naccused shall enjoy the right .. . to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.\"\n108.  As courts have explained, where, as here, plaintiffs sue for prospective relief in\nconjunction with the state's provision of indigent-defense services, the plaintiffs' burden is to\ndemonstrate \"the likelihood of substantial and immediate irreparable injury, and the inadequacy\nof remedies at law.\" Luckey v. Harris, 860 F.2d 1012, 1017 (11th Cir. 1988)( quotations marks\nomitted; emphasis added). Plaintiffs have not yet been sentenced (or, in some cases, convicted),\nand are not seeking (through this suit) release from prison. Rather, they seek prospective relief to\navoid future harm from the state's ongoing provision of insufficient indigent-defense services in\ntheir case. As a result, there is no need for plaintiffs to show prejudice in any individual case. See\nid. (differentiating a suit for prospective relief from a Strickland action where \"a party seeks to\noverturn his or her conviction\"). Plaintiffs can instead state a claim for relief based on, for\nexample, \"systemic\" actions that \"hamper the ability of their counsel to defend them\" and\n\"effectively deny them their eighth and fourteenth amendment right to bail.\" Id.\n109.  Applying these principles, the State's indigent defense system violates the Sixth\nAmendment in two ways.\n110.  First, MCILS has failed to develop and implement an effective system for the\nappointment of counsel for indigent defendants. In particular, MCILS has failed to (i) set and\nenforce standards for counsel caseloads, conflicts of interest, and attorney performance; (ii)\nmonitor and evaluate rostered attorneys; (iii) ensure adequate funding and support for rostered\nattorneys; and (iv) provide training to rostered attorneys. Even where MCILS has set standards\n(with respect to attorney qualifications, for example), these standards are both insufficiently\n30\n\nrigorous  and  not sufficiently  enforced. These  violations  unconstitutionally  infringe  or\nimminently threaten to infringe Plaintiffs' rights under the Sixth Amendment to the U.S.\nConstitution.\n111.  Second, MCILS's implementation of its lawyer-of-the-day program to provide\nrepresentation at criminal defendants' 48-hour hearings and initial appearances creates an\nunconstitutional risk of ineffective representation. No attorney reasonably can be expected to\nadequately represent all their clients when they are responsible for up to 100 defendants upon\nwalking into court in the morning. Under these conditions attorneys are forced to describe\nconstitutional rights to large groups of defendants, making it impossible to advise every\ndefendant as to the proper course of action in his or her individual case.\n112.  The  problems  with  the  lawyer-of-the-day  program  persist  throughout  a\ndefendant's case. A defendant who is not given effective counsel at the critical initial stage of his\nor her proceeding may make choices—as to whether to plead guilty, for example—that are\nimpossible to undo later in the case. Denial of bail at the initial hearing also has serious\nconsequences for the remainder of the case, with pre-trial detention significantly increasing the\nprobability of conviction, primarily due to an increase in guilty pleas.9\n113.  Defendants have acted and threatened to act under the color of state law in\ndepriving Plaintiffs of rights guaranteed by the Constitution and laws of the United States.\n114.  As a result, Plaintiffs are entitled to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, a\ndeclaratory judgment, costs and attorney's fees, and such other relief as the Court deems just.\n9 Megan Stevenson, Distortion ofJ ustice: How the Inability to Pay Bail Affects Case Outcomes, 34 J. Law Econ. &\nOrg. 511, 514 (2018).\n31\n\n115.  Because Defendants have acted and threatened to act under the color of state law\nto deprive Plaintiffs of rights guaranteed by the Constitution and laws of the United States,\nPlaintiffs may sue and seek relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\nCOUNT II:\nFAILURE TO PROMULGATE RULES( 5 M.R.S. § 8058)\nPlaintiffs v. MCILS and the Director\n116.  Plaintiffs reallege the preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.\n117.  Under the Maine Administrative Procedure Act, \"[a]ny person aggrieved by the\nfailure or refusal of an agency to act shall be entitled to judicial review thereof in the Superior\nCourt. The relief available in the Superior Court shall include an order requiring the agency to\nmake a decision within a time certain.\" 5 M.R.S. § 11001.\n118.  Likewise, \"ifiudicial review . . . of an agency's refusal or failure to adopt a rule\nwhere the adoption of a rule is required by law, may be had by any person who is aggrieved in an\naction for declaratory judgment in the Superior Court conducted pursuant to Title 14, section\n5951, et seq.\" 5 M.R.S. § 8058(1); see also id. (\"Mil the event that the court finds that an agency\nhas failed to adopt a rule as required by law, the court may issue such orders as are necessary and\nappropriate to remedy such failure.\").\n119.  Here, MCILS has failed to adopt rules required by two separate sources of law.\n120.  First, MCILS is statutorily mandated to promulgate standards governing the\ndelivery  of legal  services—including standards for  minimum qualifications  of counsel,\nmaximum caseloads, evaluation of counsel, and conflicts of interest. 4 M.R.S. § 1801(1); see\nsupra, 747-52. Yet in the decade since its creation, the agency has not promulgated .the\nrequired standards. See supra, 11 53-54.\n32\n\n121.  The Commission's and Executive Director's failures to comply with these\nstatutory directives violate the Maine Administrative Procedure Act.\n122.  Second, MCILS is  constitutionally  required  under the  federal  and  state\nconstitutions  to  provide  effective  representation  to  indigent defendants. To fulfill  this\nconstitutional  requirement, MCILS must adopt rules  to  ensure that  the  provision  of\nrepresentation complies with constitutional standards. MCILS has failed to do so here. See supra,\n¶ 46-71.\n123.  The Commission's and Executive Director's failures to comply with these\nconstitutional directives likewise violates the Maine Administrative Procedure Act.\n124.  These violations can be remedied through the Declaratory Judgments Act, 5\nM.R.S. §§ 5951-5963.\n125.  There is an actual controversy between the parties over the agency's failure to\npromulgate these statutorily required standards.\n126.  Pursuant to section 8508, Plaintiffs seek a declaration that the MCILS has failed\nto adopt a rule where the adoption of a rule is required by law, and the entry of an appropriate\norder to remedy that failure.\n* * * * *\nREQUEST FOR RELIEF\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request the following relief:\n1.  A declaratory judgment that Defendants' have denied the guarantee of the\nassistance of counsel to Plaintiffs and those similarly situated through their failure\nto ensure adequate gatekeeping, supervision, and training of state-appointed\ncounsel violates the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution;\n33\n\nIL  Injunctive relief requiring Defendants to guarantee the assistance of counsel to\nPlaintiffs and those similarly situated by establishing adequate gatekeeping,\nsupervision, and training of state-appointed counsel, consistent with the Sixth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution;\nIII.

Its services focus on the constitutional\nrequirement to provide effective assistance of counsel at all critical stages of\na case to the indigent accused facing a potential loss of liberty in a criminal or\ndelinquency proceeding.\nPREPARED FOR\nThe Maine Legislative Council is a ten-member body consisting of five\nmembers from each legislative chamber, including: the President of the\nSenate, Speaker of the House, bi-cameral Republican and Democratic Floor\nLeaders and their Assistant Floor Leaders. The Legislative Council governs the\nadministration of the Maine Legislature.\n\nEXECUTIVE SU V VARY\nIn 1963, the U.S. Supreme Court declared in Gideon v. Wainwright that it is an\n\"obvious truth\" that anyone who is accused of a crime and who cannot afford the cost\nof a lawyer \"cannot be assured a fair trial unless counsel is provided for him.\" In the\nintervening 56 years, the U.S. Supreme Court has clarified that the Sixth Amendment\nright to counsel means every person who is accused of a crime is entitled to have an\nattorney provided at government expense to defend him whenever that person is facing\nthe potential loss of his liberty and is unable to afford his own attorney. Moreover,\nthe appointed lawyer needs to be more than merely a warm body with a bar card. The\nattorney must also be effective, the U.S. Supreme Court said again in United States\nv. Cronic in 1984, subjecting the prosecution's case to \"the crucible of meaningful\nadversarial testing.\" Under Gideon, the Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel is\nan obligation of the states under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nThrough legislation enacted in 2009, the legislature created the Maine Commission\non Indigent Legal Services( MCILS) and commanded that it: \"provide efficient, high-\nquality representation to indigent criminal defendants,j uvenile defendants and children\nand parents in child protective cases, consistent with federal and state constitutional\nand statutory obligations\"; \"ensure the delivery of indigent legal services by qualified\nand competent counsel in a manner that is fair and consistent throughout the State\";\nand \"ensure adequate funding of a statewide system of indigent legal services, which\nmust be provided and managed in a fiscally responsible manner, free from undue\npolitical interference and conflicts of interest.\" ME. REv. STAT. ANN. tit. 4, § 1801\n(2018).\nSince its inception, MCILS has never used governmentally employed attorneys to\nprovide representation. Instead, MCILS either pays attorneys $60 per hour or, in\nSomerset County, pays a consortia of attorneys a fixed fee under contract. Maine is\nthe only state in the country that provides all indigent defense services through private\nattorneys.\nThere are two principal reasons that other states have moved away from using only\nprivate attorneys to provide all indigent defense services, and Maine has struggled\nwith both since the creation of MCILS. First, it is difficult to predict and contain costs\nin a private attorney system. A system can estimate future caseloads based on prior\nyear trends and apply average estimated costs per case, by case type, to calculate what\nfunding will be required to deliver its mandated services, but there is no guarantee\nthat past averages will continue to apply to future years. Second, it is difficult to\n\nIV  THE RIGHT TO COUNSEL IN MAINE\nsupervise private attorneys to ensure they can and do provide effective representation.\nFor example, despite the statutory command for MCILS to provide \"high-quality\"\nrepresentation, the State of Maine expects MCILS to maintain oversight of nearly 600\nattorneys, handling cases in 47 courthouses presided over by approximately 90 justices,\njudges, and magistrates, with a staff ofj ust three people (excluding financial screeners\nthat perform no oversight functions).\nIn 2017, the Maine legislature created the Working Group to Improve the Provision\nof Indigent Legal Services that determined that MCILS does not have systemic\noversight and evaluation of attorneys and is in need of stronger fiscal management\nand recommended an independent assessment. In March 2018, the Maine Legislative\nCouncil contracted the Sixth Amendment Center( 6AC)t o evaluate right to counsel\nservices provided by MCILS and to recommend any needed changes. Limitations of\ntime and resources prevent most indigent defense evaluations from considering every\ncourt, public defense system, and service provider in a given state, and so this study\nlooks closely at five counties: Androscoggin, Aroostook, Cumberland, Somerset, and\nYork.\nChapter 1 (p. 5 to 23) provides introductory information on the history of the right\nto counsel in Maine, an explanation of Maine's justice systems, and the study\nmethodology. Chapter II (p. 24 to 35) begins the assessment by evaluating Maine's\nattorney qualification, training and supervision and makes the following finding:\nFINDING 1: MCILS attorney qualification standards are too lenient, resulting\nin an excessive number of attorneys on panels, and there are no attorney\nrecertification requirements. MCILS has only limited new attorney training\nand lacks requirements that ongoing attorney training relate to defense-specific\nsubject areas. MCILS lacks appropriate supervision of attorneys.\nUnder MCILS' qualification requirements, an attorney who graduated from law school\ntwo years ago and hung out their shingle in a private practice, with no supervision\nor training, can have two jury trials and two judge trials and then be appointed to\nrepresent indigent defendants in every type of criminal case other than a homicide or\nsex offense. More worrisome perhaps is that indigent defendants charged with Class\nE crimes, carrying up to six months in jail, can be represented by an attorney who just\nreceived their bar card and completed a single training course in criminal law, as long\nas the lawyer has an email address, telephone number, and a confidential space to meet\nwith clients.\nMCILS does not require attorneys appointed to represent the indigent to obtain training\nin the fields in which they provide indigent legal representation (beyond that required\nto first be placed on the roster for appointments in operating under the influence or\ndomestic violence cases). Similarly, MCILS has not established any requirements for\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY  V\nsupervision of attorneys appointed to provide indigent legal representation. After the\nstart of the assessment, MCILS identified 25 attorneys statewide to serve as resource\ncounsel and provide mentoring to less experienced attorneys. However, these attorneys\nare each capped at providing only 10 hours of mentoring per month, and the resource\ncounsel attorneys do not have authority to require any mentee to cooperate.\nChapter III (p. 36 to 62) assesses how and when in the criminal justice process\ndefendants are informed about their right to counsel, how they are approved or\ndenied for MCILS services, and when attorneys are appointed to represent indigent\ndefendants. After a description of the criminal process in Maine, Chapter III makes\nfour findings:\nFinding 2: Although the courts' advice of rights video has many admirable\nqualities, few courts follow up with a colloquy to ensure that indigent defendants\nsaw the video and comprehend their rights before waiving counsel. Some\nprosecutors in some jurisdictions engage in plea discussions with uncounseled\ndefendants, and some courts actively encourage such negotiations. These practices\nresult in actual denial of counsel.\nIn every courtroom observed in all of the sample counties, the same video is played\nbefore the judge is on bench enumerating defendants' rights. No one ensures that\ndefendants have watched the video, understand the language spoken in the video, or\nhave the mental capacity to understand the video, and it is often the case that tardy\ndefendants enter without ever seeing the video at all.\nMoreover, under U.S. Supreme Court case law a plea negotiation is a critical stage\nof the case, meaning the negotiation cannot happen unless counsel is present or\nthe defendant's right to counsel has been knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently\nwaived. Despite this, throughout the sample counties, prosecutors talk to uncounseled\ndefendants to negotiate guilty pleas. This was most prevalent in the south where larger\ncourt populations, and not enough lawyers of the day, exacerbate the problems.\nFinding 3: Oversight of financial screeners by MCILS creates the appearance of\na conflict of interest with its duty to provide zealous representation to indigent\ndefendants.\nMCILS employs eight people to conduct financial screening of defendants who\nrequest appointment of counsel. Indigent defense systems must require their\nparticipating attorneys to adhere to their ethical duty to zealously defend in the stated\ninterests of the client, including advocating against the imposition of fines, fees, and\nother assessments. MCILS cannot assure that appointed attorneys fight against the\nimposition on indigent defendants of fees related to the cost of the defense, while\n\nVI  THE RIGHT TO COUNSEL IN MANE\nMCILS is simultaneously tasked with trying to collect fees assessed for the cost of\nrepresentation.\nA situation in Cumberland County transformed this appearance of a conflict of interest\nby MCILS into an actual conflict of interest. A statewide hiring freeze left vacant the\nMCILS financial screener position that covered Cumberland County. At the time of\nour site visit, the MCILS lawyers for the day were signing as notaries the financial\naffidavits of the defendants they advise and represent, which are then submitted to the\ncourt. This process places the lawyer in the position of a potential witness against the\nclient, in the event the affidavit is challenged. Finally, conflict of interest concerns\naside, having lawyers perform at $60/hour a service that is normally performed by a\nfinancial screener paid $12.75/hour is simply not cost efficient governance.\nFinding 4: MCILS'\" lawyer of the day\" system primarily serves the need to\nmove court dockets, while resulting in a lack of continuous representation to the\ndetriment of defendants. There is often a critical gap in representation while a\nsubstantive lawyer is identified and appointed. Additionally, the lawyer of the day\npractices under the Somerset contract result in a direct conflict of interest.\nMCILS provides for a \"lawyer of the day\" to appear at 48-hour hearings for in custody\ndefendants and at initial appearance for out of custody defendants. The number of\nlawyers serving as lawyer for the day is generally insufficient to even meet with,\nmuch less actually provide representation to, the number of defendants scheduled on\neach day's docket. For example, on an average day in Cumberland County's Portland\nDistrict Court there are two lawyers for the day to handle 80 defendants.\nThe lawyer for the day system provides limited representation because it is only \"for\nthe day,\" not for the case. In most instances the \"lawyer of the day\" does not continue\nwith the case. Instead, courts make a formal appointment off of a roster of MCILS\napproved lawyers. Some judges like to select the individual attorney to appoint in\na given case, some leave it to their clerks to do after the hearing, and some use a\nrotational system where the next attorney on the list is appointed. However, a gap in\nrepresentation occurs when those appointments are delayed.\nThe lawyer of the day program in Somerset County produces a direct conflict of\ninterest. The contract attorneys can be hired by non-indigent defendant who appear\nin court while the contract attorneys are serving as lawyer for the day. That is, the\nattorney could reject a defendant for appointed counsel and then accept the case as a\nprivate retainer. This central role of the contract attorneys in meeting as lawyer for\nthe day every person who is hailed into court creates a monopoly of sorts, as attorneys\noutside of Somerset County said they are effectively prevented from establishing a\npractice in Somerset County. That is, the contract attorneys keep not only all the\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY  VII\nassigned work but also most of the private work, since the contract has provided them\na personal introduction to all defendants.\nFinding 5: Despite there being many excellent assigned lawyers providing\nrepresentation to the indigent accused throughout Maine, there are also too many\nattorneys throughout the state who do not perform adequately.\nIn one of the studied counties, the Sheriff estimated, due to the volume of prisoner\ncomplaints, that about 25% of assigned attorneys do not visit their clients in jail to\nprepare their cases. He was also concerned about attorneys not accepting calls from the\njail. He said prisoners stop calling when their calls are not accepted. Consistent with\nthat report, one judge estimated that 25% of assigned counsel have not met with their\nclients before the first dispositional conference date She reported that up to 10% of\nattorneys withdraw or become a second chair if the case goes to trial.\nMCILS data tends to confirm these observations of the sheriffs. For example, the 6AC\nrequested three years of data on jail visits on cases billed out of Cumberland County.\nThe data reveal a number of attorneys that often visit clients, but a concerning number\nof folks that do not. For example, in 2017, one attorney billed MCILS $111,771 for\ncases arising in Cumberland County, including $3,024 for 96 jail visits. By contrast,\nanother attorney billed MCILS $171,880, but did not bill any time for even a single jail\nvisit. Certainly it is possible, though unlikely, that the attorney simply decided it was\nnot worth the time to bill jail visits, but the point is that MCILS and the State of Maine\ndo not know because of a lack of oversight.\nThe final substantive chapter, Chapter IV (p. 63-70), assesses the extent to which\nMCILS ensures that lawyers have sufficient time to work on cases, especially in\nrelation to attorneys being assigned too many cases. This Chapter makes one finding:\nFinding 6: Despite the lack of MCILS workload limits, excessive caseloads may\nnot be an issue in most counties in Maine. However,i nsufficient time is an issue\nin Somerset County, where the combination of high caseloads and the fixed fee\ncontract system produce financial incentives to dispose of cases without adequate\npreparation.\nEven factoring in \"lawyer of the day\" duties in most jurisdictions, the attorneys with\nthe most cases handled in Aroostook, Androscoggin, Cumberland, and York Counties\ndo not appear to have excessive appointed caseloads. The one place where there are\ndefinitely time sufficiency issues is in Somerset County. Over the past six years, the\naverage number of hours spent per indigent defense case has declined. For example, in\nFY 2013, on average the lawyers spent 6.78 hours per adult case in FY 2013. By FY\n2018, the number dropped to 2.99 hours on average per adult criminal case (a decrease\nof approximately 56%). Importantly, MCILS does not require from the Somerset\n\nVIII  THE RIGHT TO COUNSEL IN MAINE\nCounty Project reporting of adult criminal cases to be distinguished by severity, which\nwould allow MCILS to more accurately track attorney workloads. That said, 2.99\nhours per adult criminal case is extremely and unreasonably low, even if every case\nwas a class D or E charge.\nChapter V (p. 71-85) discusses attorney compensation and evaluates MCILS ability to\nprovide fiscal oversight of state resources. The Chapter makes two findings:\nFinding 7: MCILS' fixed fee contract causes a financial conflict of interest.\nMCILS' hourly rate is inadequate to both cover overhead and provide lawyers an\nadequate fee.\nFixed fee contracts, in which a lawyer earns the same pay no matter how many cases\nhe is required to handle, create financial incentives for a lawyer to dispose of cases as\nquickly as possible, rather than as effectively as possible for the client. In FY 2017,\nthe average fee per case under the Somerset contract was $573.16, slightly higher than\nthe average billed by the assigned counsel elsewhere (statewide $554.80). The average\nhours per case spent in Somerset, at 3.27, was much lower than the statewide average\nof 9.25 (assuming the 2017 rate was $60/hour), resulting in the Somerset hourly rate\npaid for counsel being $174.97. So, in Somerset County, the State of Maine is paying\nattorneys three times the rate it pays everyone else and getting approximately one third\nless work.\nThe hourly compensation rate in Maine ($60/hour) is not enough to cover overhead\nand ensure a reasonable fee. As a comparison, the South Dakota Supreme Court set\npublic counsel compensation hourly rates at $67 per hour in 2000. To ensure that\nattorneys are perpetually paid both a reasonable fee and overhead, the court also\nmandated that \"court-appointed attorney fees will increase annually in an amount\nequal to the cost of living increase that state employees receive each year from the\nlegislature.\" Assigned counsel compensation in South Dakota now stands at $95 per\nhour. For comparison purposes, a $95 hourly fee in South Dakota in 2019 is equivalent\nto a $114.95 hourly fee in Maine in 2019.\nFinding 8: A significant number of attorneys bill in excess of eight hours per\nday, five days per week,f or 52 weeks per year. MCILS does not exert adequate\nfinancial oversight of private attorneys.\n\"Over-billing\" was a topic raised frequently throughout the state. In Maine, attorneys\ndo not submit vouchers under penalty of perjury. No statutes or MCILS rules limit\nattorney hours by day or by year. MCILS conducts no audits. Not surprisingly, a\nreview of MCILS vouchers over the past five years generated serious concerns in some\ninstances about whether limited taxpayer resources are being used effectively.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY  IX\nIf an attorney works eight hours per day, five days per week, for 52 weeks a year,\nthat attorney should make no more than $124,800 at the current $60 per hour MCILS\nrate. In FY 2018, 25 attorneys billed MCILS in excess of 40 hours per week. The top\nbiller in FY2018 billed more than 88 hours per week. As part of this review, the 6AC\nreached out to the Federal Defender Services Division of the Administrative Office\nof the United States Courts. Although they are not allowed to confirm the number of\ncases appointed, the Federal Defender Services, Legal and Policy Division, confirmed\nthat eight of these 25 lawyers received federal court appointments during this same\ntime period.\nTo remedy these issues, Chapter VI( P. 86-96) sets out a series of recommendations:\nRECOMMENDATION 1: The State of Maine should remove the authority to\nconduct financial eligibility screenings from the Maine Commission for Indigent\nLegal Services. The reconstituted Task Force on Pretrial Justice Reform should\ndetermine the appropriate agency to conduct indigency screenings.\nRECOMMENDATION 2: The State of Maine should statutorily bar\ncommunication between prosecutors and unrepresented defendants, unless and\nuntil defendants have been informed of their right to appointed counsel, a judge\nhas conducted the legally required colloquy, and a defendant has executed a\nwritten waiver of the right to counsel in each case to ensure that all waivers of the\nright to counsel are made knowingly and voluntarily.\nRECOMMENDATION 3: Except for ministerial, non-substantive tasks, the State\nof Maine and the Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services should require\nthat the same properly qualified defense counsel continuously represents the\nclient in each case, from appointment through disposition, and personally appears\nat every court appearance throughout the pendency of an assigned case.\nRECOMMENDATION 4: MCILS should use its current statutory power to\npromulgate more rigorous attorney qualification, recertification, training,\nsupervision, and workload standards. The State of Maine should statutorily\nrequire financial oversight by requiring that MCILS limit the number of\npermissible billable hours, subject to waiver only upon a finding of need for\nadditional capacity. The State of Maine should fund MCILS at a level to ensure\nrigorous training and effective substantive and financial oversight of attorneys.\nRECOMMENDATION 5: The State of Maine should statutorily ban all public\ndefense contracts that provide financial disincentives to or that otherwise\ninterfere with zealously advocating on behalf of the defendants' stated interests,\nincluding the use of fixed fee contracts. Maine should require that any public\ndefense contract include reasonable caseload limits, reporting requirements on\n\nX  THE RIGHT TO COUNSEL IN MAINE\nany private legal work permitted, and substantial performance oversight, among\nother protections.\nRECOMMENDATION 6: The State of Maine should fund MCILS at a level\nthat allows private attorneys to be compensated for overhead expenses plus a\nreasonable fee (i.e., $100 per hour). MCILS should be authorized to provide\nadditional compensation of $25 per hour for designated case types such as\nmurder, sexual assaults, and postconviction review.\nRECOMMENDATION 7: The State of Maine should authorize and fund MCILS\nat an appropriate level to employ state government attorneys and support staff to\noperate a statewide appellate defender office and a Cumberland County trial level\npublic defender office.\n\nTHE RIGHT TO COUNSEL\nIN MAINE\nEVALUATION OF SERVICES PROVIDED\nBY THE vAINE COvIvISSION\nON 1\\DIGE\\T LEGAL SERVICES\nAPRIL 2019\n\nTA-LE OF CO\\TE\\TS\nI.

ATTORNEY QUALIFICATIONS. TRAINING & SUPERVISION  25\noverseeing the Scottsboro Boys' Alabama trial appointed a real estate lawyer from\nChattanooga, Tennessee, who was not licensed in Alabama and was admittedly\nunfamiliar with the state's rules of criminal procedure.'°' The Powell Court concluded\nthat defendants require the \"guiding hand\" of counsel;'\" that is, the attorneys a state\nprovides to represent indigent defendants must be qualified and trained to help those\ndefendants advocate for their stated legal interests.\nThis report is concerned principally with the right to counsel that is mandated by\nthe Sixth Amendment, as it is provided to adults at the trial level in Maine; that is,\nrepresentation provided to indigent adults who face the possible loss of their liberty\nas punishment for a crime. Throughout Maine under the indigent legal system\nadministered by the MCILS, many of the same attorneys provide all indigent legal\nrepresentation — both that required under the federal constitution and that required\nor allowed under Maine law though not mandated by the Sixth Amendment. This\nmeans that attorneys are appointed to represent adults and children in a variety of\n' case types, at both trial and appeal, and must be competent not only in criminal and\ndelinquency law but also in a broad range of civil law areas.\nFinding 1: MCILS attorney qualification standards are too lenient, resulting in an\nexcessive number of attorneys on panels, and there are no attorney recertification\nrequirements. MCILS has only limited new attorney training and lacks\nrequirements that ongoing attorney training relate to defense-specific subject\nareas. MCILS lacks appropriate supervision of attorneys.\nThe first thing that must occur in a system to provide effective assistance of counsel\nis to select the attorneys who are available to provide that representation. National\nstandards, as compiled in the ABA Ten Principles, require that, \"[w]here the caseload is\nsufficiently high, the public defense delivery system consists of both a defender office\nand the active participation of the private bar.\"'\"\n'°'  A retired local attorney who had not practiced in years was also appointed to assist in the\nrepresentation of all nine co-defendants.\n102 Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 68-69 (1932).( \"The right to be heard would be, in many cases, of\nlittle avail if it did not comprehend the right to be heard by counsel. Even the intelligent and educated\nlayman has small and sometimes no skill in the science of law. If charged with crime, he is incapable,\ngenerally, of determining for himself whether the indictment is good or bad. He is unfamiliar with the\nrules of evidence. Left without the aid of counsel he may be put on trial without a proper charge, and\nconvicted upon incompetent evidence, or evidence irrelevant to the issue or otherwise inadmissible. He\nlacks both the skill and knowledge adequately to prepare his defense, even though he may have a perfect\none. He requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the proceedings against him. Without it,\nthough he be not guilty, he faces the danger of conviction because he does not know how to establish his\ninnocence.\").\n103 AMERICAN BAR ASSN, ABA TEN PRINCIPLES OF A PUBLIC DEFENSE DELIVERY SYSTEM, Principle 2( Feb.\n2002).\n\n26  THE RIGHT TO COUNSEL IN MAINE\nSince its inception, MCILS has never used governmentally employed attorneys to\nprovide representation to the indigent accused, leaving Maine as the only state in the\ncountry that provides all indigent defense services through private attomeys.104 There\nare two principal reasons that other states have moved away from using only private\nattorneys to provide all indigent defense services, and Maine has struggled with\nboth since the creation of MCILS. First, it is difficult to predict and contain costs in\na private attorney system.( See Chapter V.). A system can estimate future caseloads\nbased on prior year trends and apply average estimated costs per case, by case type,\nto calculate what funding will be required to deliver its mandated services, but there\nis no guarantee that past averages will continue to apply to future years. Second, it\nis difficult to supervise private attorneys to ensure they can and do provide effective\nrepresentation. For example, continual changes in technology make digital evidence\nsuch as video surveillance, social media posts, and smart phone searches crucial for\ndefense discovery and investigation in many criminal cases. Likewise, the opioid crisis\nhas added layers of complexity to the resolution of many criminal, delinquency, child\nprotection, and mental health cases.\nMCILS struggles to oversee the services provided by private lawyers. Indigent legal\nservices in Maine are provided at trial and appeal by nearly 600 private attorneys,105\nhandling cases in 47 courthouses presided over by approximately 90 justices,j udges,\nand magistrates.'°6 Despite the statutory command for MCILS to provide \"high-\n104 For comparison, 25 states in addition to Maine fund all appellate and trial indigent defense\nservices: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas (except counties responsible for office facilities, equipment, and\nsupplies), Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland,\nMassachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, North\nDakota, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. In each of these states, some\nportion of services are delivered through state government employees. For example, even though\nMassachusetts primarily uses private counsel, serious felonies and primary juvenile delinquency services\nare provided by governmentally employed public defenders. Similarly, even though trial services in\nOregon are provided by private attorneys under contract, a significant portion of appellate services are\nprovided by state government employed lawyers.\nIn the other 24 states that require counties to fund some portion of indigent defense services, there\nis at least one public defender office employing government attomeys (either state- or county-funded) in\nevery state.\n1°'  Five hundred ninety-three individual attorneys were appointed to one or more cases during fiscal\nyears 2014 to 2018. Attorney billing reflects an extremely wide range in the number of hours each\nattorney devotes to providing indigent legal services. For example, one attorney billed the state a total\nof $1,189,361 over those five years (and average of $237,872.27 per year); while one attorney billed the\nstate for just $144.00 in one year (2018).\n1°'  Maine has one Supreme Judicial Court, 24 superior court justices (including active retired) in 17\ndifferent courthouses, 50 district court judges (including active retired) in 29 different courthouses,\nand nine family law magistrates (including active retired), each of whom can potentially preside over\na case in which counsel is appointed to provide indigent legal services.

More worrisome perhaps is that indigent defendants\ncharged with Class E crimes, carrying up to six months in jail, can be represented by\nan attorney who just received their bar card and completed a single training course\nin criminal law, as long as the lawyer has an email address, telephone number, and a\nconfidential space to meet with clients.\nAttorney training & supervision\nThe Maine Rules ofP rofessional Conduct recognize that ongoing training is necessary\nfor attorneys to maintain their familiarity with criminal law and procedure, as well\nas their competence to provide effective representation.'\" Similarly, all national\nstandards, including those of the National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice\nStandards and Goals,' require that the indigent defense system provide attorneys with\naccess to a \"systematic and comprehensive\" training program,'\" at which attorney\nattendance is compulsory, in order to maintain competence from year to year.'29\nTraining must be tailored to the types and levels of cases for which the attorney seeks\npublic appointment. If, for example, the lawyer has not received training on the latest\nforensic sciences and case law related to drugs, then the government should ensure\nthat lawyer is not assigned to drug-related cases. If a public defense provider does not\nhave the \"knowledge and experience to offer quality representation to a defendant in\na particular matter,\" then the attorney is obligated to move to withdraw from the case,\n126 ME. R. PROFI CONDUCT 1.1, \ncmt.

The NAC crafted standards for all criminal justice functions,\nincluding law enforcement, corrections, the courts, and the prosecution.

In June 2018, MCILS began a \"Resource\nCounsel Program\" to assist MCILS staff by having experienced assigned counsel\neventually provide \"mentoring, supervision, and evaluation of private assigned\ncounsel.\"134 In the fall of 2018, MCILS identified 25 attorneys statewide to serve as\nresource counsel and provide mentoring to less experienced attorneys. That said, the\n25 resource counsel attorneys are each capped at providing 10 hours of mentoring\nper month, and the program is not available in the mental health practice area.

Although any rostered lawyer could sign up for this duty, in\nAroostook County two local lawyers predominantly handle this function:'25\n\"Lawyer of the day\" duties for out of custody defendants are more evenly\ndispersed among attorneys than the practice of one or two attorneys handling\nmost of the lawyer of the day duties for in custody defendants. This is because\nit is more likely that an attorney will be appointed to cases for which they\nappear as the lawyer of the day.'''\nThe Cumberland County system relies on group announcements to apprise defendants\nof legal rights, including an invocation that they may have to wait hours to consult\nwith the lawyer for the day. As elsewhere in the state, the number of lawyers serving\nas lawyer for the day is generally insufficient to even meet with, much less actually\nprovide representation to, the number of defendants scheduled on each day's docket.\nOn an average day in Cumberland County's Portland District Court, there are two\nlawyers for the day to handle 80 defendants; about 12 of the cases are serious crimes\nand only about half of those defendants have retained counsel.\nWhen the judge takes the bench in Cumberland District Court, the lawyers for the day\nexit the courtroom carrying stacks off inancial affidavit forms. They set up a makeshift\noffice in a conference room where out of custody defendants line up to meet with them.\nThe lawyer for the day tries to describe constitutional rights in the lockup to a whole\ngroup of in custody defendants. There is a lack of confidentiality for both of these\ninterviews. One defense lawyer hates to be assigned as lawyer for the day because he\nbelieves a group waiver of rights is unconstitutional.\nAnother defense attorney reports being expected to represent up to 30 people on\na single docket as lawyer of the day. The lawyer of the day is required to advise\nall defendants at court, whether indigent or not. the lawyer is supposed to receive\ndiscovery with a written plea offer from the district attorney's office on the day before\ncourt, and is expected to meet the client the next day and advise them. Some attorneys\nadvise defendants without having received discovery. This lawyer believes there\nshould be MCILS standards on follow-through by the lawyer for the day to provide\ninformation to successor counsel, because many attorneys do not do so. MCILS did not\noffer or provide any training for the role as lawyer of the day.\nIn Androscoggin County, two lawyers of the day are typically expected to represent\n200 defendants. One lawyer, who will no longer accept assignment as lawyer for the\n215 Over the past four years, one attorney handled 617 in-custody lawyer of the day cases (32.25%) and\na second attorney handled 11.55%. Twenty-eight other lawyers handled at least one day of in-custody\nlawyer of the day duties in Aroostook County over the past five years, but each handled less than 5% of\nthe possible in-custody days.\n'16 Nineteen lawyers were paid for out of custody lawyer of the day duties in Aroostook County from\nFY2014 to FY2018. The lawyer serving most frequently staffed 45 dockets (12.20%).\n\nIII. EARLY APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL  53\nday, estimated having about five minutes to spend with each defendant.\nMaking the lawyer for the day available to non-indigent litigants exacerbates the denial\nof counsel to indigent defendants, conflicts with Maine state law on the scope of the\nright to counsel, and creates an unreasonable risk of solicitation in violation of ethical\nrules.\nAppointment of counsel\nOnce a court determines that a defendant is eligible for appointment of counsel, then\nthe court must appoint an MCILS attorney to represent that defendant.\nContinuous representation from appointment through disposition\nABA Principle 7 requires that the same attorney initially appointed to a case\ncontinuously represent the defendant through disposition of the case.'\" Commonly\nreferred to as \"vertical representation,\" the continuous representation by the same\nattorney is contrasted with \"horizontal representation\" — a representational scheme\nwhereby one attorney represents the client during one court proceeding before handing\noff the client's case to another attorney to cover the next stage.\nAs the American Bar Association explains, \"horizontal representation\" is uniformly\nimplemented as a cost-saving measure in the face of excessive workloads and to the\ndetriment of clients. In fact, the ABA rejects the use of horizontal representation in\nany form, stating specifically that: \"[c]ounsel initially provided should continue to\nrepresent the defendant throughout the trial court proceedings and should preserve the\ndefendant's right to appeal, if necessary.\"218\nIn explaining why horizontal representation is so harmful to clients, the ABA states:\nDefendants are forced to rely on a series of lawyers and, instead of\nbelieving they have received fair treatment, may simply feel that they\nhave been \"processed by the system.\" This form of representation\nmay be inefficient as well, because each new attorney must begin by\nfamiliarizing himself or herself with the case and the client must be re-\ninterviewed. Moreover, when a single attorney is not responsible for\n217 AMERICAN BAR ASS'N, ABA TEN PRINCIPLES OF A PUBLIC DEFENSE DELIVERY SYSTEM, Principle 7\n(2002).\n218 AMERICAN BAR ASS'N, ABA TEN PRINCIPLES OF A PUBLIC DEFENSE DELIVERY SYSTEM, Principle 7 colt.\n(2002).\n\nV.

Rather,\nadequate compensation for the attorney is required to ensure that the attorney provides\neffective representation to each client. Inadequate compensation \"leads to a decrease\nin the overall number of attorneys willing to accept court appointments\"274 and can\n\"encourage some attorneys to accept more clients than they can effectively represent in\norder to make ends meet.\"\"2\nTo underscore just how a $60 per hour rate does not afford both a reasonable fee and\ncoverage of actual overhead expenses, one need only to look at a few other states\nwhose assigned counsel compensation rates were challenged through litigation:\nWest Virginia: The West Virginia Supreme Court determined in 1989 that court\nappointed attorneys in that state were forced to \"involuntarily subsidize the\nState with out-of-pocket cash,\"'\" because the then-current rates did not cover\nattorney overhead. \"Perhaps the most serious defect of the present system,\"\nthe court found, \"is that the low hourly fee may prompt an appointed lawyer to\nadvise a client to plead guilty, although the same lawyer would advise a paying\nclient in a similar case to demand a jury trial.\"277 A now 30-year-old survey of\nmore than 250 West Virginia lawyers who were taking appointed cases (i.e.,\n269 \n94-649 Code Me.

Introduction and Background\nAbout the Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services and OPEGA's evaluation\nAs written in statute, the purpose of the Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services (MCILS) is\nto provide efficient, high quality representation to indigent criminal defendants, juvenile defendants\nand children and parents in child protective cases. MCILS is comprised of the Commission itself and\nwhat we will refer to in this report as the \"agency.\" The agency refers to the office staff who\nadminister the day-to-day functions of MCILS and supports the workings of the Commission.\nThe Government Oversight Committee (GOC) directed OPEGA to expedite two elements of a\nbroader evaluation of MCILS on January 10, 2020'.\n• Adequacy of systems and procedures used by MCILS staff to process payments and\nexpenditures associated with providing legal representation to clients who have been\ndetermined to be indigent or partially indigent.\n• Adequacy of the oversight structure of MCILS in ensuring that operations align with and\naccomplish the organization's purpose.\nThis evaluation will speak to each of those areas and what OPEGA found. Our review of the\nfinancial functions includes an examination of the systems used by the agency to process invoices,\nvouchers and payments and the methods employed by the agency to detect potential overbilling.\nOPEGA accessed from the agency, or independently obtained, MCILS's financial data to evaluate\nboth the adequacy of those systems, and the methods employed by the staff, in administering the\nfinancial responsibilities of the agency. In Part II of this report, OPEGA details our analysis of the\nfinancial data and identifies issues with the effectiveness and efficiency of those systems and\nmethods. The data obtained by OPEGA covers financial information from FY09 through FY19.\nUnless otherwise indicated, our analysis of the data applies to that time period. With regard to\nMCILS's oversight structure, OPEGA applied a more qualitative approach to evaluate that structure\nand identify weaknesses. Part III of this report discusses the overall weakness of this structure, by\ndescribing inadequate staffing levels and inefficient use of staff resources within the agency, resulting\nin a lack of appropriate support to facilitate the Commission's responsibility to establish and\n1 See appendix A for Project Direction Statement\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 1\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nmonitor a system intended to ensure that efficient, high quality legal representation is provided to\ncriminal defendants in the state (and others) who are determined to be indigent or partially indigent.\nOverview of MCILS\nEstablishment of MCILS and organizational structure \nMCILS was established as an independent commission in 2009. Prior to its establishment, indigent\nlegal services were administered by and funded\nthrough the Judicial Branch. MCILS assumed The purpose of MCILS is to provide\nefficient, high-quality\nresponsibility for providing indigent legal services on\nrepresentation to indigent criminal\nJuly 1, 2010. The Commission is made up of nine\ndefendants, juvenile defendants,\nmembers (currently one vacancy), and is supported\nand children and families in child\nby an office staff of four, who administer the day-to- protective cases - 4 MRSA §1801.\nday operations of the agency. As stated in 4 MRSA\n§1801, the purpose of MCILS is to provide efficient, high-quality representation to indigent criminal\ndefendants, juvenile defendants, and children and families in child protective cases. Indigent\ndefendants are those without sufficient means to retain the services of competent counsel. This\nrepresentation is provided in accordance with requirements established in statute and in both the\nConstitution of the United States and the Constitution of Maine. Statute requires that the\nCommission work to ensure the delivery of indigent legal services by qualified and competent\ncounsel in a manner that is fair and consistent throughout the state and to ensure adequate funding\nof a statewide system of indigent legal services, which must be provided and managed in a fiscally\nresponsible manner.\nIn 2018, a change to 4 MRSA §1803 increased the number of members appointed to serve on the\nCommission from five to nine. Statute provides for certain representation on the Commission,\nincluding; one member with experience in administration and finance, one member with experience\nin child protection proceedings, and two members (non-voting) who are practicing attorneys\nproviding indigent legal services.\nAs currently structured, MCILS agency staff includes an Executive Director, Deputy Executive\nDirector, Accounting Technician, and an Office Associate, working in an office in Augusta; eight\nfinancial screening staff, who work at various courthouses across the state; and one investigator,\nwho works part-time and remotely. The Office Associate position was vacant for over two years due\nto a hiring freeze — it was filled in June 2019.\nFor fiscal year 2020, the Legislature appropriated approximately $17.7 million for MCILS and $17.6\nmillion for fiscal year 2021.\nRepresentation for indigent or partially indigent\nIn Maine, representation for those who have been determined indigent, or partially indigent, is\nprovided by attorneys in private practice, rather than state-employed public defense attorneys. The\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 2\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nCourt assigns representation to a person by selecting an attorney from rosters maintained by\nMCILS, which are separated by region. In order to be listed on a roster, attorneys must have met\nbasic requirements, along with certain ongoing requirements, such as continuing education. There\nare separate rosters for attorneys who provide specific types of services, or have a defense specialty,\nincluding homicide, sexual offenses, operating under the influence, domestic violence, serious\nviolent felonies, and juvenile felony cases.\nA client's status as indigent or partially indigent is determined by a judge based on financial\ninformation provided by the person requiring and seeking representation. At some court locations,\na financial screener may be available to collect information to be considered as part of that judicial\ndetermination. The screener meets with the defendant, gathers financial information, including the\ndefendant's assets, income, and expenses and uses this information to provide a recommendation to\nthe judge. The judge may determine that the person is indigent or partially indigent, in which case a\nrostered attorney will be assigned. A person determined partially indigent will receive an order to\nmake payments making up a portion of the assigned attorney's fees.\nAttorney and non-counsel payments \nA primary function of MCILS is to arrange for the\nA primary function of MCILS is to\npayment of counsel fees and expenses to attorneys who arrange for the payment of counsel\nhave been assigned to represent indigent or partially fees and expenses to attorneys\nindigent clients.

The Executive\nDirector and Deputy Executive Director review these vouchers and approve attorney payments. The\nhourly rate for attorneys is currently $60, with maximum fee caps per type of case. Any services\nprovided by vendors hired by the attorney, such as investigators, interpreters, and medical and\npsychological experts, are to be pre-approved by either the Executive Director or Deputy Executive\nDirector. The vendor sends an invoice to the attorney, who verifies satisfactory completion of that\nwork and then the invoice is submitted to the agency for processing. MCILS staff makes payment\ndirectly to the vendor.\nUntil June 30, 2019, an alternate method to pay for legal services was facilitated by MCILS in the\nform of a single, fixed-fee contract in Somerset County. MCILS contracted with three private\nattorneys to provide indigent legal services, paying the attorneys a fixed monthly rate. Additionally,\nthe attorneys were reimbursed for case related expenses, such as investigators and expert witnesses.\nThis contract was not renewed and currently MCILS is not using this alternate method to pay for\nlegal services.\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 3\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nPart II. Systems and Procedures Used by MCILS Staff to\nProcess Payments and Expenditures Associated with\nProviding Legal Representation\nAre the systems and procedures used by MCILS to process payments and\nexpenditures associated with providing legal representation adequate?\nOPEGA was tasked with determining the adequacy of systems and procedures used by MCILS staff\nto process payments and expenditures associated with providing legal representation to clients who\nhave been determined to be indigent or partially indigent. In this section, we identify several issues\nwith the systems and procedures used by the agency to process attorney and non-attorney payments.\n• There are no established policies and procedures governing expenditures and\npayments - and MCILS expectations for billing practices may not be effectively\ncommunicated to attorneys.\n• Data available to MCILS staff via Defender Data is unreliable and potentially\nmisleading.\n• Current monitoring efforts of attorney vouchers are inefficient and of limited\neffectiveness.\n• Invoice-level review of non-counsel invoices may be of limited effectiveness in\nidentifying certain types of noncompliance.\n• Audit or review procedures have not been established and current audit efforts used\nby MCILS are limited, inconsistent, and of limited scope, depth and effectiveness.\nSome of these issues associated with the agency's financial procedures appear to be linked to our\nassessment of the MCILS oversight structure discussed in Part III, where we describe the\ninterconnectedness of inadequate agency staffing and poor functioning of the Commission. Had the\nagency been appropriately staffed and the Commission been more functional, it is possible that\nsome of these financial procedure issues may have been mitigated. OPEGA notes, however, that\ndue to the prioritization of the two questions (financial procedures and oversight structure), we did\nnot conduct a full review including all of the evaluation scope areas outlined in the GOC's original\nproject direction statement. Thus, OPEGA did not fully establish the root cause for all identified\nissues. Nonetheless, there appears to be a link between the poorly functioning organizational\noversight structure, inadequate staffing, and inadequate financial procedures.\nOne of the primary drivers for this review were the issues noted in a report issued by the Sixth\nAmendment Center (6AC) in April 2019. Of particular concern were the number of annual hours\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 4\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nbilled by rostered attorneys and MCILS's ability to identify such occurrences—which were later\nreported by the media as potential examples of overbilling and/or fraud. Appendix C of this report\nincludes a comparison of the previously reported attorney billing analysis conducted by the 6AC to\nan analysis conducted by OPEGA, using data we independently obtained directly from the billing\nservice provider. As described in the Appendix, the magnitude of the 6AC's finding appears to be\noverstated. However, the underlying issues—attorneys billing for large amounts of hours annually\nand MCILS's ability to identify when that happens—remain valid. These issues are explored in this\nPart and are discussed in detail in Issue 3.\nIssue 1.T here are no established policies and procedures governing expenditures and\npayments and - MCILS's expectations for billing practices may not be effectively\ncommunicated to attorneys.\nThe system used by MCILS staff to govern billing practices by rostered attorneys, and to guide the\nagency's approval of payments,i s limited. Necessary policies and procedures that would outline\nexpectations for attorneys submitting vouchers are sparse and are not in written form or otherwise\ncodified. Of greater concern, the few standards that do exist in writing -the (established) fee\nschedule in agency rules which outline allowable and covered expenses -may not be effectively\ncommunicated to attorneys. A process, or system, reliant upon unwritten standards which are not\nwidely communicated to attorneys—when agency review of payment submissions is governed by\nthose standards—is one of potentially limited effectiveness.\nAmong the sparse procedures, OPEGA did observe some standards developed by the Executive\nDirector and Deputy Executive Director, for their use in approving certain work event entries on\nattorney vouchers—procedures which they describe as \"informal.\" Specifically, these unwritten\nstandards guide staffs treatment of attorney voucher entries billing for the attorney's time spent on\ncommon, or generic, work activities. These standards include maximums for events, like opening a\nfile — which is subject to a limit of. 5 of one hour (the system records time in tenths of an hour). If\nan attorney submits a voucher that includes an entry for opening a file exceeding that amount of\ntime, and the attorney provided no note to explain the duration of time taken to complete that\nactivity, MCILS staff would presumably reject, or question, that entry on the voucher. It is important\nto note again that these billing standards are not\nVoucher-level review conducted\nestablished as policies and are otherwise unwritten.\nby MCILS staff relies on\nBased on the frequency with which OPEGA noted information entered into Defender\nnonconformity with these informal standards, it also Data by attorneys who are\nappears that these standards may not be communicated provided only sparse, informal\nguidance on billing standards.\neffectively to rostered attorneys.\nA fee schedule, governing payments to assigned counsel, written and formally established in agency\nrules (94-649 Chapter 301), states the hourly rate paid to attorneys (currently $60) and outlines\nwhich services are to be billed under that rate. The rules state that \"routine office expenses are\nconsidered to be included in the hourly rate.\" Among the routine office expenses defined in the fee\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 5\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nschedule are office overhead, utilities, and secretarial services. MCILS staff has interpreted secretarial\nservices to include most paralegal services'. In other words, if an attorney worked for 10 hours on a\nparticular case and a paralegal also provided 2 hours of -work in support, the attorney is only\nauthorized to be paid for 10 hours of work (not twelve) in accordance with MCILS's stated\ninterpretation of the rule. However, we identified multiple instances indicating a voucher was\nsubmitted billing for hours which included paralegal (or other non-counsel) time. This is important\nbecause that time, if approved, is paid at the attorney's hourly rate. While we do not know the extent\nto which this occurs, one attorney's perspective' indicated that the practice was common:\nIn .speaking with a myriad of other MCILS rostered attorneys who also employ paralegals, it is\nclear we track ourp aralegals' time in similarf ashion as others doing this work do. The general\nconsensus seems to be thatp aralegal timef or tasks that attorneys normally do, but a paralegal\nactually does the work in their stead, is billed under the attorney working on the case. Without\nexception, the six attorneys I spoke with unequivocally stated the time is captured and submitted\nwith MCILS vouchers.\nAs a result of the agency's lack of policies and procedures and limited communication of( informal,\nunwritten) billing standards, MCILS-rostered attorneys may not have an awareness, or an\nunderstanding, of what is expected of them, or what expenses are covered and allowable. Thus,\nthese attorneys may be billing MCILS incorrectly. Monitoring efforts to detect and correct instances\nof incorrect attorney billings fall on MCILS However, as discussed on page 8/Issue 3, issues with\nexisting monitoring efforts implemented by MCILS make detection difficult.\nAdditionally, OPEGA notes that the absence of policies and procedures to govern expenditures and\npayments may have the potential to financially impact those who have been deemed partially\nindigent. Because partially indigent clients are ordered to contribute to counsel costs (up to the\nvoucher cap), incorrect billings may change the actual amount the client is obligated to pay. MCILS\nstaff has agreed that this situation is possible, but noted that it was probably a rare occurrence.\nFurther, MCILS staff told us that such a situation would be potentially difficult to reconcile, and that\nthey have no mechanism in place to check and correct this, if it does occur.\n> Formal policies and procedures should be established by MCILS management to better define\nallowable and covered expenses. These policies and procedures would clarify expectations for\nbilling and invoicing practices that if proactively communicated, would improve the effectiveness of\nthe system to approve expenditures and process payments to rostered attorneys and non-counsel\nservice providers.\n2 MCILS does allow for some paralegal services to be reimbursed at their own, lower rate in murder cases, but this is\nsubject to preapproval and is to be separately invoiced and not billed through Defender Data.\n3 Letter from rostered attorney to MCILS Executive Director.\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 6\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nIssue 2. Data available to MCILS staff via Defender Data is unreliable and potentially\nmisleading.\nWith the lack of established and available policies and procedures to educate and guide attorneys\ntowards compliance with MCILS's desired timekeeping and attorney voucher submission practices,\nthe responsibility for ensuring the accuracy of billing entries and identifying instances of\nnoncompliance, rests almost entirely upon agency staff. MCILS's Executive Director and Deputy\nExecutive Director attempt to fulfill this responsibility primarily through their review of work events\nlisted on attorney vouchers. During this review by agency staff, particular attention is paid to the\nduration of each event (such as phone conferences with clients, reviewing files, composing\ncorrespondence, etc.) and any notes associated with an event, or attached to the voucher generally,\nto explain the billed entries. Using the attorney voucher data OPEGA obtained, we reviewed these\nnotes, as well as attorney responses to MCILS staff notifications (communicated via Defender Data\nsystem) that the attorney may have exceeded some limit or billed incorrectly. In this review,\nOPEGA noted multiple scenarios when the effectiveness and efficiency of MCILS's current review\nsystem (which triggers the notifications to attorneys) is\nimpeded because of the quality and accuracy of the data in the The quality and accuracy of the\ndata impedes the effectiveness\nDefender Data system, which they rely upon. The quality and\nand efficiency of the agency's\naccuracy of the data are unreliable and potentially misleading.\ncurrent system of attorney\nOPEGA found that entries made by attorneys into the\nvoucher review.\nDefender Data System:\n• captured or entered the hours of multiple attorneys under one attorney;\n• batched multiple small work events into one large single-event entry;\n• captured and entered work hours on the wrong date; and\n• captured and entered the work hours of staff—particularly paralegals—under an attorney.\nThese scenarios all increase the amount of time recorded for a single, discrete entry.  With the\nexception of incorrectly capturing and entering the work hours of staff (i.e. paralegal hours entered\nas attorney hours), the entirety of the aggregated time in these scenarios may reflect time\nappropriately spent on a case which would be otherwise allowable and billable to MCILS. However,\ndue to the lack of consistency in how attorneys record time events and the prevalence of data entry\nerrors, these scenarios may generate false-alarms requiring follow-up action from both MCILS staff\nand response from the billing attorney.\nAdditionally, the quality and accuracy of the data limits the potential effectiveness of any future,\nhigh-level, data analysis to potentially identify and flag outlying values. Such analysis may identify\nlengthy durations for particular work events, or days, or billings from one attorney that are\ninconsistent with those of attorneys performing similar work.\nOPEGA also observed that when MCILS does identify and correct an incorrect value, only the\nvoucher total is changed,l eaving the incorrect value for the work event entry to remain in the data\nset. These incorrect values hinder the establishment of any baseline metrics, or standards, that could\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 7\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nbe used to identify questionable attorney billings and any subsequent, overarching data analysis.\nFurther, the incorrect values could also potentially hinder the use of more efficient techniques for\nreview and audit by MCILS and by the Defender Data system itself. (See Issue 5).\nIt is important to note that these issues with the quality and accuracy of the data had an impact on\nthe data analysis OPEGA performed for this review, and will ultimately limit our ability to identify\nspecific attorneys for further audit work.( See page 21).\n(cid:226)  The quality of available data in terms of consistency, accuracy, and reliability could be improved in\nseveral ways if the agency undertakes the following interrelated initiatives:\n• Establish and communicate expectations and guidance outlining how time events are to be\nrecorded in Defender Data to improve the consistency of the data;\n• work with Justice Works to develop data-entry controls that reflect newly-established\nexpectations and provide guidance to correct potential data issues, or errors, when they\noccur; and\n• correct data errors within Defender Data at the time they are identified to improve the\nreliability of the data when used for data analysis or risk-based auditing.\nIssue H. Current efforts to monitor attorney vouchers are inefficient and of limited\neffectiveness.\nThere are multiple elements comprising the attorney voucher review process currently used by\nMCILS staff. Below, OPEGA identifies issues within those elements of the voucher review process\nwhich have the effect of limiting its overall efficiency and effectiveness.\nEvent-Level Voucher Review, Generally\nEvent-level voucher review has been described as\nEvent-level voucher entries are\nrepresenting a significant portion of both the MCILS individual entries on a voucher\nExecutive Director and Deputy Executive Director's reporting time spent by an attorney\ndaily work hours. This time-consuming effort on a case-related activity\n(reviewing discovery, preparing\npurportedly involves manual review of all event-level\nemail, phone conversation).\nentries on each attorney voucher (typically one per\ncase). Event-level entries, typically reported in tenths of an hour, include things like: reviewing\ndiscovery; preparing email; and phone correspondence. Even accounting for the number of\nrelatively simple vouchers submitted by attorneys billing for serving as lawyer of the day, or resource\ncounsel',( 14.4% of total vouchers), event-level voucher review appears to be a significant amount of\nwork. The average annual number of vouchers paid by the agency from FY10 through FY19 was\njust over 28,000, containing roughly 450,000 individual events to be reviewed.\n4 Mentoring, supervision and evaluation of private assigned counsel providing indigent legal services is described in further\ndetail on page 28.\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 8\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nThis large number of vouchers (and events) reviewed calls into question, both the amount of staff\ntime available for this work and the thoroughness of the review conducted by staff. OPEGA\nanalyzed the number of vouchers approved by a single staff member in a day over this period. We\nfound that in 36.7% of the days in which a staff member\nOn almost 37% of the days in which\nwas approving vouchers, over 100 vouchers were\na staff person was approving\napproved — allowing less than four minutes and forty-\nvouchers, they reviewed more than\n100 vouchers — allowing less than 5 eight seconds to review each voucher'. Table 1 lists\nminutes to review each voucher. several ranges of approvals completed by a single\napprover in one day, from 100 or less to 601 or more,\nand indicates how many times (days) approvals within each range occurred. Table 2 provides time\nper voucher reference points to better illustrate the time potentially available in a day for a single\nreviewer to review and approve various numbers of vouchers. Of particular interest were the eleven\ndays from FY10 through FY19 in which an approver approved more than 400 vouchers in a day.\nThose occasions, however, as explained by the agency and preliminarily confirmed by OPEGA,\nwere largely due to the availability of funds and do not accurately reflect time spent reviewing and\napproving those vouchers. On these occasions, the vouchers were reviewed and would have\notherwise been approved and paid if funding were available at the time. Instead, the approved\nvouchers accumulated pending an appropriation and then later were approved simultaneously when\nthe funds became available.\nTable 1: Number of Vouchers Approved by Single Approver In a Day\nNumber of Vouchers Approved Number of Days Percent of Total\n601 or more 4 0.1%\n501 to 600 5 0.2%\n401 to 500 2 0.1%\n301 to 400 15 0.5%\n201 to 300 185 5.6%\n101 to 200 1,010 30.4%\n100 or less 2,103 63.3%\nTotal 3,324 100.0%\nSource: OPEGA analysis of MCILS voucher data obtained from Justice Works.\nTable 2: Single Approver Time Per Voucher Reference Points\nNumber of Vouchers Time Per Voucher*\n600 48s\n500 58s\n400 lm 12s\n300 1m 36s\n200 2m 24s\n100 4m 48s\n*Assuming an entire, eight-hour, work day spent only reviewing and approving vouchers.\n5 Based on a full, eight-hour, work day spent only reviewing and approving vouchers.\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 9\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nDefender Data Entries and Identifying Outlying Values \nDespite the large number of vouchers and the significant staff burden associated with voucher\nreview, neither the agency, nor the Defender Data system itself, appear to make effective use of\ntechnology for preventive controls against data entry errors. We noted that Defender Data will\ngenerate a flag alerting a billing attorney when an entry exceeds an established maximum voucher fee\nby case type (such as $3,000 for Class A crime) and then prompt a potential correction and/or\naddition of a note prior to final submission of the attorney voucher. However, we observed no other\ndata entry controls preventing, or limiting, the input of values (particularly durations of events).\nAlthough the agency has some informal maximums (.5 of an hour for opening a file) and some\nvalues that, if included on a voucher would be considered questionable, the Defender Data system is\nnot being utilized as a control by rejecting those entries or generating a flag prompting staff to\nfollow up.\nOur analysis of data from 2010 - 2019 found nearly 110,000 outlying values' across eight selected\ntypes of timekeeping events (such as opening or closing a file) with some appearing far beyond\nreason (such as 30 hours to prepare an email or a 20-hour phone call with a client). Most of the\nidentified outlying values (81.4%) were either:\n• flagged by MCILS and later corrected by the attorney;\n• explained in the system by a note added to the timekeeping event entry;\n• explained in the system by a note or by one attached to the voucher; or\n• addressed using a voucher override by the Executive Director or Deputy Executive\nDirector.\nAlthough ultimately addressed, these outliers necessitated a member of MCILS staff to review and\nquestion the entry and, as needed, follow-up with the billing attorney. Data entry controls in the\nDefender Data system, such as preventing the attorney from entering a value that exceeds a\nmaximum fee, or generating a flag when a reasonable value is exceeded, could reduce the amount of\nstaff resources required to address such issues.\nMonitoring High Annual and Daily Hours Worked\nIn general, event-level review of each voucher does not\nMCILS staff's system of voucher\nprovide MCILS with the information necessary to monitor\nreview does not monitor\ncumulative annual hours worked by an attorney, and, until\ncumulative annual hours\nrecorded as worked by an recently, did not allow for any monitoring of the daily hours\nattorney. worked by attorneys facilitating identification of rostered\nattorneys working potentially problematically high numbers\nof hours on a given day.

Most concerning were the 224 attorney and date combinations in which more\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 11\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nthan 24 hours were billed in one day; these 224 instances ranged from 24.1 to 84.2 hours. Roughly\n70% of these instances were recorded by six attorneys, as shown in Table 5.\nTable 5: Attorneys with highest counts of billing more than 24-hour days\nWork Attorney Count of 24+ Hour Days\nAttorney G 41\nAttorney B 32\nAttorney A 27\nAttorney E 25\nAttorney D 19\nAttorney F 13\nSource: OPEGA analysis of MCILS voucher data obtained from Justice\nWorks.\n12-Hour Alert Notification System \nDuring the time period that the 6AC evaluated MCILS, the agency conducted its own internal\ninvestigations of high billing by attorneys. The Executive Director reviewed the billings by attorneys\nwith over $150,000 in billings in any of the previous three fiscal years (FY16, FY17, FY18). [This\ninvestigation is described in detail on pages 18 through 20.\nThe agency's 12-hour alert\nLimitations with this investigation and other similar efforts\nnotification system is an ineffective\nare detailed in Issue 5.] Following this work, the Executive\ncontrol to address potential\nDirector instituted a 12-hour alert notification system. overbilling.\nUnder this notification system, as attorneys submit\nvouchers for cases (generally upon conclusion of the case), Defender Data tracks the hours billed on\na daily basis. When one or more submitted vouchers show an individual attorney billing more than\n12 hours on a given day, the system generates an alert email that is sent to both the attorney and\nMCILS staff. These alerts are entered into and tracked using, what the agency refers to as its \"High\nDaily Hours Tracking\" spreadsheet.\nOPEGA reviewed this spreadsheet and found this monitoring tool to be an ineffective control, and\nthe process used to track alerts, to be inefficient for a number of reasons.\n• The alert is generated independently of voucher approvals within Defender Data, which\nmeans that attorneys are paid as usual before the attorney responds to the notification, or\neven if the attorney never responds.\n• The alert system creates a flag for, but does not correct, potential issues. The alert may be\ngenerated years after the date on which the 12-hour threshold was reached, because attorney\nvouchers are primarily submitted when a case concludes which could be months, or years,\nafter the start of the case. We observed some 12-hour alerts dating back to 12/4/2017,\nwhich could prove difficult for attorneys and/or MCILS to accurately reconcile.\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 12\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\n• The responsiveness by attorneys to the alert notifications was poor. Of the 1,285 rows in the\nHigh Daily Hours Tracking spreadsheet containing at least one day with a 12-hour alert,\n70.6% (907) showed no attorney response'.\n• The 12-hour threshold may be too low and not focused enough on true outliers or\nexceptions, as 12-hour days are not atypical for the profession. Of the 378 responses from\nattorneys in the spreadsheet, 131 (34.7%) indicated the hours were accurate - or the\nexplanation provided by the attorney was accepted by the Executive Director. This process\nrequired follow-up and attention from both the attorney and MCILS. Common explanations\noffered by attorneys included the following:\n• The time was accurate, as attorneys either had lengthy days during the normal\ncourse of business or were trying to get caught up before, or after, a vacation or\nholiday.\n• The time was accurate, as the attorney was a rural practitioner which necessitates\na lot of travel time.\nOther frequently noted explanations do not appear to be consistent with agency rules or\ndesired billing practices:\n• More than one attorney's time was captured under one attorney's billing (the\ntime worked was otherwise accurate).\n• Additional staff hours—such as a paralegal's time—were billed as the attorney's\nhours (even though this appears to be inconsistent with policy — see pages. 5-6).\nAnother 70 (18.5%) of the 378 attorney responses indicated that the work was done, but\nentered on the wrong date.\n• In terms of impact in dollars, the figure populating the \"Amount Overbilled\" column of the\nspreadsheet totals only about $6,400. However,i n terms of the value, or effectiveness of the\n12-hour flag as control, we note that this number ($6,400) is likely understated because in\nsome cases attorneys can change the amount before the voucher is billed.\nIdentification of Double Billing\nDespite the general lack of relevant responses to the Executive Director's investigation into high\nbilling attorneys and the agency's general lack of follow-up (issues with audit and investigation\nprocesses are noted in Issue 5), one attorney's responses were useful in illustrating how double\nbilling can occur. Double billing is unlikely to be identified through MCILS's current attorney\nvoucher review process, and, in this attorney's case, was not.\n7 The Executive Director reported that while there are a large number of attorney non-responses, the number is lower than\nOPEGA's figure, as MCILS has not yet entered some attorney responses into the spreadsheet.\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 13\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nAs illustrated in the following bulleted examples, double\nDouble billing — more than one\nbilling is any scenario in which MCILS is paying for the\nrequest by an attorney for payment\nsame time twice. Our review of the attorney responses to for the same time — is unlikely to be\nthe Executive Director's investigation into high billing identified through the current\nattorneys and the results of the attorney's self-audit voucher-level review system.\nrevealed three such scenarios. It also revealed concerns\nrelated to the agency's ability to identify double billing relying on the current system of voucher level\nreview:\n• Duplicate time entries—or the entering of the same work event more than once in Defender\nData—can occur when more than one person (such as the attorney, office manager, and/or\nadministrative assistant) all enter events into Defender Data, resulting in some overlap. For\nmany work events, such as reviewing an email, or a phone call with a client, these instances\nare unlikely to be identified, flagged, and/or questioned by MCILS due to their routine\nnature. As observed by OPEGA in the attorney responses and the one attorney self-audit,\nonly the attorney could accurately identify such instances.\n• Overlapping time entries—or being paid for two different work events at the exact same\ntime—can also occur under MCILS's current framework for the recording, buffing, and\napproval for payment of attorney hours. Generally, attorneys submit a voucher containing all\nof the hours worked over the duration of a case at the conclusion of the case for MCILS\napproving payment. As work events are submitted at the voucher (or case) level—rather\nthan an hourly accounting of time at the end of a day or week (like a traditional timecard)—\nit is difficult to identify when an attorney attributed the same exact hour(s) to two or more\ncases, and received payment for all. Reporting time at a voucher level either obscures or\ncompletely ignores the reality that attorneys may perform other, unrelated work events\nduring lulls in other certain work events. Reporting this time accurately to avoid double\nbilling requires adjustments to entries by attorneys, or their staff. For example, an attorney\nserving as lawyer of the day is paid for the entirety of their time spent at the courthouse with\ndefendants, but during downtimes in the court throughout the day, the attorney may work\non other indigent legal cases by emailing clients or reviewing case materials. Similarly, an\nattorney may be travelling for one client—which is billable time—but may be having phone\nconversations with other clients during that travel time, which is also a billable activity. If all\nof these events are recorded and entered without adjustment by either the attorney or\nattorney's staff, they will have been paid twice for their time. If the hours worked on a given\nday do not exceed 12 hours, the opportunity to observe these overlapping events and catch\nthese occurrences will be very limited given the current system in place to record and bill for\nattorney hours and their subsequent review by MCILS for approval and payment.\n• Over-allocation of time spent in court or travelling—or an attorney travelling to and being\npresent in court for multiple cases, but billing the entirety (and not a portion) of that time to\neach of those cases—may be a less common occurrence than other examples of double\nbilling. Regardless, these occurrences are at risk of being undetected by MCILS In our\nreview of attorney responses to MCILS,a n over-allocation of time spent in court was\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 14\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\ndemonstrated by one particular attorney. In this instance, the attorney spent the day in court\nfor multiple cases and sought to allocate their time by dividing the number of hours spent in\ncourt by the number of cases. However, some cases may be continued for a variety of\nreasons, and, as such, require only minutes of the attorney's time. In those cases, the\nattorney chose to not allocate the day's court time and removed them from the total cases\nfor the day. For example, the attorney spent eight hours in court with 12 cases scheduled,\nbut four were continued for various reasons. The attorney would then allocate their time to\nthe eight remaining cases, resulting in one billable hour for each case. As explained in the\nattorney response, however, the attorney's staff would apply the hour per case to all 12 cases\nwhen entering vouchers in Defender Data. Thus, an eight-hour court day was turned into\n12 billable hours. Again, while we have not confirmed the scope, or extent, to which this\nmay occur, it appears as though if this scenario was known, it could be addressed in the near\nfuture—hence, its inclusion here.\nAchieving Cost Savings — Financial Stewardship \nLastly, over the course of its broader, attorney voucher review in Defender Data, the agency's\nefforts have resulted in relatively few instances in which MCILS staff has manually adjusted a\nvoucher total in response to an identified issue. We found only 1.1% of vouchers had totals\noverridden by staff, which represented an even smaller percentage-0.3% of total voucher\nexpenditures. From FY10 to FY19, annual savings directly resulting from MCILS voucher overrides\naveraged just under $36,000—although this number does not capture voucher entries that are\nquestioned by MCILS and later reduced by the submitting attorney. The average annual totals for\nvoucher expenditures were roughly $13.5 million during that time. To whatever extent vouchers are\nbeing reviewed by staff, the process appears to be of limited effectiveness—particularly when\nviewed in light of the financial impact/realized savings.\n(cid:226)  Assuming improvements are made to the overall quality of MCILS's attorney voucher data, the\nagency should reevaluate its process for reviewing attorney vouchers with the objective of improving\nboth effectiveness and efficiency. At a minimum, the following process attributes should be\nconsidered by MCILS in reevaluating and potentially redesigning its attorney voucher review\nprocess.\n• The process should identify, investigate and, as necessary, address the types of instances with\nthe greatest potential impacts to financial stewardship and the quality of representation—\nhigh daily and annual hours worked by attorney.\n• The process should utilize technology to identify and correct potential data entry errors\nwhen they occur, such as flagging the input of values in excess of established limits, instead\nof relying on manual review of vouchers to identify potential errors.\n• The process should incorporate data and risk-based audit techniques to the greatest extent\npossible to potentially reduce the burden placed on the Executive Director and Deputy\nExecutive Director by the manual review of vouchers—allowing them to focus on other\nimportant, but neglected, aspects of MCILS's purpose as discussed in Part III.\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 15\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nAdditionally, we note that transitioning from a voucher-based payment system to a timecard-based\npayment system may address issues related to the timeliness and accuracy of daily hours worked. In\nthe current voucher-based system, work events occur over the life of a case—which may last\nyears—and are submitted at the conclusion of the case. Issues with billing errors may not be\nidentified until well after the work events occur. Based on OPEGA's review of the data, it appears\neasy for attorneys to lose track of how many hours they worked/billed on a given day under such\ncircumstances. Processing payments using a timecard-based system would require attorneys to log\ntheir daily work events and submit them for approval on a regular basis (such as every two weeks).\nAs such, data entry would occur closer to the actual work events, putting MCILS staff in a better\nposition to identify when high daily work hours occur and allow attorneys to see any potential\nduplicate or otherwise incorrect entries which could be addressed at that time.\nIssue 4. Invoice-level review of non-counsel invoices may be of limited effectiveness in\nidentifying certain types of noncompliance.\nAlthough total annual non-counsel service provider invoices are far smaller than attorney vouchers,\nboth in terms of counts and total dollars, OPEGA explored areas of risk associated with this type of\nexpenditure. Through this work, we found that neither MCILS's process for the review and\napproval of non-counsel invoices, nor the data generated\nMCILS staff's system of individual from the entry of necessary information from these\nvendor invoice review (for non-\ninvoices into Advantage (the State's accounting and\ncounsel services) is unlikely to\nvendor-payment system) for payment processing is\nidentify duplicate charges, high daily\neffective in identifying certain types of non-compliance.\nbilling or duplicate invoices.\nNon-counsel service provider invoices are first reviewed\nindividually by MCILS's Accounting Technician for compliance with established rates,\nreimbursement limits, agency pre-approvals, and the accuracy of invoice calculations prior to\napproval by the MCILS Executive Director. Upon approval, a limited amount of information from\neach invoice—essentially just the information required for processing and payment through\nAdvantage—is entered into the system.\nAs MCILS reviews and processes each non-counsel invoice individually, staff are unlikely to identify\npotential billing issues that span more than one invoice. For example, a non-counsel service provider\n(such as a private investigator) may be working on multiple cases for multiple attorneys, and,\naccordingly, submit multiple invoices—none of which raise any issues when reviewed individually.\nHowever, when reviewed together, the invoices may reflect potential issues such as daily billed hours\nthat are exceedingly high or exceed 24 hours in a given day. Similarly, the data contained within\nAdvantage is limited to only what is required for the State's accounting system. This data lacks key\nelements that would be critical to performing any vendor analysis across multiple invoices: detailed\nservice descriptions, dates of those detailed services, who performed the detailed services, and for\nwhich case the services were provided. Together, MCILS's review process and the data available via\nAdvantage are of limited effectiveness in identifying instances of high-daily billing hours (a similar\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 16\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nconcern to that of attorneys), duplicate charges (the same charge or service appearing on multiple\ninvoices), or duplicate billings (the submission and payment of the same invoice more than once).\nTo best determine whether these scenarios are occurring, OPEGA accessed the available data from\nAdvantage to develop a universe of invoices paid by MCILS. Although we were limited by the\ndetails of the data, we performed some high-level data analysis which enabled us to select a\njudgmental sample of 235 invoices (roughly 1.5% of the total paid invoices) to review for the\nconcerns noted above (and others).\nIn our review of a series of invoices spanning just over three months from a frequently used\nvendor—which appears to be a sole proprietorship with no other employees—we observed billing\nfor a high number of hours on several days across multiple invoices. These potential red-flags are\npresented in Table 6.\nTable 6: Instances of billingfor a high number of hours across multiple invoices\nby one vendor\nNumber of Hours\nDate Billed Number of Invoices\n7/14/2017 19 5\n7/17/2017 18 6\n8/25/2017 19 4\n9/4/2017 16 4\nSource: OPEGA analysis of MCILS vendor invoices obtained from Fortis.\nIt should be noted that MCILS did describe a one-time audit of private investigation services\ninvoices that identified similar concerns related to high daily billing hours. Vendors were asked to\nprovide contemporaneous time records for dates with high billing hours. An outcome of the audit\nwas that one vendor did not provide sufficient records and is no longer approved for MCILS-paid\nprivate investigation services. Despite the fact that this one-time audit by the agency identified issues\nthat merited such action to be taken, similar reviews such as the one conducted have not been\nformalized or become part of the agency's regular review and monitoring of other non-counsel\ninvoices. (See appendix D for additional results of OPEGA's review of non-counsel invoices.)\n(cid:226)  Development of a broader audit/review procedure for non-counsel invoices and periodic use of a\nrisk-based method to select and review invoices would allow the agency to identify and correct\ninstances of inappropriate high daily billings, duplicate charges, duplicate payments, and potentially,\nother instances of noncompliance.\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 17\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nIssue 5. Defined policies and procedures for audit and investigation have not been\nestablished. Current methods used by MCILS are limited, inconsistent, and also of limited\nscope, depth and effectiveness.\nAs previously noted, MCILS lacks established policies and procedures governing the processing of\nvouchers, invoices, and expenditures. Similarly, the agency lacks defined policies and procedures for\nconducting audits and investigations of attorneys.\nHowever, OPEGA did review three instances we were made aware of in which MCILS staff\nconducted an audit or investigation:\n• A one-time review of private investigation services invoices;\n• a review of one attorney's discovery materials to reconcile the volume of those materials\nwith the hours billed for reviewing discovery; and\n• an investigation into nine attorneys selected from the 6AC's reported highest billing\nattorneys.\nFor the last investigation listed above, OPEGA was able to assess the agency's procedures for audits\nand investigations which we describe as ad-hoc. We did this by accessing and reviewing the\nfollowing materials:\n• data provided by MCILS to the 6AC;\n• data obtained by MCILS staff from its vendor and the subsequent data analysis they\nperformed; and\n• agency correspondence with two individual attorneys and correspondence to and from one\nfirm (containing 3 of the 9 selected attorneys).\nThis investigation by the agency into the highest billing attorneys was limited to those 9 attorneys\nwith over $150,000 in billings in any of the three fiscal years (FY16, FY17, and FY18)8. OPEGA\nfound the scope of this internal agency investigation too limited to effectively identify the extent to\nwhich the issues raised by the 6AC8 were occurring. For reference, the 6AC's evaluation covered all\nattorneys and spanned five years. OPEGA's own work for this report covered all attorneys spanning\na period ten years—the entirety of MCILS's existence as an independent agency. The small data set\nused by MCILS limits the agency's opportunities to identify—and most importantly, correct,\npotentially problematic caseloads and/or billing practices of attorneys.\nAs a result of the agency's analysis on the high billing attorney data, the Executive Director wrote\nthree letters: two to sole practitioners and one to a firm at which three of the high billing attorneys\n8 Ten attorneys were originally selected, with one of the ten excluded from further work, as the MCILS Executive Director\nhad previously agreed to allow the submission and payment of many outstanding bills in a recent year from that attorney.\n9 The 6AC Report issued the following finding in regards to billing practices: \"Finding 8: A significant number of attorneys bill\nin excess of eight hours per day, five days per week,f or 52 weeks per year. MCILS does not exert adequate financial\noversight of private attorneys.\"\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 18\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nworked. The letter informed the recipients that they were among the system's highest earners and\nprovided the attorneys with their annual hours and high daily hours worked from the agency's\nrecords for reference. The Executive Director's letter also made the following request:\nPleasef orward copies ofa ny contemporaneous time records thatyou maintained outside oft he\nDefender Data systemf or each day where total billing exceeded 16 hours. In addition, please\nprovide any explanation you may havef or the unrealistic billing totals and note that voucherI D\nand event information isp rovidedf or each oft hese daysf or assistance in identifying data errors, if\nany.\nAttorneys contacted as a result of We observed that the Executive Director received three\nan internal agency investigation very different responses that varied in the extent to which\ninto high billing provided various\nthey responded to the original request. The following\nexplanations — none of which\nresponses to that request from the attorneys are\nwere challenged by MCILS staff.\nintentionally described at a rather high-level in order to\nmaintain confidentiality consistent with the manner in which MCILS treats investigative records:\nResponse 1:\n• Respondent acknowledged billing errors related to dates billed, but did not believe bills were\nsubmitted for work that was not performed.\n• Respondent stated steps were being taken to decrease the respondent's caseload and to\nimplement a better record keeping system.\n• Respondent did not provide contemporaneous time records.\nResponse 2:\n• Respondent stated steps were being taken to decrease the respondent's caseload and to\nimplement a better record keeping system.\n• Respondent reported reviewing approximately 4,000 events (those provided by MCILS) and\nprovided information (added a column to spreadsheet) to record correct event times. This\nrespondent's self-audit identified roughly $35,000 in overbilling spanning a three-year period.\n• Respondent provided the updated spreadsheets, but did not provide contemporaneous time\nrecords.\nResponse 3:\n• Respondent acknowledged shortcomings with billing practices/record keeping.\n• Respondent indicated that data provided by MCILS had been reviewed and that the\nrespondent had identified some recurring issues:\no large time entries being the aggregate time for several attorneys;\no Defender Data defaulting to the assigned counsel on each billable entry, which\nrequires a manual correction and leaves room for human error; and\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 19\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\no included paralegal time for time spent working with attorneys, clients, courts,\nfamilies, and service providers.\n• Respondent identified a small number of duplicate entries and payments.\n• Respondent did not provide contemporaneous time records, but did offer to make available\nto the Executive Director, summary spreadsheets reconciling time records with the agency's\ndata.\nOPEGA notes that no one provided contemporaneous time records and that, in general, the\nresponses would not allow MCILS staff to independently\nconfirm many of the claims made. We did not see that agency None of the attorneys included\nstaff took steps to perform field audits or otherwise verify or in the high billing investigation\nprovided contemporaneous\nchallenge any of the responses. Similarly, we did not see\ntime records as requested by\nevidence that MCILS took steps to quantify the potential\nthe Executive Director.\nareas of noncompliance (billing for paralegal time and\nduplicate payments) described in Response 3 or recoup any payments. •\nAdditionally, based on the one case where an attorney responded with self-identified overbilling, it is\napparent that there is no established agency process for determining, confirming, and/or agreeing\nupon a repayment amount. Further, there appeared to be little effort made by the agency to collect\nthe overpayments, although this may have been partly due to the lack of an established mechanism\nto recoup these funds. There may also be a question surrounding where any repaid funds would go\nto either MCILS's account or the State's General Fund. OPEGA notes that the attorney's self-\nidentified overpayment amounts were finalized on February 8, 2019 and at the time of this review,\nno reimbursement, or a plan for reimbursement payments, has been made.\nOverall, the agency's audit/investigative process appeared informal and inconsistently administered.\nThe process relied almost exclusively upon one self-audit by, and unverified responses from, only a\nfew attorneys which were of varying quality. This information governed the agency's decisions\n(made at the discretion of the Executive Director) to pursue some overpayments and to not pursue\nother potential areas of noncompliance and overpayment. Together, these elements resulted in audit\nefforts of limited scope, depth, and effectiveness. Although the agency's enforcement actions, such\nas removing an attorney from the MCILS roster, in response to this information may otherwise\nappear to be straightforward decisions, OPEGA notes a complicating factor. A decision to remove\nan attorney from the roster may be first and foremost governed by a need to ensure an adequate\nnumber of attorneys sufficient to represent clients — particularly in certain regions of the state.\n(cid:226)  Establishment of a formal audit process would serve as a more effective control than the current\nmethods used by the agency and would provide for consistency in enforcement efforts. A more\neffective process could include policies and procedures that would guide the agency regarding:\n• how and when audits are to be conducted;\n• the records to be maintained by attorneys (and other non-counsel service providers) for\npotential MCILS review;\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 20\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\n• a means of determining, confirming, and/or settling disputed overpayment amounts;\n• a mechanism to recoup overpayments;\n• penalties (including dismissal from the MCILS roster) for noncompliance; and\n• consistent enforcement of all MCILS rules.\nData issues impede further analysis\nAt the outset of this review, OPEGA raised the possibility that our data analysis and follow-up work\nwould allow us to separate instances of what appeared to be overbilling from actual overbilling. We\nanticipated this information could then be used to potentially identify likely overbilling attorneys for\nlimited field audits of attorney billing and time records. Our work did reveal that the highest average\nweekly hours reported by the 6AC report and the media is much smaller than initially thought, yet\nthe underlying issues and red flags remain. While we are unsure whether the desire for further work,\nor field audits, has decreased given awareness that the magnitude of the reported suspected\noverbilling was overstated, the selection of any attorneys for further work is problematic at this time\ndue to underlying data issues.\nThroughout our data analysis, we encountered numerous outlying event values that we later\ndetermined were false alarms based on the notes associated with those entries. The notes themselves\nindicated that attorneys and their staff were not always reporting time in discrete values by day and\nby attorney. This was a theme that extended throughout our review of MCILS's audit/investigative\nefforts revealing a significant level of inconsistency in the data entered into the billing system. In\nattorney responses to both MCILS Executive Director's high billing investigations and 12-hour alert\nnotifications within the billing system, OPEGA observed that attorneys reported batching work\nevents (such as aggregating the time spent on texts for the entirety of a case into one-time event on a\nsingle day) or combining the hours of multiple attorneys under one attorney on a single date.\nWorking on this review clarified for us that the manner in which information is entered into\nDefender Data by attorneys, essentially serves the singular purpose of getting MCILS's approval and\npayment for the various events on a voucher. To achieve this purpose, the data does not necessarily\nneed to be granular or subject to strict entry protocols. Consequently, the data does not allow for the\ntype of broader analysis which would identify specific attorneys to review — those having potentially\noverbilled for payment of services — which was the kind of investigation OPEGA had originally\nenvisioned.\nDue to the data limitations noted here, an investigation into specific instances of potential\noverbilling would require labor-intensive field audits of event-level and records and possibly client\nfiles, in the possession of rostered attorneys. In consideration of the explanations provided to\nMCILS in the course of its own audit/investigative work, the relatively small number of identified\noverpayments, and the tremendous amount of resources required for field audits, the GOC and the\nLegislature may wish to consider foregoing this intense effort and to direct OPEGA to move\nforward with a focus on the potentially more-impactful work related to indigency determinations.\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 21\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nPart III. MCILS Structure of Oversight\nIs the oversight structure of MCILS adequate?\nOPEGA was tasked with determining the adequacy of the oversight structure of MCILS in ensuring\nthat operations align with and accomplish the organization's purpose. We identified several\ninterrelated issues that contribute to a structure which fails to provide adequate oversight of\nMCILS's operations - and of the Commission's statutory purpose to efficiently provide high-quality\nlegal representation to indigent clients. The interrelated reasons for this inadequate oversight\nstructure will require a holistic approach to remedy.\nOPEGA found that the following appear to be the main contributors to the weakness of the\noversight structure.\n• The agency charged with administering MCILS's purpose is under-staffed.\n• MCILS staff operates without clearly-defined roles and uses current staff inefficiently.\n• The Commission receives insufficient support for necessary operations.\n• A weak oversight structure impacts the ability of MCILS to adequately meet its statutory\npurpose.\nThe agency appears to have little organizational structure, as staff have no established job\ndescriptions, or other formal guidance, outlining job functions and responsibilities. Had such a\nstructure, with clearly defined roles and responsibilities and written guidance, been established early\non in MCILS's development, staff efforts might have been more appropriately focused on\neffectively and efficiently performing the agency's primary functions. This structure would have also\npossibly enabled the Commission to identify the specific functions that were inadequately covered in\nthe agency so as to make targeted requests for additional staff.\nOPEGA sees the function of establishing and maintaining a sufficiently resourced agency to\neffectively and efficiently achieve the organization's\nInsufficient staff resources\nstatutory purpose as a fundamental responsibility of any\nleave little opportunity for a\ngovernment entity. Despite a long-standing awareness at the\nfocus on improvements to\nagency level and among the Commission that staff levels\nagency processes, systems,\nand broader structural issues. were insufficient, it did not result in requests or substantive\nadvocacy for an increase in staffing for the agency. Further,\ngiven this understanding that staffing was a concern, it appears that there has been little focus by the\nagency, or by the Commission, to identify how the organization should be structured to achieve its\npurpose.\nIn order to provide some context to this report's discussion of MCILS's oversight structure, it is\nimportant to note that MCILS's purview in providing legal services to the indigent (and partially\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 22\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nindigent) in Maine is extensive. The system is currently made up of 368 rostered attorneys appearing\nin courts throughout Maine. In FY19, rostered attorneys opened 27,437 cases, totaling\napproximately $17 million in attorney billing. In that year, MCILS processed and paid 32,575\nattorney vouchers.\nIssue 6.T he agency charged with administering MCILS purpose is under-staffed.\nOPEGA observed a lack of sufficient staff to adequately meet the full responsibilities of the agency.\nWhen we asked the Executive Director about review or improvements to specific agency operations,\nthe Executive Director described that the current MCILS staff is the minimum necessary to allow\nthe system to continue to function. Thus, there was little time available to consider new initiatives,\nor improvements, to wider substantive structural issues such as quality of representation, the lawyer-\nof-the-day program, or the use of single-source contracts to provide legal services. The Executive\nDirector described that there was a general, ongoing awareness over the years amongst the\nCommission that the agency was short-staffed.\nAlthough the agency's annual report is submitted to the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary and\nthe Governor in January of each year, the report does not appear to describe a staffing need (other\nthan noting existing vacancies) or advocate for more staff. The report describes MCILS's office\nstaffing as follows:\nThe Commission's central office staff consists oft he Executive Director, the DOJO Executive\nDirector, and an Accounting Technician. Af ourth administrative supportp osition remained vacant\nduring 2017 as the remainder oft he central office staff, by utilking technology and sharing basic\nadministrative tasks, was able to operate with this position vacant. The Commission believes that\nthe administrative supportp osition should bef illed There was noj ob turnover among central office\nstaffd uring 2017.\nAlthough MCILS staff vacancies are mentioned, OPEGA notes that the annual reports do not\ndescribe an urgent need for the vacancy to be filled, express a need for additional staff, or indicate\nwhat functions, or statutory requirements, are not being attended to as a result of insufficient\nstaffing.\nIt was expressed to OPEGA that requests for additional staffing resources would not be looked on\nfavorably due to the focus on meeting current operating costs and addressing agency budget\nshortfalls. Thus, despite the apparent staffing needs, MCILS did not advocate, or make formal\nrequests to the Legislature, for additional staff in prior budget cycles until the most recent\nsupplemental budget request in early 2020.\nIssue 7. MCILS staff operates without clearly-defined roles and uses current staff\ninefficiently.\nThe absence of a clear and effective agency structure with defined roles, responsibilities and\nexpectations, contributes to what OPEGA observed to be an inefficient use of existing staff.\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 23\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nIn discussions with agency staff about their roles and responsibilities, it appeared to OPEGA that a\nsubstantial portion of management staff time was being spent on day-to-day operations, including a\nsignificant amount of administrative-level work. Below are some of the areas where OPEGA\nobserved inefficient use of agency staff.\nRostering\nThe Deputy Executive Director performs monthly updates of each attorney roster, which are\ndivided by region and then further by practice specialty. This function requires keeping track of and\nresponding to communications from attorneys who want to be removed from the roster or change\ncase type assignments, and updating information such as when an attorney moves to another firm.\nThe Executive Director and Deputy Executive Director advise attorneys on eligibility requirements,\nincluding whether to apply for a waiver on certain requirements. They also conduct analysis of\ngeographic distribution of attorneys when an attorney requests a new court location. There is also a\nprocess requiring attorneys to renew their roster status annually. This is a paper-driven process,\nwhich is described as time-consuming by the agency's Deputy Executive Director. Though a\nportion, or certain elements, of this work may require a higher level of response by management,\nthere does not appear to be any consideration of assigning roster-related tasks to administrative-level\nstaff.\nAttorney Voucher Approval \nAs noted in Issue 3 on page 8, the Executive Director and Deputy Executive Director spend a\nsubstantial amount of time reviewing and approving individual attorney vouchers. Although\nreviewing expenditures and processing payments is a primary and critical MCILS function, the\nmethod of voucher-level review is neither effective nor efficient, as discussed in Issue 3 on pages 8-\n16. As this report has stated, OPEGA notes that a more targeted, risk-based approach would allow\nfor management staff time to be used more efficiently and to better recognize the qualifications and\nexperience level of the Executive Director and Deputy Executive Director. For initial review and\nbasic processing of attorney vouchers, written instructions and guidance could be used to support\nemployees with qualifications better matched with this primarily administrative function.\n12-hour Notification Follow-up \nAn element of the recently established system intended to monitor for potential overbilling by\nattorneys — the 12-hour notification system— requires follow-up with an attorney whose voucher\nsubmission generated a flag in the Defender Data system. (See page 12.) Staff described this process\nas time-consuming, requiring reaching out to individual attorneys and manually recording the\ninformation collected as part of the follow-up effort.\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 24\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nAgency management's focus on OPEGA considers it to be an inefficient use of staffing\nday-to-day administrative duties resources to have management level positions undertaking\nimpacts the capacity to provide administrative level work. Whether the Commission, as the\npolicy support and strategic\noversight body for the agency, shares this view about the\ndirection to the Commission.\nmismatch between staff qualifications and the functions they\nperform is unclear. It does not appear to OPEGA that this has been an area of focus of the\nCommission and, given the absence of MCILS staff job descriptions (or any written description of\nroles, expectations and tasks), it would be difficult for the Commission to provide oversight as to\nwhether the current staff are undertaking an appropriate level of activities or are sufficiently focused\non mutually understood priorities. The Executive Director reported having not had any formal\nperformance evaluations. An apparent consequence of management positions being focused on day-\nto-day functions, is that there is no remaining capacity to provide appropriate policy support and\nstrategic direction to the Commission, which would guide the agency in meeting its purpose and also\nallow for oversight of the agency's operational structure.\nIssue 8.T he Commission receives insufficient support for necessary operations.\nOPEGA observed inconsistency in expectations between the Commission and the Executive\nDirector as to who should be assuming the initiative for providing policy direction and engaging in\nstrategic planning.\nStatute sets out specific requirements on the Commission (4 MRSA §1804) and the Executive\nDirector (4 MRSA 551805 and 1805-A). Many of these requirements relate to the original\nestablishment of the Commission, setting out what the Legislature considered to be necessary for\nthe newly established entity to commence operations. Other than statute, there is no written\nexpectation of the Commission's role and new Commissioners are not provided with any sort of\ntraining to orient them to their functional role. Similarly, other than statute, there is no written\nexpectation of the Executive Director (or other staff) in the form of a job description — something\nwe've noted previously in this report.\nOPEGA observed a lack of clarity between the\nThe lack of mutual understanding\nCommission and the Executive Director about whose between the Commission and the\nresponsibility it is to drive the strategic and policy Executive Director regarding\ndirection of the agency and Commission. For example, responsibilities and expectations\ncreates a risk of insufficient\nOPEGA observed differing perspectives on whether the\naccountability for the provision of\nCommission is largely responsible for rule making and\nindigent legal services.\nbudgets or for wide-ranging oversight of the provision\nof indigent legal services across the state, including oversight of the work of the agency. This lack of\nclarity and mutual understanding regarding roles, responsibilities and expectations between the\nCommission and the Executive Director creates a risk to MCILS,a nd to the State, of insufficient\naccountability for the provision of indigent legal services in the State.\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 25\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nOPEGA cites the following examples to illustrate how the lack of clearly defined roles and mutual\nunderstanding of responsibilities impacts what information is provided to the Commission and\ntherefore impacts the Commission's ability to provide robust oversight.\nInformation Provided to the Commission\nFor any Commission, or similar body, to effectively exercise oversight of an administering agency\nand to make key strategic and policy decisions towards the Commission's objectives, a consistent\nflow of useful and appropriate information is necessary. For MCILS, statute sets minimum\nrequirements for information and documents to be provided to the Commission on a monthly and\nannual basis (4 MRSA §1805(7)). It appears to OPEGA, that this minimum standard is met.\nHowever, although technically sufficient to comply with statute, it appears to OPEGA that the\nCommission requires additional information to be able to provide effective oversight and decision-\nmaking focused on the purpose of MCILS For example, although the Executive Director provides\ninformation to the Commission when requested, the Commission does not always appear to know\nwhat information it should request.\nPreviously we noted the lack of mutual understanding regarding responsibilities (among the\nCommission or the Executive Director) which continued to be apparent as we looked at the\nsubstance, format and content of information or materials provided to the Commission. OPEGA\nobserved that it is not clear as to who is responsible for identifying issues and determining what\ninformation should be distributed, or the type and level of information that should be routinely\nprovided, to the Commission to ensure effective oversight.\n• Financial information: A primary feature of each Commission meeting agenda is the\nmonthly Operations Report from the Executive Director. This includes summary data,\nincluding the number of new cases opened, number and value of vouchers submitted and paid,\naverage price per voucher, number of paid vouchers exceeding $5,000 (accompanied by a case\nsummary), number of complaints about attorneys and a very brief summary, number of\nrequests for co-counsel with a very brief summary, and budget account balances. Some of this\ninformation is specified by statute to be provided to the Commission and other information\nwas requested by the Commission in previous years - such as vouchers exceeding $5,000 and\ninformation about complaints.\nHaving reviewed a selection of Operations Reports and conducting interviews with the current\nand former Commission Chairs, OPEGA observed that what is typically provided in these\nreports does not appear to furnish the Commission with useful material to provide meaningful\noversight or to make decisions based on the information given. Our review of Commission\nmeeting minutes showed no evidence of decision-making as a result of the monthly\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 26\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nOperations Report data. The summary-level data in the reports, while providing an overview,\ndoes not appear to assist in identifying issues or concerns for the Commission.\n• 12-hour daily billing flags: Following the release of the 6AC report and the agency's internal\ninvestigation on potential attorney overbilling, MCILS implemented an alert system that is\ntriggered if an attorney enters daily billing that exceeds 12 hours for the day, as described on\npage 12. This was implemented towards the end of the tenure of the last cohort of\nCommissioners, at a period of transition. OPEGA notes from the Commission meeting\nminutes in May 2019, that the Executive Director updated the Commission to note that the\nCommission's request to reduce the daily hours alert to be triggered at 12 hours (rather than\n16 hours) per day. Thereafter, as of the time of OPEGA's review of meeting minutes through\nJanuary 2020,i t does not appear as though the Commission was given any formal briefings, or\nfeedback, on how the system was working and what MCILS staff were learning about attorney\nbilling. As this was a new system put in place to address a highly publicized concern around\nattorney over-billing, OPEGA would expect to see some mechanism to provide information\nto the Commission allowing it to provide oversight and assess whether the system is working\nas intended. OPEGA does note, however, that despite no formal information being presented\nto the Commission, the Commission's financial responsibility sub-committee, established in\nDecember 2019, began looking into the detail of this alert system.\n• Resource Counsel program: The Resource Counsel program provides another example of\nan area where there is a lack of clarity about the role and responsibilities for identifying issues,\ndocuments and information that should be considered by the Commission — and where the\ninformation provided to the Commission may not be adequate for the Commission to execute\nproper oversight of the program.\nThe Resource Counsel program was established by the Commission in June 2018 for the\npurpose of( according to the enacting document) providing `mentoring, sloe/vision and evaluation\nfo p rivate assigned counselp roviding indigent legal services.\" The enacting document noted that as the\nprogram was launched, mentoring would be the primary focus and, as the Commission gains\nexperience with the program, it may be expanded to provide periodic supervision and\nevaluation of attorneys.\nIt appears that as a mentoring program, it has the effect of being optional, as MCILS does not\nundertake any monitoring, or enforcement of new attorneys, to meet with Resource Counsel.\nThe enacting document notes that the mentoring component requires Resource Counsel to\nmeet with newly rostered attorneys three times within their first 6 months. OPEGA did not\nconduct a comprehensive evaluation of this program; however, we did hear some participant\nperspectives. An attorney assigned as Resource Counsel reported to OPEGA that although\nnewly licensed attorneys on the MCILS roster are required to meet with Resource Counsel\nthree times during the early period of their practice, the program had yet to have a new\nattorney follow through with these requirements. This Resource Counsel attorney added that\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 27\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nnewly-licensed attorneys were being added to rosters and appointed to cases before the first\nrequired meeting had taken place.\nThis accords with what the Executive Director described to OPEGA - although new attorneys\nare informed by email that they are expected to meet with the Resource Counsel, there is no\nsystematic follow-up of whether the requirement is met. The Executive Director noted that he\nhoped that the mechanism for the Resource Counsel to bill for their hours (capped at 10 hours\nper month) would provide MCILS with this information, but they found that not all Resource\nCounsel attorneys were billing for all their work, so it was not an effective feedback loop. It\ndoes not appear as though any action was taken to resolve this information gap.\nThe Resource Counsel policy notes that six The Commission has received no\nmonths after the adoption of the policy, substantive information about the\n\"Commirsion Staff will report to the Commission on Resource Counsel program\nestablished in 2018 to provide\nthe operation oft he Resource Counsel system. \"As\nmentoring, supervision and evaluation\nthe document was adopted in June 2018, the\nof rostered attorneys, or an\nprogram would have been due for review in\nassessment of the program as\nDecember 2018. OPEGA is aware that required by its implementing\nthere was a brief note submitted to the document.\nCommission at their October 2018 meeting\nin which MCILS noted that it had started receiving and paying Resource Counsel vouchers\nand that several Resource Counsel attorneys had brought issues related to attorney\nperformance to the staff's attention seeking guidance. There did not appear to be any more\ndetailed or comprehensive report or review of the system at subsequent meetings. The\nExecutive Director acknowledged to OPEGA that, other than discussion in passing, there is\nno formal information that goes to the Commission about the program and there has not been\na review of the system as required in the implementing document. OPEGA understands that\nthe Resource Counsel policy document has not been provided to the current Commission, as\nof the time of OPEGA's review of meeting minutes through January 2020.\nMCILS does not appear to have taken steps to gather adequate information to assess the\nprogram. In turn, no information has been provided to the Commission to allow it to assess\nwhether the program is meeting its intended purpose.\nIssue 9. A weak oversight structure impacts the ability of MCILS to adequately meet its statutory\npurpose.\nThe lack of a strong oversight structure and insufficient staffing has resulted in impacts to MCILS's\nstatutory purpose. Statute provides that MCILS is \"an independent commission whose purpose is to\nprovide efficient, high-quality representation to indigent criminal defendants, juvenile defendants\nand children and parents in child protective cases, consistent with federal and state constitutional\nand statutory obligations\" (4 MRSA §1801). OPEGA finds that the oversight of the operations in\nplace for MCILS is inadequate to meet this stated purpose. OPEGA finds that the same is true for\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 28\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nother separately listed statutory requirements, beyond MCILS's stated purpose, which we also\ndiscuss in this section.\nOuality Representation \nIt is central to the purpose of MCILS that \"high-quality representation\" is provided to indigent (and\npartially indigent) clients in the State. However, MCILS has no mechanism to measure attorney\nperformance against practice standards or any other\nDespite identification by external\nevaluations as early as 2017 that mechanism in place to formally measure, assess or oversee\nMCILS does not provide the quality of representation. OPEGA notes that we did not\nsystemic oversight and assess the extent to which attorneys are providing high\nevaluation of attorneys, effective\nquality representation — we looked at the extent to which the\nmechanisms to do so have not\nCommission and the Executive Director provide oversight\nbeen implemented.\nof quality representation.\nIssues related to a lack of oversight of quality representation were raised by both the 2017 Working\nGroup and the 6AC. The 2017 Working Group noted that \"the current program does not have\nsystematic oversight and evaluation of attomeysth\". The 6AC report noted that as there are no\nsystems or capacity to provide oversight, it is difficult to know the extent of any potential problems\nwith the quality of representation\". Despite these issues having been identified by external bodies,\nno formal evaluation mechanism has been put in place. The Executive Director described not\nhaving the staff available to monitor lawyers or review files. However, as noted above, prior to the\nmost recent supplemental budget request, no requests have been made for additional staff.\nMCILS described some informal mechanisms it uses to attempt to monitor quality. However,\nOPEGA sees these as insufficient to ensure high-quality representation. The mechanisms primarily\nincluded the Resource Counsel program and what might potentially be gleaned by the Executive\nDirector and Deputy Executive Director as they conduct voucher reviews.\n• Resource Counsel: MCILS described the Resource Counsel program, which was\nimplemented in June 2018, as an attempt to monitor and evaluate quality. However, as we\nhave noted, the program has not been reviewed as required by the implementing document,\nactions have not been taken to seek to extend it to supervision and monitoring of attorneys,\nand there is currently no monitoring or enforcement of the mentoring meeting requirements\non new attorneys. Additionally, there has been no systematic collection feedback on issues\nraised through this system communicated up to the Commission for it to provide oversight.\n• Voucher review as a quality review: The MCILS Executive Director described getting an\nimpression of attorney quality by reviewing individual attorney vouchers for payment,\nbecause the reviewer is able to see actions taken (such as client meetings) and the case\noutcome. The Executive Director described attorney voucher review as a useful and\n10 2017 Working Group report, page 1.\n11 Sixth Amendment Center report, pages 57-62.\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 29\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nmeaningful quality review procedure. Though vouchers provide some level of review,\nOPEGA does not consider this to be an adequate measure of attorney quality. The review\ninvolves reviewing the time and activities billed, but as discussed on pages 10-11, there is no\nmechanism to confirm whether the activities billed in fact took place. Additionally, the\nprocess of voucher review does not include a systematic evaluation against the standards,\nnor is any information related to quality as gleaned from voucher review communicated up\nto the Commission for it to provide oversight.\n• Additional area of risk: OPEGA also noted other areas of risk, including that MCILS does\nnot have any formal mechanism to consider availability and quality of attorneys on a regional\nbasis (other than a general awareness by Commission staff of the number and identity of\nattorneys in each region and thus there is no Commission oversight, or systematic\nconsideration, of potential regional availability or quality issues. OPEGA did not conduct\nany regional quality assessment of attorney availability or distribution, but did hear anecdotal\nevidence from multiple sources raising concerns around availability of a sufficient number of\nquality attorneys in a number of rural counties. OPEGA notes that regional availability issues\ncan impact cost effectiveness, as it requires engaging attorneys out of the area and paying\nincreased travel costs.\nThe absence of formal, systematic mechanisms to monitor or evaluate attorney performance (and\ntherefore no mechanism for the Commission to provide oversight) creates a risk that at least one\nprimary purpose of MCILS as prescribed by statute - providing high quality representation - is not\nbeing met.\nScreening for Indigence \nMCILS's statutory purpose refers to the provision of legal services to indigent individuals. Different\nstates have different policies, or mechanisms, to assess indigence. Maine has elected to use financial\nscreeners, who are present in some (but not all) courts to interview individuals and gather\ninformation about income, assets and expenditures and to prepare a recommendation for judicial\ndetermination.\nWhere there is a financial screener, the screener meets with a client to collect information that is\nused to prepare a recommendation to the judge based on the client's reported income, assets and\nexpenses, taking account of the MCILS Indigence Guidelines, which are a component of the MCILS\nrules. The judge is responsible for determining whether a defendant has sufficient means to employ\ncounsel, based on listed factors, including income, credit, assets, living expenses, dependents,\noutstanding obligations and the cost of retaining services of competent counsel. If the judge\ndetermines that the defendant has sufficient means to pay a portion of the cost, counsel is assigned,\nbut that assignment would be accompanied by an order to pay a portion of the costs.\nFor the purposes of this phase of the report, OPEGA only considered the financial screening\nfunction to the extent to which it is relevant to evaluating the overall oversight structure. Further\nexamination of the screening function may be explored in the next phase of OPEGA's work for the\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 30\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nsubsequent report. We note that a proposed amendment to LD 182 would, if passed, transfer the\nfinancial screening function from MCILS to the Judicial Branch. At the time of publication of this\nreport, LD 182 was carried over to any Special Session of the 129' Legislature. Regardless of where\nthe financial screening function resides, OPEGA would expect to see oversight of screening,\nincluding a shared understanding of the purpose, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, and\nconsistency of guidance and approach throughout the state. Although OPEGA did not, in this\nphase, conduct a full review of the screening function, we can make some observations based on our\nreview of the relevant rules and guidelines, and based on interviews with MCILS stakeholders,\nincluding screeners, lawyers, and judges. These observations indicate a general lack of oversight\nattention paid to this function.\n• Inconsistent understanding of role: OPEGA noted that there was an inconsistent\nperspective among those we interviewed about the purpose of the financial screening function\n— some considered that the purpose was to provide information to assist the judiciary in\nmaking its determination of indigence, but others considered that the primary purpose of the\nrole is to collect as much money as possible from partially indigent clients.\n• Indigence Guidelines should be reviewed: OPEGA notes that the Indigence Guidelines do\nnot take into account the judicial requirement to consider the cost of retaining the services of\ncompetent counsel. Although the detailed work around consistency of indigence\ndetermination is part of the second phase of this evaluation, OPEGA did hear about\ninconsistencies in practice between screeners. OPEGA notes that the guidelines do not\ninclude any practical guidance on recommendations of partial indigence and that there is no\ncurrent plan to review the guidelines.\n• Location and number of screeners: OPEGA notes that screeners do not appear in every\ncourt, and this can have wider impacts. OPEGA heard that this may increase the time spent by\njudges in assessing screening information, and/or may impact the likely accuracy of the\ninformation provided directly by defendants, and/or may result in the Lawyer of the Day\nspending some time assisting clients completing screening forms.\n• Collections: Collections from those determined partially indigent happen either by way of\nperiodic payments directly from the client, by allocation of bail money, or by tax offsets\n(whereby the Maine Revenue Service withholds funds from tax returns if there are missed\nscheduled payments). OPEGA notes that there are no rules, or written guidance, that sets out\ninformation about collection mechanisms. The Commission does receive monthly totals of\nthe amounts collected, but there is no information on regional variations to assess potential\nconsistency issues. The Executive Director noted that MCILS may not have accurate regional\ncollection information available, which raises questions about the mechanism to monitor and\ntrack relevant information. MCILS informed OPEGA that in courts where there is no\nscreener, MCILS takes no action to follow-up on orders of partial indigence by tracking\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 31\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nmonthly payments or tax-offsets, and this potentially creates regional inconsistency about how\norders for partial indigence are enforced.\nAccording to the Executive Director, MCILS processes about 2-6 overpayments by clients per\nmonth. As explained in more detail on page 6, issues around amounts that a client is due to\npay may be impacted if attorney voucher amounts are inaccurate.\nIncreasing the number of screeners to provide them at each court location and adding a requirement\nthat indigent or partially indigent clients be re-screened throughout the course of a case would\nrequire further analysis of staffing needs and cost effectiveness, as well as consultation with the\nJudicial Branch. OPEGA notes that the concerns we've raised here related to the screening function\nas part of the overall program of providing legal representation to indigent and partially indigent\nclients warrant further consideration and consultation. The absence of oversight of the screening\nfunction creates a risk of inefficiency, ineffectiveness and inconsistency potentially impacting\nindigent and partially indigent clients.\nMeeting Statutory Obligations\nOPEGA observed that there has been insufficient oversight by\nAlthough required by\nstatute since 2009, MCILS MCILS to ensure that all statutory requirements are met. Maine\nhas not established statute requires the Commission to develop standards governing\nstandards for conflict of the delivery of legal services to indigent clients, to include specified\ninterest and counsel\nmatters listed below. These standards have not been developed and\ncaseloads.\nit does not appear to OPEGA that there are imminent plans to\nresolve non-compliance with these statutory requirements (either by meeting the requirements or\nadvancing a proposal to amend statute):\n• standards for counsel caseloads (4 MRSA 51804(2)(C));\n• standards for the evaluation of counsel (4 MRSA 51804(2)(D));\n• standards for independent, quality and efficient representation of clients whose cases present\nconflicts of interest (4 MRSA 51804(2)(E)); and\n• procedures for handling complaints about the performance of counsel providing indigent\nlegal services (4 MRSA 51804(3)(M)).\nThe requirements for case load and conflicts of interest standards were enacted by PL 2009, c. 419\nand therefore have been in place for over a decade. The requirements for standards for the\nevaluation of counsel and requiring a complaint procedure were enacted more recently by\nPL 2017, c. 284. OPEGA acknowledges that there appears to be an unwritten, informal procedure\nin place where complaints are investigated and outcomes determined by the Executive Director.\nHowever, there is no written policy, procedure or criteria in place that sets out how complaints\nshould be investigated or determined. Presumably, the establishment of such standards is intended\nnot only to guide the agency (and the Commission) in processing and resolving complaints in a fair\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 32\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nand consistent manner, but also to inform the person making the complaint and the subject of the\ncomplaint about what to expect from the process.\nAlthough the Commission is directed by statute to develop these standards and procedures, as staff,\nthe Executive Director is required by statute to:\n• ensure that the provision of indigent legal services complies with all constitutional, statutory\nand ethical standards (4 MRSA §1805(1));\n• assist the Commission in developing standards for the delivery of adequate indigent legal\nservices (4 MRSA §1805(2)); and\n• coordinate the development and implementation of rules, policies, procedures, regulations\nand standards adopted by the Commission (4 MRSA §1805(8)).\nOPEGA has noted multiple times in this report that, overall, we found MCILS lacks adequate\nstandard operating procedures and formal written policies to govern its primary functions. Similarly,\nOPEGA has found that even when standards are required to be established specifically in statute,\nMCILS relies on informal methods or does not address the standard at all.\nEffectiveness and Efficiency of Financial Procedures \nThe lack of a robust oversight structure contributes to inadequate monitoring of the effectiveness\nand efficiency of financial procedures used by the agency. As described in pages 9-17, the\nprocedures used by MCILS staff to monitor payments and expenditures associated with providing\nlegal representation to indigent and partially indigent clients are inadequate. A robust oversight\nstructure would be guided by a plan that clearly defines prioritized functions designed to meet\nMCILS's statutory purposes and obligations effectively and efficiently. As noted in this review, the\nagency operates without written job descriptions, only informal guidelines and with a lack of clarity\nregarding the roles and responsibilities of staff as well as those of the Commission.\nReports of summary data regarding Summary data regarding expenditures provided at\nexpenditures provides no monthly meetings does not provide the Commission with\ninformation about financial an understanding of the financial processes employed by\nprocesses and systems used by\nthe agency the Commission is charged to oversee and\nthe agency and does not appear to\nhow those processes are working. Additionally, this\ninform decisions or actions of the\nsummary data does not appear to be used to inform\nCommission.\ndecisions or actions of the Commission. An\nunderstanding of the policies and procedures governing the agency's financial operations could serve\nas a framework for Commission oversight of these functions — but as noted in this report, such\nwritten policies and procedures do not exist. Adequate oversight goes beyond simply having\nknowledge of the number of vouchers submitted and the amounts paid - it requires an\nunderstanding of the processes used to administer those payments and the specific controls in place\nto ensure they are made appropriately. Although the process used to review expenditures and\nsubmit payment for vouchers comprises a majority of the agency's working hours, the Commission\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 33\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nappears to have dedicated little time to understand those processes and evaluate their effectiveness\nand efficiency.\n(cid:226)  Addressing the interrelated issues contributing to MCILS weak oversight structure will\nrequire a holistic approach.\nThis report identifies several issues which are interrelated in their contribution to MCILS's\ninadequate structure for oversight of its operations and statutory purpose. The establishment of a\nrobust oversight structure for MCILS should begin with the development of a formal, strategic plan\nwith a framework driven by and addressing each of the elements contained within MCILS's\nstatutory purpose—to provide efficient, high-quality representation to indigent criminal defendants,\njuvenile defendants and children and parents in child protective cases, consistent with federal and\nstate constitutional and statutory obligations. A focus on this purpose should result in a plan which\nwould include clearly expressed priorities, articulated objectives for all of the processes and systems\nestablished to achieve those priorities, and well-defined roles and responsibilities for MCILS staff\nand the Commission itself. Adherence to a well-designed strategic plan could facilitate a structure\nfor MCILS oversight and operations that is proactive in addressing issues of efficiency, effectiveness\nand potential misconduct—as opposed to the current posture of the structure, which is more\nreactive and shortsighted. Existence of this formal guiding document would provide the necessary\nfoundation upon which the operations of the agency are designed, as well as, the benchmarks against\nwhich those operations can be measured and monitored by the Commission — and ultimately\nsupport effective oversight to ensure that MCILS's obligation to the People of the State of Maine is\nbeing met.\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 34\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nAppendix A\nProject Direction Statement\nProject direction statement: Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nPresented by OPEGA to the Government Oversight Conunittee - 129th Maine Legislature\nDecember 10, 2019\nPurpose of a project direction statement in the course of a full review\nAfter the Government Oversight Committee( GOC)a dded a review of financial oversight and economic use\nof resources related to the Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services (MCILS) to the Approved Project\nList, OPEGA assigned a team of Analysts to conduct preliminary research. The preliminary research stage of\nthe evaluation process provides the team with a broad, but comprehensive understanding of the program.\nOnce preliminary research is complete, the team reviews themes that have emerged and identifies areas that\nmay be of future concern to the program. This work results in a proposed project direction statement for the\nGOC to consider. The statement suggests a framework that will guide OPEGA in the next phase of the\nevaluation process, fieldwork. This document represents that work and is respectfully presented for the\nGOC's consideration.\nOPEGA recommends that the GOC direct a full evaluation of MCILS specifically related to financial\noversight and the economic use of resources, and within the scope described in this statement.\nOverview of MCILS\nEstablishment of MCILS and Organizational Structure \nMCILS is a Commission that was established in 2009. The Commission is currently made up of nine\nmembers and is supported by an office staff of 4 who conduct the day-to-day operations. Its statutory\npurpose is to provide efficient, high-quality representation to indigent criminal defendants, juvenile\ndefendants, and children and families in child protective cases. This representation is provided in accordance\nwith requirements established in statute and both the federal and state constitutions. Maine statute specifies\nthat the Commission shall work to ensure the delivery of indigent legal services by qualified and competent\ncounsel in a manner that is fair and consistent throughout the state and to ensure adequate funding of a\nstatewide system of indigent legal services, which must be provided and managed in a fiscally responsible\nmanner. MCILS assumed responsibility for providing indigent legal services on July 1, 2010. Prior to MCILS,\nindigent legal services were arranged and funded by the Judicial Branch.\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 35\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nAn amendment to statute in 2018 increased the number of members appointed to serve on the Commission\nfrom five to nine. The membership must include one member with experience in administration and finance,\none member with experience in child protection proceedings, and two members (non-voting) who are\nattorneys providing indigent legal services.\nMCILS staff includes an Executive Director, Deputy Executive Director, Accounting Technician, and an\nOffice Associate, working in an office in Augusta; eight financial screening staff, who work at various\ncourthouses across the state; and one investigator, who works part-time remotely.\nDetermination as indigent or partially indigent\nIn Maine, services for those who have been determined indigent, or partially indigent, are provided by\nattorneys in private practice. The Court assigns representation to a person by selecting an attorney from a\nroster maintained by MCILS. In order to be listed on the roster, attorneys must meet certain requirements.\nIf they provide specific types of services, or have a defense specialty, they are listed on specific rosters\naccordingly.\nA client's status as indigent or partially indigent is determined by a judge based on financial information\nprovided by the person requiring representation. In some courts, a financial screener may be available. The\nscreener interviews the client, gathers financial information, including the client's assets, income and expenses\nand makes a recommendation to the judge based on this information. The judge can deny representation at\nthe public expense or make a determination that the person is indigent or partially indigent. A person\ndetermined partially indigent is ordered to make payments toward the assigned attorney's fees.\nAttorney payments\nMCILS is responsible for paying counsel fees and expenses to attorneys who have been assigned to indigent\nor partially indigent clients. Attorneys submit a voucher to MCILS through the electronic case management\nprogram, Defender Data. The MCILS Director and Deputy Executive Director review vouchers and approve\nattorney payments. Services provided by vendors hired by the attorney such as investigators, interpreters, and\nmedical and psychological experts require advance notice and approval by MCILS The vendor sends an\ninvoice for the services provided to the attorney which is then submitted to and processed by MCILS who\nmakes payment to the vendor.\nUntil June 30, 2019, one fixed fee contract existed to facilitate providing representation in Somerset County.\nMCILS contracted with three private attorneys to provide indigent legal services, paying the attorneys a fixed\nmonthly rate. Additionally, the attorneys were reimbursed for case related expenses, such as investigators and\nexpert witnesses. At this time, MCILS has no contracted attorney services.\nMCILS General Fund budget \nThe Legislature appropriated approximately $17.7 million for MCILS in FY20, and $17.6 for FY21.\nGOC decision to consider review of MCILS\nDuring the 128th legislative session, OPEGA received a request for a review of MCILS from a GOC\nmember with concerns related to the application of financial eligibility requirements for Court-appointed\ncounsel, attorney billing practices, and billing and collection efforts for clients who are required to pay a\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 36\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nportion of counsel fees. On February 17, 2017, the GOC voted unanimously to place the MCILS review\nrequest on OPEGA's Standby List.\nThe 2017 Working Group\nWhile this topic was on the Standby List, the 128th Legislature created the Working Group to Improve the\nProvision of Indigent Legal Services (the Working Group) as part of the biennial budget. The purpose of the\nWorking Group was to develop recommendations to improve the delivery of indigent legal services to eligible\npeople by focusing on:\n• ensuring adequate representation;\n• increasing the efficiency in delivering legal services;\n• verifying eligibility throughout representation; and\n• reducing costs while still fully honoring the constitutional and statutory obligations to provide\nrepresentation.\nIn December 2017, the Working Group issued its report containing nine recommendations— the following\nfour are related to the current scope of this request.\n• Recommendation 2: Enhance the MCILS staff to provide better financial accountability and quality\nassurance by establishing specific responsibilities for a Chief Financial Officer and a Training and\nQuality Control Director.\n• Recommendation 4: Strengthen the financial eligibility screening procedure.\n• Recommendation 5: Remove the collections function from the MCILS and have the Judiciary\nCommittee explore alternative methods of collecting from those recipients of legal services who have\nbeen ordered by the Court to contribute to the costs of those services.\n• Recommendation 7: Commission an outside, independent, nonpartisan study of Maine's current\nsystem of providing indigent legal services and whether alternative methods of delivery would\nincrease quality and efficiency.\nSixth Amendment Center report\nRecommendation 7 directly led to a report from the Sixth Amendment Center evaluating the services\nprovided by MCILS Issued April 2019, this report contained eight findings and seven recommendations—\nthe following, from that report, relate to the current scope of this request.\n• Finding 8: A significant number of attorneys bill in excess of eight hours per day, five days per week,\nfor 52 weeks per year. MCILS does not exert adequate financial oversight of private attorneys.\n• Recommendation 4: MCILS should use its current statutory power to promulgate more rigorous\nattorney qualification, recertification, training, supervision, and workload standards. The State of\nMaine should statutorily require financial oversight by requiring that MCILS limit the number of\npermissible billable hours, subject to waiver only upon a finding of need for additional capacity. The\nState of Maine should fund MCILS at a level to ensure rigorous training and effective substantive and\nfinancial oversight of attorneys.\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 37\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nWhile the Sixth Amendment Center report was being finalized, a GOC member brought forward a request\nfor a review of MCILS noting concerns with the administration of the program, its efficiency, and its\noversight of the quality and effectiveness of representation, and the screening procedure used to determine\neligibility for legal services.\nOn April 12, 2019, the GOC voted to move a review of MCILS to OPEGA's Approved Projects List, with\nthe scope limited to financial oversight and economic use of resources.\nPreliminary research conducted by OPEGA\nDuring the preliminary research phase OPEGA:\n• sought input from GOC members and Judiciary Committee members and staff on their questions\nand concerns regarding MCILS;\n• reviewed statute, legislative history, rules and guidance related to MCILS;\n• interviewed the State Auditor to understand any identified areas of concern;\n• interviewed the MCILS Executive Director, Deputy Executive Director, Accounting Technician, a\nselection of screeners, and the screener/investigator;\n• interviewed the ChiefJ ustice and a selection ofJ udges;\n• interviewed a selection of MCILS rostered attorneys working in different areas of law;\n• reviewed the data provided to the Sixth Amendment Center on voucher payments based on assigned\nattorney;\n• reviewed data on work performed over three years by nine attorneys and considered correspondence\nrelated to MCILS's investigation into high earning attorneys;\n• considered the Sixth Amendment Center report \"The Right to Counsel in Maine\"( April 2019) and\ninterviewed the Executive Director;\n• considered the report of the Legislative Working Group to Improve the Provision of Indigent Legal\nServices (December 2017);\n• reviewed a State Controller's report on MCILS's case management system; and\n• reviewed reports regarding the provision of indigent legal services in other states.\nEvaluation scope\nOPEGA examined the various themes that emerged from preliminary research and identified the following lc\nareas which potentially pose future risks to the elements of the program that are associated with financial\noversight and economic use of resources.\n1. Adequacy of systems and procedures used by MCILS staff to process payments and expenditures\nassociated with providing legal representation to clients who have been determined to be indigent or\npartially indigent.\n2.  Reasonableness of and consistency in the application of standards, criteria and procedures which\ninform the determination of whether a defendant/client is indigent.\n3.  Reasonableness of and consistency in the application of criteria and procedures used in determining,\nordering and monitoring payments towards counsel fees by those who have been determined to be\npartially indigent.\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 38\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\n4. Sufficiency of response by MCILS,o r MCILS staff, to internally identified concerns and to\nrecommendations made in reports which examined or evaluated the operations of the Commission\nregarding financial oversight.\n5.  Adequacy of the oversight structure of MCILS in ensuring that operations align with and accomplish\nthe organization's purpose.\nIf the GOC wishes to direct OPEGA to begin fieldwork for the purpose of conducting a full evaluation of,\nand report on, the financial oversight of MCILS, OPEGA proposes the areas listed above for the scope of\nthat work. If approved, OPEGA Analysts will examine the effectiveness of MCILS's financial controls in the\nprevention, detection and correction of inappropriate or unnecessary expenditures and if those controls are\nadequate to guard against fraud, waste and abuse. Analysts will evaluate if the practices employed by MCILS\nstaff( including screeners) relative to financial operations are being conducted in accordance with statute, rule\nand best practices, as well as whether they are effective, applied consistently, and when an appropriate\nstandard, with efficiency. Generally, fieldwork will also evaluate the structure and management of the\nfinancial elements of the program and if the structure and management are appropriate and in alignment with\nthe organization's purpose(s).\nAlthough some of the areas noted in this statement have been examined to some degree by the Sixth\nAmendment Center Report and the 2017 Working Group, OPEGA's review will add to that work. With\naccess to additional data, OPEGA will perform a more detailed analysis of attorney billing and expenditures\nmade by MCILS for legal services. It is possible that this comprehensive analysis might allow for us to\nseparate potential actual overbilling from outliers that may have been due to error or that just appear to be\ninstances of overbilling. This work may also allow for a closer examination of the current systems employed\nto review billing and make expenditures to identify where such systems may not be adequate for an\nappropriate level of scrutiny and oversight.\nIn consideration of the parameters cited when the GOC voted to include a review of the financial operation\nand oversight of MCILS onto the Approved Projects List, it is important to be clear about what this review\nwill not evaluate. The proposed scope does not include an evaluation of:\n• standards for attorneys to be on the MCILS rosters;\n• quality of representation provided;\n• attorney rates of pay; or\n• whether or not a public defender office should be introduced.\nOPEGA thanks the Committee for their consideration of this project direction statement for a full review of\nthe financial oversight and economic use of resources by the Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services.\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 39\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nAppendix B\nGOC decision to consider review of MOILS\nMCILS has previously been the subject of review by the Legislature and outside entities over the last three\nyears. The GOC had also been asked to consider directing OPEGA to conduct a review of MCILS prior to\nthe request that resulted in this review. In 2017, during the 128th legislative session, the GOC received a\nrequest for a review from a GOC member citing concerns related to the application of financial eligibility\nrequirements for Court-appointed counsel, attorney billing practices, and billing and collection efforts for\nclients who are required to pay a portion of counsel fees. A full review was not approved by the committee at\nthat time, but the request was added to GOC Stand-by List (pending a future vote to be added to the\napproved projects list/workplan) by a unanimous vote of the Committee.\nA few weeks before completion of the 6AC report, a GOC member brought forward a request for the\nCommittee to direct OPEGA to conduct a review of MCILS noting concerns with the administration of the\nprogram, its efficiency, and its oversight of the quality and effectiveness of representation, and the screening\nprocedure used to determine eligibility for legal services. On April 12, 2019, the GOC voted to move a review\nof MCILS to OPEGA's Approved Projects List, with the scope limited to financial oversight and economic\nuse of resources.\nOPEGA presented a project direction recommendation which examined the various themes that emerged\nfrom preliminary research and identified several areas which potentially pose future risks to the elements of\nthe program that are associated with financial oversight and economic use of resources.12 On December 10,\n2019, the GOC unanimously voted to direct OPEGA to conduct a full review of MCILS with the scope\noutlined in the project direction statement.\nThe GOC later moved to expedite some elements of the review after receiving communication from the\nChairs of the Joint Standing Committee on Judiciary requesting prioritization of the MCILS review. On\nJanuary 10, 2020, the GOC directed OPEGA to expedite review of the following evaluation scope items:\n• Adequacy of systems and procedures used by MCILS staff to process payments and expenditures\nassociated with providing legal representation to clients who have been determined to be indigent or\npartially indigent.\n• Adequacy of the oversight structure of MCILS in ensuring that operations align with and accomplish\nthe organization's purpose.\nOPEGA conducted field work from January through March,2 020 using extensive quantitative analysis as\nwell as more qualitative types of review. Some of that work included conducting interviews of MCILS staff\nand the current and former Commission Chairs, reviewing Commission meeting minutes, relevant statute and\nrules, and other relevant documents. OPEGA analyzed attorney billing data used by the agency, and data\nprovided to 6AC, as well as our own data set obtained directly from the billing system proprietor. We also\nselected a sample of invoices from non-attorney service providers (i.e. private investigators, expert witnesses,\ninterpreters, etc.) to test agency invoice review, approval, and audit practices.\nSee Appendix A Project Direction Statement for full list of themes.\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 40\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nAppendix C\nComparison of Sixth Amendment Center and OPEGA review of attorney billing\nOne of the primary drivers for this review were the issues noted in the 6AC report—particularly the number\nof annual hours billed by rostered attorneys—that were later reported by the media as potential examples of\noverbilling and/or fraud. With access to additional data directly from the billing service provider, OPEGA\nwas able to perform a more detailed analysis of attorney billing and payments made by MCILS for legal\nservices. The intention of this comprehensive analysis was to identify and separate instances in which outlying\nvalues resulting from data input errors or inconsistencies that otherwise—and incorrectly—appear to be\ninstances of overbilling from true, potential instances of overbilling within the dataset. This work allowed for\nthe closer examination of the current systems employed by the agency to review billing and make\nexpenditures, and to identify where such systems may not be adequate for an appropriate level of scrutiny and\noversight.\nSixth Amendment Center figures \nIn light of the published figures, the MCILS Executive Director worked with Justice Works (proprietor of\nDefender Data) to pull actual billing hour entries for the highest billing attorneys and undertook his own\ninvestigation in late August and early September of 2018. The Executive Director's analysis and\ncorrespondence with the attorneys in question led to the agency's conclusion that the figures reported in the\n6AC report did not reflect hours worked by those attorneys. As part of our initial work, OPEGA sought to\nverify the figures in the 6AC report to identify whether there were any underlying issues that fully, or partially,\nexplained the magnitude of the figures in the report.\nWe obtained and reviewed the data provided to the 6AC and found it captured annual (fiscal year) billings by\nthe attorney originally assigned to the case by the Court, which the 6AC then used to calculate the average\nnumber of hours worked per week for that assigned attorney by using the appropriate attorney rate for each\nfiscal year and 52 weeks per year. We found those calculations to be mathematically correct.\nWe also obtained and reviewed the data later obtained by MCILS staff from Justice Works for its\ninvestigation, the agency's analysis related to that investigation, and resulting correspondence between MCILS\nstaff and selected attorneys. Issues with the scope and depth of this investigation are noted in Issue 5 on page\n18.\nLastly, we worked directly with Justice Works to obtain our own dataset. That data contained, not only\npayments to assigned counsel, but also the actual work events (standardized entries that describe the work\nperformed such as preparing an email, file review, phone conference with client, etc.), the durations of those\nevents (in tenths of an hour), the attorney who performed the work—regardless of assignment—and all\nassociated payments for that work. After performing our own analysis and comparing the three sets of data,\nwe were able to conclude that the data provided to the 6AC should not be used to calculate an attorney's\nhours worked. When that data is used, the calculation can drastically overstate an attorney's hours—\nparticularly if that attorney works in a firm with other attorneys.\nUpon further inspection, the data provided to the 6AC reflected all of the annual billings for attorneys listed\nas the court-assigned counsel. This was problematic for two reasons:\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 41\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\n1. Not all billings are time events. Other billing categories, such as mileage and some copy expenses,\nmay be reimbursed through vouchers via Defender Data. These types of expenses increase annual\nbilling totals—and subsequent calculations of weekly hours worked using those annual totals—to\nwhatever extent they occur and are then included in the data.\n2.  Of significantly greater importance is that while an attorney may be the Court-assigned counsel and\nalways recorded as such in Defender Data, the reality is that the assigned counsel is not always the\nattorney actually performing the work and entering and billing for that work via Defender Data. It is\nunclear to OPEGA how or why the data provided to the 6AC was aggregated by annual billing\ndollars and attorneys listed as assigned counsel, but we note that using this data instead of timed\nevents by work attorney to calculate attorneys' average weekly hours, inaccurately includes non-time\nexpenses and potentially misattributes the work hour of several attorneys to only one attorney.\nTo illustrate the effect of misattributing the work hours of multiple attorneys working on a case to only the\nassigned attorney, we selected the most prominent example of high weekly hours cited in the 6AC report—\nAttorney 2 receiving $307,381 in annual pay from MCILS in FY16 representing 98.52 hours worked per\nweek. Using the data provided to 6AC,w e identified Attorney 2 and then queried the OPEGA-obtained data\nset to identify total FY16 payments for time events on cases in which that attorney was the assigned counsel\nand any other attorneys whose work or payments would be captured in that total (but misattributed to\nAttorney 2). The results of that query are presented in Table 1.\nTable 1: Comparison of 6AC and OPEGA Example FY16 Attorney Billing Attributions\n6AC OPEGA\nAttorney FY16 Annual Pay Assigned Attorney Work Attorney FY16 Amount\nAttorney 2 Attorney 2 $  152,329.25\nAttorney 2 Attorney H $  41,381.25\nAttorney 2 Attorney I $  31,909.00\nAttorney 2 Attorney J $  18,688.25\nAttorney 2 Attorney K $  15,399.50\nAttorney 2 Attorney L $  12,674.00\nAttorney 2 Attorney M $  11,715.50\nAttorney 2 $  307,381.00 Attorney 2 Attorney N $  10,676.75\nAttorney 2 Attorney 0 $  10,625.25\nAttorney 2 Attorney P $  3,382.25\nAttorney 2 Attorney Q $  240.00\nAttorney 2 Attorney R $  155.50\nAttorney 2 Attorney S $  137.50\nTotal Paid on Vouchers In Which\nAttorney 2 Was The Assigned Attorney $  309,314.00\nSource: FY16 Table on Page 81 of 6AC report \"The Right to Counsel in Maine\" and OPEGA analysis of\nMCILS voucher data obtained from Justice Works.\nIn this case, analyzing FY16 payments by the assigned counsel and the attorney actually performing work on\nthose cases, paints a very different picture of Attorney 2's actual hours worked. Over half of the payments—\nand hours calculated by the 6AC—were for work performed by other attorneys.\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 42\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nOverall, we observed that misattributed earnings impacted many of the attorneys listed in the 6AC report,\nwhich included a table showing the top ten earners over the period as calculated from the data they obtained.\nUsing our data, we were able to remove payments for attorneys other than the assigned counsel working on\nthose cases. The 6AC's five-year totals for their top ten earners, as well as our five-year totals for those same\nten attorneys, are presented in Table 2.\nTable 2: Comparison of 6AC and OPEGA FY14-FY18 Total Attorney Billing Attributions By Attorney\n6AC OPEGA\nAttorney FY14 - FY18 Totals FY14 - FY18 Totals Difference\nAttorney 2 $  1,189,361.37 $  687,487.75 $  501,873.62\nAttorney 8 $  793,967.06 $  678,928.00 $  115,039.06\nAttorney 13 $  745,311.76 $  591,918.00 $  153,393.76\nAttorney 5 $  665,058.50 $  653,566.50 $  11,492.00\nAttorney 11 $  662,753.12 $  565,939.85 $  96,813.27\nAttorney 7 $  658,486.60 $  654,886.55 $  3,600.05\nAttorney 9 $  657,896.39 $  646,919.50 $  10,976.89\nAttorney 3 $  621,673.26 $  403,545.00 $  218,128.26\nAttorney 4 $  618,086.99 $  497,726.30 $  120,360.69\nAttorney 10 $  610,092.76 $  593,382.50 $  16,710.26\nSource: Five Year Summary Table on Page 83 of 6AC Report \"The Right to Counsel in Maine\" and\nOPEGA analysis of MCILS voucher data obtained from Justice Works.\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 43\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nBecause misattributed earnings were used to calculate hours per week, some of those figures—particularly among\nthe highest reported—were also overestimated. Using a similar methodology as the 6AC to calculate average hours\nworked per week, we calculated figures based on work attorney earnings. Table 3 shows the number of instances in\nwhich an attorney was calculated to have worked more than 40 hours per week as calculated by 6AC compared to\nthose instances we calculated using the OPEGA obtained data and stratified by ranges of hours.\nTable 3: Comparison of 6AC and OPEGA Distributions of Attorney Average Hours Worked Per Week By FY\nAverage FY14 FY15 FY16 FY17 FY18 5 YEAR TOTAL\nHours\nWorked\nPer\nWeek 6AC OPEGA 6AC OPEGA 6AC OPEGA 6AC OPEGA 6AC OPEGA 6AC OPEGA\n40-45 5 6 6 7 7 6 4 6 14 11 36 36\n45-50 2 0 3 3 1 1 4 5 6 15 10\n50-55 1 2 2 1 2 1 2 2 4 9\n55-60 1 2 1 1 1 2 4 4\n60-65 1 1 1 1 2 3 3\n65-70 1 1 1 1 2 2\n70-75 1 1 1 1 3 1\n75-80 0 0\n80-85 1 0 1\n85-90 2 2 0\n90-95 1 1 0\n95-100 1 1 0\nTotal 11 9 12 13 12 10 11 9 25 25 71 66\nSource: Annual Tables on Pages 80 - 82 of 6AC report \"The Right to Counsel in Maine\" and OPEGA analysis of\nMCILS voucher data obtained from Justice Works.\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 44\n\nMaine Commission on Indigent Legal Services\nAppendix D\nAdditional results of OPEGA's review of non-counsel invoices\nOPEGA also identified one instance in which an invoice for private investigation services was paid twice.\nPrivate investigation services, like other non-counsel services (expert witnesses, interpreters, etc.), are to be\npreapproved by either MCILS staff or the Court. The agency records these preapprovals in a series of\nspreadsheets with the court of record, docket number, attorney, defendant, vendor, and approved amount.\nThese spreadsheets are intended to serve as a control as paid amounts and remaining balances are tracked and\nrecorded. OPEGA reviewed 13 invoices comprising six different instances of potential duplicate (5\noccurrences) or triplicate (1 occurrence) payments. Within these six instances, we identified the following\nscenario in which a (partial) invoice was paid more than once:\n• 12/29/10: Court authorizes $1,000 for defendant to employ a private investigator.\n• 3/16/11: The defendant's attorney submits the private investigator's invoice. The invoice total is\n$1,411,32.\n• 4/5/11: MCILS Executive Director authorizes payment of $1,000 (presumably based on the\n12/29/10 order).\n• 4/12/11• MCILS Deputy Executive Director reviews the defendant's request for funds and\nauthorizes the expenditure of up to $411.32 nunc pro tunc13.\n• 4/14/11: MCILS Executive Director authorizes payment of $411.32.\n• 5/13/11: The defendant's attorney submits the private investigator's invoice with a note that the\nattached bill is for $411.32, as it is the remainder of the original invoice that had not been paid in full.\nThe line item descriptions (people, places, dates, and services) referenced on the invoice are the same\nas those cited on the 3/16/11 invoice.\n• 6/1/11: MCILS Executive Director authorizes payment of $411.32.\nThe preapproval spreadsheets have two entries for these services for this defendant and docket number: one\nfor $1,000 and one for $411.32. For these transactions, the control (the spreadsheet and its review) did not\nappear to catch the duplicate payment of $411.32.\n13 This term is commonly used in the legal system to indicate a ruling or order applies retroactively to an earlier\ndecision.\nOffice of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability  Page 45\n\n\n\nMAINE COMMISSION ON\nINDIGENT LEGAL SERVICES\nJohn D. Pelletier, Esquire\nExecutive Director\nOctober 15, 2020\nSenator Justin Chenette, Senate Chair\nRepresentative Anne-Marie Mastraccio, House Chair\nGovernment Oversight Committee\nDear Senator Chenette and Representative Mastraccio:\nAs chair of the Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services( MCILS), I write to\nacknowledge receipt of OPEGA's Confidential Draft Report, pursuant to Title 3 §997(1) of\nOPEGA statute. I am pleased to offer this formal agency comment in advance of the report's\nsubmission to the Government Oversight Committee and subsequent public hearings.\nThe eight current members of MCILS, all appointed by the Chief Executive, have been in\nplace since the fall of 2019. As we have undertaken to more fully understand the landscape of\nhow indigent legal services are provided in the State of Maine, a consensus has developed within\nthe Board that is largely consistent with the conclusions outlined by OPEGA staff. We wish to\nmake the following summary reply:\n1. The Commission has no disagreement with any of the actual facts stated in the report.\n2. There is gross underfunding for appropriate agency staffing.\n3. The significant inadequacies OPEGA has identified with respect to financial procedures\nand oversight structure cannot solely be attributed to inadequate funding.\n4.  More broadly, the five specific conclusions reached by OPEGA in Part H of its report are\nserious and require more urgent action by the Commission than that undertaken to date.\n5. The Commission largely agrees with the conclusions of OPEGA in Part III of its report\naddressing structure and oversight.\nAs further background,I  note that the \"new\" Commission has set up a number of Subcommittees\ntasked with particular areas of system operation. These include:\na. Subcommittee on Financial Oversight\nb. Subcommittee on Practice Standards\nc. Subcommittee on Training\nd. Subcommittee on Public Defender\nBefore implementing any specific changes to current operations, the Commission wanted\nto have the benefit of this OPEGA report. Armed with this review, as well as the thoughtful\nanalysis of the Sixth Amendment Center, the Commission feels well positioned to make the\nkinds of significant changes needed to accomplish its statutory mission.\n154 State House Station, Augusta, Maine 04333\n(207) 287-3257 •( 207) 287-3293 Fax\nwww.maine.gov/mcils \n\nWith specific reference to staffing, last October the Commission submitted its\nSupplemental Budget request to the Chief Executive to hire an additional attorney to enhance\ncapacity for training and supervision of attorneys and a person with financial and audit skills to\nimprove oversight of attorney billing. Further, a couple weeks ago, the Commission made a\nrequest to the Chief Executive for the upcoming biennial budget for additional staffing needed to\nfulfill our statutory mission. We are also looking at issues related to our current staffing.\nThe Government Oversight Committee should also understand that, consistent with key\nrecommendations in the Sixth Amendment Center Report, the Commission has recommended\nestablishing a Public Defender Office in one Maine county on a pilot basis. As Committee\nmembers may know, Maine is the only state in the country that does not provide indigent legal\nservices through a public defender's office in at least a portion of the state.\nFinally, we want to highlight that the current report addresses only two issues from\nOPEGA's work plan. The Commission's budget request addresses these issues, as well as the\nneed to better ensure the quality of representation to meet the statutory obligation to provide\nefficient, high-quality representation to indigent criminal defendants,j uvenile defendants and\nchildren and parents in child protective cases. We welcome the office's final report.\nWe thank you for your diligent interest in indigent legal services and look forward to\nparticipating in the public hearings around this report.\nRespectfully submitted,\nO fk\ns -s, \nJoshua A.

ANDRUS,E XECUTIVE DIRECTOR,M CILS\nSUBJECT:  MCILS RESPONSES TO THE OPEGA AND 6AC REPORTS\nDATE:  12/23/2021\nCC:  GOVERNOR;C HIEF JUSTICE;J UDICIARY CHAIRS; GOC CHAIRS; OPEGA\nMCILS began the year subject to oversight and interest related, in large measure,\nto reports published by OPEGA and by the Sixth Amendment Center. While those reports\ndo not necessarily encompass every change that MCILS can make to improve the\nprovisions of indigent legal services, the reports do serve as a useful guide to some oft hose\nimprovements.\nThroughout 2021, MCILS has worked to address as many of the shortcomings\nidentified in the two reports as possible. Most have been addressed, as follows:\n1\n\nI.  OPEGA Issues and Recommendations\nIssue 1.  There  are  no  established  policies  and  procedures  governing\nexpenditures and payments and MCILS's expectations for billing\npractices may not be effectively communicated to attorneys.\nRecommendation:  Formal policies and procedures should be established by\nMCILS management to better define allowable and covered expenses. These policies\nand procedures would clarify expectations for billing and invoicing practices that if\nproactively communicated, would improve the effectiveness of the system to approve\nexpenditures and process payments to rostered attorneys and non- counsel service\nproviders.\nMCILS has updated its Chapter 301 to make changes to, and to provide clarity\nabout, the rules, practices, and expectations for billing attorney time and certain non-\ncounsel expenses.' MCILS anticipates adopting amended Chapter 301 on December 28\",\nexcepting the attorney rate change.  That change is subject to legislative review, and\nadoption on December 28' will be provisional.\nIn the meantime, MCILS has published Defender Data usages standards2 and\nguidance on the nature and expectations of the relationship between MCILS and counsel.3\nMCILS updated its Chapter 302 governing non-counsel service providers in August\n2021. A revised process for requesting non-counsel funds is in development.\nSee attachment A.\nSee attachment B.\n2 \nSee attachment C.\n3 \n2\n2\n\nIssue 2.  Data available to MCILS staff via Defender Data is unreliable and\npotentially misleading\nRecommendation:  The quality of available data in terms of consistency, accuracy,\nand reliability could be improved in several ways if the agency undertakes the\nfollowing interrelated initiatives:\nEstablish and communicate expectations and guidance outlining how time\nevents are to be recorded in Defender Data to improve the consistency of the\ndata;\nMCILS has published its expectations to eligible counsel.\n• work with Justice Works to develop data-entry controls that reflect newly-\nestablished expectations and provide guidance to correct potential data issues,\nor errors, when they occur; and correct data errors within Defender Data at\nthe time they are identified...\nThe MCILS contract with Justice Works for the current implementation of\nDefender Data is in its final extension. That implementation is of a legacy version of the\nsoftware that will be deprecated shortly. MCILS is working to develop updated data-entry\ncontrol concepts for implementation in the new case management and billing system.\nMCILS is actively working with Maine IT to finalize the RFP for the new system. The\ncurrent specification document is attached.\nSee attachment D.\n4 \n3\n3\n\nIssue 3.  Current efforts to monitor attorney vouchers are inefficient and of\nlimited effectiveness.\nRecommendation:  Assuming improvements are made to the overall quality of\nMCILS's attorney voucher data, the agency should reevaluate its process for\nreviewing attorney vouchers with the objective of improving both effectiveness and\nefficiency. At a minimum, the following process attributes should be considered by\nMCILS in reevaluating and potentially redesigning its attorney voucher review\nprocess.\nThe process should identify, investigate and, as necessary, address the types of\ninstances with the greatest potential impacts to financial stewardship and the\nquality of representation— high daily and annual hours worked by attorney.\nThe next MCILS case management system, expected in FY23, will report on both\nhigh and low periodic attorney-hours.\nThe process should utilize technology to identify and correct potential data\nentry errors when they occur, such as flagging the input of values in excess of\nestablished limits, instead of relying on manual review of vouchers to identify\npotential errors.\nThe MCILS system design calls for these flags. MCILS expects this function to be\npart of the next MCILS case management system, expected in FY23.\n• The process should incorporate data and risk-based audit techniques to the\ngreatest extent possible to potentially reduce the burden placed on the\nExecutive Director and Deputy Executive Director by the manual review of\nvouchers—allowing them to focus on other important, but neglected, aspects\nof MCILS's purpose as discussed in Part III.\nMCILS, through its Audit Counsel, is developing a data and risk-based audit\nsystem, to permit meaningful sampling of voucher data. The audit system is more fully\ndescribed in the documents attached as E - H.\n4\n\nAdditionally, we note that transitioning from a voucher-based payment system\nto a timecard-based payment system may address issues related to the\ntimeliness and accuracy of daily hours worked.\nMCILS agrees with OPEGA that a timecard-based periodic billing system would\nbring benefits to the system from both an accuracy-oversight perspective, and from an\nattorney satisfaction perspective.  Moving to that system would require a substantial\nadditional appropriation for the year of the transition, however.\nMCILS currently has an arrears-billed relationship with assigned counsel. Counsel\nbill at the end of a case, or at an intermediate trigger point. Time accrues in each case.\nImplementation of a timecard-based payment system would requirement payment of all the\naccrued time during the first payment cycle.  MCILS would be able to make those\npayments. Doing so would exhaust its payment budget, however. Additional payments\nwould require an additional appropriation.\nIssue 4.  Invoice-level  review  of non-counsel invoices  may be of limited\neffectiveness in identifying certain types of noncompliance.\nRecommendation: Development of a broader audit/review procedure for non-counsel\ninvoices and periodic use of a risk-based method to select and review invoices would\nallow the agency to identify and correct instances of inappropriate high daily billings,\nduplicate  charges, duplicate  payments, and  potentially,  other  instances  of\nnoncompliance.\nMCILS expects to produce and implement an audit and review procedure for non-\ncounsel invoices in or about April 2022, after implementation of the counsel-fee audit\nstructure is accomplished. As it stands, MCILS accounting staff review every non-counsel\ninvoice. Staff identifies errors and requires correction by non-counsel providers before\npayment.\n5\n5\n\nIssue 5. Defined policies and procedures for audit and investigation have not\nbeen established. Current methods used by MCILS are limited,\ninconsistent, and of limited scope, depth and effectiveness.\nRecommendation: Establishment of a formal audit process would serve as a more\neffective control than the current methods used by the agency and would provide for\nconsistency in enforcement efforts. A more effective process could include policies and\nprocedures that would guide the agency regarding:\n• how and when audits are to be conducted;\n• the records to be maintained by attorneys (and other non-counsel service\nproviders) for potential MCILS review;\n• a means of determining, confirming, and/or settling disputed overpayment\namounts;\n• a mechanism to recoup overpayments;\n• penalties (including dismissal from the MCILS roster)f or noncompliance; and\n• consistent enforcement of all MCILS rules.\nMCILS has developed and is implementing a formal audit process for attorney fees.\nFull implementation is expected by March 31, 2022. A formal process for non-counsel\nrequests and invoices will follow. Documentation of a formal investigative process will\nbe presented to the Commission at or before its January 2022 meeting, together with a\nproposed updated appellate review structure. Work is ongoing on the question of\nadministrative recoupment. For the moment, MCILS would rely on the Court to provide\nthe venue for a recoupment action. MCILS is enforcing its rules, including through\ndismissal from the MCILS rosters for noncompliance.\nIssue 6. The agency charged with administering MCILS purpose is under-\nstaffed.\nIt remains the case that MCILS is under-staffed. Oft he six positions authorized by\nthe legislature, MCILS has filled four. Even when all six positions are filled, however,\nMCILS will remain understaffed to provide adequate supervision.  National standards\nsupport a supervisory ratio of 10:1 and assume that supervisors are working in the same\noffices as the defenders being supervised. To provide proper field oversight, MCILS would\nrequire significant additional staffing. That staffing level should reflect both the number of\nattorneys in need of supervision, and their geographic dispersal.\n6\n6\n\nIssue 7.  MCILS staff operates without clearly defined roles and uses current\nstaff inefficiently.\nCurrently, MCILS staff have clearly defined roles, with limited overlap.\nIssue 8.  The Commission receives insufficient support for necessary operations.\nMCILS expects to be able to meet its current and projected operational expenses\nfor the FY22-23 biennium with current funding. To meet some of goals set for MCILS,\nhowever, additional funding and headcount will be necessary.\nIssue 9.  A weak oversight structure impacts the ability of MCILS to\nadequately meet its statutory purpose.\nMCILS is improving its oversight structure, primarily through the installation of\nfour new attorney-administrators. Indigent defense would benefit from the addition of\nfield trainers and supervisors under the next budget, however.\n7\n7\n\nII.  Recommendations of the Sixth Amendment Center:\nRECOMMENDATION 1: The State of Maine should remove the authority to\nconduct financial eligibility screenings from the Maine Commission for Indigent\nLegal Services. The reconstituted Task Force on Pretrial Justice Reform should\ndetermine the appropriate agency to conduct indigency screenings.\nMCILS supported legislation that would have removed its authority to conduct\nfinancial eligibility screenings. LD 1685 as drafted contained proposed 4 MRSA §8-D.5\nThe bill would have transferred the financial screening function from MCILS to the\nJudicial Branch and would have eliminated MCILS involvement in collection actions\nagainst indigent clients. This section was deleted before other provisions of LD 1685 were\nenacted.\nResolution of this recommendation requires legislative action and cannot be\naccomplished by MCILS without that support.\nRECOMMENDATION 2: The State of Maine should statutorily bar communication\nbetween prosecutors and unrepresented defendants, unless and until defendants have\nbeen informed of their right to appointed counsel, a judge has conducted the legally\nrequired colloquy, and a defendant has executed a written waiver of the right to\ncounsel in each case to ensure that all waivers of the right to counsel are made\nknowingly and voluntarily.\nThe legislature enacted 15 MRSA §815, prohibiting most communication between\nprosecutors and unrepresented defendants, absent a knowing waiver.  Most or all\nprosecution offices now refer unrepresented defendants to MCILS for information.\nMCILS has been able to provide basic legal information to callers, without providing legal\nadvice, and  to  facilitate  early  assignment of counsel  in  partial  resolution  of\nrecommendation 3, below. MCILS is actively working on a program that will allow those\nunrepresented defendants who make contact to receive the benefit of early advice and\nassignment of counsel.\nSee attachment I.\n5 \n8\n8\n\nMCILS was recently asked by CLAC for its opinion on proposed amendments to\n§815. MCILS supports the amendments proposed on the attached draft.6\nSee attachment J.\n6 \n9\n9\n\nRECOMMENDATION 3: Except for ministerial, non-substantive tasks, the State of\nMaine and the Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services should require that the\nsame properly qualified defense counsel continuously represents the client in each\ncase, from appointment through disposition, and personally appears at every court\nappearance throughout the pendency of an assigned case.\nMCILS implemented a continuous representation policy requiring informed client\nconsent before counsel may delegate representation to another person and prohibiting\ndelegation of enumerated dispositive appearances?\nRECOMMENDATION 4: MCILS should use its  current statutory power to\npromulgate  more  rigorous  attorney  qualification,  recertification,  training,\nsupervision, and workload standards. The State of Maine should statutorily require\nfinancial oversight by requiring that MCILS limit the number of permissible billable\nhours, subject to waiver only upon a finding of need for additional capacity. The State\nof Maine should fund MCILS at a level to ensure rigorous training and effective\nsubstantive and financial oversight of attorneys.\nMCILS was unable to made effective progress on redrafting its standards until\nadditional staff came on-board.  Four new staff are now on-board and have begun a\ncomprehensive review of existing MCILS rules and standards. We anticipate updating the\nrules to implement standards that will begin to address this recommendation by July 1,\n2022.\nRECOMMENDATION 5: The State of Maine should statutorily ban all public\ndefense contracts that provide financial disincentives to or that otherwise interfere\nwith zealously advocating on behalf of the defendants' stated interests, including the\nuse of fixed fee contracts Maine should require that any public defense contract\ninclude reasonable caseload limits, reporting requirements on any private legal work\npermitted, and substantial performance oversight, among other protections.\nPublic defense contracts of the type specified in recommendation 5 have not yet\nbeen statutorily banned, however, MCILS does not now make use of any such contracts.\nSee attachment K.\n7 \n10\n10\n\nRECOMMENDATION 6: The State of Maine should fund MCILS at a level that\nallows private attorneys to be compensated for overhead expenses plus a reasonable\nfee (i.e., $100 per hour). MCILS should be authorized to provide additional\ncompensation of $25 per hour for designated case types such as murder, sexual\nassaults, and postconviction review.\nThe Legislature approved funding to increase the attorney compensation rate to $80\nper hour under the current budget.  MCILS continues to support increasing the\ncompensation rate to at least $100 per hour and supports authorization to provide additional\ncompensation for designated case types.\nRECOMMENDATION 7: The State of Maine should authorize and fund MCILS at\nan appropriate level to employ state government attorneys and support staff to\noperate a statewide appellate defender office and a Cumberland County trial level\npublic defender office.\nThe Legislature did not fund the initiation of any statewide or local public defender\noffices. A hybrid model using both contracted and employed counsel would permit the\nmost flexibility in staffing cases and promote the most effective representation for indigent\nclients. MCILS expects to renew its request for employed counsel for the next biennial\nbudget.\n11\n11\n\nEXHIBIT 5\n\nTO:  COMMISSION\nFROM:  JUSTIN ANDRUS,E XECUTIVE DIRECTOR\nSUBJECT:  ABA TEN PRINCIPLES\nDATE:  1/7/2021\nCC:\nAssessment of MCILS adherence to the American Bar Association's\nTen Principles of a Public Defense Delivery\nIn assessing its own performance, MCILS turns to the American Bar Association's\nTen Principles of a Public Defense Delivery system for guidance. The Sixth Amendment\nCenter's April 2019 report on The Right to Counsel in Maine, providing useful insight into\nthe then-current state of indigent defense in Maine, casts much of its comment in the light\nof those principles.  In February 2020 the MCILS Subcommittee on Public Defender\nProgram promulgated its  memorandum reporting its findings (the \"Subcommittee\nReport\"). That report was also framed by the ABA principles. MCILS continues to use\nthe principles to frame this discussion:\n1. The public defense function,i ncluding the selection, funding, and payment\nof defense counsel, is independent.\nThe ABA comment to Principle 1 states in part that the public defense function\nshould be independent from political influence and subject to judicial supervision only in\nthe same manner and to the same extent as retained counsel.\nThe Subcommittee Report recognized that the through the creation of MCILS,\nindependence from direct judicial control of indigent defense through the judicial budget\nwas accomplished but noted that there were outstanding issue impacting independence. In\nparticular, the Subcommittee noted that the judiciary still controlled the assignment of\nlawyers; and, that MCILS spent what the report characterized as, \"an inordinate amount of\ntime\" diverting its collective attention to funding.\nThese issues remain outstanding. MCILS has made some progress on the issue of\nindependence in the assignment of counsel by implementing a process permitting internal\nassignments in appropriate cases. That internal process is effective in those cases to which\n\nit is applied but is only applied infrequently because most cases in which assignment is\nappropriate remain subject to judicial selection of counsel.\nMCILS should transition to a properly funded and supported model in which\npotential consumers of indigent legal services are advised of the opportunity to apply for\nassigned counsel, and then screened for eligibility by an external screening process.\nMatters in which a consumer has been deemed eligible for assigned counsel should then\nbe communicated from the Court's electronic case management system directly to the\nMCILS electronic case management system. MCILS would then assign the case. This\nwould be consistent with the comment to Principle 2, that, \"[t]he appointment process\nshould never be ad hoc, but should be according to a coordinated plan directed by a full-\ntime administrator who is also an attorney familiar with the varied requirements of practice\nin the jurisdiction.\" This change in process would be agnostic as to whether fulfillment of\nthe assignment was performed by contracted or employed attorneys.\nThe issue of funding remains as well.  MCILS appreciates the support of the\nLegislature last session, and the ongoing interest of many legislators. Still, MCILS staff\nspends a lot of time working to foster support. More problematic, MCILS must make\noperational decisions that impact the quality and availability of client services based on\npresent and anticipated political environments.\nTo solve these issues, MCILS funding should be statutorily defined based on a\nstate-wide per-capita funding level consistent with an adequate defense function and\nrevised based on changes to the state-wide cost of business. MCILS should maintain a\nnon-lapsing account with trust-like rules to address fluctuations in costs.  The account\ncould be initially funded with a small fraction of the current surplus. Operational savings\nwould be deposited to the account, and unusual operating costs could be debited from the\naccount.\n2. Where the caseload is sufficiently high, the public defense delivery system\nconsists of both a defender office and the active participation of the private\nbar.\nThe availability of counsel to provide services to consumers of indigent legal\nservices has been a recurrent theme for MCILS in both its internal and external\ncommunications this year.  The number of attorneys eligible and willing to receive\nassignments has fluctuated, reaching a low over the summer and rebounding this fall and\nearly winter. The MCILS bar has worked diligently to serve indigent clients. Every case\nhas been staffed successfully.\nStill, there have been times identifying counsel who are both eligible and willing\nhas required a search, and others when local counsel have been unavailable and thus distant\ncounsel has been assigned. MCILS would be best able to provide efficient, high-quality\nrepresentation to consumers if it had the ability to allocate cases between both the existing\nprivate bar and employee attorneys.\n2\n\nThrough its initiatives request in late 2020, and through testimony to legislatives\ncommittees in early 2021, MCILS asked that it be funded for \"pilot\" defender programs.\nThese programs might be better characterized as \"start-up\" programs. They are intended\nto be permanent, rather than experimental in nature. MCILS should be permitted to pursue\nthese programs.\nThe availability of both private and employed counsel should permit MCILS\noperational flexibility in staffing cases. The option of becoming employed counsel should\npromote retention in the defense bar by making the benefits of State employment available\nto those defense counsel who elect to that employment (See Principle 8), while also\npromoting retention of skilled and experience counsel who prefer to remain independent.\nWhile under the MCILS initiative the first defender office would be in Augusta,\nthat office should have the option of hiring, training, and supervising a set of defenders\navailable to travel to staff cases if necessary.\n3. Clients are screened for eligibility, and defense counsel is assigned and\nnotified of appointment, as soon as feasible after clients' arrest, detention,\nor request for counsel.\nThe Subcommittee Report commented that MCILS failed with respect to this\nprinciple, in part, because of the delay in assignments through judicial action.  A\nrecommendation for addressing that issue is set out above. There is an additional issue,\nhowever, in that there are often long delays between when a consumer is arrested or\ncharged, and the initial appearance.\nMCILS should be resourced and authorized to oversee a process whereby\nconsumers are advised early of the right to counsel, including by law enforcement, and\nreferred to a centralized MCILS attorney. That attorney should be able to provide baseline\nlegal information and, where possible, to facilitate the early assignment of counsel.\n4. Defense counsel is provided sufficient time and a confidential space within\nwhich to meet with the client.\nThe comment to Principle 4 states that:\nCounsel should interview the client as soon as practicable before the\npreliminary examination or the trial date. Counsel should have confidential\naccess to the client for the full exchange of legal, procedural, and factual\ninformation  between  counsel  and  client.  To  ensure  confidential\ncommunications, private meeting space should be available in jails, prisons,\ncourthouses, and other places where defendants must confer with counsel.\n3\n\nThe Subcommittee Report noted that MCILS did not provide sufficient oversight\nto ensure that this principle was met, and noted concern with attorney communications in\ncourthouses, particularly for lawyers of the day.\nLR #2256 is currently pending before the legislature. Proposed 15 MRSA §458(1)\nprovides a person summonsed, arrested, charged, or indicted the opportunity for\nconfidential communications with counsel in preparation for and during appearances, in a\nmanner that cannot be overheard of monitored by another person. MCILS supports LR\n#2256. Passage would ameliorate the conditions that contribute to issues of confidentiality\nin jails and courthouses.\nMCILS still needs further support for its supervision mission to be able to ensure\nthat assigned  counsel can provide both time and confidential space for client\ncommunications outside of the jails and courthouses.\n5. Defense counsel's workload is controlled to permit the rendering of\nquality representation.\nAt the time of the Subcommittee Report, the MCILS case and workloads were\nuncontrolled. The Subcommittee noted that MCILS could not control work that assigned\ncounsel might perform outside of the MCILS program.\nSince the Report was issued, MCILS has implemented program changes to permit\nattorneys to control their individual caseloads.  MCILS has shifted from the historical\nmonthly roster concept to a near real-time system in which attorney eligibility and\navailability update daily. Under this system, counsel are able to indicate to the Courts that\nthey should not be assigned cases during periods in which counsel are either unable or\nunwilling to accept new work.\nMCILS is in the process of updating or replacing its case management system.\nWith the new system, and appropriate instructions and requirements around its use, MCILS\nwill be able to determine on a timely and ongoing basis whether an attorney has the\nbandwidth to accept additional assigned cases. As part of that process, MCILS should\npromulgate rules that required attorneys with practices divided between indigent legal\nservices and private practice to specify the proportion of each type of work. The MCILS\ncaseload standards should then be adjusted proportionately to ensure that counsel\nworkloads are appropriate.\nThe ability of MCILS to manage meet this principle is dependent on a functional,\nreal-time interface with the Court's electronic case management system.\n4\n\n6. Defense counsel's ability, training, and experience match the complexity of\nthe case.\nThe ABA comment to Principle 6 holds that, \"Counsel should never be assigned a\ncase that counsel lacks the experience or training to handle competently, and counsel is\nobligated to refuse appointment if unable to provide ethical, high quality representation.\"\nThe Subcommittee Report held that MCILS was not upholding Principle 6 in 2020.\nToday, MCILS is meeting its duties under statute and its rules to ensure that\nindigent consumers are served by qualified counsel in every case, while working to develop\nand promote higher standards. During the 2021 session, the legislature granted MCILS the\nauthority to implement revised standards for attorney qualification.  MCILS expects to\nexercise that authority through an updated ruleset in 2022.\nIn the meantime, MCILS continues to operate under the legislatively approved set\nof attorney qualifications.  The MCILS case management system prevents automatic\napproval of any instance in which counsel has not been designated eligible for provide\nservice. MCILS staff then follow up with counsel to determine whether an actual eligibility\nconflict exists, and to resolve that conflict in a manner that ensures each client receives\neligible counsel.\n7. The same attorney continuously represents the client until completion of\nthe case.\nThe Sixth Amendment Center report recommended that MCILS improve the quality of\nservice to its consumers by requiring that except for ministerial, non-substantive tasks, the same\nproperly qualified defense counsel continuously represent the client in each case, from appointment\nthrough disposition, and personally appear at every court appearance throughout the pendency of\nan assigned case.\nMCILS promulgated a policy in 2021 to ensure vertical representation, while providing a\nmechanism for obtaining informed client consent for the delegation of non-substantive appearances\nin appropriate instances. The policy requires that eligible, properly assigned counsel represent each\nclient at substantive appearances.  This policy implements the recommendation of the Sixth\nAmendment Center and approximates adherence to the ABA Principle.\nThe MCILS lawyer of the day program remains in effect at this time. The Subcommittee\nReport found that the lawyer of the day program was problematic because counsel for a client's\ninitial appearance would not necessarily serve the client throughout the case. MCILS is working\nto address this issue. The lawyer oft he day program will be modified to permit the early assignment\nof permanent counsel where possible, including in as many instances as possible prior to the initial\nappearance.\nTo accomplish the goal of providing vertical representation, MCILS will need the\nassistance of the Courts to fully integrate each respective case management system. This would\npermit MCILS to become aware of cases in need of assignment earlier, and in a form that would\npermit matching with eligible counsel.\n5\n\n8. There is parity between defense counsel and the prosecution with respect to\nresources and defense counsel is included as an equal partner in the justice\nsystem.\nThe ABA Comment to Principle 8 states that:\nThere should be parity of workload, salaries, and other resources (such as benefits,\ntechnology, facilities, legal research, support staff, paralegals, investigators, and\naccess to forensic services and experts) between prosecution and public defense.\nAssigned counsel should be paid a reasonable fee in addition to actual overhead\nand expenses. Contracts with private attorneys for public defense services should\nnever be let primarily on the basis of cost; they should specify performance\nrequirements and the anticipated workload, provide an overflow or funding\nmechanism for excess, unusual, or complex cases, and separately fund expert,\ninvestigative, and other litigation support services. No part of the justice system\nshould be expanded, or the workload increased without consideration of the impact\nthat expansion will have on the balance and on the other components of the justice\nsystem. Public defense should participate as an equal partner in improving the\njustice system. This principle assumes that the prosecutor is adequately funded and\nsupported in all respects, so that securing parity will mean that defense counsel is\nable to provide quality legal representation.\nIn 2020 the Subcommittee Report noted that there is no parity between assigned counsel\nand the state, nor was the defense function an equal partner in the system. The Subcommittee wrote\nthat,\" In short, the Commission is at present not representative of an essential third leg of the three-\nlegged stool that is the criminal justice system.\"\nIn 2021 MCILS made strides toward accomplishing parity, but there is still a long way to\ngo.  Legislative support for MCILS and assigned counsel permitted a radical improvement in\nquality assurance and oversight but fell short ofp roviding MCILS with the resources it and assigned\ncounsel need to achieve genuine parity.\nFor example, the payment rate for assigned counsel was increased from $60 to $80 per\nhour this year. This increase alleviated some burden for counsel. It is universally appreciated.\nThat increase, however, does not allow defense counsel to practice with the same resources as\nattorneys for state. MCILS is seeking data from assigned counsel to quantify the expenses state-\nwide and expects to publish a report on that data in early 2022.\nEven without that data, however, the gulf between the practice conditions of assigned\ncounsel and their state-employed peers is stark. In 2020, the legislature gave MCILS permission\nto hire two paralegals to support its operations. Those paralegals would be paid $40,463, with\nfringe benefits costs of $38,500, for a total of $78,963 per position, excluding equipment costs.\nThat is an effective hourly cost of $39 per hour, of effectively half of the $80 gross payment\nassigned counsel receive per hour. At that rate MCILS has been unable to attract appropriate\ncandidates to its positions, and they remain unfilled, suggesting that those rates are low for the labor\nmarket. Even if assigned counsel could hire staff at that rate, however, only $41 per hour would\nremain for counsel to operate law firm, obtain benefits, and earn take-home pay. Defenders thus\ncannot hire staff but must litigate cases against District Attorney offices equipped with up to three\nsupport staff per attorney.\n6\n\nMCILS asked to hire employee-defenders in the last session. The junior defenders were\nintended to bring parity with assistant district attorneys. Those defenders would have been paid\n$70,720, with fringe costs of $49,907, totaling $120, 627 each — an effective only rate of $60 per\nhour.\nIn other words, defender parity requires an hourly rate of $100 per hour simply to make\npayroll.  Rent, equipment, insurance, legal research software, books, communications, internet\naccess, and other expenses would still not be accounted for at that rate.\nMCILS should be funded to permit true parity between prosecution and defense offices.\nIn addition, MCILS must increase the rate of pay for investigators to a rate that allows functional\nequivalence to law enforcement, on at least a per-case basis.\nEliminating the resource disparity between the defense and prosecution functions is only\npart of the solution, however. Unlike the prosecution, MCILS has not been treated a full partner in\nthe justice system. That must change. MCILS should be designated by statute as the core of the\ndefense function, and should be included at every level of dialogue, planning, and policy making.\nMCILS has appreciated the access the Court have provided, particularly at the leadership level, but\nthat access must of right, and carry the same force as the prosecution.\nThis parity in the power structure is essential in any function defense system but is\nespecially vital in Maine. Much is made oft he fact that Maine is the only state that relies on private\nattorneys for all of it defense function. Much of the discussion around that fact carries a negative\nconnotation. The reality, however, is that Maine is fortunate to have a legal culture in which private\nattorneys are willing to invest their time and energy in providing what is ultimately the State's\nobligation. MCILS attorneys are diligent, conscientious, believers injustice. They are, however,\nnot adequately recognized and represented in government. MCILS must be funded and authorized\nto fulfill that function.\n9. Defense counsel is provided with and required to attend continuing legal\neducation.\nMCILS has historically been inconsistent in the training opportunities it can afford counsel.\nIn 2021, MCILS was granted authority to hire two attorney staff members to begin a true oversight\nand training function. Those staff members joined MCILS at the end of October, and have since\nthen been presenting legal education programs, and identifying outside programs for counsel. In\n2022, MCILS expects to obtain access to an outside library of national level programming, and to\nintegrate that material into its systems.\n7\n\n10. Defense counsel is supervised and systematically reviewed for quality and\nefficiency according to nationally and locally adopted standards.\nThe Subcommittee Report noted that in 2020 MCILS was unable to provide meaningful\nsupervision and systematic review oft he services performed by MCILS assigned counsel. In 2021,\nMCILS added the two staff position noted above. Those staff members have made significant\nprogress toward ensuring that counsel meet eligibility standards to support quality representation.\nIt has not yet been possible to develop a systematic process, however.  MCILS anticipates\ndeveloping that process in 2022.\nImplementation of that process will require additional resources, however. It will not be\npossible for the central office staff to perform a meaningful number of field evaluation, or to\nprovide direct support to attorneys.\nNational standards require one supervising attorney for every ten attorneys practicing with\na MI caseload. As of January 7, 2022, MCILS had approximately 300 attorneys representing\nindigent clients (of which approximately 280 were actively seeking additional case). Compliance\nwith a constitutionally sound supervision structure will require the addition of many field training\nand supervision staff. MCILS should be authorized and funded to employ that staff.\nIn addition, MCILS must have better access to information other participants in the process\nmay hold regarding attorney performance. To ensure quality, MCILS must receive information\nfrom prosecutors, clerks, and judges when MCILS assigned counsel do not perform adequately.\n8\n\nEXHIBIT 6\n\nTO:  COMMISSION\nFROM:  JUSTIN ANDRUS,E XECUTIVE DIRECTOR\nSUBJECT: ABA TEN PRINCIPLES\nDATE:  1/7/2021\nCC:\nAssessment of MCILS adherence to the American Bar Association's\nTen Principles of a Public Defense Delivery\nIn assessing its own performance, MCILS turns to the American Bar Association's\nTen Principles of a Public Defense Delivery system for guidance. The Sixth Amendment\nCenter's April 2019 report on The Right to Counsel in Maine, providing useful insight into\nthe then-current state of indigent defense in Maine, casts much of its comment in the light\nof those principles. In February 2020 the MCILS Subcommittee on Public Defender\nProgram promulgated its  memorandum reporting its  fmdings (the \"Subcommittee\nReport\"). That report was also framed by the ABA principles. MCILS continues to use\nthe principles to frame this discussion:\n1. The public defense function,i ncluding the selection,f unding, and payment\nof defense counsel, is independent.\nMCILS fails substantially with respect to this principle. The ABA comment to\nPrinciple 1 states in part that the public defense function should be independent from\npolitical influence and subject to judicial supervision only in the same manner and to the\nsame extent as retained counsel.\nThe Subcommittee Report recognized that the through the creation of MCILS,\nindependence from direct judicial control of indigent defense through the judicial budget\nwas accomplished but noted that there were outstanding issue impacting independence. In\nparticular, the Subcommittee noted that the judiciary still controlled the assignment of\nlawyers; and, that MCILS spent what the report characterized as,\" an inordinate amount of\ntime\" diverting its collective attention to funding.\nThese issues remain outstanding. MCILS has made some progress on the issue of\nindependence in the assignment of counsel by implementing a process permitting internal\nassignments in appropriate cases. That internal process is effective in those cases to which\n\nit is applied but is only applied infrequently because most cases in which assignment is\nappropriate remain subject to judicial selection of counsel.\nMCILS should transition to a properly funded and supported model in which\npotential consumers of indigent legal services are advised of the opportunity to apply for\nassigned counsel, and then screened for eligibility by an external screening process.\nMatters in which a consumer has been deemed eligible for assigned counsel should then\nbe communicated from the Court's electronic case management system directly to the\nMCILS electronic case management system. MCILS would then assign the case. This\nwould be consistent with the comment to Principle 2, that, \"[t]he appointment process\nshould never be ad hoc, but should be according to a coordinated plan directed by a full-\ntime administrator who is also an attorney familiar with the varied requirements of practice\nin the jurisdiction.\" This change in process would be agnostic as to whether fulfillment of\nthe assignment was performed by contracted or employed attorneys.\nThe issue of funding remains as well. MCILS appreciates the support of the\nLegislature last session, and the ongoing interest of many legislators. Still, MCILS staff\nspends a lot of time working to foster support. More problematic, MCILS must make\noperational decisions that impact the quality and availability of client services based on\npresent and anticipated political environments.\nTo solve these issues, MCILS funding should be statutorily defined based on a\nstate-wide per-capita funding level consistent with an adequate defense function and\nrevised based on changes to the state-wide cost of business. MCILS should maintain a\nnon-lapsing account with trust-like rules to address fluctuations in costs. The account\ncould be initially funded with a small fraction of the current surplus. Operational savings\nwould be deposited to the account, and unusual operating costs could be debited from the\naccount.\n2. Where the caseload is sufficiently high, the public defense delivery system\nconsists of both a defender office and the active participation of the private\nbar.\nThe State of Maine fails with respect to this principle as Maine remains the only\nstate in the United States without a defender office within its public defense delivery\nsystem. There can be no genuine dispute that Cumberland, Kennebec and Penobscot\nCounties do have a sufficiently high caseload to justify the implementation of a public\ndefender program in one or all of those counties. The availability of counsel to provide\nservices to consumers of indigent legal services has been a recurrent theme for MCILS in\nboth its internal and external communications this year. The number of attorneys eligible\nand willing to receive assignments has fluctuated, reaching a low over the summer and\nrebounding this fall and early winter. The MCILS bar has worked diligently to serve\nindigent clients. Every case has been staffed successfully.\nStill, there have been times identifying counsel who are both eligible and willing\nhas required a search, and others when local counsel have been unavailable and thus distant\ncounsel has been assigned. MCILS would be best able to provide efficient, high-quality\n2\n\nrepresentation to consumers if it had the ability to allocate cases between both the existing\nprivate bar and employee attorneys.\nThrough its initiatives request in late 2020, and through testimony to legislatives\ncommittees in early 2021, MCILS asked that it be funded for \"pilot\" defender programs.\nThese programs might be better characterized as \"start-up\" programs. They are intended\nto be permanent, rather than experimental in nature. MCILS should be permitted to pursue\nthese programs.\nThe availability of both private and employed counsel should permit MCILS\noperational flexibility in staffing cases. The option of becoming employed counsel should\npromote retention in the defense bar by making the benefits of State employment available\nto those defense counsel who elect to that employment (See Principle 8), while also\npromoting retention of skilled and experience counsel who prefer to remain independent.\nWhile under the MCILS initiative the first defender office would be in Augusta,\nthat office should have the option of hiring, training, and supervising a set of defenders\navailable to travel to staff cases if necessary.\n3. Clients are screened for eligibility, and defense counsel is assigned and\nnotified of appointment, as soon as feasible after clients' arrest, detention,\nor request for counsel.\nThe Subcommittee Report commented that MCILS failed with respect to this\nprinciple, in part, because of the delay in assignments through judicial action. The\nSubcommittee's assessment remains accurate today. A recommendation for addressing\nthat issue is set out above. There is an additional issue, however, in that there are often\nlong delays between when a consumer is arrested or charged, and the initial appearance.\nMCILS should be resourced and authorized to oversee a process whereby\nconsumers are advised early of the right to counsel, including by law enforcement, and\nreferred to a centralized MCILS attorney. That attorney should be able to provide baseline\nlegal information and, where possible, to facilitate the early assignment of counsel.\n4. Defense counsel is provided sufficient time and a confidential space within\nwhich to meet with the client.\nThe comment to Principle 4 states that:\nCounsel should interview the client as soon as practicable before the\npreliminary examination or the trial date. Counsel should have confidential\naccess to the client for the full exchange of legal, procedural, and factual\ninformation  between  counsel  and  client.  To  ensure  confidential\ncommunications, private meeting space should be available in jails, prisons,\ncourthouses, and other places where defendants must confer with counsel.\n3\n\nThe Subcommittee Report noted that MCILS did not provide sufficient oversight\nto ensure that this principle was met, and noted concern with attorney communications in\ncourthouses, particularly for lawyers of the day.\nAt the present time, MCILS continues to fail with respect to Principle 4, but LR\n#2256 is currently pending before the legislature to remedy the deficiency, at least in part\nProposed 15 MRSA §458(1)provides a person summonsed, arrested, charged, or indicted\nthe opportunity for confidential communications with counsel in preparation for and\nduring appearances, in a manner that cannot be overheard of monitored by another person.\nMCILS supports LR #2256. Passage would ameliorate the conditions that contribute to\nissues of confidentialityin jails and courthouses.\nMCILS still needs further support for its supervision mission to be able to ensure\nthat assigned  counsel can provide both time and confidential  space for  client\ncommunications outside of the jails and courthouses.\n5. Defense counsel's workload is controlled to permit the rendering of\nquality representation.\nAt the time of the Subcommittee Report, the MCILS case and workloads were\nuncontrolled. The Subcommittee noted that MCILS could not control work that assigned\ncounsel might perform outside of the MCILS program. While MCILS remains unable to\ncontrol assigned counsel's workload, MCILS is actively working on remedying that\ndeficiency.\nSince the Report was issued, MCILS has implemented program changes to permit\nattorneys to control their individual caseloads. MCILS has shifted from the historical\nmonthly roster concept to a near real-time system in which attorney eligibility and\navailability update daily. Under this system, counsel are able to indicate to the Courts that\nthey should not be assigned cases during periods in which counsel are either unable or\nunwilling to accept new work.\nMCILS is in the process of updating or replacing its case management system.\nWith the new system, and appropriate instructions and requirements around its use, MCILS\nwill be able to determine on a timely and ongoing basis whether an attorney has the\nbandwidth to accept additional assigned cases. As part of that process, MCILS should\npromulgate rules that required attorneys with practices divided between indigent legal\nservices and private practice to specify the proportion of each type of work. The MCILS\ncaseload standards should then be adjusted proportionately to ensure that counsel\nworkloads are appropriate.\nThe ability of MCILS to manage meet this principle is dependent on a functional,\nreal-time interface with the Court's electronic case management system.\n4\n\n6. Defense counsel's ability, training, and experience match the complexity of\nthe case.\nThe ABA comment to Principle 6 holds that, \"Counsel should never be assigned a\ncase that counsel lacks the experience or training to handle competently, and counsel is\nobligated to refuse appointment if unable to provide ethical, high quality representation.\"\nThe Subcommittee Report held that MCILS was not upholding Principle 6 in 2020. The\nsame remains true today.\nToday, MCILS is ensuring that lawyers considered \"qualified\" under MCILS rules\nare assigned to cases for which they are rostered and deemed qualified. But, what remains\ntrue at the current time is that the current MCILS rules for attorney qualification for\nappointments establishes a low barrier to entry. As the 6th Amendment found in its report:\nUnder MCILS' qualification requirements, an attorney who graduated from law\nschool two years ago and hung out their shingle in a private practice, with no\nsupervision or training, can have two jury trials and two judge trials and then be\nappointed to represent indigent defendants in every type of criminal case other than a\nhomicide or sex offense. More worrisome is that indigent defendants charged with\nClass E crimes, carrying up to six months in jail, can be represented by an attorney\nwho just received their bar card and completed a single training course in criminal\nlaw, as long as the lawyer has an email address, telephone number, and a\nconfidential space to meet with clients.\n(6th Amendment Center report on The Right to Counsel in Maine, at page IV of\nthe Executive Summary). In short, MCILS still does not ensure that every assigned\nlawyer has the necessary ability, training and experience necessary to handle the case\nassigned to them as MCILS still permits lawyers just out of law school with a one day\nCommission-sponsored or Commission-Approved training course to represent a person,\nwho, by definition, faces jail, involuntary confinement in a hospital, or the loss of custody\nof a child.\nDuring the 2021 session, the legislature granted MCILS the authority to implement\nrevised standards for attorney qualification. MCILS expects to exercise that authority\nthrough an updated ruleset in 2022.\nIn the meantime, MCILS continues to operate under the legislatively approved set\nof attorney qualifications. The MCILS case management system prevents automatic\napproval of any instance in which counsel has not been designated eligible for provide\nservice. MCILS staff then follow up with counsel to determine whether an actual eligibility\nconflict exists, and to resolve that conflict in a manner that ensures each client receives\neligible counsel.\n7. The same attorney continuously represents the client until completion of\nthe case.\n5\n\nThe Sixth Amendment Center report recommended that MCILS improve the\nquality of service to its consumers by requiring that except for ministerial, non-\nsubstantive tasks, the same properly qualified defense counsel continuously represent the\nclient in each case, from appointment through disposition, and personally appear at every\ncourt appearance throughout the pendency of an assigned case.\nMCILS promulgated a policy in 2021 to ensure vertical representation, while\nproviding a mechanism for obtaining informed client consent for the delegation of non-\nsubstantive appearances in appropriate instances. The policy requires that eligible, properly\nassigned counsel represent each client at substantive appearances. This policy implements\nthe recommendation of the Sixth Amendment Center and approximates adherence to the\nABA Principle.\nThe MCILS lawyer of the day program remains in effect at this time. The\nSubcommittee Report found that the lawyer of the day program was problematic because\ncounsel for a client's initial appearance would not necessarily serve the client throughout\nthe case. MCILS is working to address this issue. The lawyer of the day program will be\nmodified to permit the early assignment of permanent counsel where possible, including in\nas many instances as possible prior to the initialappearance.\nTo accomplish the goal of providing vertical representation, MCILS will need the\nassistance of the Courts to fully integrate each respective case management system. This\nwould permit MCILS to become aware of cases in need of assignment earlier, and in a\nform that would permit matching with eligible counsel.\n8. There is parity between defense counsel and the prosecution with respect\nto resources and defense counsel is included as an equal partner in the\njustice system.\nThe ABA Comment to Principle 8 states that:\nThere should be parity of workload, salaries, and other resources (such as\nbenefits, technology, facilities, legal research, support staff, paralegals,\ninvestigators, and access to forensic services and experts) between\nprosecution and public defense. Assigned counsel should be paid a\nreasonable fee in addition to actual overhead and expenses. Contracts with\nprivate attorneys for public defense services should never be let primarily\non the basis of cost; they should specify performance requirements and the\nanticipated workload, provide an overflow or funding mechanism for\nexcess,  unusual,  or  complex  cases,  and  separately  fund  expert,\ninvestigative, and other litigation support services. No part of the justice\nsystem  should  be  expanded, or  the  workload  increased  without\nconsideration of the impact that expansion will have on the balance and on\nthe other components of the justice system. Public defense should\nparticipate as an equal partner in improving the justice system. This\nprinciple assumes that the prosecutor is adequately funded and supported in\nall respects, so that securing parity will mean that defense counsel is able\n6\n\nto provide quality legal representation.\nIn 2020 the Subcommittee Report noted that there is no parity between assigned\ncounsel and the state, nor was the defense function an equal partner in the system. The\nSubcommittee wrote that, \"In short, the Commission is at present not representative of an\nessential third leg of the three- legged stool that is the criminal justice system.\" This\nremains true today.\nIn 2021 MCILS made strides toward accomplishing parity, but there is still a long\nway to go. Legislative support for MCILS and assigned counsel permitted a radical\nimprovement in quality assurance and oversight but fell short of providing MCILS with the\nresources it and assigned counsel need to achieve genuine parity.\nFor example, the payment rate for assigned counsel was increased from $60 to\n$80 per hour this year. This increase alleviated some burden for counsel. It is universally\nappreciated. That increase, however, does not allow defense counsel to practice with the\nsame resources as attorneys for state. MCILS is seeking data from assigned counsel to\nquantify the expenses state- wide and expects to publish a report on that data in early\n2022.\nEven without that data, however, the gulf between the practice conditions of\nassigned counsel and their state-employed peers is stark. In 2020, the legislature gave\nMCILS permission to hire two paralegals to support its operations. Those paralegals\nwould be paid $40,463, with fringe benefits costs of $38,500, for a total of $78,963 per\nposition, excluding equipment costs. That is an effective hourly cost of $39 per hour, of\neffectively half of the $80 gross payment assigned counsel receive per hour. At that rate\nMCILS has been unable to attract appropriate candidates to its positions, and they remain\nunfilled, suggesting that those rates are low for the labor market. Even if assigned counsel\ncould hire staff at that rate, however, only $41 per hour would remain for counsel to\noperate law firm, obtain benefits, and earn take-home pay. Defenders thus cannot hire\nstaff but must litigate cases against District Attorney offices equipped with up to three\nsupport staff per attorney.\n7\n\nMCILS asked to hire employee-defenders in the last session. The junior defenders\nwere intended to bring parity with assistant district attorneys. Those defenders would\nhave been paid\n$70,720, with fringe costs of $49,907, totaling $120, 627 each — an effective only rate of\n$60 perhour.\nIn other words, defender parity requires an hourly rate of $100 per hour simply to\nmake  payroll.  Rent,  equipment,  insurance,  legal  research  software,  books,\ncommunications, internet access, and other expenses would still not be accounted for at\nthat rate.\nMCILS should be funded to permit true parity between prosecution and defense\noffices. In addition, MCILS must increase the rate of pay for investigators to a rate that\nallows functional equivalence to law enforcement, on at least a per-case basis.\nEliminating the resource disparity between the defense and prosecution functions\nis only part of the solution, however. Unlike the prosecution, MCILS has not been treated\na full partner in the justice system. That must change. MCILS should be designated by\nstatute as the core of the defense function, and should be included at every level of\ndialogue, planning, and policy making. MCILS has appreciated the access the Court have\nprovided, particularly at the leadership level, but that access must of right, and carry the\nsame force as the prosecution.\nThis parity in the power structure is essential in any function defense system but\nis especially vital in Maine. Much is made of the fact that Maine is the only state that relies\non private attorneys for all of it defense function. Much of the discussion around that fact\ncarries a negative connotation. The reality, however, is that Maine is fortunate to have a\nlegal culture in which private attorneys are willing to invest their time and energy in\nproviding what is ultimately the State's obligation. MCILS attorneys are diligent,\nconscientious, believers in justice. They are, however, not adequately recognized and\nrepresented in government. MCILS must be funded and authorizedto fulfill that function.\n9. Defense counsel is provided with and required to attend continuing\nlegale ducation.\nMCILS has historically been inconsistent in the training opportunities it can afford\ncounsel. In 2021, MCILS was granted authority to hire two attorney staff members to\nbegin a true oversight and training function. Those staff members joined MCILS at the\nend of October, and have since then been presenting legal education programs, and\nidentifying outside programs for counsel. In 2022, MCILS expects to obtain access to an\noutside library of national level programming, and to integrate that material into its\nsystems. It remains true, however, that MCILS will most likely never be able to require\nattendance and adherence to a comprehensive multi-week orientation and training and\nongoing training and mentorship to assigned counsel as it would be able to provide to\nemployed  public  defenders.\n8\n\n10. Defense counsel is supervised and systematically reviewed for quality\nand efficiency according to nationally and locally adopted standards.\nThe Subcommittee Report noted that in 2020 MCILS was unable to provide\nmeaningful supervision and systematic review of the services performed by MCILS\nassigned counsel. In 2021, MCILS added the two staff position noted above. Those staff\nmembers have made significant progress toward ensuring that counsel meet eligibility\nstandards to support quality representation. It has not yet been possible to develop a\nsystematic process, however. MCILS continues to fail with respect to Principle 10, but\nMCILS anticipates working to remedying the deficiency in 2022.\nImplementation of that process will require additional resources, however. It will\nnot be possible for the central office staff to perform a meaningful number of field\nevaluation, or to provide direct support to attorneys.\nNational standards require one supervising attorney for every ten attorneys\npracticing with a full caseload. As of January 7, 2022, MCILS had approximately 300\nattorneys representing indigent clients (of which approximately 280 were actively\nseeking additional case). Compliance with a constitutionally sound supervision structure\nwill require the addition of many field training and supervision staff. MCILS should be\nauthorized and funded to employ that staff.\nMCILS \nIn addition,  must have better access to information other participants in the\nprocess may hold regarding attorney performance. To ensure quality, MCILS must\nreceive information from prosecutors, clerks, and judges when MCILS assigned counsel\ndo not perform adequately.\n9\n\nEXHIBIT 7\n\nMonday, February 28, 2022 at 19:46:56 Eastern Standard Time\nSubject:  FW: Additional document for Commission Meeting\nDate:  Monday, January 10, 2022 at 8:05:16 AM Eastern Standard Time\nFrom:  Maciag, Eleanor\nTo:  MCILS\nAttachments: 10 principles with revisions by RWS.docx, 6th Amendment Center May 2015 report on Actual\nDenial of Counsel in Misdemeanor Courts.pdf\nEXTERNAL MESSAGE:\nGood morning,\nPlease see additional materials below for today's MCILS Commission meeting.\nEllie\nFrom: Andrus, Justin <Justin.Andrus@maine.gov>\nSent: Monday, January 10, 2022 7:59 AM\nTo: Maciag, Eleanor <Eleanor.Maciag@maine.gov>\nSubject: FW: Additional document for Commission Meeting\nFrom: Ron Schneider <rschneider@bernsteinshur.com>\nSent: Monday, January 10, 2022 7:03 AM\nTo: Andrus, Justin <Justin.Andrus@maine.gov>\nSubject: re: Additional document for Commission Meeting\nEXTERNAL: This email originated from outside of the State of Maine Mail System. Do not click links or open\nattachments unless you recognize the sender and know the content is safe.\nGood morning Justin,\nI am sorry for the last minute email but I feel that it is probably important to put my thoughts about\nyour memo and the issues it addresses in a redline version. I appreciate your memo and truly appreciate\nthe steps you have taken and is taking to improve the broken system that you inherited. It is with regret\nthat I feel it is necessary to redline your memo in some places because I do not intend my comments to\nbe taken as a criticism of your or your burgeoning team's excellent work.\nWhen I worked on the Subcommittee memo, I felt it was -- and still feel that it is — very important to\nsay whether we were not living up to particular principles. The memo lacks such a statement for each\nprinciple. I contend that we are failing to satisfy at least Tor 8 of the 10 principles. You and your team\nare working hard on them, but if we are going to present an honest assessment of where we are now, I\nthink we have to admit and declare to those in government who receive the message that right now we\nstill are not living up to the principles.\nTalking about this issue remains a dicey proposition because any criticism of the \"system\" is portrayed\nas criticism of the lawyers within the system. Similarly, any criticism of any lawyers in the system is\ncharacterized as criticism of all lawyers in the system. It is simply not accurate to suggest that a\ncriticism of our system or some of the lawyers in it is an indictment of every lawyer in the system. It\nshould rather be accepted as a call to action to better the system and better support those who excel\ndespite it.(  When Rob Ruffner said that our system cannot take credit for the good work done by\nlawyers, he was right.)\nPage 1 of 3\n\nWe do not want to admit that there are lawyers receiving assignments who should not be receiving them\nor are not really ready to receive them, even though full-time defense lawyers and judges could name\nthem. In Maine, it remains true that a poor person can be assigned one of the best Maine has to offer\nand also a seriously substandard lawyer, and we still do not do what we must to ensure that the poor\nperson does not fall victim to the latter. The 6AC report was accurate when it declared that we have a\nlow bather to entry. Our basic eligibility requirements remain too low.\nWe are doing better than before MCILS was created. As early as 1974, it was recognized that Maine's\nstandards for criminal justice did not comply with those of the American Bar Association and the\nNational Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice. Before 2010, Maine had no application process for\nattorneys, no eligibility requirements for lawyers seeking appointment, no training for new court-\nappointed lawyers, no performance standards, no mandatory vehicle for defense-specific continuing\nlegal education, no administrator to ensure professional independence, and no other checks on attorneys\nthat the State appointed to represent the poor. But, we are not doing enough. Being qualified by MCILS\ndoes not mean that a lawyer is truly competent to provide the high quality representation that we are\ncharged with ensuring.\nWith respect to the discussion we will have today, I do think it is important to commit to writing a\nclarification about the 2015 6AC report that has been mentioned in our meetings. That report is\nattached. The report listed Maine's system as one of 15 states that was \"most likely\" not actively,\nactually denying counsel in misdemeanor courts, and only that. The report does not list Maine as one of\n15 states viewed as among the best organized systems for misdemeanor defendants.\nOn page 10, the report provides, \"Table II( next page) indicates the likelihood of which statewide\nsystems experience denial of counsel issues in misdemeanor cases. The first column shows those states\nwith statewide indigent defense systems and where local courts (if existent) are not allowed to\nprosecute misdemeanor cases carrying jail time. These 15 states are the states that most likely do not\nhave regularized actual denial of counsel issues in its lower courts..... To be clear, inclusion on either of\nthe first two columns does not mean that actual denial of counsel never happens in these jurisdictions —\njust that it is not likely to happen. Also, thef irst two columns in no way suggest that there are not\nissues with constructive denial of counsel issues in thesej   urisdictions, associated with excessive\ncaseloads, unduej  udicial interference, andf inancial conflicts of interests, among others.\"\nThe 2015 report was a result of a Congressional inquiry about the problem of actual denial of counsel\nacross the country. When the report was submitted to Congress, the 6AC had not studied Maine\nspecifically. The 6AC intentionally used \"most likely\" or \"most likely does not\" because they had not\nstudied all states in depth.\nWhen the 6AC did study Maine at the request of the Maine Legislature, they did find that actual and\nconstructive denial of counsel occurred frequently throughout Maine. The 6AC spent considerable time\nat tax-payers' expense and made conclusive findings that the system is structurally deficient. We cannot\nignore the 6AC Report and Recommendations.\nI have tremendous respect for lawyers who dedicate their considerable talents to represent the poor\nagainst the State, and I have tremendous respect for how difficult the work is. I believe we all share in\nthat respect. But, our respect for them cannot go so far as to cause us to ignore the deficiencies in the\n\"system\" within which they work or of some of the other lawyers with whom they work.\nRegards,\nRon\nPage 2 of 3\n\nRon Schneider\nShareholder\n207 228-7267 direct\n207 774-1200 main\n207 774-1127 fax\nMy Bio I LinkedIn I Twitter\nBERNSTEINSHUR\nPortland, ME I Manchester, NH I Augusta, ME I bernsteinshur.com\nConfidentiality notice: This message is intended only for the person to whom addressed in the text above and may contain privileged or\nconfidential information. if you are not that person, any use of this message is prohibited.
