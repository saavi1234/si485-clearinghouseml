    "summary": "<p>On July 17, 1975, the plaintiffs&ndash;&ndash;persons incarcerated at the Adolescent Reception and Detention Center (ARDC)&ndash;&ndash;filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the City of New York, its Department of Corrections, and relevant officials at the facility. Alleging a pattern or practice of constitutional violations, the plaintiffs sought to represent a class of similarly situated individuals and requested declaratory and injunctive relief. The case was assigned to Judge Gerard L. Goettel.</p>\r\n<p>Much of the case is unknown to the Clearinghouse, but the parties reached a settlement agreement on September 26, 1978. The settlement formalized investigation procedures following any incidents at the ARDC, laid out a recordkeeping system as to correctional officers, and established a grievance procedure for incarcerated persons. Moreover, the agreement set forth guidelines for staff discipline, attorney access, and language accommodations.</p>",

D'Elia  et  al.  is  a  class  action  lawsuit  brought  on  behalf  of  all  inmates \nat  ARDC.  The  case  is  about  incidents  of  violence  between  officers  and  inmates  at  ARDC \n   and  the  way  in  which  the  staff  at  ARDC  and  the  Department  of  Correction  investigate \n    \nthose  incidents. \nThe  attorneys  for  the  class  of  all  inmates  at  ARDC  and  the  attorneys  for  the  City \not  New  York  have  reached  agreement  on  a  proposed  settlement  of  the  case.  A  complete \ncopy  of  the  proposed  settlement  can  be  obtained  from  the  attorneys  for  the  inmates. \nTheir  names  are  listed  at  the  end  of  this  notice.  Summarized  below  are  the  procedures \nthat  will  be  followed  under  the  proposed  settlement  whenever  any  inmate  is  injured  in \nany  future  incident  between  officers  and  inmates: \nl,  Every  time  an  inmate  is  injured  by  an  officer,  within  12  hours,  the  Central  Investi- \ngations  Unit  (also  known  as  the  Inspector  General)  of  the  Department  of  Correction  must \nbegin  an  investigation.  The  Central  Investigations  Unit  is  a  special  division  of  the  Depart- \nment.  It  has  its  office  at  100  Centre  Street.  It  is  responsible  among  other  things  for \ninvestigating  charges  of  wrongdoing  by  members  of  the  Department. \n2  The  investigation  by  the  Central  Investigations  Unit  will  include  interviews \nof  all  inmates  and  officers  who  were  involved  in  or  witnessed  any  incident  in  which  an \ninmate  was  injured. \n3.  Aninvestigation  may  be  cone  by  officers  at  ARDC  before  the  investigation  by \nthe  Central  Investigations  Unit  begins.  However,  before  any  inmate  is  questioned  by \nanyone  at  ARDC  about  any  incident  in  which  an  inmate  has  been  injured,  the  inmate \nwill  be  given  a  chance  to  write  a  statement  for  the  Central  Investigations  Unit,  seal  it \nhimseli  and  put  it  into  a  locked  box  which  the  Central  Investigations  Unit  alone  can  open. \n4.  Whenever  anyone  who  works  at  ARDC  cuestions  any  inmate  involved  in  an  inci- \ncent,  he  must  tell  the  inmate  that  he  need  not  talk  about  the  incident  and  that  persons \nfrom  the  Central  Investigations  Unit  will  be  arriving  within  12  hours  to  make  their  own \ninvestigation. \n5-  The  Central  Investigations  Unit  will  keep  three  locked  boxes  at  different  places \nin  ARDC.  If  any  inmate  wishes  to  complain  to  the  Central  Investigations  Unit  about \nany  treatment  he  has  received  at  ARDC,  he  ean  write  a  complaint  and  place  it  in  one \nof  the  boxes.  Only  investigators  from  the  Central  Investigations  Unit  will  have  Keys \nto  the  boxes.  . \n6.  Inmates  at  ARDC  will  be  permitted  to  have  visits  from  any  attorney  they  wish \nto  see. \n7.  If  the  investigation  by  the  Central  Investigations  Unit  finds  that  any  infraction \nagainst  any  inmate  as  a  result  of  an  incident  he  had  with  an  officer  was  not  justified, \nthe  ARDC  staff  will  correct  any  infraction  report  which  has  been  made  against  the \ninmate  and  will  make  efforts  to  restore  to  the  inmate  all  privileges  (including  his  job) \nwhich  he  had  before  the  incident  with  the  officer. \n8.  If  an  inmate  is  given  an  infraction  as  a  result  of  an  incident  between  himself \nand  an  officer  which  has  resulted  in  injury  to  the  inmate,  he  shall  have  a  hearing  on  the \ninfraction  within  72  hours.  However,  in  special  cases,  when  the  Central  Investigation \nUnit  believes  that  further  investigation  would  help,  the  inmate  will  be  given  a  chcice \nto  postpone  his  infraction  hearing.  In  such  cases  he  may  be  housed  in  administrative \nsegregation  until  he  has  his  hearing. \n9.  An  officer  may  not  arrest  an  inmate  without  prior  approval  from  (1)  the  Warden \nor  the  Assistant  Deputy  Warden  acting  as  Tour  Commander  and  (2)  both  the  Inspector \nGeneral  and  the  Chief  of  Operations  or  the  Commissioner.  If  an  inmate  is  arrested  the \nCentral  Investigations  Unit  must  send  the  results  of  its  investigation  to  the  District \n   Attorney. \n10.  In  those  cases  where  the  Central  Investigations  Unit  has  coneluded  that  an \nofficer  used  improper  or  excessive  force  against  an  inmate,  the  Department  will  expedite \ndisciplinary  proceedings  against  the  officer. \nll.  All  complaints  to  any  officer  or  employee  of  the  Department  of  Correction \nof  wrongdoing  involving  the  use  of  force  against  inmates  must  be  reported  to  the  Central \nInvestigations  Unit  immediately. \n    \n12.  A  new  system  of  filing  reports  about  incidents  between  inmates  and  officers \ninvolving  the  use  of  force  and  complaints  about  officers  will  be  set  up.  Every  six  months, \nthe  Central  Investigations  Unit  will  make  a  report  to  the  Commissioner  of  the  Depart- \nment  of  Correction  and  to  the  Warden  of  ARDC  about  those  officers  who  (1)  have  more \nthan  one  complaint  involving  the  use  of  force  against  inmates  in  their  files  over  a  six- \nmonth  period  or  (2)  have  been  involved  in  more  than  one  incident  resulting  in  physical \ninjury  to  an  inmate  over  a  six-month  period. \n13.  The  Department  will  write  and  distribute  to  each  inmate  a  new  inmate  hand \nbook. \n14.  The  Department  will  begin  a  new  program  of  training  for  officers  at  ARDC \nwho  investigate  incidents  involving  the  use  of  force  against  inmates. \n15.  All  notices,  handbooks,  forms  and  other  written  materials  required  to  be given \nto  inmates  in  this  agreement  shall  be  in  Spanish  as  well  as  English. \nThe  New  York  State  Commission  of  Correction  has  been  cropped  from  the  suit. \n| \nThis  notice  will  remain  posted  for  thirty  (30)  days. \n| \nAfter  thirty  (30)  cays,  the  Court  will  decide  whether  to  approve  the  proposed  settle- \n| \n:  ment  and  will  hold  a  hearing  regarding  it.  The  Court  will  consider  any  comments  on, \n|  or  objections  to,  the  terms  of  this  proposed  settlement  by  any  inmate  in  ARDC.
