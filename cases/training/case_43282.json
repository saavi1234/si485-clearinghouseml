Moore, is hereby consolidated into the instant case for pretrial proceedings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 42(a) and D.C.COLO.LCivR 42.1. Civil Action No. 19-cv-03468-CMA-SKC is REASSIGNED to Magistrate Judge Michael E. Hegarty. The Court is aware that Magistrate Judge Hegarty has conducted extensive settlement conferences in Civil Action No. 19- cv-03469-RM-MEH and is very familiar with the facts and issues in the case. The parties also apparently agreed to attempt to mediate both cases together. (Doc. # 82, p. 5; Doc. # 90, p. 3, n.1). Thus, the Court finds that it is appropriate and efficacious for any future settlement conferences in the consolidated cases to be handled by Judge Hegarty; All future documents in these consolidated actions shall be filed in the lowest numbered case only and shall be captioned as follows: Civil Action No. 19-cv-3468-CMA-MEH (Consolidated with Civil Action No. 19-cv-03469-CMA-MEH) In re FRONTIER AIRLINES LITIGATION, by Judge Christine M.

This Court's June 14, 2021 order (ECF 81 ) permits any counsel or litigant \"whose offices are located outside of the Denver metropolitan area or who cannot reasonably make a personal appearance\" to appear by telephone. Because Ms. Sherwin is located in New York, the Court grants her request to appear remotely. However, given the nature of the Discovery Conference, the Court would prefer her appearance by video as opposed to by telephone. Therefore, Ms. Sherwin may appear at the Conference using the instructions attached to this minute order as an exhibit. (Attachments: # 1 VTC Instructions) (cmadr, ) (Entered: 06/16/2021)"

    "summary": "<p>On December 10, 2019, the ACLU, the ACLU of Colorado, Towards Justice, and a private law firm filed this putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. The four individual plaintiffs were female flight attendants who were pregnant and breastfed their children during their employment with Frontier Airlines. The complaint challenged Frontier&rsquo;s alleged discriminatory policies and practices of penalizing pregnancy-related absences, refusing to provide accommodations to pregnant and breastfeeding flight attendants, and prohibiting breast pumping while on duty.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs sued Frontier Airlines under Colorado state law, Title VII, and the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Plaintiffs sought declarative and injunctive relief, back pay, and attorneys&rsquo; fees.&nbsp; Plaintiffs sought to certify two classes&mdash;a pregnancy class, defined as \"[a]ll current and former Frontier flight attendants who became pregnant at any point during the class period,\" and a breastfeeding class, defined as \"[a]ll current and former Frontier flight attendants who breastfed, directly or by feeding their child their own expressed breast milk, while employed by Frontier, including those who breastfed while on any form of leave following the birth of a child, at any time during the class period.\"</p>\r\n<p>The case was originally assigned to Judge Raymond P. Moore and Magistrate Judge N. Reid Neureiter. On December 11, 2019, Magistrate Judge Neureiter was recused because he had previously served as a cooperating attorney on cases initiated by the ACLU. The case was randomly re-assigned to Magistrate Judge Michael E. Hegarty.</p>\r\n<p>The parties began settlement talks on May 4, 2020. In November 2020, Frontier Airlines filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit. On July 14, 2021, following lengthy discovery disputes, Judge Moore declined to dismiss the lawsuit, and allowed all of the plaintiffs' claims under state and federal law, as well as the class certification process, to proceed. In particular, the Court held that the flight attendants had standing for prospective relief as they had a reasonable expectation that the challenged conduct would recur and they showed a continuing injury from the policies as well as standing for damages. Judge Moore determined that the flight attendants sufficiently alleged Title VII and state law disparate treatment claims by alleging that the airlines denied ground assignment requests while providing them for attendants with non-pregnancy related medical conditions. Therefore, the case was allowed to proceed. 2021 WL 2948810.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In September 2021, the District Court consolidated this case with<a href=\"../../../../case/44076/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> <em>Freyer v. Frontier Airlines</em></a>, a suit involving similar allegations against the airline by women pilots. After successfully negotiating a settlement, on April 14, 2022, the <em>Hodgkins </em>parties and Frontier Airlines filed a joint stipulation asking for the cases to be unlinked and for the <em>Hodgkins </em>claims to be dismissed with each side bearing their own attorney's fees and costs. Judge Christine M. Arguello, the judge in&nbsp;<em>Freyer</em>, thus unlinked the cases and dismissed the <em>Hodgkins</em> case with prejudice. The&nbsp;<em>Freyer&nbsp;</em>case was not resolved by the settlement agreement, and remained ongoing at the time of settlement.</p>\r\n<p>The settlement agreement is presumably private, but the key terms have been publicized by the parties. The agreement required Frontier Airlines to update its policies relating to pregnancy and lactation accommodation, including agreements to permit flight attendants to pump during flight, to excuse FMLA-qualifying absences related to pregnancy, to provide a regularly-updated list of lactation facilities at Frontier&rsquo;s base locations to flight attendants who give birth, and to provide a system to address feedback from flight attendants regarding the adequacy of lactation facilities at base locations. They also agreed to clarify Frontier&rsquo;s policy that it accommodates flight attendants unable to fly due to pregnancy or lactation on the same terms that it accommodates flight attendants with other medical conditions rendering them unable to fly.</p>",

The claims in this lawsuit were subsequently dismissed after the parties reached a settlement agreement in April 2022.

Moore \n \nCivil Action No. 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH \n \nMELISSA HODGKINS, et al., \n \n  Plaintiffs, \n \nv. \n \nFRONTIER AIRLINES, INC., \n \n  Defendant. \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n \nORDER \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n   \nThis matter is before the Court on Defendant Frontier Airlines, Inc.โs (โFrontierโ) motion \nto dismiss the complaint (ECF No. 49).  Plaintiffs Melissa Hodgkins, Stacy Rewitzer, Renee \nSchwartzkopf, and Heather Crowe (collectively, โPlaintiffsโ) have filed a response to the motion \n(ECF No. 54) and Frontier has filed a reply (ECF No. 57).  Upon consideration of the motion and \nrelated briefing, applicable law, and being otherwise fully advised, the Court finds and orders as \nfollows. \nI.  LEGAL STANDARDS \nFrontier moves to dismiss the complaint under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). \nA.  Rule 12(b)(1) \nA motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) tests whether the court has subject matter \njurisdiction to properly hear the case before it.  The party invoking the courtโs jurisdiction bears \nthe burden to establish that federal jurisdiction exists, and โsince the courts of the United States \nare courts of limited jurisdiction, there is a presumption against its existence.โ  Basso v. Utah \n\nPower & Light Co., 495 F.2d 906, 909 (10th Cir. 1974). \nRule 12(b)(1) motions generally take two forms.  Stuart v. Colo. Interstate Gas Co., 271 \nF.3d 1221, 1225 (10th Cir. 2001).  The first form is a facial attack that challenges the sufficiency \nof the complaintโs allegations as to subject matter jurisdiction.  Holt v. United States, 46 F.3d \n1000, 1002 (10th Cir. 1995).  The court accepts the allegations in the complaint as true when \nreviewing a facial attack.  Id. \nThe second form is a factual attack that goes beyond the allegations in the complaint and \nchallenges the facts on which subject matter jurisdiction is based.  Id. at 1003.  Unlike a facial \nattack, the court does not presume the truthfulness of the complaintโs factual allegations when \nreviewing a factual attack.  Id.  โA court has wide discretion to allow affidavits, other documents, \nand a limited evidentiary hearing to resolve disputed jurisdictional facts under Rule 12(b)(1).โ  \nId. (citation omitted).  And โa courtโs reference to evidence outside the pleadings does not \nconvert the motion to a Rule 56 motion[,]โ unless the jurisdictional issue is intertwined with the \nmerits of a plaintiffโs case.  Id.  โThe jurisdictional question is intertwined with the merits of the \ncase if subject matter jurisdiction is dependent on the same statute which provides the \nsubstantive claim in the case.โ  Id. \nHere, Defendant is making a facial attack to the sufficiency of the allegations contained \nin the complaint.  Thus, the Court will accept the allegations in the complaint as true and view all \nfactual disputes in a light most favorable to Plaintiffs. \nB.  Rule 12(b)(6) \nIn evaluating a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), a court must accept as \ntrue all well-pleaded factual allegations in the complaint, view those allegations in the light most \nfavorable to the non-movant, and draw all reasonable inferences in that partyโs favor.  Brokersโ \n2 \n \n\nChoice of Am., Inc. v. NBC Universal, Inc., 757 F.3d 1125, 1136 (10th Cir. 2014); Mink v. Knox, \n613 F.3d 995, 1000 (10th Cir. 2010).  The complaint must allege a โplausibleโ right to relief.  \nBell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 569 n.14 (2007); see also id. at 555 (โFactual \nallegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.โ).  Conclusory \nallegations are insufficient, Cory v. Allstate Ins., 583 F.3d 1240, 1244 (10th Cir. 2009), and \ncourts โare not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation,โ \nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (quotation omitted). \nII.  BACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs in this matter are female flight attendants who had children and breastfed their \nchildren during their employment with Frontier.  (ECF No. 1 at ยถ 1.) \nPregnancy and Breastfeeding.  The average length of human gestation is forty weeks.  \n(Id. at ยถ 21.)  During this time, an expectant mother would be medically permitted to fly.  (Id. at \nยถ 22.)  In some instances, however, pregnancy may cause physical changes and conditions which \ncould lead a doctor to limit a pregnant womanโs ability to fly or, in this case, a pregnant flight \nattendant from performing specific activities, ultimately grounding her.  (Id. at ยถยถ 22, 24.) \nAfter giving birth, it is common for a mother to breastfeed her baby.  Studies indicate that \nbreastfeeding infants for up to a year has developmental and psychological benefits.  (Id. at ยถยถ \n26, 37.)  A mother who wishes to breastfeed her child, but is physically separated from her, must \nexpress breast milk using a pumping device to extract milk every two to three hours.  (Id. at ยถยถ \n29-30.)  This process of pumping breast milk takes on average twenty minutes but can be \nterminated on a momentโs notice.  (Id. at ยถยถ 31-32.)  Failure to remove milk from the breast on a \nregular schedule can have adverse effects such as pain and swelling and can lead to medical \ncomplications as well as cessation of lactation altogether.  (Id. at ยถ 33.) \n3 \n \n\nA.  Frontierโs Employee Policies \nFrontier has an employee policy which requires a pregnant employee to notify Frontier as \nsoon as she becomes pregnant.  (Id. at ยถ 38.)  It also has a policy regulating work attendance, but \nFrontier has no written policy for flight attendants who are breastfeeding.  (Id. at ยถ 56.) \nDependability Policy.  Under Frontierโs โDependability Policy,โ flight attendants are \nassigned points for an attendance infraction such as an unexcused absence or tardiness.  (Id. at ยถ \n39.)  Flight attendants receive 1.5 points per infraction, and after accruing three to four points, \nthey become subject to disciplinary action.  (Id. at ยถ 40.)  After accruing eight points, a flight \nattendant can be terminated.  (Id.)  These points will โroll offโ a flight attendantโs personal \nrecord after twelve months of perfect attendance; however, the clock pauses during a period of \napproved medical leave of absence.  (Id.)  As one might expect, not all absences accrue points.  \nLeave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (โFMLAโ), medical leave, military leave, and \nother approved absences do not require a point to be etched in a flight attendantโs record.  (Id. at \nยถ 41.)  What Frontierโs policy does not exempt from accruing points are absences related to \npregnancy or breastfeeding outside of those which occur during FMLA leave.  (Id. at ยถยถ 43-44). \nThe Dependability Policy also honors stretches of perfect attendance.  Flight attendants \ncan earn credit points toward additional days off and bonus pay over the course of a year after \ngoing six months without an absence.  (Id. at ยถ 42.) \nEmployee Leave.  Frontier does not offer paid leave to flight attendants who take time off \nbecause of pregnancy or a pregnancy-related condition.  (Id. at ยถ 46.)  In the past, Frontier has \ndenied requests to provide accommodations, including those for temporary alternative job \nassignments which would allow pregnant flight attendants to continue working during portions \nof their pregnancy, to flight attendants who were unable to fly.  (Id. at ยถ 47.)  At the same time, \n4 \n \n\nFrontierโs policy provides accommodations for flight attendants with medical conditions \nunrelated to pregnancy and childbirth.  (Id. at ยถ 49.)  These medical accommodations have been \nprovided to flight attendants who suffered on-the-job injuries as well as developed certain \nmedical conditions outside of work.  (Id. at ยถยถ 51-52.) \nFrontierโs employee policy references โmaternity leaveโ but does not provide for a \nspecified period of paid or unpaid leave for flight attendants after giving birth outside what is \navailable under the FMLA.  (Id. at ยถ 53.)  Flight attendants who take time off after giving birth \nare placed on FMLA leave or medical leave, both of which are unpaid.  (Id. at ยถ 54.) \nBreastfeeding Policy.  For those employees returning to work while still breastfeeding, \nFrontier did and does not provide designated break time to pump or express breast milk.  (Id. at ยถ \n58.)  Meanwhile, Frontier has and continues to provide break time for other physiological needs \nsuch as using the restroom.  (Id.)  Additionally, Frontier did and does not provide any non-\nbathroom sites located near work areas for flight attendants who are breastfeeding to pump breast \nmilk.  (Id. at ยถ 59.)  Consequently, Plaintiffs resorted to pumping breast milk in aircraft \nlavatories.  (Id. at ยถ 60.)  This practice is generally not considered sanitary as it presents the \npotential for harmful bacteria to contaminate the breast milk.  (Id. at ยถ 36.) \nA flight attendantโs work schedule is varied.  Based on the distance traveled per flight, \nthe number of turns or flights flown in a given shift, and the time between flights, flight \nattendants may work up to twelve hours a day.  (Id. at ยถ 64.)  Frontier creates flight attendant \nschedules based on seniority, which leaves more junior attendants with less control to build their \nschedules with sufficient breaks between flights and shorter duration flights to permit adequate \ntime to pump breast milk during the workday.  (Id. at ยถยถ 66-67.) \nWhile a plane is airborne, flight attendants are required to perform specific duties to \n5 \n \n\nensure the safety and comfort of passengers.  (Id. at ยถ 71.)  Once those duties are complete, flight \nattendants are permitted to chat, eat, read, or visit the restroom to take care of personal needs.  \n(Id. at ยถยถ 72-73.)  While flight attendants are permitted to use their breaks basically as they wish, \nthose who have disclosed to Frontier that they are breastfeeding are prohibited from using this \ntime to pump breast milk.  (Id. at ยถ 75.) \nB.  Individual Plaintiffs \nThe complaint identifies four flight attendants who allege that they have been and \ncontinue to be harmed by Frontierโs policies. \nStacy Rewitzer.  Ms. Rewitzer has been employed as a flight attendant with Frontier since \n2006 and became pregnant with her son in August 2015.  (Id. at ยถ 76.)  In January 2016, Ms. \nRewitzer missed ten days of work due to a pregnancy-related condition, and, as a result, she \naccrued three points under the Dependability Policy.  (Id. at ยถ 85.)  Frontier declined to remove \nthe points from Ms. Rewitzerโs file after repeated requests to recategorize the absences as \napproved FMLA leave.  (Id. at ยถ 86.)  The next month, Frontier denied Ms. Rewitzerโs request \nfor time off for pregnancy-related health complications because the requested days coincided \nwith Super Bowl weekend.  (Id. at ยถ 87.) \nBecause of pregnancy-related complications, Ms. Rewitzer exhausted all her FMLA \nleave early in her pregnancy which required her to go on unpaid non-FMLA medical leave when \nher doctor determined she was unable to fly.  (Id. at ยถ 77.) \nOn August 9, 2016, almost three months after giving birth to her child, Ms. Rewitzer was \ncleared by her doctor to return to work with various physical limitations.  (Id. at ยถ 78.)  Ms. \nRewitzer met with the Workers Compensation & Leaves of Absences manager to discuss \npossible breastfeeding accommodations.  (Id. at ยถ 79.)  The manager explained that Ms. Rewitzer \n6 \n \n\nshould bid for trips with adequate break times between flights to pump but stated that Frontier \nโcannot offer any accommodations to nursing flight attendants.โ  (Id. at ยถ 83.)  Ms. Rewitzer was \nsubsequently placed on unpaid medical leave until she was cleared to fly without physical \nlimitations or requiring accommodations to pump breast milk.  (Id. at ยถ 84.) \nAs a result of Frontierโs policies relating to pregnancy, Ms. Rewitzer suffered economic \nas well as non-economic harm.  (Id. at ยถ 89.)  Ms. Rewitzer remains employed with Frontier and \ncontinues to be subject to Frontierโs policies and practices on an ongoing basis.  (Id. at ยถ 90.)  \nThese policies have impacted and continue to impact her plans with respect to her family and her \npersonal reproductive decisions.  (Id.) \nMelissa Hodgkins.  Ms. Hodgkins has worked for Frontier as a flight attendant since \n2007 and during that time, has had two children.  (Id. at ยถยถ 91-92.)  When returning to work after \nhaving her first child, Ms. Hodgkins learned from her colleagues that most flight attendants who \nnursed their babies pumped breast milk in the aircraft lavatories during flights.  (Id. at ยถ 94.)  Not \nwanting to engage in that practice for sanitation concerns, Ms. Hodgkins decided to cease \nbreastfeeding prior to returning to work, despite her desire to continue breastfeeding her baby.  \n(Id.) \nIn April 2017, while pregnant with her second child, Ms. Hodgkins accrued 1.5 points \nunder the Dependability Policy for an unexcused pregnancy-related absence.  (Id. at ยถ 95.)  In \nOctober 2017, Frontier denied Ms. Hodgkinsโ request for a ground assignment based on \npregnancy-related physical limitations imposed by her doctor.  (Id. at ยถ 97.)  On November 8, \n2017, Frontier placed Ms. Hodgkins on unpaid medical leave which continued until sometime \nafter she gave birth.  (Id.)  Again, Ms. Hodgkins weaned her baby from breastfeeding earlier than \ndesired so that she could return to work for fear of being reassigned.  (Id. at ยถ 100.) \n7 \n \n\nBased on Frontierโs policies relating to pregnancy, Ms. Hodgkins suffered economic as \nwell as non-economic harm.  (Id. at ยถ 101.)  Further, Frontierโs Dependability Policy harmed Ms. \nHodgkins by causing her to accrue points for pregnancy-related absences.  (Id. at ยถ 102.)  Ms. \nHodgkins remains employed with Frontier and continues to be subject to Frontierโs policies and \npractices on an ongoing basis.  (Id. at ยถ 103.)  These policies have impacted and continue to \nimpact her plans with respect to her family and her personal reproductive decisions.  (Id.) \nRenee Schwartzkopf.  Ms. Schwartzkopf has worked for Frontier as a flight attendant \nsince 2006 and became pregnant with her son in May 2016.  (Id. at ยถยถ 104-05.)  After giving \nbirth, Ms. Schwartzkopf returned to work in April 2017, at which time, Frontier required her to \nattend a day-long training program.  (Id. at ยถ 107.)  Knowing that she would need to pump breast \nmilk during the training, Ms. Schwartzkopf submitted an accommodation request with \nsupporting documentation from her doctor describing her impairment.  (Id. at ยถ 108.)  Frontier \ngranted Ms. Schwartzkopfโs request.  (Id.) \nAfter that, however, Frontier declined to advise Ms. Schwartzkopf of any policy \nregarding pumping inflight or whether she was even permitted to do so.  (Id. at ยถ 109.)  Further, \nFrontier did not provide her with information about approved pumping locations in Denver \nInternational Airport or offer sufficient break time between flights for her to pump breast milk.  \n(Id. at ยถ 115.)  Consequently, Ms. Schwartzkopf felt she had no choice but to pump breast milk \nin the airplane lavatory during her inflight breaks and at airport restrooms between flights.  (Id. at \nยถ 117.) \nAs a result of Frontierโs policies relating to pregnancy and breastfeeding, Ms. \nSchwartzkopf suffered economic as well as non-economic harm.  (Id. at ยถ 119.)  Ms. \nSchwartzkopf remains employed with Frontier and continues to be subject to Frontierโs policies \n8 \n \n\nand practices on an ongoing basis.  (Id. at ยถ 121.)  These policies have impacted and continue to \nimpact her plans with respect to her family and her personal reproductive decisions.  (Id.) \nHeather Crowe.  Ms. Crowe works as a flight attendant for Frontier.  (Id. at ยถ 122.)  \nDuring her employment, between October 2013 and June 2018, she had three children.  (Id.)  \nWhen returning to work after her first and second pregnancies, Ms. Crowe was forced to pump \nbreast milk in aircraft lavatories during inflight breaks because she did not have sufficient break \ntime between flights to pump on the ground.  (Id. at ยถ 124.)  While on leave after having her \nsecond child, Frontier denied Ms. Croweโs initial request for extended leave under the FMLA to \nbreastfeed, but eventually granted her leave after she was diagnosed with post-partum \ndepression.  (Id. at ยถ 127.) \nDuring Ms. Croweโs third pregnancy, she was diagnosed with a sinus infection \nexacerbated by her pregnancy, and, thus, was absent from work.  (Id. at ยถ 129.)  Despite Ms. \nCrowe submitting medical documentation indicating she was unable to fly, she accrued points \nunder the Dependability Policy for her pregnancy-related absences, resulting in disciplinary \naction.  (Id.)  Ms. Crowe returned to work while she was still breastfeeding her third child and \nfelt forced to pump breast milk in the aircraft lavatory.  (Id. at ยถ 130.)  As a result of Frontierโs \npolicies relating to pregnancy and breastfeeding, Ms. Crowe suffered economic as well as non-\neconomic harm.  (Id. at ยถ 131.)  Further, Frontierโs Dependability Policy harmed Ms. Crowe by \ncausing her to accrue points for pregnancy-related absences.  (Id. at ยถ 132.) \nMs. Crowe remains employed with Frontier and continues to be subject to Frontierโs \npolicies and practices on an ongoing basis.  (Id. at ยถ 133.)  These policies have impacted and \ncontinue to impact her plans with respect to her family and her personal reproductive decisions.  \n(Id.) \n9 \n \n\nBased on the forgoing, Plaintiffs bring sixteen causes of action, seeking damages and \ninjunctive and declaratory relief.  Plaintiffs claim Frontier has violated, and continues to violate, \nstate and federal laws, including: Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 2000e, et \nseq. (โTitle VIIโ); the FMLA, 5 U.S.C. ยง 6381 et seq.; the Colorado Law on Reasonable \nAccommodations for Pregnancy, Childbirth, and Related Conditions, Colo. Rev. Stat. ยง 24-34-\n402.3; the Colorado Workplace Accommodations for Nursing Mothers Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. ยง \n13-1-124(1) (โWANMAโ); and the Colorado Anti-discrimination Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. ยง 24-34-\n401 et seq. (โCADAโ).  (Id. at ยถ 7.)  Plaintiffs also claim there are two putative classes of flight \nattendants, a pregnancy class and breastfeeding class, employed by Frontier who have been and \ncontinue to be harmed by Frontierโs policies and practices regarding pregnancy and lactation.  \n(Id. at ยถยถ 142, 144.) \nProcedural Background.  On May 16, 2017, Ms. Rewitzer filed a charge with the Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission (โEEOCโ) concerning Frontierโs allegedly discriminatory \npractices and policies.  (Id. at ยถ 134.)  On October 6, 2017, Ms. Hodgkins and Ms. Schwartzkopf \nfiled charges with the EEOC concerning Frontierโs alleged conduct, with Ms. Hodgkins \nsupplementing her charge on February 9, 2018.  (Id. at ยถ 135.)  And on June 15, 2018, Ms. \nCrowe filed a charge with the EEOC concerning Frontierโs alleged conduct, supplementing her \ncharge on January 4, 2019. (Id. at ยถ 136.) \nOn December 2, 2019, Plaintiffs requested a Notice of Right to Sue from the EEOC.  (Id. \nat ยถ 140.)  This suit followed. \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nFrontier asks the Court to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction and because \nPlaintiffs fail to state a plausible claim for relief.  (ECF No. 49.)  Frontier first challenges the \n10 \n \n\nsufficiency of the complaint on three jurisdictional grounds: (1) standing; (2) preemption; and (3) \nexhaustion.  (Id. at 3-12.)  Frontier next challenges the sufficiency of the pleadings, arguing that \nPlaintiffs have failed to: (1) state a claim for disparate treatment on the basis of sex under Title \nVII and CADA; (2) establish a prima facie case of disparate impact discrimination; (3) \ndemonstrate Frontier refused to provide rooms for lactation as prescribed under WANMA; (4) \ntimely bring many of their claims as required under the applicable statute of limitations; and (5) \npropose an ascertainable class under Rule 23.  (Id. at 14-21.) \nPlaintiffs oppose the motion on all fronts.  (ECF No. 54.) \nA.  Dismissal Under Rule 12(b)(1) \nThe Court will first address whether Plaintiffs have standing before turning to whether \nPlaintiffsโ state law claims are preempted by federal law.1 \n1.  Standing \nJusticiability โis the threshold question in every federal case, determining the power of \nthe court to entertain the suit.โ  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975).  Article III of the \nConstitution grants federal courts jurisdiction over โcases and controversies,โ and the standing \ndoctrine โserves to identify those disputes which are appropriately resolved through the judicial \nprocess.โ  Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 154-155 (1990). \nTo have Article IIIโconstitutionalโstanding, โthe plaintiff must show that the conduct \nof which he complains has caused him to suffer an injury in fact that a favorable judgment will \nredress.โ  Wilderness Socโy. v. Kane Cty., Utah, 632 F.3d 1162, 1168 (10th Cir. 2011) \n(quotation, citation, and brackets omitted).  In other words, a plaintiff must plausibly allege (1) \n \n1 Frontier initially argued Plaintiffs failed to exhaust their CADA claim in its motion to dismiss.  (ECF No. 49 at \n13.)  This argument, however, was subsequently abandoned after Frontier learned that Plaintiffs had received notice \nof right to sue on that claim (ECF No. 57 at 7).  Thus, it will not be addressed by the Court. \n11 \n \n\ninjury in fact, (2) fairly traceable to defendantโs conduct, (3) that is redressable by a favorable \njudicial decision.  See VR Acquisitions, LLC v. Wasatch Cty., 853 F.3d 1142, 1146 (10th Cir. \n2017).  Article III standing is jurisdictional; it is properly raised under Rule 12(b)(1).  In re \nPeeples, 880 F.3d 1207, 1212 (10th Cir. 2018).  The โplaintiff must demonstrate standing for \neach claim he seeks to press.โ  DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 352 (2006). \nQuestions of standing and mootness are closely linkedโmootness could be seen as a \nโtime dimension[] of standing.โ  See 13B Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal \nPractice and Procedure ยง 3531.12 (3d ed. 1998) (โAlthough discrete names have been given to \nthe several nominate categories of justiciability, they are tied closely together.โ); see also Warth, \n422 U.S. at 499 n.10 (โThe standing question thus bears close affinity to . . . mootness-whether \nthe occasion for judicial intervention persists.โ). \nMootness is an issue of subject matter jurisdiction which can be raised at any stage of the \nproceedings.  Kennedy v. Lubar, 273 F.3d 1293, 1301-02 (10th Cir. 2001).  Under Article III of \nthe Constitution, federal courts may only adjudicate live controversies.  See U.S. Const. Art. III, \nยง 2, cl. 1; Alvarez v. Smith, 558 U.S. 87, 92 (2009).  An โactual controversy must be extant at all \nstages of review, not merely at the time the complaint is filed.โ  Alvarez, 558 U.S. at 130 \n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted); see also Jordan v. Sosa, 654 F.3d 1012, 1023 \n(10th Cir. 2011) (โThe mootness doctrine provides that although there may be an actual and \njusticiable controversy at the time the litigation is commenced, once that controversy ceases to \nexist, the federal court must dismiss the action for want of jurisdiction.โ) (citation omitted). \nAn exception to the mootness doctrine exists when the harm is โcapable of repetition, yet \nevading review.โ  Chihuahuan Grasslands All. v. Kempthorne, 545 F.3d 884, 892 (10th Cir. \n2008) (quotation and citation omitted).  This doctrine applies only in exceptional circumstances.  \n12 \n \n\nThe capable-of-repetition exception โarises โwhen: (1) the duration of the challenged action is \ntoo short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration, and (2) there is a reasonable \nexpectation that the same complaining party . . . [will] be subjected to the same action again.โโ  \nId. (citation omitted). \nOne such exceptional circumstance is a case involving pregnancy.  Because the duration \nof a pregnancy will come to term before the typical litigation process is complete, pregnancy \ndiscrimination โtruly could be capable of repetition, yet evading review.โ  Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. \n113, 125 (1973) (quotation and citation omitted). \nAs set forth in Roe: \nwhen, as here, pregnancy is a significant fact in the litigation, the \nnormal  266-day  human  gestation  period  is  so  short  that  the \npregnancy will come to term before the usual appellate process is \ncomplete.  If  that  termination  makes  a  case  moot,  pregnancy \nlitigation seldom will survive much beyond the trial stage, and \nappellate review will be effectively denied. Our law should not be \nthat rigid. \n \nId. at 125.  Thus, to ensure a case involving pregnancy-based discrimination is not rendered moot \nat the cessation of the pregnancy, the Supreme Court held โ[p]regnancy provides a classic \njustification for a conclusion of nonmootness.โ  Id.  Put simply, Roe created an exception to the \nnormal standing and mootness requirements for cases involving pregnancy. \nHere, Frontier challenges Plaintiffsโ standing to seek prospective and retrospective relief. \na.  Standing to Seek Prospective Relief \nFrontier argues that Plaintiffs are not entitled to seek injunctive and declaratory relief, \nexplaining that they have failed to prove their standing since none of them are currently pregnant \nor breastfeeding and none of them assert an imminent intent to become pregnant.  (ECF No. 49 \nat 4-5.)  Plaintiffs disagree, arguing that they have standing because the harms they suffered are \n13 \n \n\ncapable of repetition, yet evading review.  (ECF No. 54 at 5.) \nโAt the pleading stage, general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendantโs \nconduct may suffice, for on a motion to dismiss we โpresume that general allegations embrace \nthose specific facts that are necessary to support the claim.โโ  Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. \n555, 561 (1992) (citation omitted).  At issue here is the injury in fact requirement.  To satisfy the \nโinjury in factโ requirement for prospective relief, โthe plaintiff must be suffering a continuing \ninjury or be under a real and immediate threat of being injured in the future.โ  Tandy v. City of \nWichita, 380 F.3d 1277, 1283-84 (10th Cir. 2004) (citing City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. \n101-02, 107 n.8 (1983)).  โPast wrongs are evidence bearing on whether there is a real and \nimmediate threat of repeated injuryโ but a โclaimed injury that is contingent upon speculation or \nconjecture is beyond the bounds of a federal courtโs jurisdiction.โ  Tandy, 380 F.3d 1283-84 \n(10th Cir. 2004) (citations omitted). \nIn this case, whether Plaintiffs have standing to seek prospective relief is a close question.  \nFrontier argues that when this suit commenced, none of the Plaintiffs were pregnant or \nbreastfeeding and a mere someday intention of pregnancy plans without indication of when that \nsomeday will come is insufficient to show an actual or imminent injury.  Plaintiffsโ response \nconflates the standing and mootness requirements, arguing that none of them need to remain \ncontinually pregnant or breastfeeding to maintain standing.  Yet, that is not fatal to their position. \nPlaintiffs rely on Roe in positing that because they have been harmed in the past and they \nremain employed with Frontier which subjects them to the challenged conduct in future \npregnancies and because their claims concern pregnancy, a classic condition of nonmootness, \nPlaintiffs should be able to challenge Frontierโs policies regardless of whether they are currently \npregnant or allege any specific intent to become pregnant and breastfeed in the future.  It follows, \n14 \n \n\nPlaintiffs argue, that because the challenged conduct has impacted and continues to impact their \nplans with respect to their family planning and personal reproductive decisions, their allegations \nare sufficient to establish a continuing injury. \nThe Court agrees that because Plaintiffs remain employed by Frontier, it is reasonable to \nexpect that they, or another member of the proposed class, would be subject to the same policies \nimpacting their ability to take time off for pregnancy-related medical care or obtain breastfeeding \naccommodations.  Based on the allegations, it seems likely, rather than speculative or \nconjectural, that a pregnant flight attendant will be subjected to the same alleged discriminatory \npractice again. \nPlaintiffs have alleged that they were exposed to wrongful conduct in the past and \ncontinue to be subjected to Frontierโs policies in the future.  The injury in fact is the ongoing \nthreat of being denied pregnancy-related accommodations causing Plaintiffs to modify their \nfamily planning decisions.  While none of the named Plaintiffs have averred an imminent intent \nto become pregnant, their injury is predicated upon conduct which occurred during past \npregnancies, an inherently temporary condition, and the real prospect that it will occur again.2 \nEven if the Court were to assume that none of the named Plaintiffs themselves are \nreasonably expected to face the same injury, under a broadened scope of injury reoccurrence, \nthere is a reasonable expectation that one of the approximately 1,150 female flight attendants \nemployed by Frontier will become pregnant in the future and be subject to the same alleged \ndiscriminatory conduct.  See Majors v. Abell, 317 F.3d 719, 723 (7th Cir. 2003) (explaining that \nin abortion and election cases courts do not interpret the capable of repetition yet evading review \n \n2 Since filing the complaint, Ms. Hodgkins and Ms. Crowe have each given birth and breastfed.  (ECF No. 54 at 6.)  \nWhile neither Plaintiff explicitly indicated an immediate intention to have another child and breastfed in the \ncomplaint, this does support the finding that the allegations are sufficient to show a reasonable expectation that the \nsame controversy will occur to the same complaining party. \n15 \n \n\nexception requirement โthat the dispute giving rise to the case be capable of repetition by the \nsame plaintiff . . . literallyโ) (citations omitted) (emphasis in original).  Thus, Frontierโs alleged \nfailure to provide accommodations for pregnant and breastfeeding flight attendants is a concrete \ninjury which continues to affect each of them in a personal and particularized manner. \nFrontier cites ACLU v. Trinity Health Corp. in support of its position.  178 F. Supp. 3d \n614 (E.D. Mich. 2016).  In Trinity Health Corp., the court concluded that because the number of \nevents which must occur for a plaintiff to be injured by a hospitalโs pregnancy policy were too \ngreat and remote, the plaintiffsโ risk of harm could not be characterized as โcertainly \nimpending.โ  Id. at 620.  There, the plaintiffs sued a parent corporation of a religious health care \nsystem alleging that its hospitalsโ policy precluding certain emergency pregnancy-related \nmedical procedures was in violation of federal law.  Id. at 616-17. \nThe plaintiffs in Trinity Health Corp. argued that they had standing based on two \ntheories: (1) at least one of the individual plaintiffs had โalready been denied stabilizing \ntreatmentโ at one of defendantsโ hospitals and (2) โat least one member was pregnant at the time \nthe case was filed,โ had a history of pregnancy complications, and lived in a county where \ndefendants owned the only hospital.  Id. at 618-19.  In holding that plaintiffs had failed to \nestablish standing to bring their claims, the court measured the โvagueness of the allegationsโ to \nbe โdubiousโ and focused on the speculative nature of alleged harms, explaining that even with \none of the plaintiffs being pregnant, she failed to plead facts showing she faces a substantial risk \nof pregnancy complications.  Id. at 619-20.  The Trinity Health Corp. court reasoned that she \ncould not guarantee that she would experience pregnancy complications, choose to be treated at \ndefendantโs hospitals, or require hospitalization in the first place.  Id. \nHere, Plaintiffsโ risk of harm is more certain than in Trinity Health Corp., primarily \n16 \n \n\nbecause Plaintiffs remain employed with Frontier.  The pregnant plaintiff in Trinity Health Corp. \nwas not bound to seek medical assistance at defendantsโ hospitals if and when a pregnancy \ncomplication should arise whereas in this case, Plaintiffsโ family planning decisions are \ncontinually impacted by Frontierโs policies.  Moreover, Plaintiffs here do not make vague \nallegations of past harms like in Trinity Health Corp.; instead, they plead a litany of specific \nharms which does more to show a reasonable likelihood of repeated injury. \nUltimately, Plaintiffs allege that their family and personal reproductive decisions have \nbeen and will continue to be impacted by Frontierโs policies.  Pregnancy, childbirth, and other \nrelated conditions are personal interests the Pregnancy Discrimination Act was created to protect \nby forbidding discrimination based on a personโs reproductive decisions.  Plaintiffs are women \nof childbearing age who, while pregnant and after having had children and breastfed were \nallegedly harmed by Frontierโs discriminatory policies, continue to work for Frontier and live \nunder that characterized as a real specter of discrimination.  This is sufficient to create a \nreasonable expectation that the challenged conduct will occur again and show a continuing injury \nadequate to establish standing.  Thus, Plaintiffs have standing to seek prospective relief.  See \nMcCormack v. Herzog, 788 F.3d 1017, 1026 (9th Cir. 2015) (finding that plaintiffโs challenge to \nan abortion law was not moot based on the โcapable of repetition, yet evading reviewโ doctrine \nwhere she โmay become pregnant again, and her term of pregnancy is of limited durationโ and \nthat the plaintiff had โstanding based on the ongoing risk of prosecution for the termination of \nher past pregnancyโ).  Accordingly, Frontierโs motion to dismiss Plaintiffsโ claims for \nprospective relief for want of standing is denied. \nb.  Standing to Seek Damages \nFrontier next argues that Plaintiffs have failed to allege they were harmed by its policies.  \n17 \n \n\n(ECF No. 49 at 6.)  In response, Plaintiffs argue that they have sufficiently plead facts indicating \nthey were harmed by Frontierโs polices.  (ECF No. 54 at 3.) \nPlaintiffs have standing to seek damages.  They have each established that during their \npregnancies, they were forced into unpaid leave without the option to seek alternative work \nassignments.  Moreover, they have alleged that the Dependability Policyโs point system deterred \nthem from taking time off to obtain pregnancy-related medical care, resulted in disciplinary \naction, and disqualified them from perfect attendance bonus opportunities.  Plaintiffs have also \neach alleged that they breastfed during their employment and that by denying their \naccommodation requests, Frontier impacted their ability to continue breastfeeding.  Therefore, \nPlaintiffs have suffered an injury in fact. \nAdditionally, Plaintiffโs injuries are fairly traceable to Frontierโs (1) alleged failure to \naccommodate reassignment requests while Plaintiffs were pregnant and breastfeeding, (2) \nDependability Policy, or (3) denial of adequate breastfeeding accommodations.  Finally, an \naward of back pay and compensatory and other economic damages can redress the injuries \nsuffered by Plaintiffs.  As a result, Plaintiffs have standing to seek damages.  Accordingly, \nFrontierโs motion to dismiss Plaintiffsโ claims for damages for want of standing is denied.    See \ne.g., Santana v. City & Cty. of Denver, 488 F.3d 860, 866 (10th Cir. 2007) (explaining that a \nplaintiff had standing to bring a discrimination claim where she asserted โthat she was the victim \nof discrimination because the interview selection process resulted in a disparate impact on \nfemale candidatesโ). \n2.  Preemption \nFrontier next argues that Plaintiffsโ state law claims (claims eight, twelve, thirteen, and \nfourteen) relating to a failure to grant breastfeeding and pumping accommodation requests are \n18 \n \n\npreempted by federal airline regulations.  (ECF No. 45 at 10.)  As a result, Frontier contends, the \nCourt lacks jurisdiction over these claims, and they must be dismissed.  (Id. at 11.)  Specifically, \nFrontier asserts that because the Federal Aviation Act (โFAAโ) and the Airline Deregulation Act \n(โADAโ) regulate the field of airline transportation, they preempt Plaintiffsโ state law claims.  \n(Id. at 10.) \nPlaintiffs disagree, claiming that preemption is an affirmative defense not properly raised \nat the pleading stage under Rule 12(b)(1) or 12(b)(6).  (ECF No. 54 at 18.)  If Frontierโs \nargument is not premature, Plaintiffs assert that their state antidiscrimination claims are not \npreempted by the applicable federal regulations because the state law claims do not significantly \nimpact the airlineโs โrates, routes, or servicesโ which are exclusively regulated by federal law.  \n(Id. at 21.) \nPursuant to the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2, โCongress has the power to \nenact statutes that preempt state law.โ  US Airways, Inc. v. OโDonnell, 627 F.3d 1318, 1324 (10th \nCir. 2010) (citation omitted).  Preemption of a state law can occur in one of three ways: (1) \nโexpress preemption, which occurs when the language of the federal statute reveals an express \ncongressional intent to preempt state law;โ (2) โfield preemption, which occurs when the federal \nscheme of regulation is so pervasive that Congress must have intended to leave no room for a \nState to supplement it;โ and (3) โconflict preemption, which occurs either when compliance with \nboth the federal and state laws is a physical impossibility, or when the state law stands as an \nobstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.โ  \nId. at 1324 (citation and quotation omitted) \nHere, Frontier argues โfield preemptionโ bars Plaintiffsโ state law claims.  In this regard, \nthe Tenth Circuit held โthat the comprehensive regulatory scheme promulgated pursuant to the \n19 \n \n\nFAA evidences the intent for federal law to occupy the field of aviation safety exclusively.โ  Id. \nat 1327. \nWhile the Court agrees with Frontier to the extent that a state law impacting aviation \nsafety could be preempted by the FAA, it is not apparent from the pleadings that accommodation \nrequests under the applicable state laws impact airline safety.  That is because Frontierโs \njustification, that granting Plaintiffsโ accommodation requests could interfere with proper \nperformance of a crewmemberโs duties jeopardizing passenger safety, for denying \naccommodations to pump breast milk while inflight is a proffered non-discriminatory \njustification first raised in its motion to dismiss.  See Parise v. Delta Airlines, Inc., 141 F.3d \n1463, 1466 (11th Cir. 1998) (explaining that it was โinappropriate . . . for the [district] court to \ncredit the defendantโs proffered non-discriminatory justification for its decision to terminate an \nemployee and use that allegation as a basis to find preemptionโ because doing so โpotentially \ndepriv[ed] the plaintiff of any remedy under either federal or state lawโ). \nBased on the allegations, Frontier denied requests for (1) ground positions during flight \nattendantsโ pregnancies and while breastfeeding, (2) shorter trips with longer ground time \nbetween flights to pump breastmilk, and (3) lactation facilities other than a lavatory.  It is not \napparent on the face of the complaint how these accommodation requests relate to the regulation \nof aviation safety; it is only after consideration of Frontierโs proffered justification for denying \nsuch requests could the relation be made.  As in this case, determining whether a party should \nprevail on its affirmative defense, such as preemption, is better left until the underlying facts \nhave been further developed.  Accordingly, Frontierโs motion to dismiss the state law claims \nbecause they are preempted by the FAA is denied.  See In re Air Crash Disaster at Stapleton \nIntโl Airport, Denver, Colo., on Nov. 15, 1987, 721 F. Supp. 1185, 1186 (D. Colo. 1988) \n20 \n \n\n(explaining that preemption is a defense in the nature of avoidance properly โclaimed as an \naffirmative defense in [an] answerโ); see also Devon Energy Prod. Co., L.P. v. Mosaic Potash \nCarlsbad, Inc., 693 F.3d 1195, 1203 n.4 (10th Cir. 2012) (โpreemption may be invoked in . . . \nfederal court as an affirmative defense to the allegations in a plaintiffโs complaintโ). \nThe same conclusion must be reached with regard to Frontierโs motion to dismiss the \nstate law claims as preempted by the ADA.  State law โactions having a connection with or \nreference to airline โrates, routes, or servicesโ are pre-empted under [the ADA].โ  Morales v. \nTrans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S. 374, 384 (1992). \nHere, the Court finds Frontierโs argument, that allowing a flight attendant to use an \naircraft lavatory for an extended period to pump breast milk might displace passenger service \nthereby impacting an area regulated by the ADA, unpersuasive.  As discussed with regard to the \nFAA, the complaint contains allegations of Frontier denying accommodation requests outside an \naircraft and for pumping locations other than a lavatory while inflight.  The Court agrees with \nPlaintiffs in that Frontierโs position is premised upon heavily disputed facts that cannot be \nadjudged at this stage of the proceedings.  Thus, Frontierโs motion to dismiss the state law claims \nbecause they are preempted by the ADA is also denied. \nHaving determined that there are no jurisdictional barriers concerning the subject matter \nof this case, the Court now addresses whether Plaintiffs have alleged a plausible right to relief. \n3.  Dismissal Under Rule 12(b)(6) \nEven though โthe 12(b)(6) standard does not require that Plaintiff establish a prima facie \ncase in her complaint, the elements of each alleged cause of action help to determine whether \nPlaintiff has set forth a plausible claim.โ  Khalik v. United Air Lines, 671 F.3d 1188, 1192 (10th \nCir. 2012).  Allegations in a complaint that are โso general that they encompass a wide swath of \n21 \n \n\nconduct, much of it innocent,โ are insufficient; instead, allegations must โgive the defendant fair \nnotice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.โ  Id. at 1191-92. \n1.  Title VII and CADA Claims \nBecause Title VII and CADA claims โrise and fall together,โ the Court will examine the \nstate and federal claims together.  Agassounon v. Jeppesen Sanderson, Inc., 688 F. Appโx 507, \n509 (10th Cir. 2017) (โCADA discrimination . . . claims are subject to the same legal standards \nas Title VII claims.โ) (citing Johnson v. Weld County, 594 F.3d 1202, 1219 n.11 (10th Cir. \n2010)). \nIn their complaint, Plaintiffs allege that Frontierโs failure to provide adequate \naccommodations to pregnant and breastfeeding employees constitutes disparate treatment based \non sex and that Frontierโs policies have a disparate impact on pregnant and breastfeeding \nemployees.  In its motion, Frontier argues the allegations fail to plausibly state a claim under \neither theory. \na.  Disparate Treatment Claims \nโThe Pregnancy Discrimination Act [โPDAโ] makes clear that Title VIIโs prohibition \nagainst sex discrimination applies to discrimination based on pregnancy.โ  Young v. United \nParcel Serv., Inc., 575 U.S. 206, 135 S. Ct. 1338, 1343 (2015).  Thus, pursuant to Title VII, \nemployers must treat โwomen affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or other related conditions . . . \nthe same for all employment-related purposes . . . as other persons not so affected but similar in \ntheir ability or inability to work.โ  42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e(k). \nA plaintiff can establish a prima facie case of pregnancy discrimination by showing, โ[1] \nthat she belongs to the protected class, [2] that she sought accommodation, [3] that the employer \ndid not accommodate her, and [4] that the employer did accommodate others โsimilar in their \n22 \n \n\nability or inability to work.โโ  Young, 135 S. Ct. at 1354. \nFrontier argues that Plaintiffs have failed to identify any similarly situated employees \nwho were provided accommodations.  (ECF No. 49 at 16.)  By focusing their argument on the \nfourth prong of this quadripartite test, Frontier seemingly concedes that Plaintiffs can satisfy the \nother three requirements.  Indeed, the PDA makes clear that Plaintiffs belong to a protected class.  \nMoreover, facts alleged in the complaint indicate that Plaintiffs sought and were denied \naccommodations based on their pregnancy-related work limitations.  Thus, the only remaining \nissue is whether Plaintiffs identified instances where Frontier accommodated others โsimilar in \ntheir ability or inability to workโ in their complaint. \nPlaintiffs allege that Frontier denied their requests for ground assignments while \nproviding such accommodations for flight attendants who were unable to fly based on a non-\npregnancy related medical condition or disability.  Specifically, Frontier provided temporary \nground positions to flight attendants who suffered various on-the-job injuries as well as \ndeveloped non-pregnancy health conditions limiting their ability to fly outside of work.  \nPlaintiffs, therefore, have identified instances where Frontier provided accommodations for flight \nattendants similar in their inability to work. \nAt this stage of the proceedings, Plaintiffs sufficiently allege a plausible right to relief for \na failure-to-accommodate claim.  See e.g., Gonzales v. Marriott Intโl, Inc., 142 F. Supp. 3d 961, \n978 (C.D. Cal. 2015) (denying defendantsโ motion to dismiss a pregnancy discrimination claim \nfor failure to accommodate where the plaintiff alleged she was a โmember of a protected class of \nwomen affected by pregnancy-related conditions, that she sought accommodation for her \npregnancy-related condition, and that she was denied an accommodation . . . but that defendants \naccommodate[d] other employees with disabilities or medical conditions that require[d] \n23 \n \n\nreasonable accommodationsโ); see also Durham v. Rural/Metro Corp., 955 F.3d 1279, 1286-87 \n(11th Cir. 2020) (explaining that the plaintiff โsatisfied the fourth prong of her prima facie caseโ \nfor failure to accommodate under the PDA where her temporary lifting restriction based on her \npregnancy was akin to that of her colleagueโs lifting restriction stemming from an on-the-job \ninjury).  Accordingly, Frontierโs motion to dismiss Plaintiffsโ disparate treatment claims is \ndenied. \na.  Disparate Impact Claims \nAt the outset, it is important to note that โ[d]isparate-impact claims may be based on any \nemployment policy, not just a facially neutral policy.โ  Adams v. City of Indianapolis, 742 F.3d \n720, 731 (7th Cir. 2014) (discussing Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U.S. 977, 991 \n(1988) (โWe conclude, accordingly, that subjective or discretionary employment practices may \nbe analyzed under the disparate impact approach in appropriate cases.โ).  In the context of Title \nVII, disparate impact claims โchallenge โemployment practices that are facially neutral in their \ntreatment of different groups but that in fact fall more harshly on one group than another and \ncannot be justified by business necessity.โโ  Ellis v. United Airlines, Inc., 73 F.3d 999, 1006 \n(10th Cir. 1996) (quoting Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, 507 U.S. 604, 609 (1993)). \nโTo establish a prima facie case of disparate impact discrimination, plaintiff must prove a \nโspecific identifiable employment practice or policy caused a significant disparate impact on a \nprotected group.โโ  Chavez v. Coors Brewing Co., 176 F.3d 488 (10th Cir. 1999) (citation \nomitted). \nHere, Frontier argues that claims four, six, eleven, and fourteen should be dismissed for \ntwo principal reasons: (1) Plaintiffs fail to identify a specific employment practice or policy that \ncaused a disparate impact; and (2) Plaintiffs fail to offer any statistical data of a disparate impact. \n24 \n \n\n(ECF No. 49 at 16-17.) \nThe Court disagrees that Plaintiffs have failed to identify any specific employment \npolicies that had a disparate impact.  As alleged in the complaint, Plaintiffs accrue points for \npregnancy-related absences, despite Frontierโs stated policy of not assigning points for โexcusedโ \nabsences, including certain recognized disability.  Further, Plaintiffs allege that the harms they \nsuffered as a result of the Dependability Policy were disproportionate to those suffered by non-\npregnant flight attendants because of the need to miss work for pregnancy-related medical care.  \nThus, the Court finds the complaint identifies specific policies that have a disparate effect on \npregnant and breastfeeding employees. \nThe Court also disagrees that Plaintiffs have made no allegations, involving statistics or \nany other form of data, with respect to any disparate impact they suffered due to pregnancy or \nbreastfeeding.  Plaintiffs allege that all pregnant flight attendants are harmed by Frontierโs \ncategorical refusal to provide pregnancy-related accommodations, while zero flight attendants \nwho were not pregnant are impacted by this policy.  Plaintiffs also claim that โvirtually allโ \nbreastfeeding flight attendants who require accommodations when returning to work are harmed \nby Frontierโs failure to provide adequate pumping accommodations while zero flight attendants \nwho are not breastfeeding are subject to or impacted by this policy.  Thus, the complaint \nprovides โfair noticeโ of the disproportionate impact of Frontierโs employment policies.  \nAccordingly, Frontierโs motion to dismiss Plaintiffsโ disparate impact claims is denied. \n2.  WANMA Claim \nFrontier asks the Court to dismiss the WANMA claim, arguing that Plaintiffs did not \nallege a failure or refusal to provide rooms for lactation and that Frontier is not required to \nprovide immediate access to a lactation room under the statute.  (ECF No. 49 at 17.)  Plaintiffs \n25 \n \n\nargue that their allegation is not that Frontier was required to provide immediate access to a \nlactation room, but rather that they lacked any access to a location to pump breast milk at most \nairports to which Frontier flies.  (ECF No. 54 at 13.)  Specifically, Frontier never informed Ms. \nSchwartzkopf of any lactation rooms at Denver International Airport, its principal hub.  (Id.)  \nMoreover, when Frontier did provide lactation rooms for employee use, it denied requests for \nbreak time so that employees would have adequate time to express breast milk.  (Id.) \nColorado law requires employers to โprovide reasonable unpaid break time or permit an \nemployee to use paid break time, meal time, or both, each day to allow the employee to express \nbreast milkโ and the โemployer shall make reasonable efforts to provide a room or other location \nin close proximity to the work area, other than a toilet stall, where an employee can express \nbreast milk in privacyโ for up to two years after the childโs birth.  Colo. Rev. Stat. ยง 8-13.5-\n104(1)-(2). \nBecause an inherent part of a flight attendantโs job is to travel out-of-state, it is difficult \nto frame the parameters of their work area and even more difficult to pinpoint what constitutes a \nclose proximity to that area.  Frontier flight attendants, even though based in Colorado, spend \nmuch of their workday inflight, with limited, if any, private space, other than the lavatory to \npump breast milk.  Once reaching a terminus outside Colorado, it would seemingly be difficult \nfor Frontier to provide accommodations at each airport to which it flies.  While the statute does \nnot require it to do so, Frontier must still make a reasonable effort to provide a location or other \naccommodation for employees to express breastmilk, and as indicated in the complaint, Frontier \nhas made no such effort. \nOf equal concern, Frontier has allegedly failed to provide breastfeeding flight attendants \nwho resort to pumping breast milk in airport restrooms break time necessary to do so as \n26 \n \n\nprescribed under the statute.  As explained by Ms. Rewitzer in the complaint, Frontier refuses to \noffer any accommodations to nursing flight attendants or provide break times between flights to \npump and flight attendants who have disclosed to Frontier that they are breastfeeding, have been \nprohibited from using break time to pump breast milk.  (ECF No. 1 at ยถยถ 75, 83.)  Ultimately, \nPlaintiffs have alleged a plausible right to relief.3  Accordingly, Frontierโs motion to dismiss \nPlaintiffsโ WANMA claim is denied. \n3.  Timeliness of Plaintiffsโ Claims \nFrontier argues that a portion of Plaintiffsโ claims under Title VII and CADA and that \nPlaintiffsโ FMLA claim are time barred by the respective statute of limitations.  (ECF No. 49 at \n18.)  In response, Plaintiffs argue that their Title VII and CADA claims should be allowed to \nproceed based on the single-filing rule or continuing violation doctrine because they seek \nforward-looking relief based on discriminatory policies, and that their FMLA claims should \nprocced because the applicable statute of limitations is three, not two, years.  (ECF No. 54 at 15-\n16.) \nThe statute of limitations is an affirmative defense and is more aptly raised in the \nโdefendantโs answer than through a motion to dismiss.โ  Kerby v. Commodity Res. Inc., 395 F. \nSupp. 786, 791 (D. Colo. 1975); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c)(1).  However, โwhen the dates \ngiven in the complaint make clear that the right sued upon has been extinguished,โ the issue may \n \n3 Frontier also argues that it should be exempt from complying with WANMA since the law provides no express \nlanguage that it applies extraterritorially.  The Court finds it need not decide that issue at this stage of the \nproceedings as the facts alleged in the complaint, viewed in a light most favorable to Plaintiffs, indicate that at least \na portion of Ms. Rewitzerโs requests for regular breaks to pump breast milk and for convenient pumping locations \npertained to accommodations in Colorado. \n \nFrontier further argues that accommodating certain breastfeeding requests would impose an undue hardship.  The \nCourt also finds that it need not decide that issue at this stage of the proceedings because undue hardship is an \naffirmative defense that Frontier bears the burdening of establishing at trial rather than on the pleadings.  See Exby-\nStolley v. Bd. of Cty. Commissioners, 979 F.3d 784, 822 (10th Cir. 2020) (โIn short, undue hardship is an affirmative \ndefense, and, consequently, the [defendant] bears the burden to establish it at trial.โ). \n27 \n \n\nbe raised in a motion to dismiss.  Aldrich v. McCulloch Properties, Inc., 627 F.2d 1036, 1041 n.4 \n(10th Cir. 1980).  That is not the case here. \nBased on the limited record before the Court and the nature of the claims asserted, it is \ndifficult to decern precisely when the statute of limitations began to run for Plaintiffsโ claims.  \nMoreover, the fact that Plaintiffs alleged the discriminatory policy or practice is ongoing and \nevoke the single-filing exception and the continuing violation doctrine indicate that resolution of \nthe statute of limitations affirmative defense with respect to Plaintiffsโ Title VII and CADA \nclaims is better left to some factual development.  See Animal Care Sys., Inc. v. Hydropac/Lab \nProd., Inc., No. 13-CV-00143-MSK-BNB, 2015 WL 1469513, at *12 (D. Colo. Mar. 26, 2015) \n(declining to resolve a statute of limitations defense on a motion to dismiss where the allegations \nwere โnot specific enough to resolve what precisely forms the basis or timingโ of when \nplaintiffโs โclaims accrued, and therefore, when the relevant statute of limitations attached); see \nalso Mearin v. Vidonish, No. Civ. A. 08-597, 2009 WL 5166258, at *3 (W.D. Pa. Dec. 29, 2009) \n(finding that โdismissal on the basis of the statute of limitations is not appropriate but is better \nleft to some factual developmentโ where plaintiff evoked the doctrine of equitable tolling in his \nresponse). \nThe same is true for Plaintiffsโ FMLA claim.  Typically, a FMLA claim must be brought \nwithin โ2 yearsโ of the alleged violation.  29 U.S.C. ยง 2617(c)(1).  That timeframe, however, is \nextended to โ3 yearsโ where a claim is based on a โwillful violation.โ  Id. ยง 2617(c)(2).  \nWillfulness, in the FMLA context, means โa plaintiff must demonstrate that his employer โknew \nor showed reckless disregardโ for whether its conduct was prohibited.โ  Bass v. Potter, 522 F.3d \n1098, 1104 (10th Cir. 2008) (citation omitted). \nHere, Plaintiffs allege that they used FMLA leave based on the qualifying condition of \n28 \n \n\npregnancy, Frontier was aware the Plaintiffs were pregnant, and that Frontier interfered with \nPlaintiffsโ rights to FMLA leave by assessing them points under the Dependability Policy.  At \nthis stage of the proceedings, these allegations are sufficient to create a plausible claim of a \nwillful FMLA violation.  See Ramsey v. Advance Stores Co., No. 15-4854-RDR, 2015 WL \n3948119, at *5 (D. Kan. June 29, 2015) (denying a motion to dismiss an FMLA claim alleging \nwillfulness where the complaint stated plaintiff was fired after taking leave even though she was \neligible for FMLA and defendant was aware of plaintiffโs qualifying condition); see also Hudson \nv. Indep. Blue Cross, LLC, No. CV 18-3631, 2019 WL 1045303, at *3 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 5, 2019) \n(โAt the motion to dismiss stage, courts often take a less stringent approach in assessing whether \nan alleged FMLA violation is willful.โ) \nAccordingly, Frontierโs motion to dismiss with regard to the statute of limitations is \ndenied. \n4.  Plaintiffsโ Class Claims \nFor its last attack on the sufficiency of the complaint, Frontier argues that the proposed \nclasses are facially overbroad and should be stricken or dismissed.4  (ECF No. 49 at 20.)  \nPlaintiffs contend that this argument is premature, or, in the alternative, that the class can be \nreadily ascertained by objective criteria.  (ECF No. 54 at 22-23.) \nIn general, a motion to strike is โa drastic remedy . . . disfavored by the courts.โ  Francis \nv. Mead Johnson & Co., No. 1:10-CV-00701-JLK, 2010 WL 3733023, at *1 (D. Colo. Sept. 16, \n2010) (citation and quotation omitted).  Motions to strike class allegations at the pleading stage \nare subject to a high standard of proof because โit requires a reviewing court to โpreemptively \nterminate the class aspects of . . . litigation, solely on the basis of what is alleged in the \n \n4 While Frontier brings its motion to strike under Rule 23(d)(1)(D), it is proper under Rule 12(f). \n29 \n \n\ncomplaint, and before plaintiffs are permitted to complete the discovery to which they would \notherwise be entitled on questions relevant to class certification.โโ  Id. (quoting Bryant v. Food \nLion, Inc., 774 F.Supp. 1484, 1495 (D.S.C. 1991). \nTo meet this stringent burden, Frontier must โdemonstrat[e] from the face of plaintiffsโ \ncomplaint that it will be impossible to certify the classes alleged by the plaintiffs regardless of \nthe facts the plaintiffs may be able to prove.โ  Id. (emphasis and alternation in original).  Frontier \nhas not done so here. \nAs alleged in the complaint, Plaintiff will seek to certify two classes of plaintiffs: (1) a \npregnancy class and (2) a breastfeeding class.  (ECF No. 1 at ยถ 144.)  Contrary to Frontierโs \nargument that each putative class is overboard because they may include plaintiffs who were not \ninjured by its policies, โcertification requirements neither require all class members to suffer \nharm or threat of immediate harm nor Named Plaintiffs to prove class members have suffered \nsuch harm.โ  DG ex rel. Stricklin v. Devaughn, 594 F.3d 1188, 1198 (10th Cir. 2010).  Plaintiffs \nallege that they can meet the requirements for class certification under Rule 23, and the facts \nsupporting that contention are to be viewed as true at this stage of the proceedings.  Francis, \n2010 WL 3733023, at *1 (explaining that โeven at the class certification stage, courts must \ngenerally accept as true the allegations supporting certification and must not base their \ndetermination on whether the class will ultimately succeed in establishing each element \nnecessary to prove its claimsโ) (citation omitted). \nThus, the Court finds Frontier has not shown it is impossible to certify the classes alleged \nin the complaint.  See e.g., Friedman v. Dollar Thrifty Auto. Grp., Inc., No. 12-CV-02432-WYD-\nKMT, 2013 WL 5448078, at *4 (D. Colo. Sept. 27, 2013) (declining to strike class allegations on \nthe pleadings because defendant had โnot shown that the claims at issue [were] impossible to \n30 \n \n\ncertify).  Accordingly, Frontierโs motion to dismiss with respect to the class claims is denied. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nBased on the forgoing, Frontierโs Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 49) is DENIED. \nDATED this 14th day of July, 2021.  \n              BY THE COURT: \n   \n \n \n____________________________________ \nRAYMOND P.

(ECF No. 49 at 13.) This \n  argument, however, was subsequently abandoned after Frontier learned that Plaintiffs had received notice of right \nto sue on that claim (ECF No. 57 at 7). Thus, it will not be addressed by the Court. \n \n2  Since filing the complaint, Ms. Hodgkins and Ms. Crowe have each given birth and breastfed. (ECF No. 54 at 6.) While \n  neither Plaintiff explicitly indicated an immediate intention to have another child and breastfed in the complaint, \nthis does support the finding that the allegations are sufficient to show a reasonable expectation that the same \ncontroversy will occur to the same complaining party. \n \n3  Frontier also argues that it should be exempt from complying with WANMA since the law provides no express \n  language that it applies extraterritorially. The Court finds it need not decide that issue at this stage of the \nproceedings as the facts alleged in the complaint, viewed in a light most favorable to Plaintiffs, indicate that at least \na portion of Ms. Rewitzerโs requests for regular breaks to pump breast milk and for convenient pumping locations \npertained to accommodations in Colorado. \nFrontier further argues that accommodating certain breastfeeding requests would impose an undue hardship. The \nCourt also finds that it need not decide that issue at this stage of the proceedings because undue hardship is an \naffirmative defense that Frontier bears the burdening of establishing at trial rather than on the pleadings. See \nExby-Stolley v. Bd. of Cty.

Named Plaintiffs in this case are female flight attendants at Frontier Airlines, with \nseveral decades of flying experience between them, who had children and breastfed their babies \nduring their employment with Frontier. They chose their careers as flight attendants because of \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 67\ntheir love of travel, their joy in meeting new people and learning about different places, and their \ndedication to helping others. Like most expectant parents, when it came time to start their \nfamilies, they were overjoyed to start this exciting new chapter of their lives. At the same time, \nthey were dedicated to the careers they loved and assumed they would be able to continue \nworking while raising their childrenโafter all, the right to keep your job during pregnancy and \nafter having a baby has been the law for more than 40 years, since the enactment of the \nPregnancy Discrimination Act (โPDAโ). Yet Plaintiffs found themselves faced with mounting \nobstacles once they became pregnant that forced them to make impossible choices between their \nfamilies and their livelihoodโprecisely the type of choices that the PDA was intended to \nprevent.  \n2.  Frontierโs failure to account for Plaintiffsโ needs related to pregnancy and \nbreastfeeding caused them to suffer serious penalties, both at and outside of work, simply \nbecause they had children. Plaintiffs faced discipline for absences related to pregnancy, and were \neventually forced onto unpaid leave weeks or months before their due dates with no alternatives, \ndepriving them of critical income when they needed it the most. With no paid parental leave and \nonly the short unpaid leave required by federal law under the Family and Medical Leave Act \n(โFMLAโ)โif any remained to themโ Plaintiffs were all still breastfeeding their newborns \nwhen it came time for them to return to work. Yet Frontier refused to make it possible for them \nto pump breast milk on the job, which they needed to do to be able to continue nursing. This left \nPlaintiffs with the Hobsonโs choice of continuing to breastfeed or earning a paycheck. Plaintiffs \npaid a steep price as a result of these policies, including being forced onto unpaid leave, forced to \ngive up breastfeedingโalong with the many associated benefits for themselves and their \nbabiesโand forced to work under conditions that have caused them physical pain and emotional \n2 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 67\ndistress and have put their health at risk.  \n3.  For example, after Frontier refused to honor her requests for accommodations, \nsuch as schedule modifications that would enable her to pump between flights or temporary \nreassignment to a ground position, Plaintiff Stacy Rewitzer was forced off the job during the \nentire duration of the period she was breastfeeding. Plaintiff Renee Schwartzkopf was afraid to \nrequest accommodations at all for fear of losing her income, and was left with no choice but to \npump breast milk for her child in an unsanitary airplane lavatory, fearing daily the loss of her \njob. Plaintiff Melissa Hodgkins made the heartbreaking decision to give up breastfeeding in \norder to return to work following the birth of both of her babies due to the lack of available or \nappropriate accommodations. Plaintiff Heather Crowe was faced with the same painful decision \nearlier this year when Frontier ignored her requests for a temporary ground position so she could \ncontinue to breastfeed her newborn. \n4.  Frontierโs policies and practices challenged here are a legacy of the long and \nunfortunate history of sex discrimination in the airline industry as a whole. Most airlines at one \ntime had explicit policies forcing female flight attendants off the job when they got married or \nbecame pregnant, subjecting them to discriminatory requirements related to their weight and \nappearance, and imposing blatant gender stereotypes. One infamous ad contained the tagline, \nโIโm Cheryl, fly me!โ Although many of these more overt practices have been abandoned in the \nface of lawsuits and public outcry, more subtle forms of discrimination persist, many of which \nhave the same effect of forcing women off the job, especially when they become pregnant or \nhave children.  \n5.  Frontierโs policies and practices have had precisely that effect. Plaintiffs allege on \nbehalf of themselves and a class of all similarly situated workers that Frontier has systematically \n3 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 67\ndiscriminated against pregnant and breastfeeding flight attendants by penalizing them for \npregnancy-related absences protected under the FMLA, singling out pregnancy and \nbreastfeeding for worse treatment than other conditions, and failing to comply with Colorado \nlaws that require employers to accommodate pregnancy and related medical conditions and \nspecifically mandate the provision of break time and a private, sanitary location to pump. \nPlaintiffs seek commonsense policy changes that would enable pregnant and breastfeeding flight \nattendants to continue working and eliminate the many disadvantages they suffer, compensation \nfor themselves and other women who have been similarly harmed, as well as a declaration that \nFrontierโs policies and practices were unlawful. \n6.  The principal policies and practices challenged in this case include:    \na.   Penalization of Pregnancy Under the Dependability Policy: Like all \npregnant workers, Plaintiffs required regular prenatal care, and several developed medical \nconditions such as fatigue, pain, swelling, or nausea that required them to take time off \nfrom work. Yet under its strict โdependability policy,โ Frontier penalized them and other \npregnant flight attendants for certain absences related to pregnancy. This practice \ndiscriminated against Plaintiffs by treating pregnancy-related absences worse than other \ntypes of absences, including non-pregnancy-related absences under the FMLA and \nabsences resulting from disabilities, and deterred Plaintiffs from using their legally \nprotected rights to pregnancy-related FMLA leave. \nb.   Forced Unpaid Leave and Refusal to Accommodate Pregnancy: As is \ntrue for all pregnant flight attendants, particularly in the third trimester, Plaintiffs also \neventually developed restrictions during the course of their pregnancies that rendered \nthem unable to continue flying. As a result, Plaintiffs and other pregnant flight attendants \n4 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 67\nfound themselves grounded, often months before they had their babies, and forced to go \non unpaid leave. Yet Frontier provided no options for flight attendants that would have \nenabled them to continue working during the period when they were grounded. Frontier \nhas ignored or outright denied requests for temporary job reassignment from Plaintiffs \nand other pregnant flight attendants who have sought such an accommodation, while \nproviding flight attendants with similar restrictions for reasons other than pregnancy the \noption to seek a temporary alternative assignment in a ground position. \nc.   Refusal to Accommodate Breastfeeding and Ban on Pumping on Duty: \nBecause Frontier offered flight attendants neither paid time off for recovery from \nchildbirth nor any parental leave, and because many flight attendants used a significant \nportion of or exhausted their available leave under the FMLA due to being forced off the \njob at a certain point during their pregnancies, they were often expected to return to work \nwithin mere weeks of giving birth. Although many flight attendants, including Plaintiffs, \nwere still breastfeeding when they returned to work, Frontier had no policy to address \nflight attendantsโ needs for accommodations related to breastfeeding. Frontier provided \nneither breaks to express breast milk nor accessible, sanitary facilities for flight \nattendants to use for pumping while they were working. And Frontier has systematically \nrefused to respond to Plaintiffsโ requests for accommodations related to breastfeeding and \nto provide any such accommodations. Instead, Frontier has categorically denied all \nrequested accommodations that would allow flight attendants who are breastfeeding to \nremain on the job, and informed them they would not be permitted to return to work until \nthey were cleared of any restrictions, including that they no longer needed \naccommodations to pump. Frontier has gone so far as to prohibit flight attendants from \n5 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 67\npumping at all while on the job, even during breaks from their duties. Because flight \nattendants commonly work eight- to twelve- hour days, this effectively amounts to a ban \non continuing to breastfeed after returning to work.  \n7.  Plaintiffs allege, on behalf of themselves and the Classes they seek to represent, \nthat Frontierโs treatment of flight attendants who are pregnant or breastfeeding has violated and \ncontinues to violate state and federal law, including: Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 42 \nU.S.C. ยงยง 2000e, et seq.

This Court also has jurisdiction pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 \nU.S.C. ยง 2201. \n10.  Personal jurisdiction over Frontier Airlines is proper because Frontier does \nbusiness in the state of Colorado, including operating its principle place of business in Denver \nCounty, Colorado, and a principle airline hub at Denver International Airport; because a \nsubstantial part of the events giving rise to the action occurred in Denver, Colorado; and because \n6 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 67\nthe employment records relevant to the challenged employment practices are maintained and \nadministered in this District. \n11.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b) because a substantial part of the \nemployment practices alleged to be unlawful were committed in and around Denver, Colorado. \n12.  This Court has pendent jurisdiction over Plaintiffsโ Colorado state law claims \nbrought under the Colorado Law on Reasonable Accommodations for Pregnancy and Related \nConditions, CADA, and WANMA, as those claims arise from the same nucleus of operative \nfacts as Plaintiffsโ federal statutory claims. \nPARTIES \n13.

The typical duration of pregnancy is 40 weeks.  \n22.  The condition of being pregnant does not by itself disqualify a flight attendant \nfrom flying.  \n23.  To decrease risks of negative health outcomes, pregnancy requires regular \nprenatal care, including regular doctorsโ visits that increase in frequency as a pregnancy \nprogresses. \n24.  For some individuals, pregnancy may cause physiological changes and conditions \nsuch as morning sickness, swelling, fatigue and pelvic pain. Depending on their individual health \ncircumstances, a pregnant flight attendantโs health care provider may also place restrictions on \nperforming specific activities. These conditions or restrictions are likely to limit a pregnant flight \nattendantโs ability to perform their job duties at a certain point during the pregnancy. The point at \n                                                           \n1 For purposes of this Complaint, the term โbreastfeedingโ includes both feeding a baby breast milk directly from the \nbreast or feeding pumped breast milk from a bottle or other feeding method. The terms โbreastfeedingโ and \nโlactationโ are also used interchangeably to describe the condition of the human body that results in production and \nsecretion of breast milk.  \n8 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 67\nwhich that happens varies from person to person depending on individual medical circumstances \nalong with other factors. \n25.  Lactation is the production and secretion of breast milk by the mammary glands. \nLactation arises following and as a direct result of pregnancy and childbirth due to hormones \nsecreted in the body during and after birth. \n26.  A broad consensus exists among medical and public health experts that \nbreastfeeding is optimal for infants for a year or longer following birth, and that it has broad \ndevelopmental, psychological, social, economic and environmental benefits. According the \nUnited States Surgeon General, breastfeeding protects babies from illnesses like ear, skin, and \nrespiratory infections, diarrhea, and vomiting, as well as longer-term conditions such as obesity, \ntype 1 and 2 diabetes, and asthma. In addition, those who breastfeed their babies for the \nrecommended duration themselves benefit from lower risks of post-partum depression, breast \ncancer, heart disease, and other ailments.    \n27.  All major leading medical associations, including the American Academy of \nPediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Public Health \nAssociation, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Academy \nof Nutrition and Dietetics, and the World Health Organization endorse breastfeeding as optimal \nbecause of the demonstrated health benefits both for those who breastfeed and their infants. \n28.  The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants be fed breast milk \nexclusively for the first six months following birth, and that after six months, they be fed \nprimarily breast milk supplemented by other foods. Breastfeeding is recommended for at least a \nyear โor as long as is mutually desired by mother and infant.โ  \n29.  Those who are breastfeeding and are separated from their babies must remove, or \n9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 67\nโexpress,โ breast milk from the breast, on roughly the same schedule as the babyโs feeding \nschedule. This is usually accomplished by using a breast pump, which is a manual or electric \ndevice for drawing milk from the breasts by suction, and the process of removing breast milk \nfrom the breasts with a pump is referred to as โpumping.โ Regular pumping ensures that there is \na supply of milk on hand for the baby to take from a bottle regardless of whether the \nbreastfeeding parent is physically present and helps to maintain adequate production of breast \nmilk.  \n30.  While the pumping schedule varies from person to person based on numerous \nfactors, those who are breastfeeding typically need to pump breast milk every two to three hours \nfor the first year of their babyโs life. \n31.  The process of pumping typically takes between 15 and 25 minutes, depending on \nthe individual. \n32.  The process of pumping can, if necessary, be terminated at a momentโs notice in \nroughly the same amount of time it would take to terminate a trip to the restroom for other \nphysiological needs. \n33.  Failure to remove milk from the breasts with sufficient frequency causes pain, \nswelling, discomfort, and leaking breast milk, and can lead to medical complications, including \nblocked ducts or mastitis, an infection of the breast tissue, as well as diminished milk supply, and \nultimately cessation of lactation altogether.  \n34.  In accordance with the medical consensus in support of breastfeeding, the United \nStates and the State of Colorado have adopted policies that support continuation of breastfeeding \nupon return to the workforce. \n35.  Obstacles to pumping at work are associated with shorter duration of \n10 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 67\nbreastfeeding and are a leading reason that many workers terminate breastfeeding despite their \ndesire to continue doing so.  \n36.  A restroom or lavatory is generally not considered an appropriate place to express \nbreast milk and should be used only as a last resort. Even if a restroom is kept clean, the potential \nfor contamination by harmful bacteria makes it risky to handle either breast pumping equipment \nor breast milk itself. There are also concerns related to comfort, privacy, and availability that \napply to both single-user and multi-user facilities.  \n37.  In accordance with the strong medical consensus on the benefits of breast milk \nand breastfeeding, and in accordance with their doctorsโ recommendations, all Plaintiffs wished \nand intended to breastfeed their babies.  \nB.  COMMON FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS AS TO FRONTIERโS POLICIES AND \nPRACTICES RELEVANT TO PREGNANCY AND BREASTFEEDING \n \nPenalization of Pregnancy-Related Absences Under Frontierโs โDependabilityโ Policy \n \n38.  At all relevant times Frontier had a policy of requiring employees to notify \nFrontier as soon as the employee learned they were pregnant.  \n39.  At all relevant times Frontier maintained and continues to maintain a \nโDependability Policyโ under which flight attendants were assigned points for each attendance \nโoccurrenceโ such as an absence or tardinessโincluding trips missed due to illness. \n40.  Per the Employee Handbook in effect during the relevant time period, flight \nattendants received 1.5 points per occurrence even if they had a medical excuse from their \ndoctor. Flight attendants began to face disciplinary action after accruing three to four points and \nwere subject to termination after accruing eight points. Points would โroll offโ after twelve \nmonths, but the clock for the twelve-month roll-off period would be frozen during the period of \nany FMLA or medical leave of absence, including time off to recover from childbirth.  \n11 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 67\n41.  The Dependability Policy exempted certain types of absences from accruing \npoints, including โabsences for approved leaves.โ Such leaves might include FMLA leaves, \nmilitary leaves, and medical leaves. Excused absences did not trigger accrual of points under the \npolicy. The policy further permitted absences to be excused for reasons including โprevious \novertime, road trips, scheduled training classes, weather conditions or individual (such as a \nrecognized disability-related situation) or facility/business conditionsโ upon approval by the \nmanager of the department.  \n42.  The Dependability Policy allowed flight attendants with six months of perfect \nattendance to be awarded two credit points to their โbankโ of available days off for twelve \nmonths, which could result in up to six hours (three hours if part-time) of bonus pay over a \ntwelve-month period.  \n43.  Frontierโs discriminatory Dependability Policy has resulted in harsh consequences \nfor pregnant flight attendants. Although a pregnancy-related absence should qualify as an \nabsence that would not accrue points under the Dependability Policy because it qualifies for \nFMLA leave, in practice, Frontier has routinely assigned points to flight attendants for absences \nrelated to pregnancy and has refused to re-code those absences after the fact in a manner that \nwould exempt them from accruing points.  \n44.  The Dependability Policy also made it nearly impossible for pregnant flight \nattendants to achieve perfect attendance records due to common pregnancy-related health issues \nas well as the need to obtain regular prenatal care.  \nForced Unpaid Leave and Refusal to Accommodate Pregnancy \n \n45.  Flight attendants who lose their certification to fly during pregnancy are grounded \nand placed on FMLA leave if they qualify, or on medical leave if they do not. \n12 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 67\n46.  Frontier did not offer paid leave to flight attendants who were grounded due to \npregnancy or related conditions. Any FMLA or medical leave taken by flight attendants who \nwere grounded as a result of pregnancy or pregnancy-related conditions was unpaid, except to \nthe extent that a flight attendant was able to use any accrued paid time off during the leave.  \n47.  Frontier has maintained a policy, pattern or practice of refusing to engage in an \ninteractive process with or to provide reasonable accommodations, including temporary \nalternative job assignments, to flight attendants who are grounded due to pregnancy or related \nconditions. Instead Frontier has ignored or categorically denied all requests for accommodation \nthat would enable pregnant flight attendants to continue working during the period when they are \ngrounded. \n48.  At all relevant times, Frontier has maintained a policy pursuant to the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act (โADAโ) under which it engages in an interactive process with and \nprovides reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities, including \naccommodations such as job restructuring, modified work schedules, reassignment to vacant \npositions, and adjustment or modification of job duties. \n49.  At all relevant times, Frontier has also maintained a policy or practice of \nproviding accommodations such as temporary alternative job reassignment to flight attendants \nwith medical conditions unrelated to pregnancy or childbirth, including flight attendants with on-\nthe-job injuries.  \n50.  Upon information and belief, Frontier has provided temporary ground \nassignments to flight attendants recovering from on-the-job injuries resulting from incidents \nranging from falling off of the employee bus, tripping on ice, having hot coffee splattered in the \nface, and tripping in the airplane aisle.  \n13 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of 67\n51.  Upon information and belief, Frontier has also offered a flight attendant who \nsuffered from a pulmonary embolism off of the job and who was not fit to fly the opportunity to \nwork at Frontierโs General Office in connection with recruiting. \n52.  Upon information and belief, Frontier has permitted flight attendants with medical \nconditions and on-the-job injuries to work at a Goodwill Industries thrift store or to do office \nwork while receiving a paycheck from Frontier. For example, upon information and belief, \nFrontier assigned at least one other flight attendant to work at a Goodwill Industries thrift store \nwhen she was injured on the job due to turbulence. \nRefusal to Accommodate Breastfeeding and Ban on Pumping While on Duty \n \n53.  During the relevant time period, Frontierโs Collective Bargaining Agreement \n(โCBAโ) referenced โmaternity leave,โ but did not have any policy providing for a specified \nperiod of paid or unpaid maternity leave or parental leave for flight attendants after giving birth, \noutside of what may have been available under the FMLA. Instead, Frontierโs โmaternity leaveโ \nconsisted of the period of unpaid leave that commenced when the flight attendant lost clearance \nto fly during pregnancy. \n54.  Flight attendants who take time off after giving birth are placed on FMLA leave if \nthey qualify, or on medical leave if they do not. Both forms of leave are unpaid. Medical leaves \nare intended for an employeeโs own illness, injury, or pregnancy, and are granted at the \ndiscretion of Frontier.  \n55.  Many flight attendants, including several of the Plaintiffs, use or used a \nsignificant amount of the twelve weeks available under FMLA during their pregnancy and \ntherefore were due to return to work before they had fully recovered from childbirth. Many flight \nattendants, including all Plaintiffs, were still breastfeeding their babies at the time they were due \n14 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of 67\nto return to work.  \n56.  At all relevant times, Frontier had no written policies related to flight attendants \nwho were breastfeeding. \n57.  At all relevant times, Frontier has not asked flight attendants who are preparing to \nreturn to work following childbirth whether they intend to pump at work. Unless the flight \nattendant specifically requested accommodations related to breastfeeding, Frontier did not \ndiscuss or provide guidance to flight attendants as to what was or was not permitted with respect \nto pumping on the job.  \n58.  At all relevant times, Frontier has provided flight attendants with break time for \nphysiological needs such as using the restroom, but it has not provided break time for the \npurpose of expressing breast milk for their nursing child. \n59.  At all relevant times, Frontier has not provided any non-bathroom locations near \nemployeesโ work areas where flight attendants who are breastfeeding are able to pump breast \nmilk while they are working. \n60.  At all relevant times, pumping in the lavatory was a widespread practice among \nflight attendants who were breastfeeding, despite it being unsanitary, cramped, and \nuncomfortable. \n61.  Frontier has maintained a policy, pattern, or practice of refusing to provide \nreasonable accommodations to flight attendants who were breastfeeding that would have enabled \nthem to continue breastfeeding and still return to work without risking their health. Instead \nFrontier has ignored or categorically denied all accommodation requests related to breastfeeding. \n62.  Frontier has maintained a policy, pattern, or practice of requiring flight attendants \nwho request accommodations related to breastfeeding, including Plaintiffs, to be clear of all \n15 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 16 of 67\nrestrictionsโโand specifically, of restrictions related to their need to pump breast milkโin order \nto return to duty.  \n63.  Frontier has maintained a policy, pattern, or practice of prohibiting flight \nattendants who request accommodations related to breastfeeding, including Plaintiffs, from \npumping while on duty.  \n64.  Flight attendants at Frontier commonly work ten to twelve hours a day, with flight \ntimes ranging from approximately one to five hours. Frequently, flight attendants have overnight \ntrips of two to four nights in length, spanning multiple cities.  \n65.  Under Frontierโs CBA, flight attendants bid for their schedules about a month \nprior to the schedule being issued. Bidding is based on seniority such that flight attendants with \nlonger tenure with the company, and thus more seniority, receive priority in bidding for flights.  \n66.  As a result of the seniority system, flight attendants who have been with the \ncompany less time have even less control over their schedules than those with more seniority. \nFlight attendants with lower seniority tend to be younger than those with more seniority, and \nmany with lower seniority are at an age where they are starting and/or growing their families. \n67.  It is difficult or impossible for most flight attendants who are breastfeeding to bid \nfor and obtain a schedule that would consistently provide short enough flights and a long enough \ntime on the ground between flights to allow them to pump regularly or at all between flights on \nor off the airplane, without also resorting to pumping during the flight. \n68.  There is typically a period of time lasting around 45 minutes between flights; \nhowever, flight attendants are required to report to the aircraft 45 minutes before departure and \nhave duties on board both before and after each flight.  \n69.  The flight attendantsโ duties of deplaning, cleaning, and reboarding the aircraft \n16 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 17 of 67\nfrequently take up all the available time on the ground between flights such that flight attendants \nare generally unable to leave the plane between flights. Additionally, the period on the ground is \nsometimes compressed due to flight delays.  \n70.  Flight attendants may experience longer duty days without prior notice during \nperiods of โIrregular Operations,โ which are defined as disruptions in the schedule caused by \ncircumstances outside of Defendantโs control. Shifts may last up to 16 hours a day during \nIrregular Operations.  \n71.  Once the plane is airborne, flight attendantsโ duties include snack and beverage \nservice, collecting trash, and responding to individual passenger inquiries.  \n72.  When these duties are complete, there are frequently substantial periods of time \nwhen flight attendants are unoccupied. During such times, it is customary for them to talk, eat, or \nread in the back of the plane. It is commonplace for flight attendants to take short breaks or visit \nthe restroom during those unoccupied periods. \n73.  Frontier does not prohibit or monitor in any way flight attendantsโ breaks or use \nof the restroom while on duty to take care of other personal or physical needs, such as going to \nthe bathroom, applying makeup, or otherwise attending to their personal appearance. \n74.  Frontier flight attendants are trained to attend to emergencies, including \nemergencies when one or more other crewmembers are incapacitated.  \n75.  Despite flight attendantsโ freedom to use their unoccupied time more or less as \nthey desire, Frontier has banned flight attendants who disclose that they are breastfeeding from \nusing this time to pump breast milk while they are on duty. \n \n \n17 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 18 of 67\nC.  INDIVIDUAL FLIGHT ATTENDANTSโ/CLASS REPRESENTATIVESโ \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n \nStacy Rewitzer \n76.  Ms. Rewitzer has been employed as a flight attendant at Frontier since 2006. Ms. \nRewitzer became pregnant with her son in August 2015 and worked until the 28th week of her \npregnancy.  \n77.  Due to complications associated with her high-risk pregnancy, Ms. Rewitzer \nexhausted her FMLA leave during the first trimester of her pregnancy. As a result, she went on \nโnon-FMLA medical leaveโ and personal leave when she was no longer able to fly. Aside from \nseveral days that were covered by accrued paid vacation leave, the leave was unpaid.  \n78.  Ms. Rewitzer gave birth on May 17, 2016 and was cleared by her doctor to return \nto work on August 9, 2016, with a restriction on lifting, pushing, pulling, or carrying more than \n25 pounds.  \n79.  On August 23, 2016, Ms. Rewitzer spoke with Frontierโs Manager in Workers \nCompensation & Leaves of Absence, Julie Pariseau, to inquire about breastfeeding \naccommodations for Ms. Rewitzerโs return to work, and specifically, about Frontier providing a \nplace other than a restroom to express breast milk every two to three hours. She also raised the \npossibility of a temporary ground assignment. During that conversation, Ms. Pariseau asked Ms. \nRewitzer why she was not resigning due to her need for breastfeeding accommodations.  \n80.  Frontier provided Ms. Rewitzer with a list of approved lactation rooms at \noutstations but did not respond to any of her other requests or offer her any assistance modifying \nher schedule. Instead, Frontier suggested that Ms. Rewitzer bid for trips with adequate ground \ntime to allow for breaks to pump on the ground before and after the flight, without identifying \nany such options or offering any alternatives for when there was inadequate ground time to \n18 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 19 of 67\npump. When Ms. Rewitzer conveyed that it would not be possible to continue breastfeeding \nwithout accommodations, Frontier unilaterally placed Ms. Rewitzer on a non-FMLA medical \nleave.  \n81.  On August 26, 2016, Ms. Rewitzer emailed Ms. Pariseau to inform her that she \nwould be willing to continue working for Frontier in another capacity if Frontier was not able to \nprovide accommodations that would allow her to continue performing her duties as a flight \nattendant. Ms. Rewitzer suggested that she could work at Frontierโs General Office one or two \ndays a week to help with hiring or fill in for someone who was on vacation. Frontier never \nresponded to this request.  \n82.  Over the next several months, from September 2016 through April 2017, Ms. \nRewitzer made numerous requests proposing a variety of other potential accommodations, \nincluding temporary assignment to a ground position, regular breaks, preference for shorter \nflights and for trips with longer times on the ground, provision of clean, private, secure, and \nconvenient pumping locations at outstations, confirmation that she would not be disciplined for \npumping on board in the galley if necessary during the flight, or an extension of her medical \nleave. Ms. Rewitzer also indicated that she was open to discussing any other alternatives. \nFrontier Human Resources personnel responded by extending Ms. Rewitzerโs medical leave in \n30-day increments.  \n83.  In correspondence with Ms. Rewitzer from February through April 2017, Frontier \nmade clear that it was prohibiting her pumping at all while on duty. In February 2017, Ms. \nPariseau stated that Frontier โcannot offer any accommodations to nursing flight attendantsโ and \nthat there was โno other optionโ than for Ms. Rewitzer to โreturn to work full duty without any \nrestrictions, including nursing accommodations.โ In March 2017, Ms. Pariseau reminded Ms. \n19 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 20 of 67\nRewitzer that she must be released โwithout any restrictions or accommodation requestsโ before \nshe could return to work. In April 2017, Frontier again stated that Frontier โcan not [sic] \naccommodate any restrictions for a safety sensitive positionโ and that if Ms. Rewitzer needed \nany of the requested accommodations then she would โneed to be out on medical leave until [she \nwas] released without restrictions.โ Frontier never responded to her other requests. \n84.  Ms. Rewitzer remained on unpaid medical leave from August 2016 through June \n2017, despite being willing and able to return to work with accommodations.  \n85.  In January 2016, Ms. Rewitzer took medically necessary absences on January 2-6 \nand January 10-14 due to pregnancy and pregnancy-related conditions or disabilities, including \ninsomnia, fatigue, and digestive issues. As a result, she accrued three points under the \nDependability Policy, resulting in her having a total of 7.5 points, leaving her half a point away \nfrom being terminated.  \n86.  Over the next several months, she made repeated requests to have the three points \nshe had accrued in January for pregnancy complications re-categorized as approved FMLA \nmedical leave. Frontier denied each of those requests. \n87.  Ms. Rewitzer also made repeated requests for excused days off for trips on \nFebruary 7-11 due to pregnancy-related health complications. Frontier denied those requests on \nthe ground that the dates coincided with Super Bowl weekend. Ms. Rewitzer worked the trip for \nfear of accruing dependability points, despite her anxiety and her doctorโs recommendation. She \nstopped working immediately after that trip and went on leave for the remainder of her \npregnancy.  \n88.  Frontierโs Dependability Policy harmed Ms. Rewitzer by causing her to accrue \npoints for absences related to pregnancy, deterring her from calling in sick when she was sick or \n20 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 21 of 67\nneeded medical care during her pregnancy for fear of jeopardizing her job, and for fear that she \nwould have no points left after her baby was born should her baby get sick and she need to miss \nwork. \n89.  As a result of Frontierโs policies relating to pregnancy and its refusal to \naccommodate Ms. Rewitzerโs pregnancy or her medical need to express breast milk, Ms. \nRewitzer has suffered economic harms, including lost income, increased out-of-pocket costs of \nhealth insurance, and loss of accrued benefits and seniority, as well as non-economic harms, \nincluding physical pain and suffering and emotional distress. \n90.  Ms. Rewitzer continues to be subject to Frontierโs discriminatory policies and \npractices on an ongoing basis. These policies have impacted and continue to impact her plans \nwith respect to her family and her personal reproductive decisions. \nMelissa Hodgkins \n91.  Ms. Hodgkins has been employed as a flight attendant at Frontier since 2007. \n92.  Ms. Hodgkins has had two children while employed at Frontier, in 2015 and \n2017.  \n93.  Prior to her return to work after both of her pregnancies, Frontier did not inform \nher of any policy regarding flight attendants who are breastfeeding or regarding pumping while \non duty.  \n94.  After having her first baby, Ms. Hodgkins knew that if she were to attempt to \ncontinue breastfeeding, she would have to find a way to pump breast milk while working. She \nunderstood from speaking with other Frontier employees who had nursed their babies that it was \ntheir practice to pump in the aircraft lavatories. Ms. Hodgkins did not want to pump in the \nrestroom because of concerns about sanitation. She also did not think she could make pumping \n21 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 22 of 67\nwork in light of her relatively low seniority and her unpredictable schedule. She therefore \nweaned her baby prior to returning to work, despite her desire to breastfeed until her baby was at \nleast a year old. \n95.  Ms. Hodgkins became pregnant with her second child in April 2017. During her \npregnancy, Ms. Hodgkins accrued 1.5 points under Frontierโs Dependability Policy for an \nabsence in August due to pregnancy-related fatigue. \n96.  Ms. Hodgkinsโ physician informed her that she should not fly after November 16, \n2017 due to a lifting restriction that would commence at that time. On October 17 and 26, 2017, \nMs. Hodgkins requested a ground assignment starting on that date until the end of her pregnancy. \n97.  On October 30, 2017, Frontier denied Ms. Hodgkinsโ request, stating that \nโFrontier does not provide temporary light duty assignments at its corporate headquarters or at \nthe airport as an accommodation to any flight attendant for a medical condition.โ Frontier then \nplaced Ms. Hodgkins on unpaid leave starting on November 8, 2017 stating that she was โnot \ncleared to fly at this time,โ even though it was a week before the lifting restriction placed by her \ndoctor was to take effect. As a result, she was grounded from her already-scheduled flights. \n98.  After she gave birth, Ms. Hodgkins felt that in light of her past experience, her \nonly option was to remain on unpaid medical leave for the period of time she was breastfeeding, \nand then to wean her baby before returning to work.  \n99.  Ms. Hodgkins had also become aware of the experiences of Ms. Rewitzer, as well \nas another flight attendant, Jo Roby, who had been forced onto unpaid leave in January 2017 \nafter inquiring about accommodations for pumping, including requesting schedule modifications \nand permission to pump during flight. Upon information and belief, Ms. Roby, like Ms. \nRewitzer, had been grounded as a result of her accommodation requests, and prohibited from \n22 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 23 of 67\npumping while on duty, on the ground or in flight, on the basis that it would pose safety risks to \nherself and to others.  \n100.  For fear of being grounded, Ms. Hodgkins weaned her baby before returning to \nwork. She would have continued breastfeeding for significantly longer had there been any other \noptions available. \n101.  As a result of Frontierโs policies relating to pregnancy and its refusal to \naccommodate Ms. Hodgkinsโ pregnancy or breastfeeding, Ms. Hodgkins has suffered economic \nharms, including lost income, increased out-of-pocket costs of health insurance, and loss of \naccrued benefits and seniority, as well as non-economic harms, including physical pain and \nsuffering and emotional distress. \n102.  Frontierโs Dependability Policy harmed Ms. Hodgkins by causing her to accrue \npoints for absences related to pregnancy, and deterring her from calling in sick when she was \nherself sick or needed medical care during her pregnancy for fear of jeopardizing her job, and for \nfear that she would have no points left after her babies were born should they get sick and she \nneed to miss work. \n103.  Ms. Hodgkins continues to be subject to Frontierโs discriminatory policies and \npractices on an ongoing basis, and these policies have impacted and continue to impact her plans \nwith respect to her family and her personal reproductive decisions. \nRenee Schwartzkopf \n104.  Ms. Schwartzkopf has been employed as a flight attendant at Frontier since 2006. \n105.  Ms. Schwartzkopf became pregnant with her son in May 2016 and worked until \napproximately the 34th week of her pregnancy, in late December 2016, when she went out on \nleave. Aside from the four weeks that were covered by accrued paid vacation, her parental leave \n23 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 24 of 67\nwas unpaid. \n106.  After she gave birth to her son by cesarean section on January 30, 2017, Ms. \nSchwarzkopfโs doctor certified that she could return to work without restrictions on April 1, \n2017.  \n107.  Frontier required Ms. Schwartzkopf to attend a day-long recurrent training on \nApril 21, 2017 before she could return to flying. Her son was three months old at the time and \nshe had a medical need to express breast milk every two to three hours for about 10 to 20 \nminutes. \n108.  Ms. Schwartzkopf informed Frontier of her medical need for breaks to express \nbreast milk during training and submitted the required โRequest for Accommodationโ \npaperwork, which required her doctor to describe her medical โimpairment.โ She submitted the \nform and was permitted breaks to pump breast milk during the training.  \n109.  Although Frontierโs Human Resources and Leave of Absence departments were \naware that Ms. Schwartzkopf was breastfeeding due to her accommodation requests prior to the \nApril training, the company never advised her of any policy regarding pumping in flight or told \nher that she was prohibited from doing so.  \n110.  Frontier also never provided Ms. Schwartzkopf with a list of approved locations \nto pump, either at Denver International Airport or at outstations.  \n111.  Ms. Schwartzkopf was aware that Frontier had prohibited some breastfeeding \nflight attendants who had requested accommodationsโincluding Ms. Rewitzer and Ms. Robyโ\nfrom pumping breast milk while on duty, and that as a result of Frontierโs refusal to provide \nreasonable accommodations for breastfeeding, they had been placed on unpaid medical leave.  \n112.  Several flight attendants who had breastfed their children told Ms. Schwartzkopf \n24 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 25 of 67\nthat it was common practice for employees who were nursing to pump on board the plane during \nquiet periods of a flight.  \n113.  Ms. Schwartzkopf and her family were not in a financial position to risk months \nwithout her income. She feared that she, too, would be forced onto unpaid leave if she requested \nadditional accommodations.  \n114.  She bid for and was awarded a Job Share (part-time hours) for MayโJune 2017 \nand returned to a regular full-time flight schedule in July 2017. At the time she returned to work \nin April 2017, she was still breastfeeding. \n115.  It was generally not feasible for Ms. Schwartzkopf to pump on the ground in \nbetween flights because the time between flights was too short and she was typically engaged in \nactive duties related to deplaning and boarding passengers, preparing the airplane for the next \nflight, and conducting the required safety checks.  \n116.  It was not possible for her to bid for a schedule that would consistently involve \nshort enough flights and long enough time on the ground between flights to allow her to pump in \nthe airport facilities.  \n117.  Ms. Schwartzkopf had no choice but to pump in the family bathroom in Denver \nInternational Airport, or in the airplane lavatory while the plane was in flight between the times \nwhen she was actively engaged in her duties. All of these options were unsanitary.  \n118.  Ms. Schwartzkopf did not request prior permission or inform a supervisor because \nshe feared she might be prohibited from pumping in flight and forced onto unpaid leave, or that \nshe might face disciplinary action that could cost her job.  \n119.  As a result of Frontierโs policies and practices relating to pregnancy and its \nrefusal to accommodate Ms. Schwarzkopfโs pregnancy or her medical need to express breast \n25 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 26 of 67\nmilk, Ms. Schwartzkopf suffered non-economic harms, including physical pain and suffering and \nemotional distress. \n120.  Frontierโs Dependability Policy deterred Ms. Schwartzkopf from calling in sick \nwhen she was herself sick or needed medical care during her pregnancy, for fear of jeopardizing \nher job, and for fear that she would have no points left after her baby was born should her baby \nget sick and she need to miss work. \n121.  Ms. Schwartzkopf continues to be subject to Frontierโs discriminatory policies \nand practices on an ongoing basis, and these policies have impacted and continue to impact her \nplans with respect to her family and her personal reproductive decisions. \nHeather Crowe \n122.  Ms. Crowe has had three children while employed at Frontier, in October 2013, \nMay 2016, and June 2018.  \n123.  After each of her pregnancies, prior to her return to work, Frontier did not inform \nher of any policy regarding flight attendants who are breastfeeding or regarding pumping while \non duty.  \n124.  When Ms. Crowe returned to work after each of her first two pregnancies, her \nschedule did not allow her sufficient time to pump on the ground in between flights. She \ntherefore expressed milk in the aircraft lavatory during the times she was not actively engaged in \nher duties. She often did not feel comfortable taking sufficient time to fully empty her breasts, \nand she suffered from pain and engorgement on numerous occasions.  \n125.  On two separate occasions Ms. Crowe was informed by a fellow flight attendant \nwhile she was pumping in the lavatory that a passenger was having a medical emergency. Ms. \nCrowe immediately removed her pump and exited the lavatory to assist. On each occasion it took \n26 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 27 of 67\nless than one or two minutes to stop pumping, exit, and start to assist with the passenger. \n126.  During Ms. Croweโs second pregnancy, she had sinus infections that were \nexacerbated by her pregnancy, but she feared being absent from work because she might accrue \npoints under the Dependability Policy. During her third pregnancy, she again suffered from a \nsinus infection and was unable to fly. Despite presenting Frontier with a note from her doctor, \nshe still accrued points under the Dependability Policy for her absence. \n127.  After the birth of her second child, she sought to extend her leave beyond the time \nthat remained to her under the FMLA in order to breastfeed. Frontier denied her request, stating \nthat non-FMLA Medical Leave โmay only be used for your own illness or injuryโ and that the \nโnature of [her] request noted does not meet the criteria of an illness or injury.โ Only after she \nwas diagnosed with post-partum depression did Frontier extend her medical leave.  \n128.  During her third pregnancy, Ms. Crowe requested medical leave until her son had \nobtained seven or eight months of age, and after that, a ground position so that she could \ncontinue to pump breast milk when she returned to work. Frontier ignored her request for a \ntemporary ground position, but ultimately granted Ms. Crowe unpaid non-FMLA leave from \nAugust 18, 2018 through February 9, 2019.  \n129.  During her third pregnancy, she again suffered from a sinus infection and was \nunable to fly. Despite presenting Frontier with medical documentation, including a note from her \nobstetrician regarding her pregnancy-related condition, she still accrued points in March and \nApril 2018 under the Dependability Policy for her pregnancy-related absences.  These points \nremain on Ms. Croweโs record and have led to disciplinary action by Frontier.  \n130.  Ms. Crowe returned to work while she was still breastfeeding her third child and \nhad no choice but to pump in the unsanitary airplane lavatory. \n27 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 28 of 67\n131.  As a result of Frontierโs policies relating to pregnancy and its refusal to \naccommodate Ms. Croweโs pregnancy or her medical need to express breast milk, she has \nsuffered economic harms, including lost income, increased out-of-pocket costs of health \ninsurance, and loss of accrued benefits and seniority, as well as non-economic harms, including \nphysical pain and suffering and emotional distress. \n132.  Frontierโs Dependability Policy harmed Ms. Crowe by causing her to accrue \npoints for absences related to pregnancy, and deterring her from calling in sick when she was \nherself sick or needed medical care during her pregnancy for fear of jeopardizing her job, and for \nfear that she would have no points left after her baby was born should her baby get sick and she \nneed to miss work.  \n133.  Ms. Crowe continues to be subject to Frontierโs discriminatory policies and \npractices on an ongoing basis, and these policies have impacted and continue to impact her plans \nwith respect to her family and her personal reproductive decisions. \nD.  EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES AND MEDIATION  \n134.  Plaintiff Stacy Rewitzer filed an EEOC charge concerning the above-allegations \non May 16, 2017. \n135.  Plaintiffs Melissa Hodgkins and Renee Schwartzkopf filed EEOC charges \nconcerning the above-allegations on October 6, 2017. Plaintiff Hodgkins supplemented the \nfactual allegations in her charge on February 9, 2018. \n136.  Plaintiff Heather Crowe filed an EEOC charge concerning the above-allegations \non June 15, 2018. Plaintiff Crowe supplemented the factual allegations in her charge on January \n4, 2019. \n137.  On June 29, 2017, Plaintiffs entered an agreement with Defendant to toll the \n28 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 29 of 67\nstatute of limitations for Plaintiff Rewitzer (nรฉe Schiller)โs WANMA claims as of May 26, 2017 \nthrough the date of receipt of a Right to Sue letter from the EEOC. On October 18, 2019, \nPlaintiffs entered a supplemental agreement to toll the WANMA claims of Plaintiffs \nSchwartzkopf, Hodgkins, and Crowe as of August 8, 2018 through the date of receipt of a Right \nto Sue letter from the EEOC. \n138.  Since the time of the filing of their EEOC charges, Plaintiffs have made multiple \nmediation offers to Frontier. Frontier initially either did not respond or declined to mediate.  \n139.  Most recently, on August 16, 2019, Plaintiffs proposed mediation and agreed to \ncertain terms set by Frontier. Discussions regarding mediation terminated on September 24, \n2019, when Frontier declined to mediate on those terms. Plaintiffs are therefore unable to resolve \ntheir claims through mediation.  \n140.  On December 2, Plaintiffs requested a โNotice of Right to Sueโ from the EEOC.  \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n141.  Ms. Hodgkins, Ms. Schwartzkopf, Ms. Rewitzer, and Ms. Crowe (โNamed \nPlaintiffsโ) incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in the above paragraphs.  \n142.  Named Plaintiffs seek to certify two Plaintiff Classes of flight attendants \nemployed by Defendant Frontier Airlines and harmed by Defendantโs policies and practices \nregarding pregnancy and lactation. Named Plaintiffs will seek to certify the Plaintiff Classes \npursuant to Rules 23(a), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for both the \npurposes of injunctive and monetary relief. In the alternative, Named Plaintiffs will seek to \ncertify the Plaintiff Classes pursuant to Rules 23(a), (b)(2), and (c)(4), or merely under Rules \n23(a) and (b)(2).  \n143.  Named Plaintiffs seek class certification for purposes of the prosecution of all \n29 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 30 of 67\nstate and federal claims alleged herein. The limitations period for each federal or state law claim \nis the full statute of limitations period for each such claim.  \n144.  Named Plaintiffs bring this class action on behalf of the following classes (โthe \nClassesโ), defined as follows: \na.  โPregnancy Classโ: All current and former Frontier flight attendants who \nbecame pregnant at any point during the class period.  \nb.  โBreastfeeding Classโ: All current and former Frontier flight attendants \nwho breastfed, directly or by feeding their child their own expressed breast milk, while \nemployed by Frontier, including those who breastfed while on any form of leave \nfollowing the birth of a child, at any time during the class period. \nRule 23(a) \n145.  Numerosity. The members of the Classes are so numerous that joinder of all \nmembers of the Classes is impracticable. Upon information and belief, according to publicly \navailable sources, Frontier employed approximately 1,500-1,600 flight attendants during the \nrelevant time period, approximately 70% or more of whom (approximately 1,150) were female. \nMore precise numbers are ascertainable through records maintained in the ordinary course of \nbusiness by Defendant. \n146.  Based on approximations drawn from average national fertility rates, between \nforty (40) and fifty-seven (57) flight attendants at Frontier could be expected to give birth each \nyear during the class period. Named Plaintiffs estimate that the Pregnancy Class contains at least \n100 members. \n147.  Based on national statistics on breastfeeding initiation rates showing that for \nbirths in 2016, approximately 83% of women initiated breastfeeding, between thirty-three (33) \n30 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 31 of 67\nand forty-seven (47) flight attendants could be expected to have breastfed each year during the \nclass period. Named Plaintiffs estimate that the Breastfeeding Class contains at least 100 \nmembers. \n148.  Commonality. There are numerous questions of law or fact that are common to \nall members of the Classes. The policies and practices challenged herein applied uniformly to all \ncurrent Frontier flight attendants, including Named Plaintiffs and all members of the Classes. \nNamed Plaintiffs and Plaintiff Class Members were all subjected to and injured by the same \npolicies and practices. These policies and practices include: \na.  For the Pregnancy Class:  \ni.  Frontierโs policy, pattern, or practice of penalizing pregnancy-related \nabsences with accrual of points under its Dependability Policy. \nii.   Frontierโs policy, pattern, or practice of forcing pregnant flight attendants \nonto unpaid leave when they develop a restriction that renders them \nunable to fly during pregnancy and refusing to engage in an interactive \nprocess with or to provide reasonable accommodations to pregnant flight \nattendants during the time when they are grounded.  \nb.  For the Breastfeeding Class: \ni.   Frontierโs policy, pattern, or practice of refusing to engage in an \ninteractive process with or to provide reasonable accommodations to flight \nattendants who are breastfeeding, and of requiring flight attendants who \nare breastfeeding to be โfree of all restrictionsโ in order to return to work. \nii.  Frontierโs policy, pattern, or practice of prohibiting flight attendants from \npumping breast milk while on duty. \n31 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 32 of 67\niii.  Frontierโs refusal to make reasonable efforts to provide reasonable breaks \nand a private location for pumping, other than a lavatory, near employeesโ \nwork areas. \n149.  There are accordingly questions of law and fact common to all members of the \nClasses. Common questions include, but are not limited to: \na.  For the Pregnancy Class:  \ni.  Whether Frontierโs policy, pattern, or practice of penalizing pregnancy-\nrelated absences under its Dependability Policy (a) constitutes disparate \ntreatment because of sex/pregnancy in violation of Title VII and/or \nCADA; (b) has a disparate impact because of sex/pregnancy in violation \nof Title VII and/or CADA; and (c) constitutes interference with rights \nprotected by the FMLA. \nii.  Whether Frontierโs policy, pattern, or practice of forcing pregnant flight \nattendants onto unpaid leave when they develop a restriction that renders \nthem unable to fly during pregnancy and refusing to engage in an \ninteractive process with or to provide reasonable accommodations to \npregnant flight attendants during the time when they are grounded (a) \nconstitutes disparate treatment because of sex/pregnancy in violation of \nTitle VII and/or CADA; (b) has a disparate impact because of \nsex/pregnancy in violation of Title VII and/or CADA; and (c) violates the \nColorado Law on Reasonable Accommodations for Pregnancy, Childbirth, \nand Related Conditions. \n   \n32 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 33 of 67\nb.  For the Breastfeeding Class: \ni.  Whether Frontierโs policy, pattern, or practice of refusing to engage in an \ninteractive process with or provide accommodations to flight attendants \nwho are breastfeeding (a) constitutes disparate treatment because of \nsex/pregnancy in violation of Title VII and/or CADA; (b) has a disparate \nimpact because of sex/pregnancy in violation of Title VII and/or CADA; \nand (c) violates the Colorado Law on Reasonable Accommodations for \nPregnancy, Childbirth, and Related Conditions. \nii.  Whether Frontierโs prohibition on pumping while on duty (a) constitutes \ndisparate treatment because of sex/pregnancy in violation of Title VII \nand/or CADA; and (b) has a disparate impact because of sex/pregnancy in \nviolation of Title VII and/or CADA. \niii.  Whether Frontierโs refusal to make reasonable efforts to provide \nreasonable break time and a private location for pumping, other than a \nlavatory, near flight attendantsโ work areas violates WANMA. \nc.  For both classes, the types of injunctive and/or declaratory relief that \nshould be ordered with respect to the challenged policies and practices challenged herein. \nd.  For both classes, the types of damages that should be awarded to Named \nPlaintiffs and the members of the Classes. \n150.  Defendant is expected to raise common defenses to Named Plaintiffsโ claims, \nincluding that its Dependability Policy is neutral as to pregnancy and is implemented in \ncompliance with the FMLA, that not being pregnant or breastfeeding are bona fide occupational \nqualifications, that it has legitimate non-discriminatory reasons for categorically refusing to \n33 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 34 of 67\naccommodate pregnancy and breastfeeding, that its refusal to accommodate pregnancy and \nbreastfeeding is job-related and consistent with business necessity, that it does not provide \naccommodations to flight attendants for any reason including disability, and/or that it did provide \ncertain accommodations to breastfeeding flight attendants.  \n151.  Typicality. Named Plaintiffsโ claims are typical of the claims of members of the \nClasses. Each of the Named Plaintiffs has been subjected to and harmed by the policies \nchallenged herein. The claims of Named Plaintiffs and the members of the Classes arise from the \nsame policies and practices and rely upon the same legal theories and factual allegationsโ\nnamely, that the challenged policies and practices violate Title VII, the FMLA, the Colorado \nLaw on Reasonable Accommodation of Pregnancy and Related Conditions, CADA, and \nWANMA. Named Plaintiffs and all other members of each Class have suffered similar injuries \nand detrimental effects arising out of and caused by Defendantโs policies, patterns and practices \nas alleged herein. Specifically:  \na.  With respect to the Pregnancy Class: \ni.  Each of the Named Plaintiffs is a flight attendant currently employed by \nFrontier who worked at Frontier during one or more of their pregnancies \nand at the time they gave birth to one or more of their children. \nii.  Each of the Named Plaintiffs was subject to and was harmed by Frontierโs \npolicy, pattern, or practice of assigning โpointsโ for pregnancy-related \nabsences under its Dependability Policy, which caused accrual or fear of \naccrual of Dependability Points during pregnancy, denial of and \ndeterrence from exercising their rights to use leave protected under the \nFMLA, loss of employment benefits, and risk of job loss.  \n34 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 35 of 67\niii.  Each of the Named Plaintiffs was subject to and harmed by Frontierโs \npolicy, pattern, or practice of requiring pregnant flight attendants to go on \nunpaid leave when they develop pregnancy-related restrictions that render \nthem unable to fly, and its refusal to engage in an interactive process or to \nprovide pregnancy-related accommodations.  \niv.  As a result, each of the Named Plaintiffs suffered detrimental effects, \ninjury, and damages, including, but not limited to, losses of income and \nemployment benefits, emotional distress, and pain and suffering. \nb.  With respect to the Breastfeeding Class: \ni.  Each of the Named Plaintiffs breastfed one or more of their babies while \nemployed at Frontier.  \nii.  Each of the Named Plaintiffs was subject to and harmed by Frontierโs \nrefusal to engage in an interactive process or to provide accommodations \nrelated to breastfeeding. \niii.  Each of the Named Plaintiffs was subject to and harmed by Frontierโs \nprohibition on pumping breast milk while on duty.  \niv.  Each of the Named Plaintiffs was subject to and harmed by Frontierโs \nrefusal to make reasonable efforts to provide break time and a private \nlocation for pumping other than a lavatory near flight attendantsโ work \nareas.  \nv.  As a result of these policies, each of the Named Plaintiffs suffered \ndetrimental effects, injury and damages, including, but not limited to, \nlosses of income and employment benefits, emotional distress, and pain \n35 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 36 of 67\nand suffering, and increased risks to their own health. \n152.  Named Plaintiffsโ claims therefore are typical of the claims that could be brought \nby any member of the Classes, and the relief sought is typical of the relief that could be sought \nby each member of the Classes in separate actions.  \n153.  Adequacy. Named Plaintiffs will adequately represent members of the Classes, \ndo not have any conflicts with or interests adverse to those of other Class Members, and are \nrepresented by experienced counsel who have substantial experience in civil rights, employment \ndiscrimination, and class action litigation and who will vigorously prosecute the action on behalf \nof the Classes. Named Plaintiffs understand their obligations as class representatives, have \nalready undertaken steps to fulfill them, and are prepared to continue to fulfill their duties as \nclass representatives in this action.  \nRule 23(b)(2) \n154.  This action is properly maintainable as a class under Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure by both the Pregnancy and Breastfeeding Classes with respect to their \nprayers for declaratory and injunctive relief.  \n155.  Defendant Frontier has acted and refused to act in a manner generally applicable \nto all members of the Classes, thereby making final declaratory and injunctive relief under Rule \n23(b)(2) appropriate with respect to both Classes. The policies, patterns, and/or practices \nchallenged above apply generally and uniformly to the Classes, thereby making final declaratory \nand injunctive relief appropriate as to the whole of each Class.  \nRule 23(b)(3) \n156.  This action is also properly maintainable as a class under Rule 23(b)(3) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure as to both Classes with respect to their damages claims.  \n36 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 37 of 67\n157.  Predominance: The questions of law and fact common to the members of the \nPregnancy and Breastfeeding Classes predominate over questions affecting individual Class \nMembers, and a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nresolution of this controversy.  \n158.  By resolving the common issues described above in a single class proceeding, \neach member of the proposed Pregnancy and Breastfeeding Classes will receive a determination \nof whether Frontier violated Title VII, the FMLA, the Colorado Law on Reasonable \nAccommodations for Pregnancy and Related Conditions, CADA, and WANMA in the same \nuniform manner. \n159.  Members of the Pregnancy and Breastfeeding Classes do not have a significant \ninterest in individually controlling the prosecution of separate actions. Although the damages \nthat the individual Plaintiff Class Members have suffered are not de minimis, their damages are \nmodest compared to the expense and burden of individual prosecution of this litigation.  \n160.  Prosecuting the Pregnancy and Breastfeeding Classesโ claims as a class action \nwill ensure that there are not inconsistent judgments and that a single injunction and ruling on \nliability will apply to all employees of Frontier nationwide, no matter where they reside.  \n161.  The issues raised by the Pregnancy and Breastfeeding Classesโ claims can be \ndecided by means of common, class-wide proof. In addition, if appropriate, the Court can and is \nempowered to fashion methods to efficiently manage this action as a class action.  \n162.  Other than this litigation, Named Plaintiffs are aware of no litigation concerning \nDefendant Frontierโs policies and practices relating to flight attendants who become pregnant \nand/or those who breastfeed.  \n163.  This is not only an appropriate forum for these claims because jurisdiction and \n37 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 38 of 67\nvenue are proper, but it is the most appropriate forum because all of the unlawful employment \nactions took place in this District. Concentration of litigation in this forum is desirable, as this \naction challenges company-wide practices, and it will benefit the Plaintiff Class Members and \nDefendant to have all Class Membersโ claims and defenses adjudicated in a single proceeding. \nPursuit of this action on behalf of a class will provide the most efficient mechanism for \nadjudicating the claims of Named Plaintiffs and the members of the Classes. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n \nTitle VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e  \nDisparate Treatment Because of Sex (Pregnancy) \n \nForced Unpaid Leave &  \nRefusal to Accommodate Pregnancy \n \nAll Plaintiffs on Behalf of Themselves and the Pregnancy Class \n \n164.

Defendantโs refusal to engage in an interactive process with or to provide \nreasonable accommodations to Plaintiffs and members of the Pregnancy Class, while doing so \nfor other flight attendants whose conditions were unrelated to pregnancy but who were similar in \ntheir ability or inability to work, constitutes disparate treatment because of Plaintiffsโ and Class \nMembersโ sex, and because of their pregnancy and related medical conditions, in violation of \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.  \n169.

This results in \ndetrimental effects including monetary losses, losses of earnings and other benefits, and \nemotional harms.  \n176.  Upon information and belief, Defendantโs policy, pattern, or practice of refusing \nto accommodate pregnant flight attendants and forcing them onto unpaid leave has not resulted \nin any non-pregnant flight attendant suffering these detrimental effects. \n177.

Frontier has maintained a policy, pattern, or practice of refusing to engage in an \ninteractive process with or provide reasonable accommodations to flight attendants who are \nbreastfeeding. Instead Frontier has insisted on flight attendants being free of all restrictions \nbefore returning to work, and has ignored or categorically denied all requests for accommodation \n41 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 42 of 67\nthat would enable them to continue breastfeeding and still return to work without risking their \nhealth. \n180.  Plaintiffs and members of the Breastfeeding Class have requested various forms \nof accommodation related to breastfeeding.  \n181.  Frontier has refused to engage in any interactive process with or to provide \nreasonable accommodations to Plaintiffs and Class Members that would have enabled them to \ncontinue breastfeeding while still returning to work.  \n182.  Frontier engages in an interactive process for employees with disabilities and \nconditions unrelated to pregnancy, childbirth, or lactation, and has provided modified duty, \ntemporary alternative job assignments, and other forms of reasonable accommodation to flight \nattendants with temporary and permanent disabilities and medical conditions, to flight attendants \ninjured on the job and to flight attendants who are unable to fly for reasons other than pregnancy \nor related conditions, but who are otherwise similar in their ability or inability to work. \n183.  Defendantโs refusal to engage in an interactive process with or to provide \nreasonable accommodations to Plaintiffs and members of the Breastfeeding Class, while doing \nso for other flight attendants whose conditions were unrelated to pregnancy but who were similar \nin their ability or inability to work, constitutes disparate treatment of Plaintiffs and Class \nMembers because of their sex, and because of pregnancy-related medical conditions, in violation \nof Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.  \n184.  Defendant has also maintained a policy, pattern, or practice of prohibiting flight \nattendants who disclose that they are breastfeeding from pumping breast milk while on duty. \n185.  Defendant has maintained a policy or practice of permitting flight attendants to \ntake breaks while on duty for other purposes, including for eating and attending to other physical \n42 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 43 of 67\nneeds such as using the lavatory, applying makeup, or otherwise attending to personal \nappearance. \n186.  Defendantโs policy or practice of prohibiting flight attendants who disclose that \nthey are breastfeeding from pumping breast milk while on duty, while allowing flight attendants \nto take breaks for reasons unrelated to pregnancy or lactation, constitutes disparate treatment on \nthe basis of sex (pregnancy and lactation) in violation of Title VII.  \n187.

Instead Frontier has insisted on flight attendants being free of all restrictions before \nreturning to work, and has ignored or categorically denied all requests for accommodation that \nwould enable them to continue breastfeeding and still return to work without risking their health. \n192.  Defendantโs policies or practices of refusing to engage in an interactive process \nwith or provide accommodations to breastfeeding flight attendants and of prohibiting pumping \nwhile on duty have a disparate impact on breastfeeding flight attendants, in violation of Title VII \nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.  \n193.  As a result of Defendantโs policy or practice of refusing to engage in an \ninteractive process with or provide accommodations to flight attendants who are breastfeeding \nand of prohibiting pumping while on duty, Plaintiffs and members of the Breastfeeding Class \nhave suffered detrimental effects due to the absence of necessary accommodations, including \nbeing forced to go on unpaid leave, being forced to give up breastfeeding, or, should they \nattempt to continue breastfeeding once they return to work, experiencing physical pain, \nemotional distress, and possible health risks.  \n194.  Upon information and belief, neither Defendantโs policy, pattern, or practice of \nrefusing to accommodate flight attendants who are breastfeeding nor its prohibition on pumping \nwhile on duty has resulted in any non-breastfeeding flight attendant suffering these detrimental \neffects.  \n195.  Plaintiffs have presented Frontier with numerous less discriminatory alternative \nemployment practices that would not have the same discriminatory effects.  \n   \n44 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 45 of 67\nFIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nTitle VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-2(a), 2000e(k) \nDisparate Treatment Because of Sex (Pregnancy) \n \nDependability Policy โ Penalization of Pregnancy-Related Absences  \n \nAll Plaintiffs on Behalf of Themselves and the Pregnancy Class  \n \n196.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference, as if fully set forth herein, each \nand every allegation of this Complaint. \n197.  Defendant has maintained a Dependability Policy, under which flight attendants \nare assigned points for each occurrence of missed work, and face loss of benefits, discipline, or \ntermination upon reaching a certain number of points.  \n198.  On its face, Defendantโs policy provides that certain types of absences are exempt \nfrom accruing points, including those used for FMLA-qualifying reasons and those due to \nโrecognized disability.โ  \n199.  In practice, Frontier has routinely assigned points under the Dependability Policy \nfor absences related to pregnancy instead of treating those absences as exempt from accrual of \npoints. \n200.  Plaintiffs and members of the Pregnancy Class have accrued points under the \nDependability Policy for absences related to pregnancy, including for pregnancy-related illnesses \nand prenatal appointments, even though those absences were protected under the FMLA and \ntherefore should have been treated as approved absences exempt from receiving points.  \n201.  Defendantโs application of its Dependability Policy to Plaintiffs and Class \nMembers constitutes unlawful disparate treatment on the basis of sex and pregnancy in violation \nof Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.

Defendant has retained its discriminatory policies and practices of penalizing \npregnancy-related absences, despite knowledge of their harmful and discriminatory effects.  \n203.  Defendant engaged in this unlawful sex discrimination with either malice or \nreckless indifference to the federally protected rights of Plaintiffs and Class Members. \n204.  As a result of Defendantโs discriminatory implementation of its Dependability \nPolicy, Plaintiffs and Class Members have suffered and continue to suffer harms, including \naccrual of dependability points for absences during pregnancy that should have been treated as \nexcused, being deterred from seeking necessary medical care or taking medically necessary \nabsences during pregnancy, denial of bonuses or other employment benefits related to achieving \na โperfect attendanceโ record, and risk of job loss. \nSIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nTitle VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-2(a), 2000e(k) \nDisparate Impact Because of Sex (Pregnancy) \n \nDependability Policy โ Penalization of Pregnancy-Related Absences  \n \nAll Plaintiffs on Behalf of Themselves and the Pregnancy Class \n205.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference, as if fully set forth herein, each \nand every allegation of this Complaint. \n206.  Defendant has maintained a policy or practice of assigning flight attendants points \nfor each occurrence of missed work, under its โDependability Policyโ as described above. \n207.  Plaintiffs and members of the Pregnancy Class have accrued points under the \nDependability Policy for missing work for reasons related to pregnancy, including for \n46 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 47 of 67\npregnancy-related illnesses and prenatal appointments, even though those absences were \nprotected under the FMLA and therefore should have been treated as approved absences exempt \nfrom receiving points. \n208.

As a result of Defendantโs discriminatory policy or practice, and because common \nphysiological changes during pregnancy commonly impact attendance, Plaintiffs and Class \nMembers have suffered detrimental effects, including accrual of dependability points for \nabsences during pregnancy that should have been treated as excused, being deterred from \nseeking necessary medical care or taking medically necessary absences during pregnancy, denial \nof bonuses or other employment benefits related to achieving a โperfect attendanceโ record, and \nrisk of job loss. \n210.

Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference, as if fully set forth herein, each \nand every allegation of this Complaint. \n212.  Frontier is a covered employer under the FMLA because it had 50 or more \nemployees in 20 or more workweeks during all relevant time periods. \n213.  On its face, Defendantโs Dependability Policy allows approved leaves for FMLA-\nqualifying reasons to be exempt from accruing points. \n214.  In practice, Frontier has routinely assigned points for absences related to \npregnancy, instead of treating those absences as exempt from receiving points due to being \nprotected under the FMLA. \n215.  Plaintiffs and members of the Pregnancy Class have accrued points under the \nDependability Policy for absences related to pregnancy, including for pregnancy-related illnesses \nand prenatal appointments.  \n216.  Defendant has failed to notify pregnant flight attendants, including Plaintiffs and \nClass Members, that their absences due to pregnancy were protected under the FMLA, and \ntherefore should have been treated as approved absences exempt from receiving points under the \nDependability Policy, despite its knowledge that Plaintiffsโ and Class Membersโ absences during \npregnancy were likely protected under the FMLA.  \n217.  Defendant has ignored or denied Plaintiffsโ and Class Membersโ requests for \nmedically necessary absences related to pregnancy to be treated as FMLA leave and therefore \n48 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 49 of 67\nexempt from accruing points under the Dependability Policy. \n218.  Defendantโs application of its Dependability Policy to pregnant flight attendants \nhas interfered with the ability of Plaintiffs and Class Members to exercise their rights under the \nFMLA by discouraging qualified employees including Plaintiffs and Class Members from taking \nmedically necessary pregnancy-related absences for fear of accruing points that could place their \njobs at risk.  \n219.  Defendantโs unlawful implementation of its Dependability Policy was taken \nwillfully and with knowledge that it violated the federally protected rights of Plaintiffs and Class \nMembers. \n220.  Defendantโs unlawful implementation of its Dependability Policy has caused and \ncontinues to cause Plaintiffs and Class Members harms, including accrual of dependability points \nfor absences that should have been treated as excused, being deterred from seeking necessary \nmedical care or taking medically necessary absences during pregnancy, and denial of bonuses or \nother employment benefits related to achieving a โperfect attendanceโ record.  \nEIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n \nWANMA, C.R.S. ยง 8-13.5-101, et seq. \n \nFailure to Provide Lactation Breaks and Location \n \nAll Plaintiffs on Behalf of Themselves and the Breastfeeding Class \n \n221.

The Colorado general assembly made clear through promulgation of WANMA \nโthe medical importance of breastfeeding, within the scope of complete pediatric care,โ and \naimed โto encourage removal of boundaries placed on nursing mothers in the workplace.โ See \n49 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 50 of 67\nC.R.S. ยง 8-13.5-102(2). \n223.

Defendant has failed to make reasonable efforts to provide a private room or \nlocation other than a toilet, close to Plaintiffsโ and members of the Breastfeeding Classโ work \nareas, for employees to express breast milk.  \n225.

Defendant engaged in this unlawful practice with either malice or reckless \nindifference to the legally protected rights of Plaintiffs and Class Members. \n227.  As a result of Defendantโs discriminatory policy or practice, Plaintiffs and Class \nMembers have suffered significant monetary losses, including losses of earnings and other \nbenefits, emotional pain and suffering, physical harm, and other pecuniary and nonpecuniary \nlosses.  \n50 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 51 of 67\nNINTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n \nColo.

Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference, as if fully set forth herein, each \nand every allegation of this Complaint. \n229.  The State of Colorado amended CADA in 2016 to expressly provide for \naffirmative obligations on employers to provide accommodations related to pregnancy and \nbreastfeeding. The new law went into effect on August 10, 2016.  \n230.  Coloradoโs law specifically requires employers to provide reasonable \naccommodations to employees with health conditions related to pregnancy or recovery from \nchildbirth, absent undue hardship.  \n231.  Coloradoโs law requires employers to engage in an interactive process to identify \nreasonable accommodations.  \n232.  Coloradoโs law specifies that reasonable accommodations may include โthe \nprovision of more frequent or longer break periods; more frequent restroom, food, and water \nbreaks; acquisition or modification of equipment or seating; limitations on lifting; temporary \ntransfer to a less strenuous or hazardous position if available, with return to the current position \nafter pregnancy; job restructuring; light duty, if available; assistance with manual labor; or \nmodified work schedules,โ unless the employer would be required to hire a new employee, fire \nany existing ones, or create a new position in order to provide the accommodation. \n51 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 52 of 67\n233.  The statute provides a rebuttable presumption that a particular accommodation \ndoes not impose an undue hardship if the employer has provided a similar accommodation to \nother classes of employees in the past. \n234.  The statute specifies that employers may not โrequire an employee to take leave if \nthe employer can provide another reasonable accommodation for the employeeโs pregnancy, \nphysical recovery from childbirth, or related condition.โ  \n235.  Following the effective date of that statute, Defendant has maintained a policy, \npattern, or practice of requiring flight attendants to cease flying and forcing them to go on unpaid \nleave during their pregnancies and refusing to engage in an interactive process with or to provide \nreasonable accommodations, such as alternative job assignments, to pregnant flight attendants. \nInstead Frontier has ignored or categorically denied all requests for accommodation that would \nenable them to continue working during the period when they are grounded.  \n236.  Plaintiffs and members of the Pregnancy Class have been pregnant in the time \nperiod following the lawโs effective date, and have been subject to Frontierโs policy, pattern, or \npractice of requiring flight attendants to cease flying and forcing them to go on unpaid leave \nwhen they develop a pregnancy-related restriction that renders them unable to fly during their \npregnancies, and refusing to engage in an interactive process with or to provide reasonable \naccommodations to pregnant flight attendants that would enable them to continue working \nduring the period when they are grounded.  \n237.  Frontier has provided modified duty, temporary alternative job assignments, and \nother forms of reasonable accommodation to flight attendants with temporary and permanent \ndisabilities and medical conditions, flight attendants injured on the job, and flight attendants who \nare unable to fly for reasons other than pregnancy or related conditions, but who are otherwise \n52 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 53 of 67\nsimilar in their ability or inability to work. \n238.  Defendant engaged in this unlawful sex discrimination with either malice or with \nreckless indifference to the legally protected rights of Plaintiffs and of Class Members. \n239.  Defendant has retained its discriminatory policies and practices despite \nknowledge of their harmful and discriminatory effects.  \n240.  As a result of Defendantโs unlawful and discriminatory acts, Plaintiffs and Class \nMembers have suffered significant monetary losses, including losses of earnings and other \nbenefits, emotional pain and suffering, physical harm, and other pecuniary and nonpecuniary \nlosses.  \nTENTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n \nColo.

Frontier engages in an interactive process with and has provided reasonable \naccommodations to flight attendants with disabilities, injuries, and medical conditions unrelated \nto pregnancy, childbirth, or lactation, but who are otherwise similar in their ability or inability to \nwork, including modified duty, temporary alternative job assignments in non-flying positions, \nand other forms of reasonable accommodation that have enabled them to continue working. \n246.  Plaintiffs and members of the Pregnancy Class sought accommodations during \ntheir pregnancies, including the option of working in a temporary ground position.  \n247.  Frontier has refused to engage in any interactive process to identify reasonable \neffective accommodations for Plaintiffs and Class Members during their pregnancies.

Plaintiffs and members of the Pregnancy Class have been subject to this policy, \npattern, or practice.  \n55 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 56 of 67\n256.  Defendantโs policy or practice of requiring flight attendants to cease flying and go \non unpaid leave when they develop a pregnancy-related restriction that renders them unable to \nfly during their pregnancies, and of refusing to engage in an interactive process with or to \nprovide reasonable accommodations to pregnant flight attendants that would enable them to \ncontinue working during the period when they are grounded, has a disparate impact on flight \nattendants who are pregnant in violation of CADA.  \n257.  As a result of Defendantโs policy or practice of requiring flight attendants to cease \nflying and go on unpaid leave when they develop a pregnancy-related restriction that renders \nthem unable to fly during their pregnancies, and of refusing to engage in an interactive process \nwith or provide reasonable accommodations to pregnant flight attendants that would enable them \nto continue working during the period when they are grounded, Plaintiffs and Class Members \nhave been and will be forced to go on unpaid leave at some point during or at the end of their \npregnancy when they are no longer medically fit to fly. This results in detrimental effects \nincluding monetary losses, losses of earnings and other benefits, and emotional harms.  \n258.  Upon information and belief, Defendantโs policy, pattern, or practice of refusing \nto accommodate pregnant flight attendants and forcing them onto unpaid leave has not resulted \nin any non-pregnant flight attendant suffering these detrimental effects. \n259.  Plaintiffs have presented Frontier with numerous less discriminatory alternative \nemployment practices that would not have the same discriminatory effects.  \n   \n56 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 57 of 67\nTWELFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n \nColo. Rev. Stat. Ann. ยง 24-34-402.3 \nColorado Law on Reasonable Accommodations for Pregnancy,  \nChildbirth, and Related Conditions  \n \nRefusal to Accommodate Breastfeeding/Lactation;  \nBan on Pumping While on Duty \n \nAll Plaintiffs on Behalf of Themselves and the Breastfeeding Class \n260.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference, as if fully set forth herein, each \nand every allegation of this Complaint. \n261.  The State of Colorado amended CADA in 2016 to expressly provide for \naffirmative obligations on employers to provide accommodations for conditions related to \npregnancy, physical recovery from childbirth, and related conditions. The new law went into \neffect on August 10, 2016.  \n262.  Coloradoโs law specifically requires employers to engage in an interactive process \nto identify reasonable accommodations and to provide reasonable accommodations to employees \nwho are breastfeeding absent undue hardship.  \n263.  Coloradoโs law specifies that reasonable accommodations may include โthe \nprovision of more frequent or longer break periods; more frequent restroom, food, and water \nbreaks; acquisition or modification of equipment or seating; limitations on lifting; temporary \ntransfer to a less strenuous or hazardous position if available, with return to the current position \nafter pregnancy; job restructuring; light duty, if available; assistance with manual labor; or \nmodified work schedules,โ unless the employer would be required to hire a new employee, fire \nany existing ones, or create a new position in order to provide the accommodation. \n264.  The statute specifies the employer may not โrequire an employee to take leave if \nthe employer can provide another reasonable accommodation for the employeeโs pregnancy, \n57 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 58 of 67\nphysical recovery from childbirth, or related condition.โ  \n265.  Plaintiffs and members of the Breastfeeding Class have been breastfeeding and \nhave been denied accommodations in the period following the lawโs effective date. \n266.  Following the effective date of that statute, Defendant has continued to maintain a \npolicy, pattern, or practice of refusing to provide reasonable accommodations to flight attendants \nrelated to breastfeeding/lactation that would enable them to continue breastfeeding while still \nreturning to work without risking their health. Instead Frontier has ignored or categorically \ndenied all accommodation requests related to breastfeeding/lactation. \n267.  Defendant engaged in this unlawful sex discrimination with either malice or \nreckless indifference to the legally protected rights of Plaintiffs and Class Members. \n268.  Defendant has retained its discriminatory policies and practices despite \nknowledge of their harmful and discriminatory effects. \n269.  As a result of Defendantโs unlawful and discriminatory policy, pattern, or \npractice, Plaintiffs and Class Members have suffered significant monetary loss, including loss of \nearnings and other benefits; emotional pain and suffering; physical harm; and other pecuniary \nand nonpecuniary losses. \nTHIRTEENTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n \nColo. Rev. Stat.

Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference, as if fully set forth herein, each \nand every allegation of this Complaint. \n58 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 59 of 67\n271.  Frontier has maintained a policy, pattern, or practice of refusing to engage in an \ninteractive process with or provide reasonable accommodations to flight attendants who were \nbreastfeeding. Instead Frontier has insisted on flight attendants being free of all restrictions \nbefore returning to work, and has ignored or categorically denied all requests for accommodation \nthat would enable them to continue breastfeeding and still return to work without risking their \nhealth. \n272.  Frontier has refused to engage in any interactive process with or to provide \nreasonable accommodations to Plaintiffs and members of the Breastfeeding Class that would \nhave enabled them to continue breastfeeding while still returning to work.  \n273.  Frontier engages in an interactive process for employees with disabilities and \nconditions unrelated to pregnancy, childbirth, or lactation, and has provided modified duty, \ntemporary alternative job assignments, and other forms of reasonable accommodation to flight \nattendants with temporary and permanent disabilities and medical conditions, to flight attendants \ninjured on the job and to flight attendants who are unable to fly for reasons other than pregnancy \nor related conditions, but who are otherwise similar in their ability or inability to work. \n274.  Defendantโs refusal to engage in an interactive process with or to provide \nreasonable accommodations to Plaintiffs and Class Members, while doing so for other flight \nattendants whose conditions were unrelated to pregnancy but who were similar in their ability or \ninability to work, constitutes disparate treatment of Plaintiffs and of Class Members because of \ntheir sex, and because of pregnancy-related medical conditions, in violation of CADA.  \n275.  Defendant has also maintained a policy, pattern, or practice of prohibiting flight \nattendants who disclose that they are breastfeeding from pumping breast milk while on duty. \n276.  Defendant has maintained a policy or practice of permitting flight attendants to \n59 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 60 of 67\ntake breaks while on duty for other purposes, including for eating and attending to other physical \nneeds such as using the lavatory, applying makeup, or otherwise attending to personal \nappearance. \n277.  Defendantโs policy or practice of prohibiting flight attendants who disclose that \nthey are breastfeeding from pumping breast milk while on duty, while allowing flight attendants \nto take breaks for reasons unrelated to pregnancy or lactation, constitutes disparate treatment on \nthe basis of sex (pregnancy and lactation) in violation of CADA  \n278.  Defendant has retained its discriminatory policies and practices of refusing to \naccommodate breastfeeding flight attendants and of prohibiting pumping breast milk while on \nduty, despite knowledge of their harmful and discriminatory effects.  \n279.  Defendant engaged in this unlawful sex discrimination with either malice or \nreckless indifference to the legally protected rights of Plaintiffs and of Class Members. \n280.  As a result of Defendantโs discriminatory policies or practices, Plaintiffs and \nClass Members have suffered significant monetary losses, including losses of earnings and other \nbenefits, emotional pain and suffering, physical harm, and other pecuniary and nonpecuniary \nlosses. \nFOURTEENTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n \nColo.

Frontier has maintained a policy, pattern, or practice of refusing to engage in an \ninteractive process with or to provide reasonable accommodations to breastfeeding flight \nattendants. Instead Frontier has insisted on flight attendants being free of all restrictions before \nreturning to work, and has ignored or categorically denied all requests for accommodation that \nwould enable them to continue breastfeeding and still return to work without risking their health. \n283.  Defendantโs policies or practices of refusing to engage in an interactive process \nwith or provide accommodations to breastfeeding flight attendants and of prohibiting pumping \nwhile on duty have a disparate impact on breastfeeding flight attendants, in violation of CADA.  \n284.  As a result of Defendantโs policy or practice of refusing to engage in an \ninteractive process with or provide accommodations to flight attendants who are breastfeeding \nand of prohibiting pumping while on duty, Plaintiffs and members of the Breastfeeding Class \nhave suffered detrimental effects due to the absence of necessary accommodations, including \nbeing forced to go on unpaid leave, being forced to give up breastfeeding, or, should they \nattempt to continue breastfeeding once they return to work, experiencing physical pain, \nemotional distress, and possible health risks.  \n285.  Upon information and belief, neither Defendantโs policy, pattern, or practice of \nrefusing to accommodate flight attendants who are breastfeeding nor its prohibition on pumping \nwhile on duty has resulted in any non-breastfeeding flight attendant suffering these detrimental \neffects.  \n286.  Plaintiffs have presented Frontier with numerous less discriminatory alternative \nemployment practices that would not have the same discriminatory effects. \n61 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 62 of 67\nFIFTEENTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n \nCADA, Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. ยง 24-34-402  \nDisparate Treatment Because of Sex (Pregnancy) \n \nDependability Policy โ Penalization of Pregnancy-Related Absences  \n \nAll Plaintiffs on Behalf of Themselves and the Pregnancy Class  \n \n287.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference, as if fully set forth herein, each \nand every allegation of this Complaint. \n288.  Defendant has maintained a Dependability Policy, under which flight attendants \nare assigned points for each occurrence of missed work, and face loss of benefits, discipline, or \ntermination upon reaching a certain number of points.  \n289.  On its face, Defendantโs policy provides that certain types of absences are exempt \nfrom accruing points, including those used for FMLA-qualifying reasons and those due to \nโrecognized disability.โ  \n290.  In practice, Frontier has routinely assigned points under the Dependability Policy \nfor absences related to pregnancy instead of treating those absences as exempt from accrual of \npoints. \n291.  Plaintiffs and members of the Pregnancy Class have accrued points under the \nDependability Policy for absences related to pregnancy, including for pregnancy-related illnesses \nand prenatal appointments, even though those absences were protected under the FMLA and \ntherefore eligible to be treated as approved absences exempt from receiving points.  \n292.  Defendantโs application of its Dependability Policy to Plaintiffs and Class \nMembers constitutes unlawful disparate treatment on the basis of sex and pregnancy in violation \nof CADA. By assigning Plaintiffs and Class Members points for pregnancy-related absences, \nwhile excusing absences unrelated to pregnancy, such as those approved as FMLA leave for \n62 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 63 of 67\nreasons unrelated to pregnancy and those due to a โrecognized disability,โ Frontier has treated \nPlaintiffs and Class Members less favorably than other employees similar in their ability or \ninability to work.  \n293.  Defendant has retained its discriminatory policies and practices of penalizing \npregnancy-related absences, despite knowledge of their harmful and discriminatory effects.  \n294.  Defendant engaged in this unlawful sex discrimination with either malice or \nreckless indifference to the legally protected rights of Plaintiffs and of Class Members. \n295.  As a result of Defendantโs discriminatory implementation of its Dependability \nPolicy, Plaintiffs and Class Members have suffered and continue to suffer harms, including \naccrual of dependability points for absences during pregnancy that should have been treated as \nexcused, being deterred from seeking necessary medical care or taking medically necessary \nabsences during pregnancy, denial of bonuses or other employment benefits related to achieving \na โperfect attendanceโ record, and risk of job loss.  \nSIXTEENTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n \nCADA, Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. ยง 24-34-402,  \nDisparate Impact Because of Sex (Pregnancy) \n \nDependability Policy โ Penalization of Pregnancy-Related Absences \n \nAll Plaintiffs on Behalf of Themselves and the Pregnancy Class \n296.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference, as if fully set forth herein, each \nand every allegation of this Complaint. \n297.  Defendant has maintained a policy or practice of assigning flight attendants points \nfor each occurrence of missed work, under its โDependability Policyโ as described above. \n298.  Plaintiffs and members of the Pregnancy Class have accrued points under the \nDependability Policy for missing work for reasons related to pregnancy, including for \n63 \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03469-RM-MEH   Document 1   Filed 12/10/19   USDC Colorado   Page 64 of 67\npregnancy-related illnesses and prenatal appointments, even though those absences were \nprotected under the FMLA and therefore should have been treated as approved absences exempt \nfrom receiving points. \n299.  Defendantโs application of its Dependability Policy to pregnant flight attendants \nhas a disparate impact on flight attendants affected by pregnancy and related medical conditions \nin violation of CADA.  \n300.  As a result of Defendantโs discriminatory policy or practice, and because common \nphysiological changes during pregnancy commonly impact attendance, Plaintiffs and Class \nMembers have suffered detrimental effects, including accrual of dependability points for \nabsences during pregnancy that should have been treated as excused, being deterred from \nseeking necessary medical care or taking medically necessary absences during pregnancy, denial \nof bonuses or other employment benefits related to achieving a โperfect attendanceโ record, and \nrisk of job loss. \n301.  Upon information and belief, Defendantโs policy, pattern, or practice of \npenalizing pregnant flight attendants for absences related to pregnancy has not resulted in any \nnon-pregnant flight attendant suffering these detrimental effects. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court enter judgment in their \nfavor and against Defendant, and grant them all relief as allowed by law and equity, including, \nbut not limited to, the following: \nA.
