    "summary": "<p>This case is part of the Clearinghouse's special collection on the Attica Uprising. In September of 1971, incarcerated people in New York's Attica Correctional Facility took control of the prison and took several staff members hostage. The uprising ended when state police violently stormed the prison, killing over 40 incarcerated people and staff members. Attica was one of the most significant events in the American prisoners' rights movement and drew public attention to poor conditions in prisons across the country. The uprising, retaking, and their aftermaths spawned numerous lawsuits, many of which are included in this special collection.</p>\r\n<p>This case concerns suspected uprising leaders being placed in administrative segregation after the retaking.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Filing and Initial Litigation</strong></p>\r\n<p>This is a class action brought by people placed in administrative segregation after the retaking because they were suspected to be the leaders in the uprising. The class was initially comprised of 38 people, but later dropped to 14. On October 26, 1971, the plaintiffs filed their initial complaint against the Attica superintendent. An amended complaint, which changed the named plaintiffs, was filed November 29, 1971. The plaintiffs filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York. District Judge John Curtin was appointed to the case.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed suit under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, alleging violations of the Eighth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment. They claimed their equal protection and due process rights were violated when they were placed in administrative segregation because they were not notified of the disciplinary charges against them and were not given the chance to appear before the disciplinary committee. They also argued the conditions in the unit amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. They sought declaratory, injunctive, and mandamus relief. More specifically, they wanted the court to order the defendant to release them from the segregation unit.</p>\r\n<p>On October 28, 1971, the court ordered the defendant to show cause why the plaintiffs&rsquo; relief should not be granted. In response, the defendant submitted an affidavit which said the plaintiffs were in segregation because they were the suspected leaders of the uprising and needed to be isolated during the investigation into the uprising. After that response, the court held a hearing on December 1, 1971. The court heard testimony from an Attica official about the conditions in the segregation unit, but not about the procedures used to put the plaintiffs in the unit.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The District Court's Orders </strong></p>\r\n<p>On December 13, 1971, the court partially granted the plaintiffs' requests. 338 F.Supp. 311. First, the court granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; request for class certification. The class included all people being held in the segregation unit. Next, the court found that the conditions in the unit did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. However, the procedures used to put the class members in the segregation unit did violate due process. Attica officials were required to confront the plaintiffs with the accusations and evidence against them and provide them an opportunity to respond, and they failed to do so.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Lastly, the court denied the plaintiffs&rsquo; request to issue an order requiring their release from the unit. However, the court did order the defendant to schedule appearances for all class members before the disciplinary committee within 72 hours. The defendant was also instructed to provide the court with weekly reports about the class members&rsquo; placement.</p>\r\n<p>On December 16, 1971, the defendant moved the court to reconsider the December 13th order because they alleged it conflicted with another court order. As part of another Attica case, <a href=\"../43284/details\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nieves v. Oswald</a>, Judge John Henderson ordered Attica officials to stop all disciplinary proceedings pertaining to the uprising. Arguments were held on the motion on December 17, 1971. At the hearing, the defendant also argued the plaintiffs were put in segregation to protect them and the security of Attica, not as punishment.</p>\r\n<p>The court responded to the motion on December 21, 1971, finding its order did not conflict with Judge Henderson&rsquo;s order. However, the court credited the defendant&rsquo;s claim that the plaintiffs were put in segregation as protective custody, and not as punishment. So, the court modified the order such that the plaintiffs did not have to be brought before the disciplinary committee since they were not being disciplined. 338 F.Supp. 311. The court explained the plaintiffs could be held in protective custody in the unit 1) if they consented to do so for their safety, or 2) without their consent if there were adequate factual findings they threatened the security of the general population, and plaintiffs had an adequate chance to respond to that evidence. Also, the defendant was ordered to provide the court with forms for each plaintiff saying they consented to being in the unit or that there were sufficient findings against them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>After the new court order, each class member was informed of the evidence suggesting they needed to be in protective custody. They were then given a chance to consent to protective custody or respond to the evidence. Attica officials found there was good cause to keep all but four of the class members in segregation. Those four were returned to the general population.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Appeal to the Second Circuit</strong></p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs appealed the denial of their request for release them from the segregation unit. On September 20, 1972, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the district court&rsquo;s order. 467 F.2d 51. The panel included Circuit Judges Walter Mansfield and William Timbers and District Judge Murray Gurfein. Circuit Judge Mansfield wrote the opinion.</p>\r\n<p>The court of appeals agreed the conditions in the segregation unit did not violate the Eighth Amendment. Next, the court denied the equal protection claim because the evidence showed the plaintiffs would be at risk or would threaten the security of Attica if they were returned to the general population. Finally, the court found the due process claim was meritless. Based on the submissions from the superintendent, there was good cause to keep the class members in segregation and the procedures to place them there were sufficient to comply with due process.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Based on available published opinions, there was no action in the case after the Second Circuit opinion. The case is now closed.</p>",

Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 391 F.2d 555 (2d Cir. 1968). Therefore it is ordered \nthat written notice be given by correctional authorities to each member of the class. See Dolgow v. Anderson, 43 \nF.R.D. 472 (E.D.N.Y.1968). The notice should read as follows: \nSeveral inmates of A Block, 6 Company, have started an action in the United States District Court for the Western \nDistrict of New York. They complain that they are being housed in A Block, 6 Company, without hearings before the \nAdjustment Committee of Attica Correctional Facility. \nThe court has allowed the inmates to sue on their own behalf and on behalf of all inmates of A Block, 6 Company, \nincluding you. If you do not wish to be a part of this action, you should write a letter to Judge John T. Curtin, 614 \nUnited States Court House, Buffalo, New York 14202, stating that you do not want to take part in the action. In \nconnection with this action, the court has ordered that the inmates of A Block, 6 Company, be scheduled for \nappearances before the Adjustment Committee. Even if you have chosen to remain in this action, you need not \nappear before the Adjustment Committee. If you choose to meet with them, the Adjustment Committee will inform \nyou of the behavior which led to your present confinement in A Block, 6 Company. You will also be given an \nopportunity to explain your behavior. The courtโs order does not require you to make an explanation of your \nbehavior. At the conclusion of the meeting, the Adjustment Committee will tell you whether you will be released \ninto general population or whether you will continue to be held in A Block, 6 Company. If the Adjustment \nCommittee directs that you continue to be held in A Block, 6 Company, it will meet with you again each week during \nyour confinement. The Adjustment Committee may also direct that you be given a Superintendentโs Proceeding. \n \n5  The reports should be made in a factual, detailed and informative fashion. Many of the reports received during the \n  trial in Carter v. McGinnis, 320 F.Supp. 1092 (W.D.N.Y.1971), were of no use because the Adjustment Committee did \nnot set forth the information received and in many cases merely stated that the inmate had a โpoor attitudeโ or a \n6 \n \n\n \n \nU.

It \ninvolves a loss of privileges and may have an adverse effect on โgood timeโ and the chance for parole. Protective \nconfinement does restrict an inmateโs movement within the facility and his contacts with inmates in the general \npopulation, but it is not punitive in intent and does not entail a loss of privileges or โgood time.โ \n \n2  The notice should read as follows: \n \nSeveral inmates of A Block, 6 Company, have started an action under the Civil Rights Act in the United States District \nCourt for the Western District of New York. They complain that they are being housed in A Block, 6 Company, \nwithout due process of law. \nThe court has allowed the inmates to sue on their own behalf and on behalf of all inmates of A Block, 6 Company, \nincluding you. If you do not wish to be a part of this action, you should write a letter to Judge John T. Curtin, 614 \nUnited States Court House, Buffalo, New York 14202, stating that you do not wish to take part in the action. At a \nhearing on December 17, 1971, the court was informed by correctional officials that the inmates of A Block, 6 \nCompany,  are  in  protective  confinement  and  that  the  Superintendent  will  immediately  determine  whether \nsubstantial evidence justifies each inmateโs continued confinement in A Block, 6 Company. On December 20, the \ncourt ordered that the review begin within 48 hours and that each inmate be informed of the evidence against him \nand given an opportunity to respond. The Superintendent may communicate with the inmate in person or in writing \nas the Superintendent chooses. \nEven if you choose to remain in the action, you are not required by the courtโs order or by the Department of \nCorrectional Servicesโ rules to respond to the evidence against you or to make any explanation of your behavior. \nUnder the Departmentโs rules, you may sign a statement consenting to your continued confinement in A Block, 6 \nCompany, and a copy of the statement will be sent to the court by correctional authorities. You may at any time \nrevoke your consent to continued confinement in A Block, 6 Company. If you do not consent to continued \nconfinement in A Block, 6 Company, or if you revoke your consent, you need not reply to the evidence against you. \nIf you do not consent to continued confinement in A Block, 6 Company, or if you revoke your consent, the \nSuperintendent, after examining the evidence, will determine whether you should continue to be confined in A \nBlock, 6 Company, or whether you should be returned to general population. You will be informed of the \nSuperintendentโs findings and a copy of the findings will be sent to the court. If you disagree with his findings, you \nhave the right to write the Commissioner of Correctional Services regarding your confinement. The Commissioner \nwill inform you of his decision within one week of receipt of your communication. \nIf the Superintendent determines that you should continue to be confined in A Block, 6 Company, he will review \nyour confinement at least every two weeks. \nThe court will continue to exercise jurisdiction in the case. \n \n   \n7 \n \n\n \n \nU.
