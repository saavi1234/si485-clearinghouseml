          "description": "ORDER : The Court has received your motion to proceed without prepayment of the filing fee. After your filing fee status is determined, the Court will review your complaint to identify legally sufficient claims and defendants and dismiss any legally insufficient claims. See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1915A. The Court will conduct this review within the next 60 days and inform you of the findings in a Merit Review Order. No other action will be taken in your case during this time, absent extraordinary circumstances. Therefore, you do not need to submit any evidence, argument, motions, or other documents. If you filed a motion for recruitment of counsel along with your complaint, it will not be considered until the merit review is complete. Please note that any motion for recruitment of counsel must include evidence of your own efforts to find counsel, such as a list of the attorneys you contacted and copies of letters you sent or received. See Pruitt v. Mote, 503 F.3d 647, 654-55 (7th Cir. 2007). If you do not receive a Merit Review Order within the next 60 days, you may file a motion requesting the status of your case. In the event your claim(s) survive the merit review, further information and instruction will be provided to you at that time. In addition, several administrative matters warrant mention. Any communication directed to the Court should be in the form of a motion or other pleading and not a letter. Finally, you are advised that if your address changes, you must notify the Court within seven days of the change by filing a Notice of Change of Address. Failure to do so could result in the dismissal of your case. Signed by Judge J. Phil Gilbert on 4/25/2019. (tjk)THIS TEXT ENTRY IS AN ORDER OF THE COURT. NO FURTHER DOCUMENTATION WILL BE MAILED. (Entered: 04/25/2019)"

Plaintiff appeared with counsel, John Knight, Angela Povolish, Frank Battaglia, Joshua Blecher-Cohen and Taylor Brown. Appearing on behalf of defendants were Joshua Gardner, Gary Feldon, Joshua Kolsky, and Laura Jones. The Court was advised of circumstances associated with Dr. Ettner and defendants ability to comply with the Courts order regarding expedited discovery (Doc. 156 ). The Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART 157 Motion re 156 Order on Motion to Compel. The Motion for Relief is GRANTED as to relief from complete compliance by October 19, 2021. The Motion for Relief is DENIED as to keeping the preliminary injunction hearing record open for a period of two weeks after defendants complete their production. Rather, the Court will establish a deadline for defendants to comply with expedited discovery after reviewing the parties status update on October 22, 2021. The parties are reminded to meet and confer and file a status report with the Court by 5:00 PM CDT on October 22, 2021 confirming the following: 1) defendants proposed deadline to the comply with the Courts order on expedited discovery, 2) Dr. Ettners status and availability for November 22, 2021 hearing, 3) Dr. Leukefelds availability for November 22, 2021 hearing, and 4) any additional reasons or considerations as to why the preliminary injunction cannot be held by November 22, 2021. Further, the Court agrees to set aside one full day for this hearing and reset this matter for Monday, November 22, 2021. A separate order will be entered with specific details as to this hearing.

Defendants argue that the Court should grant the motion because it will reduce the burdens on the Court and the parties without causing any undue prejudice. Defendants continue noting that \"the Court's resolution of the PI Motion will therefore directly inform the issues that must be addressed in responding to the Complaint, whether by answering or moving for dismissal under Rule 12\" (Doc. 124, p. 3). While this would reduce Defendants' burden, further briefing on venue and mootness through a Rule 12 motion would reduce the burden on the Court if either party concedes on the venue or mootness issues as it would narrow the issues for the preliminary injunction. If Defendants are seeking more time to prepare the appropriate motions, then they shall have until July 8, 2021 to file an answer or otherwise respond. Signed by Chief Judge Nancy J. Rosenstengel on 6/28/2021. (drr)THIS TEXT ENTRY IS AN ORDER OF THE COURT. NO FURTHER DOCUMENTATION WILL BE MAILED. (Entered: 06/28/2021)"

Defendants continue arguing that \"[t]hese new opinions and baseswhich still have not been disclosed to the government and will presumably be formulated only after Dr. Ettner finally examines Plaintiff on July 20-plainly prejudices Defendants' preparation for the evidentiary hearing only eight days later\" (Id.). Defendants explain that \"[k]nowing sufficiently in advance the precise nature of Dr. Ettner's new opinions would have factored into Defendants' decisions on whether to request a deposition in advance of the evidentiary hearing and which witnesses, if any, Defendants would call to respond to those still-undisclosed opinions\" (Id. at p. 4). Rather than limiting Dr. Ettner's opinions to those she provided in her two declarations in support of Plaintiff's preliminary injunction motion, the Court will postpone the hearing as to the 93 Motion for Preliminary Injunction until after August 9, 2021.

In support of this proposed expedited discovery deadline, Defendants note that \"an average processing rate (i.e., review and redaction) of twenty-five documents per hour and eight-hour review days, it will take twenty-six full days to review the approximately 5,200 collected documents, absent further narrowing.\" (Doc. 161 ). The Court does not have an issue with the estimated time of twenty-five documents per hour. However, Defendants' estimate is based on one attorney doing this work. Defendants have five attorneys entered in on this case. Thus, even if it just these five attorneys reviewing the estimated 5,200 documents for four hours a day it should take less than 11 days. While the Court appreciates Defendants' proposed deadline, a November 22nd deadline is unreasonable based on the necessity of these documents. Accordingly, Defendants are ORDERED to comply with the Court's order on expedited discovery by Friday, November 5, 2021. Signed by Chief Judge Nancy J. Rosenstengel on 10/22/2021.

Defendants argue that \"Plaintiff has raised for the first time in her reply brief an alleged communication between Dr. Elizabeth Stahl, BOP's Chief Medical Officer, and Dr. Charles Langham, Plaintiff's treating physician, concerning an alleged recommendation for Plaintiff to receive gender-affirming surgery and permanent hair removal.\" (Doc. 154, p. 2).

This is not a new argument. In Plaintiff's Motion for Expedited Discovery, Plaintiff notes \"[t]hese records include significant materials relating to Defendants' discussions regarding (and apparent denials of) gender-affirming healthcare for Ms. Iglesias, as well as recent communications between Ms. Iglesias's current healthcare providers and Federal Bureau of Prisons administrators.\" (Doc. 146, p. 2).

Dr. Alix McLearen, Jenna Epplin, John Robinson, Joshua Kolsky, Joshua Gardner, Gary Feldon, Daniel Schwei, and Brian M. Boynton are to appear before the undersigned Chief District Judge to SHOW CAUSE why civil contempt sanctions should not be imposed against the BOP or Dr. Alix McLearen for violating the Court's Preliminary Injunction Order (Docs. 176, 177). Also, they are further ORDERED to SHOW CAUSE why sanctions should not be imposed against the BOP and DOJ attorneys under Rule 11(c)(1) of the Federal Rules of Procedure and the Court's inherent power to sanction. At the hearing, Iglesias's counsel may question Dr. McLearen and Jenna Epplin as to the contents of their previous affidavits and inquire as to NaphCare/BOP's surgeons specializing in GCS, whether BOP/NaphCare has contacted surgeons, determined their waitlists, the tasks touched on page three of Doc. 186, additional administrative hurdles by Iglesias being in an RRC in Florida, and other items the Court deems relevant. Signed by Chief Judge Nancy J. Rosenstengel on 4/20/2022. (drb)THIS TEXT ENTRY IS AN ORDER OF THE COURT. NO FURTHER DOCUMENTATION WILL BE MAILED. (Entered: 04/20/2022)"

    "summary": "<p>In this case, a transgender person incarcerated in the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) sought gender-affirming health care and placement in a women's prison.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff, who was assigned male at birth, filed a pro se complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois on April 12, 2019. The case was assigned to District Judge J. Phil Gilbert. In her complaint, she brought numerous legal claims against BOP officials centered around the agency's failure to provide her with gender-affirming surgery and house her in a women's facility. She also noted that over two decades of incarceration in the BOP, she had attempted suicide and reported sexual abuse at hands of other prisoners on numerous occasions. At the time of filing, the plaintiff was incarcerated at USP Marion, however she was transferred to several other facilities throughout the litigation.</p>\r\n<p>After a few months of initial litigation, including unsuccessful motions for a preliminary injunction by the plaintiff and to dismiss by the defendants, in February of 2020, Judge Gilbert issued an order appointing a local attorney to represent the plaintiff. They were later joined by attorneys from the ACLU and a large Chicago law firm. The case was also transferred from Judge Gilbert to District Judge Nancy J. Rosenstengel.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff's new legal team filed an amended complaint on September 8, 2020. It asserted three constitutional claims against the BOP: failing to provide necessary medical treatment and failing to protect from harm, both in violation of the Eighth Amendment, and denying placement in a women's prison based on biological sex, in violation of the Fifth Amendment's Equal Protection guarantee. The complaint asked for declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorneys' fees. The plaintiff later filed a second amended complaint clarifying that she was bringing her claims directly under the constitution and not under Bivens.</p>\r\n<p>In April 2021, the plaintiff moved again for a preliminary injunction, describing both her history of seeking gender-affirming health care in the BOP and the immediate danger she faced from other prisoners. The BOP opposed this motion, but within a week filed a notice stating that the BOP had recommended the plaintiff be transferred to a women's facility. A month later, she was moved to FMC Carswell.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>While the preliminary injunction motion was pending, the defendants moved to dismiss the case for reasons including venue, the official capacity of defendants, standing, mootness, and failure to state a claim. Judge Rosenstengel denied the motion completely on October 22, 2021.</p>\r\n<p>After several months of litigation about discovery and experts, Judge Rosenstengel held a hearing on the remaining preliminary injunction claims on November 22, 2021. On December 27, she issued an opinion partially granting the preliminary injunction. She ordered the BOP's Transgender Executive Council (TEC), which must approves major treatment and designation decisions for people in BOP custody, to evaluate the plaintiff's request for gender-affirming surgery within the next month. She also required the BOP to transcribe the TEC's meeting, notify the court of its decision and reasoning, and, if the plaintiff's request was granted, take steps to ensure she would receive her surgery promptly. The order was motivated in part by the fact that the plaintiff was nearing the end of her multi-decade prison sentence and could potentially be released before she could receive treatment.</p>\r\n<p>On January 31, 2022, the defendants notified the court that TEC had recommended that the plaintiff consult with a surgeon a month after entering a halfway house. Judge Rosenstengel was not satisfied with this response. In a February 10 order, Judge Rosenstengel complained that the BOP's reasons for denying the plaintiff surgery were \"everchanging\" and suggested the defendants were hoping to continually delay treatment until she was released. Claiming that the defendants had violated the terms of the preliminary injunction, which required the BOP to make a decision on the plaintiff's surgery, she ordered the BOP's attorneys and several staff members to appear for a sanctions hearing. She also ordered the BOP to file weekly updates with the court about its efforts to evaluate the plaintiff for surgery.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff filed an additional motion for a preliminary injunction on March 10. In it, she complained that even after the order to show cause, the BOP was not moving quickly enough to ensure she would receive surgery before her release.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Rosenstengel partially granted that motion in an April 18 order. Noting that the steps taken by the BOP since her December order to evaluate the plaintiff for surgery were inadequate, the court ordered it to provide a timeline for the plaintiff to undergo surgery and recover, identify a surgeon available to perform gender affirming surgery within the remainder of the plaintiff&rsquo;s sentence, and report regularly to the court on its progress, among other things. It also issued another order to show cause why several of the BOP's attorneys and staff members should not be sanctioned.</p>\r\n<p>On April 26, 2022, Judge Rosenstengel canceled the hearing to show cause and instead ordered the defendants to provide the court, by May 6, an outline of the timeline to provide the plaintiff&rsquo;s gender-affirming healthcare. The order required the defendants to continue scheduling appointments with the necessary healthcare professionals and making the plaintiff readily available for her appointments. Additionally, the defendants were required to maintain consistent contact with the plaintiff and her attorneys conferring at least twice weekly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The parties reached a settlement agreement on May 27, 2022. The defendants agreed that, in the event that any of the medical procedures could not be performed within the time that the defendant was in BOP custody, they would provide for all expenses related to the procedures, including food, lodging, transportation, recovery costs, and any home healthcare expenses. They also agreed to deposit $502,000.00 into an escrow account to cover any costs within 13 months of the plaintiff&rsquo;s release from BOP custody and to pay $938,552 in attorneys&rsquo; fees. The parties entered a joint motion on May 27 to revise the previous preliminary injunction to align with the settlement agreement. The settlement agreement also <a href=\"https://www.aclu-il.org/en/press-releases/landmark-settlement-federal-bureau-prisons-agrees-provide-first-ever-gender-affirming\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">had the broader effect</a> of committing the BOP to drafting a mission statement for its TEC and to recognize certain treatments for transgender individuals as medically necessary.</p>\r\n<p>On May 31, 2022, Judge Rosenstengel modified the April 26 order and required that the defendants continue to make the plaintiff available to surgeons for consultations and other care in preparation for the surgeries. Judge Rosenstengel also appointed a special master to oversee the escrow account. The case was stayed in all respects through January 3, 2023, except that the parties were required to continue to file joint status reports on the progress of the plaintiff&rsquo;s medical care.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Status reports submitted by the BOP throughout June and July indicated that they were working with appropriate surgeons and healthcare providers. Delays in care occurred due to scheduling issues and the limited availability of the chosen providers. The plaintiff also tested positive for COVID-19 and required a medically necessary gallbladder surgery. This caused a significant delay. In their August 5, 2022, status update, the BOP explained that they were still working to schedule the procedures prior to the plaintiff&rsquo;s release from BOP custody, which was expected for December 25th, 2022.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In their September 2, 2022, joint status report, the BOP explained that on August 19th the plaintiff, without BOP authorization, left the residential recovery center where she was being housed. The plaintiff was subsequently arrested on August 21st for grand theft auto and was being held by local authorities in Florida. As such, medical appointments for August 23 were rescheduled, as the plaintiff was not expected to be back in BOP custody by that date. The BOP notified the Florida authorities that the plaintiff was to be returned to their custody when released. Future appointments remained scheduled, and the BOP reiterated that they would continue to pursue healthcare pursuant to the May 31 order.</p>\r\n<p>As of October 11, 2022, this case is ongoing.</p>",

As explained in Defendantsโ prior motion for a one-week extension to comply \nwith paragraph 6 of the April 18 preliminary injunction, the parties have been in discussions about a \npotential resolution of Plaintiffโs request for gender-confirmation surgery involving retention of the \nChicago-based surgeon that Plaintiffโs counsel have previously identified.  See ECF No. 242.  The \nparties believe that their discussions have been constructive and agree that it would be in the best \ninterest of all parties to modify the April 18 preliminary injunction to, among other things, provide \nthe parties further time to pursue negotiations over a permanent injunction and/or other potential \nresolution of this case.   \n  Because of the time-sensitive nature of this motion, the parties respectfully request that the \nCourt act on their motion at its earliest opportunity. \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00415-NJR   Document 251   Filed 04/26/22   Page 2 of 5   Page ID #3362\nDISCUSSION \n  In its Memorandum and Order dated April 18, 2022 (ECF No. 238) (โMem. & Orderโ), the \nCourt granted in part Plaintiffโs motion for a modified preliminary injunction.  Mem. & Order at 2, \n20-22.  Among other terms, the modified injunction, ECF No. 239, directs Defendants to provide \ninformation  on  (i) surgeons  who  are  qualified  to  perform  gender-confirmation  surgery, \n(ii) dermatologists who are qualified to perform hair removal in furtherance of gender-confirmation \nsurgery, and (iii) any procurement or contracting issues associated with using the Chicago-based \nsurgeon.  See ECF No. 239 at 1โ3.  The Court also ordered BOP and DOJ counsel to show cause in \nwriting on or before April 28, 2022, why sanctions should not be imposed, ECF No. 238 at 31, and \nset a show-cause hearing for May 9, 2022, ECF No. 243.  On April 20, 2022, Defendants filed an \nunopposed motion for a one-week extension of time to comply with paragraph six of the Courtโs \nApril 18 injunction.  ECF No. 242.  Defendants noted that, given the partiesโ mutual interest in \nsecuring the services of the Chicago-based surgeon and their progress in that direction, they were \nhopeful that some of the other requirements may also prove unnecessary.  Id. at 4 n.1.  Defendants \nnoted that they would keep the Court informed of their efforts and would potentially seek further \nrelief from the Court if appropriate.  Id.  The Court granted Defendantsโ motion for an extension of \ntime.  ECF No. 245. \n  The parties have since continued to make progress toward a potential resolution of this matter.  \nOn April 25, 2022, the parties conferred on a joint motion to modify the preliminary injunction to \nallow the parties to focus their efforts on moving forward with the Chicago-based surgeon and other \nimmediate next steps in connection with providing Ms. Iglesias gender-confirmation surgery.  The \nparties have agreed that it is in their mutual interest for the Court to modify the April 18, 2022 \npreliminary injunction as reflected in Exhibit A, and whose terms can be summarized as follows: \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00415-NJR   Document 251   Filed 04/26/22   Page 3 of 5   Page ID #3363\n๏ท  Defendants will continue scheduling appointments for Plaintiff for laser hair removal with \nthe provider in Miami who is currently scheduled to begin laser hair removal on April 26, \nsubject to the continued agreement and availability of the dermatologist. \n๏ท  Defendants will identify at least three electrolysis hair removal providers in the Miami area \nwho Defendants believe are qualified to perform permanent hair removal in preparation \nfor vaginoplasty, and who are acceptable to Plaintiff. \n๏ท  Defendants will schedule a consultation for a vaginoplasty with the Chicago-based surgeon \npreviously identified by Plaintiffโs counsel.   \n๏ท  Defendants will continue to attempt to gather certain information on other potential \nsurgeons. \n๏ท  Defendants will consult with the Office of Probation and Pretrial Services, as necessary, \nin order to effectuate any needed medical furlough(s) for Ms. Iglesias. \n๏ท  By May 6, 2022, Defendants will provide an outline of a timeline of all significant steps \nthat BOP and NaphCare must undertake to provide Plaintiff with gender-confirmation \nsurgery with enough time for her to recover before her release on December 25, 2022. \n๏ท  The obligations set forth in the partiesโ proposed modified preliminary injunction will \npause the obligations previously imposed by paragraphs 1 through 6 of the Courtโs April \n18 injunction, except that Defendants will file on April 28, 2022, the information that they \nhave already compiled with respect to paragraphs 2 and 4 of the injunction and will also \nfile the information required by paragraph 5 by May 6, 2022. \n๏ท  In light of the partiesโ mutual wish to pursue negotiations over a permanent injunction \nand/or other potential resolution of the case, the parties will jointly file a proposed \npermanent injunction and/or other status report within 21 days.   \n๏ท  To allow the parties to focus on these negotiations, Defendantsโ obligation to file status \nreports pursuant to the Courtโs February 22, 2022 order and paragraphs 7-8 of the Courtโs \nApril 18 order will be paused for the 21-day period, except that Defendants will provide \ntimely updates to Plaintiffโs counsel with information relevant to Plaintiffโs ongoing care. \n๏ท  To further allow the parties to focus on these negotiations, the hearing currently scheduled \nfor May 9 will be deferred, with a hearing to be rescheduled after the parties file their \nproposed permanent injunction and/or other status report in 21 days.  The deadline for \nDefendantsโ response to the Courtโs April 18 memorandum and order showing cause why \nDefendants and individual attorneys shall not be held in contempt and/or sanctioned will \nbe extended to May 26, 2022.  \n๏ท  Plaintiffโs counsel need not submit a fee petition to the Court on May 6, 2022, in light of \nthe partiesโ anticipation that they will address this issue in conjunction with the partiesโ \nnegotiations during the 21-day period, and in the ultimate proposed injunction and/or \nother status report filed at the conclusion of that period.   \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00415-NJR   Document 251   Filed 04/26/22   Page 4 of 5   Page ID #3364\nThe parties believe that such a proposed modified preliminary injunction provides the best \npath forward to ensuring that Ms. Iglesias receives gender-confirmation surgery as expeditiously as \npossible. \nCONCLUSION \n  For good cause shown, the parties respectfully request that the Court grant their joint motion \nto modify the April 18, 2022 preliminary injunction and that the Court enter the joint proposed \nmodified preliminary injunction attached as Exhibit A.  \n \nDated:  April 26, 2022 \n \n  Respectfully submitted, \n   \nSTEVEN D.

By May 6, 2022, Defendants shall provide an outline of a timeline of all significant \nsteps that BOP and NaphCare must undertake to provide Plaintiff with vaginoplasty \nwith  enough  time  for  her  to  recover  before  her  release  on  December  25,  2022. \nDefendants shall confer with Plaintiffโs counsel regarding the contents and structure \nof the outlined timeline.

Defendants shall further provide \na revised timeline within 10 days of the scheduling of vaginoplasty by the Chicago-\nbased surgeon, including the factors considered in subparagraphs 8(b) and 8(c) of the \nCourtโs April 18 preliminary injunction. \n \nPage 1 of 5 \n \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00415-NJR   Document 252   Filed 04/26/22   Page 2 of 5   Page ID #3372\n \n2. Defendants shall continue scheduling regular appointments for Plaintiff for laser hair \nremoval at the surgical site with the provider in Miami who is currently scheduled to \nbegin laser hair removal on April 26, 2022, subject to the continued agreement and \navailability of that dermatologist. These appointments shall continue as long as and at \na frequency necessary to obtain sufficient hair removal, in the judgment of the treating \nsurgeon, for a vaginoplasty procedure. Defendants shall also schedule appointments \nfor Plaintiff for laser facial hair removal with the same provider, to begin at the next \nsession after the April 26 appointment and continue thereafter. In the event such \nappointments cannot be scheduled, and/or Defendants believe further appointments \nare no longer necessary, Defendants shall meet and confer with Plaintiffโs counsel on \nthe issue before taking further action. \n \n3.

In the \nevent the surgeon requests an in-person consultation with Plaintiff, Defendants shall \nmake  arrangements  for  Plaintiff  to  travel  to  Chicago  pursuant  to  the  โmedical \nfurloughโ procedure to attend the in-person consultation, with costs included as part \nof BOPโs provision of medical care. In making such arrangements, Defendants will \nschedule the earliest in-person consultation available while taking into account the \ntime necessary to make travel arrangements. In the event the surgeon is unable or \nunwilling  to  schedule  any  consultation,  Defendants  shall  meet  and  confer  with \nPlaintiffโs counsel on the issue. \n \n5. With respect to the other 38 surgeons listed in Attachment 1 to the April 22, 2022 \nEpplin Declaration (Doc. 249-2), to the extent the contacted surgeons respond to \nDefendantsโ good-faith outreach, Defendants shall attempt to gather the information \ndescribed in paragraph 2 of the prior preliminary injunction (Doc. 239 ยถ 2). This \ninformation includes but is not limited to: what the surgeon requires for pre-surgery \nhair removal (e.g., coverage area, method of removal); who the surgeon recommends \nfor  hair  removal;  any  additional  steps  or  processes  the  surgeon  requires  before \nscheduling  or  performing  vaginoplasty  surgery;  whether  the  surgeon  has  any \nobjection to working with BOP to provide surgery to persons in BOP custody; whether \nthe surgeon is willing to accept Plaintiff as a patient for vaginoplasty; and whether the \nsurgeonโs schedule would allow for Plaintiff to undergo a vaginoplasty and recover \nby December 25, 2022. Defendants will also attempt to gather the same information \n \nPage 2 of 5 \n \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00415-NJR   Document 252   Filed 04/26/22   Page 3 of 5   Page ID #3373\nfrom additional surgeons to be specified in writing by Plaintiff.  \n \na. Defendants shall provide this information to the Court and Plaintiff, in a \nmanner substantially similar to Attachment 1 to Doc. 249-2, by May 12, \n2022.  In  the  event  that  the  Chicago-based  surgeon  discussed  in \nparagraph 4 above declines to accept Plaintiff as a patient or ceases to be \na  viable  option  for  providing  Plaintiffโs  surgery  for  any  reason, \nDefendants  will  send  an  up-to-date  version  of  this  information  to \nPlaintiffโs counsel within 48 hours of such development. \n \nb. If Defendantsโ outreach to surgeons as described in paragraph 5 above \ndoes not identify at least four surgeons able to perform vaginoplasties, \nwilling to work with BOP to provide surgery to persons in BOP custody, \nand willing to accept Plaintiff as a vaginoplasty patient such that Plaintiff \ncan receive surgery and recover by December 25, 2022, by May 19, 2022, \nDefendants shall notify Plaintiff and extend their outreach to additional \nsurgeons until four surgeons are identified who meet the criteria in this \nsubparagraph or until they have made a good faith effort to contact all \nsurgeons in the United States who are qualified to perform vaginoplasty. \n \n6. Defendants shall file the information required by paragraph 5 of the Courtโs prior \nApril 18, 2022 preliminary injunction by May 6, 2022. \n \n7. In light of BOPโs determination that, while Ms. Iglesias remains in BOP custody in a \nResidential Reentry Center, she can be moved temporarily for medical treatment \npursuant to the โmedical furloughโ procedure without further action required by the \nOffice of Probation and Pretrial Services, Defendants shall consult with Probation and \nPretrial Services, as necessary, in order to effectuate any medical furlough(s) for Ms. \nIglesias. \n \n8. As noted below, the obligations herein will pause the obligations previously imposed \nby paragraphs 1 through 6 of the Courtโs prior preliminary injunction (Doc. 239). \nHowever, Defendants shall file on April 28, 2022, the information that they have \nalready compiled with respect to paragraphs 2 and 4 of the Courtโs prior preliminary \ninjunction. \n \n9. To the extent the parties are unable to resolve any issues for which this Order directs \nthe parties to meet and confer, the parties shall promptly submit a joint filing to the \nCourt updating the Court and discussing their respective positions on the issue(s). \n \nMoreover,  in  light  of  the  representations  in  the  joint  motion  to  modify  the \n \nPage 3 of 5 \n \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00415-NJR   Document 252   Filed 04/26/22   Page 4 of 5   Page ID #3374\npreliminary injunction, namely that the parties mutually wish to pursue negotiations \nover a permanent injunction and/or other potential resolution of this case, the Court \nhereby ORDERS: \n10. Over the next 21 days, the parties shall confer regularly โ at least twice weekly โ \nregarding a permanent injunction to be proposed by the parties and/or potential \nsettlement or other resolution of this matter. \n \n11. The parties shall jointly file a proposed permanent injunction and/or other status \nreport within 21 days, i.e., on or before May 17, 2022. \n \n12. To allow the parties to focus on these negotiations, Defendantsโ obligation to file \nstatus  reports  pursuant  to  the  Courtโs  February  22,  2022  Order,  Doc.  200,  and \nparagraphs 7-8 of the Courtโs April 18, 2022 Order, Doc. 239, is excused until the end \nof the 21-day period. However, Defendants shall provide timely updates to Plaintiffโs \ncounsel  with  information  relevant  to  Plaintiffโs  ongoing  care.  The  proposed \npermanent injunction and/or status report filed at the conclusion of the 21-day period \nshall report Defendantsโ progress on paragraphs 1-5 above, and shall also address a \nschedule for future status reports. Nothing in this paragraph prohibits either party \nfrom  voluntarily  providing  information  to  the  Court  during  the  21-day  period, \nprovided they give the other party at least 24 hours advance notice. \n \n13. To further allow the parties to focus on these negotiations, the hearing currently \nscheduled for May 9 is deferred, with a hearing to be rescheduled after the parties file \ntheir proposed permanent injunction and/or other status report in 21 days. Moreover, \nalthough Defendants shall file certain injunction-related information on April 28, \n2022, and May 6, 2022, as specified in paragraphs 1, 6, and 8 above, the other portions \nof Defendantsโ response to the Courtโs Memorandum and Order of April 18, 2022 \n(Doc. 238) โ i.e., showing cause why Defendants and individual attorneys shall not be \nheld in contempt and/or sanctioned โ shall not be due on April 28, 2022, and shall \ninstead be due four weeks later on May 26, 2022. \n \n14. Plaintiffโs counsel need not submit a fee petition to the Court on May 6, 2022, in light \nof the partiesโ anticipation that they will address this issue in conjunction with the \npartiesโ  negotiations  during  the  21-day  period,  and  in  the  ultimate  proposed \ninjunction and/or other status report filed at the conclusion of that period. In the \nevent the parties are unable to reach agreement, Plaintiffโs counsel retain all rights to \nsubmit a fee petition at a later date. \n \nThis Order supersedes the prior April 18, 2022 preliminary injunction (Doc. 239). \n \nPage 4 of 5 \n \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00415-NJR   Document 252   Filed 04/26/22   Page 5 of 5   Page ID #3375\nHowever, should the parties fail to reach an agreement on the proposed permanent \ninjunction and/or other resolution of this case, the requirements of the April 18, 2022 \npreliminary injunction shall resume effect, with all deadlines postponed by four weeks \nunless otherwise ordered by the Court. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n \n  DATED:  April 26, 2022 \n \n \n              s/ Nancy J.

Doc. 269.   \nFacial Feminization and Breast Augmentation \n  Defendants previously reported that BOP was advised that the surgeon identified as Surgeon \n1 in the Stipulated Order generally performs facial feminization surgery in two stages, with breast \naugmentation occurring during one of those stages.  Doc. 256-1 at 3.  BOP was further advised the \ntwo surgeries would be spaced apart by approximately one month, and after the second surgery, Ms. \nIglesias will want to wait about four weeks before having another surgery (such as vaginoplasty).  Id.   \n  On June 16, 2022, Ms. Iglesias had a follow-up telehealth appointment with Surgeon 1 to \nreview CT results and set a plan for surgery.  July 8, 2022 Decl. of Gregg Fearday ยถ 4.  Defendants \nreport that Ms. Iglesias is currently scheduled for the first (of two) facial feminization surgeries with \nSurgeon 1 on August 23, 2022.  Id.

According to the medical records, the general surgeon advised Ms. Iglesias can \nbe  scheduled  for  a  โlaparoscopic  cholecystectomy,  possible  open,  possible  intraoperative \ncholangiogramโ whenever she can return to the hospital.  Id. ยถ 6.  Defendants report that after \nreceiving those medical records on July 6, BOP asked its contractor to arrange for surgery as soon as \npossible.  Id.  On July 7, BOPโs contractor advised that a cholecystectomy is scheduled for July 14.  Id.  \nBOP intends to keep Surgeon 1 apprised of the status of Ms. Iglesiasโs gallbladder-related procedures, \nso that Surgeon 1 can make a clinical determination on the appropriateness of moving forward with \nfacial feminization on the currently scheduled surgery date of August 23.

Id.  Defendants report that BOPโs contractor advised \nthat they sent a contract to Surgeon 2โs office on June 28 and plan to follow up with that office on \nJuly 8. \nHair Removal \n  Ms. Iglesias has a third dermatology appointment for laser hair removal scheduled for July 11, \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00415-NJR   Document 281   Filed 07/08/22   Page 3 of 4   Page ID #3947\n2022.

These  appointments  shall  continue  as  long  as  and  at  a \nfrequency necessary to obtain sufficient hair removal, in the judgment of \nthe treating surgeon, for a vaginoplasty procedure.

In the event \nthe dermatologist believes further appointments are no longer necessary for \nfacial  hair  removal,  Defendants  shall  meet  and  confer  with  Plaintiffโs \ncounsel  on  the  issue  before  taking  further  action.  In  no  event  shall \nDefendants be required to schedule laser hair removal appointments after \nPlaintiffโs release from custody of the Bureau of Prisons (โBOPโ). \n2.  Electrolysis. If the treating surgeon identified in paragraph 4 or 5 below \nadvises BOP that electrolysis is medically necessary to supplement the laser \nhair  removal,  Defendants  shall  schedule  electrolysis  appointments  as \nrecommended  by  the  treating  surgeon,  subject  to  the  availability  of  a \nprovider to provide electrolysis. These appointments shall continue as long \nas and at a frequency necessary to obtain sufficient hair removal, in the \njudgment of the treating surgeon, for a vaginoplasty procedure. In no event \nshall Defendants be required to schedule electrolysis appointments after \nPlaintiffโs release from BOP custody.  \n3.  Facial feminization and breast augmentation.1 Defendants shall schedule \nappointments as soon as practicable2 for facial feminization surgeries and \nbreast augmentation with Surgeon 1.3 Defendants shall advise the surgeon \nperforming the vaginoplasty, once one is retained, see infra para. 4-5, of any \nexisting appointments for facial feminization and breast augmentation. \n4.  VaginoplastyโSurgeon 2. If Surgeon 2 is willing and able to perform a \nvaginoplasty  on  Plaintiff,  Defendants  shall  schedule  an  in-person \nconsultation for vaginoplasty and a surgery appointment for vaginoplasty \nas soon as practicable that will allow sufficient time for Plaintiff to undergo \nthe  necessary  hair-removal  treatments  and  recover  from  the  facial \nfeminization and breast augmentation surgeries before the vaginoplasty \nsurgery. The target timeline is for vaginoplasty to occur in October 2022 and \n \n1 โFacial feminization and breast augmentationโ refer to the procedures referenced on page 5 of \nthe medical record provided by Surgeon 1, see ECF No. 249-1. \n2 The term โas soon as practicableโ in this order means as soon as reasonably possible and in \naccordance with the timeline in ECF No. 256-1, to the greatest extent possible, taking into account \nthe providerโs schedule and recommendations and time for BOP to make arrangements for \npayment and other logistics.  \n3 Surgeon names are identified in the Courtโs Sealed Supplement to Stipulated Order, filed \nseparately under seal. \n \nPage 2 of 6 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00415-NJR   Document 269   Filed 05/31/22   Page 3 of 6   Page ID #3581\nno later than November 15, 2022, as laid out in ECF No. 256-1. If the \nappointment does not take place until after Plaintiffโs release date, the \nprovisions of paragraph 8 below regarding payment shall apply.  \n5.  VaginoplastyโOther surgeons. In the event that Surgeon 2 is unwilling or \nunable to perform vaginoplasty, Defendants shall attempt to schedule a \nconsultation for a vaginoplasty appointment with either:  (a) the surgeon(s), \nif any, serving as a backup for Surgeon 2, or (b) one of the following \nsurgeons:  (i) Surgeon 3, (ii) Surgeon 4, (iii) Surgeon 5, (iv) Surgeon 6, \n(v) Surgeon 7, (vi) Surgeon 8, or (vii) a surgeon recommended by Surgeon 2. \nDefendants represent that Surgeons 3, 4, 5, and 6 have indicated that they \nperform vaginoplasties, are willing to work with BOP, and currently have \nopenings  on  their  schedules  that  would  likely  allow  for  Plaintiffโs \nvaginoplasty to be performed prior to her scheduled release date from BOP \ncustody.  After  selection  of  the  surgeon,  Defendants  shall  schedule  an \nappointment  as  soon  as  practicable  for  vaginoplasty  that  will  provide \nsufficient time for Plaintiff to undergo necessary hair removal treatments \nand  recover  from  her  facial  feminization  and  breast  augmentation \nsurgeries. \n6.  Medical contraindications. If one of the designated surgeons providing \ncare to Plaintiff advises that there are contraindications such that, consistent \nwith the WPATH Standards of Care, there are no reasonable circumstances \nfor undertaking the respective surgery described in this order, a second \nopinion shall be sought from a surgeon listed above in paragraph 5. If the \nsecond surgeon also advises that there are contraindications such that there \nare no reasonable circumstances for undertaking the respective surgery, \nBOP  shall  be  relieved  of  any  obligation  to  provide  or  pay  for  such \nprocedure. If a surgeon providing care to Plaintiff advises that there are \nmedical  contraindications  such  that  Plaintiff  is  at  higher  risk  of \ncomplications  but  that  these  risks  may  be  outweighed  by  other \nconsiderations, BOP will proceed only if Plaintiff requests to proceed, the \nmedical  provider  agrees  to  do  so,  and  Plaintiff  provides  appropriate \ninformed  consent  and  waives  any  related  liability  against  Defendants. \nPlaintiff and Defendants agree that they are not currently aware of any \ncontraindications that would make it the case that there are no reasonable \ncircumstances for undertaking any of the surgeries identified in paragraphs \n3, 4, and 5. \n7.  Payment for surgeries and associated costs. BOP shall pay for the cost of \n(i) the surgeries identified in paragraphs 3, 4, 5; (ii) associated pre- and post-\n \nPage 3 of 6 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00415-NJR   Document 269   Filed 05/31/22   Page 4 of 6   Page ID #3582\nsurgical care and recovery;4 and (iii) any related medical care needed as a \nresult of surgery (including treatment for post-surgical complications or \nmedically necessary revisions of those surgeries), assuming such surgeries \nor care occur while Plaintiff is in BOP custody, i.e., before Plaintiffโs release \ndate, currently scheduled for December 25, 2022.5 Defendants also shall pay \nto an escrow account with a national banking institution or a trust account \nan amount agreed to by the Parties to cover any medical care and expenses \nthat may arise as a result of complications or necessary revisions to the \nsurgeries identified in paragraphs 3, 4, 5, and any resulting income taxes, \nas further set forth in more detail in Paragraph 1.c of the Partiesโ settlement \nagreement.  \nIf  Plaintiff  requires  transfer  to  another  geographic  location  for  these \nsurgeries (or preparation for or recovery from these surgeries) while still in \nBOP custody, BOP shall provide for transportation, lodging, food, and \nappropriate pre- and post-surgical care as needed for Plaintiff during the \nperiod  of  relocation,  which  shall  include  whatever  period  of  time  the \ntreating surgeon recommends for recovery, so long as it is completed prior \nto  Plaintiffโs  release  from  BOP  custody.  As  part  of  recovery  from \nvaginoplasty surgery, BOP will provide Plaintiff with a safe and sanitary \nlocation for post-surgical dilation for as long as she remains in BOP custody. \n8.  Payment in the event that surgery, revisions, and/or recoveries cannot be \ncompleted  prior  to  Plaintiffโs  release  date.  If  any  of  (i)  the  surgeries \nidentified in paragraphs 3, 4, or 5; (ii) associated pre- and post-surgical care \nand recovery; or (iii) any related medical care needed as a result of surgery \n(including treatment for post-surgical complications or medically necessary \nrevisions of those surgeries), cannot be completed by Plaintiffโs release from \nBOP  custody,  which  is  currently  projected  to  be  December  25,  2022, \nDefendants  shall  pay  to  an  escrow  account  with  a  national  banking \ninstitution or a trust account an amount the Parties agree will cover the \ncosts, as further set forth in more detail in Paragraphs 1.b and 1.c of the \nPartiesโ  settlement  agreement,  of:    any  outstanding  surgeries,  any \nassociated  pre-  and  post-surgical  care  and  recovery,  and  any  related \nmedical care needed as a result of surgery; any necessary transportation, \n \n4 Foreseeable costs include, but are not limited to, pre- and post-surgery medical supplies (e.g. \ndilators and bowel preparation materials); a stay in a local skilled nursing facility after post-\nsurgery hospital discharge, of a duration to be determined by the treating surgeon; and any other \nappropriate  post-surgical  care  reasonably  required  to  assist  with  recovery  and  day-to-day \nactivities while Plaintiff is incapacitated after surgery, of a duration to be determined by the \ntreating surgeon. \n5 A non-exhaustive list of possible post-surgical complications or needs for revision, as considered \nin paragraphs 7 and 8 above, is included in the Partiesโ settlement agreement. \n \nPage 4 of 6 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00415-NJR   Document 269   Filed 05/31/22   Page 5 of 6   Page ID #3583\nlodging, food, medical supplies, and home healthcare and/or reasonably \nrequired personal assistance costs associated with the surgeries, pre- and \npost-surgery care and recovery, and related medical care; and any resulting \nincome taxes. These costs shall include costs generated by compliance with \nany constraints or requirements for transportation, lodging, food, medical \nsupplies, and home healthcare and/or personal assistance that the treating \nsurgeon recommends.  \nShould the Parties be unable to reach an agreement on the amount, they \nshall promptly submit a joint filing to the Court discussing their respective \npositions  on  the  issue,  and  the  Court  shall  determine  the  appropriate \namount. Payment of the agreed-to or Court-ordered amount pursuant to \nthe settlement agreement shall constitute Defendantsโ fulfillment of its \nobligations  with  respect  to  these  procedures.  As  set  forth  above  in \nparagraph 6, Defendants shall be under no obligation to pay for a procedure \nfor which the agreed-upon surgeon designated to provide the procedure \ndetermines  that  there  are  contraindications  such  that  there  are  no \nreasonable circumstances for undertaking the procedure. \n9.  Reporting requirement. The Parties shall file a joint status report updating \nthe Court on significant developments related to the surgeries described \nabove on Friday, June 10, 2022, and every four weeks thereafter, until the \nParties believe that such joint status reports are no longer necessary, but in \nno case extending past Plaintiffโs release from BOP custody. When the \nParties  have  determined  that  such  joint  status  reports  are  no  longer \nnecessary, they may jointly move to modify this Order to be relieved of this \nreporting obligation (to the extent this case is not otherwise dismissed at \nthat point). \n10. Special Master. Former U.S. District Judge G. Patrick Murphy will be \nappointed as Special Master for the purpose of administering the escrow or \ntrust account referenced in paragraphs 7 and 8 above. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 53. \nThe Parties shall confer with former Judge Murphy no later than June 21, \n2022, to discuss the terms of his appointment as Special Master and to \nprepare a proposed order reflecting the agreed-upon terms for the Courtโs \nsignature. If the Parties cannot agree on such terms, they shall each submit \na proposed order and memorandum of law. Such proposed order or orders \nand memoranda shall be submitted to the Court no later than July 12, 2022.  \n11. Stay. This case is stayed in all respects through January 3, 2023, except that \nthe Parties shall file the proposed order(s) pursuant to paragraph 10 and \nshall continue to file the joint status reports pursuant to paragraph 9 and \nmay  seek  the  Courtโs  involvement  in  determining  a  payment  amount \n \nPage 5 of 6 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00415-NJR   Document 269   Filed 05/31/22   Page 6 of 6   Page ID #3584\npursuant to paragraph 8 without moving to lift the stay.

CRISTIAN NOEL IGLESIAS),   \n    \n      Plaintiff,   \n  Case No. 19-cv-00415-NJR \nv.   \n   \nIAN CONNORS, et al., \n \n      Defendants. \n \n \nJOINT STATUS REPORT \n \n  The parties respectfully submit this Joint Status Report pursuant to paragraph 9 of the Courtโs \nMay 31, 2022, Stipulated Order providing that the parties shall update the Court on significant \ndevelopments related to the surgeries described in the Stipulated Order.  Doc. 269.   \nFacial Feminization and Breast Augmentation \n  Defendants previously reported that BOP was advised that the surgeon identified as Surgeon \n1 in the Stipulated Order generally performs facial feminization surgery in two stages, with breast \naugmentation occurring during one of those stages.  Doc. 256-1 at 3.  BOP was further advised the \ntwo surgeries would be spaced apart by approximately one month, and after the second surgery, Ms. \nIglesias will want to wait about four weeks before having another surgery (such as vaginoplasty).  Id.   \n  Defendants  report  that  Ms.  Iglesias  is  currently  scheduled  for  the  first  (of  two)  facial \nfeminization surgeries with Surgeon 1 on August 23, 2022.  See August 5, 2022 Decl. of Gregg Fearday \nยถ 4.  Ms. Iglesias has a pre-operative appointment with Surgeon 1, currently scheduled for August 10, \n2022, in part to determine if it is appropriate to proceed with the first facial feminization surgery, in \nlight of Ms. Iglesiasโs recent gallbladder issues (discussed below) and previously anticipated gall bladder \nsurgery (since postponed).  Id.  The second facial feminization surgery, which will also include breast \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00415-NJR   Document 288   Filed 08/05/22   Page 2 of 5   Page ID #3967\naugmentation, is currently pending scheduling by Surgeon 1.  Id. \nAs previously reported, Ms. Iglesias went to the emergency room on June 21, 2022 for an issue \nrelated to her gallbladder, and she had a follow-up appointment with a general surgeon regarding her \ngallbladder on June 28.  Id. ยถ 7.  After Ms. Iglesiasโs June 28, 2022 follow-up appointment with the \ngeneral surgeon, the general surgeon advised that Ms. Iglesias could be scheduled for a โlaparoscopic \ncholecystectomy, possible open, possible intraoperative cholangiogramโ whenever she could return \nto the hospital.  Id.  \nBOPโs contractor scheduled Ms. Iglesias to receive gallbladder surgery on July 14, 2022.  Id. \nยถ 8.  Upon her arrival at the hospital for surgery, however, Ms. Iglesias tested positive for COVID-19.  \nId.  The gallbladder surgery was accordingly rescheduled for July 28, 2022. Id.   \nUnfortunately, when Ms. Iglesias arrived at the hospital on July 28, she was told by the hospital \nthat they did not have a record of the appointment.  Id.  BOPโs contractor called the hospital to try \nand resolve the issue, but the contractor was unable to add Ms. Iglesias to the calendar for that day \nbecause another patient had arrived at the hospital who required emergency care.  Id.  According to \nBOPโs contractor, the hospital should have confirmed Ms. Iglesiasโs appointment after the contractor \nhad scheduled the surgery with the hospital over the phone.  Id.  According to BOPโs contractor, \nhowever, the hospital did not schedule the appointment, apparently because they were expecting to \nreceive written confirmation from the contractor but did not do so.  Id.  According to BOPโs \ncontractor, one of the contractorโs case managers thought that a scheduler had sent the written \nconfirmation, but the scheduler thought that the case manager had sent the confirmation.  Id.  BOP \nwill work to ensure, to the extent possible, that, going forward, any needed written confirmations are \nprovided.  Id.  \nOn July 28, BOPโs contractor scheduled a consultation related to the gallbladder issue for \nAugust 2, 2022.  Id. ยถ 9.  BOPโs contractor scheduled a consultation (as opposed to rescheduling the \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00415-NJR   Document 288   Filed 08/05/22   Page 3 of 5   Page ID #3968\nsurgery itself) at the surgeonโs request because it had been more than 30 days since the general surgeon \nhad seen Ms. Iglesias.  Id.  Ms. Iglesias then returned to the hospital on August 3, 2022, for a series of \npre-operative tests (CBC, Liver function test, Lipase, type and screen, covid test and urinalysis).  Id. \nUnfortunately, on August 3, 2022, Ms. Iglesias again tested positive for COVID-19.  Id.  \nThe hospital advised BOPโs contractor that Ms. Iglesias could take another COVID-19 test \nand that gallbladder surgery could take place on August 5 if the test returned negative results.  Id. ยถ 10.  \nMs. Iglesias returned to the hospital on August 4 for the COVID-19 test and tested negative.  The \ngallbladder surgery was then scheduled for August 5 at 4:30 pm ET.  Id.  Ms. Iglesias returned to the \nhospital for the surgery on August 5 and, according to the hospital, was cleared medically for the \nsurgery.  Id.  The anesthesiologist, however, determined that the surgery should not proceed because \nit was not in the best interest of Ms. Iglesias given the risks associated with the fact that she had only \nrecently tested negative for COVID-19.  Id.  Ms. Iglesias tested negative for COVID-19 only yesterday, \nand the American Society of Anesthesiologists recommends waiting at least four weeks from a \nnegative COVID-19 test before proceeding with elective surgeries.  Id.  The anesthesiologist had not \npreviously shared these concerns with BOP or BOPโs contractor.  Id.  Accordingly, given the \nanesthesiologistโs concerns, the gallbladder surgery will need to be rescheduled for a date at least four \nweeks from now.  Id. \nVaginoplasty \nDefendants previously reported that BOP was advised that the office of the Chicago-based \nsurgeon identified as Surgeon 2 in the Stipulated Order needs to work on contracts and some other \nlogistical issues before they can arrange to see Ms. Iglesias for an inโperson consult.  June 10 Decl. of \nGregg Fearday ยถ 6.  BOP, through its contractor, has been following up with Surgeon 2โs office to see \nif Surgeon 2 will move forward with Ms. Iglesias as a patient.  Aug. 5, 2022 Fearday Decl. ยถ 5.  BOPโs \ncontractor sent a contract to Surgeon 2โs office on June 28.  Id.  On July 12, 2022, BOP was advised \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00415-NJR   Document 288   Filed 08/05/22   Page 4 of 5   Page ID #3969\nthat Surgeon 2โs office sent edits to the contract back to BOPโs contractor.  Id.  On July 18, 2022, \nSurgeon 2โs office asked if there was any feedback on the comments.  Id.  BOPโs contractor told \nSurgeon 2โs office that the comments were fine, except that BOPโs contractor requested that medical \nrecords be provided to BOP or its contractor as soon as they are completed.  Id.  On July 30, 2022, \nBOPโs contractor advised BOP that Surgeon 2โs office had an updated copy of the agreement.  Id. \nBOPโs contractor is waiting to hear from Surgeon 2โs office whether they will accept Ms. Iglesias as a \npatient and schedule the in-person consult.  Id.  \nHair Removal \n  Ms. Iglesias had a third dermatology appointment for laser hair removal, on July 11, 2022.  Id. \nยถ 6.  Ms. Iglesias has a fourth dermatology appointment for laser hair removal scheduled for August \n11, 2022.

No. 266 the Court has legal authority to enter an order requiring BOP to \nretain the Chicago-based surgeon. \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00415-NJR   Document 267   Filed 05/27/22   Page 2 of 4   Page ID #3561\n \nrelease from BOP custody, BOP will deposit funds into an escrow account or trust account \nto cover the costs of such care, with any remaining funds not used reverting to BOP. \n๏ท  BOP will also deposit into an escrow account or trust account an amount to cover any \nunexpected medical or associated out-of-pocket costs associated with the surgeries, with \nany remaining funds not used reverting to BOP.  \n๏ท  BOP will pay Plaintiffโs counsel $938,552 for reasonable attorneysโ fees and costs incurred \nin this matter.  \n๏ท  The parties will file joint status reports updating the Court on significant developments \nrelated to the above surgeries on June 10, 2022 and every four weeks thereafter. \n๏ท  This case will be stayed through January 3, 2023, except that the parties will continue to \nfile joint status reports as described above and may seek the Courtโs involvement in \n2\ndetermining an appropriate payment amount if the parties cannot agree on an amount.   \n๏ท  Within fourteen days after BOP makes the required payment(s), Plaintiff will file a \nstipulation of dismissal with prejudice. \nThe proposed stipulated order further provides that former District Judge G. Patrick Murphy \nwill be appointed as Special Master for the purpose of administering the escrow or trust account \nreferenced above.  The parties, through the U.S. Attorneysโ Office, have contacted Judge Murphy, \nwho expressed his willingness to serve as a Special Master to administer the escrow or trust account.  \nThe settlement agreement provides that the Special Masterโs authority will be limited to determining \nwhether payments requested to be made from the escrow or trust account are appropriate under the \nsettlement agreement. \nThe parties believe that entry of the proposed stipulated order will ensure that Ms. Iglesias \nreceives gender-confirmation surgery as expeditiously as possible and will, ultimately, resolve this \nlitigation.  Accordingly, the parties respectfully request that the Court grant their joint motion and \nenter the proposed stipulated order attached as Exhibit 1.  The parties also respectfully request prompt \nentry of the proposed stipulated order, in the form attached as Exhibit 1, because the settlement may \n                                                 \n2 Defendants also will file their response to the Courtโs Memorandum and Order of April 18, 2022 \n(Doc. 238), showing cause why Defendants and individual attorneys should not be held in contempt \nand/or sanctioned, on June 9, 2022, in accordance with the Courtโs modified Preliminary Injunction \n(Doc. 265) ยถ 2. \n \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00415-NJR   Document 267   Filed 05/27/22   Page 3 of 4   Page ID #3562\n \notherwise become void and because prompt entry of the order will ensure that Ms. Iglesiasโs ongoing \ntreatment continues uninterrupted.

Doc. 269.   \nAs reported previously, Ms. Iglesias was scheduled for the first of two facial feminization \nsurgeries on August 23, 2022.  Ms. Iglesias attended a preoperative appointment with the surgeon on \nAugust 10, 2022, and the surgeon cleared Ms. Iglesias to proceed with the surgery. \nOn August 19, 2022, however, Ms. Iglesias left without authorization the Residential Reentry \nCenter (RRC) where she was being housed and did not return.  See Fearday Decl. ยถ 5.  On August 21, \nMs. Iglesias was arrested by local authorities for grand theft auto in the third degree.  Id.  Ms. Iglesias \nhas since remained in the custody of local authorities.  Id.  Accordingly, BOP has postponed the \nAugust 23 surgery for the time being given that Ms. Iglesias is not currently in federal custody.  Id. \nMs. Iglesias is currently being held at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center in \nMiami, Florida (under her birth name of Kenneth West).  Id. ยถ 6.  The United States Marshals Service \nhas been notified, and the Marshals Service has lodged a detainer so that Ms. Iglesias will be transferred \nback to federal custody when she is released by local authorities.  Id.  It is unclear at this time, however, \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00415-NJR   Document 293   Filed 09/02/22   Page 2 of 4   Page ID #3980\nwhen Ms. Iglesias will be released by local authorities.  Id.  The public docket indicates that an \narraignment hearing has been set for September 12, 2022.  Id. \nBecause Ms. Iglesias remains in the custody of local authorities and it is unclear when she will \nbe released, there is currently uncertainty as to when the previously scheduled surgeries will be able to \nproceed.   BOP  nonetheless remains  committed to  satisfying  its  obligations under  the  partiesโ \nsettlement agreement and the Courtโs stipulated order.  BOP notes that, because Ms. Iglesias has not \nbeen in federal custody since August 20, 2022, her release date from federal custody (which was \npreviously scheduled for December 25, 2022) will likely be extended.  Id. ยถ 7. \nBefore Ms. Iglesias was arrested by local authorities, BOP had scheduled her second facial \nfeminization surgery for October 7, 2022.  Id. ยถ  8.  After Ms. Iglesias left BOP custody, BOP advised \nits contractor that it should keep that date on the calendar so that, if Ms. Iglesias has been returned to \nBOP custody by that date, the first facial feminization surgery could proceed.  Id.  \nAdditionally, as reported previously, BOP, through its contractor, has been following up with \na second surgeon to perform the vaginoplasty surgery.  Id. ยถ 9.  BOPโs contractor has continued to \nfollow up with that surgeonโs office and is waiting to hear whether they will accept Ms. Iglesias as a \npatient.  Id. \nBOP also reports that Ms. Iglesias had a fourth dermatology appointment for laser hair \nremoval, on August 11, 2022.  Id. ยถ 10.  BOP had scheduled the next appointment for September 12, \n2022, but canceled that appointment because Ms. Iglesias is not currently in BOP custody and it is \nunclear when she will return to BOP custody.  Id.  Once Ms. Iglesias is returned to BOP custody, BOP \nintends to reschedule a dermatology appointment.  Id. \nFinally,  BOP  previously  reported  that  BOPโs  contractor  scheduled  Ms.  Iglesias  for  a \nconsultation related to her gallbladder for August 16, 2022.  Id. ยถ 11.  Ms. Iglesias did not attend that \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00415-NJR   Document 293   Filed 09/02/22   Page 3 of 4   Page ID #3981\nappointment as there was an issue at the RRC and Ms. Iglesias was not provided with a pass for the \nappointment.  Id.   \nCounsel for the parties have been in active discussions about the developments described \nabove and intend to continue to work together cooperatively to address them.  As noted, while there \nis currently uncertainty as to when the previously scheduled surgeries will be able to proceed, the \nparties remain committed to implementing the settlement agreement and the Courtโs stipulated order.   \n \nDated:  September 2, 2022  Respectfully submitted, \n \nRACHELLE AUD CROWE   BRIAN M.

Laser  hair  removal.  Defendants  shall  continue  scheduling  regular \nappointments for Plaintiff for laser hair removal at the surgical site with the \nprovider in Miami who began laser hair removal on April 26, 2022, subject \nto  the  continued  agreement,  availability,  and  judgment  of  that \ndermatologist.  These  appointments  shall  continue  as  long  as  and  at  a \nfrequency necessary to obtain sufficient hair removal, in the judgment of \nthe treating surgeon, for a vaginoplasty procedure. If the provider in Miami \nwho  began  laser  hair  removal  on  April  26,  2022,  becomes  unable  or \nunwilling  to  continue  to  provide  laser  hair  removal  at  the  frequency \nnecessary to obtain sufficient hair removal in the judgment of the treating \nsurgeon, Defendants shall schedule appointments with another provider \nwho is qualified to perform laser hair removal or electrolysis in preparation \nfor vaginoplasty. Defendants also shall continue scheduling appointments \n \nPage 1 of 6 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00415-NJR   Document 269   Filed 05/31/22   Page 2 of 6   Page ID #3580\nfor Plaintiff for laser facial hair removal with the provider in Miami who \nbegan laser hair removal on April 26, 2022, subject to their continued \nagreement and availability, and such appointments shall continue so long \nas and at a frequency necessary in the judgment of the dermatologist. \nDefendants  shall  try  to  schedule  the  laser  hair  removal  appointments \nmonthly, consistent with the timeline laid out at ECF No. 256-1. In the event \nthe dermatologist believes further appointments are no longer necessary for \nfacial  hair  removal,  Defendants  shall  meet  and  confer  with  Plaintiffโs \ncounsel  on  the  issue  before  taking  further  action.  In  no  event  shall \nDefendants be required to schedule laser hair removal appointments after \nPlaintiffโs release from custody of the Bureau of Prisons (โBOPโ). \n2.  Electrolysis. If the treating surgeon identified in paragraph 4 or 5 below \nadvises BOP that electrolysis is medically necessary to supplement the laser \nhair  removal,  Defendants  shall  schedule  electrolysis  appointments  as \nrecommended  by  the  treating  surgeon,  subject  to  the  availability  of  a \nprovider to provide electrolysis. These appointments shall continue as long \nas and at a frequency necessary to obtain sufficient hair removal, in the \njudgment of the treating surgeon, for a vaginoplasty procedure. In no event \nshall Defendants be required to schedule electrolysis appointments after \nPlaintiffโs release from BOP custody.  \n3.  Facial feminization and breast augmentation.1 Defendants shall schedule \nappointments as soon as practicable2 for facial feminization surgeries and \nbreast augmentation with Surgeon 1.3 Defendants shall advise the surgeon \nperforming the vaginoplasty, once one is retained, see infra para. 4-5, of any \nexisting appointments for facial feminization and breast augmentation. \n4.  VaginoplastyโSurgeon 2. If Surgeon 2 is willing and able to perform a \nvaginoplasty  on  Plaintiff,  Defendants  shall  schedule  an  in-person \nconsultation for vaginoplasty and a surgery appointment for vaginoplasty \nas soon as practicable that will allow sufficient time for Plaintiff to undergo \nthe  necessary  hair-removal  treatments  and  recover  from  the  facial \nfeminization and breast augmentation surgeries before the vaginoplasty \nsurgery. The target timeline is for vaginoplasty to occur in October 2022 and \n \n1 โFacial feminization and breast augmentationโ refer to the procedures referenced on page 5 of \nthe medical record provided by Surgeon 1, see ECF No. 249-1. \n2 The term โas soon as practicableโ in this order means as soon as reasonably possible and in \naccordance with the timeline in ECF No. 256-1, to the greatest extent possible, taking into account \nthe providerโs schedule and recommendations and time for BOP to make arrangements for \npayment and other logistics.  \n3 Surgeon names are identified in the Courtโs Sealed Supplement to Stipulated Order, filed \nseparately under seal. \n \nPage 2 of 6 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00415-NJR   Document 269   Filed 05/31/22   Page 3 of 6   Page ID #3581\nno later than November 15, 2022, as laid out in ECF No. 256-1. If the \nappointment does not take place until after Plaintiffโs release date, the \nprovisions of paragraph 8 below regarding payment shall apply.  \n5.  VaginoplastyโOther surgeons. In the event that Surgeon 2 is unwilling or \nunable to perform vaginoplasty, Defendants shall attempt to schedule a \nconsultation for a vaginoplasty appointment with either:  (a) the surgeon(s), \nif any, serving as a backup for Surgeon 2, or (b) one of the following \nsurgeons:  (i) Surgeon 3, (ii) Surgeon 4, (iii) Surgeon 5, (iv) Surgeon 6, \n(v) Surgeon 7, (vi) Surgeon 8, or (vii) a surgeon recommended by Surgeon 2. \nDefendants represent that Surgeons 3, 4, 5, and 6 have indicated that they \nperform vaginoplasties, are willing to work with BOP, and currently have \nopenings  on  their  schedules  that  would  likely  allow  for  Plaintiffโs \nvaginoplasty to be performed prior to her scheduled release date from BOP \ncustody.  After  selection  of  the  surgeon,  Defendants  shall  schedule  an \nappointment  as  soon  as  practicable  for  vaginoplasty  that  will  provide \nsufficient time for Plaintiff to undergo necessary hair removal treatments \nand  recover  from  her  facial  feminization  and  breast  augmentation \nsurgeries. \n6.  Medical contraindications. If one of the designated surgeons providing \ncare to Plaintiff advises that there are contraindications such that, consistent \nwith the WPATH Standards of Care, there are no reasonable circumstances \nfor undertaking the respective surgery described in this order, a second \nopinion shall be sought from a surgeon listed above in paragraph 5. If the \nsecond surgeon also advises that there are contraindications such that there \nare no reasonable circumstances for undertaking the respective surgery, \nBOP  shall  be  relieved  of  any  obligation  to  provide  or  pay  for  such \nprocedure. If a surgeon providing care to Plaintiff advises that there are \nmedical  contraindications  such  that  Plaintiff  is  at  higher  risk  of \ncomplications  but  that  these  risks  may  be  outweighed  by  other \nconsiderations, BOP will proceed only if Plaintiff requests to proceed, the \nmedical  provider  agrees  to  do  so,  and  Plaintiff  provides  appropriate \ninformed  consent  and  waives  any  related  liability  against  Defendants. \nPlaintiff and Defendants agree that they are not currently aware of any \ncontraindications that would make it the case that there are no reasonable \ncircumstances for undertaking any of the surgeries identified in paragraphs \n3, 4, and 5. \n7.  Payment for surgeries and associated costs. BOP shall pay for the cost of \n(i) the surgeries identified in paragraphs 3, 4, 5; (ii) associated pre- and post-\n \nPage 3 of 6 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00415-NJR   Document 269   Filed 05/31/22   Page 4 of 6   Page ID #3582\nsurgical care and recovery;4 and (iii) any related medical care needed as a \nresult of surgery (including treatment for post-surgical complications or \nmedically necessary revisions of those surgeries), assuming such surgeries \nor care occur while Plaintiff is in BOP custody, i.e., before Plaintiffโs release \ndate, currently scheduled for December 25, 2022.5 Defendants also shall pay \nto an escrow account with a national banking institution or a trust account \nan amount agreed to by the Parties to cover any medical care and expenses \nthat may arise as a result of complications or necessary revisions to the \nsurgeries identified in paragraphs 3, 4, 5, and any resulting income taxes, \nas further set forth in more detail in Paragraph 1.c of the Partiesโ settlement \nagreement.  \nIf  Plaintiff  requires  transfer  to  another  geographic  location  for  these \nsurgeries (or preparation for or recovery from these surgeries) while still in \nBOP custody, BOP shall provide for transportation, lodging, food, and \nappropriate pre- and post-surgical care as needed for Plaintiff during the \nperiod  of  relocation,  which  shall  include  whatever  period  of  time  the \ntreating surgeon recommends for recovery, so long as it is completed prior \nto  Plaintiffโs  release  from  BOP  custody.  As  part  of  recovery  from \nvaginoplasty surgery, BOP will provide Plaintiff with a safe and sanitary \nlocation for post-surgical dilation for as long as she remains in BOP custody. \n8.  Payment in the event that surgery, revisions, and/or recoveries cannot be \ncompleted  prior  to  Plaintiffโs  release  date.  If  any  of  (i)  the  surgeries \nidentified in paragraphs 3, 4, or 5; (ii) associated pre- and post-surgical care \nand recovery; or (iii) any related medical care needed as a result of surgery \n(including treatment for post-surgical complications or medically necessary \nrevisions of those surgeries), cannot be completed by Plaintiffโs release from \nBOP  custody,  which  is  currently  projected  to  be  December  25,  2022, \nDefendants  shall  pay  to  an  escrow  account  with  a  national  banking \ninstitution or a trust account an amount the Parties agree will cover the \ncosts, as further set forth in more detail in Paragraphs 1.b and 1.c of the \nPartiesโ  settlement  agreement,  of:    any  outstanding  surgeries,  any \nassociated  pre-  and  post-surgical  care  and  recovery,  and  any  related \nmedical care needed as a result of surgery; any necessary transportation, \n \n4 Foreseeable costs include, but are not limited to, pre- and post-surgery medical supplies (e.g. \ndilators and bowel preparation materials); a stay in a local skilled nursing facility after post-\nsurgery hospital discharge, of a duration to be determined by the treating surgeon; and any other \nappropriate  post-surgical  care  reasonably  required  to  assist  with  recovery  and  day-to-day \nactivities while Plaintiff is incapacitated after surgery, of a duration to be determined by the \ntreating surgeon. \n5 A non-exhaustive list of possible post-surgical complications or needs for revision, as considered \nin paragraphs 7 and 8 above, is included in the Partiesโ settlement agreement. \n \nPage 4 of 6 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00415-NJR   Document 269   Filed 05/31/22   Page 5 of 6   Page ID #3583\nlodging, food, medical supplies, and home healthcare and/or reasonably \nrequired personal assistance costs associated with the surgeries, pre- and \npost-surgery care and recovery, and related medical care; and any resulting \nincome taxes. These costs shall include costs generated by compliance with \nany constraints or requirements for transportation, lodging, food, medical \nsupplies, and home healthcare and/or personal assistance that the treating \nsurgeon recommends.  \nShould the Parties be unable to reach an agreement on the amount, they \nshall promptly submit a joint filing to the Court discussing their respective \npositions  on  the  issue,  and  the  Court  shall  determine  the  appropriate \namount. Payment of the agreed-to or Court-ordered amount pursuant to \nthe settlement agreement shall constitute Defendantsโ fulfillment of its \nobligations  with  respect  to  these  procedures.  As  set  forth  above  in \nparagraph 6, Defendants shall be under no obligation to pay for a procedure \nfor which the agreed-upon surgeon designated to provide the procedure \ndetermines  that  there  are  contraindications  such  that  there  are  no \nreasonable circumstances for undertaking the procedure. \n9.  Reporting requirement. The Parties shall file a joint status report updating \nthe Court on significant developments related to the surgeries described \nabove on Friday, June 10, 2022, and every four weeks thereafter, until the \nParties believe that such joint status reports are no longer necessary, but in \nno case extending past Plaintiffโs release from BOP custody. When the \nParties  have  determined  that  such  joint  status  reports  are  no  longer \nnecessary, they may jointly move to modify this Order to be relieved of this \nreporting obligation (to the extent this case is not otherwise dismissed at \nthat point). \n10. Special Master. Former U.S. District Judge G. Patrick Murphy will be \nappointed as Special Master for the purpose of administering the escrow or \ntrust account referenced in paragraphs 7 and 8 above. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 53. \nThe Parties shall confer with former Judge Murphy no later than June 21, \n2022, to discuss the terms of his appointment as Special Master and to \nprepare a proposed order reflecting the agreed-upon terms for the Courtโs \nsignature. If the Parties cannot agree on such terms, they shall each submit \na proposed order and memorandum of law. Such proposed order or orders \nand memoranda shall be submitted to the Court no later than July 12, 2022.  \n11. Stay. This case is stayed in all respects through January 3, 2023, except that \nthe Parties shall file the proposed order(s) pursuant to paragraph 10 and \nshall continue to file the joint status reports pursuant to paragraph 9 and \nmay  seek  the  Courtโs  involvement  in  determining  a  payment  amount \n \nPage 5 of 6 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00415-NJR   Document 269   Filed 05/31/22   Page 6 of 6   Page ID #3584\npursuant to paragraph 8 without moving to lift the stay. The Parties shall \nwork together to ensure the timely provision of medical care in accordance \nwith paragraphs 1-5 and to address any issues that might arise.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nDATED:  May 31, 2022 \n____________________________ \nNANCY J.
