(Filing No. 1 .) On April 27, 2022, the Court granted A.C.'s Motion for Preliminary Injunction permitting him the right to use any boys' restroom within his middle school. (Filing No. 50 .) The School District now seeks to stay the Court's Order on that preliminary injunction pending its appeal to the Seventh Circuit. Defendants' Expedited Motion for Stay of Preliminary Injunction Pending Appeal, (Filing No. 53 ), is DENIED. (See Order). Signed by Judge Tanya Walton Pratt on 5/16/2022. (AKH) (Entered: 05/16/2022)"

Thereafter, on October 11, 2023, a Petition for a Writ of Certiorari was filed with the Supreme Court of the United States, and was placed on the Supreme Court docket October 13, 2023, as No. 23-392. However, a review of the docket in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals does not reflect that a request for stay of the mandate in this case has been made or granted. (See No. 22-1786). The Mandate therefore remains in effect, and this case remains active on this district court docket. In addition, the parties failed to comply with Local Rule 16-2, which required the parties shall file their position statement within 21 days following issuance of a Mandate. By no later than December 15, 2023, the parties are ordered to comply with Local Rule 16-2; or provide notice of compliance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 41(d)(2).

    "summary": "<p>A transgender middle school boy in Indiana filed this lawsuit on December 3, 2021, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. The student's school denied him access to the boy's restroom and soccer team. Several of the school's staff likewise refused to use his preferred pronouns. According to the complaint, the school's actions discriminated against the student in violation of Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause. Represented by the ACLU of Indiana and Indiana Legal Services, the student sought declaratory relief, an injunction compelling the school to remedy its discriminatory practices, and money damages. The case was assigned to Judge Tanya Walton Pratt and referred to Magistrate Judge Matthew Brookman. On December 30, Magistrate Judge Brookman granted the student's request to proceed through his mother as his next-friend.</p>\r\n<p>The student moved for a preliminary injunction on the same day he filed in federal court. The motion was limited to the subject of restrooms, though, since the soccer season was still months away. Arguing against a preliminary injunction, the school invoked the student's analogous state court case. After the state court denied the student's request to change the gender marker on his birth certificate, the school moved for judicial notice of that fact and collateral estoppel in the federal case on the same basis. According to the school, the state court ruling should weigh against the student's request for a preliminary injunction. Judge Pratt denied this motion in part on April 14, 2022. 2022 WL 1128697. The court agreed to take judicial of the state court holding. However, it refused the school's request for collateral estoppel because the subject of the state court's holding (a birth certificate change) was not before the district court. The student only sought to use the boy's bathroom in the present motion.</p>\r\n<p>Then, on April 29, 2022, the court granted the student's motion for a preliminary injunction. 2022 WL 1289352. The court explained that the student was likely to succeed on the merits in light of the Seventh Circuit's recent ruling in<em> Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Education</em>, 858 F.3d 1034 (7th Cir. 2017). In&nbsp;<em>Whitaker</em>, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that a school policy that subjects transgender students to different rules, sanctions, or treatment than non-transgender students violated Title IX. Also, the court agreed that the student would suffer irreparable harm without injunctive relief but found no competing harm for the school district. The district appealed this decision to the Seventh Circuit on May 3, 2022.</p>\r\n<p>On August 1, 2023, a three-judge panel consisting of Judges Easterbrook, Lee, and Wood issued an opinion affirming the district court's ruling. 75 F.4th 760. In her opinion, Judge Wood held firm to the <em>Whitaker</em> precedent relied on by the district court. Her opinion noted that \"[l]itigation over transgender rights is occurring all over the country, and we assume that at some point the Supreme Court will step in with more guidance than it has furnished so far. Until then, we will stay the course and follow Whitaker.\" The district filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court on October 13, 2023.</p>\r\n<p>On January 16, 2024, the Supreme Court rejected the district's cert petition. 2024 WL 156480.</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.</p>",

A.C. is a transgender boy who attends John R. Wooden Middle School, one of the \nschools within the Metropolitan School District of Martinsville. He was diagnosed with \ngender dysphoria and is receiving treatment aimed at alleviating the distress associated \nwith the incongruence between his male gender identity and his birth-assigned sex. He \nhas filed a court action, which is currently pending in state court, to have the gender \nmarker changed to male and his name formally changed on his birth certificate. He has \nrequested the ability to use the  boys’ restrooms at his school as well as asking to \nparticipate on the boys’ soccer team as he is male, despite his birth certificate reflecting \nthat his birth-assigned gender was female. Employees of the Metropolitan School District \n[1] \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-MPB   Document 1   Filed 12/03/21   Page 2 of 11 PageID #: 2\nof Martinsville (“School District”) have denied this request. He has also requested that he \nbe addressed in a manner that reflects that he is a boy by referring to him using male \npronouns. A number of staff persons refuse to do so, and the School District has not \nrequired it of the staff. Defendants’ failure to recognize plaintiff as male, to allow him to \nuse boys’ restrooms and facilities at the school, to require that he be addressed by the \npronouns consistent with his male gender, and to allow him to participate on the boys’ \nsoccer team, violates both Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § \n1681(a) and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution. He is entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as his \ndamages. \nJurisdiction, venue, and cause of action \n2.  This Court has jurisdiction of this case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \n3.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391. \n4.  Declaratory relief is authorized by Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \nand by 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201, 2202. \n5.  Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to redress the deprivation, \nunder color of state law, of right secured by the United States Constitution and as a \nprivate cause of action directly pursuant to Title IX as authorized by Cannon v. University \nof Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 717 (1979). \n \n[2] \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-MPB   Document 1   Filed 12/03/21   Page 3 of 11 PageID #: 3\nParties \n6.  A.C. is a minor child who resides in Martinsville, Indiana. He brings this action by \nhis mother as his next friend and legal guardian. \n7.  The Metropolitan School District of Martinsville is a public-school corporation \nproviding educational services in Martinsville, Indiana. \n8.  The Principal of the John R. Wooden Middle School is the duly appointed principal \nof the school and is sued in his official capacity. \nFactual allegations \n9.  A.C. is a 7th grader at the John R. Wooden Middle School, one of the schools within \nthe Metropolitan School District of Martinsville (“School District”). \n10.  Although the gender assigned to A.C. at birth was female, he has known himself \nto be a boy for several years. \n11.  When A.C. was in 5th grade he indicated to his family that he was not female and \nasked that he be addressed by a male first name and with male pronouns or “they.” \n12.  Since his time in elementary school, A.C. has been treated as male by his family. \n13.  In 5th grade he was in school in Anderson, and he wore male clothes and cut his \nhair in a masculine manner. \n14.  School personnel referred to him by his male first name and referred to him by \nmale pronouns. \n15.  When A.C. was in 5th grade he moved with his family to Martinsville where he \n[3] \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-MPB   Document 1   Filed 12/03/21   Page 4 of 11 PageID #: 4\nwas enrolled in one of the schools within the School District. \n16.  The staff at this school did not honor M.C.’s request that A.C. be referred to with \nmale pronounces, instead referring to him using female pronouns. \n17.  However, some students, in addition to referring to him by his male first name, \nalso referred to him using male pronouns. \n18.  By this point, A.C. was acutely uncomfortable using the girls’ restrooms as he \nknew he was not female and did not present as female. \n19.  He knows himself, and continues to know himself, as male.  \n20.  A.C. asked if he could use the boys’ restroom at the school and was told he had to \nuse either the girls’ restrooms or the single-person restroom in the school’s health clinic. \n21.  He used the restroom at the health clinic and continued to do so for the remainder \nof 5th and 6th grades. He did not use the girls’ restrooms. \n22.  Using the health clinic restroom was disquieting to him as it made him feel \ndifferent than the other students and increased the anxiety he was feeling between his \nsex assigned at birth and his gender.  \n23.  For the 2021-2022 school year, A.C. entered 7th grade in the John R. Wooden \nMiddle School, one of the schools in the School District that contains 7th and 8th grades. \n24.  He continues to be a student in the John R. Wooden Middle School. \n25.  He is male and therefore did not use the girls’ restrooms in the school. \n26.  He believed that the only option that he had was to use the single-person restroom \n[4] \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-MPB   Document 1   Filed 12/03/21   Page 5 of 11 PageID #: 5\nin the health clinic. \n27.  Therefore, at the beginning of the school year, he used the single-person restroom \nin the health clinic. \n28.  Using the health clinic restroom was problematic. \n29.  The health clinic in the school is far away from his classes. When he has tried to \nuse the restroom during passing periods between classes it is so far away that he is \nfrequently late for his next class.  \n30.  At times he has asked to use the restroom during class periods, and he has been \nrefused. \n31.  Moreover, as he has gotten older and more secure with asserting his identity as a \nboy, he has become increasingly disturbed about having to use the clinic restroom and \nnot being able to use the boys’ restrooms like all the other boys in the school. He feels that \nhe is being singled out and that he is not accepted for who he is. \n32.  This has caused him anxiety and unhappiness. \n33.  These feeling are increased by the fact that although he is referred to by his male \nfirst name by many of the regular teachers a number of them continue to refer to him by \nfemale, not male, pronouns. \n34.  Substitute teachers routinely refer to him with female pronouns. \n35.  In September of this year, he became a patient at the Gender Health Program at \nRiley at IU Health in Indianapolis where he is receiving care and treatment for the \n[5] \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-MPB   Document 1   Filed 12/03/21   Page 6 of 11 PageID #: 6\ndiagnosed condition of gender dysphoria. \n36.  As  part  of  his  treatment  for  gender  dysphoria,  A.C.  has  been  prescribed \nmedication to prevent him from having periods. When medically appropriate, A.C. will \nstart masculinizing hormones. \n37.  M.C., on A.C.’s behalf, has petitioned a Morgan County state court for a legal name \nand gender marker change so that A.C.’s birth certificate can be amended to reflect his \nmale gender and the name he uses that reflects his gender. That matter is currently \npending. \n38.  Because of her concerns over the school’s refusal to allow her son to live his school \nlife as a boy, M.C. consulted with Gender Nexus, an organization for transgender and \nnonbinary persons, a representative of whom emailed the school’s principal in the fall of \nthis year, requesting a meeting.  \n39.  On November 3, 2021, A.C., his mother, and representatives of Gender Nexus met \nwith school personnel. The principal was not there, instead a school counselor was \npresent. \n40.  At this meeting A.C., his mother, and the advocates indicated that A.C. had the \nright to use the restroom that aligned with his gender identity. A.C. also asked to \nparticipate in boys’ soccer in the fall of 2022. \n41.  The counselor indicated that he would have to check with the “higher ups” and \nwould get back to A.C. and his mother. \n[6] \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-MPB   Document 1   Filed 12/03/21   Page 7 of 11 PageID #: 7\n42.  Within an hour and a half, the counselor left a voice mail for M.C. indicating that \nthe information he had received from the principal of the John R. Wooden Middle School \nwas that A.C. would have to continue using the health clinic restroom, although he would \nbe given extended time to do so. The counselor also stated that the school would allow \nA.C. to be educated at home with on-line schooling. Finally, the counselor stated that the \nschool needed to follow the IHSAA (Indiana High School Athletic Association) rules \nconcerning athletic participation. Nothing was said about the school requiring staff to \nrefer to A.C. using male pronouns. A.C. and his mother understood that to mean that no \nsuch requirement would be issued by the school. \n43.  Following the November 3, 2021, meeting, and despite the counselor’s voice mail, \nA.C. began to use the boys’ restrooms at the school. \n44.  The urinals in the restrooms have partitions between them and the toilet stalls all \nhave doors.  \n45.  When using the boys’ restrooms he received no adverse reactions from other \nstudents, and he found this acceptance comforting. \n46.  However, on November 22, 2021, a teacher saw him using the boys’ restroom and \nthe  teacher  sent  A.C.  to  the  office  where  he  met  with  administrative  staff  who \nadmonished A.C. and instructed him that he could not use the boys’ restroom. They \nthreatened him with punishment if he used the boys’ restroom. \n47.  During  his  time  in  the  office,  A.C.  called  his  stepfather,  who  spoke  to  the \n[7] \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-MPB   Document 1   Filed 12/03/21   Page 8 of 11 PageID #: 8\nadministrators. During the conversation an administrator repeatedly misgendered A.C., \nreferring to him as a girl.  \n48.  The school’s refusal to accept A.C. as a boy and being disciplined for using the \nmale restroom was extremely upsetting to A.C. and he stayed home from school the next \nday.  \n49.  On November 29, 2021, the principal of John R. Wooden Middle School called A.C. \ninto his office and instructed him that he was not to use the boys’ restroom and that other \nparents and the community had a voice in what restrooms A.C. used. \n50.  A.C. called his mother on his phone while in the office and the principal told W.C. \nthat A.C. would have to use the girls’ restroom or the restroom in the health clinic, that \nthe community had taken a vote on it, and that she should express her opinions at the \nSchool Board.  \n51.  Certain staff persons have continued to refuse to refer to A.C. with male pronouns.  \n52.  Although the IHSAA has a formal policy governing athletic participation by \ntransgender students, it only applies to athletes in the 9th-12th grades and makes no \nmention of younger students. See Purpose of the IHSAA, https://www.ihsaa.org/About- \nIHSAA/Current-Information/Purpose (last visited Nov. 26, 2021). \n53.  A.C.  is  being  caused  psychological  stress  and  injury  by  the  actions  of  the \ndefendants in that they serve to reemphasize the disconnect between his sex assigned at \nbirth and gender identity and cause him continuing depression, anxiety, mental distress, \n[8] \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-MPB   Document 1   Filed 12/03/21   Page 9 of 11 PageID #: 9\nand other injuries. \n54.  A.C. is being caused irreparable harm for which there is no adequate remedy at \nlaw. \n55.  The Metropolitan School District of Martinsville is a recipient of federal funding \nand is an entity covered by Title IX. \n56.  At all times defendants have acted and have failed to act under color of state law. \n57.  The actions and inactions of defendants represent intentional discrimination and \nhave damaged plaintiff. \nLegal claims \n58.  The failure to allow A.C. to use male restrooms at John R. Wooden Middle School \nand to require that he be referred to as a male, using pronouns consistent with his gender \nidentity, and allowing him to participate in soccer with the boys’ team,  represents \nunlawful discrimination because of sex in violation of Title IX, 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a), for \nwhich the Metropolitan School District of Martinsville is liable. \n59.  The failure to allow A.C. to use male restrooms at John R. Wooden Middle School \nand to require that he be referred to as a male, using pronouns consistent with his gender \nidentity, and allowing him to participate in soccer with the boys’ team, violates the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, for which the Principal of the John R. \nWooden School, in his official capacity, is liable. \nWHEREFORE, A.C. requests that this Court: \n[9] \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-MPB   Document 1   Filed 12/03/21   Page 10 of 11 PageID #: 10\na.   Accept jurisdiction of this case and set it for prompt hearing. \n \nb.  Declare that defendants have violated the plaintiff’s rights for the reasons \nnoted above. \n \nc.   Enter a preliminary injunction requiring defendants to allow A.C. to use \nboys’ restrooms and further requiring that A.C. be referred to by school personnel \nas male, using the pronouns associated with his gender identity. \n \nd.   Enter a permanent injunction, requiring defendants to allow treat A.C. a \nboy in all respects, allowing him to use male restrooms and other facilities, and \nfurther requiring that A.C. be referred to by school personnel as male, using the \npronouns associated with his gender identity and allowing A.C. to participate on \nthe boys’ soccer team in the fall of 2022. \n \ne.  Award plaintiff his damages. \n \nf.   Award plaintiff his reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 1988. \n \ng.

WOODEN MIDDLE  )   \nSCHOOL in his official capacity,  ) \n  )   \nDefendants.  )   \n \nORDER ON PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n \n  This matter is before the Court on a Motion for Preliminary Injunction filed pursuant to \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 by Plaintiff A.C. a minor child, by his next friend, mother and \nlegal guardian, M.C. (\"A.C.\"). (Filing No. 9.) A.C. initiated this lawsuit against Defendants \nMetropolitan School District of Martinsville and Principal of John R. Wooden Middle School in \nhis official capacity (collectively, the \"School District\") seeking declaratory and injunctive relief \nfor violations of Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (Filing \nNo. 1.)  A.C. seeks to enjoin the School District from restricting his use of male restrooms and \nrequests that Defendants treat him as a male student in all respects.  For the following reasons, the \nCourt grants the Motion for Preliminary Injunction. \nI.  BACKGROUND \n  A.C. is a transgender, 13-year-old boy who lives with his mother, M.C., in Martinsville, \nIndiana.  (Filing No. 30 at 9.)  Though designated a female at birth, when A.C. was 8 years old he \nrealized he identified as a boy.  Id.  When he turned 9 years old, A.C. told his mother that he was \nnot a girl and wanted to be referred to by a boy's name and addressed using male pronouns. Id. \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-MPB   Document 50   Filed 04/29/22   Page 2 of 16 PageID #: 584\nFrom that point, A.C. was referred to by his preferred name and addressed with \"he\" or \"they\" \npronouns.  Id.  A.C. also began presenting himself as a boy, wearing masculine clothing and having \na masculine haircut.  Id.  Around this same time, A.C.'s mother contacted his grade school and \nasked that teachers refer to him by his preferred name and use male pronouns.1  Id. at 10.   \nA.C. has been given the clinical diagnosis of gender dysphoria, a condition that occurs \nwhen there is a marked incongruence between a person's experienced gender and their gender \nassigned at birth, and is accompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment in areas of \ntheir functioning.  (Filing No. 29-1 at 4.) He is under the care of physicians at the Gender Health \nClinic at Riley Children's Hospital where he is being given medication for menstrual suppression; \nand he hopes and expects to be taking male hormones in the near future.                                                           \n  When  A.C.  began  school  at  John  R.  Wooden  Middle  School,  located  within  the  \nMetropolitan School District of Martinsville, he was offered the use of the school's single-sex \nrestroom located in the school's medical clinic.  (Filing No. 30 at 11.)  This accommodation, \nhowever, was not convenient for A.C. as he felt singled out and the clinic restroom was far from \nmost of his classes.  Because of the distance of the restroom, A.C. was marked tardy several times, \nwhich could have resulted in possible discipline.  Id. at 11.  A.C. began to experience anxiety, \ndepression and stigmatization.  Due to his struggles, A.C.'s stepfather called the School District \nand requested that A.C. be allowed to use the boys' restroom. (Filing No. 35 at 6.) The School \nDistrict denied this request and stated A.C. could continue using the clinic's restroom.  Id. \n  Over the frustration with the restroom access, M.C. contacted a transgender advocacy \ngroup, GenderNexus, to assist in advocating to the School District on A.C.'s behalf. (Filing No. 30 \n \n1 In his opening brief, A.C. also brought claims based on staff members and substitutes referring to A.C. with his \nprevious name and using feminine pronouns.  In his reply he withdrew these claims as a basis for the preliminary \ninjunction.  \n2 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-MPB   Document 50   Filed 04/29/22   Page 3 of 16 PageID #: 585\nat 12.)  A representative from GenderNexus arranged and attended a meeting between M.C., A.C., \nand the School District. Id. The representative provided information about A.C.'s rights as a \ntransgender student and the group discussed the need for A.C. to use the boys' restroom.  Id.  At \nthe end of the meeting, a school counselor said he would ask \"higher-ups\" about the restroom \nrequest.  Id.  After conferring with the principal of the middle school, M.C. was advised that the \nSchool District would not allow A.C. to use the boys' restroom, but that it would no longer \ndiscipline A.C. for being late to class.  Id.  The counselor also noted that the School District was \nwilling to allow A.C. to switch to remote learning.  Id. \n  Contrary to the School District 's decision, A.C. began using the boys' restrooms after the \nmeeting.  Id. at 13.  During the three weeks he was able to use the boys' restrooms, A.C. reported \nthat he felt more comfortable at school, his attitude changed completely, and he felt better about \nhimself.  Additionally, there were no reported issues or complaints from A.C.'s classmates.  Id.  A \nstaff member, however, saw A.C. using a boys' restroom and reported it to the administration. \n(Filing No. 35 at 8.)  A.C. was called in for a meeting with the school counselor who reminded \nhim that he was not allowed to use the boys' restrooms and would be punished if he continued to \ndo so.  (Filing No. 30 at 13.)  The School District also advised staff that students should only be \nusing the restrooms of the sex each student was assigned at birth or the clinic restroom.  Id.  Staff \nwere also told to notify the front office when a transgender student requested to use the restroom \nduring class so that student could be monitored for compliance with this policy.  Id. \n  The week after his meeting with the school counselor, A.C. was called to the office to meet \nwith the principal.  Id.  The principal told A.C. that he was not allowed to use the boys' restrooms, \nthat he must only use the girls' restrooms or the one located in the clinic, and that he would be \npunished if he continued using the boys' restrooms.  Id. at 13-14.  M.C. was called during that \n3 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-MPB   Document 50   Filed 04/29/22   Page 4 of 16 PageID #: 586\nmeeting and told that if she wanted A.C. to use the boys' restroom, she would need to contact the \nschool board.  Id. at 14. \n  Though it was never mentioned to A.C. or his parents prior to initiating this litigation, the \nSchool District has an unofficial policy for allowing transgender students to use the bathroom that \naligns with their gender on a \"case-by-case\" basis.  Id.  The factors used by the School District in \nmaking these decisions include how long the student has identified as transgender; whether the \nstudent is under a physician's care; if the student has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria; if the \nstudent is prescribed hormones; and if the student has filed for a legal name and gender marker \nchange.  Id.  After learning about this policy, A.C. submitted documentation from his supervising \nphysician, Dr. Dennis Fortenberry.  Id.  Dr. Fortenberry has not had any direct discussions with \nA.C., however, he is the supervising doctor at the Gender Health Clinic at Riley Children's \nHospital.  (Filing No. 29-1.)  The School District, however, has not granted A.C. access to the \nboys' restrooms since receiving this information from Dr. Fortenberry.  (Filing No. 30 at 14.) As a \nresult, A.C. reports that his education is being disrupted, \"he dreads going to school, is unable to \nfocus there, and comes home depressed and humiliated.\" Id. at 15. And despite the physical \ndiscomfort, A.C. sometimes tries to go the entire day without using the restroom at all. \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \n  \"A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.\"  Winter \nv. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008).  \"In each case, courts must \nbalance the competing claims of injury and must consider the effect on each party of the granting \nor withholding of the requested relief.\"  Id. (citation and quotation marks omitted).  Granting a \npreliminary injunction is \"an exercise of a very far-reaching power, never to be indulged in except \n4 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-MPB   Document 50   Filed 04/29/22   Page 5 of 16 PageID #: 587\nin a case clearly demanding it.\" Roland Mach Co. v. Dresser, Inc., 749 F.2d 380, 389 (7th Cir. \n1984) (citation and quotation marks omitted). \nTo obtain a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff must establish that it has some \nlikelihood of success on the merits; that without relief it will suffer irreparable \nharm. If the plaintiff fails to meet any of these threshold requirements, the court \nmust deny the injunction. However, if the plaintiff passes that threshold, the court \nmust weigh the harm that the plaintiff will suffer absent an injunction against the \nharm to the defendant from an injunction, and consider whether an injunction is in \nthe public interest. \n \nGeft Outdoors, LLC v. City of Westfield, 922 F.3d 357, 364 (7th Cir. 2019) (citations and quotation \nmarks omitted).  Courts in the Seventh Circuit employ a sliding scale approach where the greater \nthe likelihood of success, the less harm the moving party needs to show to obtain an injunction, \nand vice versa.  Girl Scouts of Manitou Council, Inc. v. Girl Scouts of the United States of America, \nInc., 549 F.3d 1079, 1086 (7th Cir. 2008).  \nIII.  DISCUSSION \n  At this stage of the case, the only issue before this Court is whether A.C. is entitled to the \npreliminary injunctive relief he seeks; specifically, to use the boys' restrooms at his school.2  To \nobtain a preliminary injunction, A.C. must establish the following factors: (1) that he is likely to \nsucceed on the merits of both his Title IX and Equal Protection claims; (2) that he has no adequate \nremedy at law; (3) that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; \n(4) that the balance of equities tip in his favor; and (5) issuing the injunction is in the public interest. \nGeft, 922 F.3d at 364.  The first two factors are threshold determinations.  \"If the moving party \nmeets these threshold requirements, the district court 'must consider the irreparable harm that the \nnonmoving party will suffer if preliminary relief is granted, balancing such harm against the \nirreparable harm the moving party will suffer if relief is denied.'\"  Stuller, Inc. v. Steak N Shake \n \n2 In his Complaint, A.C. also requests that he be allowed to participate on the boys' soccer team, but given that soccer \nseason is a number of months away, he elected to not seek injunctive relief on that issue. \n5 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-MPB   Document 50   Filed 04/29/22   Page 6 of 16 PageID #: 588\nEnterprises, Inc., 695 F.3d 676, 678 (7th Cir. 2012) (quoting Ty, Inc. v. Jones Group, Inc., 237 \nF.3d 891, 895 (7th Cir. 2001)). The Court will address each factor in turn. \nA.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n  Title IX provides that \"[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be \nexcluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under \nany education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance . . . .\" 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). \nTo support a Title IX claim, a plaintiff must show (1) that the educational institution intentionally \ndiscriminated against the plaintiff based on the plaintiff's sex, and (2) that \"gender was a motivating \nfactor in the decision to impose the discipline.\"  Doe v. Indiana Univ.-Bloomington, 2019 WL \n341760, at *8 (S.D. Ind. Jan. 28, 2019) (quoting King v. DePauw Univ., 2014 WL 4197507, at *10 \n(S.D. Ind. Aug 22, 2014)).  The formative question the Court must answer is \"do the alleged facts, \nif true, raise a plausible interference that [the School District] discriminated against [A.C.] on the \nbasis of sex?\"  Doe v. Purdue Univ., 928 F.3d 652, 667-668 (7th Cir. 2019). \n  The Seventh Circuit has held that discrimination against a person on the basis of their \ntransgender status constitutes discrimination based on sex, which is prohibited by both Title IX \nand the Equal Protection Clause. (Filing No. 30 at 16-17.)  In Whitaker ex rel. Whitaker v. Kenosha \nUnified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Education, 858 F.3d 1034 (7th Cir. 2017), a transgender student \nalleged that a policy barring him from using the boys' restroom violated Title IX and the Equal \nProtection  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment.  Id.  at  1039.  The  district  court  granted  a \npreliminary injunction in favor of the student, and the Seventh Circuit agreed.  Id.  The Seventh \nCircuit held that a school policy that subjects transgender students to different rules, sanctions, and \ntreatment than non-transgender students violates Title IX.  Id. at 1049-50. \n6 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-MPB   Document 50   Filed 04/29/22   Page 7 of 16 PageID #: 589\n  A.C. contends that the Seventh Circuit's decision in Whitaker \"makes plain that denying \nA.C. the ability to use the boys' restrooms in his school violates Title IX.\" (Filing No. 30 at 19.) \n\"A policy that requires an individual to use a bathroom that does not conform with his or her gender \nidentity punishes that individual for his or her gender non-conformance, which in turn violates \nTitle IX . . . . Providing a gender-neutral alternative is not sufficient to relieve the School District \nfrom liability, as it is the policy itself which violates the Act.\"  Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1049-50.  \nA.C. asserts that just like in Whitaker¸ the School District is punishing him for his transgender \nstatus and, as the Seventh Circuit has made clear, this violates Title IX.  (Filing No. 30 at 21.)  \n  A.C. argues that he will succeed on his Equal Protection claim.  Id. at 25.  As his status as \ntransgender is a classification based on sex, he contends the School District's action is subjected \nto a form of heightened scrutiny that is somewhere in between rational basis and strict scrutiny. \nId.  With intermediate scrutiny, \"the burden rests with the state to demonstrate that its proffered \njustification is exceedingly persuasive,\" which requires the state to show that the \"classification \nserves  important  governmental  objectives  and  that  the  discriminatory  means  employed  are \nsubstantially related to the achievement of those objectives.\"  Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1050-51. \n  A.C. contends the decision of the School District to deny A.C. access to the boys' restrooms \nwas based on concerns about \"privacy.\"  Id. at 26-27.  He points out that in Whitaker the court \naddressed alleged privacy concerns, rejected those concerns and determined that they  were \n\"insufficient to establish an exceedingly persuasive justification for the classification.\" Id. Other \ncourts have reached the same conclusions, both for other transgender students seeking restroom \naccess, as well as for non-transgender students seeking to prohibit students from using the \nrestrooms associated with their gender identities.  Id. at 28 (citing Parents for Privacy v. Barr, 949 \nF.3d 1210 (9th Cir. 2020); Doe by & through Doe v. Boyertown Area Sch. Dist., 897 F.3d 518 (3d \n7 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-MPB   Document 50   Filed 04/29/22   Page 8 of 16 PageID #: 590\nCir. 2018)).  For all these reasons, A.C. contends that he will also be successful on his equal \nprotection claim. \n  In response, the School District argues that A.C.'s request to use the boys' restrooms is \nunlikely to succeed because Title IX expressly allows institutions to provide separate restroom \nfacilities on the basis of sex.  (Filing No. 35 at 13.)  The School District contends that Title IX's \nimplementing regulations expressly state that institutions \"may provide separate toilet, locker \nroom, and shower facilities on the basis of sex, but such facilities provided for students of one sex \nshall be comparable to such facilities provided for students of the other sex.\"  34 C.F.R. § 106.33.  \nThe School District asserts that Title IX expressly permits the segregation of facilities on the basis \nof enduring biological differences in areas where biological differences matter.  (Filing No. 35 at \n14.)  Arguing that it is consistent with these regulations, the School District argues that it is \ncomplying with Title IX.  Id. \n  The School District argues that A.C. overly relies on the Seventh Circuit's decision in \nWhitaker and that it should be disregarded for four reasons.  Id. at 16.  First, the Seventh Circuit \nhas criticized Whitaker for using the wrong standard of review.  Id. (citing Ill. Republican Party v. \nPritzker, 973 F.3d 760, 762-63 (7th Cir. 2020)).  Because of this, the School District argues that \nthe discussion of the merits in Whitaker should have no precedential value.  Id. \n  Second, the School District argues that the court's analysis in Whitaker is put in doubt by \nthe United States Supreme Court's decision in Bostock v. Clayton Cnty, Georgia, 140 S. Ct. 1731 \n(2020).  Id. While the Seventh Circuit looked to Title VII in deciding Whitaker, the School District \ncontends that in Bostock, the court expressly declined to extend its ruling as it pertained to sex \ndiscrimination in the workplace (which is prohibited by Title VII) to issues pertaining to sex \nassigned restrooms and locker rooms (which are expressly permitted by Title IX).  Id. \n8 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-MPB   Document 50   Filed 04/29/22   Page 9 of 16 PageID #: 591\n  Third,  the  School  District  argues  that  the  Whitaker  analysis  assumed  that  the  sex \nstereotyping framework borrowed from Title VII applies in the Title IX restroom context, which \nBostock does not embrace.  Id. at 17.  The School District asserts that the Supreme Court \n\"specifically reserved this very issue for another day, and Whitaker offers no help in understanding \nwhy the distinction is 'on the basis of sex.'\"  Id.  The School District contends that if requiring \nstudents to use restrooms based on sex is unlawful sex stereotyping, then Title IX is itself unlawful.  \nId. \n  And finally, the School District argues that its position cannot be characterized as sex \nstereotyping.  The School District contends that, consistent with Title IX and its regulations, the \nSchool District's position is based on Title IX allowing schools to separate restroom facilities on \nthe basis of sex.  Id.  The School District also asserts that this aligns with the testimony of A.C.'s \nown expert, who acknowledges that sex is different than gender.  Id. \n  The School District also argues that A.C. will not be successful on his Equal Protection \nclaim.  Id. at 18.  The School District agrees that its classification is subject to intermediate \nscrutiny, but that it can meet the two requirements: (1) that the classification serves important \ngovernmental objectives; and (2) the discriminatory means employed are substantially related to \nthe achievement of those objectives. Id. (citing United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 \n(1996)).  \n  The School District first contends that the policy or practice of separate facilities \"serves \nimportant objectives of protecting the interests of students in using the restroom away from the \nopposite sex and in shielding their bodies from exposure to the opposite sex.\"  Id.  Citing a variety \nof cases on the issue of privacy, the School District argues that if the approach to protect privacy \ndoes not satisfy constitutional scrutiny, then neither does Title IX's facilities provisions.  Id. at 19. \n9 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-MPB   Document 50   Filed 04/29/22   Page 10 of 16 PageID #: 592\n  Next,  the  School  District  argues  that  its  policy  is  also  substantially  related  to  the \nachievement of these objectives, as it requires that students use the restroom in a separate space \nfrom the opposite sex and that this protects against exposure of a student's body to the opposite \nsex.  Id.  The School District argues that this position does not violate Equal Protection and weighs \nagainst granting an injunction.  Id. at 19-20. Additionally, the School District asserts that any \nreliance on the Seventh Circuit's decision in Whitaker is unreliable as the \"analysis wrongly applies \nTitle VII jurisprudence in an area in which the U.S. Supreme Court has not yet gone.\"  Id. at 20. \n  The School District lastly argues that, to the extent Whitaker applies, its position of making \nan individualized determination as to whether a student who identifies as transgender will be \nallowed access to restrooms different than their sex complies with the law. Id. The School District \nwas not provided the type of information it needed prior to the initiation of the lawsuit.  Id. at 21. \nAdditionally, unlike the plaintiff in Whitaker who was a high schooler, the School District A.C. is \nonly a seventh grader and is \"less mature\" and only \"on the threshold of awareness of human \nsexuality.\"  Id.  A.C. has not received hormones and at the time this action was filed, he had not \ncompleted a legal name and gender marker change.  Id.  At the time of oral argument, A.C.'s legal \nname change had been granted by the state court; however, on the same day as oral arguments, his \ngender marker change request was denied by the state court.  (Filing No. 41.)  Given these \ndifferences, as well as the Supreme Court failing to discuss or decide the issue in Bostock, the \nSchool District argues that it complied with the law in its initial determination to deny A.C. access \nto the boys' restrooms and in continuing to seek additional information that may alter that \ndetermination.  (Filing No. 35 at 21.) \n  The Court finds that A.C. has established a likelihood of success on the merits of his claims. \nFor all its arguments presented both in its briefing and at oral argument, the School District has \n10 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-MPB   Document 50   Filed 04/29/22   Page 11 of 16 PageID #: 593\nprovided no convincing argument that Whitaker does not control and favors A.C.'s likely success \non his claims. Whitaker remains good law and thus is binding on this court.3   \nAnd the School District appears to confuse its Title IX compliance of maintaining separate \nsex restrooms with the claims A.C. is alleging in this case.  A.C.'s claims are based on the School \nDistrict's treatment of him as an individual, not a complaint that the School District lacks \nappropriate facilities.  A.C. has not requested that additional facilities be built, or the current ones \nbe redesignated in any way.  Rather, he is seeking to use those facilities that already exist and align \nwith his gender identity; his claim is solely that the School District is forbidding him from doing \nso. \n  Additionally, the School District's arguments that it was not provided enough information \nprior to the initiation of this lawsuit, as well as its arguments about A.C. not receiving hormones \nand a gender marker change, fail to undermine the likely success of A.C.'s claims.  The School \nDistrict's transgender policy is unwritten and was not provided to A.C. until after the initiation of \nthis lawsuit.  Further, there was no evidence presented that taking hormones and receiving a gender \nmarker change on one's birth certificate are required prerequisites to identify as a transgender \nperson, much less that either of these factors would automatically authorize A.C. to use the boys' \nrestrooms.  In fact, at oral argument, counsel for the School District was unable to say whether a \ngender marker change or receiving hormones would be enough for the School District to change \nits decision regarding A.C. using the boys' restrooms.  Instead, counsel was only able to say that \nhe thought it would have \"significant impact\" on the decision. \n \n3 The Court perceives that the School District is aware of the controlling nature of Whitaker given that at oral argument \ncounsel for the School District admitted that this Court \"isn't in a position to overrule Whitaker\" and made clear that \nthe arguments were being presented \"for the purposes of our record . . . if this did go up on appeal.\"  \n11 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-MPB   Document 50   Filed 04/29/22   Page 12 of 16 PageID #: 594\n  Given the evidence before this Court and the controlling precedent from the Seventh \nCircuit, the Court finds that A.C. has established a likelihood of success on the merits of both his \nTitle IX and Equal Protection claims. \nB.  Irreparable Harm, Inadequate Remedy at Law, and Balance of Harms \n  As  argued  by  A.C.,  it  is  well-established  that  the  denial  of  constitutional  rights  is \nirreparable harm in and of itself.  (Filing No. 30 at 29.)  Based on a violation of his equal-protection \nrights, A.C. contends that he has established irreparable harm.  Id. at 30.  Additionally, A.C. asserts \nthat he has established that the School District 's actions caused him ongoing emotional harm and \ndistress, for which there is no adequate remedy at law.  Id. \n  A.C. also argues that because he has established a substantial likelihood of success on the \nmerits, \"no substantial harm to others can be said to inhere\" from the issuance of an injunction.  Id. \nat 32 (citing Déjà vu of Nashville, Inc. v. Metro. Gov't of Nashville, 274 F.3d 377, 400 (6th Cir. \n2001)). An injunction will only force the School District to conform its conduct to the requirements \nof the Constitution and federal law, which cannot be harmful to the School District.  Id. \n  In response, the School District argues that the balance of harms weighs against A.C.'s \nrequest to have access to the boys' restrooms.  (Filing No. 35 at 22.)  The School District notes that \nit has made accommodations to allow A.C. more time to use the restroom, and the fact that he may \noccasionally be late to class is not evidence of irreparable harm.  Id.  The School District disputes  \nthat A.C. has been ostracized for the use of the clinic's restroom, and points out that unlike the \nsingle restroom accessible for Whitaker which invited more scrutiny and attention from peers, the \nclinic restroom is available for use by all students with permission from the school nurse.  Id. It \nargues Concerning A.C.'s expert, the School District asserts that Dr. Fortenberry, \nhas not participated in the care of A.C., has not had any direct discussion with A.C. \nor M.C., has not performed any individualized assessment as to the severity of harm \n12 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-MPB   Document 50   Filed 04/29/22   Page 13 of 16 PageID #: 595\nthat A.C. will experience if not allowed to access the boys' restroom, and has not \nperformed an individualized assessment of the reduction of harm if A.C. is allowed \naccess to the boys' restroom. \n \nId.  Finally, the School District argues the balance of harms analysis favors maintaining the status \nquo.  Id. at 23.  Granting \"unrestricted access\" to A.C. to use the boys' restrooms would violate the \nprivacy interests of other students and classmates, as well as cause the School District to be unable \nto rely on Title IX's regulations.  Id. \n  The Court is not persuaded by the School Districts arguments. Although any student may \nuse the restroom in the clinic, in order to do so the student (including A.C.) must enter the health \nclinic, ask permission from the school nurse and then sign in before they may use that restroom.  \nThis process appears to invite scrutiny and attention. In support of his Motion, A.C. provided a \ndeclaration in which he described feeling stigmatized and that being excluded from the boys' \nrestrooms \"worsens the anxiety and depression\" caused by his gender dysphoria and makes him \nfeel isolated.  (Filing No. 29-3 at 5.)  He affirms that the School District's decision \"makes being \nat school painful.\"  Id.  A.C.'s mother also reported that the issues with the restroom have been \nemotionally harmful to A.C. and that she is concerned for the possible medical risks associated \nwith him trying not to use the restroom during school.  (Filing No. 29-2 at 6.)  Like other courts \nrecognizing the potential harm to transgender students, this Court finds no reason to question the \ncredibility of A.C.'s account and that the negative emotional consequences with being refused \naccess  to  the  boys'  restrooms  constitute  irreparable  harm  that  would  be  \"difficult—if  not \nimpossible—to reverse.\"  J.A.W. v. Evansville Vanderburgh Sch. Corp., 323 F. Supp. 3d 1030, \n1039 (S.D. Ind. 2018) (quoting Michigan v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 667 F.3d 765, 788 (7th \nCir. 2011).  Likewise, a presumption of irreparable harm exists for some constitutional violations. \nSee Ezell v. City of Chicago, 651 F.3d 684, 699 (7th Cir. 2011). \n13 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-MPB   Document 50   Filed 04/29/22   Page 14 of 16 PageID #: 596\n  Additionally, the Court finds that there is no adequate remedy at law to compensate A.C. \nfor the harm he could continue to experience.  While monetary damages may be adequate in the \ncase of tort actions, the emotional harm identified by A.C. could not be \"fully rectified by an award \nof money damages.\"  J.A.W., 323 F. Supp. 3d at 1039-40; see also Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1054.  \n  Finally, the Court must evaluate the balance of harms to each party. While A.C. has \nprovided evidence of the harm he will likely suffer, the School District's alleged potential harm is \nunsupported.  No student has complained concerning their privacy.  The School District's concerns \nwith the privacy of other students appears entirely conjectural.  No evidence was provided to \nsupport the School District's concerns, and other courts dealing with similar defenses have also \ndismissed them as unfounded. See Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1052; J.A.W., 323 F. Supp. 3d at 1041. \nMoreover, the School District's concerns over privacy are undermined given that it has already \ngranted permission for other transgender students to use the restroom of their identified gender, \nand it has presented no evidence of problems when the other transgender student have used \nrestrooms consistent with their gender identity.  \n  Because A.C. has demonstrated that he will likely suffer irreparable harm, and the School \nDistrict has failed to support its claims of prospective harm, the Court finds that the balance weighs \nin favor of granting A.C.'s request.  \nC.  Public Interest \n  Finally, A.C. argues that \"[t]he public interest is also furthered by the injunction here, as \nan injunction in favor of constitutional rights and the rights secured by Title IX is always in the \npublic interest. (Filing No. 30 at 33.) In response, the School District argues that public policy \nweighs in its favor.  Based on its assertion that Title IX favors the separation of facilities, the \nSchool District contends that its policy furthers the interest of personal privacy. (Filing No. 35 at \n14 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-MPB   Document 50   Filed 04/29/22   Page 15 of 16 PageID #: 597\n24.) The School District argues \"[t]o the extent that Title IX should not allow the separation of \nsuch facilities, that decision should be made through elected representatives in Congress, using \nclearly understood text, or through the notice and comment process for the revision of federal \nregulations required by the Administrative Procedure Act.\"  Id. \n  While acknowledging that the public interest favors furthering individual privacy interests, \nthe Court does not believe that granting A.C. access to the boys' restrooms threatens those interests. \nThe restrooms at the middle school have stalls and as argues by A.C.'s counsel, restrooms are an \narea where people are usually private which minimizes exposure of a student's body to the opposite \nsex.  Since he was eight years old, A.C. has identified as male, and has dressed as a boy and had a \nboy haircut. He is under a physician's care, has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, and has \nbeen granted a legal name.  The School District's arguments regarding its facilities again confuses \nthe basis of A.C.'s claim, which is solely based on the School District's treatment of him as an \nindividual.  Having determined that granting A.C.'s Motion is in the public interest, as well as A.C. \nestablishing the other required factors, the Court finds that A.C.'s requested preliminary injunction \nshould be granted.  \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n  The overwhelming majority of federal courts˗˗including the Court of Appeals for the \nSeventh Circuit˗˗ have recently examined transgender education-discrimination claims under Title \nIX and concluded that preventing a transgender student from using a school restroom consistent \nwith the student’s gender identity violates Title IX.  This Court concurs.  For the reasons stated \nabove, A.C.'s Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Filing No. 9) is GRANTED.  The School District \nshall permit A.C. to use any boys' restroom within John R. Wooden Middle School.  \n  SO ORDERED. \n \n15 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-MPB   Document 50   Filed 04/29/22   Page 16 of 16 PageID #: 598\nDate:   4/29/2022 \n \n \nDISTRIBUTION: \n \nKenneth J.

WOODEN MIDDLE  )   \nSCHOOL in his official capacity,  ) \n  )   \nDefendants.  )   \n \nORDER ON PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n \n  This matter is before the Court on a Motion for Preliminary Injunction filed pursuant to \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 by Plaintiff A.C. a minor child, by his next friend, mother and \nlegal guardian, M.C. (\"A.C.\"). (Filing No. 9.) A.C. initiated this lawsuit against Defendants \nMetropolitan School District of Martinsville and Principal of John R. Wooden Middle School in \nhis official capacity (collectively, the \"School District\") seeking declaratory and injunctive relief \nfor violations of Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (Filing \nNo. 1.)  A.C. seeks to enjoin the School District from restricting his use of male restrooms and \nrequests that Defendants treat him as a male student in all respects.  For the following reasons, the \nCourt grants the Motion for Preliminary Injunction. \nI.  BACKGROUND \n  A.C. is a transgender, 13-year-old boy who lives with his mother, M.C., in Martinsville, \nIndiana.  (Filing No. 30 at 9.)  Though designated a female at birth, when A.C. was 8 years old he \nrealized he identified as a boy.  Id.  When he turned 9 years old, A.C. told his mother that he was \nnot a girl and wanted to be referred to by a boy's name and addressed using male pronouns. Id. \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-TAB   Document 50   Filed 04/29/22   Page 2 of 16 PageID #: 584\nFrom that point, A.C. was referred to by his preferred name and addressed with \"he\" or \"they\" \npronouns.  Id.  A.C. also began presenting himself as a boy, wearing masculine clothing and having \na masculine haircut.  Id.  Around this same time, A.C.'s mother contacted his grade school and \nasked that teachers refer to him by his preferred name and use male pronouns.1  Id. at 10.   \nA.C. has been given the clinical diagnosis of gender dysphoria, a condition that occurs \nwhen there is a marked incongruence between a person's experienced gender and their gender \nassigned at birth, and is accompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment in areas of \ntheir functioning.  (Filing No. 29-1 at 4.) He is under the care of physicians at the Gender Health \nClinic at Riley Children's Hospital where he is being given medication for menstrual suppression; \nand he hopes and expects to be taking male hormones in the near future.                                                           \n  When  A.C.  began  school  at  John  R.  Wooden  Middle  School,  located  within  the  \nMetropolitan School District of Martinsville, he was offered the use of the school's single-sex \nrestroom located in the school's medical clinic.  (Filing No. 30 at 11.)  This accommodation, \nhowever, was not convenient for A.C. as he felt singled out and the clinic restroom was far from \nmost of his classes.  Because of the distance of the restroom, A.C. was marked tardy several times, \nwhich could have resulted in possible discipline.  Id. at 11.  A.C. began to experience anxiety, \ndepression and stigmatization.  Due to his struggles, A.C.'s stepfather called the School District \nand requested that A.C. be allowed to use the boys' restroom. (Filing No. 35 at 6.) The School \nDistrict denied this request and stated A.C. could continue using the clinic's restroom.  Id. \n  Over the frustration with the restroom access, M.C. contacted a transgender advocacy \ngroup, GenderNexus, to assist in advocating to the School District on A.C.'s behalf. (Filing No. 30 \n \n1 In his opening brief, A.C. also brought claims based on staff members and substitutes referring to A.C. with his \nprevious name and using feminine pronouns.  In his reply he withdrew these claims as a basis for the preliminary \ninjunction.  \n2 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-TAB   Document 50   Filed 04/29/22   Page 3 of 16 PageID #: 585\nat 12.)  A representative from GenderNexus arranged and attended a meeting between M.C., A.C., \nand the School District. Id. The representative provided information about A.C.'s rights as a \ntransgender student and the group discussed the need for A.C. to use the boys' restroom.  Id.  At \nthe end of the meeting, a school counselor said he would ask \"higher-ups\" about the restroom \nrequest.  Id.  After conferring with the principal of the middle school, M.C. was advised that the \nSchool District would not allow A.C. to use the boys' restroom, but that it would no longer \ndiscipline A.C. for being late to class.  Id.  The counselor also noted that the School District was \nwilling to allow A.C. to switch to remote learning.  Id. \n  Contrary to the School District 's decision, A.C. began using the boys' restrooms after the \nmeeting.  Id. at 13.  During the three weeks he was able to use the boys' restrooms, A.C. reported \nthat he felt more comfortable at school, his attitude changed completely, and he felt better about \nhimself.  Additionally, there were no reported issues or complaints from A.C.'s classmates.  Id.  A \nstaff member, however, saw A.C. using a boys' restroom and reported it to the administration. \n(Filing No. 35 at 8.)  A.C. was called in for a meeting with the school counselor who reminded \nhim that he was not allowed to use the boys' restrooms and would be punished if he continued to \ndo so.  (Filing No. 30 at 13.)  The School District also advised staff that students should only be \nusing the restrooms of the sex each student was assigned at birth or the clinic restroom.  Id.  Staff \nwere also told to notify the front office when a transgender student requested to use the restroom \nduring class so that student could be monitored for compliance with this policy.  Id. \n  The week after his meeting with the school counselor, A.C. was called to the office to meet \nwith the principal.  Id.  The principal told A.C. that he was not allowed to use the boys' restrooms, \nthat he must only use the girls' restrooms or the one located in the clinic, and that he would be \npunished if he continued using the boys' restrooms.  Id. at 13-14.  M.C. was called during that \n3 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-TAB   Document 50   Filed 04/29/22   Page 4 of 16 PageID #: 586\nmeeting and told that if she wanted A.C. to use the boys' restroom, she would need to contact the \nschool board.  Id. at 14. \n  Though it was never mentioned to A.C. or his parents prior to initiating this litigation, the \nSchool District has an unofficial policy for allowing transgender students to use the bathroom that \naligns with their gender on a \"case-by-case\" basis.  Id.  The factors used by the School District in \nmaking these decisions include how long the student has identified as transgender; whether the \nstudent is under a physician's care; if the student has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria; if the \nstudent is prescribed hormones; and if the student has filed for a legal name and gender marker \nchange.  Id.  After learning about this policy, A.C. submitted documentation from his supervising \nphysician, Dr. Dennis Fortenberry.  Id.  Dr. Fortenberry has not had any direct discussions with \nA.C., however, he is the supervising doctor at the Gender Health Clinic at Riley Children's \nHospital.  (Filing No. 29-1.)  The School District, however, has not granted A.C. access to the \nboys' restrooms since receiving this information from Dr. Fortenberry.  (Filing No. 30 at 14.) As a \nresult, A.C. reports that his education is being disrupted, \"he dreads going to school, is unable to \nfocus there, and comes home depressed and humiliated.\" Id. at 15. And despite the physical \ndiscomfort, A.C. sometimes tries to go the entire day without using the restroom at all. \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \n  \"A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.\"  Winter \nv. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008).  \"In each case, courts must \nbalance the competing claims of injury and must consider the effect on each party of the granting \nor withholding of the requested relief.\"  Id. (citation and quotation marks omitted).  Granting a \npreliminary injunction is \"an exercise of a very far-reaching power, never to be indulged in except \n4 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-TAB   Document 50   Filed 04/29/22   Page 5 of 16 PageID #: 587\nin a case clearly demanding it.\" Roland Mach Co. v. Dresser, Inc., 749 F.2d 380, 389 (7th Cir. \n1984) (citation and quotation marks omitted). \nTo obtain a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff must establish that it has some \nlikelihood of success on the merits; that without relief it will suffer irreparable \nharm. If the plaintiff fails to meet any of these threshold requirements, the court \nmust deny the injunction. However, if the plaintiff passes that threshold, the court \nmust weigh the harm that the plaintiff will suffer absent an injunction against the \nharm to the defendant from an injunction, and consider whether an injunction is in \nthe public interest. \n \nGeft Outdoors, LLC v. City of Westfield, 922 F.3d 357, 364 (7th Cir. 2019) (citations and quotation \nmarks omitted).  Courts in the Seventh Circuit employ a sliding scale approach where the greater \nthe likelihood of success, the less harm the moving party needs to show to obtain an injunction, \nand vice versa.  Girl Scouts of Manitou Council, Inc. v. Girl Scouts of the United States of America, \nInc., 549 F.3d 1079, 1086 (7th Cir. 2008).  \nIII.  DISCUSSION \n  At this stage of the case, the only issue before this Court is whether A.C. is entitled to the \npreliminary injunctive relief he seeks; specifically, to use the boys' restrooms at his school.2  To \nobtain a preliminary injunction, A.C. must establish the following factors: (1) that he is likely to \nsucceed on the merits of both his Title IX and Equal Protection claims; (2) that he has no adequate \nremedy at law; (3) that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; \n(4) that the balance of equities tip in his favor; and (5) issuing the injunction is in the public interest. \nGeft, 922 F.3d at 364.  The first two factors are threshold determinations.  \"If the moving party \nmeets these threshold requirements, the district court 'must consider the irreparable harm that the \nnonmoving party will suffer if preliminary relief is granted, balancing such harm against the \nirreparable harm the moving party will suffer if relief is denied.'\"  Stuller, Inc. v. Steak N Shake \n \n2 In his Complaint, A.C. also requests that he be allowed to participate on the boys' soccer team, but given that soccer \nseason is a number of months away, he elected to not seek injunctive relief on that issue. \n5 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-TAB   Document 50   Filed 04/29/22   Page 6 of 16 PageID #: 588\nEnterprises, Inc., 695 F.3d 676, 678 (7th Cir. 2012) (quoting Ty, Inc. v. Jones Group, Inc., 237 \nF.3d 891, 895 (7th Cir. 2001)). The Court will address each factor in turn. \nA.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n  Title IX provides that \"[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be \nexcluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under \nany education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance . . . .\" 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). \nTo support a Title IX claim, a plaintiff must show (1) that the educational institution intentionally \ndiscriminated against the plaintiff based on the plaintiff's sex, and (2) that \"gender was a motivating \nfactor in the decision to impose the discipline.\"  Doe v. Indiana Univ.-Bloomington, 2019 WL \n341760, at *8 (S.D. Ind. Jan. 28, 2019) (quoting King v. DePauw Univ., 2014 WL 4197507, at *10 \n(S.D. Ind. Aug 22, 2014)).  The formative question the Court must answer is \"do the alleged facts, \nif true, raise a plausible interference that [the School District] discriminated against [A.C.] on the \nbasis of sex?\"  Doe v. Purdue Univ., 928 F.3d 652, 667-668 (7th Cir. 2019). \n  The Seventh Circuit has held that discrimination against a person on the basis of their \ntransgender status constitutes discrimination based on sex, which is prohibited by both Title IX \nand the Equal Protection Clause. (Filing No. 30 at 16-17.)  In Whitaker ex rel. Whitaker v. Kenosha \nUnified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Education, 858 F.3d 1034 (7th Cir. 2017), a transgender student \nalleged that a policy barring him from using the boys' restroom violated Title IX and the Equal \nProtection  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment.  Id.  at  1039.  The  district  court  granted  a \npreliminary injunction in favor of the student, and the Seventh Circuit agreed.  Id.  The Seventh \nCircuit held that a school policy that subjects transgender students to different rules, sanctions, and \ntreatment than non-transgender students violates Title IX.  Id. at 1049-50. \n6 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-TAB   Document 50   Filed 04/29/22   Page 7 of 16 PageID #: 589\n  A.C. contends that the Seventh Circuit's decision in Whitaker \"makes plain that denying \nA.C. the ability to use the boys' restrooms in his school violates Title IX.\" (Filing No. 30 at 19.) \n\"A policy that requires an individual to use a bathroom that does not conform with his or her gender \nidentity punishes that individual for his or her gender non-conformance, which in turn violates \nTitle IX . . . . Providing a gender-neutral alternative is not sufficient to relieve the School District \nfrom liability, as it is the policy itself which violates the Act.\"  Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1049-50.  \nA.C. asserts that just like in Whitaker¸ the School District is punishing him for his transgender \nstatus and, as the Seventh Circuit has made clear, this violates Title IX.  (Filing No. 30 at 21.)  \n  A.C. argues that he will succeed on his Equal Protection claim.  Id. at 25.  As his status as \ntransgender is a classification based on sex, he contends the School District's action is subjected \nto a form of heightened scrutiny that is somewhere in between rational basis and strict scrutiny. \nId.  With intermediate scrutiny, \"the burden rests with the state to demonstrate that its proffered \njustification is exceedingly persuasive,\" which requires the state to show that the \"classification \nserves  important  governmental  objectives  and  that  the  discriminatory  means  employed  are \nsubstantially related to the achievement of those objectives.\"  Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1050-51. \n  A.C. contends the decision of the School District to deny A.C. access to the boys' restrooms \nwas based on concerns about \"privacy.\"  Id. at 26-27.  He points out that in Whitaker the court \naddressed alleged privacy concerns, rejected those concerns and determined that they  were \n\"insufficient to establish an exceedingly persuasive justification for the classification.\" Id. Other \ncourts have reached the same conclusions, both for other transgender students seeking restroom \naccess, as well as for non-transgender students seeking to prohibit students from using the \nrestrooms associated with their gender identities.  Id. at 28 (citing Parents for Privacy v. Barr, 949 \nF.3d 1210 (9th Cir. 2020); Doe by & through Doe v. Boyertown Area Sch. Dist., 897 F.3d 518 (3d \n7 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-TAB   Document 50   Filed 04/29/22   Page 8 of 16 PageID #: 590\nCir. 2018)).  For all these reasons, A.C. contends that he will also be successful on his equal \nprotection claim. \n  In response, the School District argues that A.C.'s request to use the boys' restrooms is \nunlikely to succeed because Title IX expressly allows institutions to provide separate restroom \nfacilities on the basis of sex.  (Filing No. 35 at 13.)  The School District contends that Title IX's \nimplementing regulations expressly state that institutions \"may provide separate toilet, locker \nroom, and shower facilities on the basis of sex, but such facilities provided for students of one sex \nshall be comparable to such facilities provided for students of the other sex.\"  34 C.F.R. § 106.33.  \nThe School District asserts that Title IX expressly permits the segregation of facilities on the basis \nof enduring biological differences in areas where biological differences matter.  (Filing No. 35 at \n14.)  Arguing that it is consistent with these regulations, the School District argues that it is \ncomplying with Title IX.  Id. \n  The School District argues that A.C. overly relies on the Seventh Circuit's decision in \nWhitaker and that it should be disregarded for four reasons.  Id. at 16.  First, the Seventh Circuit \nhas criticized Whitaker for using the wrong standard of review.  Id. (citing Ill. Republican Party v. \nPritzker, 973 F.3d 760, 762-63 (7th Cir. 2020)).  Because of this, the School District argues that \nthe discussion of the merits in Whitaker should have no precedential value.  Id. \n  Second, the School District argues that the court's analysis in Whitaker is put in doubt by \nthe United States Supreme Court's decision in Bostock v. Clayton Cnty, Georgia, 140 S. Ct. 1731 \n(2020).  Id. While the Seventh Circuit looked to Title VII in deciding Whitaker, the School District \ncontends that in Bostock, the court expressly declined to extend its ruling as it pertained to sex \ndiscrimination in the workplace (which is prohibited by Title VII) to issues pertaining to sex \nassigned restrooms and locker rooms (which are expressly permitted by Title IX).  Id. \n8 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-TAB   Document 50   Filed 04/29/22   Page 9 of 16 PageID #: 591\n  Third,  the  School  District  argues  that  the  Whitaker  analysis  assumed  that  the  sex \nstereotyping framework borrowed from Title VII applies in the Title IX restroom context, which \nBostock does not embrace.  Id. at 17.  The School District asserts that the Supreme Court \n\"specifically reserved this very issue for another day, and Whitaker offers no help in understanding \nwhy the distinction is 'on the basis of sex.'\"  Id.  The School District contends that if requiring \nstudents to use restrooms based on sex is unlawful sex stereotyping, then Title IX is itself unlawful.  \nId. \n  And finally, the School District argues that its position cannot be characterized as sex \nstereotyping.  The School District contends that, consistent with Title IX and its regulations, the \nSchool District's position is based on Title IX allowing schools to separate restroom facilities on \nthe basis of sex.  Id.  The School District also asserts that this aligns with the testimony of A.C.'s \nown expert, who acknowledges that sex is different than gender.  Id. \n  The School District also argues that A.C. will not be successful on his Equal Protection \nclaim.  Id. at 18.  The School District agrees that its classification is subject to intermediate \nscrutiny, but that it can meet the two requirements: (1) that the classification serves important \ngovernmental objectives; and (2) the discriminatory means employed are substantially related to \nthe achievement of those objectives. Id. (citing United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 \n(1996)).  \n  The School District first contends that the policy or practice of separate facilities \"serves \nimportant objectives of protecting the interests of students in using the restroom away from the \nopposite sex and in shielding their bodies from exposure to the opposite sex.\"  Id.  Citing a variety \nof cases on the issue of privacy, the School District argues that if the approach to protect privacy \ndoes not satisfy constitutional scrutiny, then neither does Title IX's facilities provisions.  Id. at 19. \n9 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-TAB   Document 50   Filed 04/29/22   Page 10 of 16 PageID #: 592\n  Next,  the  School  District  argues  that  its  policy  is  also  substantially  related  to  the \nachievement of these objectives, as it requires that students use the restroom in a separate space \nfrom the opposite sex and that this protects against exposure of a student's body to the opposite \nsex.  Id.  The School District argues that this position does not violate Equal Protection and weighs \nagainst granting an injunction.  Id. at 19-20. Additionally, the School District asserts that any \nreliance on the Seventh Circuit's decision in Whitaker is unreliable as the \"analysis wrongly applies \nTitle VII jurisprudence in an area in which the U.S. Supreme Court has not yet gone.\"  Id. at 20. \n  The School District lastly argues that, to the extent Whitaker applies, its position of making \nan individualized determination as to whether a student who identifies as transgender will be \nallowed access to restrooms different than their sex complies with the law. Id. The School District \nwas not provided the type of information it needed prior to the initiation of the lawsuit.  Id. at 21. \nAdditionally, unlike the plaintiff in Whitaker who was a high schooler, the School District A.C. is \nonly a seventh grader and is \"less mature\" and only \"on the threshold of awareness of human \nsexuality.\"  Id.  A.C. has not received hormones and at the time this action was filed, he had not \ncompleted a legal name and gender marker change.  Id.  At the time of oral argument, A.C.'s legal \nname change had been granted by the state court; however, on the same day as oral arguments, his \ngender marker change request was denied by the state court.  (Filing No. 41.)  Given these \ndifferences, as well as the Supreme Court failing to discuss or decide the issue in Bostock, the \nSchool District argues that it complied with the law in its initial determination to deny A.C. access \nto the boys' restrooms and in continuing to seek additional information that may alter that \ndetermination.  (Filing No. 35 at 21.) \n  The Court finds that A.C. has established a likelihood of success on the merits of his claims. \nFor all its arguments presented both in its briefing and at oral argument, the School District has \n10 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-TAB   Document 50   Filed 04/29/22   Page 11 of 16 PageID #: 593\nprovided no convincing argument that Whitaker does not control and favors A.C.'s likely success \non his claims. Whitaker remains good law and thus is binding on this court.3   \nAnd the School District appears to confuse its Title IX compliance of maintaining separate \nsex restrooms with the claims A.C. is alleging in this case.  A.C.'s claims are based on the School \nDistrict's treatment of him as an individual, not a complaint that the School District lacks \nappropriate facilities.  A.C. has not requested that additional facilities be built, or the current ones \nbe redesignated in any way.  Rather, he is seeking to use those facilities that already exist and align \nwith his gender identity; his claim is solely that the School District is forbidding him from doing \nso. \n  Additionally, the School District's arguments that it was not provided enough information \nprior to the initiation of this lawsuit, as well as its arguments about A.C. not receiving hormones \nand a gender marker change, fail to undermine the likely success of A.C.'s claims.  The School \nDistrict's transgender policy is unwritten and was not provided to A.C. until after the initiation of \nthis lawsuit.  Further, there was no evidence presented that taking hormones and receiving a gender \nmarker change on one's birth certificate are required prerequisites to identify as a transgender \nperson, much less that either of these factors would automatically authorize A.C. to use the boys' \nrestrooms.  In fact, at oral argument, counsel for the School District was unable to say whether a \ngender marker change or receiving hormones would be enough for the School District to change \nits decision regarding A.C. using the boys' restrooms.  Instead, counsel was only able to say that \nhe thought it would have \"significant impact\" on the decision. \n \n3 The Court perceives that the School District is aware of the controlling nature of Whitaker given that at oral argument \ncounsel for the School District admitted that this Court \"isn't in a position to overrule Whitaker\" and made clear that \nthe arguments were being presented \"for the purposes of our record . . . if this did go up on appeal.\"  \n11 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-TAB   Document 50   Filed 04/29/22   Page 12 of 16 PageID #: 594\n  Given the evidence before this Court and the controlling precedent from the Seventh \nCircuit, the Court finds that A.C. has established a likelihood of success on the merits of both his \nTitle IX and Equal Protection claims. \nB.  Irreparable Harm, Inadequate Remedy at Law, and Balance of Harms \n  As  argued  by  A.C.,  it  is  well-established  that  the  denial  of  constitutional  rights  is \nirreparable harm in and of itself.  (Filing No. 30 at 29.)  Based on a violation of his equal-protection \nrights, A.C. contends that he has established irreparable harm.  Id. at 30.  Additionally, A.C. asserts \nthat he has established that the School District 's actions caused him ongoing emotional harm and \ndistress, for which there is no adequate remedy at law.  Id. \n  A.C. also argues that because he has established a substantial likelihood of success on the \nmerits, \"no substantial harm to others can be said to inhere\" from the issuance of an injunction.  Id. \nat 32 (citing Déjà vu of Nashville, Inc. v. Metro. Gov't of Nashville, 274 F.3d 377, 400 (6th Cir. \n2001)). An injunction will only force the School District to conform its conduct to the requirements \nof the Constitution and federal law, which cannot be harmful to the School District.  Id. \n  In response, the School District argues that the balance of harms weighs against A.C.'s \nrequest to have access to the boys' restrooms.  (Filing No. 35 at 22.)  The School District notes that \nit has made accommodations to allow A.C. more time to use the restroom, and the fact that he may \noccasionally be late to class is not evidence of irreparable harm.  Id.  The School District disputes  \nthat A.C. has been ostracized for the use of the clinic's restroom, and points out that unlike the \nsingle restroom accessible for Whitaker which invited more scrutiny and attention from peers, the \nclinic restroom is available for use by all students with permission from the school nurse.  Id. It \nargues Concerning A.C.'s expert, the School District asserts that Dr. Fortenberry, \nhas not participated in the care of A.C., has not had any direct discussion with A.C. \nor M.C., has not performed any individualized assessment as to the severity of harm \n12 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-TAB   Document 50   Filed 04/29/22   Page 13 of 16 PageID #: 595\nthat A.C. will experience if not allowed to access the boys' restroom, and has not \nperformed an individualized assessment of the reduction of harm if A.C. is allowed \naccess to the boys' restroom. \n \nId.  Finally, the School District argues the balance of harms analysis favors maintaining the status \nquo.  Id. at 23.  Granting \"unrestricted access\" to A.C. to use the boys' restrooms would violate the \nprivacy interests of other students and classmates, as well as cause the School District to be unable \nto rely on Title IX's regulations.  Id. \n  The Court is not persuaded by the School Districts arguments. Although any student may \nuse the restroom in the clinic, in order to do so the student (including A.C.) must enter the health \nclinic, ask permission from the school nurse and then sign in before they may use that restroom.  \nThis process appears to invite scrutiny and attention. In support of his Motion, A.C. provided a \ndeclaration in which he described feeling stigmatized and that being excluded from the boys' \nrestrooms \"worsens the anxiety and depression\" caused by his gender dysphoria and makes him \nfeel isolated.  (Filing No. 29-3 at 5.)  He affirms that the School District's decision \"makes being \nat school painful.\"  Id.  A.C.'s mother also reported that the issues with the restroom have been \nemotionally harmful to A.C. and that she is concerned for the possible medical risks associated \nwith him trying not to use the restroom during school.  (Filing No. 29-2 at 6.)  Like other courts \nrecognizing the potential harm to transgender students, this Court finds no reason to question the \ncredibility of A.C.'s account and that the negative emotional consequences with being refused \naccess  to  the  boys'  restrooms  constitute  irreparable  harm  that  would  be  \"difficult—if  not \nimpossible—to reverse.\"  J.A.W. v. Evansville Vanderburgh Sch. Corp., 323 F. Supp. 3d 1030, \n1039 (S.D. Ind. 2018) (quoting Michigan v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 667 F.3d 765, 788 (7th \nCir. 2011).  Likewise, a presumption of irreparable harm exists for some constitutional violations. \nSee Ezell v. City of Chicago, 651 F.3d 684, 699 (7th Cir. 2011). \n13 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-TAB   Document 50   Filed 04/29/22   Page 14 of 16 PageID #: 596\n  Additionally, the Court finds that there is no adequate remedy at law to compensate A.C. \nfor the harm he could continue to experience.  While monetary damages may be adequate in the \ncase of tort actions, the emotional harm identified by A.C. could not be \"fully rectified by an award \nof money damages.\"  J.A.W., 323 F. Supp. 3d at 1039-40; see also Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1054.  \n  Finally, the Court must evaluate the balance of harms to each party. While A.C. has \nprovided evidence of the harm he will likely suffer, the School District's alleged potential harm is \nunsupported.  No student has complained concerning their privacy.  The School District's concerns \nwith the privacy of other students appears entirely conjectural.  No evidence was provided to \nsupport the School District's concerns, and other courts dealing with similar defenses have also \ndismissed them as unfounded. See Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1052; J.A.W., 323 F. Supp. 3d at 1041. \nMoreover, the School District's concerns over privacy are undermined given that it has already \ngranted permission for other transgender students to use the restroom of their identified gender, \nand it has presented no evidence of problems when the other transgender student have used \nrestrooms consistent with their gender identity.  \n  Because A.C. has demonstrated that he will likely suffer irreparable harm, and the School \nDistrict has failed to support its claims of prospective harm, the Court finds that the balance weighs \nin favor of granting A.C.'s request.  \nC.  Public Interest \n  Finally, A.C. argues that \"[t]he public interest is also furthered by the injunction here, as \nan injunction in favor of constitutional rights and the rights secured by Title IX is always in the \npublic interest. (Filing No. 30 at 33.) In response, the School District argues that public policy \nweighs in its favor.  Based on its assertion that Title IX favors the separation of facilities, the \nSchool District contends that its policy furthers the interest of personal privacy. (Filing No. 35 at \n14 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-TAB   Document 50   Filed 04/29/22   Page 15 of 16 PageID #: 597\n24.) The School District argues \"[t]o the extent that Title IX should not allow the separation of \nsuch facilities, that decision should be made through elected representatives in Congress, using \nclearly understood text, or through the notice and comment process for the revision of federal \nregulations required by the Administrative Procedure Act.\"  Id. \n  While acknowledging that the public interest favors furthering individual privacy interests, \nthe Court does not believe that granting A.C. access to the boys' restrooms threatens those interests. \nThe restrooms at the middle school have stalls and as argues by A.C.'s counsel, restrooms are an \narea where people are usually private which minimizes exposure of a student's body to the opposite \nsex.  Since he was eight years old, A.C. has identified as male, and has dressed as a boy and had a \nboy haircut. He is under a physician's care, has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, and has \nbeen granted a legal name.  The School District's arguments regarding its facilities again confuses \nthe basis of A.C.'s claim, which is solely based on the School District's treatment of him as an \nindividual.  Having determined that granting A.C.'s Motion is in the public interest, as well as A.C. \nestablishing the other required factors, the Court finds that A.C.'s requested preliminary injunction \nshould be granted.  \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n  The overwhelming majority of federal courts˗˗including the Court of Appeals for the \nSeventh Circuit˗˗ have recently examined transgender education-discrimination claims under Title \nIX and concluded that preventing a transgender student from using a school restroom consistent \nwith the student’s gender identity violates Title IX.  This Court concurs.  For the reasons stated \nabove, A.C.'s Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Filing No. 9) is GRANTED.  The School District \nshall permit A.C. to use any boys' restroom within John R. Wooden Middle School.  \n  SO ORDERED. \n \n15 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-TAB   Document 50   Filed 04/29/22   Page 16 of 16 PageID #: 598\nDate:   4/29/2022 \n \n \nDISTRIBUTION: \n \nKenneth J.

A.C., B.E., and S.E. are three boys \nwith a simple request: they want to use the boys’ bathrooms \nat their schools. But because the three boys are transgender, \nthe districts said no. The boys sued the districts and the school \nprincipals, alleging sex discrimination in violation of Title IX \nof the Education Amendments Act of 1972 and the Equal Pro-\ntection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The boys also \nrequested  preliminary  injunctions  that  would  order  the \nschools to grant them access to the boys’ bathrooms and, in \nthe case of B.E. and S.E., access to the boys’ locker rooms when \nchanging  for  gym  class.  The  district  courts  in  both  cases \ngranted the preliminary injunctions, relying on our decision \nin Whitaker ex rel. Whitaker v. Kenosha Uniﬁed School District No. \n1 Board of Education, 858 F.3d 1034 (7th Cir. 2017). \nIn this consolidated appeal, the school districts invite us to \nreverse those preliminary injunctions and revisit our holding \nin Whitaker. We see no reason to do so, however. Litigation \nover transgender rights is occurring all over the country, and \nwe assume that at some point the Supreme Court will step in \nwith more guidance than it has furnished so far. Until then, \nwe will stay the course and follow Whitaker. That is just what \n\nCase: 22-1786      Document: 116            Filed: 08/01/2023      Pages: 26\nNos. 22-1786 & 22-2318  3 \nthe district courts did, in crafting narrowly tailored and fact-\nbound injunctions. We aﬃrm their orders.  \nI \nA. A.C.’s Case \nA.C. is a 13-year-old boy who lives with his mother M.C. \nin Martinsville, Indiana. A.C. is transgender and has identi-\nﬁed as a boy since he was about eight years old. He socially \ntransitioned when he was nine, meaning he began going by a \nmale name, using male pronouns, and adopting a typically \nmasculine haircut and clothing. He has never wavered from \nthis identity since his social transition. \nA.C. receives professional medical care from the Gender \nHealth Program at Riley Children’s Health, where he was di-\nagnosed with gender dysphoria, a condition that causes him \nto experience “a marked incongruence between [his] experi-\nenced/expressed gender and [his] assigned gender.” Ameri-\ncan Psychiatric Ass’n, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 452 \n(5th ed. 2013). A.C.’s gender dysphoria comes with “signiﬁ-\ncant distress, depression, and anxiety.” He receives therapy \nas well as prescribed hormonal suppression drugs that block \nhis menstruation. He intends to begin testosterone supple-\nments, which will further masculinize his appearance, once \nhe is able. Additionally, the Indiana courts have authorized \nboth a legal name change and a gender-marker change for \nhim. A.C. and his medical care providers agree that being \ntreated as a boy is the best way to ameliorate his depression \nand anxiety. This includes access to bathrooms and facilities \nthat are consistent with his experienced gender identity. We \nrefer to this as gender-aﬃrming facility access.  \n\nCase: 22-1786      Document: 116            Filed: 08/01/2023      Pages: 26\n4  Nos. 22-1786 & 22-2318 \nIn 2021 A.C. began seventh grade at John R. Wooden Mid-\ndle School in the Metropolitan School District of Martinsville, \nIndiana. The school maintains sex-segregated bathrooms—a \npractice that A.C. does not challenge. At the beginning of the \nschool year A.C.’s stepfather contacted the school to ask that \nA.C.  be  granted  gender-aﬃrming  bathroom  access.  The \nschool refused and said that A.C. had to use either the girls’ \nbathrooms or the unisex bathroom in the health clinic. But \nA.C. could not use the girls’ bathrooms because it exacerbated \nhis dysphoria and exposed him as transgender to his class-\nmates. The health clinic bathroom was unsatisfactory because \nit was far from A.C.’s classes and stigmatized him. A.C. had \nto ask permission and sign into the health oﬃce each time he \nused it.  \nMartinsville did accommodate A.C. by refraining from \npunishing him for tardiness caused by his use of the health \nclinic  bathroom.  It  also  oﬀered A.C.  the  option  to  attend \nschool entirely online, but A.C. declined. For a time, A.C. de-\nﬁed the school’s orders and used the boys’ bathrooms. He im-\nmediately felt more comfortable at school and better about \nhimself. No students raised any issues or questioned A.C.’s \npresence, but a staﬀ member reported him. The school re-\nsponded by telling A.C. that he would be disciplined if he \ncontinued using the boys’ bathrooms.  \nA.C. felt isolated and punished by the school because of \nhis  transgender  status.  This  aﬀected  his  academic  perfor-\nmance. Before middle school, A.C. earned good grades and \nwas in the gifted and talented program. At Wooden, he found \nit diﬃcult to attend school. His education was disrupted, his \ngrades fell, and he became depressed, humiliated, and angry. \n\nCase: 22-1786      Document: 116            Filed: 08/01/2023      Pages: 26\nNos. 22-1786 & 22-2318  5 \nHe tried to avoid using the bathroom while at school, which \nwas distracting, uncomfortable, and medically dangerous.  \nMartinsville has an unoﬃcial policy for handling gender-\naﬃrming bathroom access for transgender students at the \nhigh school level. The district evaluates each bathroom-access \nrequest based on an extensive list of factors: the length of time \nthe student has identiﬁed as transgender; whether the student \nis under a physician’s care; whether the student has been di-\nagnosed with gender dysphoria; whether the student receives \nhormone treatment; and whether the student has received a \nlegal name change or gender-marker change. A.C. attempted \nto show the school district that he qualiﬁed for an accommo-\ndation based on these criteria, but Martinsville said the policy \ncould not be implemented in the district’s middle schools and \nrefused to change its position.  \nIn December 2021, A.C. ﬁled this lawsuit against Martins-\nville and Fred Kutruﬀ, Wooden’s principal, seeking declara-\ntory and injunctive relief that would assure his access to gen-\nder-aﬃrming bathrooms. On April 29, 2022, the district court \ngranted A.C.’s motion for a preliminary injunction and issued \nthe mandatory stand-alone order on May 19, 2022. See Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 65(d). The injunction prohibited Martinsville from \n“stopping, preventing, or in any way interfering with A.C. \nfreely using any boys’ restroom.” \nB. B.E. & S.E.’s Cases \nB.E.  and  S.E.  are  15-year-old  twins  who  live  in  Terre \nHaute, Indiana, with their mother L.E. They attend Terre \nHaute North Vigo High School. They are transgender boys \nwho socially transitioned at age 11, when they adopted male \nnames,  male  pronouns,  and  traditionally  masculine \n\nCase: 22-1786      Document: 116            Filed: 08/01/2023      Pages: 26\n6  Nos. 22-1786 & 22-2318 \nappearances. Like A.C., both B.E. and S.E. were diagnosed \nwith gender dysphoria and are receiving professional care at \nthe Riley Gender Health Clinic. Under the Clinic’s supervi-\nsion, the boys have received testosterone treatment since No-\nvember 2021. This treatment causes the cessation of menstru-\nation and the development of deeper voices, facial and body \nhair growth, and increased muscle mass. B.E. and S.E. ob-\ntained legal name changes and gender-marker changes in In-\ndiana state court. Unrelated to their gender identity, both B.E. \nand S.E. have a condition that impedes colon function and re-\nquires them to take laxatives, making bathroom access a par-\nticularly sensitive issue. \nThe twins used the boys’ bathrooms at North Vigo at the \nbeginning of the 2021–2022 school year; no students raised \nconcerns about their presence there. School employees, how-\never, informally reprimanded B.E. and S.E. and told them not \nto use the boys’ bathrooms again. Their mother had a meeting \nwith the vice principal to alert the school to both the gender \ndysphoria diagnoses and the colon conditions of the two \nboys. She requested that they be granted gender-aﬃrming fa-\ncility access, including access to the boys’ locker rooms to \nchange before and after gym class. B.E. and S.E. conﬁrmed \nthat they planned to use the stalls in the locker room to change \nin privacy and did not seek access to the locker room showers. \nThe school denied their request; it instructed them to use ei-\nther  the  girls’  bathrooms  or  the  unisex  bathroom  in  the \nschool’s health oﬃce. They could change for gym class only \nin the girls’ locker room or the health oﬃce bathroom. \nB.E. and S.E. found this solution profoundly upsetting. Us-\ning the girls’ bathrooms and locker rooms revealed them as \ntransgender,  and  they  worried  about  upsetting  female \n\nCase: 22-1786      Document: 116            Filed: 08/01/2023      Pages: 26\nNos. 22-1786 & 22-2318  7 \nstudents who might wonder why boys were in those facilities. \nB.E. and S.E. also had problems with the unisex bathroom. It \nwas  far  from  their  classrooms,  and  the  health  oﬃce  was \nlocked at unpredictable times. B.E. suﬀered at least one em-\nbarrassing accident because of his colon condition and inabil-\nity to get to the health oﬃce bathroom on time. Both boys \nmissed time in class because they had to use a remote bath-\nroom, and they felt stigmatized by the requirement. As a re-\nsult, they tried to avoid using the bathroom while at school—\nagain, a practice that is painful, distracting, and medically \ndangerous. They dreaded going to school and suﬀered de-\npression and humiliation.   \nVigo County has an oﬃcial policy regarding bathroom ac-\ncess for transgender students. It contemplates accommodat-\ning transgender students based on a smorgasbord of factors, \nincluding: the student’s age; the gender marker on the birth \ncertiﬁcate; the duration of the social transition; whether the \nstudent has name and pronoun change requests on ﬁle with \nthe School Corporation; the student’s gender dysphoria diag-\nnosis; the receipt of hormone treatment; the duration of hor-\nmone treatment; the receipt of other transition-related medi-\ncal procedures; other medical conditions; concerns raised by \nother students or parents; facility restrictions; and accommo-\ndations oﬀered to other similarly situated students. At the \nsame time, North Vigo insisted that surgical change was re-\nquired before a transgender student could use gender-aﬃrm-\ning bathrooms. That rule rendered most of the policy nuga-\ntory—Indiana prohibits such surgery for patients younger \nthan 18 (the great majority of high school students), and some \ntransgender persons opt not to undergo surgical transition \ngiven the risks and costs of the procedure. See Whitaker, 858 \nF.3d at 1041. \n\nCase: 22-1786      Document: 116            Filed: 08/01/2023      Pages: 26\n8  Nos. 22-1786 & 22-2318 \nAfter North Vigo refused to grant B.E. and S.E. gender-af-\nﬁrming facility access, the boys ﬁled this lawsuit against Vigo \nCounty School Corporation and the principal of the high \nschool. On June 24, 2022, the district court granted their mo-\ntion for a preliminary injunction and issued a stand-alone or-\nder compelling the school district to provide B.E. and S.E. \n“with access to the boys’ restrooms and locker room, exclud-\ning the showers.” The district court rested its decision on their \nlikelihood of success under Title IX; it did not reach their con-\nstitutional theory.  \nBoth Martinsville and Vigo County appealed the issuance \nof the preliminary injunctions. At the request of the parties, \nwe consolidated the cases on appeal.  \nII \nFor a preliminary injunction to issue, a plaintiﬀ “must es-\ntablish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is \nlikely to suﬀer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary \nrelief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an \ninjunction is in the public interest.” Winter v. Natural Resources \nDefense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). Orders granting or \ndenying preliminary injunctive relief are immediately appeal-\nable. 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). Our review depends on the kind \nof issue we are considering: “[w]e review the district court’s \nﬁndings of fact for clear error, its legal conclusions de novo, \nand its balancing of the factors for a preliminary injunction \nfor abuse of discretion.” Doe v. University of Southern Indiana, \n43 F.4th 784, 791 (7th Cir. 2022) (alteration in original) (quot-\ning D.U. v. Rhoades, 825 F.3d 331, 335 (7th Cir. 2016)). \n\nCase: 22-1786      Document: 116            Filed: 08/01/2023      Pages: 26\nNos. 22-1786 & 22-2318  9 \nA. Whitaker and Bostock \nWe begin by addressing the appellants’ contention that \nour decision in Whitaker is no longer authoritative, given a \nchange in the law governing preliminary injunctions or, in the \nalternative, given the Supreme Court’s intervening decision \nin Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020). \nThe  plaintiﬀ  in  Whitaker  (A.W.)  was  a  17-year-old \ntransgender boy who sued the Kenosha (Wisconsin) Uniﬁed \nSchool District, alleging that the refusal to allow him to use \nthe boys’ bathrooms violated his rights under Title IX and the \nFourteenth Amendment. Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1042. A.W. so-\ncially transitioned when he was 13 and received professional \ncare for gender dysphoria. When he sought gender-aﬃrming \nfacility access, however, he was told that he could use only the \ngirls’ bathrooms or a unisex bathroom in the school’s main \noﬃce, which was far from his classes. He felt that using the \nremote unisex bathroom drew undesirable attention to his \ntransgender status. Id. at 1040. \nLike the plaintiﬀs in our cases, A.W. attempted to restrict \nhis water intake in order to avoid any bathroom use. This ex-\nacerbated a preexisting medical condition—vasovagal syn-\ncope—making him susceptible to headaches, fainting, and \nseizures. He tried ignoring the school’s orders and using the \nboys’ bathrooms. Again as in the present case, no students \ncomplained but school employees did. He sought an accom-\nmodation with evidence of his prolonged social transition, his \ngender dysphoria diagnosis, and his doctor’s recommenda-\ntion that he be allowed to use gender-aﬃrming facilities, but \nto no avail. The school district insisted that A.W. had to up-\ndate his gender in the school’s records, which the school \nwould do only if he provided an amended birth certiﬁcate. \n\nCase: 22-1786      Document: 116            Filed: 08/01/2023      Pages: 26\n10  Nos. 22-1786 & 22-2318 \nThis put him up against a brick wall: under Wisconsin law, \nthe records would not be changed without surgical transition, \nbut those procedures are unavailable to minors, risky, and ex-\npensive. A.W. reported feeling distressed, depressed, and su-\nicidal as a result. See id. at 1041–42, 1053. \nWe  held  that  A.W.’s  worsening  mental  and  physical \nhealth, coupled with his suicidality, meant that the harm was \nirreparable and could not be adequately remedied at law. Id. \nat 1045–46. We added that since this was not a “typical tort \naction” about past harm, but instead a case where the harms \nwere  prospective  and  ongoing,  that  monetary  damages \nwould be insuﬃcient. Id. at 1046. We concluded that A.W. had \ndemonstrated a likelihood of success on both his Title IX and \nFourteenth Amendment claims. Notably, we did not criticize \nthe defendant school district’s decision to maintain sex-segre-\ngated bathrooms. Our focus was on the district’s policy for \n“decid[ing] which bathroom a student may use.” Id. at 1051.  \nFor the Title IX claim, we were guided by analogy to Price \nWaterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228 (1989), and its holding that \ndiscrimination based on sex-stereotyping violates Title VII of \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964. Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1047. We \nreasoned that “[a] policy that requires an individual to use a \nbathroom that does not conform with his or her gender iden-\ntity punishes that individual for his or her gender non-con-\nformance, which in turn violates Title IX.” Id. at 1049. \nFor A.W.’s Fourteenth Amendment claim, we applied in-\ntermediate scrutiny to the defendant school district’s bath-\nroom access policy, because it was “based upon a sex classiﬁ-\ncation.” Id. at 1051. We therefore required the defendants to \nprovide an “exceedingly persuasive” justiﬁcation for their \npolicy. Id. at 1051–52 (quoting United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. \n\nCase: 22-1786      Document: 116            Filed: 08/01/2023      Pages: 26\nNos. 22-1786 & 22-2318  11 \n515, 533 (1996)). The proﬀered justiﬁcation the school gave \nwas the need “to protect the privacy rights of all 22,160 stu-\ndents.” Id. at 1052. We found this unconvincing (more or less \nthe opposite of “exceedingly persuasive”) because there was \nno evidence that A.W. was less discreet than other students \nwhile using the bathroom or that the stall doors in the bath-\nrooms did not provide adequate privacy to all. Id.  \nFinally, we aﬃrmed the district court’s balancing of the \nharms. The school district’s claims of harm were “specula-\ntive,” especially because, prior to the lawsuit, A.W. had used \nthe boys’ bathrooms for almost six months without incident. \nThis supported a ﬁnding that the district court did not abuse \nits discretion by ﬁnding that the privacy rights of other stu-\ndents were not invaded and that no other negative conse-\nquences materialized. Id. at 1054.  \nWhitaker answers almost all the questions raised by these \nconsolidated appeals. But the school districts oﬀer three rea-\nsons why we ought to revisit that decision. First, they urge \nthat  Whitaker was partially abrogated by Illinois Republican \nParty v. Pritzker, 973 F.3d 760 (7th Cir. 2020). Second, they \npoint out that the Supreme Court has provided intervening \nguidance on how to analyze issues of transgender discrimina-\ntion in Bostock. Third, they contend that Whitaker did not ade-\nquately grapple with a provision in Title IX that permits edu-\ncational institutions to “maintain[] separate living facilities \nfor the diﬀerent sexes.” 20 U.S.C. § 1686. We address those ar-\nguments in turn. \n1.  Standard for Likelihood of Success on Merits  \nIn Whitaker, we applied the now-abrogated standard for \nevaluating  the  likelihood  of  success  on  the  merits  under \n\nCase: 22-1786      Document: 116            Filed: 08/01/2023      Pages: 26\n12  Nos. 22-1786 & 22-2318 \nwhich a plaintiﬀ had to show only that he had a “better than \nnegligible” chance of success on the merits. 858 F.3d at 1046. \nThat standard is now gone. In Nken v. Holder, in the closely \nrelated context of a stay pending judicial review, the Supreme \nCourt went out of its way to say that “[i]t is not enough that \nthe chance of success on the merits be (cid:31)better than negligible.’” \n556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009). Adhering to that guidance in Illinois \nRepublican Party, we concluded that the showing must be a \nstrong one, though the applicant “need not show that [he] def-\ninitely will win the case.” 973 F.3d at 763. The school districts \ncontend that this shift has weakened Whitaker’s authoritative \nvalue. \nPerhaps there are some cases that have been aﬀected by \nthe need to make a more compelling showing of likelihood of \nsuccess, but Whitaker is not one of them. Whitaker did not even \nhint that the likelihood of success on the merits was a close \nissue or that anything hinged on the better-than-negligible \nthreshold. Furthermore, both district courts in the cases now \nbefore us applied the correct standard and came out the same \nway, ﬁnding that the law and the evidentiary records estab-\nlished the necessary strong likelihood of success. \n The crucial question for the Title IX theory in both of the \ncases now before us, just as in Whitaker, is one of law: how \ndoes one interpret Title IX’s prohibition against discrimina-\ntion “on the basis of sex” as applied to transgender people? In \nWhitaker,  we  answered  that  discrimination  against \ntransgender students is a form of sex discrimination. Our an-\nswer to that legal question did not depend on the plaintiﬀ’s \nevidentiary showing, and that answer does not change with a \nmore rigorous threshold for success on the merits. It is also \ntelling that, in the closely related area of Title VII law, the \n\nCase: 22-1786      Document: 116            Filed: 08/01/2023      Pages: 26\nNos. 22-1786 & 22-2318  13 \nSupreme Court held in Bostock that discrimination based on \ntransgender status is a form of sex discrimination. 140 S. Ct. \nat 1744. Both Title VII, at issue in Bostock, and Title IX, at issue \nhere and in Whitaker, involve sex stereotypes and less favora-\nble treatment because of the disfavored person’s sex. Bostock \nthus provides useful guidance here, even though the particu-\nlar application of sex discrimination it addressed was diﬀer-\nent.  \n2.  Bostock \nThough Bostock strengthens Whitaker’s conclusion that dis-\ncrimination based on transgender status is a form of sex dis-\ncrimination, the school districts argue that a diﬀerent part of \nBostock undermines Whitaker. They are referring to the Court’s \ndecision  to  refrain  from  addressing  how  “sex-segregated \nbathrooms, locker rooms, and dress codes” were aﬀected by \nits ruling. Id. at 1753. The school districts reason that the Court \nexercised this restraint because it saw a fundamental diﬀer-\nence between bathroom policies and employment decisions. \nFrom that, they conclude that Bostock’s deﬁnition of sex dis-\ncrimination does not apply in the bathroom context.  \nThat is reading quite a bit into a statement that says, in \nessence, “we aren’t reaching this point.” The Supreme Court, \nand for that matter our court, does this all the time. It is an \nimportant tool with which we respect the principles of party \npresentation, see United States v. Sineneng-Smith, 140 S. Ct. \n1575, 1579 (2020), and incremental development of the law. It \nis best to take the Court at its word. When we do so, we see \nthat it was simply focusing on “[t]he only question before \n[it],” which did not involve gender-aﬃrming bathroom ac-\ncess. Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1753. \n\nCase: 22-1786      Document: 116            Filed: 08/01/2023      Pages: 26\n14  Nos. 22-1786 & 22-2318 \nApplying Bostock’s reasoning to Title IX, we have no trou-\nble concluding that discrimination against transgender per-\nsons is sex discrimination for Title IX purposes, just as it is for \nTitle VII purposes. As Bostock instructs, we ask whether our \nthree plaintiﬀs are suﬀering negative consequences (for Title \nIX, lack of equal access to school programs) for behavior that \nis being tolerated in male students who are not transgender. \nSee id. at 1741. Our decision in Whitaker followed this ap-\nproach. \n3.  Relevance of 20 U.S.C. § 1686 \nThe last alleged ﬂaw in Whitaker that the school districts \nsee is its supposed failure to mention 20 U.S.C. § 1686. That \nstatute, which is part of Title IX, reads as follows: \nNotwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  con-\ntained in this chapter, nothing contained herein shall \nbe construed to prohibit any educational institution re-\nceiving funds under this Act, from maintaining sepa-\nrate living facilities for the diﬀerent sexes. \nIf Whitaker had failed to take that admonition into account, \nmaybe there would be a problem. But it did no such thing. \nWhitaker cited the relevant implementing regulation, 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.33, which aﬃrmatively permits recipients of educational \nfunds to “provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower fa-\ncilities” on the basis of sex, provided that the separate facili-\nties are comparable. We noted that neither Title IX nor its im-\nplementing regulations deﬁne the term “sex,” and in looking \nto case law for guidance, we saw nothing to suggest that “sex” \nreferred only to biological sex. Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1047. We \nconcluded that bathroom-access policies that engaged in sex-\n\nCase: 22-1786      Document: 116            Filed: 08/01/2023      Pages: 26\nNos. 22-1786 & 22-2318  15 \nstereotyping could violate Title IX, notwithstanding 34 C.F.R. \n§ 106.33. \nSimilarly, section 1686 is of little relevance to this appeal. \nThough it certainly permits the maintenance of sex-segre-\ngated facilities, we stress again that neither the plaintiﬀ in \nWhitaker nor the plaintiﬀs in these cases have any quarrel with \nthat rule. The question is diﬀerent: who counts as a “boy” for \nthe boys’ rooms, and who counts as a “girl” for the girls’ \nrooms—essentially, how do we sort by gender? The statute \nsays nothing on this topic, and so nothing we say here risks \nrendering section 1686 a nullity.  \nWe also reject the notion that Whitaker (and perhaps Bos-\ntock itself) make it impossible to have “truly sex-separated \nbathrooms.” That argument presupposes one deﬁnition of \nsex, as something assigned at birth or a function of chromo-\nsomal make-up. But Title IX does not deﬁne sex. Dictionary \ndeﬁnitions from around 1972 (when Title IX was passed) are \nequally inconclusive. See, e.g., Black’s Law Dictionary, Sex \n(4th ed. 1968) (deﬁning sex narrowly as “[t]he sum of the pe-\nculiarities of structure and function that distinguish a male \nfrom a female organism” and broadly as “the character of be-\ning male or female”); Webster’s New World Dictionary, Sex \n(2d ed. 1972) (deﬁning sex both “with reference to … repro-\nductive functions” and broadly as “all the attributes by which \nmales and females are distinguished”). There is insuﬃcient \nevidence to support the assumption that sex can mean only \nbiological sex. And there is less certainty than meets the eye \nin such a deﬁnition: what, for instance, should we do about \nsomeone who is intersex? There are several conditions that \ncreate discrepancies between external and internal sex mark-\ners, which can produce XX males or XY females, or other \n\nCase: 22-1786      Document: 116            Filed: 08/01/2023      Pages: 26\n16  Nos. 22-1786 & 22-2318 \nchromosomal combinations such as XXY or XXX that aﬀect \noverall sexual development. People with this genetic make-\nup are entitled to Title IX’s protections, and an educational \ninstitution’s policy for facility access would fail to account for \nthem if biological sex were the only permissible sorting mech-\nanism. Narrow deﬁnitions of sex do not account for the com-\nplexity of the necessary inquiry. \nThe implementing regulations do not provide much addi-\ntional guidance. When 34 C.F.R. § 106.33 was codiﬁed, it was \npublished without public comment because it was viewed as \nworking “no substantive changes.” Department of Education, \nEstablishment of Title 34, 45 Fed. Reg. 30802, 30802 (May 9, \n1980). With no indication that 34 C.F.R. § 106.33 was meant to \ncover any more ground than 20 U.S.C. § 1686, we reject the \nschool districts’ presupposition that separate facilities for the \nsexes  forecloses  access  policies  based  on  gender  identity. \nNothing in section 1686 requires this outcome.  \n4.  Existing Circuit Split \nFinally, there is already a circuit split on the issues raised \nin this appeal. The Fourth Circuit has decided that denying \ngender-aﬃrming bathroom access can violate both Title IX \nand the Equal Protection Clause, while the Eleventh Circuit \nfound no violations based on substantially similar facts. Com-\npare Grimm v. Gloucester County School Board, 972 F.3d 586 (4th \nCir. 2020), with Adams ex rel. Kasper v. School Board of St. Johns \nCounty, 57 F.4th 791 (11th Cir. 2022) (en banc).  \nIt makes little sense for us to jump from one side of the \ncircuit split to the other, particularly in light of the intervening \nguidance in Bostock. As we have noted before:   \n\nCase: 22-1786      Document: 116            Filed: 08/01/2023      Pages: 26\nNos. 22-1786 & 22-2318  17 \nOverruling circuit law can be beneﬁcial when the cir-\ncuit is an outlier and can save work for Congress and \nthe  Supreme  Court  by  eliminating  a  conﬂict.  Even \nwhen an overruling does not end the conﬂict, it might \nsupply a new line of argument that would lead other \ncircuits to change their positions in turn. Finally, over-\nruling is more appropriate when prevailing doctrine \nworks a substantial injury. \nBuchmeier v. United States, 581 F.3d 561, 566 (7th Cir. 2009) (en \nbanc). \nThese factors do not weigh in favor of overruling Whitaker. \nWe cannot resolve the conﬂict between the Fourth and Elev-\nenth Circuits on our own. Nor can we supply a new line of \nargument. Much of what is needed to resolve this conﬂict is \npresent in the majority opinion and four dissents oﬀered by \nthe Eleventh Circuit in Adams; neither party here has broken \nnew ground. Finally, consistency on our part does not cause \na serious harm. Whitaker has been the governing decision in \nour circuit since 2017, and the school districts have not iden-\ntiﬁed  any  substantial  injuries  it  has  caused.  As  a  result, \n“[o]verruling would not be consistent with a proper regard \nfor the stability of our decisions.” Id. at 565. \nB.  Preliminary Injunctions \nHaving resolved the question of Whitaker’s authoritative \nvalue, we are now free to apply it to these cases. We address \nthe factors governing a preliminary injunction—likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits, irreparable harm, and the balance of eq-\nuities, including the public interest—in that order.  \n\nCase: 22-1786      Document: 116            Filed: 08/01/2023      Pages: 26\n18  Nos. 22-1786 & 22-2318 \n1.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits  \nThe ﬁrst, and normally the most important, criterion is \nlikelihood of success on the merits. As we noted earlier, the \nplaintiﬀs had to make a strong showing of their chance of pre-\nvailing. See Illinois Republican Party, 973 F.3d at 763. For the \nTitle IX claims, they had to demonstrate that they were “sub-\njected to discrimination under any education program or ac-\ntivity receiving Federal ﬁnancial assistance,” and that this dis-\ncriminatory treatment was “on the basis of sex.” 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1681(a). For the Equal Protection Clause (involved in only \nA.C.’s case), they had to show intentional discrimination on \nthe basis of sex. See J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B., 511 U.S. 127, \n130–31 (1994). \nIt is not disputed that Wooden Middle School and North \nVigo High School receive federal funding and are covered by \nTitle IX. The point of contention is whether the school dis-\ntricts’ refusal to grant gender-aﬃrming facility access to the \nplaintiﬀs amounts to discrimination on the basis of sex. Both \ndistrict courts decided that the plaintiﬀs had made a suﬃ-\nciently strong showing of sex discrimination. We see no errors \nin those conclusions. \nUsing Whitaker as a guide, both district courts evaluated \nthe school districts’ facility access policies, not their decisions \nto  maintain  sex-segregated  facilities.  The  courts  then  rea-\nsoned that an access policy that punished a student for their \ntransgender identity would violate Title IX, see Whitaker, 858 \nF.3d at 1049, and that A.C., B.E., and S.E. all showed they were \npunished  by  the  school  districts’  access  policies.  Like  the \nplaintiﬀ in Whitaker, they were threatened with discipline if \nthey used the boys’ bathrooms. All three reported feeling de-\npressed, humiliated, and excluded by the requirement to use \n\nCase: 22-1786      Document: 116            Filed: 08/01/2023      Pages: 26\nNos. 22-1786 & 22-2318  19 \neither the girls’ bathrooms or the unisex bathroom. B.E. and \nS.E. were also placed at an increased risk of not making it to \nthe bathroom on time because of their colon conditions. As a \nresult, just as in Whitaker, the “gender-neutral alternatives \nwere not true alternatives because of their distant location to \n[plaintiﬀs’] classrooms and the increased stigmatization they \ncaused [plaintiﬀs].” Id. at 1050. And in A.C.’s case, oﬀering re-\nmote schooling and therefore denying a transgender student \nthe  opportunity  to  socialize  with  and  learn  alongside  his \nclassmates is not a true alternative. Further, the harms that the \nplaintiﬀs suﬀered meet Bostock’s deﬁnition of sex discrimina-\ntion, which requires that the plaintiﬀ be treated worse than a \nsimilarly situated person because of sex. 140 S. Ct. at 1740. \nHere, the school districts persisted in treating the three plain-\ntiﬀs worse than other boys because of their transgender sta-\ntus. \nThe plaintiﬀs in B.E./S.E. asked the district court to include \naccess to both bathrooms and locker rooms in the injunction, \nand the court obliged. It reasoned that the “distinction” be-\ntween bathrooms and locker rooms was “immaterial,” partic-\nularly since B.E. and S.E. “would use the stalls in the locker \nroom, just as they used the stalls in the restroom,” and com-\nmunal showers were by consent carved out of the injunction. \nWe see no clear error in the district court’s factual conclusion \nthat B.E.’s and S.E.’s locker room use would be comparable to \ntheir bathroom use. Vigo County argues that nothing in the \ndistrict court’s injunction conﬁnes the plaintiﬀs to the stalls, \nand so (it believes) B.E. and S.E. “may change in the open ar-\neas of the locker room, exposing their physical anatomy to \ntheir classmates, and vice versa.” But this argument is unteth-\nered to the evidentiary record. Both B.E. and S.E. averred that \nthe stalls in the locker room would allow them and other \n\nCase: 22-1786      Document: 116            Filed: 08/01/2023      Pages: 26\n20  Nos. 22-1786 & 22-2318 \nstudents to change privately, and that students do not disrobe \nentirely or use the locker room showers during the school \nday. As a result, the district court’s conclusion that locker \nroom use would be indistinguishable from bathroom use in \nthis instance is not clearly erroneous.  \nThe district court in A.C.’s case also decided that A.C. had \nmade a strong showing of likely success on his Fourteenth \nAmendment claim. Per Whitaker’s guidance, Martinsville’s ac-\ncess policy relies on sex-based classiﬁcations and is therefore \nsubject to heightened scrutiny. 858 F.3d at 1051. “[A] party \nseeking to uphold government action based on sex must es-\ntablish an (cid:31)exceedingly persuasive justiﬁcation’ for the classi-\nﬁcation.” Virginia, 518 U.S. at 524 (quoting Mississippi Univer-\nsity for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 724 (1982)). “The justiﬁ-\ncation must be genuine, not hypothesized or invented post hoc \nin response to litigation.” Id. at 516.  \nThe school district attempted to justify its access policy by \ninvoking the privacy concerns of other students. The district \ncourt found, however, that the privacy concerns “appear[] en-\ntirely conjectural.” See also Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1052 (“[T]he \nSchool District’s privacy argument is based upon sheer con-\njecture  and  abstraction.”).  No  students  complained  about \nA.C.’s use of the bathroom. Martinsville insists that such evi-\ndence is unnecessary and that the privacy interest in protect-\ning students from “exposure of their bodies to the opposite \nsex” is long-protected, legitimate, and clearly related to deny-\ning gender-aﬃrming facility access. But the district is ﬁghting \na phantom. Gender-aﬃrming facility access does not impli-\ncate the interest in preventing bodily exposure, because there \nis no such exposure. This is unlike the nudity ordinance that \nwe contemplated in Tagami v. City of Chicago, 875 F.3d 375 (7th \n\nCase: 22-1786      Document: 116            Filed: 08/01/2023      Pages: 26\nNos. 22-1786 & 22-2318  21 \nCir. 2017), where bodily exposure was expressly and directly \nat issue. There is no evidence that any students will be ex-\nposed to A.C. or vice versa. “Common sense tells us that the \ncommunal restroom is a place where individuals act in a dis-\ncreet manner to protect their privacy and those who have true \nprivacy concerns are able to utilize a stall.” Whitaker, 858 F.3d \nat 1052. Martinsville has not identiﬁed how A.C.’s presence \nbehind the door of a bathroom stall threatens student privacy. \nIn addition to the likelihood of success on the Title IX and \nequal protection claims, we note also that the school districts \nin these two cases may be violating Indiana law. Given that \nall three plaintiﬀs have received amended birth certiﬁcates \nand legal name changes that identify them as boys, they ap-\npear to be boys in the eyes of the State of Indiana. If so, then \nit would be contrary to Indiana law for the school districts to \ntreat A.C., B.E., and S.E. as though they are not boys and to \nrequire them to use the girls’ bathrooms and locker rooms. \nBut no plaintiﬀ has pursued this theory of state-law violation, \nand so we do not explore it further.  \nWe add a few words about the scope of our decision. First, \nwe are addressing only the issue before us. We express no \nopinion on how Title IX or the Equal Protection Clause regu-\nlates other sex-segregated living facilities, educational pro-\ngrams, or sports teams. The district courts took the same ap-\nproach in the injunctions they issued, properly conﬁning their \nanalysis to the immediate problem.  \nWe also leave the door open to reasonable measures taken \nby the school districts to ensure that a student genuinely \nneeds the requested accommodations. Just like the plaintiﬀ in \nWhitaker, A.C., B.E., and S.E. have all provided ample evi-\ndence of their medical diagnoses and the care they receive \n\nCase: 22-1786      Document: 116            Filed: 08/01/2023      Pages: 26\n22  Nos. 22-1786 & 22-2318 \nfrom professionals to assist in their transitions. They have also \ndemonstrated that their gender identities are enduring. All \nthree have legal name changes and gender-marker changes. \nB.E. and S.E. have been receiving testosterone treatment for \nover a year. These are not cases where the plaintiﬀs’ good-\nfaith requests for gender-aﬃrming facility access could be \nquestioned. Nor do these cases present the scenario oﬀered \nby Indiana and other states in their amicus brief, where only \nsubjective “self-identiﬁcation” is oﬀered as the basis for the \nplaintiﬀs’ requests. \nFurther, nothing in the district courts’ injunctions restricts \na school district’s ability to monitor student conduct in bath-\nrooms and locker rooms. If a student enters a girls’ locker \nroom and engages in misconduct, that student has violated \nschool rules regardless of whether the student is a girl who is \nproperly in the space, a boy who is improperly in the space, \nor a boy who pretends to be a transgender girl to gain school-\nauthorized access to the space. As the amicus brief of school \nadministrators from 16 states and the District of Columbia as-\nsures us, “schools generally are adept at disciplining students \nfor infractions of school rules,” and gender-aﬃrming access \npolicies neither thwart rule enforcement nor increase the risk \nof misbehavior in bathrooms and locker rooms. We are also \nunconvinced that students will take advantage of gender-af-\nﬁrming  facility  access  policies  by  masquerading  as \ntransgender. Based on the accounts of amici school adminis-\ntrators who have implemented gender-aﬃrming facility ac-\ncess policies, such a scenario has never materialized.  \n2.  Irreparable Harm \n“[P]laintiﬀs seeking preliminary relief [are required] to \ndemonstrate that irreparable injury is likely in the absence of \n\nCase: 22-1786      Document: 116            Filed: 08/01/2023      Pages: 26\nNos. 22-1786 & 22-2318  23 \nan injunction.” Winter, 555 U.S. at 22. Irreparable harm occurs \nwhen the “legal remedies available to the movant are inade-\nquate.” DM Trans, LLC v. Scott, 38 F.4th 608, 618 (7th Cir. \n2022). \nBoth district courts determined that the plaintiﬀs were \nlikely to suﬀer irreparable harm, noting the similarities be-\ntween the cases of A.C., B.E. and S.E. and the plaintiﬀ in Whit-\naker. The school districts attempted to distinguish Whitaker, \npointing out that A.C. did not report suicidal ideation and \nthat B.E. and S.E. did not show they had restricted water in-\ntake. But the district courts found those factual distinctions \ninsigniﬁcant. \nWe have little to add to their analysis, except to note again \nthat the district courts based their decisions on facts in the rec-\nord, and that the school districts have not shown clear error. \nThe plaintiﬀs have established that the harm they face is on-\ngoing, debilitating, and cannot be remedied with monetary \ndamages. Although the plaintiﬀ in Whitaker experienced sui-\ncidal thoughts, that is not essential for these cases.  \n3.  Balance of Equities and the Public Interest \nBefore issuing an injunction, courts are required to “bal-\nance the competing claims of injury” and “consider the eﬀect \non each party of the granting or withholding of the requested \nrelief.” Winter, 555 U.S. at 24 (quoting Amoco Production Co. v. \nVillage of Gambell, 480 U.S. 531, 542 (1987)). This includes “par-\nticular regard for the public consequences” should the pre-\nliminary  injunction  be  issued.  Id.  (quoting  Weinberger  v. \nRomero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. 305, 312 (1982)).  \nBoth district courts found the school districts’ claims of in-\njury unconvincing. In A.C., Martinsville’s claims of harm were \n\nCase: 22-1786      Document: 116            Filed: 08/01/2023      Pages: 26\n24  Nos. 22-1786 & 22-2318 \nunsupported, given that high school students were granted \naccommodations  without  incident.  Similarly,  in  B.E.,  the \nplaintiﬀs had used the boys’ bathrooms at the beginning of \nthe year without incident and there was no evidence of harm \nto Vigo County in the record. The records showed only spec-\nulative harms, which are not enough to tip the balance. See \nWhitaker, 858 F.3d at 1054. \nThe district courts also agreed that the public interest \nweighed in favor of issuing the injunctions. They noted that \nprotecting civil and constitutional rights is in the public inter-\nest, and they saw no harm to the public. The district court in \nA.C. acknowledged the importance of individual privacy in-\nterests to the public, but A.C.’s presence in the boys’ bathroom \ndid not threaten those privacy interests. And the district court \nin B.E. observed that the school district’s insistence upon the \nneed  for  executive  or  congressional  guidance  was  under-\nmined by the fact that Whitaker has been controlling law in the \nSeventh Circuit since 2017. Indeed, Vigo County crafted an ef-\nfective written policy to manage gender-aﬃrming facility ac-\ncess despite the lack of additional rulemaking or legislation.  \nThere was no abuse of discretion in this balancing of the \nequities and the public interest. Nor do we see either legal er-\nror in the underlying analysis or clear error in any of the sup-\nporting factual ﬁndings. That is enough to resolve these ap-\npeals.  \nIII \nThese consolidated appeals are almost indistinguishable \nfrom Whitaker. Because our reasoning in Whitaker controls, we \nAFFIRM the orders granting the plaintiﬀs’ motions for prelim-\ninary injunctions. \n\nCase: 22-1786      Document: 116            Filed: 08/01/2023      Pages: 26\nNos. 22-1786 & 22-2318  25 \nEASTERBROOK, Circuit Judge, concurring. Given Whitaker v. \nKenosha School District, 858 F.3d 1034 (7th Cir. 2017), this is an \neasy case for the plaintiﬀs. I am no more disposed than my \ncolleagues to overrule Whitaker. A conﬂict among the circuits \nwill exist no matter what happens in the current suits. The Su-\npreme Court or Congress could produce a nationally uniform \napproach; we cannot. \nI concur only in the judgment, however, because, although \nI admire my colleagues’ thoughtful opinion, they endorse \nWhitaker, while I think that Adams v. St. Johns County School \nBoard, 57 F.4th 791 (11th Cir. 2022) (en banc), better under-\nstands how Title IX applies to transgender students. \nMy colleagues express conﬁdence that Title VII (the sub-\nject of Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020)) and \nTitle IX use “sex” in the same way. See slip op. 13–14. The ma-\njority in Adams was equally conﬁdent of the opposite propo-\nsition. I am not so sure about either view. Title IX does not \ndeﬁne the word, which can refer to biological sex (encoded in \na person’s genes) or to social relations (gender). Sex is such a \ncomplex subject that any invocation of plain meaning is apt to \nmisﬁre. I think, however, that Adams is closer to the mark in \nconcluding that “sex” in Title IX has a genetic sense, given \nthat word’s normal usage when the statute was enacted. \nIndiana has elected to use a social deﬁnition rather than a \ngenetic one; the state’s judiciary has entered orders classifying \nall three plaintiﬀs as boys. Like my colleagues (see slip op. 21) \nI’m puzzled that the school districts did not act on the logical \nimplication of these orders. Much of life reﬂects social rela-\ntions and desires rather than instructions encoded in DNA. \nNurture and nature both play large roles in human life. Clas-\nsifying as “boys” youngsters who are socially boys (even if not \n\nCase: 22-1786      Document: 116            Filed: 08/01/2023      Pages: 26\n26  Nos. 22-1786 & 22-2318 \ngenetically male) is an act of kindness without serious costs to \nthird parties. But if Title IX uses the word “sex” in the genetic \nsense, then federal law does not compel states to do this. \n   \n ",

Wooden  Middle  School  in  his  official  capacity's \n(collectively, the \"School District\") Request for the Court to take Judicial Notice of State Court \nOrder and Notice of Collateral Estoppel (Filing No. 42). The School District's Request is related \nto a pending Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Filing No. 9) from Plaintiff A.C. a minor child, \nby his next friend, mother and legal guardian, M.C. (\"A.C.\") related to his Complaint seeking \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief for violations of Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment (Filing No. 1). For the following reasons, the Court grants in part and \ndenies in part the Request.  \nI.  LEGAL STANDARD \n  Federal Rule of Evidence 201(b) permits a court to take judicial notice of an adjudicative \nfact that is \"not subject to reasonable dispute\" because it (1) is generally known within the trial \ncourt's territorial jurisdiction; or (2) can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-MPB   Document 47   Filed 04/14/22   Page 2 of 4 PageID #: 575\naccuracy cannot reasonably be questioned. \"Judicial notice is premised on the concept that certain \nfacts or propositions exist which a court may accept as true without requiring additional proof from \nthe opposing parties.\" Gen. Elec. Capital Corp. v. Lease Resolution Corp., 128 F.3d 1074, 1081 \n(7th Cir. 1997).  \n  Collateral estoppel, also referred to as issue preclusion, prevents a party from relitigating \nissues that were resolved in a prior legal action. Adams v. City of Indianapolis, 742 F.3d 720, 736 \n(7th Cir. 2014). When a party attempts to use collateral estoppel they must show that (1) the party \nagainst whom the estoppel is asserted was a party to the prior adjudication, (2) the issues forming \nthe basis of the estoppel were actually litigated and decided on the merits in the prior suit, (3) the \nresolution of the particular issues was necessary to the court's judgment, and (4) those issues are \nidentical  to issues raised in the subsequent suit. Munson v. Butler, 776 F. App'x 339, 342 (7th Cir. \n2019) (quotations omitted).  \nII.  DISCUSSION \nA.  Request to Take Judicial Notice \n  The School District requests that this Court take judicial notice of the Findings and \nConclusions denying A.C.'s request for a gender marker change entered by the Morgan Superior \nCourt in A.C.'s state court case. (Filing No. 42.) Orders that have been entered by a state court are \npublic records and \"appropriate subjects of judicial notice.\" In re Lisse, 905 F.3d 495, 496 (7th \nCir. 2018). Thus, the Court grants the Request to take judicial notice of the state court's order. \nB.  Notice of Collateral Estoppel \n  In addition to asking this Court to take judicial notice, the School District also argues that \nthe order meets the requirements of collateral estoppel on the issues of irreparable harm and \nbalance of harm in A.C.'s preliminary injunction motion, which is currently pending before this \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-MPB   Document 47   Filed 04/14/22   Page 3 of 4 PageID #: 576\nCourt. Specifically, the School District contends that \"at this preliminary injunction stage, the \nMorgan Superior Court order offers the only individualized assessment of the best interests of the \nchild before this Court.\" (Filing No. 42 at 3.)  \n  The Court does not agree. The Morgan Superior Court order was solely limited to deciding \nwhether the gender marker on A.C.'s birth certificate should be changed. See In re A.L., 81 N.E.3d \n283, 288 (Ind. Ct. App. 2017). That issue is not before this Court. Pending before this Court are \nA.C.'s claims of violation of Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause. (Filing No. 1.) While the \nSchool District expressed at oral argument that a gender marker change might influence its \ndecision on whether to let A.C. use the boys' restroom, the gender marker change is not dispositive \nof the Court's pending decision on A.C.'s preliminary injunction motion. Further, as it relates to \nthe issue of irreparable harm and balance of harm, it is difficult for the Court to see how the Morgan \nSuperior Court order weighs in the School District's favor as the School District was not a party to \nthe state court action and provided no support that the state court reached its decision relying on \nthe same evidence that has been presented to this Court. While both cases involve A.C. and issues \nsurrounding his gender identity, the Morgan Superior Court's order has no preclusive effect on this \nCourt's future decisions. In this regard, the School District's Notice is denied. \nIII.  CONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, Defendants Metropolitan School District of Martinsville's and \nPrincipal of John R. Wooden Middle School in his official capacity's Request for the Court to Take \nJudicial Notice (Filing No. 42) is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. It is granted in that \nthe Court takes Judicial Notice of the Morgan Superior Court's Order, but the Notice of Collateral \nEstoppel is denied. \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-02965-TWP-MPB   Document 47   Filed 04/14/22   Page 4 of 4 PageID #: 577\n  SO ORDERED. \n \nDate:   4/14/2022 \n   \n \n \n \n \nDistribution: \n \nKathleen Belle Bensberg \nIndiana Legal Services \nkathleen.bensberg@ilsi.net \n \nKenneth J.
