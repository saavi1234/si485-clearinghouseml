As the Court proposed in November, any Respondent who accepts full or partial responsibility for misconduct found by the panel may thus advise the Court and, in lieu of showing cause, explain with specificity the misconduct for which he or she accepts responsibility and comment on the appropriate sanction in his or her response to this order. Any Respondent who believes that specific additional evidence is necessary for the Court to determine a Respondent's culpability or an appropriate sanction must move the Court for such action by 3/8/2024 and shall set out in detail that specific additional evidence in said filing. The Respondents' show-cause briefs are due by 3/22/2024. In a separate filing, the Respondents must identify those portions of all other Respondents' briefs with which they agree or disagree by 4/5/2024. The Court has made reasonable efforts to set the show-cause hearing on dates in February or March which are free of scheduling conflicts for the Respondents and their attorneys, but it has met with no success. The Court will therefore set this matter in May and expect the Respondents and their attorneys to be available.

    "summary": "<p>This case is about Alabama&rsquo;s Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act (&ldquo;the Act&rdquo;), which subjects anyone who &ldquo;causes&rdquo; a transgender minor to receive prohibited gender-affirming medical care to criminal penalties. Four transgender children and their parents, two medical professionals, and a reverend filed this lawsuit on April 19, 2022 in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama. The plaintiffs&mdash;represented by the National Center for Lesbian Rights, GLBTQ Legal Advocates &amp; Defenders, Southern Poverty Law Center, Human Rights Campaign Foundation, and private counsel&mdash;sued the Attorney General of Alabama and various district attorneys in Alabama.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs alleged the Act prohibited parents from seeking and obtaining appropriate medical care for their transgender children, prohibited physicians from caring for those children, and prohibited clergy from counseling those children. The plaintiffs alleged violations of the Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. &sect; 18116) and 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, claiming a deprivation of their Fourteenth Amendment rights to equal protection and substantive due process, their Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to procedural due process, and their First Amendment right to free speech. The plaintiffs sought a declaration that the Act violated federal law and the U.S. Constitution, an injunction to prevent the Act&rsquo;s enforcement, and attorneys&rsquo; fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1988. The case was assigned to District Judge Liles C. Burke for the Northern District of Alabama on April 20.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction and a temporary restraining order to temporarily prohibit the Act&rsquo;s enforcement on April 21, 2022. The United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division moved to intervene as a plaintiff, and the court granted its motion on May 8.</p>\r\n<p>On May 13, the court granted the preliminary injunction as to Section 4(a)(1)&ndash;(3) of the Act, but left the other parts of the Act intact. The court found a substantial likelihood that Section 4(a)(1)&ndash;(3) violated the Fourteenth Amendment by (1) infringing on a parent&rsquo;s right to direct her child&rsquo;s medical care under the Due Process Clause and (2) engaging in sex-based discrimination against transgender minors, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 16, the defendants appealed the district court&rsquo;s decision to grant the preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. On May 20, the parties jointly moved to dismiss the governor as a defendant for the sake of efficiency, and the court officially dismissed her from the suit on May 31. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on August 9 that reflected the governor&rsquo;s dismissal. On August 23, the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint. The plaintiffs then filed a second amended complaint on September 19, which removed the reverend as a plaintiff and eliminated the Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process and First Amendment free speech claims. On September 20, the court denied the defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss because it was based on the since-eliminated claims from the first amended complaint.</p>\r\n<p>On August 21, 2023, the Eleventh Circuit vacated the preliminary injunction. The court found that the plaintiffs did not demonstrate the existence of a constitutional right to treat one&rsquo;s children with transitioning medications and did not show that the Act created a sex-based classification. The court held that the district court should have applied rational basis review, and thus abused its discretion by evaluating the Act under strict scrutiny. Circuit Judge Barbara Lagoa, Circuit Judge Andrew L. Brasher, and District Judge J.P. Boulee wrote the opinion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In light of the Eleventh Circuit&rsquo;s opinion, the defendants requested to stay the preliminary injunction on September 6. On September 11, the plaintiffs filed a petition for rehearing en banc of the Eleventh Circuit&rsquo;s decision to vacate the preliminary injunction.</p>\r\n<p>The Eleventh Circuit officially halted its command to vacate the preliminary injunction on September 15 and is currently considering the plaintiffs&rsquo; petition for rehearing en banc and the issue of whether to stay the preliminary injunction while the petition is pending. District Judge Burke issued sealed orders on October 4 and October 11.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On November 21, the defendants filed a motion for stay of injunction arguing that there would be irreparable harm absent a stay. The plaintiffs filed a response motion on December 1.</p>\r\n<p>On December 26, 2023, the Middle District of Alabama denied the United States&rsquo; motion to stay all District Court proceedings. The Court held that a stay may be appropriate later if&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>the Eleventh Circuit should grant Plaintiffs' petition for rehearing en banc or the Supreme Court should grant certiorari in L.W. v. Skrmetti or Doe v. Kentucky.</p>\r\n<p>On January 11, 2024, the defendants&rsquo; motion to stay a preliminary injunction was granted.</p>\r\n<p>During Spring 2022, the chief judges of the U.S. District Courts for Alabama's Northern, Middle, and Southern Districts formed a three-judge panel to investigate court filings and public statements that suggested potential judge-shopping. The investigation involved thirty-nine lawyers from three related cases. In its Final Report of Inquiry, the panel unanimously concluded that eleven of these lawyers had intentionally sought to bypass the random case assignment process in the Northern and Middle Districts of Alabama. The panel confirmed that impermissible judge-shopping had occurred and instructed that the report be served on the Court for further action. On February 21, 2024, the Court ordered the eleven lawyers to show cause why they should not be sanctioned for the misconduct outlined in the Final Report of Inquiry.</p>\r\n<p><br />On May 27, 2024, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. The defendants argued that the act in question would pass rational basis review and would survive review with heightened scrutiny by the court.</p>\r\n<p>On August 24, the Eleventh Circuit ordered that the case would not be reheard en banc. The next day, the order withholding issuance of the mandate was vacated. On June 24, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice asked the court to stay proceedings after the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to take up a lawsuit, L.W. v. Skrmetti (3:23-cv-00376), against a similar ban in Tennessee. As of October 2024, the case remains ongoing.</p>",

INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiffs are a church pastor, parents, and healthcare providers who seek to \nensure that the Plaintiff children in this case receive necessary medical care. The \nReverend Paul Eknes-Tucker is the Senior Pastor at a Birmingham church who has \nprovided pastoral counseling to congregants and community members who are \nparents of transgender children. Brianna Boe, James Zoe, Megan Poe, and Kathy \nNoe  (together,  “Parent  Plaintiffs”)  are  parents  of  children  who  are  currently \nreceiving medical care for gender dysphoria; they are suing individually and on \nbehalf of their children. Michael Boe, Zachary Zoe, Allison Poe, and Christopher \nNoe (together, “Transgender Plaintiffs”) are transgender minors whose medical care \nwill be halted or precluded by the Act. Dr. Jane Moe and Dr. Rachel Koe (together, \n“Healthcare Provider Plaintiffs”) are healthcare providers who will be subjected to \nfelony arrest and potential imprisonment for providing recommended medical care \nto their patients—care recognized as medically appropriate and necessary by every \nmajor expert medical association—if the Alabama Vulnerable Child Compassion \nand Protection Act (the “Act”) goes into effect on May 8, 2022.   \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 10 of 63\nII.  STATEMENT OF FACTS \nA.  The Act Prevents the Parent Plaintiffs from Receiving the Support \nThey Need to Make Important Medical Decisions for their \nChildren’s Health and Well-Being. \n1.  Reverend Paul Eknes-Tucker \nRev.  Paul  Eknes-Tucker  is  the  Senior  Pastor  at  Pilgrim  Church  in \nBirmingham, Alabama where he has served for seven years. (See Declaration of Rev. \nPaul Eknes-Tucker (“Rev. Eknes-Tucker Decl.”) ¶ 1.) A core tenet of his faith is \nlove, respect, and support for all persons. (Id. ¶ 4.) In his pastoral role, he has \nprovided counseling to congregants and community members who are the parents of \ntransgender children. (Id. ¶ 5.) In those discussions, parents are often uncertain about \nwhat guidance their faith can provide as they figure out how to support their child. \n(Id.) Parents often share with Rev. Eknes-Tucker their worries and fears as well as \nhopes and aspirations for their transgender child’s future. (Id. ¶ 6.) His religious faith \ncompels him to support parents in accepting their transgender children. (Id.) This \nincludes  counseling  parents  to  get  help  from  medical  and  mental  health \nprofessionals, when needed, to assist and care for their children and to embrace who \nthey are. (Id.) \n2.  Brianna Boe and Her Son Michael Boe \nMichael  Boe  is  a  twelve-year-old  transgender  boy  who  resides  with  his \nmother, Brianna, in Montgomery County, Alabama. (See Declaration of Brianna Boe \n(“Boe Decl.”) ¶¶ 1-2.) In his early years, Michael was a happy, outgoing child. \n2 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 11 of 63\n(Id. ¶ 3.) At nine years old, however, Michael became depressed and anxious. (Id.) \nMichael also started struggling academically and socially. (Id.) Michael eventually \nconfided in his mother that he felt as though he was not like other girls and was \nworried about being judged by his classmates. (Id. ¶ 4.) He also reported that he was \nbeing bullied in  school.  (Id.)  Brianna placed  Michael in  a new school  for the \nfollowing school year and brought him to a therapist to help him with his depression. \n(Id. ¶ 5.) \nMichael began to talk with his mother about his male gender identity and the \ndistress and discomfort he was experiencing as he entered puberty and his body \nbegan to develop in ways that were inconsistent with his sense of self. (Id. ¶¶ 5-6.) \nIn June 2021, Michael told his mother that he is transgender. (Id. ¶ 7.) With support \nfrom  his  family  and  a  mental  health  provider  experienced  in  working  with \ntransgender youth, Michael began to socially transition, including adopting a male \nname and pronouns and generally living as a boy in all aspects of his life. (Id. ¶¶ 7-9.) \nSince Michael began to socially transition, his mood has improved greatly. \n(Id.  ¶  9.)  His  therapist  recently  recommended  that  Michael  be  evaluated  for \nadditional medical treatment to address the distress he continues to experience due \nto the mismatch between his body and his gender identity. (Id. ¶¶ 9-12.) \nIn February 2022, Brianna made an initial appointment for Michael at the \nChildren’s  Hospital  of  Alabama.  (Id.  ¶  14.)  If  this  law  goes  into  effect,  that \n3 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 12 of 63\nappointment will be cancelled, and Michael cannot be assessed for critical medical \ncare. (Id. ¶¶ 14-15.) In addition, he will continue to experience the effects of female \npuberty which will cause him to develop additional physical traits inconsistent with \nhis identity as a boy and will severely exacerbate his distress. (Id. ¶¶ 9-12, 15.) \n3.  Megan Poe and Her Daughter Allison Poe \nAllison Poe is a fifteen-year-old transgender girl who resides with her mother, \nMegan Poe, in Cullman County, Alabama. (See Declaration of Megan Poe (“Poe \nDecl.”) ¶¶ 1-3.) As a young child, Allison showed interest in girls’ toys and clothing. \n(Id. ¶ 4.) Thinking this was a phase, her parents initially refused to buy Allison any \ngirl toys. (Id.) Without asking, Allison’s grandmother bought Allison a Barbie doll. \n(Id.) Allison was so happy and carried it everywhere. (Id.) \nWhen the family returned to the United States from her father’s deployment \nabroad, Allison would become very upset when her mother refused to buy her girls’ \nclothes. (Id. ¶ 5.) As a compromise and remembering Allison’s response to the \ngrandmother buying her a doll, Megan bought Allison a few girls’ toys, again \nproviding Allison some short-term relief from the despair she was experiencing. (Id.) \nWhen  Allison  was  around  nine  years  old,  her  personality  began  to  change \nsignificantly.  (Id.  ¶  9.)  She  became  withdrawn  and  quiet,  showed  signs  of \ndepression, and regularly commented that she wanted to die. (Id.) Allison’s actions \nbecame so worrisome to Megan that she consulted with a pediatrician. (Id. ¶ 10.) \n4 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 13 of 63\nThe pediatrician suggested that Allison may be transgender and referred them to the \ngender clinic at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (“UAB”) Hospital. (Id.)  \nAfter evaluating Allison, a team of clinicians educated Megan about what \nAllison was experiencing and gave her professional advice about how to support \nAllison. (Id. ¶¶ 11-12.) That visit was a turning point for Megan. (Id. ¶ 13.) Having \na better understanding of what Allison was experiencing and receiving guidance \nabout how to support her child’s ability to thrive, Megan helped Allison redecorate \nher room and began buying girls’ clothes for her. (Id. ¶ 14.) The first time Allison \nemerged from her room in girls’ clothes she was beaming with joy. (Id.)  \nDuring  fifth  grade,  in  anticipation  of  her  starting  puberty,  Allison  was \nevaluated for puberty-blocking medication, which she started taking at the end of \nsixth grade. (Id. ¶¶ 18-19.) About seven months ago, just as Allison was beginning \nhigh school, she was evaluated for and eventually started on estrogen. (Id. ¶ 21.) Her \nmental health has improved dramatically; she is confident, social, and doing well in \nschool. (Id. ¶ 22.) If the Act is allowed to go into effect, Allison’s medical care will \nbe disrupted, which will cause her body to start producing male hormones resulting \nin changes to her body inconsistent with her female identity. (Id. ¶ 23.) Should that \nhappen, Allison will again experience severe distress and anxiety. (Id.)  \n5 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 14 of 63\n4.  James Zoe and His Son Zachary Zoe  \nJames Zoe lives with his wife and son Zachary in Jefferson County, Alabama. \n(See Declaration of James Zoe (“Zoe Decl.”) ¶¶ 1-2.) He is the parent of Zachary \nZoe, a thirteen-year-old transgender boy who is currently in the seventh grade. (Id. \n¶ 2.) Zachary lives part-time with his father and stepmother in Jefferson County, and \npart-time with his mother and stepfather in St. Clair County. (Id. ¶ 5.) Zachary is a \nbright boy with a close group of friends who is interested in video games and art. \n(Id.) \nZachary was assigned female at birth. (Id. ¶ 6.) As a young child, Zachary was \nshy and reserved. (Id.) Around the age of eight, Zachary began to express his dislike \nof wearing dresses and bright clothing. (Id.) Over time, Zachary started dressing in \nmore masculine attire and became upset if people identified him as a girl. (Id.)  \nAs Zachary entered puberty, the physical changes he started to experience, \nincluding breast development and menstruation, caused him to become distressed \nand withdrawn. (Id. ¶ 7.) When Zachary was eleven years old, he began referring to \nhimself using “he” and “him” pronouns. (Id. ¶ 8.) As his friends began to refer to \nhim in this way, he experienced relief from the distress he had been experiencing as \nwell as a greater sense of self-awareness and self-acceptance. (Id.) Both sets of \nparents supported him in socially transitioning to live as a boy. (Id.) Since he came \n6 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 15 of 63\nout  as  transgender and  received support  from  friends  and  family, Zachary has \nblossomed into a happier and more outgoing child. (Id. ¶ 9.)  \nIn October 2021, after completing appropriate mental health evaluations, and \nwith the support of his pediatrician and both sets of parents, Zachary began puberty-\nblockers. (Id. ¶ 10.) He recently had an appointment to be assessed for hormone \ntherapy at Children’s Hospital of Alabama at Birmingham. (Id.) \nIf the Act is enforced, Zachary’s parents will no longer be able to rely on—or \nfollow—the advice of qualified and trusted healthcare providers to make decisions \nthat keep Zachary healthy and safe. (Id. ¶ 11.) Zachary’s life will also be disrupted, \nand his physical and mental health will suffer. (Id. ¶ 13.) If he cannot remain on \npuberty blocking medication, Zachary’s body will begin to develop in ways that are \ninconsistent with his identity as a boy, which will cause him severe distress. (Id.) It \nwill also mean that he may have to take more serious steps in the future as an adult \nto treat his gender dysphoria, including, for example, having to undergo otherwise \navoidable surgery. (Id.)  \n5.  Kathy Noe and Her Son Christopher Noe \nChristopher Noe is a seventeen-year-old transgender boy who resides with his \nmother, Kathy Noe, in Lee County, Alabama. (See Declaration of Kathy Noe (“Noe \nDecl.”) ¶¶ 1-2.) Christopher and Kathy moved to Alabama when Christopher was \n7 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 16 of 63\nthree  years  old.  (Id.  ¶¶  3-4.)  Kathy  is  former  active-duty  military,  while \nChristopher’s father is still active-duty military and is deployed abroad. (Id. ¶ 3.)  \nSince Christopher was a toddler, he resisted anyone’s attempts to dress him \nas a girl. (Id. ¶¶ 5-6.) He even refused to attend his sixth-grade graduation because \ndoing so meant he would have to wear a dress. (Id. ¶ 6.) As Christopher began to \nenter puberty, his distress at the changes his body was undergoing and at being made \nto present as female intensified. (Id. ¶ 12.) When Christopher was fourteen, he told \nhis  mother  he  is  transgender.  (Id.  ¶  8.)  Kathy  found  Christopher  a  therapist \nexperienced in working with transgender young people. (Id. ¶ 9.) The therapist \nhelped both Christopher and Kathy navigate the beginning stages of Christopher’s \ntransition. (Id.) \nAbout a year later, Christopher came out to his father as transgender. (Id. \n¶ 10.)  Christopher’s  father  struggled  initially,  but  because  of  his  love  for \nChristopher, his father began to accept Christopher for who he is. (Id.) With his \nfather’s support, Kathy took Christopher to a physician to begin the evaluation for \nhormone therapy. (Id. ¶¶ 10, 14.) Because Kathy and Christopher live close to the \nAlabama-Georgia state line, Christopher’s doctors are in Columbus, Georgia. (Id. \n¶ 16.) Christopher’s prescriptions, however, are filled in Alabama, and Kathy gives \nChristopher his hormone injections at home. (Id. ¶¶ 15-16.)  \n8 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 17 of 63\nChristopher began hormone therapy in March 2022. (Id. ¶ 15.) Since then, \nChristopher  has  been  noticeably  happier.  (Id.  ¶  17.)  He  is  more  outgoing  and \nconfident at work and around other people. (Id.) If the Act is allowed to go into \neffect, Christopher’s medical care will be disrupted, which will have devastating and \nirreversible physical and psychological consequences. (Id. ¶ 18.)   \n6.  Dr. Jane Moe \nDr. Jane Moe is a licensed clinical psychologist who has been practicing in \nAlabama for twenty years and works in a hospital setting within the UAB system \nproviding direct mental health care to children and adolescents. (See Declaration of \nDr. Jane Moe (“Moe Decl.”) ¶¶ 1-4.) For the past two years, Dr. Moe has treated \napproximately forty transgender young people, ranging in age from five to nineteen. \n(Id. ¶ 4.) \nShe  follows  the  standard  of  care  developed  by  the  World  Professional \nAssociation for Transgender Health (“WPATH”) and a comprehensive informed-\nconsent protocol. (Id. ¶ 5.) Her assessment of transgender youth involves parents as \nwell as the patient. (Id. ¶¶ 5-6.) The process requires a minimum of three to four \nvisits, which typically take place over the course of two to three months. (Id. ¶ 6.) \nThe assessment is comprehensive and involves many different methods of gathering \ninformation on the patient, including discussions with the parents, to determine \nwhether they meet the diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria. (Id. ¶¶ 7-8.) \n9 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 18 of 63\nDr. Moe also reviews with the patient and the patient’s parents the risks, \nbenefits, and ranges of medical treatment available and appropriate for treating any \npatient’s condition. (Id. ¶ 9.) Dr. Moe then writes a letter to the patient’s doctor \ndetailing the results of her assessment and recommendations for continued care. (Id. \n¶¶ 9, 11.) \nFor Dr. Moe, the Act means that she must either abandon her professional and \nethical obligations when treating transgender patients or risk criminal penalty for \nproviding mental health care consistent with the prevailing standards of care. (Id. \n¶ 14.) She is deeply concerned about the effects this law will have on her patients’ \nmental health, many of whom already experience bullying and harassment in their \nschools and communities. (Id. ¶ 15.) She is concerned that if healthcare providers \nare required to comply with the Act, transgender youth will be denied essential care. \n(Id. ¶ 13.) Their mental health will deteriorate, impairing their ability to function in \ntheir day-to-day lives. (Id. ¶ 16.) That decline in mental health will cause a cascade \nof negative health outcomes, including exacerbating co-occurring mental health \nissues,  increased  reliance  on  maladaptive  coping  mechanisms  (e.g.,  cutting, \nsubstance abuse), and suicidality. (Id.) \n7.  Dr. Rachel Koe \nDr. Rachel Koe is a board-certified pediatrician in southeast Alabama. (See \nDeclaration of Dr. Rachel Koe (“Koe Decl.”) ¶¶ 1-3.) Over the past decade, Dr. Koe \n10 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 19 of 63\nhas treated a handful of transgender patients, including one current patient for whom \nshe provides primary care. (Id. ¶¶ 4, 9-10.) Depending on need, Dr. Koe has referred \ntransgender patients and their parents to local mental health providers as well as the \ngender clinic at UAB Hospital. (Id. ¶¶ 5, 9.) Even after referral, Dr. Koe remains \ninvolved with her transgender patients’ care, as she does for other patients referred \nfor specialty treatments. (Id. ¶¶ 6, 9.) For example, Dr. Koe’s office draws blood for \ntheir transgender patient’s regular blood work in advance of appointments with the \ngender clinic. (Id.) Additionally, she and her staff provide support to patients who \nneed  assistance  in  self-administering  injectable  hormone  medications  like \ntestosterone. (Id.) \nIf  the  Act  goes  into  effect,  Dr.  Koe  will  be  forced  to  choose  between \ncomplying with the Act and providing for the medical needs of her current and any \nfuture transgender patients. (Id. ¶¶ 11-13.) She knows that if she does not provide \nthe medical treatments they need, her transgender patients’ mental and physical \nhealth will deteriorate. (Id. ¶ 11.) Because of the Act, Dr. Koe will also be required \nto curtail her speech as she will no longer be allowed to provide accurate and \ncomprehensive information to parents of transgender children and will be prohibited \nfrom making appropriate referrals. (Id. ¶ 12.) Changing her practice in these ways \nwould also put Dr. Koe in jeopardy of violating her legal obligation as a Medicaid \n11 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 20 of 63\nprovider not to discriminate in the provision of medical care to her transgender \npatients. (Id. ¶ 13.) \nB.  Transition Is the Established Course of Care for Gender \nDysphoria. \nGender dysphoria is a serious medical condition that has been recognized for \ndecades (See Declaration of Dr. Linda Hawkins (“Hawkins Decl.”) ¶ 25; Declaration \nof Dr. Stephen Rosenthal (“Rosenthal Decl.”) ¶¶ 23-24.) The diagnosis describes the \nclinical distress a transgender person feels from being made to live without any way \nto resolve the conflict between their assigned sex and their gender identity. (Hawkins \nDecl. ¶ 24; Rosenthal Decl. ¶¶ 26-27.) Gender dysphoria is a rare condition that can \nbe experienced by both adults and youth. (Rosenthal Decl. ¶ 24.) If untreated, gender \ndysphoria  leads  to  serious  negative  health  outcomes  including  anxiety,  severe \ndistress, thoughts or attempts at self-harm, and in many cases, suicide. (Hawkins \nDecl. ¶ 39; Rosenthal Decl. ¶¶ 26, 45, 55.)  \nGender dysphoria, however, is highly treatable. (Rosenthal Decl. ¶ 26.) When \nindividuals with gender dysphoria are diagnosed and medically treated so they live \nconsistent with their gender identity, they can survive and thrive. (Hawkins Decl. \n¶ 26; Rosenthal Decl. ¶ 36.) The overall course of treatment that allows a transgender \nperson to live consistent with their gender identity is called transition. (Rosenthal \nDecl. ¶ 32.) While few minors experience gender dysphoria, for those who do, being \n12 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 21 of 63\nable to transition and to receive appropriate medical care is lifesaving. (Hawkins \nDecl. ¶ 41; Rosenthal Decl. ¶ 45.)  \nFor more than four decades, medical organizations have studied and created \nan evidence-based standard for the medical treatment of transgender patients. (See \nDeclaration  of  Dr.  Morissa  Ladinsky  (“Ladinsky  Decl.”)  ¶  7;  Rosenthal  Decl. \n¶¶ 2-24, 27-31.) This standard confirms that transition, including puberty blockers \nand hormone therapy where appropriate, is the only safe and effective treatment for \ngender dysphoria. (Hawkins Decl. ¶ 38; Rosenthal Decl. ¶ 23.)  \nThe specific components of a patient’s transition and treatment plan are based \non that individual’s medical and mental health needs after comprehensive evaluation \nby a multidisciplinary team. (Ladinsky Decl. ¶¶ 10-12; Rosenthal Decl. ¶¶ 5, 33, 46.) \nQualified professionals manage these treatments, often in a multidisciplinary setting \nwith  endocrinologists,  pediatricians,  and  clinical  psychologists.  (Hawkins  Decl. \n¶ 29; Ladinsky Decl. ¶ 10; Rosenthal Decl. ¶¶ 5, 47-48.) The American Academy of \nPediatrics has adopted this treatment protocol as safe and effective for the health and \nwellbeing of children and adolescents suffering from gender dysphoria. (Hawkins \nDecl. ¶ 25; Ladinsky Decl. ¶ 7; Rosenthal Decl. ¶ 30.)  \nBefore  a  minor  begins  any  treatment  for  gender  dysphoria,  health  care \nproviders undertake a rigorous informed consent process. (Hawkins Decl. ¶ 36; \nLadinsky Decl. ¶¶ 9-10; Rosenthal Decl. ¶¶ 48-51.) Once informed consent is \n13 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 22 of 63\nobtained, there is also a great deal of parent education, counseling of parents, and \ncommunication  among  physicians  in  the  treatment  of  transgender  adolescents. \n(Hawkins Decl. ¶¶ 36-37; Ladinsky Decl. ¶¶ 10-12; Rosenthal Decl. ¶ 47.)  \nThe standard of care for the treatment of gender dysphoria in minors consists \nof social transition and related medical interventions that allow transgender youth to \nlive comfortably consistent with their gender identity. (Hawkins Decl. ¶¶ 27-29; \nRosenthal Decl. ¶ 32.) A young person’s social transition can include adopting a new \nname  and  pronouns,  changing  clothes  and  physical  appearance,  and  correcting \nidentity  documents.  (Hawkins  Decl.  ¶¶  27-29;  Rosenthal  Decl.  ¶  32.)  Medical \ninterventions, which may be pursued concurrently with a social transition, can \ninvolve the use of puberty-blocking medication, and for older adolescents, hormone \ntherapy. (Hawkins Decl. ¶ 29; Rosenthal Decl. ¶¶ 35-41.) Although transgender \nadults may pursue surgical treatment, surgery is rarely indicated for transgender \nminors. (Rosenthal Decl. ¶ 46.)  \nAfter the onset of puberty, minors diagnosed with gender dysphoria may be \nprescribed  puberty-blocking  medications  to  prevent  them  from  continuing  to \nundergo puberty in their birth sex and developing permanent physical characteristics \nthat conflict with their gender identity. (Id. ¶¶ 35-38.) Puberty-blocking medications \nwork by pausing endogenous puberty at whatever stage it is when the treatment \nbegins, limiting the influence of a person’s endogenous hormones on their body. \n14 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 23 of 63\n(Id. ¶ 36.) For example, a transgender girl on puberty-blocking medications would \nnot experience the physical changes caused by testosterone, including facial and \nbody hair, male muscular development, an Adam’s apple, or masculinized facial \nstructures.  (Id.)  Similarly,  a  transgender  boy  would  not  experience  breast \ndevelopment, menstruation, or widening of the hips. (Id.)  \nTreatment with puberty-blocking medications is reversible, meaning that if a \nminor stops taking the medication, puberty in the minor’s birth sex resumes. (Id. \n¶¶ 38-39.) In addition to alleviating gender dysphoria and supporting a child’s social \ntransition, puberty-blocking medications may eliminate the need for future surgical \ntreatments  to  treat  ongoing  gender  dysphoria  as  an  adult,  such  as  male  chest \nreconstruction surgery, electrolysis of facial and body hair, and feminizing facial \nsurgeries. (Id. ¶¶ 36-37, 44.) Banning puberty-blocking medications for these youth \nmay require them to undergo future surgeries as adults that they could otherwise \navoid. (Id.).  \nLater in adolescence, a transgender young person may be prescribed hormone \ntherapy when doing so is medically indicated. (Id. ¶ 39.) Before such therapy begins, \na mental health professional must: (1) confirm the persistence of gender dysphoria; \n(2) assess any coexisting psychological, medical, or social problems that could \ninterfere  with  treatment  have  been  addressed  and  the  minor’s  situation  and \nfunctioning are stable enough to start treatment; and (3) verify that the minor has \n15 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 24 of 63\nsufficient mental capacity to understand the consequences of the treatment. (Id. \n¶¶ 48-51; Hawkins Decl. ¶ 36; Ladinsky Decl. ¶¶ 9-11.) A pediatric endocrinologist \nor  other  medical  doctor  must  also  consent  to  and  monitor  the  treatment  plan. \n(Ladinsky Decl. ¶ 13.) With this treatment, a transgender minor would have the same \ntypical levels of testosterone/estrogen as a non-transgender peer. (Rosenthal Decl. \n¶ 39.)   \nThe World Professional Association for Transgender Health developed the \nstandard of care, which represents an expert consensus based on the best available \nscience, on transgender healthcare. (Ladinsky Decl. ¶ 7; Rosenthal Decl. ¶¶ 28-29.) \nThe American Medical Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, American \nPsychiatric Association, American Psychological Association, Pediatric Endocrine \nSociety, and the Endocrine Society all follow the World Professional Association \nfor Transgender Health Standards of Care. (Ladinsky Decl. ¶ 7; Dr. Rosenthal Decl. \n¶ 30.) \nThe diagnosis and treatment of gender dysphoria is an established part of the \ncurriculum  in  medical  schools  across  the  United  States.  (Ladinsky  Decl.  ¶  8.) \nAlabama,  for  example,  requires  all  physicians  to  be  knowledgeable  about \ntransgender medicine to pass medical board exams. (Id.) \n16 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 25 of 63\nC.  The Alabama Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act \nOn  April  8,  2022,  Defendant  Governor  Kay  Ivey  signed  the  Alabama \nVulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act (the “Act”) into law. The Act \nprohibits any person, including a parent or a doctor, from obtaining or providing \nmedical  treatments  consistent  with  the  current  medical  standard  of  care,  for  a \ntransgender minor. Unless enjoined, the Act will become effective on May 8, 2022. \nThe Act states in relevant part: \nSection 4. (a) Except as provided in subsection (b), no person shall \nengage in or cause any of the following practices to be performed upon \na minor if the practice is performed for the purpose of attempting to \nalter the appearance of or affirm the minor’s perception of his or her \ngender or sex, if that perception is inconsistent with the minor’s sex as \ndefined in this act:  \n(1)  Prescribing or administering puberty blocking medication to \nstop or delay normal puberty.  \n(2) Prescribing  or  administering  supraphysiologic  doses  of \ntestosterone or other androgens to females. \n(3) Prescribing  or  administering  supraphysiologic  doses  of \nestrogen to males.  \n(4) Performing  surgeries  that  sterilize,  including  castration, \nvasectomy, hysterectomy, oophorectomy, orchiectomy, and \npenectomy. \n(5) Performing surgeries that artificially construct tissue with the \nappearance  of  genitalia  that differs  from  the individual’s \nbiological sex, including metoidioplasty, phalloplasty, and \nvaginoplasty. \n(6) Removing any healthy or non-diseased body part or tissue, \nexcept for a male circumcision. \n \n17 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 26 of 63\nAla. Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act, S.B. 184, No. 2022-289, \n§ 4(a) (Ala. 2022). A violation of this provision is a Class C felony punishable by \nup to 10 years  imprisonment  and  fines up to $15,000.  Id. §  4(c);  ALA. CODE \n§§ 13A-5-6, 13A-5-11. \nIII.  ARGUMENT \nTo  obtain  a  preliminary  injunction,  a  movant  must  show:  “(1) it  has  a \nsubstantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) irreparable injury will be suffered \nunless the injunction issues; (3) the threatened injury to the movant outweighs \nwhatever damage the proposed injunction may cause the opposing party; and (4) if \nissued, the injunction would not be adverse to the public interest.” Jones v. Governor \nof Fla., 950 F.3d 795, 806 (11th Cir. 2020) (citing Siegel v. LePore, 234 F.3d 1163, \n1176 (11th Cir. 2000) (en banc)). “[A]ll of the well-pleaded allegations of [the] \ncomplaint  and  uncontroverted  affidavits  filed  in  support  of  the  motion  for  a \npreliminary injunction are taken as true.” Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 350 n.1 \n(1976).  \nA temporary restraining order may be imposed “to preserve the court’s ability \nto make a meaningful ruling on the merits,” which “often requires preserving the \nstatus quo.” W. Ala. Women’s Ctr. v. Williamson, 120 F. Supp. 3d 1296, 1320 (M.D. \nAla. 2015). To obtain a temporary restraining order, the movant must show: “(1) a \nsubstantial likelihood of ultimate success on the merits; (2) the TRO is necessary to \n18 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 27 of 63\nprevent irreparable injury; (3) the threatened injury outweighs the harm the TRO \nwould inflict on the non-movant; and (4) the TRO would serve the public interest.” \nIngram v. Ault, 50 F.3d 898, 900 (11th Cir. 1995). \nThese factors strongly support entry of a preliminary injunction in this case. \nIn the event that the Court is unable to make a ruling on the merits of Plaintiffs’ \npreliminary injunction motion before the May 8, 2022 effective date of the Act, these \nfactors also warrant entry of a temporary restraining order because “it is in the public \ninterest to preserve the status quo and give the court an opportunity to evaluate fully \nthe lawfulness of [the Act] without subjecting the plaintiffs, their patients, or the \npublic at large to any of its potential harms.” Planned Parenthood Se., Inc. v. \nBentley, 951 F. Supp. 2d 1280, 1290 (M.D. Ala. 2013). \nA.  Plaintiffs Will Likely Succeed on the Merits of Their Claims \nBecause the Act Is Unconstitutional.  \nPlaintiffs have a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their claims. \nThe Act infringes upon their constitutional rights to parental autonomy and equal \nprotection, violates the right to freedom of speech, and is void for vagueness. It also \nconflicts with the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), 42 U.S.C. § 18001, et seq. (2010). \n1.  The Act Infringes on Parental Autonomy by Preventing \nParents from Obtaining Essential Medical Care for their \nChildren (Count I). \nThe Act violates the fundamental right of the Parent Plaintiffs to obtain \nessential medical care for their children. The Fourteenth Amendment to the United \n19 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 28 of 63\nStates Constitution protects parents’ rights to make decisions “concerning the care, \ncustody, and control of their children,” based on a “presumption” that “fit parents \nact in the best interests of their children.” Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 66, 68-69 \n(2000).  This  right  is  “perhaps  the  oldest  of  the  fundamental  liberty  interests \nrecognized by this Court.” Id. at 65; see also Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584, 602 \n(1979) (collecting cases to demonstrate that the Court has long recognized the \nimportance of parental rights, including Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166 \n(1944), and Pierce v. Soc’y of the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus & Mary, \n268 U.S. 510, 535 (1925)); May v. Anderson, 345 U.S. 528, 533 (1953) (recognizing \nthat parental rights are “far more precious . . . than property rights”). Because this \nright is fundamental, any substantial infringement of parental autonomy is subject to \nstrict scrutiny. Lofton v. Sec’y of Dep’t of Child. & Fam. Servs., 358 F.3d 804, 815 \n(11th Cir. 2004); see also Troxel, 530 U.S. at 80 (Thomas, J., concurring). \nA parent’s ability to seek and obtain appropriate medical treatment to ensure \nthe health and wellbeing of their child is a core aspect of this fundamental right. The \nEleventh  Circuit  has  explained  that  the  Due  Process  Clause  prohibits  a  state, \n“concerned for the medical needs of a child,” from “willfully disregard[ing] the right \nof parents to generally make decisions concerning the treatment to be given to their \nchildren.” Bendiburg v. Dempsey, 909 F.2d 463, 470 (11th Cir. 1990). “[P]arents \nhave the right to decide free from unjustified governmental interference in matters \n20 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 29 of 63\nconcerning the growth, development and upbringing of their children.” Id. (quoting \nArnold v. Bd. of Educ. of Escambia Cty., 880 F.2d 305, 313 (11th Cir. 1989)).  \nThe Act fails constitutional review because it negates, without justification, \nparents’ fundamental right to seek established medical care for their transgender \nchildren. Indeed, the Act criminalizes medical care: (1) recommended to the Parent \nPlaintiffs  as  appropriate  for  their  children  by  their  medical  providers,  and \n(2) recognized  by  the  American  Medical  Association,  American  Academy  of \nPediatrics, American Psychiatric Association, American Psychological Association, \nPediatric  Endocrine  Society,  and  the  Endocrine  Society  as  the  only  effective \ntreatment for their children. See Brandt v. Rutledge, 551 F. Supp. 3d 882, 892 (E.D. \nArk. 2021), appeal docketed, No. 21-2875 (8th Cir. Apr. 19, 2022) (finding that \n“Parent Plaintiffs have a fundamental right to seek medical care for their children \nand,  in  conjunction  with  their  adolescent  child’s  consent  and  their  doctor’s \nrecommendation,  make  a  judgment  that  medical  care  is  necessary”).  The  Act \nprevents parents even from seeking expert medical advice by imposing criminal \npenalties on anyone who “causes” the proscribed treatments to be performed on a \ntransgender minor—language that would encompass consultations with healthcare \nproviders who recommend transition if doing so results in a parent obtaining medical \ncare for their child. SB 184 § 4(a). This categorical, sweeping ban—like any ban on \n21 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 30 of 63\nparents’ ability to seek established medical care for a serious medical condition—is \nunconstitutional. \nAs set forth below, none of the State’s asserted justifications for this intrusion \non parental rights has merit. Contrary to the State’s assertion, the Act jeopardizes \nchildren’s health and safety; it does not protect it. Brandt, 551 F. Supp. 3d at 893 \n(holding that a similar Arkansas law likely violated “a fundamental parental right” \nand likely would fail strict scrutiny because the State could not show that the law \nserved the stated goal of protecting children). \n2.  The Act Violates Equal Protection by Barring Medical \nTreatments for Transgender Minors (Count II). \nThe Act singles out transgender minors in order to deny them medical care, \nincluding denying them the very same medications available to non-transgender \nminors. Because the Act discriminates on the basis of transgender status and sex, \nheightened scrutiny is required. Because the State’s asserted rationales for the ban \nlack merit, Plaintiffs have a substantial likelihood of proving that the Act violates \nthe Equal Protection Clause.  \na.  The Act is Subject to Heightened Scrutiny Under \nWell-Established Precedent. \nThe Act’s discrimination against transgender people is apparent on its face. \nThe Act bans medical care for minors whose “perception of [their] gender or sex . . . \nis inconsistent with the minor’s sex” at birth—i.e., for minors who are transgender. \n22 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 31 of 63\nSB 184 § 4(a). Elsewhere the Act refers to “individuals, including minors, who \nexperience discordance between their sex and their internal sense of identity.” Id. \n§ 2(2)-(4). The Act’s description of its targeted group—those whose perception or \ninternal sense of their sex differs from their sex at birth—coincides exactly with the \ndefinition of a transgender person. It matters not that the Act does not use the word \n“transgender,”  any  more  than  it  would  matter  if  a  law  criminalizing  same-sex \nintimacy did not use the word “lesbian” or “gay.” Under settled law, a statute that \nclassifies  based  on  conduct  or  characteristics  that  either  define  or  are  closely \ncorrelated with a particular group facially discriminates against that group. See, e.g., \nChristian Legal Soc’y v. Martinez, 561 U.S. 661, 689 (2010) (holding that a club’s \nexclusion of people because they engaged in same-sex conduct was discrimination \nbased on sexual orientation); Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 575 (2003) (“When \nhomosexual conduct is made criminal by the law of the State, that declaration in and \nof itself is an invitation to subject homosexual persons to discrimination . . . .”); id. \nat 583 (O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (stating that a law targeting conduct \n“closely correlated with being homosexual” is “directed toward gay persons as a \nclass”); cf. Bray v. Alexandria Women’s Health Clinic, 506 U.S. 263, 270 (1993) \n(“A tax on wearing yarmulkes is a tax on Jews.”). \nBy  discriminating  against  transgender  people,  the  Act  also  discriminates \nbased on sex. Without question, the Act singles out transgender minors for disparate \n23 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 32 of 63\ntreatment.  Both  the  Supreme  Court  and  the  Eleventh  Circuit  have  held  that \ndiscrimination because a person is transgender is based on sex. See Bostock v. \nClayton  Cty.,  140  S.  Ct.  1731,  1741  (2020)  (holding  that  “it  is  impossible  to \ndiscriminate  against  a  person  for  being  homosexual  or  transgender  without \ndiscriminating  against  that  individual  based  on  sex”);  Glenn  v.  Brumby, \n663 F.3d 1312, 1316 (11th Cir. 2011) (holding that “discriminating against someone \non the basis of his or her gender non-conformity constitutes sex-based discrimination \nunder the Equal Protection Clause”).  \nBecause the Act discriminates based on transgender status and sex, it is \nsubject to heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause. Federal courts \nacross the country have held that discrimination based on transgender status warrants \nheightened scrutiny, as it meets the criteria for suspect classification established in \nFrontiero  v.  Richardson,  411  U.S.  677,  686  (1973):  transgender  people  have \nsuffered a history of discrimination; being transgender is an immutable trait and one \nthat is unrelated to a person’s ability to participate in or contribute to society; and \ntransgender people lack the political power to achieve full equality through the \npolitical process.1  \n \n1\n See, e.g., Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1, 858 F. 3d 1034, 1051 (7th Cir. 2017); \nSmith v. City of Salem, 378 F.3d 566, 572 (6th Cir. 2004); Toomey v. Arizona, No. CV-19-00035-\nTUC-RM, 2019 WL 7172144, at *5 (D. Ariz. Dec. 23, 2019); Stone v. Trump, 400 F. Supp. 3d \n317, 355 (D. Md. 2019); F.V. v. Barron, 286 F. Supp. 3d 1131, 1145 (D. Idaho 2018); M.A.B. v. \nBd. of Educ. of Talbot Cty., 286 F. Supp. 3d 704 (D. Md. 2018); Board of Educ. of the Highland \n \n24 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 33 of 63\nIn Brumby, the Eleventh Circuit held that discrimination because a person is \ntransgender is discrimination based on sex and warrants heightened scrutiny for that \nreason.  As  the  court  explained:  “A  person  is  defined  as  transgender  precisely \nbecause of the perception that his or her behavior transgresses gender stereotypes.” \n663. F.3d at 1316. Accordingly, “discrimination on this basis is a form of sex-based \ndiscrimination that is subject to heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection \nClause.” Id. at 1319. \nWhether the Act is analyzed as discrimination based on transgender status or \nsex, the State, at a minimum, “must show at least that the [challenged] classification \nserves  important  governmental  objectives  and  that  the  discriminatory  means \nemployed are substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.” United \nStates v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 516 (1996) (quotations omitted) (modifications in \noriginal). The justification must be “exceedingly persuasive.” Id. The “burden of \njustification is demanding, and it rests entirely on the State.” Id. Neither the State’s \nasserted  interest  nor  the  alleged  relationship  between  the  interest  and  the \ndiscriminatory classification may “rely on overbroad generalizations.” Sessions v. \nMorales-Santana,  137  S.  Ct.  1678,  1689,  1692  (2017).  Nor  may  the  State \n“hypothesiz[e] or inven[t]” its interests “post hoc in response to litigation”—they \n \nLocal Sch. Dist. v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 208 F.

Supp. \n3d 134, 139 (S.D.N.Y. 2015).  \n25 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 34 of 63\nmust be the actual goals the policy was intended to advance at the time it was created. \nId. at 1696–97 (quoting Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533).  \nb.  Defendants Cannot Establish the State’s Asserted Interest \nServes Important Governmental Objectives or the Act Is \nSubstantially Related to the Achievement of those \nObjectives. \nThe Act prohibits parents from obtaining treatments for their children that are \nthe standard of care for gender dysphoria. Decades of evidence support the safety \nand efficacy of transition, including the use of puberty-blocking medication and \nhormone therapy, for treating gender dysphoria in adolescents. (Hawkins Decl. ¶ 25; \nLadinsky Decl. ¶ 7; Rosenthal Decl. ¶¶ 17, 27-31.) Barring those treatments for \ntransgender youth deprives them of medically necessary care and puts them at \nserious  risk  of  mental  health  issues,  self-harm,  and  suicide.  See  Brandt, \n551 F. Supp. 3d  at  891-92  (finding  similar  bill  banning  medical  treatment  for \ntransgender adolescents did not meet heightened scrutiny review, and “would not \neven withstand rational basis scrutiny” because “[g]ender-affirming treatment is \nsupported by medical evidence that has been subject to rigorous study” and “[e]very \nmajor  expert  medical  association  recognizes  that  gender-affirming  care  for \ntransgender minors may be medically appropriate and necessary to improve the \nphysical and mental health of transgender people”); see also Hawkins Decl. ¶ 46; \nLadinsky Decl. ¶ 15; Rosenthal Decl. ¶¶ 45, 55, 57. The Act also increases the \nlikelihood that transgender adolescents will eventually require major surgeries to \n26 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 35 of 63\nreverse  bodily  changes  that  could  have  been  avoided  by  the  well-established \nnon-surgical treatments the Act criminalizes. (Rosenthal Decl. ¶ 37.) \nThe Act purports to advance the objective of protecting transgender minors.  \nNevertheless, the State’s asserted justifications for the Act have no basis in medical \nscience and undermine, rather than advance, the Act’s purported goals. They cannot \nsurvive even a cursory review, much less the demanding scrutiny required by this \ncase.  \ni.  The treatments are effective and well-established. \nContrary  to  the  Act’s  assertion,  the  treatments  provided  to  transgender \nadolescents with gender dysphoria are effective and based on an established standard \nof care. As the Act recognizes, there are youth who “experience discordance between \ntheir sex and their internal sense of identity,” and who, as a result, “experience severe \npsychological distress,” known as “gender dysphoria.” SB 184 § 2(2). As the Act \nalso acknowledges, there is an established course of care and treatment for these \nyoung  people  that  includes  social  transition  and,  where  appropriate,  puberty \nblocking medication and hormone therapy. Id. § 2(7)-(8). \nThe Act claims that these treatments are ineffective, but that is incorrect. The \nAct cites unnamed “studies” that purportedly show that “hormonal and surgical \ninterventions often do not resolve the underlying psychological issues affecting the \nindividual.” Id. § 2(14). In fact, decades of substantial scientific evidence show that \n27 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 36 of 63\ntreatment dramatically improves mental health outcomes for transgender youth, \nincluding  reducing  rates  of  suicidal  ideation  and  suicide  attempts,  which  are \nsignificantly  higher  among  transgender  adolescents  when  compared  to  their \n \nnon-transgender peers. (Hawkins Decl. ¶¶ 38, 41; Ladinsky Decl. ¶ 15; Rosenthal \nDecl. ¶¶ 26, 53-55.)  \nTransition,  including  puberty  blocking  medication  and  hormone  therapy \nwhere appropriate, is the standard of care for treating gender dysphoria and has been \nendorsed by the mainstream medical community in the United States, including the \nAmerican  Medical  Association,  the  American  Academy  of  Pediatrics,  and  the \nEndocrine Society, all of which have determined that the care is safe and effective. \n(Ladinsky Decl. ¶ 7; Rosenthal Decl. ¶ 30.) The Act’s assertions that the treatment \nis  “unproven,”  “poorly  studied,”  and  “experimental,”  SB  184  § 2(11),  are \nunfounded. (Hawkins Decl. ¶¶ 38, 41; Ladinsky Decl. ¶¶ 7-8; Rosenthal Decl. ¶¶ 26, \n53-55.)  \nii.  The treatments are necessary. \nThe Act’s claim that most adolescents with gender dysphoria will “outgrow” \ntheir  transgender  identities  is  incorrect.  Id.  § 2(4).  In  contrast,  the  evidence \noverwhelmingly  shows  that  transgender  adolescents  who  are  appropriately \nidentified, diagnosed, and prescribed treatment continue to live consistent with their \ngender identity as adults and lead happy and fulfilling lives.  (Hawkins Decl. ¶ 26; \n28 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 37 of 63\nRosenthal Decl. ¶¶ 53-54, 36; Moe Decl. ¶ 16; Koe Decl. ¶¶ 5-7.) In the past, \nresearch  tracking  a  wide  range  of  gender-nonconforming  children  (including \ntomboyish girls and feminine boys) found that many of these children grew up to \nidentify as lesbian or gay rather than transgender. (Hawkins Decl. ¶ 22.) However, \nnone of these older studies focused on the much smaller, discrete, and clearly \nidentifiable group of children with gender dysphoria whose persistent, insistent, and \nconsistent cross-gender identification continues into adolescence. (Id.) More recent \nresearch has focused on this specific group of children and found that the likelihood \nof this group “outgrowing” their transgender identity in adolescence or adulthood is \nvirtually nil. (Id.)  \nThe Act also asserts that “[t]he cause of the individual’s impression of a \ndiscordance between sex and identity is unknown,” SB 184 § 2(3), but that is \nincorrect. In fact, substantial evidence has shown that gender identity has a strong \nbiological foundation and is impervious to external factors. (Rosenthal Decl. ¶ 15.) \nContrary to the Act’s assertion, doctors take great care in making a diagnosis \nof  gender  dysphoria  and  follow  detailed  procedures  for  both  confirming  the \ndiagnosis and prescribing a treatment plan, taking a multidisciplinary approach that \nincludes both medical and mental health specialists. The Act incorrectly states that \nthe diagnosis is based “exclusively on the individual’s self-report of feelings and \nbeliefs.” SB 184 § 2(3). In fact, mental health providers who diagnose youth with \n29 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 38 of 63\ngender dysphoria do so based on a comprehensive evaluation. (Ladinsky Decl. ¶ 10; \nRosenthal Decl. ¶ 48; Moe Decl. ¶¶ 6-8.) Any prescribed treatments, including \npuberty  blocking  medication  and  hormone  therapy,  are  undertaken  only  after \nthorough assessment and discussion with parents and youth patients, and only after \nensuring that all persons involved understand the need for treatment along with any \nattendant risks, just as in other medical situations where medication may be required \nto treat a condition. (Ladinsky Decl. ¶¶ 9-11; Rosenthal Decl. ¶¶ 48-51.) \nIn sum, the Act’s claim that the banned treatments are not necessary for the \naffected  children  ignores  the  consensus  of  medical  experts  and  overwhelming \nevidence to the contrary. It is inappropriate for the legislature to look at the entire \ngender-nonconforming youth population, many of whom do not and will never \nexperience gender dysphoria, and bar a medically discrete subset of them from \nreceiving essential medical care. Doing so is like denying life-saving brain cancer \ntreatment recommended by the medical community because most headaches resolve \nwith aspirin. For adolescent patients properly identified as being transgender, a \n“wait-and-see approach” is harmful and may even be lethal. (Hawkins Decl. ¶ 41; \nRosenthal Decl. ¶ 55.)  \niii.  The treatments are safe. \nThe Act incorrectly claims that the treatments it bans are unsafe and that \ntransgender adolescents and their parents are unable to assess their risks and benefits. \n30 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 39 of 63\nFirst, the State’s assertion that the treatments are unsafe because they involve \noff-label  use  of  medications  approved  by  the  Food  and  Drug  Administration \n(“FDA”) is unfounded. In fact, many established medical treatments involve off-\nlabel uses of FDA-approved medications. (Rosenthal Decl. ¶ 49.) “Off-label” refers \nto use of medication that has been FDA approved, but not for all condition for which \n 2\nit may be effective.  The off-label use of medications for children is quite common \nand sometimes necessary, because an “overwhelming number of [FDA-approved] \n3\ndrugs” have no FDA-approved instructions for use in pediatric patients.   \nThe American Academy of Pediatrics specifically approves the off-label use \nof drugs: \nThe  purpose  of  off-label  use  is  to  benefit  the  individual  patient. \nPractitioners use their professional judgment to determine these uses. \nAs such, the term “off-label” does not imply an improper, illegal, \ncontraindicated, or investigational use. Therapeutic decision-making \nmust always rely on the best available evidence and the importance of \n4\nthe benefit for the individual patient.  \n \nThis asserted rationale for the ban also conflicts with the established public \npolicy of this State. On April 1, 2021, the Alabama Senate passed a resolution \nendorsing the widespread practice of prescribing FDA-approved medications for \n \n2\n See Am. Acad. Pediatrics Comm. Drugs, Off-Label Use of Drugs in Children, 133 Pediatrics \n563-67 (2014). \n3\n Id. \n4\n Id. \n31 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 40 of 63\noff-label uses to treat COVID-19. In contrast to the alleged justifications for the Act, \nthe  Senate  Resolution  states:  “we  hereby  recognize  the  sanctity  of  the \nphysician/patient relationship and that a duly licensed physician should be allowed \nto prescribe any FDA approved medication for any condition that the physician and \npatient agree would be beneficial for treatment of the patient without interference by \ngovernment or private parties.” AL SJR 82 (2021). This policy affirms the ability of \nmedical providers to prescribe FDA-approved mediation for “any condition.” There \nis no legitimate reason, much less an important one, to adopt a different rule for \nmedications used to treat transgender patients.  \nSecond, contrary to the Act’s assertion, the medications used to treat gender \ndysphoria, including puberty blockers and hormones, are safe. (Rosenthal Decl. \n¶¶ 23, 31, 55.) Puberty-blocking medication has been used for decades to treat a \nmedical condition known as “precocious puberty.” (Id. ¶ 42.) Hormone therapy is \noften used to treat medical conditions experienced by adolescents including painful \nmenstruation,  amenorrhea,  and  even  serious  acne  conditions.  As  the  Act  itself \nacknowledges, puberty blocking medication is also used to treat “verified disorder[s] \nof sexual developments,” SB 184 § 4(b)(2), often referred to as intersex conditions. \nAlthough  no  medication  can  be  shown  to  have  zero  risks,  puberty  blocking \nmedication and hormones are considered very safe and well within acceptable risk \nfactors for approved medication for minors. (Rosenthal Decl. ¶¶ 23. 31, 55.) \n32 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 41 of 63\nTo the extent there are low-level risks, as there are with any medication, \nAlabama can offer no justification why puberty blocking medication and hormone \ntherapy should be banned for use by transgender minors as “unsafe” but permitted \nfor treatment of minors with other medical conditions. If the State believed these \ntreatments to be unsafe, it would have banned them for all minors, not just the \nTransgender Plaintiffs. As the Eastern District of Arkansas found in Brandt, this \ninsistency strongly suggests that the State’s “goal in passing [the Act] was not to ban \na treatment” but rather “to ban an outcome [the provision of supportive care to \ntransgender minors] that the State deems undesirable.” Brandt, 551 F. Supp. 3d at \n891. The Act violates the Equal Protection clause under even the lowest standard of \nreview.  Id.  (finding  Arkansas’  “health  concerns  regarding  the  risks  of  gender \ntransition procedures . . . pretextual” because Arkansas did not prohibit the same \nprocedures “for all patients under 18 regardless of gender identity”); Eisenstadt v. \nBaird,  405  U.S.  438,  454-55  (1972)  (holding  law  that  barred  prescription  of \ncontraceptives to unmarried people violated the Equal Protection Clause because the \nlaw provided “dissimilar treatment for married and unmarried persons who are \nsimilarly situated”).  \nThe Act’s claim that transgender adolescents and their parents are unable to \nassess the risks of these treatments, see SB 184 § 2(10), is similarly arbitrary and \nwithout support. As discussed previously, doctors who prescribe puberty blocking \n33 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 42 of 63\nmedication or hormone therapy do so only after ensuring that the young person and \ntheir parents understand both the risks and benefits of the treatments and are able to \nmake  an  informed  choice,  as  doctors  do  when  they  prescribe  any  medication. \n(Hawkins  ¶  36;  Ladinsky  ¶¶  9-10;  Rosenthal  Decl.  ¶¶ 47-51.)  Alabama  law \nacknowledges that minors fourteen and older are generally able to consent to medical \ntreatment. ALA. CODE § 22-8-4. There is no reason to impose a different rule simply \nbecause the minors are transgender. \niv.  Minors who stop taking puberty blocking \nmedication or hormone therapy will resume \npuberty in their birth sex.  \nThe Act also mischaracterizes the effects of puberty blocking medication and \nhormone  therapy.  Contrary  to  the  unsupported  assertion  in  the  findings,  if  an \nadolescent  stops  taking  puberty  blocking  medication  or  hormone  therapy,  the \nproduction of endogenous hormones and puberty in the child’s birth sex will resume. \n(Rosenthal Decl. ¶¶ 38, 40.). That is a primary reason why the Plaintiffs are so \ndistressed  about  the  law:  Without  the  treatment  they  need,  their  physical \ndevelopment will revert to that associated with their birth sex.  \nTo  be  sure,  promoting  the  health  and  safety  of  minors  is  an  important \ngovernmental interest. The Act, however, undermines, rather than promotes, that \ngoal. Barring transgender minors from safe, effective, and established medical care \ndetermined to be necessary by their medical providers will destroy lives, including \n34 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 43 of 63\nthose of the minor Plaintiffs in this case. Alabama cannot demonstrate that the Act \npromotes  health  and  safety  in  even  a  rational,  much  less  a  substantial,  way. \nAccordingly, the Plaintiffs are likely to prevail on their claim that the Act violates \nthe Equal Protection Clause.  \n3.  Plaintiffs Are Likely to Succeed on the Merits of Their First \nAmendment Claim (Count IV). \nThe Act also violates the First Amendment by prohibiting any “person,” \nincluding physicians, healthcare professionals, or even parents, from engaging in \nspeech that would “cause” a transgender minor to receive medical treatment for \ngender dysphoria. By the Act’s plain terms, prohibited speech would include, among \nmany other things: (1) a doctor detailing the benefits of medical treatment for gender \ndysphoria or expressing the professional opinion that a young person would likely \nbenefit  from  such  treatment,  if  such  discussions  result  in  the  minor  obtaining \ntreatment; (2) a doctor or therapist referring a patient to an out-of-state provider who \ncan offer medical care; (3) a parent facilitating or expressing support for their child’s \ntransition, or any other speech by a parent that results in a minor obtaining medical \ntreatment, such as consenting to treatment; (4) a transgender adolescent engaging in \ndiscussions or receiving information that leads them to undergo transition-related \ncare; and (5) a minister or religious counselor engaging in speech that leads to the \nminor obtaining care. By barring such speech, the Act prevents any person in the \nState of Alabama from speaking about medically accepted treatments for gender \n35 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 44 of 63\ndysphoria based on the content of those conversations. As a content-based and \nviewpoint discriminatory regulation of speech, the Act is subject to strict scrutiny, \nwhich it fails. \nCourts ordinarily apply strict scrutiny when analyzing the constitutionality of \ncontent or viewpoint-based restrictions on speech. See, e.g., Reed v. Town of Gilbert, \n576 U.S. 155, 171 (2015); Wollschlaeger v. Governor, 848 F.3d 1293, 1308 (11th \nCir. 2017). Content-based laws “target speech based on its communicative content.” \nReed, 576 U.S. at 163. If enforcement authorities must “examine the content of the \nmessage that is conveyed” to know whether the law has been violated, a restriction \nis content-based. McCullen v. Coakley, 573 U.S. 464, 479 (2014). “Content-based \nregulations are presumptively invalid.” R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 382 \n(1992). \nProhibiting parents, healthcare providers, and others from engaging in speech \nthat would “cause” a transgender young person to receive medical treatment for \ngender dysphoria is a content-based regulation, as the content of the speech—\nsupport of medical care—drives whether it was the “cause” of a minor obtaining \ntreatment.  It  is  also  a  viewpoint-based  restriction  because  only  speech  that \nencourages medical care for the minor is targeted; speech that forbids or expresses \ndisapproval of such medical care is not punished. Brandt, 551 F. Supp. 3d at 893 \n(finding that similar Arkansas statute was “a content and viewpoint-based regulation \n36 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 45 of 63\nbecause it restricts healthcare professionals only from making referrals for ‘gender \ntransition procedures,’ not for other purposes”); see also Conant v. Walters, 309 F.3d \n629,  637  (9th  Cir.  2002)  (invalidating  policy  that  punished  doctor-patient \ndiscussions concerning medical marijuana and holding that “the policy does not \nmerely prohibit the discussion of marijuana; it condemns expression of a particular \nviewpoint, i.e., that medical marijuana would likely help a specific patient”). Such \nspeech  regulations  require  application  of  strict  scrutiny,  which  the  Act  cannot \nwithstand. \nTo survive First Amendment review, content-based restrictions on speech \nmust be “narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests.” Reed, 576 U.S. at \n163. “It is rare that a regulation restricting speech because of its content will ever be \npermissible.” United States v. Playboy Ent. Grp., Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 818 (2000).  \nThe Act cannot satisfy this demanding test. First, preventing individuals from \nspeaking, and minors from discussing or hearing about medically necessary care \ndoes not advance Alabama’s stated interest in health and safety. The Act claims to \nfurther an interest in protecting minors, yet disregards the long-standing and well-\nestablished treatment of gender dysphoria recommended by every major medical \nassociation. No court has ever held that a state advances a compelling interest by \ndenying minors—a vulnerable group—medical treatment that is deemed necessary, \nsafe, and effective under the relevant medical standard of care. The State’s claimed \n37 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 46 of 63\ninterests collapse under strict scrutiny. See Wollschlaeger, 848 F.3d at 1317 (holding \nthat state’s asserted interest in protecting public health by prohibiting doctors from \nasking patients about firearm ownership could not satisfy heightened scrutiny where \n“the  applicable  standard  of  care  encourages  doctors  to  ask  questions  about \nfirearms”). \nSecond, the Act is not “narrowly tailored” to advance any asserted interest in \nhealth and safety. It prohibits speaking about certain treatments only with respect to \ntransgender  youth  with  gender  dysphoria  while  allowing  discussion  or \nrecommendations of the same or similar treatments for non-transgender youth for \nany other purpose or medical condition. Such “[u]nderinclusiveness raises serious \ndoubts about whether the government is in fact pursuing the interest it invokes, rather \nthan disfavoring a particular speaker or viewpoint.” Brown v. Ent. Merchants Ass’n, \n564 U.S. 786, 802 (2011). \nThird, the Act cannot withstand strict scrutiny because it is not the “least \nrestrictive means of achieving a compelling state interest.” McCullen, 573 U.S. at \n478. Banning every “person” in Alabama from engaging in an entire category of \nprotected speech—speech that is consistent with established standards of medical \ncare and with the Parent Plaintiffs’ view of what is best for their own children’s \nhealth and wellbeing—is not a constitutionally permissible means of protecting \nhealth and safety. The State cannot show that its enactment of “provisions broadly \n38 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 47 of 63\nrestricting truthful speech based on content” are the least restrictive means available \nto achieve a compelling need. Wollschlaeger, 848 F.3d at 1316.  \nLacking  a  narrowly  tailored  means  to  achieve  any  compelling  or  even \nlegitimate interest, the Act’s restrictions on speech cannot satisfy even rational basis \nreview,  much  less  strict  scrutiny.  Plaintiffs  have  a  substantial  likelihood  of \nprevailing on their free speech claim.   \n4.  The Act Is Unconstitutionally Vague (Count V). \nUnder the Due Process Clause, a criminal statute like the Act is void for \nvagueness if it fails to “define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that \nordinary  people  can  understand  what  conduct  is  prohibited”  and  encourages \n“arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement” by the government. Kolender v. Lawson, \n461  U.S.  352,  357  (1983);  see  also  Papachristou  v.  City  of  Jacksonville, \n405 U.S. 156, 162 (1972) (holding all persons “are entitled to be informed as to what \nthe State commands or forbids”) (quoting Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U.S. 451, 453 \n(1939)). \nSection 4(a) of the Act states that “no person shall . . . cause any of the \nfollowing practices to be performed upon a minor” and criminalizes any such act as \na felony. Yet, the Act fails to provide any standard to determine what an individual \nmust do to “cause” a treatment “to be performed upon a minor.” See Kolender, \n461 U.S. at 358.  \n39 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 48 of 63\n“Cause”  has  an  incredibly  broad  definition:  “To  bring  about  or  effect.” \nBlack’s Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019); cf. United States v. Eckhardt, 466 F.3d 938, \n944 (11th Cir. 2006) (directing courts to consider, among other things, “dictionaries” \nand the “common and generally accepted meaning” of words when considering \nvagueness of a statute).   \nTherefore, the Act, as worded, could subject anyone who is aware of, refers \nto, discusses, talks about, recommends, or expresses an opinion about a transgender \nminor’s healthcare to a class C felony and up to ten years imprisonment, no matter \nhow indirect the involvement, so long as the speech or behavior has any effect on a \nminor taking a prohibited medication to treat gender dysphoria. For example, the \nAct  could  impose  criminal  liability  on  a  doctor  or  therapist  in  Alabama  who \nrecommends  that  a  transgender  adolescent  start  or  continue  puberty  blocking \nmedication or hormones. It could impose criminal liability on a pastor, like Rev. \nEknes-Tucker,  who  counsels  parents  to  seek  medical  care  supporting  their \ntransgender children. It could impose criminal liability on a school nurse who \ndispenses a puberty-blocking medication to an adolescent, or a pharmacist who fills \na  prescription  for  estrogen  or  testosterone  for  a  minor—even  if  the  nurse  or \npharmacist  did  not  know  the  child  was  taking  the  medication  to  treat  gender \ndysphoria. See City of Chi. v. Morales, 527 U.S. 41, 55 (1999) (finding criminal \n40 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 49 of 63\nstatute that “contains no mens rea requirement” and “infringes on constitutionally \nprotected rights” to be “subject to facial attack” for vagueness).   \nDue to this vagueness, the Act encourages arbitrary enforcement and fails to \ndescribe what one must do to avoid criminal liability. See Lanzetta, 306 U.S. at 453 \n(“No one may be required at peril of life, liberty or property to speculate as to the \nmeaning of penal statutes.”).   \nB.  The Affordable Care Act Preempts the Act Because the Act \nMandates Sex Discrimination by Healthcare Providers \n(Count III).  \nThe Act is preempted by Section 1557 of the ACA. When a federal law and a \nstate  law  conflict,  the  state  law  is  preempted.  See,  e.g.,  Taylor  v.  Polhill, \n964 F.3d 975, 981 (11th Cir. 2020) (citing Hillsborough Cty. v. Automated Med. \nLabs., Inc., 471 U.S. 707, 712 (1985)). For example, states may not impose criminal \npenalties or “hold a civil defendant liable under state law for conduct federal law \nrequires.” Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 326 (2015). \nFederal  courts  are  empowered  to  “issue  an  injunction  upon  finding  the  state \nregulatory actions preempted.” Id.  \nFederal  courts  recognize  three  categories  of  preemption:  (1)  express \npreemption; (2) field preemption; and (3) conflict preemption. See Fla. State Conf. \nof N.A.A.C.P. v. Browning, 522 F.3d 1153, 1167 (11th Cir. 2008). This case involves \nthe third category, conflict preemption. “Conflict preemption . . . arises in instances \n41 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 50 of 63\nwhere  (1)  ‘compliance  with  both  federal  and  state  regulations  is  a  physical \nimpossibility,’  or  (2)  ‘the  challenged  state  law  stands  as  an  obstacle  to  the \naccomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.’” \nFresenius Med. Care Holdings, Inc. v. Tucker, 704 F.3d 935, 939 (11th Cir. 2013) \n(quoting Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 399 (2012) (citations and internal \nquotation marks omitted)). The Act is preempted because compliance would force \ncovered health care providers to violate Section 1557. Because compliance with both \nstatutes  is  impossible,  and  because  enforcement  of  the  Act  would  thwart  the \nfundamental purpose of Congress in prohibiting sex discrimination by covered \nhealthcare providers, federal law preempts the Act. \nThe  Act  prohibits  Alabama  doctors  from  providing  medical  care  to \ntransgender minors. But Section 1557 of the ACA prohibits such sex discrimination \nby health care providers receiving federal funds, including plaintiff doctors and other \nproviders from whom plaintiff children receive their care. Section 1557 provides that \nno individual shall “be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or \nbe subjected to discrimination under, any health program or activity, any part of \nwhich  is  receiving  Federal  financial  assistance,  including  credits,  subsidies,  or \ncontracts of insurance” on the basis of sex. 42 U.S.C. § 18116(a). As explained \nabove, the Act’s ban and criminalization of medications and surgeries only when \nprovided to a transgender individual is discrimination based on sex. See Bostock, \n42 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 51 of 63\n140 S. Ct. at 1741; Brumby, 663 F.3d at 1316. Violators of Section 1557 risk losing \nfederal funding, civil enforcement proceedings brought by the federal government, \ncivil lawsuits, debarment from doing business with the federal government, False \nClaims Act lawsuits, and criminal penalties. See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. § 1682; see also \nJolley  v.  Riverwoods  Behav.  Health,  LLC,  No.  1:21-CV-00561-WMR, \n2021 WL 6752161, at *5-6 (N.D. Ga. Aug. 30, 2021) (slip op.) (denying motion to \ndismiss private claim of Section 1557 ACA discrimination based on transgender \nstatus); Hammons v. Univ. of Md. Med. Sys. Corp., 551 F. Supp. 3d 567, 592 \n(D. Md. 2021) (finding plaintiff pled Section 1557 discrimination where hospital \nrefused to perform hysterectomy to treat gender dysphoria).  \nThe Transgender Plaintiffs receive their medical care from providers who \nreceive federal financial assistance and funding and who are subject to the non-\ndiscrimination provisions of Section 1557 of the ACA. See 42 U.S.C. § 18116(a). \n(See also Koe Decl ¶ 13.) In addition, the Healthcare Provider Plaintiffs are subject \nto Section 1557 of the ACA because they receive federal financial assistance as \nproviders of medical care for transgender beneficiaries of Alabama Medicaid. (See \nid. ¶ 13.) \nHealthcare Provider Plaintiffs cannot comply with both Section 1557 of the \nACA and the Act. They are put in the impossible position of complying with Section \n1557 by providing medical care to transgender minors consistent with the standard \n43 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 52 of 63\nof care, and risking criminal penalties under the Act, or complying with the Act and \nbeing  subject  to  federal  enforcement  proceedings  and  private  lawsuits  for \ndiscrimination  under  Section  1557.  See  Letter  from  Kristen  Clarke,  Assistant \nAttorney General at U.S. Dep’t of Justice Civil Rights Div., to State Attorneys \nGeneral  (Mar.  31,  2022),  available  at  https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-\nrelease/file/1489066/download (reminding state attorneys general that Section 1557 \nof the Affordable Care Act prohibits state laws that discriminate against transgender \npeople). As such, the ACA preempts the Act’s requirement that healthcare providers \nmust  deny  certain  types  of  medical  care  to  transgender  minors  based  on  their \ntransgender status. The Act puts healthcare providers in an impossible position and \nalso contravenes the overall goal of the ACA—to broaden access to healthcare in \nthe United States—as well as the specific purpose of Section 1557 to prevent \ndiscrimination in the provision of healthcare. See King v. Burwell, 576 U.S. 473, \n478-79 (2015). Because the Act conflicts with the ACA, it is preempted by federal \nlaw and may not be enforced.  \nIV.  The Act Will Cause Immediate, Irreparable Harm to Plaintiffs. \nWithout the injunctive relief sought, the Act will cause Plaintiffs to suffer \nserious irreparable harms.  \nFirst,  if  the  Act  is  not  enjoined,  the  Parent  Plaintiffs  will  be  forced  to \nhelplessly watch the harm to their children unfold because the Act deprives them of \n44 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 53 of 63\nthe  fundamental  constitutional  right  to  obtain  essential  medical  care  for  their \nchildren.  See  Brandt,  551  F.  Supp.  3d  at  892-93  (finding  parent  plaintiffs \ndemonstrated irreparable harm where act banning transition-related care for minors \ninfringed on their fundamental right to parent their children). Like other parents, \nthese Parent Plaintiffs want to be able to care for their children—to get their children \nthe medical care doctors have told them, and they have seen for themselves, is \nessential to their children’s ability to thrive. The Act inflicts serious, irreparable \nharm by barring the Parent Plaintiffs from acting in the best interests of their children \nin an area that lies at the heart of parental responsibilities and rights.  \nSecond, the Act also inflicts irreparable harm by depriving the Transgender \nPlaintiffs of necessary medical care for a serious medical condition. This denial will \ncause  irreversible  and  harmful  physical  changes  and  irreparable  mental  harm, \nincluding the reemergence of gender dysphoria which untreated will predictably \ncause them to suffer anxiety, depression, and severe psychological distress. Denial \nof medically necessary medical care is sufficient to show immediate and irreparable \nharm. See, e.g., Bowen v. City of New York, 476 U.S. 467, 483-84 (1986) (finding \ndenial of benefits caused irreparable injury by exposing plaintiffs to “severe medical \nsetback[s]” or hospitalization); Gayle v. Meade, -- F.Supp.3d --, No. 20-21553-CIV, \n2020 WL 3041326, at *20-21 (S.D. Fla. June 6, 2020) (holding that increased \nlikelihood of serious illness constitutes an irreparable injury); Flack v. Wis. Dep’t of \n45 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 54 of 63\nHealth Servs., 331 F.R.D. 361, 373 (W.D. Wis. 2019) (denying coverage for medical \ntreatment for gender dysphoria is irreparable harm); Karnoski v. Trump, No. C17-\n1297-MJP, 2017 WL 6311305, at *9 (W.D. Wash. Dec. 11, 2017) (finding that \ndenial of “transition-related medical care” constituted irreparable harm).  \nWithout the essential treatment Zachary needs, he will resume going through \nan unwanted female puberty that conflicts with his male identity, and he will suffer \ndevastating and irreversible physical and psychological consequences as a result. \n(Zoe Decl. ¶¶ 11-13.) Michael, whose mental health providers have recommended \nthat he be assessed for medical treatment of gender dysphoria, will be unable to \nobtain that care, which will exacerbate his gender dysphoria and force him to \nundergo harmful and unwanted physical changes that will be devastating to his \nphysical and mental health. (Boe Decl. ¶¶ 9, 15.) Christopher and Allison, who both \nare currently on hormone therapy and thriving as a result, will be cut off from this \nessential care. (Noe Decl. ¶¶ 15, 17-18; Poe Decl. ¶¶ 21-22.) Their bodies will \nundergo extremely distressing and unwanted physical changes that will cause them \nto suffer severe emotional and psychological distress. (See Noe Decl. ¶¶ 12, 18; Poe \nDecl.  ¶¶  23-25.)  These  harms  are  serious,  irreparable,  and  potentially \nlife-threatening. (Ladinsky Decl. ¶¶ 15-16; Rosenthal Decl. ¶¶ 37, 44-45, 55, 57; see \nalso Moe. Decl. ¶¶ 15-16.)  \n46 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 55 of 63\nAs the district court found in Brandt when enjoining a similar Arkansas law, \nbarring transgender youth from essential medical care forces them to “undergo \nendogenous puberty,” causing them to “live with physical characteristics that do not \nconform to their gender identity, putting them at high risk of gender dysphoria and \nlifelong physical and emotional pain.” 551 F. Supp. 3d at 892; see also Campbell v. \nKallas, No. 16-CV-261-JDP, 2020 WL 7230235, at *8 (W.D. Wis. Dec. 8, 2020) \n(slip  op.)  (finding  plaintiff  demonstrated  “irreparable  injury”  required  for  an \ninjunction where plaintiff “continues to suffer from gender dysphoria, which causes \nher anguish and puts her at risk of self-harm or suicide”). \nThird, enforcement of the Act will also inflict irreparable harm on Drs. Koe \nand Moe, who will face the ever-present threat of criminal prosecution and penalties \nif  they  continue  to  provide  medically  necessary  and  appropriate  referrals  and \ntreatments to their minor transgender patients, and who will be put to the untenable \nchoice of either risking arrest or harming their patients. See Brandt, 551 F. Supp. 3d \nat 891-92  (finding healthcare provider plaintiffs  proved irreparable harm when \nArkansas medical ban would force them to “choos[e] between breaking the law and \nproviding appropriate guidance and interventions for their transgender patients”).  \nAnd finally, enforcement of the Act will irreparably harm Rev. Eknes-Tucker \nby criminalizing his pastoral speech. “The loss of First Amendment freedoms, for \n47 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 56 of 63\neven minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.” Elrod \nv. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976) (plurality opinion). \nAs the Eleventh Circuit has explained, constitutional violations constitute \nirreparable harm when they cannot “be compensated for by monetary damages.”  Ne. \nFla. Chapter of Ass’n of Gen. Contractors v. City of Jacksonville, 896 F.2d 1283, \n1285 (11th Cir. 1990); see also Cate v. Oldham, 707 F.2d 1176, 1189 (11th Cir. \n1983) (holding that the directly penalizing free speech constitutes irreparable injury \nfor purposes of a preliminary injunction). No amount of money can compensate for \nthe Act’s infringement on a parents’ right to seek and obtain essential medical care \nfor their child. Nor can money compensate for the imposition of criminal penalties \non parents’ First Amendment right to seek information and recommendations from \nhealthcare providers, on doctors’ constitutionally protected freedom to share their \nopinions and expertise with their patients, or on a pastor’s rights to counsel families \nconsistent with his faith-based beliefs. The enforcement of the Act in violation of \nthese  fundamental  rights  inflicts  irreparable  harm  and  warrants  entry  of  a \npreliminary injunction.  \nV.  Injuries to Plaintiffs Outweigh Any Damage to the State, Which Has No \nInterest in Enforcing an Unconstitutional Law.  \nThe serious irreparable harms that Plaintiffs will experience if the Act takes \neffect outweigh any countervailing government interest. When “the nonmovant is \nthe government, . . . the third and fourth requirements [for an injunction]—‘damage \n48 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 57 of 63\nto the opposing party’ and ‘public interest’—can be consolidated.” Otto v. City of \nBoca Raton, 981 F.3d 854, 870 (11th Cir. 2020); see also Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. \n418, 435 (2009) (same). Moreover, there is no “legitimate interest in enforcing an \nunconstitutional ordinance.” Otto, 981 F.3d at 870; see also KH Outdoor, LLC v. \nCity of Trussville, 458 F.3d 1261, 1272 (11th Cir. 2006). \nThe balance of the equities strongly favors an injunction here. On the one side, \nthe State is seeking to enforce an injurious, unconstitutional, and discriminatory law. \nIn sharp contrast, the Act will impose significant irreparable harms on transgender \nyoung people, their parents, healthcare providers, and faith leaders like Rev. Eknes-\nTucker. Plaintiffs will be forced to watch their children suffer the harm of losing the \nmedical care they need and of experiencing the mental anguish and pain of untreated \ngender dysphoria. The Transgender Plaintiffs will abruptly lose essential medical \ncare, be forced to undergo irreversible physical changes, and suffer intense suffering \nand distress. The Healthcare Provider Plaintiffs will be forced to choose between \nimprisonment and inflicting harm on vulnerable patients, as they cannot provide the \nmedical care consistent with the recognized standard of care that they believe to be \nin their patients’ best interest. \nTo be sure, the balance of the equities strongly favors an injunction here. An \ninjunction  would  maintain  the  status  quo  while  Plaintiffs  pursue  their  claims. \nPlaintiffs can continue to meet their children’s medical needs, transgender young \n49 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 8   Filed 04/21/22   Page 58 of 63\npeople can continue to receive recommended, medically necessary treatment for \ntheir gender dysphoria, healthcare providers can continue to treat their patients \nwithout fear of prosecution, and faith leaders can continue to counsel families \nconsistent with their religious beliefs while this case is litigated. \nVI.  CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court enjoin \nthe State from implementing Act while this lawsuit is pending. Plaintiffs further \nrequest the Court to enter a temporary restraining order if the Court is unable to rule \non Plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motion before May 8, 2022, when the law is \nscheduled to go into effect.  \nRespectfully submitted this 21st day of April, 2022. \n           \n/s/ Melody H.

This  Action  is  a  federal  constitutional  challenge  to  the  State  of \nAlabama’s Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act (the “Act”), passed by \nthe Alabama Legislature on April 7, 2022, and signed into law by Governor Kay \nIvey on April 8, 2022. The Act became effective on May 8, 2022 and was in effect \n2 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 146   Filed 08/09/22   Page 3 of 42\n \nuntil this Court granted Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction on May 13, \n2022. See Doc. 107. \n2.  The Act intrudes into the right of parents to make medical decisions to \nensure the health and wellbeing of their children. It does so by prohibiting parents \nfrom  seeking  and  obtaining  appropriate  medical  care  for  their  children  and \nsubjecting them to criminal prosecution if they do so. \n3.  The Act also targets transgender minors by imposing criminal penalties \non any individuals, including parents and health care providers, who obtain or \nprovide medical treatments essential to the minors’ health care needs. \n4.  Further, the Act is worded broadly, criminalizing anyone who “causes” \nan individual to receive the prohibited medical treatments, so that doctors, parents, \nand even clergy cannot discuss, advise, or counsel parents of transgender minors \nabout how to address their children’s medical needs. \n5.  Plaintiffs  seek  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  to  enjoin  the \nenforcement  of  the  Act.  Without  the  injunctive  relief  sought,  Plaintiffs  will \nexperience irreparable injury.  \nPARTIES \nI.  Transgender Plaintiffs and Their Parents \n6.

Plaintiffs seek redress for the deprivation of their rights secured by \nSection 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, the United States Constitution, and the \nequitable powers of this Court to enjoin unlawful official conduct. This action is \ninstituted pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 18116 and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to enjoin Defendants \nfrom enforcing the Act and for a declaration that the Act violates federal law. \nTherefore, this Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 \nand 1343. \n8 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 146   Filed 08/09/22   Page 9 of 42\n \n22.  This  Court  has  personal  jurisdiction  over  Defendants  because \nDefendants are domiciled in Alabama and the denial of Plaintiffs’ rights guaranteed \nby federal law occurred within Alabama.  \n23.  All Defendants reside in Alabama, and, upon information and belief, \nDefendants Marshall, Bailey, Ventiere, and Anderson reside in this judicial district. \nTherefore, venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1). \n24.  If  enforced,  the  Act  would  violate  the  federal  statutory  and \nconstitutional rights of Plaintiffs in this judicial district. Therefore, venue is also \nproper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C § 1391(b)(2). \n25.  This Court has the authority to enter a declaratory judgment and to \nprovide preliminary and permanent injunctive relief pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 57 \nand 65, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202, and this Court’s inherent equitable powers.  \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nI.  Gender Identity and Gender Dysphoria \n26.  Gender identity is an innate, internal sense of one’s sex and is an \nimmutable aspect of a person’s identity. Everyone has a gender identity. Most \npeople’s gender identity is consistent with their birth sex. Transgender people, \nhowever, have a gender identity that differs from their birth sex.  \n27.  Gender dysphoria is the clinical diagnosis for the distress that arises \nwhen  a  person’s  gender  identity  does  not  match  their  birth  sex.  To  receive  a \n9 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 146   Filed 08/09/22   Page 10 of 42\n \ndiagnosis of gender dysphoria, a young person must meet the criteria set forth in the \nAm. Psychiatric Ass’n, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th \ned.  2013)  (“DSM-5”).1  If  left  untreated,  gender  dysphoria  can  cause  anxiety, \ndepression, and self-harm, including suicidality.  \n28.  In fact, 56% of transgender youth reported a previous suicide attempt \nand 86% of them reported suicidality. See Austin, Ashley, Shelley L. Craig, Sandra \nD. Souza, and Lauren B. McInroy (2022), Suicidality Among Transgender Youth: \nElucidating the Role of Interpersonal Risk Factors. J. of Interpersonal Violence. \nVol. 37 (5–6) NP2696-NP2718. \n29.  Research has shown that an individual’s gender identity is biologically \nbased and cannot be changed. In the past, mental health professionals sought to treat \ngender dysphoria by attempting to change the person’s gender identity to match their \nbirth sex; these efforts were unsuccessful and caused serious harms. Today, the \nmedical profession generally recognizes that such efforts put minors at risk of \nserious harm, including dramatically increased rates of suicidality.  \n \n1 Earlier editions of the DSM included a diagnosis referred to as “Gender Identity \nDisorder.” The DSM-5 noted that Gender Dysphoria “is more descriptive than the \nprevious DSM-IV term gender identity disorder and focuses on dysphoria as the \nclinical  problem,  not  identity  per  se.  Being  diagnosed  with  gender  dysphoria \n“implies  no  impairment  in  judgment,  stability,  reliability,  or  general  social  or \nvocational  capabilities.”  Am.  Psychiatric  Ass’n,  Position  Statement  on \nDiscrimination Against Transgender & Gender Variant Individuals (2012). \n10 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 146   Filed 08/09/22   Page 11 of 42\n \n30.  Gender  dysphoria  is  highly  treatable.  Healthcare  providers  who \nspecialize in the treatment of gender dysphoria follow a well-established standard of \ncare that has been adopted by the major medical and mental health associations in \nthe United States including, but not limited to, the American Medical Association, \nthe  American  Academy  of  Pediatrics,  the  American  Association  of  Child  and \nAdolescent Psychiatrists, the Pediatric Endocrine Society, the American Psychiatric \nAssociation, the American Psychological Association, and the Endocrine Society.  \n31.  The standards of care for treatment of transgender people, including \ntransgender youth, were initially developed by the World Professional Association \nfor  Transgender  Health  (“WPATH”),  an  international,  multidisciplinary, \nprofessional association of medical providers, mental health providers, researchers, \nand  others,  with  a  mission  of  promoting  evidence-based  care  and  research  for \ntransgender health, including the treatment of gender dysphoria. WPATH published \nthe most recent edition of the Standards of Care for the treatment of gender dysphoria \nin minors and adults in 2011 and is in the process of finalizing a revised edition of \nthe Standards of Care, which will likely be published later this year. \n32.  The Endocrine Society has also promulgated a standard of care for the \nprovision of hormone therapy as a treatment for gender dysphoria in minors and \nadults.  See  Wylie  C.  Hembree,  et  al.,  Endocrine  Treatment  of  Gender-\n11 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 146   Filed 08/09/22   Page 12 of 42\n \nDysphoric/Gender-Incongruent Persons: An Endocrine Society Clinical Practice \nGuideline, 102 J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 3869 (2017).  \n33.  The  American  Medical  Association,  the  American  Academy  of \nPediatrics, the American Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists, the \nPediatric Endocrine Society, the American Psychiatric Association, the American \nPsychological Association, and other professional medical organizations also follow \nthe WPATH and Endocrine Society standards of care.  \n34.  The treatment of gender dysphoria is designed to reduce a transgender \nperson’s psychological distress by permitting them to live in alignment with their \ngender identity. Undergoing treatment for gender dysphoria is commonly referred to \nas transition. There are several components to the transition process: social, legal, \nmedical, and surgical. Each of these components is part of the medically approved \nprocess for transition, some or all of which a transgender person may undertake as \npart of their transition.  \n35.  Social transition typically involves adopting a new name, pronouns, \nhairstyle, and clothing that match that person’s gender identity, and treating that \nperson consistent with their gender identity in all aspects of their life, including \nhome, school, and everyday life. Following those steps, transgender people often \nobtain a court order legally changing their name and, where possible, changing the \nsex listed on their birth certificate and other identity documents.  \n12 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 146   Filed 08/09/22   Page 13 of 42\n \n36.  For transgender people who have begun puberty, it may be appropriate \nfor them to start taking puberty-blocking medication and later hormone-replacement \ntherapy to ensure their body develops in a manner consistent with their gender \nidentity.  \n37.  Finally,  surgical  treatment  may  in  some  cases  be  part  of  essential \nmedical care for a transgender individual. The only surgical treatment available to \ntransgender minors is male chest reconstruction surgery, a procedure to remove \nexisting breast tissue and create a male chest contour for transgender males. Like all \ntreatments  for  gender  dysphoria,  male  chest  reconstruction  surgery  is  safe  and \neffective in treating gender dysphoria. The medical necessity of surgical care is \ndetermined on a case-by-case basis that considers the age of the patient, medical \nneed,  and  appropriateness  of  the  procedure  relative  to  the  psychological \ndevelopment of the individual. \n38.  Longitudinal studies have shown that children with gender dysphoria \nwho  receive  essential  medical  care  show  levels  of  mental  health  and  stability \nconsistent with those of non-transgender children. Lily Durwood, et al., Mental \nHealth and Self-Worth in Socially Transitioned Transgender Youth, 56 J. Am. Acad. \nChild & Adolescent Psychiatry 116 (2017); Kristina Olson, et al., Mental Health of \nTransgender  Children  who  are  Supported  in  Their  Identities,  137  Pediatrics  1 \n(2016). In contrast, children with gender dysphoria who do not receive appropriate \n13 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 146   Filed 08/09/22   Page 14 of 42\n \nmedical care are at risk of serious harm, including dramatically increased rates of \nsuicidality and serious depression. \nII.  The Alabama Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act \n39.  On April 8, 2022, Governor Kay Ivey signed the Act into law. The Act \nbecame effective on May 8, 2022, and remained in effect until this Court granted \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction on May 13, 2022. See Doc. 107. \n40.  The  Act  prevents  parents  from  consenting  to,  and  healthcare \nprofessionals from providing, well-established medically necessary care.  The Act \nalso  applies  to  any  individual  who  “cause[s]”  such  care  to  be  provided  to  a \ntransgender minor.  \n41.  Specifically, subsection 4(a) of the Act provides that:  \nExcept  as  provided  in  subsection  (b),  no  person  shall \nengage in or cause any of the following practices to be \nperformed upon a minor if the practice is performed for \nthe purpose of attempting to alter the appearance of or \naffirm the minor’s perception of his or her gender or sex, \nif that appearance or perception is inconsistent with the \nminor’s sex as defined in this act: \n \n(1)  Prescribing  or  administering  puberty  blocking \nmedication to stop or delay normal puberty. \n(2)  Prescribing  or  administering  supraphysiologic \ndoses  of  testosterone  or  other  androgens  to \nfemales. \n(3)  Prescribing  or  administering  supraphysiologic \ndoses of estrogen to males. \n14 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 146   Filed 08/09/22   Page 15 of 42\n \n(4)  Performing  surgeries  that  sterilize,  including \ncastration,  vasectomy,  hysterectomy, \noophorectomy, orchiectomy, and penectomy. \n(5)  Performing  surgeries  that  artificially  construct \ntissue with the appearance of genitalia that differs \nfrom  the  individual’s  sex,  including \nmetoidioplasty, phalloplasty, and vaginoplasty. \n(6)  Removing any healthy or non-diseased body part \nor tissue, except for a male circumcision. \n \n42.  A violation of subsection 4(a) of the Act is a Class C felony, punishable \nupon conviction by up to 10 years imprisonment or a fine of up to $15,000. \n43.  As  a  result  of  subsection  4(a)  of  the  Act,  medical  professionals, \nincluding the Healthcare Provider Plaintiffs, and parents of transgender minors, \nincluding the Parent Plaintiffs, are forced to choose between withholding medically \nnecessary treatment from their minor transgender patients or children, on the one \nhand, or facing criminal prosecution, on the other.  Moreover, the broad language of \nthe Act imposes content-based restrictions on discussions, counseling, or referrals \nregarding  gender  dysphoria  treatments  for  well-recognized  in  the  medical \ncommunity that may result in such care being provided to a transgender minor.   \nIII.  The Act Will Irreparably Harm the Plaintiffs  \nBrianna Boe and Michael Boe \n44.  Michael Boe is a 12-year-old transgender boy who resides with his \nmother in Montgomery County, Alabama. \n15 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 146   Filed 08/09/22   Page 16 of 42\n \n45.  In his early years, Michael was a happy, outgoing child. But at nine \nyears old, Michael became depressed and anxious. Michael also started struggling \nacademically and socially.  \n46.  Michael eventually confided in his mother that he felt as though he was \nnot like other girls and was worried about being judged by his classmates. He also \nreported that he was being bullied in school. Brianna placed Michael in a new school \nfor the following school year and brought him to a therapist to help him with his \ndepression.  \n47.  Michael began to talk with Brianna about his male gender identity and \nthe distress and discomfort he was experiencing as he entered puberty, as his body \nbegan to develop in ways that were inconsistent with his sense of self.  \n48.  In June 2021, Michael told his mother that he is transgender. With \nsupport from his family and a mental health provider experienced in working with \ntransgender youth, Michael began to socially transition, including adopting a male \nname and pronouns and generally living as a boy in all aspects of his life.  \n49.  Since Michael began to socially transition, his mood has improved \ngreatly. His therapist recently recommended that Michael be evaluated for additional \nmedical treatment to address the mismatch between his body and his gender identity.   \n50.  In February 2022, Brianna reached out to the Children’s Hospital of \nAlabama to make an initial appointment for Michael.  If this law goes into effect, \n16 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 146   Filed 08/09/22   Page 17 of 42\n \nhowever, that appointment will be cancelled, and Michael will have to further delay \nhis assessment for critical medical care. \nMegan Poe and Allison Poe \n51.  Allison Poe is a 15-year-old transgender girl who resides with her \nmother, Megan Poe, in Cullman County, Alabama. \n52.  As a young child, Allison showed interest in girls’ toys and clothing. \nThinking this was a phase, her parents initially refused to buy Allison any girl toys. \nWithout asking, Allison’s grandmother bought Allison a Barbie doll. Allison was so \nhappy and carried it everywhere.  \n53.  When the family returned to the United States from her father’s military \ndeployment abroad, Allison would become very upset when her mother refused to \nbuy her girls’ clothes. As a compromise, Megan bought Allison a few girls’ toys. \nEventually, Allison’s father found them and attempted to throw them away, but \nAllison’s brother snuck them back into the house. \n54.  When Allison was around nine years old, her personality began to \nchange significantly. She became withdrawn, quiet, showed signs of depression, and \nregularly commented that she wanted to die. She also stopped eating regularly. \nAllison’s  actions  became  so  worrisome  to  Megan  that  she  consulted  with  a \npediatrician.  The  pediatrician  suggested  that  Allison  may  be  transgender  and \nreferred them to the gender clinic at UAB Hospital.   \n17 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 146   Filed 08/09/22   Page 18 of 42\n \n55.  After evaluating Allison, the team of clinicians educated Megan about \nwhat Allison was experiencing and gave her advice about how to support Allison. \nThat visit was a turning point for Megan. She became supportive of Allison, helping \nher redecorate her room and buying her girls’ clothes. The first time Allison came \nout of her room in girls’ clothes, she was beaming with joy. \n56.  By fifth grade, many of Allison’s peers had started showing the first \nsigns of puberty, and Allison became scared about going through a male puberty.  In \nanticipation of her starting puberty, Allison started the process to be evaluated for \npuberty-blocking medication.  \n57.  About seven months ago, just as Allison was beginning high school, \nshe was evaluated for and eventually started on estrogen.  Her mental health has \nimproved dramatically; she is confident, social, and doing well in school. \n58.  If the Act is allowed to go into effect, Allison’s medical care will be \ndisrupted, which would cause Allison extreme anxiety and distress. She will develop \nphysical traits that are inconsistent with her identity as a girl that will require her to \nundergo otherwise avoidable surgeries in the future as an adult.  \nKathy Noe and Christopher Noe \n59.  Christopher Noe is a 17-year-old transgender boy who resides with his \nmother, Kathy Noe, in Lee County, Alabama. Christopher and Kathy have deep roots \nin Alabama, having moved to the State just before Christopher turned 4 years old.  \n18 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 146   Filed 08/09/22   Page 19 of 42\n \nKathy is former active-duty military, while Christopher’s father is still active-duty \nmilitary and is deployed abroad.   \n60.  Since Christopher was a toddler, he resisted attempts to dress him as a \ngirl. For example, he refused to attend his sixth-grade graduation because doing so \nmeant he would have to wear a dress.   \n61.  As Christopher began to enter puberty, his distress at the changes his \nbody was undergoing and at being made to present as female intensified.  \n62.  When Christopher was 14, he told his mother he is transgender. Kathy \nfound  Christopher  a  therapist  experienced  in  working  with  transgender  young \npeople. The therapist helped both Christopher and Kathy navigate the beginning \nstages of Christopher’s transition. \n63.  About a year later, Christopher came out to his father as transgender. \nChristopher’s father struggled initially, but because of his love for Christopher, his \nfather began to accept Christopher for who he is.  \n64.  With his father’s support, Kathy took Christopher to a physician to \nbegin  the  evaluation  for  hormone-replacement  therapy.  Because  Kathy  and \nChristopher live close to the Alabama-Georgia state line, Christopher’s doctors are \nin  Columbus,  Georgia.  Christopher’s  prescriptions,  however,  are  filled  at  a \npharmacy in Alabama. \n19 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 146   Filed 08/09/22   Page 20 of 42\n \n65.  Christopher  began  hormone  replacement  therapy  in  March  2022. \nChristopher has been noticeably happier. He is bubbly and more outgoing and is \nconfident at work and around other people. \n66.  If the Act is allowed to go into effect, Christopher’s medical care will \nbe  disrupted,  which  will  have  devastating  and  irreversible  physical  and \npsychological consequences. \nRebecca Roe and Melissa Roe \n67.  Melissa is a nine-year-old transgender girl who lives with her mother, \nstepparent, and stepsibling in Jefferson County, Alabama. \n68.  When Melissa was about three, she began expressing a preference for \nwearing girls’ clothing and having long hair. At preschool, Melissa would dress up \nin girls’ clothing every day, spending the whole day in dresses. \n69.  Over time, Melissa continued to express a strong preference for girls’ \nclothing and would become angry and distressed when others would refer to her or \ntreat her like a boy.  \n70.  In  first  grade,  Melissa  increasingly  asserted  that  she  is  a  girl.  For \nexample, Melissa consistently grouped herself with the other girls in the class when \nthe teacher separated the class by boys and girls. About a month into the school year, \nRebecca learned from Melissa’s teacher that Melissa asked to be referred to as a girl \nin school.  Around the same time, Melissa also told her mother, “I am a girl.”  \n20 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 146   Filed 08/09/22   Page 21 of 42\n \n71.  Rebecca reached out to Melissa’s pediatrician for support and Melissa \nalso began seeing a new therapist.  \n72.  Melissa’s pediatrician referred Melissa to the clinic at UAB. Melissa \nhad her first appointment in spring 2021. Her next appointment is in December 2022. \n73.  With puberty approaching, Melissa is starting to show signs of distress \nin anticipation of the physical changes that accompany puberty and is concerned that \nshe will be perceived by others as a boy.  \n74.  During their prior visits, Rebecca had extensive conversations with \ndoctors at the clinic about the risks and benefits of puberty blockers and feels very \nwell informed about treatment options for Melissa’s gender dysphoria. If and when \nMelissa’s doctors indicate that puberty blockers are medically necessary to treat \nMelissa’s gender dysphoria, Rebecca plans to carefully review the consent forms \nand  ensure  she  fully  understands  them  before  consenting  to  treatment.  Given \nMelissa’s prior difficulties with behavior, Rebecca is concerned that Melissa will \nattempt to hurt herself if Melissa does not obtain appropriate treatment for her gender \ndysphoria. \n75.  If  Melissa  were  unable  to  access  necessary  medical  treatment  in \nAlabama, it would not only harm her, but her whole family as well. Rebecca, a \nprofessor at a public university, would be forced to leave Alabama in order to protect \n21 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 146   Filed 08/09/22   Page 22 of 42\n \nMelissa. That move would tear her family apart as Rebecca’s husband and his \ndaughter—Melissa’s stepfather and stepsibling—are unable to leave Alabama. \nRobert Voe and April Voe \n76.  April is a twelve-year-old transgender girl who lives with her parents \nand three siblings in Florida, but has been a patient at the UAB clinic for several \nyears. \n77.  April started showing an interest in typical girls’ clothing and toys from \na very early age.  \n78.  During preschool, April would always have a change of clothes in her \nbackpack in case she got dirty or needed clean clothes. Her parents would allow \nApril to pick out the clothes she would bring, and she always chose girls’ clothes. \nAt preschool, April would not even wait to get dirty before changing into her back-\nup set of clothes. The staff at the daycare would then eventually coax April back into \nboys’ clothes, which was very upsetting for April. After learning about this, April’s \nparents spoke with the daycare about allowing April to wear whatever clothes she \nwanted. April’s preference for girls’ clothing did not seem like anything more than \na phase, but they wanted to give April the latitude to play out her imagination. \n79.  By age four, April became quite insistent that she is a girl. After taking \na bath one night, April expressed intense distress to her mother about her penis.  \nUnsurprisingly, that caused April’s parents to realize that this may not be a phase, \n22 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 146   Filed 08/09/22   Page 23 of 42\n \nand that April needed to see a mental health professional who could help April and \nher parents navigate this issue. \n80.  April’s parents found a psychologist with experience working with \nchildren experiencing gender dysphoria. After evaluating April, the psychologist \nrecommended using female pronouns when referring to April. Although a seemingly \nsmall change, April’s parents saw a significant positive change in her attitude and \nbehavior following her social transition. \n81.  Even though April’s dysphoria had noticeably subsided since her social \ntransition, April’s parents wanted to get the advice of a medical doctor to ensure they \nwere doing everything they could to keep April healthy. When they first started \nlooking for a medical provider with experience working with transgender children, \nRobert’s mother, a retired healthcare provider in Birmingham, suggested that they \ncontact  a  doctor  at  the  UAB  clinic.  Finding  a  doctor  they  could  trust  was  of \nparamount  importance  to  April’s  parents.  Thus,  they  decided  to  make  the \napproximately ten-hour drive for April to be seen at the UAB clinic. \n82.  April’s first appointment with the UAB clinic occurred in September \n2019. She had been going for annual visits at the clinic until recently when they \nstarted going more frequently given how close April is to the beginning of puberty. \nApril’s next appointment at the clinic is in September 2022. April’s mother is a nurse \nand based on what April is reporting to her, April’s parents anticipate that April will \n23 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 146   Filed 08/09/22   Page 24 of 42\n \nhave reached the onset of puberty by the September appointment, and that it may be \ntime for her to begin puberty blockers. \n83.  April’s parents have done research on their own to learn about the \ntreatment options for gender dysphoria, including puberty blockers. At the next \nappointment and provided that April’s doctor indicates that puberty blockers are \nmedically  necessary,  April’s  parents  plan  to  discuss  this  treatment  option  and \nthoroughly review all the materials provided by April’s doctor and the clinic and to \nmake sure they fully understand the risks and benefits of this treatment before \nconsenting. \n84.  Not being able to get puberty blockers when it is medically necessary \nfor April would be devastating for April. There is no doubt in April’s parents’ minds \nthat if April had to go through male puberty, she would attempt to harm herself and \nthat her mental health would decline. \n85.  If SB 184 is allowed to go into effect, it would block April’s ability to \nobtain the care she needs. Being unable to receive puberty blocking medication \nwould result in physical changes to her body and appearance that would exacerbate \nher gender dysphoria, causing long-lasting harm to her physical and mental health. \n24 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 146   Filed 08/09/22   Page 25 of 42\n \nDr. Rachel Koe \n86.  Dr. Rachel Koe is a board-certified pediatrician in southeast Alabama. \nOver  the  past  decade,  Dr.  Koe  has  treated  a  handful  of  transgender  patients, \nincluding one current patient for whom she provides primary care.  \n87.  Depending on the needs of the patient, Dr. Koe has referred patients \nand their parents to local mental health providers as well as the gender clinic at UAB \nHospital. Even after referral, Dr. Koe remains involved with her patients’ care. For \nexample, Dr. Koe’s office draws blood for their patient’s regular blood work in \nadvance of appointments with the gender clinic. Additionally, she and her staff \nprovide support to patients who need assistance in self-administering injectable \nmedications like testosterone. \n88.  Dr. Koe is familiar with the standards of care for the treatment of gender \ndysphoria and the medical literature regarding those treatments. She has also seen \nthe significant positive effects medical treatment for gender dysphoria has had on \nthe health and wellbeing of her patients.  \n89.  If the Act goes into effect, Dr. Koe would be forced to choose between \ncomplying  with  the  Act  and  the  medical  needs  of  her  current  and  any  future \ntransgender patients whose mental and physical health will deteriorate if denied \nongoing medical treatment for their gender dysphoria. The Act forces Dr. Koe to \nviolate her professional and ethical obligations as a physician by denying her patients \n25 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 146   Filed 08/09/22   Page 26 of 42\n \naccess  to  a  course  of  treatment  that  is  evidence-based  and  consistent  with  the \nestablished standards of care.  \n90.  Dr. Koe would also be required to curtail her speech as she would no \nlonger be allowed to provide accurate and comprehensive information to parents and \nabout medically necessary treatment options for gender dysphoria and would be \nprohibited from making referrals to specialists who could prescribe those treatments.  \n91.  Changing her practice in those ways would also require Dr. Koe to \nviolate  her  legal  obligation  as  a  Medicaid  provider  to  not  discriminate  in  the \nprovision of medical care to her transgender patients. Ignoring that obligation would \njeopardize her ability to provide primary medical care in rural southeast Alabama. \nHeather Austin, Ph.D. \n92.  Dr. Heather Austin is a doctoral-level clinical child psychologist with a \nspecialty in child development who currently practices in a hospital setting within \nthe UAB System. Dr. Austin has been a practicing clinical psychologist for twenty \nyears and has experience working with children and adolescents with a variety of \nmental health issues. For the past two years, part of Dr. Austin’s practice has been \ndedicated to mental health treatment and evaluation of transgender young people. \n93.  Dr. Austin’s work with transgender patients is guided by the well-\nestablished standards of care and the hospital’s informed-consent protocol. Her \nassessment process engages both the patient and the patient’s parents and requires a \n26 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 146   Filed 08/09/22   Page 27 of 42\n \nminimum of three to four visits. It is quite common for the assessment to require \nadditional  visits,  but  that  determination  is  made  on  a  case-by-case  basis  and \ndependent on the needs of the patient and the patient’s family. \n94.  In order to conduct her assessment, Dr. Austin gathers information \nabout the patient from questionnaires, rating scales, and discussions with the patient \nand the patient’s family. Pulling from multiple sources provides Dr. Austin with the \ninformation she needs to determine whether the patient meets the diagnostic criteria \nfor gender dysphoria as outlined in the DSM-5.  \n95.  Once she has made, or confirmed, the diagnosis, Dr. Austin then begins \ntaking the patient and the patient’s parents through the informed-consent protocol. \nAs required by the protocol, she has detailed discussions about the risks and benefits \nof the particular medical treatment being considered by the patient and their medical \nprovider. Because of the large amount of information that is reviewed as part of the \ninformed-consent protocol, this discussion can occur over multiple sessions and \nsometimes Dr. Austin will have separate sessions with the patient and the parent(s) \nto give each person an opportunity to ask questions and engage with the information \nbeing provided.  \n96.  After completing the informed-consent protocol, Dr. Austin writes a \nletter to the patient’s medical provider detailing the results of her assessment. That \nletter will include, for example, an overview of the patient’s mental health and, if \n27 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 146   Filed 08/09/22   Page 28 of 42\n \nneeded, recommendations on follow up mental health care. Although the letter \ndiscusses  a  patient’s  readiness  to  proceed  with  treatment,  Dr.  Austin  always \nrecommends in the letter that the medical provider conduct a further assessment \nbefore initiating treatment.  \n97.  If enforced, the Act will prevent Dr. Austin from continuing to treat \ntransgender patients in a manner that is consistent with the applicable standards of \ncare. She would not be able to provide the level of detailed information or engage in \nin-depth conversations with her transgender patients or the patient’s parents about \nmedical treatments for gender dysphoria. Practicing this way would require Dr. \nAustin to violate her professional and ethical obligations. Unwilling to do so, Dr. \nAustin fears that she will be subject to criminal prosecution under the Act. \n98.  Dr. Austin is also concerned for the health and wellbeing of her patients \nshould the Act go into effect. She has witnessed the significant distress her patients \nexperience before starting medical treatment and the tremendous positive effects \nthose treatments have on her patients’ mental health. Without access to that critical \ncare, Dr. Austin worries that her patients’ mental health will deteriorate in ways that \nwill interfere with their ability to function and cause lasting harm to their health and \nwellbeing, including developing substance use issues and increased suicidality. \n28 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 146   Filed 08/09/22   Page 29 of 42\n \nReverend Paul A. Eknes-Tucker \n99.  Reverend  Eknes-Tucker  is  the  Senior  Pastor  at  Pilgrim  Church  in \nBirmingham, Alabama. The church was established in 1903 and is part of the United \nChurch of Christ. The core tenet of the congregation is to love and support all people \nto be their true and authentic selves. As such, his faith compels him to support and \nencourage parents to love and affirm their transgender children.   \n100.  As a pastor, Reverend Eknes-Tucker provides pastoral counseling to \nfamilies of transgender children who are often uncertain about what guidance their \nfaith can provide, as they try to figure out how to support their children who are \nexperiencing gender dysphoria.   \n101.  During  these  pastoral  counseling  sessions,  parents  of  transgender \nchildren share their worries and fears as well as hopes and aspirations for their \ntransgender children’s future. Reverend Eknes-Tucker and the parents extensively \ndiscuss  the  application  of  their  faith’s  teachings  to  each  family’s  unique \ncircumstances. He also strives to answer questions and provide information to help \nparents make decisions about what is best for their children, including whether to \nconsent to particular medical treatments, by accounting for their child’s spiritual \nwellbeing in that decision-making process.  \n29 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 146   Filed 08/09/22   Page 30 of 42\n \n102.  This  includes  counseling  parents  to  seek  the  advice  of  other \nprofessionals, such as medical providers and mental health professionals, as needed, \nto further assist their children. \n103.  If this Act comes into effect, Reverend Eknes-Tucker is concerned for \nthe spiritual and mental wellbeing of families he has counseled because he has seen \nthe benefits that pastoral counseling has provided the families he has worked with. \nBecause of the content of Reverend Eknes-Tucker’s pastoral counseling sessions \nwith parents raising transgender children, he will face criminal penalties for his \npastoral work as it could “cause” a transgender minor to begin medical treatments \nfor their gender dysphoria. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \nDeprivation of Substantive Due Process \nParent Plaintiffs Against Defendants in Their Official Capacities \nViolation of Parent Plaintiffs’ Right to Direct the Upbringing of Their Children \nU.S. Const. Amend. XIV \n104.  Plaintiffs incorporate all preceding paragraphs of the Complaint as if \nset forth fully herein. \n105.  The Parent Plaintiffs bring this Count against all Defendants.  \n106.  The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects \nthe rights of parents to make decisions “concerning the care, custody, and control of \ntheir children.” Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 66, 120 S. Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d \n49 (2000). That fundamental right includes the liberty to make medical decisions for \n30 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 146   Filed 08/09/22   Page 31 of 42\n \ntheir  minor  children,  including  the  right  to  obtain  medical  treatments  that  are \nrecognized to be safe, effective, and medically necessary to protect their children’s \nhealth and well-being.  \n107.  The  Act  violates  this  fundamental  right  by  preventing  the  Parent \nPlaintiffs from obtaining medically necessary care for their minor children.  \n108.  By intruding upon parents’ fundamental right to direct the upbringing \nof their children, the Act is subject to strict scrutiny.  \n109.  Defendants have no compelling justification for preventing parents \nfrom ensuring their children can receive essential medical care. The Act does not \nadvance any legitimate interest, much less a compelling one. \nCOUNT II \nDeprivation of Equal Protection \n All Plaintiffs Against Defendants in Their Official Capacities \nU.S. Const. Amend. XIV \n110.  Plaintiffs incorporate all preceding paragraphs of the Complaint as if \nset forth fully herein. \n111.  All Plaintiffs bring this Count against all Defendants.  \n112.  The  Equal  Protection  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment, \nenforceable pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, provides that no state shall “deny to any \nperson within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” U.S. Const. Amend. \nXIV, § 1. \n31 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 146   Filed 08/09/22   Page 32 of 42\n \n113.  The  Act  singles  out  transgender  minors  and  prohibits  them  from \nobtaining medically necessary treatment based on their sex and transgender status. \n114.  The Act also treats transgender minors differently and less favorably \nthan non-transgender minors by allowing minors who are not transgender to obtain \nthe  same  medical  treatments  that  are  prohibited  when  medically  necessary  for \ntransgender minors.  \n115.  Under the Equal Protection Clause, government classifications based \non sex are subject to heightened scrutiny and are presumptively unconstitutional. \n116.  Transgender-based  government  classifications  are  subject,  at  a \nminimum, to heightened scrutiny because they are also sex-based classifications. \n117.  Because  transgender  people  have  obvious,  immutable,  and \ndistinguishing characteristics, including having a gender identity that is different \nthan their birth sex, they comprise a discrete group. This defining characteristic bears \nno relation to a transgender person’s ability to contribute to society. Nevertheless, \ntransgender people have faced historical discrimination and have been unable to \nsecure equality through the political process. \n118.  As such, transgender classifications are subject to strict scrutiny. \n119.  The Act does nothing to protect the health or well-being of minors. To \nthe contrary, the Act undermines the health and well-being of transgender minors by \ndenying them essential medical care. \n32 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 146   Filed 08/09/22   Page 33 of 42\n \n120.  The Act is not narrowly tailored to further a compelling government \ninterest and is not substantially related to any important governmental interest. \nMoreover,  the  Act  is  not  even  rationally  related  to  a  governmental  interest. \nAccordingly,  the  Act  violates  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment. \nCOUNT III \nPreemption \nHealthcare Provider Plaintiffs, Parent Plaintiffs, and Transgender Plaintiffs Against \nDefendants in Their Official Capacities \n42 U.S.C. § 18116 \n121.  Plaintiffs incorporate all preceding paragraphs of the Complaint as if \nset forth fully herein.  \n122.  Healthcare  Provider  Plaintiffs,  Parent  Plaintiffs,  and  Transgender \nPlaintiffs bring this Count against all Defendants.  \n123.  Under Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, “an individual shall \nnot . . . be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected \nto  discrimination  under,  any  health  program  or  activity,  any  part  of  which  is \nreceiving Federal financial assistance, including credits, subsidies, or contracts of \ninsurance, or under any program or activity that is administered by an Executive \nAgency or any entity established under this title (or amendments)” on the basis of \nsex. 42 U.S.C. § 18116. \n33 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 146   Filed 08/09/22   Page 34 of 42\n \n124.  The prohibition on sex discrimination in Section 1557 of the Affordable \nCare  Act  protects  transgender  individuals  from  discrimination  by  healthcare \nproviders, including physicians and hospitals. \n125.  The  Parent  Plaintiffs  obtain  medical  care  for  their  children,  the \nTransgender  Plaintiffs,  from  providers  who  are  recipients  of  federal  financial \nassistance and therefore subject to the non-discrimination requirements of Section \n1557 of the Affordable Care Act.  \n126.  The Act subjects the Transgender Plaintiffs and the Parent Plaintiffs to \nunlawful  sex  discrimination  by  preventing  Plaintiff  Parents  from  obtaining \nmedically necessary care for their children, the Transgender Plaintiffs, because of \nthe children’s transgender status and by requiring their healthcare providers to \ndiscriminate against the children because they are transgender. As such, the Act \nconflicts with the non-discrimination requirements of Section 1557. It also conflicts \nwith and undermines the purposes and goals of Section 1557. \n127.  In  addition,  as  providers  for  transgender  beneficiaries  of  Alabama \nMedicaid,  the  Healthcare  Provider  Plaintiffs  are  recipients  of  federal  financial \nassistance and therefore subject to the non-discrimination requirements of Section \n1557 of the Affordable Care Act. \n128.  It is impossible for the Healthcare Provider Plaintiffs to continue to \ncomply  with  their  obligations  under  Section  1557  and  also  comply  with  the \n34 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 146   Filed 08/09/22   Page 35 of 42\n \nrestrictions imposed by the Act. On the one hand, refusing to comply with the Act \nwould bring them into compliance with Section 1557, but subject them to criminal \npenalties under the Act. On the other hand, complying with the Act would subject \nthe Healthcare Plaintiffs to civil liability for discrimination under Section 1557. \n129.  The Act stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of \nthe full purposes and objectives of Congress, including the objective of preventing \ndiscrimination in the provision of healthcare based on sex. \n130.  The Healthcare Provider Plaintiffs, Parent Plaintiffs, and Transgender \nPlaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law to redress the wrongs alleged herein, \nwhich are of a continuing nature and will cause them irreparable harm. \n131.  Accordingly,  the  Healthcare  Provider  Plaintiffs  are  entitled  to \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief. \nCOUNT IV \nDeprivation of Free Speech \nAll Plaintiffs Against Defendants in Their Official Capacities \nU.S. Const. Amend. I \n132.  Plaintiffs incorporate all preceding paragraphs of the Complaint as if \nset forth fully herein. \n133.  All Plaintiffs bring this Count against all Defendants.   \n134.  The Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment, enforceable pursuant \nto 42 U.S.C. § 1983, provides that “Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the \nfreedom of speech.” \n35 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 146   Filed 08/09/22   Page 36 of 42\n \n135.  The First Amendment is applicable to the State of Alabama under the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n136.  The  Act  creates  an  unlawful  restriction  on  speech.  By  imposing \ncriminal penalties on anyone who “cause[s]” any of the proscribed treatments to be \nperformed on a minor, Defendants are punishing the Healthcare Provider Plaintiffs, \nthe Parent Plaintiffs, and Reverend Eknes-Tucker for any speech that can be pointed \nto as resulting in a minor receiving any of the proscribed treatments – e.g., referrals, \ncounseling, or discussions relating to well-established care recognized in the medical \ncommunity  as  appropriate,  safe  treatment  for  gender  dysphoria  in  transgender \nminors.   \n137.  There  is  no  constitutionally  sufficient  justification  for  the  Act’s \nrestriction of speech. The Act is not rationally related to the furtherance of any \nlegitimate government interest, let alone narrowly tailored to substantially advance \nany compelling or important government interest. \nCOUNT V \nDeprivation of Procedural Due Process \nAll Plaintiffs Against Defendants in Their Official Capacities \nVoid for Vagueness \nU.S. Const. Amend. V and XIV \n138.  Plaintiffs incorporate all preceding paragraphs of the Complaint as if \nset forth fully herein.  \n139.  All Plaintiffs bring this Count against all Defendants.  \n36 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 146   Filed 08/09/22   Page 37 of 42\n \n140.  Under the Due Process Clause, a criminal statue is void for vagueness \nif it either: (1) fails “to provide the kind of notice that will enable ordinary people to \nunderstand what conduct it prohibits” or (2) authorizes or encourages “arbitrary and \ndiscriminatory enforcement.” City of Chicago v. Morales, 527 U.S. 41, 56 (1999). \n141.  Section 4(a) of the Act states, in relevant part, that “no person shall . . . \ncause any of the following practices to be performed upon a minor . . . .”  \n142.  As written, the Act does not provide sufficient definiteness to ordinary \npeople,  including  Plaintiffs,  of  what  actions  constitute  “caus[ing]”  any  of  the \nproscribed activities upon a minor. \n143.  The  lack  of  definiteness  in  the  Act  encourages  arbitrary  and \ndiscriminatory enforcement against anyone who is aware of, refers to, discusses, \ntalks about, recommends, or gives an opinion on a transgender person’s healthcare. \nRELIEF REQUESTED \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that this Court: \n(1)  issue a judgment, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202, declaring that the \nAct violates federal law for the reasons and on the Counts set forth above;  \n(2)  temporarily, preliminarily, and permanently enjoin Defendants and their \nofficers, employees, servants, agents, appointees, or successors from \nenforcing the Act; \n37 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 146   Filed 08/09/22   Page 38 of 42\n \n(3)  declare that the Act violates the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments \nto the United States Constitution; and \n(4)  grant such other relief as the Court finds just and proper.  \n \nRespectfully submitted this 9th day of August, 2022. \n \n  /s/ Melody H.

Because \nthe Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit have made \nclear that: (1) parents have a fundamental right to direct the medical care of their \nchildren subject to accepted medical standards; and (2) discrimination based on \ngender-nonconformity equates to sex discrimination, the Court finds that there is a \nsubstantial likelihood that Section 4(a)(1)–(3) of the Act is unconstitutional and, \nthus,  enjoins  Defendants  from  enforcing  that  portion  of  the  Act  pending  trial. \nHowever, all other provisions of the Act remain in effect, specifically: (1) the \n \n1 Based on their oral representations during a May 4, 2022 hearing, Plaintiffs seek to enjoin only \nSection 4(a)(1)–(3) of the Act. For purposes of this opinion, all references to “the Act” refer to \nthese subdivisions unless noted otherwise. \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 107   Filed 05/13/22   Page 2 of 32\nprovision that bans sex-altering surgeries on minors; (2) the provision prohibiting \nschool officials from keeping certain gender-identity information of children secret \nfrom  their  parents;  and  (3)  the  provision  that  prohibits  school  officials  from \nencouraging or compelling children to keep certain gender-identity information \nsecret from their parents. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nRegarding a child’s belief that they might be transgender, Merriam-Webster’s \nDictionary defines a “transgender” person as one whose gender identity is different \nfrom the sex the person had or was identified as having at birth. Transgender, \nMERRIAM-WEBSTER UNABR. DICTIONARY (3rd ed. 2002). The Dictionary defines \n“gender identity” as a person’s internal sense of being a male or a female. Gender \nIdentity, MERRIAM-WEBSTER UNABR. DICTIONARY (3rd ed. 2002). These terms and \ndefinitions are largely consistent with those used by the parties. Accordingly, the \nCourt relies on these terms throughout this opinion, but recognizes that they might \nmean different things to different people and in different contexts. \nAccording to the uncontradicted record evidence, some transgender minors \nsuffer from a mental health condition known as gender dysphoria. Tr. at 30.2 Gender \ndysphoria is a clinically diagnosed incongruence between one’s gender identity and \n \n2 “Tr.” is a consecutively paginated transcript of the two-day preliminary injunction hearing the \nCourt held on May 5–6, 2022. For clarity, the Court cites to the internal pagination of the transcript \nrather than the ECF pagination. \n  2 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 107   Filed 05/13/22   Page 3 of 32\nassigned gender. DSM-5 (Doc. 69-17) at 4. If untreated, gender dysphoria may cause \nor lead to anxiety, depression, eating disorders, substance abuse, self-harm, and \nsuicide. Tr. at 20. According to the World Professional Association for Transgender \nHealth (WPATH), an organization whose mission is to promote education and \nresearch about transgender healthcare, gender dysphoria in adolescents (minors \ntwelve and over) is more likely to persist into adulthood than gender dysphoria in \nchildren (minors under twelve). WPATH Standards of Care (Doc. 69-18) at 17.3 \nIn some cases, physicians treat gender dysphoria in minors with a family of \nmedications known as GnRH agonists, commonly referred to as puberty blockers. \nId. at 24; Tr. at 103. After a minor has been on puberty blockers for one to three \nyears, doctors may then use hormone therapies to masculinize or feminize his or her \nbody. Tr. at 108–11, 131. The primary effect of these treatments is to delay physical \nmaturation, allowing transgender minors to socially transition their gender while \nthey await adulthood. Id. at 105–06, 110–11. For clarity and conciseness, the Court \nrefers  to  puberty  blockers  and  hormone  therapies  used  for  these  purposes  as \n“transitioning medications.” \nLike all medications, transitioning medications come with risks. Tr. at 121–\n22. Known risks, for example, include loss of fertility and sexual function. Id. \n \n3 Plaintiffs, the State, and the United States individually introduced the WPATH standards into \nevidence during the May 5–6 preliminary injunction hearing. \n  3 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 107   Filed 05/13/22   Page 4 of 32\nat 132–33.  Nevertheless,  WPATH  recognizes  transitioning  medications  as \nestablished medical treatments and publishes a set of guidelines for treating gender \ndysphoria in minors with these medications. WPATH Standards of Care (Doc. 69-\n18) at 19. The American Medical Association, the American Pediatric Society, the \nAmerican Psychiatric Association, the Association of American Medical Colleges, \nand at least eighteen additional major medical associations endorse these guidelines \nas evidence-based methods for treating gender dysphoria in minors. Tr. at 97–98; \nHealthcare Amici Br. (Doc. 91-1) at 15.4 \nThe Alabama Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act states in \npertinent part: \nSection 4. (a) . . . [N]o person shall engage in or cause any of the \nfollowing practices to be performed upon a minor if the practice is \nperformed for the purpose of attempting to alter the appearance of or \naffirm  the  minor’s  perception  of  his  or  her  gender  or  sex,  if  that \nappearance or perception is inconsistent with the minor’s sex as defined \nin this act: \n \n(1) Prescribing  or  administering  puberty  blocking \nmedication to stop or delay normal puberty. \n \n(2) Prescribing or administering supraphysiologic doses \nof testosterone or other androgens to females. \n \n(3) Prescribing or administering supraphysiologic doses \nof estrogen to males. \n \n \n4 For a full list of the twenty-two major medical associations that endorse these guidelines, see \ninfra note 12. \n  4 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 107   Filed 05/13/22   Page 5 of 32\n(4) Performing  surgeries  that  sterilize,  including \ncastration,  vasectomy,  hysterectomy,  oophorectomy, \norchiectomy, and penectomy. \n \n(5) Performing surgeries that artificially construct tissue \nwith  the  appearance  of  genitalia  that  differs  from  the \nindividual’s sex, including metoidioplasty, phalloplasty, \nand vaginoplasty. \n \n(6) Removing any healthy or non-diseased body part or \ntissue, except for a male circumcision. \n \n. . . \n \n(c)  A violation of this section is a Class C felony. \n \nSection  5.  No  nurse,  counselor,  teacher,  principal,  or  other \nadministrative official at a public or private school attended by a minor \nshall do either of the following: \n \n(1) Encourage or coerce a minor to withhold from the \nminor’s parent or legal guardian the fact that the minor’s \nperception of his or her gender or sex is inconsistent with \nthe minor’s sex. \n \n(2) Withhold  from  a  minor’s  parent  or  legal  guardian \ninformation related to a minor’s perception that his or her \ngender or sex is inconsistent with his or her sex. \n \nS.B. 184, ALA. 2022 REG. SESS. §§ 4–5 (Ala. 2022). The Act defines a “minor” as \nanyone under the age of nineteen. Id. § 3(1); ALA. CODE § 43-8-1(18). The Act \ndefines “sex” as  “[t]he biological state  of being male or female, based on the \nindividual’s  sex  organs,  chromosomes,  and  endogenous  hormone  profiles.” \nS.B. 184, ALA. 2022 REG. SESS. § 3(3) (Ala. 2022). \n  5 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 107   Filed 05/13/22   Page 6 of 32\nIn  support  of  these  prohibitions,  the  Legislature  made  several legislative \nfindings.  Id.  §  2.  The  Legislature  found  in  part  that  “[s]ome  in  the  medical \ncommunity are aggressively pushing” minors to take transitioning medications, \nwhich the Act describes as “unproven, poorly studied . . . interventions” that cause \n“numerous harmful effects for minors, as well as risks of effects simply unknown \ndue to the new and experimental nature of these interventions.” Id. § 2(6), (11). The \nLegislature went on to find that “[m]inors, and often their parents, are unable to \ncomprehend and fully appreciate the risk and life implications” of these treatments. \nId.  §  2(15).  Thus,  the  Legislature  concluded,  “the  decision  to  pursue”  these \ntreatments “should not be presented to or determined for minors[.]” Id. § 2(16). \nAlabama legislators passed the Act on April 7, 2022.5 Governor Kay Ivey \nsigned the Act into law the following day.6 In the week that followed, civil rights \ngroups filed two lawsuits challenging the Act’s constitutionality.7 In Ladinsky v. \nIvey, Case No. 2:22-cv-447 (N.D.

Manasco. Judge \nManasco recused, and the case was randomly reassigned to United States Magistrate \nJudge  Staci  G.  Cornelius.  After  the  parties  declined  to  proceed  before  Judge \nCornelius in accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 636(c), the case was randomly reassigned \nto the Honorable Annemarie C. Axon. \nWith Ladinsky pending, a separate set of plaintiffs challenged the Act in the \nUnited States District Court of the Middle District of Alabama. That case, styled \nWalker v. Marshall, Case No. 2:22-cv-167 (M.D. Ala. 2022), was randomly assigned \nto Chief United States District Judge Emily C. Marks. The Walker plaintiffs moved \nto enjoin enforcement of the Act and moved to reassign the case to United States \nDistrict Judge Myron H. Thompson, alleging that he had previously presided over a \nsimilar case. The parties, however, later consented to transferring the case to the \nNorthern District of Alabama for consolidation with Ladinsky. At that time, the \nWalker plaintiffs withdrew their motion to reassign. \nOn April 15, 2022, Chief Judge Marks transferred Walker to the Northern \nDistrict of Alabama in accordance with the “first-filed” rule and 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a). \nThe case was randomly assigned to this Court. Judge Axon then transferred Ladinsky \nto this Court for consolidation with Walker. That same day, at 6:24 p.m. CDT, the \nWalker  plaintiffs  filed  a  notice  of  voluntary  dismissal  without  prejudice  under \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1)(A)(i). The Ladinsky plaintiffs voluntarily \n  7 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 107   Filed 05/13/22   Page 8 of 32\ndismissed  their  case  nine  minutes  later.  Neither  the  Walker  plaintiffs  nor  the \nLadinsky plaintiffs explained their respective dismissals, but counsel for Ladinsky \ninformed the press: “We do plan to refile imminently[.]”8 \nSure enough, on April 19, four transgender minors (Minor Plaintiffs), their \nparents  (Parent  Plaintiffs),  a  child  psychologist  and  a  pediatrician  (Healthcare \nPlaintiffs), and Reverend Paul A. Eknes-Tucker filed this suit in the United States \nDistrict Court of the Middle District of Alabama and moved to enjoin the Act’s \nenforcement pending trial. The case was randomly assigned to United States District \nJudge R. Austin Huffaker, Jr. Due to this Court’s familiarity with Ladinsky and \nWalker, Judge Huffaker reassigned the case to this Court to expedite disposition of \nPlaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction. With the Act set to take effect on May \n8, the Court entered an abbreviated briefing schedule and set a hearing on Plaintiffs’ \nmotion for May 5–6. \nJust days before the hearing, the United States moved to intervene on behalf \nof Plaintiffs under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24.9 In the process, the United \nStates filed its own motion to enjoin enforcement of the Act and requested to \n \n8 Paul Gattis, Lawsuits Seeking to Overturn New Alabama Transgender Law Dropped, Could be \nRefiled, AL.COM, https://www.al.com/news/2022/04/lawsuits-seeking-to-overturn-new-alabama-\ntransgender-law-dropped-could-be-refiled.html (last updated Apr. 16, 2022, 9:22 PM). \n9 The United States’s amended intervenor complaint does not add any additional claims, name any \nnew defendants, or seek to expand the relief sought by Plaintiffs.

Additionally, fifteen states moved \nfor leave to proceed as amici curiae10 and to file a brief in support of Defendants.11 \nTwenty-two healthcare organizations also moved for leave to proceed as amici \ncuriae and to file a brief in support of Plaintiffs.12 Ultimately, the Court granted these \nmotions in full, took the amici briefs under advisement, and gave the United States \nleave to participate during the preliminary injunction hearing. \nDuring  that  hearing,  the  parties  submitted  hundreds  of pages  of  medical \nevidence and called several live witnesses. Plaintiffs tendered Dr. Linda Hawkins \nand Dr. Morissa Ladinsky as experts in the treatment of gender dysphoria in minors. \nTr. at 16, 92. Dr. Hawkins and Dr. Ladinsky testified that at least twenty-two major \n \n10 Amici curiae, Latin for “friends of the court,” refers to a group of people or institutions who are \nnot parties to a lawsuit, but petition the court (or are requested by the court) to file a brief in the \naction because they have “a strong interest in the subject matter.” Amicus Curiae, BLACK’S LAW \nDICTIONARY (11th ed. 2019). \n11 The State Amici are the States of Arkansas, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, \nMississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, and West \nVirginia. \n12 The Healthcare Amici are the American Academy of Pediatrics; the Alabama Chapter of the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics; the Academic Pediatric Association; the American Academy of \nChild and Adolescent Psychiatry; the American Academy of Family Physicians; the American \nAcademy of Nursing; the American Association of Physicians for Human Rights, Inc. d/b/a Health \nProfessionals  Advancing  LGBTQ  Equality;  the  American  College  of  Obstetricians  and \nGynecologists; the American College of Osteopathic Pediatricians; the American College of \nPhysicians; the American Medical Association; the American Pediatric Society; the American \nPsychiatric Association; the Association of American Medical Colleges; the Association of \nMedical School Pediatric Department Chairs; the Endocrine Society; the National Association of \nPediatric Nurse Practitioners; the Pediatric Endocrine Society; the Society for Adolescent Health \nand Medicine; the Society for Pediatric Research; the Society of Pediatric Nurses; the Societies \nfor Pediatric Urology; and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health. \n  9 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 107   Filed 05/13/22   Page 10 of 32\nmedical associations in the United States endorse transitioning medications as well-\nestablished, evidence-based methods for treating gender dysphoria in minors.

Id. \nat 163. Megan explained that the medications have had no adverse effects on Allison \nand that Allison is now happy and “thriving.” Id. at 166–67. When asked what would \noccur if her daughter stopped taking the medications, Megan responded that she \nfeared her daughter would commit suicide. Id. at 167. \nIntervening on behalf of Plaintiffs, the United States tendered Dr. Armand H. \nAntommaria  as  an  expert  in  bioethics  and  treatment  protocols  for  adolescents \nsuffering from gender dysphoria. Id. at 213–26. He reiterated that transitioning \nmedications  are  well-established,  evidence-based  methods  for  treating  gender \ndysphoria in minors. Id. at 120–21. \nDefendants called two witnesses. Id. at 253, 337. First, Defendants tendered \nDr. James Cantor—a private psychologist in Toronto, Canada—to testify as an \nexpert on psychology, human sexuality, research methodology, and the state of the \nresearch literature on gender dysphoria and its treatment. Id. at 253–54. Dr. Cantor \nopined that, due to the risks of transitioning medications, doctors should use a \n“watchful waiting” approach to treat gender dysphoria in minors. Id. at 281. That \napproach, according to Dr. Cantor, “refers specifically to withholding any decision \nabout medical interventions until [doctors] have a better idea or feel more confident” \nthat the minor’s gender dysphoria will persist without medical intervention other \nthan counseling. Id. Dr. Cantor further testified that several European countries have \n  11 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 107   Filed 05/13/22   Page 12 of 32\nrestricted treating minors with transitioning medications due to growing concern \nabout the medications’ risks. Id. at 296–97. \nOn cross examination, however, Dr. Cantor admitted that: (1) his patients are, \non average, thirty years old; (2) he had never provided care to a transgender minor \nunder the age of sixteen; (3) he had never diagnosed a child or adolescent with \ngender  dysphoria;  (4)  he  had  never  treated  a  child  or  adolescent  for  gender \ndysphoria;  (5)  he  had  no  personal  experience  monitoring  patients  receiving \ntransitioning medications; and (6) he had no personal knowledge of the assessments \nor treatment methodologies used at any Alabama gender clinic. Id. at 306–09. \nAccordingly,  the  Court  gave  his  testimony  regarding  the  treatment  of  gender \ndysphoria in minors very little weight. Dr. Cantor also testified that no country in \nEurope (or elsewhere) has categorically banned treating gender dysphoria in minors \nwith transitioning medications. Id. at 326–28. Unlike the Act, Dr. Cantor added, \nthose countries allow such treatments under certain circumstances and for research \npurposes. Id. at 327–28. \nDefendants’  other  witness  was  Sydney  Wright,  a  twenty-three-year-old \nwoman  who  took  hormone  therapies  for  gender  dysphoria  for  roughly  a  year \nbeginning when she was nineteen. Id. at 338, 351, 357. She testified that she now \nbelieves taking the medication was a mistake and that she no longer believes gender \ndysphoria is a legitimate medical diagnosis. Id. at 348–49, 355. She also testified \n  12 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 107   Filed 05/13/22   Page 13 of 32\nthat she received her treatments in Georgia and never visited a gender clinic in \nAlabama. Id. at 359–61. \nII.  LEGAL STANDARDS \nThe purpose of a preliminary injunction “is to preserve the positions of the \nparties” pending trial. Bloedorn v. Grube, 631 F.3d 1218, 1229 (11th Cir. 2011). \nWhen  a  federal  court  preliminarily  enjoins  a  state  law  passed  by  duly  elected \nofficials, the court effectively overrules a decision “of the people and, thus, in a sense \ninterferes with the processes of democratic government.” Ne. Fla. Chapter of Ass’n \nof Gen. Contractors of Am. v. City of Jacksonville, 896 F.2d 1283, 1285 (11th Cir. \n1990). This is an extraordinary and drastic remedy. McDonald’s Corp. v. Robertson, \n147 F.3d 1301, 1306 (11th Cir. 1998). \nTo receive a preliminary injunction, a movant must show that: (1) he or she \nhas a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) he or she will suffer \nirreparable injury absent injunctive relief; (3) the threatened injury to him or her \n“outweighs whatever damage the proposed injunction may cause the opposing party; \nand (4) if issued, the injunction would not be adverse to the public interest.” Siegel \nv. LePore, 234 F.3d 1163, 1176 (11th Cir. 2000) (en banc). The movant bears the \nburden of persuasion on each element. State of Fla. v. Dep’t of Health & Hum. \nServs., 19 F.4th 1271, 1279 (11th Cir. 2021). \n   \n  13 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 107   Filed 05/13/22   Page 14 of 32\nIII.  DISCUSSION \nPlaintiffs and the United States seek to enjoin Section 4(a)(1)–(3) of the Act \npending trial under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65. Pls.’ Mot. (Doc. 7) at 2; \nIntervenor Pl.’s Mot. (Doc. 62) at 2. Under this rule, a court may issue a preliminary \ninjunction only after giving notice to the adverse party. FED. R. CIV. P. 65(a)(1). \nWhere injunctive relief is appropriate, the movant must give security “to pay the \ncosts and damages sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined \nor restrained.” Id. at 65(c). Here, Defendants have received proper notice. The Court \naddresses  whether  Plaintiffs  are  entitled  to  preliminary  injunctive  relief  before \nturning to the issue of security. \nA.  Substantial Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nThe Court first considers whether Plaintiffs are substantially likely to succeed \non their claims. When a plaintiff brings multiple claims, a reviewing court must \nconsider the plaintiff’s likelihood of success on each claim. See N. Am. Med. Corp. \nv. Axiom Worldwide, Inc., 522 F.3d 1211, 1226 (11th Cir. 2008). Here, Plaintiffs \nbring five causes of action: four constitutional claims and one preemption claim. The \nCourt begins with Plaintiffs’ constitutional claims. \n1.  Plaintiffs’ Constitutional Claims \nPlaintiffs’ constitutional claims arise under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, \n42 U.S.C. § 1983. Compl. (Doc. 1) at 28–30, 33–35. That statute guarantees “a \n  14 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 107   Filed 05/13/22   Page 15 of 32\nfederal  forum  for  claims  of  unconstitutional  treatment  at  the  hands  of  state \nofficials[.]” Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 480 (1994). To state a claim under \n§ 1983, a plaintiff must allege: (1) the defendant deprived him of a right secured \nunder federal law or the Constitution; and (2) such deprivation occurred under color \nof state law. Richardson v. Johnson, 598 F.3d 734, 737 (11th Cir. 2010) (per curiam). \nParent Plaintiffs claim that the Act violates their constitutional right to direct \nthe medical care of their children under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment.  Compl.  (Doc.  1)  at  28–29.  Minor  Plaintiffs  assert  that  the  Act \ndiscriminates  against  them  based  on  their  sex  in  violation  of  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment. Id. at 29–30. Plaintiffs collectively allege that the Act is void for \nvagueness  under  the  Fifth  and  Fourteenth  Amendments.  Id.  at  34–35.  Finally, \nPlaintiffs collectively claim that the Act unlawfully restricts their speech under the \nFirst Amendment. Id. at 33–34. The Court addresses Plaintiffs’ claims in that order. \ni.  Substantive Due Process Claim \nParent Plaintiffs assert that the Act violates their constitutional right to direct \nthe medical care of their children under the Fourteenth Amendment. Compl. (Doc. 1) \nat 28–29.13 The Due Process Clause provides that no State shall “deprive any person \nof life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” U.S. CONST. AMEND. XIV. \n \n13 Based on the record evidence, the Court finds that Parent Plaintiffs have standing to bring their \nSubstantive Due Process Claim. Defendants raise no opposition to this conclusion. \n  15 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 107   Filed 05/13/22   Page 16 of 32\nThe Clause protects against governmental violations of “certain fundamental rights \nand liberty interests.” Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 719–20 (1997). \nFundamental rights are “those guaranteed by the Bill of Rights as well as certain \n‘liberty’  and  privacy  interests  implicit  in  the  [D]ue  [P]rocess  [C]lause  and  the \npenumbra of constitutional rights.” Doe v. Moore, 410 F.3d 1337, 1343 (11th Cir. \n2005). \nA parent’s right “to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control \nof  their  children”  is  one  of  “the  oldest  of  the  fundamental  liberty  interests” \nrecognized by the Supreme Court. Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65–66 (2000). \nEncompassed within this right is the more specific right to direct a child’s medical \ncare. See Bendiburg v. Dempsey, 909 F.2d 463, 470 (11th Cir. 1990) (recognizing \n“the right of parents to generally make decisions concerning the treatment to be \ngiven to their children”).14 Accordingly, parents “retain plenary authority to seek \nsuch care for their children, subject to a physician’s independent examination and \nmedical judgment.” Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584, 604 (1979). \nAgainst this backdrop, Parent Plaintiffs are substantially likely to show that \nthey have a fundamental right to treat their children with transitioning medications \nsubject to medically accepted standards and that the Act infringes on that right. The \n \n14 See also PJ ex rel. Jensen v. Wagner, 603 F.3d 1182, 1197 (10th Cir. 2010) (explaining that “the \nDue Process Clause provides some level of protection for parents’ decisions regarding their \nchildren’s medical care”). \n  16 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 107   Filed 05/13/22   Page 17 of 32\nAct prevents Parent Plaintiffs from choosing that course of treatment for their \nchildren  by  criminalizing  the  use  of  transitioning  medications  to  treat  gender \ndysphoria  in  minors,  even  at  the  independent  recommendation  of  a  licensed \npediatrician. Accordingly, Parent Plaintiffs are substantially likely to show that the \nAct infringes on their fundamental right to treat their children with transitioning \nmedications subject to medically accepted standards. \nThe  State  counters  that  parents  have  no  fundamental  right  to  treat  their \nchildren with experimental medications. Defs.’ Br. (Doc. 74) at 120. To be sure, the \nparental right to autonomy is not limitless; the State may limit the right and intercede \non a child’s behalf when the child’s health or safety is in jeopardy. Bendiburg, \n909 F.2d at 470. But the fact that a pediatric treatment “involves risks does not \nautomatically transfer the power” to choose that treatment “from the parents to some \nagency or officer of the state.” Parham, 442 U.S. at 603. \nDefendants  produce  no  credible  evidence  to  show  that  transitioning \nmedications  are  “experimental.”  While  Defendants  offer  some  evidence  that \ntransitioning medications pose certain risks, the uncontradicted record evidence is \nthat at least twenty-two major medical associations in the United States endorse \ntransitioning medications as well-established, evidence-based treatments for gender \ndysphoria in minors. Tr. at 25, 97–98, 126–27. Indeed, according to Defendants’ \nown expert, no country or state in the world categorically bans their use as Alabama \n  17 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 107   Filed 05/13/22   Page 18 of 32\nhas. Certainly, the science is quickly evolving and will likely continue to do so. But \nthis is true of almost every medical treatment regimen. Risk alone does not make a \nmedication experimental. \nMoreover, the record shows that medical providers have used transitioning \nmedications for decades to treat medical conditions other than gender dysphoria, \nsuch as central precocious puberty, a condition in which a child enters puberty at a \nyoung age. Doctors have also long used hormone therapies for patients whose \nnatural hormone levels are below normal. Based on the current record, Defendants \nfail to show that transitioning medications are experimental. Thus, Parent Plaintiffs \nare substantially likely to show that the Act violates their fundamental right to treat \ntheir  children  with  transitioning  medications  subject  to  medically  accepted \nstandards. \nStatutes that infringe on fundamental rights are constitutional only when they \nsatisfy the most demanding standard of judicial review, strict scrutiny. Williams v. \nPryor, 240 F.3d 944, 947 (11th Cir. 2001). To satisfy strict scrutiny, a statute must \nbe “narrowly tailored” to achieve “a compelling state interest.” Reno v. Flores, \n507 U.S. 292, 302 (1993). The State’s interest in “safeguarding the physical and \npsychological well-being of a minor is a compelling one.” Globe Newspaper Co. v. \nSuperior Ct. for Norfolk Cnty., 457 U.S. 596, 607 (1982) (cleaned up). \n  18 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 107   Filed 05/13/22   Page 19 of 32\nDefendants proffer that the purpose of the Act is “to protect children from \nexperimental medical procedures,” the consequences of which neither they nor their \nparents often fully appreciate or understand. Defs.’ Br. (Doc. 74) at 129; see also \nS.B. 184, ALA. 2022 REG. SESS. § 2(13)–(15) (Ala. 2022). Defendants also allege \nthat the Act halts medical associations from “aggressively pushing” transitioning \nmedications on minors. Defs.’ Br. (Doc. 74) at 114; see also S.B. 184, ALA. 2022 \nREG. SESS. § 2(6) (Ala. 2022). \nBut as explained above, Defendants fail to produce evidence showing that \ntransitioning medications jeopardize the health and safety of minors suffering from \ngender dysphoria. Nor do Defendants offer evidence to suggest that healthcare \nassociations are aggressively pushing these medications on minors. Instead, the \nrecord shows that at least twenty-two major medical associations in the United States \nendorse transitioning medications as well-established, evidence-based treatments for \ngender dysphoria in minors. Tr. at 25, 97–98, 126–27. The record also indicates that \nparents undergo a thorough screening and consent process before they may choose \nthese medications for their children. \nUndoubtedly, transitioning medications carry risks. But again, the fact that \npediatric medication “involves risks does not automatically transfer the power” to \nchoose that medication “from the parents to some agency or officer of the state.” \nParham, 442 U.S. at 603. Parents, pediatricians, and psychologists—not the State or \n  19 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 107   Filed 05/13/22   Page 20 of 32\nthis Court—are best qualified to determine whether transitioning medications are in \na child’s best interest on a case-by-case basis. Defendants’ proffered purposes—\nwhich  amount  to  speculative,  future  concerns  about  the  health  and  safety  of \nunidentified children—are not genuinely compelling justifications based on the \nrecord evidence. For this reason alone, the Act cannot survive strict scrutiny at this \nstage of litigation. \nBut even if Defendants’ proffered purposes are genuinely compelling, the Act \nis  not  narrowly  tailored  to  achieve  those  interests.  A  narrowly  tailored  statute \nemploys the “least restrictive means” necessary to achieve its purpose. Holt v. \nHobbs, 574 U.S. 352, 364 (2015). A statute is not narrowly tailored when “numerous \nand less-burdensome alternatives” are available to advance the statute’s purpose. FF \nCosms. FL, Inc. v. City of Miami Beach, 866 F.3d 1290, 1299 (11th Cir. 2017). Put \ndifferently, “if a less restrictive means is available for the Government to achieve its \ngoals,  the  Government  must  use  it.”  United  States  v.  Playboy  Ent.  Grp.,  Inc., \n529 U.S. 803, 815 (2000). \nDefendants  applaud  the  efforts  of  several  European  countries  to  restrict \nminors  from  taking  transitioning  medications,  but  unlike  Alabama’s  Act,  these \ncountries  allow  minors  to  take  transitioning  medications  in  exceptional \ncircumstances on a case-by-case basis. Defs.’ Br. (Doc. 74) at 76–82. According to \nDr. Cantor, Defendants’ own expert witness, no state or country in the entire world \n  20 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 107   Filed 05/13/22   Page 21 of 32\nhas enacted a blanket ban of these medications other than Alabama. Tr. at 328. The \nAct, unlike the cited European regulations, does not even permit minors to take \ntransitioning medications for research purposes, even though Defendants adamantly \nmaintain that more research on them is needed. Id. at 326–27; Defs.’ Br. (Doc. 74) \nat 116. Because Defendants themselves offer several less restrictive ways to achieve \ntheir proffered purposes, the Act is not narrowly tailored at this stage of litigation. \nIn sum, Parent Plaintiffs have a fundamental right to direct the medical care \nof their children. This right includes the more specific right to treat their children \nwith transitioning medications subject to medically accepted standards. The Act \ninfringes on that right and, as such, is subject to strict scrutiny. At this stage of \nlitigation, the Act falls short of that standard because it is not narrowly tailored to \nachieve  a  compelling  government  interest.  Accordingly,  Parent  Plaintiffs  are \nsubstantially likely to succeed on their Substantive Due Process claim. \nii.  Equal Protection Claim \nMinor Plaintiffs claim that the Act discriminates against them based on their \nsex in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Compl. (Doc. 1) at 29–30.15 The \nEqual Protection Clause provides that no State shall “deny to any person within its \n \n15 Based on the record evidence, the Court finds that Minor Plaintiffs have standing to bring their \nEqual Protection claim. Defendants raise no opposition to this conclusion. However, Parent \nPlaintiffs, Healthcare Plaintiffs, and Plaintiff Eknes-Tucker do not explain—nor is it readily \napparent—how  they  have  standing  to  bring  an  Equal  Protection  claim  and,  thus,  are  not \nsubstantially likely to succeed on the merits of their claim. \n  21 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 107   Filed 05/13/22   Page 22 of 32\njurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” U.S. CONST. AMEND. XIV, § 1. The \nClause’s chief purpose “is to secure every person within the State’s jurisdiction \nagainst  intentional  and  arbitrary  discrimination,  whether  occasioned  by  express \nterms of a statute or by its improper execution through duly constituted agents.” Vill. \nof Willowbrook v. Olech, 528 U.S. 562, 564 (2000) (per curiam) (quoting Sioux City \nBridge Co. v. Dakota Cnty., 260 U.S. 441, 445 (1923)). \nAs the Supreme Court recently explained, “it is impossible to discriminate \nagainst a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against \nthat individual based on sex.” Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., 140 S. Ct. 1731, 1741 \n(2020). Governmental classification based on an individual’s gender nonconformity \nequates to a sex-based classification for purposes of the Equal Protection Clause. \nGlenn v. Brumby, 663 F.3d 1312, 1320 (11th Cir. 2011). Here, the Act prohibits \ntransgender  minors—and  only  transgender  minors—from  taking  transitioning \nmedications due to their gender nonconformity. See S.B. 184, ALA. 2022 REG. SESS. \n§ 4(a)(1)–(3) (Ala. 2022). The Act therefore constitutes a sex-based classification \nfor purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment. \nThe State views things differently. The State argues that the Act creates two \ncategories of people: (1) minors who seek transitioning medications “for the purpose \nof attempting to alter the appearance of or affirm the minor’s perception of his or her \ngender or sex, if that appearance or perception is inconsistent with the minor’s sex”; \n  22 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 107   Filed 05/13/22   Page 23 of 32\nand (2) “all other minors.” Defs.’ Br. (Doc. 74) at 93. (quoting S.B. 184, ALA. 2022 \nREG. SESS. § 4(a) (Ala. 2022)). Because transgender minors fall into both categories, \nthe State reasons, the Act is not a sex-based classification. Id. at 94. \nThe fundamental flaw in this argument is that the first category consists \nentirely of transgender minors. The Act categorically prohibits transgender minors \nfrom taking transitioning medications due to their gender nonconformity. In this \nway, the Act places a special burden on transgender minors because their gender \nidentity does not match their birth sex. The Act therefore amounts to a sex-based \nclassification for purposes of the Equal Protection Clause. See Glenn, 663 F.3d \nat 1317 (explaining that “discrimination against a transgender individual because of \nher gender-nonconformity is sex discrimination”). \nSex-based  classifications  are  constitutional  only  when  they  satisfy  a \nheightened standard of review known as intermediate scrutiny. City of Cleburne v. \nCleburne  Living  Ctr.,  473  U.S.  432,  440  (1985).  To  satisfy  this  standard,  a \nclassification must substantially relate to an important government interest. Miss. \nUniv. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 724 (1982). The State bears the burden to \nproffer an exceedingly persuasive justification for the classification. Sessions v. \nMorales-Santana,  137  S.  Ct.  1678,  1690  (2017).  An  exceedingly  persuasive \njustification  is  one  that  is  “genuine,  not  hypothesized  or  invented  post  hoc  in \nresponse to litigation.” United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996). \n  23 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 107   Filed 05/13/22   Page 24 of 32\nThe State again argues that the Act’s purpose is to protect minors from \nexperimental  medications  and  to  stop  medical  providers  from  “aggressively \npushing”  these  medications  on  minors.  Defs.’  Br.  (Doc.  74)  at  109–120.  As \nexplained  above,  the  State  puts  on  no  evidence  to  show  that  transitioning \nmedications are “experimental.” The record indicates that at least twenty-two major \nmedical  associations  in  the  United  States  endorse  these  medications  as  well-\nestablished, evidence-based methods for treating gender dysphoria in minors. Tr. \nat 25, 97–98, 126–27. Finally, nothing in the record shows that medical providers \nare pushing transitioning medications on minors. Accordingly, the State’s proffered \njustifications are hypothesized, not exceedingly persuasive. Thus, Minor Plaintiffs \nare substantially likely to succeed on their Equal Protection claim. \niii.  Void-for-Vagueness Claim \nPlaintiffs collectively claim that the Act is void for vagueness under the Fifth \nand Fourteenth Amendments because it does not sufficiently define “what actions \nconstitute  ‘caus[ing]’  any  of  the  proscribed  activities  upon  a  minor.”  Compl. \n(Doc. 1) at 34–35. Under the void-for-vagueness doctrine, a penal statute must \n“define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can \nunderstand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage \narbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.” United States v. Marte, 356 F.3d 1336, \n1342  (11th  Cir.  2004)  (quoting  United  States  v.  Fisher,  289  F.3d  1329,  1333 \n  24 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 107   Filed 05/13/22   Page 25 of 32\n(11th Cir. 2002)). A federal court reviews a void-for-vagueness claim only when the \nlitigant alleges a constitutional harm. Bankshot Billiards, Inc. v. City of Ocala, \n634 F.3d 1340, 1349–50 (11th Cir. 2011). \nIn this context, constitutional harm comes in two forms: (1) where a criminal \ndefendant violates a vague statute, comes under prosecution, and then moves to \ndismiss the charges on the grounds that he or she lacked notice that his or her conduct \nwas  unlawful;  and  (2)  where  a  civil  plaintiff  is  “chilled  from  engaging  in \nconstitutional activity” due to a vague statute. Dana’s R.R. Supply v. Att’y Gen., \n807 F.3d 1235, 1241 (11th Cir. 2015). Here, Plaintiffs’ void-for-vagueness claim \nfalls into the second category. \nPlaintiffs, however, are not substantially likely to succeed on their claim. \nUnder ALA. CODE § 13A-2-5(a), a person is liable for causing a crime “if the result \nwould not have occurred but for his conduct, operating either alone or concurrently \nwith another cause, unless the concurrent cause was sufficient to produce the result \nand the conduct of the actor clearly insufficient.” The fact that the Act has a scienter \nrequirement greatly weighs against Plaintiffs’ void-for-vagueness claim. See, e.g., \nGonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124, 149 (2007) (“The Court has made clear that \nscienter requirements alleviate vagueness concerns.”); Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. \n379, 395 (1979) (“This Court has long recognized that the constitutionality of a \n  25 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 107   Filed 05/13/22   Page 26 of 32\nvague statutory standard is closely related to whether that standard incorporates a \nrequirement of mens rea.”). \nAlso weighing against Plaintiffs’ claim is the State’s interpretation of the Act. \nDuring  the  preliminary  injunction  hearing,  Alabama  Solicitor  General  Edmund \nLaCour  explained  that  a  person  must  administer  or  prescribe  transitioning \nmedications to violate the Act. Tr. at 409–11. General LaCour opined that a person \ncannot violate the Act simply by advising a minor to take transitioning medications \nor  by  driving  a  minor  to  a  gender  clinic  where  transitioning  medications  are \nadministered. Id. at 410. \nAdditionally, the statutory scienter requirement and the State’s interpretation \nboth align with the modern, plain-language definition of the word cause. According \nto Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary, “cause” means to “effect by command, authority, \nor force” or “bring into existence” an action. Cause, MERRIAM-WEBSTER UNABR. \nDICTIONARY (3rd ed. 2002). Based on the record evidence, Plaintiffs do not show \nthat they have been chilled from engaging in constitutional activity due to the Act. \nPlaintiffs  are  therefore  not  substantially  likely  to  succeed  on  their  void-for-\nvagueness claim at this stage of litigation. \niv.  Free Speech Claim \nPlaintiffs collectively claim that the Act violates their First Amendment right \nto  free  speech  by  prohibiting  “any  ‘person,’  including  physicians,  healthcare \n  26 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 107   Filed 05/13/22   Page 27 of 32\nprofessionals,  or  even  parents,  from  engaging  in  speech  that  would  ‘cause’  a \ntransgender  minor  to  receive  medical  treatment  for  gender  dysphoria.”  Compl. \n(Doc. 1) at 33–34. The First Amendment provides that “Congress shall make no law \n. . . abridging the freedom of speech[.]” U.S. CONST. AMEND. I. At its core, “the First \nAmendment means that government” generally “has no power to restrict expression \nbecause of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content.” Police Dep’t of \nCity of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 95 (1972). \nThe  Amendment,  however,  offers  no  protection  to  words  that  incite  or \nconstitute criminal activity. For example, sexually derogatory remarks may violate \nTitle VII’s general prohibition of sexual discrimination in the workplace. 42 U.S.C. \n§  2000-e2;  see  also  29  C.F.R.  §  1604.11(a)  (explaining  that,  under  certain \ncircumstances, “[u]nwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other \nverbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature” are actionable as sexual harassment \nunder Title VII (emphasis added)). Likewise, “[s]peech attempting to arrange the \nsexual abuse of children is no more constitutionally protected than speech attempting \nto arrange any other type of crime.” United States v. Hornaday, 392 F.3d 1306, 1311 \n(11th Cir. 2004). More examples abound, but the point is this: Where the State “does \nnot target conduct on the basis of its expressive content, acts are not shielded from \nregulation merely because they express a discriminatory idea or philosophy.” R.A.V. \nv. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 390 (1992). \n  27 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 107   Filed 05/13/22   Page 28 of 32\nAs explained supra Section III.A.1.iii, the Act does not criminalize speech \nthat could indirectly lead to a minor taking transitioning medications. Rather, the \nonly  speech  criminalized  by  Act  is  that  which  compels  the  administration  or \nprescription of transitioning medications to minors. Accordingly, the Act targets \nconduct (administration and prescription), not speech. Plaintiffs are therefore not \nsubstantially likely to succeed on their First Amendment claim. \n2.  Plaintiffs’ Preemption Claim \nParent  Plaintiffs,  Minor  Plaintiffs,  and  Healthcare  Plaintiffs  bring  their \npreemption  claim  under  Section  1557  of  the  Affordable  Care  Act,  42  U.S.C. \n§ 18116. Compl. (Doc. 1) at 31. Section 1557, through its incorporation of the \nTitle IX, prohibits discrimination based on sex and the denial of benefits based on \nsex  in  any  health  program  or  activity  that  receives  federal  funding. 42  U.S.C. \n§ 18116(a); 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. Here, Plaintiffs generally rely on the same \narguments Minor Plaintiffs made in support of their Equal Protection claim. Pls.’ \nBr. (Doc. 8) at 49–52; Tr. at 379. \nAt this stage of litigation, Plaintiffs’ preemption claim fails. As explained \nsupra Section III.A.1.ii, only Minor Plaintiffs are substantially likely to succeed on \ntheir  Equal  Protection  claim.  Additionally,  Section  1557—by  incorporating  the \nenforcement  mechanism  of  Title  IX—“is  enforceable  against  institutions  and \nprograms that receive federal funds, but does not authorize suits against individuals.” \n  28 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 107   Filed 05/13/22   Page 29 of 32\nHill v. Cundiff, 797 F.3d 948, 977 (11th Cir. 2015). It is presently unclear how \nPlaintiffs  may  bring  their  preemption  claim  against  Defendants  who  are  state \nofficials, not institutions. Due to these concerns, Plaintiffs are not substantially likely \nto succeed on their preemption claim. \nB.  Irreparable Harm \nThe Court next considers whether Parent Plaintiffs and Minor Plaintiffs will \nsuffer irreparable harm absent injunctive relief.16 Harm “is ‘irreparable’ only if it \ncannot be undone through monetary remedies.” Ne. Fla. Chapter of Ass’n of Gen. \nContractors of Am., 896 F.2d at 1285. An irreparable harm is one that is “actual and \nimminent, not remote or speculative.” Odebrecht Const., Inc. v. Sec’y, Fla. Dep’t of \nTransp., 715 F.3d 1268, 1288 (11th Cir. 2013). The risk of suffering severe medical \nharm constitutes irreparable harm. See, e.g., Bowen v. City of New York, 476 U.S. \n467, 483 (1986) (explaining that a risk of suffering “a severe medical setback” is an \nirreparable injury); Blaine v. N. Brevard Cnty. Hosp. Dist., 312 F. Supp. 3d 1295, \n1306 (M.D. Fla. 2018) (finding irreparable harm where doctor plaintiffs could not \nprovide necessary medical care to their patients). \nThe  Act  prevents  Parent  Plaintiffs  from  treating  their  children  with \ntransitioning medications subject to medically accepted standards. S.B. 184, ALA. \n \n16 See Church v. City of Huntsville, 30 F.3d 1332, 1342 (11th Cir. 1994) (explaining that a court \nneed not consider whether a plaintiff shows irreparable harm if he or she does not show a \nsubstantial likelihood of success on his or her claims). \n  29 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 107   Filed 05/13/22   Page 30 of 32\n2022 REG. SESS. § 4(a)(1)–(3) (Ala. 2022). The record shows that, without these \nmedications, Minor Plaintiffs will suffer severe medical harm, including anxiety, \ndepression, eating disorders, substance abuse, self-harm, and suicidality. Tr. at 20, \n167. Additionally, the evidence shows that Minor Plaintiffs will suffer significant \ndeterioration in their familial relationships and educational performance. Id. at 35, \n112–13. The Court therefore concludes that Parent Plaintiffs and Minor Plaintiffs \nwill suffer irreparable harm absent injunctive relief. \nC.  Balance of Harms & Public Interests \nThe Court now considers the final two elements together. To satisfy the third \nand fourth elements of a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff must show that the harm \nshe will likely suffer without an injunction outweighs any harm that her opponent \nwill suffer from the injunction and that the injunction would not disserve (or be \nadverse to) the public interest. Scott v. Roberts, 612 F.3d 1279, 1290 (11th Cir. \n2010).  These  factors  merge  when  the  State  is  the  opponent.  Swain  v.  Junior, \n958 F.3d 1081, 1091 (11th Cir. 2020) (per curiam). \nThis case largely presents two competing interests. On one hand, “preliminary \ninjunctions of legislative enactments—because they interfere with the democratic \nprocess and lack the safeguards against abuse or error that come with a full trial on \nthe merits—must be granted reluctantly and only upon a clear showing that the \ninjunction before trial is definitely demanded by the Constitution and by the other \n  30 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 107   Filed 05/13/22   Page 31 of 32\nstrict legal and equitable principles that restrain courts.” Ne. Fla. Chapter of Ass’n \nof Gen. Contractors of Am., 896 F.2d at 1285. On the other hand, “[a] democratic \nsociety rests, for its continuance, upon the healthy, well-rounded growth of young \npeople into full maturity as citizens, with all that implies.” Prince v. Massachusetts, \n321 U.S. 158, 168–69 (1944). \nBased on the record evidence, the Court finds that the imminent threat of harm \nto Parent Plaintiffs and Minor Plaintiffs—i.e., severe physical and/or psychological \nharm—outweighs the harm the State will suffer from an injunction. The Court \nfurther finds that an injunction is not adverse to the public interest. To the contrary, \nenjoining the Act upholds and reaffirms the “enduring American tradition” that \nparents—not the States or federal courts—play the primary role in nurturing and \ncaring for their children. Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 232 (1972). Accordingly, \nthe final two factors favor injunctive relief. \nIV.  SECURITY \nDefendants argue that, if injunctive relief is appropriate, the Court should \nrequire each Healthcare Plaintiff to post a $1 million security. Defs.’ Br. (Doc. 74) \nat 159–60.17 Calculating the “amount of an injunction bond is within the sound \ndiscretion of the district court.” Carillon Importers, Ltd. v. Frank Pesce Int’l Grp., \n \n17 According to Defendants, this amount represents that “by which [Healthcare] Plaintiffs will be \nunjustly enriched should they be allowed to administer profitable (and illegal) medical procedures \nto kids.” Defs.’ Br. (Doc. 74) at 160. \n  31 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 107   Filed 05/13/22   Page 32 of 32\n112 F.3d 1125, 1127 (11th Cir. 1997) (per curiam). Here, the Court finds that a \nsecurity bond is not necessary for three reasons. First, as explained supra Part III, \nHealthcare Plaintiffs themselves are not entitled to preliminary injunctive relief. \nSecond, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 does not require the United States to pay \nsecurity. FED. R. CIV. P. 65(c). Finally, Defendants do not allege that they will suffer \nany cost or economic harm if they are wrongly enjoined from enforcing the Act. \nDefs.’ Br. (Doc. 74) at 159–60. The Court therefore relieves Plaintiffs from posting \nsecurity under Rule 65. \nV.  CONCLUSION \nFor  these  reasons,  the  Court  GRANTS  in  part  Plaintiffs’  motion  for \npreliminary injunction (Doc. 7) and ENJOINS Defendants from enforcing Section \n4(a)(1)–(3) of the Act pending trial. The Court GRANTS in part the United States’s \nmotion for preliminary injunction (Doc. 62) to the same degree and effect. All other \nprovisions of the Act remain enforceable. \nDONE and ORDERED May 13, 2022. \n \n \n \n_________________________________ \nLILES C. BURKE \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n  32 ",

Whether a law that facially creates sex-based classifications \nis exempt from heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause if \nsuch  sex-based  regulations  apply  to  both  males  and  females  or  the \nclassification is assertedly based on biological differences between males \nand females. \n3.  Whether the definition of sex discrimination differs under the \nEqual Protection Clause and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. \nii \n\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 129     Date Filed: 09/11/2023     Page: 17 of 101 \n \nDate: September 11, 2023 \ns/ Jeffrey P.

Plaintiffs-Appellees (“Plaintiffs”) include parents of minor \nchildren who have been prescribed these medications or may require \nthem in the future (“Parent Plaintiffs”), as well as the children (“Minor \nPlaintiffs”).  After  an  extended  evidentiary  hearing,  the  district  court \nfound that the provision of such medications is established medical care \nand that being deprived of them would cause Minor Plaintiffs severe \nharm. \nThe panel’s opinion departs from centuries of precedent regarding \nparental authority and decades of precedent requiring the application of \nheightened scrutiny to sex-based laws. These issues are of exceptional \nimportance because they affect all parents of minor children and reverse \nbedrock principles of sex discrimination law, as evidenced by the fact that \nthe Eighth Circuit and every federal district court to rule in similar cases \nhas held that similar laws are sex-based and, as such, require heightened \nscrutiny.

Ladapo, No. 4:23CV114-RH-MAF, 2023 \nWL 3833848 (N.D. Fla. June 6, 2023). This Court should grant rehearing. \nCOURSE OF PROCEEDINGS \nAND DISPOSITION OF THE CASE \nPlaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction in the district court \non  the  grounds  that  the  Act  (1)  infringes  the  Parent  Plaintiffs’ \nfundamental rights under the Due Process Clause to obtain established \nmedical care for their children, and (2) discriminates based on sex in \nviolation  of  the  Minor  Plaintiffs’  rights  under  the  Equal  Protection \nClause.  After  a  two-day  evidentiary  hearing  and  consideration  of \nextensive documentary evidence, the district court granted a preliminary \ninjunction,  finding  that  the  Act  likely  violated  Parent  Plaintiffs’ \n“fundamental right to direct the medical care of their children,” which \n2 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 129     Date Filed: 09/11/2023     Page: 24 of 101 \n \n“includes the more specific right to treat their children with transitioning \nmedications subject to medically accepted standards.” Doc. 107 at 21. The \ndistrict court also held that the Minor Plaintiffs were substantially likely \nto  prevail  on  their  equal  protection  claim  because  the  Act  bars \nmedications  only  if  prescribed  or  administered  “for  the  purpose  of \nattempting to alter the appearance of or affirm the minor’s perception of \nhis or her gender or sex, if that appearance or perception is inconsistent \nwith the minor’s sex as defined in this [act].” Ala. Code § 26-26-4(a). \nDoc. 107 at 23. \nA panel of this Court vacated the preliminary injunction, ruling \nthat “Plaintiffs have not shown it to be likely that the Due Process Clause \nof  the  Constitution  guarantees  a  fundamental  ‘right  to  treat  [one’s] \nchildren with transitioning medications subject to medically accepted \nstandards,’” (Opinion at 34) and that although the Act bars treatment \nonly for minors who perceive their sex to differ from their birth sex, it \ndoes not require heightened scrutiny because it “does not establish an \nunequal regime for males and females” and “refers to sex only because \nthe medical procedures that it regulates ... are themselves sex-based,” \n(Opinion at 42).  \n3 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 129     Date Filed: 09/11/2023     Page: 25 of 101 \n \nThe panel further concluded that the Supreme Court’s decision in \nBostock v. Clayton County, holding that it “is impossible to discriminate \nagainst a person for being … transgender without discriminating against \nthat  individual  based  on  sex,”  140  S.  Ct.  1731,  1741  (2020),  was \ninapplicable to an equal protection case. (Opinion at 44.) The panel also \nruled that this Court’s decision in Glenn v. Bumby, holding that, under \nthe  Equal  Protection  Clause,  “discrimination  against  a  transgender \nindividual because of her gender-nonconformity is sex discrimination,” \n663  F.3d  1312,  1317  (11th  Cir.  2011),  also  did  not  apply  because  it \nconcerned employment. (Opinion at 45.) \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nThe  Act  prohibits  puberty-delaying  medications  and  hormone \ntherapy from being prescribed to a minor “for the purpose of attempting \nto alter the appearance of or affirm the minor’s perception of his or her \ngender or sex, if that appearance or perception is inconsistent with the \nminor’s sex as defined in this act.” Ala. Code § 26-26-4(a). A violation of \nthis provision is a Class C felony. Id. § 26-26-4(c). This appeal does not \ninvolve the Act’s prohibition of surgical treatments for minors. \n4 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 129     Date Filed: 09/11/2023     Page: 26 of 101 \n \nARGUMENT \nI.  The  Panel’s  Parental  Rights  Holding  Conflicts  With \nSupreme Court and Eleventh Circuit Precedent. \nThe panel’s holding that parents have no substantive due process \ninterest in directing their children’s medical care conflicts with centuries \nof common law and Supreme Court precedent and with decisions of this \nCourt.  Parents’  authority  to  care  for  their  children  is  a  “principle  of \njustice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be \nranked as fundamental.” Snyder v. Commonwealth of Mass., 291 U.S. 97, \n105  (1934)  (cited  in  Washington  v.  Glucksberg,  521  U.S.  702,  720-21 \n(1997)). In Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584, 602 (1979), the Supreme Court \nheld that this principle includes the right “to seek and follow medical \nadvice.” This Court followed Parham in Arnold v. Board of Education of \nEscambia County, 880 F.2d 305, 313 (11th Cir. 1989), and Bendiburg v. \nDempsey, 909 F.2d 463, 470 (11th Cir. 1990), both of which affirmed “the \nright of parents to generally make decisions concerning the treatment to \nbe given to their children.”  \nOur  nation’s  history  and  traditions  have  long  recognized  that \n“parental care for children [is] not only an obligation, but also an inherent \nright.” R.J.D. v. Vaughn Clinic, P.C., 572 So. 2d 1225, 1227 (Ala. 1990). \n5 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 129     Date Filed: 09/11/2023     Page: 27 of 101 \n \n“The  parents’  common  law  duty  to  care  for  their  children  is  widely \nrecognized: ‘It is ordinarily for the parent in the first instance to decide \n... what is actually necessary for the protection and preservation of the \nlife and health of his child,’” including “‘[i]n such matters as deciding on \nthe need for surgical or hospital treatment … except in those extreme \ninstances whether the state takes over to rescue the child from parental \nneglect or to save its life.’” Id. at 1228 (cleaned up); see also Ex Parte \nE.R.G., 73 So. 3d 634, 665 (Ala. 2011) (same).  \nParham followed this traditional common law rule: \n[O]ur constitutional system long ago rejected any notion that \nthat a child is “the mere creature of the State” and, on the \ncontrary,  asserted  that  parents  generally  “have  the  right, \ncoupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare [their \nchildren] for additional obligations.” \n442 U.S. at 602-03 (quoting Pierce v. Society Soc’y of Sisters of the Holy \nNames of Jesus & Mary, 268 U.S. 510, 535 (1925)). “Surely, this includes \na ‘high duty’ to recognize symptoms of illness and to seek and follow \nmedical advice.” 442 U.S. at 602. \nThe  panel’s  holding  that  Parham  involved  only  procedural  due \nprocess cannot be squared with the express articulation of a substantive \nparental right “to seek and follow medical advice.” Id. That conclusion is \n6 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 129     Date Filed: 09/11/2023     Page: 28 of 101 \n \nconfirmed by Parham’s reliance on other parental rights cases, id. at 602-\n03, the Supreme Court’s comparison of the parent’s medical decision \nmaking in Parham to the parents’ educational decision making in Myer \nand  Pierce,  id.  at  603-04,  and  the  Supreme  Court’s  conclusion  that \n“[n]either state officials nor federal courts are equipped to review such \nparental decisions,” id. at 604.  \nIn the four decades since Parham was decided, both the Supreme \nCourt and this Court have recognized its importance as a substantive \nparental rights case. Troxel v. Granville—a decision about whether the \nstate could override a parent’s judgment about grandparent visitation—\ncited Parham extensively. 530 U.S. 57, 66, 68, 69 (2000). Arnold found \nthat Parham “established the parental right to decide whether to commit \none’s own child to a mental institution.” 880 F.2d at 313. And Bendiburg \naffirmed a district court’s reliance on Parham to uphold “the right of \nparents to generally make decisions concerning the treatment to be given \nto their children.” 909 F.2d at 470.  \nThe panel’s decision conflicts with this controlling Eleventh Circuit \nlaw.  The  panel  decision  states  that  Bendiburg  recognized  only  a \nprocedural, not a substantive due process right. That is flatly wrong: \n7 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 129     Date Filed: 09/11/2023     Page: 29 of 101 \n \nBendiburg affirmed the district court’s denial of summary judgment “on \nboth the substantive and procedural due process claims,” 909 F.2d at 469 \n(emphasis added), where the district court concluded that parents have \na substantive due process right to determine “whether to pursue non-\nemergency extraordinarily intrusive medical treatment for one’s child.” \nBendiburg v. Dempsey, 707 F. Supp. 1318, 1339 (N.D. Ga. 1989) (citing \nParham, 442 U.S. at 602-04).  \nThe panel alludes to Bendiburg’s holding on this critical issue in a \nfootnote, stating: “To the extent that Bendiberg supports the proposition \nthat parents have a substantive due process right relating to the medical \ntreatment  that  their  children  receive,  its  reasoning  is  not  equally \napplicable to situations involving parents’ ability to affirmatively obtain \ncertain medical treatment for their children that the State prohibits.” \n(Opinion at 33 n.17.) Bendiburg, however, makes no such distinction and \naffirmed the district court’s reliance on Parham, which involved the right \nto obtain care for a child, not to refuse it.  \nThe panel decision also departs from Supreme Court and Circuit \nlaw by holding that Plaintiffs must show that parents in 1868 had a right \nto obtain puberty blockers and hormones, notwithstanding that their use \n8 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 129     Date Filed: 09/11/2023     Page: 30 of 101 \n \n“did not occur until well into the twentieth century.” (Opinion at 27.) If \nthat  were  the  relevant  test,  the  government  could  dictate  parents’ \ndecisions about antibiotics, most forms of anesthesia, and treatments for \nchildhood cancers, asthma, and diabetes, none of which existed in 1868. \nParents  would  have  no  substantive  due  process  right  to  raise  their \nchildren  in  contemporary  religious  faiths  or  to  send  them  to  many \ncontemporary  private  schools,  which  similarly  did  not  exist  in  their \ncurrent form in 1868. \nNothing in Parham or the Supreme Court’s other parental rights \ndecisions supports that myopic approach. Rather, as the Supreme Court \nhas  made  clear,  courts  must  consider  history  and  tradition  in \ndetermining how to describe a fundamental right at the appropriate level \nof generality. Washington, 521 U.S. at 722-25. Here, the right of parents \nrather than the government to make medical decisions for their children \nis based on “centuries of legal doctrine and practice.” Id. at 723. Following \nthat tradition, the Supreme Court has held that parents have a right “to \nrecognize symptoms of illness [in their children] and to seek and obtain \nmedical advice,” Parham, 442 U.S. at 602, which recognizes that the \n9 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 129     Date Filed: 09/11/2023     Page: 31 of 101 \n \nspecifics of such advice will evolve as medical knowledge and practice \ndevelop.  \nThe panel’s decision also conflicts with precedent in asserting that \nparents do not have a protected right to obtain medical care for their \nchildren because adults do not have any such right for themselves. That \ndisregards  the  bedrock  principle  that  parental  rights  and  duties  are \nflipsides of the same coin. Parham, 442 U.S. at 602-03. Because parents \nhave  a  duty  to  provide  their  children  with  housing,  sustenance, \neducation, and medical care, parents have a corresponding right to be \nfree  from  unjustified  governmental  interference  in  obtaining  these \nnecessities for their children, even if adults have no right to them. For \nexample,  adults  have  no  right  to  education,  but  parents  have  a \nsubstantive due process right to “control the education of their own.” \nMeyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 401 (1923).  \nII.  The  Panel’s  Equal  Protection  Holding  Conflicts  With \nDecisions of the Supreme Court and this Court. \nThe  panel  opinion  marks  the  first  time  this  Court  has  applied \nrational basis review to a law that, on its face, classifies based on sex. \nThe decision is a dramatic departure from Eleventh Circuit precedent \nand conflicts with controlling Supreme Court caselaw.  \n10 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 129     Date Filed: 09/11/2023     Page: 32 of 101 \n \nThe panel decision acknowledges that the Act “refers to sex,” and \nregulates “sex-based” treatments. (Opinion at 42 (emphasis omitted).) \nDespite  this  acknowledgment,  and  without  citing  any  authority,  the \npanel opinion applied only rational basis review because “it is difficult to \nimagine” how a state might regulate in this area “without referencing sex \nin some way.” (Id. at 43.) In fact, the Act could do so by barring the \nproscribed medications for all adolescents; instead, it does so based on \nsex, barring treatment only when “for the purpose of attempting to alter \nthe appearance of or affirm the minor’s perception of his or her gender or \nsex, if that appearance or perception is inconsistent with the minor’s sex \nas defined in this act.” Ala. Code § 26-26-4(a). Even if the state could \njustify this selective restriction of medications only when prescribed for \ntransgender  adolescents,  that  would  not  transform  an  expressly  sex-\nbased law into one that is sex-neutral. The panel’s conclusion that the \nAct is not subject to heightened scrutiny merely because it regulates \nmedical treatments conflicts with relevant Supreme Court and Eleventh \nCircuit  precedents,  which  consistently  hold  that  all  sex-based \nclassifications require heightened scrutiny. See, e.g., United  States v. \nVirginia, 518 U.S. 515, 555 (1996); Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190 (1976); \n11 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 129     Date Filed: 09/11/2023     Page: 33 of 101 \n \nAdams ex rel. Kasper v. Sch. Bd. of St. Johns Cnty., 57 F.4th at 791, 801 \n(11th Cir. 2022). \nAs the Supreme Court has made clear, there is no exception to this \nrule. The mere invocation of sex-based biological differences does not \nimmunize a sex-based law from heightened review. See, e.g., Sessions v. \nMorales-Santana, 582 U.S. 47, 58-59 (2017); Nguyen v. INS, 533 U.S. 53, \n59 (2001). In Nguyen and Morales-Santana, the government argued that \nheightened scrutiny should not apply because the laws drew sex-based \ndistinctions based on biological differences between mothers and fathers, \nbut  the  Court  applied  heightened  scrutiny  in  both  cases,  strongly \naffirming that heightened scrutiny applies to all sex-based laws.  \nThis  Court  has  agreed.  In  Adams,  57  F.4th  at  801,  this  Court \nreviewed a school bathroom policy based on a student’s “biological sex.” \nId.  This  Court  applied  heightened  scrutiny  because  the  policy’s \nclassification of “sex determined at birth ... is a sex-based classification.” \nId. The same is true here, where the Act’s prohibition turns expressly on \na minor’s sex. For example, under the Act, “a person identified as male \nat birth could receive testosterone therapy to conform to a male identity, \nbut a person identified female at birth could not.” L.W. ex rel. Williams v. \n12 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 129     Date Filed: 09/11/2023     Page: 34 of 101 \n \nSkrmetti, 73 F.4th 408, 422 (6th Cir. 2023) (White, J., concurring in part \nand dissenting in part); see also Brandt, 47 F.4th at 669 (“[U]nder the \nact, medical procedures that are permitted for a minor of one sex are \nprohibited for a minor of another sex.”).  \nFor that reason, the panel opinion’s reliance on Geduldig v. Aiello, \n417 U.S. 484 (1974), and Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Org., 142 S. \nCt. 2228 (2022), is misplaced. The laws there drew classifications based \non pregnancy and abortion; in contrast, the Act facially discriminates \nbased on sex, barring treatment if—and only if— “performed for the \npurpose of attempting to alter the appearance of or affirm the minor’s \nperception of his or her gender or sex, if that appearance or perception is \ninconsistent with the minor’s sex” at birth. Ala. Code § 26-26-4(a). As the \nSupreme Court held of a similarly facially sex-based policy in in City of \nLos Angeles v. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702, 715 (1978), “[o]n its face, this [law] \ndiscriminates on the basis of sex whereas the General Electric plan [like \nthe plan in Geduldig] discriminated on the basis of a special physical \ndisability.”  \nThe opinion also conflicts with the Supreme Court’s holding that it \n“is impossible to discriminate against a person for being … transgender \n13 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 129     Date Filed: 09/11/2023     Page: 35 of 101 \n \nwithout discriminating against that individual based on sex.” Bostock, \n140 S. Ct. at 1741. Bostock confirmed what this Circuit held a decade \nearlier  in  Glenn,  663  F.3d  at  1317.  Contrary  to  the  panel’s  opinion, \nneither the Supreme Court nor this Court has held that whether a law \nclassifies based on sex varies from one context (such as employment) to \nanother (such as education, medical benefits, or jury service). See, e.g., \nMiss.  Univ.  for  Women  v.  Hogan,  458  U.S.  718  (1982);  Frontiero  v. \nRichardson, 411 U.S. 677 (1973); J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B., 511 U.S. \n127 (1994). \nThe panel also attempts to distinguish Bostock because it concerned \nsex  discrimination  under  Title  VII  rather  than  under  the  Equal \nProtection Clause. (Opinion at 44.) But that approach directly conflicts \nwith both Supreme Court and Eleventh Circuit precedents, which have \napplied the same standard in equal protection and Title VII cases to \ndetermine whether a law treats individuals differently based on their sex. \nSee,  e.g.,  GE  Co.  v.  Gilbert,  429  U.S.  125  (1976)  (relying  on  equal \nprotection analysis to resolve a sex discrimination claim under Title VII); \nGlenn, 663 F.3d at 1316-17 (relying on Title VII precedents to hold that \ndiscrimination against transgender employees violates equal protection). \n14 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 129     Date Filed: 09/11/2023     Page: 36 of 101 \n \nThe panel’s opinion also conflicts with clear precedent that equal \napplication of a sex-based rule to both males and females does not render \nit sex-neutral. As Supreme Court precedent recognizes, such a policy is \nsex-based even if it subjects all males and females to the same rule. See \nBostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1744 (“[A]n employer who intentionally fires an \nindividual …  transgender  employee …  violates  the  law  even  if  the \nemployer  is  willing  to  subject  all  male  and  female …  transgender \nemployees to the same rule.” (emphasis added)); J.E.B., 511 U.S. at 140-\n41  (holding  peremptory  challenges  based  on  a  juror’s  sex  are \nunconstitutional, even though they can be applied equally to both sexes, \nbecause the Equal Protection Clause protects each person—not merely \nwomen as a group or men as a group—from disparate treatment based \non sex). That is especially clear here, where the only way to determine \nwhether the rule applies is to know the person’s sex. Before passage of \nthe Act, the only information a doctor needed to prescribe hormones or \npuberty blockers was the patient’s medical need. After passage, a doctor \nmust also know the person’s sex. \n15 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 129     Date Filed: 09/11/2023     Page: 37 of 101 \n \nIII.  This Appeal Involves Questions of Exceptional Importance.  \nThis panel’s holding that parents have no constitutionally protected \ninterest in making medical decisions for their children runs counter to \nordinary citizens’ most deep-seated expectations and leaves millions of \nparents  vulnerable  to  laws,  policies,  and  bureaucratic  decisions  that \ndictate what medical care their children may receive. It is difficult to \noverstate  the  degree  to  which  that  holding  threatens  “Western \ncivilization concepts of the family as a unit with broad parental authority \nover minor children.” Parham, 442 U.S. at 602.  \nThe panel’s holding that facially sex-based laws are subject only to \nrational basis review if they apply equally to both sexes or are assertedly \nbased on biological differences between male and females would exempt \ncountless  facially  discriminatory  laws  and  policies  from  meaningful \nreview—as would the panel’s holding that a law or policy that facially \nclassifies  based  on  sex  under  Title  VII  does  not  necessarily  facially \nclassify based on sex under the Equal Protection Clause.  \n16 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 129     Date Filed: 09/11/2023     Page: 38 of 101 \n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should rehear this appeal en \nbanc.  \ns/Jeffrey P.

Docket No. 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW \n____________________ \n \nBefore  LAGOA,  BRASHER,  Circuit  Judges,  and  BOULEE,*  District \nJudge. \nLAGOA, Circuit Judge: \nThis appeal centers around section 4(a)(1)–(3) of Alabama’s \nVulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act (the “Act”).  Sec-\ntion 4(a)(1)–(3) of the Act states that “no person shall engage in or \ncause” the prescription or administration of puberty blocking med-\nication or cross-sex hormone treatment to a minor “for the purpose \nof attempting to alter the appearance of or affirm the minor’s per-\nception of his or her gender or sex, if that appearance or perception \nis inconsistent with the minor’s sex.”  Thus, section 4(a)(1)–(3) \n \n* Honorable J. P. Boulee, United States District Judge for the Northern District \nof Georgia, sitting by designation. \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112295 - 1     D  a Dtea tFei lFedile: d0:9 0/181/2/210/22032  3     P  a Pgaeg: e4:5 3 o of f1 5091  \n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  3 \nmakes it a crime in the State of Alabama to take part in providing \npuberty blockers or cross-sex hormone treatment to a minor for \npurposes of treating a discordance between the minor’s biological \nsex and sense of gender identity. \nShortly  after  the  Act  was  signed  into  law,  a  group  of \ntransgender minors, their parents, and other concerned individuals \nchallenged the Act’s constitutionality, claiming that it violates the \nDue Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Four-\nteenth Amendment.  As part of that lawsuit, the district court is-\nsued a preliminary injunction enjoining Alabama from enforcing \nsection 4(a)(1)–(3) of the Act pending trial, having determined that \nthe plaintiffs are substantially likely to succeed on both of the afore-\nmentioned claims.  Specifically, as to the due process claim, the dis-\ntrict court held that there is a constitutional right to “treat [one’s] \nchildren with transitioning medications subject to medically ac-\ncepted standards” and that the restrictions of section 4(a)(1)–(3) \nlikely impermissibly infringe upon that constitutional right.  As to \nthe equal protection claim, the district court held that  section \n4(a)(1)–(3) classifies on the basis of sex by classifying on the basis of \ngender nonconformity and likely amounts to unlawful discrimina-\ntion under the intermediate scrutiny standard applicable to sex-\nbased classifications. \nOn review, we hold that the district court abused its discre-\ntion in issuing this preliminary injunction because it applied the \nwrong standard of scrutiny.  The plaintiffs have not presented any \nauthority that supports the existence of a constitutional right to \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112295 - 1     D  a Dtea tFei lFedile: d0:9 0/181/2/210/22032  3     P  a Pgaeg: e4:6 4 o of f1 5091  \n4  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \n“treat [one’s] children with transitioning medications subject to \nmedically accepted standards.”  Nor have they shown that section \n4(a)(1)–(3) classifies on the basis of sex or any other protected char-\nacteristic.  Accordingly, section 4(a)(1)–(3) is subject only to ra-\ntional basis review.  Because the district court erred by reviewing \nthe statute under a heightened standard of scrutiny, its determina-\ntion that the plaintiffs have established a substantial likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits cannot stand.  We therefore vacate the pre-\nliminary injunction. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nThe Act was passed by the Alabama Legislature on April 7, \n2022,  and signed into law by Governor Kay Ivey the following day, \nthereby set to become effective on May 8, 2022. \nA.  The Text of the Act \nThe Act contains eleven sections.  For the sake of complete-\nness, each section is described below. \nSection 1 establishes the title of the Act.   \nSection 2 sets forth the following findings by the Alabama \nLegislature: \n(1)  The sex of a person is the biological state of \nbeing female or male, based on sex organs, chromo-\nsomes, and endogenous hormone proﬁles, and is ge-\nnetically encoded into a person at the moment of \nconception, and it cannot be changed. \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112295 - 1     D  a Dtea tFei lFedile: d0:9 0/181/2/210/22032  3     P  a Pgaeg: e4:7 5 o of f1 5091  \n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  5 \n(2)  Some individuals, including minors, may expe-\nrience discordance between their sex and their inter-\nnal sense of identity, and individuals who experience \nsevere psychological distress as a result of this discord-\nance may be diagnosed with gender dysphoria. \n(3)  The cause of the individual’s impression of dis-\ncordance between sex and identity is unknown, and \nthe diagnosis is based exclusively on the individual’s \nself-report of feelings and beliefs. \n(4)  This internal sense of discordance is not per-\nmanent or ﬁxed, but to the contrary, numerous stud-\nies have shown that a substantial majority of children \nwho experience discordance between their sex and \nidentity will outgrow the discordance once they go \nthrough puberty and will eventually have an identity \nthat aligns with their sex. \n(5)  As a result, taking a wait-and-see approach to \nchildren who reveal signs of gender nonconformity \nresults in a large majority of those children resolving \nto an identity congruent with their sex by late adoles-\ncence. \n(6)  Some in the medical community are aggres-\nsively pushing for interventions on minors that medi-\ncally alter the child’s hormonal balance and remove \nhealthy external and internal sex organs when the \nchild expresses a desire to appear as a sex diﬀerent \nfrom his or her own. \n(7)  This  course  of  treatment  for  minors  com-\nmonly  begins  with  encouraging  and  assisting  the \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112295 - 1     D  a Dtea tFei lFedile: d0:9 0/181/2/210/22032  3     P  a Pgaeg: e4:8 6 o of f1 5091  \n6  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nchild to socially transition to dressing and presenting \nas the opposite sex.  In the case of prepubertal chil-\ndren,  as  puberty  begins,  doctors  then  administer \nlong-acting  GnRH  agonist  (puberty  blockers)  that \nsuppress the pubertal development of the child.  This \nuse of puberty blockers for gender nonconforming \nchildren is experimental and not FDA-approved. \n(8)  After puberty blockade, the child is later ad-\nministered “cross-sex” hormonal treatments that in-\nduce the development of secondary sex characteris-\ntics of the other sex, such as causing the development \nof breasts and wider hips in male children taking es-\ntrogen and greater muscle mass, bone density, body \nhair, and a deeper voice in female children taking tes-\ntosterone.  Some children are administered these hor-\nmones independent of any prior pubertal blockade. \n(9)  The ﬁnal phase of treatment is for the individ-\nual to undergo cosmetic and other surgical proce-\ndures, often to create an appearance similar to that of \nthe opposite sex.  These surgical procedures may in-\nclude a mastectomy to remove a female adolescent’s \nbreasts and “bottom surgery” that removes a minor’s \nhealth reproductive organs and creates an artiﬁcial \nform aiming to approximate the appearance of the \ngenitals of the opposite sex. \n(10)  For minors who are placed on puberty block-\ners that inhibit their bodies from experiencing the \nnatural  process  of  sexual  development,  the  over-\nwhelming majority will continue down a path toward \ncross-sex hormones and cosmetic surgery. \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112295 - 1     D  a Dtea tFei lFedile: d0:9 0/181/2/210/22032  3     P  a Pgaeg: e4:9 7 o of f1 5091  \n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  7 \n(11)  This unproven, poorly studied series of inter-\nventions results in numerous harmful eﬀects for mi-\nnors, as well as risks of eﬀects simply unknown due \nto the new and experimental nature of these interven-\ntions. \n(12)  Among the known harms from puberty block-\ners is diminished bone density; the full eﬀect of pu-\nberty blockers on brain development and cognition \nare yet unknown, though reason for concern is now \npresent.  There is no research on the long-term risks \nto minors of persistent exposure to puberty blockers.  \nWith  the  administration  of  cross-sex  hormones \ncomes  increased  risks  of  cardiovascular  disease, \nthromboembolic stroke, asthma, COPD, and cancer. \n(13)  Puberty blockers prevent gonadal maturation \nand thus render patients taking these drugs infertile.  \nIntroducing cross-sex hormones to children with im-\nmature gonads as a direct result of pubertal blockade \nis expected to cause irreversible sterility.  Sterilization \nis also permanent for those who undergo surgery to \nremove reproductive organs, and such persons are \nlikely to suﬀer through a lifetime of complications \nfrom the surgery, infections, and other diﬃculties re-\nquiring yet more medical intervention. \n(14)  Several  studies  demonstrate  that  hormonal \nand surgical interventions often do not resolve the un-\nderlying psychological issues aﬀecting the individual.  \nFor example, individuals who undergo cross-sex cos-\nmetic surgical procedures have been found to suﬀer \nfrom elevated mortality rates higher than the general \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112295 - 1     D  a Dtea tFei lFedile: d0:9 0/181/2/210/22032  3     P  a Pgaeg: e5:0 8 o of f1 5091  \n8  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \npopulation.    They  experience  signiﬁcantly  higher \nrates of substance abuse, depression, and psychiatric \nhospitalizations. \n(15)  Minors, and often their parents, are unable to \ncomprehend and fully appreciate the risk and life im-\nplications, including permanent sterility, that result \nfrom  the  use  of  puberty  blockers,  cross-sex  hor-\nmones, and surgical procedures. \n(16)  For  these  reasons,  the  decision  to  pursue  a \ncourse of hormonal and surgical interventions to ad-\ndress a discordance between the individual’s sex and \nsense of identity should not be presented to or deter-\nmined for minors who are incapable of comprehend-\ning the negative implications and life-course diﬃcul-\nties attending to these interventions. \nSection 3 provides definitions for the terms “minor,” “per-\nson,” and “sex.”  Section 3(1) incorporates the definition of “minor” \nestablished in section 43-8-1 of the Alabama Code, first enacted in \n1975, which is “[a] person who is under 19 years of age.”  Ala. Code \n§ 43-8-1(18).  Section 3(2) defines the term “person” to include \n“[a]ny individual”; “[a]ny agent, employee, official, or contractor of \nany legal entity”; and “[a]ny agent, employee, official, or contractor \nof a school district or the state or any of its political subdivisions or \nagencies.”  Section 3(3) defines the term “sex” to mean “[t]he \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112295 - 1     D  a Dtea tFei lFedile: d0:9 0/181/2/210/22032  3     P  a Pgaeg: e5:1 9 o of f1 5091  \n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  9 \nbiological state of being male or female, based on the individual’s \nsex organs, chromosomes, and endogenous hormone profiles.”   \nSection 4, in broad terms, makes it a felony to perform cer-\ntain medical practices on minors for certain purposes, and reads as \nfollows: \n(a)  Except as provided in subsection (b), no person \nshall engage in or cause any of the following practices \nto be performed upon a minor if the practice is per-\nformed for the purpose of attempting to alter the ap-\npearance of or affirm the minor’s perception of his or \nher gender or sex, if that appearance or perception is \ninconsistent with the minor’s sex as defined in this \nact: \n(1) Prescribing or administering puberty blocking \nmedication to stop or delay normal puberty. \n(2) Prescribing  or  administering  supraphysio-\nlogic[1] doses of testosterone or other androgens to \nfemales. \n(3) Prescribing or administering supraphysiologic \ndoses of estrogen to males. \n(4) Performing surgeries that sterilize, including \ncastration, vasectomy, hysterectomy, oophorec-\ntomy, orchiectomy, and penectomy. \n \n1 Supraphysiologic means of or pertaining to an amount “greater than nor-\nmally present in the body.”  See Supraphysiologic, Merriam-Webster, https://\nwww.merriam-webster.com/medical/supraphysiological. \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 5: 21 0o fo 1f 0519  \n10  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \n(5) Performing surgeries that artificially construct \ntissue with the appearance of genitalia that differs \nfrom  the  individual’s  sex,  including  metoidio-\nplasty, phalloplasty, and vaginoplasty. \n(6) Removing any healthy or non-diseased body \npart or tissue, except for a male circumcision. \n(b)  Subsection (a) does not apply to a procedure \nundertaken to treat a minor born with a medically \nverifiable disorder of sex development, including ei-\nther of the following: \n(1) An individual born with external biological sex \ncharacteristics that are irresolvably ambiguous, in-\ncluding an individual born with 46 XX chromo-\nsomes with virilization, 46 XY chromosomes with \nunder virilization, or having both ovarian and tes-\nticular tissue. \n(2) An individual whom a physician has otherwise \ndiagnosed with a disorder of sexual development, \nin which the physician has determined through \ngenetic  or  biochemical  testing  that  the  person \ndoes not have normal sex chromosome structure, \nsex steroid hormone production, or sex steroid \nhormone action for a male or female. \n(c)  A violation of this section is a Class C felony. \nSection 5, in broad terms, prohibits certain school \nemployees from withholding certain information about mi-\nnor students from their parents and from encouraging or \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 5: 31 1o fo 1f 0519  \n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  11 \ncoercing minor students to do the same.  The section reads \nas follows: \nNo nurse, counselor, teacher, principal, or other ad-\nministrative oﬃcial at a public or private school at-\ntended by a minor shall do either of the following: \n(1)  Encourage or coerce a minor to withhold from \nthe minor’s parent or legal guardian the fact that the \nminor’s perception of his or her gender or sex is in-\nconsistent with the minor’s sex. \n(2)  Withhold from a minor’s parent or legal guard-\nian information related to a minor’s perception that \nhis or her gender or sex is inconsistent with his or her \nsex. \nSection 6 clariﬁes that, except as provided for in section 4, \nnothing in the Act shall be construed as “limiting or preventing” \ncertain mental health professionals from “rendering the services \nfor which they are qualiﬁed by training or experience involving the \napplication of recognized principles, methods, and procedures of \nthe science and professional of psychology and counseling.”   \nSection 7 similarly clariﬁes that “[n]othing in this section \nshall be construed to establish a new or separate standard of care \nfor hospitals or physicians and their patients or otherwise modify, \namend, or supersede” certain other laws of the State of Alabama.   \nSection 8 is a severability clause.  It provides that, “[i]f any \npart, section, or subsection of [the Act] or the application thereof \nto any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity shall \nnot aﬀect parts, sections, subsections, or applications of this act \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 5: 41 2o fo 1f 0519  \n12  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nthat can be given eﬀect without the invalid part, section, subsec-\ntion, or application.”   \nSection 9 clariﬁes that the Act “does not aﬀect a right or \nduty aﬀorded to a licensed pharmacist by state law.”   \nSection 10 clariﬁes that, “[a]lthough this bill would have as \nits purpose or eﬀect the requirement of a new or increased ex-\npenditure of local funds,” it is “excluded from further require-\nments and application under Amendment 621, as amended by \nAmendment 890 . . . because [it] deﬁnes a new crime or amends the \ndeﬁnition of an existing crime.”   \nSection 11, the ﬁnal section, establishes that the Act “shall \nbecome eﬀective 30 days following its passage and approval by the \nGovernor, or its otherwise becoming law.”   \nB.  Procedural History \nOn April 19, 2022, a group of plaintiﬀs initiated this chal-\nlenge to the Act seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  The \ngroup consisted of transgender minors (the “Minor Plaintiﬀs”), the \nparents  of  those  transgender  minors  (the  “Parent  Plaintiﬀs”), \nhealthcare providers who regularly treat transgender youth (the \n“Provider Plaintiﬀs”), and Reverend Paul A. Eknes-Tucker, the Sen-\nior  Pastor  at  Pilgrim  Church  in  Birmingham,  Alabama,  who \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 5: 51 3o fo 1f 0519  \n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  13 \nfrequently counsels parents of transgender children (collectively, \n“Plaintiﬀs”).2   \nThe original complaint generally alleged that: (1) the Act vi-\nolates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by \ndepriving the Parent Plaintiﬀs of their right to direct the upbring-\ning of their children (Count I); (2) the Act violates the Equal Pro-\ntection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by discriminating \nagainst the Minor Plaintiﬀs on the bases of sex and transgender sta-\ntus (Count II); (3) the Act is preempted by section 1557 of the Af-\nfordable Care Act (Count III); (4)  the Act violates the Free Speech \nClause of the First Amendment (Count IV); and (5) the Act is void \nfor vagueness under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment (Count V).  That complaint named the Attorney Gen-\neral of Alabama and several state oﬃcials (collectively, “Alabama”) \nas defendants.3   \nTwo days later, Plaintiﬀs ﬁled a motion for preliminary in-\njunction, seeking a ruling preventing the enforcement of the Act in \nadvance of its May 8, 2022, eﬀective date.4  In light of that request, \n \n2 Reverend Eknes-Tucker is not included as a plaintiff in the operative plead-\ning, the Second Amended Complaint, nor does he take part in this appeal. \n3 The original complaint also included Governor Ivey as a defendant, but the \nparties subsequently moved to dismiss her from the action on May 3, 2022, \npursuant to a joint understanding that she and her office would be bound by \nany forthcoming injunctive relief.  The district court granted that request.   \n4 The motion is styled as a “motion for a temporary restraining order and/or \npreliminary injunction.”  However, because Alabama received notice of the \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 5: 61 4o fo 1f 0519  \n14  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nthe district court expedited the brieﬁng schedule and scheduled a \nhearing for the ﬁrst week of May.   \nOn April 29, 2022, the United States ﬁled a motion to inter-\nvene, as well as its own motion for preliminary injunction similarly \nseeking to prevent enforcement of the Act.  Shortly thereafter, ﬁf-\nteen states moved for leave to ﬁle an amicus brief in support of \nAlabama.  That was followed by a group of at least twenty-two \nprofessional medical and mental health organizations jointly mov-\ning for leave to ﬁle an amicus brief in support of Plaintiﬀs.  The \ndistrict court ultimately granted the motion to intervene and the \nmotions to ﬁle amicus briefs, giving the United States permission \nto participate in the preliminary injunction hearing and taking the \namicus briefs under advisement.   \nThe three-day hearing on Plaintiﬀs’ motion for preliminary \ninjunction began on May 4, 2022.  On that ﬁrst day, the district \ncourt discussed the motion for intervention and heard opening ar-\nguments from the parties.  At that time, Plaintiﬀs represented that \nthey were no longer challenging the portions of section 4 that ban \nsurgical intervention, i.e., subsections (a)(4)–(6), and were instead \nfocusing on the portions of section 4 that ban puberty blockers and \ncross-sex hormone treatment, i.e. subsections (a)(1)–(3).  The fol-\nlowing day, the parties commenced their presentation of the evi-\ndence.  \n \nrequest for injunctive relief, the motion subsequently was addressed only as a \nmotion for preliminary injunction.   \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 5: 71 5o fo 1f 0519  \n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  15 \nPlaintiﬀs ﬁrst tendered Dr. Linda Hawkins and Dr. Morissa \nLadinsky as experts in the treatment of gender dysphoria in mi-\nnors.  Dr. Hawkins is the director of the Gender and Sexuality De-\nvelopment Clinic at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.  She \nhas specialized in treating LGBT youth for roughly twenty-two \nyears and worked with over 4,000 transgender youth.  During her \ntestimony, Dr. Hawkins deﬁned “gender identity” as “the internal \nauthentic hardwired sense of one’s self as male or female.”  She \nfurther testiﬁed that a blanket prohibition on puberty blockers and \nhormone treatment would be “devastating” for transgender youth, \ncomparing it to “removing somebody’s cancer treatment and just \nexpecting them to be okay.”   \nDr. Ladinsky is an associate professor of pediatrics at the \nHeersink School of Medicine at the University of Alabama at Bir-\nmingham (“UAB”) and a board-certiﬁed pediatrician at the aﬃli-\nated hospital.  Dr. Ladinsky opened a gender clinic at UAB in the \nfall of 2015 and, at the time of her testimony, had worked with an \nestimated 400 to 450 minors suﬀering from gender dysphoria.  Dr. \nLadinsky discussed the guidelines on the treatment of gender dys-\nphoria in youth that the UAB gender clinic follows and noted that \nthose guidelines are endorsed by the American Academy of Pedi-\natrics.  She also noted that consent forms must be signed by all legal \nparents  and  guardians  before  a  minor’s  hormonal  therapy  can \nbegin.  According to Dr. Ladinsky, puberty blockers pose some risks \nbut, overall, are safe and reversible.  She described the risks posed \nby puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, related to fertility and \nsexual function, as “small side eﬀect risks.”  Dr. Ladinsky also \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 5: 81 6o fo 1f 0519  \n16  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \ntestiﬁed that the youngest minor for which she prescribed puberty \nblockers was an eleven-year-old female and that about 85 percent \nof her patients who have taken puberty blockers have gone on to \ntake cross-sex hormones.  In her opinion, it is “uncommon” for a \nminor patient taking puberty blockers to stop experiencing gender \ndysphoria and begin identifying with their biological sex.   \nPlaintiﬀs then called Megan Poe (one of the Parent Plain-\ntiﬀs), Dr. Rachel Koe (one of the Provider Plaintiﬀs), and Reverend \nEknes-Tucker to testify about their personal knowledge and expe-\nrience regarding gender dysphoria.   \nPoe is the mother of a biological male who identiﬁes as a \nfemale.  When asked how her child presents as a female, Poe testi-\nﬁed that her child “is very over the top girly,” “loves makeup and \nhair,” and “[is] always worried about her clothes.”  The child began \nshowing signs of a female gender identity at the age of two, accord-\ning to Poe, by wanting girl toys and girl clothes.  The child started \npuberty blockers in sixth grade and then started hormone therapy \nat the age of fourteen.  Poe reported that her child now is “so \nhappy” and “thriving” and has not experienced any side eﬀects \nfrom the treatment.  She insisted that her child is “deﬁnitely not \n[experiencing] a phase” and is “never going to grow out of this.”  \nPoe also said she was afraid that her child would commit suicide if \nthe treatments were no longer available.   \nDr. Koe is a pediatrician in southeast Alabama.  Dr. Koe re-\nported that she treats transgender adolescents but has never treated \na patient with gender dysphoria who later desisted or expressed \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 5: 91 7o fo 1f 0519  \n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  17 \nregret about receiving these types of treatments.  She also testiﬁed \nthat, if the Act takes eﬀect, it will leave her “stuck in a place where \n[she doesn’t] know how to proceed” nor how to provide care for \npatients with gender dysphoria.   \nReverend  Eknes-Tucker  is  the  Senior  Pastor  at  Pilgrim \nChurch in Birmingham, Alabama, and has been a pastor for 45 \nyears.    Reverend  Eknes-Tucker  testiﬁed  that  there  have  been \ntransgender individuals in every congregation that he has served \nand that he has given advice to parents of transgender children on \nnumerous occasions.  He clariﬁed that he has not given medical \nadvice but that he has helped connect parents of transgender chil-\ndren with doctors who provide gender-aﬃrming care.   \nIn addition to this live testimony, Plaintiﬀs produced as evi-\ndence various organizational medical guidelines, sworn declara-\ntions, research articles, and other documents.   \nNext, the United States, as an intervenor on behalf of Plain-\ntiﬀs, tendered Dr. Armand H. Antommaria as an expert in bioethics \nand treatment protocols for adolescents suﬀering from gender dys-\nphoria.  Dr. Antommaria is the chair of pediatric ethics and an at-\ntending physician at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center.    \nDuring his testimony, Dr. Antommaria addressed the dearth of ran-\ndomized controlled trials for the treatment of minors with puberty \nblockers and cross-sex hormone therapy and expressed his concern \nthat such trials “would be unethical,” given the lack of conﬁdence \nthat the control group and the experimental group would receive \nequally eﬃcacious treatment.  He also expressed concern that any \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 6: 01 8o fo 1f 0519  \n18  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nsuch trials “would have substantial methodological limitations,” \ngiven the need to recruit enough participants and conduct a blind \nstudy.  When asked for his opinion regarding the ability of parents \nand adolescents to adequately understand and give informed con-\nsent to the provision of puberty blockers and hormone therapy, Dr. \nAntommaria answered that those treatments are “comparable to \nother decisions that parents and their children make in pediatric \nhealthcare on a frequent basis.”  He further testiﬁed that there are \nno equally eﬀective alternative medical treatments for adolescents \nwith gender dysphoria and that there is not an ethical basis for dis-\ntinguishing between minors experiencing precocious puberty5 and \nminors experiencing gender dysphoria with respect to the provi-\nsion of puberty blockers and hormone treatment.   \nAlong with Dr. Antommaria’s testimony, the United States \npresented, among other things, various organizations’ medical pol-\nicy statements and guidelines, some research and news articles, and \nDr. Antommaria’s declaration and curriculum vitae.  For example, \nthe United States presented the Standards of Care of the World \nProfessional  Association  for  Transgender  Health  (“WPATH”), \nwhich endorse the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormone \ntreatment for minors when certain criteria are met.  The United \nStates also oﬀered statements by the Alabama Psychological Asso-\nciation and the American Academy of Pediatrics supporting the use \nof puberty blockers and cross-sex hormone treatment for minors \nand opposing the Act.  The full record reveals that at least twenty-\n \n5 Precocious puberty is the premature initiation of puberty.   \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 6: 11 9o fo 1f 0519  \n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  19 \ntwo professional medical and mental health organizations support \nthe use of such medications.   \nOn cross-examination, Dr. Antommaria acknowledged that \n“[t]here are risks involved in the treatment course for the treatment \nof gender dysphoria.”  He went on to note that, for puberty block-\ners and cross-sex hormones generally, there is a risk of impaired \nfertility, and that, for estrogen therapy, there is a risk of change in \nsexual function.  When asked whether he agrees that more re-\nsearch is needed to study the eﬃcacy and the costs and beneﬁts of \ngender-aﬃrming care, Dr. Antommaria responded that “more re-\nsearch is needed in all areas of health care.”   \nAlabama, for its part, ﬁrst tendered Dr. James Cantor.  Dr. \nCantor is a clinical psychologist and neuroscientist who was called \nas an expert on psychology, human sexuality, research methodol-\nogy, and the state of research on gender dysphoria.  In response to \nDr. Antommaria’s testimony, Dr. Cantor conﬁrmed that none of \nthe existing studies on puberty blockers and hormone therapies are \nrandomized and opined that there are alternative methodologies \nthat would be more reliable than observational trials, which he de-\nscribed as the lowest quality of evidence.  Dr. Cantor also testiﬁed \nthat the existing research does not support the conclusion that the \nuse of puberty blockers and hormone therapy is “the only safe and \neﬀective treatment for gender dysphoria.”  In his opinion, gender \ndysphoria  can  be  treated  with  a  “watchful  waiting  approach” \nwhereby decisions about medical interventions are withheld, but \ntherapy is continued, until more information becomes available.    \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 6: 22 0o fo 1f 0519  \n20  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nAccording to Dr. Cantor, clinical guidelines suggest that comorbid-\nities, including mental health issues, should be resolved prior to \npursuing puberty blockers and cross-sex hormone treatment.  He \nalso noted that some cases of gender dysphoria have turned out to \nbe prepubescent children misinterpreting their same-sex attraction \nand that blocking puberty in such cases prevents those children \nfrom understanding their sexuality.   \nOn cross-examination, Dr. Cantor acknowledged that he is \nnot  a  medical  doctor  and  that  he  has  not  provided  care  to \ntransgender adolescents under the age of sixteen.   \nAlabama then called Sydney Wright to testify about her per-\nsonal experience with gender dysphoria.  Wright is a biological fe-\nmale who is married to another woman.  At the time of her testi-\nmony, Wright was twenty-three years old.  She testiﬁed that she \nbegan identifying as transgender and receiving related treatment \nwhen she was seventeen years old, which culminated in testos-\nterone therapy for approximately one year when she was nineteen \nyears old.  According to Wright, the testosterone treatment put her \nat a greater risk of heart attack or stroke and caused her to develop \ntachycardia.  She explained that, after a signiﬁcant discussion with \nher grandfather, she stopped identifying as transgender and receiv-\ning testosterone therapy.  She now believes that her doctors mis-\nhandled her treatment and that she simply needed counseling dur-\ning her teenage years.  She also reported that her digestive system \nis “still messed up” and that she may have fertility issues as a result \nof the testosterone therapy that she received over three-and-a-half \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 6: 32 1o fo 1f 0519  \n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  21 \nyears earlier.  When asked what she would tell a young person \nstruggling with gender dysphoria, Wright stated that she would ad-\nvise them to take “a lot of time,” “love [themselves],” and under-\nstand that they can act and dress like the opposite sex without \n“hav[ing] to transition.”   \nIn  addition  to  these  two  witnesses,  Alabama  produced, \namong other things, research papers, foreign countries’ medical \nguidelines, and the declarations of various healthcare professionals \nand individuals with experience related to gender dysphoria.  For \nexample, in terms of healthcare professionals, Alabama produced \na declaration in which Dr. Quentin L. Van Meter6 states that com-\nparing the use of puberty blockers for precocious puberty with the \nuse of puberty blockers for gender dysphoria is like “comparing \napples to oranges,” given the evidence that “normal bone density \ncan’t be fully reestablished” in the latter case and the lack of long-\nterm data on bone, gonad, and brain health.  Alabama also pro-\nduced a declaration in which Dr. Patrick Hunter7 attests that “there \nis currently no established standard of care for transgender-identi-\nﬁed youth” and that “[t]he medical risks of ‘gender-aﬃrming’ in-\nterventions are substantial.”  In terms of individuals with personal \nexperience related to gender dysphoria, Alabama produced the \n \n6 Dr. Van Meter is a board-certified pediatrician and pediatric endocrinologist \nwho currently works in private practice.  \n7 Dr. Hunter is a board-certified pediatrician with a master’s degree in bioeth-\nics who currently holds academic positions at the University of Central Florida \nand Florida State University.  \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 6: 42 2o fo 1f 0519  \n22  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \ndeclaration of Corinna Cohn, a biological male who underwent sex \nreassignment surgery at the age of nineteen—which included the \nremoval of testicles, penectomy, and vaginoplasty—and who, look-\ning back, claims to have been “unprepared to understand the con-\nsequences” of seeking such medical interventions as a teenager.    \nAlabama also produced a declaration in which Carol Freitas, a bio-\nlogical  female  who  previously  experienced  gender  dysphoria, \nclaims that “[transitioning] was the biggest mistake [that she] ever \nmade” and that she instead should have been treated for depression \nand post-traumatic stress disorder related to her “internalized hom-\nophobia and childhood abuse.”  Lastly, in terms of medical opin-\nions from foreign countries, Alabama produced documents show-\ning that public healthcare entities of Sweden, Finland, France, Aus-\ntralia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom have raised concerns \nabout the risks associated with puberty blockers and cross-sex hor-\nmone treatment and supported greater caution and/or more re-\nstrictive criteria in connection with such interventions.   \n  On May 13, 2022, the district court granted in part and de-\nnied in part the motions for preliminary injunction, enjoining Ala-\nbama from enforcing section 4(a)(1)–(3) but allowing the rest of the \nAct to remain in effect.  The ruling was based on, among other \nthings, a determination that Plaintiffs had shown a substantial like-\nlihood of success on the merits as to their substantive due process \nclaim and equal protection claim (Counts I and II), but not as to \ntheir other claims.  With respect to the substantive due process \nclaim (Count I), the district court recognized a fundamental right \nof parents to “treat their children with transitioning medications \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 6: 52 3o fo 1f 0519  \n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  23 \nsubject to medically accepted standards,” held that the Act infringes \nupon that fundamental right and concluded that Alabama had not \nsufficiently  demonstrated  that  the  Act  is  narrowly  tailored  to \nachieve a compelling state interest.  With respect to the equal pro-\ntection  claim  (Count  II),  the  district  court  held  that  the  Act \n“amounts to a sex-based classification” and concluded that Ala-\nbama had not proffered a sufficiently persuasive justification for \nthat classification. \n  Alabama filed a timely notice of appeal on May 16, 2022.8   \nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \n“We review the grant of a preliminary injunction for abuse \nof discretion, reviewing any underlying legal conclusions de novo \nand any findings of fact for clear error.”  Gonzalez v. Governor of \nGeorgia, 978 F.3d 1266, 1270 (11th Cir. 2020).  “A district court \nabuses its discretion if it applies an incorrect legal standard, applies \nthe law in an unreasonable or incorrect manner, follows improper \nprocedures in making a determination, or makes findings of fact \nthat are clearly erroneous.”  Id. (quoting United States v. Estrada, 969 \nF.3d 1245, 1261 (11th Cir. 2020)). \nIII.  ANALYSIS \nA district court may grant injunctive relief only if the mov-\ning party demonstrates that: “(1) it has a substantial likelihood of \n \n8 The operative pleading—the second amended complaint—was filed on Sep-\ntember 19, 2022.  In terms of counts, the second amended complaint contains \nonly the substantive due process claim and the equal protection claim. \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 6: 62 4o fo 1f 0519  \n24  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nsuccess on the merits; (2) irreparable injury will be suffered unless \nthe injunction issues; (3) the threatened injury to the movant out-\nweighs whatever damage the proposed injunction may cause the \nopposing party; and (4) if issued, the injunction would not be ad-\nverse to the public interest.”  Siegel v. LePore, 234 F.3d 1163, 1176 \n(11th Cir. 2000) (en banc).  “In considering these four prerequisites, \n[courts] must remember that a preliminary injunction is an extraor-\ndinary and drastic remedy which should not be granted unless the \nmovant clearly carries the burden of persuasion” as to these four \nprerequisites.  Canal Auth. v. Callaway, 489 F.2d 567, 573 (5th Cir. \n1974); accord Siegel, 234 F.3d at 1176.9 \nAs previewed, the district court determined that these four \nprerequisites are met with respect to section 4(a)(1)–(3) and thus \nenjoined Alabama from enforcing that part of the Act.  The district \ncourt dedicated the bulk of its analysis in the preliminary injunction \norder to the first prerequisite and ultimately found that Plaintiffs \nhad established a substantial likelihood of success as to their sub-\nstantive due process claim and equal protection claim.  Because the \nparties’ arguments on appeal similarly focus on the likelihood-of-\nsuccess prerequisite, we do the same.  We begin with the substan-\ntive due process claim and then turn to the equal protection claim. \nA. Substantive Due Process \n \n9 In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), \nthis Court adopted as precedent the decisions of the former Fifth Circuit ren-\ndered prior to October 1, 1981. \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 6: 72 5o fo 1f 0519  \n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  25 \n  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment pro-\nvides that no state shall “deprive any person of life, liberty, or prop-\nerty, without due process of law.”  U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1.  \nThe Supreme Court has held that this language guarantees both \nprocedural and substantive rights.  Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health \nOrg., 142 S. Ct. 2228, 2246 (2022).  Those substantive rights include \na  “great  majority”  of  the  rights  guaranteed  by  the  first  eight \nAmendments vis-à-vis the federal government, as well as “a select \nlist of fundamental rights that are not mentioned anywhere in the \nConstitution.”  Id.; see also McDonald v. City of Chicago, 561 U.S. 742, \n760–66 (2010) (reviewing the history of the Supreme Court’s incor-\nporation of “almost all of the provisions of the Bill of Rights” \nagainst the States). \nTo determine whether a right at issue is one of the substan-\ntive rights guaranteed by the Due Process Clause, courts must look \nto whether the right is “deeply rooted in [our] history and tradi-\ntion” and “essential to our Nation’s ‘scheme of ordered liberty.’”  \nDobbs, 142 S. Ct. at 2246 (alteration in original) (quoting Timbs v. \nIndiana, 139 S. Ct. 682, 687 (2019)).  The outcome of this analysis \ndetermines the amount of leeway that states have to enact laws \nthat infringe upon the right at issue.  “Laws that burden the exer-\ncise of a fundamental right require strict scrutiny and are sustained \nonly if narrowly tailored to further a compelling government inter-\nest.”  Lofton v. Sec’y of Dep’t of Child. & Fam. Servs., 358 F.3d 804, 815 \n(11th Cir. 2004).  Conversely, laws that do not burden the exercise \nof a fundamental right (and do not discriminate against a suspect \nclass under the Equal Protection Clause) are subject to rational \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 6: 82 6o fo 1f 0519  \n26  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nbasis review and need only “be rationally related to a legitimate \ngovernmental interest.”  Jones v. Governor of Florida, 950 F.3d 795, \n809 (11th Cir. 2020).  Although not “toothless,” rational basis re-\nview is “highly deferential to government action.”  Id. (quoting \nSchweiker v. Wilson, 450 U.S. 221, 234 (1981)). \nIn other words, every time a court recognizes an asserted \nright as a fundamental right protected by the Constitution, the \ncourt, “to a great extent, place[s] the matter outside the arena of \npublic debate and legislative action.” Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 \nU.S. 702, 720 (1997).  For that reason, the Supreme Court has in-\nstructed courts addressing substantive due process claims to “en-\ngage[] in a careful analysis of the history of the right at issue” and \nbe “‘reluctant’ to recognize rights that are not mentioned in the \nConstitution.”  Dobbs, 142 S. Ct. at 2246–47 (quoting Collins v. \nHarker Heights, 503 U.S. 115, 125 (1992)). \n  In this case, the district court determined that the “right to \ntreat  [one’s]  children  with  transitioning  medications  subject  to \nmedically accepted standards” is one of the substantive rights guar-\nanteed by the Due Process Clause and that, therefore, section \n4(a)(1)–(3) is subject to strict scrutiny.  But the use of these medica-\ntions in general—let alone for children—almost certainly is not \n“deeply rooted” in our nation’s history and tradition.

Laurence  Michael  Dillon,  formerly \nknown as Laura Maud Dillon, began receiving testosterone treatment for pur-\nposes of treating the discordance between biological sex and sense of gender \nidentity in 1939 and is thought by some to be the first biological female to \nreceive such treatment.

United States, 871 F.3d 1260, 1269–70 (11th Cir. 2017) \n(rejecting the notion that the Constitution protects a right to pro-\ncreate via in vitro fertilization procedures based on the fact that \nsuch procedures are “decidedly modern phenomena” that did not \ncome about until 1978). \nRather than perform any historical inquiry specifically tied \nto the particular alleged right at issue, the order on appeal instead \nsurmises that the “right to treat [one’s] children with transitioning \nmedications subject to medically accepted standards” falls under \nthe broader, recognized fundamental right to “make decisions con-\ncerning the care, custody, and control of [one’s] children.” E.g., \nTroxel v.

Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 \n(1923).  There, the Supreme Court held that a Nebraska law re-\nstricting the teaching of foreign languages violated the Due Process \nClause.  Id. at 400–03.  In doing so, the Court recognized that the \n“liberty” guaranteed by the Due Process Clause includes the right \n“to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire \nuseful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring up children, . . . \nand generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized at common \nlaw as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness of free men.”  \nId. at 399 (emphasis added). \nThe Supreme Court elaborated on the fundamental liberty \nof parents two years later in Pierce v. Society of the Sisters of the Holy \nNames of Jesus & Mary, 268 U.S. 510 (1925).  That case addressed \nOregon’s Compulsory Education Act of 1922, which mandated \nthat parents send their school-aged children to public school (as op-\nposed to private school).  Id. at 530–31.  Citing its decision in Meyer, \nthe Court concluded that the Oregon law violated the Due Process \nClause on the basis that it “unreasonably interferes with the liberty \nof parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of chil-\ndren under their control.”  Id. at 534–35 (emphasis added). \nMeyer and Pierce ushered in a line of Supreme Court deci-\nsions that recognized, and further defined the contours of, parents’ \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 7: 23 0o fo 1f 0519  \n30  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nliberty interest to control the upbringing of their children.14  The \nmajority of those cases, however, pertain to issues of education, \nreligion, or custody.

Thus, the question at issue was whether \nthe minors had a procedural due process right to greater procedural \nsafeguards, e.g., a judicial hearing, before their parents could com-\nmit them.  Id. at 610.  The Supreme Court concluded that “some \nkind of inquiry should be made by a ‘neutral factfinder’ to deter-\nmine whether the statutory requirements for admission are satis-\nfied,” but that the inquiry could be “informal,” e.g., conducted by \na staff physician, and did not require an adversarial proceeding with \na judicial or administrative officer.  Id. at 606–10.  “[R]equiring a \nformalized, factfinding hearing,” according to the Supreme Court, \nwould “[p]it[] the parents and the child” against each other and rep-\nresent a “significant intrusion into the parent-child relationship.”  \nId. at 610; see also id. (“It is one thing to require a neutral physician \nto make a careful review of the parents’ decision in order to make \nsure it is proper from a medical standpoint; it is a wholly different \nmatter to employ an adversary contest to ascertain whether the \nparents’ motivation is consistent with the child’s interests.”).  In so \nruling, the Supreme Court recognized, as a general matter, that \n“[m]ost children, even in adolescence, simply are not able to make \nsound judgments concerning many decisions, including their need \nfor medical care or treatment,” id. at 603, and that parents retain \n“plenary authority” as well as “a substantial, if not the dominant, \nrole” in deciding to pursue lawfully available treatment, like insti-\ntutionalization, for their children, id. at 604; see also id. at 609 (con-\ncerning “treatment that is provided by the state”).

Id. at 466–67.  To the extent that Bendiberg supports the \nproposition that parents have a substantive due process right relating to the \nmedical treatment that their children receive, its reasoning is not equally ap-\nplicable to situations involving parents’ ability to affirmatively obtain certain \nmedical treatment for their children that the State prohibits. \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 7: 63 4o fo 1f 0519  \n34  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \naccepted standards.”  Instead, some of these cases recognize, at a \nhigh level of generality, that there is a fundamental right to make \ndecisions concerning the “upbringing” and “care, custody, and con-\ntrol” of one’s children.  See Pierce, 268 U.S. at 534–35; Troxel, 530 \nU.S. at 66.  And those decisions applying the fundamental parental \nright in the context of medical decision-making do not establish \nthat parents have a derivative fundamental right to obtain a partic-\nular medical treatment for their children as long as a critical mass \nof medical professionals approve.  Moreover, all of the cases deal-\ning with the fundamental parental right reflect the common thread \nthat states properly may limit the authority of parents where “it \nappears that parental decisions will jeopardize the health or safety \nof the child, or have a potential for significant social burdens.”  Wis-\nconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 233–34 (1972); see also Prince v. Massa-\nchusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 168–69 (1944); Parham, 442 U.S. at 604; Ben-\ndiburg, 909 F.2d at 470.  Against this backdrop, and without any his-\ntorical analysis specifically tied to the medications at issue, Plaintiffs \nhave not shown it to be likely that the Due Process Clause of the \nConstitution guarantees a fundamental “right to treat [one’s] chil-\ndren with transitioning medications subject to medically accepted \nstandards.”18  See L.W. v.

Ct. at 2284 (quoting Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. \n312, 319 (1993)).  “Under this deferential standard,” the question \nthat we ask “is simply whether the challenged legislation is ration-\nally related to a legitimate state interest.”  Lofton, 358 F.3d at 818.  \nSuch a relationship may merely “be based on rational speculation” \nand need not be supported “by evidence or empirical data.”  FCC v. \nBeach Commc’ns, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 315 (1993); accord Jones, 950 F.3d \nat 809 (“When we review a statute for rationality, generally we ask \nwhether there is any rational basis for the law, even if the govern-\nment's proffered explanation is irrational, and even if it fails to offer \nany explanation at all.”).   \nWe are highly doubtful that section 4(a)(1)–(3) would not \nsurvive the lenient standard that is rational basis review.  It is well \nestablished that states have a compelling interest in “safeguarding \nthe physical and psychological well-being of . . . minor[s].”  Otto v. \nCity of Boca Raton, 981 F.3d 854, 868 (11th Cir. 2020) (quoting New \nYork v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 756–57 (1982)).  In the same vein, states \nhave  a  compelling  interest  in  protecting  children  from  drugs, \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 7: 83 6o fo 1f 0519  \n36  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nparticularly those for which there is uncertainty regarding benefits, \nrecent surges in use, and irreversible effects.19  Although rational \nspeculation is itself sufficient to survive rational basis review, here \nAlabama relies on both record evidence and rational speculation to \nestablish that section 4(a)(1)–(3) is rationally related to that compel-\nling state interest.  First, the record evidence is undisputed that the \nmedications at issue present some risks.  As the district court recog-\nnized, these medications can cause “loss of fertility and sexual func-\ntion.”  The district court also acknowledged testimony that “sev-\neral European countries have restricted treating minors with tran-\nsitioning medications due to growing concern about the medica-\ntions’ risks.”  Second, there is at least rational speculation that some \nfamilies will not fully appreciate those risks and that some minors \nexperiencing gender dysphoria ultimately will desist and identify \nwith their biological sex.  Section 4(a)(1)–(3) addresses these risks \nby  prohibiting  the  prescription  and  administration  of  puberty \nblockers and cross-sex hormone treatment to a patient under the \nage of nineteen for purposes of treating discordance between bio-\nlogical sex and sense of gender identity so that children will have \nmore time to develop their identities and to consider all of the \n \n19 As Alabama suggests, the opioid epidemic has shown firsthand the need to \nbe skeptical and exercise caution when there is a sudden uptick in prescriptions \nof powerful, off-label medications, even when some medical and pharmaceu-\ntical organizations defend their safety.  See also Skrmetti, 73 F.4th at 418 (“[I]t is \ndifficult to maintain that the medical community is of one mind about the use \nof hormone therapy for gender dysphoria when the FDA is not prepared to \nput its credibility and careful testing protocols behind the use.”). \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 7: 93 7o fo 1f 0519  \n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  37 \npotential consequences before moving forward with such treat-\nments.  That connection would be sufficient under rational basis \nreview. \nIn sum, Plaintiffs’ assertion that the Constitution protects \nthe right to treat one’s children with puberty blockers and cross-\nsex hormone therapy is precisely the sort of claim that asks courts \nto “break new ground in [the] field [of Substantive Due Process]” \nand therefore ought to elicit the “utmost care” from the judiciary.  \nSee Collins, 503 U.S. at 125.  The district court held that there is a \nspecific right under the Constitution “to treat [one’s] children with \ntransitioning medications subject to medically accepted standards,” \nbut did so without performing any analysis of whether that specific \nright is deeply rooted in our nation’s history and tradition.  Instead, \nthe district court grounded its ruling in an unprecedented interpre-\ntation of parents’ fundamental right to make decisions concerning \nthe “upbringing” and “care, custody, and control” of one’s chil-\ndren.  See Pierce, 268 U.S. at 534–35; Troxel, 530 U.S. at 66.  That was \nerror.  Neither the record nor any binding authority establishes that \nthe “right to treat [one’s] children with transitioning medications \nsubject to medically accepted standards” is a fundamental right \nprotected by the Constitution.  And, assuming it is not, then section \n4(a)(1)–(3) is subject only to rational basis review—a lenient stand-\nard that the law seems to undoubtedly clear.  Because the district \ncourt erroneously reviewed section 4(a)(1)–(3) with heightened \nscrutiny, its determination regarding the Parent Plaintiffs’ likeli-\nhood of success does not justify the preliminary injunction. \nB.

XIV, § 1.  The Equal Protection \nClause is “essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated \nshould be treated alike,” City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 \nU.S. 432, 439 (1985), and “simply keeps governmental decisionmak-\ners from treating differently persons who are in all relevant respects \nalike,” Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1, 10 (1992). \n“In considering whether state legislation violates the Equal \nProtection Clause . . . we apply different levels of scrutiny to differ-\nent types of classifications.”  Clark v. Jeter, 486 U.S. 456, 461 (1988).  \nAll statutory classifications must, at a minimum, satisfy rational ba-\nsis review.  Id.  Classifications based on race or national origin, \nhowever, are reviewed under the “most exacting” level of scrutiny: \nstrict scrutiny.  Id.  Between rational basis review and strict scrutiny \nlies “a level of intermediate scrutiny,” which applies to classifica-\ntions based on sex or illegitimacy.  Id. \nThus, a government policy that distinguishes on the basis of \nsex is permissible under the Equal Protection Clause “only if it sat-\nisfies intermediate scrutiny.”  Adams ex rel. Kasper v. Sch. Bd. of St. \nJohns Cnty., 57 F.4th 791, 801 (11th Cir. 2022).  Under that standard, \nthe party seeking to uphold the policy carries the burden of “show-\ning that the [sex-based] classification serves ‘important governmen-\ntal objectives and that the discriminatory means employed’ are \n‘substantially  related  to  the  achievement  of  those  objectives.’”  \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 8: 13 9o fo 1f 0519  \n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  39 \nMiss.

Co., 446 U.S. 142, 150 (1980)). \n“For a government objective to be important, it cannot ‘rely \non overbroad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, \nor preferences of males and females.’”  Adams, 57 F.4th at 801 (quot-\ning United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996)).  And for a \npolicy’s means to be substantially related to a government objec-\ntive, there must be “enough of a fit” between the means and the \nasserted justification.  Id. (quoting Danskine v. Mia. Dade Fire Dep’t, \n253 F.3d 1288, 1299 (11th Cir. 2001)).  However, “the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause does not demand a perfect fit between means and ends \nwhen it comes to sex.”  Id.; see also Nguyen v. INS, 533 U.S. 53, 70 \n(2001) (“None of our gender-based classification equal protection \ncases have required that the [policy] under consideration must be \ncapable of achieving its ultimate objective in every instance.”). \nIn this case, the district court first held that section 4(a)(1)–\n(3) of the Act classifies on the basis of gender nonconformity and \ntherefore classifies on the basis of sex.  In determining that section \n4(a)(1)–(3) classifies on the basis of gender nonconformity, the dis-\ntrict court reasoned that section 4(a)(1)–(3) “prohibits transgender \nminors—and only transgender minors—from taking transitioning \nmedications due to their gender nonconformity.”  And, in holding \nthat a classification on the basis of gender nonconformity neces-\nsarily constitutes a classification on the basis of sex, the district \ncourt cited the reasoning of Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. \n1731 (2020), and Glenn v. Brumby, 663 F.3d 1312 (11th Cir. 2011).   \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 8: 24 0o fo 1f 0519  \n40  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nAfter  determining  that  section  4(a)(1)–(3)  of  the  Act \namounts to a sex-based classification subject to intermediate scru-\ntiny, the district court then found that Alabama had not offered any \nexceedingly persuasive justification for the classification and thus \nconcluded that that the Minor Plaintiffs are substantially likely to \nsucceed on their equal protection claim.   \nOn appeal, Alabama maintains that section 4(a)(1)–(3) classi-\nfies on the bases of age and procedure, not sex or gender noncon-\nformity, and is therefore not subject to any heightened scrutiny \nabove rational basis review.  See Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, \n470 (1991) (“[A]ge is not a suspect classification under the Equal \nProtection Clause.”); Clark, 486 U.S. at 461 (listing suspect classifi-\ncations and making no reference to classifications based on proce-\ndures).  Alabama further argues that section 4(a)(1)–(3) would sur-\nvive at any level of scrutiny because it “serves the compelling \n[state] interest of protecting children from unproven, life-altering \nmedical interventions” and because “no other approach would of-\nfer children in Alabama adequate protection.”   \nIn response, the Minor Plaintiffs argue that section 4(a)(1)–\n(3) classifies on the basis of sex both directly, by using sex-based \nterms, and indirectly, by classifying on the basis of gender noncon-\nformity, and that the district court therefore properly applied inter-\nmediate scrutiny.  The Minor Plaintiffs also argue that, even if the \nmore lenient rational basis standard applies, section 4(a)(1)–(3) does \nnot pass muster.  For its part, the United States makes the argument \nthat section 4(a)(1)–(3) “triggers heightened scrutiny” because it \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 8: 34 1o fo 1f 0519  \n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  41 \n”discriminates against transgender persons, who constitute at least \na quasi-suspect class” by themselves, distinct from sex.   \nHaving carefully considered all of these positions, we agree \nwith Alabama that section 4(a)(1)–(3) is best understood as a law \nthat targets specific medical interventions for minors, not one that \nclassifies on the basis of any suspect characteristic under the Equal \nProtection Clause.  Section 4(a)(1)–(3) is therefore subject only to \nrational basis review—a standard that it almost undoubtedly satis-\nfies  for  the  reasons  discussed.    See supra  Section  III.A;  see also \nSkrmetti, 73 F.4th at 419 (finding it “highly unlikely” that the plain-\ntiffs could show that Tennessee’s substantially similar law “lacks a \nrational basis”).  Because the district court erroneously departed \nfrom that standard, its assessment regarding the Minor Plaintiffs’ \nlikelihood of success as to their equal protection claim cannot sup-\nport the preliminary injunction.  We reason as follows. \nTo  begin,  we  reject  the  view  that  section  4(a)(1)–(3) \namounts to a sex-based classification subject to intermediate scru-\ntiny.  As mentioned, one of the Minor Plaintiffs’ arguments is that \nsection 4(a)(1)–(3) directly classifies on the basis of sex because it \n“uses explicitly sex-based terms to criminalize certain treatments \nbased on a minor’s ‘sex.’”  Of course, section 4(a)(1)–(3) discusses \nsex insofar as it generally addresses treatment for discordance be-\ntween biological sex and gender identity, and insofar as it identifies \nthe applicable cross-sex hormone(s) for each sex—estrogen for \nmales and testosterone and other androgens for females.  We \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 8: 44 2o fo 1f 0519  \n42  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nnonetheless believe the statute does not discriminate based on sex \nfor two reasons. \nFirst, the statute does not establish an unequal regime for \nmales and females.  In the Supreme Court’s leading precedent on \ngender-based intermediate scrutiny under the Equal Protection \nClause, the Court held that heightened scrutiny applies to “official \naction that closes a door or denies opportunity to women (or to \nmen).”  Virginia, 518 U.S. at 532.  Alabama’s law does not distin-\nguish between men and women in such a way.  Cf. Adams, 57 F.4th \nat 800–11.  Instead, section 4(a)(1)–(3) establishes a rule that applies \nequally to both sexes: it restricts the prescription and administra-\ntion of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormone treatment for pur-\nposes of treating discordance between biological sex and sense of \ngender identity for all minors.  See Skrmetti, 73 F.4th at 419 (explain-\ning that this sort of restriction on puberty blockers and cross-sex \nhormone treatment “does not prefer one sex to the detriment of \nthe other”).   \nSecond, the statute refers to sex only because the medical \nprocedures that it regulates—puberty blockers and cross-sex hor-\nmones as a treatment for gender dysphoria—are themselves sex-\nbased.  The Act regulates medical interventions to treat an incon-\ngruence between one’s biological sex and one’s perception of one’s \nsex.  The cross-sex hormone treatments for gender dysphoria are \ndifferent for males and for females because of biological differences \nbetween males and females—females are given testosterone and \nmales are given estrogen.  With regards to puberty blockers, those \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 8: 54 3o fo 1f 0519  \n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  43 \nmedications inhibit and suppress the production of testosterone in \nmales and estrogen in females.  For that reason, it is difficult to im-\nagine how a state might regulate the use of puberty blockers and \ncross-sex hormones for the relevant purposes in specific terms with-\nout referencing sex in some way.  Thus, we do not find the direct \nsex-classification argument to be persuasive. \nThe Minor Plaintiffs’ other sex-based argument is that sec-\ntion 4(a)(1)–(3) indirectly classifies on the basis of sex by classifying \non the basis of gender nonconformity.  This is the position that the \ndistrict court adopted, citing Bostock and Brumby.  Neither of those \ncases, however, dealt with the Equal Protection Clause as applied \nto laws regulating medical treatments.   \nBostock dealt with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \n§ 701 et seq., as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., in the context of \nemployment discrimination.  See 140 S. Ct. at 1737–41, 1754 (hold-\ning that “[a]n employer who fires an individual merely for being \ngay or transgender defies [Title VII]”).  After noting that “only the \nwords on the page constitute the law adopted by Congress and ap-\nproved by the President,” id. at 1738, the Court in Bostock relied \nexclusively on the specific text of Title VII.  The Court “pro-\nceed[ed] on the assumption that ‘sex’ . . . refer[s] only to biological \ndistinctions between male and female.” Id. at 1739.  But the Court \nreasoned that the combined ordinary meaning of the words “be-\ncause of,” id., “otherwise . . . discriminate against,” id. at 1740, and \n“individual,” id., led to the conclusion that Title VII makes “[a]n \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 8: 64 4o fo 1f 0519  \n44  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nindividual's homosexuality or transgender status . . . not relevant \nto employment decisions,” id. at 1741.  \nThe Equal Protection Clause contains none of the text that \nthe Court interpreted in Bostock.  It provides simply that “[n]o State \nshall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protec-\ntion of the laws.”  U.S. Const. amend XIV.  Because Bostock there-\nfore concerned a different law (with materially different language) \nand a different factual context, it bears minimal relevance to the \ninstant case.  See Skrmetti, 73 F.4th at 420 (finding that the reasoning \nof Bostock “applies only to Title VII”); see also Brandt ex rel. Brandt v. \nRutledge, No. 21-2875, 2022 WL 16957734, at *1 n.1 (8th Cir. Nov. \n16, 2022) (Stras, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (ex-\npressing skepticism that Bostock’s reasoning applies to the Equal \nProtection  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  because  the \nFourteenth Amendment “predates Title VII by nearly a century” \nand contains language that is “not similar in any way” to Title \nVII’s); see Students for Fair Admissions, Inc., v. President & Fellows of \nHarvard Coll., 143 S. Ct. 2141, 2220 (2023) (Gorsuch, J., concurring) \n(noting the different language in Title VI and the Equal Protection \nClause and explaining “[t]hat such differently worded provisions \nshould mean the same thing is implausible on its face.”) \nBrumby, on the other hand, did deal with the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause; but, like Bostock, Brumby concerned gender stereotyp-\ning in the context of employment discrimination.  See 663 F.3d at \n1313–20 (holding that “a government agent violates the Equal Pro-\ntection Clause’s prohibition of sex-based discrimination when he \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 8: 74 5o fo 1f 0519  \n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  45 \nor she fires a transgender or transsexual employee because of his or \nher gender non-conformity”).  So, while Brumby did involve the \nsame law at issue here—the Equal Protection Clause—it discussed \nthat law as applied to a particular factual scenario, i.e., one where \nan employer fired an employee for failing to adhere to certain ex-\npectations and stereotypes associated with the employee’s sex.  \nThat is not the scenario presented here.  Section 4(a)(1)–(3) targets \ncertain medical interventions for minors meant to treat the condi-\ntion of gender dysphoria; it does not further any particular gender \nstereotype.  Insofar as section 4(a)(1)–(3) involves sex, it simply re-\nflects biological differences between males and females, not stere-\notypes associated with either sex. \nTo be sure, section 4(a)(1)–(3) restricts a specific course of \nmedical treatment that, by the nature of things, only gender non-\nconforming individuals may receive.  But just last year, the Su-\npreme Court explained that “[t]he regulation of a medical proce-\ndure that only one sex can undergo does not trigger heightened \nconstitutional scrutiny unless the regulation is a ‘mere pretex[t] de-\nsigned to effect an invidious discrimination against members of one \nsex or the other.’”  Dobbs, 142 S. Ct. at 2245–46 (alteration in origi-\nnal) (quoting Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 U.S. 484, 496 n.20 (1974)); see \nalso id. at 2246 (recognizing that “the ‘goal of preventing abortion’ \ndoes  not  constitute  ‘invidiously  discriminatory  animus’  against \nwomen” (quoting Bray v. Alexandria Women’s Health Clinic, 506 U.S. \n263, 273–74 (1993))).  By the same token, the regulation of a course \nof treatment that only gender nonconforming individuals can un-\ndergo would not trigger heightened scrutiny unless the regulation \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 8: 84 6o fo 1f 0519  \n46  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nwere a pretext for invidious discrimination against such individu-\nals.  And the district court did not find that Alabama’s law was \nbased on invidious discrimination.  \nWe  similarly  reject  the  United  States’  view  that  section \n4(a)(1)–(3) is subject to heightened scrutiny because it classiﬁes on \nthe basis of transgender status, separate from sex.  As we recently \nexplained, “we have grave ‘doubt’ that transgender persons consti-\ntute a quasi-suspect class,” distinct from sex, under the Equal Pro-\ntection Clause.  Adams, 57 F.4th at 803 n.5.  Even if they did, for the \nreasons discussed with respect to gender nonconformity, section \n4(a)(1)–(3)’s relationship to transgender status would not trigger \nheightened scrutiny.  Chieﬂy, the regulation of a course of treat-\nment that, by the nature of things, only transgender individuals \nwould want to undergo would not trigger heightened scrutiny un-\nless the regulation is a pretext for invidious discrimination against \nsuch individuals, and, here, the district court made no ﬁndings of \nsuch a pretext.  For these reasons, we conclude that section 4(a)(1)–\n(3)’s relationship to transgender status does not warrant height-\nened scrutiny. \nApart from sex, gender nonconformity, and transgender sta-\ntus, the Minor Plaintiﬀs and the United States do not claim any \nother  suspect  classiﬁcation.    All  the  parties  agree  that  section \n4(a)(1)–(3) draws distinctions on the basis of age.  However, “age is \nnot a suspect classiﬁcation under the Equal Protection Clause.”  \nKimel v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, 83 (2000).  As a result, \n“[s]tates may discriminate on the basis of age without oﬀending the \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 8: 94 7o fo 1f 0519  \n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  47 \nFourteenth Amendment if the age classiﬁcation in question is ra-\ntionally related to a legitimate state interest.”  Id.  And “[t]he ra-\ntionality commanded by the Equal Protection Clause does not re-\nquire States to match age distinctions and the legitimate interests \nthey serve with razorlike precision.”  Id.   \nHere, it seems abundantly clear that section 4(a)(1)–(3) clas-\nsiﬁes on the basis of age in a way that is rationally related to a le-\ngitimate state interest.  As discussed, Alabama has a legitimate in-\nterest in “safeguarding the physical and psychological well-being of \n. . . minor[s],” and notably that interest itself distinguishes minors \nfrom adults.  Otto, 981 F.3d at 868 (quoting Ferber, 458 U.S. at 756–\n57); see supra Section III.A.  Section 4(a)(1)–(3) furthers that interest \nby restricting the prescription and administration of puberty block-\ners and cross-sex hormone treatment to minors for purposes of \ntreating discordance between biological sex and sense of gender \nidentity based on the rational understanding that many minors \nmay not be ﬁnished forming their identities and may not fully ap-\npreciate the associated risks.  Moreover, Alabama’s decision to draw \nthe line at the age of nineteen suﬃciently approximates the divide \nbetween individuals who warrant government protection and indi-\nviduals who are better able to make decisions for themselves; it is \nneither too over- nor under-inclusive.  For these reasons, it is ex-\nceedingly likely that section 4(a)(1)–(3) satisﬁes rational basis re-\nview as a classiﬁcation on the basis of age. \nSection 4(a)(1)–(3) is therefore subject only to rational basis \nreview—a standard that it is exceedingly likely to satisfy for the \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 9: 04 8o fo 1f 0519  \n48  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nreasons discussed.  See supra Section III.A.  The district court erred \nas a matter of law by applying heightened scrutiny, and that error \ntainted its assessment of Plaintiﬀs’ likelihood of success.  Because \nthat is true with respect to both the due process claim and the equal \nprotection claim, we vacate the preliminary injunction. \n* * * * \n  This case revolves around an issue that is surely of the ut-\nmost importance to all of the parties involved: the safety and well-\nbeing of the children of Alabama.  But it is complicated by the fact \nthat there is a strong disagreement between the parties over what \nis best for those children.  Absent a constitutional mandate to the \ncontrary, these types of issues are quintessentially the sort that our \nsystem of government reserves to legislative, not judicial, action.  \nFaced with this difficult and delicate set of circumstances, \nthe district court granted the “extraordinary and drastic remedy” \nthat is a preliminary injunction and enjoined Alabama from enforc-\ning part of the law in dispute.  See Callaway, 489 F.2d at 573.  In \ndoing so, the district court determined that section 4(a)(1)–(3) of \nthe Act is subject to heightened scrutiny on due process and equal \nprotection grounds and therefore the parties challenging the law \nhad a substantial likelihood of success on the merits as to those \nclaims.  That was erroneous.  With respect to the Parent Plaintiffs’ \nsubstantive due process claim, the district court divined, without \nadequate historical support, that the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment protects the right to “treat [one’s] children \nwith  transitioning  medications  subject  to  medically  accepted \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 9: 14 9o fo 1f 0519  \n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  49 \nstandards.”  And with respect to the Minor Plaintiffs’ equal protec-\ntion claim, the district court determined that the law classifies on \nthe basis of sex, when in reality the law simply reflects real, biolog-\nical differences between males and females and equally restricts the \nuse of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormone treatment for mi-\nnors of both sexes.  Because the district court reviewed the law un-\nder the wrong standard of scrutiny in connection with both claims, \nthe issuance of the preliminary injunction constituted an abuse of \ndiscretion.  See Curling v. Raffensperger, 50 F.4th 1114, 1121 (11th Cir. \n2022) (“[A] court abuses its discretion in granting a preliminary in-\njunction if, in determining whether success is likely, it incorrectly \nor unreasonably applies the law.”). \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, we vacate the district court’s preliminary \ninjunction on the enforcement of section 4(a)(1)–(3) of the Act. \n  VACATED. \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 9: 25 0o fo 1f 0519  \n22-11707   BRASHER, J., Concurring  1 \nBRASHER, Circuit Judge, concurring: \nI concur in the Court’s opinion. I write separately to focus \non the plaintiﬀs’ equal protection claim.  \nThe resolution of an equal protection claim often turns on \nthe level of scrutiny that we apply—rational basis, intermediate, or \nstrict. The plaintiﬀs argue that the statute classiﬁes based on sex, \nwhich warrants intermediate scrutiny. The Court rejects that argu-\nment, and, after much deliberation and research, I agree. Ala-\nbama’s statute does not treat one sex diﬀerently than the other. It \ndoes not use sex as a proxy for some more germane classiﬁcation. \nAnd it is not based on a sex stereotype. Instead, I think the law is \nbest read to classify—not based on sex—but as between minors \nwho want puberty blockers and hormones to treat “a discordance \nbetween [their] sex and sense of gender identity,” Ala. Code § 26-\n26-2(2), and those minors who want these drugs to treat a diﬀerent \ncondition.  \nBut even if the statute did discriminate based on sex, I think \nit is likely to satisfy intermediate scrutiny. If Alabama’s statute in-\nvolves a sex-based classiﬁcation that triggers heightened scrutiny, it \ndoes so because it is otherwise impossible to regulate these drugs \ndiﬀerently when they are prescribed as a treatment for gender dys-\nphoria than when they are prescribed for other purposes. As long \nas the state has a substantial justiﬁcation for regulating diﬀerently \nthe use of puberty blockers and hormones for diﬀerent purposes, \nthen I think this law satisﬁes intermediate scrutiny. \n \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 9: 35 1o fo 1f 0519  \n2  BRASHER, J., Concurring  22-11707 \nI.   \nI’ll start with the level of scrutiny that applies to this law. We \nshould be cautious when we are asked to extend heightened scru-\ntiny to novel facts like these. As Justice Stevens explained in one of \nthe Court’s leading cases on sex discrimination, the text of the \nEqual Protection Clause does not subject state laws to diﬀerent lev-\nels of judicial scrutiny. See Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 211–12 (1976) \n(Stevens, J., concurring). The Clause “requires every State to gov-\nern impartially,” and it “does not direct the courts to apply one \nstandard of review in some cases and a diﬀerent standard in other \ncases.” Id.; see also United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 570 (1996) \n(Scalia, J., dissenting) (calling tiers of scrutiny “made-up tests”); \nWhole  Woman’s  Health  v.  Hellerstedt,  579  U.S.  582,  638  (2016) \n(Thomas,  J.,  dissenting)  (calling  tiers  of  scrutiny  “increasingly \nmeaningless  . . .  formalism”).  Moreover,  some  of  the  Supreme \nCourt’s most recent (and signiﬁcant) equal protection precedents \ndon’t apply the tiers of scrutiny. E.g., Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. \n644, 672–76 (2015). \nNonetheless, the Supreme Court has established the tiers of \nscrutiny, and lower courts must apply that doctrine the best we can.  \nIn doing so, I think we must appreciate that the tiers of scrutiny are \n“no more scientiﬁc than their names suggest.” Virginia, 518 U.S. at \n567 (Scalia, J., dissenting). They should be “guidelines informing \nour approach to the case at hand, not tests to be mechanically ap-\nplied.” Williams-Yulee v. Fla. Bar, 575 U.S. 433, 457 (2015) (Breyer, J., \nconcurring). To that end, when we are asked to apply heightened \n \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 9: 45 2o fo 1f 0519  \n22-11707   BRASHER, J., Concurring  3 \nscrutiny on novel facts, we need to ensure that the purposes of the \ndoctrine warrant that approach.  \nIn my view, many judges have mechanically applied inter-\nmediate scrutiny to laws like Alabama’s without considering the \nreasons we subject sex classiﬁcations to heightened scrutiny. Con-\nsider the Eighth Circuit’s decision in Brandt by & through Brandt v. \nRutledge, 47 F.4th 661 (8th Cir. 2022). There, the court concluded \nthat Arkansas’s comparable law discriminates based on sex be-\ncause, referring to cross-sex hormones, it said that “medical proce-\ndures that are permitted for a minor of one sex are prohibited for \na minor of another sex.” Id. at 669. But the court ignored the law’s \nban on puberty blockers, which applies the same way to both sexes. \nAnd, more fundamentally, the court did not explain how applying \nheightened scrutiny to a law that regulates sex-speciﬁc medical in-\nterventions is consistent with the reasons the Supreme Court cre-\nated that standard. \nTurning back to this case, Alabama’s law is replete with sex-\nrelated language. But, even though the statute uses sex-related lan-\nguage, I think it is wrong to say that the statute classiﬁes based on \nsex. The law regulates drugs that “treat a discordance between [an] \nindividual’s sex and sense of gender identity.” Ala. Code § 26-26-\n2(2). The law deﬁnes “sex” as “[t]he biological state of being male \nor female, based on the individual’s sex organs, chromosomes, and \nendogenous hormone proﬁles.” Id. § 26-26-2(3). Then the law pro-\nhibits various treatments “for the purpose of attempting to alter \nthe appearance of or aﬃrm the minor’s perception of his or her \n \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 9: 55 3o fo 1f 0519  \n4  BRASHER, J., Concurring  22-11707 \ngender or sex, if that appearance or perception is inconsistent with \nthe minor’s sex as deﬁned in this act.” Id. § 26-26-4(a). \nI see the word “sex” in this law. But I don’t see a sex classiﬁ-\ncation—at least, not as the idea of a sex classiﬁcation appears in our \nequal-protection caselaw. Instead, it seems to me that this sex-re-\nlated language classiﬁes between, on the one hand, those minors \nwho want these drugs to treat “a discordance between [their] sex \nand sense of gender identity” and, on the other hand, those minors \nwho want these drugs to treat a diﬀerent condition. The Equal Pro-\ntection Clause “is essentially a direction that all persons similarly \nsituated should be treated alike.” City of Cleburne, Tex. v. Cleburne \nLiving Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985). So the right question under the \nEqual Protection Clause is whether these two groups—those who \nwant to use these drugs to treat a discordance between their sex \nand gender identity and those who want to use these drugs to treat \nother conditions—are similarly situated.  \nThat question isn’t one that seems suited to heightened scru-\ntiny. The Equal Protection Clause prohibits “giv[ing] a mandatory \npreference to members of either sex over members of the other.” \nReed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71, 76 (1971). We apply heightened scrutiny to \nsex classiﬁcations because of an intuition that, “[r]ather than rest-\ning on meaningful considerations, statutes distributing beneﬁts and \nburdens between the sexes in diﬀerent ways very likely reﬂect out-\nmoded notions of the relative capabilities of men and women.” \nCity of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 441. When we apply heightened scru-\ntiny to a statute that classiﬁes based on sex, the point is to ascertain \n \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 9: 65 4o fo 1f 0519  \n22-11707   BRASHER, J., Concurring  5 \nwhether the classiﬁcation is based on “traditional, often inaccurate, \nassumptions about the proper roles of men and women.” Miss. \nUniv. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 725–26 (1982). We are also \nseeking to ensure that sex is not being used as an “inaccurate proxy \nfor other, more germane bases of classiﬁcation.” Craig, 429 U.S. at \n198.  \nNone of these rationales apply to the line drawn in Ala-\nbama’s statute. It doesn’t distribute beneﬁts or burdens between \nmen and women or arguably use sex as a proxy for other interests. \nIt bans a course of treatment—puberty blockers and hormones—\nfor a particular condition that aﬀects both boys and girls. Another \nway to think about it: an injunction against the enforcement of Al-\nabama’s law under equal-protection principles will not equalize \nburdens or beneﬁts between girls and boys. It will not require the \ngovernment to treat boys and girls the same. It will merely force \nAlabama to either ban puberty blockers and hormones for all pur-\nposes or allow them for all purposes. \nFor its part, the district court applied heightened scrutiny on \nthe theory that Alabama’s statute discriminates based on a sex ste-\nreotype because it targets medical interventions for transgender \npeople, i.e., those who feel a “a discordance between [their] sex and \nsense of gender identity.” The district court cited Glenn v. Brumby, \n663 F.3d 1312, 1320 (11th Cir. 2011), for this proposition, but I think \nit misread that precedent.1 In Glenn, we concluded that a public \n \n1 I don’t fault the district court for reaching the conclusion that it did. The \ndistrict court did an admirable job with a difficult case on an expedited \n \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 9: 75 5o fo 1f 0519  \n6  BRASHER, J., Concurring  22-11707 \nemployer engaged in sex discrimination by ﬁring a transgender em-\nployee who was born a man because the employee began wearing \nstereotypical women’s clothing. Id. at 1314. The employer allowed \nbiological women to wear stereotypical women’s clothing, but not \nbiological men. We held that the employer had engaged in sex dis-\ncrimination under the Equal Protection Clause—not because it \nﬁred a transgender employee—but because it ﬁred an employee \n“on the basis of gender-based behavioral norms.” Id. at 1316–17. By \nruling against that practice under the circumstances of that case, \nwe required the employer to treat men and women equally, no mat-\nter their clothing choices.  \nUnlike the employer’s decision in Glenn, Alabama’s statute \ndoes not ﬁt the mold of a sex-based stereotype. The statute isn’t \nbased on a socially constructed generalization about the way men \nor women should behave. It does not reinforce an “assumption[] \nabout the proper roles of men and women” in our society. Hogan, \n458 U.S. at 725–26. And it doesn’t reﬂect society’s “notions of the \nrelative capabilities of men and women.” City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. \nat 441. To be sure, the statute’s classiﬁcation reﬂects the govern-\nment’s recognition that, without medical intervention, a healthy \nchild will mature in accord with his or her biological sex. But the \nrecognition of biological reality is “not a stereotype.” Nguyen v. INS, \n533 U.S. 53, 68 (2001). \n \ntimeframe. One of the benefits of the appellate process is that we have more \ntime and resources to assess a legal question, which sometimes yields a differ-\nent result. \n \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 9: 85 6o fo 1f 0519  \n22-11707   BRASHER, J., Concurring  7 \nThe district court—viewing this case through the lens of sex \nstereotyping—did not make any ﬁndings on whether the state was \njustiﬁed in treating people diﬀerently because they want these \ndrugs to treat a discordance between their sex and gender identity \ninstead of some other condition. But the state has identiﬁed many \nreasons for drawing that line. For example, the record reﬂects that \nother countries are regulating the drugs diﬀerently for these pur-\nposes, and the FDA has not approved them for this purpose alt-\nhough it has for others. I cannot say that those reasons fail the leni-\nent standard of rational basis review. See Jones v. Gov. of Fla., 975 F.3d \n1016, 1034–35 (11th Cir. 2020). \nII.   \nAlthough I believe rational basis scrutiny likely applies, I also \nthink that, even if Alabama’s statute triggered intermediate scru-\ntiny, it would likely survive that heightened scrutiny.  \nIntermediate scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause \ndoes not require us to ask whether a law is good or bad policy, but \nwhether a government has a good reason for using a sex-based clas-\nsiﬁcation in a law. The relevant question is whether “the classiﬁca-\ntion serves ‘important governmental objectives and that the discrim-\ninatory means employed’ are ‘substantially related to the achieve-\nment of those objectives.’” Hogan, 458 U.S. at 724 (quoting Wengler \nv. Druists Mutual Ins. Co., 446 U.S. 142, 150 (1980)) (emphasis \nadded). As I discuss above, the purpose of this heightened scrutiny \nis to ensure that laws based on sex classiﬁcations aren’t using those \nclassiﬁcations  because  of  “outmoded  notions  of  the  relative \n \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112259- 1       D  aDtaet eF iFleilde:d 0: 90/81/12/12/022032 3       P  aPgaeg:e 9: 95 7o fo 1f 0519  \n8  BRASHER, J., Concurring  22-11707 \ncapabilities of men and women.” City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 441. \nInstead, the use of sex must reﬂect that it is a “meaningful consid-\neration[]” on which the law is based. Id. And so, under intermediate \nscrutiny, the government’s burden is to establish “an ‘exceedingly \npersuasive justiﬁcation’ for the classiﬁcation.” Hogan, 458 U.S. at 724 \n(quoting Kirchberg v. Feenstra 450 U.S. 455, 461 (1981)) (emphasis \nadded).  \nAssuming the classiﬁcation in this law is subject to interme-\ndiate scrutiny, I believe the state probably has an “exceedingly per-\nsuasive justiﬁcation” for regulating these drugs diﬀerently when \nthey are used to treat a discordance between an individual’s sex and \nsense of gender identity than when they are used for other pur-\nposes. See Sessions v. Morales-Santana, 582 U.S. 47, 58 (2017) (quoting \nVirginia, 518 U.S. at 531). The record reﬂects that the use of puberty \nblockers and hormones for this purpose speciﬁcally carries poten-\ntially uncertain risks. The record also reﬂects that there is uncer-\ntainty about how to tell which patients need these interventions for \nthis purpose and which don’t. Although further fact ﬁnding in this \nlitigation  will  test  the  plausibility  of  those  concerns,  Alabama \ndoesn’t have to conclusively prove these things to have an im-\nportant governmental interest. Intermediate scrutiny permits “the \nlegislature [to] make a predictive judgment” based on competing \nevidence. Brown v. Entm’t Merchs. Ass’n, 564 U.S. 786, 799–800 (2011) \n(discussing relative burdens of intermediate and strict scrutiny). \nLikewise, I think the state’s interest is suﬃciently related to \nthe sex classiﬁcation in the law to the extent there is one. Assuming \n \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112295 - 1     D  a Dtea tFei lFedile: d0:9 0/181/2/210/22032  3     P  a Pgaeg: e1:0 508 o of f1 5091  \n22-11707   BRASHER, J., Concurring  9 \nthis statute involves a sex-based classiﬁcation, it does so because \nthere is no other way to regulate treatments for “a discordance be-\ntween [an] individual’s sex and sense of gender identity” without \ndrawing such a distinction. Alabama would have to use sex-based \nlanguage to regulate those treatments even if it wanted to subsidize \nthem instead of banning them. So, if intermediate scrutiny applied \nhere, the “suﬃciently related” question collapses into the state in-\nterest question: it is whether Alabama has an important govern-\nmental interest in regulating the use of puberty blockers and hor-\nmones for “a discordance between [an] individual’s sex and sense \nof gender identity” but not for other uses. Because the record re-\nﬂects that the state has that kind of interest, the statute’s classiﬁca-\ntion likely satisﬁes intermediate scrutiny.  \nThe plaintiﬀs argue, in part, that Alabama is not justiﬁed in \nbanning these treatments because there are less restrictive alterna-\ntives to a ban. But I don’t think that is how intermediate scrutiny \nworks under the Equal Protection Clause. Consider how the Su-\npreme Court applied intermediate scrutiny in Craig v. Boren, 429 \nU.S. 190 (1976). There, a state law prohibited sales of alcohol to \nmen between the ages of eighteen and twenty but not women in \nthat age range. Id. at 191–92. The Court accepted that the goal of \nthis law—“the enhancement of traﬃc safety”—is an important in-\nterest. Id. at 199–200. But it held that the government did not have \nsuﬃcient evidence that a “gender-based distinction closely serves \nto achieve that objective.” Id. at 200. The Court in Craig never asked \nwhether the state’s decision to ban under-21-year-old men from \ndrinking alcohol was justiﬁed as compared to some less restrictive, \n \n\nUUSSCCAA1111  CCaassee::  2222--1111770077          DDooccuummeenntt::  112295 - 1     D  a Dtea tFei lFedile: d0:9 0/181/2/210/22032  3     P  a Pgaeg: e1:0 519 o of f1 5091  \n10  BRASHER, J., Concurring  22-11707 \nbut equally sex-based, alternative—such as making men take addi-\ntional driving classes or the like. Instead, the Court assessed only \nwhether the sex-based classiﬁcation ﬁt closely enough to the pur-\nposes of the law. Likewise, here, I think we can resolve the plain-\ntiﬀs’ equal protection claim by assessing whether the state has an \ninterest in classifying based on sex without also asking whether, \neven if the state were allowed to classify based on sex, the state \ncould achieve its objective with some lesser restriction. \nIn short, assuming this law is subject to intermediate scru-\ntiny, I think it likely passes. On this record, it seems clear that the \nstate has an interest in regulating these drugs diﬀerently when they \nare prescribed to treat a discordance between sex and gender than \nwhen they are prescribed to treat other conditions. And the state \ncannot do that without drawing the lines it has drawn in this stat-\nute. \nIII.   \nWhether rational basis or intermediate scrutiny applies, I be-\nlieve this appeal comes out the same way: the state will likely pre-\nvail on the merits. Future ﬁndings of fact in the district court may \nestablish otherwise. But at this stage, the plaintiﬀs have not carried \ntheir burden entitling them to a preliminary injunction. I concur. \n \n \n ",

To support the dignity of transgender \npeople and prevent these injuries, amici States have adopted laws and \npolicies to combat discrimination against transgender people in healthcare, \nincluding policies that guarantee non-discriminatory insurance coverage of \ngender-affirming medical care for transgender minors.2  \n                                         \n1 Amici States submit this amicus brief pursuant to Federal \nRule of Appellate Procedure 29(a) and Eleventh Circuit Rule of \nPractice 29-2 in support of Plaintiffs-Appellees and affirmance of \nthe preliminary injunction. \n2 See, e.g., Colo.

The \namici States’ experience has proven that our laws and policies result in \nbetter health outcomes for our transgender residents and safeguard their \nphysical, emotional, and financial well-being. More generally, amici States \nhave a profound interest in the proper application of the Equal Protection \nClause to protect transgender individuals throughout our nation from \nunconstitutional discrimination, and to mitigate the injuries from such \ndiscrimination that transgender individuals have suffered for too long.  \nAmici States have a strong interest in advocating for the well-being of \nour residents, including teenagers receiving gender-affirming medical care, \nwho travel to, attend school in, or work in Alabama. If Alabama’s law is \nallowed to take effect, those teenagers in Alabama will face an untenable \nchoice:  risk severe criminal penalties for those who provide them with \n                                         \n(…continued) \nN.Y.

In \naddition to injuries directly inflicted on transgender teens, laws like \nAlabama’s impose costs on state programs that provide gender-affirming \ncare. Amici states’ experience has shown that the abrupt termination of \ngender-affirming healthcare can require state programs to compensate for \nthe disruption by providing different or additional treatments.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Alabama Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act (the \nAct) is an extreme law that harms, not protects, transgender youth.4 \nAlabama’s categorical ban on gender-affirming healthcare for transgender \nindividuals under the age of 19 ignores broad medical consensus, interferes \nwith medical decisions that providers reach with individual patients and their \nfamilies, and violates the Equal Protection Clause.

DISCRIMINATION AGAINST TRANSGENDER PEOPLE SIGNIFICANTLY \nHARMS AMICI STATES AND THEIR RESIDENTS \nA.  The Act Directly Harms Transgender Teens Traveling to \nAlabama and Imposes Spillover Costs on Amici States \nDenying gender-affirming care harms transgender teenagers, \nincluding teenaged residents of amici States who travel to Alabama. Amici \nStates’ teenage residents travel to Alabama for school, vacation, and work. \nFor example, the University of Alabama (UA) enrolls 27,750 undergraduate \nstudents.5 Nearly 68% of UA’s students come from out-of-state, including \n464 undergraduates from Illinois, 304 from California, 217 from New \nJersey, 197 from North Carolina, 181 from New York, and 173 from \nPennsylvania.6 College freshmen are often 17-18 years old and considered \n“minors” under the Act.  (See S.B. 184, ALA. 2022 REG. SESS. § 3(1) (Ala. \n                                         \n5 See UA Demographics & Diversity Report, College \nFactual, https://www.collegefactual.com/colleges/the-university-\nof-alabama/student-\nlife/diversity/#:~:text=67.63%25%20of%20UA%20students%20co\nme,from%20out%20of%20the%20country (last visited July 6, \n2022). \n6 Id.  \n4 \n\n  USCA11 Case: 22-11707     Date Filed: 08/17/2022     Page: 29 of 61 \n2022) (defining “minor” as anyone under age 19). Similarly, events and \nattractions bring hundreds of thousands of out-of-state visitors, including \n“minors” under the Act, to Alabama each year.7 And approximately 47,000 \npeople work in Alabama but live in a different state.8 \n                                         \n7 Nearly 1.3 million people visit Alabama’s national parks \nannually, including the Birmingham Civil Rights and Freedom \nRiders National Monuments. See Alabama, National Parks \nService, https://www.nps.gov/state/al/index.htm (last visited July \n6, 2022). Over one million people attend Mobile’s Mardi Gras \neach year, over 600,000 people visit the U.S. Space and Rocket \nCenter in Huntsville, and over 500,000 people flock to the Robert \nTrent Jones Golf Trail in Birmingham.

If they continue \nto take their medication, their providers and parents could risk imprisonment \nfor up to ten years. Teens traveling to Alabama, even on a temporary basis, \nmay lack access to gender-affirming medical care if they are hospitalized for \nan injury or need to refill a lost prescription. And Amici State’s residents \nworking in Alabama, like college students and visitors, would be expected to \ncease medical treatment.     \nDenying medically necessary care to transgender teens harms their \nphysical, emotional, and psychological health. See infra pp. 7–8 & Part II.C.  \nMany transgender teens suffer from gender dysphoria: the intense, \ndebilitating distress and anxiety that can result from incongruence between a \nperson’s gender identity and sex assigned at birth. If unaddressed, gender \ndysphoria can impact quality of life, cause fatigue, and trigger decreased \nsocial functioning, including reliance on drugs and alcohol.9 Those harms \n                                         \n9 See Emily Newfield et al., Female-to-Male Transgender \nQuality of Life, 15(9) Quality of Life Research 1447 (2006), \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16758113 (observing that \ntransgender men who received transition-related care reported \nhaving a higher health-related quality of life than those who had \nnot). \n6 \n\n  USCA11 Case: 22-11707     Date Filed: 08/17/2022     Page: 31 of 61 \ncan also lead to significant economic consequences for transgender \nindividuals. A recent survey shows that over half of transgender people \nreport economic insecurity due to gender identity discrimination.10   \nApart from the direct harms inflicted on amici States’ residents in \nAlabama, the Act threatens spillover effects that extend far beyond \nAlabama’s borders. For example, transgender people who experience \nincome insecurity are more likely to be uninsured and to rely on state-run \nprograms such as Medicaid.11 Thus, state programs are likely to bear the \n                                         \n10 Sharita Gruberg et al., Ctr. for Am.

AMICI STATES PROTECT ACCESS TO GENDER-AFFIRMING \nHEALTHCARE BASED ON WELL-ESTABLISHED MEDICAL STANDARDS \nIn amici States’ experience, ensuring access to gender-affirming \nhealthcare has improved health outcomes for transgender teenagers. Amici \nStates’ laws and policies protect transgender teenagers by guaranteeing their \naccess to healthcare, including gender-affirming healthcare. To prevent the \ndirect economic, emotional, and health consequences of excluding \nindividuals from necessary healthcare, amici States ensure that their \nresidents, including transgender teenagers, have access to gender-affirming \n                                         \n(…continued) \n11/Separation_and_Stigma_2017.pdf. \n22 Gabriel R.

Robust data \nconfirm that such policies result in better health and economic outcomes. \nA.  Amici States Have Longstanding Anti-Discrimination Laws \nand Policies Guaranteeing Access to Gender-Affirming \nMedical Care \nSeveral amici States explicitly prohibit insurers from excluding \ngender-affirming care from their insurance policies. These protections \nincrease access to healthcare by barring discriminatory health insurance \ncoverage that contravenes best medical practices. Of particular concern are \nbarriers to healthcare erected against transgender patients for care that is \notherwise accessible to cisgender patients. Since 2012, at least 24 States and \nthe District of Columbia have prohibited health insurance discrimination \nagainst transgender people.24 These laws promote sound medical practices \nand increase equity in healthcare.  \nIn California, for instance, longstanding laws and regulations ensure \nthat transgender patients are not denied or limited coverage for care \navailable to others. California’s Medicaid program (“Medi-Cal”) has \n                                         \n24 Healthcare Law and Policies, \nhttps://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-\nmaps/healthcare_laws_and_policies (last visited Dec. 23, 2021). \n12 \n\n  USCA11 Case: 22-11707     Date Filed: 08/17/2022     Page: 37 of 61 \nrequired gender-affirming coverage since 2001.25 In 2012, the California \nInsurance Commissioner adopted regulations prohibiting private insurers \nfrom denying coverage for “services related to gender transition . . . \nincluding but not limited to hormone therapy” if the same services are \navailable when unrelated to gender transition.26 The regulation also forbids \nplans from requiring a premium based on the insured’s identity as a \ntransgender person.27 These rules apply regardless of the beneficiary’s age.  \nOther amici States are equally committed to treating transgender \npeople with dignity and respect when accessing healthcare, and ensuring that \nthey are not denied needed care. For example, in 2015, the Minnesota \nDepartments of Commerce and Health confirmed that health plans subject to \n                                         \n25 See Cal.

Ensuring Access to Gender-Affirming Medical Care Has \nImproved Health Outcomes for Transgender People, \nIncluding Teenagers \nAmici States’ policies ensure that residents have access to these best \nmedical practices, including gender-affirming care, which has improved \nhealth outcomes for our transgender teenage residents. \nStudies overwhelmingly show that mental health for transgender \nteenagers improves when they have access to early treatment.42 A 2021 \nanalysis of a survey of nearly 12,000 transgender and nonbinary teens and \n                                         \n39 McPherson, Bulletin 13-IB-01-30/15, supra note 37, at 4.  \n40 Wash.

And as the district court explained, that classification cannot \nsatisfy intermediate scrutiny because “the State puts on no evidence to show \nthat transitioning medications are ‘experimental’” and because “nothing in \nthe record shows that medical providers are pushing transitioning \nmedications on minors.”55 Id. at 24. \n                                         \n54 As in Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. 1731, 1741–\n42 (2020), it is unnecessary for this Court to even define “sex” or \n“gender” in order to conclude that the Alabama statute \nimpermissibly discriminates on the basis of sex, gender, and \ntransgender status. Accord United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. \n515, 532–33 (1996) (state laws that discriminate based on “sex” \nand “gender” subject to heightened scrutiny); Grimm v. \nGloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, 608 (4th Cir. 2020) \n(applying heightened scrutiny where challenged policy “cannot be \nstated without referencing sex.”). \n55 The Act fails under any standard of review. Categorically \nbanning all gender-affirming medications for all transgender \nminors, regardless of their individual circumstances and in \ndefiance of well-established medical standards, is not rationally \nrelated to any legitimate government interest. \n26 \n\n  USCA11 Case: 22-11707     Date Filed: 08/17/2022     Page: 51 of 61 \nB.  Amici Arkansas’s Arguments Lack Merit \nAlabama’s complete ban on puberty-blockers and hormone therapy \nfor all teenagers (including 18-year-olds)—regardless of their age, maturity, \nclinical situation, and in contravention of a doctor’s evidence-based \nrecommendation—unlawfully deprives some transgender adolescents of \nnecessary gender-affirming healthcare. Some States, led by Arkansas, \nattempt to support the Act with two primary arguments. Neither has merit. \nFirst, Arkansas asserts that there is an “intensely boiling medical \ncontroversy” over the safety and effectiveness of providing puberty blockers \nand hormone therapies to teenagers. Arkansas Amicus at 4. But Arkansas \ncites no article, study, or recommendation to substantiate its claim that \ngender-affirming healthcare for teenagers is never appropriate. As \nAlabama’s own expert conceded in the district court, “no country or state in \nthe world categorically bans” transitioning medications for transgender \nteenagers like the Act. DE107:18. While standards for gender-affirming \nhealthcare are, like all other forms of medical treatment, refined and updated \nas new evidence becomes available, Arkansas offers no support for its view \nthat gender-affirming care can be categorically banned consistent with \nmedical standards. \n27 \n\n  USCA11 Case: 22-11707     Date Filed: 08/17/2022     Page: 52 of 61 \nArkansas, moreover, is misleadingly selective about which studies and \narticles it emphasizes and omits key context from many of the studies it \ncites.56 For example, Arkansas cites a recent Washington Post article \npublished by the founding psychologist of the first pediatric transgender \nclinic in the United States and by a former President of the U.S. Professional \nAssociation for Transgender Health to contend that gender-affirming care \nmay be harmful. Arkansas Amicus at 6–7. But that article did not support a \nban on all gender-affirming care. It merely urged “comprehensive \nassessment for all dysphoric youth before starting medical interventions” in \naccordance with WPATH standards of care.57 Indeed, the authors stated that \nthey “enthusiastically support the appropriate gender-affirming medical care \n                                         \n56 In another example, Arkansas’s cherry-picked cite \nregarding the sexual experiences of transgender adults, Arkansas \nAmicus at 8–9, is contradicted by scientific evidence. E.g., \nMichael Zaliznyak et al., Effects of Gender-Affirming Hormone \nTherapy on Sexual Function of Transgender Men and Women, \n206 J. of Urology 637, 638 (2021), \nhttps://www.auajournals.org/doi/epdf/10.1097/JU.0000000000002\n045.06. Categorical bans on medical treatment cannot be justified \nby selective and misleading citations. \n57 L. Edwards-Leeper and E. Anderson, The Mental Health \nEstablishment is Failing Trans Kids, The Washington Post \n(November 24, 2021), \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/11/24/trans-kids-\ntherapy-psychologist. \n28 \n\n  USCA11 Case: 22-11707     Date Filed: 08/17/2022     Page: 53 of 61 \nfor trans youth” and “are disgusted by the legislation trying to ban it.”58 The \nauthors further explained that attempts to “deny medical treatment to all \ntransgender young people . . . are unacceptable, and medically unsound.”59 \nSecond, Arkansas relies on fears about medical providers failing to \ncomply with standards of care to justify a categorical ban on gender-\naffirming healthcare. Arkansas asserts that “at many facilities, hormones are \nprovided on demand to children who say they are transgender, without any \npsychological assessment.” Arkansas Amicus at 2. If true, such a practice \nwould be wholly inconsistent with current standards of care. According to \nWPATH, mental health professionals working with children and adolescents \nwith gender dysphoria should: (1) “directly assess gender dysphoria in \nchildren and adolescents”; (2) “provide family counseling and supportive \npsychotherapy to assist children and adolescents with exploring their gender \nidentity, alleviating distress related to their gender dysphoria, and \nameliorating any other psychosocial difficulties”; and (3) “assess and treat \nany coexisting mental health concerns of children or adolescents.”60 At that \n                                         \n58 Id.  \n59 Id.  \n60 See The World Professional Organization for \nTransgender Health: Standards of Care for the Health of \nTranssexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People at \n(continued…) \n29 \n\n  USCA11 Case: 22-11707     Date Filed: 08/17/2022     Page: 54 of 61 \npoint, if adolescents are referred for additional physical interventions such as \npuberty blockers, the “referral should include documentation of an \nassessment of gender dysphoria and mental health, the adolescent’s \neligibility for physical interventions (outlined below), the mental health \nprofessional’s relevant expertise, and any other information pertinent to the \nyouth’s health and referral for specific treatments” (emphasis added).61  \nMoreover, Arkansas’s position ignores a State’s substantial authority \nto oversee and regulate providers. States have an obligation to ensure that \nmedical providers are following appropriate standards of care and gender-\naffirming care is subject to oversight like other medical practices. And, in \nany event, it is plainly overreach to impose a categorical ban of well-\nestablished, evidence-based medical treatment to address allegations that \nsome small number of providers do not always follow the standards of care. \nAmici States rely on their regulators and licensing boards to address \nimproper medical care and prevent harm to their residents. Even Arkansas \nacknowledges the power of States to address substandard medical care, \n                                         \n(…continued) \n14, available at \nhttps://www.wpath.org/media/cms/Documents/SOC%20v7/SOC%2\n0V7_English2012.pdf?_t=1613669341. \n61 Id.  \n30 \n\n  USCA11 Case: 22-11707     Date Filed: 08/17/2022     Page: 55 of 61 \npointing to the overprescribing of opioids. See Arkansas Amicus at 17–18. \nBut States did not react to that crisis by completely banning the use of \nopioids and depriving many patients of medications to manage pain. Instead, \nas Arkansas concedes, States adopted legislation or regulations to curb the \namount of opioids that physicians could prescribe.

Before the Court are five procedural motions. First, \nthe United States moves to intervene on behalf of Plaintiffs under Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 24. (Doc. 58 at 2). For the reasons given on the record during the \nmotion hearing, the United States’s motion to intervene (Doc. 58) is GRANTED. \nSecond, the States of Arkansas, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, \nMississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, \nand West Virginia move for leave to proceed as amici curiae and file a brief in \nsupport of Defendants. (Doc. 71 at 1). Third, twenty-two health organizations move \nfor leave to proceed as amici curiae and file a brief in support of Plaintiffs. (Doc. 91 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 94   Filed 05/08/22   Page 2 of 2\nat 1–2). Because the proposed amici briefs are timely and offer relevant information, \nthe motions for leave to proceed as amici curiae (Docs. 71 & 91) are GRANTED. \nThe  Court  will  consider  the  briefs  in  ruling  on  the  motions  for  a  preliminary \ninjunction. \nFourth, Plaintiffs move for leave to file Exhibit 40 of their Exhibit List under \nseal. (Doc. 84 at 2). Fifth, Plaintiffs Megan Poe and Dr. Rachel Koe move to seal \nthe preliminary injunction hearing while they testify. (Doc. 90 at 2). For the reasons \ngiven on the record during the preliminary injunction hearing, the motions to seal \n(Docs. 84 & 90) are GRANTED. \nFinally, as the Court explained on the record, this is a complicated case that \nraises complex and important issues and consists of many hundreds of pages of \nbriefing and exhibits. The Court has made very substantial progress toward crafting \nan opinion in this matter and expects to file the opinion by the end of this week, if \nnot sooner. \nDONE and ORDERED May 8, 2022. \n \n \n \n_________________________________ \nLILES C.

Put simply, Section 4(a)(1)–(3) of the Act makes it \na crime to administer or prescribe puberty blockers and hormone therapies to a minor \nfor purposes of transitioning the minor’s gender. S.B. 184, ALA. 2022 REG. SESS. \n§ 4(a)(1)–(3) (Ala. 2022). The United States Government—intervening on behalf of \nPlaintiffs—claims that Section 4(a)(1)–(3) violates the Equal Protection Clause of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment. (Doc. 92 at 13–14). In response, Defendants move for \npartial  judgment  on  the  Government’s  pleadings  under  Federal  Rule  of  Civil \nProcedure 12(c). (Doc. 171 at 1). The motion is denied for two reasons. \nFirst,  the  motion—in  substance—does  not  seek  a  “judgment”  on  the \nGovernment’s Equal Protection claim, but rather attempts to contest prospective \nnonparty subpoenas directed toward Alabama legislators and their constituents. \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 278   Filed 04/17/23   Page 2 of 3\n(Doc. 171 at 6). Defendants themselves admit that the purpose of the motion is “to \nmake clear that the federal government has alleged no facts supporting a theory that \nwould justify these discovery requests.” Id. at 11. No such request is before the \nCourt. And the Government, as counsel explained during oral argument, does not \nintend to make such a request moving forward. (Doc. 266 at 33) (“I do want to \nconfirm that . . . we are not going to be subpoenaing legislators.”). Thus, Defendants’ \nmotion—at its core—presents no judiciable issue. \nSecond,  the  motion  does  not  seek  to  dismiss  the  Government’s  Equal \nProtection claim entirely, but only to the extent it “attempts to allege intentional \ndiscrimination or a rational basis claim.” (Doc. 171 at 24). Although the Eleventh \nCircuit has never squarely addressed the issue, many district courts have concluded \nthat a motion for judgment on the pleadings is not suited to eliminate a portion of a \nsingle claim or defense. E.g., Affordable Aerial Photography, Inc. v. Abdelsayed, \n2022 WL 1124795, at *5 (S.D. Fla. Apr. 15, 2022) (concluding that Rule 12(c) does \nnot authorize a partial judgment on a single claim or defense); Munro v. Fairchild \nTropical Botanic Garden, Inc., 2021 WL 894380, at *2 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 3, 2021) \n(“Rule  12(c)’s  language  contains  no  provision  for  a  ‘partial’  judgment  on  the \npleadings directed to only a portion of a single claim.”); Cont’l 332 Fund, LLC v. \nKozlowski, 2020 WL 1234808, at *6 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 13, 2020) (explaining that \n  2 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 278   Filed 04/17/23   Page 3 of 3\n“courts should not use Rule 12(c) to split claims into component parts and dismiss \nthem piecemeal”). \nThe Court finds these decisions persuasive in the context of this case—where \nthe claims at issue involve complex constitutional issues and substantial discovery \nand motion practices. Accordingly, because Defendants’ motion attacks Plaintiffs’ \nEqual Protection claim only in part, the Court concludes that the motion is improper \non its face. \n*  *  * \nFor these reasons, Defendants’ motion for partial judgment on the pleadings \n(Doc. 171) is DENIED. \nDONE and ORDERED April 17, 2023. \n \n \n \n_________________________________ \nLILES C.

The “Alabama Vulnerable Child \nCompassion and Protection Act,” No. 2022-289, Senate Bill (“S.B.”) 184 (2022), \nconditions whether a minor can receive certain forms of medical care on the sex \nthat young person was assigned at birth. Section 4 of S.B. 184 makes it a felony for \nany person to “engage in or cause” medically necessary gender-affirming \nprocedures and treatments for transgender minors, while leaving other minors free \nto receive the same procedures and treatments. \nBy denying transgender minors—and only transgender minors—access to \ngender-affirming care, S.B. 184 violates the Equal Protection Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment. The law unjustifiably prohibits transgender minors from \naccessing medically necessary and appropriate care, while imposing no such \nlimitation on cisgender minors. S.B. 184 discriminates on the basis of both sex and \ntransgender status, and it fails intermediate scrutiny. The law’s ban on medically \nnecessary gender-affirming care for transgender minors is not substantially related \nto serving an important government objective. To the contrary: the law actually \nharms the health of transgender youth. And it reflects a bias against transgender \nindividuals that can never provide a legitimate basis for legislation. Indeed, S.B. \n184 would not even survive rational-basis review. \n1 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 62-1   Filed 04/29/22   Page 12 of 40\nImplementation of S.B. 184 will have immediate, drastic, and often \ntraumatic physical and psychological impacts on vulnerable transgender children \nand will cause irreparable harm to medical professionals, parents and caregivers, \ntransgender minors, and the interests of the United States. The balance of the \nequities and the public interest also justify preliminary relief. Therefore, the United \nStates respectfully requests that this Court grant this motion.   \nBACKGROUND \n \nI.  Transgender Youth and Their Need for Medically Necessary and \nAppropriate Gender-Affirming Care \n \nTransgender people are individuals whose gender identity does not conform \nwith the sex they were assigned at birth. A transgender boy is a child or youth who \nwas assigned a female sex at birth but whose gender identity is male; a transgender \ngirl is a child or youth who was assigned a male sex at birth but whose gender \nidentity is female. By contrast, a cisgender child has a gender identity that \ncorresponds with the sex the child was assigned at birth. A person’s gender identity \nis innate. \nAccording to the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic & \nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders,1 “gender dysphoria” is the diagnostic term \nfor the condition experienced by some transgender people of clinically significant \n \n1 American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, \nFifth Edition, Text Revision (2022), https://perma.cc/FM78-QMZ2. \n2 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 62-1   Filed 04/29/22   Page 13 of 40\ndistress resulting from the lack of congruence between their gender identity and the \nsex assigned to them at birth. Declaration of Dr. Stephen Rosenthal, MD, in \nSupport of Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order & Preliminary \nInjunction, Dkt. 8-3 (“Rosenthal Decl.”) ¶¶ 24-25; Declaration of Dr. Linda A. \nHawkins, Ph.D., LPC, in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary \nRestraining Order & Preliminary Injunction, Dkt. 8-1 (“Hawkins Decl.”) ¶ 25.  \nTo be diagnosed with gender dysphoria, the incongruence between sex \nassigned at birth and gender identity must persist for at least six months and be \naccompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment in occupational, \nsocial, or other important areas of functioning. Rosenthal Decl. ¶ 25. The inability \nof transgender youth to live consistent with their gender identity due to irreversible \nphysical changes in their bodies has significant negative impacts on their overall \nhealth and well-being. See Hawkins Decl. ¶¶ 45-46. The delay or denial of \nmedically necessary treatment for gender dysphoria causes many transgender \nminors to develop serious co-occurring mental health conditions, such as anxiety, \ndepression, and suicidality. Rosenthal Decl. ¶¶ 26, 55; see also Hawkins Decl. ¶ \n41.   \nGender dysphoria is highly treatable with the use of medical treatments that \naddress the clinically significant distress by helping people who are transgender \nlive in alignment with their gender identity. See Rosenthal Decl. ¶¶ 23, 26. The \n3 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 62-1   Filed 04/29/22   Page 14 of 40\nprecise treatments for gender dysphoria depend on each person’s individualized \nneeds. Id. ¶ 23; Hawkins Decl.¶¶ 32-37. The types of treatments provided differ \ndepending on the patient’s age. Rosenthal Decl. ¶ 33.  \nMedical treatment standards for gender dysphoria, including for minors, are \nwell-established. Declaration of Dr. Armand Antommaria in Support of Plaintiff-\nIntervenor United States’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and a \nPreliminary Injunction (“Antommaria Decl.”), attached hereto as Exhibit 1, ¶¶ 17, \n23-38. The American Academy of Pediatrics agrees that gender-affirming care is \nsafe, effective, and necessary for the health and wellbeing of minors suffering from \ngender dysphoria.2 Id. ¶¶ 34-35. Before puberty, treatment for gender dysphoria \ndoes not include pharmaceutical or surgical intervention and is limited to “social \ntransition.” Hawkins Decl. ¶ 27.

See Rosenthal Decl. ¶¶ 36-37.

The Legislative Debate Regarding Senate Bill 184 \nThe process that produced S.B. 184 is replete with expressions of skepticism \nabout and hostility to the needs of transgender youth. In 2021 statement, for \nexample, Representative Wes Allen, a sponsor of S.B. 184, explained that a \nmotivation behind legislation banning gender-affirming care for transgender youth \n \n3 Wylie Hembree, Peggy Cohen-Kettenis, & Louis Gooren et al., Endocrine Treatment of \nGender-Dysphoric/Gender-Incongruent Persons: An Endocrine Society Clinical Practice \nGuideline, The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism 3869-3903, Vol. 102, Issue 11 \n(Nov. 2017), https://perma.cc/8R3P-6NQY. \n6 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 62-1   Filed 04/29/22   Page 17 of 40\nis to affirm that if children “are born male, that they’re a male and if they’re born \nfemale, they’re a female.”4   \nDuring legislative debates, proponents of S.B. 184, including Representative \nAllen5 and another bill sponsor, Senator Shay Shelnutt, 6 referred to gender-\naffirming care, when provided to transgender youths as “child abuse” without \nexplaining why gender-affirming care for all other youth is entirely appropriate.  \nFurthermore, during a March 2, 2022 House Judiciary Committee hearing \nheld on Alabama House Bill 266 (a companion bill to S.B. 184), Representative \nAllen compared gender-affirming medical care to “vaping,” “dealing with \ncigarettes,” and “dealing with drinking”—each of them a form of voluntary \nactivity that he characterized as antisocial.7 Representative Allen also compared \nprescribing medications in the context of gender-affirming care to giving “anabolic \nsteroids” to young boys who believe they are a “Division I athlete” or a \n“professional athlete.”8 And later, during debate on April 7, 2022, Representative \nAllen not only analogized gender-affirming care to another often-criticized practice \n \n4 Tony Perkins, Wes Allen Discusses Upcoming Alabama Senate Vote on Vulnerable Child \nCompassion and Protection Act, YouTube (Feb. 15, 2021), \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Q_b22cUWw. \n5 Alabama House Judiciary Committee, House Judy Committee – 3/2/2022, 1:34:28 PM, Vimeo \n(Mar. 2, 2022), https://vimeo.com/683940881/4edaeefda2. \n6 Kiara Alfonseca, Alabama Governor Signs ‘Don’t Say Gay,’ Trans Care, and Bathroom Ban \nBills, ABC News (Apr. 8, 2022), https://perma.cc/6ESP-A8E9. \n7 Alabama House Judiciary Committee, supra note 5. \n8 Id. \n7 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 62-1   Filed 04/29/22   Page 18 of 40\nbut criticized parents who seek it for their children, stating, “We do not allow \nchildren to get tattoos even with parental permission. And why not? Because we do \nnot allow parents to permanently alter the bodies of their children.”9 Even on its \nown terms, this statement is inaccurate; in fact, Alabama law does permit minors to \nobtain a tattoo with prior written informed consent of the parent or legal guardian. \nAla. Code § 22-17A-2(a).  \nIn signing S.B. 184 into law, Governor Kay Ivey also expressed moral \ndisapproval of gender-affirming care for transgender youth: “I believe very \nstrongly that if the Good Lord made you a boy, you are a boy, and if He made you \na girl, you are a girl . . . [L]et us all focus on helping them to properly develop into \nthe adults God intended them to be.”10 \nIII.  Senate Bill 184 \nGovernor Ivey signed S.B. 184 into law on April 8, 2022. The law becomes \neffective on May 8, 2022. See S.B. 184, § 11.  \nSection 3 of the bill defines “sex” as the “biological state of being male or \nfemale, based on the individual’s sex organs, chromosomes, and endogenous \nhormone profiles.” Id. at § 3(3). S.B. 184’s legislative findings reject the need for \ninterventions to treat gender dysphoria, describing such treatments as “unproven” \n \n9 Alabama House of Representatives, House Part 1 – 4/7/2022, 9:32:05 AM, Vimeo (April 7, \n2022), https://vimeo.com/697000650/59a642f5d4. \n10 Alfonseca, supra note 6. \n8 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 62-1   Filed 04/29/22   Page 19 of 40\nand “experimental” and causing “numerous harmful effects.” Id. at § 2(11). The \nfindings characterize a “discordance between their sex and identity” as a phase that \nresolves itself over time in most cases. Id. at § 2(4)-(5).  \nSection 4 of S.B. 184 states that “no person shall engage in or cause” \nspecified types of medical care to be performed on a minor11 with “the purpose of \nattempting to alter the appearance of or affirm the minor’s perception of his or her \ngender or sex, if that appearance or perception is inconsistent” with their sex \nassigned at birth. Id. at § 4(a). The practices prohibited by Section 4 of S.B. 184 \ninclude administering puberty blockers, administering hormone therapy, and \nsurgical interventions (including the removal of “any healthy or non-diseased body \npart or tissue, except for a male circumcision”). Id. at § 4(a)(1)-(6). Notably, there \nis an exception for procedures “undertaken to treat a minor born with a medically \nverifiable disorder of sex development.” Id. at § 4(b).  \nA violation of Section 4 of S.B. 184 is a Class C felony, id. at § 4(c), which \nis punishable by up to 10 years of imprisonment and a fine of up to $15,000. See \nAla. Crim. Code §§ 13-A-5-6(a)(3), 13A-5-11(a)(3). \nBy its very terms, Section 4 of S.B. 184 means that parents of transgender \nyouth, transgender minors old enough to make their own medial decisions, health \n \n11 In Alabama, the age of majority is nineteen.

Alabama, 691 F.3d 1269, 1281 (11th Cir. 2012). Each of \nthese factors is satisfied here. \nI.  The United States is Likely to Succeed on the Merits of its Equal \nProtection Claim \n \nThe United States is likely to succeed on the merits because Section 4 of \nS.B. 184 violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by \ndiscriminating against transgender minors on the basis of their sex and their \nmembership in a quasi-suspect class. Not only does Section 4 fail the heightened \nscrutiny applicable to such laws; it would fail even rationality review. \nA. S.B. 184’s Ban on Gender-Affirming Medical Care Warrants \nHeightened Scrutiny Under the Equal Protection Clause  \nSection 4 of S.B. 184 is subject to heightened scrutiny because, in forbidding \ntransgender youth to obtain medically necessary gender-affirming care while \n10 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 62-1   Filed 04/29/22   Page 21 of 40\nleaving all other minors eligible for such care, it discriminates on the basis of sex \nand transgender status. \n1.  S.B. 184’s Ban on Gender-Affirming Care Discriminates on the \nBasis of Sex and Therefore Triggers Intermediate Scrutiny \n   \nS.B. 184 bans gender-affirming care only when that care is being provided \nto transgender individuals. As the Supreme Court instructed, treating an individual \ndifferently because that person is transgender “unavoidably” constitutes sex \ndiscrimination because it rests on a person’s having “one sex identified at birth” \nbut identifying with a different sex or gender “today.” Bostock v. Clayton County, \nGa., 140 S. Ct. 1731, 1746 (2020). Similarly, the Eleventh Circuit has held that \ndifferential treatment based on “gender-nonconformity is sex discrimination, \nwhether it’s described as being on the basis of sex or gender.” Glenn v. Brumby, \n663 F.3d 1312, 1317 (11th Cir. 2011). Other circuits have held the same. See \nGrimm v. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, 608-10 (4th Cir. 2020), as \namended (Aug. 28, 2020); Whitaker By Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. \n1 Bd. of Educ., 858 F.3d 1034, 1051 (7th Cir. 2017) (school policy requiring \nstudents to use bathroom in accordance with the sex on the student’s birth \ncertificate “is inherently based upon a sex-classification”); D.T. v. Christ, 552 F. \nSupp. 3d 888, 896 (D. Ariz. 2021); Flack v. Wisconsin Dep’t of Health Servs., 328 \nF. Supp. 3d 931, 948 (W.D. Wis. 2018). \nSection 4 of S.B. 184 discriminates against transgender minors by \n11 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 62-1   Filed 04/29/22   Page 22 of 40\nunjustifiably denying them access to certain forms of medically necessary care. \nThe law prohibits transgender minors from obtaining care that has been well \nestablished as medically appropriate and necessary, while imposing no comparable \nlimitation on cisgender minors for obtaining the same forms of care. \nIn addition, Section 4 of S.B. 184 expressly discriminates on the basis of sex \nbecause the medical treatments available to an Alabama minor under S.B. 184 \ndepend on the sex that minor was assigned at birth based on “the individual’s sex \norgans, chromosomes, and endogenous hormone profiles.” S.B. 184, § 3. Under \nS.B. 184, if a minor was assigned male at birth, that minor cannot receive any of \nthe treatments or procedures identified in Section 4 that would “alter the \nappearance of” the minor in a way that is “inconsistent” with being male or that \nwould “affirm” the minor’s “perception” of being female. See S.B. 184, § 4(a). \nSimilarly, if a minor was assigned female at birth, that minor cannot receive any of \nthe treatments or procedures identified in Section 4 that would “alter the \nappearance of” the minor in a way that is “inconsistent” with being female or that \nwould “affirm” the minor’s “perception” of being male. See id at § 4(a). By \ncontrast, all other minors can access the covered treatments because those \ntreatments are, for them, consistent with the sex the minor was assigned at birth. \nSee id. at § 4(a). S.B. 184 also discriminates on the basis of sex because it \nconditions the availability of particular medical procedures on a sex stereotype: \n12 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 62-1   Filed 04/29/22   Page 23 of 40\nthat an individual’s gender identity should match the sex that individual was \nassigned at birth. See Glenn, 663 F.3d at 1316, 1319-20; see also United States v. \nVirginia, 518 U.S. 515, 549-50 (1996). \nSex-based classifications like S.B. 184 are subject to heightened \nconstitutional scrutiny, specifically intermediate scrutiny. Virginia, 518 U.S. at \n555; Glenn, 663 F.3d at 1315-16 (citations and quotations omitted). \n2.  S.B. 184’s Ban on Gender-Affirming Medical Care \nDiscriminates Against Transgender Individuals, And \nTherefore Triggers Intermediate Scrutiny \n \nS.B. 184 also warrants heightened scrutiny because it discriminates on the \nbasis of transgender status. Its legislative findings reflect an intent to target \ntransgender minors—and only transgender minors—by expressing a commitment \nto preventing medical care that addresses youth who experience “discordance \nbetween their sex and their internal sense of identity” and “reveal signs of gender \nnonconformity,” including those designated with “gender dysphoria.” Compare \nS.B. 184 § 2(2), 2(5), with Antommaria Decl. ¶¶ 43-45.12 \nA law that criminalizes access to particular medical treatments based on \n \n12 It does not matter that S.B. 184 never expressly uses the word “transgender,” since it is clear \nbeyond doubt that transgender minors are the focus on the bill. “Some activities may be such an \nirrational object of disfavor that, if they are targeted, and if they also happen to be engaged in \nexclusively or predominantly by a particular class of people, an intent to disfavor that class can \nreadily be presumed.” Bray v. Alexandria Women’s Health Clinic, 506 U.S. 263, 270 (1993); see \nalso Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1741 (noting that it is “it is impossible to discriminate against a \nperson for being . . . transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex”); \nChrist, 552 F. Supp. 3d at 895-96. \n13 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 62-1   Filed 04/29/22   Page 24 of 40\nindividuals’ transgender status demands heightened scrutiny because transgender \npeople are a quasi-suspect class, as the two circuits to have squarely addressed the \nquestion have held. See Grimm, 972 F.3d at 611; Karnoski v. Trump, 926 F.3d \n1180, 1200 (9th Cir. 2019). Several district courts have concluded the same.13  \nAn analysis of the factors used by the Supreme Court confirms that \nclassifications based on transgender status warrant heightened scrutiny.14 First, \ntransgender people, as a class, have historically been subject to discrimination and \ncontinue to “face discrimination, harassment, and violence because of their gender \nidentity.” Whitaker, 858 F.3d at 1051; see also Grimm, 972 F.3d at 611-12; Flack, \n328 F. Supp. 3d at 953; M.A.B., 286 F. Supp. 3d at 720; Evancho, 237 F. Supp. 3d \nat 288; Highland, 208 F. Supp. 3d at 874; Adkins, 143 F. Supp. 3d at 139.15 \n \n13 See F.V. v. Barron, 286 F. Supp. 3d 1131, 1145 (D. Idaho 2018), decision clarified sub nom. \nF.V. v. Jeppesen, 477 F. Supp. 3d 1144 (D. Idaho 2020); Flack, 328 F. Supp. 3d at 951-53; \nM.A.B. v. Bd. of Educ. of Talbot Cnty., 286 F. Supp. 3d 704, 719 (D. Md. 2018); Evancho v. \nPine-Richland Sch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 3d 267, 288 (W.D. Pa. 2017); Bd. of Educ. of the \nHighland Loc. Sch. Dist. v. United States Dep’t of Educ., 208 F. Supp. 3d 850, 873-74 (S.D. \nOhio 2016); Adkins v. City of New York, 143 F. Supp. 3d 134, 139-140 (S.D.N.Y. 2015); \nNorsworthy v. Beard, 87 F. Supp. 3d 1104, 1119 (N.D. Cal. 2015). \n14 Those factors include whether the class (1) has historically been subjected to discrimination, \nsee Lyng v. Castillo, 477 U.S. 635, 638 (1986); (2) has a defining characteristic that “frequently \nbears no relation to ability to perform or contribute to society,” City of Cleburne, Tex. v. \nCleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 440-441 (1985); (3) has “obvious, immutable, or \ndistinguishing characteristics that define them as a discrete group,” Lyng, 477 U.S. at 638; and \n(4) is a minority lacking political power, Bowen v. Gilliard, 483 U.S. 587, 602 (1987).  \n15 Ample evidence indicates that transgender people experience higher levels of physical and \nsexual violence, harassment, and discrimination in the workplace, housing, healthcare, and \nschool than their non-transgender counterparts. Nearly half (47%) of respondents to the 2015 \nU.S. Transgender Survey reported being sexually assaulted. Sandy E. James et al., Nat’l Ctr. for \nTransgender Equal., The Report of the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey (Dec. 2016), \nhttps://perma.cc/5CL3-RG9E (hereinafter USTS Report). Over 77% of respondents to the 2015 \n \n14 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 62-1   Filed 04/29/22   Page 25 of 40\nSecond, no “data or argument suggest[s] that a transgender person, simply \nby virtue of transgender status, is any less productive than any other member of \nsociety.” Adkins, 143 F. Supp. 3d at 139.16 The American Psychiatric Association \nhas concluded that “[b]eing transgender or gender diverse implies no impairment \nin judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities.”17 \nThird, transgender individuals share “obvious, immutable, or distinguishing \ncharacteristics that define them as a discrete group.” Bowen, 483 U.S. at 602 \n(quoting Lyng, 477 U.S. at 638) (emphasis added). Specifically, transgender \nindividuals’ “gender identity does not align with the gender they were assigned at \nbirth.” M.A.B., 286 F. Supp. 3d at 721. Multiple courts have held that transgender \nstatus is immutable, and “being transgender is not a choice[,] [r]ather, it is as \nnatural and immutable as being cisgender.” Grimm, 972 F.3d at 612-613.18 \nFourth, people who are transgender lack political power. See id. at 613. \nWhile the number of openly transgender elected officials is growing, they still \n \nU.S. Transgender Survey who were out or perceived as transgender in kindergarten through \ntwelfth grade reported having one or more negative experiences (such as verbal harassment or \nphysical attacks) in K-12 because people thought they were transgender. Id. at 132, 133. Another \nrecent study found 61% of employed transgender respondents between the ages of thirteen to \ntwenty-four reported experiencing discrimination in the workplace.

The proliferation of enacted legislation \naimed at restricting the rights of transgender individuals, particularly transgender \nminors, is further evidence of the limited political power of the transgender \ncommunity.19  \nBecause Section 4 of S.B. 184 discriminates against transgender persons and \nthey constitute a quasi-suspect class, the statute is subject to intermediate scrutiny. \nB. S.B. 184 Fails Heightened Scrutiny Because it is Not Substantially \nRelated to Achieving Alabama’s Articulated Governmental Interests \n \nTo survive heightened scrutiny, the State must show that Section 4 of S.B. \n184 “serves important governmental objectives” and that the “discriminatory \nmeans employed are substantially related to achievement of those objectives.” See \nVirginia, 518 U.S. at 524 (quoting Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 \nU.S. 718, 724 (1982)); see also Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 197 (1976). “The \nburden of justification is demanding and it rests entirely on the State.” Virginia, \n518 U.S. at 533 (quoting Mississippi Univ. for Women, 458 U.S. at 724). \nHeightened scrutiny requires that the justification proffered be “exceedingly \n \n19 The very same day Governor Ivey signed S.B. 184 into law, she also signed H.B. 322 into law. \nAlfonseca, supra note 6. H.B. 322 requires students in public K-12 schools to only use \nbathrooms and locker rooms that correspond with the sex listed on their original birth certificate; \nit also bans classroom instruction regarding sexual orientation and gender identity that is not age \nor developmentally “appropriate.” Alabama has also issued Policy Order 63, which requires \ntransgender individuals to undergo “gender reassignment surgery” before they may amend the \nsex designation on their driver’s licenses. See Corbitt v. Taylor, 513 F. Supp. 3d 1309 (M.D. Ala. \n2021). \n16 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 62-1   Filed 04/29/22   Page 27 of 40\npersuasive.” Id. at 531. The required inquiry provides an enhanced measure of \nprotection in circumstances where there is a greater danger that the legal \nclassification results from impermissible prejudice or stereotypes. See City of \nRichmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 493 (1989) (plurality opinion).  \nMoreover, when intermediate scrutiny applies, the “justification must be \ngenuine, not hypothesized or invented post hoc in response to litigation,” and \n“must not rely on overbroad generalizations.” Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533; see also \nGlenn, 663 F.3d at 1321; SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Abbott Labs., 740 F.3d \n471, 482 (9th Cir. 2014) (noting that the court must examine the law’s “actual \npurposes and carefully consider the resulting inequality to ensure that our most \nfundamental institutions neither send nor reinforce messages of stigma or second-\nclass status.”) (citing United States v. Windsor, 570 U.S. 744 (2013)). A \nclassification does not withstand heightened scrutiny when “the alleged \nobjective” of the classification differs from the “actual purpose.” Mississippi Univ. \nfor Women, 458 U.S. at 730. \nS.B. 184’s ban on medically necessary gender-affirming care for transgender \nyouth does not survive the rigorous analysis that heightened scrutiny demands for \ntwo reasons. First, the State’s articulated objectives are pretextual justifications \nthat mask the true purpose of the law: to express moral disapproval of a vulnerable \nand unpopular group. That desire is not legitimate, let alone important or \n17 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 62-1   Filed 04/29/22   Page 28 of 40\nexceedingly persuasive. Second, even assuming the State’s asserted interest of \nprotecting children is genuine, S.B. 184 is not substantially related to that interest \nbecause S.B. 184’s ban on various forms of gender-affirming care is harmful, not \nbeneficial, to children. \n1.  Alabama’s Stated Interest of Protecting Children is Pretextual \nS.B. 184’s stated purpose is to protect youth. The legislation’s text and its \nlegislative history, however, belie the State’s stated purpose. “[I]f the constitutional \nconception of ‘equal protection of the laws’ means anything, it must at the very \nleast mean” that the desire to express moral disapproval of “a politically unpopular \ngroup cannot constitute a legitimate governmental interest.” Dep’t of Agriculture v. \nMoreno, 413 U.S. 528, 534 (1973); see also Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429, 433 \n(1984). Unfortunately, S.B. 184’s real purpose is that forbidden desire. \nThe text and legislative history of S.B. 184 are marbled with expressions of \nmoral disapproval of transgender status. So, too, its suggestion that transgender \nminors will “outgrow” their gender identity. S.B. 184, § 2(4). \nFurthermore, S.B. 184’s legislative history, including statements from \nGovernor Ivey and co-sponsor Representative Allen, see pp. 7-8, supra, reflect \nprofound disapproval of people whose gender identity is inconsistent with the sex \nthey were assigned at birth. \nS.B. 184 bans particular treatments and procedures only when they are being \n18 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 62-1   Filed 04/29/22   Page 29 of 40\nused to affirm a gender identity that is “inconsistent with the minor’s sex” as \nassigned at birth. S.B. 184, § 4. As such, S.B. 184 singles out transgender minors \nfor discriminatory treatment. Those same procedures that S.B. 184 prohibits for \ntransgender minors, remain as permissible as before for all other purposes, \nincluding gender-affirming care for anyone who is not transgender. Puberty \nblockers and surgical treatments can have “life implications,” S.B. 184, § 2(15), for \ncisgender and intersex minors too, and yet Alabama leaves the decisions whether \nto obtain such treatments to treating physicians, parents, and minors. The law’s \nselective concern undercuts the state’s profession of a legitimate purpose. See \nChurch of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 547 \n(1993) (a state undermines its stated interest “when it leaves appreciable damage to \nthat supposedly vital interest unprohibited.”) (cleaned up).  \n2.  S.B. 184 is Not Substantially Related to Protecting Children \nfrom “Harmful” Effects of Gender-Affirming Care \n \nBut even if the State’s asserted interest of protecting children were genuine, \nS.B. 184’s felony ban on certain forms of gender-affirming care would violate the \nEqual Protection Clause because the ban is not “substantially related” to achieving \nthat objective. Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533 (quoting Mississippi Univ. for Women, \n458 U.S. at 724) (internal quotations omitted). Quite the opposite: banning the \nforms of gender-affirming care criminalized by S.B. 184 will have devastating \neffects on many transgender youths while providing no countervailing benefit to \n19 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 62-1   Filed 04/29/22   Page 30 of 40\nthem or anyone else. See Kirchberg v. Feenstra, 609 F.2d 727, 734 (5th Cir. 1979) \n(courts must “weigh[] the state interest sought to be furthered against the character \nof the discrimination caused by the statutory classification”).  \nThe empirical propositions upon which S.B. 184 rests are in fact untrue. \nFirst, gender-affirming care for gender dysphoria is safe and effective. \nContrary to the State’s assertion that gender-affirming care for transgender youth \nhas “numerous harmful effects,” see S.B. 184 § 11, the overwhelming weight of \nmedical evidence confirms that the medical care that S.B. 184 forbids is safe, \neffective, and medically necessary treatment for the health and wellbeing of \nchildren and adolescents suffering from gender dysphoria. Antommaria Decl. ¶¶ \n34-35; Rosenthal Decl. ¶¶ 23, 27-30; see generally pp. 4, 21-22, supra.20 \nMoreover, delaying or denying gender-affirming care to transgender youth \nexperiencing gender dysphoria can result in numerous harms, including depression, \nanxiety, and suicidality. See Hawkins Decl. ¶¶ 41, 45-46.21 The medical evidence \nshows that trying to “cure” a transgender individual with a gender dysphoria \ndiagnosis by forcing them to live in alignment with their sex assigned at birth, and \n \n20 Rafferty, supra note 2.  \n21 See Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., Office of Population Affairs, Gender Affirming Care \nand Young People, at 1, https://go.usa.gov/xuR8E (“Medical and psychosocial gender affirming \nhealthcare practices have been demonstrated to yield lower rates of adverse mental health \noutcomes, build self-esteem, and improve overall quality of life for transgender and gender \ndiverse youth.”). \n20 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 62-1   Filed 04/29/22   Page 31 of 40\nnot their gender identity, is severely harmful and ineffective. See Antommaria \nDecl. ¶ 47; Rosenthal Decl. ¶ 22. \nSecond, the medical research supporting gender-affirming care is \nsubstantial. Alabama is simply mistaken when it asserts that gender-affirming \nmedical treatment for patients experiencing gender dysphoria is new, unproven, \nand poorly studied. See S.B. 184 § 2(11). To the contrary. Antommaria Decl. ¶ 23. \nLeading medical associations, including the American Psychiatric Association, the \nWorld Professional Association for Transgender Health, the American Academy of \nPediatrics, and the Endocrine Society, have all recognized that gender-affirming \ncare is safe, effective, and medically necessary treatment for the health and \nwellbeing of some children and adolescents suffering from gender dysphoria. Id. ¶ \n35. Hormone treatment for gender dysphoria began soon after estrogen and \ntestosterone became commercially available in the 1930s and puberty blockers \nhave been in use for over 20 years. Id. ¶ 23.  \nThe assertions in S.B. 184’s legislative findings that the use of puberty \nblockers for youths experiencing gender dysphoria is “experimental” and not \n“FDA-approved,” see S.B. 184 § 2(7), is misleading. Antommaria Decl. ¶¶ 17, 19. \nThere have been ample observational studies, including federally funded trials, \nsupporting the use of puberty blockers and other gender-affirming hormone \ntherapy for adolescents. Id. ¶¶ 27-29.    \n21 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 62-1   Filed 04/29/22   Page 32 of 40\nThe safety and effectiveness of the treatments and procedures used to treat \nminors experiencing gender dysphoria is not undermined because there have not \nbeen randomized, placebo-based trials for those treatments and procedures. Id. ¶¶ \n24-30. And the absence of such trials does not render them “experimental.” Id. ¶¶ \n14, 17, 23-30. In fact, such trials would be unethical because insufficient \nparticipants are likely to enroll, and investigators and participants cannot be \n“blind” since they would know if they were receiving the active treatment or a \nplacebo due to changes in their bodies or the absence thereof. Id. ¶¶ 30-31. The \nlack of randomized trials is common for pediatrics. Id. ¶¶ 31-32. Relevant here, \nthere is the same absence of randomized trials supporting the use of puberty \nblockers to treat precocious puberty (the premature initiation of puberty), id. ¶ 31, \na practice Alabama law continues to permit. There is no medical or research basis \nfor distinguishing the use of puberty blockers to treat precocious puberty from \nusing them to treat gender dysphoria. Id. ¶¶ 3, 47. \nLikewise, lack of FDA approval for a specific use does not bear on a \ntreatment’s efficacy. FDA approval is not required for all uses of a medication and \noff-label use is in fact common in many areas of medicine, including pediatrics. Id. \n¶¶ 20, 22. Once the FDA has approved a medication for one indication, thereby \nagreeing that it is safe (i.e., its benefits outweigh its potential risks) and effective \nfor this intended use, prescribers are generally free to prescribe it for other \n22 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 62-1   Filed 04/29/22   Page 33 of 40\nindications. Id. ¶ 21. For example, nafcillin, an antibiotic commonly used to treat \nlung or joint infections, lacks a pediatric indication. Id. ¶ 22. There are many \nreasons, wholly unrelated to a drug’s safety or efficacy why its manufacturer might \nnot seek FDA approval for an additional use or patient group; it may already be \napproved for adults but not for minors even though studies indicate it is safe when \nused by both groups. Id. ¶¶ 20 & n.2, 21.   \nThird, parents and many minors are able to comprehend the risks involved. \nS.B. 184’s legislative findings assert that minors and their parents “are unable to \ncomprehend and fully appreciate the risk and life implications” of the treatments \nbanned by Section 4. S.B. 184 § 2(15). This is incorrect. Antommaria Decl. ¶ 39. \nTo begin, parental consent is required before providing gender-affirming care to \nminors, as it is before medical providers render treatments with comparable risks, \nuncertainty, and levels of evidence. Id. ¶ 40. For example, the evidence indicates \nthat most adolescents with gender dysphoria “have sufficient medical decision-\nmaking capacity to make decisions regarding puberty blockers.” Id. ¶ 41. And \nminors must be informed about all potential effects, including implications for \nfertility and options for fertility preservation, as a predicate step. Id. ¶ 42. \nMoreover, S.B. 184 operates under the faulty presumption that parents, in \nconsultation with their medical providers, cannot make reasoned, informed \ndecisions about appropriate care for their children. In fact, parents “are frequently \n23 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 62-1   Filed 04/29/22   Page 34 of 40\nasked to consent to medical treatments for minors with comparable risks, \nuncertainty, and levels of evidence.” Id. ¶¶ 40, 47. S.B. 184’s legislative findings \noffer no compelling reason why parents would be unable to do so only when these \ntreatments are being provided to transgender youths. \nBecause the medical evidence demonstrates that S.B. 184’s prohibition on \ntransgender youth who experience gender dysphoria receiving the specified forms \nof care when their physicians and parents agree that such care is appropriate simply \ndoes not substantially achieve the interest of protecting children, the statute \nviolates the Equal Protection Clause. See Feenstra, 609 F.2d at 734. \n3.  S.B. 184’s Ban on Gender-Affirming Care Fails Even Rational \nBasis Review \nEven if this Court were to apply only rational-basis review, S.B. 184’s ban \non gender-affirming medical care could not survive. The ban lacks even a “rational \nrelationship between the disparity of treatment and some legitimate governmental \npurpose.” Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 320 (1993). By requiring that the \n“classification bear a rational relationship to an independent and legitimate \nlegislative end,” courts ensure that “classifications are not drawn for the purpose of \ndisadvantaging the group burdened by the law.” Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, \n633 (1996). \nAs explained above, see pp. 18-19, supra, S.B. 184 in fact reflects a desire to \nexpress moral disapproval of transgender status. Given the law’s targeting of \n24 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 62-1   Filed 04/29/22   Page 35 of 40\ntransgender minors, its passage indeed “seems inexplicable by anything but animus \ntoward” transgender people. See id. S.B. 184 is “a status-based enactment divorced \nfrom any factual context from which we could discern a relationship to legitimate \nstate interests . . . .” Romer, 517 U.S. at 635. “[I]f the constitutional conception of \n‘equal protection of the laws’ means anything, it must at the very least mean” that \nthe desire to express moral disapproval of “a politically unpopular group cannot \nconstitute a legitimate governmental interest.” Moreno, 413 U.S. at 534. S.B. 184 \nis motivated by prejudice toward a particular group, transgender individuals, \nbearing no rational relationship to the law’s stated purpose and thus cannot survive \neven the lowest level of review. See Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 450. \nThus, the United States is likely to succeed on the merits of its equal \nprotection claim regardless of the level of scrutiny applied.  \nII.  S.B. 184 Will Cause Irreparable Harm Absent an Injunction \nIf Section 4 of S.B. 184 is permitted to go into effect, the provision of \ncertain types of medically necessary gender-affirming care to transgender minors \nwill constitute a felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to \n$15,000. S.B. 184 § 4(c); see also Ala. Crim. Code §§ 13-A-5-6(a)(3), 13A-5-\n11(a)(3). Courts have repeatedly recognized that the risk of criminal penalties \nconstitutes an immediate and irreparable harm. See, e.g., Georgia Latino All. for \nHum. Rts. v. Deal, 793 F. Supp. 2d 1317, 1340 (N.D. Ga. 2011), aff’d in relevant \n25 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 62-1   Filed 04/29/22   Page 36 of 40\npart, Georgia Latino All. for Hum. Rts. v. Governor of Georgia, 691 F.3d 1250 \n(11th Cir. 2012); Planned Parenthood Southeast, Inc. v. Bentley, 951 F. Supp. 2d \n1280, 1288-89 (N.D. Ala. 2013); Cent. Alabama Fair Hous. Ctr. v. Magee, No. \n2:11-cv-982-MHT, 2011 WL 5878363, at *3 (M.D. Ala. Nov. 23, 2011).  \nThat is especially true given the court of action S.B. 184 compels individuals \nto forgo. S.B. 184 will cause immense and irreparable physical and psychological \nharm to many transgender minors by terminating their access to necessary medical \ntreatment and impose severe harm on their parents and medical providers. See \nAntommaria Decl. ¶ 47; Hawkins Decl. ¶¶ 45-47; Rosenthal Decl. ¶¶ 56-57. As \none district court explained, the following forms of irreparable harm can ensue: (1) \ntransgender youths face “high risk of gender dysphoria and lifelong physical and \nemotional pain,” (2) parents must choose between watching their children suffer or \nuprooting their familiar to move to another state, and (3) physicians must choose \nbetween breaking the law and providing appropriate medical care. Brandt v. \nRutledge, 551 F. Supp. 3d 882, 892 (E.D. Ark. 2021); see also Blaine v. North \nBrevard County Hospital District, 312 F. Supp. 3d 1295, 1306 (M.D. Fla. 2018).22 \n \n22 The Supreme Court and other courts have held that irreparable harm results from the \nenforcement of a state law that violates the Constitution. See New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc. v. \nCouncil of City of New Orleans, 491 U.S. 350, 366-67 (1989) (assuming that irreparable injury \nmay be established “by a showing that the challenged state statute is flagrantly and patently \nviolative of . . . the express constitutional prescription of the Supremacy Clause”) (citation and \ninternal quotation marks omitted); United States v. Arizona, 641 F.3d 339, 366 (9th Cir. 2011) \n(“We have ‘stated that an alleged constitutional infringement will often alone constitute \n \n26 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 62-1   Filed 04/29/22   Page 37 of 40\nIII.  The Balance of the Equities and the Public Interest Both Weigh in the \nUnited States’ Favor \n \nThe final two factors governing the issuance of preliminary relief—the \nbalance of equities and the public interest—merge where the federal government is \na party. Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009); see also Pursuing Am.’s \nGreatness v. Fed. Election Comm’n, 831 F.3d 500, 511 (D.C. Cir. 2016) \n(Government’s “harm and the public interest are one and the same, because the \ngovernment’s interest is the public interest”). Here, these factors manifestly favor \nthe United States. The United States has a strong and legitimate interest in ensuring \nthat states respect their obligations under the Constitution, and in fulfilling the \nUnited States’ responsibilities under Federal law.23 If this Court does not grant \npreliminary relief, the lives of many transgender youth in Alabama and their \nfamilies will be upended while the court continues to evaluate the lawfulness of \nS.B. 184 during the pendency of the litigation. See Planned Parenthood Southeast, \nInc., 951 F. Supp. 2d at 1290. \nBy contrast, Alabama will suffer no harm if the preliminary relief sought by \nthe United States is granted; as discussed above, S.B. 184 fails to protect the health \nof minors notwithstanding its purported motivations. See pp. 19-20, supra. \n \nirreparable harm.’”); see also City of El Cenizo v. Texas, 264 F. Supp. 3d 744, 809 (W.D. Tex. \n2017).  \n23 See Letter from Kristen Clarke, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, U.S. Dep’t of \nJustice, to State Attorneys General (March 31, 2022), https://go.usa.gov/xuR8w. \n27 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 62-1   Filed 04/29/22   Page 38 of 40\nMoreover, because the United States has demonstrated that it is likely to prevail on \nthe merits, an injunction preventing the enforcement of the unconstitutional \nlegislation poses no harm. Alabama, 691 F.3d at 1301 (“Frustration of federal \nstatutes and prerogatives are not in the public interest, and we discern no harm \nfrom the state’s nonenforcement of invalid legislation.”); KH Outdoor, LLC v. City \nof Trussville, 458 F.3d 1261, 1271-72 (11th Cir. 2006) (“the city has no legitimate \ninterest in enforcing an unconstitutional ordinance.”). In sum, the balance of the \nequities and the public interest weigh in the United States’ favor.  \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant the United States’ motion \nfor a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction. \nDated: April 29, 2022      Respectfully submitted,        \n \nSANDRA J.

Indeed, at many facilities, hormones are provided on demand to \nchildren who merely identify as transgender, with no requirement that threshold diagnostic crite-\nria for “Gender Dysphoria” be satisfied or that a psychological assessment be completed.  Ala-\nbama’s legislation is a commonsense response to that troubling surge in unnecessary interven-\ntion. \nNor is Alabama alone in recognizing the danger posed by this unregulated industry and \nthe rush toward life-altering intervention.  To the contrary, systematic reviews from multiple Eu-\nropean nations—where similar interventions have been studied—have shocked those nations’ \nmedical professionals and led to greater restrictions on the kind of intervention that Plaintiffs ar-\ngue should be unregulated.  Yet Plaintiffs and their allies simply ignore those facts.  Instead, they \nfraudulently trot out debunked claims that chemical and surgical interventions lower suicide rates \nand lead to better overall health outcomes.  But that is hardly surprising given that Plaintiffs and \ntheir allies are more concerned with politics than making an objective assessment of what is best \nfor Alabama’s vulnerable young people.   \nTherefore, it is no wonder that States like Alabama have been forced to step in to protect \nvulnerable kids from the practitioners who would subject them to dangerous, life-altering proce-\ndures.  The Amici States submit this brief in hearty support of Alabama’s right to exercise its his-\ntoric power to do that here. \n \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 72   Filed 05/02/22   Page 5 of 25\nARGUMENT \nI.  Plaintiffs shockingly pretend the boiling international controversy doesn’t exist, \neven as it continuously spills out into the news media. \nThere is a raging controversy in the international medical community concerning the \nsafety and effectiveness of using pharmaceutical products and surgeries to address gender-related \npsychological issues in still-maturing adolescents.  But one would never guess that from Plain-\ntiffs’ briefing.  It is as if they are urging a crowd of concerned spectators, “Move on!  Nothing to \nsee here!” against a background of spectacular explosions and pyrotechnics.  It would be humor-\nous except that the consequences of diminishing the devastating, lifelong harms to children are \nshockingly serious. \nThis intensely boiling medical controversy is continuously spilling out into the news me-\ndia.  On May 13, 2021, for example, The Economist published an article titled, “Doubts Are \nGrowing about Therapy for Gender-dysphoric Children.”1  Reporting that “[d]rug treatments \nseem to do little good, and may be harmful,” the weekly newsmagazine explained that: \nLast June, . . . Finland revised its guidelines to prefer psychological treatment to \ndrugs.  In September Britain launched a top-down review of the field.  In December \nthe High Court of England and Wales ruled that under-16s were unlikely to be able \nto consent meaningfully to taking puberty blockers, leading [the gender clinic] to \nsuspend new referrals, though a subsequent ruling held that parents could consent \non their children's behalf.  On April 6th Arkansas passed laws that make prescribing \npuberty blockers and cross-sex hormones to children illegal.  Also in April the \nAstrid Lindgren Children's Hospital in Stockholm, a part of the Karolinska Insti-\ntute, announced that it would stop prescribing puberty blockers and cross-sex hor-\nmones to those under 18, except in clinical trials. \n \n1 Doubts are Growing About Therapy for Gender-dysphoric Children, The Economist (May \n15, 2021), https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2021/05/13/doubts-are-growing-\nabout-therapy-for-gender-dysphoric-children. \n \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 72   Filed 05/02/22   Page 6 of 25\nThe New York Times recently covered the controversy in an article titled, “Doctors De-\nbate Whether Trans Teens Need Therapy Before Hormones.”2  Discussing new draft guidelines \nfrom the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), the Times explains \nthat “experts in transgender health are divided on these adolescent recommendations, reflecting a \nfraught debate over how to weigh conflicting risks for young people, who typically can’t give \nfull legal consent until they are 18 and who may be in emotional distress or more vulnerable to \npeer influence than adults are.”3 \nIndeed, we’ve reached the tipping point where even clinicians at the center of efforts to \nprovide pharmaceutical and surgical treatments for gender-related psychiatric issues have begun \nsounding the alarm.4  Medscape reports that child and adolescent psychiatrist Angela Sämfjord, \nMD, who started the Lundstrom Gender Clinic in Sweden resigned “because of her own fears \nabout the lack of evidence for hormonal and surgical treatments.”5  Further, “many of the staff at \nUK GIDS have now left that service,” including Sue Evans, “a psychotherapist who resigned \nfrom GIDS because she felt ‘deeply concerned’ about the fast-tracking of young people into \nmedical treatment.”6 \n \n2 A.

They highlighted clinician re-\nports of “the rising numbers of detransitioners” who regret receiving pharmaceutical and surgical \ntreatments as adolescents.8  They note the absence of “[l]onger-term longitudinal studies [that] \nare needed to better understand the role of medical interventions on lifetime psychological \nhealth . . . .

Eating disorders, multiple personality disorders and repressed \nmemory syndrome have in retrospect spread through subgroups of adolescents and the profes-\nsionals who have treated them.”  She continues: “This spread is like wildfire through vulnerable \nunderbrush, clearly borne in an environment of contagion.  Why is this phenomenon distinctly \ndifferent than previous ones?”12  It’s not. \nCBS News’s Lesley Stahl covered the growing phenomenon of detransitioner regret in a \nhigh-profile 60 Minutes episode.13  Other reports highlight a recent study of one hundred detran-\nsitioners who informed researchers of discoveries that their gender dysphoria was caused by un-\nderlying trauma, abuse, or a mental-health condition for which they did not receive adequate psy-\nchiatric treatment.14  A woman named Carol who took testosterone and transitioned to living as a \nman, for example, discovered to her dismay that “I needed the antidepressants; I didn’t need to \ntransition.”15   \nMedicalizing adolescents’ gender-related psychological issues invests these young people \nin a treatment pathway that leads to more consequential interventions over time, resulting in even \ngreater losses.

Plaintiffs and their allies are motivated by politics, not an objective assessment of \nwhat is best for vulnerable young people. \nPlaintiffs rely on a purported “consensus” of statements published by American profes-\nsional and advocacy organizations, including the American Medical Association (AMA).  But \nthese organizations are demonstrably motivated by politics, not science or the best interests of \nyoung people.  In an April 26, 2021 letter to the National Governors Association (NGA), for ex-\nample, the AMA wrote to urge the NGA to “oppose state legislation that would prohibit the pro-\nvision of . . . gender transition-related care to minor patients.”27  But this statement is flatly in-\nconsistent with the position the AMA has taken concerning adolescents’ abilities in contexts \n \n24 Lisa Selin Davis, Yes, Kids are Getting Gender Surgeries, Broadview with Lisa Selin Da-\nvis (April 19, 2022); see Dr. Sidhbh Gallagher, TikTok, https://www.tiktok.com/@gendersur-\ngeon?lang=en. \n25 Ross Douthat, How to Make Sense of the New L.G.B.T.Q.

For example, in 2005, the AMA and other amici \nwaded into a case before the U.S. Supreme Court concerning capital punishment for crimes com-\nmitted by minors.  Br. of the Am. Med. Ass’n, Am. Psychiatric Ass’n, et al., Roper v. Simmons, \n543 U.S. 551 (2005), (No. 03-633), 2004 WL 1633549.  The organizations asserted there that \n“[a]dolescents’ behavioral immaturity mirrors the anatomical immaturity of their brains.  To a \ndegree never before understood, scientists can now demonstrate that adolescents are immature \nnot only to the observer’s naked eye, but in the very fibers of their brains.”  Id. at 10.  “[T]he re-\ngions of the brain associated with impulse control, risk assessment, and moral reasoning develop \nlast, after late adolescence.”  Id. at 11. \nIn a 2012 brief similarly concerning mandatory life sentencing for minors, the American \nPsychological Association and other amici recognized that minors are “less capable of mature \njudgment than adults” and “more vulnerable to negative external influences.”  Br. for the Am. \nPsych. Ass’n, Am. Psychiatric Ass’n, and Nat’l Ass’n of Social Workers (“APA Br.”), Miller v. \nAlabama, 567 U.S. 460 (2012) (Nos. 10-9646, 10-9647), 2012 WL 174239, at 7, 15.  “Sound \njudgment requires both cognitive and psychosocial skills” that minors lack because “the brain \ncontinues to develop throughout adolescence and young adulthood in precisely the areas and sys-\ntems that are regarded as most involved in impulse control, planning, and self-regulation.”  Id. at \n10, 14. \nPlaintiffs’ allies have recognized that adolescents use a “risk-reward calculus” that under-\nvalues risks, id. at 10, and “overvalue[s] short-term benefits and rewards.”  Br. for the Am. Med. \nAss’n and the Am. Acad. Of Child and Adol.

Further, “adolescents have less life experience on which to draw, making it less \nlikely that they will fully apprehend the potential negative consequences of their actions.”  Id.  \n“In short,” the amici concluded, “the average adolescent cannot be expected to act with the same \ncontrol or foresight as a mature adult.”  Miller AMA Br. at 3. \nWhen it comes to criminal activity, Plaintiffs’ allies have no problem recognizing that \nminors struggled to navigate peer pressure, weigh costs and benefits of life-altering decisions, or \nmake clear-headed judgments about their adult lives.  But when it comes to adolescents’ deci-\nsions concerning dangerous and life-altering gender-related therapies, those concerns become \npolitically inconvenient and are swept under the rug. \nIf more evidence were needed, the activities of the AMA further illustrate that politics, \nnot science, often dictate the positions these professional organizations take on controversial is-\nsues.  Among the largest spenders on political lobbying in the United States over the past two \ndecades, the AMA takes fourth place.28  The organization’s efforts to influence policy have been \nlinked historically to its financial connections to pharmaceutical and even tobacco manufactur-\ners.29  Further, as the organization’s membership has recently skewed “younger and less con-\nservative,” the AMA has leaned into the culture wars.

States like Alabama have a “compelling interest in \nprotecting the physical and psychological well-being of minors.”  Reno v. Am. C.L. Union, 521 \nU.S. 844, 869 (1997) (quoting Sable Commc’ns of Cal., Inc. v. F.C.C., 492 U.S. 115, 126 \n(1989)).  Legislating to protect these young people is especially justified given both their “pecu-\nliar vulnerability” and “their inability to make critical decisions in an informed, mature manner.”  \nBellotti v. Baird, 443 U.S. 622, 634 (1979).  This compelling interest in protecting young people \nis independent of, but overlaps with, Alabama’s important interest deriving from the State’s “sig-\nnificant role” in “regulating the medical profession.”  Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124, 157 \n(2007). \nIndeed, where, as here, “there is medical and scientific uncertainty,” the Court has \nproperly given States—not practitioners or professional and advocacy organizations—“wide dis-\ncretion” to regulate the practice of medicine.

Contemporary best practices and multiple systematic reviews of the evidence con-\ntradict Plaintiffs’ claims. \nDespite the raging international controversy over the known and unknown dangers of \ngiving teens cross-sex hormones and performing life-altering surgical procedures on them, Plain-\ntiffs and their allies urge that there is, simply, “Nothing to see here!”  We have been here before:  \nNot many years ago, “pain management” was advocated as a “fundamental human right,” with \nsome physicians dismissing as “opioidphobic” other physicians’ concern that “raising pain treat-\nment to a ‘patient’s rights’ issue could lead to overreliance on opioids.”37  Experts created new \nconsensus-based standards and assured doctors that prescribing more opioids was largely risk \nfree.  “However, no large national studies were conducted to examine whether the standards im-\nproved pain assessment or control.”38  The U.S. opioid epidemic, with its continuing fallout for \nmillions of shattered lives, was the tragic result.39 \n \n37 David W.

Certainly, there was a time—four decades ago—when \nrecommending medical treatment based on mere consensus was considered a best practice.  But \n“[i]n the 1990s, the rise of evidence-based medicine cast doubt on the reliability of expert con-\nsensus.  Since then, medicine has increasingly relied on systematic reviews, as developed by the \nevidence-based medicine movement.”40  And the systematic reviews show that Plaintiffs’ claims \nof safety and effectiveness (to say nothing of “medical necessity”) is unsupported by the scien-\ntific literature:41 \n•  The Endocrine Society commissioned two systematic reviews for its 2017 guidelines and \nevaluated evidence quality using the GRADE system.42  Relying on the single Dutch \nstudy discussed above, it recognized that there is only “very low-quality” or, at best, “low \nquality” evidence supporting the use either of puberty blockers or cross-sex hormones.43  \nAs a result, the guidelines could only “suggest”—not “recommend”—using puberty \nblockers, indicating skepticism concerning whether those “who receive [them] . . . derive, \non average, more benefit than harm.”44   \n \n40 K.

Further, the review noted that there is a “lack of an agreed \nconsensus” whether gender-related distress calls for medical intervention “or whether it may be a \nmanifestation of other causes of distress.”  Id. \n55 Also of note is that in February 2022, the National Academy of Medicine, France, simi-\nlarly adopted a statement advising “great medical caution must be taken in children and adoles-\n \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 72   Filed 05/02/22   Page 19 of 25\nSince the 1990s, it has been recognized that actual evidence is what matters.  If Plaintiffs’ \npurported consensus of statements by American professional and advocacy organizations (where \nnot evidence but political forces hold sway) conflicts with multiple independent and objective \nreviews of the evidence, then so much the worse for that wayward consensus.  Because the use \nof pharmaceuticals and surgeries to address adolescents’ gender-related psychological issues is \nnot evidence-based, practitioners lack a proper basis for believing that they will provide these \nyoung people more benefit than harm.  And that is precisely where the State of Alabama’s im-\nportant—even compelling—interests in protecting children and regulating the practice of medi-\ncine becomes all-important. \nIV.  Plaintiffs wrongly invoke the specter of suicide. \nPlaintiffs repeatedly invoke the specter of suicide, claiming that medical procedures to \nchange teenagers’ bodies are the only way to address the tragically high rate of suicide among \nthose who identify as transgender.  But there is no good evidence for those claims.  Instead, inso-\nfar as the procedures affect patients’ suicide rates, the evidence is mounting that the procedures \nat issue here actually increase suicide risks.  The best data come from a follow-up study of a \ngroup who had completely transitioned, including surgically.  This study demonstrated that the \nrisk of completed suicide increased significantly after full transition.56 \n \ncents, given the vulnerability, particularly psychological, of this population and the many unde-\nsirable effects and even serious complications that can be caused by some of the therapies availa-\nble.”  Medical Care of Children and Adolescents with Transgender Identity, National Academy \nof Medicine, France (February 28, 2022), translated into English by the Society for Evidence-\nbased Gender Medicine (March 2, 2022), https://segm.org/sites/default/files/English%20Transla-\ntion_22.2.25-Communique-PCRA-19-Medecine-et-transidentite-genre.pdf.  It further warned of \n“the addictive role of excessive engagement with social media, which is . . . responsible for a \nvery significant part of the growing sense of gender incongruence.”  Id. \n56 See Cecilia Dhejne, et al., Long-Term Follow-Up of Transsexual Persons Undergoing Sex \nReassignment Surgery: Cohort Study in Sweden, 6 PLoS ONE (February 2011), at 1, 7 (“This \nstudy found substantially higher rates of overall mortality, death from cardiovascular disease and \n \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 72   Filed 05/02/22   Page 20 of 25\nIn an effort to rectify the complete absence of evidence in support of these procedures, \ntwo researchers, Richard Bränström and John E. Pachankis, published the first long-term treat-\nment-outcome study in the American Journal of Psychiatry.57  The authors presented their data \nas supporting claims that the procedures improve long-term mental-health outcomes.58  But the \ndata were not as the authors had presented them.  The study’s methodological blunders prompted \nmultiple devastating letters from prominent researchers to the editor of the American Journal of \nPsychiatry that highlighted its shortcomings.  Besides coding errors that excluded lithium and \nother antipsychotic medications from (but included antihistamines in) the category of treatments \nfor mood disorders,59 the study excluded cases in which the subjects actually committed suicide, \nattempted suicide without being hospitalized, had health care visits for other psychological is-\nsues, and more.60  Letters noted that the data in fact showed “a spike in suicide attempts” in the \nyear after surgery.61  Another explained that “the data also could be interpreted as showing that \n \nsuicide, suicide attempts, and psychiatric hospitalisations in sex-reassigned transsexual individu-\nals compared to a healthy control population.”). \n57 Richard Bränström and John E.

Plaintiffs \ncan close their eyes and plug their ears to the reality of what is plainly recognized by physicians \nand researchers in Sweden, Finland, the United Kingdom, and France; by many here in the \nUnited States; and by the news media.  But the State of Alabama, with its responsibility to pro-\ntect its young people, cannot ignore the truth.  It must take action to protect kids from the practi-\ntioners who would foist these harmful procedures upon them with the empty promise of whole-\nness and wellbeing.  Indeed, by enacting the Alabama Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protec-\ntion Act, it has done precisely that.  For these reasons, the Amici States respectfully ask that the \nCourt deny Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.       \n             May 2, 2022   \nRespectfully Submitted, \n     \n            \n/s/ Mark D.

This lawsuit challenges a state statute that denies necessary medical \ncare to children based solely on who they are.  \n2.  All people, including transgender youth, deserve to be treated with \ndignity and respect. And the Fourteenth Amendment demands that Alabama not \n“deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” U.S. \nConst. amend. XIV.  \n3.  The United States accordingly files this complaint in intervention to \nenforce the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection, and to challenge Section 4 \nof Act No. 2022-289, Senate Bill (“S.B.”) 184 (2022), the “Alabama Vulnerable \nChild Compassion and Protection Act.”  \n4.  S.B. 184 criminalizes certain forms of medically necessary care for \ntransgender minors. Specifically, S.B. 184 makes it a felony to “engage in or \ncause” specified types of medical care for minors, if performed for “the purpose of \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 92   Filed 05/04/22   Page 3 of 15\nattempting to alter the appearance of or affirm the minor’s perception of his or her \ngender or sex, if that appearance or perception is inconsistent” with sex assigned at \nbirth.  \n5.  S.B. 184 thus allows a minor to receive certain medical procedures or \ntreatment only if they will be used to affirm the sex that the minor was assigned at \nbirth.  \n6.  The law discriminates against transgender minors by unjustifiably \ndenying them access to certain forms of medically necessary care. \n7.  While criminalizing certain forms of medically necessary gender-\naffirming care for transgender minors, S.B. 184 permits all other minors to access \nthe same procedures and treatments. \n8.  As a result of S.B. 184, medical professionals, parents, and minors old \nenough to make their own medical decisions are forced to choose between \nforgoing medically necessary procedures and treatments or facing criminal \nprosecution. \n9.  S.B. 184’s felony ban on various forms of medically necessary \ngender-affirming care for transgender minors discriminates on the basis of both sex \nand transgender status in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 92   Filed 05/04/22   Page 4 of 15\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n10.

Transgender people are individuals whose gender identity does not \nconform with the sex they were assigned at birth. \n23.  The American Psychiatric Association has stated “[b]eing transgender \nor gender diverse implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or \ngeneral social or vocational capabilities.” \nA.  Standard of Care for Treating Transgender Youth \n24.  According to the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic & \nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders (“DSM-V”), an authoritative source for \npsychiatric conditions, “Gender Dysphoria” is the diagnostic term for the condition \nexperienced by some transgender people of clinically significant distress resulting \nfrom the lack of congruence between their gender identity and the sex assigned to \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 92   Filed 05/04/22   Page 6 of 15\nthem at birth.  \n25.  As the DSM-V explains, to be diagnosed with gender dysphoria, the \nindividual must experience the incongruence for at least six months and experience \nclinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other \nimportant areas of functioning. \n26.  The American Psychiatric Association recognizes that not all \ntransgender persons have gender dysphoria. A diagnosis of gender dysphoria is \ncurrently required in order to receive many forms of gender-affirming care, \nincluding hormone therapy and surgery.  \n27.  The DSM-V notes that medical treatment for gender dysphoria \naddresses the clinically significant distress created by gender dysphoria by helping \npeople who are transgender live in alignment with their gender identity.  \n28.  The precise treatment for gender dysphoria depends on each person’s \nindividual needs. According to clinical guidelines from the World Professional \nAssociation for Transgender Health (“WPATH”), the number and type of \ninterventions to treat gender dysphoria may differ from person to person. The \nmedical standards of care differ depending on whether the treatment is for a pre-\npubertal child, an adolescent (i.e., minors who have entered puberty), or an adult. \n29.  The American Academy of Pediatrics agrees that gender-affirming \ncare is safe, effective, and medically necessary treatment for the health and \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 92   Filed 05/04/22   Page 7 of 15\nwellbeing of some children and adolescents suffering from gender dysphoria. \n30.  Before puberty, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends \ntreatment for gender dysphoria that does not include any pharmaceutical or \nsurgical intervention and is limited to “social transition,” which means allowing a \ntransgender child to live and express themselves in ways consistent with their \ngender identity.  \n31.  As transgender youth reach puberty, puberty delaying therapy may \nbecome medically necessary and appropriate for some minors according to the \nEndocrine Society’s clinical practice guidelines. \n32.  According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, gender dysphoria \nmay emerge or worsen with the onset of puberty. For many transgender \nadolescents, going through puberty in accordance with the sex assigned to them at \nbirth, can cause extreme distress.  \n33.  According to WPATH, refusing timely and necessary medical \ninterventions for adolescents may prolong gender dysphoria and lead to an \nappearance that provokes abuse and stigmatization; such gender-related abuse is in \nturn associated with psychiatric distress. \n34.  The Endocrine Society’s clinical guidelines recognize that puberty \ndelaying hormone treatment (also referred to as puberty blockers or puberty \nsuppressing treatment) allows transgender youth to avoid experiencing heightened \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 92   Filed 05/04/22   Page 8 of 15\ngender dysphoria and permanent physical changes that puberty would cause. \nBefore providing such therapy, pediatric endocrinologists work in close \nconsultation with qualified mental health professionals experienced in diagnosing \nand treating gender dysphoria. \n35.  Under the Endocrine Society’s clinical guidelines, transgender \nadolescents may be eligible for puberty-blocking hormone therapy only if the \nfollowing steps have been taken: \n•  A qualified mental health professional confirms the adolescent has \ndemonstrated a long-lasting and intense pattern of gender nonconformity \nor gender dysphoria, gender dysphoria worsened with the onset of \npuberty, and any coexisting psychological, medical, or social problems \nthat could interfere with treatment have been addressed, such that the \nadolescent’s situation and functioning are stable enough to start \ntreatment; \n \n•  The adolescent has sufficient mental capacity to give informed consent to \nthis treatment, has been informed of the effects and side effects of \ntreatment (including potential loss of fertility) and options to preserve \nfertility; and has given informed consent and the parents or other \ncaretakers or guardians have consented to the treatment and are involved \nin supporting the adolescent throughout the treatment process; and \n \n•  A pediatric endocrinologist or other clinician experienced in pubertal \nassessment agrees with the indication for treatment, has confirmed that \npuberty has started in the adolescent, and has confirmed that there are no \nmedical contraindications to treatment. \n \n36.  According to WPATH, during puberty suppression, an adolescent’s \nphysical development should be carefully monitored, preferably by a pediatric \nendocrinologist, so that any necessary interventions can occur.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 92   Filed 05/04/22   Page 9 of 15\n37.  WPATH also recognizes that for some transgender adolescents, it may \nbe medically necessary and appropriate to provide hormone therapy to initiate \npuberty consistent with gender identity.  \n38.  Under WPATH’s clinical guidelines, adolescents who are transgender \nmay receive medically necessary chest reconstructive surgeries prior to the age of \nmajority if they have severe gender dysphoria, provided they have been living \nconsistent with their gender identity for a significant period of time.  \n39.  According to WPATH, while some transgender individuals find \ncomfort with their gender identity without surgery, for others surgery is essential \nand medically necessary to alleviate gender dysphoria. Surgery is often the last and \nmost considered step in treatment for gender dysphoria. \nB.  Senate Bill 184 \n  1.  Bill Text \n40.  S.B. 184 was signed into law by Governor Kay Ivey on April 8, 2022. \nThe law will become effective on May 8, 2022.  \n41.  Section 2 of the bill includes various legislative findings suggesting \nthat sex is an immutable characteristic that cannot be changed. The findings reject \nthe need for interventions to treat gender dysphoria, describing such treatments as \n“unproven” and “experimental” and causing “numerous harmful effects.” The \nfindings characterize a “discordance between sex and identity” as a state that \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 92   Filed 05/04/22   Page 10 of 15\nresolves itself over time in most cases.  \n42.  Section 3 of the bill defines “sex” as the “biological state of being \nmale or female, based on the individual’s sex organs, chromosomes, and \nendogenous hormone profiles.”  \n43.  Section 4 of the bill identifies a set of medical practices, including \nadministering puberty blockers, administering hormone therapy, and surgical \ninterventions (including the removal of “any healthy or non-diseased body part or \ntissue, except for a male circumcision”). It further provides that “no person shall \nengage in or cause any of” these practices to be performed on a minor for “the \npurpose of attempting to alter the appearance of or affirm the minor’s perception of \nhis or her gender or sex, if that appearance or perception is inconsistent” with sex \nassigned at birth.  \n44.  Section 4 contains an exception for procedures “undertaken to treat a \nminor born with a medically verifiable disorder of sex development.”  \n45.  By its terms, the prohibition in S.B. 184 necessarily implicates parents \nof transgender minors as well as health care providers and other medical \nprofessionals. And because S.B. 184 prohibits any person from causing the \nprohibited treatment, a transgender minor may face prosecution for seeking out \ntheir own medically necessary care. See Ala. Code § 22-8-4 (“Any minor who is \n14 years of age or older, or has graduated from high school, or is married, or \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 92   Filed 05/04/22   Page 11 of 15\nhaving been married is divorced or is pregnant may give effective consent to any \nlegally authorized medical, dental, health or mental health services for himself or \nherself, and the consent of no other person shall be necessary.”).  \n46.  Violation of Section 4 of S.B. 184 is a Class C felony, which is \npunishable by up to 10 years of imprisonment and a fine of up to $15,000. See Ala. \nCrim. Code §§ 13-A-5-6(a)(3), 13A-5-11(a)(3). \n2.  Impact of S.B. 184  \n47.  S.B. 184’s felony ban on various forms of gender-affirming care \nprohibits transgender minors from accessing certain medical procedures or \ntreatment if they will be used to affirm a gender identity inconsistent with the sex \nassigned at birth. \n48.  The law discriminates against transgender minors by unjustifiably \ndenying them access to certain forms of medically necessary care. S.B. 184 \nprohibits transgender minors from obtaining care that is well recognized within the \nmedical community as medically appropriate and necessary, while imposing no \ncomparable limitation on medically necessary care by cisgender minors. \n49.  In addition, the law allows children to access the exact same medical \nprocedures or treatment if they will be used to reinforce the gender they were \nassigned at birth.  \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 92   Filed 05/04/22   Page 12 of 15\n50.  With respect to medical care, S.B. 184 permits a doctor, for example, \nto prescribe testosterone for a cisgender male minor suffering from delayed \npubertal development or a condition such as hypogonadism, but the law makes it a \nfelony for the same doctor to prescribe the same testosterone to a transgender male \nyouth to affirm his gender identity.  \n51.  With respect to surgical procedures, for example, the law permits a \ncisgender girl to undergo a voluntary non-cancer related breast augmentation \nprocedure to make her feel more accepting of her body, but forbids a transgender \ngirl from receiving the same procedure even when recommended as medically \nappropriate by her physician. The law also permits a cisgender boy with \ngynecomastia to have excess breast tissue surgically removed to give him a more \n“male” physique, but does not permit a transgender boy to obtain the same \ntreatment.  \n52.  In other words, the sex a minor was assigned at birth determines the \nlegality and availability of medically necessary treatments. \n53.  In restricting who may receive medically prescribed care based on the \nindividual’s sex assigned at birth, S.B. 184 threatens health care providers with \ncriminal sanctions for exercising their independent medical judgment and expertise \nand threatens parents and others with criminal sanctions for acting on their \njudgment of what is in their child’s best interest. \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 92   Filed 05/04/22   Page 13 of 15\n54.  Further, the law prevents transgender minors from accessing gender-\naffirming care that is widely recognized within the medical community as the only \neffective treatment for some individuals diagnosed with gender dysphoria. S.B. \n184 prevents healthcare providers from considering the recognized standard of care \nfor gender dysphoria and from providing medically necessary gender-affirming \ncare for improving the physical and mental health of their patients. \nCAUSE OF ACTION \nCOUNT ONE \nViolation of Equal Protection \nU.S. Constitution, Amendment XIV \nPlaintiff-Intervenor United States against All Defendants \n \n55.  The United States re-alleges and re-pleads all the allegations of the \npreceding  and  subsequent  paragraphs  of  this  Complaint  and  incorporates  them \nherein by reference. \n56.  The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution prohibits state and local governments from denying to any person \nwithin their jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.  \n57.  Section 4 of S.B. 184 discriminates both on the basis of sex and on the \nbasis of transgender status, each in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. \n58.  Under the Equal Protection Clause, government classifications based \non  sex  or  on  transgender  status  are  subject  to  heightened  scrutiny  and  are \npresumptively unconstitutional.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 92   Filed 05/04/22   Page 14 of 15\n59.  Section 4 of S.B. 184 cannot survive heightened scrutiny because it is \nnot substantially related to achieving Alabama’s articulated important governmental \ninterests. \n60.  In the alternative, Section 4 of the statute could not survive any level of \nscrutiny because it is not rationally related to a legitimate government interest.  \n61.  The above conduct of Defendants has been taken under color of state \nand local law.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, the United States respectfully requests that this Court: \na.  Enter a judgment declaring that Section 4 of S.B. 184 violates the \nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution; \nb.  Temporarily restrain, and issue a preliminary and permanent \ninjunction restraining, Defendants from enforcing Section 4 of S.B. \n184; and  \nc.  Grant such additional relief as the needs of justice may require. \n \n   \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 92   Filed 05/04/22   Page 15 of 15\nDated: May 4, 2022      Respectfully submitted,        \n \nSANDRA J.

This lawsuit challenges the felony ban on certain types of \ngender-affirming medical care for transgender youth contained in Section 4 of Act \nNo. 2022-289, Senate Bill (“S.B.”) 184 (2022), the “Alabama Vulnerable Child \nCompassion and Protection Act.”  \nTwo purposes of Rule 24 are “to foster economy of judicial administration \nand to protect non-parties from having their interests adversely affected by \nlitigation conducted without their participation.” Stallworth v. Monsanto Co., 558 \nF.2d 257, 265 (5th Cir. 1977).1 The United States has a statutory right to intervene \nin this litigation under Rule 24(a). See Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(1). Section 902 of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, grants the United States an unconditional \n \n1 Decisions by the former Fifth Circuit issued before October 1, 1981 are binding as precedent in \nthe Eleventh Circuit. See Bonner v. City of Prichard, Ala., 661 F.2d 1206, 1207 (11th Cir. 1981) \n(en banc). \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 58-1   Filed 04/29/22   Page 3 of 11\nright to intervene in certain cases seeking relief from the alleged denial of equal \nprotection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment if the Attorney General \ncertifies that the case is one of general public importance. 42 U.S.C. § 2000h-2. \nHere, the United States alleges that S.B. 184’s felony ban on certain types of \ngender-affirming medical care for transgender youth violates the Equal Protection \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Further, the Attorney General has certified \nthat this case is one of general public importance and the United States’ motion to \nintervene is timely. \nFor these reasons, the Court should grant the United States’ motion to \nintervene.  \nBACKGROUND \nS.B. 184 was signed into law by Governor Kay Ivey on April 8, 2022. The \nlaw will become effective on May 8, 2022. Section 4 of S.B. 184 states that “no \nperson shall engage in or cause any of” specified types of medical care to be \nperformed on a minor if “the purpose of attempting to alter the appearance of or \naffirm the minor’s perception of his or her gender or sex, if that appearance or \nperception is inconsistent” with sex assigned at birth. Alabama S.B. 184, § 4(a). \nThe prohibited practices include administering puberty blockers, administering \nhormone therapy, and surgical interventions (including the removal of “any healthy \nor non-diseased body part or tissue, except for a male circumcision”). Id. § 4(a)(1)-\n3 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 58-1   Filed 04/29/22   Page 4 of 11\n(6). There is an exception for procedures “undertaken to treat a minor born with a \nmedically verifiable disorder of sex development.” Id. § 4(b). Violation of Section \n4 of S.B. 184 is a Class C felony, id. § 4(c), which is punishable by up to 10 years \nof imprisonment and a fine of up to $15,000. See Ala. Crim. Code §§ 13-A-5-\n6(a)(3), 13A-5-11(a)(3).   \nThe Eknes-Tucker Plaintiffs, who include four Alabama transgender minors \nand their parents, a pediatrician, child psychologist, and a pastor, initiated this \nlawsuit on April 19, 2022 against Alabama Governor Kay Ivey, Attorney General \nSteve Marshall, and five district attorneys. In their lawsuit, the Eknes-Tucker \nPlaintiffs allege, inter alia, that S.B. 184 discriminates on the basis of sex and \ntransgender status in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment. Defendants answered the Complaint on April 21, 2022.  \nOn April 21, 2022, the Eknes-Tucker Plaintiffs filed a motion for a \ntemporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. Defendants’ response is \ndue on May 2, 2022, and the motion will be heard on May 5 and 6, 2022.  \nThe United States’ complaint in intervention, which adds the State of \nAlabama as a Defendant, challenges Section 4 of S.B. 184. The United States \nalleges that S.B. 184’s felony ban on certain forms of medically necessary gender-\naffirming care for transgender minors discriminates on the basis of sex and \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 58-1   Filed 04/29/22   Page 5 of 11\ntransgender status in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution.  \nTHE UNITED STATES HAS A RIGHT TO INTERVENE \nUNDER RULE 24(a)(1) \n \nThe United States’ motion to intervene should be granted under Rule \n24(a)(1) because the United States satisfies the requirements for intervention as of \nright. Under that rule on timely motion, a court must permit anyone to intervene \nwho “is given an unconditional right to intervene by a federal statute.” Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 24(a)(1). Where an intervenor timely files a motion to intervene and has an \nunconditional statutory right to intervene in the lawsuit, a court has no discretion to \ndeny the intervention. Equal Emp. Opportunity Comm’n v. STME, LLC, 938 F.3d \n1305, 1322 (11th Cir. 2019). \nThe United States is given an unconditional right to intervene in this lawsuit \nby a federal statute. Section 902 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Section 902”), as \namended, explicitly states that: \nWhenever an action has been commenced in any court of the United \nStates seeking relief from the denial of equal protection of the laws \nunder the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution on account of race, \ncolor, religion, sex or national origin, the Attorney General for or in the \nname of the United States may intervene in such action upon timely \napplication if the Attorney General certifies that the case is of general \npublic importance. In such action the United States shall be entitled to \nthe same relief as if it had instituted the action. \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 58-1   Filed 04/29/22   Page 6 of 11\n42 U.S.C. § 2000h-2. Numerous courts, including the Supreme Court, have \nrecognized that this statute entitles the United States to intervene in equal \nprotection cases. See, e.g., Fitzgerald v. Barnstable School Comm., 555 U.S. 246, \n247-48 (2009) (acknowledging that Section 902 allows the Attorney General to \nintervene in private equal protection suits alleging sex discrimination); Pasadena \nCity Bd. of Ed. v. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424, 430 (1976) (Section 902 authorizes the \nUnited States to continue as a party plaintiff despite the disappearance of the \noriginal plaintiffs); Fuel Oil Supply & Terminaling v. Gulf Oil Corp., 762 F.2d \n1283, 1286 n.5 (5th Cir. 1985); Strain v. Philpott, 331 F. Supp. 836, 837 (M.D. \nAla. 1971). \nSection 902 applies here. The United States alleges that S.B. 184 \ndiscriminates on the basis of sex and transgender status in violation of the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution—one of the claims brought in this matter by the Eknes-Tucker \nPlaintiffs. As required by Section 902, the Attorney General has certified that this \nis a case of public importance. U.S. Mot. to Intervene, Ex. 1.  \nThe United States’ motion is timely. In United States v. Jefferson County, \n720 F.2d 1511 (11th Cir. 1983), the Eleventh Circuit established four factors to \nconsider when evaluating the timeliness of a motion to intervene: (1) the length of \ntime during which the movant actually knew or reasonably should have known of \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 58-1   Filed 04/29/22   Page 7 of 11\nits interest in the case before petitioning for leave to intervene; (2) the extent of the \nprejudice that the existing parties to the litigation may suffer as a result of the \nmovant’s failure to apply for intervention as soon as it actually knew or reasonably \nshould have known of its interest in the case; (3) the extent of the prejudice that the \nmovant may suffer if its petition for leave to intervene is denied; and (4) the \nexistence of unusual circumstances militating either for or against a determination \nthat the application is timely. Jefferson Cnty., 720 F.2d at 1516; see also Comm’r, \nAla. Dep’t of Corrs. v. Advance Local Media, LLC, 918 F.3d 1161, 1171 (11th Cir. \n2019); Georgia v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 302 F.3d 1242, 1259 (11th Cir. \n2002) (holding that delay of six months does not in itself constitute untimeliness) \n(citing Chiles v. Thornburgh, 865 F.2d 1197, 1215 (11th Cir. 1989)).  \nThe United States has met those requirements. The United States is \npetitioning the Court for leave to intervene as quickly as possible after learning of \nits interest. The United States is moving to intervene only 11 days after Plaintiffs’ \ninitiation of their lawsuit and only three weeks after S.B. 184 was signed into law. \nS.B. 184 has not yet gone into effect. Second, the existing parties to the litigation \nwill not suffer any prejudice if the United States’ motion is granted. The case is in \na preliminary phase and discovery has not yet commenced. \nMoreover, granting intervention will not have any negative effect on the \npending preliminary injunction proceedings. The Eknes-Tucker Plaintiffs filed their \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 58-1   Filed 04/29/22   Page 8 of 11\nmotion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction on April 21, \n2022. Granting intervention to the United States here will not prejudice any party \nwith respect to the resolution of the pending motion. The United States will \nimminently file its own motion for a preliminary injunction, which does not raise \nnew claims or arguments. The government is prepared to argue this motion on May \n5 and 6, 2022.  \nConversely, the United States will suffer prejudice if its motion to intervene \nis denied. This case implicates the United States’ ability to protect its sovereign \ninterest in ensuring that all persons, including transgender youth, are afforded \nequal protection of the laws in accordance with the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution. Granting intervention here will conserve resources and best \nserve judicial economy. It will ensure that the United States’ interests are protected \nwithout requiring the filing of a separate lawsuit that would delay the adjudication \nof this matter and, ultimately, the constitutionality of S.B. 184. Such efficiency is \nparticularly critical here given that S.B. 184 goes into effect on May 8. \nThus, the United States has met the requirements for intervention as of right \nunder Rule 24(a)(1).2  \n \n2 In the alternative, the Court should permit the United States to intervene in this litigation \nbecause the requirements for permissive intervention under Rule 24(b)(1)(B) are met here. First, \nthe United States’ putative claims share common questions of law and fact with the Eknes-\nTucker Plaintiffs’ claims. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(1)(B). Both Plaintiffs and the United States \nclaim violations of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and these claims \n \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW   Document 58-1   Filed 04/29/22   Page 9 of 11\nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant the United States’ motion \nto intervene and order its intervention in this action. \nDated: April 29, 2022      Respectfully submitted,        \n \nSANDRA J.

This  Action  is  a  federal  constitutional  challenge  to  the  State  of \nAlabama’s Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act (the “Act”), passed by \nthe Alabama Legislature on April 7, 2022, and signed into law by Governor Kay \nIvey on April 8, 2022. The Act became effective on May 8, 2022 and was in effect \n2 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 159   Filed 09/19/22   Page 3 of 34\nuntil this Court granted Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction on May 13, \n2022. See Doc. 107. \n2.  The Act intrudes into the right of parents to make medical decisions to \nensure the health and wellbeing of their children. It does so by prohibiting parents \nfrom  seeking  and  obtaining  appropriate  medical  care  for  their  children  and \nsubjecting them to criminal prosecution if they do so. \n3.  The Act also targets transgender minors by imposing criminal penalties \non any individuals, including parents and health care providers, who obtain or \nprovide medical treatments essential to the minors’ health care needs. \n4.  Plaintiffs  seek  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  to  enjoin  the \nenforcement  of  the  Act.

Plaintiffs seek redress for the deprivation of their rights secured by the \nUnited States Constitution and the equitable powers of this Court to enjoin unlawful \nofficial conduct. This action is instituted pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to enjoin \nDefendants from enforcing the Act and for a declaration that the Act violates federal \nlaw. Therefore, this Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ \n1331 and 1343. \n20.  This  Court  has  personal  jurisdiction  over  Defendants  because \nDefendants are domiciled in Alabama and the denial of Plaintiffs’ rights guaranteed \nby federal law occurred within Alabama.  \n21.  All Defendants reside in Alabama, and, upon information and belief, \nDefendants Marshall, Bailey, Ventiere, and Anderson reside in this judicial district. \nTherefore, venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1). \n22.  If  enforced,  the  Act  would  violate  the  federal  statutory  and \nconstitutional rights of Plaintiffs in this judicial district. Therefore, venue is also \nproper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C § 1391(b)(2). \n23.  This Court has the authority to enter a declaratory judgment and to \nprovide preliminary and permanent injunctive relief pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 57 \nand 65, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202, and this Court’s inherent equitable powers.  \n8 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 159   Filed 09/19/22   Page 9 of 34\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nI.  Gender Identity and Gender Dysphoria \n24.  Gender identity is an innate, internal sense of one’s sex and is an \nimmutable aspect of a person’s identity. Everyone has a gender identity. Most \npeople’s gender identity is consistent with their birth sex. Transgender people, \nhowever, have a gender identity that differs from their birth sex.  \n25.  Gender dysphoria is the clinical diagnosis for the distress that arises \nwhen  a  person’s  gender  identity  does  not  match  their  birth  sex.  To  receive  a \ndiagnosis of gender dysphoria, a young person must meet the criteria set forth in the \nAm. Psychiatric Ass’n, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th \ned.  2013)  (“DSM-5”).1  If  left  untreated,  gender  dysphoria  can  cause  anxiety, \ndepression, and self-harm, including suicidality.  \n26.  In fact, 56% of transgender youth reported a previous suicide attempt \nand 86% of them reported suicidality. See Austin, Ashley, Shelley L. Craig, Sandra \nD. Souza, and Lauren B. McInroy (2022), Suicidality Among Transgender Youth: \n \n1 Earlier editions of the DSM included a diagnosis referred to as “Gender Identity \nDisorder.” The DSM-5 noted that Gender Dysphoria “is more descriptive than the \nprevious DSM-IV term gender identity disorder and focuses on dysphoria as the \nclinical  problem,  not  identity  per  se.  Being  diagnosed  with  gender  dysphoria \n“implies  no  impairment  in  judgment,  stability,  reliability,  or  general  social  or \nvocational  capabilities.”  Am.  Psychiatric  Ass’n,  Position  Statement  on \nDiscrimination Against Transgender & Gender Variant Individuals (2012). \n9 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 159   Filed 09/19/22   Page 10 of 34\nElucidating the Role of Interpersonal Risk Factors. J. of Interpersonal Violence. \nVol. 37 (5–6) NP2696-NP2718. \n27.  Research has shown that an individual’s gender identity is biologically \nbased and cannot be changed. In the past, mental health professionals sought to treat \ngender dysphoria by attempting to change the person’s gender identity to match their \nbirth sex; these efforts were unsuccessful and caused serious harms. Today, the \nmedical profession generally recognizes that such efforts put minors at risk of \nserious harm, including dramatically increased rates of suicidality.  \n28.  Gender  dysphoria  is  highly  treatable.  Healthcare  providers  who \nspecialize in the treatment of gender dysphoria follow a well-established standard of \ncare that has been adopted by the major medical and mental health associations in \nthe United States including, but not limited to, the American Medical Association, \nthe  American  Academy  of  Pediatrics,  the  American  Association  of  Child  and \nAdolescent Psychiatrists, the Pediatric Endocrine Society, the American Psychiatric \nAssociation, the American Psychological Association, and the Endocrine Society.  \n29.  The standards of care for treatment of transgender people, including \ntransgender youth, were initially developed by the World Professional Association \nfor  Transgender  Health  (“WPATH”),  an  international,  multidisciplinary, \nprofessional association of medical providers, mental health providers, researchers, \nand  others, with  a mission of  promoting  evidence-based  care  and  research  for \n10 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 159   Filed 09/19/22   Page 11 of 34\ntransgender health, including the treatment of gender dysphoria. WPATH published \nthe most recent edition of the Standards of Care for the treatment of gender dysphoria \nin minors and adults in 2011 and is in the process of finalizing a revised edition of \nthe Standards of Care, which will likely be published later this year. \n30.  The Endocrine Society has also promulgated a standard of care for the \nprovision of hormone therapy as a treatment for gender dysphoria in minors and \nadults.  See  Wylie  C.  Hembree,  et  al.,  Endocrine  Treatment  of  Gender-\nDysphoric/Gender-Incongruent Persons: An Endocrine Society Clinical Practice \nGuideline, 102 J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 3869 (2017).  \n31.  The  American  Medical  Association,  the  American  Academy  of \nPediatrics, the American Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists, the \nPediatric Endocrine Society, the American Psychiatric Association, the American \nPsychological Association, and other professional medical organizations also follow \nthe WPATH and Endocrine Society standards of care.  \n32.  The treatment of gender dysphoria is designed to reduce a transgender \nperson’s psychological distress by permitting them to live in alignment with their \ngender identity. Undergoing treatment for gender dysphoria is commonly referred to \nas transition. There are several components to the transition process: social, legal, \nmedical, and surgical. Each of these components is part of the medically approved \n11 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 159   Filed 09/19/22   Page 12 of 34\nprocess for transition, some or all of which a transgender person may undertake as \npart of their transition.  \n33.  Social transition typically involves adopting a new name, pronouns, \nhairstyle, and clothing that match that person’s gender identity, and treating that \nperson consistent with their gender identity in all aspects of their life, including \nhome, school, and everyday life. Following those steps, transgender people often \nobtain a court order legally changing their name and, where possible, changing the \nsex listed on their birth certificate and other identity documents.  \n34.  For transgender people who have begun puberty, it may be appropriate \nfor them to start taking puberty-blocking medication and later hormone-replacement \ntherapy to ensure their body develops in a manner consistent with their gender \nidentity.  \n35.  Finally,  surgical  treatment  may  in  some  cases  be part of  essential \nmedical care for a transgender individual. The only surgical treatment available to \ntransgender minors is male chest reconstruction surgery, a procedure to remove \nexisting breast tissue and create a male chest contour for transgender males. Like all \ntreatments  for  gender  dysphoria,  male  chest  reconstruction surgery is safe  and \neffective in treating gender dysphoria. The medical necessity of surgical care is \ndetermined on a case-by-case basis that considers the age of the patient, medical \n12 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 159   Filed 09/19/22   Page 13 of 34\nneed,  and  appropriateness  of  the  procedure  relative  to  the  psychological \ndevelopment of the individual. \n36.  Longitudinal studies have shown that children with gender dysphoria \nwho  receive  essential  medical  care  show  levels  of  mental  health  and  stability \nconsistent with those of non-transgender children. Lily Durwood, et al., Mental \nHealth and Self-Worth in Socially Transitioned Transgender Youth, 56 J. Am. Acad. \nChild & Adolescent Psychiatry 116 (2017); Kristina Olson, et al., Mental Health of \nTransgender  Children  who  are  Supported  in  Their  Identities,  137  Pediatrics  1 \n(2016). In contrast, children with gender dysphoria who do not receive appropriate \nmedical care are at risk of serious harm, including dramatically increased rates of \nsuicidality and serious depression. \nII.  The Alabama Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act \n37.  On April 8, 2022, Governor Kay Ivey signed the Act into law. The Act \nbecame effective on May 8, 2022, and remained in effect until this Court granted \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction on May 13, 2022. See Doc. 107. \n38.  The  Act  prevents  parents  from  consenting  to,  and  healthcare \nprofessionals from providing, well-established medically necessary care.  The Act \nalso  applies  to  any  individual  who  “cause[s]”  such  care  to  be  provided  to  a \ntransgender minor.  \n39.  Specifically, subsection 4(a) of the Act provides that:  \n13 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 159   Filed 09/19/22   Page 14 of 34\nExcept  as  provided  in  subsection  (b),  no  person  shall \nengage in or cause any of the following practices to be \nperformed upon a minor if the practice is performed for \nthe purpose of attempting to alter the appearance of or \naffirm the minor’s perception of his or her gender or sex, \nif that appearance or perception is inconsistent with the \nminor’s sex as defined in this act: \n \n(1)  Prescribing  or  administering  puberty  blocking \nmedication to stop or delay normal puberty. \n(2)  Prescribing  or  administering  supraphysiologic \ndoses  of  testosterone  or  other  androgens  to \nfemales. \n(3)  Prescribing  or  administering  supraphysiologic \ndoses of estrogen to males. \n(4)  Performing  surgeries  that  sterilize,  including \ncastration,  vasectomy,  hysterectomy, \noophorectomy, orchiectomy, and penectomy. \n(5)  Performing  surgeries  that  artificially  construct \ntissue with the appearance of genitalia that differs \nfrom  the  individual’s  sex,  including \nmetoidioplasty, phalloplasty, and vaginoplasty. \n(6)  Removing any healthy or non-diseased body part \nor tissue, except for a male circumcision. \n \n40.  A violation of subsection 4(a) of the Act is a Class C felony, punishable \nupon conviction by up to 10 years imprisonment or a fine of up to $15,000. \n41.  As  a  result  of  subsection  4(a)  of  the  Act,  medical  professionals, \nincluding the Healthcare Provider Plaintiffs, and parents of transgender minors, \nincluding the Parent Plaintiffs, are forced to choose between withholding medically \nnecessary treatment from their minor transgender patients or children, on the one \nhand, or facing criminal prosecution, on the other.     \n14 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 159   Filed 09/19/22   Page 15 of 34\nIII.  The Act Will Irreparably Harm the Plaintiffs  \nBrianna Boe and Michael Boe \n42.  Michael Boe is a 12-year-old transgender boy who resides with his \nmother in Montgomery County, Alabama. \n43.  In his early years, Michael was a happy, outgoing child. But at nine \nyears old, Michael became depressed and anxious. Michael also started struggling \nacademically and socially.  \n44.  Michael eventually confided in his mother that he felt as though he was \nnot like other girls and was worried about being judged by his classmates. He also \nreported that he was being bullied in school. Brianna placed Michael in a new school \nfor the following school year and brought him to a therapist to help him with his \ndepression.  \n45.  Michael began to talk with Brianna about his male gender identity and \nthe distress and discomfort he was experiencing as he entered puberty, as his body \nbegan to develop in ways that were inconsistent with his sense of self.  \n46.  In June 2021, Michael told his mother that he is transgender. With \nsupport from his family and a mental health provider experienced in working with \ntransgender youth, Michael began to socially transition, including adopting a male \nname and pronouns and generally living as a boy in all aspects of his life.  \n15 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 159   Filed 09/19/22   Page 16 of 34\n47.  Since Michael began to socially transition, his mood has improved \ngreatly. His therapist recently recommended that Michael be evaluated for additional \nmedical treatment to address the mismatch between his body and his gender identity.   \n48.  In February 2022, Brianna reached out to the Children’s Hospital of \nAlabama to make an initial appointment for Michael.  If this law goes into effect, \nhowever, that appointment will be cancelled, and Michael will have to further delay \nhis assessment for critical medical care. \nMegan Poe and Allison Poe \n49.  Allison Poe is a 15-year-old transgender girl who resides with her \nmother, Megan Poe, in Cullman County, Alabama. \n50.  As a young child, Allison showed interest in girls’ toys and clothing. \nThinking this was a phase, her parents initially refused to buy Allison any girl toys. \nWithout asking, Allison’s grandmother bought Allison a Barbie doll. Allison was so \nhappy and carried it everywhere.  \n51.  When the family returned to the United States from her father’s military \ndeployment abroad, Allison would become very upset when her mother refused to \nbuy her girls’ clothes. As a compromise, Megan bought Allison a few girls’ toys. \nEventually, Allison’s father found them and attempted to throw them away, but \nAllison’s brother snuck them back into the house. \n16 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 159   Filed 09/19/22   Page 17 of 34\n52.  When Allison was around nine years old, her personality began to \nchange significantly. She became withdrawn, quiet, showed signs of depression, and \nregularly commented that she wanted to die. She also stopped eating regularly. \nAllison’s  actions  became  so  worrisome  to  Megan  that  she  consulted  with  a \npediatrician.  The  pediatrician  suggested  that  Allison  may  be  transgender  and \nreferred them to the gender clinic at UAB Hospital.   \n53.  After evaluating Allison, the team of clinicians educated Megan about \nwhat Allison was experiencing and gave her advice about how to support Allison. \nThat visit was a turning point for Megan. She became supportive of Allison, helping \nher redecorate her room and buying her girls’ clothes. The first time Allison came \nout of her room in girls’ clothes, she was beaming with joy. \n54.  By fifth grade, many of Allison’s peers had started showing the first \nsigns of puberty, and Allison became scared about going through a male puberty.  In \nanticipation of her starting puberty, Allison started the process to be evaluated for \npuberty-blocking medication.  \n55.  About seven months ago, just as Allison was beginning high school, \nshe was evaluated for and eventually started on estrogen.  Her mental health has \nimproved dramatically; she is confident, social, and doing well in school. \n56.  If the Act is allowed to go into effect, Allison’s medical care will be \ndisrupted, which would cause Allison extreme anxiety and distress. She will develop \n17 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 159   Filed 09/19/22   Page 18 of 34\nphysical traits that are inconsistent with her identity as a girl that will require her to \nundergo otherwise avoidable surgeries in the future as an adult.  \nKathy Noe and Christopher Noe \n57.  Christopher Noe is a 17-year-old transgender boy who resides with his \nmother, Kathy Noe, in Lee County, Alabama. Christopher and Kathy have deep roots \nin Alabama, having moved to the State just before Christopher turned 4 years old.  \nKathy is former active-duty military, while Christopher’s father is still active-duty \nmilitary and is deployed abroad.   \n58.  Since Christopher was a toddler, he resisted attempts to dress him as a \ngirl. For example, he refused to attend his sixth-grade graduation because doing so \nmeant he would have to wear a dress.   \n59.  As Christopher began to enter puberty, his distress at the changes his \nbody was undergoing and at being made to present as female intensified.  \n60.  When Christopher was 14, he told his mother he is transgender. Kathy \nfound  Christopher  a  therapist  experienced  in  working  with  transgender  young \npeople. The therapist helped both Christopher and Kathy navigate the beginning \nstages of Christopher’s transition. \n61.  About a year later, Christopher came out to his father as transgender. \nChristopher’s father struggled initially, but because of his love for Christopher, his \nfather began to accept Christopher for who he is.  \n18 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 159   Filed 09/19/22   Page 19 of 34\n62.  With his father’s support, Kathy took Christopher to a physician to \nbegin  the  evaluation  for  hormone-replacement  therapy.  Because  Kathy  and \nChristopher live close to the Alabama-Georgia state line, Christopher’s doctors are \nin  Columbus,  Georgia.  Christopher’s  prescriptions,  however,  are  filled  at  a \npharmacy in Alabama. \n63.  Christopher  began  hormone  replacement  therapy  in  March  2022. \nChristopher has been noticeably happier. He is bubbly and more outgoing and is \nconfident at work and around other people. \n64.  If the Act is allowed to go into effect, Christopher’s medical care will \nbe  disrupted,  which  will  have  devastating  and  irreversible  physical  and \npsychological consequences. \nRebecca Roe and Melissa Roe \n65.  Melissa is a nine-year-old transgender girl who lives with her mother, \nstepparent, and stepsibling in Jefferson County, Alabama. \n66.  When Melissa was about three, she began expressing a preference for \nwearing girls’ clothing and having long hair.  \n67.  Over time, Melissa continued to express a strong preference for girls’ \nclothing and became angry and distressed when others would refer to her or treat her \nlike a boy, which would cause her to become upset and throw objects around the \nhouse.  \n19 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 159   Filed 09/19/22   Page 20 of 34\n68.  In first grade, Rebecca learned from Melissa’s teacher that Melissa \nasked to be referred to as a girl in school.  Around the same time, Melissa also told \nher mother, “I am a girl.”  \n69.  Rebecca reached out to Melissa’s pediatrician for support and Melissa \nalso began seeing a new therapist.  \n70.  Melissa’s pediatrician referred Melissa to the clinic at UAB. Melissa \nhad her first appointment in spring 2021. Her next appointment is in December 2022. \n71.  With puberty approaching, Melissa is starting to show signs of distress \nin anticipation of the physical changes that accompany puberty and is concerned that \nshe will be perceived by others as a boy.  \n72.  During their prior visits, Rebecca had extensive conversations with \ndoctors at the clinic about the risks and benefits of puberty blockers and feels very \nwell informed about treatment options for Melissa’s gender dysphoria. If and when \nMelissa’s doctors indicate that puberty blockers are medically necessary to treat \nMelissa’s gender dysphoria, Rebecca plans to carefully review the consent forms \nand  ensure  she  fully  understands  them  before  consenting  to  treatment.  Given \nMelissa’s prior difficulties with behavior, Rebecca is concerned that Melissa will \nattempt to hurt herself if Melissa does not obtain appropriate treatment for her gender \ndysphoria. \n20 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 159   Filed 09/19/22   Page 21 of 34\n73.  If  Melissa  were  unable  to  access  necessary  medical  treatment  in \nAlabama, it would not only harm her, but her whole family as well. Rebecca, a \nprofessor at a public university, would be forced to leave Alabama in order to protect \nMelissa. That move would tear her family apart as Rebecca’s husband and his \ndaughter—Melissa’s stepfather and stepsibling—are unable to leave Alabama. \nRobert Moe and April Moe \n74.  April is a twelve-year-old transgender girl who lives with her parents \nand three siblings in Florida, but has been a patient at the UAB clinic for several \nyears. \n75.  April started showing an interest in typical girls’ clothing and toys from \na very early age.  \n76.  During preschool, April would always have a change of clothes in her \nbackpack in case she got dirty or needed clean clothes. Her parents would allow \nApril to pick out the clothes she would bring, and she always chose girls’ clothes. \nAt preschool, April would not even wait to get dirty before changing into her back-\nup set of clothes. The staff at the daycare would then eventually coax April back into \nboys’ clothes, which was very upsetting for April. After learning about this, April’s \nparents spoke with the daycare about allowing April to wear whatever clothes she \nwanted. April’s preference for girls’ clothing did not seem like anything more than \na phase, but they wanted to give April the latitude to play out her imagination. \n21 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 159   Filed 09/19/22   Page 22 of 34\n77.  By age four, April became quite insistent that she is a girl. After taking \na bath one night, April expressed intense distress to her mother about her penis.  \nUnsurprisingly, that jarring comment caused April’s parents to realize that this may \nnot be a phase, and that April needed to see a mental health professional who could \nhelp April and her parents navigate this issue. \n78.  April’s parents found a psychologist with experience working with \nchildren experiencing gender dysphoria. After evaluating April, the psychologist \nrecommended using female pronouns when referring to April. Although a seemingly \nsmall change, April’s parents saw a significant positive change in her attitude and \nbehavior following her social transition. \n79.  Even though April’s dysphoria had noticeably subsided since her social \ntransition, April’s parents wanted to get the advice of a medical doctor to ensure they \nwere doing everything they could to keep April healthy. When they first started \nlooking for a medical provider with experience working with transgender children, \nRobert’s mother, a retired healthcare provider in Birmingham, suggested that they \ncontact  a  doctor  at  the  UAB  clinic.  Finding  a  doctor  they  could  trust  was  of \nparamount  importance  to  April’s  parents.  Thus,  they  decided  to  make  the \napproximately ten-hour drive for April to be seen at the UAB clinic. \n80.  April’s first appointment with the UAB clinic occurred in September \n2019. She had been going for annual visits at the clinic until recently when they \n22 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 159   Filed 09/19/22   Page 23 of 34\nstarted going more frequently given how close April is to the beginning of puberty. \nApril’s next appointment at the clinic is in September 2022. April’s mother is a nurse \nand based on what April is reporting to her, April’s parents anticipate that April will \nhave reached the onset of puberty by the September appointment, and that it may be \ntime for her to begin puberty blockers. \n81.  April has also been under the care of a mental health provider who \nspecializes in working with transgender youth for about three years. \n82.  April’s parents have done research on their own to learn about the \ntreatment options for gender dysphoria, including puberty blockers. But they are \nwaiting until April’s doctor indicates that puberty blockers are medically necessary \nfor April before discussing that option with him. They plan to thoroughly review and \ndiscuss all the materials provided by April’s doctor  and the clinic and to make sure \nthey fully understand the risks and benefits of that treatment before consenting. \n83.  Not being able to get puberty blockers when it is medically necessary \nfor April would be devastating for April. There is no doubt in April’s parents’ minds \nthat if April had to go through male puberty that she would attempt to harm herself \nand that her mental health would decline. \n84.  If SB 184 is allowed to go into effect, it would block April’s ability to \nget the care she needs. Being unable to receive puberty blocking medication would \n23 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 159   Filed 09/19/22   Page 24 of 34\nresult in physical changes to her body and appearance that would exacerbate her \ngender dysphoria, causing long-lasting harm to her physical and mental health. \nDr. Rachel Koe \n85.  Dr. Rachel Koe is a board-certified pediatrician in southeast Alabama. \nOver  the  past  decade,  Dr.  Koe  has  treated  a  handful  of  transgender  patients, \nincluding one current patient for whom she provides primary care.  \n86.  Depending on the needs of the patient, Dr. Koe has referred patients \nand their parents to local mental health providers as well as the gender clinic at UAB \nHospital. Even after referral, Dr. Koe remains involved with her patients’ care. For \nexample, Dr. Koe’s office draws blood for their patient’s regular blood work in \nadvance of appointments with the gender clinic. Additionally, she and her staff \nprovide support to patients who need assistance in self-administering injectable \nmedications like testosterone. \n87.  Dr. Koe is familiar with the standards of care for the treatment of gender \ndysphoria and the medical literature regarding those treatments. She has also seen \nthe significant positive effects medical treatment for gender dysphoria has had on \nthe health and wellbeing of her patients.  \n88.  If the Act goes into effect, Dr. Koe would be forced to choose between \ncomplying  with  the  Act  and  the  medical  needs  of  her  current  and  any  future \ntransgender patients whose mental and physical health will deteriorate if denied \n24 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 159   Filed 09/19/22   Page 25 of 34\nongoing medical treatment for their gender dysphoria. The Act forces Dr. Koe to \nviolate her professional and ethical obligations as a physician by denying her patients \naccess to  a course of  treatment that is evidence-based  and consistent with  the \nestablished standards of care.  \nHeather Austin, Ph.D. \n89.  Dr. Heather Austin is a doctoral-level clinical child psychologist with a \nspecialty in child development who currently practices in a hospital setting within \nthe UAB System. Dr. Austin has been a practicing clinical psychologist for twenty \nyears and has experience working with children and adolescents with a variety of \nmental health issues. For the past two years, part of Dr. Austin’s practice has been \ndedicated to mental health treatment and evaluation of transgender young people. \n90.  Dr. Austin’s work with transgender patients is guided by the well-\nestablished standards of care and the hospital’s informed-consent protocol. Her \nassessment process engages both the patient and the patient’s parents and requires a \nminimum of three to four visits. It is quite common for the assessment to require \nadditional  visits,  but  that  determination  is  made  on  a  case-by-case  basis  and \ndependent on the needs of the patient and the patient’s family. \n91.  In order to conduct her assessment, Dr. Austin gathers information \nabout the patient from questionnaires, rating scales, and discussions with the patient \nand the patient’s family. Pulling from multiple sources provides Dr. Austin with the \n25 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 159   Filed 09/19/22   Page 26 of 34\ninformation she needs to determine whether the patient meets the diagnostic criteria \nfor gender dysphoria as outlined in the DSM-5.  \n92.  Once she has made, or confirmed, the diagnosis, Dr. Austin then begins \ntaking the patient and the patient’s parents through the informed-consent protocol. \nAs required by the protocol, she has detailed discussions about the risks and benefits \nof the particular medical treatment being considered by the patient and their medical \nprovider. Because of the large amount of information that is reviewed as part of the \ninformed-consent protocol, this discussion can occur over multiple sessions and \nsometimes Dr. Austin will have separate sessions with the patient and the parent(s) \nto give each person an opportunity to ask questions and engage with the information \nbeing provided.  \n93.  After completing the informed-consent protocol, Dr. Austin writes a \nletter to the patient’s medical provider detailing the results of her assessment. That \nletter will include, for example, an overview of the patient’s mental health and, if \nneeded, recommendations on follow up mental health care. Although the letter \ndiscusses  a  patient’s  readiness  to  proceed  with  treatment,  Dr.  Austin  always \nrecommends in the letter that the medical provider conduct a further assessment \nbefore initiating treatment.  \n94.  If enforced, the Act will prevent Dr. Austin from continuing to treat \ntransgender patients in a manner that is consistent with the applicable standards of \n26 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 159   Filed 09/19/22   Page 27 of 34\ncare. Practicing this way would require Dr. Austin to violate her professional and \nethical obligations. Unwilling to do so, Dr. Austin fears that she will be subject to \ncriminal prosecution under the Act. \n95.  Dr. Austin is also concerned for the health and wellbeing of her patients \nshould the Act go into effect. She has witnessed the significant distress her patients \nexperience before starting medical treatment and the tremendous positive effects \nthose treatments have on her patients’ mental health. Without access to that critical \ncare, Dr. Austin worries that her patients’ mental health will deteriorate in ways that \nwill interfere with their ability to function and cause lasting harm to their health and \nwellbeing, including developing substance use issues and increased suicidality. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \nDeprivation of Substantive Due Process \nParent Plaintiffs Against Defendants in Their Official Capacities \nViolation of Parent Plaintiffs’ Right to Direct the Upbringing of Their Children \nU.S. Const. Amend. XIV \n96.  Plaintiffs incorporate all preceding paragraphs of the Complaint as if \nset forth fully herein. \n97.  The Parent Plaintiffs bring this Count against all Defendants.  \n98.  The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects \nthe rights of parents to make decisions “concerning the care, custody, and control of \ntheir children.” Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 66, 120 S. Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d \n27 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 159   Filed 09/19/22   Page 28 of 34\n49 (2000). That fundamental right includes the liberty to make medical decisions for \ntheir  minor  children,  including  the  right  to  obtain  medical  treatments  that  are \nrecognized to be safe, effective, and medically necessary to protect their children’s \nhealth and well-being.  \n99.  The  Act  violates  this  fundamental  right  by  preventing  the  Parent \nPlaintiffs from obtaining medically necessary care for their minor children.  \n100.  By intruding upon parents’ fundamental right to direct the upbringing \nof their children, the Act is subject to strict scrutiny.  \n101.  Defendants have no compelling justification for preventing parents \nfrom ensuring their children can receive essential medical care. The Act does not \nadvance any legitimate interest, much less a compelling one. \nCOUNT II \nDeprivation of Equal Protection \n All Plaintiffs Against Defendants in Their Official Capacities \nU.S. Const. Amend. XIV \n102.  Plaintiffs incorporate all preceding paragraphs of the Complaint as if \nset forth fully herein. \n103.  All Plaintiffs bring this Count against all Defendants.  \n104.  The  Equal  Protection  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment, \nenforceable pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, provides that no state shall “deny to any \nperson within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” U.S. Const. Amend. \nXIV, § 1. \n28 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 159   Filed 09/19/22   Page 29 of 34\n105.  The  Act  singles  out  transgender  minors  and  prohibits  them  from \nobtaining medically necessary treatment based on their sex and transgender status. \n106.  The Act also treats transgender minors differently and less favorably \nthan non-transgender minors by allowing minors who are not transgender to obtain \nthe  same  medical  treatments  that  are  prohibited  when  medically  necessary  for \ntransgender minors.  \n107.  Under the Equal Protection Clause, government classifications based \non sex are subject to heightened scrutiny and are presumptively unconstitutional. \n108.  Transgender-based  government  classifications  are  subject,  at  a \nminimum, to heightened scrutiny because they are also sex-based classifications. \n109.  Because  transgender  people  have  obvious,  immutable,  and \ndistinguishing characteristics, including having a gender identity that is different \nthan their birth sex, they comprise a discrete group. This defining characteristic bears \nno relation to a transgender person’s ability to contribute to society. Nevertheless, \ntransgender people have faced historical discrimination and have been unable to \nsecure equality through the political process. \n110.  As such, transgender classifications are subject to strict scrutiny. \n111.  The Act does nothing to protect the health or well-being of minors. To \nthe contrary, the Act undermines the health and well-being of transgender minors by \ndenying them essential medical care. \n29 \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 159   Filed 09/19/22   Page 30 of 34\n112.  The Act is not narrowly tailored to further a compelling government \ninterest and is not substantially related to any important governmental interest. \nMoreover,  the  Act  is  not  even  rationally  related  to  a  governmental  interest. \nAccordingly,  the  Act  violates  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment. \nRELIEF REQUESTED \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that this Court: \n(1)  issue a judgment, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202, declaring that the \nAct violates federal law for the reasons and on the Counts set forth above;  \n(2)  temporarily, preliminarily, and permanently enjoin Defendants and their \nofficers, employees, servants, agents, appointees, or successors from \nenforcing the Act; \n(3)  declare that the Act violates the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nUnited States Constitution; and \n(4)  grant such other relief as the Court finds just and proper.  \nRespectfully submitted this 19th day of September, 2022.        \n/s/ Melody H.

Docket No. 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW \n____________________ \n \nBefore  LAGOA,  BRASHER,  Circuit  Judges,  and  BOULEE,*  District \nJudge. \nLAGOA, Circuit Judge: \nThis appeal centers around section 4(a)(1)–(3) of Alabama’s \nVulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act (the “Act”).  Sec-\ntion 4(a)(1)–(3) of the Act states that “no person shall engage in or \ncause” the prescription or administration of puberty blocking med-\nication or cross-sex hormone treatment to a minor “for the purpose \nof attempting to alter the appearance of or affirm the minor’s per-\nception of his or her gender or sex, if that appearance or perception \nis inconsistent with the minor’s sex.”  Thus, section 4(a)(1)–(3) \n \n* Honorable J. P. Boulee, United States District Judge for the Northern District \nof Georgia, sitting by designation. \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 5 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 3 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  3 \nmakes it a crime in the State of Alabama to take part in providing \npuberty blockers or cross-sex hormone treatment to a minor for \npurposes of treating a discordance between the minor’s biological \nsex and sense of gender identity. \nShortly  after  the  Act  was  signed  into  law,  a  group  of \ntransgender minors, their parents, and other concerned individuals \nchallenged the Act’s constitutionality, claiming that it violates the \nDue Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Four-\nteenth Amendment.  As part of that lawsuit, the district court is-\nsued a preliminary injunction enjoining Alabama from enforcing \nsection 4(a)(1)–(3) of the Act pending trial, having determined that \nthe plaintiffs are substantially likely to succeed on both of the afore-\nmentioned claims.  Specifically, as to the due process claim, the dis-\ntrict court held that there is a constitutional right to “treat [one’s] \nchildren with transitioning medications subject to medically ac-\ncepted standards” and that the restrictions of section 4(a)(1)–(3) \nlikely impermissibly infringe upon that constitutional right.  As to \nthe equal protection claim, the district court held that section \n4(a)(1)–(3) classifies on the basis of sex by classifying on the basis of \ngender nonconformity and likely amounts to unlawful discrimina-\ntion under the intermediate scrutiny standard applicable to sex-\nbased classifications. \nOn review, we hold that the district court abused its discre-\ntion in issuing this preliminary injunction because it applied the \nwrong standard of scrutiny.  The plaintiffs have not presented any \nauthority that supports the existence of a constitutional right to \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 6 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 4 of 59\n4  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \n“treat [one’s] children with transitioning medications subject to \nmedically accepted standards.”  Nor have they shown that section \n4(a)(1)–(3) classifies on the basis of sex or any other protected char-\nacteristic.  Accordingly, section 4(a)(1)–(3) is subject only to ra-\ntional basis review.  Because the district court erred by reviewing \nthe statute under a heightened standard of scrutiny, its determina-\ntion that the plaintiffs have established a substantial likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits cannot stand.  We therefore vacate the pre-\nliminary injunction. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nThe Act was passed by the Alabama Legislature on April 7, \n2022,  and signed into law by Governor Kay Ivey the following day, \nthereby set to become effective on May 8, 2022. \nA.  The Text of the Act \nThe Act contains eleven sections.  For the sake of complete-\nness, each section is described below. \nSection 1\n establishes the title of the Act.   \nSection 2\n sets forth the following findings by the Alabama \nLegislature: \n(1)  The sex of a person is the biological state of \nbeing female or male, based on sex organs, chromo-\nsomes, and endogenous hormone profiles, and is ge-\nnetically encoded into a person at the moment of \nconception, and it cannot be changed. \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 7 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 5 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  5 \n(2)  Some individuals, including minors, may expe-\nrience discordance between their sex and their inter-\nnal sense of identity, and individuals who experience \nsevere psychological distress as a result of this discord-\nance may be diagnosed with gender dysphoria. \n(3)  The cause of the individual’s impression of dis-\ncordance between sex and identity is unknown, and \nthe diagnosis is based exclusively on the individual’s \nself-report of feelings and beliefs. \n(4)  This internal sense of discordance is not per-\nmanent or fixed, but to the contrary, numerous stud-\nies have shown that a substantial majority of children \nwho experience discordance between their sex and \nidentity will outgrow the discordance once they go \nthrough puberty and will eventually have an identity \nthat aligns with their sex. \n(5)  As a result, taking a wait-and-see approach to \nchildren who reveal signs of gender nonconformity \nresults in a large majority of those children resolving \nto an identity congruent with their sex by late adoles-\ncence. \n(6)  Some in the medical community are aggres-\nsively pushing for interventions on minors that medi-\ncally alter the child’s hormonal balance and remove \nhealthy external and internal sex organs when the \nchild expresses a desire to appear as a sex different \nfrom his or her own. \n(7)  This  course  of  treatment  for  minors  com-\nmonly  begins  with  encouraging  and  assisting  the \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 8 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 6 of 59\n6  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nchild to socially transition to dressing and presenting \nas the opposite sex.  In the case of prepubertal chil-\ndren,  as  puberty  begins,  doctors  then  administer \nlong-acting  GnRH  agonist  (puberty  blockers)  that \nsuppress the pubertal development of the child.  This \nuse of puberty blockers for gender nonconforming \nchildren is experimental and not FDA-approved. \n(8)  After puberty blockade, the child is later ad-\nministered “cross-sex” hormonal treatments that in-\nduce the development of secondary sex characteris-\ntics of the other sex, such as causing the development \nof breasts and wider hips in male children taking es-\ntrogen and greater muscle mass, bone density, body \nhair, and a deeper voice in female children taking tes-\ntosterone.  Some children are administered these hor-\nmones independent of any prior pubertal blockade. \n(9)  The final phase of treatment is for the individ-\nual to undergo cosmetic and other surgical proce-\ndures, often to create an appearance similar to that of \nthe opposite sex.  These surgical procedures may in-\nclude a mastectomy to remove a female adolescent’s \nbreasts and “bottom surgery” that removes a minor’s \nhealth reproductive organs and creates an artificial \nform aiming to approximate the appearance of the \ngenitals of the opposite sex. \n(10)  For minors who are placed on puberty block-\ners that inhibit their bodies from experiencing the \nnatural  process  of  sexual  development,  the  over-\nwhelming majority will continue down a path toward \ncross-sex hormones and cosmetic surgery. \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 9 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 7 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  7 \n(11)  This unproven, poorly studied series of inter-\nventions results in numerous harmful effects for mi-\nnors, as well as risks of effects simply unknown due \nto the new and experimental nature of these interven-\ntions. \n(12)  Among the known harms from puberty block-\ners is diminished bone density; the full effect of pu-\nberty blockers on brain development and cognition \nare yet unknown, though reason for concern is now \npresent.  There is no research on the long-term risks \nto minors of persistent exposure to puberty blockers.  \nWith  the  administration  of  cross-sex  hormones \ncomes  increased  risks  of  cardiovascular  disease, \nthromboembolic stroke, asthma, COPD, and cancer. \n(13)  Puberty blockers prevent gonadal maturation \nand thus render patients taking these drugs infertile.  \nIntroducing cross-sex hormones to children with im-\nmature gonads as a direct result of pubertal blockade \nis expected to cause irreversible sterility.  Sterilization \nis also permanent for those who undergo surgery to \nremove reproductive organs, and such persons are \nlikely to suffer through a lifetime of complications \nfrom the surgery, infections, and other difficulties re-\nquiring yet more medical intervention. \n(14)  Several  studies  demonstrate  that  hormonal \nand surgical interventions often do not resolve the un-\nderlying psychological issues affecting the individual.  \nFor example, individuals who undergo cross-sex cos-\nmetic surgical procedures have been found to suffer \nfrom elevated mortality rates higher than the general \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 10 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 8 of 59\n8  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \npopulation.    They  experience  significantly  higher \nrates of substance abuse, depression, and psychiatric \nhospitalizations. \n(15)  Minors, and often their parents, are unable to \ncomprehend and fully appreciate the risk and life im-\nplications, including permanent sterility, that result \nfrom  the  use  of  puberty  blockers,  cross-sex  hor-\nmones, and surgical procedures. \n(16)  For  these  reasons,  the  decision  to  pursue  a \ncourse of hormonal and surgical interventions to ad-\ndress a discordance between the individual’s sex and \nsense of identity should not be presented to or deter-\nmined for minors who are incapable of comprehend-\ning the negative implications and life-course difficul-\nties attending to these interventions. \nSection 3\n provides definitions for the terms “minor,” “per-\nson,” and “sex.”  Section 3(1) incorporates the definition of “minor” \nestablished in section 43-8-1 of the Alabama Code, first enacted in \n1975, which is “[a] person who is under 19 years of age.”  Ala. Code \n§ 43-8-1(18).  Section 3(2) defines the term “person” to include \n“[a]ny individual”; “[a]ny agent, employee, official, or contractor of \nany legal entity”; and “[a]ny agent, employee, official, or contractor \nof a school district or the state or any of its political subdivisions or \nagencies.”  Section 3(3) defines  the term “sex” to mean “[t]he \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 11 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 9 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  9 \nbiological state of being male or female, based on the individual’s \nsex organs, chromosomes, and endogenous hormone profiles.”   \nSection 4\n, in broad terms, makes it a felony to perform cer-\ntain medical practices on minors for certain purposes, and reads as \nfollows: \n(a)  Except as provided in subsection (b), no person \nshall engage in or cause any of the following practices \nto be performed upon a minor if the practice is per-\nformed for the purpose of attempting to alter the ap-\npearance of or affirm the minor’s perception of his or \nher gender or sex, if that appearance or perception is \ninconsistent with the minor’s sex as defined in this \nact: \n(1) Prescribing or administering puberty blocking \nmedication to stop or delay normal puberty. \n(2) Prescribing  or  administering  supraphysio-\nlogic[1] doses of testosterone or other androgens to \nfemales. \n(3) Prescribing or administering supraphysiologic \ndoses of estrogen to males. \n(4) Performing surgeries that sterilize, including \ncastration, vasectomy, hysterectomy, oophorec-\ntomy, orchiectomy, and penectomy. \n \n1 Supraphysiologic means of or pertaining to an amount “greater than nor-\nmally present in the body.”  See Supraphysiologic, Merriam-Webster, https://\nwww.merriam-webster.com/medical/supraphysiological. \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 12 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 10 of 59\n10  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \n(5) Performing surgeries that artificially construct \ntissue with the appearance of genitalia that differs \nfrom  the  individual’s  sex,  including  metoidio-\nplasty, phalloplasty, and vaginoplasty. \n(6) Removing any healthy or non-diseased body \npart or tissue, except for a male circumcision. \n(b)  Subsection (a) does not apply to a procedure \nundertaken to treat a minor born with a medically \nverifiable disorder of sex development, including ei-\nther of the following: \n(1) An individual born with external biological sex \ncharacteristics that are irresolvably ambiguous, in-\ncluding an individual born with 46 XX chromo-\nsomes with virilization, 46 XY chromosomes with \nunder virilization, or having both ovarian and tes-\nticular tissue. \n(2) An individual whom a physician has otherwise \ndiagnosed with a disorder of sexual development, \nin which the physician has determined through \ngenetic  or  biochemical  testing  that  the  person \ndoes not have normal sex chromosome structure, \nsex steroid hormone production, or sex steroid \nhormone action for a male or female. \n(c)  A violation of this section is a Class C felony. \nSection 5\n, in broad terms, prohibits certain school \nemployees from withholding certain information about mi-\nnor students from their parents and from encouraging or \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 13 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 11 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  11 \ncoercing minor students to do the same.  The section reads \nas follows: \nNo nurse, counselor, teacher, principal, or other ad-\nministrative official at a public or private school at-\ntended by a minor shall do either of the following: \n(1)  Encourage or coerce a minor to withhold from \nthe minor’s parent or legal guardian the fact that the \nminor’s perception of his or her gender or sex is in-\nconsistent with the minor’s sex. \n(2)  Withhold from a minor’s parent or legal guard-\nian information related to a minor’s perception that \nhis or her gender or sex is inconsistent with his or her \nsex. \nSection 6\n clarifies that, except as provided for in section 4, \nnothing in the Act shall be construed as “limiting or preventing” \ncertain mental health professionals from “rendering the services \nfor which they are qualified by training or experience involving the \napplication of recognized principles, methods, and procedures of \nthe science and professional of psychology and counseling.”   \nSection 7 \nsimilarly clarifies that “[n]othing in this section \nshall be construed to establish a new or separate standard of care \nfor hospitals or physicians and their patients or otherwise modify, \namend, or supersede” certain other laws of the State of Alabama.   \nSection 8 \nis a severability clause.  It provides that, “[i]f any \npart, section, or subsection of [the Act] or the application thereof \nto any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity shall \nnot affect parts, sections, subsections, or applications of this act \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 14 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 12 of 59\n12  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nthat can be given effect without the invalid part, section, subsec-\n \ntion, or application.”  \nSection 9 \nclarifies that the Act “does not affect a right or \n \nduty afforded to a licensed pharmacist by state law.”  \nSection 10 \nclarifies that, “[a]lthough this bill would have as \nits purpose or effect the requirement of a new or increased ex-\npenditure of local funds,” it is “excluded from further require-\nments and application under  Amendment 621, as amended by \nAmendment 890 . . . because [it] defines a new crime or amends the \n \ndefinition of an existing crime.”  \nSection 11\n, the final section, establishes that the Act “shall \nbecome effective 30 days following its passage and approval by the \n \nGovernor, or its otherwise becoming law.”  \nB.  Procedural History \nOn April 19, 2022, a group of plaintiffs initiated this chal-\nlenge to the Act seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  The \ngroup consisted of transgender minors (the “Minor Plaintiffs”), the \nparents  of  those  transgender  minors  (the  “Parent  Plaintiffs”), \nhealthcare providers who regularly treat transgender youth (the \n“Provider Plaintiffs”), and Reverend Paul A. Eknes-Tucker, the Sen-\nior  Pastor  at  Pilgrim  Church  in  Birmingham,  Alabama,  who \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 15 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 13 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  13 \nfrequently counsels parents of transgender children (collectively, \n“Plaintiffs”).2   \nThe original complaint generally alleged that: (1) the Act vi-\nolates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by \ndepriving the Parent Plaintiffs of their right to direct the upbring-\ning of their children (Count I); (2) the Act violates the Equal Pro-\ntection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by discriminating \nagainst the Minor Plaintiffs on the bases of sex and transgender sta-\ntus (Count II); (3) the Act is preempted by section 1557 of the Af-\nfordable Care Act (Count III); (4)  the Act violates the Free Speech \nClause of the First Amendment (Count IV); and (5) the Act is void \nfor vagueness under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment (Count V).  That complaint named the Attorney Gen-\neral of Alabama and several state officials (collectively, “Alabama”) \nas defendants.3   \nTwo days later, Plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary in-\njunction, seeking a ruling preventing the enforcement of the Act in \nadvance of its May 8, 2022, effective date.4  In light of that request, \n \n2 Reverend Eknes-Tucker is not included as a plaintiff in the operative plead-\ning, the Second Amended Complaint, nor does he take part in this appeal. \n3 The original complaint also included Governor Ivey as a defendant, but the \nparties subsequently moved to dismiss her from the action on May 3, 2022, \npursuant to a joint understanding that she and her office would be bound by \nany forthcoming injunctive relief.  The district court granted that request.   \n4 The motion is styled as a “motion for a temporary restraining order and/or \npreliminary injunction.”  However, because Alabama received notice of the \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 16 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 14 of 59\n14  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nthe district court expedited the briefing schedule and scheduled a \nhearing for the first week of May.   \nOn April 29, 2022, the United States filed a motion to inter-\nvene, as well as its own motion for preliminary injunction similarly \nseeking to prevent enforcement of the Act.  Shortly thereafter, fif-\nteen states moved for leave to file an amicus brief in support of \nAlabama.  That was followed by a group of at least twenty-two \nprofessional medical and mental health organizations jointly mov-\ning for leave to file an amicus brief in support of Plaintiffs.  The \ndistrict court ultimately granted the motion to intervene and the \nmotions to file amicus briefs, giving the United States permission \nto participate in the preliminary injunction hearing and taking the \namicus briefs under advisement.   \nThe three-day hearing on Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary \ninjunction began on May 4, 2022.  On that first day, the district \ncourt discussed the motion for intervention and heard opening ar-\nguments from the parties.  At that time, Plaintiffs represented that \nthey were no longer challenging the portions of section 4 that ban \nsurgical intervention, i.e., subsections (a)(4)–(6), and were instead \nfocusing on the portions of section 4 that ban puberty blockers and \ncross-sex hormone treatment, i.e. subsections (a)(1)–(3).  The fol-\nlowing day, the parties commenced their presentation of the evi-\ndence.  \n \nrequest for injunctive relief, the motion subsequently was addressed only as a \nmotion for preliminary injunction.   \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 17 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 15 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  15 \nPlaintiffs first tendered Dr. Linda Hawkins and Dr. Morissa \nLadinsky as experts in the treatment of gender dysphoria in mi-\nnors.  Dr. Hawkins is the director of the Gender and Sexuality De-\nvelopment Clinic at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.  She \nhas specialized in treating LGBT youth for roughly twenty-two \nyears and worked with over 4,000 transgender youth.  During her \ntestimony, Dr. Hawkins defined “gender identity” as “the internal \nauthentic hardwired sense of one’s self as male or female.”  She \nfurther testified that a blanket prohibition on puberty blockers and \nhormone treatment would be “devastating” for transgender youth, \ncomparing it to “removing somebody’s cancer treatment and just \n \nexpecting them to be okay.”  \nDr. Ladinsky is an associate professor of pediatrics at the \nHeersink School of Medicine at the University of Alabama at Bir-\nmingham (“UAB”) and a board-certified pediatrician at the affili-\nated hospital.  Dr. Ladinsky opened a gender clinic at UAB in the \nfall of 2015 and, at the time of her testimony, had worked with an \nestimated 400 to 450 minors suffering from gender dysphoria.  Dr. \nLadinsky discussed the guidelines on the treatment of gender dys-\nphoria in youth that the UAB gender clinic follows and noted that \nthose guidelines are endorsed by the American Academy of Pedi-\natrics.  She also noted that consent forms must be signed by all legal \nparents  and  guardians  before  a  minor’s  hormonal  therapy  can \n \nbegin.  According toDr. Ladinsky, puberty blockers pose some risks \nbut, overall, are safe and reversible.  She described the risks posed \nby puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, related to fertility and \nsexual function, as “small side effect risks.”  Dr. Ladinsky also \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 18 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 16 of 59\n16  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \ntestified that the youngest minor for which she prescribed puberty \nblockers was an eleven-year-old female and that about 85 percent \nof her patients who have taken puberty blockers have gone on to \ntake cross-sex hormones.  In her opinion, it is “uncommon” for a \nminor patient taking puberty blockers to stop experiencing gender \ndysphoria and begin identifying with their biological sex.   \nPlaintiffs then called Megan Poe (one of the Parent Plain-\ntiffs), Dr. Rachel Koe (one of the Provider Plaintiffs), and Reverend \nEknes-Tucker to testify about their personal knowledge and expe-\nrience regarding gender dysphoria.   \nPoe is the mother of a biological male who identifies as a \nfemale.  When asked how her child presents as a female, Poe testi-\nfied that her child “is very over the top girly,” “loves makeup and \nhair,” and “[is] always worried about her clothes.”  The child began \nshowing signs of a female gender identity at the age of two, accord-\ning to Poe, by wanting girl toys and girl clothes.  The child started \npuberty blockers in sixth grade and then started hormone therapy \nat the age of fourteen.  Poe reported that her child now is “so \nhappy” and “thriving” and has not experienced any side effects \nfrom the treatment.  She insisted that her child is “definitely not \n[experiencing] a phase” and is “never going to grow out of this.”  \nPoe also said she was afraid that her child would commit suicide if \n \nthe treatments were no longer available.  \nDr. Koe is a pediatrician in southeast Alabama.  Dr. Koe re-\nported that she treats transgender adolescents but has never treated \na patient with gender dysphoria who later desisted or expressed \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 19 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 17 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  17 \nregret about receiving these types of treatments.  She also testified \nthat, if the Act takes effect, it will leave her “stuck in a place where \n[she doesn’t] know how to proceed” nor how to provide care for \npatients with gender dysphoria.   \nReverend  Eknes-Tucker  is  the  Senior  Pastor  at  Pilgrim \nChurch in Birmingham, Alabama, and has been a pastor for 45 \nyears.    Reverend  Eknes-Tucker  testified  that  there  have  been \ntransgender individuals in every congregation that he has served \nand that he has given advice to parents of transgender children on \nnumerous occasions.  He clarified that he has not given medical \nadvice but that he has helped connect parents of transgender chil-\ndren with doctors who provide gender-affirming care.   \nIn addition to this live testimony, Plaintiffs produced as evi-\ndence various organizational medical guidelines, sworn declara-\ntions, research articles, and other documents.   \nNext, the United States, as an intervenor on behalf of Plain-\ntiffs, tendered Dr. Armand H. Antommaria as an expert in bioethics \nand treatment protocols for adolescents suffering from gender dys-\nphoria.  Dr. Antommaria is the chair of pediatric ethics and an at-\ntending physician at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center.    \nDuring his testimony, Dr. Antommaria addressed the dearth of ran-\ndomized controlled trials for the treatment of minors with puberty \nblockers and cross-sex hormone therapy and expressed his concern \nthat such trials “would be unethical,” given the lack of confidence \nthat the control group and the experimental group would receive \nequally efficacious treatment.  He also expressed concern that any \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 20 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 18 of 59\n18  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nsuch trials “would have substantial methodological limitations,” \ngiven the need to recruit enough participants and conduct a blind \nstudy.  When asked for his opinion regarding the ability of parents \nand adolescents to adequately understand and give informed con-\nsent to the provision of puberty blockers and hormone therapy, Dr. \nAntommaria answered that those treatments are “comparable to \nother decisions that parents and their children make in pediatric \nhealthcare on a frequent basis.”  He further testified that there are \nno equally effective alternative medical treatments for adolescents \nwith gender dysphoria and that there is not an ethical basis for dis-\ntinguishing between minors experiencing precocious puberty5 and \nminors experiencing gender dysphoria with respect to the provi-\nsion of puberty blockers and hormone treatment.   \nAlong with Dr. Antommaria’s testimony, the United States \npresented, among other things, various organizations’ medical pol-\nicy statements and guidelines, some research and news articles, and \nDr. Antommaria’s declaration and curriculum vitae.  For example, \nthe United States presented the Standards of Care of the World \nProfessional  Association  for  Transgender  Health  (“WPATH”), \nwhich endorse the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormone \ntreatment for minors when certain criteria are met.  The United \nStates also offered statements by the Alabama Psychological Asso-\nciation and the American Academy of Pediatrics supporting the use \nof puberty blockers and cross-sex hormone treatment for minors \nand opposing the Act.  The full record reveals that at least twenty-\n \n5 Precocious puberty is the premature initiation of puberty.   \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 21 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 19 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  19 \ntwo professional medical and mental health organizations support \nthe use of such medications.   \nOn cross-examination, Dr. Antommaria acknowledged that \n“[t]here are risks involved in the treatment course for the treatment \nof gender dysphoria.”  He went on to note that, for puberty block-\ners and cross-sex hormones generally, there is a risk of impaired \nfertility, and that, for estrogen therapy, there is a risk of change in \nsexual function.  When asked whether he agrees that more re-\nsearch is needed to study the efficacy and the costs and benefits of \ngender-affirming care, Dr. Antommaria responded that “more re-\nsearch is needed in all areas of health care.”   \nAlabama, for its part, first tendered Dr. James Cantor.  Dr. \nCantor is a clinical psychologist and neuroscientist who was called \nas an expert on psychology, human sexuality, research methodol-\nogy, and the state of research on gender dysphoria.  In response to \nDr. Antommaria’s testimony, Dr. Cantor confirmed that none of \nthe existing studies on puberty blockers and hormone therapies are \nrandomized and opined that there are alternative methodologies \nthat would be more reliable than observational trials, which he de-\nscribed as the lowest quality of evidence.  Dr. Cantor also testified \nthat the existing research does not support the conclusion that the \nuse of puberty blockers and hormone therapy is “the only safe and \neffective treatment for gender dysphoria.”  In his opinion, gender \ndysphoria  can  be  treated  with  a  “watchful  waiting  approach” \nwhereby decisions about medical interventions are withheld, but \ntherapy is continued, until more information becomes available.    \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 22 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 20 of 59\n20  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nAccording to Dr. Cantor, clinical guidelines suggest that comorbid-\nities, including mental health issues, should be resolved prior to \npursuing puberty blockers and cross-sex hormone treatment.  He \nalso noted that some cases of gender dysphoria have turned out to \nbe prepubescent children misinterpreting their same-sex attraction \nand that blocking puberty in such cases prevents those children \nfrom understanding their sexuality.   \nOn cross-examination, Dr. Cantor acknowledged that he is \nnot  a  medical  doctor  and  that  he  has  not  provided  care  to \ntransgender adolescents under the age of sixteen.   \nAlabama then called Sydney Wright to testify about her per-\nsonal experience with gender dysphoria.  Wright is a biological fe-\nmale who is married to another woman.  At the time of her testi-\nmony, Wright was twenty-three years old.  She testified that she \nbegan identifying as transgender and receiving related treatment \nwhen she was seventeen years old, which culminated in testos-\nterone therapy for approximately one year when she was nineteen \nyears old.  According to Wright, the testosterone treatment put her \nat a greater risk of heart attack or stroke and caused her to develop \ntachycardia.  She explained that, after a significant discussion with \nher grandfather, she stopped identifying as transgender and receiv-\ning testosterone therapy.  She now believes that her doctors mis-\nhandled her treatment and that she simply needed counseling dur-\ning her teenage years.  She also reported that her digestive system \nis “still messed up” and that she may have fertility issues as a result \nof the testosterone therapy that she received over three-and-a-half \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 23 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 21 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  21 \nyears earlier.  When asked what she would tell a young person \nstruggling with gender dysphoria, Wright stated that she would ad-\nvise them to take “a lot of time,” “love [themselves],” and under-\nstand that they can act and dress like the opposite sex without \n \n“hav[ing] to transition.”  \nIn  addition  to  these  two  witnesses,  Alabama  produced, \namong other things, research papers, foreign countries’ medical \nguidelines, and the declarations of various healthcare professionals \nand individuals with experience related to gender dysphoria.  For \nexample, in terms of healthcare professionals, Alabama produced \na declaration in which Dr. Quentin L. Van Meter6 states that com-\nparing the use of puberty blockers for precocious puberty with the \nuse of puberty blockers for gender dysphoria is like “comparing \napples to oranges,” given the evidence that “normal bone density \ncan’t be fully reestablished” in the latter case and the lack of long-\nterm data on bone, gonad, and brain health.  Alabama also pro-\nduced a declaration in which Dr. Patrick Hunter7 attests that “there \nis currently no established standard of care for transgender-identi-\nfied youth” and that “[t]he medical risks of ‘gender-affirming’ in-\nterventions are substantial.”  In terms of individuals with personal \nexperience related to gender dysphoria, Alabama produced the \n \n6 Dr. Van Meter is a board-certified pediatrician and pediatric endocrinologist \nwho currently works in private practice.  \n7 Dr. Hunter is a board-certified pediatrician with a master’s degree in bioeth-\nics who currently holds academic positions at the University of Central Florida \nand Florida State University.  \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 24 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 22 of 59\n22  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \ndeclaration of Corinna Cohn, a biological male who underwent sex \nreassignment surgery at the age of nineteen—which included the \nremoval of testicles, penectomy, and vaginoplasty—and who, look-\ning back, claims to have been “unprepared to understand the con-\n  \nsequences” of seeking such medical interventions as a teenager.  \nAlabama also produced a declaration in which Carol Freitas, a bio-\nlogical  female  who  previously  experienced  gender  dysphoria, \nclaims that “[transitioning] was the biggest mistake [that she] ever \nmade” and that she instead should have been treated for depression \nand post-traumatic stress disorder related to her “internalized hom-\nophobia and childhood abuse.”  Lastly, in terms of medical opin-\nions from foreign countries, Alabama produced documents show-\ning that public healthcare entities of Sweden, Finland, France, Aus-\ntralia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom have raised concerns \nabout the risks associated with puberty blockers and cross-sex hor-\nmone treatment and supported greater caution and/or more re-\nstrictive criteria in connection with such interventions.   \n \nOn May 13, 2022, the district court granted in part and de-\nnied in part the motions for preliminary injunction, enjoining Ala-\nbama from enforcing section 4(a)(1)–(3) but allowing the rest of the \nAct to remain in effect.  The ruling was based on, among other \nthings, a determination that Plaintiffs had shown a substantial like-\nlihood of success on the merits as to their substantive due process \nclaim and equal protection claim (Counts I and II), but not as to \ntheir other claims.  With respect to the substantive due process \nclaim (Count I), the district court recognized a fundamental right \nof parents to “treat their children with transitioning medications \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 25 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 23 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  23 \nsubject to medically accepted standards,” held that the Act infringes \nupon that fundamental right and concluded that Alabama had not \nsufficiently  demonstrated  that  the  Act  is  narrowly  tailored  to \nachieve a compelling state interest.  With respect to the equal pro-\ntection  claim  (Count  II),  the  district  court  held  that  the  Act \n“amounts to a sex-based classification” and concluded that Ala-\nbama had not proffered a sufficiently persuasive justification for \nthat classification. \n  Alabama filed a timely notice of appeal on May 16, 2022.8   \nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \n“We review the grant of a preliminary injunction for abuse \nof discretion, reviewing any underlying legal conclusions de novo \nand any findings of fact for clear error.”  Gonzalez v. Governor of \nGeorgia, 978 F.3d 1266, 1270 (11th Cir. 2020).  “A district court \nabuses its discretion if it applies an incorrect legal standard, applies \nthe law in an unreasonable or incorrect manner, follows improper \nprocedures in making a determination, or makes findings of fact \nthat are clearly erroneous.”  Id. (quoting United States v. Estrada, 969 \nF.3d 1245, 1261 (11th Cir. 2020)). \nIII.  ANALYSIS \nA district court may grant injunctive relief only if the mov-\ning party demonstrates that: “(1) it has a substantial likelihood of \n \n8 The operative pleading—the second amended complaint—was filed on Sep-\ntember 19, 2022.  In terms of counts, the second amended complaint contains \nonly the substantive due process claim and the equal protection claim. \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 26 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 24 of 59\n24  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nsuccess on the merits; (2) irreparable injury will be suffered unless \nthe injunction issues; (3) the threatened injury to the movant out-\nweighs whatever damage the proposed injunction may cause the \nopposing party; and (4) if issued, the injunction would not be ad-\nverse to the public interest.”  Siegel v. LePore, 234 F.3d 1163, 1176 \n(11th Cir. 2000) (en banc).  “In considering these four prerequisites, \n[courts] must remember that a preliminary injunction is an extraor-\ndinary and drastic remedy which should not be granted unless the \nmovant clearly carries the burden of persuasion” as to these four \nprerequisites.  Canal Auth. v. Callaway, 489 F.2d 567, 573 (5th Cir. \n1974); accord Siegel, 234 F.3d at 1176.9 \nAs previewed, the district court determined that these four \nprerequisites are met with respect to section 4(a)(1)–(3) and thus \nenjoined Alabama from enforcing that part of the Act.  The district \ncourt dedicated the bulk of its analysis in the preliminary injunction \norder to the first prerequisite and ultimately found that Plaintiffs \nhad established a substantial likelihood of success as to their sub-\nstantive due process claim and equal protection claim.  Because the \nparties’ arguments on appeal similarly focus on the likelihood-of-\nsuccess prerequisite, we do the same.  We begin with the substan-\ntive due process claim and then turn to the equal protection claim. \nA. Substantive Due Process \n \n9 In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), \nthis Court adopted as precedent the decisions of the former Fifth Circuit ren-\ndered prior to October 1, 1981. \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 27 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 25 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  25 \n  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment pro-\nvides that no state shall “deprive any person of life, liberty, or prop-\nerty, without due process of law.”  U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1.  \nThe Supreme Court has held that this language guarantees both \nprocedural and substantive rights.  Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health \nOrg., 142 S. Ct. 2228, 2246 (2022).  Those substantive rights include \na  “great  majority”  of  the  rights  guaranteed  by  the  first  eight \nAmendments vis-à-vis the federal government, as well as “a select \nlist of fundamental rights that are not mentioned anywhere in the \nConstitution.”  Id.; see also McDonald v. City of Chicago, 561 U.S. 742, \n760–66 (2010) (reviewing the history of the Supreme Court’s incor-\nporation of “almost all of the provisions of the Bill of Rights” \nagainst the States). \nTo determine whether a right at issue is one of the substan-\ntive rights guaranteed by the Due Process Clause, courts must look \nto whether the right is “deeply rooted in [our] history and tradi-\ntion” and “essential to our Nation’s ‘scheme of ordered liberty.’”  \nDobbs, 142 S. Ct. at 2246 (alteration in original) (quoting Timbs v. \nIndiana, 139 S. Ct. 682, 687 (2019)).  The outcome of this analysis \ndetermines the amount of leeway that states have to enact laws \nthat infringe upon the right at issue.  “Laws that burden the exer-\ncise of a fundamental right require strict scrutiny and are sustained \nonly if narrowly tailored to further a compelling government inter-\nest.”  Lofton v. Sec’y of Dep’t of Child. & Fam. Servs., 358 F.3d 804, 815 \n(11th Cir. 2004).  Conversely, laws that do not burden the exercise \nof a fundamental right (and do not discriminate against a suspect \nclass under the Equal Protection Clause) are subject to rational \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 28 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 26 of 59\n26  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nbasis review and need only “be rationally related to a legitimate \ngovernmental interest.”  Jones v. Governor of Florida, 950 F.3d 795, \n809 (11th Cir. 2020).  Although not “toothless,” rational basis re-\nview is “highly deferential to government action.”  Id. (quoting \nSchweiker v. Wilson, 450 U.S. 221, 234 (1981)). \nIn other words, every time a court recognizes an asserted \nright as a fundamental right protected by the Constitution, the \ncourt, “to a great extent, place[s] the matter outside the arena of \npublic debate and legislative action.” Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 \nU.S. 702, 720 (1997).  For that reason, the Supreme Court has in-\nstructed courts addressing substantive due process claims to “en-\ngage[] in a careful analysis of the history of the right at issue” and \nbe “‘reluctant’ to recognize rights that are not mentioned in the \nConstitution.”  Dobbs, 142 S. Ct. at 2246–47 (quoting Collins v. \nHarker Heights, 503 U.S. 115, 125 (1992)). \n  In this case, the district court determined that the “right to \ntreat  [one’s]  children  with  transitioning  medications  subject  to \nmedically accepted standards” is one of the substantive rights guar-\nanteed by the Due Process Clause and that, therefore, section \n4(a)(1)–(3) is subject to strict scrutiny.  But the use of these medica-\ntions in general—let alone for children—almost certainly is not \n“deeply rooted” in our nation’s history and tradition.

Laurence  Michael  Dillon,  formerly \nknown as Laura Maud Dillon, began receiving testosterone treatment for pur-\nposes of treating the discordance between biological sex and sense of gender \nidentity in 1939 and is thought by some to be the first biological female to \nreceive such treatment.

United States, 871 F.3d 1260, 1269–70 (11th Cir. 2017) \n(rejecting the notion that the Constitution protects a right to pro-\ncreate via in vitro fertilization procedures based on the fact that \nsuch procedures are “decidedly modern phenomena” that did not \ncome about until 1978). \nRather than perform any historical inquiry specifically tied \nto the particular alleged right at issue, the order on appeal instead \nsurmises that the “right to treat [one’s] children with transitioning \nmedications subject to medically accepted standards” falls under \nthe broader, recognized fundamental right to “make decisions con-\ncerning the care, custody, and control of [one’s] children.” E.g., \nTroxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 66 (2000); Lofton, 358 F.3d at 812.  \nBut see Morrissey, 871 F.3d at 1269 (emphasizing that a substantive \ndue process analysis must focus on the specific right asserted, ra-\nther than simply rely on a related general right).  However, there \nis no binding authority that indicates that the general right to \n“make  decisions  concerning  the  care,  custody,  and  control  of \n \ntreatment for gender dysphoria “[i]n the second half of the 20th century.”  \nDoc. 78-17 at 14. \n13 See Lawrence B.

Rev. 1, 6–7 (2015) (“[T]he original meaning \n(‘communicative content’) of the constitutional text is fixed at the time each \nprovision is framed and ratified.”). \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 31 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 29 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  29 \n[one’s] children” includes the right to give one’s children puberty \nblockers and cross-sex hormone treatment. \nThe fundamental right to “make decisions concerning the \ncare, custody, and control of [one’s] children,” as it is recognized \ntoday, traces back in large part to Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 \n(1923).  There, the Supreme Court held that a Nebraska law re-\nstricting the teaching of foreign languages violated the Due Process \nClause.  Id. at 400–03.  In doing so, the Court recognized that the \n“liberty” guaranteed by the Due Process Clause includes the right \n“to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire \nuseful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring up children, . . . \nand generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized at common \nlaw as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness of free men.”  \nId. at 399 (emphasis added). \nThe Supreme Court elaborated on the fundamental liberty \nof parents two years later in Pierce v. Society of the Sisters of the Holy \nNames of Jesus & Mary, 268 U.S. 510 (1925).  That case addressed \nOregon’s Compulsory Education Act of 1922, which mandated \nthat parents send their school-aged children to public school (as op-\nposed to private school).  Id. at 530–31.  Citing its decision in Meyer, \nthe Court concluded that the Oregon law violated the Due Process \nClause on the basis that it “unreasonably interferes with the liberty \nof parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of chil-\ndren under their control.”  Id. at 534–35 (emphasis added). \nMeyer and Pierce ushered in a line of Supreme Court deci-\nsions that recognized, and further defined the contours of, parents’ \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 32 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 30 of 59\n30  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nliberty interest to control the upbringing of their children.14  The \nmajority of those cases, however, pertain to issues of education, \nreligion, or custody.  The Supreme Court’s most extensive discus-\nsion of parents’ control over the medical treatment received by \ntheir children came in Parham v. J. R., 442 U.S. 584 (1979). \nIn Parham, a group of minors brought a Due Process chal-\nlenge to Georgia’s procedures for committing children to mental \nhospitals.  Id. at 587–88.  At the time, Georgia law provided for the \nvoluntary admission of children upon application by a parent or \n \n14 See, e.g., Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166–69 (1944) (recognizing that \n“the custody, care and nurture of [children] reside[s] first in the parents,” but \nnevertheless upholding Massachusetts child labor laws that restricted the abil-\nity of children to sell religious literature in accordance with their parents’ \nwishes based on the state’s “authority over children’s activities” and “the crip-\npling effects of child employment, more especially in public places” (footnote \nomitted)); Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 646–59 (1972) (holding that Illinois \ncould not automatically designate the children of unwed parents as wards of \nthe state upon the death of the mother because fathers of children born out of \nwedlock have a “cognizable and substantial” “interest in retaining custody of \n[their] children” under the Constitution); Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 213–\n234 (1972) (holding that Wisconsin could not compel school attendance be-\nyond the eighth grade because doing so would “grave[ly] interfere[] with im-\nportant Amish religious tenets” and “the traditional interest of parents with \nrespect to the religious upbringing of their children”); Troxel, 530 U.S. at 60–\n75 (striking down Washington’s nonparental visitation statute, which would \nhave permitted any person to petition for visitation rights at any time and \ncourts to grant such rights whenever in the best interest of the child, on the \nbasis that it contravened “the fundamental right of parents to make decisions \nconcerning the care, custody, and control of their children” and “the tradi-\ntional presumption that a fit parent will act in the best interest of his or her \nchild”). \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 33 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 31 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  31 \nguardian.  Id. at 590–91.  Thus, the question at issue was whether \nthe minors had a procedural due process right to greater procedural \nsafeguards, e.g., a judicial hearing, before their parents could com-\nmit them.  Id. at 610.  The Supreme Court concluded that “some \nkind of inquiry should be made by a ‘neutral factfinder’ to deter-\nmine whether the statutory requirements for admission are satis-\nfied,” but that the inquiry could be “informal,” e.g., conducted by \na staff physician, and did not require an adversarial proceeding with \na judicial or administrative officer.  Id. at 606–10.  “[R]equiring a \nformalized, factfinding hearing,” according to the Supreme Court, \nwould “[p]it[] the parents and the child” against each other and rep-\nresent a “significant intrusion into the parent-child relationship.”  \nId. at 610; see also id. (“It is one thing to require a neutral physician \nto make a careful review of the parents’ decision in order to make \nsure it is proper from a medical standpoint; it is a wholly different \nmatter to employ an adversary contest to ascertain whether the \nparents’ motivation is consistent with the child’s interests.”).  In so \nruling, the Supreme Court recognized, as a general matter, that \n“[m]ost children, even in adolescence, simply are not able to make \nsound judgments concerning many decisions, including their need \nfor medical care or treatment,” id. at 603, and that parents retain \n“plenary authority” as well as “a substantial, if not the dominant, \nrole” in deciding to pursue lawfully available treatment, like insti-\ntutionalization, for their children, id. at 604; see also id. at 609 (con-\ncerning “treatment that is provided by the state”).

Bendi-\nburg, 909 F.2d at 466. \n17 It bears emphasizing that Bendiburg dealt with a situation wherein a State \ninterfered with a single parent’s ability to refuse certain lawful medical treat-\nment for his child.  Id. at 466–67.  To the extent that Bendiberg supports the \nproposition that parents have a substantive due process right relating to the \nmedical treatment that their children receive, its reasoning is not equally ap-\nplicable to situations involving parents’ ability to affirmatively obtain certain \nmedical treatment for their children that the State prohibits. \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 36 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 34 of 59\n34  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \naccepted standards.”  Instead, some of these cases recognize, at a \nhigh level of generality, that there is a fundamental right to make \ndecisions concerning the “upbringing” and “care, custody, and con-\ntrol” of one’s children.  See Pierce, 268 U.S. at 534–35; Troxel, 530 \nU.S. at 66.  And those decisions applying the fundamental parental \nright in the context of medical decision-making do not establish \nthat parents have a derivative fundamental right to obtain a partic-\nular medical treatment for their children as long as a critical mass \nof medical professionals approve.  Moreover, all of the cases deal-\ning with the fundamental parental right reflect the common thread \nthat states properly may limit the authority of parents where “it \nappears that parental decisions will jeopardize the health or safety \nof the child, or have a potential for significant social burdens.”  Wis-\nconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 233–34 (1972); see also Prince v. Massa-\nchusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 168–69 (1944); Parham, 442 U.S. at 604; Ben-\ndiburg, 909 F.2d at 470.  Against this backdrop, and without any his-\ntorical analysis specifically tied to the medications at issue, Plaintiffs \nhave not shown it to be likely that the Due Process Clause of the \nConstitution guarantees a fundamental “right to treat [one’s] chil-\ndren with transitioning medications subject to medically accepted \nstandards.”18  See L.W. v. Skrmetti, 73 F.4th 408, 416–17 (6th Cir.

Ct. at 2284 (quoting Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. \n312, 319 (1993)).  “Under this deferential standard,” the question \nthat we ask “is simply whether the challenged legislation is ration-\nally related to a legitimate state interest.”  Lofton, 358 F.3d at 818.  \nSuch a relationship may merely “be based on rational speculation” \nand need not be supported “by evidence or empirical data.”  FCC v. \nBeach Commc’ns, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 315 (1993); accord Jones, 950 F.3d \nat 809 (“When we review a statute for rationality, generally we ask \nwhether there is any rational basis for the law, even if the govern-\nment's proffered explanation is irrational, and even if it fails to offer \nany explanation at all.”).   \nWe are highly doubtful that section 4(a)(1)–(3) would not \nsurvive the lenient standard that is rational basis review.  It is well \nestablished that states have a compelling interest in “safeguarding \nthe physical and psychological well-being of . . . minor[s].”  Otto v. \nCity of Boca Raton, 981 F.3d 854, 868 (11th Cir. 2020) (quoting New \nYork v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 756–57 (1982)).  In the same vein, states \nhave  a  compelling  interest  in  protecting  children  from  drugs, \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 38 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 36 of 59\n36  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nparticularly those for which there is uncertainty regarding benefits, \nrecent surges in use, and irreversible effects.19  Although rational \nspeculation is itself sufficient to survive rational basis review, here \nAlabama relies on both record evidence and rational speculation to \nestablish that section 4(a)(1)–(3) is rationally related to that compel-\nling state interest.  First, the record evidence is undisputed that the \nmedications at issue present some risks.  As the district court recog-\nnized, these medications can cause “loss of fertility and sexual func-\ntion.”  The district court also acknowledged testimony that “sev-\neral European countries have restricted treating minors with tran-\nsitioning medications due to growing concern about the medica-\ntions’ risks.”  Second, there is at least rational speculation that some \nfamilies will not fully appreciate those risks and that some minors \nexperiencing gender dysphoria ultimately will desist and identify \nwith their biological sex.  Section 4(a)(1)–(3) addresses these risks \nby  prohibiting  the  prescription  and  administration  of  puberty \nblockers and cross-sex hormone treatment to a patient under the \nage of nineteen for purposes of treating discordance between bio-\nlogical sex and sense of gender identity so that children will have \nmore time to develop their identities and to consider all of the \n \n19 As Alabama suggests, the opioid epidemic has shown firsthand the need to \nbe skeptical and exercise caution when there is a sudden uptick in prescriptions \nof powerful, off-label medications, even when some medical and pharmaceu-\ntical organizations defend their safety.  See also Skrmetti, 73 F.4th at 418 (“[I]t is \ndifficult to maintain that the medical community is of one mind about the use \nof hormone therapy for gender dysphoria when the FDA is not prepared to \nput its credibility and careful testing protocols behind the use.”). \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 39 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 37 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  37 \npotential consequences before moving forward with such treat-\nments.  That connection would be sufficient under rational basis \nreview. \nIn sum, Plaintiffs’ assertion that the Constitution protects \nthe right to treat one’s children with puberty blockers and cross-\nsex hormone therapy is precisely the sort of claim that asks courts \nto “break new ground in [the] field [of Substantive Due Process]” \nand therefore ought to elicit the “utmost care” from the judiciary.  \nSee Collins, 503 U.S. at 125.  The district court held that there is a \nspecific right under the Constitution “to treat [one’s] children with \ntransitioning medications subject to medically accepted standards,” \nbut did so without performing any analysis of whether that specific \nright is deeply rooted in our nation’s history and tradition.  Instead, \nthe district court grounded its ruling in an unprecedented interpre-\ntation of parents’ fundamental right to make decisions concerning \nthe “upbringing” and “care, custody, and control” of one’s chil-\ndren.  See Pierce, 268 U.S. at 534–35; Troxel, 530 U.S. at 66.  That was \nerror.  Neither the record nor any binding authority establishes that \nthe “right to treat [one’s] children with transitioning medications \nsubject to medically accepted standards” is a fundamental right \nprotected by the Constitution.  And, assuming it is not, then section \n4(a)(1)–(3) is subject only to rational basis review—a lenient stand-\nard that the law seems to undoubtedly clear.  Because the district \ncourt erroneously reviewed section 4(a)(1)–(3) with heightened \nscrutiny, its determination regarding the Parent Plaintiffs’ likeli-\nhood of success does not justify the preliminary injunction. \nB.

XIV, § 1.  The Equal Protection \nClause is “essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated \nshould be treated alike,” City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 \nU.S. 432, 439 (1985), and “simply keeps governmental decisionmak-\ners from treating differently persons who are in all relevant respects \nalike,” Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1, 10 (1992). \n“In considering whether state legislation violates the Equal \nProtection Clause . . . we apply different levels of scrutiny to differ-\nent types of classifications.”  Clark v. Jeter, 486 U.S. 456, 461 (1988).  \nAll statutory classifications must, at a minimum, satisfy rational ba-\nsis review.  Id.  Classifications based on race or national origin, \nhowever, are reviewed under the “most exacting” level of scrutiny: \nstrict scrutiny.  Id.  Between rational basis review and strict scrutiny \nlies “a level of intermediate scrutiny,” which applies to classifica-\ntions based on sex or illegitimacy.  Id. \nThus, a government policy that distinguishes on the basis of \nsex is permissible under the Equal Protection Clause “only if it sat-\nisfies intermediate scrutiny.”  Adams ex rel. Kasper v. Sch. Bd. of St. \nJohns Cnty., 57 F.4th 791, 801 (11th Cir. 2022).  Under that standard, \nthe party seeking to uphold the policy carries the burden of “show-\ning that the [sex-based] classification serves ‘important governmen-\ntal objectives and that the discriminatory means employed’ are \n‘substantially  related  to  the  achievement  of  those  objectives.’”  \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 41 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 39 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  39 \nMiss. Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 724 (1982) (quoting \nWengler v. Druggists Mut. Ins. Co., 446 U.S. 142, 150 (1980)). \n“For a government objective to be important, it cannot ‘rely \non overbroad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, \nor preferences of males and females.’”  Adams, 57 F.4th at 801 (quot-\ning United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996)).  And for a \npolicy’s means to be substantially related to a government objec-\ntive, there must be “enough of a fit” between the means and the \nasserted justification.  Id. (quoting Danskine v. Mia. Dade Fire Dep’t, \n253 F.3d 1288, 1299 (11th Cir. 2001)).  However, “the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause does not demand a perfect fit between means and ends \nwhen it comes to sex.”  Id.; see also Nguyen v. INS, 533 U.S. 53, 70 \n(2001) (“None of our gender-based classification equal protection \ncases have required that the [policy] under consideration must be \ncapable of achieving its ultimate objective in every instance.”). \nIn this case, the district court first held that section 4(a)(1)–\n(3) of the Act classifies on the basis of gender nonconformity and \ntherefore classifies on the basis of sex.  In determining that section \n4(a)(1)–(3) classifies on the basis of gender nonconformity, the dis-\ntrict court reasoned that section 4(a)(1)–(3) “prohibits transgender \nminors—and only transgender minors—from taking transitioning \nmedications due to their gender nonconformity.”  And, in holding \nthat a classification on the basis of gender nonconformity neces-\nsarily constitutes a classification on the basis of sex, the district \ncourt cited the reasoning of Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. \n1731 (2020), and Glenn v. Brumby, 663 F.3d 1312 (11th Cir. 2011).   \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 42 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 40 of 59\n40  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nAfter  determining  that  section  4(a)(1)–(3)  of  the  Act \namounts to a sex-based classification subject to intermediate scru-\ntiny, the district court then found that Alabama had not offered any \nexceedingly persuasive justification for the classification and thus \nconcluded that that the Minor Plaintiffs are substantially likely to \nsucceed on their equal protection claim.   \nOn appeal, Alabama maintains that section 4(a)(1)–(3) classi-\nfies on the bases of age and procedure, not sex or gender noncon-\nformity, and is therefore not subject to any heightened scrutiny \nabove rational basis review.  See Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, \n470 (1991) (“[A]ge is not a suspect classification under the Equal \nProtection Clause.”); Clark, 486 U.S. at 461 (listing suspect classifi-\ncations and making no reference to classifications based on proce-\ndures).  Alabama further argues that section 4(a)(1)–(3) would sur-\nvive at any level of scrutiny because it “serves the compelling \n[state] interest of protecting children from unproven, life-altering \nmedical interventions” and because “no other approach would of-\n \nfer children in Alabama adequate protection.”  \nIn response, the Minor Plaintiffs argue that section 4(a)(1)–\n(3) classifies on the basis of sex both directly, by using sex-based \nterms, and indirectly, by classifying on the basis of gender noncon-\nformity, and that the district court therefore properly applied inter-\nmediate scrutiny.  The Minor Plaintiffs also argue that, even if the \nmore lenient rational basis standard applies, section 4(a)(1)–(3) does \nnot pass muster.  For its part, the United States makes the argument \nthat section 4(a)(1)–(3) “triggers heightened scrutiny” because it \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 43 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 41 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  41 \n”discriminates against transgender persons, who constitute at least \na quasi-suspect class” by themselves, distinct from sex.   \nHaving carefully considered all of these positions, we agree \nwith Alabama that section 4(a)(1)–(3) is best understood as a law \nthat targets specific medical interventions for minors, not one that \nclassifies on the basis of any suspect characteristic under the Equal \nProtection Clause.  Section 4(a)(1)–(3) is therefore subject only to \nrational basis review—a standard that it almost undoubtedly satis-\nfies  for  the  reasons  discussed.    See supra  Section  III.A;  see also \nSkrmetti, 73 F.4th at 419 (finding it “highly unlikely” that the plain-\ntiffs could show that Tennessee’s substantially similar law “lacks a \nrational basis”).  Because the district court erroneously departed \nfrom that standard, its assessment regarding the Minor Plaintiffs’ \nlikelihood of success as to their equal protection claim cannot sup-\nport the preliminary injunction.  We reason as follows. \nTo  begin,  we  reject  the  view  that  section  4(a)(1)–(3) \namounts to a sex-based classification subject to intermediate scru-\ntiny.  As mentioned, one of the Minor Plaintiffs’ arguments is that \nsection 4(a)(1)–(3) directly classifies on the basis of sex because it \n“uses explicitly sex-based terms to criminalize certain treatments \n \nbased on a minor’s ‘sex.’”  Of course, section 4(a)(1)–(3) discusses \nsex insofar as it generally addresses treatment for discordance be-\ntween biological sex and gender identity, and insofar as it identifies \nthe applicable cross-sex hormone(s) for each sex—estrogen for \nmales and testosterone and other androgens for females.  We \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 44 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 42 of 59\n42  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nnonetheless believe the statute does not discriminate based on sex \nfor two reasons. \nFirst, the statute does not establish an unequal regime for \nmales and females.  In the Supreme Court’s leading precedent on \ngender-based intermediate scrutiny under the Equal Protection \nClause, the Court held that heightened scrutiny applies to “official \naction that closes a door or denies opportunity to women (or to \nmen).”  Virginia, 518 U.S. at 532.  Alabama’s law does not distin-\nguish between men and women in such a way.  Cf. Adams, 57 F.4th \nat 800–11.  Instead, section 4(a)(1)–(3) establishes a rule that applies \nequally to both sexes: it restricts the prescription and administra-\ntion of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormone treatment for pur-\nposes of treating discordance between biological sex and sense of \ngender identity for all minors.  See Skrmetti, 73 F.4th at 419 (explain-\ning that this sort of restriction on puberty blockers and cross-sex \nhormone treatment “does not prefer one sex to the detriment of \nthe other”).   \nSecond, the statute refers to sex only because the medical \nprocedures that it regulates—puberty blockers and cross-sex hor-\nmones as a treatment for gender dysphoria—are themselves sex-\nbased.  The Act regulates medical interventions to treat an incon-\ngruence between one’s biological sex and one’s perception of one’s \nsex.  The cross-sex hormone treatments for gender dysphoria are \ndifferent for males and for females because of biological differences \nbetween males and females—females are given testosterone and \nmales are given estrogen.  With regards to puberty blockers, those \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 45 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 43 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  43 \nmedications inhibit and suppress the production of testosterone in \nmales and estrogen in females.  For that reason, it is difficult to im-\nagine how a state might regulate the use of puberty blockers and \ncross-sex hormones for the relevant purposes in specific terms with-\nout referencing sex in some way.  Thus, we do not find the direct \nsex-classification argument to be persuasive. \nThe Minor Plaintiffs’ other sex-based argument is that sec-\ntion 4(a)(1)–(3) indirectly classifies on the basis of sex by classifying \non the basis of gender nonconformity.  This is the position that the \ndistrict court adopted, citing Bostock and Brumby.  Neither of those \ncases, however, dealt with the Equal Protection Clause as applied \nto laws regulating medical treatments.   \nBostock dealt with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \n§ 701 et seq., as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., in the context of \nemployment discrimination.  See 140 S. Ct. at 1737–41, 1754 (hold-\ning that “[a]n employer who fires an individual merely for being \ngay or transgender defies [Title VII]”).  After noting that “only the \nwords on the page constitute the law adopted by Congress and ap-\nproved by the President,” id. at 1738, the Court in Bostock relied \nexclusively on the specific text of Title VII.  The Court “pro-\nceed[ed] on the assumption that ‘sex’ . . . refer[s] only to biological \ndistinctions between male and female.” Id. at 1739.  But the Court \nreasoned that the combined ordinary meaning of the words “be-\ncause of,” id., “otherwise . . . discriminate against,” id. at 1740, and \n“individual,” id., led to the conclusion that Title VII makes “[a]n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 46 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 44 of 59\n44  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nindividual's homosexuality or transgender status . . . not relevant \nto employment decisions,” id. at 1741.  \nThe Equal Protection Clause contains none of the text that \nthe Court interpreted in Bostock.  It provides simply that “[n]o State \nshall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protec-\ntion of the laws.”  U.S. Const. amend XIV.  Because Bostock there-\nfore concerned a different law (with materially different language) \nand a different factual context, it bears minimal relevance to the \ninstant case.  See Skrmetti, 73 F.4th at 420 (finding that the reasoning \nof Bostock “applies only to Title VII”); see also Brandt ex rel. Brandt v. \nRutledge, No. 21-2875, 2022 WL 16957734, at *1 n.1 (8th Cir. Nov. \n16, 2022) (Stras, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (ex-\npressing skepticism that Bostock’s reasoning applies to the Equal \nProtection  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  because  the \nFourteenth Amendment “predates Title VII by nearly a century” \nand contains language that is “not similar in any way” to Title \nVII’s); see Students for Fair Admissions, Inc., v. President & Fellows of \nHarvard Coll., 143 S. Ct. 2141, 2220 (2023) (Gorsuch, J., concurring) \n(noting the different language in Title VI and the Equal Protection \nClause and explaining “[t]hat such differently worded provisions \nshould mean the same thing is implausible on its face.”) \nBrumby, on the other hand, did deal with the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause; but, like Bostock, Brumby concerned gender stereotyp-\ning in the context of employment discrimination.  See 663 F.3d at \n1313–20 (holding that “a government agent violates the Equal Pro-\ntection Clause’s prohibition of sex-based discrimination when he \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 47 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 45 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  45 \nor she fires a transgender or transsexual employee because of his or \nher gender non-conformity”).  So, while Brumby did involve the \nsame law at issue here—the Equal Protection Clause—it discussed \nthat law as applied to a particular factual scenario, i.e., one where \nan employer fired an employee for failing to adhere to certain ex-\npectations and stereotypes associated with the employee’s sex.  \nThat is not the scenario presented here.  Section 4(a)(1)–(3) targets \ncertain medical interventions for minors meant to treat the condi-\ntion of gender dysphoria; it does not further any particular gender \nstereotype.  Insofar as section 4(a)(1)–(3) involves sex, it simply re-\nflects biological differences between males and females, not stere-\notypes associated with either sex. \nTo be sure, section 4(a)(1)–(3) restricts a specific course of \nmedical treatment that, by the nature of things, only gender non-\nconforming individuals may receive.  But just last year, the Su-\npreme Court explained that “[t]he regulation of a medical proce-\ndure that only one sex can undergo does not trigger heightened \nconstitutional scrutiny unless the regulation is a ‘mere pretex[t] de-\nsigned to effect an invidious discrimination against members of one \nsex or the other.’”  Dobbs, 142 S. Ct. at 2245–46 (alteration in origi-\nnal) (quoting Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 U.S. 484, 496 n.20 (1974)); see \nalso id. at 2246 (recognizing that “the ‘goal of preventing abortion’ \ndoes  not  constitute  ‘invidiously  discriminatory  animus’  against \nwomen” (quoting Bray v. Alexandria Women’s Health Clinic, 506 U.S. \n263, 273–74 (1993))).  By the same token, the regulation of a course \nof treatment that only gender nonconforming individuals can un-\ndergo would not trigger heightened scrutiny unless the regulation \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 48 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 46 of 59\n46  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nwere a pretext for invidious discrimination against such individu-\nals.  And the district court did not find that Alabama’s law was \nbased on invidious discrimination.  \nWe  similarly  reject  the  United  States’  view  that  section \n4(a)(1)–(3) is subject to heightened scrutiny because it classifies on \nthe basis of transgender status, separate from sex.  As we recently \nexplained, “we have grave ‘doubt’ that transgender persons consti-\ntute a quasi-suspect class,” distinct from sex, under the Equal Pro-\ntection Clause.  Adams, 57 F.4th at 803 n.5.  Even if they did, for the \nreasons discussed with respect to gender nonconformity, section \n4(a)(1)–(3)’s relationship to transgender status would not trigger \nheightened scrutiny.  Chiefly, the regulation of a course of treat-\nment that, by the nature of things, only transgender individuals \nwould want to undergo would not trigger heightened scrutiny un-\nless the regulation is a pretext for invidious discrimination against \nsuch individuals, and, here, the district court made no findings of \nsuch a pretext.  For these reasons, we conclude that section 4(a)(1)–\n(3)’s relationship to transgender status does not warrant height-\nened scrutiny. \nApart from sex, gender nonconformity, and transgender sta-\ntus, the Minor Plaintiffs and the United States do not claim any \nother  suspect  classification.    All  the  parties  agree  that  section \n4(a)(1)–(3) draws distinctions on the basis of age.  However, “age is \nnot a suspect classification under the Equal Protection Clause.”  \nKimel v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, 83 (2000).  As a result, \n“[s]tates may discriminate on the basis of age without offending the \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 49 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 47 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  47 \nFourteenth Amendment if the age classification in question is ra-\ntionally related to a legitimate state interest.”  Id.  And “[t]he ra-\ntionality commanded by the Equal Protection Clause does not re-\nquire States to match age distinctions and the legitimate interests \nthey serve with razorlike precision.”  Id.   \nHere, it seems abundantly clear that section 4(a)(1)–(3) clas-\nsifies on the basis of age in a way that is rationally related to a le-\ngitimate state interest.  As discussed, Alabama has a legitimate in-\nterest in “safeguarding the physical and psychological well-being of \n. . . minor[s],” and notably that interest itself distinguishes minors \nfrom adults.  Otto, 981 F.3d at 868 (quoting Ferber, 458 U.S. at 756–\n57); see supra Section III.A.  Section 4(a)(1)–(3) furthers that interest \nby restricting the prescription and administration of puberty block-\ners and cross-sex hormone treatment to minors for purposes of \ntreating discordance between biological sex and sense of gender \nidentity based on the rational understanding that many minors \nmay not be finished forming their identities and may not fully ap-\npreciate the associated risks.  Moreover, Alabama’s decision to draw \nthe line at the age of nineteen sufficiently approximates the divide \nbetween individuals who warrant government protection and indi-\nviduals who are better able to make decisions for themselves; it is \nneither too over- nor under-inclusive.  For these reasons, it is ex-\nceedingly likely that section 4(a)(1)–(3) satisfies rational basis re-\nview as a classification on the basis of age. \nSection 4(a)(1)–(3) is therefore subject only to rational basis \nreview—a standard that it is exceedingly likely to satisfy for the \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 50 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 48 of 59\n48  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nreasons discussed.  See supra Section III.A.  The district court erred \nas a matter of law by applying heightened scrutiny, and that error \ntainted its assessment of Plaintiffs’ likelihood of success.  Because \nthat is true with respect to both the due process claim and the equal \nprotection claim, we vacate the preliminary injunction. \n* * * * \n  This case revolves around an issue that is surely of the ut-\nmost importance to all of the parties involved: the safety and well-\nbeing of the children of Alabama.  But it is complicated by the fact \nthat there is a strong disagreement between the parties over what \nis best for those children.  Absent a constitutional mandate to the \ncontrary, these types of issues are quintessentially the sort that our \nsystem of government reserves to legislative, not judicial, action.  \nFaced with this difficult and delicate set of circumstances, \nthe district court granted the “extraordinary and drastic remedy” \nthat is a preliminary injunction and enjoined Alabama from enforc-\ning part of the law in dispute.  See Callaway, 489 F.2d at 573.  In \ndoing so, the district court determined that section 4(a)(1)–(3) of \nthe Act is subject to heightened scrutiny on due process and equal \nprotection grounds and therefore the parties challenging the law \nhad a substantial likelihood of success on the merits as to those \nclaims.  That was erroneous.  With respect to the Parent Plaintiffs’ \nsubstantive due process claim, the district court divined, without \nadequate historical support, that the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment protects the right to “treat [one’s] children \nwith  transitioning  medications  subject  to  medically  accepted \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 51 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 49 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  49 \nstandards.”  And with respect to the Minor Plaintiffs’ equal protec-\ntion claim, the district court determined that the law classifies on \nthe basis of sex, when in reality the law simply reflects real, biolog-\nical differences between males and females and equally restricts the \nuse of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormone treatment for mi-\nnors of both sexes.  Because the district court reviewed the law un-\nder the wrong standard of scrutiny in connection with both claims, \nthe issuance of the preliminary injunction constituted an abuse of \ndiscretion.  See Curling v. Raffensperger, 50 F.4th 1114, 1121 (11th Cir. \n2022) (“[A] court abuses its discretion in granting a preliminary in-\njunction if, in determining whether success is likely, it incorrectly \nor unreasonably applies the law.”). \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, we vacate the district court’s preliminary \ninjunction on the enforcement of section 4(a)(1)–(3) of the Act. \nVACATED. \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 52 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 50 of 59\n22-11707   BRASHER, J., Concurring  1 \nBRASHER, Circuit Judge, concurring: \nI concur in the Court’s opinion. I write separately to focus \non the plaintiffs’ equal protection claim.  \nThe resolution of an equal protection claim often turns on \nthe level of scrutiny that we apply—rational basis, intermediate, or \nstrict. The plaintiffs argue that the statute classifies based on sex, \nwhich warrants intermediate scrutiny. The Court rejects that argu-\nment, and, after much deliberation and research, I agree. Ala-\nbama’s statute does not treat one sex differently than the other. It \ndoes not use sex as a proxy for some more germane classification. \nAnd it is not based on a sex stereotype. Instead, I think the law is \nbest read to classify—not based on sex—but as between minors \nwho want puberty blockers and hormones to treat “a discordance \nbetween [their] sex and sense of gender identity,” Ala. Code § 26-\n26-2(2), and those minors who want these drugs to treat a different \ncondition.  \nBut even if the statute did discriminate based on sex, I think \nit is likely to satisfy intermediate scrutiny. If Alabama’s statute in-\nvolves a sex-based classification that triggers heightened scrutiny, it \ndoes so because it is otherwise impossible to regulate these drugs \ndifferently when they are prescribed as a treatment for gender dys-\nphoria than when they are prescribed for other purposes. As long \nas the state has a substantial justification for regulating differently \nthe use of puberty blockers and hormones for different purposes, \nthen I think this law satisfies intermediate scrutiny. \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 53 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 51 of 59\n2  BRASHER, J., Concurring  22-11707 \nII.   \nI’ll start with the level of scrutiny that applies to this law. We \nshould be cautious when we are asked to extend heightened scru-\ntiny to novel facts like these. As Justice Stevens explained in one of \nthe Court’s leading cases on sex discrimination, the text of the \nEqual Protection Clause does not subject state laws to different lev-\nels of judicial scrutiny. See Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 211–12 (1976) \n(Stevens, J., concurring). The Clause “requires every State to gov-\nern impartially,” and it “does not direct the courts to apply one \nstandard of review in some cases and a different standard in other \ncases.” Id.; see also United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 570 (1996) \n(Scalia, J., dissenting) (calling tiers of scrutiny “made-up tests”); \nWhole  Woman’s  Health  v.  Hellerstedt,  579  U.S.  582,  638  (2016) \n(Thomas,  J.,  dissenting)  (calling  tiers  of  scrutiny  “increasingly \nmeaningless  . . .  formalism”).  Moreover,  some  of  the  Supreme \nCourt’s most recent (and significant) equal protection precedents \ndon’t apply the tiers of scrutiny. E.g., Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. \n644, 672–76 (2015). \nNonetheless, the Supreme Court has established the tiers of \nscrutiny, and lower courts must apply that doctrine the best we can.  \nIn doing so, I think we must appreciate that the tiers of scrutiny are \n“no more scientific than their names suggest.” Virginia, 518 U.S. at \n567 (Scalia, J., dissenting). They should be “guidelines informing \nour approach to the case at hand, not tests to be mechanically ap-\nplied.” Williams-Yulee v. Fla. Bar, 575 U.S. 433, 457 (2015) (Breyer, J., \nconcurring). To that end, when we are asked to apply heightened \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 54 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 52 of 59\n22-11707   BRASHER, J., Concurring  3 \nscrutiny on novel facts, we need to ensure that the purposes of the \ndoctrine warrant that approach.  \nIn my view, many judges have mechanically applied inter-\nmediate scrutiny to laws like Alabama’s without considering the \nreasons we subject sex classifications to heightened scrutiny. Con-\nsider the Eighth Circuit’s decision in Brandt by & through Brandt v. \nRutledge, 47 F.4th 661 (8th Cir. 2022). There, the court concluded \nthat Arkansas’s comparable law discriminates based on sex be-\ncause, referring to cross-sex hormones, it said that “medical proce-\ndures that are permitted for a minor of one sex are prohibited for \na minor of another sex.” Id. at 669. But the court ignored the law’s \nban on puberty blockers, which applies the same way to both sexes. \nAnd, more fundamentally, the court did not explain how applying \nheightened scrutiny to a law that regulates sex-specific medical in-\nterventions is consistent with the reasons the Supreme Court cre-\nated that standard. \nTurning back to this case, Alabama’s law is replete with sex-\nrelated language. But, even though the statute uses sex-related lan-\nguage, I think it is wrong to say that the statute classifies based on \nsex. The law regulates drugs that “treat a discordance between [an] \nindividual’s sex and sense of gender identity.” Ala. Code § 26-26-\n2(2). The law defines “sex” as “[t]he biological state of being male \nor female, based on the individual’s sex organs, chromosomes, and \nendogenous hormone profiles.” Id. § 26-26-2(3). Then the law pro-\nhibits various treatments “for the purpose of attempting to alter \nthe appearance of or affirm the minor’s perception of his or her \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 55 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 53 of 59\n4  BRASHER, J., Concurring  22-11707 \ngender or sex, if that appearance or perception is inconsistent with \nthe minor’s sex as defined in this act.” Id. § 26-26-4(a). \nI see the word “sex” in this law. But I don’t see a sex classifi-\ncation—at least, not as the idea of a sex classification appears in our \nequal-protection caselaw. Instead, it seems to me that this sex-re-\nlated language classifies between, on the one hand, those minors \nwho want these drugs to treat “a discordance between [their] sex \nand sense of gender identity” and, on the other hand, those minors \nwho want these drugs to treat a different condition. The Equal Pro-\ntection Clause “is essentially a direction that all persons similarly \nsituated should be treated alike.” City of Cleburne, Tex. v. Cleburne \nLiving Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985). So the right question under the \nEqual Protection Clause is whether these two groups—those who \nwant to use these drugs to treat a discordance between their sex \nand gender identity and those who want to use these drugs to treat \nother conditions—are similarly situated.  \nThat question isn’t one that seems suited to heightened scru-\ntiny. The Equal Protection Clause prohibits “giv[ing] a mandatory \npreference to members of either sex over members of the other.” \nReed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71, 76 (1971). We apply heightened scrutiny to \nsex classifications because of an intuition that, “[r]ather than rest-\ning on meaningful considerations, statutes distributing benefits and \nburdens between the sexes in different ways very likely reflect out-\nmoded notions of the relative capabilities of men and women.” \nCity of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 441. When we apply heightened scru-\ntiny to a statute that classifies based on sex, the point is to ascertain \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 56 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 54 of 59\n22-11707   BRASHER, J., Concurring  5 \nwhether the classification is based on “traditional, often inaccurate, \nassumptions about the proper roles of men and women.” Miss. \nUniv. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 725–26 (1982). We are also \nseeking to ensure that sex is not being used as an “inaccurate proxy \nfor other, more germane bases of classification.” Craig, 429 U.S. at \n198.  \nNone of these rationales apply to the line drawn in Ala-\nbama’s statute. It doesn’t distribute benefits or burdens between \nmen and women or arguably use sex as a proxy for other interests. \nIt bans a course of treatment—puberty blockers and hormones—\nfor a particular condition that affects both boys and girls. Another \nway to think about it: an injunction against the enforcement of Al-\nabama’s law under equal-protection principles will not equalize \nburdens or benefits between girls and boys. It will not require the \ngovernment to treat boys and girls the same. It will merely force \nAlabama to either ban puberty blockers and hormones for all pur-\nposes or allow them for all purposes. \nFor its part, the district court applied heightened scrutiny on \nthe theory that Alabama’s statute discriminates based on a sex ste-\nreotype because it targets medical interventions for transgender \npeople, i.e., those who feel a “a discordance between [their] sex and \nsense of gender identity.” The district court cited Glenn v. Brumby, \n663 F.3d 1312, 1320 (11th Cir. 2011), for this proposition, but I think \nit misread that precedent.1 In Glenn, we concluded that a public \n \n1 I don’t fault the district court for reaching the conclusion that it did. The \ndistrict court did an admirable job with a difficult case on an expedited \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 57 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 55 of 59\n6  BRASHER, J., Concurring  22-11707 \nemployer engaged in sex discrimination by firing a transgender em-\nployee who was born a man because the employee began wearing \nstereotypical women’s clothing. Id. at 1314. The employer allowed \nbiological women to wear stereotypical women’s clothing, but not \nbiological men. We held that the employer had engaged in sex dis-\ncrimination under the Equal Protection Clause—not because it \nfired a transgender employee—but because it fired an employee \n“on the basis of gender-based behavioral norms.” Id. at 1316–17. By \nruling against that practice under the circumstances of that case, \nwe required the employer to treat men and women equally, no mat-\nter their clothing choices.  \nUnlike the employer’s decision in Glenn, Alabama’s statute \ndoes not fit the mold of a sex-based stereotype. The statute isn’t \nbased on a socially constructed generalization about the way men \nor women should behave. It does not reinforce an “assumption[] \nabout the proper roles of men and women” in our society. Hogan, \n458 U.S. at 725–26. And it doesn’t reflect society’s “notions of the \nrelative capabilities of men and women.” City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. \nat 441. To be sure, the statute’s classification reflects the govern-\nment’s recognition that, without medical intervention, a healthy \nchild will mature in accord with his or her biological sex. But the \nrecognition of biological reality is “not a stereotype.” Nguyen v. INS, \n533 U.S. 53, 68 (2001). \n \ntimeframe. One of the benefits of the appellate process is that we have more \ntime and resources to assess a legal question, which sometimes yields a differ-\nent result. \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 58 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 56 of 59\n22-11707   BRASHER, J., Concurring  7 \nThe district court—viewing this case through the lens of sex \nstereotyping—did not make any findings on whether the state was \njustified in treating people differently because they want these \ndrugs to treat a discordance between their sex and gender identity \ninstead of some other condition. But the state has identified many \nreasons for drawing that line. For example, the record reflects that \nother countries are regulating the drugs differently for these pur-\nposes, and the FDA has not approved them for this purpose alt-\nhough it has for others. I cannot say that those reasons fail the leni-\nent standard of rational basis review. See Jones v. Gov. of Fla., 975 F.3d \n1016, 1034–35 (11th Cir. 2020). \nIII.   \nAlthough I believe rational basis scrutiny likely applies, I also \nthink that, even if Alabama’s statute triggered intermediate scru-\ntiny, it would likely survive that heightened scrutiny.  \nIntermediate scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause \ndoes not require us to ask whether a law is good or bad policy, but \nwhether a government has a good reason for using a sex-based clas-\nsification in a law. The relevant question is whether “the classifica-\ntion serves ‘important governmental objectives and that the discrim-\ninatory means employed’ are ‘substantially related to the achieve-\nment of those objectives.’” Hogan, 458 U.S. at 724 (quoting Wengler \nv. Druggists Mutual Ins. Co., 446 U.S. 142, 150 (1980)) (emphasis \nadded). As I discuss above, the purpose of this heightened scrutiny \nis to ensure that laws based on sex classifications aren’t using those \nclassifications  because  of  “outmoded  notions  of  the  relative \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 59 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 57 of 59\n8  BRASHER, J., Concurring  22-11707 \ncapabilities of men and women.” City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 441. \nInstead, the use of sex must reflect that it is a “meaningful consid-\neration[]” on which the law is based. Id. And so, under intermediate \nscrutiny, the government’s burden is to establish “an ‘exceedingly \npersuasive justification’ for the classification.” Hogan, 458 U.S. at 724 \n(quoting Kirchberg v. Feenstra 450 U.S. 455, 461 (1981)) (emphasis \nadded).  \nAssuming the classification in this law is subject to interme-\ndiate scrutiny, I believe the state probably has an “exceedingly per-\nsuasive justification” for regulating these drugs differently when \nthey are used to treat a discordance between an individual’s sex and \nsense of gender identity than when they are used for other pur-\nposes. See Sessions v. Morales-Santana, 582 U.S. 47, 58 (2017) (quoting \nVirginia, 518 U.S. at 531). The record reflects that the use of puberty \nblockers and hormones for this purpose specifically carries poten-\ntially uncertain risks. The record also reflects that there is uncer-\ntainty about how to tell which patients need these interventions for \nthis purpose and which don’t. Although further fact finding in this \nlitigation  will  test  the  plausibility  of  those  concerns,  Alabama \ndoesn’t have to conclusively prove these things to have an im-\nportant governmental interest. Intermediate scrutiny permits “the \nlegislature [to] make a predictive judgment” based on competing \nevidence. Brown v. Entm’t Merchs. Ass’n, 564 U.S. 786, 799–800 (2011) \n(discussing relative burdens of intermediate and strict scrutiny). \nLikewise, I think the state’s interest is sufficiently related to \nthe sex classification in the law to the extent there is one. Assuming \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 60 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 58 of 59\n22-11707   BRASHER, J., Concurring  9 \nthis statute involves a sex-based classification, it does so because \nthere is no other way to regulate treatments for “a discordance be-\ntween [an] individual’s sex and sense of gender identity” without \ndrawing such a distinction. Alabama would have to use sex-based \nlanguage to regulate those treatments even if it wanted to subsidize \nthem instead of banning them. So, if intermediate scrutiny applied \nhere, the “sufficiently related” question collapses into the state in-\nterest question: it is whether Alabama has an important govern-\nmental interest in regulating the use of puberty blockers and hor-\nmones for “a discordance between [an] individual’s sex and sense \nof gender identity” but not for other uses. Because the record re-\nflects that the state has that kind of interest, the statute’s classifica-\ntion likely satisfies intermediate scrutiny.  \nThe plaintiffs argue, in part, that Alabama is not justified in \nbanning these treatments because there are less restrictive alterna-\ntives to a ban. But I don’t think that is how intermediate scrutiny \nworks under the Equal Protection Clause. Consider how the Su-\npreme Court applied intermediate scrutiny in Craig v. Boren, 429 \nU.S. 190 (1976). There, a state law prohibited sales of alcohol to \nmen between the ages of eighteen and twenty but not women in \nthat age range. Id. at 191–92. The Court accepted that the goal of \nthis law—“the enhancement of traffic safety”—is an important in-\nterest. Id. at 199–200. But it held that the government did not have \nsufficient evidence that a “gender-based distinction closely serves \nto achieve that objective.” Id. at 200. The Court in Craig never asked \nwhether the state’s decision to ban under-21-year-old men from \ndrinking alcohol was justified as compared to some less restrictive, \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 308   Filed 08/21/23   Page 61 of 61\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 59 of 59\n10  BRASHER, J., Concurring  22-11707 \nbut equally sex-based, alternative—such as making men take addi-\ntional driving classes or the like. Instead, the Court assessed only \nwhether the sex-based classification fit closely enough to the pur-\nposes of the law. Likewise, here, I think we can resolve the plain-\ntiffs’ equal protection claim by assessing whether the state has an \ninterest in classifying based on sex without also asking whether, \neven if the state were allowed to classify based on sex, the state \ncould achieve its objective with some lesser restriction. \nIn short, assuming this law is subject to intermediate scru-\ntiny, I think it likely passes. On this record, it seems clear that the \nstate has an interest in regulating these drugs differently when they \nare prescribed to treat a discordance between sex and gender than \nwhen they are prescribed to treat other conditions. And the state \ncannot do that without drawing the lines it has drawn in this stat-\nute. \nIIII.   \nWhether rational basis or intermediate scrutiny applies, I be-\nlieve this appeal comes out the same way: the state will likely pre-\nvail on the merits. Future findings of fact in the district court may \nestablish otherwise. But at this stage, the plaintiffs have not carried \ntheir burden entitling them to a preliminary injunction. I concur. \n \n \n ",

Docket No. 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-SRW \n____________________ \n \nBefore  LAGOA,  BRASHER,  Circuit  Judges,  and  BOULEE,*  District \nJudge. \nLAGOA, Circuit Judge: \nThis appeal centers around section 4(a)(1)–(3) of Alabama’s \nVulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act (the “Act”).  Sec-\ntion 4(a)(1)–(3) of the Act states that “no person shall engage in or \ncause” the prescription or administration of puberty blocking med-\nication or cross-sex hormone treatment to a minor “for the purpose \nof attempting to alter the appearance of or affirm the minor’s per-\nception of his or her gender or sex, if that appearance or perception \nis inconsistent with the minor’s sex.”  Thus, section 4(a)(1)–(3) \n \n* Honorable J. P. Boulee, United States District Judge for the Northern District \nof Georgia, sitting by designation. \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 5 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 3 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  3 \nmakes it a crime in the State of Alabama to take part in providing \npuberty blockers or cross-sex hormone treatment to a minor for \npurposes of treating a discordance between the minor’s biological \nsex and sense of gender identity. \nShortly  after  the  Act  was  signed  into  law,  a  group  of \ntransgender minors, their parents, and other concerned individuals \nchallenged the Act’s constitutionality, claiming that it violates the \nDue Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Four-\nteenth Amendment.  As part of that lawsuit, the district court is-\nsued a preliminary injunction enjoining Alabama from enforcing \nsection 4(a)(1)–(3) of the Act pending trial, having determined that \nthe plaintiffs are substantially likely to succeed on both of the afore-\nmentioned claims.  Specifically, as to the due process claim, the dis-\ntrict court held that there is a constitutional right to “treat [one’s] \nchildren with transitioning medications subject to medically ac-\ncepted standards” and that the restrictions of section 4(a)(1)–(3) \nlikely impermissibly infringe upon that constitutional right.  As to \nthe equal protection claim, the district court held that section \n4(a)(1)–(3) classifies on the basis of sex by classifying on the basis of \ngender nonconformity and likely amounts to unlawful discrimina-\ntion under the intermediate scrutiny standard applicable to sex-\nbased classifications. \nOn review, we hold that the district court abused its discre-\ntion in issuing this preliminary injunction because it applied the \nwrong standard of scrutiny.  The plaintiffs have not presented any \nauthority that supports the existence of a constitutional right to \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 6 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 4 of 59\n4  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \n“treat [one’s] children with transitioning medications subject to \nmedically accepted standards.”  Nor have they shown that section \n4(a)(1)–(3) classifies on the basis of sex or any other protected char-\nacteristic.  Accordingly, section 4(a)(1)–(3) is subject only to ra-\ntional basis review.  Because the district court erred by reviewing \nthe statute under a heightened standard of scrutiny, its determina-\ntion that the plaintiffs have established a substantial likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits cannot stand.  We therefore vacate the pre-\nliminary injunction. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nThe Act was passed by the Alabama Legislature on April 7, \n2022,  and signed into law by Governor Kay Ivey the following day, \nthereby set to become effective on May 8, 2022. \nA.  The Text of the Act \nThe Act contains eleven sections.  For the sake of complete-\nness, each section is described below. \nSection 1\n establishes the title of the Act.   \nSection 2\n sets forth the following findings by the Alabama \nLegislature: \n(1)  The sex of a person is the biological state of \nbeing female or male, based on sex organs, chromo-\nsomes, and endogenous hormone profiles, and is ge-\nnetically encoded into a person at the moment of \nconception, and it cannot be changed. \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 7 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 5 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  5 \n(2)  Some individuals, including minors, may expe-\nrience discordance between their sex and their inter-\nnal sense of identity, and individuals who experience \nsevere psychological distress as a result of this discord-\nance may be diagnosed with gender dysphoria. \n(3)  The cause of the individual’s impression of dis-\ncordance between sex and identity is unknown, and \nthe diagnosis is based exclusively on the individual’s \nself-report of feelings and beliefs. \n(4)  This internal sense of discordance is not per-\nmanent or fixed, but to the contrary, numerous stud-\nies have shown that a substantial majority of children \nwho experience discordance between their sex and \nidentity will outgrow the discordance once they go \nthrough puberty and will eventually have an identity \nthat aligns with their sex. \n(5)  As a result, taking a wait-and-see approach to \nchildren who reveal signs of gender nonconformity \nresults in a large majority of those children resolving \nto an identity congruent with their sex by late adoles-\ncence. \n(6)  Some in the medical community are aggres-\nsively pushing for interventions on minors that medi-\ncally alter the child’s hormonal balance and remove \nhealthy external and internal sex organs when the \nchild expresses a desire to appear as a sex different \nfrom his or her own. \n(7)  This  course  of  treatment  for  minors  com-\nmonly  begins  with  encouraging  and  assisting  the \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 8 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 6 of 59\n6  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nchild to socially transition to dressing and presenting \nas the opposite sex.  In the case of prepubertal chil-\ndren,  as  puberty  begins,  doctors  then  administer \nlong-acting  GnRH  agonist  (puberty  blockers)  that \nsuppress the pubertal development of the child.  This \nuse of puberty blockers for gender nonconforming \nchildren is experimental and not FDA-approved. \n(8)  After puberty blockade, the child is later ad-\nministered “cross-sex” hormonal treatments that in-\nduce the development of secondary sex characteris-\ntics of the other sex, such as causing the development \nof breasts and wider hips in male children taking es-\ntrogen and greater muscle mass, bone density, body \nhair, and a deeper voice in female children taking tes-\ntosterone.  Some children are administered these hor-\nmones independent of any prior pubertal blockade. \n(9)  The final phase of treatment is for the individ-\nual to undergo cosmetic and other surgical proce-\ndures, often to create an appearance similar to that of \nthe opposite sex.  These surgical procedures may in-\nclude a mastectomy to remove a female adolescent’s \nbreasts and “bottom surgery” that removes a minor’s \nhealth reproductive organs and creates an artificial \nform aiming to approximate the appearance of the \ngenitals of the opposite sex. \n(10)  For minors who are placed on puberty block-\ners that inhibit their bodies from experiencing the \nnatural  process  of  sexual  development,  the  over-\nwhelming majority will continue down a path toward \ncross-sex hormones and cosmetic surgery. \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 9 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 7 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  7 \n(11)  This unproven, poorly studied series of inter-\nventions results in numerous harmful effects for mi-\nnors, as well as risks of effects simply unknown due \nto the new and experimental nature of these interven-\ntions. \n(12)  Among the known harms from puberty block-\ners is diminished bone density; the full effect of pu-\nberty blockers on brain development and cognition \nare yet unknown, though reason for concern is now \npresent.  There is no research on the long-term risks \nto minors of persistent exposure to puberty blockers.  \nWith  the  administration  of  cross-sex  hormones \ncomes  increased  risks  of  cardiovascular  disease, \nthromboembolic stroke, asthma, COPD, and cancer. \n(13)  Puberty blockers prevent gonadal maturation \nand thus render patients taking these drugs infertile.  \nIntroducing cross-sex hormones to children with im-\nmature gonads as a direct result of pubertal blockade \nis expected to cause irreversible sterility.  Sterilization \nis also permanent for those who undergo surgery to \nremove reproductive organs, and such persons are \nlikely to suffer through a lifetime of complications \nfrom the surgery, infections, and other difficulties re-\nquiring yet more medical intervention. \n(14)  Several  studies  demonstrate  that  hormonal \nand surgical interventions often do not resolve the un-\nderlying psychological issues affecting the individual.  \nFor example, individuals who undergo cross-sex cos-\nmetic surgical procedures have been found to suffer \nfrom elevated mortality rates higher than the general \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 10 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 8 of 59\n8  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \npopulation.    They  experience  significantly  higher \nrates of substance abuse, depression, and psychiatric \nhospitalizations. \n(15)  Minors, and often their parents, are unable to \ncomprehend and fully appreciate the risk and life im-\nplications, including permanent sterility, that result \nfrom  the  use  of  puberty  blockers,  cross-sex  hor-\nmones, and surgical procedures. \n(16)  For  these  reasons,  the  decision  to  pursue  a \ncourse of hormonal and surgical interventions to ad-\ndress a discordance between the individual’s sex and \nsense of identity should not be presented to or deter-\nmined for minors who are incapable of comprehend-\ning the negative implications and life-course difficul-\nties attending to these interventions. \nSection 3\n provides definitions for the terms “minor,” “per-\nson,” and “sex.”  Section 3(1) incorporates the definition of “minor” \nestablished in section 43-8-1 of the Alabama Code, first enacted in \n1975, which is “[a] person who is under 19 years of age.”  Ala. Code \n§ 43-8-1(18).

Procedural History \nOn April 19, 2022, a group of plaintiffs initiated this chal-\nlenge to the Act seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  The \ngroup consisted of transgender minors (the “Minor Plaintiffs”), the \nparents  of  those  transgender  minors  (the  “Parent  Plaintiffs”), \nhealthcare providers who regularly treat transgender youth (the \n“Provider Plaintiffs”), and Reverend Paul A. Eknes-Tucker, the Sen-\nior  Pastor  at  Pilgrim  Church  in  Birmingham,  Alabama,  who \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 15 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 13 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  13 \nfrequently counsels parents of transgender children (collectively, \n“Plaintiffs”).2   \nThe original complaint generally alleged that: (1) the Act vi-\nolates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by \ndepriving the Parent Plaintiffs of their right to direct the upbring-\ning of their children (Count I); (2) the Act violates the Equal Pro-\ntection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by discriminating \nagainst the Minor Plaintiffs on the bases of sex and transgender sta-\ntus (Count II); (3) the Act is preempted by section 1557 of the Af-\nfordable Care Act (Count III); (4)  the Act violates the Free Speech \nClause of the First Amendment (Count IV); and (5) the Act is void \nfor vagueness under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment (Count V).  That complaint named the Attorney Gen-\neral of Alabama and several state officials (collectively, “Alabama”) \nas defendants.3   \nTwo days later, Plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary in-\njunction, seeking a ruling preventing the enforcement of the Act in \nadvance of its May 8, 2022, effective date.4  In light of that request, \n \n2 Reverend Eknes-Tucker is not included as a plaintiff in the operative plead-\ning, the Second Amended Complaint, nor does he take part in this appeal. \n3 The original complaint also included Governor Ivey as a defendant, but the \nparties subsequently moved to dismiss her from the action on May 3, 2022, \npursuant to a joint understanding that she and her office would be bound by \nany forthcoming injunctive relief.  The district court granted that request.   \n4 The motion is styled as a “motion for a temporary restraining order and/or \npreliminary injunction.”  However, because Alabama received notice of the \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 16 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 14 of 59\n14  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nthe district court expedited the briefing schedule and scheduled a \nhearing for the first week of May.   \nOn April 29, 2022, the United States filed a motion to inter-\nvene, as well as its own motion for preliminary injunction similarly \nseeking to prevent enforcement of the Act.  Shortly thereafter, fif-\nteen states moved for leave to file an amicus brief in support of \nAlabama.  That was followed by a group of at least twenty-two \nprofessional medical and mental health organizations jointly mov-\ning for leave to file an amicus brief in support of Plaintiffs.  The \ndistrict court ultimately granted the motion to intervene and the \nmotions to file amicus briefs, giving the United States permission \nto participate in the preliminary injunction hearing and taking the \namicus briefs under advisement.   \nThe three-day hearing on Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary \ninjunction began on May 4, 2022.  On that first day, the district \ncourt discussed the motion for intervention and heard opening ar-\nguments from the parties.  At that time, Plaintiffs represented that \nthey were no longer challenging the portions of section 4 that ban \nsurgical intervention, i.e., subsections (a)(4)–(6), and were instead \nfocusing on the portions of section 4 that ban puberty blockers and \ncross-sex hormone treatment, i.e. subsections (a)(1)–(3).  The fol-\nlowing day, the parties commenced their presentation of the evi-\ndence.  \n \nrequest for injunctive relief, the motion subsequently was addressed only as a \nmotion for preliminary injunction.   \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 17 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 15 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  15 \nPlaintiffs first tendered Dr. Linda Hawkins and Dr. Morissa \nLadinsky as experts in the treatment of gender dysphoria in mi-\nnors.  Dr. Hawkins is the director of the Gender and Sexuality De-\nvelopment Clinic at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.  She \nhas specialized in treating LGBT youth for roughly twenty-two \nyears and worked with over 4,000 transgender youth.  During her \ntestimony, Dr. Hawkins defined “gender identity” as “the internal \nauthentic hardwired sense of one’s self as male or female.”  She \nfurther testified that a blanket prohibition on puberty blockers and \nhormone treatment would be “devastating” for transgender youth, \ncomparing it to “removing somebody’s cancer treatment and just \n \nexpecting them to be okay.”  \nDr. Ladinsky is an associate professor of pediatrics at the \nHeersink School of Medicine at the University of Alabama at Bir-\nmingham (“UAB”) and a board-certified pediatrician at the affili-\nated hospital.  Dr. Ladinsky opened a gender clinic at UAB in the \nfall of 2015 and, at the time of her testimony, had worked with an \nestimated 400 to 450 minors suffering from gender dysphoria.  Dr. \nLadinsky discussed the guidelines on the treatment of gender dys-\nphoria in youth that the UAB gender clinic follows and noted that \nthose guidelines are endorsed by the American Academy of Pedi-\natrics.  She also noted that consent forms must be signed by all legal \nparents  and  guardians  before  a  minor’s  hormonal  therapy  can \n \nbegin.  According toDr. Ladinsky, puberty blockers pose some risks \nbut, overall, are safe and reversible.  She described the risks posed \nby puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, related to fertility and \nsexual function, as “small side effect risks.”  Dr. Ladinsky also \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 18 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 16 of 59\n16  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \ntestified that the youngest minor for which she prescribed puberty \nblockers was an eleven-year-old female and that about 85 percent \nof her patients who have taken puberty blockers have gone on to \ntake cross-sex hormones.  In her opinion, it is “uncommon” for a \nminor patient taking puberty blockers to stop experiencing gender \ndysphoria and begin identifying with their biological sex.   \nPlaintiffs then called Megan Poe (one of the Parent Plain-\ntiffs), Dr. Rachel Koe (one of the Provider Plaintiffs), and Reverend \nEknes-Tucker to testify about their personal knowledge and expe-\nrience regarding gender dysphoria.   \nPoe is the mother of a biological male who identifies as a \nfemale.  When asked how her child presents as a female, Poe testi-\nfied that her child “is very over the top girly,” “loves makeup and \nhair,” and “[is] always worried about her clothes.”  The child began \nshowing signs of a female gender identity at the age of two, accord-\ning to Poe, by wanting girl toys and girl clothes.  The child started \npuberty blockers in sixth grade and then started hormone therapy \nat the age of fourteen.  Poe reported that her child now is “so \nhappy” and “thriving” and has not experienced any side effects \nfrom the treatment.  She insisted that her child is “definitely not \n[experiencing] a phase” and is “never going to grow out of this.”  \nPoe also said she was afraid that her child would commit suicide if \n \nthe treatments were no longer available.  \nDr. Koe is a pediatrician in southeast Alabama.  Dr. Koe re-\nported that she treats transgender adolescents but has never treated \na patient with gender dysphoria who later desisted or expressed \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 19 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 17 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  17 \nregret about receiving these types of treatments.  She also testified \nthat, if the Act takes effect, it will leave her “stuck in a place where \n[she doesn’t] know how to proceed” nor how to provide care for \npatients with gender dysphoria.   \nReverend  Eknes-Tucker  is  the  Senior  Pastor  at  Pilgrim \nChurch in Birmingham, Alabama, and has been a pastor for 45 \nyears.    Reverend  Eknes-Tucker  testified  that  there  have  been \ntransgender individuals in every congregation that he has served \nand that he has given advice to parents of transgender children on \nnumerous occasions.  He clarified that he has not given medical \nadvice but that he has helped connect parents of transgender chil-\ndren with doctors who provide gender-affirming care.   \nIn addition to this live testimony, Plaintiffs produced as evi-\ndence various organizational medical guidelines, sworn declara-\ntions, research articles, and other documents.   \nNext, the United States, as an intervenor on behalf of Plain-\ntiffs, tendered Dr. Armand H. Antommaria as an expert in bioethics \nand treatment protocols for adolescents suffering from gender dys-\nphoria.  Dr. Antommaria is the chair of pediatric ethics and an at-\ntending physician at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center.    \nDuring his testimony, Dr. Antommaria addressed the dearth of ran-\ndomized controlled trials for the treatment of minors with puberty \nblockers and cross-sex hormone therapy and expressed his concern \nthat such trials “would be unethical,” given the lack of confidence \nthat the control group and the experimental group would receive \nequally efficacious treatment.  He also expressed concern that any \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 20 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 18 of 59\n18  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nsuch trials “would have substantial methodological limitations,” \ngiven the need to recruit enough participants and conduct a blind \nstudy.  When asked for his opinion regarding the ability of parents \nand adolescents to adequately understand and give informed con-\nsent to the provision of puberty blockers and hormone therapy, Dr. \nAntommaria answered that those treatments are “comparable to \nother decisions that parents and their children make in pediatric \nhealthcare on a frequent basis.”  He further testified that there are \nno equally effective alternative medical treatments for adolescents \nwith gender dysphoria and that there is not an ethical basis for dis-\ntinguishing between minors experiencing precocious puberty5 and \nminors experiencing gender dysphoria with respect to the provi-\nsion of puberty blockers and hormone treatment.   \nAlong with Dr. Antommaria’s testimony, the United States \npresented, among other things, various organizations’ medical pol-\nicy statements and guidelines, some research and news articles, and \nDr. Antommaria’s declaration and curriculum vitae.  For example, \nthe United States presented the Standards of Care of the World \nProfessional  Association  for  Transgender  Health  (“WPATH”), \nwhich endorse the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormone \ntreatment for minors when certain criteria are met.  The United \nStates also offered statements by the Alabama Psychological Asso-\nciation and the American Academy of Pediatrics supporting the use \nof puberty blockers and cross-sex hormone treatment for minors \nand opposing the Act.  The full record reveals that at least twenty-\n \n5 Precocious puberty is the premature initiation of puberty.   \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 21 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 19 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  19 \ntwo professional medical and mental health organizations support \nthe use of such medications.   \nOn cross-examination, Dr. Antommaria acknowledged that \n“[t]here are risks involved in the treatment course for the treatment \nof gender dysphoria.”  He went on to note that, for puberty block-\ners and cross-sex hormones generally, there is a risk of impaired \nfertility, and that, for estrogen therapy, there is a risk of change in \nsexual function.  When asked whether he agrees that more re-\nsearch is needed to study the efficacy and the costs and benefits of \ngender-affirming care, Dr. Antommaria responded that “more re-\nsearch is needed in all areas of health care.”   \nAlabama, for its part, first tendered Dr. James Cantor.  Dr. \nCantor is a clinical psychologist and neuroscientist who was called \nas an expert on psychology, human sexuality, research methodol-\nogy, and the state of research on gender dysphoria.  In response to \nDr. Antommaria’s testimony, Dr. Cantor confirmed that none of \nthe existing studies on puberty blockers and hormone therapies are \nrandomized and opined that there are alternative methodologies \nthat would be more reliable than observational trials, which he de-\nscribed as the lowest quality of evidence.  Dr. Cantor also testified \nthat the existing research does not support the conclusion that the \nuse of puberty blockers and hormone therapy is “the only safe and \neffective treatment for gender dysphoria.”  In his opinion, gender \ndysphoria  can  be  treated  with  a  “watchful  waiting  approach” \nwhereby decisions about medical interventions are withheld, but \ntherapy is continued, until more information becomes available.    \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 22 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 20 of 59\n20  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nAccording to Dr. Cantor, clinical guidelines suggest that comorbid-\nities, including mental health issues, should be resolved prior to \npursuing puberty blockers and cross-sex hormone treatment.  He \nalso noted that some cases of gender dysphoria have turned out to \nbe prepubescent children misinterpreting their same-sex attraction \nand that blocking puberty in such cases prevents those children \nfrom understanding their sexuality.   \nOn cross-examination, Dr. Cantor acknowledged that he is \nnot  a  medical  doctor  and  that  he  has  not  provided  care  to \ntransgender adolescents under the age of sixteen.   \nAlabama then called Sydney Wright to testify about her per-\nsonal experience with gender dysphoria.  Wright is a biological fe-\nmale who is married to another woman.  At the time of her testi-\nmony, Wright was twenty-three years old.  She testified that she \nbegan identifying as transgender and receiving related treatment \nwhen she was seventeen years old, which culminated in testos-\nterone therapy for approximately one year when she was nineteen \nyears old.  According to Wright, the testosterone treatment put her \nat a greater risk of heart attack or stroke and caused her to develop \ntachycardia.  She explained that, after a significant discussion with \nher grandfather, she stopped identifying as transgender and receiv-\ning testosterone therapy.  She now believes that her doctors mis-\nhandled her treatment and that she simply needed counseling dur-\ning her teenage years.  She also reported that her digestive system \nis “still messed up” and that she may have fertility issues as a result \nof the testosterone therapy that she received over three-and-a-half \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 23 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 21 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  21 \nyears earlier.  When asked what she would tell a young person \nstruggling with gender dysphoria, Wright stated that she would ad-\nvise them to take “a lot of time,” “love [themselves],” and under-\nstand that they can act and dress like the opposite sex without \n \n“hav[ing] to transition.”  \nIn  addition  to  these  two  witnesses,  Alabama  produced, \namong other things, research papers, foreign countries’ medical \nguidelines, and the declarations of various healthcare professionals \nand individuals with experience related to gender dysphoria.  For \nexample, in terms of healthcare professionals, Alabama produced \na declaration in which Dr. Quentin L. Van Meter6 states that com-\nparing the use of puberty blockers for precocious puberty with the \nuse of puberty blockers for gender dysphoria is like “comparing \napples to oranges,” given the evidence that “normal bone density \ncan’t be fully reestablished” in the latter case and the lack of long-\nterm data on bone, gonad, and brain health.  Alabama also pro-\nduced a declaration in which Dr. Patrick Hunter7 attests that “there \nis currently no established standard of care for transgender-identi-\nfied youth” and that “[t]he medical risks of ‘gender-affirming’ in-\nterventions are substantial.”  In terms of individuals with personal \nexperience related to gender dysphoria, Alabama produced the \n \n6 Dr. Van Meter is a board-certified pediatrician and pediatric endocrinologist \nwho currently works in private practice.  \n7 Dr. Hunter is a board-certified pediatrician with a master’s degree in bioeth-\nics who currently holds academic positions at the University of Central Florida \nand Florida State University.  \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 24 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 22 of 59\n22  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \ndeclaration of Corinna Cohn, a biological male who underwent sex \nreassignment surgery at the age of nineteen—which included the \nremoval of testicles, penectomy, and vaginoplasty—and who, look-\ning back, claims to have been “unprepared to understand the con-\n  \nsequences” of seeking such medical interventions as a teenager.  \nAlabama also produced a declaration in which Carol Freitas, a bio-\nlogical  female  who  previously  experienced  gender  dysphoria, \nclaims that “[transitioning] was the biggest mistake [that she] ever \nmade” and that she instead should have been treated for depression \nand post-traumatic stress disorder related to her “internalized hom-\nophobia and childhood abuse.”  Lastly, in terms of medical opin-\nions from foreign countries, Alabama produced documents show-\ning that public healthcare entities of Sweden, Finland, France, Aus-\ntralia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom have raised concerns \nabout the risks associated with puberty blockers and cross-sex hor-\nmone treatment and supported greater caution and/or more re-\nstrictive criteria in connection with such interventions.   \n \nOn May 13, 2022, the district court granted in part and de-\nnied in part the motions for preliminary injunction, enjoining Ala-\nbama from enforcing section 4(a)(1)–(3) but allowing the rest of the \nAct to remain in effect.  The ruling was based on, among other \nthings, a determination that Plaintiffs had shown a substantial like-\nlihood of success on the merits as to their substantive due process \nclaim and equal protection claim (Counts I and II), but not as to \ntheir other claims.  With respect to the substantive due process \nclaim (Count I), the district court recognized a fundamental right \nof parents to “treat their children with transitioning medications \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 25 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 23 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  23 \nsubject to medically accepted standards,” held that the Act infringes \nupon that fundamental right and concluded that Alabama had not \nsufficiently  demonstrated  that  the  Act  is  narrowly  tailored  to \nachieve a compelling state interest.  With respect to the equal pro-\ntection  claim  (Count  II),  the  district  court  held  that  the  Act \n“amounts to a sex-based classification” and concluded that Ala-\nbama had not proffered a sufficiently persuasive justification for \nthat classification. \n  Alabama filed a timely notice of appeal on May 16, 2022.8   \nII.

LePore, 234 F.3d 1163, 1176 \n(11th Cir. 2000) (en banc).  “In considering these four prerequisites, \n[courts] must remember that a preliminary injunction is an extraor-\ndinary and drastic remedy which should not be granted unless the \nmovant clearly carries the burden of persuasion” as to these four \nprerequisites.  Canal Auth. v. Callaway, 489 F.2d 567, 573 (5th Cir. \n1974); accord Siegel, 234 F.3d at 1176.9 \nAs previewed, the district court determined that these four \nprerequisites are met with respect to section 4(a)(1)–(3) and thus \nenjoined Alabama from enforcing that part of the Act.  The district \ncourt dedicated the bulk of its analysis in the preliminary injunction \norder to the first prerequisite and ultimately found that Plaintiffs \nhad established a substantial likelihood of success as to their sub-\nstantive due process claim and equal protection claim.  Because the \nparties’ arguments on appeal similarly focus on the likelihood-of-\nsuccess prerequisite, we do the same.  We begin with the substan-\ntive due process claim and then turn to the equal protection claim. \nA. Substantive Due Process \n \n9 In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), \nthis Court adopted as precedent the decisions of the former Fifth Circuit ren-\ndered prior to October 1, 1981. \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 27 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 25 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  25 \n  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment pro-\nvides that no state shall “deprive any person of life, liberty, or prop-\nerty, without due process of law.”  U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1.  \nThe Supreme Court has held that this language guarantees both \nprocedural and substantive rights.  Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health \nOrg., 142 S. Ct. 2228, 2246 (2022).  Those substantive rights include \na  “great  majority”  of  the  rights  guaranteed  by  the  first  eight \nAmendments vis-à-vis the federal government, as well as “a select \nlist of fundamental rights that are not mentioned anywhere in the \nConstitution.”  Id.; see also McDonald v. City of Chicago, 561 U.S. 742, \n760–66 (2010) (reviewing the history of the Supreme Court’s incor-\nporation of “almost all of the provisions of the Bill of Rights” \nagainst the States). \nTo determine whether a right at issue is one of the substan-\ntive rights guaranteed by the Due Process Clause, courts must look \nto whether the right is “deeply rooted in [our] history and tradi-\ntion” and “essential to our Nation’s ‘scheme of ordered liberty.’”  \nDobbs, 142 S. Ct. at 2246 (alteration in original) (quoting Timbs v. \nIndiana, 139 S. Ct. 682, 687 (2019)).  The outcome of this analysis \ndetermines the amount of leeway that states have to enact laws \nthat infringe upon the right at issue.  “Laws that burden the exer-\ncise of a fundamental right require strict scrutiny and are sustained \nonly if narrowly tailored to further a compelling government inter-\nest.”  Lofton v. Sec’y of Dep’t of Child. & Fam. Servs., 358 F.3d 804, 815 \n(11th Cir. 2004).  Conversely, laws that do not burden the exercise \nof a fundamental right (and do not discriminate against a suspect \nclass under the Equal Protection Clause) are subject to rational \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 28 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 26 of 59\n26  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nbasis review and need only “be rationally related to a legitimate \ngovernmental interest.”  Jones v. Governor of Florida, 950 F.3d 795, \n809 (11th Cir. 2020).  Although not “toothless,” rational basis re-\nview is “highly deferential to government action.”  Id. (quoting \nSchweiker v. Wilson, 450 U.S. 221, 234 (1981)). \nIn other words, every time a court recognizes an asserted \nright as a fundamental right protected by the Constitution, the \ncourt, “to a great extent, place[s] the matter outside the arena of \npublic debate and legislative action.” Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 \nU.S. 702, 720 (1997).  For that reason, the Supreme Court has in-\nstructed courts addressing substantive due process claims to “en-\ngage[] in a careful analysis of the history of the right at issue” and \nbe “‘reluctant’ to recognize rights that are not mentioned in the \nConstitution.”  Dobbs, 142 S. Ct. at 2246–47 (quoting Collins v. \nHarker Heights, 503 U.S. 115, 125 (1992)). \n  In this case, the district court determined that the “right to \ntreat  [one’s]  children  with  transitioning  medications  subject  to \nmedically accepted standards” is one of the substantive rights guar-\nanteed by the Due Process Clause and that, therefore, section \n4(a)(1)–(3) is subject to strict scrutiny.  But the use of these medica-\ntions in general—let alone for children—almost certainly is not \n“deeply rooted” in our nation’s history and tradition.

United States, 871 F.3d 1260, 1269–70 (11th Cir. 2017) \n(rejecting the notion that the Constitution protects a right to pro-\ncreate via in vitro fertilization procedures based on the fact that \nsuch procedures are “decidedly modern phenomena” that did not \ncome about until 1978). \nRather than perform any historical inquiry specifically tied \nto the particular alleged right at issue, the order on appeal instead \nsurmises that the “right to treat [one’s] children with transitioning \nmedications subject to medically accepted standards” falls under \nthe broader, recognized fundamental right to “make decisions con-\ncerning the care, custody, and control of [one’s] children.” E.g., \nTroxel v.

However, there \nis no binding authority that indicates that the general right to \n“make  decisions  concerning  the  care,  custody,  and  control  of \n \ntreatment for gender dysphoria “[i]n the second half of the 20th century.”  \nDoc. 78-17 at 14. \n13 See Lawrence B.

Rev. 1, 6–7 (2015) (“[T]he original meaning \n(‘communicative content’) of the constitutional text is fixed at the time each \nprovision is framed and ratified.”). \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 31 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 29 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  29 \n[one’s] children” includes the right to give one’s children puberty \nblockers and cross-sex hormone treatment. \nThe fundamental right to “make decisions concerning the \ncare, custody, and control of [one’s] children,” as it is recognized \ntoday, traces back in large part to Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 \n(1923).  There, the Supreme Court held that a Nebraska law re-\nstricting the teaching of foreign languages violated the Due Process \nClause.  Id. at 400–03.  In doing so, the Court recognized that the \n“liberty” guaranteed by the Due Process Clause includes the right \n“to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire \nuseful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring up children, . . . \nand generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized at common \nlaw as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness of free men.”  \nId. at 399 (emphasis added). \nThe Supreme Court elaborated on the fundamental liberty \nof parents two years later in Pierce v. Society of the Sisters of the Holy \nNames of Jesus & Mary, 268 U.S. 510 (1925).  That case addressed \nOregon’s Compulsory Education Act of 1922, which mandated \nthat parents send their school-aged children to public school (as op-\nposed to private school).  Id. at 530–31.  Citing its decision in Meyer, \nthe Court concluded that the Oregon law violated the Due Process \nClause on the basis that it “unreasonably interferes with the liberty \nof parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of chil-\ndren under their control.”  Id. at 534–35 (emphasis added). \nMeyer and Pierce ushered in a line of Supreme Court deci-\nsions that recognized, and further defined the contours of, parents’ \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 32 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 30 of 59\n30  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nliberty interest to control the upbringing of their children.14  The \nmajority of those cases, however, pertain to issues of education, \nreligion, or custody.  The Supreme Court’s most extensive discus-\nsion of parents’ control over the medical treatment received by \ntheir children came in Parham v. J. R., 442 U.S. 584 (1979). \nIn Parham, a group of minors brought a Due Process chal-\nlenge to Georgia’s procedures for committing children to mental \nhospitals.  Id. at 587–88.  At the time, Georgia law provided for the \nvoluntary admission of children upon application by a parent or \n \n14 See, e.g., Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166–69 (1944) (recognizing that \n“the custody, care and nurture of [children] reside[s] first in the parents,” but \nnevertheless upholding Massachusetts child labor laws that restricted the abil-\nity of children to sell religious literature in accordance with their parents’ \nwishes based on the state’s “authority over children’s activities” and “the crip-\npling effects of child employment, more especially in public places” (footnote \nomitted)); Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 646–59 (1972) (holding that Illinois \ncould not automatically designate the children of unwed parents as wards of \nthe state upon the death of the mother because fathers of children born out of \nwedlock have a “cognizable and substantial” “interest in retaining custody of \n[their] children” under the Constitution); Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 213–\n234 (1972) (holding that Wisconsin could not compel school attendance be-\nyond the eighth grade because doing so would “grave[ly] interfere[] with im-\nportant Amish religious tenets” and “the traditional interest of parents with \nrespect to the religious upbringing of their children”); Troxel, 530 U.S. at 60–\n75 (striking down Washington’s nonparental visitation statute, which would \nhave permitted any person to petition for visitation rights at any time and \ncourts to grant such rights whenever in the best interest of the child, on the \nbasis that it contravened “the fundamental right of parents to make decisions \nconcerning the care, custody, and control of their children” and “the tradi-\ntional presumption that a fit parent will act in the best interest of his or her \nchild”). \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 33 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 31 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  31 \nguardian.  Id. at 590–91.  Thus, the question at issue was whether \nthe minors had a procedural due process right to greater procedural \nsafeguards, e.g., a judicial hearing, before their parents could com-\nmit them.  Id. at 610.  The Supreme Court concluded that “some \nkind of inquiry should be made by a ‘neutral factfinder’ to deter-\nmine whether the statutory requirements for admission are satis-\nfied,” but that the inquiry could be “informal,” e.g., conducted by \na staff physician, and did not require an adversarial proceeding with \na judicial or administrative officer.  Id. at 606–10.  “[R]equiring a \nformalized, factfinding hearing,” according to the Supreme Court, \nwould “[p]it[] the parents and the child” against each other and rep-\nresent a “significant intrusion into the parent-child relationship.”  \nId. at 610; see also id. (“It is one thing to require a neutral physician \nto make a careful review of the parents’ decision in order to make \nsure it is proper from a medical standpoint; it is a wholly different \nmatter to employ an adversary contest to ascertain whether the \nparents’ motivation is consistent with the child’s interests.”).  In so \nruling, the Supreme Court recognized, as a general matter, that \n“[m]ost children, even in adolescence, simply are not able to make \nsound judgments concerning many decisions, including their need \nfor medical care or treatment,” id. at 603, and that parents retain \n“plenary authority” as well as “a substantial, if not the dominant, \nrole” in deciding to pursue lawfully available treatment, like insti-\ntutionalization, for their children, id. at 604; see also id. at 609 (con-\ncerning “treatment that is provided by the state”).  Parham was con-\ncerned about the procedures a state must afford a child prior to in-\nstitutionalization when the parent believes such treatment—which \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 34 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 32 of 59\n32  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nis not only lawful but provided by the state itself—is necessary.  No-\ntably, Parham does not at all suggest that parents have a fundamen-\ntal right to direct a particular medical treatment for their child that \nis prohibited by state law.  Parham therefore offers no support for \nthe Parent Plaintiffs’ substantive due process claim.   \n  This Court has issued its own series of decisions outlining \nthe contours of parents’ liberty interest to control the upbringing \nof their children,15 with the most relevant decision being Bendiburg \nv. Dempsey, 909 F.2d 463 (11th Cir. 1990).  In that case, the State of \nGeorgia had obtained temporary custody of a fifteen-year-old boy \nwho was injured in an automobile accident.  As the boy’s custodian \n \n15 See, e.g., Arnold v.

Frazier v. Winn, 535 F.3d 1279, 1281–86 (11th \nCir. 2008) (holding that Florida’s Pledge of Allegiance statute, which requires \nstudents to recite the Pledge in the absence of a written request to the contrary \nby a parent, is constitutional despite restricting the students’ freedom of \nspeech because it advances the fundamental rights of parents to direct the up-\nbringing of their children). \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 35 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 33 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  33 \nand over the father’s wishes,16 Georgia consented to the use of a \nHickman catheter on the boy, which allegedly caused a massive \npulmonary embolus and ultimately the boy’s death.  Id. at 466–67.  \nThis  Court  allowed  the  father’s  procedural  due  process  claims \nagainst certain defendants to proceed to trial, noting that “neither \nthe state nor private actors, concerned for the medical needs of a \nchild, can willfully disregard the rights of parents to generally make \ndecisions concerning the treatment to be given to their children” \nand that “[t]he Due Process Clause prevents government from \nabusing its power, or employing its power as an instrument of op-\npression.”  Id. at 470.  But, as relevant here, this Court affirmed the \ndetermination that the father had no substantive due process claim \nand recognized that “[t]he state has an interest in protecting the \nhealth, safety, and welfare of children residing within its borders.”17 \nId. at 468, 470.  \nIn sum, none of the binding decisions regarding substantive \ndue process establishes that there is a fundamental right to “treat \n[one’s] children with transitioning medications subject to medically \n \n16 The child’s mother had been killed in the same automobile accident.  Bendi-\nburg, 909 F.2d at 466. \n17 It bears emphasizing that Bendiburg dealt with a situation wherein a State \ninterfered with a single parent’s ability to refuse certain lawful medical treat-\nment for his child.  Id. at 466–67.  To the extent that Bendiberg supports the \nproposition that parents have a substantive due process right relating to the \nmedical treatment that their children receive, its reasoning is not equally ap-\nplicable to situations involving parents’ ability to affirmatively obtain certain \nmedical treatment for their children that the State prohibits. \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 36 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 34 of 59\n34  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \naccepted standards.”  Instead, some of these cases recognize, at a \nhigh level of generality, that there is a fundamental right to make \ndecisions concerning the “upbringing” and “care, custody, and con-\ntrol” of one’s children.  See Pierce, 268 U.S. at 534–35; Troxel, 530 \nU.S. at 66.  And those decisions applying the fundamental parental \nright in the context of medical decision-making do not establish \nthat parents have a derivative fundamental right to obtain a partic-\nular medical treatment for their children as long as a critical mass \nof medical professionals approve.  Moreover, all of the cases deal-\ning with the fundamental parental right reflect the common thread \nthat states properly may limit the authority of parents where “it \nappears that parental decisions will jeopardize the health or safety \nof the child, or have a potential for significant social burdens.”  Wis-\nconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 233–34 (1972); see also Prince v. Massa-\nchusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 168–69 (1944); Parham, 442 U.S. at 604; Ben-\ndiburg, 909 F.2d at 470.  Against this backdrop, and without any his-\ntorical analysis specifically tied to the medications at issue, Plaintiffs \nhave not shown it to be likely that the Due Process Clause of the \nConstitution guarantees a fundamental “right to treat [one’s] chil-\ndren with transitioning medications subject to medically accepted \nstandards.”18  See L.W. v. Skrmetti, 73 F.4th 408, 416–17 (6th Cir. July \n8, 2023) (recognizing that parents “have a substantive due process \n \n18 This is consistent with the fact that there has been no showing of any histor-\nical recognition of a fundamental right of adults to obtain the medications at \nissue for themselves.  As Alabama points out, it would make little sense for \nadults to have a parental right to obtain these medications for their children \nbut not a personal right to obtain the same medications for themselves.   \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 37 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 35 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  35 \nright ‘to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control \nof their children’” but noting that “[n]o Supreme Court case ex-\ntends it to a general right to receive new medical or experimental \ndrug treatments” (quoting Troxel, 530 U.S. at 66)). \nBecause the Due Process Clause does not guarantee the de-\nscribed right, state regulation of the use of puberty blockers and \ncross-sex hormone treatment for minors would be subject only to \nrational basis review and thus afforded “a ‘strong presumption of \nvalidity.’”  Dobbs, 142 S. Ct. at 2284 (quoting Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. \n312, 319 (1993)).  “Under this deferential standard,” the question \nthat we ask “is simply whether the challenged legislation is ration-\nally related to a legitimate state interest.”  Lofton, 358 F.3d at 818.  \nSuch a relationship may merely “be based on rational speculation” \nand need not be supported “by evidence or empirical data.”  FCC v. \nBeach Commc’ns, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 315 (1993); accord Jones, 950 F.3d \nat 809 (“When we review a statute for rationality, generally we ask \nwhether there is any rational basis for the law, even if the govern-\nment's proffered explanation is irrational, and even if it fails to offer \nany explanation at all.”).   \nWe are highly doubtful that section 4(a)(1)–(3) would not \nsurvive the lenient standard that is rational basis review.  It is well \nestablished that states have a compelling interest in “safeguarding \nthe physical and psychological well-being of . . . minor[s].”  Otto v. \nCity of Boca Raton, 981 F.3d 854, 868 (11th Cir. 2020) (quoting New \nYork v.

In the same vein, states \nhave  a  compelling  interest  in  protecting  children  from  drugs, \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 38 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 36 of 59\n36  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nparticularly those for which there is uncertainty regarding benefits, \nrecent surges in use, and irreversible effects.19  Although rational \nspeculation is itself sufficient to survive rational basis review, here \nAlabama relies on both record evidence and rational speculation to \nestablish that section 4(a)(1)–(3) is rationally related to that compel-\nling state interest.  First, the record evidence is undisputed that the \nmedications at issue present some risks.  As the district court recog-\nnized, these medications can cause “loss of fertility and sexual func-\ntion.”  The district court also acknowledged testimony that “sev-\neral European countries have restricted treating minors with tran-\nsitioning medications due to growing concern about the medica-\ntions’ risks.”  Second, there is at least rational speculation that some \nfamilies will not fully appreciate those risks and that some minors \nexperiencing gender dysphoria ultimately will desist and identify \nwith their biological sex.  Section 4(a)(1)–(3) addresses these risks \nby  prohibiting  the  prescription  and  administration  of  puberty \nblockers and cross-sex hormone treatment to a patient under the \nage of nineteen for purposes of treating discordance between bio-\nlogical sex and sense of gender identity so that children will have \nmore time to develop their identities and to consider all of the \n \n19 As Alabama suggests, the opioid epidemic has shown firsthand the need to \nbe skeptical and exercise caution when there is a sudden uptick in prescriptions \nof powerful, off-label medications, even when some medical and pharmaceu-\ntical organizations defend their safety.  See also Skrmetti, 73 F.4th at 418 (“[I]t is \ndifficult to maintain that the medical community is of one mind about the use \nof hormone therapy for gender dysphoria when the FDA is not prepared to \nput its credibility and careful testing protocols behind the use.”). \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 39 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 37 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  37 \npotential consequences before moving forward with such treat-\nments.  That connection would be sufficient under rational basis \nreview. \nIn sum, Plaintiffs’ assertion that the Constitution protects \nthe right to treat one’s children with puberty blockers and cross-\nsex hormone therapy is precisely the sort of claim that asks courts \nto “break new ground in [the] field [of Substantive Due Process]” \nand therefore ought to elicit the “utmost care” from the judiciary.  \nSee Collins, 503 U.S. at 125.  The district court held that there is a \nspecific right under the Constitution “to treat [one’s] children with \ntransitioning medications subject to medically accepted standards,” \nbut did so without performing any analysis of whether that specific \nright is deeply rooted in our nation’s history and tradition.  Instead, \nthe district court grounded its ruling in an unprecedented interpre-\ntation of parents’ fundamental right to make decisions concerning \nthe “upbringing” and “care, custody, and control” of one’s chil-\ndren.  See Pierce, 268 U.S. at 534–35; Troxel, 530 U.S. at 66.  That was \nerror.  Neither the record nor any binding authority establishes that \nthe “right to treat [one’s] children with transitioning medications \nsubject to medically accepted standards” is a fundamental right \nprotected by the Constitution.  And, assuming it is not, then section \n4(a)(1)–(3) is subject only to rational basis review—a lenient stand-\nard that the law seems to undoubtedly clear.  Because the district \ncourt erroneously reviewed section 4(a)(1)–(3) with heightened \nscrutiny, its determination regarding the Parent Plaintiffs’ likeli-\nhood of success does not justify the preliminary injunction. \nB.

XIV, § 1.  The Equal Protection \nClause is “essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated \nshould be treated alike,” City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 \nU.S. 432, 439 (1985), and “simply keeps governmental decisionmak-\ners from treating differently persons who are in all relevant respects \nalike,” Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1, 10 (1992). \n“In considering whether state legislation violates the Equal \nProtection Clause . . . we apply different levels of scrutiny to differ-\nent types of classifications.”  Clark v. Jeter, 486 U.S. 456, 461 (1988).  \nAll statutory classifications must, at a minimum, satisfy rational ba-\nsis review.  Id.  Classifications based on race or national origin, \nhowever, are reviewed under the “most exacting” level of scrutiny: \nstrict scrutiny.  Id.  Between rational basis review and strict scrutiny \nlies “a level of intermediate scrutiny,” which applies to classifica-\ntions based on sex or illegitimacy.  Id. \nThus, a government policy that distinguishes on the basis of \nsex is permissible under the Equal Protection Clause “only if it sat-\nisfies intermediate scrutiny.”  Adams ex rel. Kasper v. Sch. Bd. of St. \nJohns Cnty., 57 F.4th 791, 801 (11th Cir. 2022).  Under that standard, \nthe party seeking to uphold the policy carries the burden of “show-\ning that the [sex-based] classification serves ‘important governmen-\ntal objectives and that the discriminatory means employed’ are \n‘substantially  related  to  the  achievement  of  those  objectives.’”  \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 41 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 39 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  39 \nMiss.

Co., 446 U.S. 142, 150 (1980)). \n“For a government objective to be important, it cannot ‘rely \non overbroad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, \nor preferences of males and females.’”  Adams, 57 F.4th at 801 (quot-\ning United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996)).  And for a \npolicy’s means to be substantially related to a government objec-\ntive, there must be “enough of a fit” between the means and the \nasserted justification.  Id. (quoting Danskine v. Mia. Dade Fire Dep’t, \n253 F.3d 1288, 1299 (11th Cir. 2001)).  However, “the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause does not demand a perfect fit between means and ends \nwhen it comes to sex.”  Id.; see also Nguyen v. INS, 533 U.S. 53, 70 \n(2001) (“None of our gender-based classification equal protection \ncases have required that the [policy] under consideration must be \ncapable of achieving its ultimate objective in every instance.”). \nIn this case, the district court first held that section 4(a)(1)–\n(3) of the Act classifies on the basis of gender nonconformity and \ntherefore classifies on the basis of sex.  In determining that section \n4(a)(1)–(3) classifies on the basis of gender nonconformity, the dis-\ntrict court reasoned that section 4(a)(1)–(3) “prohibits transgender \nminors—and only transgender minors—from taking transitioning \nmedications due to their gender nonconformity.”  And, in holding \nthat a classification on the basis of gender nonconformity neces-\nsarily constitutes a classification on the basis of sex, the district \ncourt cited the reasoning of Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. \n1731 (2020), and Glenn v. Brumby, 663 F.3d 1312 (11th Cir. 2011).   \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 42 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 40 of 59\n40  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nAfter  determining  that  section  4(a)(1)–(3)  of  the  Act \namounts to a sex-based classification subject to intermediate scru-\ntiny, the district court then found that Alabama had not offered any \nexceedingly persuasive justification for the classification and thus \nconcluded that that the Minor Plaintiffs are substantially likely to \nsucceed on their equal protection claim.   \nOn appeal, Alabama maintains that section 4(a)(1)–(3) classi-\nfies on the bases of age and procedure, not sex or gender noncon-\nformity, and is therefore not subject to any heightened scrutiny \nabove rational basis review.  See Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, \n470 (1991) (“[A]ge is not a suspect classification under the Equal \nProtection Clause.”); Clark, 486 U.S. at 461 (listing suspect classifi-\ncations and making no reference to classifications based on proce-\ndures).  Alabama further argues that section 4(a)(1)–(3) would sur-\nvive at any level of scrutiny because it “serves the compelling \n[state] interest of protecting children from unproven, life-altering \nmedical interventions” and because “no other approach would of-\n \nfer children in Alabama adequate protection.”  \nIn response, the Minor Plaintiffs argue that section 4(a)(1)–\n(3) classifies on the basis of sex both directly, by using sex-based \nterms, and indirectly, by classifying on the basis of gender noncon-\nformity, and that the district court therefore properly applied inter-\nmediate scrutiny.  The Minor Plaintiffs also argue that, even if the \nmore lenient rational basis standard applies, section 4(a)(1)–(3) does \nnot pass muster.  For its part, the United States makes the argument \nthat section 4(a)(1)–(3) “triggers heightened scrutiny” because it \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 43 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 41 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  41 \n”discriminates against transgender persons, who constitute at least \na quasi-suspect class” by themselves, distinct from sex.   \nHaving carefully considered all of these positions, we agree \nwith Alabama that section 4(a)(1)–(3) is best understood as a law \nthat targets specific medical interventions for minors, not one that \nclassifies on the basis of any suspect characteristic under the Equal \nProtection Clause.  Section 4(a)(1)–(3) is therefore subject only to \nrational basis review—a standard that it almost undoubtedly satis-\nfies  for  the  reasons  discussed.    See supra  Section  III.A;  see also \nSkrmetti, 73 F.4th at 419 (finding it “highly unlikely” that the plain-\ntiffs could show that Tennessee’s substantially similar law “lacks a \nrational basis”).  Because the district court erroneously departed \nfrom that standard, its assessment regarding the Minor Plaintiffs’ \nlikelihood of success as to their equal protection claim cannot sup-\nport the preliminary injunction.  We reason as follows. \nTo  begin,  we  reject  the  view  that  section  4(a)(1)–(3) \namounts to a sex-based classification subject to intermediate scru-\ntiny.  As mentioned, one of the Minor Plaintiffs’ arguments is that \nsection 4(a)(1)–(3) directly classifies on the basis of sex because it \n“uses explicitly sex-based terms to criminalize certain treatments \n \nbased on a minor’s ‘sex.’”  Of course, section 4(a)(1)–(3) discusses \nsex insofar as it generally addresses treatment for discordance be-\ntween biological sex and gender identity, and insofar as it identifies \nthe applicable cross-sex hormone(s) for each sex—estrogen for \nmales and testosterone and other androgens for females.  We \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 44 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 42 of 59\n42  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nnonetheless believe the statute does not discriminate based on sex \nfor two reasons. \nFirst, the statute does not establish an unequal regime for \nmales and females.  In the Supreme Court’s leading precedent on \ngender-based intermediate scrutiny under the Equal Protection \nClause, the Court held that heightened scrutiny applies to “official \naction that closes a door or denies opportunity to women (or to \nmen).”  Virginia, 518 U.S. at 532.  Alabama’s law does not distin-\nguish between men and women in such a way.  Cf. Adams, 57 F.4th \nat 800–11.  Instead, section 4(a)(1)–(3) establishes a rule that applies \nequally to both sexes: it restricts the prescription and administra-\ntion of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormone treatment for pur-\nposes of treating discordance between biological sex and sense of \ngender identity for all minors.  See Skrmetti, 73 F.4th at 419 (explain-\ning that this sort of restriction on puberty blockers and cross-sex \nhormone treatment “does not prefer one sex to the detriment of \nthe other”).   \nSecond, the statute refers to sex only because the medical \nprocedures that it regulates—puberty blockers and cross-sex hor-\nmones as a treatment for gender dysphoria—are themselves sex-\nbased.  The Act regulates medical interventions to treat an incon-\ngruence between one’s biological sex and one’s perception of one’s \nsex.  The cross-sex hormone treatments for gender dysphoria are \ndifferent for males and for females because of biological differences \nbetween males and females—females are given testosterone and \nmales are given estrogen.  With regards to puberty blockers, those \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 45 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 43 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  43 \nmedications inhibit and suppress the production of testosterone in \nmales and estrogen in females.  For that reason, it is difficult to im-\nagine how a state might regulate the use of puberty blockers and \ncross-sex hormones for the relevant purposes in specific terms with-\nout referencing sex in some way.  Thus, we do not find the direct \nsex-classification argument to be persuasive. \nThe Minor Plaintiffs’ other sex-based argument is that sec-\ntion 4(a)(1)–(3) indirectly classifies on the basis of sex by classifying \non the basis of gender nonconformity.  This is the position that the \ndistrict court adopted, citing Bostock and Brumby.  Neither of those \ncases, however, dealt with the Equal Protection Clause as applied \nto laws regulating medical treatments.   \nBostock dealt with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \n§ 701 et seq., as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., in the context of \nemployment discrimination.  See 140 S. Ct. at 1737–41, 1754 (hold-\ning that “[a]n employer who fires an individual merely for being \ngay or transgender defies [Title VII]”).  After noting that “only the \nwords on the page constitute the law adopted by Congress and ap-\nproved by the President,” id. at 1738, the Court in Bostock relied \nexclusively on the specific text of Title VII.  The Court “pro-\nceed[ed] on the assumption that ‘sex’ . . . refer[s] only to biological \ndistinctions between male and female.” Id. at 1739.  But the Court \nreasoned that the combined ordinary meaning of the words “be-\ncause of,” id., “otherwise . . . discriminate against,” id. at 1740, and \n“individual,” id., led to the conclusion that Title VII makes “[a]n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 46 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 44 of 59\n44  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nindividual's homosexuality or transgender status . . . not relevant \nto employment decisions,” id. at 1741.  \nThe Equal Protection Clause contains none of the text that \nthe Court interpreted in Bostock.  It provides simply that “[n]o State \nshall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protec-\ntion of the laws.”  U.S. Const. amend XIV.  Because Bostock there-\nfore concerned a different law (with materially different language) \nand a different factual context, it bears minimal relevance to the \ninstant case.  See Skrmetti, 73 F.4th at 420 (finding that the reasoning \nof Bostock “applies only to Title VII”); see also Brandt ex rel. Brandt v. \nRutledge, No. 21-2875, 2022 WL 16957734, at *1 n.1 (8th Cir. Nov. \n16, 2022) (Stras, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (ex-\npressing skepticism that Bostock’s reasoning applies to the Equal \nProtection  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  because  the \nFourteenth Amendment “predates Title VII by nearly a century” \nand contains language that is “not similar in any way” to Title \nVII’s); see Students for Fair Admissions, Inc., v. President & Fellows of \nHarvard Coll., 143 S. Ct. 2141, 2220 (2023) (Gorsuch, J., concurring) \n(noting the different language in Title VI and the Equal Protection \nClause and explaining “[t]hat such differently worded provisions \nshould mean the same thing is implausible on its face.”) \nBrumby, on the other hand, did deal with the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause; but, like Bostock, Brumby concerned gender stereotyp-\ning in the context of employment discrimination.  See 663 F.3d at \n1313–20 (holding that “a government agent violates the Equal Pro-\ntection Clause’s prohibition of sex-based discrimination when he \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 47 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 45 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  45 \nor she fires a transgender or transsexual employee because of his or \nher gender non-conformity”).  So, while Brumby did involve the \nsame law at issue here—the Equal Protection Clause—it discussed \nthat law as applied to a particular factual scenario, i.e., one where \nan employer fired an employee for failing to adhere to certain ex-\npectations and stereotypes associated with the employee’s sex.  \nThat is not the scenario presented here.  Section 4(a)(1)–(3) targets \ncertain medical interventions for minors meant to treat the condi-\ntion of gender dysphoria; it does not further any particular gender \nstereotype.  Insofar as section 4(a)(1)–(3) involves sex, it simply re-\nflects biological differences between males and females, not stere-\notypes associated with either sex. \nTo be sure, section 4(a)(1)–(3) restricts a specific course of \nmedical treatment that, by the nature of things, only gender non-\nconforming individuals may receive.  But just last year, the Su-\npreme Court explained that “[t]he regulation of a medical proce-\ndure that only one sex can undergo does not trigger heightened \nconstitutional scrutiny unless the regulation is a ‘mere pretex[t] de-\nsigned to effect an invidious discrimination against members of one \nsex or the other.’”  Dobbs, 142 S. Ct. at 2245–46 (alteration in origi-\nnal) (quoting Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 U.S. 484, 496 n.20 (1974)); see \nalso id. at 2246 (recognizing that “the ‘goal of preventing abortion’ \ndoes  not  constitute  ‘invidiously  discriminatory  animus’  against \nwomen” (quoting Bray v. Alexandria Women’s Health Clinic, 506 U.S. \n263, 273–74 (1993))).  By the same token, the regulation of a course \nof treatment that only gender nonconforming individuals can un-\ndergo would not trigger heightened scrutiny unless the regulation \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 48 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 46 of 59\n46  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nwere a pretext for invidious discrimination against such individu-\nals.  And the district court did not find that Alabama’s law was \nbased on invidious discrimination.  \nWe  similarly  reject  the  United  States’  view  that  section \n4(a)(1)–(3) is subject to heightened scrutiny because it classifies on \nthe basis of transgender status, separate from sex.  As we recently \nexplained, “we have grave ‘doubt’ that transgender persons consti-\ntute a quasi-suspect class,” distinct from sex, under the Equal Pro-\ntection Clause.  Adams, 57 F.4th at 803 n.5.  Even if they did, for the \nreasons discussed with respect to gender nonconformity, section \n4(a)(1)–(3)’s relationship to transgender status would not trigger \nheightened scrutiny.  Chiefly, the regulation of a course of treat-\nment that, by the nature of things, only transgender individuals \nwould want to undergo would not trigger heightened scrutiny un-\nless the regulation is a pretext for invidious discrimination against \nsuch individuals, and, here, the district court made no findings of \nsuch a pretext.  For these reasons, we conclude that section 4(a)(1)–\n(3)’s relationship to transgender status does not warrant height-\nened scrutiny. \nApart from sex, gender nonconformity, and transgender sta-\ntus, the Minor Plaintiffs and the United States do not claim any \nother  suspect  classification.    All  the  parties  agree  that  section \n4(a)(1)–(3) draws distinctions on the basis of age.  However, “age is \nnot a suspect classification under the Equal Protection Clause.”  \nKimel v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, 83 (2000).  As a result, \n“[s]tates may discriminate on the basis of age without offending the \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 49 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 47 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  47 \nFourteenth Amendment if the age classification in question is ra-\ntionally related to a legitimate state interest.”  Id.  And “[t]he ra-\ntionality commanded by the Equal Protection Clause does not re-\nquire States to match age distinctions and the legitimate interests \nthey serve with razorlike precision.”  Id.   \nHere, it seems abundantly clear that section 4(a)(1)–(3) clas-\nsifies on the basis of age in a way that is rationally related to a le-\ngitimate state interest.  As discussed, Alabama has a legitimate in-\nterest in “safeguarding the physical and psychological well-being of \n. . . minor[s],” and notably that interest itself distinguishes minors \nfrom adults.  Otto, 981 F.3d at 868 (quoting Ferber, 458 U.S. at 756–\n57); see supra Section III.A.  Section 4(a)(1)–(3) furthers that interest \nby restricting the prescription and administration of puberty block-\ners and cross-sex hormone treatment to minors for purposes of \ntreating discordance between biological sex and sense of gender \nidentity based on the rational understanding that many minors \nmay not be finished forming their identities and may not fully ap-\npreciate the associated risks.  Moreover, Alabama’s decision to draw \nthe line at the age of nineteen sufficiently approximates the divide \nbetween individuals who warrant government protection and indi-\nviduals who are better able to make decisions for themselves; it is \nneither too over- nor under-inclusive.  For these reasons, it is ex-\nceedingly likely that section 4(a)(1)–(3) satisfies rational basis re-\nview as a classification on the basis of age. \nSection 4(a)(1)–(3) is therefore subject only to rational basis \nreview—a standard that it is exceedingly likely to satisfy for the \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 50 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 48 of 59\n48  Opinion of the Court  22-11707 \nreasons discussed.  See supra Section III.A.  The district court erred \nas a matter of law by applying heightened scrutiny, and that error \ntainted its assessment of Plaintiffs’ likelihood of success.  Because \nthat is true with respect to both the due process claim and the equal \nprotection claim, we vacate the preliminary injunction. \n* * * * \n  This case revolves around an issue that is surely of the ut-\nmost importance to all of the parties involved: the safety and well-\nbeing of the children of Alabama.  But it is complicated by the fact \nthat there is a strong disagreement between the parties over what \nis best for those children.  Absent a constitutional mandate to the \ncontrary, these types of issues are quintessentially the sort that our \nsystem of government reserves to legislative, not judicial, action.  \nFaced with this difficult and delicate set of circumstances, \nthe district court granted the “extraordinary and drastic remedy” \nthat is a preliminary injunction and enjoined Alabama from enforc-\ning part of the law in dispute.  See Callaway, 489 F.2d at 573.  In \ndoing so, the district court determined that section 4(a)(1)–(3) of \nthe Act is subject to heightened scrutiny on due process and equal \nprotection grounds and therefore the parties challenging the law \nhad a substantial likelihood of success on the merits as to those \nclaims.  That was erroneous.  With respect to the Parent Plaintiffs’ \nsubstantive due process claim, the district court divined, without \nadequate historical support, that the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment protects the right to “treat [one’s] children \nwith  transitioning  medications  subject  to  medically  accepted \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 51 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 49 of 59\n22-11707   Opinion of the Court  49 \nstandards.”  And with respect to the Minor Plaintiffs’ equal protec-\ntion claim, the district court determined that the law classifies on \nthe basis of sex, when in reality the law simply reflects real, biolog-\nical differences between males and females and equally restricts the \nuse of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormone treatment for mi-\nnors of both sexes.  Because the district court reviewed the law un-\nder the wrong standard of scrutiny in connection with both claims, \nthe issuance of the preliminary injunction constituted an abuse of \ndiscretion.  See Curling v. Raffensperger, 50 F.4th 1114, 1121 (11th Cir. \n2022) (“[A] court abuses its discretion in granting a preliminary in-\njunction if, in determining whether success is likely, it incorrectly \nor unreasonably applies the law.”). \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, we vacate the district court’s preliminary \ninjunction on the enforcement of section 4(a)(1)–(3) of the Act. \nVACATED. \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 52 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 50 of 59\n22-11707   BRASHER, J., Concurring  1 \nBRASHER, Circuit Judge, concurring: \nI concur in the Court’s opinion. I write separately to focus \non the plaintiffs’ equal protection claim.  \nThe resolution of an equal protection claim often turns on \nthe level of scrutiny that we apply—rational basis, intermediate, or \nstrict. The plaintiffs argue that the statute classifies based on sex, \nwhich warrants intermediate scrutiny. The Court rejects that argu-\nment, and, after much deliberation and research, I agree. Ala-\nbama’s statute does not treat one sex differently than the other. It \ndoes not use sex as a proxy for some more germane classification. \nAnd it is not based on a sex stereotype. Instead, I think the law is \nbest read to classify—not based on sex—but as between minors \nwho want puberty blockers and hormones to treat a “discordance \nbetween their sex and their internal sense of identity,” Ala. Code \n§ 26-26-2(2), and those minors who want these drugs to treat a dif-\nferent condition.  \nBut even if the statute did discriminate based on sex, I think \nit is likely to satisfy intermediate scrutiny. If Alabama’s statute in-\nvolves a sex-based classification that triggers heightened scrutiny, \nit does so because it is otherwise impossible to regulate these drugs \ndifferently when they are prescribed as a treatment for gender dys-\nphoria than when they are prescribed for other purposes. As long \nas the state has a substantial justification for regulating differently \nthe use of puberty blockers and hormones for different purposes, \nthen I think this law satisfies intermediate scrutiny. \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 53 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 51 of 59\n2  BRASHER, J., Concurring  22-11707 \nI.    \nI’ll start with the level of scrutiny that applies to this law. We \nshould be cautious when we are asked to extend heightened scru-\ntiny to novel facts like these. As Justice Stevens explained in one of \nthe Court’s leading cases on sex discrimination, the text of the \nEqual Protection Clause does not subject state laws to different lev-\nels of judicial scrutiny. See Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 211–12 (1976) \n(Stevens, J., concurring). The Clause “requires every State to gov-\nern impartially,” and it “does not direct the courts to apply one \nstandard of review in some cases and a different standard in other \ncases.” Id.; see also United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 570 (1996) \n(Scalia, J., dissenting) (calling tiers of scrutiny “made-up tests”); \nWhole  Woman’s  Health  v.  Hellerstedt,  579  U.S.  582,  638  (2016) \n(Thomas,  J.,  dissenting)  (calling  tiers  of  scrutiny  “increasingly \nmeaningless  . . .  formalism”).  Moreover,  some  of  the Supreme \nCourt’s most recent (and significant) equal protection precedents \ndon’t apply the tiers of scrutiny. E.g., Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. \n644, 672–76 (2015). \nNonetheless, the Supreme Court has established the tiers of \nscrutiny, and lower courts must apply that doctrine the best we \ncan. In doing so, I think we must appreciate that the tiers of scru-\ntiny are “no more scientific than their names suggest.” Virginia, 518 \nU.S. at 567 (Scalia, J., dissenting). They should be “guidelines in-\nforming our approach to the case at hand, not tests to be mechani-\ncally applied.” Williams-Yulee v. Fla. Bar, 575 U.S. 433, 457 (2015) \n(Breyer, J., concurring). To that end, when we are asked to apply \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 54 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 52 of 59\n22-11707   BRASHER, J., Concurring  3 \nheightened scrutiny on novel facts, we need to ensure that the pur-\nposes of the doctrine warrant that approach.  \nIn my view, many judges have mechanically applied inter-\nmediate scrutiny to laws like Alabama’s without considering the \nreasons we subject sex classifications to heightened scrutiny. Con-\nsider the Eighth Circuit’s decision in Brandt by & through Brandt v. \nRutledge, 47 F.4th 661 (8th Cir. 2022). There, the court concluded \nthat Arkansas’s comparable law discriminates based on sex be-\ncause, referring to cross-sex hormones, it said that “medical proce-\ndures that are permitted for a minor of one sex are prohibited for a \nminor of another sex.” Id. at 669. But the court ignored the law’s \nban on puberty blockers, which applies the same way to both sexes. \nAnd, more fundamentally, the court did not explain how applying \nheightened scrutiny to a law that regulates sex-specific medical in-\nterventions is consistent with the reasons the Supreme Court cre-\nated that standard. \nTurning back to this case, Alabama’s law is replete with sex-\nrelated language. But, even though the statute uses sex-related lan-\nguage, I think it is wrong to say that the statute classifies based on \nsex. The law regulates drugs that treat a “discordance between [an \nindividual’s] sex and their internal sense of identity.” Ala. Code \n§ 26-26-2(2). The law defines “sex” as “[t]he biological state of being \nmale or female, based on the individual’s sex organs, chromo-\nsomes, and endogenous hormone profiles.” Id. § 26-26-3(3). Then \nthe law prohibits various treatments “for the purpose of attempting \nto alter the appearance of or affirm the minor’s perception of his or \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 55 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 53 of 59\n4  BRASHER, J., Concurring  22-11707 \nher gender or sex, if that appearance or perception is inconsistent \nwith the minor’s sex as defined in this [act].” Id. § 26-26-4(a). \nI see the word “sex” in this law. But I don’t see a sex classifi-\ncation—at least, not as the idea of a sex classification appears in our \nequal-protection caselaw. Instead, it seems to me that this sex-re-\nlated language classifies between, on the one hand, those minors \nwho want these drugs to treat a “discordance between their sex and \ntheir internal sense of identity” and, on the other hand, those mi-\nnors who want these drugs to treat a different condition. The Equal \nProtection Clause “is essentially a direction that all persons simi-\nlarly  situated  should  be  treated  alike.”  City of Cleburne, Tex. v. \nCleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985). So the right question \nunder the Equal Protection Clause is whether these two groups—\nthose who want to use these drugs to treat a discordance between \ntheir sex and gender identity and those who want to use these \ndrugs to treat other conditions—are similarly situated.  \nThat question isn’t one that seems suited to heightened scru-\ntiny. The Equal Protection Clause prohibits “giv[ing] a mandatory \npreference to members of either sex over members of the other.” \nReed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71, 76 (1971). We apply heightened scrutiny \nto sex classifications because of an intuition that, “[r]ather than rest-\ning on meaningful considerations, statutes distributing benefits and \nburdens between the sexes in different ways very likely reflect out-\nmoded notions of the relative capabilities of men and women.” City \nof Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 441. When we apply heightened scrutiny to \na  statute  that  classifies  based  on  sex,  the  point  is  to  ascertain \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 56 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 54 of 59\n22-11707   BRASHER, J., Concurring  5 \nwhether the classification is based on “traditional, often inaccurate, \nassumptions about the proper roles of men and women.” Miss. \nUniv. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 725–26 (1982). We are also \nseeking to ensure that sex is not being used as an “inaccurate proxy \nfor other, more germane bases of classification.” Craig, 429 U.S. at \n198.  \nNone of these rationales apply to the line drawn in Ala-\nbama’s statute. It doesn’t distribute benefits or burdens between \nmen and women or arguably use sex as a proxy for other interests. \nIt bans a course of treatment—puberty blockers and hormones—\nfor a particular condition that affects both boys and girls. Another \nway to think about it: an injunction against the enforcement of Al-\nabama’s law under equal-protection principles will not equalize \nburdens or benefits between girls and boys. It will not require the \ngovernment to treat boys and girls the same. It will merely force \nAlabama to either ban puberty blockers and hormones for all pur-\nposes or allow them for all purposes. \nFor its part, the district court applied heightened scrutiny on \nthe theory that Alabama’s statute discriminates based on a sex ste-\nreotype because it targets medical interventions for transgender \npeople, i.e., those who feel a “discordance between their sex and \ntheir internal sense of identity.” The district court cited Glenn v. \nBrumby, 663 F.3d 1312, 1320 (11th Cir. 2011), for this proposition, \nbut I think it misread that precedent.1 In Glenn, we concluded that \n \n1 I don’t fault the district court for reaching the conclusion that it did. The \ndistrict court did an admirable job with a difficult case on an expedited \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 57 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 55 of 59\n6  BRASHER, J., Concurring  22-11707 \na  public  employer  engaged  in  sex  discrimination  by  firing  a \ntransgender employee who was born a man because the employee \nbegan wearing stereotypical women’s clothing. Id. at 1314. The \nemployer  allowed  biological  women  to  wear  stereotypical \nwomen’s clothing, but not biological men. We held that the em-\nployer had engaged in sex discrimination under the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause—not because it fired a transgender employee—but be-\ncause it fired an employee “on the basis of gender-based behavioral \nnorms.” Id. at 1316–17. By ruling against that practice under the \ncircumstances of that case, we required the employer to treat men \nand women equally, no matter their clothing choices.  \nUnlike the employer’s decision in Glenn, Alabama’s statute \ndoes not fit the mold of a sex-based stereotype. The statute isn’t \nbased on a socially constructed generalization about the way men \nor women should behave. It does not reinforce an “assumption[] \nabout the proper roles of men and women” in our society. Hogan, \n458 U.S. at 725–26. And it doesn’t reflect society’s “notions of the \nrelative capabilities of men and women.” City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. \nat 441. To be sure, the statute’s classification reflects the govern-\nment’s recognition that, without medical intervention, a healthy \nchild will mature in accord with his or her biological sex. But the \nrecognition of biological reality is “not a stereotype.” Nguyen v. INS, \n533 U.S. 53, 68 (2001). \n \ntimeframe. One of the benefits of the appellate process is that we have more \ntime and resources to assess a legal question, which sometimes yields a differ-\nent result. \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 58 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 56 of 59\n22-11707   BRASHER, J., Concurring  7 \nThe district court—viewing this case through the lens of sex \nstereotyping—did not make any findings on whether the state was \njustified in treating people differently because they want these \ndrugs to treat a discordance between their sex and gender identity \ninstead of some other condition. But the state has identified many \nreasons for drawing that line. For example, the record reflects that \nother countries are regulating the drugs differently for these pur-\nposes, and the FDA has not approved them for this purpose alt-\nhough it has for others. I cannot say that those reasons fail the leni-\nent standard of rational basis review. See Jones v. Gov. of Fla., 975 \nF.3d 1016, 1034–35 (11th Cir. 2020). \nII.   \nAlthough I believe rational basis scrutiny likely applies, I also \nthink that, even if Alabama’s statute triggered intermediate scru-\ntiny, it would likely survive that heightened scrutiny.  \nIntermediate scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause \ndoes not require us to ask whether a law is good or bad policy, but \nwhether a government has a good reason for using a sex-based clas-\nsification in a law. The relevant question is whether “the classifica-\ntion serves ‘important governmental objectives and that the discrim-\ninatory means employed’ are ‘substantially related to the achieve-\nment of those objectives.’” Hogan, 458 U.S. at 724 (quoting Wengler \nv. Druggists Mutual Ins. Co., 446 U.S. 142, 150 (1980)) (emphasis \nadded). As I discuss above, the purpose of this heightened scrutiny \nis to ensure that laws based on sex classifications aren’t using those \nclassifications  because  of  “outmoded  notions  of  the  relative \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 59 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 57 of 59\n8  BRASHER, J., Concurring  22-11707 \ncapabilities of men and women.” City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 441. \nInstead, the use of sex must reflect that it is a “meaningful consid-\neration[]” on which the law is based. Id. And so, under intermediate \nscrutiny, the government’s burden is to establish “an ‘exceedingly \npersuasive justification’ for the classification.” Hogan, 458 U.S. at 724 \n(quoting Kirchberg v. Feenstra, 450 U.S. 455, 461 (1981)) (emphasis \nadded).  \nAssuming the classification in this law is subject to interme-\ndiate scrutiny, I believe the state probably has an “exceedingly per-\nsuasive justification” for regulating these drugs differently when \nthey are used to treat a discordance between an individual’s sex and \nsense of gender identity than when they are used for other pur-\nposes. See Sessions v. Morales-Santana, 582 U.S. 47, 58 (2017) (quot-\ning Virginia, 518 U.S. at 531). The record reflects that the use of \npuberty blockers and hormones for this purpose specifically carries \npotentially uncertain risks. The record also reflects that there is un-\ncertainty about how to tell which patients need these interventions \nfor this purpose and which don’t. Although further fact finding in \nthis litigation will test the plausibility of those concerns, Alabama \ndoesn’t have to conclusively prove these things to have an im-\nportant governmental interest. Intermediate scrutiny permits “the \nlegislature [to] make a predictive judgment” based on competing \nevidence.  Brown v. Entm’t Merchs. Ass’n,  564  U.S.  786,  799–800 \n(2011) (discussing relative burdens of intermediate and strict scru-\ntiny). \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 60 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 58 of 59\n22-11707   BRASHER, J., Concurring  9 \nLikewise, I think the state’s interest is sufficiently related to \nthe sex classification in the law to the extent there is one. Assuming \nthis statute involves a sex-based classification, it does so because \nthere is no other way to regulate treatments for a “discordance be-\ntween [an individual’s] sex and their internal sense of identity” \nwithout drawing such a distinction. Alabama would have to use \nsex-based language to regulate those treatments even if it wanted \nto subsidize them instead of banning them. So, if intermediate scru-\ntiny applied here, the “sufficiently related” question collapses into \nthe state interest question: it is whether Alabama has an important \ngovernmental interest in regulating the use of puberty blockers and \nhormones for a “discordance between [an individual’s] sex and \ntheir internal sense of identity” but not for other uses. Because the \nrecord reflects that the state has that kind of interest, the statute’s \nclassification likely satisfies intermediate scrutiny.  \nThe plaintiffs argue, in part, that Alabama is not justified in \nbanning these treatments because there are less restrictive alterna-\ntives to a ban. But I don’t think that is how intermediate scrutiny \nworks under the Equal Protection Clause. Consider how the Su-\npreme Court applied intermediate scrutiny in Craig v. Boren, 429 \nU.S. 190 (1976). There, a state law prohibited sales of alcohol to \nmen between the ages of eighteen and twenty but not women in \nthat age range. Id. at 191–92. The Court accepted that the goal of \nthis law—“the enhancement of traffic safety”—is an important in-\nterest. Id. at 199–200. But it held that the government did not have \nsufficient evidence that a “gender-based distinction closely serves \nto achieve that objective.” Id. at 200. The Court in Craig never \n \n\nCase 2:22-cv-00184-LCB-CWB   Document 312   Filed 08/30/23   Page 61 of 65\nUSCA11 Case: 22-11707     Document: 125-1     Date Filed: 08/21/2023     Page: 59 of 59\n10  BRASHER, J., Concurring  22-11707 \nasked whether the state’s decision to ban under-21-year-old men \nfrom drinking alcohol was justified as compared to some less re-\nstrictive, but equally sex-based, alternative—such as making men \ntake additional driving classes or the like. Instead, the Court as-\nsessed only whether the sex-based classification fit closely enough to \nthe purposes of the law. Likewise, here, I think we can resolve the \nplaintiffs’ equal protection claim by assessing whether the state has \nan interest in classifying based on sex without also asking whether, \neven if the state were allowed to classify based on sex, the state \ncould achieve its objective with some lesser restriction. \nIn short, assuming this law is subject to intermediate scru-\ntiny, I think it likely passes. On this record, it seems clear that the \nstate has an interest in regulating these drugs differently when they \nare prescribed to treat a discordance between sex and gender than \nwhen they are prescribed to treat other conditions. And the state \ncannot do that without drawing the lines it has drawn in this stat-\nute. \nIII.   \nWhether rational basis or intermediate scrutiny applies, I be-\nlieve this appeal comes out the same way: the state will likely pre-\nvail on the merits. Future findings of fact in the district court may \nestablish otherwise. But at this stage, the plaintiffs have not carried \ntheir burden entitling them to a preliminary injunction.
